1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,200
<i>in view of the controversy</i>
<i>already aroused,</i>

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,300
<i>the producers of this film</i>

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>wish to re-emphasise</i>
<i>what is already stated in the film,</i>

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>that there is no established</i>
<i>scientific connection</i>

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
<i>between Mongolism</i>

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,900
<i>and psychotic or criminal behaviour.</i>

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,100
Right, come on, Pete-boy,
here we go...

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
You ready?

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,400
- Yes.
- Catch!

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,500
Very good!

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
Right, your turn now then.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,800
- Ok?
- Yes.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello... you wanna
play with us? 

15
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,200
- Yeah.
- Alright...

16
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,400
you stand over there,
I'll take you both on.

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Tommy!

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,700
Oh, Tommy... Mummy's
got to go now.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,900
- I'm so sorry.
- Ok.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,100
- Come on, the bell's gone.
- Too bad, Pete.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,300
Back soon. We'll have
another go, ok?

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
Take it easy, boy.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,600
Don't do anything 
I wouldn't do.

24
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Uhh!

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,900
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello, Martin.

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,200
- Want a word?
- Yeah, thanks.

28
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,300
Come on in then.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Let's have some coffee, Jack.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,600
Putting on a bit of 
weight, isn't he?

31
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,800
Huh. Too much chocolate.
They all spoil him.

32
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,900
And why not?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Anything he needs?

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,200
Well you can bring some rubber
nappies next time if you like.

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,300
Thanks, Jack.

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Can't have too many of those.

37
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,600
We never managed to get him
house-trained, for some reason.

38
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Thanks.

39
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,900
Hasn't got much 
longer, has he?

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100
Well he's already had
longer than most, Martin.

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,800
- Should I get mother down?
- No, no...

42
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,000
he wouldn't know her,
not after all this time.

43
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Only disturb her.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Wouldn't help him.

45
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,400
He'd miss me though,
wouldn't he?

46
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,600
Ahh, you're part 
of a pattern.

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,700
He expects you.

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,900
Tell me, how are things
at home, Martin?

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Fine!

50
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,200
No, leave it. 
It doesn't matter.

51
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,400
Well, better be
getting back.

52
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
Sorry about the cup.

53
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Thanks.

54
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Martin...

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,900
How about you...
how are you getting on?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Me?

57
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,100
That's the stuff!

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
Bye.

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
How does this one work?

60
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,500
How much is the
Moon Explorer?

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,700
Thirty-nine and 
eleven, miss.

62
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,900
Oh lord, that's 
far too much.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
- I'll take one of these.
- Thank you. 

64
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,100
Twenty-five shillings.

65
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
There's your receipt.

66
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Here we are, miss.

67
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Thank you.

68
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Just a moment, you two.

69
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,700
- Me?
- Both of you.

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,900
Would you mind coming to 
the manager's office, please.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Alright, then.

72
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,200
Perhaps you two would
care to explain?

73
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Explain what?

74
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,500
The toys you have
in your possession.

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
I bought a toy...

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
I paid for it...

77
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
and here's the receipt.

78
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
Yes we know.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,100
And while you kept 
the assistant busy, your...

80
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
boyfriend here...

81
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,400
put another toy in his pocket
and didn't pay for it.

82
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Boyfriend?!

83
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,700
I've never seen him
before in my life!

84
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,900
They <i>do</i> know each 
other, Mr Goss.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,100
That's right. We saw the
looks they exchanged.

86
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,300
You know, you'll find 
it much easier...

87
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,500
if you make a clean
breast of it.

88
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,700
I tell you, he's a 
complete stranger!

89
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,900
Well don't just sit 
there... tell them!

90
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Please.

91
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,200
Hmm... we know 
what he'll say.

92
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Here it is, Mr Goss.

93
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
In his pocket.

94
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Now then, young man...

95
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
before I call the police...

96
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
what have you to say?

97
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Georgie likes ducks.

98
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
Never meant to take it.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He forgot.

100
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Absent minded, eh?

101
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,300
So your name's 
Georgie, is it?

102
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,500
And your friend here,
what's her name?

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Georgie has no friends.

104
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
Georgie wants to 
go home now.

105
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,900
I dare say he does...

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,100
but let's see what he's got
in the other pocket first.

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,300
Look, I think there's been some
kind of a mistake, don't you?

108
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,500
I'm sorry you've been
involved in this, miss.

109
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,700
If I could have your
name and address.

110
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Yes, of course.

111
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,900
Susan Harper...

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
17, Richmond Grove.

113
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
You will let him go, won't you?

114
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I shall have to report it, miss.

115
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,400
Oh, for a two and
sixpenny toy?

116
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Surely, if I pay for it?

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,700
- Well you don't have to, miss.
- No, I'd like to, please.

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,900
- Here.
- Thank you.

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's very good of you.

120
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
Georgie...

121
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
This is yours, now.

122
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
So sorry, madam.

123
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
Most unfortunate.

124
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Thank you.

125
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
A toy duck. How about that?

126
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,800
Now tell me, why in God's name
does he have to steal a toy duck?!

127
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Wish I knew, Darling.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you sure?

129
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,000
I mean...

130
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,100
wh.. wh.. what's gone wrong?

131
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,300
- Is it my fault?
- No, of course not.

132
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,500
If anybody's to blame it's me...
I've spoilt him.

133
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
And I've helped you.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,900
You've been wonderful.
If he'd been your own son...

135
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,100
I've have done a 
damn sight less!

136
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,300
I mean it isn't as
if he's stupid.

137
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,500
What did his tutor
at Oxford say...

138
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,166
'Could be brilliant'.
What happens? 

139
00:08:24,266 --> 00:08:26,900
- Gets himself sent down.
- Darling, he did explain.

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, he always explains.

141
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
Look at those jobs I found him...

142
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
how long did he keep them?

143
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,400
Not everyone's cut out 
for a stockbroker's office.

144
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,600
Then what is he
cut out for?

145
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,700
He was keen on farming...

146
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
where did that get us?

147
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,000
Christopher takes him on,
within twenty-four hours...

148
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,200
young Pamela runs 
screaming to her mother...

149
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
where did they find him... 

150
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,500
stark naked in 
her bedroom!

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,700
Be fair, Henry... no girl
is that innocent.

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,900
She must have given 
him some encouragement.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I tell you, Enid...

154
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,200
if we don't teach him,
I know who will...

155
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,300
the police.

156
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,600
- I'll talk to him.
- No! 

157
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,800
There'll be no
more talking.

158
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,000
This time something's
gotta be done.

159
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,100
And I'm gonna do it!

160
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Now, how about that...

161
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,400
there you are
you see... typical!

162
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,600
Comes creeping in,
sneaks upstairs...

163
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,800
disappears without
a word!

164
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,000
I'd like to know what
he does up there...

165
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,200
day after day,
with a door locked!

166
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,300
Now come along, Martin...

167
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,500
your father says 
you're to get up.

168
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
And give me that...

169
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,800
it's going to be 
thrown out.

170
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,000
But <i>you</i> gave 
it to me!

171
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,100
You were in nappies once...

172
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,300
you don't still need
them, do you?

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
No, Mummy...

174
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
<i>I</i> don't.

175
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,700
And all this other junk...
that's going too.

176
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
You've just to to grow up!

177
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Marty, Darling...

178
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
here...

179
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,200
What made you
take it, Marty?

180
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,300
This?

181
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,500
Well... he'll have
fun with this.

182
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,700
But you could have
paid for it.

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
I was going to.

184
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,000
Cow of a store detective
never game me a chance!

185
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Honest, Mummy.

186
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,300
Oh, Darling, is
that a spot?

187
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Hmm?

188
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,600
Oh, you've got such
a lovely skin.

189
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
Must take care of it.

190
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Yup...

191
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:01,900
I do.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
I wish you wouldn't
go down there.

193
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Disturbs you.

194
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,300
Does it?

195
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Ghastly place!

196
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
You put 'im there.

197
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,700
It hasn't done his bladder
much good, I can tell you that.

198
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,900
- That's cruel, Marty!
- It's the truth.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,100
- He's happier there!
- Is he?

200
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Of course he is!

201
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,400
Anyway, I had your future
to think about.

202
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Oh, I know...

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,700
Pete would have been 
a bit of a handicap...

204
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,900
in the marriage stakes,
wouldn't he?

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You might never have made it.

206
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,100
Oh, stop it, Martin!

207
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,300
Don't worry, Mum...
it's our secret.

208
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,500
I'll never tell the
old bastard.

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Stop it, I say!

210
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,800
- Your father...
- That's <i>not</i> my father!

211
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,000
Mine's six feet under in 
Putney... chasing worms!

212
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,200
And from what I
remember of 'im...

213
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,400
they'll be enjoying
his company.

214
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Martin, I sometimes wonder...

215
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,700
whether you feel anything
for anybody.

216
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
'Cept you, Mummy.

217
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,900
Ok... all yours.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes... you're right.

219
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Have you got the time?

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes, ten-past nine.

221
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,400
Oh, goodness... 
I am late.

222
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Ere... got any change, mate?

223
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,700
And the best of British
luck to you too!

224
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,900
- See you, bye.
- Yes, see you this evening.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,100
Come along, all inside.
Hold tight.

226
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
He, he, he.

227
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Here we are...

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
how 'bout this?

229
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
'The Tower of London'?

230
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,700
Get off! That's
history, innit?!

231
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,900
Well, that's blood-thirsty enough.
Even for you, Johnny.

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Any girls in it?

233
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,200
Well there's Lady Jane Grey.
She gets the chopper.

234
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
I'd rather 'ave Lady
Chatterley.

235
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,582
Mmm, I bet you would!
But you take this...

236
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,698
you'll like it, I promise you.

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Thank you.

238
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,000
- There you are.
- Thanks.

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,100
- See ya!
- Goodbye, doll!

240
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Bye.

241
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Yes, please?

242
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Hello.

243
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Georgie!

244
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
Hello!

245
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,700
What are you doing here?

246
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
What's this for?

247
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,900
The duck.

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,100
But I told you... that
was a present.

249
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
A... present for you.

250
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
For me?

251
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Oh, thank you, Georgie!

252
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Thank you, very much!

253
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,500
But how did you find me?

254
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Followed you.

255
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Where from?

256
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Your home.

257
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,000
But if you were there, 
why didn't I see you?

258
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,200
There was a black man 
with you.

259
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
Oh, Shashie.

260
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
He's a 'P.G.'

261
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,600
A 'Paying Guest', he
lives with us.

262
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,800
Does he take you
to the cinema?

263
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,000
He hasn't yet...
he might.

264
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Georgie could take you!

265
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Oh... well...

266
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,400
that's very sweet of
you, Georgie, but I can't.

267
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,600
Honestly, I have 
to work at night.

268
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Here?

269
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
At home... for my exams.

270
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,000
I want to be a
teacher, Georgie.

271
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Oh.

272
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,300
Look, you can't 
go around like that...

273
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Here, let me.

274
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Take these, Miss Harper.

275
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Look...

276
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,800
I don't know whether you're
dressing or undressing your friend...

277
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,900
but I do wish you wouldn't
do it in the public library!

278
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sorry, Georgie.

279
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,200
I must get on with
my work now, really.

280
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Goodbye.

281
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Thank you for the chocolates.

282
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
Please.

283
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Can't Georgie have a book?

284
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,600
About animals.

285
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Of course you can.

286
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Come on, we'll find one.

287
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Got your ticket?

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No.

289
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,100
Oh...

290
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Where do you live, Georgie?

291
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
In hotels... in London.

292
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
With my Daddy.

293
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I tell you what...

294
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
I'll take it out in my name...

295
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,800
and when you've finished,
bring it back.

296
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,000
But be sure you do or 
I'll get into trouble.

297
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
Ok?

298
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Yes...

299
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,300
Susan.

300
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
What a load of crap!

301
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Martin!

302
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Martin!

303
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Oh...

304
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,900
Come down a 
moment, please.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Come in, lad... sit down.

306
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
I've good news for you...

307
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
you're off to Australia, Perth...

308
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,400
in about three
weeks time.

309
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Am I?

310
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,700
Yes. I've spoken to
our people...

311
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
they fixed a job for you.

312
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Sheep farming.

313
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,100
Oh, what you make of
the job is up to you.

314
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
I see.

315
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,400
Everything's settled 
then, is it?

316
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Yes...

317
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
air ticket, passport.

318
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,800
Your permit will be through
in a few days time.

319
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, you'll need clothes of course,
but get 'em out there.

320
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,100
I'll pay.

321
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
And Mum?

322
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
She heard the good news?

323
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
She has...

324
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Upset?

325
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
Buckets of tears?

326
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
She's upset, of course...

327
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
but, she agrees.

328
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,900
Of course.

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,100
Always upset,
always agrees.

330
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,300
I want none of that... 
this is for your good!

331
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,400
Mine? Not yours?

332
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Or hers?

333
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Martin...

334
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,800
the one thing in the world
your Mother most wants...

335
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,900
is a man out of you!

336
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,100
Now, don't you give
a damn about that?

337
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Her happiness?

338
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,300
What do you think?

339
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
I'll tell you what I think...

340
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,600
I think the most worrying
thing about you is...

341
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,800
that you haven't got
a single friend.

342
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Not one!

343
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,100
- Haven't I?
- Well who?

344
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Come on, tell me... who!?

345
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Wouldn't you like to know.

346
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,500
And now it's about time
I let <i>you</i> into a little secret...

347
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,600
You mind?

348
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,800
You... can't send 
me anywhere!

349
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Can't I?

350
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

351
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
I've over twenty-one.

352
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,300
Then it's bloody well
time you acted like it!

353
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
So I'm not going.

354
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,500
But thanks for the offer.

355
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,700
Well you're not 
staying either.

356
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
How about that!?

357
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Here...

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,100
you can try starting
as I did...

359
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
with fifty pounds.

360
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,300
Lets see how far you get.

361
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Now... pack up!

362
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Go on!

363
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,700
I want you out of this
house by tomorrow.

364
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Ok.

365
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
And I may need this.

366
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thanks.

367
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,100
Dad.

368
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,300
Tomorrow... you 
understand?!

369
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Keep the change.

370
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Face it, Enid...

371
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
he's not normal.

372
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,800
Now, where the devil did
I put those cufflinks?

373
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, it's alright, here
they are.

374
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,200
He should have seen 
that psychiatrist...

375
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
when I wanted him to.

376
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Please, God...

377
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Oh, thank you, sir.

378
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Belgravia, 00102, please.

379
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,800
- Your Belgravia number, sir.
- Thanks.

380
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,000
Hello, Mummy? This 
is Martin.

381
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Oh, Marty, Darling...

382
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
thank God you phoned!

383
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Where are you?

384
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,400
London Airport.

385
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
What are you doing there?

386
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,700
Listen Mummy, I'm off 
to Paris in a few minutes.

387
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Paris?!

388
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Mummy, listen.

389
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,100
I had a row with 
Dad last night.

390
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Yes, I know.

391
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,400
I'm sorry, Mummy. He was
right. I was wrong.

392
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Tell him I am going 
to Australia...

393
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
if that's what he wants.

394
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Oh... Darling, of course!

395
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,000
Must go now, flight's
been called.

396
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,200
I'll be back in... two
weeks. Ok?

397
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,400
But Marty, Darling...
tell me, why Paris?

398
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
What made you...

399
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
I'll write you, Mummy.
Goodbye.

400
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Silly old cow!

401
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,000
I want this posted
for me in Paris.

402
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Any ideas?

403
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,300
- Full of them, sir.
- Know anyone going today?

404
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,500
- You leave it to me, Mr Clifford.
- Thanks.

405
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,700
You know... bit of
bird trouble.

406
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,900
Supposed to be there...
rather be here.

407
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,100
We've all been 
through it, sir.

408
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,300
Don't worry, it's 
on it's way.

409
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

410
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,700
I want you to send
some flowers for me.

411
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Where to, sir?

412
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Seventeen, Richmond Grove.

413
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Well it's clear enough...

414
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,200
'With thanks for all your
kindness', James Clifford.

415
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,400
But I've never even
heard of him.

416
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
You must have.

417
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,700
One of the boys from
the university?

418
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
Roses? That lot?

419
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,000
I know what they expect
for a bar of chocolate!

420
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,200
What, and don't they
ever get it then, love?

421
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,400
Or don't you like
chocolate?

422
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Not even a little nibble?

423
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
He, he, he.

424
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Roses then, eh?

425
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,900
I'll begin to hear the
patter of tiny feet.

426
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Ha, ha. All I can hear is the
patter of tiny minds!

427
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha...

428
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,400
Still... it's 'ere to 
stay, you know.

429
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
So you keep reminding us.

430
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,600
Well why not?

431
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,700
It's on me mind, love.

432
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,900
It's like I keep telling these
long-haired directors...

433
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,100
if you want me to sell your
crummy films, I say...

434
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,300
you've gotta give it a 
a good dose of 'S and V'.

435
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,400
That's what the public wants.

436
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Sex and violence.

437
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,700
Cartoon, ice cream, 
the old 'S and V'...

438
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
and they're happy.

439
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,000
What do you say
Professor?

440
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
- Me, Mr Henderson?
- Yeah.

441
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,300
Ah...

442
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,400
well in my country,

443
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,616
'S and V' used to mean...

444
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,700
- 'Shoot the Viceroy'.
- Ha, ha, ha.

445
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,900
Today it means a 
population explosion...

446
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
and food riots.

447
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,200
And both seem to call forward
a strength, Mr Henderson.

448
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,300
A rare quality.

449
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Yeah, maybe.

450
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
But I tell you one thing...

451
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,700
you'll never make 
it unpopular!

452
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Ha, ha, ha.

453
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,000
Oh well, if you'll excuse
me, Mrs Harper...

454
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
I have some studies.

455
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Of course. Goodnight.

456
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,300
Goodnight.

457
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,500
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

458
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Goodnight, Susan.

459
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:49,700
Goodnight, Shashie.

460
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,900
You can't really talk
to them, can you?

461
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
No sense of humour.

462
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,100
Don't be discouraged...

463
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,300
He's probably up there
laughing his head off.

464
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
Mmm...

465
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
chilly!

466
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Yes, well I think I'll, erm...

467
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,800
I'll bowl down the local and
have one with the lads.

468
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,900
Coming?

469
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
See you later, then.

470
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,100
Did you have to?

471
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
What?

472
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
Make him feel small?

473
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
He is small, Mum!

474
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
He's awful.

475
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,700
He is human, and
he pays.

476
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
He gets good value.

477
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,000
What do you mean
by that?

478
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Oh, Mum...

479
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Well come on, what?

480
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,300
Now look here, Susan...

481
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,500
you come home three
times a year...

482
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,700
and I tell you, I'm very glad of
a little company in this house.

483
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,900
Someone with a 
little life.

484
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,100
Alright, so he enjoys
a good laugh...

485
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
what's wrong with that?

486
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,400
Look, Mum... I don't give a damn
what he enjoys in this house,

487
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,600
or on the house, for
that matter.

488
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,800
The only thing on 
this house, my girl...

489
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,900
is your education.

490
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,100
I'd have sold this damn
barn of a place years ago...

491
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
if it hadn't been for that.

492
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,300
I know, Mum.

493
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
I'm sorry.

494
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Only one more year.

495
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,600
That's all.

496
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
Yeah... then what?

497
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,900
Forty, snotty-nosed little 
kids to look after.

498
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Big deal!

499
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,100
Hmm. Big enough.

500
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
And not for you.

501
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:30,400
With your face, and 
your figure...

502
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
you could be a model.

503
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,700
Ahh, now... look at that
Twiggy and The Shrimp.

504
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,900
More like a couple 
of growing boys...

505
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,100
and they made
a fortune!

506
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,300
Well I'm more like 
a growing girl...

507
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
so I couldn't, could I?

508
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,600
I think I'll take
these up with me.

509
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,800
You won't want to take books
to bed with you forever.

510
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,000
I was married when
I was your age.

511
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,200
I know. Was a 
love-match wasn't it.

512
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,300
'Til someone blew it out.

513
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,500
The only thing your father
ever blew were his chances.

514
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,700
He didn't have 
to go to Africa.

515
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,900
He had a fine
practice here.

516
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Well...

517
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,200
maybe he wanted something he
couldn't get on the National Health.

518
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Yeah... black women!

519
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,500
And he wasn't very much good
with white, I can tell you that.

520
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Oh Mum... be fair.

521
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,800
We both know why
he walked out.

522
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,000
If I had kicked your father
where he deserved...

523
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,200
he'd have never have
walked again!

524
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,400
Now, who on earth
can that be?

525
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
S'alright, I'll go.

526
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Yes?

527
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
Hello.

528
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Well... who do you want?

529
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,900
Susan, please.

530
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Who is it?

531
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,100
It's for you.

532
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
Georgie!

533
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
What's this?

534
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,500
Well you better come in.
You're soaked.

535
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Please.

536
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Are you Susan's Mummy?

537
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
Yes... yes, I am.

538
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Who are you?

539
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Oh, this is Georgie.

540
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
Err... Clifford.

541
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,400
Oh... oh, so you're
the flower man?

542
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,600
No, Mum. 
His father is.

543
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
Come here, Georgie.

544
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,900
Go in and sit by the fire
for a moment... will you?

545
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Get dry.

546
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,200
Now who is he? 
He looks a bit, erm...

547
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Simple. That's all.

548
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Here. Read this.

549
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
'Dear Susan Harper...'

550
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,700
'My son has told me 
of your kindness...'

551
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,600
'and I am glad to hear
that he can stay with you...'

552
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,700
'as a paying guest.'

553
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,900
'He has money and 
will be no trouble.'

554
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
'I shall be abroad for a week...'

555
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,200
'and hope to thank you 
in person on my return.'

556
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,400
'In the meantime, I am 
sending you some roses...'

557
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
'from Georgie and me.'

558
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
'Sincerely, James Clifford.'

559
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,800
'P.S. Bedtime 
nine-thirty, please.'

560
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,900
Whh..at?

561
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,100
What on earth are you thinking
of, he can't stay here!

562
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I never said he could!

563
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
Quick! Phone the hotel,
tell his father.

564
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Yes.

565
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,700
Well I... I'm sorry,
mister, erm...

566
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Georgie.

567
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,900
Georgie.

568
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Well I'm sorry, Georgie...

569
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,200
I'm afraid you can't
stay with us...

570
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,400
we've nowhere to
put you.

571
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
You're like Susan...

572
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
you're pretty.

573
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
Erm...

574
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,900
where's your father
gone, Georgie?

575
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh, do sit down.

576
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,200
Yes, that's right. 
Mr James Clifford.

577
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
I'll just make sure...

578
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,400
one moment, madam.

579
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Hello?

580
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,700
No madam, Mr Clifford
checked-out this morning.

581
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,900
Caught a plane
to Paris.

582
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
No, madam...

583
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,200
he never left 
an address.

584
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,400
Oh. I see. 
Thank you.

585
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
Gone.

586
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Oh, dear.

587
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,800
And I've just 
been telling Georgie...

588
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,000
we can't put him up,
there's no room.

589
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Where will you go?

590
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Georgie's alright.

591
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,400
We better 'phone
for a taxi.

592
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,600
You'll never get
one in this weather.

593
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,700
I... I can try.

594
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,900
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Georgie.

595
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I'm terribly sorry, Georgie...

596
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,200
but if only we'd 
known earlier...

597
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,400
we could have arranged
something.

598
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,600
And if only your father
had 'phoned yesterday...

599
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
or the day before...

600
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,800
I'm sure we could have
managed something, but...

601
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,000
but at this short notice,
absolutely impossible.

602
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,200
There isn't an empty
bed in the house.

603
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,400
Oh dear, just look
at that rain!

604
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,600
I really am so
terribly sorry.

605
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Goodbye.

606
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
Bye.

607
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,900
Mum, we can't!

608
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,100
Couldn't he have
my old room?

609
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm not getting lumbered.
Thank you very much!

610
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,500
But just for tonight,
couldn't he?

611
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,700
Are you out of 
your mind?

612
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
What sort of father...

613
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:09,900
sends a boy like that...

614
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,100
to a place like this, that
he hasn't even seen?!

615
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,300
Well, for all he knows this
could be a brothel!

616
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,500
Oh, please. He'll be
no trouble, Mum. Please.

617
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Oh, alright.

618
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,800
And if he wets the bed,
you wash the sheets!

619
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:25,900
Georgie!

620
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,900
Georgie!

621
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,900
Come on back!

622
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,100
We can't let you go
out in this weather.

623
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
Come on.

624
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,300
I'll take this.

625
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,500
Those cases must
be heavy.

626
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,700
Mum thinks we can
manage after all.

627
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,900
You're gonna have my old
room, right at the top.

628
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,100
It'll be in a bit of a
mess I expect.

629
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,300
But you won't mind
that, will you, Georgie?

630
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,400
Hang on a minute.

631
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Thank you.

632
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Sweet dreams.

633
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,700
Here we go.

634
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,900
You're supposed to be
in bed by now, aren't you?

635
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,100
Huh... you'll have to have
a hot bath first, though.

636
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
You're absolutely drenched!

637
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,400
Alright, Clarkie...
I heard you.

638
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
I was wondering... 

639
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,700
I've been beating this going
longer than J. Arthur Rank!

640
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Your breakfast's cold.

641
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Sorry.

642
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Good morning.

643
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,200
- Hello, Susan.
- Morning.

644
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,300
Hell, I'm late again!

645
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,500
Mr Groom's going to 
take the pants off me.

646
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,700
What time will 
that be, love?

647
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,900
For you, Mr Henderson?
A waste of time!

648
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Ahh, what a shame.

649
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,200
Did mother tell you
about our visitor?

650
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,300
Yes, she did.

651
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
A bit soft, she said.

652
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
No... like a little boy.

653
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,700
If you see him, Shashie, be
nice to him, will you?

654
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Yes, of course.

655
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,900
Oh, I must dash. Bye.

656
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Bye.

657
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,200
Time somebody was
nice to her!

658
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,400
She'll be begging for it
by the time she's forty.

659
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
Late tonight, Clarkie.

660
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Tell mum for me, will you?

661
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,800
I'll tell 'er you've 'ad
no breakfast!

662
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
Make sure you 'ave lunch.

663
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Bye.

664
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
Oh... so you're Georgie.

665
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,300
Go and get your
breakfast.

666
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Thank you.

667
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Good morning.

668
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Ah! Georgie!

669
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,800
Well, come on in, lad. Sit down.
We won't eat ya.

670
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm Gerry and this 
is the, err...

671
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,200
'The Professor'. 
Mr Kumar.

672
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Hello, Georgie.

673
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,500
He'll do the Indian Rope Trick
if you ask him nicely.

674
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
Tea of coffee, Georgie?

675
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
Tea, please.

676
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,800
Dad's in Paris, eh?

677
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Yes.

678
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,100
- Seeing the sights.
- Yes.

679
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
I'll bet he is!

680
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,400
Oh, come on... eat
your egg up, boy.

681
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
That's it.

682
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,700
Specially laid by
Donald Duck.

683
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Tea, Georgie.

684
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Thank you.

685
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,100
You like the movies,
do you?

686
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
What about Batman?

687
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,300
'Batman is a Fatman'!

688
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,500
Oh, who do you
like then?

689
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,700
- Tarzan.
- Oh, Tarzan! Whoh...

690
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,900
- Yaeeahheyaa!!
- Ha, ha, ha...

691
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,000
Alright... don't bust
a gut, mate!

692
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
Ha, ha, ha...

693
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,200
Well... err... yeah...

694
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,400
the Professor can tell
you all about Tarzan...

695
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,600
err, that's where he comes
from, the jungle.

696
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,800
Tarzan was the son of
an English Lord, Georgie.

697
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,000
- Was he?
- Mmm hmm.

698
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,200
Who else would want to
swing through trees...

699
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,400
with a bunch of
apes, hmm?

700
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Get out of it!

701
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,700
Well, I must be off
to the hospital.

702
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Bye, Georgie.

703
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,900
I'm off too.

704
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,100
- Burrrp!
- Ha, ha, ha...

705
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Blimey...

706
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
you'll be alright, lad.

707
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,500
You... you just 
keep laughing!

708
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,700
Oh, thank you. Can you
put them in the sink?

709
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,900
You don't have to do
that, you know?

710
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Georgie can wash up.

711
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
So I can see.

712
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Who taught you?

713
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
Mummy.

714
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Where is she, Georgie?

715
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,600
Have you stripped the
boy's bed, Clarkie?

716
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
It's been made.

717
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,800
I thought you done it.

718
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,900
Made?

719
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Room's a picture...

720
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,200
windows open, clothes
put away...

721
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,300
pyjamas under the pilla.

722
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,500
I wish the others were
as neat and tidy!

723
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Georgie!

724
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,800
I'm just going shopping...
will you be alright?

725
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,900
Goodnight.

726
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Goodnight, Georgie.

727
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
No reading in bed, mind.

728
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Georgie!

729
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,300
Still here?

730
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,500
- Yes... 'night, Susan.
- Goodnight.

731
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,700
- Hello, Mum.
- Hello, Darling.

732
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,800
I thought he was going?

733
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,900
Oh, how could we.

734
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You're quite right...

735
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,100
he'll be no trouble.

736
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
No trouble at all.

737
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,300
Henry, listen to this...

738
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,400
'Dear Mummy...'

739
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,500
'The flight was fine'

740
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
'and Paris is très belle'.

741
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
Thank you.

742
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,900
'But will not stay here as I have
decided to travel around a bit.'

743
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,100
'Will write again soon.
Love, Marty.'

744
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,300
'P.S. I will be thinking
of Dad on Friday,'

745
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,400
'when he speaks at 
the banker's dinner.'

746
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Nah... how about that!

747
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,700
'Wish him luck, he 
may need it!'.

748
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,800
Fancy remembering that.

749
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,000
- Yeah.
- In that sweet of him?

750
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Very. Very.

751
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,300
Well, I suppose I better
learn the damn thing!

752
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,500
- More coffee, Darling?
- Yes, please.

753
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,600
'Your Royal Highness...'

754
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,700
'My Lord, My Lord Mayor...'

755
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,800
Young man...

756
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,000
the library has been closed
for the last ten minutes.

757
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,200
- I know.
- Well then...

758
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
Rat face.

759
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
Eh... what was that?!

760
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,500
Get lost!

761
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,600
- Goodnight, Mr Groom.
- I...

762
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Bye, bye.

763
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,900
Think he's taken a
liking to you.

764
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Yes. He has.

765
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,200
I got you that 
book on Paris.

766
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,300
Hi... sexpot!

767
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Philip!

768
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,600
I was gonna 'phone
you this evening.

769
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,800
Then I saved you the
money. Jump in.

770
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:38,900
Why, what's on?

771
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,100
Come on, don't 
waste time.

772
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,300
Judy and Mac 
are waiting.

773
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,500
- What for?
- Us.

774
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Why?

775
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,800
They want to talk
about tomorrow.

776
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,900
So long, buster.

777
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh, Georgie...

778
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,100
I <i>am</i> sorry.

779
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Here, take this.

780
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
See you later.

781
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,500
What did I understand you
to say to me in there?

782
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
I said... 

783
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:02,800
- get... stuffed!
- Huh!

784
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Who's the pretty boy?

785
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,100
Yes he is rather, 
isn't he?

786
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
Fancy him?

787
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,300
Ha, ha!

788
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,500
This is the centre
of Paris, Georgie.

789
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,700
I expect your father...

790
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,900
would be staying in one of
these hotels around here.

791
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Look, Georgie...

792
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,200
here's the 
Champs-Elysées.

793
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,400
And there's the
Arc de Triomphe.

794
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,600
They built that after Napoleon
won all those battles.

795
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:34,700
And at the other end...

796
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,900
is the Place de 
la Concorde...

797
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,100
and, err,
over here...

798
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,300
where is it?
Oh yes...

799
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,500
here, in Les Invalides...
is where they buried him.

800
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,700
- Georgie...
- Yes, Mummy?

801
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
Nine-thirty, Georgie.

802
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,900
Bedtime.

803
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Oh.

804
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,200
And I'm gonna make
a cup of chocolate.

805
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,300
For me?

806
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,500
- If you want one.
- In bed?

807
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,700
Ha, ha! You're getting 
spoiled, aren't you?

808
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Goodnight.

809
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,000
Thought you might
like a cuppa.

810
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,100
Mmm, I would.

811
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,300
Medicine can be
rather dry stuff.

812
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,400
There you are then.

813
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,500
Thank you.

814
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
What's that?

815
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:55,700
I was just wondering.

816
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,900
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

817
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh, it's you!

818
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100
Having a race?

819
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Winning?

820
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Georgie always wins!

821
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,500
Good. Then come and
get your prize.

822
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,700
Now I lay me
down to sleep...

823
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,900
and pray the Lord
my soul to keep.

824
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,100
And if I die before 
I w... wake...

825
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I... 

826
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,400
Pray the Lord 
my soul to take.

827
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Amen!

828
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
Don't spill it, will you?

829
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
Sweet dreams.

830
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,900
<i> Hello, good evening,
from Manchester... </i>

831
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,100
<i> let's take a quick look
at some of the couples... </i>

832
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,300
<i> who'll be dancing 
in this contest tonight... </i>

833
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,500
<i> between the North 
and the South.</i>

834
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,700
<i> And first of all here, 
couple number four... </i>

835
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,900
<i> the very popular
Martin Charles... </i>

836
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,100
<i> and his lovely 
partner Barbara. </i>

837
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,300
<i> Now these two, they
were runners up last year... </i>

838
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,500
<i> so they must stand
a very good chance this time. </i>

839
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,700
<i> And that magnificent dress
that Barbara's wearing</i>

840
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,900
<i>(there's seventeen yards of
tulle in it, she tells me)</i>

841
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,100
<i> it's a combined effort of
Barbara and her Mum.</i>

842
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,300
<i>And I gather that Mum </i>
<i>sat up all night...</i>

843
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,500
<i>sewing on those hundreds </i>
<i>of sequins...</i>

844
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,700
<i>which set off the </i>
<i>whole ensemble.</i>

845
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,900
<i>Really quite something, I </i>
<i>think you'll agree.</i>

846
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,100
<i>Now then, let's watch </i>
<i>them for a moment...</i>

847
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,300
<i>as the contest opens </i>
<i>with... the waltz.</i>

848
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Susan!

849
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,600
It's Philip... quickly, 
he's in a call box.

850
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Damn!

851
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,800
Coming!

852
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,000
Bloody good speech H.D.
Never heard better!

853
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:11,200
Did you see the
Royal's face...

854
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,400
when I told the one about
the pony and the polo stick?

855
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,500
Did I? Everyone did!

856
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,700
Do you know
where I got it?

857
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,800
No?

858
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
My secretary.

859
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Miss Pym?

860
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,100
Yes!

861
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
Sixty, if she's a day.

862
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,300
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

863
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,400
How about that!

864
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,600
Here... here don't worry,
drop me at your place...

865
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:26,800
I can walk around
the corner.

866
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,000
- Sure?
- Quite.

867
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,200
Could do with a
spot of fresh air.

868
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,300
Right.

869
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,500
Thanks for the lift, H.D.
Great evening!

870
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,900
- Thanks again for the speech.
- Night, Tom.

871
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,900
- Goodnight.
- See you tomorrow.

872
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,100
Yes.

873
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,100
Hello, who's that?

874
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,100
Who <i>is</i> that?

875
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,100
That you, Johnson?

876
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,200
Guess again.

877
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,400
Oh, Martin. 
You're back.

878
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:52,600
Well, what's happened...
you in trouble again?

879
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:53,700
<i>I'm</i> not.

880
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,900
Look, take that damn thing
out of my eyes, will you.

881
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,100
Here show me
the light switch.

882
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
Sure.

883
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,400
You are in trouble,
aren't you?

884
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,600
Come on, let's 
get indoors.

885
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,800
Thought it was too
good to be true.

886
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,900
Hey! Dad!

887
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Errrghh! 

888
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:09,100
Ugh!

889
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,200
Argh!

890
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,300
Uh!

891
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Err! 

892
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,400
Ahh...

893
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
Uhh!

894
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
And how about... 

895
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:48,700
that!

896
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,700
He, he, he...

897
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,900
01773268, Private
Henderson, Sir!

898
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,100
Alright girly...
I'm back.

899
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,200
Ready and willing.

900
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,300
Just hope I'm able.

901
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,300
You're late.

902
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,300
Please...

903
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,300
Hmm?

904
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,400
Gerry?

905
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,500
Who is it?!

906
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,600
Georgie!

907
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,700
What are you doing here?

908
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:30,800
Whad'ya want?

909
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,900
Bad men!

910
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,100
They bury Georgie
in the sand.

911
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,200
Couldn't breath!

912
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,300
It's alright.

913
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,500
It's alright, Georgie. 
It's only a dream.

914
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:44,600
Quite safe now.

915
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,700
Mummy...

916
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,800
Georgie, you're burning!

917
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,900
Here...

918
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
You'll catch cold.

919
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Lie still for a moment.

920
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,300
- Mmm...
- It's alright, it's alright...

921
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Just lie still.

922
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Joan?

923
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Joan?!

924
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:32,700
Allo...

925
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:34,800
what's cooking?

926
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:46,000
Spot of the 
dark meat, eh?

927
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,100
Joan!

928
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Now then, Sue...

929
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,400
no hanky-panky in
the back seat!

930
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:18,600
You needn't worry, I shall
be in the front seat.

931
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,800
Well watch out for his hand
when he changes gear, then!

932
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,000
- Hi
- Ha, ha, ha.

933
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,100
Jump in.

934
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,300
Ah, good morning,
Mr Henderson.

935
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,400
Morning.

936
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,600
Most marvellous day,
is it not?

937
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,700
Yeah.

938
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,900
The night wasn't so
dusty either, was it?

939
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
The night?

940
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,100
What happened?

941
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Eh?!

942
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:04,300
What happened?

943
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,500
Transcendental Meditation,
was it?

944
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:09,600
A little Yogi Pogi?

945
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:14,000
Or were you practicing all those
Oriental, spiritual exercises...

946
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,100
cross-legged on the floor?

947
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,200
Or 'somewhere'?!

948
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,400
Have you got her
on pot yet?

949
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,500
Pot?

950
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,700
Well, I'm sorry, I 
don't think I understand.

951
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,900
You're a dark 
one, you are.

952
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,100
Meaning what, 
Mr Henderson?

953
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,300
Oh... no offence, 
no offence.

954
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,500
No, no, I must say,
you had me fooled.

955
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:38,700
So you're getting a cut
off the joint as well, are you?

956
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Cut off the joint?!

957
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:43,000
Come off it... from 'Lady
Bountiful' here.

958
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,200
Oh, Mr Henderson... I begin
to see what's on your mind!

959
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,400
It's not very gracious to
the lady concerned.

960
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,600
In any case, were 
she like that...

961
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,800
I would like to
remind you that...

962
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:55,000
we Hindu's are forbidden
to eat cow.

963
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,200
Yours is just coming up
Mr Henderson.

964
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,300
Alright, love.

965
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,500
Mrs Harper's doing something
special for you son...

966
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,600
so sit down.

967
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:07,800
I wouldn't read that
if I was you.

968
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,000
Won't want to touch a
thing after that. Horrible!

969
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,200
Oh! Banker brutally
murdered.

970
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:17,400
'Henry Durnley found
stabbed'.

971
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,500
'Multiple stomach wounds'.

972
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Banker, eh?

973
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,800
Well, that's closed
his account!

974
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,000
There's none of us safe these
days, if you ask me.

975
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,200
Not since they give
up hanging.

976
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,400
No, and we won't be
'til they bring it back either.

977
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,500
You mark my words!

978
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,700
Mind you, they say he might
be one of these...

979
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,800
oh, what do ya call 'em...

980
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,900
'Psychopratts'.

981
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
'Psychopaths', Mrs Clark?

982
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,100
That's it!

983
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,300
I don't give a damn what
his religion is... I'd top 'im!

984
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,500
But if he is a psychopath,
he's a very sick man.

985
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Who says so?

986
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,700
I'll tell you something...

987
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,900
tha... that's an argument
that makes <i>me</i> sick!

988
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
What about... this, err...

989
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,200
Durnley chap. What about
feeling sorry for him then, eh?!

990
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,400
Look, of course I 
feel sorry for him...

991
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,600
it's easy when 
a man's dead.

992
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:02,800
It's easy when a man's blind
or deaf, or lost a limb.

993
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:03,900
You can see it.

994
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,100
But how about a man who
can feeling nothing for anyone...

995
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,200
except for himself?

996
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,400
Who doesn't know 
what love is...

997
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,600
or pity, who has
no conscience.

998
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,800
Who's only feeling is
of rage, when frustrated.

999
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,000
And only fun, destroying
those who frustrate him.

1000
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,200
Now, it's hard to feel
sorry for him, isn't it?

1001
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:23,400
- Oh, dear.
- Yet, he is really sick...

1002
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,500
he's diseased.

1003
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,700
And there very few
of us who can help him.

1004
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,800
Sphericals!

1005
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:34,000
If he's off his trolley, 
I still say 'top 'im'!

1006
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:37,200
Here we are. Morning
everyone.

1007
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:38,400
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1008
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,500
Morning.

1009
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,700
- Here you are, Georgie.
- Thanks.

1010
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,900
Eat it all up now, it'll
make you strong.

1011
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Fresh toast, Shashie?

1012
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,100
Most kind, Mrs Harper.

1013
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,200
Oh, Georgie...

1014
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,400
I'll be ready in 
about an hour.

1015
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Ok.

1016
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,500
Hey...!

1017
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,700
You're not so backward,
are you, son?

1018
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,800
Pardon?

1019
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,900
So you've got two then?

1020
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Two what?

1021
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,100
Eggs, of course.

1022
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,200
Oh, yes.

1023
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,400
- Sleep well last night?
- Mmm.

1024
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,500
Yeah. I bet you did!

1025
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Where's Susan gone to?

1026
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,700
Gawd... blimey!

1027
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,900
You're a bit of a 
glutton, aren't you, son?!

1028
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,100
You'll be asking for
old Clarkie next.

1029
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,200
When's it gonna
be her turn?!

1030
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:07,400
- I see...
- Oh. Sorry.

1031
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,500
I...

1032
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,700
Going in for bodybuilding
now then, are you?

1033
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,800
Hmm?

1034
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Building up his strength?

1035
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Oh.

1036
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,100
Yeah.

1037
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Huh!

1038
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,400
Making quite a fuss
of him, aren't you?

1039
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:33,500
Well, why not?

1040
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,600
Bit strong, isn't it?

1041
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:37,700
What is?

1042
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,800
With a half-wit!?

1043
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,000
Your jokes are getting 
a bit stale, Gerry.

1044
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,200
And... everything else
as well. Is that it?

1045
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,500
Well, now you come
to mention it.

1046
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,700
Oh look here, Gerry. I think
you better leave.

1047
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,800
What?

1048
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:58,900
Shall we say a week?

1049
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,100
You can say what you
bloody well like!

1050
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,300
What does it mean 
'top him'?

1051
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,400
Oh.

1052
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,600
It's an old... British 
remedy, Georgie.

1053
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,800
Admired by those who 
find it... easier to kill...

1054
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,900
than to... cure.

1055
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,100
Right, lets get some
light on it.

1056
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,200
Yes...

1057
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,300
that's about it.

1058
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,500
How 'bout the 
footprints, Tom?

1059
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,700
Rubber soles. Eight and
a half.

1060
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:51,900
His missus says this door's
always kept locked.

1061
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,100
So looks as though who
ever it was...

1062
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,300
was waiting for him
over there.

1063
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,400
That lock been forced?

1064
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,500
No, Sir.

1065
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,700
Oh no, here comes
the brain drain!

1066
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:07,800
Stay where you are, you.

1067
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:13,000
- Morning, Taffy.
- Morning, Superintendent.

1068
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:14,100
Brought your crystal ball?

1069
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,200
What do you see?

1070
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,300
Well, Sir...

1071
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,500
deceased died of multiple injuries
inflicted by a sharp instrument.

1072
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,700
Time, approximately
midnight.

1073
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:23,800
Contents of stomach...

1074
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,000
oysters, white fish, possibly
halibut...

1075
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,100
Yes, I don't want 
the menu...

1076
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,300
just give me the
weapon.

1077
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,500
The walls of the
lower abdomen...

1078
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,700
have been punctured
three times to a depth...

1079
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,800
I said weapon!

1080
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,900
Scissors.

1081
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Tell you what...

1082
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,200
double or quits this
isn't a pro job. You on?

1083
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,300
I'm getting old, Super...

1084
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,400
saving for retirement.

1085
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,500
That raincoat... anything?

1086
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,600
Oh yes, Sir...

1087
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,700
plastic, new, large size...

1088
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,800
mass produced, colour grey...

1089
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,900
Yes, I'm not colour-blind.

1090
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,100
Blood stains, group 'O',
rhesus-positive...

1091
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,200
identical with deceased.

1092
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,400
- That the lot, Taffy?
- Yes, Sir.

1093
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,600
And I left my brains
on the beat!

1094
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,800
What have you 
fellows got?

1095
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:13,000
Electromagnifiers, computers,
memory banks...

1096
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:15,600
ultraviolet, supersonic
microwave machines.

1097
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,100
They buy you a half-million
pound lab and stick you in it...

1098
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,400
with a bunch of birds wearing
skirts just long enough...

1099
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,500
to cover their parking meters...

1100
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,700
and what do you
come up with?

1101
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,900
No more than my nipper could 
'ave told me the day he was...

1102
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,100
old enough to raise his...

1103
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,200
truncheon!

1104
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,300
Give me that!

1105
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,500
And get on your feet, that man,
whad'ya think you are...

1106
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,599
the sleeping bloody beauty!

1107
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:41,699
Yes?

1108
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:48,899
Sorry to trouble you again.
Doctor, do you mind?

1109
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:51,099
I'd like Mrs Durnley to
get some sleep.

1110
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,099
What is it?

1111
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:54,199
It's this raincoat, Ma'am.

1112
01:04:55,299 --> 01:04:56,299
Ever seen it before?

1113
01:04:58,399 --> 01:04:59,399
No.

1114
01:05:00,499 --> 01:05:01,499
You're quite sure?

1115
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:03,499
Yeah.

1116
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:04,699
Oh, there was just
one other thing.

1117
01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:07,899
Does anyone else have
keys to the garage?

1118
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:09,999
Thompson.

1119
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:12,099
My son, Martin.

1120
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,199
Myself.

1121
01:05:13,299 --> 01:05:16,299
Thompson, Ma'am... staff?

1122
01:05:16,399 --> 01:05:17,399
No, from the mews...

1123
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:20,499
he washes the cars.

1124
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:21,599
I see.

1125
01:05:21,699 --> 01:05:23,699
And your son?

1126
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:26,799
He's away.

1127
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:28,999
Perhaps you chaps
could help us there?

1128
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:30,199
He's in France, 
somewhere.

1129
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:32,299
Should be here
with his mother.

1130
01:05:32,399 --> 01:05:33,499
Well hasn't anyone
heard from him?

1131
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:34,599
Oh, yes.

1132
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,799
We had a sweet
letter from him.

1133
01:05:42,899 --> 01:05:43,999
Made his father 
so happy.

1134
01:05:44,099 --> 01:05:45,099
Mmm.

1135
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:47,299
He doesn't say where
he's going, eh?

1136
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:51,499
Well, we'll have to see
what we can do.

1137
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,699
I'll leave you to rest
now, Mrs Durnley.

1138
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:54,799
Thank you, Doctor.

1139
01:05:59,899 --> 01:06:01,999
- Superintendent...
- Ma'am?

1140
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:07,199
If... if nothing was 
was stolen...

1141
01:06:07,299 --> 01:06:09,299
no money taken...

1142
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:10,399
why?

1143
01:06:11,499 --> 01:06:12,499
Why?!

1144
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,699
Well that's what we
hope to find out, Ma'am.

1145
01:06:23,799 --> 01:06:25,899
...see the wife's mother.
Her night off.

1146
01:06:25,999 --> 01:06:26,999
I see.

1147
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:30,199
What was he like,
your boss?

1148
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:31,299
Alright.

1149
01:06:31,399 --> 01:06:32,499
No frills.
One of us, really.

1150
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:34,699
Sounds like my boss, he's
got no frills.

1151
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,799
No bleedin' heart either.

1152
01:06:36,899 --> 01:06:38,999
It's first time I've been off
my feet all week!

1153
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:40,099
On duty, Sergeant Rogers?

1154
01:06:40,199 --> 01:06:41,199
Err... yes, Sir.

1155
01:06:41,299 --> 01:06:42,299
So I see.

1156
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:46,399
Let's 'ave it.

1157
01:06:56,499 --> 01:06:58,599
- You made this?
- My wife, Sir.

1158
01:06:58,699 --> 01:07:00,799
Well you wanna look 
after her...

1159
01:07:00,899 --> 01:07:01,899
it's a good cuppa.

1160
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,099
That young Durnley?
Yes, Sir.

1161
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:16,199
A nice looking lad.

1162
01:07:16,299 --> 01:07:17,299
Yes, Sir.

1163
01:07:17,399 --> 01:07:19,499
This is gonna come as
quite a blow to him.

1164
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:21,599
Yes, Sir?

1165
01:07:21,699 --> 01:07:22,699
Well, won't it?

1166
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:25,799
Yes, Sir.

1167
01:07:30,899 --> 01:07:32,899
He, he, he.

1168
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:35,099
Young Mr Martin's
parting gift.

1169
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:36,199
What this?

1170
01:07:37,299 --> 01:07:39,399
Quite a joker, 
that lad.

1171
01:07:39,399 --> 01:07:41,499
Oh... great sense 
of humour.

1172
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:42,699
For those who 
understand it.

1173
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:45,899
Oh quick, that man... get
him back for me, will you?

1174
01:07:45,999 --> 01:07:46,999
Yes, Sir.

1175
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:03,099
Err... yes, Sir?

1176
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:06,199
Ahh... Rogers...

1177
01:08:07,299 --> 01:08:09,399
You're doing a fine job!
Finish your tea.

1178
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:23,499
Hey!

1179
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:24,599
Come on!

1180
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:57,699
Sue...

1181
01:08:57,799 --> 01:08:58,799
Let's blow.

1182
01:08:59,899 --> 01:09:00,899
Where to?

1183
01:09:00,999 --> 01:09:01,999
I'm easy. Your room?

1184
01:09:03,099 --> 01:09:05,099
Don't be a drag, Philip!

1185
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:07,199
My place then?

1186
01:09:08,299 --> 01:09:09,299
Why not?

1187
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:10,399
Don't want.

1188
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:12,499
You've never tried.

1189
01:09:12,599 --> 01:09:14,599
Philip, you're stoned!

1190
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:15,699
Put me to bed, then.

1191
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:16,799
Look...

1192
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:18,999
you can sleep it off, 
or have it off...

1193
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:20,099
but not with me!

1194
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,199
Night, Susan.

1195
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:46,299
You bloody idiot you!

1196
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:54,499
God, it's a complete
right-off!

1197
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:56,699
What the hell were
you up to?!

1198
01:09:56,799 --> 01:09:57,799
I saw that...

1199
01:09:57,899 --> 01:09:59,999
bastard did it
on purpose!

1200
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:01,099
What?!

1201
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,299
I ought to... stuff this
down your bloody throat!

1202
01:10:03,399 --> 01:10:04,399
Philip!

1203
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:06,499
Stop it!

1204
01:10:06,599 --> 01:10:08,599
It's alright, Georgie.

1205
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:09,699
Couldn't be helped.

1206
01:10:09,799 --> 01:10:10,799
You get off to bed.

1207
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:13,899
That's it.

1208
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:16,999
Goodnight.

1209
01:10:19,099 --> 01:10:20,099
Couldn't be helped?!

1210
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:22,299
You heard what
Mac said.

1211
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:23,399
Mac could be mistaken.

1212
01:10:26,499 --> 01:10:27,499
Well...

1213
01:10:27,599 --> 01:10:28,599
it's been a long day.

1214
01:10:29,699 --> 01:10:30,699
Party's over.

1215
01:10:30,799 --> 01:10:31,799
Party?

1216
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:32,899
There you are, Philip...

1217
01:10:32,999 --> 01:10:33,999
send me the bill.

1218
01:10:34,099 --> 01:10:36,099
Mac, you'd better drive.

1219
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:39,199
Ok.

1220
01:10:40,299 --> 01:10:41,299
Come on, Judy.

1221
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:44,499
Thanks a lot.
Goodnight.

1222
01:10:51,599 --> 01:10:54,699
Well err... see you
tomorrow then?

1223
01:10:54,799 --> 01:10:55,799
No.

1224
01:10:55,899 --> 01:10:56,999
But we're going
swimming.

1225
01:10:57,099 --> 01:10:58,099
<i>I</i> am.

1226
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:01,199
Got you.

1227
01:11:02,299 --> 01:11:04,399
So, when do I see
you again then?

1228
01:11:04,499 --> 01:11:06,499
Next term. Perhaps.

1229
01:11:06,599 --> 01:11:08,699
If you're carrying
field glasses.

1230
01:11:13,799 --> 01:11:15,899
They're waiting for
you, Philip.

1231
01:11:16,999 --> 01:11:18,999
Oh... alright!

1232
01:11:20,099 --> 01:11:23,199
And thanks...
for nothing!

1233
01:11:39,299 --> 01:11:40,299
Come on, Georgie!

1234
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:46,399
Oh, it's freezing!

1235
01:11:57,499 --> 01:11:58,499
I've had enough.

1236
01:11:58,599 --> 01:11:59,599
Race you back.

1237
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:02,699
One, two, three... go!

1238
01:12:08,799 --> 01:12:09,699
Susan!

1239
01:12:10,799 --> 01:12:11,699
Help!

1240
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:14,699
Help!!

1241
01:12:17,799 --> 01:12:18,699
Help!!!

1242
01:12:26,799 --> 01:12:27,699
Oh!

1243
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:39,699
Oh!

1244
01:12:39,799 --> 01:12:41,799
Ever been had!?

1245
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:44,999
Oh... you cheat!

1246
01:13:01,099 --> 01:13:02,099
Let me get you...

1247
01:13:04,199 --> 01:13:07,199
Oh, I nearly died of fright.

1248
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,299
Oh, it's cold!

1249
01:13:09,399 --> 01:13:11,499
Here, dry yourself. Get
dressed. Quickly.

1250
01:13:12,599 --> 01:13:15,599
Arraeeahheyaa!!

1251
01:13:24,699 --> 01:13:26,699
Like it here?

1252
01:13:26,799 --> 01:13:28,899
- Super!
- Yes.

1253
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:32,099
Dad and I used to come here
quite a lot in the old days.

1254
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,199
Georgie!

1255
01:14:06,299 --> 01:14:09,399
You'll get us locked-up,
Georgie.

1256
01:14:09,499 --> 01:14:11,599
I'd better get 
decent too.

1257
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:14,799
- No one's here.
- But I am!

1258
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:23,999
Any brothers or 
sisters, Georgie?

1259
01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:25,099
A brother.

1260
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,199
Pete.

1261
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:27,299
Where's he?

1262
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:28,399
Australia.

1263
01:14:28,499 --> 01:14:30,499
On a sheep farm.

1264
01:14:30,599 --> 01:14:31,599
He's the boss.

1265
01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:33,699
Does he look like you?

1266
01:14:33,799 --> 01:14:34,799
Girls like him.

1267
01:14:34,899 --> 01:14:36,899
He's big. Strong.

1268
01:14:36,999 --> 01:14:37,999
Plays the guitar too.

1269
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:40,199
Sounds quite
a swinger.

1270
01:14:42,299 --> 01:14:44,399
I'd like to meet 
your brother Pete.

1271
01:14:45,499 --> 01:14:46,499
Yes.

1272
01:14:47,599 --> 01:14:48,599
He'd marry you.

1273
01:15:43,699 --> 01:15:44,699
Huh!

1274
01:15:46,799 --> 01:15:47,799
Oh, Georgie!

1275
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:50,899
Oh, Georgie...

1276
01:15:50,999 --> 01:15:51,999
how lovely!

1277
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:53,099
Thank you.

1278
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,199
How sweet of you.

1279
01:16:00,299 --> 01:16:01,299
Georgie!

1280
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:18,499
Don't you ever
do that again!

1281
01:16:18,599 --> 01:16:20,599
...lay back upper two,
lay back...

1282
01:16:20,599 --> 01:16:24,699
...drop your wrists four. 
You're late. That's better.

1283
01:16:24,799 --> 01:16:28,799
One step, two step, three step...

1284
01:16:28,899 --> 01:16:33,899
four step, five step, six step...

1285
01:16:35,999 --> 01:16:37,999
Sorry, Susan.

1286
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,099
Let's forget it, Georgie.

1287
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:45,299
I dare say it was
my fault, really.

1288
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:50,499
I'll get these things
packed up.

1289
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:01,699
Well come on, take hold
of the other end.

1290
01:17:02,799 --> 01:17:03,799
Any cigarettes?

1291
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:05,999
You're just putting
one out.

1292
01:17:07,099 --> 01:17:08,099
Alright.

1293
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:12,299
What's the matter with
you this morning...

1294
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:13,499
you're as jumpy as
a kitten?

1295
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:14,599
Nothing.

1296
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:17,799
You know, when
Gerry leaves...

1297
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,999
I think I'll 
move Georgie.

1298
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:21,199
- Mum!
- Mmm?

1299
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:23,399
I think it's time
Georgie went too.

1300
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:25,499
Why?

1301
01:17:26,599 --> 01:17:29,699
Because it's too great
a responsibility.

1302
01:17:29,799 --> 01:17:30,799
Oh, what is?

1303
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:33,999
Thinking we could cope.
We don't know enough.

1304
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:35,199
Well there's nothing
<i>to</i> know.

1305
01:17:35,299 --> 01:17:37,299
He's just a child.

1306
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:39,499
He may talk 
like a child...

1307
01:17:39,599 --> 01:17:41,699
but look at him, Mum.
Look at him!

1308
01:17:41,799 --> 01:17:42,799
I have.

1309
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:43,899
But he's a man!

1310
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:47,099
As a matter of fact, he slept
down here the other night.

1311
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:51,199
He what?!

1312
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,299
Like a child.

1313
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:54,399
Hadn't you heard?

1314
01:17:55,499 --> 01:17:56,499
Oh...

1315
01:17:56,599 --> 01:17:58,699
so that's what Gerry
was sniggering about!

1316
01:17:58,799 --> 01:17:59,799
He had a nightmare.

1317
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:00,899
He was frightened.

1318
01:18:00,999 --> 01:18:01,999
He wanted his mum.

1319
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:04,099
Nothing else.

1320
01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:07,299
Could have been
your father!

1321
01:18:09,399 --> 01:18:12,599
There's an awful lot of waste
in this world, isn't there?

1322
01:18:13,699 --> 01:18:15,799
There's an awful lot
to understand.

1323
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:17,899
Mrs 'arper!

1324
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:18,999
Yes, Clarkie?

1325
01:18:19,099 --> 01:18:21,199
It's for Georgie,
from Paris.

1326
01:18:21,299 --> 01:18:23,399
Well that'll be
his father.

1327
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:24,499
Shall I take it?

1328
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:25,699
No it's alright, 
I'm going down...

1329
01:18:25,799 --> 01:18:27,999
Oh do the boy's bedroom will you
Darling, it's Clarkie's half-day.

1330
01:18:28,099 --> 01:18:29,099
Mmm... ok.

1331
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:33,199
Hello?

1332
01:18:34,299 --> 01:18:37,399
No I'm sorry, Georgie's
out at the moment.

1333
01:18:37,499 --> 01:18:38,499
Is that his father?

1334
01:18:39,599 --> 01:18:41,599
Oh... hello, Mr Clifford!

1335
01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:43,799
No, no, this is
Mrs Harper.

1336
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:46,999
We were beginning to
think you didn't exist!

1337
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:49,199
Yes, yes, Georgie's
very well...

1338
01:18:49,299 --> 01:18:51,399
we've all grown very
fond of him.

1339
01:18:51,499 --> 01:18:54,599
Oh, that's very nice of 
you to say so, thank you.

1340
01:18:55,699 --> 01:18:57,799
I'm sorry, I didn't 
quite catch that...

1341
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:58,899
would you repeat it?

1342
01:18:59,999 --> 01:19:02,099
I said my work's 
almost finished...

1343
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:04,299
and I'd like Georgie
to join me.

1344
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:08,499
It's time he had
a holiday.

1345
01:20:47,599 --> 01:20:49,699
That <i>was</i> his father
on the 'phone.

1346
01:20:49,799 --> 01:20:50,899
You needn't
have worried...

1347
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:53,099
he won't be here
much longer.

1348
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,199
Good.

1349
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:56,399
Yes, I thought
you'd say that.

1350
01:20:56,499 --> 01:20:57,499
This the lad's?

1351
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:58,599
Yes, Clarkie.

1352
01:20:58,699 --> 01:20:59,799
- Mum...
- Mmm...

1353
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:01,999
Has Georgie every mentioned 
anyone named Durnley?

1354
01:21:02,099 --> 01:21:03,099
Who?

1355
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,199
Martin Durnley.

1356
01:21:04,299 --> 01:21:06,299
No, why?

1357
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:07,499
That was that man's 
name, wasn't it?

1358
01:21:07,599 --> 01:21:08,599
Durnley?

1359
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:10,699
You know...

1360
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:13,899
one they said was done it
in by a psychopratt.

1361
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:26,099
Now don't you go pulling
out all them old papers...

1362
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:28,299
I want them for
me fires.

1363
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:30,499
It's all they're fit for,
most of 'em.

1364
01:21:37,599 --> 01:21:39,699
What <i>are</i> you
looking for?

1365
01:21:39,799 --> 01:21:41,899
Just something I
remember reading.

1366
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:56,099
- Mum.
- Mmm?

1367
01:21:56,199 --> 01:21:58,299
I'm going into
London.

1368
01:21:58,399 --> 01:21:59,399
London?

1369
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:01,599
But you haven't
got time.

1370
01:22:02,699 --> 01:22:04,799
But hey, what about
the library...

1371
01:22:04,899 --> 01:22:06,999
you're supposed to
be there at one!

1372
01:22:07,099 --> 01:22:09,199
Yes, I remember the
incident very clearly.

1373
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:10,399
I'm sure we did
take his name...

1374
01:22:10,499 --> 01:22:11,599
we always do
you know.

1375
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:14,799
Should be in 
here somewhere.

1376
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:16,899
Let me see.

1377
01:22:19,999 --> 01:22:22,099
Yes, I thought so.
Here we are.

1378
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,199
Oh, do come in.

1379
01:22:25,299 --> 01:22:27,299
That chair, nurse.

1380
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:29,399
Susan, isn't it?

1381
01:22:29,499 --> 01:22:30,499
That's right.

1382
01:22:30,599 --> 01:22:31,599
Please sit down.

1383
01:22:32,699 --> 01:22:33,699
Thank you.

1384
01:22:38,799 --> 01:22:41,899
Mrs Durnley, I came to talk
to you about Georgie.

1385
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:42,999
Georgie?

1386
01:22:43,099 --> 01:22:45,199
Isn't he sometimes
called 'Georgie'?

1387
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,299
Who is?

1388
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:48,399
Your son.

1389
01:22:49,499 --> 01:22:50,499
My son's name is Martin.

1390
01:22:51,599 --> 01:22:52,599
Oh. Is he here?

1391
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:53,699
No, he's away.

1392
01:22:54,799 --> 01:22:55,799
Do you know where?

1393
01:22:56,899 --> 01:22:57,899
Naturally.

1394
01:22:58,999 --> 01:23:01,099
Somewhere I could
'phone him?

1395
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:02,199
It's rather difficult.

1396
01:23:02,299 --> 01:23:04,399
It's very important
to me.

1397
01:23:07,499 --> 01:23:08,499
He's in France.

1398
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:10,599
France?

1399
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:11,699
Travelling.

1400
01:23:11,799 --> 01:23:13,899
Mrs Durnley, you're quite
sure of that?

1401
01:23:13,999 --> 01:23:16,099
Yes of course 
I'm sure.

1402
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:18,199
Hello, Georgie.

1403
01:23:22,299 --> 01:23:23,299
Where's Susan?

1404
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:24,399
Out.

1405
01:23:25,499 --> 01:23:26,499
Oh.

1406
01:23:29,599 --> 01:23:30,699
You want to make 
yourself useful...

1407
01:23:30,799 --> 01:23:34,899
I need some more firewood,
there's a good boy.

1408
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,099
Look, what is all 
this about?

1409
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:02,199
You seem very anxious.

1410
01:24:02,299 --> 01:24:03,299
I am.

1411
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:06,499
Well then, hadn't you better
come out with it?

1412
01:24:06,599 --> 01:24:08,599
Well, I'm not sure.

1413
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:11,799
Not absolutely sure 
that I can, yet.

1414
01:24:15,899 --> 01:24:18,999
Miss Harper, you're not in 
some sort of trouble, are you?

1415
01:24:19,099 --> 01:24:20,099
Trouble?

1416
01:24:20,199 --> 01:24:22,299
Well if you are, you must
be quite frank about it.

1417
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:23,499
You wouldn't be
the first girl that...

1418
01:24:23,599 --> 01:24:24,599
Oh no...

1419
01:24:24,699 --> 01:24:26,799
at least, not in
that way.

1420
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:28,999
Then what <i>are</i> 
you here for?

1421
01:24:29,099 --> 01:24:31,099
Mrs Durnley...

1422
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,299
I don't quite know how
to say this, but...

1423
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:35,399
I have to ask...

1424
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:37,599
Is your son handicapped
in any way?

1425
01:24:37,699 --> 01:24:38,699
What do you mean?!

1426
01:24:38,799 --> 01:24:39,799
Forgive me but...

1427
01:24:39,899 --> 01:24:42,999
Is Martin... mentally
backward?

1428
01:24:43,099 --> 01:24:44,099
Retarded?

1429
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:46,199
Martin, retarded?!

1430
01:24:46,299 --> 01:24:48,299
Certainly not!

1431
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:50,499
He's a perfectly normal,
healthy boy!

1432
01:24:51,599 --> 01:24:52,699
I don't know what your
little game is...

1433
01:24:52,799 --> 01:24:54,899
or what you hope to
get out of this,

1434
01:24:54,999 --> 01:24:57,099
but I certainly don't want
to listen to any more of it.

1435
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,199
You must go now.

1436
01:25:00,299 --> 01:25:01,299
Please!

1437
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:03,399
I'm sorry.

1438
01:25:08,499 --> 01:25:10,599
I never meant to
upset you.

1439
01:25:10,699 --> 01:25:12,799
And thank you for
seeing me.

1440
01:25:23,899 --> 01:25:24,899
Goodbye, Mrs Durnley.

1441
01:25:28,999 --> 01:25:30,999
Don't go!

1442
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:32,099
Please!

1443
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:34,199
I'm sorry.

1444
01:25:36,299 --> 01:25:38,399
Tell me, why did you
come here today?

1445
01:25:39,499 --> 01:25:41,599
Do you know 
where he is?

1446
01:25:43,699 --> 01:25:44,699
Mrs Harper?

1447
01:25:45,799 --> 01:25:46,799
I'm off, then.

1448
01:25:46,899 --> 01:25:48,999
Alright, Clarkie. See
you tomorrow.

1449
01:25:49,099 --> 01:25:50,099
That's right.

1450
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,199
Ladies and gentlemen,

1451
01:26:33,299 --> 01:26:35,399
possibly the most important
scientific discovery...

1452
01:26:35,499 --> 01:26:37,499
of the last century.

1453
01:26:37,599 --> 01:26:39,599
The chromosome.

1454
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:43,699
Invisible to the naked eye,

1455
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:45,799
what we are,

1456
01:26:45,899 --> 01:26:46,899
how we look,

1457
01:26:47,999 --> 01:26:51,099
indeed in some cases
what we become,

1458
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:52,199
depends on the number,

1459
01:26:52,299 --> 01:26:55,399
and nature, of these
little blighters.

1460
01:26:55,499 --> 01:26:57,599
We get... twenty-three
from mum,

1461
01:26:58,699 --> 01:26:59,699
twenty-three from dad.

1462
01:26:59,799 --> 01:27:01,799
Forty-six, in all.

1463
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:02,899
And...

1464
01:27:02,999 --> 01:27:05,099
God help us if anything
goes wrong with them.

1465
01:27:05,199 --> 01:27:06,199
Now then,

1466
01:27:06,299 --> 01:27:08,399
I want you to look
at the chromosomes...

1467
01:27:08,499 --> 01:27:10,499
of a normal person.

1468
01:27:14,599 --> 01:27:15,599
Afterwards,

1469
01:27:15,699 --> 01:27:16,799
I shall want you to look 
at those of someone...

1470
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,999
who <i>appears</i> to 
be normal.

1471
01:27:27,099 --> 01:27:29,199
Hello, Susan. What 
brings you here?

1472
01:27:29,299 --> 01:27:30,299
Oh Shashie, I'm sorry,

1473
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:31,399
but I must have a word.

1474
01:27:31,499 --> 01:27:32,599
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

1475
01:27:33,699 --> 01:27:34,699
Yes, of course.

1476
01:27:34,799 --> 01:27:35,799
Come on.

1477
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:36,899
We can talk in here.

1478
01:27:44,999 --> 01:27:46,999
Now, the abnormal.

1479
01:27:48,099 --> 01:27:49,999
Do you see?

1480
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:52,099
The abnormality
is here.

1481
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:54,199
A translocated fusion.

1482
01:27:54,299 --> 01:27:56,399
Part of one chromosome
has split off,

1483
01:27:56,499 --> 01:27:58,499
and fused with another.

1484
01:27:58,599 --> 01:28:00,699
There is now a one 
in three chance,

1485
01:28:00,799 --> 01:28:02,899
that any child
produced, will be...

1486
01:28:02,999 --> 01:28:03,999
...a Mongol.

1487
01:28:04,099 --> 01:28:06,199
That's what his 
brother really is.

1488
01:28:06,299 --> 01:28:08,399
Not a sheep farmer
in Australia.

1489
01:28:08,499 --> 01:28:09,499
Hmm, rough.

1490
01:28:09,599 --> 01:28:10,599
Yes.

1491
01:28:10,699 --> 01:28:11,699
But that wasn't all.

1492
01:28:11,799 --> 01:28:12,799
In most cases,

1493
01:28:13,899 --> 01:28:14,899
bad luck.

1494
01:28:14,999 --> 01:28:18,199
An accident of nature.
The next child...

1495
01:28:18,299 --> 01:28:19,299
perfectly normal.

1496
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:21,499
But, if the fusion is
permanent,

1497
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:23,699
and a blood test
will show,

1498
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:25,899
then we have to warn
the unfortunate person...

1499
01:28:26,999 --> 01:28:27,999
no more children.

1500
01:28:28,099 --> 01:28:31,199
They might just as well have
told her not to breath.

1501
01:28:31,299 --> 01:28:33,399
So she went ahead, 
did she, and had Martin.

1502
01:28:33,499 --> 01:28:34,499
Oh dear, oh dear.

1503
01:28:34,599 --> 01:28:37,699
She's so lost, so 
lonely, Shashie.

1504
01:28:37,799 --> 01:28:39,899
She didn't love, she
worshipped him.

1505
01:28:39,999 --> 01:28:42,099
Fed him, washed him,
dressed him.

1506
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:44,299
There wasn't anything she
didn't do for him.

1507
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:45,499
And everyday of 
his life...

1508
01:28:45,599 --> 01:28:46,599
she searched him.

1509
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:48,699
Searched for signs.

1510
01:28:48,799 --> 01:28:49,899
The shape of
his eyes,

1511
01:28:49,999 --> 01:28:51,099
and the palms of
his hands,

1512
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,299
and the soles
of his little feet.

1513
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:53,399
All the time,

1514
01:28:53,499 --> 01:28:56,599
scared to death at
what she might find.

1515
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:57,699
Now...

1516
01:28:57,799 --> 01:28:58,799
let me impress on you,

1517
01:28:58,899 --> 01:29:00,999
any relatives of 
a Mongol...

1518
01:29:01,099 --> 01:29:04,199
are usually as normal
as you or I.

1519
01:29:04,299 --> 01:29:07,399
If they're not, it has nothing
to do with Mongolism.

1520
01:29:08,499 --> 01:29:10,599
One in every seven hundred
is born a Mongol,

1521
01:29:10,699 --> 01:29:12,799
but, ten times 
that number,

1522
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:14,999
roughly, one in
every hundred,

1523
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:18,199
suffers from other forms
of mental disturbance.

1524
01:29:18,299 --> 01:29:20,299
I find myself asking,

1525
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:22,399
is it really the home,

1526
01:29:22,499 --> 01:29:24,499
the environment,

1527
01:29:24,599 --> 01:29:26,699
the way a person
is brought up,

1528
01:29:26,799 --> 01:29:27,799
that creates the...

1529
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:28,899
neurotic, the psychopath,

1530
01:29:28,999 --> 01:29:30,999
the psychotic?

1531
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:33,099
Or could it be some...

1532
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:36,299
error in the chromosome
structure?

1533
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:38,499
Working beyond 
the compass...

1534
01:29:38,599 --> 01:29:41,699
of our most powerful
microscope,

1535
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:44,899
could the poet have
devined the truth...

1536
01:29:44,999 --> 01:29:46,999
before science,

1537
01:29:47,099 --> 01:29:48,099
when he wrote;

1538
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:50,199
'No puppet master...'

1539
01:29:50,299 --> 01:29:52,299
'pulls the strings on high.'

1540
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:54,399
'A twisted nerve,'

1541
01:29:54,499 --> 01:29:57,499
'a ganglion gone awry,'

1542
01:29:57,599 --> 01:29:59,599
'Predestinates the sinner...'

1543
01:29:59,699 --> 01:30:01,699
'or the saint.'

1544
01:30:08,799 --> 01:30:10,799
Still at it, Georgie?

1545
01:30:10,899 --> 01:30:12,899
You are working hard.

1546
01:30:14,999 --> 01:30:17,099
Be careful, that's
very sharp.

1547
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,299
I've just put the kettle on,
come and have a cup of tea.

1548
01:30:23,399 --> 01:30:24,499
Where's Susan 
gone to?

1549
01:30:25,599 --> 01:30:26,599
London.

1550
01:30:28,699 --> 01:30:31,799
I've got a surprise
for you, Georgie.

1551
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:32,899
Guess who 'phoned?

1552
01:30:32,999 --> 01:30:33,999
Daddy.

1553
01:30:37,099 --> 01:30:39,199
He wants to take 
you away, Georgie.

1554
01:30:41,299 --> 01:30:42,299
I shall miss you.

1555
01:30:43,399 --> 01:30:47,499
When you go and Susan's
back at school, I shall be alone.

1556
01:30:49,599 --> 01:30:50,599
Will you miss me?

1557
01:30:50,599 --> 01:30:52,599
When's she coming back?

1558
01:30:52,699 --> 01:30:53,699
Susan?

1559
01:30:53,799 --> 01:30:54,799
She didn't say.

1560
01:30:57,899 --> 01:30:58,899
Oh yes, that reminds me...

1561
01:30:58,999 --> 01:31:02,099
what was it now she was
so anxious to know...

1562
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:07,299
Oh yes, had you ever mentioned
anyone called 'Durnley'?

1563
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:12,499
Yes, that was the 
man's name... 'Durnle...'

1564
01:31:12,599 --> 01:31:14,599
Georgie!

1565
01:31:14,699 --> 01:31:16,799
Georgie, you've
cut yourself...

1566
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:17,899
oh you poor boy!

1567
01:31:18,999 --> 01:31:19,999
Use your handkerchief.

1568
01:31:34,099 --> 01:31:35,099
What did she say?

1569
01:31:35,199 --> 01:31:37,299
You better come up to my room
and let me see to it...

1570
01:31:37,399 --> 01:31:39,499
What did she say,
she say, say...?

1571
01:31:39,599 --> 01:31:41,599
About the Durnleys?

1572
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:44,799
Oh 'Martin', that was his first 
name, I've just remembered.

1573
01:31:44,899 --> 01:31:46,899
Who is he, Georgie... hmm?

1574
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:47,999
Who is he, this 'Martin'?

1575
01:31:48,099 --> 01:31:50,199
I wonder if he's anything to
do with that murder.

1576
01:31:51,299 --> 01:31:52,299
His name was Durnley.

1577
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:57,499
What is it? You're
trembling.

1578
01:31:58,599 --> 01:32:01,799
It's alright. Tell Mummy
all about it. 

1579
01:32:01,899 --> 01:32:04,999
I'll teach her, teach her,
teach her...

1580
01:32:06,099 --> 01:32:07,099
What's the matter?

1581
01:32:08,199 --> 01:32:09,199
What is it?

1582
01:32:09,299 --> 01:32:12,399
Take your filthy 
hands off... ME!!

1583
01:32:16,499 --> 01:32:17,499
You're mad!

1584
01:32:28,599 --> 01:32:31,699
She wants me to
send him back.

1585
01:32:31,799 --> 01:32:32,799
Well?

1586
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:35,899
Shashie, I'm scared.

1587
01:32:35,999 --> 01:32:38,099
What is he, schizo, 
or something?

1588
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,199
Autistic, more likely.

1589
01:32:40,299 --> 01:32:42,399
Rather stay a child, 
a baby, if he could.

1590
01:32:42,499 --> 01:32:43,599
And with a mother
like that,

1591
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:45,799
feeding him a daily diet
of her anxieties...

1592
01:32:45,899 --> 01:32:46,899
I don't wonder at it.

1593
01:32:46,999 --> 01:32:49,099
I tell you what I've
been wondering...

1594
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:51,299
that night his 
father died,

1595
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,499
did he really have
that nightmare?

1596
01:32:55,599 --> 01:32:56,599
Oh... sorry, Sir.

1597
01:32:56,699 --> 01:32:59,799
They want Harold and Mary,
here, for the next show.

1598
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:00,899
Alright.

1599
01:33:00,999 --> 01:33:01,999
What do I do?

1600
01:33:03,099 --> 01:33:04,099
You come with me.

1601
01:33:06,299 --> 01:33:07,199
Morning, gentlemen.

1602
01:33:07,299 --> 01:33:10,399
- Morning, Sir.
- All ready for a trip 'round the bay?

1603
01:33:10,499 --> 01:33:11,499
Where's the Maharaja?

1604
01:33:11,599 --> 01:33:14,699
Ahh, Kumar. You with
us today?

1605
01:33:14,799 --> 01:33:16,899
Err... sorry, Sir John.
Just coming.

1606
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:18,599
There you are, see what
you chaps can pick up...

1607
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:20,199
in a teaching hospital!

1608
01:33:20,299 --> 01:33:21,399
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Come on.

1609
01:33:22,499 --> 01:33:24,599
Well <i>he</i> usually goes
around like a dose of salts.

1610
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:25,699
So I shan't be long.

1611
01:33:25,799 --> 01:33:28,899
But when you go back, I'm
going with you, understand?

1612
01:33:28,999 --> 01:33:30,099
- Thank you, Shashie.
- Good.

1613
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:51,199
Oh, nurse...

1614
01:33:51,299 --> 01:33:52,299
is there a 'phone?

1615
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:55,499
- On the ground floor.
- Oh damn! Really?

1616
01:33:55,599 --> 01:33:56,699
- Is it urgent?
- Yes.

1617
01:33:56,799 --> 01:33:58,899
Look, Sister's in casualty,
use hers.

1618
01:33:58,999 --> 01:34:01,099
- Oh could I?
- If you're quick about it...

1619
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,299
but don't tell her 
her I told you!

1620
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:03,399
Thank you.

1621
01:34:54,499 --> 01:34:56,599
This telephone is for
staff use only!

1622
01:34:56,699 --> 01:34:57,699
Sorry, Sister.

1623
01:34:58,799 --> 01:34:59,799
Fourpence, please.

1624
01:35:01,899 --> 01:35:04,999
There was no reply.
Thank you.

1625
01:35:21,099 --> 01:35:22,099
Let's ask the Maharaja.

1626
01:35:22,199 --> 01:35:23,199
He's good with the girls.

1627
01:35:23,299 --> 01:35:25,299
Diagnosis, please.

1628
01:35:25,399 --> 01:35:26,399
Uhm...

1629
01:35:26,499 --> 01:35:28,599
The character of the
abdominal pains,

1630
01:35:28,699 --> 01:35:30,799
suggests an infection of
the lower intestine.

1631
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:31,899
Oh no, it's not that.

1632
01:35:31,999 --> 01:35:33,099
It isn't?

1633
01:35:33,199 --> 01:35:35,299
No... it's them pills the
black nurse give me.

1634
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:37,499
I've been on the
bed pan ever since.

1635
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:38,699
- You have?
- Yes.

1636
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:40,799
I'm on it now!

1637
01:35:40,899 --> 01:35:42,999
In that case we
better leave you.

1638
01:35:59,099 --> 01:36:00,099
Mum?

1639
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,199
Mum?

1640
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:04,299
Anyone at home?

1641
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:14,399
Mum?

1642
01:36:14,499 --> 01:36:16,499
Are you down there?

1643
01:36:21,599 --> 01:36:23,599
Mum!

1644
01:36:55,699 --> 01:36:56,699
Hello?

1645
01:36:56,799 --> 01:36:57,799
Hello, Susan?

1646
01:36:57,899 --> 01:36:59,899
Oh, it's you, Shashie.

1647
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:00,999
Did you get my note?

1648
01:37:01,099 --> 01:37:03,199
- I nearly got heart failure!
- Yes I'm sorry...

1649
01:37:03,299 --> 01:37:05,399
but I'd forgotten it
was Clarkie's half day...

1650
01:37:05,499 --> 01:37:07,599
and I didn't want Mum
to be alone here.

1651
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:08,699
Are you alright?

1652
01:37:08,799 --> 01:37:09,799
Yes, I'm alright.

1653
01:37:09,899 --> 01:37:10,899
Is your mother there?

1654
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:11,999
No, she's out.

1655
01:37:12,099 --> 01:37:13,099
No sign of anyone.

1656
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:14,199
Good!

1657
01:37:14,299 --> 01:37:16,399
Now if he does show...
keep out of his way.

1658
01:37:16,499 --> 01:37:18,599
I'm leaving as 
soon as I can.

1659
01:37:18,699 --> 01:37:19,699
Yes, Doctor!

1660
01:37:19,799 --> 01:37:21,899
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

1661
01:37:32,999 --> 01:37:33,999
Uhh!

1662
01:37:36,099 --> 01:37:37,099
Gerry!

1663
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:41,199
Yoike!

1664
01:37:41,299 --> 01:37:42,299
It's you!

1665
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:46,499
Well, it's not a 
bloody Ghost!

1666
01:37:46,599 --> 01:37:49,699
You look as if you're
expecting one.

1667
01:37:49,799 --> 01:37:50,799
You're early.

1668
01:37:50,899 --> 01:37:53,899
Well... I'm drunk!

1669
01:37:54,999 --> 01:37:55,999
Celebration?

1670
01:37:56,099 --> 01:37:57,099
What, yeah...

1671
01:37:57,199 --> 01:38:00,299
yeah... well I said I'd
do it, and I've done it!

1672
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:03,499
You call 'em 
'films', I said.

1673
01:38:04,599 --> 01:38:05,599
'Films'?!

1674
01:38:05,699 --> 01:38:08,799
'Celluloid manure', 
that's more like it!

1675
01:38:08,899 --> 01:38:10,899
I... gave it to 'em...

1676
01:38:10,999 --> 01:38:12,999
the whole script.

1677
01:38:13,099 --> 01:38:18,199
Uncut.. in new over.. 3D and..
stereo..le..phonic sound...

1678
01:38:18,299 --> 01:38:23,399
and... there was no interval
for refreshments, either!

1679
01:38:23,499 --> 01:38:25,499
Ha, ha, ha...

1680
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:26,599
What did they say?

1681
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:29,699
You're fired!

1682
01:38:30,799 --> 01:38:31,799
Fired?

1683
01:38:31,899 --> 01:38:33,899
Oh... dear!

1684
01:38:33,999 --> 01:38:39,099
Ha, ha! 'oh dear'... that's
very good... yes.. ha, ha...

1685
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:52,199
He, he... twelve years...

1686
01:38:52,299 --> 01:38:54,299
twelve years I've been...

1687
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:54,399


1688
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,499
kissing their backsides and
now... I'm out on mine!

1689
01:38:58,499 --> 01:39:00,499
Lost me job...

1690
01:39:00,599 --> 01:39:02,599
lost my home...

1691
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,699
Ahh...

1692
01:39:04,799 --> 01:39:07,899
And I've lost my senses 
by the look of it as well!

1693
01:39:07,999 --> 01:39:10,099
Let me make you 
some coffee.

1694
01:39:10,199 --> 01:39:11,199
Oh...

1695
01:39:11,299 --> 01:39:12,299
Make you feel better.

1696
01:39:12,399 --> 01:39:14,499
No, not just now...
thanks, love.

1697
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:16,599
Have you got an aspirin?

1698
01:39:16,699 --> 01:39:18,699
Soon get some.

1699
01:40:20,799 --> 01:40:23,899
- Huh!
- Don't scream!

1700
01:40:26,999 --> 01:40:28,999
Hello, Susan.

1701
01:40:31,099 --> 01:40:32,099
Hello, Georgie.

1702
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,199
Sur... surprised you.

1703
01:40:35,299 --> 01:40:36,299
Didn't I?

1704
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,499
Yes... I was just getting
some aspirin for Gerry.

1705
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:42,599
He's downstairs.

1706
01:40:43,699 --> 01:40:45,699
Better stay there.

1707
01:40:51,799 --> 01:40:53,799
You've had a busy day.

1708
01:40:54,899 --> 01:40:55,899
Yes.

1709
01:40:55,999 --> 01:40:56,999
Visiting?

1710
01:40:58,099 --> 01:40:59,099
Yes.

1711
01:41:01,199 --> 01:41:02,199
Anyone I know?

1712
01:41:04,299 --> 01:41:05,299
You hurt your hand.

1713
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:07,399
It's ok.

1714
01:41:09,499 --> 01:41:10,499
Your mum saw to it.

1715
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:14,599
Before she went out.

1716
01:41:16,699 --> 01:41:17,699
How's... m...

1717
01:41:17,799 --> 01:41:20,799
mm... mmm...my old lady?

1718
01:41:21,899 --> 01:41:23,899
She wants you back.

1719
01:41:24,999 --> 01:41:26,999
Martin.

1720
01:41:27,099 --> 01:41:28,099
Yeah.

1721
01:41:29,199 --> 01:41:31,199
I've got other ideas.

1722
01:41:32,299 --> 01:41:34,299
And we're a bit pushed.

1723
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:38,399
Put that on.

1724
01:41:43,499 --> 01:41:44,499
Why?

1725
01:41:44,599 --> 01:41:47,699
You want to look
your best, don't you?

1726
01:41:48,799 --> 01:41:49,799
What for?

1727
01:41:49,899 --> 01:41:51,899
Getting married.

1728
01:41:54,999 --> 01:41:55,999
Go ahead...

1729
01:41:57,099 --> 01:42:00,099
Put it on... Susan!

1730
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:21,299
He bribed a porter to post
that letter. We know that.

1731
01:42:22,399 --> 01:42:24,499
He never went to Paris.
We know that.

1732
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:26,599
Now, where's he hiding?

1733
01:42:26,699 --> 01:42:28,699
And why?

1734
01:42:30,799 --> 01:42:32,899
Ever thought 
about death?

1735
01:42:32,999 --> 01:42:33,999
Dream it?

1736
01:42:35,099 --> 01:42:36,099
It's like swimming.

1737
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:39,299
Only, there's no one
there to pull you out.

1738
01:42:39,399 --> 01:42:41,499
There will be time for everything,
with a bit of luck.

1739
01:42:41,599 --> 01:42:44,699
You cant help what you
dream. Can you?

1740
01:42:44,799 --> 01:42:45,799
You can't.

1741
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:48,899
And it's all night long.

1742
01:42:48,999 --> 01:42:49,999
All night.

1743
01:42:50,099 --> 01:42:53,199
Sleep well, my Darling?
Yes thank you, Mummy.

1744
01:42:53,299 --> 01:42:56,399
Some dreams you don't
have to be asleep for.

1745
01:42:56,499 --> 01:42:57,499
Like the ones about you.

1746
01:42:58,599 --> 01:42:59,599
They'd surprise you.

1747
01:43:00,699 --> 01:43:03,799
Would you like a
surprise, Susan... first?

1748
01:43:04,899 --> 01:43:05,899
Sit down.

1749
01:43:08,999 --> 01:43:10,999
No!

1750
01:43:11,099 --> 01:43:12,099
No, not there.

1751
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:15,199
Here.

1752
01:43:45,299 --> 01:43:47,299
Oh...

1753
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:51,399
Ooh...

1754
01:44:08,499 --> 01:44:11,499
No... bloody wood!

1755
01:44:16,599 --> 01:44:18,699
Do you know what I dreamt
you'd do then, Susan?

1756
01:44:18,799 --> 01:44:20,799
Do you? Do you?

1757
01:44:20,899 --> 01:44:21,899
Listen to this.

1758
01:44:22,999 --> 01:44:24,999
Listen...!!

1759
01:44:26,099 --> 01:44:28,099
It has to be slowly.

1760
01:44:28,199 --> 01:44:29,199
Very slowly.

1761
01:44:31,299 --> 01:44:34,399
You... pull me over you.
Right over you.

1762
01:44:34,499 --> 01:44:37,599
I can feel your knee pressing
beneath me and it's... hard.

1763
01:44:37,699 --> 01:44:39,799
<i>And when the nurse
brought him in...</i>

1764
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:40,899
<i>and gave him to me...</i>

1765
01:44:41,999 --> 01:44:42,999
<i>the doctor said...</i>

1766
01:44:43,099 --> 01:44:45,099
<i>'you can stop worrying'...</i>

1767
01:44:45,199 --> 01:44:46,199
<i>'you've been lucky'...</i>

1768
01:44:46,299 --> 01:44:47,299
<i>'he's not a Mongol'.</i>

1769
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:49,399
<i>Can you understand...</i>

1770
01:44:49,499 --> 01:44:53,599
<i>can you imagine </i>
<i>how I felt, Susan?</i>

1771
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:54,699
<i>I wept.</i>

1772
01:44:54,799 --> 01:44:56,799
<i>He was so beautiful.</i>

1773
01:44:57,899 --> 01:44:58,899
<i>A miracle!</i>

1774
01:44:59,999 --> 01:45:02,099
<i>That's how I wanted</i>
<i>to keep him.</i>

1775
01:45:02,199 --> 01:45:05,299
<i>A baby. In my </i>
<i>arms, forever.</i>

1776
01:45:05,399 --> 01:45:07,399
I've waited so long, you see.

1777
01:45:07,499 --> 01:45:10,599
That's why it 
has to be slowly.

1778
01:45:12,699 --> 01:45:13,699
Slowly.

1779
01:45:14,799 --> 01:45:16,899
Only, if a man asked
a girl that...

1780
01:45:16,899 --> 01:45:18,999
she'd laugh, 
wouldn't she?

1781
01:45:19,099 --> 01:45:21,099
I wouldn't laugh, Georgie.

1782
01:45:23,199 --> 01:45:24,199
You wouldn't?

1783
01:45:27,299 --> 01:45:28,299
Alright then, Susan.

1784
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:31,399
Take it.

1785
01:45:34,499 --> 01:45:35,499
Go on.

1786
01:45:35,599 --> 01:45:36,599
Take it.

1787
01:45:38,699 --> 01:45:39,699
Take it!

1788
01:45:40,799 --> 01:45:41,799
No, Georgie!

1789
01:45:41,899 --> 01:45:42,899
Why not?!

1790
01:45:42,999 --> 01:45:44,999
Tell me! Why not!!?

1791
01:45:46,099 --> 01:45:47,099
Shh!

1792
01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:55,190
There you are, listen.

1793
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:01,290
Like wedding bells.

1794
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:08,390
Now, Susan.

1795
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:10,490
Now!

1796
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:14,690
I can't, I tell you!
I can't!

1797
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:16,890
Then why pretend
you could!?

1798
01:46:16,990 --> 01:46:17,990
Why!!?

1799
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:21,190
You've got to now,
do you hear?

1800
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:23,390
Do you hear?
GOT TO!!

1801
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:28,589
- No!
- ARRRGGHHH!!!

1802
01:46:28,689 --> 01:46:31,589
Meurgh...

1803
01:46:36,689 --> 01:46:39,589
Uurgghhh...

1804
01:46:46,689 --> 01:46:48,689
Here, put it on.

1805
01:46:48,789 --> 01:46:49,789
We're going.

1806
01:46:49,889 --> 01:46:50,889
You go.

1807
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:51,989
No, us...

1808
01:46:52,089 --> 01:46:54,089
us, us, us, US!!

1809
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:56,189
I'm not going.

1810
01:46:56,289 --> 01:46:58,289
Not with you, Martin.

1811
01:46:58,389 --> 01:46:59,389
With Georgie, then.

1812
01:46:59,489 --> 01:47:00,489
Georgie.

1813
01:47:01,589 --> 01:47:02,589
No!

1814
01:47:04,689 --> 01:47:07,789
You're going to 
kill me anyway.

1815
01:47:19,889 --> 01:47:21,889
Oh, damn!

1816
01:47:22,989 --> 01:47:26,089
- Who is it?
- It's me, Shashie!

1817
01:47:31,189 --> 01:47:33,189
Ohh... thank God!

1818
01:47:33,289 --> 01:47:35,598
Hey, what's wrong?
What's the matter?!

1819
01:47:35,698 --> 01:47:36,588
- In the shed.
- Uh?

1820
01:47:36,688 --> 01:47:39,788
It's horrible!
In the shed.

1821
01:47:39,888 --> 01:47:40,888
No!

1822
01:48:17,988 --> 01:48:19,088
Have you called
the police?

1823
01:48:19,188 --> 01:48:21,288
Yeah.. well.. I was just
gonna fetch them.

1824
01:48:21,388 --> 01:48:22,388
Where's Susan?

1825
01:48:22,488 --> 01:48:25,588
- She <i>was</i> here.
- Susan!

1826
01:48:28,688 --> 01:48:30,788
Don't you let him, Georgie!

1827
01:48:30,888 --> 01:48:31,888
Don't let him!

1828
01:48:31,988 --> 01:48:34,088
She may have gone out
to buy some aspirin.

1829
01:48:34,188 --> 01:48:36,288
Well quickly take a 
look downstairs.

1830
01:48:37,388 --> 01:48:40,488
Have you gone bloody mad?
He might be down there! 

1831
01:48:40,588 --> 01:48:42,688
I don't wanna get chopped.

1832
01:48:42,788 --> 01:48:43,788
Hello, Police?

1833
01:48:43,888 --> 01:48:47,988
Help me!
Help me!

1834
01:48:48,088 --> 01:48:49,988
Oh!

1835
01:48:50,088 --> 01:48:51,088
Oh... damn!

1836
01:48:52,188 --> 01:48:53,188
Help me.

1837
01:48:53,288 --> 01:48:54,288
Help me.

1838
01:48:56,388 --> 01:48:57,288
Don't!

1839
01:48:57,388 --> 01:48:58,388
Don't!!

1840
01:49:24,488 --> 01:49:25,388
Please, Georgie.

1841
01:49:33,488 --> 01:49:34,488
Please.

1842
01:49:39,588 --> 01:49:41,688
You're like all
the others...

1843
01:49:41,788 --> 01:49:42,788
others... others.

1844
01:49:43,888 --> 01:49:45,888
No! No, Georgie!

1845
01:49:47,988 --> 01:49:51,088
Nooo...!
Help!

1846
01:49:55,188 --> 01:49:58,288
Now watch ya step.
This chap's a nutter!

1847
01:49:58,388 --> 01:49:59,388
Yes you are!

1848
01:49:59,488 --> 01:50:01,488
All the same!

1849
01:50:01,588 --> 01:50:03,588
All of you!!!

1850
01:50:33,688 --> 01:50:34,688
Martin's dead.

1851
01:50:34,788 --> 01:50:36,788
He's been bad.

1852
01:50:36,888 --> 01:50:38,888
N... not Georgie.

1853
01:50:41,988 --> 01:50:43,988
Bad... bad Marty!

1854
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:51,088
And now... I lay me down to sleep,

1855
01:50:51,188 --> 01:50:55,188
pray the Lord my soul to keep.

1856
01:50:56,288 --> 01:50:58,288
If I die before I wake...

1857
01:51:00,388 --> 01:51:02,388
if I die before I...

1858
01:51:02,488 --> 01:51:04,488
wake...

1859
01:51:04,588 --> 01:51:05,588
Get 'im!

1860
01:51:08,688 --> 01:51:09,688
Susan?

1861
01:51:10,788 --> 01:51:11,788
Susan.

1862
01:51:11,888 --> 01:51:15,988
Susan. Susan. 
Susan. Susan...

1863
01:51:18,088 --> 01:51:19,988
Susan...

1864
01:51:54,088 --> 01:51:55,088
'A twisted nerve,'

1865
01:51:56,188 --> 01:51:58,188
'a ganglion gone awry,'

1866
01:51:58,288 --> 01:52:00,288
'Predestinates the sinner...'

1867
01:52:01,388 --> 01:52:02,388
'or the saint.'

1868
01:52:04,488 --> 01:52:05,488
Susan.

1869
01:52:06,588 --> 01:52:07,588
Susan.

1870
01:52:08,688 --> 01:52:09,688
Susan.

1871
01:52:11,788 --> 01:52:12,788
Susan.
