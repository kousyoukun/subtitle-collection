1
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,029
How beautifully dramatic.

2
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,796
The crudest, savage, exhibition
of nature at her worst, without,

3
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,714
and we three, we elegant three, within.

4
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,595
I should like to think
that an irate Jehovah

5
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,831
was pointing those arrows
of lightning directly at my head.

6
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,278
The unbowed head of George Gordon,
Lord Byron, England's greatest sinner.

7
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,272
But I cannot flatter
myself to that extent.

8
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,828
Possibly those thunders
are for our dear Shelley.

9
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,514
Heaven's applause
for England's greatest poet.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,356
- What of my Mary?
- She is an angel.

11
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,512
- You think so?

12
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,356
You hear?

13
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,874
Come, Mary. Come and watch the storm.

14
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,349
You know how lightning alarms me.

15
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,389
Shelley, darling, will you please
light these candles for me?

16
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,391
Mary, darling.

17
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,630
Astonishing creature.

18
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,918
- I, Lord Byron? - Frightened of
thunder, fearful of the dark.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,879
And yet you have written a tale
that sent my blood into icy creeps.

20
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,429
Look at her, Shelley. Can you believe that
lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein?

21
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,479
A monster created from
cadavers out of rifled graves.

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,269
- Isn't it astonishing?
- I don't know why you should think so.

23
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,112
What do you expect?

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,034
Such an audience needs something
stronger than a pretty little love story.

25
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,270
So why shouldn't I write of monsters?

26
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:26,308
No wonder Murray's refused to publish
the book. His public would be shocked.

27
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,550
It will be published, I think.

28
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,598
Then, darling, you will have
much to answer for.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,595
The publishers did not see that
my purpose was to write a moral lesson

30
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,834
of the punishment that befell
a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,675
Whatever your purpose was, I take great
relish in savouring each separate horror.

32
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,751
I roll them over on my tongue.

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,832
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,992
What a setting in that
churchyard to begin with!

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,474
The sobbing women, the first clod of earth
on the coffin. That was a pretty chill.

36
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,553
Frankenstein and the dwarf stealing
the body out of its new-made grave.

37
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,277
Cutting the hanged man down from the
gallows, where he swung in the wind.

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,273
The cunning of Frankenstein
in his mountain laboratory,

39
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,672
picking dead men apart and
building up a human monster

40
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,197
so fearful and so horrible that only
a half-crazed brain could have devised.

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,237
And then the murders,
the little child who drowned.

42
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,870
Henry Frankenstein himself
thrown from the top of the burning mill

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,269
by the very monster he had created.

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,673
And it was these fragile white fingers
that penned the nightmare.

45
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,718
Ah! You've made me prick myself, Byron.

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,676
It's bleeding.

47
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,118
There, there. I do think it a shame, Mary,
to end your story quite so suddenly.

48
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,830
That wasn't the end at all. Would you
like to hear what happened after that?

49
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,070
I feel like telling it.

50
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,993
It's a perfect night
for mystery and horror.

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,390
The air itself is filled with monsters.

52
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,237
I'm all ears. While heaven blasts the
night without, open up your pits of hell.

53
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,157
Well, then, imagine yourselves
standing by the wreckage of the mill.

54
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,754
The fire is dying down.

55
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,719
Soon the bare skeleton
of the building rolls over,

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,234
the gaunt rafters against the sky.

57
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,674
Well, I must say, that's the best fire
I ever saw in all me life.

58
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,878
- What are you cryin' for?
- It's terrible.

59
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,636
I know. But after all them murders and
poor Mr Henry being brought home to die,

60
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,236
I'm glad to see the monster
roasted to death before my very eyes.

61
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,470
It's too good for him.

62
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,873
It's all the devil's work, and you'd better
cross yourself quick before he gets you.

63
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,593
Come along, come along. It's all over.

64
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,155
Get back to your homes and go to sleep.

65
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,038
There it goes again.
It ain't burnt out at all.

66
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,396
- There's more yet.
- Isn't the monster dead yet?

67
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,790
It's high time every decent
man and wife was in bed.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,116
That's his insides caught at last.

69
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,953
Insides is always the
last to be consumed.

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,474
Move on. You've had enough
excitement for one night.

71
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,950
This strange man
you call a monster is dead.

72
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,270
Monster, indeed!

73
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,673
You may thank your lucky stars they sent
for me to safeguard life and property.

74
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,672
Why didn't you safeguard
those drownded and murdered?

75
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,469
Come, now.
We want no rallying, no riots.

76
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,790
- Who's riotin'?
- Move on, move on.

77
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,474
Good night all, and pleasant dreams.

78
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,869
Ah, pleasant dreams yourself.

79
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,638
Thinks he's everybody just because
he's a burgomaster. Huh!

80
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,829
Poor Mr Henry. He was to have been
married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth.

81
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,232
Cover him up. Someone must
break the news to the poor girl.

82
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,629
Ride as fast as you can to the castle,

83
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,349
and tell the old Baron Frankenstein
we are bringing his son home.

84
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,194
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, shut up.

85
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,431
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,798
Nothing could be left alive in that
furnace. Why do you stay here?

87
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,156
I want to see with my own eyes.

88
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,470
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.

89
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,712
And, dead or alive, nothing can
bring our little Maria back to us.

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,590
If I can see his blackened bones,
I can sleep at night.

91
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,671
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!

92
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,719
Maria drowned to death and
you burned up! What should I do then?

93
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,791
No!

94
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,554
Hans. Hans!

95
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,428
Where are you? Hans!
Are you all right?

96
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,357
I hear you. Here,
give me your hand, Hans.

97
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,111
Here.

98
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
Oh, heaven, what is this?

99
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,269
Henry? Tell me.

100
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,955
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?

101
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,839
Bring him in.

102
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,960
- Albert.
- What do you want?

103
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,237
It's alive. The monster, it's alive!

104
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,559
- Ah, shut up, you old fool.
- I saw it.

105
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,552
It ain't turned to no skeleton at all.

106
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,756
It lived right through the fire.

107
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,037
Ah, go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.

108
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,031
Nobody'll believe me.

109
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,509
All right, I'll wash my hands of it.

110
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,070
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds.

111
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,555
- Speak to me, Henry.
- Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.

112
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,390
I was foretold of this.

113
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,233
I was told beware my wedding night.

114
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,840
Oh, look, milady! He's alive!

115
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,996
Henry, darling.

116
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,871
Elizabeth.

117
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,312
Oh, what a terrible wedding night.

118
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,111
You can go to bed now, Mary.

119
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,233
- You'll soon be better.
- I feel almost myself again.

120
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,313
When you're strong enough, we'll go
away and forget this horrible experience.

121
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,710
Forget? If only I could forget.

122
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,995
But it's never out of my mind.

123
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,550
I've been cursed for delving
into the mysteries of life.

124
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,428
Perhaps death is sacred,
and I've profaned it.

125
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,592
For what a wonderful vision it was.

126
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,074
I dreamed of being the first to give to the
world the secret that God is so jealous of.

127
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,833
The formula for life.

128
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,356
Think of the power to create a man.

129
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,913
And I did. I did it. I created a man.

130
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,197
And who knows? In time I could
have trained him to do my will.

131
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,439
I could have bred a race. I might even
have found the secret of eternal life.

132
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,036
Henry, don't say those things. Don't
think them. It's blasphemous and wicked.

133
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,917
We are not meant to know those things.

134
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,151
It may be that I'm intended
to know the secret of life.

135
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,428
It may be part of the divine plan.

136
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,910
No, no. It's the devil that prompts you.

137
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,549
It's death, not life, that is in it all
and at the end of it all.

138
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,634
Listen, while you've been lying here,
tossing in your delirium, I couldn't sleep.

139
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,029
And when you rave of your insane desire

140
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,873
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

141
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,270
a strange apparition has
seemed to appear in the room.

142
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,309
It comes, a figure like Death. And each
time it comes more clearly, nearer.

143
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,995
It seems to be reaching out for you,
as if it would take you away from me!

144
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,389
There it is. Look.

145
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,629
- There.
- I see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?

146
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,756
There's nothing there.

147
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,593
There! There! It's coming for you!

148
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,639
Nearer! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!

149
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,711
Henry!

150
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,148
Albert! Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.

151
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,911
- What's the good of footmen anyway?

152
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,468
All right. All right!

153
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,075
Don't knock the castle over!
We're not all dead yet.

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,992
- There's nobody at home.
- Let me in, my good woman.

155
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,992
I know the young
Baron Frankenstein is at home.

156
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,392
He's sick. He's in his bed, where all
decent folk should be at this time of night.

157
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,713
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here
on a secret matter of grave importance,

158
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,633
and must see him alone, tonight.

159
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,310
Dr Pretorius?

160
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,231
Pretorius?

161
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,791
- What was it? What was the name?
- Dr Pretorius.

162
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,515
There ain't no such name.

163
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,391
Now, you stay there.

164
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,192
- Who's there?
- It's Minnie, milady.

165
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,271
Oh, come in.

166
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,150
It's Dr Pretorius.

167
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,074
He says he wants to see
the master. Most insistent.

168
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,639
Pretorius?

169
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,154
He's a very queer-looking
old gentleman, sir.

170
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,153
And must see you, on a secret,
grave matter, he said.

171
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,117
Tonight. Alone.

172
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,510
- Bring him in.
- Henry, who is this man?

173
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,477
Dr Pretorius.

174
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,633
Baron Frankenstein now, I believe?

175
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,029
Won't you come in, Doctor?

176
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,956
I trust you will pardon
this intrusion at so late an hour.

177
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,590
I would not have ventured to come,
had I not a communication to make

178
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,275
which I suspect may be
of the utmost importance to yourself.

179
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,191
This is Professor Pretorius. He used to be
Doctor of Philosophy at the university.

180
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,874
- But, uh...
- But was booted out.

181
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,520
Booted, my dear Baron, is the word.

182
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,477
For knowing too much.

183
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,757
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.

184
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,070
I am also a doctor, Baroness.

185
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,196
Why have you come here tonight?

186
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,192
My business with you, Baron, is private.

187
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,271
Elizabeth, please.

188
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,351
I do hope he won't upset Henry.

189
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,309
- What do you want?
- We must work together.

190
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,551
Never. This is outrageous.

191
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,236
I'm through with it.
I'll have no more of this hell-spawn.

192
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,154
As soon as I'm well,
I'm to be married, and I'm going away.

193
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,310
I must beg you to reconsider.

194
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,074
You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

195
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,197
who are responsible
for all those murders?

196
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,712
There are penalties
to pay for killing people.

197
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,917
And with your creature
still at large in the countryside...

198
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,070
Are you threatening me?

199
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,196
Don't put it so crudely.

200
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,956
I had ventured to hope that you and I
together, no longer as master and pupil,

201
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,477
but as fellow scientists, might probe
the mysteries of life and death...

202
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,198
Never. No further.

203
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,192
...and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

204
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,034
I can't make any further experiments.
I've had a terrible lesson.

205
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,236
That is sad, very sad.

206
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,320
But you and I have gone too far to stop.

207
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,278
Nor can it be stopped so easily.

208
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,158
I also have continued
with my experiments.

209
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,629
That is why I am here tonight.

210
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,109
You must see my creation.

211
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,193
Have you also succeeded
in bringing life to the dead?

212
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,590
If you, Herr Baron, will do me the
honour of visiting my humble abode,

213
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,911
I think you will be interested
in what I have to show you.

214
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,028
After 20 years of secret scientific
research, and countless failures,

215
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,911
I also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,231
I must know. When can I see it?

217
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,675
I thought you might change your mind.

218
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,558
Why not tonight? It is not very late.

219
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,310
- Is it far?
- No, but you will need a coat.

220
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,669
I think your coachman
had better wait here.

221
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,196
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?

222
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,595
Before I show you the results
of my trifling experiments,

223
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,194
I would like to drink
to our partnership.

224
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,397
Do you like gin? It is my only weakness.

225
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,314
To a new world of gods and monsters.

226
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,439
Creation of life is enthralling,

227
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,114
distinctly enthralling, is it not?

228
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,988
I cannot account precisely
for all that I am going to show you.

229
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,959
But perhaps now that
you are my partner, you can.

230
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,230
My experiments did not turn out
quite like yours, Henry.

231
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,236
But science, like love, has her
little surprises, as you shall see.

232
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,278
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?

233
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,238
There is a pleasing variety
about my exhibits.

234
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,030
My first experiment was so lovely

235
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,270
that we made her a queen.

236
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,151
Charming, don't you think?

237
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,839
Then, of course, we had to have a king.

238
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,553
Now he's so madly in love with her
that we have to segregate them.

239
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,839
Now now. I have to be
very careful with the king.

240
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,076
Now, behave.

241
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,914
My next production looked
so disapprovingly at the other two

242
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,550
that they made him an archbishop.

243
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,995
He seems to be asleep.
I must wake him up.

244
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,790
The next one is the very devil.

245
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,156
Very bizarre, this little chap.

246
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,552
There's a certain resemblance to me,
don't you think? Or do I flatter myself?

247
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,029
I took a great deal of pains with him.

248
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,836
Sometimes I have wondered whether
life wouldn't be much more amusing

249
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,036
if we were all devils,

250
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,829
and no nonsense about
angels and being good.

251
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,556
Oh, there's the king out again.

252
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,515
Even royal amours are a nuisance.

253
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,198
Poor Archbishop. He has his hands full.

254
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,149
There. That'll keep you quiet.

255
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,550
My little ballerina is charming,
but such a bore.

256
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,359
She'll only dance to
Mendelssohn's "Spring Song",

257
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,431
and it gets so monotonous.

258
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,355
My next is very conventional,
I'm afraid.

259
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,318
But you can never tell
how these things will turn out.

260
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,278
It was an experiment with seaweed.

261
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,794
Normal size has been my difficulty.

262
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,030
You did achieve size.

263
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,270
I need to work that out with you.

264
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,914
But this isn't science.

265
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,956
It's more like black magic.

266
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,158
You think I'm mad. Perhaps I am.

267
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,071
But listen, Henry Frankenstein,

268
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,119
while you were digging in your graves
piecing together dead tissues,

269
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,193
I, my dear pupil, went for my material
to the source of life.

270
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,959
I grew my creatures, like cultures.
Grew them as nature does, from seed.

271
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,909
But, still, you did achieve
results that I have missed. Now, think.

272
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,515
What a world-astounding
collaboration we should be,

273
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,831
you and I, together.

274
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,558
No. No, no, no.

275
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,950
Leave the charnel house
and follow the lead of nature,

276
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,032
or of God, if you like
your Bible stories.

277
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,318
Male and female, created He them.

278
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,880
Be fruitful and multiply.

279
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,796
Create a race, a man-made race
upon the face of the earth. Why not?

280
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,633
I daren't. I daren't even think
of such a thing.

281
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,632
Our mad dream is only half realised.

282
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,393
Alone you have created a man.

283
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,871
Now together we will create his mate.

284
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,678
You mean?

285
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,270
Yes, a woman.

286
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,272
That should be really interesting.

287
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,558
Please don't touch me!

288
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,353
- There she is! Quick!

289
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,271
There he is. Shoot.

290
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,630
Run to the village, quick.
It's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.

291
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,274
- What is it now?
- The monster! He's in the woods.

292
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,830
Get the bloodhounds. Raise all the
men you can, lock the women indoors

293
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,911
and wait for me.

294
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,789
Now then! Monster, indeed!
I'll show him. Follow me.

295
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,676
Where is he?

296
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,509
Bind him securely.
I don't want anything slipshod.

297
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,195
Tie his feet first. His feet first!

298
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,317
I get no cooperation. None at all.

299
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,153
Have you got him? That's what
I want to know. Have you got him?

300
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,276
Of course we've got him,
my good woman.

301
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,352
A good job too.
Mind he don't get loose again.

302
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,273
He might do some damage
and hurt somebody.

303
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,717
- Bring him down when you've bound him.
- You want any help there? I'll bind him!

304
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,276
Now take him down to the old dungeon
and put him in chains.

305
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,678
There you are.
Find some rope and tie him up.

306
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,110
Come on, then. Get back to your work.

307
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,279
Keep still.

308
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,350
That's quite enough. Come and lock your
doors. We can't take all day over this.

309
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:01,356
I'd hate to find him under my bed at night.
He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.

310
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,954
Get away, there! Clear that window!

311
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,352
Hah! You mind your own business and
see he doesn't get out. He's dangerous.

312
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,908
Now I can get back
to more important duties.

313
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,479
- Way past our hours.
- Hm?

314
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,711
- The night, sir.
- Monster, indeed.

315
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,791
Tush, tush.

316
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,871
He's loose! Shoot him!

317
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,951
Help! He's loose!

318
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,629
Go to your homes.
Just an escaped lunatic.

319
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,395
Merely wanted someone to handle it,
that's all. Quite harmless.

320
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,592
Shoot him! Why don't you shoot him?

321
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,150
Where's Frieda?

322
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,189
Frieda! Frieda!

323
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,077
- Frieda? Where's Frieda?
- She just left.

324
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,594
- Oh, look!

325
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,557
Frieda! Oh, what have they done to you?

326
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,275
Mrs Newman. Oh! Come on!

327
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,876
- Poor old Newman.
- Where's his wife, Frau Newman?

328
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,359
Frau Newman.

329
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,354
- Frau Newman!
- Frau Newman!

330
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,431
Frau Newman!

331
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,470
There's another one in there.

332
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,869
- Frau Newman.

333
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,760
Aurora, you stay close to me.

334
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,596
We'd better get away from these parts.

335
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,399
- It isn't safe.
- Why?

336
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,472
I'm frightened. The monster.

337
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,189
Ah, there's no danger. He's safe
in jail and they'll keep him there.

338
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,556
Where's the pepper and salt?
We got no pepper and salt.

339
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,790
All right, Mother. I'll get it.

340
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,235
Don't worry. You shall have your meat.

341
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,719
Ah.

342
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,111
Get away from there.

343
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,353
Who's there?

344
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,949
Who is it?

345
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,873
You're welcome, my friend,
whoever you are.

346
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,951
Who are you?

347
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,757
I think you're a stranger to me.

348
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,876
I cannot see you. I cannot see anything.

349
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,951
You must please excuse me,
but I am blind.

350
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,830
Come in, my poor friend.

351
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,911
No one will hurt you here.

352
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,917
If you're in trouble,
perhaps I can help you.

353
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,709
But you need not tell me about it
if you don't want to.

354
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,836
- What's the matter?

355
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,711
You're hurt, my poor friend.

356
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,554
Come.

357
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,951
Sit down.

358
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,199
Now tell me, who are you?

359
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,951
I don't understand.

360
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,831
Can you not speak?

361
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,950
It's strange.

362
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,952
Perhaps... perhaps you're afflicted too.

363
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,112
I cannot see and you cannot speak.

364
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,191
Is that it?

365
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,913
If you understand what I'm saying,
put your hand on my shoulder.

366
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,951
That is good.

367
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,554
No, you stay here.

368
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,631
I'll get you some food.

369
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,789
We shall be friends.

370
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:25,110
I have prayed many times
for God to send me a friend.

371
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,473
It's very lonely here,
and it's been a long time

372
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,870
since any human being
came into this hut.

373
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,838
I shall look after you,

374
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,992
and you will comfort me.

375
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,951
Now you must lie down,

376
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,111
and go to sleep.

377
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:03,069
Yes, yes, now you must sleep.

378
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,991
Our Father, I thank thee,

379
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,438
that, in thy great mercy, thou hast
taken pity on my great loneliness.

380
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,080
And now, out of the
silence of the night,

381
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,755
hath brought two
of thy lonely children together,

382
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,274
and sent me a friend

383
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:32,071
to be a light to mine eyes
and a comfort in time of trouble.

384
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,878
Amen.

385
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,359
And now for our lesson.

386
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,432
Remember, this is bread.

387
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,033
Bread.

388
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,471
Bread.

389
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,517
And this is wine... to drink.

390
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,431
- Drink.
- Drink.

391
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,598
Good. Good.

392
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,148
We are friends, you and I.

393
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,312
- Friends.
- Friends.

394
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,278
- Good.
- Good!

395
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,478
And now for a smoke.

396
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,553
No, no. This is good.

397
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,473
Smoke. You try.

398
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,352
Smoke.

399
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,351
Good, good.

400
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,831
Good.

401
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,077
Before you came, I was all alone.

402
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,515
It is bad to be alone.

403
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,636
Alone.

404
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,392
Bad.

405
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,554
Friend. Good. Friend. Good.

406
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,591
Now, come here.

407
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,351
And what is this?

408
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,756
This is wood for the fire.

409
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,471
Wood.

410
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,516
- And this is fire.

411
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,672
No, no. Fire is good.

412
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,955
Fire no good.

413
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,672
There is good and there is bad.

414
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,354
Good. Bad.

415
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,871
Good.

416
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,516
Music?

417
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,392
Can you tell us how to get out
of this wood? We've lost our way.

418
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,630
Come in, friends, and rest a while.

419
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,031
- Look.
- It's the monster.

420
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,155
What are you doing? This is my friend.

421
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,710
Friend? This is the fiend that's
been murdering half the countryside.

422
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,075
Good heavens, man, can't you see?

423
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,435
Oh, he's blind.

424
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,479
He isn't human. Frankenstein
made him out of dead bodies.

425
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,152
My friend. Why do you do this?

426
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,791
Friend.

427
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,194
Look.

428
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:40,029
Which way did he go?

429
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,271
This way! He's gone this way!

430
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,271
Friend.

431
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,036
- I can smell the ghosts already.
- I never could stand graves.

432
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,917
Shut up and follow me.

433
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,433
Read the inscription. What does it say?

434
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:07,996
"Died 1899. Maddalena Ernestine,
beloved daughter of..."

435
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,674
Oh, never mind that. How old was she?

436
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,310
"Aged 19 years, three months."

437
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,675
Well, that's the one. Get to work.

438
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,273
- What are you waiting for?
- Mercy on us.

439
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,114
- You want me to send you to the
gallows? - Could be no worse than this.

440
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,794
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.

441
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,871
Here goes.

442
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,156
Pretty little thing, in
her way, wasn't she?

443
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,958
I hope her bones are firm.

444
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:56,273
- It seems lighter now.
- Yes.

445
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,635
Well, Doctor, I guess
that's all for tonight.

446
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,871
- Can we go home now?
- Yes. I shall wait here for a bit.

447
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,030
I rather like this place.

448
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,588
- Be careful nobody sees you leave.
- We know.

449
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:12,468
- And leave me that lantern down there.
- All right, all right.

450
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:25,635
If there's more like this,
what do you say, pal?

451
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,915
We give ourselves up
and let 'em hang us?

452
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,879
- That goes for me too.
- This is no life for murderers.

453
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,836
I give you the monster.

454
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,396
Oh.

455
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,598
I thought I was alone. Good evening.

456
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,671
Smoke.

457
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,036
- Friend.
- Yes, I hope so.

458
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:23,669
Have a cigar. They are my only weakness.

459
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,072
Good, good.

460
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,075
Drink. Good.

461
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,151
Good.

462
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,237
You make man like me?

463
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:03,709
No. Woman.

464
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,309
- Friend for you.
- Woman?

465
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,039
Friend. Yes.

466
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,714
I want friend. Like me.

467
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,075
I think you can be very useful.

468
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,517
And you will add a little force
to the argument, if necessary.

469
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,037
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is?
And who you are?

470
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,190
Yes. I know.

471
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,920
Made me from dead.

472
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,311
I love dead.

473
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,630
Hate living.

474
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,280
You're wise in your generation.

475
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,229
We must have a long talk, and then
I have an important call to make.

476
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,153
Woman. Friend.

477
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,035
Wife.

478
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,435
That Dr Pretorius is here again, sir.

479
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,590
There, I knew it.

480
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:11,195
- Send him away. I won't see him.
- I certainly will.

481
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,311
Good evening, Henry.

482
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,468
Baroness, I've not yet
had the opportunity

483
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,870
of offering you
my congratulations on your marriage.

484
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:27,509
- Pray accept them now.
- Dr Pretorius.

485
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,478
I don't know what your business is
but, whatever it may be,

486
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,472
I tell you frankly that I am
not frightened of it or of you.

487
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,712
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state
to be alarmed or annoyed.

488
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,075
Your visit now is most unwelcome.

489
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,514
Henry, I heard the carriage drive up.
I'll see that the baggage is put in.

490
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,234
Then we're leaving.

491
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,194
I think you know why I am here, Henry.

492
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:03,391
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiments is complete.

493
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:09,191
I have created, by my method, a perfect
human brain - already living, but dormant.

494
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,955
Everything is now ready for you and me
to begin our supreme collaboration.

495
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,919
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
I don't want to hear.

496
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,198
I've changed my mind. I won't do it.

497
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,952
I expected this.

498
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,789
I thought we might need
another assistant.

499
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,951
Perhaps he can persuade you.

500
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,597
- Nothing can persuade me.
- We shall see.

501
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,429
- No! Not that! - Oh, he's
harmless, except when crossed.

502
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,792
Frankenstein.

503
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,310
Yes, there have been developments
since he came to me.

504
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,750
Sit down.

505
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,150
- What do you want?
- You know.

506
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,549
- This is your work.
- Yes.

507
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,710
I'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

508
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,076
- Yes. Must.
- Get him out.

509
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,071
I won't even discuss it until he's gone.

510
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,511
Go now.

511
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,151
Go.

512
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,469
- Must do it.
- Nothing can make me go on with it.

513
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,870
Now.

514
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,878
Put the bags in the carriage
and I'll be out in a moment.

515
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,794
Go and tell the master to hurry,
Minnie, or we shall lose the train.

516
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,473
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady,

517
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,028
but I don't like leaving you alone.

518
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,272
- Oh, nonsense, Minnie, I shall be
all right. - I hope so, milady.

519
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,031
Is that you, Henry?

520
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,271
Henry! Henry, help!

521
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,954
Henry!

522
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,156
Milady!

523
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:06,639
- Elizabeth.

524
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,876
What is it? What's the matter?

525
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,155
Oh, sir, she's gone!

526
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,834
The monster, he's got her!

527
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,878
I saw it. The baroness is gone!

528
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,155
This is Pretorius' doing. Quick, search
parties. There's not a moment to lose.

529
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,918
I charge you,
as you value your mistress' life,

530
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,151
to do nothing
and say nothing of this episode.

531
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,277
I assure you that the baroness
will be safely returned,

532
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,749
if you will leave everything to me.

533
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:44,434
Nothing, that is,
except what he demands.

534
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,071
I can find no trace of Elizabeth.

535
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,233
Oh, I admit I'm beaten.

536
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,793
But if you can bring her back,

537
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,030
I'll do anything that you want.

538
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,510
Are you ready to complete with me
this final experiment?

539
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,114
- What about Elizabeth?
- She is well,

540
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,875
and will be safely returned
if you will proceed.

541
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,595
- I'm ready.
- Ah.

542
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,073
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, I expect.

543
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,151
I think it's a charming house.

544
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,552
It is interesting to think
that once upon a time

545
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,599
we should have been burnt at the stake
as wizards for this experiment.

546
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,592
Doctor, I think the heart is beating.

547
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,433
Look. It's beating.

548
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:24,638
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
- Increase the saline solution.

549
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:32,552
- Is there any life yet?
- No, not life itself yet.

550
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,200
This is only the simulacrum of life.

551
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,750
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

552
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,391
We must be patient. The heart is more
complex than any other part of the body.

553
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,954
Look. The beat is increasing.

554
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,349
Yes...

555
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,753
- It's stopped.
- Shall I increase the current?

556
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,994
This heart is useless.

557
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,313
I must have another.
And it must be sound and young.

558
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,431
Karl.

559
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,557
You must go to your friend
at the accident hospital.

560
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,952
What we need is a female victim
of sudden death. Can you do it?

561
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,554
If you promise me a thousand crowns.

562
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,916
It will be well worth it,
and the baron will pay.

563
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,436
- Yes, yes. Go and get it.
- I'll try.

564
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,552
There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

565
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,835
Always.

566
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,990
I'll get your heart.

567
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,311
I'll go into that room, I'll go into
that room and I'll take my knife out.

568
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,039
I'll get her. I'll hold her down
and there she'll be.

569
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,429
Where, I ask you? Where will she be?

570
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,871
A thousand crowns.

571
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,550
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.

572
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:12,110
- Oh, if only I can keep it going
until... - It was a very fresh one.

573
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,550
Where did you get it?

574
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,598
I gave the gendarme 50 crowns.

575
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,036
- What gendarme?
- It was a...

576
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,638
- police case.
- Yes, very sad.

577
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:31,190
Only, we can't bother about that now.
Can I do anything?

578
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,592
No, no, no! I can work better alone.

579
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,315
- Work.
- Where's Elizabeth?

580
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,075
- Have you brought her?
- She wait. I wait.

581
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,038
I'm exhausted. I must get sleep.

582
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:05,590
Work. Finish. Then sleep.

583
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,275
But I can't work like this.
He must go away. Send him away.

584
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,635
I'll settle him for a little while.

585
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,831
Drink.

586
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,231
Drink.

587
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,756
Good.

588
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,751
That'll keep you quiet.

589
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,428
Elizabeth - she's dead.

590
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,034
Elizabeth is alive and she is well.

591
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:06,796
- I don't believe you.
- I have proof.

592
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,793
- Proof?
- In a few moments from now,

593
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,634
she will speak to you from where she is
through this electrical machine.

594
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,758
- Where is she?
- Not far from here.

595
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,993
Speak, and she will hear you and answer.

596
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,877
Yes, yes, this is Henry.

597
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:31,114
Henry, yes, I'm safe. But, oh, Henry,
how long? Come for me. I'm in...

598
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,555
Elizabeth? Elizabeth!

599
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:37,550
- She's gone.
- That is all now. But you heard her.

600
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,915
Yes, she's alive.

601
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,436
As soon as our work is completed
she will be returned to you.

602
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,714
The heart is beating more regularly now.

603
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:54,632
Yes, it's been beating for nine hours.

604
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,673
Not yet, but soon...

605
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,435
- And the brain?
- Perfect and already in position.

606
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,751
- Then we are almost ready.
- Almost.

607
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,476
Shall we put the heart in now?

608
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,831
- Yes.
- Ludwig.

609
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,436
It's beating quite normally now.

610
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,511
Bring it over.

611
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,438
- The storm is rising.
- All right.

612
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,310
The air is heavy with electricity.

613
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,436
It's going to be a terrific storm.

614
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,351
We shall be ready.

615
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:09,877
Isn't it amazing, Henry,
that lying here within this cowl

616
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,997
is an artificially
developed human brain?

617
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,995
Each cell, each convolution ready,
waiting for life to come.

618
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,516
Look. The storm is coming up
over the mountains.

619
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,070
- It will be here soon.
- The kites. Are the kites ready?

620
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,958
- Yes. - Send them up as
soon as the wind rises.

621
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:33,430
- Hurry, hurry!
- The kites, the kites, get 'em ready.

622
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,951
Ludwig!

623
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,431
He wants the kites!

624
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,711
Stand back.

625
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,311
Careful on the roof!

626
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,356
The big diffuser!

627
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,356
Wires! Slip down your wires!

628
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:41,628
All right. Stop your winches.
I'm coming up!

629
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,470
- Now, off with the kites!
- You take number two, Ludwig.

630
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,153
- Have you made your connections?
- Yes.

631
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,231
Stand by!

632
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,031
Let go of number one!

633
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,951
Let her go!

634
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,950
It's coming up!

635
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,871
- Go back. Go back down!

636
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,951
Go back!

637
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:16,633
No! Get away! Frankenstein!

638
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,280
Get away! Get away!

639
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,917
Don't come near me!

640
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,398
Get away! Don't! No! No!

641
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,796
Don't! Don't!

642
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,155
Raise the cosmic diffuser.

643
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,990
Remove the diffuser bands.

644
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:39,279
She's alive! Alive!

645
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,548
The bride of Frankenstein.

646
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:21,358
Friend?

647
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,792
Friend?

648
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,190
- Stand back. Stand back.

649
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:17,799
She hate me. Like others.

650
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:33,433
- Look out! The lever!
- Get away from that lever!

651
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,394
You'll blow us all to atoms.

652
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,793
Henry!

653
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,519
Open the door! Henry!

654
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,275
- Get back! Get back!
- I won't unless you come!

655
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,670
But I can't leave them! I can't!

656
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,389
Yes, go! You live!

657
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,796
Go!

658
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,035
You stay.

659
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,270
We belong dead.

660
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,591
Darling, darling.
