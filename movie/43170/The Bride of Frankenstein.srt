1
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:30,000
<b>The Bride of Frankenstein by TenEightyMan</b>

2
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,703
How beautifully dramatic.

3
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:30,334
The crudest savage exhibition
of nature at her worst without...

4
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,959
And we three,

5
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:34,879
we elegant three within.

6
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,465
I should like to think
that an irate Jehovah

7
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,676
was pointing those arrows of
lightning directly at my head,

8
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:44,429
the unbowed head of
George Gordon Lord Byron,

9
00:02:44,514 --> 00:02:46,223
England's greatest sinner.

10
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,934
But I cannot flatter
myself to that extent.

11
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,312
Possibly those thunders
are for our dear Shelley,

12
00:02:52,396 --> 00:02:55,064
heaven's applause for
England's greatest poet.

13
00:02:55,565 --> 00:02:56,816
What of my Mary?

14
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,818
She is an angel.

15
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,611
You think so.

16
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,782
You hear?

17
00:03:05,283 --> 00:03:07,909
Come, Mary.
Come and watch the storm.

18
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:10,453
You know how
lightning alarms me.

19
00:03:10,913 --> 00:03:13,998
Shelley, darling,
will you please light these candles for me?

20
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:16,793
Oh, Mary, darling.

21
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,836
Astonishing creature.

22
00:03:19,212 --> 00:03:21,004
I, Lord Byron?

23
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,674
Frightened of thunder,
fearful of the dark,

24
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,175
and yet you have
written a tale

25
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,469
that sent my blood
into icy creeps.

26
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:29,471
Look at her, Shelley.

27
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:33,474
Can you believe that bland and lovely
brow conceived of Frankenstein,

28
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:37,770
a monster created from cadavers out of rifled graves?

29
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:39,605
Isn't it astonishing?

30
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,732
I don't know why
you should think so.

31
00:03:41,817 --> 00:03:43,275
What do you expect?

32
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:45,694
Such an audience
needs something stronger

33
00:03:45,778 --> 00:03:47,737
than a pretty
little love story.

34
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,990
So, why shouldn't
I write of monsters?

35
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,867
No wonder Murray has refused to publish the book.

36
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,244
He says his reading public
would be too shocked.

37
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:56,579
It will be published,
I think.

38
00:03:56,663 --> 00:03:59,206
Then, darling, you will
have much to answer for.

39
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:05,004
The publishers did not see that my
purpose was to write a moral lesson

40
00:04:05,088 --> 00:04:10,383
of the punishment that befell a mortal
man who dared to emulate God.

41
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,051
Well, whatever your purpose
may have been, my dear,

42
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:15,555
I take great relish in savoring each separate horror.

43
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,557
I roll them over
on my tongue.

44
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,893
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.

45
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:24,062
What a setting in that churchyard,
to begin with.

46
00:04:24,147 --> 00:04:28,650
The sobbing women,
the first clod of earth on the coffin.

47
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:30,444
That was a pretty chill.

48
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:32,486
Frankenstein and the dwarf

49
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:35,156
stealing the body
out of its new-made grave,

50
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,658
cutting the hanged man
down from the gallows,

51
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:40,119
where he swung
creaking in the wind.

52
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,371
The cunning of Frankenstein
in his mountain laboratory,

53
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:47,667
taking dead men apart and
building up a human monster,

54
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:49,669
so fearful
and so horrible,

55
00:04:49,754 --> 00:04:52,505
that only a half-crazed brain could have devised.

56
00:04:53,174 --> 00:04:55,007
And then the murders...

57
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:57,718
The little child drowned.

58
00:04:58,136 --> 00:04:59,845
Henry Frankenstein himself

59
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,597
thrown from the top
of the burning mill

60
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:03,515
by the very monster
he had created.

61
00:05:04,184 --> 00:05:09,604
And it was these fragile white
fingers that penned the nightmare.

62
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:13,191
Oh! You've made me
prick myself, Byron.

63
00:05:13,776 --> 00:05:15,360
It's bleeding.

64
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,737
There, there.

65
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:21,615
I do think it a shame, Mary,
to end your story quite so suddenly.

66
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:23,325
That wasn't the end at all.

67
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,994
Would you like to hear
what happened after that?

68
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:28,455
I feel like telling it.

69
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:31,916
It's the perfect night
for mystery and horror.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,378
The air itself
is filled with monsters.

71
00:05:35,462 --> 00:05:37,046
I'm all ears.

72
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:41,634
While heaven blasts the night without,
open up your pits of hell.

73
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:46,596
Well, then,
imagine yourself standing by the wreckage of the mill.

74
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,848
The fire is dying down.

75
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,353
Soon the bare skeleton of the building will be visible,

76
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:56,230
the gaunt rafters
against the sky.

77
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:20,168
Well, I must say,
that's the best fire I ever saw in all me life!

78
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:23,755
What are you crying for?

79
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,007
It's terrible.

80
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:27,592
I know it's terrible,
but after all them murders,

81
00:06:27,677 --> 00:06:30,262
and poor Mr. Henry
being brought home to die,

82
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,682
I'm glad to see the monster roasted
to death before my very eyes.

83
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:35,891
It's too good for him.

84
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,061
It's all the Devil's work,

85
00:06:39,146 --> 00:06:42,273
and you better cross yourself quick, Marta,
before he gets you.

86
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,569
Come along, come along.
It's all over.

87
00:06:47,778 --> 00:06:50,280
Get back to your homes.
Go to sleep.

88
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:52,282
Whoo!

89
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:56,744
There it goes again!
It ain't burned out at all. There's more yet.

90
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:58,787
Isn't the monster dead yet?

91
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:02,458
It's high time every decent man and wife was in bed.

92
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:05,961
That's his insides,
caught at last.

93
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:08,880
Insides is always
the last to be consumed.

94
00:07:08,964 --> 00:07:11,549
Move on.
You've had enough excitement for one night.

95
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:15,136
This strange man you call a monster is dead.

96
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,555
"Monster," indeed.

97
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:20,057
You may thank
your lucky stars

98
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,101
they sent for me to safeguard life and property.

99
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:26,313
Why didn't you safeguard those
what lies drowned and murdered?

100
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:30,233
Come now.
We want no rioting. No riots.

101
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:31,400
Who's rioting?

102
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,693
Move on, move on.

103
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:35,529
Good night, all,
and pleasant dreams.

104
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,990
Ah, pleasant dreams,
yourself.

105
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:42,369
Thinks he's everybody,
just because he's the burgomaster.

106
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,167
Poor Mr. Henry.

107
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,419
He was to have
been married today

108
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,505
to that lovely girl,
Elizabeth.

109
00:07:53,589 --> 00:07:54,880
Cover him up.

110
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:58,133
Someone must break the news to the poor girl.

111
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,594
Ride as fast as you can to the castle

112
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:04,515
and tell the old Baron Frankenstein
we are bringing his son home.

113
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,183
Oh, dear.

114
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,810
Oh, shut up.

115
00:08:10,687 --> 00:08:14,065
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.

116
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:16,901
Nothing could be left
alive in that furnace.

117
00:08:16,985 --> 00:08:18,568
Why do you stay here?

118
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:22,030
I want to see
with me own eyes.

119
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,449
Oh, Hans,
he must be dead.

120
00:08:24,534 --> 00:08:29,079
And dead or alive,
nothing can bring our little Maria back to us.

121
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:32,331
If I can see
his blackened bones,

122
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:33,916
I can sleep at night.

123
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:36,377
Come back, Hans!

124
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,212
You will be
burned yourself!

125
00:08:38,296 --> 00:08:40,464
Maria drowned to death
and you burned up.

126
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,549
What should I do then?

127
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,592
No!

128
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:07,572
Ah!

129
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:28,216
Hans! Hans, where are you?

130
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,843
Hans! Are you all right?

131
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:35,514
I hear you. Here.

132
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,558
Give me your hand, Hans.

133
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,603
Here.

134
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,330
Oh, heaven,
what is this?

135
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,168
Henry.

136
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:54,419
Tell me.

137
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:58,173
Oh, milady,
how can we tell you?

138
00:11:05,056 --> 00:11:06,472
Bring him in.

139
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:19,859
Albert!

140
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,236
What do you want?

141
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,614
It's alive!
The monster... It's alive!

142
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:27,951
Oh, shut up,
you old fool.

143
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,286
I saw it.

144
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,246
It ain't turned
to no skeleton at all.

145
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,581
It lived right
through the fire.

146
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:37,960
Go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.

147
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,170
Nobody'll believe me.

148
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:42,797
All right.
I wash my hands of it.

149
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:46,801
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds,
for all of me. Hmph!

150
00:12:16,204 --> 00:12:17,621
Speak to me, Henry.

151
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, milady,
he'll never speak again.

152
00:12:22,084 --> 00:12:24,252
I was foretold of this.

153
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:26,880
I was told
beware my wedding night.

154
00:12:33,928 --> 00:12:35,095
Ahhh!

155
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:39,183
Oh! Look! Milady!
He's alive!

156
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,561
Henry, darling!

157
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:47,482
Elizabeth.

158
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:52,904
Oh, what a terrible wedding night!

159
00:13:07,793 --> 00:13:10,127
You can go
to bed now, Mary.

160
00:13:19,553 --> 00:13:20,720
You'll soon
be better, Henry.

161
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,680
I feel almost myself again.

162
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,557
As soon as you're strong enough,
we'll go away

163
00:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,851
and forget all this
horrible experience.

164
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,144
Forget?

165
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:32,648
If only I could forget,
but it's never out of my mind.

166
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:36,402
I've been cursed for delving into the mysteries of life.

167
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:40,489
Perhaps death is sacred,
and I've profaned it.

168
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:43,658
For what a wonderful
vision it was!

169
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:47,286
I dreamed of being the first to give to the world

170
00:13:47,371 --> 00:13:50,623
the secret that God
is so jealous of.

171
00:13:50,707 --> 00:13:53,167
The formula for life.

172
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:57,546
Think of the power
to create a man.

173
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:01,508
And I did. I did it!
I created a man. And who knows?

174
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,052
In time I could have trained him to do my will.

175
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,054
I could have bred a race.

176
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,556
I might even have found
the secret of eternal life.

177
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,725
Henry, don't say those things.
Don't think them.

178
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,477
It's blasphemous
and wicked.

179
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:15,187
We are not meant
to know those things.

180
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,898
It may be that I'm intended to know the secret of life.

181
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,110
It may be part
of the divine plan.

182
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,738
No. No! It's the Devil
that prompts you.

183
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,992
It's death, not life,
that is in it all and at the end of it all.

184
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,701
Listen, Henry.

185
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:33,287
While you have been lying here,
tossing in your delirium,

186
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,872
I couldn't sleep.

187
00:14:34,956 --> 00:14:37,416
And when you raved
of your insane desire

188
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,253
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

189
00:14:41,337 --> 00:14:45,006
a strange apparition has seemed to appear in the room.

190
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,300
It comes,
a figure like death,

191
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,219
and each time it comes
more clearly, nearer.

192
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:52,138
It seems to be
reaching out for you

193
00:14:52,222 --> 00:14:53,973
as if it would
take you away from me!

194
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:58,643
There it is!
Look! There!

195
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,979
I see nothing, Elizabeth.
Where?

196
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:03,148
There's nothing there.

197
00:15:03,232 --> 00:15:07,818
There! There! It's coming for you!
Nearer! Henry!

198
00:15:07,903 --> 00:15:10,154
Henry! Henry! Henry!

199
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,833
Albert!

200
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:26,794
Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.

201
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:29,422
What's the good of stuffed footmen, anyway?

202
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,925
All right. All right!

203
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,012
Don't knock the castle over.
We're not all dead yet.

204
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:48,898
There's nobody at home.

205
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,399
Let me in,
my good woman.

206
00:15:50,484 --> 00:15:53,361
I know the young Baron Frankenstein is at home.

207
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:54,444
He's sick.

208
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:56,238
He's in his bed,
where all decent folk

209
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,989
should be at
this time of night.

210
00:15:58,074 --> 00:16:00,784
Tell him that
Dr. Pretorius is here

211
00:16:00,868 --> 00:16:03,537
on a secret matter
of grave importance

212
00:16:03,621 --> 00:16:06,789
and must see him
alone, tonight.

213
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,377
Dr. Pretorius?

214
00:16:11,461 --> 00:16:13,254
Pretorius?

215
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:19,717
What was the...
What was the name?

216
00:16:19,802 --> 00:16:21,761
Dr. Pretorius.

217
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,806
Ain't no such name.

218
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:36,066
Now you stay there.

219
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:42,989
Who's there?

220
00:16:43,073 --> 00:16:44,574
It's Minnie, milady.

221
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:46,325
Oh, come in.

222
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:51,038
It's Dr. Pretorius.

223
00:16:51,123 --> 00:16:54,916
He says he wants to see the master.
Most insistent.

224
00:16:55,001 --> 00:16:56,585
Pretorius?

225
00:16:56,669 --> 00:16:59,212
He's a very queer-looking
old gentleman, sir,

226
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:03,466
and must see you on a secret grave matter,
he said.

227
00:17:03,551 --> 00:17:05,510
Tonight, alone.

228
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,177
Bring him in.

229
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:08,929
Henry, who is this man?

230
00:17:09,014 --> 00:17:10,973
Dr. Pretorius.

231
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:17,438
Baron Frankenstein,
now, I believe.

232
00:17:17,564 --> 00:17:19,606
Won't you come in, Doctor?

233
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,901
I trust you will pardon this intrusion at so late an hour.

234
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:25,987
I would not have
ventured to come

235
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:27,780
had I not
a communication to make,

236
00:17:27,865 --> 00:17:31,617
which I suspect may be of the
utmost importance to yourself.

237
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:33,869
This is Professor Pretorius.

238
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:37,623
He used to be Doctor of
Philosophy at the university, but...

239
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,666
But was booted out.

240
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:44,420
"Booted," my dear Baron,
is the word for knowing too much.

241
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:47,882
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.

242
00:17:47,966 --> 00:17:50,301
I am also
a doctor, Baroness.

243
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:52,470
Why have you
come here tonight?

244
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:55,597
My business with you,
Baron, is private.

245
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,891
Elizabeth, please.

246
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,649
I do hope
he won't upset Henry.

247
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:10,402
What do you want?

248
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,571
We must work together.

249
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:16,033
Never. This is outrageous.

250
00:18:16,117 --> 00:18:20,912
I'm through with it.
I'll have no more of this hell's spawn.

251
00:18:20,996 --> 00:18:24,874
As soon as I'm well,
I'm to be married, and I'm going away.

252
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,126
I must beg you
to reconsider.

253
00:18:27,378 --> 00:18:30,253
You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

254
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:33,465
who are responsible
for all those murders?

255
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,053
There are penalties to pay
for killing people,

256
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:41,264
and with your creature still at large in the countryside...

257
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:42,973
Are you threatening me?

258
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,851
Don't put it so crudely.

259
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:48,771
I have ventured to hope
that you and I together,

260
00:18:48,855 --> 00:18:52,858
no longer as master and pupil,
but as fellow scientists,

261
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:55,568
might probe the mysteries
of life and death...

262
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,320
Never. No further.

263
00:18:57,405 --> 00:19:00,323
...and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

264
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:04,285
I can't make any further experiments.
I've had a terrible lesson.

265
00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:07,204
That is sad, very sad.

266
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,998
But you and I
have gone too far to stop.

267
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,960
Nor can it be
stopped so easily.

268
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:16,046
I also have continued
with my experiments.

269
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,548
That is why
I am here tonight.

270
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:21,050
You must see my creation.

271
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:25,346
Have you also succeeded in bringing life to the dead?

272
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:29,058
If you, Herr Baron,
will do me the honor of visiting my humble abode,

273
00:19:29,143 --> 00:19:32,310
I think you will be interested
in what I have to show you.

274
00:19:32,478 --> 00:19:37,733
After 20 years of secret scientific
research and countless failures,

275
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:43,821
I also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

276
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:47,241
I must know.
When can I see it?

277
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:49,910
I thought you might
change your mind.

278
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:53,164
Why not tonight?
It is not very late.

279
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:55,373
Is it far?

280
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,168
No, but you will
need a coat.

281
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:11,013
I think your coachman
had better wait here.

282
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,200
Won't you sit down,
Herr Baron?

283
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,832
Before I show you the results of my trifling experiments,

284
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,085
I would like to drink
to our partnership.

285
00:20:45,754 --> 00:20:49,507
Do you like gin?
It is my only weakness.

286
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:56,471
To a new world
of gods and monsters!

287
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,603
The creation of
life is enthralling.

288
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:06,605
Distinctly enthralling,
is it not?

289
00:21:06,689 --> 00:21:10,692
I cannot account precisely for
all that I am going to show you,

290
00:21:10,777 --> 00:21:15,197
but perhaps now that
you are my partner, you can.

291
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:59,863
My experiments did not turn out quite like yours, Henry,

292
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:05,909
but science, like love,
has her little surprises, as you shall see.

293
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,037
Good heavens, Doctor.
What are these?

294
00:22:09,122 --> 00:22:12,541
There is a pleasing
variety about my exhibits.

295
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,504
My first experiment was so lovely
that we made her a queen.

296
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,637
Charming,
don't you think?

297
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:30,390
Then, of course,
we had to have a king.

298
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:36,479
Now he's so madly in love with her
that we have to segregate them.

299
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,649
Now, now.

300
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,735
I have to be very careful
with the king.

301
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,573
Now, behave.

302
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,410
My next production looked so
disapprovingly at the other two

303
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,329
that they made him
an archbishop.

304
00:22:54,413 --> 00:22:57,373
He seems to be asleep.
I must wake him up.

305
00:23:00,294 --> 00:23:03,838
The next one
is the very Devil.

306
00:23:04,173 --> 00:23:06,340
Very bizarre,
this little chap.

307
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:08,967
There's a certain resemblance to me,
don't you think?

308
00:23:09,052 --> 00:23:11,094
Or do I flatter myself?

309
00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:13,472
I took a great deal
of pains with him.

310
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:15,724
Sometimes I have wondered

311
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,725
whether life wouldn't be
much more amusing

312
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:24,065
if we were all devils,
and no nonsense about angels and being good.

313
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:26,400
Oh! There's
the king out again.

314
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:32,781
Even royal amours
are a nuisance.

315
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:45,918
Poor archbishop.
He has his hands full.

316
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:50,255
There. That will
keep you quiet.

317
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,716
My little ballerina is charming,
but such a bore.

318
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,761
She won't dance to anything
but Mendelssohn's Spring Song,

319
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:59,389
and it gets so monotonous.

320
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:01,975
My next is very conventional,
I'm afraid,

321
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,811
but you can never tell how these things will turn out.

322
00:24:05,062 --> 00:24:08,146
It was an experiment with seaweed.

323
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:10,607
Normal size has
been my difficulty.

324
00:24:10,858 --> 00:24:13,110
You did achieve size.

325
00:24:13,194 --> 00:24:15,988
I need to work
that out with you.

326
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:24,912
But this isn't science.

327
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,289
It's more like black magic.

328
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:30,792
You think I'm mad.
Perhaps I am.

329
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:32,919
But listen,
Henry Frankenstein.

330
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:35,088
While you were
digging in your graves,

331
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,090
piecing together
dead tissues,

332
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:41,094
I, my dear pupil,
went for my materials to the source of life.

333
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:44,888
I grew my creatures,
like cultures,

334
00:24:44,973 --> 00:24:48,183
grew them as
nature does, from seed.

335
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:52,104
But still,
you did achieve results that I have missed.

336
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:57,233
Now think,
what a world-astounding collaboration we should be,

337
00:24:57,693 --> 00:25:00,278
you and I, together.

338
00:25:00,612 --> 00:25:03,489
No. No, no, no.

339
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:07,284
Leave the charnel house and follow the lead of nature,

340
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:10,495
or of God, if you like
your Bible stories.

341
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,624
"Male and female
created He them."

342
00:25:15,835 --> 00:25:18,627
"Be fruitful and multiply."

343
00:25:18,712 --> 00:25:23,215
Create a race, a man-made race,
upon the face of the earth.

344
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,633
Why not?

345
00:25:24,718 --> 00:25:27,595
I daren't! I daren't
even think of such a thing.

346
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,722
Our mad dream is
only half realized.

347
00:25:30,806 --> 00:25:33,641
Alone, you have
created a man.

348
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:38,271
Now, together,
we will create his mate.

349
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:41,066
You mean...

350
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:44,693
Yes. A woman.

351
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,696
That should be
really interesting.

352
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,339
No.

353
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,607
Don't touch me!

354
00:27:18,905 --> 00:27:20,406
There she is! Quick!

355
00:27:22,868 --> 00:27:24,577
There he is! Shoot!

356
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:35,920
Run to the village, quick!
It's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.

357
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,804
He's in the woods!

358
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,686
What is it now?

359
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,188
The monster,
he's in the woods.

360
00:27:55,272 --> 00:27:57,607
Get out the bloodhounds.
Raise all the men you can.

361
00:27:57,691 --> 00:28:00,484
Lock the women indoors,
and wait for me.

362
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:05,989
Now then!
Monster, indeed.

363
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:07,949
I'll show him.
Follow me.

364
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:11,091
Where is he?

365
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,974
Bind him securely.
I don't want anything slipshod.

366
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:21,725
Tie his feet first.

367
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,686
His feet first!

368
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,855
I get no cooperation,
none at all!

369
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,857
Have you got him?
That's what I want to know.

370
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:30,066
Have you got him?

371
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,110
Of course we've got him,
my good woman.

372
00:29:32,194 --> 00:29:35,280
And a good job, too.
Mind he don't get loose again.

373
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:38,199
He might do some damage
and hurt somebody.

374
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:39,951
Bring him down
when you've bound him.

375
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:43,078
You want any help there?
I'll bind him!

376
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:40,923
Now, take him down to the old dungeon.
Put him in chains.

377
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,192
There you are.
Quite simple.

378
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,110
Now, take him out.

379
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,945
Come on, men.
Get back to your work.

380
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,289
Keep still.

381
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:24,588
Now, that'll do.
That's quite enough.

382
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,090
Now come down
and lock your door.

383
00:31:26,174 --> 00:31:28,008
We can't take
all day over this.

384
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:35,139
I'd hate to find him
under my bed at night.

385
00:31:35,224 --> 00:31:37,392
He's a nightmare
in the daylight, he is.

386
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:40,061
Get away there!
Clear that window!

387
00:31:40,771 --> 00:31:43,271
You mind your own business,
and see he doesn't get out of here.

388
00:31:43,356 --> 00:31:44,731
He's dangerous.

389
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:47,234
Now I can get back to
more important duties.

390
00:31:47,318 --> 00:31:48,443
And leave us to ours.

391
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,404
What?
Good night, sir.

392
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:53,697
Monster, indeed.
Tush, tush.

393
00:32:13,259 --> 00:32:14,384
He's loose!

394
00:32:14,468 --> 00:32:15,677
Shoot him!

395
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,278
Help! He's loose!

396
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,366
Go to your homes.
Just an escaped lunatic.

397
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:42,826
Merely wanted someone to handle it,
that's all.

398
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,161
Quite harmless.

399
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:55,212
Look here.
Why don't you shoot him?

400
00:33:00,051 --> 00:33:02,011
Oh, he's coming!

401
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:09,017
Where's Freida?

402
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:10,435
She's gone.

403
00:33:10,728 --> 00:33:13,146
Freida! Freida!

404
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,941
Freida! Where is Freida?

405
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:19,318
She just left.

406
00:33:19,402 --> 00:33:20,694
Oh, look!

407
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:25,073
Freida!

408
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:26,909
Oh, what have they
done to you?

409
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:30,995
Mrs. Neumann!

410
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,497
Oh! Come on!

411
00:33:32,581 --> 00:33:34,248
Mrs. Neumann!

412
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,172
Poor old Neumann.

413
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:43,882
Where's his wife,
Frau Neumann?

414
00:33:43,966 --> 00:33:48,678
Frau Neumann!

415
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:51,056
Frau Neumann!
Frau Neumann!

416
00:33:57,395 --> 00:33:59,396
There's another one,
in there.

417
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,774
Frau Neumann!

418
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:06,110
Ramona, you stay
close to me.

419
00:34:10,783 --> 00:34:14,327
We'd better get away from these parts.
It isn't safe.

420
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:15,870
Why?

421
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:18,956
I'm frightened.
The monster.

422
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:22,834
Ah! There's no danger. He's safe in jail,
and they'll keep him there.

423
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,338
Where's the pepper and salt?
We've got no pepper and salt.

424
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:29,966
All right, Mother.
I'll get it. Don't worry.

425
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:32,343
You shall have your meat.
Ah!

426
00:34:52,154 --> 00:34:53,779
Get away from there!

427
00:36:06,221 --> 00:36:07,597
Who's there?

428
00:36:54,933 --> 00:36:56,433
Who is it?

429
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,187
You're welcome, my friend,
whoever you are.

430
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,192
Who are you?

431
00:37:08,696 --> 00:37:11,030
I think you're
a stranger to me.

432
00:37:12,574 --> 00:37:14,200
I cannot see you.

433
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:16,452
I cannot see anything.

434
00:37:16,911 --> 00:37:20,539
You must please excuse me,
but I'm blind.

435
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,090
Come in, my poor friend.
No one will hurt you here.

436
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:35,720
If you're in trouble,
perhaps I can help you,

437
00:37:35,804 --> 00:37:38,597
but you need not tell me about it if you don't want to.

438
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,683
What's the matter?

439
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,773
You're hurt,
my poor friend. Come.

440
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:10,543
Sit down.

441
00:38:13,046 --> 00:38:15,548
Now tell me,
who are you?

442
00:38:18,718 --> 00:38:20,677
I don't understand.

443
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,473
Can you not speak?

444
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,226
It's strange.

445
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:32,813
Perhaps... Perhaps you're
afflicted, too.

446
00:38:34,483 --> 00:38:37,568
I cannot see,
and you cannot speak.

447
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:39,361
Is that it?

448
00:38:41,572 --> 00:38:46,242
If you understand what I'm saying,
put your hand on my shoulder.

449
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:51,873
That is good.

450
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:55,459
No.

451
00:38:55,543 --> 00:38:57,127
You stay here.

452
00:38:58,046 --> 00:39:00,088
I'll get you some food.

453
00:39:11,225 --> 00:39:13,184
We shall be friends.

454
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:17,979
I have prayed many times

455
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,190
for God to send me a friend.

456
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,736
It's very lonely here,

457
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:29,114
and it's been a long time since any
human being came into this hut.

458
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:31,992
I shall look after you,

459
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:35,579
and you will comfort me.

460
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:48,049
And now you must
lie down and go to sleep.

461
00:39:55,932 --> 00:39:57,683
Yes, yes.

462
00:39:58,434 --> 00:40:00,477
Now you must sleep.

463
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:08,776
Our Father, I thank Thee,

464
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,487
that in Thy great mercy,

465
00:40:11,572 --> 00:40:14,699
Thou hast taken pity
on my great loneliness,

466
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:17,617
and now, out of
the silence of the night,

467
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:21,121
hast brought two of
Thy lonely children together,

468
00:40:21,497 --> 00:40:23,707
and sent me a friend

469
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,085
to be a light to mine eyes

470
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:30,129
and a comfort
in time of trouble.

471
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,630
Amen.

472
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:57,696
And now, for our lesson.

473
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:02,159
Remember?
This is bread. Bread.

474
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:06,621
Bread.

475
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:12,126
And this is wine to drink.

476
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:15,588
Drink.
Drink.

477
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:23,595
Good.

478
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,431
We are friends, you and I.

479
00:41:26,974 --> 00:41:28,058
Friends.

480
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:29,892
Friends.

481
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:32,186
Good.

482
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:35,397
And now, for a smoke.

483
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:51,746
No, no, this is good.
Smoke. You try.

484
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,831
Smoke.

485
00:41:57,377 --> 00:41:58,919
Mmm! Mmm!

486
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,339
Good. Good.

487
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,257
Good.

488
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:11,389
Before you came,
I was all alone.

489
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:13,724
It is bad to be alone.

490
00:42:13,934 --> 00:42:17,769
Alone, bad.

491
00:42:17,853 --> 00:42:20,063
Friend, good.

492
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:23,692
Friend, good!

493
00:42:25,236 --> 00:42:27,153
And now, come here.

494
00:42:31,241 --> 00:42:33,200
And what is this?

495
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:37,579
This is wood
for the fire.

496
00:42:37,914 --> 00:42:39,164
Wood.

497
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,835
And this is fire.

498
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,881
No, no. Fire is good.

499
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:52,426
Fire, no good.

500
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:56,471
There is good,
and there is bad.

501
00:42:56,889 --> 00:42:59,933
Good. Bad.

502
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:03,895
Good!

503
00:43:07,024 --> 00:43:08,399
Music?
A-ha!

504
00:43:34,007 --> 00:43:36,925
Can you tell us how to get out of this wood?
We've lost our way.

505
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,636
Come in, friends,
and rest awhile.

506
00:43:44,641 --> 00:43:45,683
Look.

507
00:43:45,768 --> 00:43:46,976
It's the monster!

508
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:58,653
What are you doing?
This is my friend.

509
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,407
Friend? This is the fiend that's been
murdering half the countryside.

510
00:44:02,492 --> 00:44:04,784
Good heavens, man.
Can't you see?

511
00:44:04,993 --> 00:44:07,244
Oh! He's blind!

512
00:44:07,329 --> 00:44:08,579
He isn't human!

513
00:44:08,663 --> 00:44:12,166
Frankenstein made him
out of dead bodies!

514
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:29,890
My friend. My poor friend.
Why do you do this?

515
00:44:40,026 --> 00:44:41,818
Friend.

516
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,785
Look.

517
00:45:48,714 --> 00:45:50,464
Which way did he go?

518
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,509
This way! He's gone
this way! Over the hill.

519
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,451
Friend.

520
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:42,553
I can smell
the ghosts already.

521
00:46:42,638 --> 00:46:44,263
I never could
stand graves.

522
00:46:44,348 --> 00:46:46,224
Shut up and follow me.

523
00:47:09,996 --> 00:47:11,830
Read the inscription.

524
00:47:11,915 --> 00:47:13,374
What does it say?

525
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:22,757
"Died 1899. Madeline Ernestine,
beloved daughter of..."

526
00:47:22,841 --> 00:47:25,551
Oh, never mind that.
How old was she?

527
00:47:25,928 --> 00:47:29,346
"Age 19 years,
three months."

528
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,807
Well, that's the one.
Get to work.

529
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,268
What are you
waiting for?

530
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,602
Mercy on us.

531
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,272
You want me to send you to
the gallows where you belong?

532
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:39,606
Could be
no worse than this.

533
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:41,315
Well, are you ready?

534
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,483
Yes.

535
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:43,609
Well, here goes.

536
00:48:03,254 --> 00:48:06,463
Pretty little thing
in her way, wasn't she?

537
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:08,799
I hope her bones are firm.

538
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,052
It heaves lighter now.

539
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:13,512
Yes.

540
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:17,682
Well, Doctor, I guess
that's all for tonight.

541
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:19,058
Can we go home now?

542
00:48:19,143 --> 00:48:22,937
Yes. I shall wait here for a bit.
I rather like this place.

543
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:24,772
Be careful nobody
sees you leave.

544
00:48:24,857 --> 00:48:26,107
All right. We know.

545
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:27,817
And leave me that
lantern down there.

546
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,818
All right, all right!

547
00:48:41,413 --> 00:48:43,789
If there's much more like this,
what do you say, pal?

548
00:48:43,874 --> 00:48:46,125
We give ourselves up
and let 'em hang us.

549
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:47,877
That goes for me, too.

550
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:50,338
This is no life
for murderers.

551
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:01,639
I give you
the monster.

552
00:49:26,455 --> 00:49:30,457
Oh. I thought
I was alone.

553
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,667
Good evening.

554
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,294
Smoke.

555
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:38,507
Friend.

556
00:49:38,674 --> 00:49:40,383
Yes, I hope so.

557
00:49:40,467 --> 00:49:44,011
Have a cigar.
They are my only weakness.

558
00:49:47,265 --> 00:49:48,933
Good, good.

559
00:49:59,902 --> 00:50:02,487
Drink, good.

560
00:50:02,571 --> 00:50:03,862
Good.

561
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:23,423
You make man like me?

562
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:26,551
No. Woman.

563
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:28,677
Friend for you.

564
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:32,347
Woman. Friend.

565
00:50:32,682 --> 00:50:34,266
Yes.

566
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,520
I want friend like me.

567
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:41,021
I think you
can be very useful,

568
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:44,942
and you will add a little force to the argument,
if necessary.

569
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:50,239
Do you know who Henry
Frankenstein is and who you are?

570
00:50:50,532 --> 00:50:53,199
Yes, I know.

571
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:56,870
Made me from dead.

572
00:50:57,913 --> 00:51:00,540
I love dead.

573
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,418
Hate living.

574
00:51:03,502 --> 00:51:06,211
You're wise
in your generation.

575
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,130
We must have a long talk,

576
00:51:08,214 --> 00:51:11,383
and then,
I have an important call to make.

577
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,221
Woman.

578
00:51:17,806 --> 00:51:19,307
Friend.

579
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:23,394
Wife.

580
00:51:27,899 --> 00:51:30,233
That Dr. Pretorius
is here again, sir.

581
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:32,402
There. I knew it.

582
00:51:32,904 --> 00:51:34,988
Send him away.
I won't see him.

583
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:36,323
I certainly will.

584
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:41,410
Good evening, Henry.

585
00:51:43,455 --> 00:51:45,998
Baroness, I've not
yet had the opportunity

586
00:51:46,082 --> 00:51:49,543
of offering you my congratulations on your marriage.

587
00:51:49,628 --> 00:51:51,128
Pray accept them now.

588
00:51:51,463 --> 00:51:53,379
Dr. Pretorius,

589
00:51:53,464 --> 00:51:55,507
I don't know what your business is with my husband,

590
00:51:55,591 --> 00:51:57,342
but whatever it may be,
I tell you frankly

591
00:51:57,426 --> 00:51:59,636
that I am not frightened of it or of you.

592
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,722
Henry's been very ill.
He's in no state to be alarmed or annoyed.

593
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:06,517
Your visit now
is most unwelcome.

594
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:10,646
Henry, I heard
the carriage drive up.

595
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:12,189
I'll see that
the baggage is put in.

596
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:14,983
Then we're leaving.

597
00:52:21,532 --> 00:52:24,992
I think you know
why I am here, Henry.

598
00:52:26,078 --> 00:52:28,328
All the necessary
preparations are made.

599
00:52:28,412 --> 00:52:30,580
My part in the experiment
is complete.

600
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:34,251
I have created by my method
a perfect human brain,

601
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:36,795
already living but dormant.

602
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:38,838
Everything is now ready
for you and me

603
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:40,839
to begin our
supreme collaboration.

604
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:44,843
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
I don't want to hear!

605
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,179
I've changed my mind.

606
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,390
I won't do it.

607
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:51,225
I expected this.

608
00:52:52,643 --> 00:52:55,812
I thought we might need
another assistant.

609
00:52:56,397 --> 00:52:58,773
Perhaps he can
persuade you.

610
00:52:59,108 --> 00:53:00,942
Nothing can persuade me.

611
00:53:01,068 --> 00:53:02,777
We shall see.

612
00:53:04,404 --> 00:53:05,862
No! Not that!

613
00:53:05,947 --> 00:53:07,739
Oh, he's quite harmless,

614
00:53:07,824 --> 00:53:09,449
except when crossed.

615
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:18,165
Frankenstein.

616
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:23,254
Yes.
There have been developments since he came to me.

617
00:53:32,722 --> 00:53:34,681
Sit down.

618
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:39,060
What do you want?

619
00:53:39,145 --> 00:53:41,520
You know.

620
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:42,771
This is your work.

621
00:53:42,856 --> 00:53:43,939
Yes.

622
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:46,191
I'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

623
00:53:46,276 --> 00:53:47,985
Yes. Must.

624
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:49,653
Get him out.

625
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:51,738
I won't even discuss it
until he's gone.

626
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:53,906
Go now.

627
00:53:58,037 --> 00:53:59,787
Go!

628
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,799
Must do it.

629
00:54:12,884 --> 00:54:14,092
Never.

630
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:16,177
Nothing can
make me go on with it.

631
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:22,892
Now.

632
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:44,662
Put the bags in the carriage,
and I'll be out in a moment.

633
00:54:44,746 --> 00:54:47,915
Go and tell the master to hurry, Minnie,
or we shall lose the train.

634
00:54:51,877 --> 00:54:54,629
Excuse me for being
so nervous, milady,

635
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:57,423
but I don't like
leaving you alone.

636
00:54:57,508 --> 00:54:59,759
Oh, nonsense, Minnie.
I shall be all right.

637
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,512
I hope so, milady.

638
00:55:07,934 --> 00:55:09,685
Is that you, Henry?

639
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:31,162
Henry! Henry, help!

640
00:55:32,206 --> 00:55:33,832
Henry!

641
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:35,250
Milady!

642
00:55:37,628 --> 00:55:38,962
Elizabeth!

643
00:55:42,006 --> 00:55:43,549
The mistress!

644
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:47,219
What is it?
What's the matter?

645
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:49,763
Oh, sir! She's gone!

646
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:53,850
The monster!
He's got her! I saw it!

647
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,643
The Baroness is gone!

648
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:57,854
This is Pretorius' doing.

649
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,982
Quick, search parties!
There's not a moment to lose.

650
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:07,237
I charge you, as you value
your mistress' life,

651
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:10,449
to do nothing and say nothing of this episode.

652
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,785
I assure you that the Baroness will be safely returned,

653
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,328
if you will leave
everything to me.

654
00:56:17,289 --> 00:56:21,041
Nothing, that is,
except what he demands.

655
00:56:45,023 --> 00:56:47,816
I can find no trace
of Elizabeth.

656
00:56:48,526 --> 00:56:50,319
Oh, I admit I'm beaten.

657
00:56:52,446 --> 00:56:57,450
But if you can bring her back,
I'll do anything that you want.

658
00:56:57,701 --> 00:57:00,995
Are you ready to complete
with me this final experiment?

659
00:57:01,246 --> 00:57:02,455
What about Elizabeth?

660
00:57:02,539 --> 00:57:07,709
She is well and will be safely
returned if you will proceed.

661
00:57:08,336 --> 00:57:09,419
I'm ready.

662
00:57:10,004 --> 00:57:11,046
Ah.

663
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:27,727
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, I expect.

664
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:29,854
I think it's
a charming touch.

665
00:57:43,993 --> 00:57:47,037
It is interesting to think, Henry,
that once upon a time,

666
00:57:47,121 --> 00:57:48,831
we should have been
burned at the stake

667
00:57:48,915 --> 00:57:51,166
as wizards for
this experiment.

668
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,416
Doctor.

669
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:54,919
I think the heart
is beating.

670
00:57:58,465 --> 00:58:03,426
Look. It's beating,
but the rhythm of the beat is uneven.

671
00:58:03,511 --> 00:58:06,096
Increase the
saline solution.

672
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:11,142
Is there any life yet?

673
00:58:11,477 --> 00:58:14,187
No. Not life itself yet.

674
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:16,897
This is only
the simulacrum of life.

675
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:20,568
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

676
00:58:20,652 --> 00:58:22,027
We must be patient.

677
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:23,946
The human heart
is more complex

678
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,865
than any other
part of the body.

679
00:58:26,408 --> 00:58:29,117
Look. The beat
is increasing.

680
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:30,451
Yes.

681
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:33,580
It's stopped.

682
00:58:33,664 --> 00:58:35,832
Shall I increase
the current?

683
00:58:37,918 --> 00:58:40,127
This heart is useless.

684
00:58:40,712 --> 00:58:42,671
I must have another,

685
00:58:42,755 --> 00:58:46,133
and it must be
sound and young.

686
00:58:48,386 --> 00:58:49,845
Karl.

687
00:58:51,471 --> 00:58:53,806
You must go to your friend
at the accident hospital.

688
00:58:54,808 --> 00:58:57,935
What we need is a female victim of sudden death.

689
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,353
Can you do it?

690
00:58:59,563 --> 00:59:02,064
You promise me
1,000 crowns?

691
00:59:02,149 --> 00:59:05,567
It will be well worth it,
and the Baron will pay.

692
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:06,985
Yes, yes.
Go and get it.

693
00:59:07,612 --> 00:59:09,154
I'll try.

694
00:59:17,829 --> 00:59:20,915
There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

695
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:22,458
Always.

696
00:59:23,335 --> 00:59:26,712
I'll get your heart.
I'll go into that room.

697
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:29,964
I'll go into that room,
and I'll take my knife out and I'll get it.

698
00:59:30,049 --> 00:59:31,799
I'll hold her down,
and there'll she be.

699
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:34,344
Where, I ask you.
Where will she be?

700
00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:37,513
A thousand crowns.

701
00:59:50,693 --> 00:59:52,526
It's beating perfectly,

702
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:54,111
just as in life!

703
00:59:54,196 --> 00:59:56,322
Oh, if only I can
keep it going until...

704
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:57,865
It was a very fresh one.

705
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:01,661
Where did you get it?

706
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:05,538
I gave the gendarme
50 crowns.

707
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:07,457
What gendarme?

708
01:00:07,541 --> 01:00:08,875
It was a...

709
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,504
Police case.

710
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:16,507
Yes, very sad,
only we can't bother about that now.

711
01:00:16,591 --> 01:00:17,800
Can I do anything?

712
01:00:17,884 --> 01:00:19,718
No, no, no!

713
01:00:19,803 --> 01:00:22,054
I can work better alone.

714
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,697
Work.

715
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:44,324
Where's Elizabeth?
Have you brought her?

716
01:00:44,409 --> 01:00:46,785
She wait. I wait.

717
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,997
I'm exhausted.
I must get sleep.

718
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:53,666
Work. Finish. Then sleep.

719
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,668
I can't work like this!

720
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,586
He must go away.
Send him away.

721
01:00:57,671 --> 01:01:00,297
I'll settle him
for a little while.

722
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:19,606
Drink.

723
01:01:23,945 --> 01:01:25,279
Good.

724
01:01:44,964 --> 01:01:47,049
That'll keep you quiet.

725
01:01:48,426 --> 01:01:50,886
Elizabeth. She's dead.

726
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:53,554
Elizabeth is alive,
and she is well.

727
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:55,681
I don't believe you!

728
01:01:55,974 --> 01:01:57,349
I have proof.

729
01:01:57,434 --> 01:01:58,726
Proof?

730
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:00,644
In a few moments from now,

731
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:02,688
she will speak to you
from where she is

732
01:02:02,773 --> 01:02:04,647
through this
electrical machine.

733
01:02:04,815 --> 01:02:06,232
Where is she?

734
01:02:06,317 --> 01:02:08,401
Not far from here.

735
01:02:10,321 --> 01:02:13,323
Speak, and she will
hear you and answer.

736
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,326
Yes? Yes, this is Henry.

737
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,370
Henry, yes, I'm safe.
But, Henry, how long?

738
01:02:20,455 --> 01:02:22,831
Come for me.
I'm in a cave...

739
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:27,043
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth! She's gone.

740
01:02:27,127 --> 01:02:29,462
That is all now,
but you heard her.

741
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:32,090
Yes. She's alive.

742
01:02:32,174 --> 01:02:33,716
As soon as our work
is completed,

743
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:35,718
she will be
returned to you.

744
01:02:39,847 --> 01:02:42,432
The heart is beating
more regularly now.

745
01:02:44,352 --> 01:02:47,187
Yes. It's been beating
for nine hours.

746
01:02:48,689 --> 01:02:51,565
Not yet, but soon.

747
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:52,775
And the brain?

748
01:02:52,859 --> 01:02:55,486
Perfect and already
in position.

749
01:02:55,570 --> 01:02:57,530
Then we are almost ready.

750
01:02:57,823 --> 01:02:59,031
Almost.

751
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:02,785
Shall we put
the heart in now?

752
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,119
Yes.

753
01:03:04,286 --> 01:03:05,703
Ludwig!

754
01:03:23,388 --> 01:03:25,764
It's beating
quite normally now.

755
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:27,557
Bring it over.

756
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:43,321
The storm is rising.

757
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:44,739
All right.

758
01:03:47,326 --> 01:03:49,661
The air is heavy
with electricity.

759
01:03:49,745 --> 01:03:52,163
It's going to be
a terrific storm.

760
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:55,583
We shall be ready.

761
01:04:01,131 --> 01:04:05,675
Isn't it amazing, Henry,
that lying here, within this skull,

762
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:09,095
is an artificially developed
human brain,

763
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:14,642
each cell, each convolution, ready,
waiting for life to come.

764
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:17,603
Look.

765
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,980
The storm is coming up
over the mountains.

766
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,440
It will be here soon.

767
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:23,734
The kites!
Are the kites ready?

768
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:24,860
Yes!

769
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,695
Then send them up as soon as the wind rises.

770
01:04:26,779 --> 01:04:27,862
Hurry, hurry.

771
01:04:27,946 --> 01:04:30,364
The kites! The kites!
Get 'em ready!

772
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,744
Ludwig!

773
01:04:47,173 --> 01:04:49,132
Seems that he wants
the kites!

774
01:04:53,553 --> 01:04:55,095
Stand back.

775
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,691
Stand by the roof!

776
01:05:16,157 --> 01:05:18,200
Cosmic diffuser!

777
01:05:28,627 --> 01:05:30,795
Wires! Send down
your wires!

778
01:05:38,844 --> 01:05:41,388
All right, stop your windlass.
I'm coming up.

779
01:05:51,231 --> 01:05:52,690
Now, up with the kites.

780
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,858
You take number two, Ludwig.

781
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,278
You've checked
your connections?

782
01:05:57,362 --> 01:05:58,821
Yes.

783
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:00,281
Stand by!

784
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,658
Let go number one.

785
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:08,746
Let it go, Karl!

786
01:07:08,218 --> 01:07:09,302
It's coming up!

787
01:08:15,113 --> 01:08:17,072
Go back. Go back down!

788
01:08:17,156 --> 01:08:18,615
Go down!

789
01:08:19,826 --> 01:08:22,911
No, don't! No!
Get away! Frankenstein!

790
01:08:22,995 --> 01:08:24,454
Get away! Get away!

791
01:08:24,664 --> 01:08:26,081
No, don't.

792
01:08:30,377 --> 01:08:32,503
No. Don't come near me!

793
01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:36,340
Get away! Don't! No!

794
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:38,925
No! Get back!

795
01:08:39,009 --> 01:08:42,011
Don't! Don't! Don't!

796
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:14,541
Raise the cosmic diffuser.

797
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:22,757
Remove the diffuser bands.

798
01:09:46,363 --> 01:09:49,240
She's alive! Alive!

799
01:10:38,953 --> 01:10:41,496
The bride of Frankenstein.

800
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,754
Friend?

801
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,175
Friend?

802
01:12:01,362 --> 01:12:03,487
Stand back. Stand back!

803
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:32,264
She hate me.

804
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,224
Like others.

805
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,572
Look out! The lever!

806
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,114
Get away
from that lever!

807
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,824
You'll blow us all
to atoms.

808
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,120
Henry!

809
01:12:57,747 --> 01:13:00,207
Undo the door! Henry!

810
01:13:00,291 --> 01:13:02,125
Get back! Get back!

811
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:04,210
I won't unless you come!

812
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:07,672
But I can't leave them!
