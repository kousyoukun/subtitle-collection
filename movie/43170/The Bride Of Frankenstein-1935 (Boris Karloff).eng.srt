1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
23.976

2
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,931
How beautifully dramatic.

3
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:24,894
The crudest, savage, exhibition
of nature at her worst, without,

4
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,982
and we three, we elegant three, within.

5
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,985
I should like to think that an irate Jehovah

6
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:35,363
was pointing those arrows
of lightning directly at my head.

7
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:40,994
The unbowed head of George Gordon,
Lord Byron, England's greatest sinner.

8
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,122
But I cannot flatter myself to that extent.

9
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,791
Possibly those thunders
are for our dear Shelley.

10
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,586
Heaven's applause
for England's greatest poet.

11
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,590
- What of my Mary?
- She is an angel.

12
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,885
- You think so?

13
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,846
You hear?

14
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,474
Come, Mary. Come and watch the storm.

15
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,101
You know how lightning alarms me.

16
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:09,272
Shelley, darling, will you please
light these candles for me?

17
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
Mary, darling.

18
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,693
Astonishing creature.

19
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:18,198
- I, Lord Byron?
- Frightened of thunder, fearful of the dark.

20
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:22,327
And yet you have written a tale
that sent my blood into icy creeps.

21
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:28,083
Look at her, Shelley. Can you believe that
lovely brow conceived of Frankenstein?

22
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:32,295
A monster created from
cadavers out of rifled graves.

23
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,257
- Isn't it astonishing?
- I don't know why you should think so.

24
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,176
What do you expect?

25
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,263
Such an audience needs something
stronger than a pretty little love story.

26
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,599
So why shouldn't I write of monsters?

27
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,812
No wonder Murray's refused to publish
the book. His public would be shocked.

28
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,147
It will be published, I think.

29
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,317
Then, darling, you will have
much to answer for.

30
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:59,531
The publishers did not see that
my purpose was to write a moral lesson

31
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:04,994
of the punishment that befell
a mortal man who dared to emulate God.

32
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:10,041
Whatever your purpose was, I take great
relish in savouring each separate horror.

33
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,168
I roll them over on my tongue.

34
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,380
Don't, Lord Byron.
Don't remind me of it tonight.

35
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,675
What a setting in that
churchyard to begin with!

36
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:25,432
The sobbing women, the first clod of earth
o"n the coffin. That was a pretty chill."

37
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,686
the body out of its new-made grave.

38
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:34,607
the gallows, where he swung in the wind.

39
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,736
in his mountain laboratory,

40
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:42,323
building up a human monster

41
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:47,037
a half-crazed brain could have devised.

42
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:52,292
the little child who "drowned.

43
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:56,087
thrown from the top of the burning mill

44
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,548
by the very monster he had created.

45
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:04,179
And it was these fragile white fingers
that penned the nightmare.

46
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,349
Ah! You've made me prick myself, Byron.

47
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,435
It's bleeding.

48
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:16,107
There, there. I do think it a shame, Mary,
to end your story quite so suddenly.

49
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:21,029
That wasn't the end at all. Would you
like to hear what happened after that?

50
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,365
I feel like telling it.

51
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,409
It's a perfect night for mystery and horror.

52
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,954
The air itself is filled with monsters.

53
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:36,044
I'm all ears. While heaven blasts the night
without, open up your pits of hell.

54
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:41,174
Well, then, imagine yourselves
standing by the wreckage of the mill.

55
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,843
The fire is dying down.

56
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:47,972
Soon the bare skeleton
o"f the building rolls over,"

57
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,600
the gaunt rafters against the sky.

58
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,998
Well, I must say, that's the best fire
I ever saw in all me life.

59
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,421
- What are you cryin' for?
- It's terrible.

60
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:24,384
I know. But after all them murders and
poor Mr Henry being brought home to die,

61
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:29,139
I'm glad to see the monster
roasted to death before my very eyes.

62
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,474
It's too good for him.

63
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:37,105
It's all the devil's work, and you'd better
cross yourself quick before he gets you.

64
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,027
Come along, come along. It's all over.

65
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,696
Get back to your homes and go to sleep.

66
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,784
There it goes again.
It ain't burnt out at all.

67
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:53,288
- There's more yet.
- Isn't the monster dead yet?

68
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,833
It's high time every decent
man and wife was in bed.

69
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,295
That's his insides caught at last.

70
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,256
Insides is always the last to be consumed.

71
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,884
Move on. You've had enough
excitement for one night.

72
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,512
This strange man
you call a monster is dead.

73
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,890
Monster, indeed!

74
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:17,520
You may thank your lucky stars they sent
for me to safeguard life and property.

75
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,648
Why didn't you safeguard
those drownded and murdered?

76
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,611
Come, now. We want no rallying, no riots.

77
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,030
- Who's riotin'?
- Move on, move on.

78
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,824
Good night all, and pleasant dreams.

79
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,327
Ah, pleasant dreams yourself.

80
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:37,290
Thinks he's everybody just because
he's a burgomaster. Huh!

81
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:47,926
Poor Mr Henry. He was to have been
married today to that lovely girl Elizabeth.

82
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,514
Cover him up. Someone must
break the news to the poor girl.

83
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,016
Ride as fast as you can to the castle,

84
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,853
and tell the old Baron Frankenstein
we are bringing his son home.

85
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,857
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, shut up.

86
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,321
Come home, Hans.
The monster is dead now.

87
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:12,867
Nothing could be left alive in that furnace.
Why do you stay here?

88
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,371
I want to see with my own eyes.

89
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,790
Oh, Hans, he must be dead.

90
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:23,211
And, dead or alive, nothing can
bring our little Maria back to us.

91
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:28,299
If I can see his blackened bones,
I can sleep at night.

92
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,554
Come back, Hans!
You will be burned yourself!

93
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:36,766
Maria drowned to death and
you burned up! What should I do then?

94
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,935
No!

95
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,394
Hans. Hans!

96
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:25,440
Where are you? Hans!
Are you all right?

97
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,571
I hear you. Here,
give me your hand, Hans.

98
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,492
Here.

99
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,642
Oh, heaven, what is this?

100
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,648
Henry? Tell me.

101
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,485
Oh, milady, how can we tell you?

102
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,660
Bring him in.

103
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,383
- Albert.
- What do you want?

104
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,803
It's alive. The monster, it's alive!

105
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:23,308
- Ah, shut up, you old fool.
- I saw it.

106
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,436
It ain't turned to no skeleton at all.

107
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,730
It lived right through the fire.

108
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,150
Ah, go bite your tongue off.
We don't believe in ghosts.

109
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,235
Nobody'll believe me.

110
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,821
All right, I'll wash my hands of it.

111
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:40,533
Let 'em all be murdered in their beds.

112
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:15,402
- Speak to me, Henry.
- Oh, milady, he'll never speak again.

113
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,363
I was foretold of this.

114
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,324
I was told beware my wedding night.

115
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,378
Oh, look, milady! He's alive!

116
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,716
Henry, darling.

117
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,761
Elizabeth.

118
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,391
Oh, what a terrible wedding night.

119
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,908
You can go to bed now, Mary.

120
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,546
- You'll soon be better.
- I feel almost myself again.

121
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,759
When you're strong enough, we'll go
away and forget this horrible experience.

122
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,304
Forget? If only I could forget.

123
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,681
But it's never out of my mind.

124
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:30,393
I've been cursed for delving
into the mysteries of life.

125
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:34,439
Perhaps death is sacred,
and I've profaned it.

126
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,734
For what a wonderful vision it was.

127
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:44,491
I dreamed of being the first to give to the
world the secret that God is so jealous of.

128
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,369
The formula for life.

129
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,039
Think of the power to create a man.

130
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,751
And I did. I did it. I created a man.

131
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,171
And who knows? In time I could
have trained him to do my will.

132
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,550
I could have bred a race. I might even
have found the secret of eternal life.

133
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:07,347
Henry, don't say those things. Don't
think them. It's blasphemous and wicked.

134
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,307
We are not meant to know those things.

135
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,686
It may be that I'm intended
to know the secret of life.

136
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,106
It may be part of the divine plan.

137
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,734
No, no. It's the devil that prompts you.

138
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,530
It's death, not life, that is in it all
and at the end of it all.

139
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:28,827
Listen, while you've been lying here,
tossing in your delirium, I couldn't sleep.

140
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,329
And when you rave of your insane desire

141
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:34,290
to create living men
from the dust of the dead,

142
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,878
a strange apparition has
seemed to appear in the room.

143
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:44,134
It comes, a figure like Death. And
each time it comes more clearly, nearer.

144
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,971
It seems to be reaching out for you,
as if it would take you away from me!

145
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,432
There it is. Look.

146
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,853
- There.
- I see nothing, Elizabeth. Where?

147
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:57,063
There's nothing there.

148
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,025
There! There! It's coming for you!

149
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:04,237
Nearer! Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry!

150
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,406
Henry!

151
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,420
Albert! Drat the man.
He's never here when he's wanted.

152
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:24,341
- What's the good of footmen anyway?

153
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:27,010
All right. All right!

154
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,764
Don't knock the castle over!
We're not all dead yet.

155
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,194
- There's nobody at home.
- Let me in, my good woman.

156
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,322
I know the young
Baron Frankenstein is at home.

157
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:51,910
He's sick. He's in his bed, where all
decent folk should be at this time of night.

158
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:57,457
Tell him that Dr Pretorius is here
on a secret matter of grave importance,

159
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,543
and must see him alone, tonight.

160
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,382
Dr Pretorius?

161
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,384
Pretorius?

162
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,308
- What was it? What was the name?
- Dr Pretorius.

163
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,187
There ain't no such name.

164
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,447
Now, you stay there.

165
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,623
- Who's there?
- It's Minnie, milady.

166
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,792
Oh, come in.

167
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,838
It's Dr Pretorius.

168
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:48,925
He says he wants to see
the master. Most insistent.

169
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,552
Pretorius?

170
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,179
He's a very queer-looking
old gentleman, sir.

171
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:57,350
And must see you, on a secret,
grave matter, he said.

172
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,394
Tonight. Alone.

173
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,939
- Bring him in.
- Henry, who is this man?

174
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,983
Dr Pretorius.

175
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,364
Baron Frankenstein now, I believe?

176
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,867
Won't you come in, Doctor?

177
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,954
I trust you will pardon
this intrusion at so late an hour.

178
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,750
I would not have ventured to come,
had I not a communication to make

179
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:25,587
which I suspect may be
of the utmost importance to yourself.

180
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:30,717
This is Professor Pretorius. He used to be
Doctor of Philosophy at the university.

181
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,511
- But, uh...
- But was booted out.

182
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,264
Booted, my dear Baron, is the word.

183
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,308
For knowing too much.

184
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,728
Henry's been very ill, Professor.
He shouldn't be disturbed.

185
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,147
I am also a doctor, Baroness.

186
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,358
Why have you come here tonight?

187
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,444
My business with you, Baron, is private.

188
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,613
Elizabeth, please.

189
00:17:57,952 --> 00:18:00,038
I do hope he won't upset Henry.

190
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:06,252
- What do you want?
- We must work together.

191
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:09,631
Never. This is outrageous.

192
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:14,511
I'm through with it.
I'll have no more of this hell-spawn.

193
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,598
As soon as I'm well,
I'm to be married, and I'm going away.

194
00:18:18,682 --> 00:18:20,850
I must beg you to reconsider.

195
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,728
You know, do you not,
that it is you, really,

196
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,981
who are responsible
for all those murders?

197
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:31,695
There are penalties
to pay for killing people.

198
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,031
And with your creature
still at large in the countryside...

199
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,242
Are you threatening me?

200
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,452
Don't put it so crudely.

201
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:44,416
I had ventured to hope that you and I
together, no longer as master and pupil,

202
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:49,129
but as fellow scientists, might probe
the mysteries of life and death...

203
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,922
Never. No further.

204
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,050
...and reach a goal
undreamed of by science.

205
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:58,054
I can't make any further experiments.
I've had a terrible lesson.

206
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,348
That is sad, very sad.

207
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,560
But you and I have gone too far to stop.

208
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,646
Nor can it be stopped so easily.

209
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,649
I also have continued
with my experiments.

210
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,235
That is why I am here tonight.

211
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,821
You must see "my" creation.

212
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,075
Have you also succeeded
in bringing life to the dead?

213
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,579
If you, Herr Baron, will do me the honour
of visiting my humble abode,

214
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:26,041
I think you will be interested
in what I have to show you.

215
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:31,379
After 20 years of secret scientific
research, and countless failures,

216
00:19:31,463 --> 00:19:37,510
I also have created life,
as we say, in God's own image.

217
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,972
I must know. When can I see it?

218
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,516
I thought you might change your mind.

219
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,519
Why not tonight? It is not very late.

220
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:51,483
- Is it far?
- No, but you will need a coat.

221
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,371
I think your coachman
had better wait here.

222
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,768
Won't you sit down, Herr Baron?

223
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,527
Before I show you the results
of my trifling experiments,

224
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,238
I would like to drink to our partnership.

225
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,617
Do you like gin? It is my only weakness.

226
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,833
To a new world of gods and monsters.

227
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,215
Creation of life is enthralling,

228
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,010
distinctly enthralling, is it not?

229
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:04,055
I cannot account precisely
for all that I am going to show you.

230
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:08,184
But perhaps now that
you are my partner, you can.

231
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,228
My experiments did not turn out
quite like yours, Henry.

232
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:59,527
But science, like love, has her
little surprises, as you shall see.

233
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,697
Good heavens, Doctor. What are these?

234
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,784
There is a pleasing variety
about my exhibits.

235
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,746
My first experiment was so lovely

236
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,082
that we made her a queen.

237
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,298
Charming, don't you think?

238
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,094
Then, of course, we had to have a king.

239
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:30,058
Now he's so madly in love with her
that we have to segregate them.

240
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:35,605
Now now. I have to be
very careful with the king.

241
00:22:38,942 --> 00:22:41,069
Now, behave.

242
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:45,073
My next production looked
so disapprovingly at the other two

243
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,826
that they made him an archbishop.

244
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:50,370
He seems to be asleep.
I must wake him up.

245
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:57,460
The next one is the very devil.

246
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,921
Very bizarre, this little chap.

247
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:04,509
There's a certain resemblance to me,
don't you think? Or do I flatter myself?

248
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,095
I took a great deal of pains with him.

249
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,016
Sometimes I have wondered whether
life wouldn't be much more amusing

250
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:13,309
if we were all devils,

251
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:17,272
and no nonsense about
angels and being good.

252
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,108
Oh, there's the king out again.

253
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,280
Even royal amours are a nuisance.

254
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,544
Poor Archbishop. He has his hands full.

255
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,630
There. That'll keep you quiet.

256
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,218
My little ballerina is charming,
but such a bore.

257
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,138
She'll only dance to
Mendelssohn's "Spring Song",

258
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,307
and it gets so monotonous.

259
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,310
My next is very conventional, I'm afraid.

260
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:58,396
But you can never tell
how these things will turn out.

261
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,483
It was an experiment with seaweed.

262
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,110
Normal size has been my difficulty.

263
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:06,446
You did achieve size.

264
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,782
I need to work that out with you.

265
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,833
But this isn't science.

266
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,960
It's more like black magic.

267
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:24,297
You think I'm mad. Perhaps I am.

268
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,299
But listen, Henry Frankenstein,

269
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:30,512
while you were digging in your graves
piecing together dead tissues,

270
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:34,766
I, my dear pupil, went for my material
to the source of life.

271
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:41,773
I grew my creatures, like cultures.
Grew them as nature does, from seed.

272
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:46,945
But, still, you did achieve
results that I have missed. Now, think.

273
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:50,699
What a world-astounding
collaboration we should be,

274
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,118
you and I, together.

275
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,996
No. No, no, no.

276
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,542
Leave the charnel house
and follow the lead of nature,

277
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:03,753
or of God, if you like your Bible stories.

278
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:08,216
Male and female, created He them.

279
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,928
Be fruitful and multiply.

280
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:18,101
Create a race, a man-made race
upon the face of the earth. Why not?

281
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,062
I daren't. I daren't even think
of such a thing.

282
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:24,190
Our mad dream is only half realised.

283
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:27,027
Alone you have created a man.

284
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,698
Now together we will create his mate.

285
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,617
You mean...?

286
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:38,371
Yes, a woman.

287
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:41,499
That should be really interesting.

288
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,210
Please don't touch me!

289
00:27:12,382 --> 00:27:15,343
- There she is! Quick!

290
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,388
There he is. Shoot.

291
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:31,276
Run to the village, quick.
It's the monster. Tell the burgomaster.

292
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:48,585
- What is it now?
- The monster! He's in the woods.

293
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,297
Get the bloodhounds. Raise all the
men you can, lock the women indoors

294
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,466
and wait for me.

295
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:01,639
Now then! Monster, indeed!
I'll show him. Follow me.

296
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,120
Where is he?

297
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,294
Bind him securely.
I don't want anything slipshod.

298
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:17,090
Tie his feet first. His feet first!

299
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:20,343
I get no cooperation. None at all.

300
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:23,304
Have you got him? That's what
I want to know. Have you got him?

301
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,515
Of course we've got him,
my good woman.

302
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,727
A good job too.
Mind he don't get loose again.

303
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,771
He might do some damage
and hurt somebody.

304
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:36,401
- Bring him down when you've bound him.
- You want any help there? I'll bind him!

305
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:34,292
Now take him down to the old dungeon
and put him in chains.

306
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,522
There you are.
Find some rope and tie him up.

307
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,109
Come on, then. Get back to your work.

308
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,703
Keep still.

309
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:21,256
That's quite enough. Come and lock your
doors. We can't take all day over this.

310
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,598
I'd hate to find him under my bed at night.
He's a nightmare in the daylight, he is.

311
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:33,309
Get away, there! Clear that window!

312
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,897
Hah! You mind your own business and
see he doesn't get out. He's dangerous.

313
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,567
Now I can get back
to more important duties.

314
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,193
- Way past our hours.
- Hm?

315
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,572
- The night, sir.
- Monster, indeed.

316
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,741
Tush, tush.

317
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,678
He's loose! Shoot him!

318
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,531
Help! He's loose!

319
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:33,411
Go to your homes.
Just an escaped lunatic.

320
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:37,332
Merely wanted someone to handle it,
that's all. Quite harmless.

321
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,010
Shoot him! Why don't you shoot him?

322
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,108
Where's Frieda?

323
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,277
Frieda! Frieda!

324
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:12,409
- Frieda? Where's Frieda?
- She just left.

325
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,036
- Oh, look!

326
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:20,208
Frieda! Oh, what have they done to you?

327
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:25,130
Mrs Newman. Oh! Come on!

328
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:37,225
- Poor old Newman.
- Where's his wife, Frau Newman?

329
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:38,768
Frau Newman.

330
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:42,939
- Frau Newman!
- Frau Newman!

331
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,066
Frau Newman!

332
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,407
There's another one in there.

333
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,909
- Frau Newman.

334
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:58,955
Aurora, you stay close to me.

335
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,087
We'd better get away from these parts.

336
00:34:06,171 --> 00:34:09,007
- It isn't safe.
- Why?

337
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,218
I'm frightened. The monster.

338
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:16,097
Ah, there's no danger. He's safe in jail
and they'll keep him there.

339
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:19,601
Where's the pepper and salt?
We got no pepper and salt.

340
00:34:19,684 --> 00:34:21,936
All right, Mother. I'll get it.

341
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,481
Don't worry. You shall have your meat.

342
00:34:24,564 --> 00:34:26,024
Ah.

343
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47,253
Get away from there.

344
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,493
Who's there?

345
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:50,043
Who is it?

346
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:53,088
You're welcome, my friend,
whoever you are.

347
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,427
Who are you?

348
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:03,390
I think you're a stranger to me.

349
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:08,728
I cannot see you. I cannot see anything.

350
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:12,982
You must please excuse me,
but I am blind.

351
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:22,242
Come in, my poor friend.

352
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:24,411
No one will hurt you here.

353
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:28,581
If you're in trouble,
perhaps I can help you.

354
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:32,502
But you need not tell me about it
if you don't want to.

355
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,713
- What's the matter?

356
00:37:37,716 --> 00:37:39,801
You're hurt, my poor friend.

357
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:41,720
Come.

358
00:38:01,948 --> 00:38:04,034
Sit down.

359
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,455
Now tell me, who are you?

360
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,418
I don't understand.

361
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,464
Can you not speak?

362
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:21,718
It's strange.

363
00:38:21,801 --> 00:38:24,846
Perhaps... perhaps you're afflicted too.

364
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:30,226
I cannot see and you cannot speak.

365
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,395
Is that it?

366
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:38,360
If you understand what I'm saying,
put your hand on my shoulder.

367
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,657
That is good.

368
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,454
No, you stay here.

369
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,665
I'll get you some food.

370
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,346
We shall be friends.

371
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:12,936
I have prayed many times
for God to send me a friend.

372
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:18,525
It's very lonely here,
and it's been a long time

373
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:22,070
since any human being came into this hut.

374
00:39:22,153 --> 00:39:25,156
I shall look after you,

375
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,451
and you will comfort me.

376
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,794
Now you must lie down,

377
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:41,089
and go to sleep.

378
00:39:48,638 --> 00:39:52,475
Yes, yes, now you must sleep.

379
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,734
Our Father, I thank thee,

380
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:07,449
that, in thy great mercy, thou hast
taken pity on my great loneliness.

381
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:10,201
And now, out of the silence of the night,

382
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,039
hath brought two
of thy lonely children together,

383
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,666
and sent me a friend

384
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,714
to be a light to mine eyes
and a comfort in time of trouble.

385
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,591
Amen.

386
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:50,075
And now for our lesson.

387
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:53,286
Remember, this is bread.

388
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,954
Bread.

389
00:40:57,499 --> 00:40:59,584
Bread.

390
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:04,839
And this is wine... to drink.

391
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:07,884
- Drink.
- Drink.

392
00:41:13,306 --> 00:41:16,393
Good. Good.

393
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,062
We are friends, you and I.

394
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:22,315
- Friends.
- Friends.

395
00:41:22,399 --> 00:41:25,402
- Good.
- Good!

396
00:41:25,485 --> 00:41:29,781
And now for a smoke.

397
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:41,334
No, no. This is good.

398
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:44,379
Smoke. You try.

399
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:47,382
Smoke.

400
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:54,723
Good, good.

401
00:41:56,266 --> 00:41:58,351
Good.

402
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:03,815
Before you came, I was all alone.

403
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:06,317
It is bad to be alone.

404
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:08,528
Alone.

405
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,363
Bad.

406
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:15,744
Friend. Good. Friend. Good.

407
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,956
Now, come here.

408
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:25,962
And what is this?

409
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,507
This is wood for the fire.

410
00:42:30,258 --> 00:42:32,344
Wood.

411
00:42:34,346 --> 00:42:36,556
- And this is fire.

412
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:40,894
No, no. Fire is good.

413
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:44,314
Fire no good.

414
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,235
There is good and there is bad.

415
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,988
Good. Bad.

416
00:42:54,616 --> 00:42:56,701
Good.

417
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,539
Music?

418
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:29,567
Can you tell us how to get out
of this wood? We've lost our way.

419
00:43:29,651 --> 00:43:31,903
Come in, friends, and rest a while.

420
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:39,577
- Look.
- It's the monster.

421
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:51,172
What are you doing? This is my friend.

422
00:43:51,256 --> 00:43:54,884
Friend? This is the fiend that's
been murdering half the countryside.

423
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,345
Good heavens, man, can't you see?

424
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,806
Oh, he's blind.

425
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:04,019
He isn't human. Frankenstein
made him out of dead bodies.

426
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:22,454
My friend. Why do you do this?

427
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:34,549
Friend.

428
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:43,308
Look.

429
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,576
Which way did he go?

430
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,955
This way! He's gone this way!

431
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:14,024
Friend.

432
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:36,713
- I can smell the ghosts already.
- I never could stand graves.

433
00:46:36,796 --> 00:46:38,673
Shut up and follow me.

434
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:05,241
Read the inscription. What does it say?

435
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:15,210
"Died 1899. Maddalena Ernestine,
beloved daughter of..."

436
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,004
Oh, never mind that. How old was she?

437
00:47:18,338 --> 00:47:21,800
"Aged 19 years, three months."

438
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:24,219
Well, that's the one. Get to work.

439
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:27,972
- What are you waiting for?
- Mercy on us.

440
00:47:28,056 --> 00:47:31,976
- You want me to send you to the gallows?
- Could be no worse than this.

441
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,771
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.

442
00:47:34,854 --> 00:47:36,940
Here goes.

443
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:59,129
Pretty little thing, in her way, wasn't she?

444
00:47:59,212 --> 00:48:01,006
I hope her bones are firm.

445
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:05,510
- It seems lighter now.
- Yes.

446
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,056
Well, Doctor, I guess that's all for tonight.

447
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,393
- Can we go home now?
- Yes. I shall wait here for a bit.

448
00:48:13,476 --> 00:48:15,645
I rather like this place.

449
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,314
- Be careful nobody sees you leave.
- We know.

450
00:48:18,398 --> 00:48:22,402
- And leave me that lantern down there.
- All right, all right.

451
00:48:33,747 --> 00:48:36,124
If there's more like this,
what do you say, pal?

452
00:48:36,207 --> 00:48:38,501
We give ourselves up
and let 'em hang us?

453
00:48:38,585 --> 00:48:42,630
- That goes for me too.
- This is no life for murderers.

454
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,059
I give you the monster.

455
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,669
Oh.

456
00:49:20,752 --> 00:49:25,048
I thought I was alone. Good evening.

457
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:27,217
Smoke.

458
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:32,806
- Friend.
- Yes, I hope so.

459
00:49:32,889 --> 00:49:36,601
Have a cigar. They are my only weakness.

460
00:49:39,437 --> 00:49:41,189
Good, good.

461
00:49:52,325 --> 00:49:54,703
Drink. Good.

462
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,871
Good.

463
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:15,724
You make man like me?

464
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,309
No. Woman.

465
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,106
- Friend for you.
- Woman?

466
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:25,942
Friend. Yes.

467
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:30,780
I want friend. Like me.

468
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:33,241
I think you can be very useful.

469
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:37,871
And you will add a little force
to the argument, if necessary.

470
00:50:37,954 --> 00:50:42,584
Do you know who Henry Frankenstein is?
And who you are?

471
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,836
Yes. I know.

472
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:48,715
Made me from dead.

473
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:52,260
I love dead.

474
00:50:53,553 --> 00:50:55,722
Hate living.

475
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:58,475
You're wise in your generation.

476
00:50:58,558 --> 00:51:03,646
We must have a long talk, and then
I have an important call to make.

477
00:51:07,734 --> 00:51:11,905
Woman. Friend.

478
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,909
Wife.

479
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:22,582
That Dr Pretorius is here again, sir.

480
00:51:22,665 --> 00:51:24,834
There, I knew it.

481
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:28,588
- Send him away. I won't see him.
- I certainly will.

482
00:51:32,008 --> 00:51:33,927
Good evening, Henry.

483
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:38,264
Baroness, I've not yet had the opportunity

484
00:51:38,348 --> 00:51:41,810
of offering you
my congratulations on your marriage.

485
00:51:41,893 --> 00:51:45,605
- Pray accept them now.
- Dr Pretorius.

486
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:48,692
I don't know what your business is
but, whatever it may be,

487
00:51:48,775 --> 00:51:51,820
I tell you frankly
that I am not frightened of it or of you.

488
00:51:51,903 --> 00:51:56,241
Henry's been very ill. He's in no state
to be alarmed or annoyed.

489
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:58,702
Your visit now is most unwelcome.

490
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:05,375
Henry, I heard the carriage drive up.
I'll see that the baggage is put in.

491
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:08,211
Then we're leaving.

492
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,511
I think you know why I am here, Henry.

493
00:52:18,221 --> 00:52:22,976
All the necessary preparations are made.
My part in the experiments is complete.

494
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:29,024
I have created, by my method, a perfect
human brain-already living, but dormant.

495
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:32,944
Everything is now ready for you and me
to begin our supreme collaboration.

496
00:52:33,028 --> 00:52:37,073
No, no. Don't tell me of it.
I don't want to hear.

497
00:52:37,157 --> 00:52:41,536
I've changed my mind. I won't do it.

498
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:43,329
I expected this.

499
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:47,334
I thought we might need
another assistant.

500
00:52:48,543 --> 00:52:50,628
Perhaps "he" can persuade you.

501
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:54,424
- Nothing can persuade me.
- We shall see.

502
00:52:56,384 --> 00:53:01,556
- No! Not that!
- Oh, he's harmless, except when crossed.

503
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:10,273
Frankenstein.

504
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:14,986
Yes, there have been developments
since he came to me.

505
00:53:24,662 --> 00:53:26,915
Sit down.

506
00:53:29,918 --> 00:53:33,546
- What do you want?
- You know.

507
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,049
- This is your work.
- Yes.

508
00:53:36,132 --> 00:53:38,301
I'll have no hand
in such a monstrous thing.

509
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:41,805
- Yes. Must.
- Get him out.

510
00:53:41,888 --> 00:53:43,890
I won't even discuss it until he's gone.

511
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,434
Go now.

512
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:52,315
Go.

513
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:08,289
- Must do it.
- Nothing can make me go on with it.

514
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:16,006
Now.

515
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:36,818
Put the bags in the carriage
and I'll be out in a moment.

516
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:40,947
Go and tell the master to hurry,
Minnie, or we shall lose the train.

517
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,870
Excuse me for being so nervous, milady,

518
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:49,539
but I don't like leaving you alone.

519
00:54:49,622 --> 00:54:53,960
- Oh, nonsense, Minnie, I shall be all right.
- I hope so, milady.

520
00:54:59,924 --> 00:55:02,010
Is that you, Henry?

521
00:55:21,112 --> 00:55:23,114
Henry! Henry, help!

522
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:25,909
Henry!

523
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,203
Milady!

524
00:55:29,704 --> 00:55:33,917
- Elizabeth.

525
00:55:37,337 --> 00:55:39,381
What is it? What's the matter?

526
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:41,758
Oh, sir, she's gone!

527
00:55:42,008 --> 00:55:44,552
The monster, he's got her!

528
00:55:44,636 --> 00:55:47,681
I saw it. The baroness is gone!

529
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:53,186
This is Pretorius' doing. Quick, search
parties. There's not a moment to lose.

530
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:59,192
I charge you,
as you value your mistress' life,

531
00:55:59,275 --> 00:56:02,570
to do nothing
and say nothing of this episode.

532
00:56:02,654 --> 00:56:05,824
I assure you that the baroness
will be safely returned,

533
00:56:05,907 --> 00:56:08,410
if you will leave everything to me.

534
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:13,289
Nothing, that is, except what he demands.

535
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,940
I can find no trace of Elizabeth.

536
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,278
Oh, I admit I'm beaten.

537
00:56:44,195 --> 00:56:46,990
But if you can bring her back,

538
00:56:47,073 --> 00:56:49,325
I'll do anything that you want.

539
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:52,954
Are you ready to complete with me
this final experiment?

540
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:55,665
- What about Elizabeth?
- She is well,

541
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:59,586
and will be safely returned
if you will proceed.

542
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,422
- I'm ready.
- Ah.

543
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:19,564
Mind the steps.
They're a bit slimy, I expect.

544
00:57:19,647 --> 00:57:21,733
I think it's a charming house.

545
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:38,833
It is interesting to think
that once upon a time

546
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:43,046
we should have been burnt at the stake
as wizards for this experiment.

547
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:46,174
Doctor, I think the heart is beating.

548
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:53,306
Look. It's beating.

549
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:57,686
- But the rhythm of the beat is uneven.
- Increase the saline solution.

550
00:58:01,439 --> 00:58:05,902
- Is there any life yet?
- No, not life itself yet.

551
00:58:05,985 --> 00:58:08,655
This is only the simulacrum of life.

552
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:12,367
This action only responds
when the current is applied.

553
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:17,205
We must be patient. The heart is more
complex than any other part of the body.

554
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:20,917
Look. The beat is increasing.

555
00:58:21,001 --> 00:58:23,420
Yes...

556
00:58:24,004 --> 00:58:26,965
- It's stopped.
- Shall I increase the current?

557
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:32,429
This heart is useless.

558
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:37,976
I must have another.
And it must be sound and young.

559
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:42,272
Karl.

560
00:58:43,314 --> 00:58:46,568
You must go to your friend
at the accident hospital.

561
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:51,114
What we need is a female victim
of sudden death. Can you do it?

562
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:53,825
If you promise me a thousand crowns.

563
00:58:53,908 --> 00:58:57,328
It will be well worth it,
and the baron will pay.

564
00:58:57,412 --> 00:59:00,999
- Yes, yes. Go and get it.
- I'll try.

565
00:59:09,466 --> 00:59:12,594
There are always
accidental deaths occurring.

566
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,971
Always.

567
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:17,223
I'll get your heart.

568
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:20,685
I'll go into that room, I'll go into that room
and I'll take my knife out.

569
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:23,521
I'll get her. I'll hold her down
and there she'll be.

570
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:26,024
Where, I ask you? Where will she be?

571
00:59:27,525 --> 00:59:29,611
A thousand crowns.

572
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:45,919
It's beating perfectly. Just as in life.

573
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:49,631
- Oh, if only I can keep it going until...
- It was a very fresh one.

574
00:59:51,925 --> 00:59:54,260
Where did you get it?

575
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:57,430
I gave the gendarme 50 crowns.

576
00:59:57,514 --> 01:00:01,017
- What gendarme?
- It was a...

577
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:05,814
- police case.
- Yes, very sad.

578
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:09,526
Only, we can't bother about that now.
Can I do anything?

579
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:14,114
No, no, no! I can work better alone.

580
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,634
- Work.
- Where's Elizabeth?

581
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:38,555
- Have you brought her?
- She wait. I wait.

582
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:41,641
I'm exhausted. I must get sleep.

583
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:45,353
Work. Finish. Then sleep.

584
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:49,190
But I can't work like this.
He must go away. Send him away.

585
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,651
I'll settle him for a little while.

586
01:00:53,945 --> 01:00:56,031
Drink.

587
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:12,088
Drink.

588
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:17,844
Good.

589
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:38,698
That'll keep you quiet.

590
01:01:39,949 --> 01:01:42,535
Elizabeth-she's dead.

591
01:01:42,619 --> 01:01:45,246
Elizabeth is alive and she is well.

592
01:01:45,747 --> 01:01:49,167
- I don't believe you.
- I have proof.

593
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:52,253
- Proof?
- In a few moments from now,

594
01:01:52,337 --> 01:01:56,257
she will speak to you from where she is
through this electrical machine.

595
01:01:56,591 --> 01:01:59,511
- Where is she?
- Not far from here.

596
01:02:02,013 --> 01:02:04,974
Speak, and she will hear you and answer.

597
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:09,020
Yes, yes, this is Henry.

598
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:14,484
Henry, yes, I'm safe. But, oh, Henry,
how long? Come for me. I'm in...

599
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:17,028
Elizabeth? Elizabeth!

600
01:02:17,654 --> 01:02:21,199
- She's gone.
- That is all now. But you heard her.

601
01:02:21,282 --> 01:02:23,660
Yes, she's alive.

602
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:27,330
As soon as our work is completed
she will be returned to you.

603
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:33,837
The heart is beating more regularly now.

604
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:38,967
Yes, it's been beating for nine hours.

605
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:43,179
Not yet, but soon...

606
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:47,100
- And the brain?
- Perfect and already in position.

607
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:50,562
- Then we are almost ready.
- Almost.

608
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,441
Shall we put the heart in now?

609
01:02:54,816 --> 01:02:56,901
- Yes.
- Ludwig.

610
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:17,339
It's beating quite normally now.

611
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:19,507
Bring it over.

612
01:03:32,979 --> 01:03:36,066
- The storm is rising.
- All right.

613
01:03:38,818 --> 01:03:41,154
The air is heavy with electricity.

614
01:03:41,237 --> 01:03:43,365
It's going to be a terrific storm.

615
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:47,452
We shall be ready.

616
01:03:52,749 --> 01:03:57,379
Isn't it amazing, Henry,
that lying here within this cowl

617
01:03:57,462 --> 01:04:00,632
is an artificially developed human brain?

618
01:04:00,715 --> 01:04:05,845
Each cell, each convolution ready,
waiting for life to come.

619
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:11,559
Look. The storm is coming up
over the mountains.

620
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:15,271
- It will be here soon.
- The kites. Are the kites ready?

621
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:18,274
- Yes.
- Send them up as soon as the wind rises.

622
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:21,903
- Hurry, hurry!
- The kites, the kites, get 'em ready.

623
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,616
Ludwig!

624
01:04:38,753 --> 01:04:40,672
He wants the kites!

625
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:47,220
Stand back.

626
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:00,316
Careful on the roof!

627
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:09,743
The big diffuser!

628
01:05:20,128 --> 01:05:22,255
Wires! Slip down your wires!

629
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:32,974
All right. Stop your winches.
I'm coming up!

630
01:05:42,776 --> 01:05:46,321
- Now, off with the kites!
- You take number two, Ludwig.

631
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:50,158
- Have you made your connections?
- Yes.

632
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:52,327
Stand by!

633
01:05:53,244 --> 01:05:55,246
Let go of number one!

634
01:05:58,291 --> 01:06:00,377
Let her go!

635
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:01,855
It's coming up!

636
01:08:06,544 --> 01:08:08,463
- Go back. Go back down!

637
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:10,632
Go back!

638
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:14,469
No! Get away! Frankenstein!

639
01:08:14,552 --> 01:08:17,222
Get away! Get away!

640
01:08:22,185 --> 01:08:24,145
Don't come near me!

641
01:08:25,730 --> 01:08:28,817
Get away! Don't! No! No!

642
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:33,405
Don't! Don't!

643
01:09:03,601 --> 01:09:06,062
Raise the cosmic diffuser.

644
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:14,237
Remove the diffuser bands.

645
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,555
She's alive! Alive!

646
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,941
The bride of Frankenstein.

647
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:26,911
Friend?

648
01:11:30,749 --> 01:11:32,584
Friend?

649
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,856
- Stand back. Stand back.

650
01:12:21,591 --> 01:12:25,720
She hate me. Like others.

651
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,986
- Look out! The lever!
- Get away from that lever!

652
01:12:42,445 --> 01:12:45,073
You'll blow us all to atoms.

653
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:48,618
Henry!

654
01:12:48,702 --> 01:12:51,454
Open the door! Henry!

655
01:12:51,538 --> 01:12:55,375
- Get back! Get back!
- I won't unless you come!

656
01:12:56,584 --> 01:12:58,920
But I can't leave them! I can't!

657
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:02,799
Yes, go! You live!

658
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,301
Go!

659
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:08,680
You stay.

660
01:13:08,763 --> 01:13:11,016
We belong dead.

661
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,273
Darling, darling.
