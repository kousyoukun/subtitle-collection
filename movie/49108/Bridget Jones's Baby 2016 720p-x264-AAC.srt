1
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:37,793
Happy birthday to me.
Happy birthday to me.

2
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:41,933
How in hell did I end up here again..

3
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:45,600
Fuck off.

4
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:57,225
My birthday actually began
the way of all my birthdays.

5
00:03:07,844 --> 00:03:10,716
Hello darling. Just ringing
to wish you a happy birthday.

6
00:03:10,844 --> 00:03:13,413
Mom? It's six a.m.

7
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:16,968
I'm doing the FaceTime.
Una taught me. It's really marvellous.

8
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:21,008
Mum, the point of FaceTime is that you
haven't got to put the phone to your ear.

9
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:24,008
Oh, please.. Oh, there you are.

10
00:03:24,132 --> 00:03:26,800
This time, 43 years ago...

11
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:30,535
I was having a lamb beriyami in an
attempt to coax you out.

12
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:34,416
23 hours of labour.
Never been the same down there.

13
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:38,013
It's a miracle, the gift of childbirth.
- Here it comes.

14
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:41,344
Penny Husband-Bosworth's son
sells his sperm on the internet.

15
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,457
You don't need a man, Bridget.

16
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:46,652
Some people have marvellous lives
without them. Look at you.

17
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:49,260
Nice flat, lovely job...

18
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:52,468
Nice flat...
- I'm putting the phone down now, mum.

19
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:56,632
Say happy birthday to Bridget. Colin?

20
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,384
Happy birthday to Bridget.

21
00:03:59,176 --> 00:04:00,638
Thank you.

22
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:02,844
I love you darling. Now don't forget...

23
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,636
I'm counting on you to head up
my media campaign.

24
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:09,384
It's the parish council elections, mum.
Not the US primaries.

25
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,800
The annual phone call from mum reminding
me to take my ovaries out of retirement.

26
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:20,968
The truth was that by now I thought
I would have had a little baby to love

27
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,300
with the chisel jawed love of my life.

28
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:26,968
But sometimes life gives
you shallower compensations

29
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:30,592
and at least I was finally down
to my perfect weight.

30
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:33,344
Good morning, Ms. Bridget.

31
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:35,052
You look beautiful again today.

32
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:37,884
There was life in the old dog yet.

33
00:04:38,008 --> 00:04:41,052
Haven't exactly been put out to grass.

34
00:04:41,176 --> 00:04:43,176
Hah! Ding dong..

35
00:04:44,344 --> 00:04:47,968
But this year all these things
were brought into sharper focus...

36
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:52,216
by an event I hadn't expected
to attend quite so soon.

37
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:06,099
Hi.

38
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,081
So how are you feeling? Are you ok?

39
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:14,304
Mm. Yeah.

40
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,535
I just can't believe he's gone, really.

41
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:39,622
His death seems to have
hit the eastern European

42
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,222
teenage modelling community
particularly hard.

43
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:47,260
They found the flight recorder
but still no bodies.

44
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:51,676
Strangely fitting that he should
have died going down in the bush.

45
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,260
We are gathered here
to celebrate the life...

46
00:06:01,384 --> 00:06:04,949
of Daniel Vivian Cleaver.

47
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:10,132
Daniel was a kind and wonderful son...

48
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:13,345
Fuck. What the fuck is he doing here?

49
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,344
You know what he's like,
wanting to do the decent thing.

50
00:06:18,944 --> 00:06:20,455
Is that his wife?

51
00:06:21,884 --> 00:06:24,592
Did I ever get over losing Mr. Darcy?

52
00:06:24,945 --> 00:06:27,237
Was he my Mr. Right?

53
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:28,760
Oh Christ.

54
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:34,092
A man of outstanding charm and charisma.

55
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:37,971
Just a bit emotional.
- I would like to invite his loved ones up...

56
00:06:38,884 --> 00:06:43,884
to share some of their
memories of Daniel.

57
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,092
Daniel could be very sensitive ...

58
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:51,116
Make you feel like you were
the only woman in the world.

59
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:52,789
I first met Daniel in Moscow.

60
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,709
He once took me rowing on the
Serpentine and quoted Keats by heart.

61
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,424
He could quote Keats by heart.
- Where be ye going, you Devon maid.

62
00:07:00,552 --> 00:07:03,716
And what have you there in the basket?
- Where are you going, you Devon maid.

63
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:06,424
And what have you there in the basket?

64
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,705
You tight little fairy,
just fresh from the dairy.

65
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:13,344
Will you give me some cream if I ask it?

66
00:07:17,592 --> 00:07:19,220
He did it to everyone.

67
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:22,924
Anybody else like to say a few words?

68
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:24,909
Say something for his mum.

69
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,508
Come on.

70
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:44,715
Daniel was a man ...

71
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,478
who touched many of us here today,
including me.

72
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,390
Oh dear.

73
00:07:57,424 --> 00:08:00,945
This is when Daniel would say,
"Shut up, Jones."

74
00:08:00,956 --> 00:08:05,344
And he would be right,
because all I really need to say is...

75
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:10,052
Dear Daniel, I will miss you terribly.

76
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,052
We all will.

77
00:08:18,176 --> 00:08:20,884
Give you a call?
- Yes very good. Bye bye.

78
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:23,626
Bridget.
- Mark.

79
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:26,672
This is Camilla.
- Hello.

80
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:28,694
Bridget, an old friend.

81
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:31,973
Well, less old, more childhood.

82
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:34,935
So...

83
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:39,203
Nice memorial, as memorials go.

84
00:08:39,223 --> 00:08:42,545
Almost makes one look
forward to one's own.

85
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:46,366
Yes, well...

86
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,517
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

87
00:08:53,148 --> 00:08:56,419
Maybe that's the reason Mark
Darcy and I never made it.

88
00:08:56,614 --> 00:09:00,946
I always felt like a verbally incontinent
old maid, even when we were together.

89
00:09:01,552 --> 00:09:04,484
Still, I wasn't going to
dwell on the negatives.

90
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:07,384
At least no-one at work
knew it was my birthday.

91
00:09:07,642 --> 00:09:10,196
Or indeed, how old I was going to be.

92
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Surprise.

93
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,800
Congratulations, Bridget.

94
00:09:15,811 --> 00:09:18,395
Or so I thought.

95
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:20,695
Who told you?

96
00:09:20,706 --> 00:09:23,250
It's so hot. So many candles.

97
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:34,560
Isn't there some sort of statute
of limitations about the

98
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,860
number of sodding candles on a cake
once you get to a certain age?

99
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:43,465
Josh, I need you to see what Reuters
is saying about the attacks on Ramallah.

100
00:09:43,476 --> 00:09:45,165
We might need a live link. And Laura...

101
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:47,959
I may have been another
year older and still single...

102
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,057
but I could always take consolation
in my job as top news producer.

103
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:55,044
So,
how will I be changing the world today?

104
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:58,143
Well, our main feature is the
exclusive interview...

105
00:09:58,154 --> 00:10:00,924
with the Foreign Secretary about NGochi.

106
00:10:01,052 --> 00:10:04,140
Oh, gee. How did you do that?
- NGochi.

107
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,589
NGochi.
- You're good at that.

108
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,300
I know. I've been practising. NGochi.

109
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:14,039
It's harder than you think.

110
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,470
Plus, have great new 30
something work colleagues

111
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,870
who are not obsessed with
children and marriage.

112
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,064
How do we plan on celebrating tonight?

113
00:10:21,075 --> 00:10:24,737
Well, night out with the gang.
- Please say that involves group sex.

114
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:27,491
Gangbangs? Ooh, we'd like to do that.

115
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,993
I know a smashing little club
in the back of Berwick Street.

116
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,885
Chance would be a fine thing.

117
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,743
I'm beginning to think I'm
past my sexual sell by date.

118
00:10:34,754 --> 00:10:37,637
No. There are names for women
like you now, Bridge.

119
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:39,979
You're a cougar. You are a MILF.

120
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,649
I'm not a MILF, I'm not even a mum.
I am a spinster, I'm a SPILF.

121
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,888
Three minutes 'till we're on air.
- It's called Voyeurz with a 'z'.

122
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,706
You tell them that Cathy sent you.

123
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,316
If you go on a Thursday there's a Chinese
buffet. All you can eat, as it were.

124
00:10:56,552 --> 00:11:01,179
But whose advice was, never the less,
sometimes a tad too modern for me.

125
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,459
It's me, checking talk-back.
- Yep.

126
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,075
You didn't freeze your eggs
by any chance, did you?

127
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:09,675
No,
I imagine they're hard boiled by now.

128
00:11:09,686 --> 00:11:11,714
You know what, Bridge? This weekend...

129
00:11:11,725 --> 00:11:14,676
you and me need to go out,
and get stuck into some serious...

130
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,906
"Binge drinking,
a dangerous scourge on society."

131
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,910
Is new legislation needed?

132
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:25,664
Bridget, Miranda, I've told you,
don't talk between the bongs.

133
00:11:26,014 --> 00:11:28,205
Stick to the questions on the cue cards.

134
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:29,373
Miranda. Cue.

135
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:31,901
The Foreign Secretary will
be live in the studio...

136
00:11:31,912 --> 00:11:35,002
to talk about the looming
crisis in Muribundi.

137
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,147
You can always try online dating again.

138
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:42,178
The other night I was on Tinder. Half
an hour later I'm having a 3-way with...

139
00:11:42,189 --> 00:11:46,169
Prince Andrew, the Royal Special
Representative for Trade and Investment...

140
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,807
He did that on purpose. ...has just
written his first children's book.

141
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,699
He had a massive cock.

142
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,028
Live in the studio I'm joined by
Foreign Secretary George Wilkins...

143
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,588
who has just returned from
war ravaged Muribundi...

144
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,510
Miranda, I'm in your ear.
Just follow my lead.

145
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,566
...Where the assassination of
bloody dictator Charles NGochi...

146
00:12:04,577 --> 00:12:07,716
has resulted in civil war.
- One shot, come back to four. Four.

147
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,960
Minister, was this a military coup?

148
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,860
- Well, the signs are that NGochi's
own generals did take him out...

149
00:12:12,884 --> 00:12:14,789
Hi, Tom. I can't talk.

150
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:18,149
How was Daniel's memorial?
- It was just sad.

151
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,974
I can't believe he's gone.

152
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:22,626
It's sad.
I can't believe he's gone, actually.

153
00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:28,220
Ah... I don't think there was any
particular sadness in his passing.

154
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:31,544
His persecution of the Ubuntu
people amounted to genocide.

155
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:34,941
And that is well documented.
- I know he had his flaws.

156
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:38,108
Well, I know he had his flaws.
- He could be a massive asshole.

157
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,957
He could be a massive asshole.

158
00:12:41,335 --> 00:12:45,796
But I miss him. We all do.
- But I miss him. We all do.

159
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,966
Well, he was certainly a very colorful
character on the world stage Miranda...

160
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:53,443
I grant you that,
but I think the genocide...

161
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:57,177
resulting in the deaths of over 10,000 of
his own people, men, women and children...

162
00:12:57,188 --> 00:12:59,585
probably rather put him on
the wrong side of history.

163
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:01,412
At least he was never boring.

164
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:03,412
Well, at least he was never boring.

165
00:13:04,598 --> 00:13:06,468
One, two, three clear.

166
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:10,292
Do you think a spirit of democracy can
carry over into West Africa...

167
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:12,003
Now that's NGochi's dead?

168
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:15,001
Do you think, minister,
that the spirit of democracy can

169
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,901
carry over into West Africa
now that NGochi is dead?

170
00:13:18,012 --> 00:13:20,682
Well now, that is an
interesting question. Finally.

171
00:13:20,693 --> 00:13:22,355
We're running out of time.
- Miranda, wrap it up.

172
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,464
Briefly, please, Minister.
- Well it is a complicated issue.

173
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:25,833
A 'yes' or a 'no'.

174
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:28,705
Miranda, make it the last answer.
- Let's hope so.

175
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:31,843
I'll take that. Thank you for
joining us on the sofa today.

176
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,248
Over to you, Toby.

177
00:13:35,468 --> 00:13:37,676
Thank you, Miranda, Bridget.

178
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:41,453
You couldn't just behave yourselves when
the new management team were here?

179
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:43,002
They're the new management team?

180
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:45,932
That is Alice Peabody,
new brand manager.

181
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:49,675
Apparently 'Hard News'
is too old fashioned, too serious...

182
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:54,007
and she is the smiling assassin, brought
in to sack anybody older than her.

183
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,897
Everybody's older than her. I've got tins
of soup in my cupboard older than her.

184
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:04,244
Look at them all.
With their apps and their ironic beards

185
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:06,863
Maybe one of them could
get Bridget some sex.

186
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:08,780
What?
- Bridget? Do you need sex?

187
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:09,800
No.
- Yes.

188
00:14:10,386 --> 00:14:14,529
That's why I'm taking her on an a girls
weekend to beat all girls weekends.

189
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,767
Bridget, isn't it?

190
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,786
Yes, nice to...
- Team meeting tomorrow morning.

191
00:14:21,797 --> 00:14:23,801
We can do introductions then.

192
00:14:31,306 --> 00:14:32,568
Nine a.m.

193
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,513
We should all start an
hour earlier from now on.

194
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:40,926
Do you think she saw that?
- Quite possibly not.

195
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:44,196
And you're sure you don't want to
come out with me and my crew?

196
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:47,689
Thanks, but can't let the old gang down.

197
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,999
They're stay at home moms now.
They'd be disappointed.

198
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:06,969
Thank God for the gays.

199
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:13,809
Now, whatever fears you're
bringing in the room with you today...

200
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,095
I want you take those fears and I want
you to tell them to fuck the fuck off.

201
00:15:18,106 --> 00:15:19,106
Yeah!

202
00:15:20,632 --> 00:15:24,424
Are you ready for this?
- Yes.

203
00:15:24,552 --> 00:15:27,632
Then ride, you sexy bitches! Ride!

204
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:35,815
Look, I'm so sorry, Bridget, but I'm
actually going to have to blow you out too.

205
00:15:37,716 --> 00:15:42,352
I didn't want to have to tell you this
today, but Eduardo and I are adopting.

206
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,901
Adopting?

207
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:47,922
What, a baby?
- Yes, a baby.

208
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:50,564
Or gayby, in our case.

209
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:54,369
That's fantastic news, Tom.

210
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,577
I'm going to Bogota tomorrow to start
the paperwork so I've got to go and pack.

211
00:15:57,588 --> 00:15:59,712
Wonderful, go.

212
00:15:59,723 --> 00:16:01,620
Happy Birthday. Have fun.

213
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,802
Congratulations.
- Thank's darl.

214
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:08,016
Fucking excellent.

215
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:12,066
And that was how I wound
up back here again.

216
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,954
The last barren husk in London...

217
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:20,986
and of the two loves of my life,
one is married and the other is dead.

218
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,591
Right, new birthday resolutions.

219
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:28,418
I, Bridget Jones am done
with affairs of the heart...

220
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:32,468
and dedicating my autumn
years to the pursuit of hedonism.

221
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,671
Will hang only with new free
spirited friends like Miranda...

222
00:16:35,682 --> 00:16:40,976
and when the going gets tough,
the tough go on a luxury spa weekend.

223
00:16:42,489 --> 00:16:44,217
What the fuck.

224
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,392
Love the shoes.

225
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:04,350
I didn't tell you,
because you wouldn't have come.

226
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,597
Seriously, it's been five years.

227
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,608
You've gotta shake yourself out of this
self imposed purge you've been in...

228
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,541
ever since you split up with your
precious Mark Darcy.

229
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:15,567
Rubbish. I barely think of him.

230
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:18,100
What you need is a good shafting.

231
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:21,846
You need some good old fashioned,
lie back and think of England bonking...

232
00:17:21,857 --> 00:17:27,529
and festivals are sexual free for alls
like Sodom and Gomorrah with tofu.

233
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,759
First man you meet you've
gotta sleep with.

234
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,436
The first man?
I'm not taking no for an answer.

235
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:36,231
I'm gonna find our backstage passes.
You get the maps.

236
00:17:41,876 --> 00:17:42,976
Maps.

237
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:47,938
I may be old and inappropriately dressed,
but at least I look fucking amazing.

238
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:57,976
That's exactly why I
didn't wear my heels.

239
00:17:58,777 --> 00:18:00,808
Ding fucking dong.

240
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,819
May I?

241
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,526
Thank you.

242
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,144
It fits.

243
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:31,992
Bridget.

244
00:18:32,755 --> 00:18:34,198
Bridget.

245
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,976
Is that your wicked stepmother?
- Yes.

246
00:18:38,176 --> 00:18:41,976
I better go before she has me
sweeping fireplaces all day.

247
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,396
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

248
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,895
Ah ha. Birthday resolution number two.

249
00:18:48,906 --> 00:18:52,687
Must remember the way to a man's heart
is not through beauty, sex or love...

250
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:53,698
It's Jack.

251
00:18:53,807 --> 00:18:57,892
But merely the ability to
fall arse over tit in the mud.

252
00:18:57,955 --> 00:18:59,287
By the way.

253
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:01,587
Right.

254
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,892
Which one's ours?
- Let's try up here.

255
00:19:06,151 --> 00:19:09,403
And anyway, it's not camping,
it's glamping.

256
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:12,709
Putting a G L in front of it
doesn't make it any better.

257
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,312
Calling him Gladolf Hitler wouldn't suddenly
make you forget all the unpleasantness.

258
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:26,572
Oh... fuck me!

259
00:19:31,657 --> 00:19:33,365
NGochi.

260
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,911
NGochi.

261
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:44,693
NGochi.

262
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,902
It's 2:30 in the afternoon.
I should be Hoovering.

263
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:11,998
This is incredible.
We've got to get a photo.

264
00:20:12,427 --> 00:20:13,609
Excuse me?

265
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:17,209
Do you mind if we ask you
to take a photo of us?

266
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,052
Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

267
00:20:21,131 --> 00:20:23,308
Alright. Are you ready?
Hey. What're you doing?

268
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,391
I was taking your photo.

269
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:28,257
I thought you guys wanted a photo.
- Yeah, we do. Of us.

270
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:32,332
Yes. Terribly sorry. We thought it'd
be really fun to get a photo of us...

271
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:34,106
backstage among all
these glamorous people.

272
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,181
I think that's the guy from
'Bargain Hunt'.

273
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:39,475
It'd be great if you could get him in the shot.
- Quick. Quick.

274
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:43,463
So you don't want me in the photo at all?
- No, and you can lose the attitude, babe.

275
00:20:43,474 --> 00:20:45,308
Is it really that difficult?

276
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:49,056
They let any old riff-raff
backstage nowadays.

277
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:53,184
I don't know. I thought he was
kind of cute. He looks familiar.

278
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,986
I think he works
at the Starbucks at Balham.

279
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,224
One, two, three, singing.

280
00:21:15,016 --> 00:21:17,786
Oh my God.

281
00:21:18,072 --> 00:21:21,724
I know. It's the guy from Starbucks.

282
00:21:21,735 --> 00:21:23,235
Crowdsurfing.

283
00:21:42,073 --> 00:21:43,533
Miranda.

284
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:46,797
Miranda?

285
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,058
Miranda?

286
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:55,768
Hey, Miranda.

287
00:21:56,805 --> 00:21:58,795
Oh, God.

288
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:04,352
I have to admit, that was fun.

289
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:06,809
And you're right ...

290
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:11,267
What I need is a good shafting...

291
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:16,982
some good old-fashioned,
lie back and-think-of-England...

292
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:19,100
bonking.

293
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,892
Well, sign me up.

294
00:22:22,054 --> 00:22:23,724
Oh my God.

295
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:27,558
What are you doing in my yurt?

296
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:33,432
With all your clothes,
and luggage and possessions.

297
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,885
Yeah, it's as if I've come in,
made it my own.

298
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,266
Wait, it's you,
the creature from the Black Lagoon.

299
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,852
Yes. Sorry.

300
00:22:41,863 --> 00:22:46,100
You don't really expect me to believe that
you accidentally crashed into my yurt, do you?

301
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:50,642
Since you're here, maybe I can help you.

302
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,308
Well, he is the first man I met...

303
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,850
and his yurt is one heck
of a lot nicer than mine.

304
00:22:58,892 --> 00:23:03,352
Bridget, where the fuck are you?

305
00:23:03,476 --> 00:23:07,832
Bridget, I'm so pissed.

306
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,144
Bridget.

307
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:59,976
I'm zorbing with Ed Sheeran.

308
00:24:24,144 --> 00:24:25,724
Oh, God.

309
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,852
I just slept with a complete stranger.
I'm nothing but a feckless prostitute.

310
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:36,308
No, no. I'm an elegant older woman
taking men for my own pleasure.

311
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,038
Or am I just a deluded middle-aged fool?

312
00:24:46,728 --> 00:24:48,352
Oh, fuck it.

313
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,352
Miranda?

314
00:24:53,132 --> 00:24:54,340
Good morning.

315
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,644
So it lasted six hours?

316
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:01,476
What lasted six hours, mum?

317
00:25:02,184 --> 00:25:05,432
A puppet show that
Auntie Bridget went to.

318
00:25:06,144 --> 00:25:09,549
A six-hour puppet show?
- Hello.

319
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,308
Tell me, were they little puppets or...?

320
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:14,308
Very nice size puppets.

321
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:17,684
And did he...

322
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,968
put his puppet in your mouth?

323
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:26,657
God! I feel like my days
of puppet shows are behind me.

324
00:25:30,768 --> 00:25:32,707
I've had finger puppets.

325
00:25:35,308 --> 00:25:39,016
And has he called?
- It doesn't work like that any more.

326
00:25:39,144 --> 00:25:42,516
You just hook up with rugged
troubadors at music festivals...

327
00:25:42,527 --> 00:25:44,385
and there are no strings.

328
00:25:44,932 --> 00:25:46,852
Puppets with no strings.

329
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,711
Take the wings off.
They're for little girls.

330
00:25:50,724 --> 00:25:52,354
Hello?
- Where the fuck are you?

331
00:25:52,365 --> 00:25:56,334
Speeding through lovely countryside
on our way to your christening.

332
00:25:56,345 --> 00:25:59,437
No we're not.
Why is auntie Bridget lying?

333
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:02,943
Bridge, I thought you should
know after Tom dropped out...

334
00:26:02,954 --> 00:26:05,215
Giles asked Mark to be the godfather.
- What?

335
00:26:05,226 --> 00:26:06,623
He did what?

336
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:08,852
Yes I know. He really is a useless cock.

337
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:10,516
Did it without asking me.

338
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:15,659
Oh my God. Mark Darcy again.

339
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:20,439
Twice in the space of a week I turn
up at church as rent-a-spinster.

340
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,733
Where the fuck were you?

341
00:26:32,363 --> 00:26:34,141
Sorry.

342
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,707
Good morning and welcome.

343
00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:45,652
Well, this isn't embarrassing at all.
Mark Darcy and I at the altar with a baby.

344
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,180
That's lovely.

345
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,199
Ok, now, nice big smiles.
Look at me. Thank you.

346
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,487
Lovely.

347
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:55,090
Ok, can I just get
the godparents now please.

348
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,869
How are you?
- Very well, thank you. How are you?

349
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,605
Well, thank you. Mm.

350
00:27:01,804 --> 00:27:05,092
Are you here with your wife?
I can't remember her name...

351
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:09,160
Camilla.
No, eh, no, she couldn't make it.

352
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,895
Are you here with anyone?
- No, no. Not today, no.

353
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,268
Come on, it's not a funeral.

354
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:17,321
Can I get a couple of
smiles out of you two, please?

355
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:19,845
Maybe give her a little kiss you know,
on the forehead, there.

356
00:27:23,238 --> 00:27:25,100
Ah, I was talking about the baby.

357
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,852
Lovely.

358
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:34,584
Alright.
I'll see you later, shouldn't wonder.

359
00:27:34,595 --> 00:27:38,193
Yes, unless I make a break
for it with this thing.

360
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,066
Could this day actually get
any more awkward?

361
00:27:42,271 --> 00:27:45,406
Just keep walking, keep walking,
keep walking. Keep walking.

362
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:58,994
Hello.
- Hello.

363
00:27:59,604 --> 00:28:02,287
How are you?
- Very well, thanks.

364
00:28:02,298 --> 00:28:03,758
How are you?
- I'm fine.

365
00:28:04,234 --> 00:28:05,606
So am I.

366
00:28:07,287 --> 00:28:09,664
Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

367
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:12,720
A glass of wine.
- A whiskey, please.

368
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:14,445
Big, big glass.
- Double.

369
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:15,683
Thank you.

370
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:55,144
I'd ask you to join me, but I'm pretty sure
you're not a big Gangnam Style kind of guy.

371
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:57,594
I was only there very briefly.
- Where?

372
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:58,641
Gangnam.

373
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:04,308
What are we talking about?
- Gangnam, dancing.

374
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:08,493
Not the suburb of Seoul?
- No.

375
00:29:08,504 --> 00:29:13,392
I'm not familiar with Gangnam, the suburb.
- It literally means south of the Han River.

376
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:18,111
It was inhabited as early as
the Paleolithic period.

377
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:22,179
Suddenly seems so much less catchy.

378
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,133
Now something for you lovers out there.

379
00:29:27,144 --> 00:29:31,848
We are entering the erection section. Don't
say fucking erection at a christening.

380
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:39,684
Would you like to get some air?

381
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:44,185
I mean, some more air.

382
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,702
Sure.

383
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:59,970
I don't suppose you happen to have a cigarette?
- No.

384
00:30:00,127 --> 00:30:03,751
I gave up 1891 days ago.

385
00:30:03,819 --> 00:30:05,556
Not that people're counting.

386
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,802
Since when did you smoke?
- I don't.

387
00:30:09,314 --> 00:30:10,898
It's been a tense time.

388
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:13,946
Maybe I'm nervous.

389
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:16,813
Why?

390
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:20,757
You have a train in your hair.

391
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:24,241
I'm aware of that.

392
00:30:25,098 --> 00:30:27,892
Courtesy of one of my many godchildren.

393
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:35,224
Seems to be stuck.

394
00:30:36,906 --> 00:30:38,614
And this would be...

395
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:41,861
Cake?
- Profiterole.

396
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:45,093
That's technically more of a dessert,
I suppose.

397
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:54,529
What're you doing? You're married.
- No, I'm not.

398
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:58,783
I mean, I'm getting a divorce.

399
00:30:59,078 --> 00:31:00,746
That's why she's not here.

400
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:07,025
Why were you together at the memorial?

401
00:31:07,195 --> 00:31:09,374
She was just being supportive.

402
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,134
She's gone back to The Hague,
where she's now living, and I'm not.

403
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:16,171
Oh, I'm so sorry, Mark.

404
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:19,075
At this precise moment
I'm not sorry at all.

405
00:32:34,681 --> 00:32:36,912
How the fuck am I
supposed to get in here?

406
00:32:48,209 --> 00:32:49,724
Again?

407
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:53,144
Mr. Darcy, wow.

408
00:32:56,144 --> 00:32:57,352
Bridget?

409
00:33:00,892 --> 00:33:02,432
God, I've missed you.

410
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:11,016
Are we on schedule?

411
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:14,392
I have a flight to Khartoum tomorrow.

412
00:33:51,808 --> 00:33:54,516
I'm so sorry, Mark. Had to leave.

413
00:33:54,644 --> 00:33:57,976
It probably sounds pathetic,
but I got scared.

414
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,224
The fact that we went 'round and 'round
for the best part of ten years...

415
00:34:01,352 --> 00:34:04,560
without ever making it across the
finish line leads me to think...

416
00:34:04,684 --> 00:34:07,976
we did the best thing
by ending it when we did.

417
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,516
Sometimes it feels scary
still being on my own at 43.

418
00:34:13,644 --> 00:34:16,352
But you and I have
been here once before.

419
00:34:18,516 --> 00:34:20,959
We always loved the fantasy of us...

420
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,858
But the reality,
as we both know, is quite different.

421
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:35,932
We could both come up with a 100
reasons why we didn't make it...

422
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,768
but in the end I always felt that you
were never there and I was mostly alone.

423
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:56,600
No, can't go back and keep
making same mistakes.

424
00:34:56,724 --> 00:35:00,445
Must keep moving forward
and make new ones.

425
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,075
And will lodge myself into
frenzied keep fit regimes.

426
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,903
And allowing 4 weeks to reduce
thighs circumference...

427
00:35:06,914 --> 00:35:10,970
to squeeze largy ass into
teenage skinny jeans...

428
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:14,361
Obviously not meant
for women of a certain age.

429
00:35:15,476 --> 00:35:19,149
All this bloody cycling is pointless.
I'm putting on weight.

430
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,839
Let's rule out some of the other options,
shall we? You're not pregnant, are you?

431
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,852
Of course not.

432
00:35:24,976 --> 00:35:30,245
A lady is always prepared and
I always carry these in my handbag.

433
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:34,375
Oh, God!
You didn't use those, the vegan condoms?

434
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,741
Biodegradable and dolphin friendly.

435
00:35:36,752 --> 00:35:40,184
If I'm going to be slutty, it's nice
to think I'm helping the environment.

436
00:35:40,308 --> 00:35:43,838
Christ, Bridget.
I remember when you bought those.

437
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:46,348
That was decades ago.

438
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,102
Sell by dates don't mean anything.

439
00:35:50,186 --> 00:35:51,186
Do they?

440
00:35:52,392 --> 00:35:55,067
They were a gift. Don't ask.

441
00:35:56,684 --> 00:36:01,009
Tumbling rapids, frothing waterfalls...

442
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,009
babbling brook.

443
00:36:06,169 --> 00:36:08,401
Oh, come the fuck on, Bridget.

444
00:36:20,808 --> 00:36:22,768
How long do you think it takes?

445
00:36:25,564 --> 00:36:28,245
I think that's a positive result.

446
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:30,438
Pregnant

447
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,505
I'll just make sure.
- Don't shake it.

448
00:36:34,516 --> 00:36:37,352
You'll hurt the baby.
- The baby is not in the stick.

449
00:36:39,343 --> 00:36:41,099
I think this is when you're meant to...

450
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:43,279
jump for joy.

451
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:47,358
Oh my God.
- You're pregnant.

452
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:49,892
I'm pregnant.
- You're pregnant.

453
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:54,522
I'm pregnant.
- You're going to have a baby.

454
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:57,318
I'm going to have a baby.

455
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:04,649
I'm going to have a baby.
- Yes.

456
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:12,684
If you've got footage of her
punching a horse, I want it.

457
00:37:12,841 --> 00:37:16,365
Bridget, do you want a baby?
- I don't know.

458
00:37:17,495 --> 00:37:19,995
I mean, I'm 43.

459
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:23,014
It might be the only chance
I'm going to get.

460
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:28,562
One broken, out of date condom I might
have believed was an acciddent.

461
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:30,399
But two?

462
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,653
You wanted it.

463
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:36,514
Maybe I did.

464
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:41,222
Can we get a medic please?

465
00:37:45,323 --> 00:37:49,276
Oh my God. I'm pregnant.

466
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,722
This is it.

467
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:55,558
More to the point, whose is it?

468
00:37:56,169 --> 00:38:00,014
This is not how I thought
this moment would be.

469
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:05,206
I always imagined myself in 'OK!'
Magazine with the man of my dreams.

470
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:08,340
Oh Christ! Too many dilemmas to ponder.

471
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,872
Not least of all...

472
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,996
Who was that man I shagged in a tent?

473
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:17,987
And so you're age will be 43?

474
00:38:21,587 --> 00:38:22,887
So, umm...

475
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:30,259
Which of the times with my wonderful
man do you think we got pregnant on?

476
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,806
Does it matter?

477
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,519
Well, yes, it's such a special moment.

478
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,619
We'd like to know which one
it is so we can treasure it.

479
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:42,955
Can't you treasure both of them?
- Yes, we will, we do.

480
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:47,266
But surely one of those days is
more likely than the other?

481
00:38:47,624 --> 00:38:53,598
Well, actually, day 10, which was
his birthday, is a little early.

482
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:57,934
And day 16 which was the...
- Anniversary dinner.

483
00:38:57,945 --> 00:39:01,350
Oh yes, the Osso Buco, I recall,
is a little late.

484
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:04,495
Are you sure there wasn't another
treasurable occasion in between?

485
00:39:04,901 --> 00:39:08,539
Yes, I'm quite sure. He was away.

486
00:39:10,026 --> 00:39:12,358
So which of the two would you go for?

487
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:15,934
Couldn't say. They're both equally likely.
It could have been after the event.

488
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,738
Because as you know, sperm can live
for several days after ejaculation.

489
00:39:18,841 --> 00:39:21,269
Couldn't you just have a guess for me?
- No.

490
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:25,266
What about the first scan? Would
that show when conception took place?

491
00:39:25,277 --> 00:39:27,806
No. Ring this number to fix a date.

492
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:30,890
And do bring along the father,
if you can work out which one he is.

493
00:39:32,743 --> 00:39:33,867
Right.

494
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:36,267
Right.

495
00:39:37,306 --> 00:39:43,642
Just out of interest... If someone did have
an element of confusion about the father...

496
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:48,406
Well, you can get a DNA sample at the
amniocentesis, and I do recommend that you have

497
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:52,474
the amniocentesis, because there are
always more risks with a geriatric mother.

498
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:56,135
Geriatric? Hmm.

499
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,266
That's outrageous.
- Indeed.

500
00:40:00,783 --> 00:40:04,863
Unless you can sign on for your child
support and pension at the same time.

501
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:07,963
That's hilarious.

502
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,963
It's called "news"
'cause it should feel new.

503
00:40:12,974 --> 00:40:15,999
Otherwise, it be called "olds".

504
00:40:16,151 --> 00:40:17,277
Sorry.

505
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:20,687
Last night. Top stories.

506
00:40:20,698 --> 00:40:23,029
Earthquake in Asia, seen it before.

507
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:26,058
Car crash on the M5... Blah blah blah

508
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:29,910
We're making 'old's.
We need to flip the switch, mix it up.

509
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:33,031
I want a new triple on the shit out.
- She's on the warpath.

510
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:36,514
Susan, the floor manager's gone.
- She's six months pregnant.

511
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:40,498
We've got to grab the attention,
get the eyes on the screen.

512
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,369
I want to see headlines like:
"Is Your Sofa Bed Giving You Cancer?"

513
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:50,023
"Is Your Freezer Giving You Alzheimers?"
- Oh my God. Are they?

514
00:40:50,062 --> 00:40:54,107
Literally no evidence whatsoever, but you're
missing the point. You're intrigued, aren't you?

515
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:59,036
I want to reload 'Hard News'
with a clear new objective.

516
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:02,204
We have a presentation in twelve
weeks at the London Media Show...

517
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,917
and I'm looking for someone dynamic,
innovative, focused...

518
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:09,073
to lead the charge. Any volunteers?

519
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:12,034
Whatever happens now,
must hold on to job.

520
00:41:12,058 --> 00:41:15,558
Must prove to fascist boss
that I may be single mother...

521
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,312
but am willing to roll with the
ironic bearded hipsters.

522
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,558
Anybody at all?

523
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:25,679
Do you need to leave, Bridget?
- No, I want to volunteer.

524
00:41:25,988 --> 00:41:28,235
Hashtag: "Let's do this!"

525
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:43,415
It's me. Turn on your TV now. Look at
your TV. Now. Now. Now. Turn on Channel 4.

526
00:41:46,514 --> 00:41:50,881
Bridget, I've found him.
He's the dating website guru.

527
00:41:50,897 --> 00:41:54,851
See, you have to trust the science.
Algorithms don't lie.

528
00:41:54,878 --> 00:41:58,305
You slept with a fucking billionaire.

529
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:03,207
So, tell us, Bridget.

530
00:42:03,508 --> 00:42:07,061
What was it that initially attracted you
to the billionaire Jack Qwant?

531
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:10,803
Was it his face, or his body? Big dick?
- I'd do it with him, obviously.

532
00:42:10,842 --> 00:42:13,009
If I were you I wouldn't
tell either of them.

533
00:42:13,024 --> 00:42:18,602
All you need is a DNA sample from one of them and then
you can eliminate the other one from your enquiries.

534
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:23,034
What would I say to Mark? "Hello Mark,
I know I just left you asleep...

535
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:27,327
but do you have any blood,
sperm or old fingernails lying around?"

536
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,352
How do you even get in touch with Jack?

537
00:42:30,521 --> 00:42:31,521
Yeah.

538
00:42:32,515 --> 00:42:36,471
He is a bloody mogul.
Can't just ring him up.

539
00:42:38,761 --> 00:42:42,852
I may have just figured out how
to win favour with new boss...

540
00:42:42,868 --> 00:42:46,106
and eliminate one father
from my enquiries.

541
00:42:46,137 --> 00:42:50,685
I have to say, Bridget,
I'm actually excited by this next guest.

542
00:42:50,746 --> 00:42:55,825
Relevant, relatable, extremely fuckable.
Good work.

543
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:59,377
Welcome to CSI Hard News.

544
00:43:08,688 --> 00:43:11,454
Thank you my love. If you could
just fuck off that'd be great.

545
00:43:17,613 --> 00:43:19,857
Jack, this is Cathy.
She'll get you ready.

546
00:43:19,976 --> 00:43:24,290
Hi, Cathy, nice to meet you.
- I was thinking, just a simple magenta eyeshadow...

547
00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:27,491
to make your eyes pop
and a little bit of rouge, maybe?

548
00:43:27,807 --> 00:43:31,141
Kidding.
- You funny.

549
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,193
You do happen to have
a little stray gray hair.

550
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:37,455
Oh, Jesus.
- That's it.

551
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:40,411
Actually, there's a whole gray patch.
Shall I just... let me see?

552
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:44,624
Yes, my hair is full of gray hair.
- Well, that's sorted.

553
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:48,739
Jesus Christ.
- All gone, that's lovely.

554
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:54,411
These fingernails on this silver fox could
do with a bit of a trim, couldn't they?

555
00:43:54,558 --> 00:43:58,134
These hands haven't experienced
much manual labour, have they?

556
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,574
No, I'm a mathematician.
- They're silky soft.

557
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:06,459
Tell me, Jack.
Do you happen to like Chinese food?

558
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:12,498
Jack, let me take you to the set. Great,
thank you. I do sometimes. Thank you.

559
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:16,154
I don't think she put any makeup on me.
- It's fine. You're looking radiant.

560
00:44:19,682 --> 00:44:22,833
Ok, coming out of ET in five, four...
And remember the gear change.

561
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,138
And Miranda, cue.
- Now, though, I'm joined by Jack Qwant.

562
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:32,307
Raised by a single mother in Baltimore, he
created the matchmaking website Qwantify...

563
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:35,711
and he claims to have found
an algorithm for love.

564
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:40,615
And he's here today to tell us all about
his number one bestseller Qwantum Leap'.

565
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,075
It is absolutely wonderful to have you on our sofa today.
- Thank you. It's great to be here.

566
00:44:47,197 --> 00:44:52,088
Now, we'll talk all about your new book soon, obviously.
- Yes. But first let's talk about romance.

567
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:54,515
Qwantify has found
true love for millions.

568
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:56,778
Monitor two.
- Does it work for you?

569
00:44:56,794 --> 00:44:59,639
Now if I answer that can we
go back and talk about the book?

570
00:44:59,649 --> 00:45:00,654
Maybe.

571
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:03,388
Can you please try not
to shag him on air?

572
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,726
This is dynamite.
Tell her to flirt with him more.

573
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:10,184
Some people had their first
crush on Farrah Fawcett.

574
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,782
My first crush was an algorithm.
- And we've lost him.

575
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:17,654
If he carries on talking about algorithms I'm
putting to the VT of cats who look like Hitler.

576
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:18,760
Back to four. Love it.

577
00:45:18,776 --> 00:45:21,588
He's avoiding the question.
Get him off maths.

578
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:23,765
Ask him if he's with someone now.

579
00:45:23,877 --> 00:45:27,824
For someone so good at match-making...

580
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:30,621
is there a special someone in your life?

581
00:45:30,629 --> 00:45:35,121
Apart from Lady Mary on 'Downton Abbey'?
Now can we go ahead and talk about the book?

582
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,190
Cue the Hitler cats.
- Don't be evasive.

583
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,590
Well, don't be evasive.

584
00:45:38,721 --> 00:45:43,287
It's apparant you have everything.
Why have you chosen to have no family?

585
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:46,018
Why the decision to have no family?
- No children.

586
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:48,098
And no children?

587
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,587
Brilliant. Zoom in on four.

588
00:45:50,606 --> 00:45:52,039
And in on four.
- Love it.

589
00:45:52,317 --> 00:45:54,142
Look, I love kids...

590
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:59,174
but I've always found the idea of being
a father myself kind of petrifying.

591
00:45:59,322 --> 00:46:03,142
Which is why I've been drawn to algorithms.
- Cue the Hitler cats.

592
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:08,940
They're rational, reliable,
predictable, everything a kid isn't.

593
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,014
So, can you have children?
- Can you have children, though?

594
00:46:12,142 --> 00:46:17,191
Are the soldiers working?
- Are the soldiers working?

595
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:25,798
Well I believe so.
The barracks are in pretty regular use.

596
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:27,868
Really? - Really?
- Yes.

597
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:30,950
Because for someone with a
supposed algorithm for love...

598
00:46:30,965 --> 00:46:33,283
Isn't it odd that you've never found it?

599
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:37,155
Well, I think in order to find something
you have to be actively looking for it.

600
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:39,474
I've just been too busy; I haven't...

601
00:46:39,498 --> 00:46:43,795
What about the Qwant family bloodline?
- And what about the Qwant family bloodline?

602
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:48,579
Are there any skeletons in the closet?
- Sexual deviants? - Sexual deviants?

603
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,454
Sorry, I don't know where
we're going with all of this...

604
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:55,818
but I have to tell you,
I can attract the wrong type of women.

605
00:46:56,695 --> 00:47:00,155
That's really great.
Thank you for sharing that with us.

606
00:47:02,512 --> 00:47:05,458
Bridget, what are you doing?

607
00:47:05,482 --> 00:47:08,221
You wouldn't believe some of the
weirdos that cross my path.

608
00:47:08,229 --> 00:47:10,048
Really?
- Get up.

609
00:47:10,064 --> 00:47:12,341
Can you tell me what she's doing?

610
00:47:12,364 --> 00:47:16,488
Ask him something about algorithms.
- Have to be the last question. Have to be.

611
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:21,120
Lastly, algorithms.
- Yes.

612
00:47:21,135 --> 00:47:24,263
What first attracted you to them?
- The logic and...

613
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:27,256
Wonderful, Jack Qwant,
thank you for coming on my sofa.

614
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:30,145
I hope you've had as much fun as I have.
- Jesus.

615
00:47:30,148 --> 00:47:32,402
That's it from me. Goodbye.

616
00:47:34,426 --> 00:47:38,755
That was great.
- You look really familier, outside of being on the show.

617
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:40,708
Are you on Tinder?
- What?

618
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,702
Then we won't have met.
- No, okay.

619
00:47:48,155 --> 00:47:51,259
Well hey, how about seeing you here.
- Hi.

620
00:47:51,298 --> 00:47:53,819
Great to see you.
- Good to see you too.

621
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:59,540
I was going to come and find you to say hello,
but you know how live TV can be, so chaotic.

622
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:03,889
Well, you know, there are easier ways to get in
touch with me without inviting me on national TV...

623
00:48:03,913 --> 00:48:08,272
and asking me about my sperm.
- What? No, that's not what...

624
00:48:08,422 --> 00:48:10,773
I would've liked to have heard from you.

625
00:48:11,342 --> 00:48:15,401
I was disappointed when I came
back that morning, and you were gone.

626
00:48:15,511 --> 00:48:18,447
You were?
- We had an amazing night.

627
00:48:19,692 --> 00:48:23,158
And I thought you were great.
At least I did until I became a clip...

628
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:26,636
of the 15 most embarrassing chat
show moments of all time.

629
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,417
Really sorry about that. Yes that...

630
00:48:32,104 --> 00:48:35,496
I don't know how to explain.

631
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:46,156
I'm pregnant.
- Wow. Okay.

632
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:50,985
It's so much better than you
being mentally unbalanced.

633
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:55,585
I'm about twelve weeks.

634
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:01,141
Oh. Right. Wow.

635
00:49:03,115 --> 00:49:06,482
So you mean that... it's the music festival?
- Yes.

636
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:12,965
I know, it's quite a surprise.
Yes but...

637
00:49:13,544 --> 00:49:17,415
I'm fine, and umm...
you should know that...

638
00:49:17,439 --> 00:49:21,622
I don't...
I'm not looking for anything from you.

639
00:49:21,649 --> 00:49:25,683
Except for a complete DNA check and a
review of my medical records.

640
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:31,620
Well, the thing is, I didn't mean
for you to find out about this.

641
00:49:31,634 --> 00:49:36,021
And, umm, I'm feeling a bit foolish.

642
00:49:36,052 --> 00:49:39,708
Mortified, actually. Yes, mortified.

643
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:45,515
I'd like to just retreat, gracefully?

644
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,322
Mr. Qwant, will you sign my book?

645
00:49:48,933 --> 00:49:53,943
Oh God. I didn't even tell him that he
may not be the only daddy.

646
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,584
Christina.
- I find this amazing book.

647
00:49:55,616 --> 00:49:58,319
Hey, Kitty Kirk, I need to talk to you.

648
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,450
What if this DNA turns out to be Jack's?
I don't want the father to be Jack.

649
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:08,371
I don't even know Jack.
And what if it's Mark Darcy's?

650
00:50:08,395 --> 00:50:12,510
Christ. I'll have to confess to him that
I've been a whore with dolphin condoms.

651
00:50:12,547 --> 00:50:13,547
Good.

652
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:16,052
So the baby's ok?
- Perfect.

653
00:50:17,376 --> 00:50:21,981
See?
- Oh my God. Is that it?

654
00:50:27,533 --> 00:50:31,821
And it's alright?
- Sound as a bell. Cooking Nicely.

655
00:50:32,496 --> 00:50:33,591
Have a listen.

656
00:50:40,137 --> 00:50:41,274
There you are.

657
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:45,230
I've recorded that for you.
You can watch that for a moment.

658
00:50:47,082 --> 00:50:50,039
So glad you decided
on the amniocentesis.

659
00:50:52,587 --> 00:50:54,087
Hello you.

660
00:50:55,738 --> 00:51:01,439
Is that your ear or your foot?
You have got very big feet.

661
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,422
Oh, look at you. Waving already.

662
00:51:13,176 --> 00:51:15,346
You're the best thing I've ever seen.

663
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:22,969
I promise I'll try my best.

664
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:28,370
So just stay safe and snug in there...

665
00:51:29,062 --> 00:51:33,229
while I try and sort the mess out here.
And hopefully...

666
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:39,444
What the fuck is that?
- It's the amniocentesis needle.

667
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:43,285
We just pop it in, take a little amniotic
fluid, test it for any abnormalities...

668
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,416
and also the DNA sample
that you require.

669
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:49,586
Now, there is the slightest risk of miscarriage
so you'll have to stay very still indeed...

670
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,167
because we don't want the needle to come into contact...
- What?

671
00:51:52,325 --> 00:51:55,566
No, no. I'm not taking that chance.

672
00:51:55,598 --> 00:51:59,093
It's enormous.
It'd go straight through the other side.

673
00:51:59,109 --> 00:52:01,931
Come on, I'm taking you home.

674
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:10,520
Your mother will be over the moon.
- Will you promise not to tell her?

675
00:52:10,825 --> 00:52:14,400
Just not yet.
- No, of course. I promise.

676
00:52:14,892 --> 00:52:19,219
I'm really sorry, dad,
not to know about the father.

677
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,587
Don't be daft.

678
00:52:21,607 --> 00:52:26,238
I know dozens of people who could have been anybodys.
- So you're not disappointed?

679
00:52:26,683 --> 00:52:31,584
You don't think I belong on Jerry Springer?
- Not a bit, I'm thrilled.

680
00:52:32,743 --> 00:52:37,841
Actually I'm not sure if you're mine or that nice
lieutenant colonel who's 'round the bowls club.

681
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:40,993
Only joking.

682
00:52:41,382 --> 00:52:44,901
You've got my feet.
I've always had very dainty feet.

683
00:52:47,614 --> 00:52:52,562
Just tell the truth, Bridget. You can't
go too far wrong, telling the truth.

684
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:09,838
Mark, I have some exciting news. Mark,
I have the funniest story to tell you.

685
00:53:09,975 --> 00:53:12,592
Mark, I'm up the duff.

686
00:53:12,616 --> 00:53:14,461
My lords, my ladies.

687
00:53:14,803 --> 00:53:18,140
There is only one fraud committed
here today and it is this.

688
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,921
To use the laws of one country to
destroy the freedom of speech of another.

689
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:27,504
A cynical political expedient to take away
the right of these brave young women...

690
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,673
to speak the truth about
the country they love.

691
00:53:31,481 --> 00:53:37,398
Now you may not like their
music and for that I cannot blame you.

692
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:43,428
They may not have mastered the fundamentals of melody...
or even the most basic tenents of musicianship.

693
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:48,048
But this is the land of Shakespeare,
Orwell, Lawrence ...

694
00:53:48,086 --> 00:53:51,893
I'd forgotten just how hot
he is in that wig and gown.

695
00:53:51,902 --> 00:53:56,888
...to any country, any ruler, any despot,
that here in the United Kingdom...

696
00:53:56,896 --> 00:54:01,960
we will always defend and protect women such as
these who have selflessly and courageously...

697
00:54:01,976 --> 00:54:04,908
risked their liberty and
quite possibly their lives...

698
00:54:06,906 --> 00:54:08,120
to tell the truth.

699
00:54:08,588 --> 00:54:11,891
The court will now adjourn
and judgement will be given...

700
00:54:11,899 --> 00:54:16,040
Poonani! Poonani! Power to the Poonani! Power to the Poonani!
- Christ.

701
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:19,440
Looking forward to going back
to some good old fashioned genocide.

702
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,650
Order.

703
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,527
Right. How to do this?

704
00:54:30,551 --> 00:54:33,471
I didn't expect to see you again
after the events at the christening.

705
00:54:33,487 --> 00:54:34,990
Crap. He's dived right in.

706
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:39,706
No, right. I understand.
Maybe flattery will work.

707
00:54:39,714 --> 00:54:42,326
You were very impressive in there today.
- Thank you.

708
00:54:43,373 --> 00:54:46,846
Although dealing with them over the last month
has given me a certain amount of sympathy...

709
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,975
for the totalitarian dictator who
wants to silence them.

710
00:54:50,848 --> 00:54:54,397
Okay, jokes.
I'll laugh harder next time.

711
00:54:54,461 --> 00:54:57,267
There's only a certain number of
times that one can listen to the...

712
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:01,527
resolutely un-catchy "Menstruation,
Castration, Liberation."

713
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:07,308
Mark, that's hilariously funny.

714
00:55:13,464 --> 00:55:14,464
Please.

715
00:55:23,845 --> 00:55:28,009
So.
- So, Mark.

716
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:29,040
Yes.

717
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:35,785
The gardens look lovely. Autumnal.
- Yes.

718
00:55:35,896 --> 00:55:38,825
Is that a conker tree?
- Bridget.

719
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:48,417
I am pregnant.

720
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,063
Right. Well, congratulations.

721
00:55:56,575 --> 00:55:57,646
How can I help?

722
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,211
I'm three months pregnant.

723
00:56:03,411 --> 00:56:04,411
Oh.

724
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:07,868
You mean the christening?

725
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:10,911
Yes.

726
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:16,373
Would you excuse me for just a moment.

727
00:56:39,472 --> 00:56:41,983
I think that this is quite
possibly the most wonderful

728
00:56:42,083 --> 00:56:44,583
piece of information I have
ever received in my entire life.

729
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:47,083
Oh!

730
00:56:48,283 --> 00:56:49,283
Ok.

731
00:56:50,232 --> 00:56:54,895
Of course I've got no expectations about how things
should work out. I just thought you should know.

732
00:56:55,288 --> 00:56:56,416
No, of course.

733
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:03,423
I mean, how do you feel? Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.

734
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:07,891
So much has happened in the past
ten years. A lot has changed.

735
00:57:07,899 --> 00:57:11,311
I mean, you've been married,
and I've been...

736
00:57:11,437 --> 00:57:15,450
on a number of long haul holidays.

737
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,880
But... So here goes on Jack.

738
00:57:17,904 --> 00:57:19,868
I mean...
- I know about it.

739
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:24,413
It's just right now I can't bring
myself to feel gloomy about it.

740
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,571
God, how can I tell him now.

741
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:50,122
State of emergency. Cannot sleep. Looping
thoughts going round and round in head.

742
00:57:50,138 --> 00:57:53,635
It's surely weird that tou can do
something as complicated and important...

743
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:56,991
as growing a baby or invading
Iraq without any instruction at all.

744
00:57:57,146 --> 00:57:59,603
I keep thinking all the alcohol
I've drunk over the years...

745
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,689
will give the baby
fetal alcohol syndrome.

746
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:03,384
These are the things I could do.

747
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,053
Tell Mark about Jack...

748
00:58:05,073 --> 00:58:07,847
but risk hurting him so badly
I couldn't live with myself.

749
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,645
Not tell Mark about Jack, but I'd
never be able to go through with it.

750
00:58:11,653 --> 00:58:16,493
Tell both of them the other one is the father and then
if the one who isn't the father is upset about it...

751
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:22,201
Oh Christ.
Tell no-one and make a run for it.

752
00:58:23,355 --> 00:58:26,559
Hello?
- Hey, it's the father of your child.

753
00:58:27,485 --> 00:58:29,918
Jack?
- Yeah, who else?

754
00:58:31,009 --> 00:58:32,096
Come up. Ok.

755
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:42,824
Oh fuckfuckfuck. He's probably employed a
team of Google Earth detectives to find me.

756
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:46,018
Okay, just act naturally.

757
00:58:51,118 --> 00:58:52,118
Hi.

758
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:53,318
Hi.

759
00:58:53,788 --> 00:58:55,939
Come in.
- Okay.

760
00:59:00,228 --> 00:59:03,524
You found it.
- Try it on, see if it fits.

761
00:59:06,495 --> 00:59:07,500
Wow.

762
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,933
I didn't expect to see you.
- I wasn't expecting to come.

763
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:17,958
I'm not used to being rejected. Twice.

764
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,957
I hope you've got cake in that bag.

765
00:59:29,486 --> 00:59:31,383
Yeah, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

766
00:59:33,271 --> 00:59:39,227
Bridget, the whole baby situation threw me initially.
We've squashed an entire relationship into one night...

767
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:42,412
and skipped straight
to starting a family phase.

768
00:59:42,773 --> 00:59:45,715
We never even had a real second date.

769
00:59:47,645 --> 00:59:52,524
Just so you know if we did,
I would have taken you to Ottolenghi.

770
00:59:52,651 --> 00:59:56,797
You would have had the grilled
salmon and pine nuts salsa.

771
00:59:56,932 --> 01:00:02,482
Unbelievable and healthy.
And we would have come back here...

772
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:05,204
have incredible sex...

773
01:00:05,228 --> 01:00:09,929
spent the next couple of days
sending each other filthy texts.

774
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:24,513
I would not have let you
do that on a second date.

775
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:27,050
Why not. You let me on the first.

776
01:00:27,066 --> 01:00:31,229
And then we'd go on a
naughty weekend to the seaside...

777
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:35,644
and I would prove my manliness by
winning you a cuddly toy...

778
01:00:36,617 --> 01:00:37,633
at the pier.

779
01:00:37,855 --> 01:00:41,142
I really wanted the giant Scooby-Doo.
- Oh, no-body wins that.

780
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:42,714
The coconuts are glued on.

781
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:54,870
What are those for?
- To apologise.

782
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:56,840
We had our first fight.

783
01:00:57,612 --> 01:01:02,475
I was not flirting with that waitress.
She means nothing to me.

784
01:01:07,635 --> 01:01:11,450
And then I would have...

785
01:01:11,728 --> 01:01:15,751
bought Swedish furniture for us to make.

786
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:21,650
If we can get through this, we can get through anything.
- Anything.

787
01:01:22,954 --> 01:01:26,561
I find it adorable how your neck gets
all blotchy when you get nervous.

788
01:01:26,767 --> 01:01:30,047
And I know you'd be the greatest
possible mother to my child.

789
01:02:03,313 --> 01:02:07,382
Oh no, can not fall in love
with shiny new American.

790
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,298
I'll tell them both tomorrow,
definitely.

791
01:02:12,247 --> 01:02:17,268
Hi. I just wanted to connect, check how
the presentation is shaping up.

792
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:20,878
Yeah, totally on top of it,
Neutra Bulleting the shit out of it.

793
01:02:20,893 --> 01:02:24,378
I'm relying on you, Bridget. I need
you to get this right. Understand?

794
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:28,513
100 percent. You can count on me.
- Great.

795
01:02:33,738 --> 01:02:37,565
You alright?
- I'm fine.

796
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:42,136
Big party.
I'm so glad to see you back together.

797
01:02:42,151 --> 01:02:44,774
It certainly is Gianni.
- Wonderful news, huh?

798
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:45,799
Cheers.

799
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:51,455
I was thinking about Jack.
If it's a boy, after my grandfather.

800
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:54,959
It's a good strong name.
You can rely on Jack.

801
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,285
Yes, one for the list.

802
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:59,189
To Jack.
- To Jack.

803
01:03:01,634 --> 01:03:03,246
So this is dad, I presume.

804
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:06,957
So glad you're here.
It's a unique and wonderful moment.

805
01:03:06,973 --> 01:03:11,556
Dr. Rawlings, I wonder if you
could maybe do me a little favor.

806
01:03:13,575 --> 01:03:17,389
So this is dad, I presume.
Pleased to meet you.

807
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:23,720
I'm so glad you could be here.
This is a unique and wonderful moment.

808
01:03:23,736 --> 01:03:27,767
Before we start, would you like to know the sex?
- We should be prepared.

809
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:29,699
I'm not sure...
- It's a boy.

810
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,293
A boy.
- Our boy.

811
01:03:35,298 --> 01:03:36,870
My boy.

812
01:03:39,143 --> 01:03:43,954
Okay, right. This time I have to
tell them. We'll start with Jack.

813
01:03:43,970 --> 01:03:48,800
Have invited him for big scary work
presentation and will explain all afterwards.

814
01:03:51,399 --> 01:03:52,401
Welcome.

815
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:58,623
In a digital age where every cell phone
is a camera, we are all broadcasters.

816
01:03:58,631 --> 01:04:01,630
"Hard News" is partnering
with the London Media Show...

817
01:04:01,653 --> 01:04:07,977
so you can use your smartphone to create
your own news broadcasting channel.

818
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:13,492
Simply download the new 'Hard News' app
and broadcast directly to our studios in...

819
01:04:13,508 --> 01:04:18,461
where Miranda is waiting for
our first ever live simulcast.

820
01:04:18,469 --> 01:04:22,998
Hello everyone,
live at the London MediaShow.

821
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:28,127
And welcome to the new look of
'Hard News' studio.

822
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:33,453
We are live and yes,
our viewers are broadcasting.

823
01:04:33,754 --> 01:04:37,017
Right. Let's now go to the Grampians...

824
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:42,977
where Adam Wollaston is leading a team of
Venture Rangers to the top of Ben Nevis.

825
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:48,728
Hello, Adam Wollaston.
- 'Hard News' sucks balls.

826
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,637
Jesus.
- Oh dear.

827
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:57,058
Well, let's put that news
story firmly behind us.

828
01:05:05,391 --> 01:05:06,938
Technical glitch.

829
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:15,189
Of course it's never been easier
to email or text the show.

830
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:20,961
Just search "Hard News" or simply H.

831
01:05:21,034 --> 01:05:22,305
Because...

832
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:25,505
Be... cause...

833
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:28,373
Holy fuck. What's he doing here?

834
01:05:28,389 --> 01:05:32,951
Because at 'Hard News', we believe...

835
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:38,785
We believe that we are ready
and on the front line...

836
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:43,016
asking the questions
the world wants answers to.

837
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:50,800
Turn around.

838
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:06,489
Thank you. Okay. Career down the toilet.

839
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:11,160
Both men in the same room.
What could possibly go wrong?

840
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:17,766
I hope you don't mind me just
showing up and surprising you.

841
01:06:17,939 --> 01:06:20,831
No.
- Well done. It was very...

842
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:25,086
Yes.
- Technically adroit.

843
01:06:25,689 --> 01:06:29,952
Mark, I would love for you to meet...

844
01:06:37,556 --> 01:06:42,076
Ariyaratna Sithamparanathan.

845
01:06:42,096 --> 01:06:48,203
Ariyaratna's is the area manager
for DTC Technological Solutions.

846
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:51,066
Aren't you, Ari Sinatra?

847
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:56,184
Hi.
- Hello.

848
01:06:56,584 --> 01:06:57,584
Hey.

849
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:02,856
What the hell was that?
What'ere you thinking?

850
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:06,334
I've got four voicemails from David
Cartwright that I dare not listen to.

851
01:07:06,358 --> 01:07:09,112
I'll be right back.
- You call that a presentation?

852
01:07:09,131 --> 01:07:11,992
I don't know whether I've the right
people around me because you're not...

853
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,522
Alice, I'm so sorry.
Yeah well sorry isn't good enough.

854
01:07:14,538 --> 01:07:19,463
Excuse me. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Excuse me.
- I'm so sorry, but I really...

855
01:07:20,896 --> 01:07:21,896
What?

856
01:07:22,989 --> 01:07:25,851
Bridget, I'd like you to meet Jack
Qwant. He's rather extraordinary.

857
01:07:25,866 --> 01:07:29,409
I was just reading a profile of him in The New Yorker.
- Right, yes.

858
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:32,075
We actually know each other.
Yes, we certainly do.

859
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:34,300
Good job. Why didn't you
introduce me to this man before?

860
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:37,673
He's brilliant. You know, he represents
the punk rock band that's being extradited.

861
01:07:37,689 --> 01:07:40,311
That's right.
- Yes. Yes. I knew that too.

862
01:07:40,335 --> 01:07:43,733
Hi, we've met fleetingly before as well.

863
01:07:43,756 --> 01:07:46,445
I'm in charge of data management
for most of Daventry.

864
01:07:47,345 --> 01:07:49,245
Oh. Well, umm...

865
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:54,701
I must say it's fantastic that you're getting
on so well because you have a lot in common.

866
01:07:54,885 --> 01:08:00,879
Shall we get out of here, and find a place a bit quieter?
- Yes, why not. I booked Gianni's.

867
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,275
Great.
- That sounds lovely.

868
01:08:05,095 --> 01:08:10,245
You might have to sit this one out,
Arinuth. I'm sorry.

869
01:08:16,288 --> 01:08:20,598
So do you actually believe that mathematics
can... how did you put it in your book?

870
01:08:20,612 --> 01:08:23,743
Help us analyze behavior
previously invisible to science?

871
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,624
Well, my dating algorithm is to help people
find love, not necessarily replace it.

872
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:33,408
Oh no, is incredible idea.
- Have you ever tried it out?

873
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:40,378
You're single, right?
- Well, I'm... Yes, I suppose so.

874
01:08:41,434 --> 01:08:43,503
How did you two meet?

875
01:08:47,987 --> 01:08:51,157
Yeah.
- It's umm...

876
01:08:52,566 --> 01:08:56,264
It's sort of a funny story. Sort of.

877
01:08:58,642 --> 01:08:59,642
You see, umm...

878
01:08:59,842 --> 01:09:05,253
a few months ago, on the fourth of the
month, I met Jack at a music festival.

879
01:09:05,274 --> 01:09:06,274
Right.

880
01:09:06,293 --> 01:09:12,468
And we got on very well
and sort of had... relations.

881
01:09:12,493 --> 01:09:18,921
And the next week, that is to say, on the eleventh of
the month at Jude's baby christening to be exact...

882
01:09:18,945 --> 01:09:24,884
following the consumption of a large amount of
alcohol, Mark and I, well, we had similar relations.

883
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:31,511
And, um, this is the funny part,
I suppose. Owing to these relations...

884
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:37,295
the resulting life form currently residing in my
tummy, could actually, in fact, be either of yours.

885
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:52,975
I know I should have told you both
before but... I just didn't.

886
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:57,055
You both seemed so happy.

887
01:09:57,378 --> 01:10:01,273
So correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just
say that the baby could be either of us?

888
01:10:04,733 --> 01:10:08,926
So you have no idea which
of us is actually the father?

889
01:10:12,518 --> 01:10:17,611
I know, it's all very confusing.
I'm sorry.

890
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:19,311
I'm sorry.

891
01:10:20,057 --> 01:10:25,265
So however we choose to do this...

892
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:31,519
the most important thing now is this.

893
01:10:35,268 --> 01:10:37,848
Bridget, I'm not going to
pretend this isn't a shock.

894
01:10:39,267 --> 01:10:43,275
I want you to know whatever
the circumstance...

895
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:46,612
The most important thing is the baby.

896
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:50,376
Who knows,
this could be a great adventure.

897
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:54,301
I'm afraid you're going to have
to excuse me. I have a meeting.

898
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,774
Good night
- Mark...

899
01:11:08,964 --> 01:11:11,936
Gianni, can we have the bill please?
- Subito.

900
01:11:20,582 --> 01:11:22,500
And if I thought that was tricky...

901
01:11:22,523 --> 01:11:26,515
how would the news go down at mum's
parish council election campaign?

902
01:11:26,681 --> 01:11:29,824
Honestly, we started half an hour ago.
Where have you been?

903
01:11:29,848 --> 01:11:33,752
You said it was an emergency. Well, The
Gazette wants to take a family portrait.

904
01:11:33,776 --> 01:11:34,857
What are you wearing?

905
01:11:36,536 --> 01:11:39,117
Oh my God. Bridget, you're...
- Yes.

906
01:11:41,713 --> 01:11:46,582
Why didn't you say anything?
- I didn't want to upset you.

907
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:51,478
Why would you?
Oh no, Bridget. Who's the father?

908
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:56,376
It's not Mark is it? Oh, do say it is.
- There's at least a 50 percent chance.

909
01:11:56,392 --> 01:12:00,351
A 50 percent chance?
- Mark and this really nice American called Jack.

910
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:04,653
Oh no, Bridget. An American?
Did you have a three-way?

911
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:06,521
Mrs Jones.

912
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:13,099
Here, take this and pretend everything is fine.
- Everything is fine.

913
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:18,124
Ms. Jones, can we...
Here's a lovely place for you to stand.

914
01:12:21,259 --> 01:12:25,425
Are you ashamed of me?
- No darling. It's just the circumstances.

915
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:27,895
I'm running for high office. See?

916
01:12:28,796 --> 01:12:32,475
If you love family and you
love values... it's so long.

917
01:12:32,861 --> 01:12:35,637
It's not the 1950's.

918
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:40,778
Look around you.
Two lesbians just adopted at number 32.

919
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:45,570
If you don't change the way you look at things,
you're going to lose your precious election...

920
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:47,727
and perhaps your daughter.

921
01:12:50,171 --> 01:12:52,907
Bridget, so lovely to see you.

922
01:12:53,089 --> 01:12:55,395
Are you...?
- Yes, I am.

923
01:12:55,519 --> 01:12:59,926
How wonderful.
We thought you'd just got all fat again.

924
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:08,357
I'm now the Mary Magdalene of middle
England. Have alienated Mom and Mark Darcy.

925
01:13:08,359 --> 01:13:12,641
Am like tropical female insect that shags
men to impregnate self and eats them.

926
01:13:12,687 --> 01:13:17,519
The question is: will Mark even turn up
and engage in a polyamorous family?

927
01:13:26,137 --> 01:13:27,637
Hey. Hello.

928
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:30,220
First pre-natal class.

929
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:33,211
Exciting, huh?
- Yeah.

930
01:13:35,059 --> 01:13:36,811
You look great.

931
01:13:43,395 --> 01:13:45,131
Hello.

932
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:49,417
I'm so glad you came.
- Yeah, me too.

933
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:52,976
I brought you a nice tea.
- Oh, wow. Thank you.

934
01:13:55,151 --> 01:13:59,893
It's off 'till this evening. But there's
a heck of a lot of caffeine in that tea.

935
01:13:59,903 --> 01:14:03,626
I brought you a... super juice.

936
01:14:04,735 --> 01:14:09,394
Thank you. Shall we go in?

937
01:14:09,396 --> 01:14:11,785
Why not?
- Sure. Let me carry that for you.

938
01:14:11,787 --> 01:14:14,977
Thank you.
- Can I carry your phone, please?

939
01:14:16,177 --> 01:14:17,177
Okay.

940
01:14:19,111 --> 01:14:20,359
Thank you.

941
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:23,319
And who do we have here, then?

942
01:14:23,443 --> 01:14:28,067
I'm Bridget and this is Jack ...

943
01:14:28,195 --> 01:14:31,570
and this is Mark.

944
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:38,713
Oh. Lovely.
You're our second same sex couple today.

945
01:14:41,487 --> 01:14:44,671
No, actually we're ...
- Absolutely.

946
01:14:44,673 --> 01:14:48,481
We just need the gift of a baby
to make us feel complete.

947
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:52,123
You must be the surrogate?
- Exactly, yes.

948
01:14:52,125 --> 01:14:55,403
Just helping this wonderful couple
make their dream come true.

949
01:14:55,405 --> 01:14:59,968
Mark is very nervous about all this.
All new to you, isn't it, lamb chop?

950
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:06,067
Like all visionaries,
we encounter bumps along the road.

951
01:15:06,195 --> 01:15:10,494
How would you like to give birth to your placenta?
- Quickly.

952
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:37,038
Are you okay? Are you sure?

953
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:41,614
And of course massage can have
many benefits throughout pregnancy.

954
01:15:41,616 --> 01:15:45,679
Can we name some of them?
- It relieves stress and promotes feel good hormones.

955
01:15:45,681 --> 01:15:48,228
And is also to be avoided in
cases of high risk pregnancy...

956
01:15:48,248 --> 01:15:50,383
For example,
when there is a geriatric mother.

957
01:15:50,403 --> 01:15:53,614
Right, excellent,
someone's been reading up.

958
01:15:53,616 --> 01:15:56,950
Would you like to have a go?
- No, I think I'll let Jack get on with it....

959
01:15:56,952 --> 01:15:59,635
I think he seems to have it covered.
- That's very sweet of you.

960
01:15:59,637 --> 01:16:01,853
That's why I love you, my little teacup.

961
01:16:04,195 --> 01:16:07,567
What if we ask the right questions
and apply the laws of mathematics...

962
01:16:07,695 --> 01:16:10,695
so that the science of courtship
could be quantified?

963
01:17:07,027 --> 01:17:10,351
May I please make an application
to lead to an appeal...

964
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:14,680
in the case of Her Majesty's
Government and Saddiq Al Bashir.

965
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:18,344
As Your Lordship is aware,
Mr. Al Bashir has lost.

966
01:17:18,364 --> 01:17:22,600
So everything's alright?
- Yes, well, it's this combination...

967
01:17:22,602 --> 01:17:26,943
gherkins, anchovies,
banana juice and Pringles.

968
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:30,629
So essentially...
- It's wind.

969
01:17:32,434 --> 01:17:38,611
Right, so, going forward regular
Pringles, not hot, spicy barbecue?

970
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:41,832
Or possibly no Pringles at all.
Try that.

971
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:48,739
Is everything alright? Is Bridget okay?
- Yes, perfectly fine.

972
01:17:49,303 --> 01:17:54,803
She's in there with... That's Dr. Pringle.
He's testing her blood. This is interesting.

973
01:17:54,805 --> 01:17:58,657
This is a new bedside technique we're
testing out of Oslo. It's Norwegian.

974
01:17:58,659 --> 01:18:02,437
It's alright. I know about Jack. Thank you doctor.
- Oh, thank God. Why didn't you tell me?

975
01:18:02,555 --> 01:18:05,347
She's fine. He's calmed her
down completely, actually.

976
01:18:05,763 --> 01:18:08,903
I'm sorry, I got your messages.
I was in court.

977
01:18:12,179 --> 01:18:15,658
Hi. It's alright. Can't be helped.

978
01:18:19,511 --> 01:18:22,595
You should get it. It might be work.

979
01:18:25,555 --> 01:18:29,055
Don't worry. I got it covered.
- Yes, I can see that.

980
01:18:30,055 --> 01:18:34,977
Wow. Okay, you need to chill out.
We have to do this together.

981
01:18:35,055 --> 01:18:40,160
You know, in Peru the Um Bat Do, consider paternity
attach shared responsibility among the many tribesmen.

982
01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:43,311
Unfortunately, we Um Bat don't
live in Peru. I live in Ealing.

983
01:18:44,971 --> 01:18:48,152
Negative energy is just
so bad for the baby.

984
01:18:50,427 --> 01:18:54,978
Stop it. Both of you.
This isn't a competition.

985
01:18:57,347 --> 01:19:02,126
She's right. We should take this
toxic energy out of the room.

986
01:19:10,635 --> 01:19:12,055
I won't be a minute.

987
01:19:24,347 --> 01:19:29,668
What's up? Come on, buddy.
Why are you so angry?

988
01:19:30,887 --> 01:19:32,887
You know what?
I'm really not your buddy.

989
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:36,515
I don't know about vibes or negative
energy or prenatal wind...

990
01:19:36,517 --> 01:19:38,200
and even less about algorithms...

991
01:19:38,202 --> 01:19:41,549
so I will confess that the laws
of attraction are somewhat beyond me.

992
01:19:41,887 --> 01:19:44,471
In fact,
Bridget defies comprehension generally.

993
01:19:44,595 --> 01:19:47,679
But despite, or perhaps owing to the
bewildering litany of catastrophes

994
01:19:47,803 --> 01:19:51,067
I've witnessed over the last 40 years, I
feel I've come to know Bridget rather well...

995
01:19:51,069 --> 01:19:53,090
and I've spent those years
caring for her very deeply.

996
01:19:53,092 --> 01:19:56,309
And that may defy automated reasoning,
but there's nothing I can do about it.

997
01:19:56,329 --> 01:19:57,503
Nothing you can do about it?

998
01:19:57,505 --> 01:20:00,787
Maybe you should try and stay around a little,
instead of saving the world by cellphone.

999
01:20:00,807 --> 01:20:02,118
I make her happy, Mark.

1000
01:20:02,138 --> 01:20:05,302
And I suppose your algorithm tells you
you're destined to be together, does it.

1001
01:20:05,322 --> 01:20:07,883
Actually it does.
The fact that you've been trying

1002
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:10,383
and failing for the past ten
years tells me you are not.

1003
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:13,011
No...
- I don't want to fight with you.

1004
01:20:16,303 --> 01:20:18,141
We should think about
Bridget and the baby.

1005
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:20,839
For better or worse,
fate has brought us together.

1006
01:20:20,841 --> 01:20:24,347
It wasn't fate, it was condoms.
- What do you mean?

1007
01:20:24,471 --> 01:20:27,719
Those ridiculous dolphin friendly things
from the bottom of Bridget's bag.

1008
01:20:28,847 --> 01:20:32,587
I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking
about. When Bridget and I got it on, I was...

1009
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:35,424
I was not dressed for the occasion.

1010
01:21:18,387 --> 01:21:20,347
No Mark today?
- No.

1011
01:21:26,135 --> 01:21:29,702
We must thank one person who
was prepared to fight for us...

1012
01:21:29,704 --> 01:21:32,613
when no one else would,
and we say to that person...

1013
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,347
with all our hearts...

1014
01:21:39,055 --> 01:21:41,179
"Freedom!"

1015
01:21:44,055 --> 01:21:46,427
Bridget, we're back.

1016
01:21:47,971 --> 01:21:51,595
I still can't believe Mark
ducked out like that.

1017
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:53,635
Well, it's not really his fault.

1018
01:21:53,763 --> 01:21:59,053
I suppose we just have
to hope it's Jack's, right?

1019
01:21:59,511 --> 01:22:04,580
I mean, let's face it, things could
be worse. He's pretty fucking amazing.

1020
01:22:04,582 --> 01:22:07,971
He's richer than God and he
has a very nice sized puppet.

1021
01:22:08,095 --> 01:22:12,847
He does,
and we match up very nicely on paper.

1022
01:22:13,635 --> 01:22:17,213
Well, how do you know?
- You just have to have faith.

1023
01:22:17,215 --> 01:22:22,385
You just have to ask yourself:
can I see myself growing old...

1024
01:22:22,387 --> 01:22:26,326
with this guy, and not Mark Darcy?

1025
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:31,918
There it is. Here we go.

1026
01:22:39,018 --> 01:22:40,018
Oh, hey!

1027
01:22:41,471 --> 01:22:44,511
You know, first few months,
they only see black and white.

1028
01:22:44,635 --> 01:22:47,387
This will help stimulate
spatial awareness.

1029
01:22:47,511 --> 01:22:49,471
Or early onset motion sickness.

1030
01:22:51,095 --> 01:22:54,637
I got him one of these. A bouncy chair.

1031
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:59,135
Not quite sure where
we're going to put it.

1032
01:23:00,679 --> 01:23:06,314
About that... It's kind of
cramped in here, don't you think?

1033
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,528
It's cosy.

1034
01:23:12,437 --> 01:23:18,085
You know, I've been thinking.
Might be nice if we moved in together.

1035
01:23:18,263 --> 01:23:20,607
You think we're ready for that?

1036
01:23:20,609 --> 01:23:25,060
I'm just tired of living in
hotel rooms and airport lounges.

1037
01:23:25,595 --> 01:23:30,496
We could be a family. Me, you and him.

1038
01:23:31,595 --> 01:23:33,321
What do you say?

1039
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:41,635
What if it's not yours?
- What?

1040
01:23:41,763 --> 01:23:44,219
What if the baby turns out to be Mark's?

1041
01:23:49,635 --> 01:23:52,316
Well, I mean,
it'd certainly change things.

1042
01:23:57,179 --> 01:23:59,941
Is that what you want?
For it to be Mark's?

1043
01:24:05,803 --> 01:24:07,511
Are you in love with him?

1044
01:24:10,971 --> 01:24:15,276
I have been in the past.

1045
01:24:16,887 --> 01:24:18,303
And me?

1046
01:24:20,555 --> 01:24:23,954
I could be, one day.

1047
01:24:32,179 --> 01:24:36,268
Bridget,
I haven't been totally honest with you.

1048
01:24:37,303 --> 01:24:41,114
Mark thinks the baby isn't his,
and I let him believe it was mine.

1049
01:24:41,719 --> 01:24:44,011
That's why he disappeared.

1050
01:24:47,887 --> 01:24:50,635
Why would he think that?
- Because I let him.

1051
01:24:50,763 --> 01:24:52,803
Because I wanted you for myself.

1052
01:24:56,303 --> 01:24:58,427
We could be so good for each other.

1053
01:25:00,635 --> 01:25:06,735
97 percent.
- On paper.

1054
01:25:07,427 --> 01:25:10,233
But falling in love
doesn't happen on paper.

1055
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:16,778
Sometimes you love a person because
of all the reasons they're not like you.

1056
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:23,803
And sometimes you love a person
just because they feel like home.

1057
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:29,927
I've got to find Mark.

1058
01:25:36,471 --> 01:25:41,531
Hello, Pierce. It's Bridget.
I'm trying to get hold of Mark.

1059
01:25:41,533 --> 01:25:45,095
He just got back from a trip, Bridget.
He's in a taxi on his way home.

1060
01:26:19,511 --> 01:26:21,183
Hi.

1061
01:27:04,887 --> 01:27:08,302
Approximately eight weeks to go.

1062
01:27:13,803 --> 01:27:16,478
You don't really need them, you know.

1063
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,645
All they're good for is fitting
car seats, and blaming things on,

1064
01:27:18,645 --> 01:27:20,445
they really just get
in the way after that.

1065
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:25,374
You're absolutely capable of
doing this on your own.

1066
01:27:26,303 --> 01:27:28,133
I did.

1067
01:27:47,035 --> 01:27:52,862
You know what? I can do this on my own.
We can do this on our own.

1068
01:27:53,247 --> 01:27:57,619
One of the perks of being pregnant is I no
longer feel like a tragic lonely spinster.

1069
01:27:57,747 --> 01:28:00,455
Because of a miniature
miracle growing inside.

1070
01:28:00,579 --> 01:28:03,307
Hello. Hello!

1071
01:28:05,371 --> 01:28:08,663
Mum's throwing a
Christmas party / political rally.

1072
01:28:08,787 --> 01:28:13,902
It's like the G8 summit with
Scotch eggs. Be brave. Go in.

1073
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:16,579
Hello darling.
- Hello.

1074
01:28:16,703 --> 01:28:20,411
Sorry, I didn't realise everyone
was here. I'll just pop upstairs.

1075
01:28:20,535 --> 01:28:26,742
No, nonsense. Nonsense.
Una's had all the posters reprinted.

1076
01:28:28,665 --> 01:28:30,980
You've inspired me.
- Still so long.

1077
01:28:30,982 --> 01:28:33,504
You were quite right, as it turns out.

1078
01:28:33,506 --> 01:28:37,871
This place is teeming with single mothers,
single fathers, bisexuals, surrogates.

1079
01:28:37,995 --> 01:28:40,079
And they're all lovely and so normal.

1080
01:28:40,203 --> 01:28:44,065
Do you know, I've even got two homosexuals on the team.
- No, thank you.

1081
01:28:44,067 --> 01:28:46,079
Who knew?
- Everybody.

1082
01:28:47,703 --> 01:28:49,871
I'm so proud of you, darling.
You know that?

1083
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:53,823
What you're doing is not easy, but
if anyone can make it work, it's you.

1084
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:58,421
That child is the luckiest boy on
earth to have you as his mother.

1085
01:28:58,747 --> 01:29:02,516
And he's going to have the love of
a million fathers with you by his side.

1086
01:29:03,911 --> 01:29:06,823
Come on.
We've got some campaigning to do.

1087
01:29:06,825 --> 01:29:10,418
Make way. Make way.
Single pregnant mother coming through.

1088
01:29:12,163 --> 01:29:17,874
Laura, Josh. We need to give six
minutes to General Lu Tong, ok.

1089
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:22,065
It's a huge scoop.
- Yeah, Alice wants to pull the interview.

1090
01:29:22,067 --> 01:29:25,287
She's got a feature on
"Is The World Really Ending On Tuesday?"

1091
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:28,995
Well it may as well if we lose Lu Tong.
Lu Tong stays.

1092
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:31,247
Six minutes. Let's do this.

1093
01:29:32,663 --> 01:29:37,481
General Lu Tong, hi.
Sorry it's so chaotic in here today.

1094
01:29:37,911 --> 01:29:41,287
Thank you for coming on.
We're on, live, in two minutes.

1095
01:29:41,411 --> 01:29:46,035
Miranda will probably want to start with
what's going on in Naypyidaw.

1096
01:29:46,163 --> 01:29:48,900
Go three.
- Miranda, back to General Lu Tong.

1097
01:29:48,902 --> 01:29:52,938
Keep pressing.
- So let me ask you one more time, General Lu Tong...

1098
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,911
will you take responsibility for the
human rights abuses...

1099
01:29:56,035 --> 01:29:57,871
perpetrated by your own government?

1100
01:29:57,873 --> 01:30:01,405
He's on the rack. Tight on 4.
Get those beads of sweat.

1101
01:30:01,407 --> 01:30:04,703
In you go, 4. Push it.
- I'm sorry, I can't answer that.

1102
01:30:04,827 --> 01:30:07,280
Can't, or won't, Lu Tong?

1103
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:09,680
- Can't, or won't, General Lu Tong?

1104
01:30:09,682 --> 01:30:12,527
On balance, I'd suggest "can't",
considering

1105
01:30:12,527 --> 01:30:15,327
I've just found General
Lu Tong in the lobby,

1106
01:30:15,329 --> 01:30:18,002
and his chauffeur is currently
live on air answering

1107
01:30:18,002 --> 01:30:20,602
questions about Far Eastern geopolitics.

1108
01:30:20,604 --> 01:30:24,295
No? Any comments you want to make
about the use of sexual torture...

1109
01:30:24,297 --> 01:30:25,654
by your own military?

1110
01:30:26,747 --> 01:30:31,190
Ask him about London traffic.
- London traffic, General Lu Tong,

1111
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:35,209
anything to say about that?
No comment there. Unbelievable.

1112
01:30:35,495 --> 01:30:39,492
That's it from General Lu Tong.
We'll see you after this short break.

1113
01:30:39,494 --> 01:30:40,885
Good job.

1114
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:46,411
Unfortunately, you leave me no choice.

1115
01:30:46,535 --> 01:30:50,081
It is actually illegal to fire
somebody for being pregnant.

1116
01:30:50,083 --> 01:30:53,124
I'm not firing her for being pregnant.
I'm firing her for gross incompetency.

1117
01:30:53,126 --> 01:30:57,299
Bridget is the beating heart of this
show. How could you want to fire her?

1118
01:30:57,301 --> 01:31:00,148
How about for interviewing a
chauffeur instead of a general?

1119
01:31:00,150 --> 01:31:04,394
Using a TV interview to determine if a
guest might be the father of her child...

1120
01:31:04,396 --> 01:31:08,879
and being responsible for the
broadcast of six bare arses?

1121
01:31:14,371 --> 01:31:17,926
It's okay. It really okay, Richard.

1122
01:31:18,455 --> 01:31:22,109
I was going to quit anyway. Probably.

1123
01:31:22,619 --> 01:31:26,955
Believe it or not, I was a little
like you when I started here.

1124
01:31:27,079 --> 01:31:32,359
A little chunkier and much less makeup,
but I wanted to make my mark too.

1125
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:35,035
But I don't want to be
part of your re-branding.

1126
01:31:35,163 --> 01:31:39,320
I haven't got the right haircut anyway and
I don't drink cocktails out of jam jars

1127
01:31:39,322 --> 01:31:41,644
or post photos of my lunch on Instagram.

1128
01:31:41,646 --> 01:31:44,147
And I suppose it's become
unfashionable to care

1129
01:31:44,147 --> 01:31:46,547
about wanting to make
something worthwhile.

1130
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:50,938
But I would rather be old-fashioned
and unemployed...

1131
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:53,894
than part of a show that
celebrates the inane.

1132
01:31:54,163 --> 01:31:56,965
Then maybe when my boy
is old enough to understand,

1133
01:31:56,965 --> 01:31:59,765
integrity will be fashionable again.

1134
01:32:27,747 --> 01:32:29,327
What have I done?

1135
01:32:44,119 --> 01:32:46,708
It's all very well fighting
for your principles

1136
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:49,308
when there's no food in the fridge.

1137
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:57,956
I mean, how difficult can
it be to find another job...

1138
01:32:57,958 --> 01:33:01,357
when you've just been fired
and your nine months pregnant?

1139
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:06,529
And whatever happens now, I'm going
to get you one of those bloody Bugaboos.

1140
01:33:09,703 --> 01:33:11,606
Birthday?

1141
01:33:13,455 --> 01:33:16,119
Oh God, brains gone to mush.

1142
01:33:16,703 --> 01:33:18,119
First shag?

1143
01:33:23,674 --> 01:33:24,746
No.

1144
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:28,774
Bugger.

1145
01:33:33,495 --> 01:33:35,119
I'm very sorry.

1146
01:33:37,871 --> 01:33:41,443
I've gone all crap, all of a sudden.

1147
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:43,043
Right.

1148
01:33:53,287 --> 01:33:55,579
No, no, no, no. Fuck.

1149
01:35:32,711 --> 01:35:35,795
Okay, new pre-birth resolutions.

1150
01:35:35,919 --> 01:35:40,587
I, Bridget Jones, am going to
be the best mother in the world.

1151
01:35:41,463 --> 01:35:43,755
I'm going to try not to
leave you in a shop...

1152
01:35:43,879 --> 01:35:48,755
or put you in the washing machine like
the woman in the newspaper with her cat.

1153
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:54,029
Look, I know I made you a promise to
get things sorted before you got here.

1154
01:35:54,211 --> 01:35:59,747
Well the truth is, I haven't,
but you and me can do this together...

1155
01:36:00,419 --> 01:36:04,264
because knights in shining armour
don't exist any more.

1156
01:36:04,963 --> 01:36:08,953
Or do they?

1157
01:36:23,919 --> 01:36:25,566
Hi.

1158
01:36:26,711 --> 01:36:31,100
Bridget. Good God, what are you
doing there? You're all wet.

1159
01:36:31,102 --> 01:36:35,211
Yes, I locked myself out,
and left my bag...

1160
01:36:35,213 --> 01:36:40,542
Lost my keys, phone, my mind.

1161
01:36:41,503 --> 01:36:43,419
What are you doing here?

1162
01:36:45,047 --> 01:36:51,132
It seems I can always find time to
save the world, but you're my world.

1163
01:36:58,463 --> 01:37:01,003
I thought you were back with Candida.

1164
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:05,698
You know perfectly well her name's Camilla.
- Camilla.

1165
01:37:08,047 --> 01:37:12,883
I came round your house to find you,
and she was there.

1166
01:37:12,885 --> 01:37:16,220
She came to collect her bags.
Gone back to The Hague.

1167
01:37:16,419 --> 01:37:18,547
Just taken her to the airport.

1168
01:37:37,669 --> 01:37:38,917
Thank you.

1169
01:37:42,461 --> 01:37:44,177
Bridget...

1170
01:37:45,209 --> 01:37:47,669
You know I find
emotional declarations...

1171
01:37:48,877 --> 01:37:50,512
difficult.

1172
01:37:52,293 --> 01:37:53,917
But the truth is ...

1173
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:01,545
Why are my trousers warm?

1174
01:38:05,001 --> 01:38:07,333
My waters must have broken.
- Oh Jesus.

1175
01:38:07,461 --> 01:38:09,625
So sorry. I'll get a cloth.

1176
01:38:09,627 --> 01:38:12,036
But you're not due for another
two or three weeks.

1177
01:38:12,038 --> 01:38:15,833
That's a contraction. I think we
should get to the hospital quickly.

1178
01:38:15,961 --> 01:38:18,243
Absolutely.
- Let's take your car.

1179
01:38:18,245 --> 01:38:21,045
I came in a taxi.
- Oh, for fucks sake.

1180
01:38:21,047 --> 01:38:24,085
Well, how was I supposed to know?
- No, not you. The contractions.

1181
01:38:24,087 --> 01:38:26,003
No, we'll take your car.

1182
01:38:26,103 --> 01:38:28,503
- We can't. The car keys are in
my bag with everything else.

1183
01:38:30,461 --> 01:38:34,585
Five, six, seven, eight...
- Just pant, and breathe, and count.

1184
01:38:34,587 --> 01:38:37,169
...Nine, ten.
- It's what your supposed to do, isn't it?

1185
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:47,209
You should get that. It might be work.

1186
01:38:49,501 --> 01:38:53,786
No don't!
- Oi! What the fuck?

1187
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:58,418
That's really sweet,
but we've got to call a cab.

1188
01:38:59,009 --> 01:39:00,009
Oh, shit.

1189
01:39:00,209 --> 01:39:01,877
Right, what do we do?

1190
01:39:04,461 --> 01:39:06,377
I'll think of something.

1191
01:39:10,585 --> 01:39:12,625
Watch out.
- Out of the way.

1192
01:39:14,085 --> 01:39:17,253
We go to the hospital.
We're going to make a baby.

1193
01:39:20,377 --> 01:39:22,082
Let's go.

1194
01:39:22,084 --> 01:39:27,090
God, this is...
This is really happening.

1195
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:31,625
I'm going to be a mother.
Maybe I'm too old for all this.

1196
01:39:31,753 --> 01:39:34,125
Wait, wait. Why're you stopping?

1197
01:39:34,625 --> 01:39:37,545
A margarita with onion and pineapple.
Number 17, thank you.

1198
01:39:37,547 --> 01:39:39,156
What?

1199
01:39:48,961 --> 01:39:53,116
Who is ordering onion with pineapple,
huh? Some people they're crazy, no?

1200
01:39:55,169 --> 01:40:00,329
Yes. Okay. Here we go.

1201
01:40:02,961 --> 01:40:05,377
Do not worry, Ms. Bridget.
We get you there.

1202
01:40:05,501 --> 01:40:08,333
There is no traffic this time of night.
It's okay, eh?

1203
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,625
Vagina. Power to the vagina.

1204
01:40:10,753 --> 01:40:16,156
My God. Unbelieveable.
Is a bloody women's rights march.

1205
01:40:16,585 --> 01:40:20,838
Oh gees, not now.
- Christ, it's those women I defended.

1206
01:40:21,501 --> 01:40:23,552
It's those infernal Russians.
Just hold my hand.

1207
01:40:23,554 --> 01:40:26,408
We really need to get there.
We need to get there.

1208
01:40:27,683 --> 01:40:31,428
Right, we're getting out. Ready?
- No, I don't think it's a good idea.

1209
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:32,961
No, Bridget... Bridget.

1210
01:40:33,753 --> 01:40:38,117
Call Jack.
- I'll come behind with the bags, Mr. Mark.

1211
01:40:38,417 --> 01:40:39,669
And I call Mr. Jack.

1212
01:40:39,671 --> 01:40:43,271
It's all right, Bridget. We'll find a way.
- I don't think I can walk.

1213
01:40:44,169 --> 01:40:46,209
It's alright. I'll carry you.

1214
01:41:10,333 --> 01:41:13,797
Good God, Bridget. You're immense.
- I can't help it.

1215
01:41:15,001 --> 01:41:18,759
I think my lungs collapsed,
but this is not about me.

1216
01:41:18,761 --> 01:41:20,545
The contractions are starting again.

1217
01:41:20,547 --> 01:41:23,625
I'm going to have the baby in the street.
- I tell you what,

1218
01:41:23,627 --> 01:41:28,176
we'll rest for ten, and we'll walk for ten.
- Okay.

1219
01:41:44,377 --> 01:41:48,396
It's not much further.
- No.

1220
01:41:48,398 --> 01:41:52,770
I think it's about a mile and a half.
- Don't think...

1221
01:41:53,085 --> 01:41:55,501
Are you okay?

1222
01:41:56,669 --> 01:42:00,036
It's probably best if I don't talk too much.
- Yes.

1223
01:42:04,085 --> 01:42:09,089
Okay, I'm here. Okay.
I can take it from here.

1224
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:13,980
I'm here. Okay. I got this.
- Thank you.

1225
01:42:16,877 --> 01:42:20,131
Jesus.

1226
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:24,793
This is a two man job.
- I'm here.

1227
01:42:24,795 --> 01:42:26,877
Take her. Take her.
- I got her.

1228
01:42:26,879 --> 01:42:28,917
Jesus. Don't drop her.

1229
01:42:35,917 --> 01:42:37,877
Just inside.
- This way?

1230
01:42:37,879 --> 01:42:39,833
Yes, there.
- No, this way.

1231
01:42:40,793 --> 01:42:42,625
Okay, squeeze in.

1232
01:42:42,753 --> 01:42:44,461
Are you squeezing?
- Get her.

1233
01:42:44,463 --> 01:42:46,209
Squeeze in.
- I'm squeezing.

1234
01:42:46,333 --> 01:42:47,828
Push.

1235
01:42:49,709 --> 01:42:51,501
Closer.

1236
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:53,403
No, no, that's fine.

1237
01:42:56,209 --> 01:42:58,753
We're out.
- Nurse.

1238
01:42:58,877 --> 01:43:00,793
Carol, Carol, wheelchair. Wheelchair

1239
01:43:00,795 --> 01:43:06,025
One two three.
- Yes, over here. Please. Thank you.

1240
01:43:08,461 --> 01:43:10,070
You okay?

1241
01:43:11,545 --> 01:43:13,461
Which of you is the father?
- I am.

1242
01:43:13,585 --> 01:43:15,400
Right.

1243
01:43:20,377 --> 01:43:21,793
Breathe out the pain.

1244
01:43:23,377 --> 01:43:24,748
Oh, good.
- Hey.

1245
01:43:24,750 --> 01:43:27,913
I was wondering how many fathers
we'd get. A full house. Bingo.

1246
01:43:28,669 --> 01:43:30,753
Bridget, how do you want do this?
An epidural?

1247
01:43:30,755 --> 01:43:35,206
No, you can do this. A positive mental
attitude is stronger than any drug.

1248
01:43:35,208 --> 01:43:38,946
Okay? Just think away the pain.
- Oh bollocks to that. No, I want everything.

1249
01:43:39,085 --> 01:43:42,584
Gas, air, injections, morphine.

1250
01:43:42,586 --> 01:43:46,150
Bridget, remember your yoga.
- Fuck yoga.

1251
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:47,877
Oh, I couldn't agree with you more.

1252
01:43:47,879 --> 01:43:49,261
It's supposed to relax one...

1253
01:43:49,263 --> 01:43:53,064
but I just spend the entire time clenching
my sphincter in an effort not to fart.

1254
01:43:53,585 --> 01:43:56,770
Can we turn you over?
I just need to check your cervix.

1255
01:43:59,377 --> 01:44:02,917
You're doing very well.
Turning around. Turn to me.

1256
01:44:03,501 --> 01:44:04,917
Just a little rummage.

1257
01:44:05,669 --> 01:44:08,461
Okay, ready? Rummaging... now.

1258
01:44:11,669 --> 01:44:14,666
Yes. Oh, good, good..
You at eight centimeters already.

1259
01:44:14,668 --> 01:44:17,062
That's excellent. That means
you can't have any drugs at all.

1260
01:44:17,064 --> 01:44:19,308
What?
- You're too far gone.

1261
01:44:19,625 --> 01:44:22,159
Well done. Ooh, another contraction.

1262
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:27,917
I'm not sure how much there is to gain from
you two being at the coal face if I'm honest.

1263
01:44:28,045 --> 01:44:31,349
My ex-husband said it was like watching
his favourite pub burn down.

1264
01:44:31,377 --> 01:44:33,041
So. Your choice.

1265
01:44:34,961 --> 01:44:38,717
Maybe dad should go and
fetch mum a cool flannel.

1266
01:44:42,253 --> 01:44:43,501
I know. I know.

1267
01:44:44,877 --> 01:44:51,144
It's okay. You can do this.
Just, think away the pain.

1268
01:44:51,793 --> 01:44:53,917
Mother fucker.

1269
01:44:54,045 --> 01:44:58,007
Just think away the pain.
- Get out, both of you.

1270
01:44:59,501 --> 01:45:01,001
Where are you going?

1271
01:45:04,001 --> 01:45:07,209
I've changed my mind.

1272
01:45:07,333 --> 01:45:10,333
I've changed my mind.

1273
01:46:05,753 --> 01:46:07,567
You can do this.

1274
01:46:09,585 --> 01:46:11,293
You can. We can do it together.

1275
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:14,209
Just think what lifes
thrown at you already.

1276
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:20,333
You've turned disasters into triumphs...

1277
01:46:20,335 --> 01:46:25,260
with your sheer, joyful, indefatigable,
infectious lust for life.

1278
01:46:25,262 --> 01:46:28,240
You've managed this entire pregnancy
almost entirely on your own...

1279
01:46:28,242 --> 01:46:33,938
despite a lunatic mother, repressed men and
cheating boyfriends who don't deserve you.

1280
01:46:37,085 --> 01:46:39,128
Just a last few moments.

1281
01:46:39,333 --> 01:46:43,031
Just a last few moments, my love,
and then you'll see your beautiful baby.

1282
01:46:43,877 --> 01:46:48,879
What if it's not yours?
- I'll love him anyway, just as I love you.

1283
01:46:49,417 --> 01:46:53,748
The way you were, the way you are,
the way you always will be.

1284
01:47:01,545 --> 01:47:04,606
I think you better go and have that seen to.
- Thank you.

1285
01:47:05,045 --> 01:47:06,917
I'll handle it from here.

1286
01:47:10,877 --> 01:47:12,961
Think the pain away.

1287
01:47:12,963 --> 01:47:15,994
You're pushing an entire human
being out of your vagina.

1288
01:47:16,094 --> 01:47:18,894
I'd like to see them thinking it away.

1289
01:47:19,833 --> 01:47:24,125
And, with 367 of the votes...

1290
01:47:24,253 --> 01:47:28,929
the winner is Pamela Margaret Jones.
- Pamela, honey, it's Bridget.

1291
01:47:28,931 --> 01:47:31,317
Not now, Colin.
- It's about the baby.

1292
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:35,185
I hereby declare that
Pamela Margaret Jones...

1293
01:47:35,187 --> 01:47:38,229
I'm so sorry. You'll have to excuse me.

1294
01:47:38,293 --> 01:47:40,501
We are about to become a grandmother.

1295
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:47,318
Well, that's it for the special late
night edition of "Hard News".

1296
01:47:48,333 --> 01:47:51,238
25 seconds to off air. 25.
- Standby.

1297
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,383
Bridget's in labor.

1298
01:47:52,783 --> 01:47:54,583
Bridget's in labor!

1299
01:47:54,585 --> 01:47:58,024
Except to say Bridget
Jones is in labour!

1300
01:48:03,709 --> 01:48:05,417
Yes.
- Run the credits.

1301
01:48:05,419 --> 01:48:07,417
Credits.
- Run the credits.

1302
01:48:07,545 --> 01:48:10,871
I hope I'm bloody godmother.
- Cue the fucking weather.

1303
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:13,417
Listen I...

1304
01:48:17,045 --> 01:48:19,254
I owe you an apology.

1305
01:48:20,461 --> 01:48:23,468
I know I haven't behaved
very well in all of this.

1306
01:48:25,501 --> 01:48:27,114
No, it's okay.

1307
01:48:52,046 --> 01:48:53,338
Hello.

1308
01:49:16,838 --> 01:49:19,670
Say hello to our beautiful boy.

1309
01:49:22,170 --> 01:49:24,378
Go ahead.
- Thank you.

1310
01:49:39,586 --> 01:49:41,338
Let's see who you are.

1311
01:49:41,340 --> 01:49:43,462
Isn't he perfect?
- Yes.

1312
01:50:05,130 --> 01:50:06,378
Hello.

1313
01:50:10,506 --> 01:50:12,294
I'm so sorry I'm late, Bridge.

1314
01:50:12,296 --> 01:50:14,506
Some lesbians are having
a stupid all night march.

1315
01:50:14,508 --> 01:50:16,711
Actually,
they're marching in aid of free speech.

1316
01:50:16,713 --> 01:50:19,231
It's rather important.
- My God, look at him.

1317
01:50:19,233 --> 01:50:20,462
Bridge.

1318
01:50:21,422 --> 01:50:24,922
I'm so sorry that we weren't here.
There's an unbelievably long march.

1319
01:50:24,924 --> 01:50:27,170
Actually, the march is critical...
- Can I be godfather?

1320
01:50:27,294 --> 01:50:29,714
Oh, I'm depending on you.

1321
01:50:30,214 --> 01:50:32,130
Oh, congratulations.
- Well done.

1322
01:50:32,132 --> 01:50:33,768
Thank you very much.
- Well done.

1323
01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:35,422
Well done, both of you.
- To all of you.

1324
01:50:35,546 --> 01:50:37,086
Where is she?

1325
01:50:37,088 --> 01:50:40,170
I'm so sorry we didn't get here on time.
Daddy's parking the car.

1326
01:50:40,172 --> 01:50:44,227
There's some march for women's rights. I
mean, honestly, do we need any more rights?

1327
01:50:45,422 --> 01:50:47,086
Mom, meet your new grandson.

1328
01:50:49,714 --> 01:50:52,546
The darling. He looks just like...

1329
01:50:56,170 --> 01:51:00,684
Not that it matters, but...
do we know who the daddy is yet?

1330
01:51:03,338 --> 01:51:04,714
Shall we find out?

1331
01:51:06,922 --> 01:51:08,922
Come on, you two.
Time for a little test.

1332
01:51:09,922 --> 01:51:13,006
It's so exciting, isn't it? It's like
the final of the X Factor or something.

1333
01:51:13,008 --> 01:51:17,383
Dial 01 if you want it to be Mark and
02 if you want it to be Jack.

1334
01:51:32,046 --> 01:51:34,338
Well, good luck.
- You too.

1335
01:51:41,006 --> 01:51:42,586
Please.
- Thank you.

1336
01:53:03,422 --> 01:53:06,199
You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1337
01:53:06,794 --> 01:53:09,536
Hello darling. Hello.

1338
01:53:10,086 --> 01:53:11,752
Hello.

1339
01:53:21,546 --> 01:53:24,540
Hello.
- Hi.

1340
01:53:28,006 --> 01:53:32,098
We're really doing this.
- No going back now.

1341
01:53:32,670 --> 01:53:37,674
We are gathered here to celebrate the
union of Bridget Rose Jones...

1342
01:53:38,170 --> 01:53:41,254
and Mark Fitzwilliam Darcy.

1343
01:53:43,006 --> 01:53:47,437
Aand by the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you...

1344
01:53:47,962 --> 01:53:51,691
finally, husband and wife.

1345
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:37,474
Jack,
what on earth are you doing with my son?

1346
01:54:37,574 --> 01:54:40,374
Well,
don't leave me alone with him again.

1347
01:54:40,376 --> 01:54:43,709
I have no idea what I'm doing.
- Is he traumatized?

1348
01:54:51,086 --> 01:54:56,145
Hallo, William Jones-Darcy.
Are you ready?

1349
01:54:58,546 --> 01:55:01,422
Some champagne for you?
- Yes please.

1350
01:55:02,754 --> 01:55:07,453
Dear Diary. And so, I, Bridget Jones ...

1351
01:55:07,586 --> 01:55:12,099
am a singleton no more. Married? Yes.

1352
01:55:12,378 --> 01:55:16,162
Smug? Well, it's about time, so...
