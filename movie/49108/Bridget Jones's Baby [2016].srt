2
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:05,353

3
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:09,620

4
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,712
The 9th of May. Birthday.

5
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:44,733
Now how I came up here again?

6
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:48,400
Piss off.

7
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:54,850
Twelve hours earlier.

8
00:02:54,861 --> 00:03:00,025
My birthday actually began like all my birthdays.

9
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:13,516
Hello Sweetie. I'm calling to congratulate you.

10
00:03:13,644 --> 00:03:16,213
Mom? It's six o'clock in the morning.

11
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,768
I now use FaceTime. learned from Una. It's really great.

12
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:23,808
The purpose of FaceTime is that you do not have to keep your ear to the phone.

13
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:26,808
What stupid of me. There you are.

14
00:03:26,932 --> 00:03:29,600
Around this time, 43 years ago ...

15
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:33,335
I ate Indian lamb in an attempt to chase you out.

16
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:37,216
A delivery of 23 hours. It's down there never been more right.

17
00:03:37,308 --> 00:03:40,813
It's a miracle, bring a child into the world. 
- Here he comes.

18
00:03:40,824 --> 00:03:44,144
The son of Penny-Husband Bosworth sells his sperm on the internet.

19
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,257
You do not even need a man.

20
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,452
People have a great life without them. Look at you.

21
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,060
Great apartment, nice job ...

22
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:55,268
Great condo. 
- I'm going to hang up.

23
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:59,432
Congratulate Bridget here with her birthday. Colin?

24
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,184
Congratulations, Bridget.

25
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,438
Dank je.

26
00:04:03,613 --> 00:04:05,644
I love you sweetheart. Do not forget...

27
00:04:05,768 --> 00:04:08,436
I count on you to help me with my media campaign.

28
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:12,184
It is the church council elections, not the American primaries.

29
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,600
The annual call from my mother to put my ovaries to work.

30
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:23,768
Frankly I had thought that I would have a child ...

31
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:26,100
with the love of my life.

32
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,768
But sometimes life gives more superficial gratifications ...

33
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:33,392
and I was at least back to my ideal weight.

34
00:04:34,932 --> 00:04:36,144
Good day, Ms. Bridget.

35
00:04:36,268 --> 00:04:37,852
You look beautiful again today.

36
00:04:37,976 --> 00:04:40,684
There was still life in the old dog.

37
00:04:40,808 --> 00:04:43,852
Not much elated lately.

38
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:45,976
Hello.

39
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:50,768
But this year all these things came more clearly to the fore ...

40
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:55,016
by earlier than thought to attend an event.

41
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:08,899
Hello.

42
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:14,881
How do you feel? Is everything alright?

43
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,104
And.

44
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:19,335
I can not believe he's gone.

45
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:44,822
His death tends to concentrate on the Eastern European market models.

46
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:50,060
They found the black box but no bodies yet.

47
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:54,476
Curiously fitting that he died as he ducked into the bushes.

48
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:04,060
We are here together to celebrate life ...

49
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:07,749
van Daniel Cleaver.

50
00:06:07,852 --> 00:06:12,932
Daniel was a sweet and wonderful son ...

51
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:16,145
Damn. What's he doing here?

52
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,144
You know how he is, always wants to do the right thing.

53
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:23,255
Is that his wife?

54
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,392
Was I ever get over the loss of Mr. Darcy?

55
00:06:27,745 --> 00:06:30,037
he was my True?

56
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:31,560
Jesus.

57
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:36,892
A man with a lot of charm and charisma.

58
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:40,771
I'm a little emotional.
 - I would like to ask forward his loved ones ...

59
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:46,684
to share some memories of Daniel with us.

60
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,892
Daniel could be very sensitive ...

61
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:53,916
He gave you the feeling of being the only woman on earth.

62
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:55,589
I met Daniel in Moscow.

63
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,509
He went boating with me on the Serpentine and Keats quoted from memory.

64
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,224
He could quote from memory Keats. - Where you going, girl from Devon.

65
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:06,516
And what's in your basket?
 - Where are you going, girl from Devon.

66
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:09,224
And what's in your basket?

67
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:13,505
You, young, nice girl, straight from the farm.

68
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:16,144
I get a snack if I am asking?

69
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,020
He did it with everyone.

70
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:25,724
Is there anyone who would like some more to say?

71
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,709
Say something for his mother.

72
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,308
Think of anything.

73
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:47,515
Daniel was a man ...

74
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,278
that many of us here has touched today, me too.

75
00:07:58,106 --> 00:07:59,190
O jee.

76
00:08:00,224 --> 00:08:03,745
Here Daniel would have said, "Shut up, Jones."

77
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:08,144
And he would be right, because all I really have to say is ...

78
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:12,852
Dear Daniel, I will miss you terribly.

79
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,852
We'll all do.

80
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:23,684
Shall I call you? - Yes please. Bye.

81
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,426
Bridget.
- Mark.

82
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,472
This is Camilla. - Hello.

83
00:08:29,483 --> 00:08:31,494
Bridget, an old friend.

84
00:08:31,505 --> 00:08:34,773
Well, less ancient, more childhood friend.

85
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,735
New...

86
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:42,003
Good service, where you can say.

87
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:45,345
You go to almost that of yourself looking out.

88
00:08:47,414 --> 00:08:49,166
Already, new ...

89
00:08:50,357 --> 00:08:52,317
Bye. - Bye.

90
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:59,219
Maybe that's why Mark Darcy and I never made it.

91
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,746
I always felt like a rattling, hag, even when we were together.

92
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:07,284
I was not going to keep stabbing at the negative things.

93
00:09:07,295 --> 00:09:10,184
Nobody on my work knew at least that it was my birthday.

94
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,996
Or how old I would be.

95
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Surprise.

96
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:18,600
Congratulations, Bridget.

97
00:09:18,611 --> 00:09:21,195
Or so I thought.

98
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:23,495
Who told you?

99
00:09:23,506 --> 00:09:26,050
It's so hot. So many candles.

100
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:40,560
There is no law for the maximum number of candles on a cake from a certain age?

101
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:46,265
Josh, you look at what Reuters says about the attacks on Ramallah.

102
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,965
We're going to maybe live. And Laura ...

103
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:50,759
I may be a year older and still single ...

104
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,857
but I always found solace in my job as a top producer.

105
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:57,844
How am I going to change the world today?

106
00:09:57,855 --> 00:10:00,943
Our main topic is the exclusive interview ...

107
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:03,724
with the Minister of Foreign Affairs on NGochi.

108
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,940
How did you do that? - NGochi.

109
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,389
NGochi. - You're doing a good job.

110
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,100
I have practiced. NGochi.

111
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,839
It's trickier than you think.

112
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:21,670
And have 30-plus colleagues who are not obsessed with children and married.

113
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,864
How are we going to celebrate tonight?

114
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:27,537
Night out with the group. - Please tell me we have to group sex.

115
00:10:27,548 --> 00:10:30,291
Group sex? Since we love.

116
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,793
I'm a crazy club Berwick Street.

117
00:10:32,804 --> 00:10:34,685
A cake would be nice.

118
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:37,543
I think I've already passed my sexual expiration date.

119
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:40,437
No. There are names for women like you.

120
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,779
You're a cougar. You're a MILF.

121
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:48,449
I'm not a MILF, I'm not a mother. I am a spinster, I'm a OVILF.

122
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,688
Three minutes into the broadcast. - It's called Voyeurz with a 'z'.

123
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:54,506
Say that Cathy sent you.

124
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:58,116
On Thursdays there is a Chinese buffet. As much as you want.

125
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:03,979
But whose advice sometimes a little too modern.

126
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:07,259
I am equally testing. - Yes.

127
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,475
You let not accidentally freeze your eggs? - No, that will have now boiled.

128
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:14,514
You know what, Bridget? This weekend...

129
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,476
we should go out and get a lot ...

130
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,706
"Binge drinking, a danger to society."

131
00:11:21,717 --> 00:11:23,710
Do I need new legislation?

132
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,464
Bridge, Miranda, I said, do not talk between the gongs.

133
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,005
Stick to the questions on the cards.

134
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,173
Miranda.

135
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:34,701
The Minister of Foreign Affairs later in the studio ...

136
00:11:34,712 --> 00:11:37,802
to talk about the crisis in Muribundi.

137
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,947
You can always try online dating again.

138
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,978
Recently I was on Tinder. Half an hour later I have a trio with ...

139
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:48,969
Prince Andrew, Royal Representative for Trade and Investment ...

140
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,607
You did that on purpose. - ... Has written his first children's book.

141
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,499
He had a huge dick.

142
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:59,828
Live in de studio is
minister George Wilkins...

143
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,388
who has just returned from the stricken Muribundi ...

144
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,310
Miranda, I am speaking in your ear. Follow me.

145
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:07,366
... Where the murder of the bloody dictator Charles NGochi ...

146
00:12:07,377 --> 00:12:10,516
has led to a civil war. - One shot, back to four. Four.

147
00:12:10,527 --> 00:12:15,560
Minister, this was a military coup? - It seems that NGochi's own generals ...

148
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:17,589
Hi, Tom. I can not talk.

149
00:12:17,843 --> 00:12:20,949
How was Daniel's funeral? - It was sad.

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,774
I can not believe he's gone.

151
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,426
It's sad. I can not believe he's gone.

152
00:12:28,063 --> 00:12:31,020
I do not think his death regretted having to.

153
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:34,344
His persecution of the Ubuntu population led to genocide.

154
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:37,741
It is generally known. - I know he had his flaws.

155
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:40,908
I know he had flaws. - He could be a real asshole.

156
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,757
He could be a real asshole.

157
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:48,596
But I miss him. We all do. - But I miss him. We all do.

158
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:53,766
He was certainly a colorful character on the international stage ...

159
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:56,243
I admit, but I think the genocide ...

160
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:59,977
which caused the death of 10,000 of his own people, men, women and children ...

161
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,385
he still puts on the dark side of history.

162
00:13:02,396 --> 00:13:06,312
At least he was never boring.

163
00:13:07,398 --> 00:13:09,268
One, two, three and ready.

164
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:13,092
Do you think democracy will ever set foot in West Africa ...

165
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:14,803
Now that's NGochi dead?

166
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:20,801
Do you think democracy ever get in West Africa foothold now that NGochi is deceased?

167
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:23,482
Well, it is finally an interesting question.

168
00:13:23,493 --> 00:13:25,155
No more time. - Complete.

169
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:27,264
Shortly, please, Minister. - It's complicated.

170
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:28,633
A 'yes' or 'no'.

171
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:31,505
Make sure that the last answer. - Let's hope so.

172
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,643
We conclude with. Thank you for coming today.

173
00:13:34,654 --> 00:13:36,048
Back to you, Toby.

174
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,476
Dank je, Miranda, Bridget.

175
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:44,253
Could you not behave like now the new management team was here?

176
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:45,802
Are they the new management team?

177
00:13:45,813 --> 00:13:48,732
That's Alice Peabody, the new brand manager.

178
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:52,475
Apparently 'Hard News' is too old, too seriously ...

179
00:13:52,486 --> 00:13:56,807
and she is the smiling assassin, which is to dismiss anyone who is older than she.

180
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:01,697
Everyone is older than she. I have cans of soup that are older than they are.

181
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:07,044
See them nevertheless agree with their apps and their ironic beards.

182
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,663
Perhaps that could be one of them having sex with Bridget.

183
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:11,580
What? - Want to have sex?

184
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,600
Nee. - Yes.

185
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:17,329
And so we go one weekend steps all other steps Weekend late fade.

186
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,567
Bridget, right?

187
00:14:21,757 --> 00:14:24,586
Yes, pleasant ... - Team Talk morning.

188
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:26,601
We can get acquainted.

189
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,368
Nine o'clock in the morning.

190
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,313
We all have to start an hour earlier in the morning.

191
00:14:40,614 --> 00:14:43,726
Do you think she saw? - Maybe not.

192
00:14:43,948 --> 00:14:46,996
Are you sure you do not go out with us?

193
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:50,489
Thanks, but I can not let the old club only.

194
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,799
They now stay at home moms. That would have been disappointed.

195
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:59,299
Sorry Bridget, the babysitter has just run off.

196
00:15:04,288 --> 00:15:06,653
Against it, girl.

197
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,769
Praise the Lord for the gay community.

198
00:15:13,224 --> 00:15:16,609
What fears you today carry with you ...

199
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,895
I want you take those fears and to them says they should opsodemieteren.

200
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:21,906
And.

201
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:27,224
Are you ready? - Yes.

202
00:15:27,352 --> 00:15:30,432
Bikes but, sexy girls. Bicycles.

203
00:15:35,177 --> 00:15:38,615
I'm sorry, Bridget, but I have to cancel.

204
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:45,152
I did not tell you today, but Eduardo and I are going to adopt.

205
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,701
Adopt?

206
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:50,722
What, baby? - Yes, baby.

207
00:15:51,436 --> 00:15:53,364
A GAYBY, in our case.

208
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:57,169
That's great news, Tom.

209
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,377
I'm going to Bogota to start the paperwork so I have to pack.

210
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:02,512
Great, go ahead.

211
00:16:02,523 --> 00:16:04,420
Happy Birthday. Lots of fun.

212
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,602
Congratulations. - Thank's sweetheart.

213
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:10,816
Totally awesome.

214
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:14,866
And so I ended up here.

215
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,754
The last old tart in London ...

216
00:16:17,796 --> 00:16:23,786
and my two great loves has married one and the other death.

217
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:28,391
Exactly, new plans for my birthday.

218
00:16:28,402 --> 00:16:31,218
I, Bridget Jones'm done with love affairs ...

219
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:35,268
and will devote the autumn of my life to hedonism.

220
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,471
Go only with free spirits like Miranda ...

221
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:43,776
and if it is serious, I'm good way for a spa weekend.

222
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:47,017
Damn.

223
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:50,192
Beautiful shoes.

224
00:17:04,137 --> 00:17:07,150
I did not tell you because you would not otherwise get.

225
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,397
Really, it's been five years now.

226
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:13,408
Shake who attracted burqa off ...

227
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:16,341
after it went out with your lover Mark Darcy.

228
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,367
Nonsense. I almost never think about him.

229
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,900
What you need is a good turn.

230
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:24,646
You just have an old-fashioned, do-lie-and-think-of-England needed lovemaking ...

231
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:30,329
and festivals are sexual banga parties like Sodom and Gomorrah with tofu.

232
00:17:30,348 --> 00:17:32,559
You have to have sex with the first man you meet.

233
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,236
The first man? - I will not accept 'no'.

234
00:17:35,292 --> 00:17:39,031
I'll get our backstage passes. You get the map.

235
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:45,776
Maps.

236
00:17:45,787 --> 00:17:50,738
I may be old and dressed wrong, but I see there great.

237
00:17:58,068 --> 00:18:00,776
Exactly why I have not done my heels.

238
00:18:01,577 --> 00:18:03,608
Hello Babe.

239
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:04,619
May I?

240
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:22,326
Dank je.

241
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:28,944
Look at that. It fits.

242
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,792
Bridget.

243
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:36,998
Bridget.

244
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:40,776
Is that the wicked stepmother? - Yes.

245
00:18:40,976 --> 00:18:44,776
I'll go before I need to clean the fireplace.

246
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:48,196
Thank you. - You're welcome.

247
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:51,695
Good plan number two.

248
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:55,487
The way to a man's heart is not through beauty, sex or love ...

249
00:18:55,498 --> 00:18:56,498
My name is Jack.

250
00:18:56,607 --> 00:19:00,692
but because of the ability to fall filled in the mud.

251
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:02,087
Besides.

252
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:08,692
What's ours? - Let's see.

253
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:12,203
And it's not just glam camping pears.

254
00:19:12,287 --> 00:19:15,509
By putting on 'gl' it is not better.

255
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,112
By calling him 'Gladolf Hitler can not suddenly forget all the bad things.

256
00:19:26,276 --> 00:19:29,372
Damn.

257
00:19:34,457 --> 00:19:36,165
NGochi.

258
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:42,711
NGochi.

259
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:47,493
NGochi.

260
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:55,702
It is half past three in the afternoon. I would now vacuuming at home.

261
00:20:11,536 --> 00:20:14,798
This is incredible. We have to have a picture.

262
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,409
Pardon?

263
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:20,009
Would you like to take a picture of us?

264
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,852
Yes of course. - Thank you.

265
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,108
Are you ready? - What are you doing?

266
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:28,191
I wanted to take a picture.

267
00:20:28,202 --> 00:20:31,057
I thought you wanted a picture. - Yes, all of us.

268
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:35,132
We thought it would be nice to have a picture of us backstage ...

269
00:20:35,143 --> 00:20:36,906
between all of these known people.

270
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,981
I believe that the guy is 'Bargain Hunt'.

271
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:42,275
It would be nice if he would be able to. - Quickly.

272
00:20:42,362 --> 00:20:46,263
So you do not want me in the picture? - Bit dimming, dude.

273
00:20:46,274 --> 00:20:48,108
Is it really that difficult?

274
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,856
They leave everything nowadays backstage.

275
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:55,984
I do not know. He's cute and he looks familiar.

276
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,786
He works according to me at the Starbucks in Balham.

277
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,024
One, two, three, singing.

278
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:20,586
My God.

279
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:24,524
I know. It's that guy from Starbucks.

280
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,035
Crowdsurfing.

281
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:46,333
Miranda.

282
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,597
Miranda?

283
00:21:51,442 --> 00:21:52,858
Miranda?

284
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,568
Hoi, Miranda.

285
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,595
God.

286
00:22:03,745 --> 00:22:07,152
I have to admit, that was fun.

287
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:09,609
And you're right ...

288
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:14,067
I need a good turn ...

289
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:19,782
an old-fashioned, do-lie-and-think-of-England ...

290
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:21,900
lovemaking.

291
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,692
I participate.

292
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:26,524
My God.

293
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,358
What are you doing in my yurt?

294
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:36,232
With all your clothes, luggage and belongings.

295
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,685
It's like I walked in and claimed.

296
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,066
Wait, it's you, the essence of the Black Sea.

297
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:44,652
Yes. Sorry.

298
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:48,900
Do I really believe that you came by accident in my yurt?

299
00:22:50,045 --> 00:22:53,442
While you're here, maybe I can help you.

300
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,108
He's the first man I met ...

301
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,650
and his yurt is a lot better than mine.

302
00:23:01,692 --> 00:23:06,152
Bridget, where are you?

303
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:10,632
Bridget, I'm so drunk.

304
00:23:55,692 --> 00:23:56,944
Bridget.

305
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:02,776
I zorb with Ed Sheeran.

306
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,524
God.

307
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,652
I just had sex with a complete stranger. I'm just a whore.

308
00:24:34,776 --> 00:24:39,108
No. I am an elegant older woman who takes men for her own pleasure.

309
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,838
Or I'm just a crazy middle-aged woman?

310
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:51,152
Never mind.

311
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,152
Miranda?

312
00:24:55,932 --> 00:24:57,140
Good morning.

313
00:24:59,108 --> 00:25:01,444
It took six hours?

314
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:04,276
Which lasted six hours?

315
00:25:04,984 --> 00:25:08,232
A puppet show where Aunt Bridget was there.

316
00:25:08,944 --> 00:25:12,349
A six-hour puppet show? - Hey.

317
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,108
Tell me, were the little dolls or ...?

318
00:25:15,232 --> 00:25:17,108
Very nice size.

319
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:20,484
And he has ...

320
00:25:21,608 --> 00:25:23,768
his doll made in your mouth?

321
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,457
My God. It feels like my days for a puppet show are over.

322
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,507
I've had finger puppets.

323
00:25:38,108 --> 00:25:41,816
And he called? - So does that nowadays no more.

324
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:45,316
You take a singer at a music festival ...

325
00:25:45,327 --> 00:25:47,185
but no story attached to it.

326
00:25:47,732 --> 00:25:49,652
A doll without a story.

327
00:25:50,438 --> 00:25:52,511
Take off the wings. That's for little girls.

328
00:25:53,524 --> 00:25:55,154
Hey? - Where the hell are you?

329
00:25:55,165 --> 00:25:59,134
We drive through the countryside on the way to your christening.

330
00:25:59,145 --> 00:26:02,237
No that is not true. Why lie aunt Bridget?

331
00:26:02,984 --> 00:26:05,743
Bridge, you should know that after Tom had to cancel ...

332
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:08,015
Mark Giles asked as godfather. - What?

333
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,423
What did he do?

334
00:26:09,463 --> 00:26:11,652
Yes I know. You have nothing on that dick.

335
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:13,316
He did it without asking.

336
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:18,459
My God. Weather Mark Darcy.

337
00:26:18,615 --> 00:26:23,239
The second time this week that I was in a church bowl substituting as the spinster.

338
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,533
Where were you, damn it?

339
00:26:35,163 --> 00:26:36,941
Sorry.

340
00:26:41,117 --> 00:26:43,507
Good morning and welcome.

341
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:48,452
This is not at all embarrassing. Mark Darcy and me at the altar with a baby.

342
00:26:49,272 --> 00:26:50,980
That is beautiful.

343
00:26:51,232 --> 00:26:53,999
Big beautiful smile. Look at me. Thank you.

344
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,287
Beautiful.

345
00:26:55,298 --> 00:26:57,890
Now only the godparents.

346
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,669
How are you? - Very good, thank you. And with you?

347
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,405
Good thank you.

348
00:27:04,604 --> 00:27:07,892
Are you here with your wife? What's her name again?

349
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:11,960
Camilla. No, she could not be there.

350
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,695
Are you here with someone? - Not today, no.

351
00:27:16,123 --> 00:27:18,068
Come on, it's not a funeral.

352
00:27:18,192 --> 00:27:20,121
Can you laugh?

353
00:27:20,132 --> 00:27:22,645
Give her otherwise but a peck on the forehead.

354
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:27,900
I actually meant the baby.

355
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,652
Stunning.

356
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:37,384
I'll see you later, most likely.

357
00:27:37,395 --> 00:27:40,993
Yes, unless I'm getting away with this thing here.

358
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,866
Can this day be more painful?

359
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:48,206
Keep moving, walking.

360
00:27:59,524 --> 00:28:01,794
Hello. - Hello.

361
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:05,087
How are you? - Good thank you.

362
00:28:05,098 --> 00:28:06,558
How are you? - Good.

363
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:08,406
Me too.

364
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,464
Well, goodbye. - Bye.

365
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:15,520
A glass of wine. - A whiskey, please.

366
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:17,245
Large glass. - A double.

367
00:28:17,256 --> 00:28:18,483
Dank je.

368
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:57,944
I ask you to join but you do not seem real Gangnam Style person.

369
00:28:58,068 --> 00:29:00,394
I've been there but a short time. - True?

370
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,441
Gangnam.

371
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:07,108
What are we talking about? - Gangnam dance.

372
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:11,293
Not the suburb of Seoul? - No.

373
00:29:11,304 --> 00:29:16,192
I'm not familiar with Gangnam, the suburb. - It means "south of the Han River."

374
00:29:17,787 --> 00:29:20,911
It was inhabited during the Paleolithic period.

375
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:24,979
Sounds at once a lot less.

376
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,933
Now something for all lovers on the dance floor.

377
00:29:29,944 --> 00:29:34,648
Now we come to the erection area. - Do not fucking erection during a christening.

378
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:42,484
Shall we get some fresh air?

379
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:46,985
Something fresher than here, I mean.

380
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,502
Of course.

381
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:02,770
You do not happen to have a cigarette on you? - No.

382
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:06,551
I am 1891 days ago stopped.

383
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:08,356
Not that you keep it.

384
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:11,602
Since when do you smoke? - I do not smoke.

385
00:30:12,114 --> 00:30:13,698
It's been a tough time.

386
00:30:15,078 --> 00:30:16,746
Maybe I'm nervous.

387
00:30:18,445 --> 00:30:19,613
Why?

388
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,557
There's something in your hair.

389
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,041
I know that.

390
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:30,692
Thanks to one of my many godchildren.

391
00:30:35,276 --> 00:30:38,024
Seems to be stuck.

392
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,414
And this is...

393
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:44,661
Cake?
- Soesje.

394
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,893
That is more than a dessert cake, I guess.

395
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:57,329
What are you doing? You are married. - No that is not me.

396
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,583
I mean, I'm married. I divorce.

397
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:03,546
That's why she's not here.

398
00:31:07,405 --> 00:31:09,825
You were no longer together during the memorial service?

399
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:12,174
No, she was just there as support.

400
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,934
She returned to The Hague, where she now lives, and I do not.

401
00:31:17,045 --> 00:31:18,971
I'm sorry, Mark.

402
00:31:18,982 --> 00:31:21,875
At this moment I regret that at all.

403
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:39,712
How will I ever get in here?

404
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:52,524
Again?

405
00:32:53,276 --> 00:32:55,944
Mr. Darcy, wow.

406
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:00,152
Bridget?

407
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,232
I've missed you so much.

408
00:33:11,926 --> 00:33:13,816
Are we on schedule?

409
00:33:14,944 --> 00:33:17,192
I have a morning flight to Khartoum.

410
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:57,316
I'm sorry, Mark. But I had to go.

411
00:33:57,444 --> 00:34:00,776
It probably sounds ridiculous, but I was scared.

412
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,024
The fact that we turned to each other in the last ten years ...

413
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:07,360
without ever reach the finish reminds me ...

414
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:10,776
maybe we did best by that time to stop.

415
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,316
Sometimes it's scary to still be alone on my 43rd.

416
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:19,152
But you and I have this once before experienced.

417
00:34:21,316 --> 00:34:23,759
We both loved the fantasy of us together ...

418
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,658
But the reality, as we both know, is different.

419
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:38,732
We both think of 100 reasons why it did not work between us ...

420
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:44,568
but in the end it felt like you were not there and I was usually alone.

421
00:34:56,068 --> 00:34:59,400
No, I can not stay back and make the same mistakes.

422
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:03,245
Should go further and create new ones.

423
00:35:03,524 --> 00:35:06,875
I continue with this crazy training program.

424
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:09,703
I give myself four weeks to slim down my thighs ...

425
00:35:09,714 --> 00:35:13,770
to get my fat ass in a tight teen pants ...

426
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:17,161
which is clearly not intended for women of a certain age.

427
00:35:18,276 --> 00:35:21,949
All that fucking bike makes no sense. I just came on.

428
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,639
First let's rule out some things. You're not pregnant, are you?

429
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:27,652
Of course not.

430
00:35:27,776 --> 00:35:33,045
A lady is always prepared and I have this always in my purse.

431
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:37,175
You did not used vegan condoms?

432
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:39,541
Biodegradable and friendly dolphin.

433
00:35:39,552 --> 00:35:42,984
When I'm slutty, I think it's a nice idea that I'm helping the environment.

434
00:35:43,108 --> 00:35:46,638
Jesus, Bridget. I can still remember when you bought it.

435
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:49,148
That was several decades ago.

436
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,902
Sustainability dates say nothing.

437
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:53,986
Do you?

438
00:35:55,192 --> 00:35:57,867
They were a gift. Just ask no further.

439
00:35:59,484 --> 00:36:03,809
Fast flowing rivers and foaming waterfalls ...

440
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:05,809
a babbling brook.

441
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:11,201
nevertheless Hurry up, Bridget.

442
00:36:23,608 --> 00:36:25,568
How long, do you think?

443
00:36:28,364 --> 00:36:31,045
I think that's a positive result.

444
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,238
Pregnant

445
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,305
I check it here. - Do not shake.

446
00:36:37,316 --> 00:36:40,152
You do hurt the baby. - The baby is not in the stick.

447
00:36:42,143 --> 00:36:43,899
I think this is the time ...

448
00:36:44,495 --> 00:36:46,079
you jump for joy.

449
00:36:46,944 --> 00:36:50,158
My God. - You are pregnant.

450
00:36:50,169 --> 00:36:52,692
I am pregnant. - You're pregnant.

451
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:57,322
I am pregnant. - You get a baby.

452
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,118
I'm having a baby.

453
00:37:04,908 --> 00:37:07,449
I'm having a baby. - Yes.

454
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:15,484
If you have footage of her as she strikes a horse, then I want it.

455
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:19,165
Bridget, you want a child? - I do not know.

456
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:22,795
I'm 43.

457
00:37:22,987 --> 00:37:25,814
This could be that I get only chance.

458
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:31,362
One broken, expired condom I had believed.

459
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:33,199
But two?

460
00:37:35,058 --> 00:37:36,453
You wanted it.

461
00:37:37,662 --> 00:37:39,314
Maybe.

462
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:44,022
Can there even be a doctor?

463
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:52,076
My God. I am pregnant.

464
00:37:52,734 --> 00:37:54,522
This is it.

465
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,358
Rather, who is it?

466
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:02,814
This is not like I thought it would be.

467
00:38:03,308 --> 00:38:08,006
I always saw myself in 'OK!' magazine with the man of my dreams.

468
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,140
Too much to worry about.

469
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,672
Including ...

470
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,796
Who was this man whom I had sex in a tent?

471
00:38:16,535 --> 00:38:20,787
So you're 43 years old?

472
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:33,059
Any time with my wonderful husband we were pregnant?

473
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,606
Does that matter?

474
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:38,319
Yes, it is such a special moment.

475
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,419
We want to know what time it was so that we can cherish.

476
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:45,755
Can not you cherish both? - Yes, we do.

477
00:38:45,766 --> 00:38:50,066
But one of these days will be more likely than the other?

478
00:38:50,424 --> 00:38:56,398
Well, day 10, his birthday, is a bit on the early side.

479
00:38:56,409 --> 00:39:00,734
And day 16 after ... - Anniversary dinner.

480
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:04,150
Oh yes, the ossobuco, now I'm late again, is a little.

481
00:39:04,161 --> 00:39:07,295
Are you sure there was not a special moment between?

482
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:11,339
Yes, I'm sure. He was gone.

483
00:39:12,826 --> 00:39:15,158
Which one would you think?

484
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:18,734
Hard to say. Both of them are the same. It might even have been afterwards.

485
00:39:18,745 --> 00:39:21,538
Sperm can live for days after ejaculation.

486
00:39:21,641 --> 00:39:24,069
Would not you want to take a chance on me? - No.

487
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:28,066
And after the initial scan? Is to infer when conception occurred?

488
00:39:28,077 --> 00:39:30,606
No. Call this number for an appointment.

489
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,690
And take your father with it, if you know who it is.

490
00:39:35,543 --> 00:39:36,667
Okay.

491
00:39:40,106 --> 00:39:46,442
Just out of interest ... If anyone doubts over who would be the father ...

492
00:39:46,453 --> 00:39:51,206
You can take a DNA sample during amniocentesis, which I recommend to anyway.

493
00:39:51,217 --> 00:39:55,274
Since there is a higher risk of mother to a geriatric.

494
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:58,935
Geriatrisch?

495
00:39:59,491 --> 00:40:02,066
That is ridiculous. - Indeed.

496
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:07,663
Unless you can apply at the same time allowances and pensions.

497
00:40:09,398 --> 00:40:10,763
That's hilarious.

498
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:15,763
It is called "news" because it should feel new.

499
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:18,799
Otherwise, it was called "old."

500
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:20,077
Sorry.

501
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:23,487
The main stories from last night.

502
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:25,829
Earthquake in Asia, we have seen before.

503
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,858
Car accident on the M5 ...

504
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:32,710
We make 'old'. The key need that must be improved.

505
00:40:32,742 --> 00:40:35,831
I want to go throw it a lot. - She's on the warpath.

506
00:40:35,842 --> 00:40:39,314
Susan, the floor manager was fired. - She's six months pregnant.

507
00:40:39,325 --> 00:40:43,298
We have to see to grab the attention, focus control the eyes on the screen.

508
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:48,169
I want to see headlines like: "Do you get cancer from your bed?"

509
00:40:48,351 --> 00:40:52,823
"You get Alzheimer freeze?" - Oh my God. Is that right?

510
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:56,907
It has not been proven, but you miss the point. The attention, nevertheless draws?

511
00:40:57,502 --> 00:41:01,836
I want to 'Hard News' by starting with a clear new goal.

512
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:05,004
About twelve weeks we have a presentation at the London Media Show ...

513
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,717
and I'm looking for a dynamic, innovative and focused person ...

514
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,873
to take the leading role. Volunteers?

515
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:14,834
Whatever happens, this job I have to keep.

516
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:18,358
Fascist boss should prove that I even though I am a single mother ...

517
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:21,112
well can handle ironically bearded hipsters.

518
00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:22,358
Someone?

519
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:28,479
Should you go to the bathroom, Bridget? - No, I sign up as a volunteer.

520
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:31,035
Hashtag: "Let's do this!"

521
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:46,215
It's me. Turn on your TV now. Look at your TV. Now. Put it on Channel 4.

522
00:41:49,314 --> 00:41:53,681
Bridget, I've found him. He is the dating website guru.

523
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:57,651
You have to trust the science. Algorithms do not lie.

524
00:41:57,678 --> 00:42:01,105
You fucking slept with a billionaire.

525
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:06,007
Tell me, Bridget.

526
00:42:06,308 --> 00:42:09,861
What attracted you initially to the billionaire Jack Qwant?

527
00:42:09,877 --> 00:42:13,603
It was his face or body? Big dick? - I'd do it with him, obviously.

528
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:15,809
If I were you I would not tell either.

529
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:21,402
You only need one DNA sample from one of them and then you can exclude the other.

530
00:42:21,425 --> 00:42:25,834
What should I say to Mark? "Hi Mark, I know I left dormant ...

531
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,127
but you do not know what blood, semen or old nails lying around? "

532
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:32,152
How to get in touch with Jack?

533
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:34,321
And.

534
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:39,271
He is a tycoon, damn it. Can not you just call him.

535
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:45,652
I just figured out how to win the favor of the new boss ...

536
00:42:45,668 --> 00:42:48,906
and may exclude one of the fathers.

537
00:42:48,937 --> 00:42:53,485
I must say, Bridget, I am very impressed by the next guest.

538
00:42:53,546 --> 00:42:58,625
Relevant, approachable, incredibly fuckable. Well done.

539
00:42:58,664 --> 00:43:02,177
Welcome to CSI Hard News.

540
00:43:02,209 --> 00:43:06,531
One minute about this VT. - Bring in five, are ready. Thank you.

541
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:14,254
Thanks darling. If you want to piss off now, that would be fine.

542
00:43:20,413 --> 00:43:22,657
Jack, this is Cathy. It sets you up.

543
00:43:22,776 --> 00:43:27,090
Hi, Cathy, nice to meet you. - I think of a simple purple eyeshadow ...

544
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:30,291
to emphasize your eyes and maybe a little rouge?

545
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,941
Just kidding. - What are you funny.

546
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,993
You've got quite a gray hair.

547
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:40,255
Oh, Jesus. - So. Ready.

548
00:43:40,271 --> 00:43:43,211
Frankly, there is a very gray piece. I'll just grab them?

549
00:43:43,227 --> 00:43:47,424
Yes, my hair is full of gray hair. - Well, that's settled.

550
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:51,539
Jesus Christ. - All gone, great.

551
00:43:52,354 --> 00:43:57,211
The nails of this handsome guy should not be cut best, do not you think?

552
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:00,934
These hands have not yet gone through a lot of work, do you?

553
00:44:01,169 --> 00:44:04,374
No, I'm a mathematician. - They are silky smooth.

554
00:44:04,414 --> 00:44:09,259
Tell me, Jack. Do you like Chinese food?

555
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:15,298
Jack, I will take you to the set. - Fine, thank you. Sometimes. Thank you.

556
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:18,954
I do not think she has applied makeup. - It is well. You're looking radiant.

557
00:44:22,482 --> 00:44:25,633
We start in five, four ... And do not forget to turn.

558
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:29,938
And Miranda, on cue. - Jack Qwant is uncomfortable.

559
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:35,107
Raised by one single mother in Baltimore, he made the matchmaking website Qwantify ...

560
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:38,511
and he claims to have found an algorithm for love.

561
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:43,415
Today he's here to tell us all about his number one bestseller Qwantum Leap '.

562
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:48,875
It's great to have you on our bench. - Thank you. It's nice to be here.

563
00:44:49,997 --> 00:44:54,888
We quickly talk about your new book, but let's first talk about romance.

564
00:44:54,912 --> 00:44:57,315
Qwantify has found the true love of millions.

565
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:59,578
About to two. 
- Did it work for you too?

566
00:44:59,594 --> 00:45:02,439
If I answer that we are going to talk about the book?

567
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,454
Maybe.

568
00:45:03,469 --> 00:45:06,188
Can not you try to fuck with him during the broadcast?

569
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:08,526
This is amazing. Tell her to flirt more.

570
00:45:08,547 --> 00:45:12,984
Some people were first in love with Farrah Fawcett.

571
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,582
My first love was an algorithm. - And we lost him.

572
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:20,454
If he continues to talk about algorithms I go over to the VT of cats that look like Hitler.

573
00:45:20,478 --> 00:45:21,560
Back to four.

574
00:45:21,576 --> 00:45:24,388
He avoids the question. Get him off of mathematics.

575
00:45:24,408 --> 00:45:26,565
Ask him if he has a relationship.

576
00:45:26,677 --> 00:45:30,624
For someone who's so good at linking ...

577
00:45:30,759 --> 00:45:33,421
there is someone special in your life?

578
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:37,921
Except Lady Mary of 'Downton Abbey'? Can we talk about the book?

579
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:41,490
Hitler put the cat in. - Do not react so elusive.

580
00:45:41,521 --> 00:45:46,087
It is clear that you have everything. Why did you choose not family?

581
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:48,818
Why did you choose not family? - No children.

582
00:45:49,479 --> 00:45:50,898
And no children?

583
00:45:51,546 --> 00:45:53,387
Brilliant. Zoom in on four.

584
00:45:53,406 --> 00:45:54,839
And on four. - I love it.

585
00:45:55,117 --> 00:45:56,942
I love children ...

586
00:45:56,966 --> 00:46:01,974
but have to be always found frightening the idea of ​​self-father.

587
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:05,942
That's why I'm attracted to algorithms. - Set the Hitler cats.

588
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:11,740
They are very rational, reliable and predictable anything that is not a child.

589
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,814
Can you have children?

590
00:46:14,942 --> 00:46:19,991
Are the soldiers?

591
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:28,598
Yes, I think so. The barracks are used regularly.

592
00:46:28,762 --> 00:46:30,668
Really? - Yes.

593
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,750
For someone with an alleged algorithm for love ...

594
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:36,083
Is not it strange that you've never found anyone?

595
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:39,955
I think to find something that you actively have to seek.

596
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,274
I've been too busy so I did not ...

597
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:46,595
What about the bloodline of the Qwant family? - And the bloodline of the Qwant family?

598
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:51,379
Are there unknown secrets? - Sexual disorders?

599
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:55,254
Sorry, I do not know where all this is going ...

600
00:46:55,269 --> 00:46:58,618
but I must tell you that I can attract the wrong kind of women.

601
00:46:59,495 --> 00:47:02,955
That is amazing. Thank you wanted to share with us.

602
00:47:05,312 --> 00:47:08,258
Bridget, what are you doing?

603
00:47:08,282 --> 00:47:11,021
You will not believe what crosses for weirdos my path.

604
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:12,848
Really? - Get up.

605
00:47:12,864 --> 00:47:15,141
Tell me what she does.

606
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:19,288
Ask him about algorithms. - This must be the last question.

607
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,920
As a final, algorithms. - Yes.

608
00:47:23,935 --> 00:47:27,063
What attracted you the first time in them? - The logic and ...

609
00:47:27,075 --> 00:47:30,056
Beautiful, Jack Qwant, thank you sat on my couch.

610
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,945
I hope you've had just as much fun as I did. - Jesus.

611
00:47:32,948 --> 00:47:35,202
To the extent that. Bye.

612
00:47:37,226 --> 00:47:41,555
That was amazing. - I feel that I know you, not the show.

613
00:47:41,571 --> 00:47:43,508
Are you on Tinder? - What?

614
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:45,502
Then we have not met. - No, okay.

615
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:54,059
Hey, you here. - Hi.

616
00:47:54,098 --> 00:47:56,619
Good to see you. - Also good to see you.

617
00:47:56,635 --> 00:48:02,340
I wanted to look up to say hello, but you know how chaotic live TV.

618
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:06,689
There are easier ways to get in touch with me except me on national TV ...

619
00:48:06,713 --> 00:48:11,072
ask about my sperm. - What? No, that's not what ...

620
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,573
I'd like to hear from you.

621
00:48:14,142 --> 00:48:18,201
I was disappointed when I came back tomorrow and you were gone.

622
00:48:18,311 --> 00:48:21,247
Were you? - We had a brilliant night.

623
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:25,958
I loved you. Until I became a piece ...

624
00:48:25,967 --> 00:48:29,436
of 50 gênantste talk show moments of all time.

625
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,217
Sorry. Yes that...

626
00:48:34,904 --> 00:48:38,296
How should I explain.

627
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,956
I am pregnant. - Wow. Okay.

628
00:48:49,558 --> 00:48:53,785
It's ... much better than you are mentally unbalanced.

629
00:48:54,419 --> 00:48:58,385
I'm about twelve weeks pregnant.

630
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:03,941
Okay. Right.

631
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:09,282
So you mean that it was the music? - Yes.

632
00:49:10,135 --> 00:49:15,765
It's quite a surprise. Yes but...

633
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:20,215
it goes well with me, you should know that ...

634
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,422
I want nothing from you.

635
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:28,483
Besides a complete DNA check and an assessment of my medical records.

636
00:49:28,721 --> 00:49:34,420
I just do not want you to come out.

637
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:38,821
And I feel a little silly.

638
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:42,508
Humiliated, actually. Yes, I'm humiliated.

639
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:48,315
I would like to retire politely.

640
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:51,122
Mr. Qwant, will you please sign my book?

641
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:56,743
Oh God. I have not even told him that he can not be the only father.

642
00:49:56,758 --> 00:49:58,384
Christina. - I find this amazing book.

643
00:49:58,416 --> 00:50:01,119
Katie Couric, I need to talk to you.

644
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,250
What appears to be like this Jack DNA? I want that Jack is the father?

645
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:11,171
I know Jack disagrees. And what if it is Mark Darcy?

646
00:50:11,195 --> 00:50:15,310
Jesus. I have to confess to him that I was a whore with dolphin condoms.

647
00:50:15,347 --> 00:50:16,347
Good.

648
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:18,852
So it goes well with the baby? - Perfect.

649
00:50:20,176 --> 00:50:24,781
You see? - Oh my God. Is that him?

650
00:50:30,333 --> 00:50:34,621
And all is well? - As fit as a fiddle.

651
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:36,391
Listen.

652
00:50:42,937 --> 00:50:44,074
Look at that.

653
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:48,030
I recorded it for you. Then you look.

654
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:52,839
So glad you are going to do the amniocentesis.

655
00:50:55,387 --> 00:50:56,887
Hi there.

656
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:04,239
Is that your ear or your foot? You have very big feet.

657
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,222
Oh, and you swing already.

658
00:51:15,976 --> 00:51:18,146
You're the best I've ever seen.

659
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:25,769
I promise I will do my best.

660
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:31,170
So just keep safe and cozy inside ...

661
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:36,029
while I clean up the mess here trying. And hopefully...

662
00:51:37,925 --> 00:51:42,244
What the fuck is that? - This is the needle for amniocentesis.

663
00:51:42,271 --> 00:51:46,085
We print it in, take a little amniotic fluid out and test it for abnormalities ...

664
00:51:46,109 --> 00:51:48,216
and also the DNA sample you want.

665
00:51:48,232 --> 00:51:52,386
There is a very slight risk of miscarriage so you must lie still.

666
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,967
We do not want the needle comes in contact ... - What?

667
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:58,366
No. I do not take that risk.

668
00:51:58,398 --> 00:52:01,893
He is gigantic. He comes firmly to the other side out again.

669
00:52:01,909 --> 00:52:04,731
Come, I'll take you home.

670
00:52:09,215 --> 00:52:13,320
Your mother will love it. - Promise not to tell her?

671
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:17,200
Not yet. - No, of course. I promise.

672
00:52:17,692 --> 00:52:22,019
I'm really sorry that I was the father who does not know.

673
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:24,387
Do not act so stupid.

674
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:29,038
I know plenty of people who can be anyone. - So you're not disappointed?

675
00:52:29,483 --> 00:52:34,384
Do not you think I have it on Jerry Springer? - No, I'm just happy.

676
00:52:35,543 --> 00:52:40,641
I'm not sure if you are mine or those cute lieutenant colonel of the bowling club.

677
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:43,793
It was just a joke.

678
00:52:44,182 --> 00:52:47,701
You have my feet. I've always had dainty feet.

679
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:55,362
Just tell the truth, Bridget. There you are always great.

680
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:12,638
Mark, I have some exciting news. I have to tell you something funny.

681
00:53:12,775 --> 00:53:15,392
Mark, I'm pregnant.

682
00:53:15,416 --> 00:53:17,261
Gentlemen and ladies.

683
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:20,940
There is only one crime committed today and that is the following.

684
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:25,721
To use the laws of one country to destroy the freedom of expression of another.

685
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,304
A cynical politically expedient to take away the right of these courageous young women ...

686
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,473
to speak the truth about the country they love.

687
00:53:34,281 --> 00:53:40,198
You love might not like their music and I can not blame you.

688
00:53:40,245 --> 00:53:46,228
They do not have the hang of the most basic principles of musicality the basis of melody ...

689
00:53:46,244 --> 00:53:50,848
but this is the land of Shakespeare, Orwell, Lawrence ...

690
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:54,693
I had forgotten how good he is with that wig and gown.

691
00:53:54,702 --> 00:53:59,688
... Against every country, every ruler, every despot, we will be here in the UK ...

692
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:04,760
women always defend and protect that selfless and brave ...

693
00:54:04,776 --> 00:54:07,708
their freedom have risked their lives and possibly ...

694
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:10,920
to tell the truth.

695
00:54:11,388 --> 00:54:14,691
The court will now be suspended and the matter will be felled ...

696
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:18,840
Power to the Poonani. - Jesus.

697
00:54:19,162 --> 00:54:22,240
I look forward to the return of the good old genocide.

698
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,450
Asked.

699
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,327
How do you do that?

700
00:54:33,351 --> 00:54:36,271
I did not expect to see you again after conditions at baptism.

701
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,790
Shit. He dived straight in.

702
00:54:37,814 --> 00:54:42,506
No, I understand.
 Maybe flattery works.

703
00:54:42,514 --> 00:54:45,126
You were very impressive net. - Thank you.

704
00:54:46,173 --> 00:54:49,646
While dealing with them the last month has raised a little sympathy ...

705
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:52,775
the totalitarian dictator who silenced them wants to impose.

706
00:54:53,648 --> 00:54:57,197
Okay, just kidding. Next time I will laugh harder.

707
00:54:57,261 --> 00:55:00,067
There is only a limited number of times that someone can listen to ...

708
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:04,327
absolutely not catchy "Menstruation, castration, Liberation."

709
00:55:05,747 --> 00:55:10,108
Mark, that's hilarious.

710
00:55:16,264 --> 00:55:17,264
Please.

711
00:55:26,645 --> 00:55:30,809
Thus. - So, Mark.

712
00:55:30,836 --> 00:55:31,840
And.

713
00:55:34,033 --> 00:55:38,585
The gardens look beautiful. For autumn. - Yes.

714
00:55:38,696 --> 00:55:41,625
Is that a chestnut tree? - Bridget.

715
00:55:47,509 --> 00:55:51,217
I am pregnant.

716
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,863
Okay. Well, congratulations.

717
00:55:59,375 --> 00:56:00,446
How can I help?

718
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,011
I'm three months pregnant.

719
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:10,668
You mean the baptism?

720
00:56:12,711 --> 00:56:13,711
And.

721
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:19,173
Excuse me a moment.

722
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:47,383
This is perhaps the most beautiful piece of information that I received in my entire life.

723
00:56:53,032 --> 00:56:57,695
I have no expectations about how it goes. I just thought you should know.

724
00:56:58,088 --> 00:56:59,216
No, of course.

725
00:57:01,705 --> 00:57:06,223
I mean, how do you feel? Are you happy? - Yes that's me.

726
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:10,691
So much has happened in the last ten years. Much has changed.

727
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:14,111
I mean, you've been married, and I am ...

728
00:57:14,237 --> 00:57:18,250
have been on some distant holiday destinations.

729
00:57:18,266 --> 00:57:20,680
But ...
 So there's Jack.

730
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,668
I mean ... - I know.

731
00:57:23,885 --> 00:57:27,213
But now I can not feel sad about it.

732
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,371
God, how can I tell him now.

733
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:52,922
State of emergency. Can not sleep. Thoughts go round and round in my head.

734
00:57:52,938 --> 00:57:56,435
It is really strange that you can do something so complicated and important ...

735
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,791
when growing a baby or invade Iraq without any instructions.

736
00:57:59,946 --> 00:58:02,403
All the alcohol I drank the last few years ...

737
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:04,489
the baby will give the fetal alcohol syndrome.

738
00:58:04,505 --> 00:58:06,184
These things I can do.

739
00:58:06,467 --> 00:58:07,853
Mark talk about Jack ...

740
00:58:07,873 --> 00:58:10,647
and risk that I hurt him so that I can not live with myself.

741
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,445
Mark did not tell Jack, but I can not go on with it.

742
00:58:14,453 --> 00:58:19,293
both tell them that the other is the father and the one who is not the father stripped ...

743
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:25,001
Oh Jesus. Nobody tell you something and run off.

744
00:58:26,155 --> 00:58:29,359
Hello?
 - Hey, the father of your child.

745
00:58:30,285 --> 00:58:32,718
Jack?
 - Yes, how else?

746
00:58:33,809 --> 00:58:34,896
Come on up.

747
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:45,624
Damn. He probably has hired a team of detectives Google Earth to find me.

748
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:48,818
Okay, do as normal as possible.

749
00:58:56,588 --> 00:58:58,739
Come on in. - Okay.

750
00:59:03,028 --> 00:59:06,324
You've found it. - Try it, see if it fits.

751
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,300
Wow.

752
00:59:12,779 --> 00:59:16,733
I did not expect to see you. - I did not expect to come.

753
00:59:17,059 --> 00:59:20,758
I am to be rejected not used. Twice.

754
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,757
I hope you cake in that bag.

755
00:59:32,286 --> 00:59:34,183
I thought a lot.

756
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:42,027
This whole baby situation has shocked me. We have printed an entire relationship in one night ...

757
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:45,212
and have beaten all about to start a family phase.

758
00:59:45,573 --> 00:59:48,515
We even had no real second date.

759
00:59:50,445 --> 00:59:55,324
If we had done that, then I would have taken to Ottolenghi.

760
00:59:55,451 --> 00:59:59,597
You would have got grilled salmon and pine nuts salsa.

761
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:05,282
Incredibly and healthy. And we would have come back here ...

762
01:00:05,877 --> 01:00:08,004
have great sex ...

763
01:00:08,028 --> 01:00:12,729
and the next day we send each other dirty messages.

764
01:00:24,151 --> 01:00:27,313
I would not have to do on a second date.

765
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:29,850
Why not. You let me do it on the first.

766
01:00:29,866 --> 01:00:34,029
And then we would witness a naughty weekend on the coast ...

767
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:38,444
I would prove my manhood by winning a stuffed animal ...

768
01:00:39,417 --> 01:00:40,433
on the pier.

769
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:43,942
But I really wanted the big Scooby-Doo. - Oh, no one wins.

770
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:45,514
There are coconuts stuck.

771
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,670
What are those for? - To offer my apology.

772
01:00:58,133 --> 01:00:59,640
We had our first fight.

773
01:01:00,412 --> 01:01:05,275
I was not flirting with the waitress. She means nothing to me.

774
01:01:10,435 --> 01:01:14,250
And then I'd ...

775
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:18,551
Swedish furniture bought to assemble.

776
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:24,450
If we get through this, we can do anything. - Everything.

777
01:01:25,754 --> 01:01:29,361
I would be pathetic if your neck is blotchy when you are nervous.

778
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:32,847
And I know you would be the best mother to my child.

779
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:10,182
Oh no, can not fall in love with a radiant new American.

780
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:13,098
Tomorrow I tell them both, definitely.

781
01:02:15,047 --> 01:02:20,068
I just wanted to know how to recover the presentation.

782
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:23,678
Yes, I'm full, I blender me all the way through.

783
01:02:23,693 --> 01:02:27,178
I trust you, Bridget. You must do well. Do you understand?

784
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:31,313
100 percent. You can count on me. - Beautiful.

785
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:40,365
Is it going well? - Yes.

786
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:44,936
Big party. I'm glad to see you both again.

787
01:02:44,951 --> 01:02:47,574
We also Gianni. - Great news, huh?

788
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:48,599
Cheers.

789
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,255
I thought of Jack. If it's a boy, named after my grandfather.

790
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,759
It's a good strong name. You can trust Jack.

791
01:02:57,862 --> 01:03:00,085
Yes, one for the list.

792
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,989
Op Jack.

793
01:03:04,434 --> 01:03:06,046
So this is dad, I suppose.

794
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:09,757
Glad you're here. It is a unique and wonderful moment.

795
01:03:09,773 --> 01:03:14,356
Dr. Rawlings, I wonder if you can give me a little favor.

796
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:20,189
So this is dad, I suppose. Nice to meet you.

797
01:03:20,332 --> 01:03:26,520
Glad you could be there. This is a unique and wonderful moment.

798
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:30,567
Before we begin, you want to know the sex? - We should be prepared.

799
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,499
I do not know. - It is a boy.

800
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:36,093
A boy. - Our boy.

801
01:03:38,098 --> 01:03:39,670
My boy.

802
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:46,754
Okay, now I really need to tell them. Start with Jack.

803
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:51,600
Invited him for the big scary work presentation and will then explain.

804
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:55,201
Welcome.

805

where Adam Wollaston leads a team of Venture Rangers to the summit of Ben Nevis.

815
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:51,528
Hello, Adam Wollaston. - 'Hard News' sucks.

816
01:04:54,254 --> 01:04:56,437
Jezus.
- O jee.

817
01:04:56,453 --> 01:04:59,858
Let's news story but quickly behind us.

818

Technische storing.

819
01:05:13,127 --> 01:05:17,989
It's obviously never been easier to email or text the show.

820
01:05:18,020 --> 01:05:23,761
You only have to look at "Hard News" or simply H.

821
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:25,105
Because...

822
01:05:28,555 --> 01:05:31,173
Damn. What's he doing here?

823
01:05:31,189 --> 01:05:35,751
Because we believe in 'Hard News' ...

824
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,585
We believe we are ready and ahead ...

825
01:05:41,601 --> 01:05:45,816
by asking the questions that the world wants to answer.

826
01:05:52,576 --> 01:05:53,600
Turn around.

827
01:06:05,091 --> 01:06:09,289
Thank you.
 Okay. Career collapsed.

828
01:06:09,313 --> 01:06:13,960
Both men in the same room. What can go wrong there now?

829
01:06:17,837 --> 01:06:20,566
I hope you do not mind me suddenly stand before you.

830
01:06:20,739 --> 01:06:23,631
No. - Well done. It was bad...

831
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:27,886
Yes. - Technically skilled.

832
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:32,752
Mark, I want you to meet ...

833
01:06:40,356 --> 01:06:44,876
Sithrnthnthn Ariartr.

834
01:06:44,896 --> 01:06:51,003
Arirenata's regional manager in DTC Technological Solutions.

835
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:53,866
Or not, Ari Sinatra?

836
01:06:57,383 --> 01:06:58,984
Hoi. - Hello.

837
01:07:02,248 --> 01:07:05,656
What was it doing? What did you think?

838
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,134
I have four voicemails David Cartwright I do not dare to listen.

839
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,912
I'll be right back. - You call that a presentation?

840
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:14,792
I doubt whether I have the right people around me because you are not ...

841
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,322
I'm sorry, Alice. - Sorry is not good enough.

842
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:22,263
Excuse me. Look at me when I talk to you. - I'm sorry, but I ...

843
01:07:23,696 --> 01:07:24,696
What?

844
01:07:25,789 --> 01:07:28,651
Bridget, I want you to meet Jack Qwant. He's pretty special.

845
01:07:28,666 --> 01:07:32,209
I read a profile of him in The New Yorker. " - Okay, yeah.

846
01:07:32,225 --> 01:07:34,875
We know each other -. Yes, we certainly do.

847
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:37,100
Well done. - Why have not you introduced him?

848
01:07:37,116 --> 01:07:40,473
He's brilliant. He represents the punk rock band that is delivered.

849
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:43,111
That's right. - Yes. I knew well.

850
01:07:43,135 --> 01:07:46,533
Hi, we have been too fleeting acquaintance.

851
01:07:46,556 --> 01:07:49,245
I lead the data management for most of Daventry.

852
01:07:52,306 --> 01:07:57,501
Fantastic that you get on so well together because you have a lot in common.

853
01:07:57,685 --> 01:08:03,679
we will find a quieter place? - Yes, why not. I booked at Gianni.

854
01:08:03,695 --> 01:08:06,075
Beautiful. - That sounds good.

855
01:08:07,895 --> 01:08:13,045
I think this must serve, Arinuth. Sorry.

856
01:08:19,088 --> 01:08:23,398
Do you really think math is ... how you described it in your book?

857
01:08:23,412 --> 01:08:26,543
helps to analyze behavior which was first hidden from scientists?

858
01:08:26,559 --> 01:08:31,424
My dating algorithm helps people to find their love, not to replace them.

859
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:36,208
Oh no, it's a great idea. - Have you ever tried?

860
01:08:37,879 --> 01:08:43,178
You're single? - Yes, I think so.

861
01:08:44,234 --> 01:08:46,303
How did you meet?

862
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:53,957
Yes. - It is...

863
01:08:55,366 --> 01:08:59,064
It's a funny story.

864
01:09:02,642 --> 01:09:08,053
A few months ago, on the fourth of the month, I met Jack at a music festival.

865
01:09:08,074 --> 01:09:09,074
Okay.

866
01:09:09,093 --> 01:09:15,268
And we got on well and had some sort of relationship.

867
01:09:15,293 --> 01:09:21,721
And next week, on the eleventh of the month at the baptism of Judes baby to be exact ...

868
01:09:21,745 --> 01:09:27,684
after we had quite had consumed some alcohol Mark and I the same type of relationship.

869
01:09:28,383 --> 01:09:34,311
And this is the funny part, I think. These relationships ...

870
01:09:34,334 --> 01:09:40,095
the resulting life can in my belly you're both.

871
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:55,775
I know I should have told it before but I have simply not done.

872
01:09:58,145 --> 01:09:59,855
You both looked so happy.

873
01:10:00,178 --> 01:10:04,073
Correct me if I'm wrong, but did you just say it may be the baby of both of us?

874
01:10:07,533 --> 01:10:11,726
So you have no idea who our father is?

875
01:10:15,318 --> 01:10:20,411
I know, it's all very confusing. Sorry.

876
01:10:22,857 --> 01:10:28,065
So how do we choose to do this ...

877
01:10:30,695 --> 01:10:34,319
the most important at this time is this.

878
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:40,648
Bridget, I'm not just pretend it's not a shock.

879
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:46,075
I want you to know that you're right despite the circumstances.

880
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,412
The baby is the most important.

881
01:10:50,641 --> 01:10:53,176
Who knows, this could be a great adventure.

882
01:10:53,646 --> 01:10:57,101
I'm afraid I have to go. I have a meeting.

883
01:11:02,155 --> 01:11:04,574
Sorry. - Mark ...

884
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:14,736
Gianni, we can get the bill? - Subito.

885
01:11:23,382 --> 01:11:25,300
And if I thought that was awkward ...

886
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:29,315
how would receive the news is on mom's election campaign for city council?

887
01:11:29,481 --> 01:11:32,624
We are half an hour ago already begun. Where were you?

888
01:11:32,648 --> 01:11:36,552
You said it was an emergency. "The Gazette" want to make a family portrait.

889
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:37,657
What are you wearing?

890
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,917
Oh my God. Bridget, you are ... - Yes.

891
01:11:44,513 --> 01:11:49,382
Why did not you tell? - I did not mean to upset you.

892
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:54,278
Why would that happen? Oh no, Bridget. Who is the father?

893
01:11:54,487 --> 01:11:59,176
It's not Mark? Oh, say he is. - There is a probability of at least 50 percent.

894
01:11:59,192 --> 01:12:03,151
A 50 percent chance? - Mark of the really nice American named Jack.

895
01:12:03,175 --> 01:12:07,453
No, Bridget. An American? Did you have a threesome?

896
01:12:07,726 --> 01:12:09,321
Ms Jones.

897
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:15,899
Here, take this and pretend all is well. - Everything is good.

898
01:12:15,930 --> 01:12:20,924
Ms. Jones, we can ... - This is a nice place for you.

899
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:28,225
Are you ashamed of me? - No honey. It's just the circumstances.

900
01:12:28,241 --> 01:12:30,695
I struggle with a high function.

901
01:12:31,596 --> 01:12:35,275
If you like vote Pamela Jones family values. Bye.

902
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:38,437
It is not the fifties.

903
01:12:38,651 --> 01:12:43,578
Look around you. The two lesbians from number 32 just adopted.

904
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:48,370
If you look at things does not change you lose your valuable election ...

905
01:12:48,786 --> 01:12:50,527
and maybe your daughter.

906
01:12:52,971 --> 01:12:55,707
Bridget, how nice to see you.

907
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:58,195
Are you...? - Yes indeed.

908
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,726
How beautiful. We thought you had grown back thick.

909
01:13:05,943 --> 01:13:11,157
I am now the Mary Magdalene of Central England. I have Mom and Mark Darcy estranged from me.

910
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:15,441
I'm like a tropical insect that catches men to conceive and then eat them.

911
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:20,319
The question is: Mark will show up and participate in this polyamorous family?

912
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:33,020
The first pregnancy course.

913
01:13:33,753 --> 01:13:36,011
Spannend, summer? - Ja.

914
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:39,611
You look great.

915
01:13:46,195 --> 01:13:47,931
Hello.

916
01:13:48,943 --> 01:13:52,217
So glad you came. - Yes I agree.

917
01:13:52,403 --> 01:13:55,776
I took tasty tea. - Thank you.

918
01:13:57,951 --> 01:14:02,693
Great to see you, dude. But there is hell of a lot of caffeine in tea.

919
01:14:02,703 --> 01:14:06,426
I brought you juice.

920
01:14:07,535 --> 01:14:12,194
Thank you. Shall we go inside?

921
01:14:12,196 --> 01:14:14,585
Why not? - Certainly. I will carry you.

922
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:17,777
Thank you. - Can I carry your phone?

923
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:23,159
Dank je.

924
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:26,119
And who are you?

925
01:14:26,243 --> 01:14:30,867
I'm Bridget and this is Jack ...

926
01:14:30,995 --> 01:14:34,370
and this is Mark.

927
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:41,513
What single. You are today our second set of the same sex.

928
01:14:44,287 --> 01:14:47,471
No, actually we're ... - Absolutely.

929
01:14:47,473 --> 01:14:51,281
The baby gift will make us feel complete.

930
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:54,923
You are then the surrogate mother? - Indeed yes.

931
01:14:54,925 --> 01:14:58,203
I help this great bunch to come out of their dream.

932
01:14:58,205 --> 01:15:02,768
Mark is here very nervous about it. Completely new to you, anyway, lamb chop?

933
01:15:05,327 --> 01:15:08,867
Like all dreamers, we are on the road obstacles.

934
01:15:08,995 --> 01:15:13,294
How do you like your placenta? - Quickly.

935
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,238
Are you okay? Are you sure?

936
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:44,414
And of course can have many benefits massage during our pregnancy.

937
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:48,479
Can we mention a few? - It relieves stress and gives good hormones.

938
01:15:48,481 --> 01:15:51,028
And should be avoided in one risky pregnancy ...

939
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:53,183
For example, if there is a geriatric mother.

940
01:15:53,203 --> 01:15:56,414
Right, great, someone has delved into it.

941
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:59,750
Do you want to continue? - No, I have let Jack go.

942
01:15:59,752 --> 01:16:02,435
I think he 's will survive. - That's sweet of you.

943
01:16:02,437 --> 01:16:04,653
That's why I love you, my little teacup.

944
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:10,367
What if we ask the right questions and apply the law of mathematics ...

945
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:13,495
so the science of courtship can be determined?

946
01:16:17,117 --> 01:16:19,191
Are you compatible?

947
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:38,495
Yippee. It is a match.

948
01:17:09,827 --> 01:17:13,151
Can I request an appeal ...

949
01:17:13,153 --> 01:17:17,480
in the case of Her Majesty's Government and Saddiq Al Bashir.

950
01:17:18,035 --> 01:17:21,144
As Your Honour may know, Mr. Al Bashir has lost.

951
01:17:21,164 --> 01:17:25,400
So everything's okay? - Yes, it is this combination ...

952
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:29,743
pickles, anchovies, banana and Pringles.

953
01:17:30,203 --> 01:17:33,429
So it's really ... - It's air.

954
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:41,411
Right, so, in the future regular Pringles, not hot, spicy barbecue?

955
01:17:41,413 --> 01:17:44,632
Or maybe no Pringles. Try that.

956
01:17:47,979 --> 01:17:51,539
Is everything alright? Bridget is in order? - Yes, everything is fine.

957
01:17:52,103 --> 01:17:57,603
She's in there with ... That's Dr. Pringle. He tests her blood. This is interesting.

958
01:17:57,605 --> 01:18:01,457
It is a new technique of Oslo we tested. That's Norwegian.

959
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:05,237
It does not matter. I know about Jack. - Thank God. Why did not you say?

960
01:18:05,355 --> 01:18:08,147
It's okay. He has her completely reassured.

961
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:11,703
I'm sorry, I got your messages. I was in court.

962
01:18:14,979 --> 01:18:18,458
Hi. It does not matter. There you can put anything.

963
01:18:22,311 --> 01:18:25,395
Which you need to include. It may be your job.

964
01:18:28,355 --> 01:18:31,855
No worries. I help her. - Yes, I can see that.

965
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:37,777
Okay, you need to relax. We must do this together.

966
01:18:37,855 --> 01:18:42,960
In Peru at the "Um Bat Do ', fatherhood is a shared responsibility among many tribal members.

967
01:18:42,962 --> 01:18:46,111
Unfortunately, we do not live in Peru. I live in Ealing.

968
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:50,952
Negative energy is so bad for the baby.

969
01:18:53,227 --> 01:18:57,778
Stop. You both. This is not a competition.

970
01:19:00,147 --> 01:19:04,926
She's right. We must let this toxic energy from the room.

971
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:14,855
It will only take a moment.

972
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:32,468
What is it? Come on, buddy. Why are you so angry?

973
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:35,687
You know what? I'm not your buddy.

974
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:39,315
I know nothing about vibes or negative energy or prenatal flatulence ...

975
01:19:39,317 --> 01:19:41,000
and even less about algorithms ...

976
01:19:41,002 --> 01:19:44,349
so I will confess that the laws of attraction are a mystery to me.

977
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:47,271
In fact, Bridget defies understanding in general.

978
01:19:47,395 --> 01:19:50,479
Despite, or perhaps because of the appalling litany of disasters ...

979
01:19:50,603 --> 01:19:53,867
I've seen the last 40 years, I know Bridget pretty good ...

980
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:55,890
and all these years I have a lot to give her.

981
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:59,109
That can defy automated reasoning, but I can not help it.

982
01:19:59,129 --> 01:20:00,303
Nothing you can do about it?

983
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,587
You could stay close rather than to save the world with your mobile.

984
01:20:03,607 --> 01:20:04,918
I make her happy, Mark.

985
01:20:04,938 --> 01:20:08,102
I suppose your algorithm predicts that you are destined.

986
01:20:08,122 --> 01:20:13,083
Indeed. The fact that you "tried t decade and failed, tells me that you're not.

987
01:20:13,647 --> 01:20:15,811
No ... - I will not argue with you.

988
01:20:19,103 --> 01:20:20,941
We must think of Bridget and the baby.

989
01:20:20,943 --> 01:20:23,639
In sickness and in health, fate brought us together.

990
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:27,147
It was no accident, it were condoms. - How do you mean?

991
01:20:27,271 --> 01:20:30,519
That ridiculous dolphin friendly stuff from the bottom of Bridget's bag.

992
01:20:31,647 --> 01:20:35,387
Sorry, I have no idea what you're talking about. When Bridget and I did it, I was ...

993
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:38,224
I was not dressed for the occasion.

994
01:21:21,187 --> 01:21:23,147
None Mark today? - No.

995
01:21:28,935 --> 01:21:32,502
We should thank one person who was willing to fight for us ...

996
01:21:32,504 --> 01:21:35,413
when no one else did, and we say to those ...

997
01:21:35,771 --> 01:21:37,147
with all our hearts ... "

998
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:43,979
"Freedom of expression!"

999
01:21:46,855 --> 01:21:49,227
Bridget, we are back in the air.

1000
01:21:50,771 --> 01:21:54,395
I still can not believe Mark has gone away.

1001
01:21:54,519 --> 01:21:56,435
It's not really his fault.

1002
01:21:56,563 --> 01:22:01,853
Let's just hope it's Jack, right?

1003
01:22:02,311 --> 01:22:07,380
Be honest, it could be worse. He's damn good.

1004
01:22:07,382 --> 01:22:10,771
He's richer than God and his doll has a pleasant size.

1005
01:22:10,895 --> 01:22:15,647
That's right, and on paper we are very similar.

1006
01:22:16,435 --> 01:22:20,013
But how do you know? - You just have to have confidence in it.

1007
01:22:20,015 --> 01:22:25,185
You just have to ask yourself: 'Do I see myself to be old ...

1008
01:22:25,187 --> 01:22:29,126
with him and not with Mark Darcy? "

1009
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:34,718
There it is. Here we go.

1010
01:22:44,271 --> 01:22:47,311
The first few months, they see only black and white.

1011
01:22:47,435 --> 01:22:50,187
This will contribute to the promotion of spatial awareness.

1012
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:52,271
Or early onset of motion sickness.

1013
01:22:53,895 --> 01:22:57,437
I bought this for him. A bouncer.

1014
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,935
Only no idea where we are going drop.

1015
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:09,114
In that respect it ... here is quite tight, do not you think?

1016
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:13,328
It's homey.

1017
01:23:15,237 --> 01:23:20,885
I've been thinking. It would be nice if we moved in together.

1018
01:23:21,063 --> 01:23:23,407
Do you think we are ready?

1019
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:27,860
I'm just tired of living in hotel rooms and airplane lounges.

1020
01:23:28,395 --> 01:23:33,296
We could be a family. I, you and him.

1021
01:23:34,395 --> 01:23:36,121
What do you think about it?

1022
01:23:41,395 --> 01:23:44,435
What if it's not yours? - What?

1023
01:23:44,563 --> 01:23:47,019
What if it turns out that the baby of Mark?

1024
01:23:52,435 --> 01:23:55,116
Well, that will certainly change some things.

1025
01:23:59,979 --> 01:24:02,741
Is that what you want? That is Mark?

1026
01:24:08,603 --> 01:24:10,311
Are you in love with him?

1027
01:24:13,771 --> 01:24:18,076
That I've been in the past.

1028
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,103
And me?

1029
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:26,754
That might, some day.

1030
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:39,068
Bridget, I'm not completely honest with you.

1031
01:24:40,103 --> 01:24:43,914
Mark thinks the baby is not his, and I let him believe it's mine.

1032
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:46,811
That's why he's gone.

1033
01:24:50,687 --> 01:24:53,435
Why would he think that? - Because I took care of that.

1034
01:24:53,563 --> 01:24:55,603
Because I wanted you for myself.

1035
01:24:59,103 --> 01:25:01,227
We could be so good for each other.

1036
01:25:03,435 --> 01:25:09,535
97 percent. - On paper.

1037
01:25:10,227 --> 01:25:13,033
But love does not happen on paper.

1038
01:25:14,519 --> 01:25:19,578
Sometimes you love someone because he is not the same as you.

1039
01:25:22,895 --> 01:25:26,603
And sometimes you love someone because it feels like home.

1040
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:32,727
I have to find Mark.

1041
01:25:39,271 --> 01:25:44,331
Hello, Pierce. Bridget, I'm trying to get Mark.

1042
01:25:44,333 --> 01:25:47,895
He has just returned from a trip, Bridget. He's on his way home.

1043
01:26:22,311 --> 01:26:23,983
Hoi.

1044
01:27:07,687 --> 01:27:11,102
To go about eight weeks.

1045
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:19,278
You do not really need them.

1046
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:22,845
They are only good places for car seats, then they are only in the way.

1047
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,174
You're quite capable of doing this on your own.

1048
01:27:29,103 --> 01:27:30,933
I succeeded.

1049
01:27:37,672 --> 01:27:41,494
Weight: What does that matter? Calories: 3,100. Mainly potatoes.

1050
01:27:41,496 --> 01:27:46,004
Alcohol: 0. Torture. But going only four weeks.

1051
01:27:49,835 --> 01:27:55,662
You know what? I can do this on my own. We can do this together.

1052
01:27:56,047 --> 01:28:00,419
One of the advantages of being pregnant is not your spinster need to feel more.

1053
01:28:00,547 --> 01:28:03,255
Because of that little miracle that grows within you.

1054
01:28:03,379 --> 01:28:06,107
Hello.

1055
01:28:08,171 --> 01:28:11,463
Your mother is organizing a Christmas party as a political race.

1056
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:16,702
It's like the G8 summit with Scotch eggs. Be brave. Go inside.

1057
01:28:17,671 --> 01:28:19,379
Hello Sweetie. - Hey.

1058
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:23,211
Sorry, I did not think anyone would be. I'll go upstairs.

1059
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:29,542
No, nonsense. Una has once again let print all posters.

1060
01:28:31,465 --> 01:28:33,780
You have inspired me. - Still so long.

1061
01:28:33,782 --> 01:28:36,304
However, you were right.

1062
01:28:36,306 --> 01:28:40,671
This place is full of single mothers, single fathers, bisexuals, surrogates.

1063
01:28:40,795 --> 01:28:42,879
And they are all so sweet and so normal.

1064
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:46,865
I even have two gay men in the team. - No, thank you.

1065
01:28:46,867 --> 01:28:48,879
Who would have expected now? - Everybody.

1066
01:28:50,503 --> 01:28:52,671
I'm so proud of you, honey. Do you know?

1067
01:28:53,171 --> 01:28:56,623
What you do is not easy, but if anyone can it's you.

1068
01:28:57,379 --> 01:29:01,221
That child is the happiest guy on earth to have you as his mother.

1069
01:29:01,547 --> 01:29:05,316
He will have the love of millions father at his side.

1070
01:29:06,711 --> 01:29:09,623
Come on. We need to go campaigning.

1071
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:13,218
Out of the way. A single mother is coming.

1072
01:29:14,963 --> 01:29:20,674
Laura, Josh. We must give six minutes to General Lu Tong.

1073
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:24,865
It's big news. - Yes, Alice wants to do the interview.

1074
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:28,087
She has a heading "end of the world on Tuesday?"

1075
01:29:28,211 --> 01:29:31,795
That could be good if we lose Lu Tong. Lu Tong continues.

1076
01:29:31,919 --> 01:29:34,047
Six minutes. We go for it.

1077
01:29:35,463 --> 01:29:40,281
General Lu Tong, hello. Sorry that this is so chaotic today.

1078
01:29:40,711 --> 01:29:44,087
Thank you for coming. In two minutes we go live.

1079
01:29:44,211 --> 01:29:48,835
Miranda would probably start with what is happening in Naypyidaw.

1080
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:51,700
On three. - Miranda, back to General Lu Tong.

1081
01:29:51,702 --> 01:29:55,738
Keep asking questions. - I'm asking you again, General Lu Tong ...

1082
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:58,711
take responsibility for the violation of human rights ...

1083
01:29:58,835 --> 01:30:00,671
performed by your own government?

1084
01:30:00,673 --> 01:30:04,205
He is on the rack. Shows which sweat.

1085
01:30:04,207 --> 01:30:07,503
Focus, four. - I'm sorry, I can not answer that.

1086
01:30:07,627 --> 01:30:12,480
Can, or would you not, General Lu Tong?

1087
01:30:12,482 --> 01:30:18,127
On balance, I recommend "can not", given General Lu Tong I've found in the lobby ...

1088
01:30:18,129 --> 01:30:23,402
and his driver is live and answer questions about Far Eastern geopolitics.

1089
01:30:23,404 --> 01:30:27,095
Not? Any comments you want to make on the use of sexual torture ...

1090
01:30:27,097 --> 01:30:28,454
by your own troops?

1091
01:30:29,547 --> 01:30:33,990
Ask him about the traffic in London. - The traffic in London, General Lu Tong?

1092
01:30:33,992 --> 01:30:38,009
Do you have anything to say about it? No comment. Unbelievable.

1093
01:30:38,295 --> 01:30:42,292
That's what General Lu Tong concerns. See you after the break.

1094
01:30:42,294 --> 01:30:43,685
Well done.

1095
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:49,211
Unfortunately, you leave me no choice.

1096
01:30:49,335 --> 01:30:52,881
It is actually illegal to fire someone who is pregnant.

1097
01:30:52,883 --> 01:30:55,924
Therefore, I do not absolve her. I push her through gross incompetence.

1098
01:30:55,926 --> 01:31:00,099
Bridget is the beating heart of this show. Why would you want to fire her?

1099
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:02,948
How about 't interviewing one driver?

1100
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:07,194
Using define a television interview or a guest might be the father of her child ...

1101
01:31:07,196 --> 01:31:11,679
and responsible for the transmission of six nude butts?

1102
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,726
It does not matter. It really does not, Richard.

1103
01:31:21,255 --> 01:31:24,909
I wanted to quit anyway. Probably.

1104
01:31:25,419 --> 01:31:29,755
Believe it or not, I was just like you when I started here.

1105
01:31:29,879 --> 01:31:35,159
Some firmer and much less makeup, but I would also leave my mark.

1106
01:31:35,379 --> 01:31:37,835
But I want no part of your development.

1107
01:31:37,963 --> 01:31:42,120
I have anyway not the right hairstyle and do not drink cocktails in jars ...

1108
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:44,444
or post pictures of my lunch on Instagram.

1109
01:31:44,446 --> 01:31:49,347
I think it is not modern to want to make something that is worthwhile.

1110
01:31:49,367 --> 01:31:53,738
But I would rather be old and unemployed ...

1111
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,694
then be part of a show that is meaningless.

1112
01:31:56,963 --> 01:32:02,565
Maybe when my son is old enough, integrity will be popular again.

1113
01:32:30,547 --> 01:32:32,127
What have I done?

1114
01:32:46,919 --> 01:32:52,108
It is good to fight for your principles if there is no food in the fridge.

1115
01:32:56,879 --> 01:33:00,756
How hard can it be to find another job ...

1116
01:33:00,758 --> 01:33:04,157
if you are just fired and nine months pregnant?

1117
01:33:04,335 --> 01:33:09,329
What is going to happen, I'll buy you the damn Bugaboos.

1118
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:14,406
Birthday?

1119
01:33:16,255 --> 01:33:18,919
God, my brains are to perish.

1120
01:33:19,503 --> 01:33:20,919
First nummertje?

1121
01:33:24,568 --> 01:33:26,454
Welcomes card. Please contact your bank.

1122
01:33:26,474 --> 01:33:27,546
Nee.

1123
01:33:29,879 --> 01:33:31,574
Damn.

1124
01:33:36,295 --> 01:33:37,919
I'm so sorry.

1125
01:33:40,671 --> 01:33:46,443
Everything is suddenly against. Right.

1126
01:33:56,087 --> 01:33:58,379
Nee, nee.

1127
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:38,595
Okay, new pre-birth planning.

1128
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:43,387
I, Bridget Jones, best mother will be in the world.

1129
01:35:44,263 --> 01:35:46,555
I will try to remember you in a store ...

1130
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:51,555
or you stop a machine like that woman did with her cat.

1131
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:56,829
I know I promised I'd have before you would arrive everything in order.

1132
01:35:57,011 --> 01:36:02,547
But the truth is, I did not, but we can do this together ...

1133
01:36:03,219 --> 01:36:07,064
because fairy tale princes no longer exist.

1134
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:11,753
Or is it?

1135
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,366
Hoi.

1136
01:36:29,511 --> 01:36:33,900
Bridget. Jesus, what are you doing? You're all wet.

1137
01:36:33,902 --> 01:36:38,011
Yes, I've locked myself out, and I leave my bag ...

1138
01:36:38,013 --> 01:36:43,342
I forgot my keys, phone, my mind.

1139
01:36:44,303 --> 01:36:46,219
What are you doing here?

1140
01:36:47,847 --> 01:36:53,932
It turns out I can always find time to save the world, but you are my world.

1141
01:37:01,263 --> 01:37:03,803
I thought you were back in Candida.

1142
01:37:04,555 --> 01:37:08,498
You know very well that they called Camilla. - Camilla.

1143
01:37:10,847 --> 01:37:15,683
I came to your house, and she was there.

1144
01:37:15,685 --> 01:37:19,020
She came to pick up her belongings. She went back to The Hague.

1145
01:37:19,219 --> 01:37:21,347
I took her to the airport.

1146
01:37:40,469 --> 01:37:41,717
Dank je.

1147
01:37:45,261 --> 01:37:46,977
Bridget...

1148
01:37:48,009 --> 01:37:50,469
You know I'm emotional statements ...

1149
01:37:51,677 --> 01:37:53,312
find difficult.

1150
01:37:55,093 --> 01:37:56,717
But the truth is ...

1151
01:38:01,925 --> 01:38:04,345
Why my legs are warm?

1152
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:10,133
My waters have broken. - Jesus.

1153
01:38:10,261 --> 01:38:12,425
Sorry. I grab a towel.

1154
01:38:12,427 --> 01:38:14,836
But you're just exhausted in two or three weeks.

1155
01:38:14,838 --> 01:38:18,633
That is a contraction. We need to get to the hospital.

1156
01:38:18,761 --> 01:38:21,043
Sure. - Let's get your car.

1157
01:38:21,045 --> 01:38:23,845
I came by taxi. - Damn.

1158
01:38:23,847 --> 01:38:26,885
How I should have know? - No, not you. Contractions.

1159
01:38:26,887 --> 01:38:31,203
No, we take your car. - It can not. The keys are in my bag.

1160
01:38:33,261 --> 01:38:37,385
Five, six, seven, eight ... - Puffing, breathing and counting.

1161
01:38:37,387 --> 01:38:39,969
... Nine, ten. - I hear you doing it?

1162
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:50,009
Which you need to include. It can be the work.

1163
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:56,586
No do not do that. - Hey, what the hell is that?

1164
01:38:57,133 --> 01:39:01,218
That's very sweet, but we have to call a taxi.

1165
01:39:03,009 --> 01:39:04,677
Right, what do we do?

1166
01:39:07,261 --> 01:39:09,177
I'll think of something.

1167
01:39:13,385 --> 01:39:15,425
Watch out. - Out of the way.

1168
01:39:16,885 --> 01:39:20,053
We go to the hospital. We're going to make a baby.

1169
01:39:23,177 --> 01:39:24,882
Let's go.

1170
01:39:24,884 --> 01:39:29,890
God, this is ... It's really happening.

1171
01:39:30,845 --> 01:39:34,425
I'm going to become a mother. Maybe I'm too old for this.

1172
01:39:34,553 --> 01:39:36,925
Wait, wait. Why do you stop?

1173
01:39:37,425 --> 01:39:40,345
A margarita with onion and pineapple. Number 17, thank you.

1174
01:39:40,347 --> 01:39:41,956
What?

1175
01:39:51,761 --> 01:39:55,916
Who is eating onion with pineapple, huh? Some people do not track, right?

1176
01:39:57,969 --> 01:40:03,129
Yes. Okay. Here we go.

1177
01:40:05,761 --> 01:40:08,177
Do not worry, Ms. Bridget. We ensure that you get there.

1178
01:40:08,301 --> 01:40:11,133
Around this time there is no traffic. It's okay, right?

1179
01:40:11,261 --> 01:40:13,425
Vagina. Power to the vagina.

1180
01:40:13,553 --> 01:40:18,956
My God. Unbelieveable. A protest for women's rights.

1181
01:40:19,385 --> 01:40:23,638
Jesus, not now. - These are the women I defended.

1182
01:40:24,301 --> 01:40:26,352
That diabolical Russians. Hold my hand firmly.

1183
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:29,208
We really have got to get there. We need to get there.

1184
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:34,228
Well, we're going out. Ready? - No, I think not a good idea.

1185
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,761
Nee, Bridget... Bridget.

1186
01:40:36,553 --> 01:40:40,917
Call Jack. - I'll be chasing you with the bags, Mr. Mark.

1187
01:40:41,217 --> 01:40:42,469
And I call Mr. Jack.

1188
01:40:42,471 --> 01:40:46,071
It's all right, Bridget. We'll find something. - I can not walk I think.

1189
01:40:46,969 --> 01:40:49,009
That does not matter. I'll carry you.

1190
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:16,597
Good God, Bridget. You're huge. - I can not help it.

1191
01:41:17,801 --> 01:41:21,559
I think my lungs have exploded, but that's not important.

1192
01:41:21,561 --> 01:41:23,345
My contractions start again.

1193
01:41:23,347 --> 01:41:26,425
I'm going to have the baby on the street. - I have an idea.

1194
01:41:26,427 --> 01:41:30,976
We rest ten count and walk ten count, right? - Okay.

1195
01:41:47,177 --> 01:41:51,196
It's not far. - No.

1196
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:55,570
I still think 2.4 kilometers. - I do not believe...

1197
01:41:55,885 --> 01:41:58,301
Are you okay?

1198
01:41:59,469 --> 01:42:02,836
It's better if I do not talk much. - Yes.

1199
01:42:06,885 --> 01:42:11,889
Okay, I'm here. I can take it now.

1200
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:16,780
I got you. - Thank you.

1201
01:42:19,677 --> 01:42:22,931
Jesus.

1202
01:42:24,425 --> 01:42:27,593
You must do this with two men. - I'm here.

1203
01:42:27,595 --> 01:42:29,677
Get her. - I got her.

1204
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:31,717
Jesus. Do not drop it.

1205
01:42:38,717 --> 01:42:40,677
Just inside. - This way?

1206
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:42,633
Yes, there. - No, this way.

1207
01:42:43,593 --> 01:42:45,425
Okay, but wring.

1208
01:42:45,553 --> 01:42:47,261
Are you succeeding? - Get her.

1209
01:42:47,263 --> 01:42:49,009
Pressures. - I press already.

1210
01:42:49,133 --> 01:42:50,628
Push.

1211
01:42:52,509 --> 01:42:54,301
Closer.

1212
01:42:54,425 --> 01:42:56,203
No, not a problem.

1213
01:42:59,009 --> 01:43:01,553
We're out. - Sister.

1214
01:43:01,677 --> 01:43:03,593
Carol wheelchair.

1215
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:08,825
One two Three. - Yes, here. Thank you.

1216
01:43:11,261 --> 01:43:12,870
Is everything alright?

1217
01:43:14,345 --> 01:43:16,261
Who of you is the father? - I.

1218
01:43:16,385 --> 01:43:18,200
Right.

1219
01:43:23,177 --> 01:43:24,593
Breathe out the pain.

1220
01:43:26,177 --> 01:43:27,548
Beautiful. - Hey.

1221
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:30,713
I wondered how many fathers we would get. A full house. Bingo.

1222
01:43:31,469 --> 01:43:33,553
Bridget, how do you do this? Painkiller?

1223
01:43:33,555 --> 01:43:38,006
No, you can. A positive mental attitude is stronger than a drug.

1224
01:43:38,008 --> 01:43:41,746
Good? Think of the pain away. - Nonsense. No, I want everything.

1225
01:43:41,885 --> 01:43:45,384
Gas, air, injections, morphine.

1226
01:43:45,386 --> 01:43:48,950
Bridget, remember your yoga. - To hell with yoga.

1227
01:43:49,053 --> 01:43:50,677
I totally agree.

1228
01:43:50,679 --> 01:43:52,061
It's supposed to be relaxing ...

1229
01:43:52,063 --> 01:43:55,864
but I'm busy all the time to tighten my sphincter so I will not fart.

1230
01:43:56,385 --> 01:43:59,570
Can you turn around? I need to check your cervix.

1231
01:44:02,177 --> 01:44:05,717
You're doing very well. If so. Turn quietly to me.

1232
01:44:06,301 --> 01:44:07,717
Just a little research.

1233
01:44:08,469 --> 01:44:11,261
Okay, ready? Research ... starts now.

1234
01:44:14,469 --> 01:44:17,466
Yes. Nice nice. You already eight centimeters.

1235
01:44:17,468 --> 01:44:19,862
That is beautiful. You can now no medication.

1236
01:44:19,864 --> 01:44:22,108
What? - You have too much access.

1237
01:44:22,425 --> 01:44:24,959
Well done. Here comes another contraction.

1238
01:44:26,133 --> 01:44:30,717
I'm not sure what you have in mind to watch from here.

1239
01:44:30,845 --> 01:44:34,149
My ex-husband said it looked like burned his favorite pub.

1240
01:44:34,177 --> 01:44:35,841
Your choice.

1241
01:44:37,761 --> 01:44:41,517
Maybe Dad can take a damp cloth for Mom.

1242
01:44:45,053 --> 01:44:46,301
I know.

1243
01:44:47,677 --> 01:44:53,944
It's okay. You can do this. Think of the pain away.

1244
01:44:54,593 --> 01:44:56,717
Asshole.

1245
01:44:56,845 --> 01:45:00,807
just think the pain away. - Get out, both of you.

1246
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:03,801
Where are you going?

1247
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:10,009
I've changed my mind.

1248
01:45:10,133 --> 01:45:13,133
I've changed my mind.

1249
01:46:08,553 --> 01:46:10,367
You can do this.

1250
01:46:12,385 --> 01:46:14,093
You can do it. We do this together.

1251
01:46:14,217 --> 01:46:17,009
Remember what life has brought so far.

1252
01:46:20,761 --> 01:46:23,133
You've turned into catastrophes triumphs ...

1253
01:46:23,135 --> 01:46:28,060
with your pure, joyful, indefatigable, contagious zest for life.

1254
01:46:28,062 --> 01:46:31,040
You have this pregnancy almost accomplished on your own ...

1255
01:46:31,042 --> 01:46:36,738
despite one insane mother, oppressed women and cheating boyfriends who do not deserve you.

1256
01:46:39,885 --> 01:46:41,928
Just a moment.

1257
01:46:42,133 --> 01:46:45,831
Just a moment, dear, and we see your beautiful baby.

1258
01:46:46,677 --> 01:46:51,679
What if it's not yours? - I still love him, just like yours.

1259
01:46:52,217 --> 01:46:56,548
As you were, are, and always will be.

1260
01:47:04,345 --> 01:47:07,406
I think you can get a better look at this. - Thank you.

1261
01:47:07,845 --> 01:47:09,717
I take it from talking about here.

1262
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,761
Think of the pain away.

1263
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:21,594
You pressed a very Mensje from your vagina. I want to see them do away thinking.

1264
01:47:22,633 --> 01:47:26,925
367 of the votes ...

1265
01:47:27,053 --> 01:47:31,729
the winner Pamela Margaret Jones. - Pamela, honey, it's Bridget.

1266
01:47:31,731 --> 01:47:34,117
Not now, Colin. - It's about the baby.

1267
01:47:34,119 --> 01:47:37,985
I hereby certify that Pamela Margaret Jones ...

1268
01:47:37,987 --> 01:47:41,029
I'm so sorry. You must excuse me.

1269
01:47:41,093 --> 01:47:43,301
We are about to become a grandmother.

1270
01:47:45,509 --> 01:47:50,118
So, that was it regards this special edition of "Hard News".

1271
01:47:51,133 --> 01:47:54,038
25 seconds before we go off the air. - Get ready.

1272
01:47:54,040 --> 01:47:57,383
Bridget is in labor.

1273
01:47:57,385 --> 01:48:00,824
Except even that Bridget Jones is giving birth.

1274
01:48:06,509 --> 01:48:08,217
Yes. - Drain the credits.

1275
01:48:08,219 --> 01:48:10,217
Credits. - Drain the credits.

1276
01:48:10,345 --> 01:48:13,671
I hope I'm godmother. - Allow the weather forecasts.

1277
01:48:14,717 --> 01:48:16,217
Listen I...

1278
01:48:19,845 --> 01:48:22,054
I owe you my apologies.

1279
01:48:23,261 --> 01:48:26,268
I know I have not behaved to me in all this.

1280
01:48:28,301 --> 01:48:29,914
No, it does not matter.

1281
01:48:54,846 --> 01:48:56,138
Hello.

1282
01:49:19,638 --> 01:49:22,470
Say hello to our beautiful boy.

1283
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:27,178
Go ahead. - Thank you.

1284
01:49:42,386 --> 01:49:44,138
You are.

1285
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:46,262
Is not he perfect? - Yes.

1286
01:50:07,930 --> 01:50:09,178
Hello.

1287
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:15,094
I'm sorry I'm late, Bridge.

1288
01:50:15,096 --> 01:50:17,306
Some lesbians organize a silent protest.

1289
01:50:17,308 --> 01:50:19,511
They protest for freedom of expression.

1290
01:50:19,513 --> 01:50:22,031
That's pretty important. - My God, look at him then.

1291
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:23,262
Bridge.

1292
01:50:24,222 --> 01:50:27,722
I'm so sorry that we were not here. That incredibly tedious march.

1293
01:50:27,724 --> 01:50:29,970
The march is critical ... - Can I be godfather?

1294
01:50:30,094 --> 01:50:32,514
Well, I'm counting on you.

1295
01:50:33,014 --> 01:50:34,930
Congratulations. - Well done.

1296
01:50:34,932 --> 01:50:36,568
Thank you very much. - Well done.

1297
01:50:36,570 --> 01:50:38,222
You both. - You all.

1298
01:50:38,346 --> 01:50:39,886
Where is she?

1299
01:50:39,888 --> 01:50:42,970
I am sorry that we were not on time. Dad is the car 's parking.

1300
01:50:42,972 --> 01:50:47,027
There is a march for women's rights. Really, we need more rights?

1301
01:50:48,222 --> 01:50:49,886
Mom, meet your new grandson.

1302
01:50:52,514 --> 01:50:55,346
The sweetheart. He looks exactly like ...

1303
01:50:58,970 --> 01:51:03,484
Not that it matters little, but ... we already know who the daddy is?

1304
01:51:06,138 --> 01:51:07,514
We will find out?

1305
01:51:09,722 --> 01:51:11,722
Come on, you guys. Time for a little test.

1306
01:51:12,722 --> 01:51:15,806
Exciting, do not you think? Like the final of the X Factor or something.

1307
01:51:15,808 --> 01:51:20,183
Press 01 if you want it to Mark and press 02 if you want it to Jack.

1308
01:51:34,846 --> 01:51:37,138
Success. - You too.

1309
01:51:43,806 --> 01:51:45,386
Please. - Thank you.

1310
01:51:57,953 --> 01:52:00,353
A year later...

1311
01:53:06,222 --> 01:53:08,999
You look beautiful. - Thank you.

1312
01:53:09,594 --> 01:53:12,336
Hello Sweetie. Hey.

1313
01:53:12,886 --> 01:53:14,552
Hello.

1314
01:53:24,346 --> 01:53:27,340
Hello. - Hoi.

1315
01:53:30,806 --> 01:53:34,898
We're going to really do this. - Now we can not go back.

1316
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:40,474
We are gathered here to celebrate the marriage of Bridget Jones rose ...

1317
01:53:40,970 --> 01:53:44,054
en Mark Fitzwilliam Darcy.

1318
01:53:45,806 --> 01:53:50,237
As an officer of civil status, I now pronounce you ...

1319
01:53:50,762 --> 01:53:54,491
finally, man and woman.

1320
01:54:37,470 --> 01:54:43,174
Jack, what the hell are you doing in my son? - Well, never leave me alone with him.

1321
01:54:43,176 --> 01:54:46,509
I have no idea what I'm doing. - He's traumatized?

1322
01:54:53,886 --> 01:54:58,945
Hallo, William Jones-Darcy.
Ben je klaar?

1323
01:55:01,346 --> 01:55:04,222
Some champagne for you? - Yes please.

1324
01:55:05,554 --> 01:55:10,253
Dear Diary. And so, I, Bridget Jones ...

1325
01:55:10,386 --> 01:55:14,899
am no longer alone. Married? Yes.

1326
01:55:15,178 --> 01:55:18,962
Smug? Well, it would be time, so ...

1327
01:55:19,306 --> 01:55:21,222
maybe a little.

1328
01:56:06,265 --> 01:56:09,565
Missing playboy found alive

1329
01:56:13,389 --> 01:56:17,383

1329
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:24,203
