2
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,215
(man) She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.

3
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,921
I let her hear my footsteps.

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,197
She only goes stiff for a moment.

5
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,066
Care for a smoke?

6
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,935
Sure.
I'll take one.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,638
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

8
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:52,081
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

9
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,651
I've watched you for days.

10
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,456
You're everything a man could ever want.

11
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,996
It's not just your face,

12
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:08,660
your figure, or your voice.

13
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,702
It's your eyes.

14
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,440
All the things I see in your eyes.

15
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:23,113
What is it you see in my eyes?

16
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,350
I see a crazy calm.

17
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,083
You're sick of running.

18
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:39,388
You're ready to face what you have to face.

19
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,325
But you don't want to face it alone.

20
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:45,428
No.

21
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:47,700
I don't want to face it alone.

22
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,383
The wind rises electric.

23
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,114
She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.

24
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,181
Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.

25
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:10,254
I tell her that everything will be all right.

26
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:17,001
That I'll save her from whatever
she's scared of and take her far. Far away.

27
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,342
I tell her I love her.

28
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,434
(gunshot through silencer)

29
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,243
The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.

30
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,149
I hold her close until she's gone.

31
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,689
I'll never know
what she was running from.

32
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,991
I'll cash her check in the morning.

33
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,720
(girl) Yes.

34
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,232
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

35
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:26,466
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

36
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:30,134
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

37
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,644
It should be right as rain in no time.

38
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,374
Uh-huh.

39
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,984
Mm-hm.

40
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,197
(man) Turn the right corner in Sin City

41
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,762
and you can find anything.

42
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,534
Becky.

43
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,238
Care for a smoke?

44
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,511
Love you, too, Mom.

45
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,845
(man) The night is hot as hell.

46
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:32,214
It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.

47
00:04:33,486 --> 00:04:35,886
I'm staring at a goddess.

48
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:38,389
She's telling me she wants me.

49
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:42,292
I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.

50
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:43,953
I want you.

51
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,532
She smells like angels ought to smell.

52
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,167
The perfect woman.

53
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,041
The goddess.

54
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:07,647
I need you.

55
00:05:09,989 --> 00:05:12,048
Goldie.

56
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,559
She says her name is Goldie.

57
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:26,029
Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.

58
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:29,199
And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.

59
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:33,371
And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.

60
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:36,779
You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers

61
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:39,613
aren't moving like they would
if she was breathing.

62
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:42,552
She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.

63
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:47,059
Lying next to her.
Stone drunk. Just like she was.

64
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:51,554
Damn it. Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?

65
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:54,031
Who were you
besides an angel of mercy.

66
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,433
Giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?

67
00:05:57,503 --> 00:06:00,301
It sure as hell wasn't my looks.

68
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:03,308
So why the sleazy saloon?

69
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:05,742
Why the kindness. Goldie?

70
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:07,803
(sirens blaring)

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,441
The cops - they're telling me too much.

72
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:13,417
Showing up before anybody
but me and the killer

73
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,716
could know there's been a murder.

74
00:06:15,788 --> 00:06:19,315
Somebody paid good money
for this frame.

75
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,158
No reason at all to play it quiet.

76
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:25,356
No reason to play it any way but my way.

77
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:32,930
Whoever killed you is gonna pay. Goldie.

78
00:06:37,777 --> 00:06:39,972
(man banging on door)
Open up, police!

79
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,809
I'll be right out.

80
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,449
(gunfire)

81
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,334
(sirens blaring)

82
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:13,676
I don't know why you died. Goldie.

83
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:20,851
I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight.

84
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,686
But you were a friend and more
when I needed one.

85
00:07:24,757 --> 00:07:27,453
And when I find out who did it.

86
00:07:27,526 --> 00:07:30,620
It won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.

87
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:34,393
It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.

88
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:37,436
And when his eyes go dead.
The hell I send him to

89
00:07:37,503 --> 00:07:41,098
will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.

90
00:07:41,173 --> 00:07:42,572
I love you. Goldie.

91
00:07:49,448 --> 00:07:50,813
(sirens blaring)

92
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:54,250
(helicopter overhead)

93
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,050
(sirens continue blaring)

94
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,393
(latch squeaks)

95
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,897
Claire?

96
00:08:16,275 --> 00:08:20,268
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

97
00:08:20,346 --> 00:08:25,283
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

98
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:29,481
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

99
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:31,250
No.

100
00:08:31,324 --> 00:08:33,884
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

101
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,258
Thanks.
You're the best.

102
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:38,889
Lucille's my parole officer.

103
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,160
She's a dyke. But God knows why.

104
00:08:41,233 --> 00:08:44,760
With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.

105
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:47,931
The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.

106
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:51,807
She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.

107
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:55,944
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

108
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:59,473
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

109
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:04,114
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

110
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,954
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

111
00:09:07,026 --> 00:09:10,052
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

112
00:09:10,129 --> 00:09:12,791
This isn't some barroom brawl.

113
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:16,062
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

114
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:17,727
Hey, hey.
This is big.

115
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:21,569
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

116
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,632
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

117
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,204
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

118
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,409
They're back.
There's no choices left.

119
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,282
And I'm ready for war.

120
00:09:34,353 --> 00:09:36,844
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

121
00:09:36,922 --> 00:09:38,355
Ah.

122
00:09:38,424 --> 00:09:42,485
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

123
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,624
But I'm out now.

124
00:09:45,698 --> 00:09:49,225
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

125
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:53,362
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

126
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:59,043
Now for Gladys.
Sweet Gladys.

127
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,078
But I'll have to sneak past Mom.

128
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:06,312
And her ears have gotten
a whole lot better since she went blind.

129
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:13,049
Mom still hasn't changed
a thing in this room.

130
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:18,654
Every week she dusts it all off. So it looks
like it was only yesterday that I moved out.

131
00:10:18,731 --> 00:10:21,529
Every time I come visit.
She has me sleepin' here.

132
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,933
And the old smells make me
cry like they do right now.

133
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:28,096
I knew Gladys would be safe here.

134
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:32,069
I call her Gladys
after one of the sisters from school.

135
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,476
She's almost lived up to the name.

136
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:39,678
For a while we just get the feel
of each other back. Good as ever.

137
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:42,243
I tell her about Goldie.
And what we have to do.

138
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:43,652
(creak)

139
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,485
Marvin?

140
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:48,185
Is that you, baby?

141
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,524
Yes, Mom.
I'm sorry I woke you up.

142
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:55,056
I couldn't sleep for the worry.
There were men here lookin' for you.

143
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:57,364
They weren't police.

144
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,563
It was about my job.

145
00:10:59,638 --> 00:11:04,268
I got a new job.
It's night work.

146
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:06,903
What did you do to your face?

147
00:11:06,979 --> 00:11:09,504
I cut myself shaving.

148
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:13,712
You're getting confused
again, aren't you?

149
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:18,485
Mom, I feel better
than I have in years.

150
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,359
(helicopter)

151
00:11:22,428 --> 00:11:24,828
So you were scared.
Weren't you. Goldie?

152
00:11:24,897 --> 00:11:27,559
Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.

153
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:30,397
So you hit the saloons.
The bad places.

154
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:34,769
Iooking for the biggest.
Meanest lug around and finding me.

155
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,502
Well. I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you.

156
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:40,545
And I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.

157
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,874
Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...

158
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,181
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
...and you could find anything.

159
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:50,950
That coat looks like Baghdad.

160
00:11:51,023 --> 00:11:54,584
So does your face.
Take off!

161
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,457
(yelling)

162
00:11:59,365 --> 00:12:02,459
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

163
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:04,969
Kadie's is my kind of joint.

164
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:10,708
Nancy's just getting started with her gig.
But already the crowd's breathing hard.

165
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:12,801
Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy.

166
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:16,336
Shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.

167
00:12:16,415 --> 00:12:19,282
But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.

168
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:22,582
I'm looking for something small and hairy.

169
00:12:26,692 --> 00:12:30,628
Take it easy, Weevil.
I'm here to do you a favor.

170
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:33,164
It's money in your pocket.

171
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:38,860
Spread the word. Tell 'em I've been
hitting the joints, drunk off my butt,

172
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:43,432
shooting my mouth off, cryin' over
some hot babe named Goldie.

173
00:12:57,022 --> 00:12:58,512
What'll it be, Marv?

174
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:01,492
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

175
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,223
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

176
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:23,006
(man) Most people think Marv is crazy.

177
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:26,813
He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.

178
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,319
He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield.

179
00:13:29,388 --> 00:13:31,788
Swinging an ax into somebody's face.

180
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:36,785
Or in a Roman arena
taking a sword to other gladiators like him.

181
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:40,764
They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.

182
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:46,333
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

183
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:49,306
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

184
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:57,010
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

185
00:13:57,082 --> 00:14:02,076
I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them. You don't feel bad.

186
00:14:10,095 --> 00:14:12,495
- Take it off.
- What?

187
00:14:12,564 --> 00:14:14,998
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

188
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,558
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

189
00:14:17,636 --> 00:14:21,231
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

190
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:25,767
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

191
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,109
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

192
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:34,481
I don't hear you giving me any names.

193
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:38,148
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

194
00:14:38,223 --> 00:14:39,588
(screams)

195
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:45,893
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

196
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:54,571
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

197
00:14:55,507 --> 00:14:58,567
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

198
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:02,002
Thanks again.

199
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,639
(gunshot)

200
00:15:07,286 --> 00:15:09,186
Then the damnedest thing happens.

201
00:15:09,254 --> 00:15:13,384
For a second. I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.

202
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,950
Just need my medicine. Is all.

203
00:15:16,462 --> 00:15:18,157
Bastard.

204
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,393
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

205
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:25,964
Feel like talking, Louie?

206
00:15:26,038 --> 00:15:28,529
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

207
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,370
How many for the kill?

208
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:33,036
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

209
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:37,639
He'll never talk.

210
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:43,816
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

211
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,026
Connelly talks.
They all talk.

212
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:52,226
(man) And what have been
your sins, my son?

213
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:54,857
(Marv) Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

214
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:57,993
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

215
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,062
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

216
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,267
You're speaking figuratively.

217
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:07,938
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

218
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:10,504
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

219
00:16:10,582 --> 00:16:13,779
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

220
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:19,791
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

221
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:21,223
Tortured 'em first.

222
00:16:21,293 --> 00:16:25,627
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

223
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:28,495
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

224
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,436
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

225
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:36,235
(whispering) Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

226
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:40,074
Just give me a damn name.

227
00:16:40,145 --> 00:16:43,478
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

228
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,484
feeding me garbage like that.

229
00:16:46,552 --> 00:16:47,780
It can't be that big.

230
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:50,151
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

231
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:53,157
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

232
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,193
And while you're at it,

233
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,630
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

234
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,125
Worth dying for.

235
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:05,227
Worth killing for.

236
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,670
Worth going to hell for.

237
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:09,673
Amen.

238
00:17:13,178 --> 00:17:16,113
His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes.

239
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:19,742
Or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.

240
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:23,914
Modern cars -
they all look like electric shavers.

241
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:26,617
(tires screeching)

242
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:32,156
Goldie.

243
00:17:34,867 --> 00:17:36,129
Goldie!

244
00:17:46,879 --> 00:17:49,074
It couldn't be Goldie.

245
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:53,447
It's my own fault. And nobody else's.
That I got confused.

246
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,285
I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.

247
00:17:57,356 --> 00:17:59,290
That wasn't Goldie back there.

248
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,791
Goldie's dead.

249
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:04,818
And that's the whole reason
that I've been doing what I've been doing.

250
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:08,697
When you got a condition.
It's bad to forget your medicine.

251
00:18:11,503 --> 00:18:16,998
The cold thing. It creeps into my gut
and tells me one more time it won't let go.

252
00:18:17,776 --> 00:18:20,438
This is a bad place. This farm.

253
00:18:20,512 --> 00:18:22,241
People have died here...

254
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:23,975
(growling)

255
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:25,710
...the wrong way.

256
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,411
I don't want to fight, pooch.

257
00:18:33,959 --> 00:18:36,223
I got no gripe with you.

258
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,427
Easy, boy.

259
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,628
(dog whimpers)

260
00:18:43,468 --> 00:18:46,369
No way I was gonna use
my gun on you. Buddy.

261
00:18:46,438 --> 00:18:49,168
It's whoever owns you I'm curious about.

262
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:53,302
Because there's blood on your breath.
And I think I know what kind.

263
00:18:53,812 --> 00:18:56,110
So I sniff around to see what's buried.

264
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:01,485
Here we go.

265
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:09,886
It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.

266
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:20,403
I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.

267
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:24,101
Nobody except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.

268
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,138
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

269
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:30,741
You killed Goldie.

270
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,477
It was...

271
00:19:34,052 --> 00:19:35,610
I blew it. Goldie.

272
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:38,779
I found your killer.
But he was better than me.

273
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,417
Too quiet. Too quick.

274
00:19:41,493 --> 00:19:43,984
A killer born.

275
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:46,553
Why didn't he finish the job?

276
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:03,309
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

277
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:06,749
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

278
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:11,650
The wolf just gets scraps.

279
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:13,714
Bones.

280
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,124
It's him.

281
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:20,688
He eats people.

282
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,127
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

283
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,467
Just like they were steaks.

284
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,871
Now he's got both of us.

285
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:33,172
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

286
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:36,812
Just look at the heads on the wall.

287
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,009
The heads on the wall.

288
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:41,642
The heads on the wall.

289
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,679
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

290
00:20:45,757 --> 00:20:49,887
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

291
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,694
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

292
00:20:52,764 --> 00:20:57,701
He made me watch!

293
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,576
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

294
00:21:08,313 --> 00:21:12,181
Dames.
Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.

295
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,549
And a few buckets later.
There's no way you'd know.

296
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:18,281
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

297
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:22,986
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

298
00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:25,291
Any leads?

299
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:29,094
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

300
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:34,002
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

301
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:37,701
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

302
00:21:37,776 --> 00:21:39,903
The dead one.

303
00:21:39,978 --> 00:21:42,173
Goldie.

304
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,715
I didn't know she was a hooker.

305
00:21:44,783 --> 00:21:47,946
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

306
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:54,654
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

307
00:21:54,726 --> 00:21:56,387
She must have shown you quite a time.

308
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,622
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

309
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:05,002
(man) Kevin!

310
00:22:06,004 --> 00:22:09,804
All I've got is a face... and a name.

311
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,866
I'll see you later, Kevin.

312
00:22:21,853 --> 00:22:22,979
Let's go.

313
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:41,669
They're done checking the house.

314
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,765
They're coming this way.

315
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:46,936
Bastards.
I'll show them.

316
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:56,113
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

317
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,918
No, don't shoot!
Please.

318
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,254
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

319
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:03,794
He's unconscious and unarmed,

320
00:23:03,862 --> 00:23:06,854
so there's no need to kill him.

321
00:23:13,104 --> 00:23:15,368
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

322
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,668
Here's a sign!

323
00:23:31,423 --> 00:23:35,154
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

324
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:46,396
I keep coming back to that cop I just killed
and what he told me.

325
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:49,269
I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille.

326
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:51,901
So I took my time
with that son of a bitch.

327
00:23:52,477 --> 00:23:56,243
It wasn't till I showed him
all those pieces of himself that he said it.

328
00:23:56,815 --> 00:24:01,980
Just a name -
Patrick Henry Roark. Man of the cloth.

329
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:05,147
Could've become president.
But he chose to serve God.

330
00:24:05,223 --> 00:24:09,751
Along the way. He happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.

331
00:24:09,828 --> 00:24:13,764
He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.

332
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:17,427
He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.

333
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:22,565
And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.

334
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:27,544
I'm getting used to the idea.
More and more. I'm liking the sound of it.

335
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,743
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.

336
00:24:32,817 --> 00:24:34,682
What if I'm wrong?

337
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,618
I've got a condition.

338
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,849
I get confused sometimes.

339
00:24:38,924 --> 00:24:42,860
And with Lucille dead.
I can't get my medicine.

340
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:45,123
What if I've imagined all of this?

341
00:24:45,196 --> 00:24:50,498
What if I've finally turned into what
they've always said I was gonna turn into?

342
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,968
A maniac.

343
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,438
A psycho killer.

344
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:58,635
Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.

345
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,735
I've gotta know for sure.

346
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:08,309
The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.

347
00:25:08,386 --> 00:25:11,116
For an hour or so.
I asked around about Goldie.

348
00:25:11,189 --> 00:25:13,987
I don't get any answers.
But I know I'm bound to.

349
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:16,186
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker.

350
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,094
And if she was. She has roots here -

351
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,997
friends. Maybe even family.

352
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:29,799
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

353
00:25:39,684 --> 00:25:40,844
Ha.

354
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,218
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

355
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,350
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

356
00:25:48,426 --> 00:25:50,986
No wonder I'm seeing things.

357
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:52,529
Bastard!

358
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:58,196
(Marv laughing)

359
00:25:58,269 --> 00:26:00,169
He's crazy.

360
00:26:00,238 --> 00:26:03,298
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

361
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:07,343
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

362
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,744
Because that's my name, you ape.

363
00:26:10,348 --> 00:26:14,751
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

364
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:17,185
I guess she was the nice one.

365
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:27,057
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

366
00:26:27,132 --> 00:26:29,123
What did you do to them?

367
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,668
You crazy goddamn broad.

368
00:26:31,736 --> 00:26:33,727
Just take a look at this mug.

369
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:38,003
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

370
00:26:38,076 --> 00:26:41,705
None of you would, but Goldie.

371
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,943
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

372
00:26:45,016 --> 00:26:50,249
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

373
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:55,418
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

374
00:26:56,027 --> 00:27:00,930
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

375
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:04,662
So, go ahead, doll.

376
00:27:04,736 --> 00:27:09,469
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

377
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:18,442
Aw, nuts.

378
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:21,850
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

379
00:27:23,254 --> 00:27:28,021
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

380
00:27:28,093 --> 00:27:29,958
You sat there and took it,

381
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,997
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

382
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:37,558
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

383
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,900
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

384
00:27:40,972 --> 00:27:43,065
and I don't hurt girls.

385
00:27:43,741 --> 00:27:45,470
I need a pair of handcuffs.

386
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:48,603
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

387
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,616
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

388
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,611
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

389
00:27:55,687 --> 00:27:59,054
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

390
00:27:59,124 --> 00:28:01,592
I know that sounds crazy.

391
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:04,992
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

392
00:28:05,063 --> 00:28:09,591
Just like that. A whopper of a puzzle piece
falls smack in my lap.

393
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,067
I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet.

394
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:17,097
But she fires up two cigarettes and hands
me one. And I taste her lipstick on it.

395
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:21,771
And suddenly. My heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.

396
00:28:21,846 --> 00:28:26,408
I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.

397
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:28,645
But she isn't Goldie.

398
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,779
Yeah. Yeah.
This'll do.

399
00:28:30,855 --> 00:28:36,293
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

400
00:28:37,395 --> 00:28:39,761
and a spool of razor wire...

401
00:28:40,899 --> 00:28:45,029
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

402
00:28:45,436 --> 00:28:48,098
(man) Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

403
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:49,697
(Marv) You can bet your ass.

404
00:28:50,175 --> 00:28:54,077
(Wendy) She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

405
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:57,706
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

406
00:28:57,782 --> 00:29:02,947
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

407
00:29:03,021 --> 00:29:07,515
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

408
00:29:07,592 --> 00:29:10,390
You know, the way I look.

409
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:14,997
I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.

410
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,035
It's almost killing time.
And I'd better get sharp.

411
00:29:18,102 --> 00:29:22,402
I check the list -
rubber tubing. Gas. Saw.

412
00:29:22,473 --> 00:29:26,500
Gloves. Cuffs. Razor wire. Hatchet.

413
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:28,842
Gladys and my mitts.

414
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:32,849
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

415
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:35,510
Keep the engine runnin'.

416
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:40,354
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

417
00:29:40,425 --> 00:29:42,359
Kill him for me, Marv.

418
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:46,524
Kill him good.

419
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:48,361
I won't let you down, Goldie.

420
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:06,474
Heading downstairs to the kitchen.

421
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:11,147
Getting himself a midnight snack.
And I can guess what kind.

422
00:30:25,103 --> 00:30:27,731
Come on, you son of a bitch.

423
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,570
Damn. He's slick.

424
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,602
(yells)

425
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:45,088
Is that the best you can do, creep?

426
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:50,858
That's right.
Get personal. Get close. I can take it.

427
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,433
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

428
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:05,068
I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.

429
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:08,806
My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.

430
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,680
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

431
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,310
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

432
00:31:15,386 --> 00:31:18,150
Oh, but I want to...

433
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:22,352
I'm sorry. Kid.
But I haven't even started with this creep.

434
00:31:22,427 --> 00:31:26,659
And I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.

435
00:31:26,731 --> 00:31:29,757
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

436
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,031
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

437
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:36,005
It's all that sawing and tying.

438
00:31:36,074 --> 00:31:39,339
It's not as easy as it looks.

439
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,712
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

440
00:31:46,484 --> 00:31:51,319
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

441
00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:56,691
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

442
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:02,062
Well, what do you know?

443
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,494
Look who's here.

444
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,060
Here he comes.

445
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:12,768
(dog growling)

446
00:32:13,845 --> 00:32:16,507
That's a good dog.

447
00:32:16,581 --> 00:32:20,677
He doesn't scream.
Not even when the mutt's had its fill

448
00:32:20,752 --> 00:32:23,346
and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.

449
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:27,289
Somehow the bastard is still alive.
Still staring at me.

450
00:32:27,358 --> 00:32:31,522
Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.

451
00:32:31,963 --> 00:32:34,431
He never screams.

452
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:40,532
I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on

453
00:32:40,605 --> 00:32:44,041
and meet me at her place.
She says. "Yes." like always.

454
00:32:44,108 --> 00:32:46,872
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

455
00:32:46,944 --> 00:32:49,913
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

456
00:32:49,981 --> 00:32:52,882
There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.

457
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,680
Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up

458
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:58,085
and I straightened him out but good.

459
00:32:58,156 --> 00:33:01,853
It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.

460
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:03,689
So, what do you want me to do with her?

461
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:08,391
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

462
00:33:08,466 --> 00:33:11,560
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

463
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,400
Hell, no.
I like it here.

464
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:17,304
(belches)

465
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:20,208
I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit

466
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:22,576
so as not to get any attention.

467
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:26,882
My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.

468
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:28,851
I owe you. Goldie.

469
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,320
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.

470
00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:34,381
So. If going after Roark
means dying. Win or lose -

471
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:38,953
hell. I'll die laughing
if I know I've done this one thing right.

472
00:33:43,634 --> 00:33:46,194
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

473
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:49,000
(man on radio)
All right. Keep a lookout.

474
00:34:04,889 --> 00:34:08,188
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

475
00:34:09,894 --> 00:34:11,486
The dog ate the rest.

476
00:34:19,203 --> 00:34:23,435
Oh, my God.
You monster.

477
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,306
You demon.

478
00:34:26,711 --> 00:34:28,838
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

479
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:35,075
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

480
00:34:35,486 --> 00:34:39,047
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

481
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:44,754
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

482
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,093
When he came to me...

483
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:50,898
he was a tormented boy.

484
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:55,467
Tormented by guilt.

485
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,774
I tried to counsel him.

486
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:04,771
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

487
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:09,917
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

488
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:12,916
What the hell do you know?

489
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:15,458
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

490
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:18,461
He didn't just eat their bodies,

491
00:35:18,863 --> 00:35:21,093
he ate their souls.

492
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,100
And I joined in.

493
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:30,534
They were all whores.

494
00:35:31,709 --> 00:35:35,475
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

495
00:35:35,947 --> 00:35:40,975
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

496
00:35:41,052 --> 00:35:43,350
She stayed in public places.

497
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:45,753
And then with you.

498
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:47,256
You were so convenient.

499
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,593
You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.

500
00:35:50,661 --> 00:35:53,221
Who would believe a thug like you?

501
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:54,889
Kevin killed her.

502
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:58,697
I ordered the police in for you.
But you wouldn't be caught.

503
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:00,236
You wouldn't stop.

504
00:36:00,304 --> 00:36:03,239
And now he's dead and you're here to...

505
00:36:04,842 --> 00:36:06,742
eliminate me.

506
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:11,005
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

507
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:17,744
Killing a helpless old fart?

508
00:36:18,723 --> 00:36:20,657
The killing, no.

509
00:36:20,725 --> 00:36:23,523
No satisfaction.

510
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:28,195
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

511
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,332
Kevin...

512
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,967
we're going home.

513
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:44,170
You can scream now if you want to.

514
00:36:51,689 --> 00:36:56,490
It's beautiful. Goldie.
It's just like I promised. Only better.

515
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,084
And when his eyes go dead.

516
00:36:58,162 --> 00:37:02,394
The hell I sent him to must seem like
heaven after what I've done to him.

517
00:37:03,434 --> 00:37:05,459
- (man) Freeze!
- (man #2) Oh, my God!

518
00:37:11,475 --> 00:37:12,908
(beeping)

519
00:37:12,977 --> 00:37:14,842
(sighs) Jerks.

520
00:37:14,912 --> 00:37:18,712
They should've shot me in the head.
And enough times to make sure.

521
00:37:18,783 --> 00:37:20,648
It's so stupid.

522
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:24,677
Everybody knows what's coming.
But they go through the motions anyway.

523
00:37:24,755 --> 00:37:26,916
What a waste of time.

524
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:31,460
Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.

525
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,431
Night after night. I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.

526
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:39,333
After a while.
I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.

527
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:41,965
I'm on my feet for about ten minutes

528
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:44,974
before the cops kick them out
from under me.

529
00:37:45,042 --> 00:37:47,067
They don't ask me any questions.

530
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:51,604
They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.

531
00:37:51,682 --> 00:37:53,707
And I keep spitting blood all over it

532
00:37:53,784 --> 00:37:57,345
and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.

533
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:01,915
Then along comes this worm assistant
district attorney who turns the recorder off

534
00:38:01,992 --> 00:38:06,429
and says if I don't sign their confession.
They'll kill my mom.

535
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:09,955
I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.

536
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:13,128
From then on.
It's the circus everybody wants it to be.

537
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:17,604
They nail me for the works -
not just the people I did kill.

538
00:38:17,675 --> 00:38:21,975
But even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate.

539
00:38:22,046 --> 00:38:24,446
And even Goldie.

540
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:29,712
The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.

541
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:33,747
Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away.

542
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:36,987
When I get my first surprise in 18 months.

543
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:40,996
My only visitor.

544
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:44,057
I'm ready for anything but that scent.

545
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:47,263
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

546
00:38:52,409 --> 00:38:55,037
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

547
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:58,343
I... I got confused again.

548
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:01,043
Just seeing you like this.

549
00:39:03,354 --> 00:39:05,948
You can call me Goldie.

550
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:18,058
She smells like angels ought to smell.

551
00:39:18,135 --> 00:39:20,831
The perfect woman.

552
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,702
The goddess.

553
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,203
Goldie.

554
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:28,871
She says her name is Goldie.

555
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:35,041
They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.

556
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,647
They even throw in a brew.
It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.

557
00:39:39,723 --> 00:39:44,387
Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.

558
00:39:44,461 --> 00:39:47,328
And it's about damned time.
If you ask me.

559
00:39:47,398 --> 00:39:49,958
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death..."

560
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,764
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

561
00:39:52,837 --> 00:39:55,533
You heard the man.
Hit it.

562
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:58,402
(buzzing)

563
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:07,841
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

564
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:22,191
He's gone.

565
00:40:47,308 --> 00:40:50,004
(knock on door)

566
00:40:52,112 --> 00:40:53,443
Forget it, man.

567
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,948
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

568
00:40:56,016 --> 00:40:58,576
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you in.

569
00:40:58,652 --> 00:41:02,088
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

570
00:41:02,156 --> 00:41:06,252
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

571
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:08,227
Ha. It meant plenty.

572
00:41:08,295 --> 00:41:11,662
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

573
00:41:11,732 --> 00:41:14,360
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

574
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:16,027
I know you're angry, baby.

575
00:41:16,103 --> 00:41:19,266
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

576
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,069
There's a difference
between getting honked off

577
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:22,870
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

578
00:41:22,943 --> 00:41:27,107
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

579
00:41:27,181 --> 00:41:29,741
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

580
00:41:29,817 --> 00:41:32,581
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

581
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:35,554
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

582
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:38,592
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

583
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:41,059
That hurt, Shellie.

584
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:46,760
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

585
00:41:46,834 --> 00:41:49,359
I am impossible to get.

586
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:55,932
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

587
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,843
Get help and get lost.

588
00:41:58,912 --> 00:42:00,607
Just open the door.

589
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:05,550
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

590
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:09,715
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

591
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,725
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

592
00:42:14,795 --> 00:42:18,458
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

593
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:22,024
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

594
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:24,229
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

595
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:26,933
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

596
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:32,001
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

597
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,642
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

598
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:41,286
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

599
00:42:41,355 --> 00:42:44,483
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

600
00:42:44,558 --> 00:42:46,685
You feel like taking them on?

601
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,820
You are teasing me, baby.

602
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:53,458
Some of my best friends...

603
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,195
But you're really pushing my buttons.

604
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,500
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

605
00:42:58,572 --> 00:43:01,405
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

606
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:04,672
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

607
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:07,646
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

608
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:10,013
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

609
00:43:10,084 --> 00:43:13,110
All right.
All right, all right!

610
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:19,259
Troops, make yourself at home.

611
00:43:27,968 --> 00:43:30,994
You brought your whole pack with you?

612
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:33,904
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

613
00:43:33,974 --> 00:43:35,635
You're gonna love this, baby.

614
00:43:35,709 --> 00:43:38,542
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

615
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:42,104
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

616
00:43:42,182 --> 00:43:43,979
and it's gonna be great.

617
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:46,178
I ain't calling up nobody.

618
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:55,526
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

619
00:43:55,596 --> 00:43:59,965
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

620
00:44:00,033 --> 00:44:03,400
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

621
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:06,906
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

622
00:44:06,974 --> 00:44:11,035
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

623
00:44:11,111 --> 00:44:13,545
'cause you scared him so bad.

624
00:44:13,614 --> 00:44:15,673
(laughs)

625
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:19,776
(Jackie Boy) You think
I have no feelings at all.

626
00:44:19,853 --> 00:44:21,980
(Shellie) If you're gonna slug me,

627
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:25,081
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

628
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:29,289
(Jackie Boy) There you go,
lying about me again,

629
00:44:29,363 --> 00:44:32,025
right in front of my friends.

630
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:35,398
I have never hit a woman in my life.

631
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:40,402
(laughter)

632
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,236
That's showing her, man.

633
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:47,838
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

634
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:50,850
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

635
00:44:50,918 --> 00:44:54,718
- I gotta take a leak.
- Oh!

636
00:44:54,788 --> 00:44:57,256
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

637
00:44:57,658 --> 00:45:00,957
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

638
00:45:01,028 --> 00:45:03,519
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

639
00:45:03,597 --> 00:45:07,431
There you go, after my nuts again.

640
00:45:07,501 --> 00:45:09,799
But I forgive you.

641
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,861
I'm a generous guy.

642
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:16,399
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

643
00:45:16,477 --> 00:45:19,605
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

644
00:45:20,247 --> 00:45:23,148
My temper you don't have to worry about.

645
00:45:23,617 --> 00:45:27,280
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

646
00:45:27,354 --> 00:45:30,084
Ooh.
I've been told.

647
00:45:31,425 --> 00:45:34,519
You don't wanna be hittin' the streets
dressed like that, honey.

648
00:45:34,595 --> 00:45:36,256
It's a jungle out there.

649
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:39,322
Besides, you got a couple
of phone calls you ought to be makin'.

650
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:48,337
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

651
00:45:48,408 --> 00:45:51,172
Answer me!

652
00:45:51,245 --> 00:45:53,338
Oh, I don't need this grief.

653
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:59,283
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

654
00:45:59,353 --> 00:46:04,222
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

655
00:46:04,291 --> 00:46:07,954
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

656
00:46:08,028 --> 00:46:12,488
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

657
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:17,902
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

658
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:20,405
You didn't flush.

659
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:15,451
Troops, get outta here.

660
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:17,656
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

661
00:47:17,731 --> 00:47:19,562
Now!

662
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:36,647
(helicopter overhead)

663
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:38,241
(sirens blaring)

664
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:40,513
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

665
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:43,556
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

666
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:45,819
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

667
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:49,787
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

668
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:53,856
Dwight, he was from a while back,

669
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:57,233
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

670
00:47:57,304 --> 00:48:01,070
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

671
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:03,575
And it was only once.

672
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:05,635
I've done some dumb things.

673
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:07,703
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

674
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:10,477
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

675
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,816
But this guy, he's a menace.

676
00:48:14,888 --> 00:48:17,721
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

677
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:21,355
I'll call you later.

678
00:48:21,428 --> 00:48:22,918
No, don't go!

679
00:48:22,996 --> 00:48:25,294
Shellie shouts something
I can't quite make out

680
00:48:25,365 --> 00:48:28,061
over the racket of a passing police 'copter.

681
00:48:28,135 --> 00:48:31,798
- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop." but I can't be sure.

682
00:48:32,472 --> 00:48:36,067
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking.
But I can't just go home and forget about it.

683
00:48:36,143 --> 00:48:39,510
And let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.

684
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:45,245
They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.

685
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:48,617
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

686
00:48:48,689 --> 00:48:51,624
You fool.

687
00:48:51,692 --> 00:48:53,956
You damned fool.

688
00:48:54,027 --> 00:48:55,790
I cut my Caddy across the park

689
00:48:55,862 --> 00:48:59,423
to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.

690
00:48:59,499 --> 00:49:01,490
I'm speeding.

691
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:06,369
That's a good way to get yourself noticed.
And if you're a murderer with a new face

692
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:10,809
who's one fingerprint check away from
the fast track to the gas chamber like I am.

693
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:14,005
The last thing you want
is to get noticed.

694
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:15,275
(siren blaring)

695
00:49:15,348 --> 00:49:19,808
I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop. And even if I did.

696
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:23,049
There's always the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.

697
00:49:23,123 --> 00:49:28,755
Do I try to talk my way out of this.
Or do I take this cop down and risk it all?

698
00:49:29,362 --> 00:49:33,128
Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great. Big. Steaming pile of trouble.

699
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,794
Watch it, Jack!

700
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,894
(horns blaring)

701
00:49:41,842 --> 00:49:43,605
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

702
00:49:43,677 --> 00:49:47,169
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

703
00:49:47,247 --> 00:49:50,307
My gut tightens up.

704
00:49:50,383 --> 00:49:54,752
Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.

705
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,155
The cop shuts off his siren.

706
00:49:59,226 --> 00:50:02,491
He knows he's not the law.
Not in Old Town.

707
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:06,828
The ladies are the law here.
Beautiful and merciless.

708
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,868
If you've got the cash
and you play by the rules.

709
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:11,335
They'll make all your dreams come true.

710
00:50:11,404 --> 00:50:15,135
But if you cross 'em. You're a corpse.

711
00:50:15,208 --> 00:50:19,975
- The squad car's long gone, man.
- Yeah. I called it. Was I right?

712
00:50:20,046 --> 00:50:24,608
You're always right, Jack.
None of us ever doubted you for a second.

713
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:31,057
But I heard things about these girls. Things
they've done to guys who got out of line.

714
00:50:31,124 --> 00:50:33,615
Who's outta line?

715
00:50:39,966 --> 00:50:42,434
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

716
00:50:45,338 --> 00:50:47,499
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

717
00:50:47,908 --> 00:50:52,402
Aw, sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

718
00:50:52,479 --> 00:50:55,505
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

719
00:50:56,183 --> 00:50:59,619
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

720
00:50:59,686 --> 00:51:01,779
I don't do talk jobs, either.

721
00:51:01,855 --> 00:51:06,918
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

722
00:51:06,993 --> 00:51:10,690
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

723
00:51:10,764 --> 00:51:12,891
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

724
00:51:12,966 --> 00:51:16,561
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

725
00:51:16,636 --> 00:51:19,036
well...

726
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:21,596
there's only so much a man can take.

727
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,836
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

728
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:26,276
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

729
00:51:26,346 --> 00:51:28,974
The Amigo's a fag joint.

730
00:51:29,516 --> 00:51:35,455
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

731
00:51:37,724 --> 00:51:41,023
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

732
00:51:41,094 --> 00:51:43,654
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

733
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:45,755
Everything's under control.

734
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:48,994
Enjoy the show.

735
00:51:49,069 --> 00:51:52,004
There's no use arguing with her.

736
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,939
The ladies are their own enforcers.

737
00:51:55,008 --> 00:51:58,034
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

738
00:51:58,111 --> 00:52:01,274
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

739
00:52:01,348 --> 00:52:03,407
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

740
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:07,283
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

741
00:52:07,354 --> 00:52:10,380
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

742
00:52:10,457 --> 00:52:13,483
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

743
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,462
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

744
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:19,623
One of them thinks he is.

745
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:21,724
He's outta control.

746
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:25,237
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

747
00:52:25,305 --> 00:52:28,934
Us helpless little girls.

748
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:33,603
All kinds of death is about to hit
less than 20 yards ahead of us.

749
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,241
And still it's hard to take my eyes off her.

750
00:52:37,317 --> 00:52:40,047
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

751
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,588
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

752
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:45,124
from seeing what Miho can do.

753
00:52:45,191 --> 00:52:49,184
And she's been aching for some practice.

754
00:52:50,196 --> 00:52:54,929
She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.

755
00:52:55,001 --> 00:52:59,233
- Deadly little Miho.
- (girl) You're running out of alley, cowboy.

756
00:52:59,806 --> 00:53:03,572
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

757
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:06,339
(Jackie Boy) You're a sassy little thing.

758
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:11,214
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

759
00:53:11,284 --> 00:53:15,345
The trap is set.
Iocked and ready to spring.

760
00:53:15,422 --> 00:53:19,324
So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.

761
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:22,759
So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?

762
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:26,060
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

763
00:53:26,132 --> 00:53:30,831
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

764
00:53:30,904 --> 00:53:32,337
And they won't.

765
00:53:32,405 --> 00:53:34,532
Why this rotten feeling?

766
00:53:34,607 --> 00:53:38,099
Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.

767
00:53:38,178 --> 00:53:42,410
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

768
00:53:42,482 --> 00:53:45,474
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

769
00:53:45,552 --> 00:53:48,783
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

770
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:52,689
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

771
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:55,193
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

772
00:53:57,931 --> 00:53:59,592
You wanna see it?

773
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,158
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

774
00:54:04,237 --> 00:54:08,298
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

775
00:54:09,376 --> 00:54:11,844
You seen this one?

776
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:15,474
Get in the car.

777
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:20,178
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

778
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:38,666
Oh, God, no!

779
00:54:40,774 --> 00:54:42,401
This is crazy!

780
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:45,838
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

781
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:54,644
Go ahead.

782
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:57,986
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

783
00:54:58,058 --> 00:55:00,492
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

784
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,394
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

785
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,034
I got you right where I want you.

786
00:55:11,104 --> 00:55:14,301
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

787
00:55:14,374 --> 00:55:17,866
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

788
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:22,344
Yeesh.

789
00:55:30,056 --> 00:55:32,047
This isn't funny.

790
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:36,387
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

791
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:38,693
Every one of you is gonna burn.

792
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,697
(Dwight) Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

793
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:46,068
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

794
00:55:46,906 --> 00:55:50,501
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

795
00:55:50,577 --> 00:55:54,377
I told you to shut up.

796
00:55:59,385 --> 00:56:01,615
I can't see.

797
00:56:01,688 --> 00:56:03,713
What's happening?

798
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:07,691
I can't see.

799
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,490
I can't hear anything.

800
00:56:10,563 --> 00:56:14,021
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

801
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,661
Yeah.
Make it quick, will you?

802
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:22,608
She doesn't quite chop his head off.

803
00:56:25,311 --> 00:56:28,610
She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.

804
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:34,112
Then it's straight to business - stretching
the corpses out on the alley floor

805
00:56:34,187 --> 00:56:38,453
and going through their pockets.
Divvying up cash when they find it.

806
00:56:38,525 --> 00:56:40,584
I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.

807
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,491
His wallet is packed.

808
00:56:42,562 --> 00:56:46,521
Mastercard. Discover.
Platinum American Express.

809
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:48,863
And nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties

810
00:56:48,935 --> 00:56:52,871
that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.

811
00:56:52,939 --> 00:56:54,804
Then I find an atom bomb.

812
00:56:57,243 --> 00:56:59,541
Jackie Boy.

813
00:56:59,612 --> 00:57:02,046
You son of a bitch.

814
00:57:07,053 --> 00:57:09,146
There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket.

815
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:12,385
- I couldn't quite make out what she said.
- (mouthing)

816
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,892
I thought Shellie said "stop."

817
00:57:14,961 --> 00:57:17,589
She said "cop."

818
00:57:17,664 --> 00:57:20,861
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.

819
00:57:20,934 --> 00:57:24,267
Iron Jack. The papers call him.

820
00:57:24,337 --> 00:57:27,101
A goddamn hero cop.

821
00:57:29,542 --> 00:57:32,409
It's held for years. The shaky truce.

822
00:57:32,478 --> 00:57:36,505
The cops get a slice of the profits and free
entertainment when they throw a party.

823
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:39,381
The girls get to administer
their own brand of justice.

824
00:57:39,919 --> 00:57:44,447
They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood

825
00:57:44,524 --> 00:57:48,927
and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling. They send him packing.

826
00:57:48,995 --> 00:57:51,657
But they send him back alive.

827
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:53,858
That's the rules.

828
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,833
That's the truce.

829
00:57:55,902 --> 00:57:58,496
The cops stay out.

830
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:01,699
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.

831
00:58:01,774 --> 00:58:04,766
Old Town will be left wide open.

832
00:58:04,844 --> 00:58:06,744
It'll be war.

833
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:10,340
The streets will run red with blood -

834
00:58:10,416 --> 00:58:12,714
women's blood.

835
00:58:12,785 --> 00:58:15,219
The cops!
The mob!

836
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:17,984
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

837
00:58:18,057 --> 00:58:21,925
The hell they will!
We got guns.

838
00:58:21,995 --> 00:58:24,088
We'll fight the cops and the mob

839
00:58:24,163 --> 00:58:27,599
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

840
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:29,294
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

841
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:32,668
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

842
00:58:32,739 --> 00:58:35,902
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

843
00:58:35,975 --> 00:58:37,374
I'll hide the bodies.

844
00:58:37,443 --> 00:58:40,935
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

845
00:58:41,014 --> 00:58:43,539
The cops know Rafferty came here.

846
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:46,642
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

847
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:48,619
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

848
00:58:48,688 --> 00:58:51,589
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

849
00:58:51,658 --> 00:58:53,558
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

850
00:58:53,626 --> 00:58:57,824
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

851
00:58:57,897 --> 00:59:00,559
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

852
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:03,363
You got what you wanted out of me!

853
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:07,065
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

854
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:11,372
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

855
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:14,174
Miho moves to my back.

856
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:18,342
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.

857
00:59:18,418 --> 00:59:22,081
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

858
00:59:22,155 --> 00:59:25,386
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

859
00:59:25,458 --> 00:59:28,188
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

860
00:59:28,261 --> 00:59:32,220
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

861
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:34,562
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

862
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:37,228
Get that gun out of my face now!

863
00:59:37,303 --> 00:59:38,497
(yells)

864
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:41,669
Bastard!

865
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:48,609
I forgot how quick you are.

866
00:59:50,616 --> 00:59:52,277
My warrior woman.

867
00:59:52,352 --> 00:59:54,980
She almost yanks my head clean off.

868
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:58,353
Shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.

869
00:59:58,424 --> 01:00:01,860
An explosion that blasts away
the dull. Gray years

870
01:00:01,928 --> 01:00:06,228
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.

871
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,898
A hardtop with a decent engine.

872
01:00:09,969 --> 01:00:12,335
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

873
01:00:14,407 --> 01:00:17,570
I'll always love you, baby.

874
01:00:17,643 --> 01:00:21,511
Always... and never.

875
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:31,615
(Dwight) Where'd you find that heap?

876
01:00:31,691 --> 01:00:35,218
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

877
01:00:35,294 --> 01:00:38,821
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

878
01:00:38,898 --> 01:00:40,889
you think maybe I could go home?

879
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:45,131
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

880
01:00:45,204 --> 01:00:47,399
Sure, Becky, go home.

881
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:50,271
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

882
01:00:50,343 --> 01:00:53,244
They'll never fit in that trunk.

883
01:00:53,312 --> 01:00:57,078
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

884
01:00:57,517 --> 01:00:59,542
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

885
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:01,746
You'll catch cold if you don't.

886
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:03,846
(squishing sounds)

887
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:11,588
Yeesh.

888
01:01:13,499 --> 01:01:16,093
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

889
01:01:16,169 --> 01:01:19,935
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

890
01:01:20,006 --> 01:01:22,634
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

891
01:01:25,144 --> 01:01:26,702
Hey, Mom?

892
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,279
Dizzy dames.

893
01:01:32,351 --> 01:01:36,378
What were they thinking. Sticking me
with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?

894
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:39,152
We were barely able to get the trunk
to stay closed as it was.

895
01:01:39,225 --> 01:01:40,886
We packed it so tight.

896
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,863
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me.

897
01:01:45,932 --> 01:01:49,834
Out where anybody who cares to look
will see him.

898
01:01:51,037 --> 01:01:54,973
Go ahead. Take one of his cigarettes.

899
01:01:55,942 --> 01:01:57,807
It'll help.

900
01:02:22,335 --> 01:02:26,704
It's got you smoking there, bud.

901
01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:34,304
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

902
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,541
You're dead.

903
01:02:36,616 --> 01:02:40,848
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

904
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,857
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

905
01:02:45,925 --> 01:02:48,359
It's got you hearing things.

906
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:51,590
It's got your nerves shot.

907
01:02:51,664 --> 01:02:54,258
It's got you smoking.

908
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:58,326
You know it's true.

909
01:02:58,404 --> 01:03:02,067
Nobody ever really quits.

910
01:03:03,643 --> 01:03:08,410
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

911
01:03:08,481 --> 01:03:13,384
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

912
01:03:14,754 --> 01:03:17,416
Will you look at that?

913
01:03:18,305 --> 01:03:24,517
