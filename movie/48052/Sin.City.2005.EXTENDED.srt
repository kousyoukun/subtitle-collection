1
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:22,063
Early retirement. Not my idea.

2
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:25,149
Doctor's orders. Heart condition.

3
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:28,027
"Angina," he calls it.

4
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:31,030
I'm polishing my badge,
getting myself used to the idea

5
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,574
of saying goodbye to it.
It, and 30-odd years

6
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,744
of protecting and serving and tears

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,331
and blood and terror
and triumph it represents.

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,876
I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.

9
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:48,756
About the thick, fat steaks
she picked up at the butcher's today.

10
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:52,218
And I'm thinking about
the one loose end I haven't tied up.

11
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,429
A young girl who's out there somewhere,

12
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,265
helpless in the hands
of a drooling lunatic.

13
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,232
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do
this. You're gonna get yourself killed.

14
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:09,736
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,404
Let go of my coat, Bob.

16
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,823
You're draggin' me down with you.

17
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:18,327
I'm your partner. They can kill me, too.
I ain't puttin' up with that.

18
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,747
I'm gettin' on the horn,
calling for backup.

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,876
Sure, Bob. We'll just wait.
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat

20
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,297
gets his sick thrills with victim
number four. Victim number four!

21
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:34,051
Nancy Callahan, age 1 1 . And she'll
be raped and slashed to ribbons.

22
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:38,222
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

23
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:42,727
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

24
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,438
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

25
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,357
Settle down and think straight.

26
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:52,445
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

27
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,864
You ain't savin' anyone.

28
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:59,076
You got a great attitude, Bob.

29
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,913
Real credit to the force, you are.

30
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:06,000
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

31
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,880
Heck, Bob...

32
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,634
...maybe you are right.

33
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,888
I'm glad to hear you're
finally talkin' sense. [grunts]

34
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,599
[Hartigan] Hell of a way
to end a partnership.

35
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,435
Hell of a way to start my retirement.

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,271
Nancy Callahan, age 1 1 .

37
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,816
For all I know, she's dead already.

38
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,821
[man] You've been
a very good girl, Nancy.

39
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,281
You've been very quiet.

40
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,450
- [whimpering]
- Don't be scared.

41
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:41,744
We're gonna be
taking you home soon.

42
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,958
But first, we're going
to introduce you to somebody.

43
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:50,211
He's a very nice man.

44
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:54,465
[Hartigan] Halfway to the warehouse
where Weevil said they took her,

45
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,802
and it hits.
Wicked spot of indigestion.

46
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,429
- [groaning]
- At least that's what I pray it is.

47
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,932
[man] ...momentary digression.

48
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,977
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

49
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,147
[man 2] For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

50
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:14,485
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

51
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,863
[Hartigan] Burt Shlubb
and Douglas Klump:

52
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:21,075
two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs
with delusions of eloquence.

53
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,203
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet,

54
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,831
remanded to our custody,
though it may be,

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,251
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

56
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:33,462
[Hartigan] Gotta keep this quiet.
Take 'em down fast.

57
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,631
A dent, the merest scratch thereupon,

58
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,759
and before-mentioned consequences
which I made mention

59
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:41,262
shall surely be athwart us.

60
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:50,354
- [heart beating]
- [groans]

61
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,942
[Hartigan] Catch your breath.
Give your heart time to slow down.

62
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,028
But it won't slow down.

63
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,115
Get over it.

64
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,242
She needs you.

65
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:05,202
We're all done here, Benny.

66
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:08,789
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

67
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,583
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

68
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,127
I'm making sure
they get along really well.

69
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:18,841
What kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

70
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:22,219
You must be awfully scared now.

71
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,723
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

72
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,435
All we're gonna do
is have a nice little talk.

73
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,316
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

74
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,903
Don't you cry now.

75
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,238
[Hartigan] Doctor said
it'd be like this.

76
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,449
Just take the pill he gave you.

77
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,704
[grunting]

78
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,669
No need to play it quiet.

79
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,796
Not anymore.

80
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,634
Breathe steady, old man.
Prove you're not completely useless.

81
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,845
What the hell?
Go out with a bang.

82
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,597
He likes to hear 'em scream.

83
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,558
I've seen his victims
and their twisted little faces,

84
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:14,480
all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen
in their last horrible moment of living.

85
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:19,068
No screams. Either I'm just in time,
or I'm way too late.

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,991
[grunts]

87
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:33,708
[Hartigan] It's nothing. Barely
a flesh wound. On your feet, old man.

88
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,591
[Hartigan] Roark. Give it up.

89
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,969
Let the girl go.

90
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,221
You can't do a goddamn thing to me.

91
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,306
You know who I am.

92
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,642
You know who my father is!

93
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,228
You can't touch me,
you piece-of-shit cop.

94
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:59,150
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

95
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,278
Sure, I can.

96
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,406
[screaming]

97
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,830
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

98
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,916
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

99
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,131
- [Hartigan] I take his weapons away.
- [screaming]

100
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,343
- Both of them.
- [screaming]

101
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:32,099
[grunting]

102
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,685
[Nancy sobbing]

103
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,188
[Hartigan] Hell of a way
to end a partnership.

104
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,232
[Bob] For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

105
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,779
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

106
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:48,240
- Never better.
- [Roark groaning]

107
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,368
I'm ready to kick your ass.

108
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,371
[Hartigan] Keep him talking. Buy time.

109
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,124
Just a few more minutes.
Till the backup gets here.

110
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:01,128
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

111
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:05,049
[Hartigan] Keep his mind off the girl,
skinny little Nancy.

112
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,134
Can't kill her
once backup gets here.

113
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,553
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

114
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,515
Hey. Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

115
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,810
- What a tough man you are.
- You stay right where you're at.

116
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,896
You shoot your partner in the back...

117
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,192
...then you try to scare a girl.
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod,

118
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,861
plug you a couple of times,
show you how it's done.

119
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:30,741
We could've worked something out.
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

120
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:34,328
- [Hartigan] So slow, never stop me.
- Sit down!

121
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,165
- You'll never be able to stop me.
- [screams]

122
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,589
[siren wails in distance]

123
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:49,176
[Hartigan] I finally sit down,
just like you told me to.

124
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,013
The sirens are close now.

125
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,392
She'll be safe.

126
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,946
Things go dark.
I don't mind much.

127
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,450
Getting sleepy. It's OK.

128
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,786
She'll be safe.

129
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:18,289
An old man dies,

130
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,958
a little girl lives.

131
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,210
Fair trade.

132
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,983
Just tell me it isn't true, John.

133
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,862
What they're saying
about you and that child.

134
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,240
It can't be true.

135
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,827
If you ever want to see me again...

136
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:02,291
...say something now.

137
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,714
We're looking at
your basic mountain of DNA evidence.

138
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,342
The testimony of your own partner,

139
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,762
corroboration by six eyewitnesses,
and that's just so far

140
00:09:14,846 --> 00:09:17,264
and there's your own silence.

141
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:21,185
I'll do what I can, but let us
just say you are good and screwed.

142
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,521
Come on, Hartigan,
what's holding you back?

143
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,273
What's shuttin' you up?

144
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,525
This whole thing stinks to high heaven.

145
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,153
I'm not the only one
on the force who smells it.

146
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,989
Sure, I'll rinse your bedpan
and wipe your butt.

147
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,824
That's my job.

148
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,119
But don't expect any friendly
chitchat out of me, mister.

149
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,830
I heard what you done to that girl.

150
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,458
I hope they throw away the key.

151
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,846
Evenin', officer.

152
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,849
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?

153
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,018
You read the papers.

154
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,563
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,775
You know who I am and what I can do.

156
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,987
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

157
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,572
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

158
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,992
You blew my son's ear off.

159
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:24,665
You blew his arm off. You even
blew his nuts and his pecker off.

160
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:32,089
He's in a coma right now. They say
he may never come out of it. My boy.

161
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,342
He could've been the first Roark
to become the president

162
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:39,596
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

163
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,600
Pullin' that trigger
make you feel powerful?

164
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:48,564
Power don't come
from a badge or a gun.

165
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,109
Power comes from lying.

166
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:56,739
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

167
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,615
Once you got everybody agreeing

168
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,786
with what they know in their hearts
ain't true, you've got 'em by the balls.

169
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:08,417
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

170
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:14,548
I could pump you full of bullets right
now, and I wouldn't even be arrested.

171
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,926
Everyone would lie for me,
everyone who counts.

172
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,929
Otherwise, their lies,
everything that runs Sin City,

173
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,933
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

174
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:28,354
[laughing]

175
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,940
But I want you firm
and fit and healthy.

176
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:35,069
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

177
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,405
Fix that heart condition of yours.

178
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,827
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

179
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:50,250
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

180
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,003
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

181
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,924
disgraced, destroyed...

182
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,051
...alone.

183
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,887
Your wife?

184
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,223
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

185
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,809
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

186
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,186
[siren wailing]

187
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,063
They won't let me testify.

188
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:15,484
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

189
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,028
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

190
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,864
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

191
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,617
I told them you saved me
from that Roark creep,

192
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,871
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

193
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:32,376
I'm still a virgin, still alive,
thanks to you.

194
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,878
They got it all backwards.

195
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,756
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

196
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:42,302
But you'll always remember things right.

197
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,513
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

198
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:51,019
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

199
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,105
Don't visit me.

200
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,023
Don't write me.

201
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,192
Don't even say my name.

202
00:12:57,277 --> 00:13:01,822
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

203
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,782
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia."

204
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:08,495
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

205
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,916
I'll write you every week...
for forever.

206
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,836
Sure, kid.

207
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,046
Now, run on home.

208
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,466
It's not safe for you here.

209
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,679
Bye, Nancy.

210
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,894
I love you.

211
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,279
- [groans]
- John Hartigan.

212
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,157
Mr. Law and Order.

213
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:49,620
Mr. By the Book.

214
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,788
Mr. High and Mighty.

215
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,999
[sighs]

216
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,711
I gotta give you credit, being a
straight arrow for so damn many years

217
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,796
without it catching up with you.

218
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:03,300
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

219
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,469
It's catching up with you but good.

220
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,513
[grunting]

221
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,309
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look good.

222
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:16,438
Oh! He's hale and hearty, Tammy.

223
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,982
See?

224
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,402
He's the picture of health. [laughing]

225
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:25,948
That Tammy, there,
she's fine, isn't she?

226
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,158
I rented her out of Old Town.

227
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:32,996
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

228
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,456
You hear me, Hartigan?

229
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:38,210
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

230
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,004
you might just get some of Tammy.

231
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,925
You see that? She flinched.

232
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,344
You make her sick.

233
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,097
She heard about you
and that little girl.

234
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,183
[Hartigan] Nothing but a price
I promised myself I'd pay,

235
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,601
and I'm paying it.

236
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,562
You don't save a little girl's life,

237
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:59,147
then turn around
and throw her to the dogs.

238
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,233
Not in my book, you don't.

239
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,611
They want a confession.
They won't get it.

240
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:11,535
There was a letter from Nancy waiting
when they put me in solitary.

241
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,705
She calls herself "Cordelia,"
just like she promised.

242
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:18,542
She makes no mention of anything
that would give her away.

243
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,837
At first, I figure
she'll send another note or two

244
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,215
before her young mind
moves on to better things.

245
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,343
But every Thursday,
another one arrives.

246
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,220
What a sweet kid.

247
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:34,891
I do my best to keep my hand
from shaking when I reach for it.

248
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,396
She's the only friend I've got,
the daughter I never had.

249
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,481
My sweet Cordelia.

250
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,942
Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

251
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:48,238
Eight years pass.

252
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:51,742
[keys jingling]

253
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,704
Then comes a Thursday
when I bound from my cot,

254
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,789
excited as a kid at Christmas,

255
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,460
only to find myself staring
at the damn floor of my damn cell,

256
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,671
looking for a letter from Nancy
that isn't there.

257
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,758
Then another Thursday with no letter.

258
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,676
Is she all right?

259
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,137
Did something happen to her?

260
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,765
Nothing.

261
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:18,518
Two months now.
Not a word from Nancy.

262
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,938
Did they find her?
Did they get to her?

263
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:25,609
Of course! Stupid old man.

264
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,321
Do your math. Nancy's 1 9 years old.

265
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,907
How long did you expect her
to keep writing?

266
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,661
She was a saint to keep it up
as long as she did.

267
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,830
She's forgotten you, old man.

268
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,874
You're alone.

269
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,251
You're all alone.

270
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,337
[door clanking]

271
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,805
This guy smells awful, like bad food.

272
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:58,266
Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster
in the middle of summer.

273
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,394
He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.

274
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:14,324
Practically knocked my head off,
the bastard.

275
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,369
When I come to, I see it.

276
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,706
The same kind of envelope
Nancy always uses,

277
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,333
but there's no letter inside of it.

278
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,838
There's something soft,
something that ought to be alive,

279
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,799
a hunk of meat and bone
that ought to be the index finger

280
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,593
of the right hand of a 1 9-year-old girl.

281
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,804
How the hell did they find her?

282
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,514
She was so careful.

283
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,475
She never gave away
where she lives or where she works.

284
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,645
[yelling]

285
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,151
I've got to get out.
I've got to help her.

286
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:54,197
Nothing else matters.
Not my life and not my pride, either.

287
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,033
It's only one final
surrender they want.

288
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:00,620
You got me, Roark. You beat me.

289
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:04,458
- [phone ringing]
- [sirens wailing]

290
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,757
I'll get it, Claire.
It's gotta be Marv.

291
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:15,010
He never sleeps and he's always
getting himself in deep.

292
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,595
Yeah.

293
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,055
What?

294
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:23,518
Hartigan, my God, it is you. Yes, yes.

295
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,730
No, I'll get right on it,
right this second.

296
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,441
I'll be there by ten, I promise.

297
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,823
[Hartigan] Lucille, she wouldn't give up
on me back before the trial.

298
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,577
She almost slugged me when I
stopped her from hiring a new attorney.

299
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,413
When I refused to plead innocent
she did slug me.

300
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:46,833
When she hears what I'm gonna do
she'll probably slug me again.

301
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:48,084
Hartigan.

302
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,545
[scoffs] Damn.

303
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,882
[footsteps approaching]

304
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:58,512
It's like they were waiting for my call.

305
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,556
They're ready to deal. They're
practically begging for a deal.

306
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,016
They're scared of something.

307
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,185
One of them promised me
you'd be out on parole

308
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,437
if you confessed and expressed regret
and all that other dumb crap

309
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,523
that, of course, we won't go for.

310
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,567
No, we're getting you out for
time served, no strings attached.

311
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,570
Then, we're gonna turn right around
and sue those sorry sons of bitches

312
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,280
for false prosecution.

313
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,990
You're gonna be exonerated.

314
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,076
You're gonna be a very rich man.

315
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,786
This isn't like you think it is.

316
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,914
Like hell it isn't. Doesn't take a
genius to figure out who framed you.

317
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,041
- But even Senator Roark...
- You hung up the phone too soon.

318
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,335
- We'll use the law, the press...
- Going to a lot of trouble for nothing.

319
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,962
He will never know what hit him.

320
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,922
I'm gonna confess.

321
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,632
Excuse me?

322
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,804
John Hartigan, crawling on his belly
in front of a parole board,

323
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,224
confessing to raping a little girl
and blubbering for mercy?

324
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,268
No, doesn't work.

325
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:50,730
I'm going in there and I'm telling them
I'm a twisted, wretched child molester.

326
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,442
I'm agreeing to anything
they want from me.

327
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,576
All right, you son of a bitch.

328
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,788
Let's get this over with.

329
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:15,922
[Hartigan] I say everything they want to
hear, just the way they want to hear it.

330
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,802
I tell them I'm a twisted,
wretched child molester.

331
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:24,264
I agree to everything they want from me.

332
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,101
I love you, Nancy.

333
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,616
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

334
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,873
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

335
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,835
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

336
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,421
Christ.

337
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,341
Eight years.

338
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,719
Yeah. Eight years.

339
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,015
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

340
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,019
...you made me hate myself.

341
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:16,733
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

342
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:21,112
She got remarried four years ago.

343
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,577
- She had two kids. I'm sorry, John.
- Nah.

344
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:32,248
Don't be. I'm glad.

345
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,543
Eileen always wanted kids.

346
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,629
She'll make a good mother.

347
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:43,885
Like you said, Bob,
water under the bridge.

348
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:58,024
[Hartigan] Bob and I get on
with fond farewells to each other,

349
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:02,153
then I go looking for the only
human being who means a damn to me:

350
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,238
Nancy.

351
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,283
How could they have found out it was
you writing all those letters to me?

352
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,120
How did they find out who you are?

353
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,373
And what have they done to you, baby?

354
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,212
Not a sound.

355
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:22,007
No sign of life.

356
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,802
Has Roark gone to all this trouble
just to torture a broken old man,

357
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,639
like a kid poking at a fly
when he's already torn his wings off?

358
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:32,517
What has he done to Nancy?

359
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,311
All she does is read and study
and write.

360
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:40,859
No diary, no phone numbers
or addresses written down anywhere.

361
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,780
Closest thing to a clue is a pack
of matches from a lousy saloon.

362
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:51,202
It's a long shot, but maybe
she's got some friends there.

363
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,379
A dead end.
Nancy wouldn't have anything to do

364
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:03,715
with a pack of drunks
and losers like this.

365
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,802
But if there's anything to be found,
the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is

366
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:10,847
or who kidnapped and mutilated her,
this is the place.

367
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:15,727
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

368
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,439
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

369
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,358
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

370
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,944
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

371
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,739
She's just warming up.

372
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,075
[rock music plays]

373
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,334
[Hartigan] Skinny little Nancy Callahan.

374
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,294
She grew up.

375
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,297
She filled out.

376
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,009
Nancy Callahan, 1 9 years old.

377
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,014
And here I was,
expecting a skinny little bookworm,

378
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,851
maybe a bit too shy for her own good.

379
00:23:56,936 --> 00:24:02,732
How little she told me about herself
in all her letters for all those years.

380
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:09,405
How the hell did they find her?

381
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,033
Then it hits me.

382
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,244
They were bluffing.

383
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:18,123
I've led them straight to her.

384
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:29,425
She hasn't spotted you yet.

385
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,053
Turn around and walk out the door.

386
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,722
Lead the creep outside.

387
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:40,186
Get that Beretta away
from him somehow, and kill him.

388
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:44,232
I'm just a horny ex-con
watching an exotic dancer.

389
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,152
Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.

390
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,655
No, Nancy. Don't notice me.

391
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,574
Don't recognize me.

392
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,414
[crowd cheering]

393
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,962
There's no time to explain.

394
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,132
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

395
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,551
We need to get out of here
right this second.

396
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,305
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

397
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,187
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

398
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,898
Kept me going.

399
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,484
Kept me from killing myself.

400
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,904
Hurry up, will you?

401
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,455
- Maybe I should drive.
- Not a chance.

402
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,250
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

403
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:53,509
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

404
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:56,596
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

405
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,099
It's loaded and it works.

406
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,687
Yeah, this'll do.

407
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:08,358
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

408
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:17,700
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

409
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,370
You've never been
far from my thoughts.

410
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:24,040
I've lain awake nights,
thinking of you.

411
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,918
What are you talking about? Damn!

412
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:31,798
Keep driving, Nancy. Keep driving
and keep the car on the road!

413
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,511
[Hartigan] She's counting on you.

414
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:40,890
- What are you doing?
- Prove you're still worth a damn.

415
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,565
Try to keep it on the road, Nancy!

416
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,987
[Hartigan] He's a decent shot.

417
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,948
He's got skill,
but he's in too much of a hurry.

418
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,034
Throwing away bullets
like they were candy.

419
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,124
He doesn't know how to take his time.

420
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,419
Aim careful
and look the devil in the eye.

421
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,546
Ah!

422
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:20,430
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

423
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,598
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

424
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,810
Right. Stop the car, confirm the kill.

425
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,278
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

426
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,574
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

427
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,826
No! Let me stay close.

428
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,454
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

429
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:47,874
Please? Let me stay close.

430
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:03,222
[Hartigan] The stink. I almost gag.
His blood smells worse than he does.

431
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,309
- Jesus.
- And it's all over the place.

432
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,688
- But the creep himself, he's gone.
- [sirens wailing]

433
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,066
We're out of time.

434
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:17,362
[Hartigan] The sirens.
I used to welcome the sound.

435
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,990
Nothing to do now
but find a place for the night,

436
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:24,827
get Nancy calmed down, and figure out
what on Earth I'm going to do next.

437
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:28,206
The stink... somehow it stays
with us all the way to the motel.

438
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,250
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

439
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:35,254
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

440
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,673
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

441
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:41,511
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

442
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:45,181
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

443
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,893
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

444
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,312
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

445
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:52,688
[gagging]

446
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:55,483
[Hartigan] You'll feel
better if you sit down.

447
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,694
[Hartigan] I've never been
all that good with people.

448
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,115
When it comes to reassuring
a traumatized 1 9-year-old,

449
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:06,077
I'm as expert as a palsy victim
doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.

450
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,122
It's always been you, Hartigan.

451
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,915
All these years.

452
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,669
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

453
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,214
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

454
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,551
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

455
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:24,053
Eight years.

456
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:27,723
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

457
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,725
It wasn't just gratitude.

458
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,895
I tried to fall in love with boys.

459
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,356
Even thought I did once or twice.

460
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:39,527
But I was already in love... with you.

461
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:42,321
No.

462
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:14,020
[panting]

463
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:21,027
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

464
00:30:21,111 --> 00:30:23,613
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

465
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,616
I love you.

466
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,831
I love you, too.

467
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,750
With all my heart.

468
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,296
[Hartigan] Cold shower. It helps.

469
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,672
No, Nancy.

470
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,966
[grunts]

471
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,470
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

472
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:51,349
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

473
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:55,186
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

474
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,357
Sure. I recognize your voice, Junior.

475
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,320
[Hartigan]
Everything's gone straight to hell.

476
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,323
I've been suckered into betraying
the only friend I've got,

477
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,993
put her in the hands of a rapist
I thought I'd put down for good.

478
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:15,498
Suckered by a spoiled brat
son of a senator.

479
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,542
It's all gone to hell.

480
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,460
[Roark] Klump, it's me.

481
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,505
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

482
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,507
I want you to set me up for a party.

483
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,009
I've already got the girl,
you dumb shit!

484
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:30,012
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

485
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,723
My tools better be clean and sharp.

486
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:35,560
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

487
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:42,817
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

488
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:46,696
My dad... I'd love him
if I didn't hate him.

489
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,490
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

490
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:52,743
to grow back that equipment
you blew off between my legs,

491
00:31:52,828 --> 00:31:57,498
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

492
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:01,252
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

493
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:05,381
I'm not complaining. Since you've been
gone, I'm having the time of my life.

494
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,093
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

495
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,389
We wondered who wrote those letters.
She left not a clue.

496
00:32:14,725 --> 00:32:17,977
Clever girl. And so pretty, so pretty.

497
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,525
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

498
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,778
Nancy, don't scream.

499
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,448
Whatever he does to you,
don't scream.

500
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:34,869
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

501
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,247
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

502
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,875
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

503
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,919
Dozens of them, maybe a hundred.

504
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,006
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

505
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,467
If there weren't
so many people hereabout,

506
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:53,387
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

507
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,598
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

508
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,689
[Hartigan choking]

509
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:09,070
[Hartigan] This is it.
No way to fight it now.

510
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,197
No hope left.

511
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,823
No chance.

512
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:16,702
This is it. This is the end.

513
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,456
No.

514
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,628
Give it a shot, old man.
Keep your neck tight. Move.

515
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,465
The window, maybe there's an alarm.
The window.

516
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,385
Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!
Stay conscious!

517
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,054
Stay conscious.

518
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,305
No alarm.

519
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,558
The glass! Cut the rope.

520
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,061
You can do it. You can do it.

521
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,021
[Klump] It is inclement upon me

522
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:48,442
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

523
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,697
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car

524
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:55,074
to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

525
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,535
Protest though you might, Mr. Klump,

526
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:00,788
you must none-the-less admit
to the sheer phallic majesty

527
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,832
of said Ferrari's performance.

528
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:07,503
An engine of cyclopean power throbs
beneath this steel stallion's hood.

529
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,132
Irrelevant to said mission
is the following query,

530
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,259
which I now put forth to you:

531
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:15,553
Wherein this most streamlined

532
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:19,515
and trunkless of transports,

533
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,435
boner-inspiring though it may be,

534
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:27,148
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

535
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,943
A worthy concern.

536
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,280
Neatly elucidated.

537
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,871
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

538
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:50,129
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

539
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,881
In plain English, creep!

540
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,760
The answer you seek
is rural, even agrarian.

541
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,180
The farm!

542
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,975
[Hartigan] That's all I need to hear.
Every cop on the force

543
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,146
knows about the Roark family's farm
and to stay away from it.

544
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,523
Shlubb and Klump
were packing an arsenal.

545
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,735
Once things get loud,
I'll have use for the cannons.

546
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,738
But at first,
I'll have to play it quiet.

547
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,073
Quiet and nasty.

548
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,077
Nancy's car, six miles from the farm.

549
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:25,414
"Nobody but me can keep
this heap running," she told me.

550
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:28,834
Good girl. The car stalled out
on that yellow bastard

551
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,420
and you didn't tell him
how to start it up again.

552
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:35,424
You kept your mouth shut.
I'll bet Junior was furious.

553
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,093
I'll bet he slapped you around
something fierce.

554
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:42,097
But you stayed strong.
You bought a few extra minutes.

555
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,433
There's still a chance, Nancy.

556
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:46,352
Don't scream.

557
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,104
I ditch the car a mile or so
from the farm

558
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:51,023
and make my way through the woods.

559
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,651
I'm not halfway there when it hits.

560
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,986
[groaning]

561
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,657
[Hartigan] My heart. Can't be my heart.

562
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,991
I was cured.

563
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:05,579
Bad cough. Blood in it.

564
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,748
Doesn't matter now.

565
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,960
I don't have to stay alive
that much longer, anyway.

566
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,217
Rotten way to kill a man,
but it's quiet.

567
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,636
[grunts]

568
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,474
Hate yourself later.

569
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,361
[whipping]

570
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,824
[Roark] You're only making this worse,
you stupid cow!

571
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:45,911
- [whip lashing]
- [Roark grunting]

572
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:55,671
Do you think I'm tired? Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

573
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,173
You're the one who's gonna crack!

574
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:03,345
You'll crack!
You'll cry and beg!

575
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,139
You'll scream!

576
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,935
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

577
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,353
You'll scream!

578
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,528
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

579
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:22,865
That was foreplay.

580
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:26,827
Hartigan was right about you.

581
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,371
You can't get it up unless I scream.

582
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,583
You're pathetic!

583
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:36,211
You're pathetic.

584
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,675
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

585
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:45,638
It brings out the worst in me.

586
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,226
[gunshot]

587
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,979
[Hartigan] Stupid old man!

588
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:56,023
In too much of a hurry.

589
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,486
Damn! It can't be!

590
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:04,740
[Hartigan] Charging in like Galahad,
just like I told myself I wouldn't!

591
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,116
Stupid old man!

592
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:10,204
- [man] You tagged him good!
- [man 2] Perforate the fool.

593
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,710
Good advice.

594
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,515
[Hartigan] Give it up, Junior.

595
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,102
- It's over. Let her go.
- You're dreaming, Hartigan!

596
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:38,107
I see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams in front of you!

597
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,360
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

598
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,196
You can't even lift that cannon!

599
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,657
Sure, I can.

600
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,412
[laughing]

601
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:56,291
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

602
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:59,253
Nancy, I'm sorry.

603
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,756
I'm taking no chances with you.

604
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,804
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

605
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:14,435
Here it comes.

606
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,982
- It's gonna hurt.
- You're right about that.

607
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,777
- [gasping]
- [sighs]

608
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,821
Sucker.

609
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,909
[Hartigan] I take away his weapon.

610
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:37,416
- Both of them.
- [screaming]

611
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,678
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

612
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:53,724
[Hartigan] After a while, all I'm doing
is pounding wet chunks of bone

613
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,018
into the floorboards, so I stop.

614
00:39:57,562 --> 00:40:00,022
So long, Junior.

615
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,649
Been a pleasure.

616
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,533
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

617
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,747
- I didn't scream.
- I know it, baby.

618
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,166
You grew up strong.

619
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:34,056
[Hartigan] By the time I get her
to the car, Nancy stops shaking.

620
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,060
Her skin is warm again.
She's herself again.

621
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,604
Thanks for remembering my coat.

622
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,899
And for all the little things.

623
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,070
Like saving my life, twice.

624
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:52,282
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

625
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:57,329
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

626
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,124
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

627
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,543
I'm gonna clear my name.

628
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:06,672
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

629
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:10,300
I can't lose you, not again.

630
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,639
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

631
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:32,322
[Hartigan] Nancy Callahan,
the love of my life.

632
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,203
Shame to lie to her.
I hope she forgives me for it.

633
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,874
Get Senator Roark behind bars? Sure.

634
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,502
Maybe after I've pulled off that
miracle, I'll go and punch out God.

635
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:49,381
There isn't a prosecutor in the state
who'll go after Senator Roark.

636
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,633
I killed his only son.

637
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,802
The bloodline is cut.

638
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:56,722
Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.

639
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,600
He'll use all his power
to get revenge on me.

640
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:03,061
He'll go after me through Nancy.
He'll find her again.

641
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,814
There'll be no end to it.

642
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,941
She'll never be safe.

643
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,777
Not as long as I'm alive.

644
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,447
There's only one way to beat him.

645
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,742
An old man dies,

646
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,077
a young woman lives.

647
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,414
Fair trade.

648
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,295
I love you, Nancy.

649
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,982
[sirens wailing in distance]

650
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:50,992
[man] She shivers in the wind
like the last leaf on a dying tree.

651
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,666
I let her hear my footsteps.

652
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,921
She only goes stiff for a moment.

653
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,799
Care for a smoke?

654
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:11,638
Sure. I'll take one.

655
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,391
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

656
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,813
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

657
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,401
I've watched you for days.

658
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,239
You're everything a man could ever want.

659
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,783
It's not just your face,

660
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:36,413
your figure or your voice.

661
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:41,501
It's your eyes.

662
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,256
All the things I see in your eyes.

663
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,927
What is it you see in my eyes?

664
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,143
I see a crazy calm.

665
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,896
You're sick of running.

666
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,360
You're ready to face
what you have to face.

667
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:11,114
But you don't want to face it alone.

668
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,199
No.

669
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,577
I don't want to face it alone.

670
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,873
[thunder rumbles softly]

671
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,212
[man] The wind rises electric.

672
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,883
She's soft and warm
and almost weightless.

673
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:34,054
Her perfume a sweet promise
that brings tears to my eyes.

674
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:38,141
I tell her that
everything will be all right.

675
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:44,856
That I'll save her from whatever she's
scared of and take her far, far away.

676
00:49:47,777 --> 00:49:51,071
I tell her I love her.

677
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,824
- [muffled gunshot]
- [thunder rumbles]

678
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:58,119
The silencer
makes a whisper of the gunshot.

679
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,999
I hold her close until she's gone.

680
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:08,546
I'll never know
what she was running from.

681
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,843
I'll cash her check in the morning.

682
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,376
[woman] Yes.

683
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,920
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

684
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:54,300
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

685
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:57,971
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

686
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,515
It should be right as rain in no time.

687
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,354
Uh-huh.

688
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,064
[elevator dings]

689
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,738
Mm-hmm.

690
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:22,871
[man] Turn the right corner in Sin City

691
00:51:22,955 --> 00:51:27,625
and you can find... anything.

692
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,419
Becky.

693
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,923
Care for a smoke?

694
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,428
Love you, too, Mom.

695
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,724
[man] Anything.

696
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,366
[man] The night is hot as hell.

697
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:13,745
It's a lousy room
in a lousy part of a lousy town.

698
00:56:15,122 --> 00:56:17,498
I'm staring at a goddess.

699
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:20,001
She's telling me she wants me.

700
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:23,921
I'm not gonna waste one more second
wondering how I've gotten so lucky.

701
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,590
I want you.

702
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,053
[man] She smells
like angels ought to smell.

703
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,684
The perfect woman.

704
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,565
The goddess.

705
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:49,197
I need you.

706
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,576
[man] Goldie.

707
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,078
She says her name is Goldie.

708
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:07,673
Three hours later and my head
is feeling several sizes too big.

709
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:10,843
And that cold thing
happens to my stomach.

710
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:14,722
And I realize Goldie's dead.
Not a mark on her.

711
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:18,434
You'd have to check her pulse
or notice those perfect breasts of hers

712
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:21,145
aren't moving like
if she was breathing.

713
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,190
She was murdered
and I was right here when it happened.

714
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,528
Lying next to her,
stone drunk, just like she was.

715
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:33,074
Damn it, Goldie. Who were you
and who wanted you dead?

716
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,660
Who were you
besides an angel of mercy,

717
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:39,080
giving a two-time loser like me
the night of his life?

718
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,833
It sure as hell wasn't my looks.

719
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,836
So why the sleazy saloon?

720
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,255
Why the kindness, Goldie?

721
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,340
[sirens wailing]

722
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:54,178
[man] The cops, they're telling me
too much, showing up before anybody

723
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,223
but me and the killer could
know there's been a murder.

724
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:00,852
Somebody paid good money
for this frame.

725
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,688
No reason at all to play it quiet.

726
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:06,899
No reason to play it
any way but my way.

727
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,448
Whoever killed you
is gonna pay, Goldie.

728
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:21,539
[officer] Open up, police!

729
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,291
I'll be right out.

730
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:28,713
[gunshot]

731
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:33,885
[gunfire]

732
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,854
[siren approaching]

733
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:55,281
[man] I don't know
why you died, Goldie.

734
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:02,413
I don't know why and I don't know how
I never even met you before tonight,

735
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:06,334
but you were a friend and more
when I needed one.

736
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,086
And when I find out who did it,

737
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:12,131
it won't be quick and quiet
like it was with you.

738
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:16,052
It'll be loud and nasty,
my kind of kill.

739
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:19,096
And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I send him to

740
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:22,767
will seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.

741
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:24,101
I love you, Goldie.

742
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:36,280
- [siren blares in distance]
- [helicopter passing]

743
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:46,040
[rustling]

744
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:48,376
Claire?

745
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,806
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

746
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:06,978
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way I'm giving you any alcohol.

747
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:11,190
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

748
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:12,984
No.

749
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,611
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

750
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:17,738
Thanks. You're the best.

751
01:00:17,823 --> 01:00:20,616
[man] Lucille's my parole officer.

752
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,868
She's a dyke, but God knows why.

753
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:26,497
With that body of hers
she could have any man she wants.

754
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:29,667
The pills come from a girlfriend
who's a shrink.

755
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:33,921
She tried to analyze me once
but she got too scared.

756
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:37,675
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

757
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,178
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them?

758
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:45,641
Not that I know. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

759
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:48,686
How do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

760
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:54,525
There ain't no squaring it. Not this
time. This isn't some barroom brawl.

761
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:57,778
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

762
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,238
Hey, hey. This is big.

763
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,075
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- There ain't no settlin' down!

764
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,412
This is blood for blood,
and by the gallons.

765
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:11,000
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

766
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:13,919
They're back.
There's no choices left.

767
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:15,796
And I'm ready for war.

768
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:19,800
Prison was hell for you.
It's gonna be life this time.

769
01:01:19,885 --> 01:01:24,305
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

770
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,141
But I'm out now.

771
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,728
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

772
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,899
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

773
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:40,529
- [helicopter passing]
- [Marv] Now, for Gladys. Sweet Gladys.

774
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,908
But I'll have to sneak past Mom,

775
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:47,995
and her ears have gotten a whole
lot better since she went blind.

776
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:54,668
Mom still hasn't changed
a thing in this room.

777
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:58,297
Every week she dusts it all off
so it looks like it was only yesterday

778
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,299
that I moved out.

779
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,052
Every time I come visit,
she has me sleep in here,

780
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,472
and the old smells make me cry
like they do right now.

781
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:09,642
I knew Gladys would be safe here.

782
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:13,687
I call her Gladys after
one of the sisters from school.

783
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,981
She's almost lived up to the name.

784
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:19,485
For a while we just get
the feel of each other back.

785
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,487
Good as ever.

786
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,824
I tell her about Goldie
and what we have to do.

787
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:29,787
Marvin?
Is that you, baby?

788
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:32,123
Yes, Mom. I'm sorry I woke you up.

789
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:36,794
I couldn't sleep for the worry.
There were men here looking for you.

790
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,004
They weren't police.

791
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:43,300
It was about my job.
I got a new job.

792
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:48,347
- It's night work.
- What did you do to your face?

793
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,058
Oh, I... cut myself shaving.

794
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:55,271
You're getting confused again,
aren't you?

795
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:59,942
Mom, I feel better
than I have in years.

796
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:03,988
[helicopter passing]

797
01:03:04,072 --> 01:03:06,490
[Marv] You were scared,
weren't you, Goldie?

798
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:09,201
Somebody wanted you dead
and you knew it.

799
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:12,037
So you hit the saloons,
the bad places,

800
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:16,417
looking for the biggest,
meanest lug around and finding me.

801
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,170
I'm gonna find
that son of a bitch that killed you,

802
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,089
and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.

803
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,385
Walk down
the right back alley in Sin City...

804
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:29,763
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
- ...and you could find anything.

805
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,600
That coat looks like Baghdad.

806
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:35,603
So does your face. Take off!

807
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:38,606
[groaning]

808
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:44,028
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

809
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:46,488
[Marv] Kadie's is my kind ofjoint.

810
01:03:48,116 --> 01:03:50,201
Nancy's just getting
started with her gig,

811
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,369
but already the crowd's
breathing hard.

812
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,580
Plenty of nights
I've drooled over Nancy,

813
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,209
shoulder to shoulder
with all the other losers like me.

814
01:03:58,293 --> 01:04:00,586
But that's not
what I'm lookin' for tonight.

815
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:04,089
I'm looking for something
small and hairy.

816
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:12,264
Take it easy, Weevil.
I'm here to do you a favor.

817
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,642
It's money in your pocket.

818
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,143
[grunts]

819
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:20,481
Spread the word. Tell him I've been
hitting the joints drunk off my butt,

820
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:24,860
shooting my mouth off,
crying over some hot babe named Goldie.

821
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,042
What'll it be, Marv?

822
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:43,003
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

823
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:46,757
Sure, honey. You take it slow, now.

824
01:05:01,523 --> 01:05:04,608
[man] Most people think Marv is crazy.

825
01:05:04,693 --> 01:05:08,112
He just had the rotten luck
of being born in the wrong century.

826
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:10,906
He'd be right at home
on some ancient battlefield,

827
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:13,367
swinging an ax into somebody's face.

828
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:18,289
Or in a Roman arena taking
a sword to other gladiators like him.

829
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:22,376
They'd have tossed him girls
like Nancy back then.

830
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,923
Show's over, dickwad. Drink up.

831
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:30,884
That's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

832
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:38,600
Your killin' days are over, you
over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

833
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:43,647
[Marv] I love hit men. No matter what
you do to them, you don't feel bad.

834
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:45,232
[grunting]

835
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,991
- [Marv] Take it off.
- What?

836
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:56,493
A fine coat,
you're bleeding all over it.

837
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:59,079
All right, it's all yours. Oh, God!

838
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:02,875
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

839
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:07,421
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

840
01:06:08,548 --> 01:06:10,758
So tell me, man. Who sent you?

841
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,013
I don't hear you giving me any names.

842
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:19,683
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

843
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:21,643
- [screams]
- [gunshot]

844
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:27,399
[Marv] You keep holding out on me,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

845
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:36,116
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

846
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,037
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

847
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:43,540
Thanks again.

848
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:45,167
[gunshot]

849
01:06:48,463 --> 01:06:50,714
[Marv] Then the
damnedest thing happens.

850
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:55,052
For a second, I smell the angel smell
that belonged to my Goldie.

851
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,471
Just need my medicine, is all.

852
01:06:57,555 --> 01:06:59,807
Bastard.

853
01:06:59,891 --> 01:07:03,143
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

854
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,481
Feel like talking, Louie?

855
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,067
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie?

856
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,902
How many for the kill?

857
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,571
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

858
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:19,159
He'll never talk.

859
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:25,332
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

860
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:30,504
[Marv] Connelly talks. They all talk.

861
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,588
[bell tolls]

862
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,715
[man] What have been
your sins, my son?

863
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,468
[Marv] Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

864
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,513
so I'll just fill you in
on the latest batch.

865
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,599
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

866
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,768
You're speaking figuratively.

867
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:49,440
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

868
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:52,025
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

869
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,279
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

870
01:07:55,363 --> 01:08:01,285
By way of a "for instance,"
I killed three men tonight.

871
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:02,744
Tortured 'em first.

872
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:07,124
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

873
01:08:07,208 --> 01:08:10,085
First two were minnows,
small-time messengers.

874
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:15,007
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

875
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,759
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

876
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:21,638
Just give me a damn name.

877
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:25,058
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck,

878
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:29,313
feeding me garbage like that.
It can't be that big.

879
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:31,732
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

880
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:34,735
It's all there. Find out for yourself.

881
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,236
And while you're at it,

882
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:42,242
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

883
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,703
[Marv] Worth dying for.

884
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,830
- Worth killing for.
- [gunshot]

885
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,249
Worth going to hell for.

886
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,251
Amen.

887
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:57,633
His keys say the padre
drove a Mercedes,

888
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:01,345
or at least that's what they're
passing off as a Mercedes these days.

889
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:05,432
Modern cars:
they all look like electric shavers.

890
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,851
[tires screeching]

891
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,815
Goldie. [grunts]

892
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:19,279
Goldie! [grunts]

893
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,707
It couldn't be Goldie.

894
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:34,962
It's my own fault, and nobody else's,
that I got confused.

895
01:09:35,046 --> 01:09:38,924
I've been having so much fun
I forgot to take my medicine.

896
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:40,926
That wasn't Goldie back there.

897
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,427
Goldie's dead,

898
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:46,473
and that's the whole reason that
I've been doing what I've been doing.

899
01:09:46,558 --> 01:09:50,227
When you got a condition,
it's bad to forget your medicine.

900
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,565
The cold thing,

901
01:09:54,649 --> 01:09:58,485
it creeps into my gut and tells me
one more time it won't let go.

902
01:09:58,570 --> 01:10:02,155
This is a bad place, this farm.

903
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:05,534
- People have died here...
- [soft growling]

904
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:07,202
...the wrong way.

905
01:10:07,287 --> 01:10:11,957
- [barking, growling]
- I don't want to fight, pooch.

906
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:17,754
I got no gripe with you.

907
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,341
Easy, boy.

908
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,177
[dog whimpers]

909
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:28,098
[Marv] No way I was gonna use
my gun on you, buddy.

910
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:30,892
It's whoever owns you
I'm curious about,

911
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,813
because there's blood on your breath,
and I think I know what kind.

912
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,649
So I sniff around to see what's buried.

913
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,030
Here we go.

914
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:51,663
It's impossible.
Nobody can sneak up on me.

915
01:10:57,128 --> 01:11:02,341
I go blind.
Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.

916
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:05,594
Except the one who snuck
into that hotel room two nights ago.

917
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:09,640
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

918
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:12,309
You killed Goldie.

919
01:11:12,393 --> 01:11:14,061
It was... [grunts]

920
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:17,147
[Marv] I blew it, Goldie.

921
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,359
I found your killer,
but he was better than me.

922
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,986
Too quiet, too quick.

923
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:25,530
A killer born.

924
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,116
Why didn't he finish the job?

925
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:44,841
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

926
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:48,303
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

927
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,183
The wolf just gets scraps.

928
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,268
Bones.

929
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,688
It's him.

930
01:11:57,772 --> 01:12:02,234
He... eats... people.

931
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:06,738
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

932
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:09,074
Just like they were steaks.

933
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:11,493
Now he's got both of us.

934
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:14,705
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

935
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,417
Just look at the heads on the wall.

936
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:23,213
The heads on the wall.

937
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:27,300
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

938
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:31,388
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

939
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,307
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

940
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:39,271
[screaming] He made me watch!

941
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:49,197
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

942
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:53,785
[Marv] Dames. Sometimes all they
gotta do is let it out.

943
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,080
And a few buckets later,
there's no way you'd know.

944
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:59,916
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

945
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:04,671
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

946
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:06,965
Any leads?

947
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:10,635
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

948
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:15,682
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking
out that hooker almost before I did.

949
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:19,394
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

950
01:13:19,479 --> 01:13:21,605
The dead one.

951
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:23,857
Goldie.

952
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:26,401
I didn't know she was a hooker.

953
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,654
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

954
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:36,077
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

955
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,954
Must have shown you quite a time.

956
01:13:38,039 --> 01:13:40,207
Quiet. There's a car coming.

957
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:46,546
- [horn honks]
- [man] Kevin!

958
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:51,468
[Marv] All I've got is a face...
and a name.

959
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:53,553
I'll see you later, Kevin.

960
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:57,224
[grunts]

961
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:04,564
[panting] Let's go.

962
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,208
They're done checking the house.

963
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:25,335
They're coming this way.

964
01:14:25,419 --> 01:14:28,421
Bastards. I'll show them.

965
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,841
- [grunts]
- [thudding]

966
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:37,639
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

967
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:40,433
No, don't shoot! Please.

968
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:42,769
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

969
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:45,313
He's unconscious and unarmed,

970
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,400
so there's no need to kill him.

971
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,867
Captain, the target,
there's no sign of him.

972
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,452
- Here's a sign!
- [screaming]

973
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:02,914
[grunting]

974
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,678
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

975
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:27,898
[Marv] I keep coming back to that cop
I just killed and what he told me.

976
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:30,775
I was pretty steamed about
what he'd done to Lucille,

977
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:33,403
so I took my time
with that son of a bitch.

978
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:37,741
It wasn't till I showed him all those
pieces of himself that he said it.

979
01:15:37,825 --> 01:15:43,496
Just a name:
Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.

980
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,666
Could've become president,
but he chose to serve God.

981
01:15:46,751 --> 01:15:51,254
Along the way, he happened to become
the most powerful man in the state.

982
01:15:51,339 --> 01:15:55,175
He's brought down mayors and governors
like they were nothing.

983
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,929
He even made his rotten brother
a US senator without breaking a sweat.

984
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:02,891
And here he's gonna get killed
in the name of a dead hooker.

985
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:09,147
I'm getting used to the idea. More
and more, I'm liking the sound of it.

986
01:16:10,691 --> 01:16:14,319
Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.

987
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,279
What if I'm wrong?

988
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:20,450
I've got a condition.
I get confused sometimes.

989
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:24,371
And with Lucille dead,
I can't get my medicine.

990
01:16:24,455 --> 01:16:26,706
What if I've imagined all of this?

991
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:32,087
What if I've turned into what they've
always said I was gonna turn into?

992
01:16:32,171 --> 01:16:34,547
A maniac.

993
01:16:34,632 --> 01:16:36,967
A psycho killer.

994
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:40,220
Can't kill a man
without knowing for sure you ought to.

995
01:16:40,304 --> 01:16:42,347
I've gotta know for sure.

996
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:49,896
The merchandise is on display
by the time I make my way to Old Town.

997
01:16:49,981 --> 01:16:52,691
For an hour or so,
I ask around about Goldie.

998
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:55,568
I don't get any answers,
but I know I'm bound to.

999
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,779
Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,

1000
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:00,657
and if she was, she has roots here:

1001
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:03,535
Friends, maybe even family.

1002
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:11,334
You can't be Goldie. Goldie's dead.

1003
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:25,724
[chuckles] Goldie. Yeah, sure, right.

1004
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:29,853
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

1005
01:17:29,937 --> 01:17:32,522
No wonder I'm seeing things.

1006
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,065
Bastard!

1007
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,696
[Marv chuckles]

1008
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:41,698
He's crazy.

1009
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,826
Hit him again, Wendy. Harder.

1010
01:17:46,454 --> 01:17:48,872
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

1011
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,291
Because that's my name, you ape.

1012
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:56,254
Goldie was my sister. My twin sister.

1013
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,715
I guess she was the nice one.

1014
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:08,558
Goldie and the other six,
where are they?

1015
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:10,727
What did you do to them?

1016
01:18:10,811 --> 01:18:13,229
You crazy goddamn broad.

1017
01:18:13,314 --> 01:18:15,231
Just take a look at this mug.

1018
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:19,527
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

1019
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:23,239
None of you would, but Goldie.

1020
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:26,534
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

1021
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:31,831
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

1022
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:36,920
But as soon as they had me for a fall
guy, they showed up, guns blazing.

1023
01:18:37,004 --> 01:18:42,509
But they didn't get me, and I've been
killing my way to the truth ever since.

1024
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:46,262
So, go ahead, doll.

1025
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:50,975
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

1026
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,943
Nuts.

1027
01:19:00,027 --> 01:19:03,530
OK, I'm glad we got
all that sorted out.

1028
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:07,700
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots!

1029
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:11,371
- That's my specialty!
- You sat there and took it,

1030
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:14,624
when you could've taken my gun away
any time you wanted to.

1031
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:19,087
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

1032
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,549
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

1033
01:19:22,633 --> 01:19:24,551
and I don't hurt girls.

1034
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,970
I need a pair of handcuffs.

1035
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:30,140
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

1036
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:34,102
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

1037
01:19:34,186 --> 01:19:37,147
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

1038
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:40,567
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

1039
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:43,111
I know that sounds crazy.

1040
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:46,489
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

1041
01:19:46,574 --> 01:19:50,827
[Marv] Just like that, a whopper of
a puzzle piece falls smack in my lap.

1042
01:19:50,911 --> 01:19:53,580
I'm too dumb to put
the whole picture together yet,

1043
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:56,958
but she fires up two cigarettes
and hands me one,

1044
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,626
and I taste her lipstick on it.

1045
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:03,339
And suddenly, my heart's pounding
so loud I can't hear anything else.

1046
01:20:03,424 --> 01:20:08,011
I want to reach over and touch her
and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.

1047
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,221
But she isn't Goldie.

1048
01:20:10,306 --> 01:20:12,307
[Marv] Yeah, yeah. This'll do.

1049
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:17,896
I'm gonna be needing a dozen two-foot
lengths of this rubber tubing...

1050
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,357
...and a spool of razor wire...

1051
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:26,529
...and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

1052
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:29,616
[man] Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

1053
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,201
[Marv] You bet your ass.

1054
01:20:31,285 --> 01:20:35,538
[Wendy] She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

1055
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:39,292
Why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

1056
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:44,464
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

1057
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:49,093
I wasn't never
even able to buy a woman.

1058
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,971
You know, the way I look.

1059
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:56,559
[Marv] I take my mind off her
and I crawl back inside myself.

1060
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,604
It's almost killing time,
and I'd better get sharp.

1061
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:03,900
I check the list:
rubber tubing, gas, saw,

1062
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:08,029
gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,

1063
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:10,365
Gladys and my mitts.

1064
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,369
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

1065
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:17,038
Keep the engine runnin'.

1066
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:21,876
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

1067
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,878
Kill him for me, Marv.

1068
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:28,049
Kill him good.

1069
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,884
I won't let you down, Goldie.

1070
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,278
[Marv] Heading downstairs
to the kitchen.

1071
01:21:48,362 --> 01:21:52,699
Getting himself a midnight snack,
and I can guess what kind.

1072
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,340
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1073
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:12,176
[Marv] Damn, he's slick.

1074
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,691
Is that the best you can do, creep?

1075
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:32,447
That's right.
Get personal, get close. I can take it.

1076
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:38,036
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

1077
01:22:41,749 --> 01:22:46,669
[Marv] I try to slow my heart down
and breathe the fire out of my lungs.

1078
01:22:46,754 --> 01:22:50,340
My muscles make me
a thousand promises of pain to come.

1079
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:54,260
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

1080
01:22:54,345 --> 01:22:56,888
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

1081
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,682
Oh, but I want to...

1082
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:04,020
I'm sorry, kid, but I haven't
even started with this creep,

1083
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:08,191
and I don't want you watching the rest.
It'll give you nightmares.

1084
01:23:08,275 --> 01:23:11,402
[Marv] God, I gotta tell you,
I'm good and bushed.

1085
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:14,530
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

1086
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:17,533
It's all that sawing and tying.

1087
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:20,870
It's not as easy as it looks.

1088
01:23:20,954 --> 01:23:23,039
Could have been a real mess around here

1089
01:23:23,123 --> 01:23:26,376
if I didn't have that tubing
for tourniquets.

1090
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:32,840
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

1091
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:38,179
to get the scent in the air, to get
that friend of yours to come running.

1092
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,601
Well, what do you know?

1093
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,021
Look who's here.

1094
01:23:47,106 --> 01:23:50,650
- Here he comes.
- [growling]

1095
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:58,032
That's a good dog.

1096
01:23:58,117 --> 01:24:02,203
[Marv] He doesn't scream,
not even when the mutt's had its fill

1097
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:04,872
and Kevin's guts
are lying all over the place.

1098
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:09,001
Somehow the bastard is still alive,
still staring at me.

1099
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:13,005
Not even when I grab the saw
and finish the job.

1100
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:16,175
He never screams.

1101
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,265
I put in a call to Kadie's
and ask Nancy to get her clothes on

1102
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:25,768
and meet me at her place.
She says, "Yes," like always.

1103
01:24:25,853 --> 01:24:28,396
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

1104
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,441
Sure, Marv. Who's the babe?

1105
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,402
There isn't much of anything
Nancy wouldn't do for me.

1106
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:37,196
Not since a year back
when a frat boy roughed her up

1107
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,615
and I straightened him out but good.

1108
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:43,369
It really gets my goat
when guys rough up dames.

1109
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,204
What do you want me to do with her?

1110
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:49,917
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

1111
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:53,087
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

1112
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:55,923
Hell, no. I like it here.

1113
01:24:57,509 --> 01:24:58,801
[belches]

1114
01:24:58,886 --> 01:25:02,138
[Marv] I hot-wire a parked cab
and stay under the speed limit

1115
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:04,056
so as not to get any attention.

1116
01:25:04,141 --> 01:25:08,394
My head starts to clear.
Things start to make sense.

1117
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,354
I owe you, Goldie.

1118
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,815
I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.

1119
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,902
So, if going after Roark
means dying, win or lose,

1120
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:20,406
hell, I'll die laughing if I know
I've done this one thing right.

1121
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:27,663
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

1122
01:25:27,748 --> 01:25:29,248
[man on walkie] Keep a lookout.

1123
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:49,727
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

1124
01:25:51,438 --> 01:25:53,022
The dog ate the rest.

1125
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:04,951
Oh, my God. You monster.

1126
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:07,787
You demon.

1127
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:10,331
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

1128
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:15,878
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

1129
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:20,550
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

1130
01:26:20,634 --> 01:26:23,594
It's not a real good idea
for you to talk about Goldie

1131
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,347
that way while I'm around.

1132
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,683
When he came to me...

1133
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,478
...he was a tormented boy.

1134
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,066
Tormented by guilt.

1135
01:26:37,985 --> 01:26:40,361
I tried to counsel him.

1136
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:46,242
But the eating,
it filled him with white light.

1137
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:51,455
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

1138
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:54,417
What the hell do you know?

1139
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:57,044
I know it's pretty
damn weird to eat people.

1140
01:26:57,129 --> 01:27:02,758
He didn't just eat their bodies,
he ate their souls.

1141
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,637
And I joined in.

1142
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:12,184
They were all whores.

1143
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,939
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

1144
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:22,612
And then your... Goldie
almost ruined everything.

1145
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:24,864
She stayed in public places.

1146
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:27,408
And then with you.

1147
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:28,743
You were so convenient.

1148
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:32,121
You'd broke a man's jaw
that very night.

1149
01:27:32,205 --> 01:27:34,749
Who would believe a thug like you?

1150
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,417
Kevin killed her.

1151
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:40,212
I ordered the police in for you,
but you wouldn't be caught.

1152
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:41,756
You wouldn't stop.

1153
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,884
And now he's dead and you're here to...

1154
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,220
...eliminate me.

1155
01:27:48,305 --> 01:27:52,558
Will that give you satisfaction,
my son?

1156
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:59,398
Killing a helpless old fart?

1157
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,151
The killing, no.

1158
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:03,903
No satisfaction.

1159
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:09,909
Everything up until
the killing will be a gas.

1160
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,830
Kevin...

1161
01:28:17,376 --> 01:28:19,710
...we're going home.

1162
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:25,716
You can scream now if you want to.

1163
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:38,020
[Marv] It's beautiful, Goldie.
It's just like I promised, only better.

1164
01:28:38,105 --> 01:28:41,107
And when his eyes go dead,
the hell I sent him to

1165
01:28:41,191 --> 01:28:43,943
must seem like heaven
after what I've done to him.

1166
01:28:44,945 --> 01:28:46,987
- [man] Freeze!
- [man 2] Oh, my God!

1167
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,539
- [heart monitor beeping]
- [Marv groans] Jerks.

1168
01:28:56,623 --> 01:29:00,209
They should've shot me in the head,
and enough times to make sure.

1169
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,211
It's so stupid.

1170
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:06,257
Everybody knows what's coming,
but they go through the motions anyway.

1171
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,384
What a waste of time.

1172
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:13,055
Months fall off the calendar
while I breathe and eat through tubes.

1173
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:17,017
Night after night, I wait for somebody
to come and finish me off.

1174
01:29:17,102 --> 01:29:20,813
After a while, I realize
it's not gonna be so easy as that.

1175
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,482
I'm on my feet for ten minutes

1176
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,569
before the cops kick them out
from under me.

1177
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,654
They don't ask me any questions.

1178
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:33,200
They just keep knocking the crap out of
me and waving a confession in my face.

1179
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,286
And I keep spitting blood all over it

1180
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,873
and laughing at how many fresh copies
they come up with.

1181
01:29:38,957 --> 01:29:42,251
Then along comes this worm
assistant district attorney

1182
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:46,088
who turns the recorder off and says
if I don't sign their confession,

1183
01:29:46,173 --> 01:29:47,923
they'll kill my mom.

1184
01:29:48,008 --> 01:29:51,552
I break his arm in three places
and I sign it.

1185
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,597
From then on, it's the
circus everybody wants it to be.

1186
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:59,101
They nail me for the works,
not just the people I did kill,

1187
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:03,606
but even Lucille and the girls
that Roark and Kevin ate,

1188
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:05,941
and even Goldie.

1189
01:30:06,026 --> 01:30:11,238
The judge is all fire and brimstone
when she hands down the sentence.

1190
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,409
Midnight and my death
are only a few hours away,

1191
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,496
when I get my first surprise
in 1 8 months.

1192
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,625
My only visitor.

1193
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,586
I'm ready for anything but that scent.

1194
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:28,923
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

1195
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:36,555
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

1196
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:39,975
I... I got confused again.

1197
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,728
Just seeing you like this.

1198
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:47,483
You can call me Goldie.

1199
01:30:56,576 --> 01:30:59,578
[Marv] She smells
like angels ought to smell.

1200
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:02,414
The perfect woman.

1201
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,291
The goddess.

1202
01:31:05,585 --> 01:31:07,795
Goldie.

1203
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,464
She says her name is Goldie.

1204
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:16,637
They fix me a pretty decent steak
for my last meal.

1205
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:21,183
They even throw in a brew. It's the
first I've had since back at Nancy's.

1206
01:31:21,268 --> 01:31:25,980
Then they shave my head and fix me
with a rubber diaper and get to it.

1207
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,858
And it's about damned time,
if you ask me.

1208
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:31,652
"Though I walk through
the valley of the shadow..."

1209
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:34,363
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

1210
01:31:34,447 --> 01:31:37,074
You heard the man. Hit it.

1211
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:41,412
[sizzling]

1212
01:31:46,293 --> 01:31:49,378
Is that the best you can do,
you pansies?

1213
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,760
[exhales]

1214
01:32:02,601 --> 01:32:03,726
He's gone.

1215
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:05,277
[banging on door]

1216
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:09,156
Forget it, man. You can bang
on that door all night if you want to.

1217
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:11,825
There is no way in hell
I'm letting you in.

1218
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:15,329
[man] I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

1219
01:37:15,413 --> 01:37:19,708
Everything we've shared...
It has to mean something to you.

1220
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:23,462
It meant plenty. Plenty of lost pay
on account of how nobody wants

1221
01:37:23,546 --> 01:37:27,591
to flirt with a waitress whose face is
all purple and swollen up with bruises.

1222
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,384
I know you're angry, baby.

1223
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:32,054
I forgive you for that
without you asking me to.

1224
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:36,308
There's a difference between getting
honked off at a guy who's not so bad,

1225
01:37:36,392 --> 01:37:40,354
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

1226
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:43,315
who skips out on a wife
he doesn't even tell you about

1227
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,193
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

1228
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:49,029
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

1229
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:52,199
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

1230
01:37:52,283 --> 01:37:54,493
That hurt, Shellie.

1231
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:57,788
It's one thing for you
to play hard to get,

1232
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:00,207
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

1233
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,793
I am impossible to get.

1234
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,963
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help,

1235
01:38:06,047 --> 01:38:09,216
like... a shrink.

1236
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,678
Get help and get lost.

1237
01:38:12,762 --> 01:38:14,054
[Jackie Boy] Open the door.

1238
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:18,976
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

1239
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:23,146
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

1240
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:28,151
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

1241
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:30,529
No! If he knew
that you were here with me,

1242
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:35,284
- you don't know how bad this could get!
- This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

1243
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:37,661
He's got four friends
out there in the hall,

1244
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,372
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

1245
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:45,502
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

1246
01:38:45,586 --> 01:38:51,049
Somebody! Jackie Boy, it's a
regular African love fest in here!

1247
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:54,720
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

1248
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:57,973
half the bench of the Basin City Blues
keeping me company.

1249
01:38:58,057 --> 01:39:00,183
You feel like taking them on?

1250
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:03,270
[Jackie Boy] You are teasing me, baby.

1251
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:06,982
Some of my best friends...

1252
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:09,318
But you're really pushing my buttons.

1253
01:39:09,402 --> 01:39:11,987
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

1254
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:15,032
I've been too polite to point out
that any time I want to,

1255
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:18,160
I could kick this
damn door to splinters.

1256
01:39:18,244 --> 01:39:20,329
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

1257
01:39:20,413 --> 01:39:23,498
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

1258
01:39:23,583 --> 01:39:26,626
All right. All right, all right!

1259
01:39:29,339 --> 01:39:32,758
Troops, make yourself at home.

1260
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:44,186
You brought your whole pack with you?

1261
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:47,397
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

1262
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:49,066
You're gonna love this, baby.

1263
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:52,027
Call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

1264
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:55,530
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

1265
01:39:55,615 --> 01:39:59,618
- and it's gonna be great.
- I ain't calling up nobody.

1266
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:09,002
That's a man's shirt, and I'm
sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

1267
01:40:09,087 --> 01:40:13,382
You got somebody's
love stink all over you.

1268
01:40:13,466 --> 01:40:16,843
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

1269
01:40:16,928 --> 01:40:20,389
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

1270
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:24,518
He flew out the window just
as soon as he heard you were coming,

1271
01:40:24,602 --> 01:40:29,106
- 'cause you scared him so bad.
- [Jackie Boy chuckling]

1272
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:33,193
[Jackie Boy] You think
I have no feelings at all.

1273
01:40:33,277 --> 01:40:35,404
[Shellie] If you're gonna slug me,

1274
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:38,532
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

1275
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:42,702
[Jackie Boy] There you go,
lying about me again,

1276
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:45,539
right in front of my friends.

1277
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:49,543
I have never hit a woman in my life.

1278
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:50,919
[smack]

1279
01:40:52,088 --> 01:40:54,464
[laughing]

1280
01:40:54,549 --> 01:40:56,675
That's showing her, man.

1281
01:40:56,759 --> 01:41:01,221
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

1282
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:04,349
- Baby, we're here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

1283
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:08,228
- I gotta take a leak.
- [men laughing]

1284
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,647
Wish you'd dropped by earlier,
Jackie Boy.

1285
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:14,443
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

1286
01:41:14,527 --> 01:41:17,028
Could've seen
what a real man looks like.

1287
01:41:17,113 --> 01:41:20,907
There you go, after my nuts again.

1288
01:41:20,992 --> 01:41:23,243
- But I forgive you.
- [scoffs]

1289
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,370
I'm a generous guy.

1290
01:41:25,455 --> 01:41:29,916
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

1291
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:33,336
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

1292
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:36,548
My temper you don't
have to worry about.

1293
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:40,844
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

1294
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,680
I've been told.

1295
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:47,684
Oh, you don't wanna be hitting the
streets dressed like that.

1296
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:52,772
It's a jungle out there. You got
a couple phone calls you ought to make.

1297
01:41:56,944 --> 01:42:01,781
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

1298
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,743
Answer me!

1299
01:42:04,827 --> 01:42:06,786
Oh, I don't need this grief.

1300
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:11,500
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

1301
01:42:12,919 --> 01:42:17,797
You ever so much as talk to Shellie
again, you even think her name,

1302
01:42:17,882 --> 01:42:21,510
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

1303
01:42:21,594 --> 01:42:26,056
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

1304
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:31,478
Yeah? You already made
a big mistake yourself.

1305
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:33,813
You didn't flush.

1306
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:38,735
[muffled yelling]

1307
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:20,068
[belching, gagging]

1308
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,077
Troops, get outta here.

1309
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:33,206
No questions, damn it.
No questions. Now!

1310
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:50,974
[helicopter hovering, sirens wailing]

1311
01:43:51,767 --> 01:43:53,893
[Shellie] Dwight, what did you do?

1312
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:56,855
I just gave him a taste
of his own medicine.

1313
01:43:56,939 --> 01:43:59,232
I don't think he'll
be bothering you again.

1314
01:43:59,317 --> 01:44:03,236
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

1315
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:07,240
Dwight, he was from a while back,

1316
01:44:07,325 --> 01:44:10,702
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

1317
01:44:10,786 --> 01:44:14,539
And it was only
'cause I felt sorry for him.

1318
01:44:14,624 --> 01:44:17,000
And it was only once.

1319
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:18,960
I've done some dumb things.

1320
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:21,171
Seeing how
I'm one of those dumb things,

1321
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,923
I can't give you
too hard a time about that.

1322
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:28,261
But this guy, he's a menace.

1323
01:44:28,346 --> 01:44:31,181
He might kill somebody
if I don't stop him.

1324
01:44:33,142 --> 01:44:35,894
- I'll call you later.
- No, don't go!

1325
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:38,772
[Dwight] Shellie shouts something
I can't make out

1326
01:44:38,856 --> 01:44:41,441
over the racket
of a passing police 'copter.

1327
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:43,693
- Stop!
- It sounds like "stop,"

1328
01:44:43,778 --> 01:44:47,447
but I can't be sure.
It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,

1329
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:49,532
but I can't go home
and forget about it,

1330
01:44:49,617 --> 01:44:52,952
and let Jackie Boy and his pals
find their fun.

1331
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:58,625
They're a pack of predators and they're
out for blood tonight: a woman's blood.

1332
01:44:58,709 --> 01:45:02,128
Damn it, Dwight. Damn it.

1333
01:45:02,213 --> 01:45:05,131
You fool.

1334
01:45:05,216 --> 01:45:07,384
You damned fool.

1335
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:09,511
[Dwight] I cut my Caddy
across the park

1336
01:45:09,595 --> 01:45:12,972
to pick up Jackie Boy heading
like a bat outta hell up the hill.

1337
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:17,644
I'm speeding. That's a good way
to get yourself noticed.

1338
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:21,356
If you're a murderer with a new face
who's one fingerprint check away

1339
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:24,317
from the fast track
to the gas chamber like I am,

1340
01:45:24,402 --> 01:45:27,445
the last thing you want
is to get noticed.

1341
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:28,822
[siren wailing]

1342
01:45:28,906 --> 01:45:33,326
I don't have nearly enough cash on me
to bribe this cop, and even if I did,

1343
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:36,496
there's the outside chance
he's one of the honest ones.

1344
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:42,502
Do I try to talk my way out of this, or
do I take this cop down and risk it all?

1345
01:45:42,586 --> 01:45:46,506
Then Jackie Boy saves me
a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.

1346
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:49,175
- Watch it, Jack!
- [horn honking]

1347
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:53,596
- [tires screeching]
- [siren wailing]

1348
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,183
Cops! They're right on our ass!

1349
01:45:57,268 --> 01:46:00,603
Not for long. Not where we're headed.

1350
01:46:00,688 --> 01:46:03,732
[Dwight] My gut tightens up.

1351
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:08,194
Jackie Boy's leading us
straight to Old Town.

1352
01:46:10,740 --> 01:46:12,574
The cop shuts off his siren.

1353
01:46:12,658 --> 01:46:15,910
He knows he's not the law,
not in Old Town.

1354
01:46:15,995 --> 01:46:20,206
The ladies are the law here,
beautiful and merciless.

1355
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,417
If you've got cash
and play by the rules,

1356
01:46:22,501 --> 01:46:26,129
they'll make all your dreams come true.
But if you cross 'em,

1357
01:46:26,213 --> 01:46:28,590
you're a corpse.

1358
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:33,470
- Squad car's long gone.
- I called it. Was I right?

1359
01:46:33,554 --> 01:46:37,932
You're always right, Jack. None of us
ever doubted you for a second.

1360
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,061
But I heard things about these girls.

1361
01:46:42,146 --> 01:46:44,606
Things they'd done to guys
who got out of line.

1362
01:46:44,690 --> 01:46:47,650
Who's out of line? Ha!

1363
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:55,867
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

1364
01:46:58,788 --> 01:47:00,914
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

1365
01:47:00,998 --> 01:47:05,835
Aw, sweetheart, I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

1366
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:08,963
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

1367
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:13,051
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

1368
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:15,261
I don't do talk jobs, either.

1369
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:20,433
Baby doll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

1370
01:47:20,518 --> 01:47:24,187
I've been beat up
every time I turn around.

1371
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,397
But the day I get
turned down by a hooker

1372
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:29,943
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with,

1373
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:35,114
well, there's only
so much a man can take.

1374
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:37,325
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

1375
01:47:37,409 --> 01:47:39,786
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

1376
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:42,372
The Amigo's a fag joint.

1377
01:47:42,456 --> 01:47:46,417
[Jackie Boy] Are you having
a good time humiliating me like this

1378
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:48,962
for no damn reason at all?

1379
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:54,509
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

1380
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:57,136
since they showed up
with that cop behind them.

1381
01:47:57,221 --> 01:47:59,264
Everything's under control.

1382
01:48:00,391 --> 01:48:02,433
Enjoy the show.

1383
01:48:02,518 --> 01:48:05,478
[Dwight] There's no use
arguing with her.

1384
01:48:05,563 --> 01:48:08,439
The ladies are their own enforcers.

1385
01:48:08,524 --> 01:48:11,526
How's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

1386
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:14,821
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

1387
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:16,990
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

1388
01:48:17,074 --> 01:48:20,827
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

1389
01:48:20,911 --> 01:48:23,955
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

1390
01:48:24,039 --> 01:48:26,916
Damn it, Gail. Not right now.

1391
01:48:27,001 --> 01:48:31,004
Those clowns down the way,
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

1392
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:33,172
One of them thinks he is.

1393
01:48:33,257 --> 01:48:35,300
He's outta control.

1394
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:38,803
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

1395
01:48:38,888 --> 01:48:42,515
Us helpless little girls.

1396
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:47,186
[Dwight] All kinds of death is about
to hit less than 20 yards ahead of us,

1397
01:48:47,271 --> 01:48:50,815
and still it's hard
to take my eyes off her.

1398
01:48:50,900 --> 01:48:53,484
Us girls are safe
as we can be, Lancelot.

1399
01:48:53,569 --> 01:48:56,154
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

1400
01:48:56,238 --> 01:48:58,698
from seeing what Miho can do.

1401
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:02,619
And she's been aching
for some practice.

1402
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:08,499
[Dwight] She guides my glance upwards
to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.

1403
01:49:08,584 --> 01:49:12,629
- Deadly little Miho.
- [girl] You're running out of alley.

1404
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:17,216
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

1405
01:49:17,301 --> 01:49:19,719
[Jackie Boy] You're
a sassy little thing.

1406
01:49:19,803 --> 01:49:24,849
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

1407
01:49:24,934 --> 01:49:28,978
[Dwight] The trap is set,
locked and ready to spring.

1408
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:32,690
So what? They're scum.
They deserve what's coming.

1409
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:36,402
So why this rotten feeling in my gut
that something is awfully wrong?

1410
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:39,697
They haven't killed anybody
I know about.

1411
01:49:39,782 --> 01:49:44,452
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

1412
01:49:44,536 --> 01:49:45,954
And they won't.

1413
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:48,164
[Dwight] Why this rotten feeling?

1414
01:49:48,248 --> 01:49:51,542
Something Shellie said.
I can't place it.

1415
01:49:51,627 --> 01:49:55,838
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

1416
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:58,925
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

1417
01:49:59,009 --> 01:50:02,220
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

1418
01:50:02,304 --> 01:50:06,057
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

1419
01:50:06,141 --> 01:50:08,601
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

1420
01:50:08,686 --> 01:50:10,436
[grunts]

1421
01:50:11,355 --> 01:50:13,022
You wanna see it?

1422
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:18,277
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

1423
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:21,739
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

1424
01:50:22,825 --> 01:50:25,284
You seen this one?

1425
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:28,538
Get in the car.

1426
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:33,626
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

1427
01:50:44,847 --> 01:50:47,015
[gasping]

1428
01:50:50,853 --> 01:50:52,103
Oh, God, no!

1429
01:50:54,231 --> 01:50:55,857
This is crazy!

1430
01:50:56,608 --> 01:50:59,277
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

1431
01:51:07,036 --> 01:51:08,077
Go ahead.

1432
01:51:08,162 --> 01:51:11,414
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1433
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:14,000
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

1434
01:51:14,084 --> 01:51:17,920
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

1435
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:24,510
I got you right where I want you.

1436
01:51:24,595 --> 01:51:27,680
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

1437
01:51:27,765 --> 01:51:31,392
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

1438
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,772
Yeesh.

1439
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:45,573
This isn't funny.

1440
01:51:46,283 --> 01:51:49,827
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

1441
01:51:49,912 --> 01:51:52,205
Every one of you is gonna burn.

1442
01:51:53,916 --> 01:51:56,125
[Dwight] She's just playing with you.

1443
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:59,587
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

1444
01:52:00,422 --> 01:52:04,008
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

1445
01:52:04,093 --> 01:52:07,887
I told you to shut up.

1446
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:15,186
I can't see.

1447
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:17,146
What's happening?

1448
01:52:18,857 --> 01:52:21,234
I can't see.

1449
01:52:21,318 --> 01:52:24,070
I can't hear anything.

1450
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:27,573
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

1451
01:52:27,658 --> 01:52:31,244
Yeah. Make it quick, will you?

1452
01:52:33,205 --> 01:52:36,165
[Dwight] She doesn't
quite chop his head off.

1453
01:52:38,752 --> 01:52:42,046
She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.

1454
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:45,466
Then it's straight to business:

1455
01:52:45,551 --> 01:52:49,428
Stretching corpses out on the floor
and going through their pockets,

1456
01:52:49,513 --> 01:52:54,142
divvying up cash when they find it. I'm
fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.

1457
01:52:54,226 --> 01:52:56,060
His wallet is packed.

1458
01:52:56,145 --> 01:53:00,106
MasterCard, Discover,
Platinum American Express,

1459
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:02,441
and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties

1460
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:06,445
that I'm not too proud
to stuff into my own pockets.

1461
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,197
Then I find an atom bomb.

1462
01:53:10,826 --> 01:53:13,161
Jackie Boy,

1463
01:53:13,245 --> 01:53:15,496
you son of a bitch.

1464
01:53:20,043 --> 01:53:22,795
There was a helicopter
that kicked up such a racket,

1465
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,007
I couldn't quite
make out what she said.

1466
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:28,509
I thought Shellie said "stop."

1467
01:53:28,594 --> 01:53:31,429
She said "cop."

1468
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:34,307
Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.

1469
01:53:34,391 --> 01:53:37,894
Iron Jack, the papers call him.

1470
01:53:37,978 --> 01:53:40,730
A goddamn hero cop.

1471
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:47,486
It's held for years, the shaky truce.
The cops get a slice of the profits

1472
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:50,114
and free entertainment
when they throw a party.

1473
01:53:50,199 --> 01:53:52,783
The girls administer
their own brand ofjustice.

1474
01:53:52,868 --> 01:53:58,080
They get to defend their own turf.
If a cop blunders into the neighborhood

1475
01:53:58,165 --> 01:54:02,543
and he's not shopping for what the girls
are selling, they send him packing,

1476
01:54:02,628 --> 01:54:05,296
but they send him back alive.

1477
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:07,506
That's the rules.

1478
01:54:07,591 --> 01:54:09,467
That's the truce.

1479
01:54:09,551 --> 01:54:12,011
The cops stay out.

1480
01:54:12,095 --> 01:54:15,139
That keeps the girls free
to keep the pimps and the mob out.

1481
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:18,476
Old Town will be left wide open.

1482
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,436
It'll be war.

1483
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:24,023
The streets will run red with blood.

1484
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:26,150
Women's blood.

1485
01:54:26,235 --> 01:54:31,697
The cops! The mob! Things are gonna
go back to the way they used to be!

1486
01:54:31,782 --> 01:54:35,618
The hell they will! We got guns.

1487
01:54:35,702 --> 01:54:37,787
We'll fight the cops and the mob

1488
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:40,539
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

1489
01:54:40,624 --> 01:54:43,000
- We'll go to war.
- [Dwight] Don't be stupid.

1490
01:54:43,085 --> 01:54:46,379
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

1491
01:54:46,463 --> 01:54:49,590
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

1492
01:54:49,675 --> 01:54:51,050
I'll hide the bodies.

1493
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:54,637
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

1494
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:57,223
The cops know Rafferty came here.

1495
01:54:57,307 --> 01:55:00,059
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

1496
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:02,353
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

1497
01:55:02,437 --> 01:55:05,273
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check.

1498
01:55:05,357 --> 01:55:07,400
Get that out of my face
or I'll smack ya.

1499
01:55:07,484 --> 01:55:11,529
Who do you think you are,
giving orders?

1500
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:14,323
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

1501
01:55:14,408 --> 01:55:17,118
You got what you wanted out of me!

1502
01:55:17,202 --> 01:55:20,496
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

1503
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:24,792
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

1504
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:27,628
[Dwight] Miho moves to my back.

1505
01:55:29,214 --> 01:55:31,757
One word from Gail
and she'll cut me in half.

1506
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:35,511
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

1507
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:38,806
It'll be the bad old days
all over again.

1508
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:41,559
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

1509
01:55:41,643 --> 01:55:45,646
They won't be watching the roads. Not
yet, they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

1510
01:55:45,731 --> 01:55:47,982
If I don't make it,
you can have your war.

1511
01:55:48,066 --> 01:55:51,527
- Get that gun out of my face now!
- Ah!

1512
01:55:53,322 --> 01:55:55,114
Bastard!

1513
01:55:59,828 --> 01:56:02,038
I forgot how quick you are.

1514
01:56:04,041 --> 01:56:05,708
[Dwight] My warrior woman.

1515
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:08,419
She almost yanks my head clean off,

1516
01:56:08,503 --> 01:56:11,797
shoving my mouth into hers
so hard it hurts.

1517
01:56:11,882 --> 01:56:15,343
An explosion that blasts away
the dull, gray years

1518
01:56:15,427 --> 01:56:19,722
between the now and that one fiery night
when she was mine.

1519
01:56:20,599 --> 01:56:23,392
A hardtop with a decent engine.

1520
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:25,853
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

1521
01:56:27,898 --> 01:56:31,067
I'll always love you, baby.

1522
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:35,029
Always... and never.

1523
01:56:43,038 --> 01:56:44,997
[Dwight] Where'd you find that heap?

1524
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:48,709
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

1525
01:56:48,794 --> 01:56:52,338
Gail? Um, unless there's something else
you want me to do,

1526
01:56:52,422 --> 01:56:54,382
you think maybe I could go home?

1527
01:56:54,466 --> 01:56:58,636
All this blood and stuff's got me
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

1528
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:00,888
Sure, Becky, go home.

1529
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:03,766
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

1530
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:06,727
They'll never fit in that trunk.

1531
01:57:06,812 --> 01:57:10,606
Not like this, they won't. Miho.

1532
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:14,944
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!
You'll catch cold if you don't.

1533
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,279
[sword cutting]

1534
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:25,037
Yeesh.

1535
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:29,500
Hey, Becky. Gail said no calls.

1536
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:33,504
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

1537
01:57:33,588 --> 01:57:36,215
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

1538
01:57:38,718 --> 01:57:40,302
Hey, Mom?

1539
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:46,684
[Dwight] Dizzy dames.
What were they thinking,

1540
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:49,895
sticking me with a beat-up bucket
of bolts like this?

1541
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:52,731
We were barely able to get
the trunk closed as it was,

1542
01:57:52,816 --> 01:57:54,442
we packed it so tight.

1543
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:59,405
There wasn't anything we could do
but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,

1544
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:03,409
out where anybody
who cares to look will see him.

1545
01:58:04,619 --> 01:58:08,539
Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.

1546
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:11,375
It'll help.

1547
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:40,154
It's got you smoking there, bud.

1548
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:47,953
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

1549
01:58:48,038 --> 01:58:50,164
You're dead.

1550
01:58:50,248 --> 01:58:54,460
I'm just imagining this,
so shut the hell up.

1551
01:58:54,544 --> 01:58:59,465
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

1552
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:04,011
It's got you hearing things.
It's got your nerves shot.

1553
01:59:05,305 --> 01:59:07,640
It's got you smoking.

1554
01:59:07,724 --> 01:59:11,727
You know it's true. [wheezing]

1555
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:15,564
Nobody ever really quits.

1556
01:59:17,108 --> 01:59:21,862
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

1557
01:59:21,947 --> 01:59:26,867
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

1558
01:59:28,245 --> 01:59:30,913
Will you look at that?

1559
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:35,918
Ooh! Those hookers let you down.
[giggles]

1560
01:59:37,212 --> 01:59:42,341
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

1561
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:46,679
You sucker for the babes, you.

1562
01:59:46,763 --> 01:59:49,682
You ain't even
gonna make it to the pits.

1563
01:59:49,766 --> 01:59:52,935
You shut the hell up. I'll make it.

1564
01:59:53,019 --> 01:59:56,355
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

1565
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:58,190
Watch it!

1566
01:59:58,275 --> 02:00:00,568
[horn honking]

1567
02:00:01,027 --> 02:00:03,028
Ah, this is great.

1568
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:06,490
Just like being in a buddy movie.

1569
02:00:06,575 --> 02:00:10,536
- Shut up!
- [Jackie Boy laughing]

1570
02:00:11,788 --> 02:00:13,330
[siren wailing]

1571
02:00:15,792 --> 02:00:20,796
Boy, you're screwed,
you're out, you're finished.

1572
02:00:21,172 --> 02:00:23,424
Stick a fork in it.

1573
02:00:23,508 --> 02:00:27,052
You're swirling around
the bottom of the bowl,

1574
02:00:27,137 --> 02:00:30,472
nose-diving down the pipe.

1575
02:00:30,557 --> 02:00:32,600
It's over.

1576
02:00:32,684 --> 02:00:35,227
You're flushed.

1577
02:00:35,312 --> 02:00:38,230
[Dwight] I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

1578
02:00:38,315 --> 02:00:42,318
Sure, he's an asshole.

1579
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:45,029
Sure, he's dead.

1580
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:48,741
Sure, I'm just imagining
that he's talking.

1581
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:52,870
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

1582
02:00:52,954 --> 02:00:56,415
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

1583
02:00:56,499 --> 02:00:58,709
Not in this heap.

1584
02:00:58,793 --> 02:01:01,337
Pull over!

1585
02:01:02,839 --> 02:01:06,342
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

1586
02:01:06,426 --> 02:01:08,886
Tough call.

1587
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:12,139
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

1588
02:01:12,223 --> 02:01:16,435
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

1589
02:01:16,519 --> 02:01:18,771
My hand moves all on its own,

1590
02:01:18,855 --> 02:01:22,900
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

1591
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:30,074
- I don't know what to do.
- Better stop. You're making him mad.

1592
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:34,370
Whatever you say.

1593
02:01:41,336 --> 02:01:45,005
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

1594
02:01:46,549 --> 02:01:49,301
I'm the designated driver.

1595
02:01:55,058 --> 02:01:58,227
Well, you're driving
with a busted tail light.

1596
02:02:03,525 --> 02:02:05,651
I'll let you off with a warning.

1597
02:02:13,410 --> 02:02:14,785
What next?

1598
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:16,995
[thunder crashes]

1599
02:02:19,124 --> 02:02:23,836
[Dwight] The tank goes dry
a quarter mile from the pits.

1600
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,964
I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.

1601
02:02:27,048 --> 02:02:30,342
A few minutes' more work
and it'll all be over.

1602
02:02:30,427 --> 02:02:33,804
Jackie Boy
will go into the damn tar pits,

1603
02:02:33,888 --> 02:02:38,100
I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,
go home and call it a...

1604
02:02:49,446 --> 02:02:51,655
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

1605
02:02:51,740 --> 02:02:55,451
Clear the streets. We're in lockdown.

1606
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:58,203
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1607
02:02:58,288 --> 02:03:00,622
Not tonight.

1608
02:03:04,043 --> 02:03:07,629
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1609
02:03:07,714 --> 02:03:09,965
Your cause is lost.

1610
02:03:10,049 --> 02:03:11,633
We know everything.

1611
02:03:11,718 --> 02:03:15,929
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1612
02:03:16,014 --> 02:03:21,018
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1613
02:03:21,102 --> 02:03:24,229
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1614
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:28,358
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1615
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:32,738
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1616
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:37,826
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1617
02:03:37,911 --> 02:03:42,539
by facilitating
the process of transition,

1618
02:03:42,624 --> 02:03:48,170
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1619
02:03:48,254 --> 02:03:50,839
Son of a bitch! I know you.

1620
02:03:50,924 --> 02:03:56,053
I have suffered your kind before,
the dregs of Sin City.

1621
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:58,138
I serve a new master now,

1622
02:03:58,223 --> 02:04:03,060
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1623
02:04:03,144 --> 02:04:08,565
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1624
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:12,194
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1625
02:04:12,278 --> 02:04:15,030
You don't know him.

1626
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:18,367
My man will find a way.

1627
02:04:18,451 --> 02:04:21,537
He always finds a way.

1628
02:04:22,539 --> 02:04:24,998
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1629
02:04:25,083 --> 02:04:28,585
and going on about
how they got it so bad.

1630
02:04:28,670 --> 02:04:30,963
This is a fine, grand country.

1631
02:04:31,047 --> 02:04:33,298
Guiding light
of the modern world, it is.

1632
02:04:33,383 --> 02:04:36,385
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1633
02:04:36,469 --> 02:04:40,389
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1634
02:04:40,473 --> 02:04:43,392
[woman] Beats blowing up
airports and churches

1635
02:04:43,476 --> 02:04:45,561
without shite to show for it.

1636
02:04:47,397 --> 02:04:49,106
Yeesh.

1637
02:04:50,567 --> 02:04:55,445
- You find something, Murphy?
- Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1638
02:04:55,530 --> 02:04:57,573
It's all bent up.

1639
02:04:57,657 --> 02:05:00,450
What's this stuck in it?

1640
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:02,578
Bloody hell. It's the bullet.

1641
02:05:11,838 --> 02:05:15,507
You son of a bitch! Bastard!

1642
02:05:16,926 --> 02:05:19,136
[Dwight] They weren't cops, these four.

1643
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,013
They were mercenaries.

1644
02:05:21,097 --> 02:05:23,432
If they were hired
by who I think they were,

1645
02:05:23,516 --> 02:05:26,518
the bad times
haven't even started yet.

1646
02:05:26,603 --> 02:05:30,272
And everything seemed
to be going so well.

1647
02:05:42,118 --> 02:05:47,372
[man] Remember, we don't have to deliver
every last inch of the man, Brian.

1648
02:05:47,457 --> 02:05:51,293
[Brian] You got a good point there,
Ronnie. Lend me your knife.

1649
02:05:53,129 --> 02:05:56,214
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1650
02:05:56,299 --> 02:05:59,176
I'm at the bone, all right?

1651
02:06:01,512 --> 02:06:03,639
There we go.

1652
02:06:06,476 --> 02:06:10,604
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1653
02:06:11,689 --> 02:06:15,317
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1654
02:06:15,401 --> 02:06:18,278
use your imagination, OK?

1655
02:06:28,206 --> 02:06:30,540
[Dwight] Silence, now.

1656
02:06:30,625 --> 02:06:33,001
No air to breathe.

1657
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:37,172
Only the horrid, oily tar taste
creeping up my nostrils.

1658
02:06:38,424 --> 02:06:42,761
Let it in. Let it fill your lungs.

1659
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:46,515
They were counting on you
and you blew it.

1660
02:06:47,433 --> 02:06:51,770
Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.

1661
02:06:51,854 --> 02:06:55,524
Miho, you're an angel.

1662
02:06:55,608 --> 02:06:57,484
You're a saint.

1663
02:06:57,568 --> 02:06:59,778
You're Mother Teresa.

1664
02:06:59,862 --> 02:07:01,947
You're Elvis.

1665
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:04,032
You're God.

1666
02:07:04,951 --> 02:07:10,288
If you'd shown up ten minutes earlier,
we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.

1667
02:07:10,373 --> 02:07:14,001
Dwight, they got Gail!

1668
02:07:14,877 --> 02:07:18,046
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1669
02:07:18,131 --> 02:07:20,966
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1670
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:23,468
We gotta find out who it is
and rescue Gail.

1671
02:07:23,553 --> 02:07:25,595
First, we gotta get
Jackie Boy's head

1672
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:29,891
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this situation blows wide open.

1673
02:07:29,976 --> 02:07:35,272
Miho, I hope to hell you left
one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1674
02:07:43,281 --> 02:07:46,366
[Dwight] I let him know
I'm not fooling around.

1675
02:07:46,451 --> 02:07:48,869
[groaning]

1676
02:07:51,205 --> 02:07:53,290
We talk.

1677
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:06,094
Stay smart. Stay cool.

1678
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:09,639
It's time to prove to your friends
that you're worth a damn.

1679
02:08:09,724 --> 02:08:12,851
Sometimes, that means dying.

1680
02:08:12,935 --> 02:08:16,438
Sometimes, it means killing
a whole lot of people.

1681
02:08:16,522 --> 02:08:18,899
There they are. What do we do?

1682
02:08:18,983 --> 02:08:21,276
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1683
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:31,745
[Dwight] Jackie Boy's head
is close to me

1684
02:08:31,829 --> 02:08:35,665
I could almost reach out
and grab it right then and there.

1685
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:43,006
Get the head! Get the head!

1686
02:08:44,801 --> 02:08:46,676
I got it! I got it!

1687
02:08:53,518 --> 02:08:56,144
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1688
02:09:00,358 --> 02:09:03,068
[Dwight] I can't tell
if Miho is alive or dead,

1689
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:08,031
but I'm on my feet and every ounce
of me wants to get some killing done.

1690
02:09:10,827 --> 02:09:15,122
[man] You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1691
02:09:15,206 --> 02:09:17,332
[shooting]

1692
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:22,087
[man] Brave lad.

1693
02:09:22,171 --> 02:09:26,258
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1694
02:09:26,342 --> 02:09:30,137
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1695
02:09:30,221 --> 02:09:34,099
You got the drop on me, love.
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1696
02:09:41,941 --> 02:09:44,901
I got to come clean
with you, sweetheart.

1697
02:09:44,986 --> 02:09:49,990
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1698
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:52,701
You see, I'm not
too fond of shootin'.

1699
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:55,871
It's my preference to blow things up.

1700
02:09:55,955 --> 02:09:58,123
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1701
02:09:58,207 --> 02:10:02,169
and seen all the parts
flying off people,

1702
02:10:02,253 --> 02:10:05,422
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1703
02:10:06,257 --> 02:10:11,803
Here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1704
02:10:11,888 --> 02:10:15,390
But it's me knife
I'll be doing you with.

1705
02:10:15,474 --> 02:10:18,059
You killed me mates.

1706
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:22,606
Someone shoulda told ya: never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1707
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:26,735
[Dwight] Deadly little Miho.

1708
02:10:27,570 --> 02:10:30,322
You won't feel a thing
unless she wants you to.

1709
02:10:30,406 --> 02:10:33,200
- She twists the blade.
- [crunching]

1710
02:10:33,284 --> 02:10:35,076
He feels it.

1711
02:10:37,914 --> 02:10:41,666
I tell Miho what we're gonna do
and how we're gonna do it.

1712
02:10:41,751 --> 02:10:46,213
I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make
the most important call of my life.

1713
02:10:46,297 --> 02:10:51,259
First, we gotta rescue Gail,
then comes the kill.

1714
02:10:51,344 --> 02:10:55,305
The big, fat kill.

1715
02:11:01,103 --> 02:11:03,772
- [gasping]
- [crunching]

1716
02:11:05,608 --> 02:11:08,485
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1717
02:11:08,569 --> 02:11:10,403
What, are you kidding me, man?

1718
02:11:10,488 --> 02:11:14,199
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night and not get tired of it.

1719
02:11:14,283 --> 02:11:15,742
I mean, the man's an artist.

1720
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:20,914
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1721
02:11:20,998 --> 02:11:22,958
Your skin is perfect.

1722
02:11:23,042 --> 02:11:26,169
Your nerves, responsive.

1723
02:11:26,254 --> 02:11:27,587
Beautiful.

1724
02:11:27,672 --> 02:11:30,715
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1725
02:11:31,842 --> 02:11:34,719
[gasping]

1726
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:37,889
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1727
02:11:38,557 --> 02:11:42,269
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1728
02:11:42,353 --> 02:11:44,604
They got what's left
of that cop we killed.

1729
02:11:44,689 --> 02:11:47,774
Mob's gonna turn it over to the chief,
cops'll mow us down.

1730
02:11:47,858 --> 02:11:49,693
We gotta cut a deal.

1731
02:11:49,777 --> 02:11:53,363
You little bitch! You sold us out!

1732
02:11:53,447 --> 02:11:56,449
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1733
02:11:56,534 --> 02:12:00,745
You gotta cut a deal with these people.
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1734
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:03,623
You'll get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1735
02:12:03,708 --> 02:12:06,209
It wasn't your mom!

1736
02:12:06,294 --> 02:12:09,421
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1737
02:12:09,505 --> 02:12:12,215
It was the money,
you stupid little bitch!

1738
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:16,136
Sure, there's money. Sure, you
could've moved my mom into Old Town

1739
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:19,014
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1740
02:12:19,098 --> 02:12:21,224
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1741
02:12:21,309 --> 02:12:26,062
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me: a way out.

1742
02:12:26,147 --> 02:12:28,023
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1743
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:29,774
Your neck.

1744
02:12:29,859 --> 02:12:33,987
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1745
02:12:34,071 --> 02:12:36,531
[Becky screams]

1746
02:12:38,200 --> 02:12:42,287
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1747
02:12:43,873 --> 02:12:47,334
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1748
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:51,338
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1749
02:12:51,422 --> 02:12:54,299
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1750
02:12:54,383 --> 02:12:57,886
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1751
02:12:59,847 --> 02:13:04,100
Hey.

1752
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:06,561
Nobody. I don't see nobody.

1753
02:13:06,645 --> 02:13:10,398
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1754
02:13:10,483 --> 02:13:13,360
There's something wrapped around it.

1755
02:13:13,444 --> 02:13:16,112
- Some kind of note.
- [Manute] Give it to me.

1756
02:13:17,573 --> 02:13:20,408
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1757
02:13:21,911 --> 02:13:26,456
- It's starting to hurt.
- Out back. Everyone. Bring the women.

1758
02:13:26,540 --> 02:13:29,709
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1759
02:13:29,794 --> 02:13:32,462
McCarthy, you fool.

1760
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,423
Hey.

1761
02:13:36,258 --> 02:13:37,717
Guys?

1762
02:13:39,762 --> 02:13:41,429
Oh...

1763
02:13:41,514 --> 02:13:43,223
[thunder crashes]

1764
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:48,561
[Dwight] Dozens of them,
armed to the teeth.

1765
02:13:48,646 --> 02:13:52,816
I'm outnumbered, outgunned.

1766
02:13:52,900 --> 02:13:58,488
But the alley is crooked,
dark and very narrow.

1767
02:13:58,572 --> 02:14:01,199
They can't surround me.

1768
02:14:01,283 --> 02:14:06,454
Sometimes, you can beat the odds with
the careful choice of where to fight.

1769
02:14:10,501 --> 02:14:13,002
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1770
02:14:13,087 --> 02:14:17,924
- Just give me the woman.
- [muffled talking]

1771
02:14:18,008 --> 02:14:20,009
Shut up.

1772
02:14:20,094 --> 02:14:22,887
Dwight, don't do this.

1773
02:14:22,972 --> 02:14:27,559
- Wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1774
02:14:27,643 --> 02:14:32,814
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade. She's all yours.

1775
02:14:41,699 --> 02:14:46,536
Now, if you'll explain to me why we
shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1776
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:50,623
Dwight, what have you done?

1777
02:14:50,708 --> 02:14:52,500
Exactly what I had to.

1778
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:56,671
Every step of the way.

1779
02:14:59,175 --> 02:15:02,260
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1780
02:15:02,344 --> 02:15:04,471
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1781
02:15:16,734 --> 02:15:19,319
[Dwight] Where to fight
counts for a lot.

1782
02:15:19,403 --> 02:15:23,907
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you no good.

1783
02:15:23,991 --> 02:15:28,077
But there's nothing like having
your friends show up with lots of guns.

1784
02:15:28,162 --> 02:15:31,039
No! McCarthy, you shit!

1785
02:15:33,542 --> 02:15:36,294
The girls all know the score.

1786
02:15:37,505 --> 02:15:39,297
No escape,

1787
02:15:39,381 --> 02:15:43,051
no surrender, no mercy.

1788
02:15:43,135 --> 02:15:47,305
We gotta kill every last
rat bastard one of 'em.

1789
02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:49,599
Every last one.

1790
02:15:49,683 --> 02:15:53,895
Not for revenge,
not because they deserve it,

1791
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:56,856
not because it'll make
the world a better place.

1792
02:15:57,983 --> 02:16:00,151
We need a heap of bloody bodies

1793
02:16:00,236 --> 02:16:04,239
so when mob boss Wallenquist looks over
his charts of profits and losses,

1794
02:16:04,323 --> 02:16:08,660
he'll see what it cost him
to mess with the girls of Old Town.

1795
02:16:18,087 --> 02:16:19,629
They run out back.

1796
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:23,091
Right on schedule.

1797
02:16:35,271 --> 02:16:37,981
Deadly, little Miho.

1798
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:42,610
She gets her practice in.

1799
02:16:42,695 --> 02:16:45,863
The Valkyrie at my side
is shouting and laughing

1800
02:16:45,948 --> 02:16:51,327
with the pure, hateful,
bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,

1801
02:16:51,412 --> 02:16:53,746
and so am I.

1802
02:16:58,794 --> 02:17:03,339
The fire, baby.
It'll burn us both.

1803
02:17:03,424 --> 02:17:07,719
There's no place in this world
for our kind of fire,

1804
02:17:07,803 --> 02:17:12,140
my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.

1805
02:17:12,224 --> 02:17:15,101
You'll always be mine.

1806
02:17:15,185 --> 02:17:19,147
Always... and never.
