1
00:00:32,675 --> 00:00:36,305
<i>She shivers in the wind</i>
<i>like the last leaf on a dying tree.</i>

2
00:00:40,455 --> 00:00:43,015
<i>I let her hear my footsteps.</i>

3
00:00:45,525 --> 00:00:48,325
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment.</i>

4
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:51,195
Care for a smoke?

5
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:57,065
Sure.
I'll take one.

6
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:59,695
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

7
00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:05,135
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

8
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:09,705
I've watched you for days.

9
00:01:10,785 --> 00:01:14,545
You're everything a man could ever want.

10
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:17,085
It's not just your face,

11
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:21,755
your figure, or your voice.

12
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:26,795
It's your eyes.

13
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:31,535
All the things I see in your eyes.

14
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:36,205
What is it you see in my eyes?

15
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:43,445
I see a crazy calm.

16
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:47,185
You're sick of running.

17
00:01:49,525 --> 00:01:52,485
You're ready to face what you have to face.

18
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:56,445
But you don't want to face it alone.

19
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:58,495
No.

20
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,755
I don't want to face it alone.

21
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:11,445
<i>The wind rises electric.</i>

22
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:15,175
<i>She's soft and warm</i>
<i>and almost weightless.</i>

23
00:02:15,275 --> 00:02:19,235
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise</i>
<i>that brings tears to my eyes.</i>

24
00:02:20,785 --> 00:02:23,315
<i>I tell her that everything will be all right.</i>

25
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:30,095
<i>That I'll save her from whatever</i>
<i>she's scared of and take her far, Far away.</i>

26
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:36,435
<i>I tell her I love her.</i>

27
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:43,335
<i>The silencer</i>
<i>makes a whisper of the gunshot.</i>

28
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:48,245
<i>I hold her close until she's gone.</i>

29
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:53,815
<i>I'll never know</i>
<i>what she was running from.</i>

30
00:02:56,455 --> 00:02:58,445
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning.</i>

31
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:56,065
<i>Just one hour to go.</i>
<i>My last day on the job.</i>

32
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,045
<i>Early retirement.</i>
<i>Not my idea.</i>

33
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:02,045
<i>Doctor's orders.</i>
<i>Heart condition.</i>

34
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,805
<i>"Angina", he calls it.</i>

35
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:09,175
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself</i>
<i>used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.</i>

36
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:12,945
<i>It, and the 30-odd years</i>
<i>of protecting and serving and tears</i>

37
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:17,615
<i>and the blood and terror</i>
<i>and triumph it represents.</i>

38
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:20,825
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile.</i>

39
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:25,695
<i>About the thick, fat steaks</i>
<i>she picked up at the butcher's today.</i>

40
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:29,175
<i>And I'm thinking about</i>
<i>the one loose end I haven't tied up.</i>

41
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:34,205
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere,</i>
<i>helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic.</i>

42
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:43,345
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

43
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:46,715
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

44
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:48,725
Let go of my coat, Bob.

45
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:50,785
You're draggin' me down with you.

46
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:54,295
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

47
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:57,735
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

48
00:05:57,805 --> 00:06:00,235
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

49
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:04,245
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

50
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:06,435
Victim number four!

51
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:09,035
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

52
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,375
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

53
00:06:11,815 --> 00:06:15,375
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

54
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:19,925
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

55
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:22,655
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

56
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:24,715
Settle down and think straight.

57
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,655
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

58
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:31,725
You ain't savin' anyone.

59
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:35,605
You got a great attitude, Bob.

60
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:39,135
Real credit to the force, you are.

61
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:42,835
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

62
00:06:45,785 --> 00:06:47,755
Heck, Bob,

63
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,775
maybe you are right.

64
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:55,185
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

65
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,855
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

66
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:01,595
<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement.</i>

67
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:04,465
<i>Nancy Callahan, age 11.</i>

68
00:07:04,535 --> 00:07:07,025
<i>For all I know, she's dead already.</i>

69
00:07:09,445 --> 00:07:12,005
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

70
00:07:12,075 --> 00:07:14,475
You've been very quiet.

71
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,775
Don't be scared.

72
00:07:16,885 --> 00:07:19,005
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

73
00:07:19,615 --> 00:07:24,115
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

74
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:27,485
He's a very nice man.

75
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:32,695
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where</i>
<i>Weevil said they took her. And it hits.</i>

76
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:35,325
<i>Wicked spot of indigestion.</i>

77
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:37,795
<i>At least that's what I pray it is.</i>

78
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:40,205
... lighthearted
and momentary digression.

79
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:43,175
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

80
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:47,375
For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

81
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:51,885
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

82
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:54,075
<i>Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump -</i>

83
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:58,415
<i>two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs</i>
<i>with delusions of eloquence.</i>

84
00:07:58,825 --> 00:08:01,315
This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet -

85
00:08:01,395 --> 00:08:04,055
temporarily remanded
to our custody though it may be -

86
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:07,355
remains the property
of the son of Senator Roark.

87
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:10,695
<i>Gotta keep this quiet.</i>
<i>Take 'em down fast.</i>

88
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,795
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

89
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,865
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

90
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:18,495
shall surely be athwart us.

91
00:08:27,585 --> 00:08:32,045
<i>Catch your breath.</i>
<i>Give your heart time to slow down.</i>

92
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,145
<i>But it won't slow down.</i>

93
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,255
<i>Get over it.</i>

94
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,525
<i>She needs you.</i>

95
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:42,325
We're all done here, Benny.

96
00:08:42,395 --> 00:08:45,925
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

97
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:47,865
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

98
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:50,275
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

99
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:56,105
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

100
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:59,275
You must be awfully scared now.

101
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:02,755
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

102
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,655
All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk.

103
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:12,555
That's all, just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

104
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,125
Don't you cry now.

105
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:18,255
<i>Doctor said it'd be like this.</i>

106
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,665
<i>Just take the pill he gave you.</i>

107
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:31,705
<i>No need to play it quiet.</i>

108
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:33,805
<i>Not anymore.</i>

109
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:38,915
<i>Breathe steady, old man.</i>
<i>Prove you're not completely useless.</i>

110
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:41,715
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>Go out with a bang.</i>

111
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:43,955
<i>He likes to hear 'em scream.</i>

112
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:46,625
<i>I've seen his victims</i>
<i>and their twisted little faces,</i>

113
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:51,565
<i>all wide-mouthed and bug-eyed, frozen</i>
<i>in their last horrible moment of living.</i>

114
00:09:51,635 --> 00:09:56,295
<i>No screams.</i>
<i>Either I'm just in time, or I'm way too late.</i>

115
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:02,545
Ooh!

116
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:11,015
<i>It's nothing, barely a flesh wound.</i>
<i>On your feet, old man.</i>

117
00:10:17,225 --> 00:10:19,885
Roark.
Give it up.

118
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,265
Let the girl go.

119
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,525
You can't do
a goddamn thing to me, Hartigan.

120
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:26,625
You know who I am.

121
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,935
You know who my father is!

122
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,535
You can't touch me, you piece-of-shit cop.

123
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,435
Look at you. You can't even lift
that cannon you're carrying.

124
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,615
Sure, I can.

125
00:10:47,225 --> 00:10:50,195
Cover your eyes, Nancy.
I don't want you watching this.

126
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:53,255
I mean it, baby.
Cover your eyes right now.

127
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,465
<i>I take his weapons away.</i>

128
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:01,825
<i>Both of them.</i>

129
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,405
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership.</i>

130
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:17,455
For God's sakes,
don't make it any worse.

131
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:22,115
- Don't make me kill you.
- Doin' fine, Bob.

132
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,465
Never better.

133
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,695
I'm ready to kick your ass.

134
00:11:29,465 --> 00:11:31,625
<i>Keep him talking.</i>
<i>Buy time.</i>

135
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:34,365
<i>Just a few more minutes.</i>
<i>Just till the backup gets here.</i>

136
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:38,375
Sit down and stay down.
I'll kill you if I have to.

137
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:42,345
<i>Keep his mind off the girl -</i>
<i>skinny little Nancy.</i>

138
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,175
<i>He can't kill her</i>
<i>once the backup gets here.</i>

139
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:46,805
Run home, Nancy.
Run for your life.

140
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,785
Hey, don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

141
00:11:49,855 --> 00:11:53,155
- What a tough man you are, huh?
- You stay right where you're at.

142
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:56,155
You shoot your partner in the back...

143
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,385
then you try to scare a little girl.

144
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:02,765
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

145
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,995
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

146
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:08,095
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

147
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:11,595
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

148
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:14,435
You'll never be able to stop me.

149
00:12:22,955 --> 00:12:26,485
<i>I finally sit down,</i>
<i>just like you told me to.</i>

150
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:30,315
<i>The sirens are close now.</i>

151
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,695
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

152
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:46,235
<i>Things go dark.</i>
<i>I don't mind much.</i>

153
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:50,745
<i>Getting sleepy.</i>
<i>It's OK.</i>

154
00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:53,115
<i>She'll be safe.</i>

155
00:12:53,215 --> 00:12:55,615
<i>An old man dies.</i>

156
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:58,285
<i>A little girl lives.</i>

157
00:12:58,355 --> 00:13:00,385
<i>Fair trade.</i>

158
00:13:05,325 --> 00:13:07,695
<i>The night is hot as hell.</i>

159
00:13:07,765 --> 00:13:11,065
<i>It's a lousy room</i>
<i>in a lousy part of a lousy town.</i>

160
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,735
<i>I'm staring at a goddess.</i>

161
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,235
<i>She's telling me she wants me.</i>

162
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:21,145
<i>I'm not gonna waste one more second</i>
<i>wondering how I've gotten so lucky.</i>

163
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:22,805
I want you.

164
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,415
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

165
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:34,055
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

166
00:13:38,665 --> 00:13:39,925
<i>The goddess.</i>

167
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,535
I need you.

168
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,935
<i>Goldie.</i>

169
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,445
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

170
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:04,845
<i>Three hours later and my head</i>
<i>is feeling several sizes too big.</i>

171
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:08,045
<i>And that cold thing</i>
<i>happens to my stomach.</i>

172
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:12,225
<i>And I realize Goldie's dead.</i>
<i>Not a mark on her.</i>

173
00:14:12,295 --> 00:14:15,625
<i>You'd have to check her pulse</i>
<i>or notice those perfect breasts of hers</i>

174
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,465
<i>aren't moving like they would</i>
<i>if she was breathing.</i>

175
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,405
<i>She was murdered</i>
<i>and I was right here when it happened.</i>

176
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:25,905
<i>Lying next to her,</i>
<i>stone drunk, just like she was.</i>

177
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:30,405
<i>Damn it, Goldie. Who were you</i>
<i>and who wanted you dead?</i>

178
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,915
<i>Who were you</i>
<i>besides an angel of mercy,</i>

179
00:14:32,985 --> 00:14:36,315
<i>giving a two-time loser like me</i>
<i>the night of his life?</i>

180
00:14:36,385 --> 00:14:39,185
<i>It sure as hell wasn't my looks.</i>

181
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,195
<i>So why the sleazy saloon?</i>

182
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,625
<i>Why the kindness, Goldie?</i>

183
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:50,325
<i>The cops - they're telling me too much.</i>

184
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:52,305
<i>Showing up before anybody</i>
<i>but me and the killer</i>

185
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:54,595
<i>could know there's been a murder.</i>

186
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:58,195
<i>Somebody paid good money</i>
<i>for this frame.</i>

187
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,975
<i>No reason at all to play it quiet.</i>

188
00:15:01,045 --> 00:15:04,175
<i>No reason to play it any way but my way.</i>

189
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:11,745
<i>Whoever killed you is gonna pay, Goldie.</i>

190
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,825
Open up, police!

191
00:15:18,895 --> 00:15:20,655
I'll be right out.

192
00:15:50,195 --> 00:15:52,555
<i>I don't know why you died, Goldie.</i>

193
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:59,665
<i>I don't know why and I don't know how</i>
<i>I never even met you before tonight.</i>

194
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:03,505
<i>But you were a friend and more</i>
<i>when I needed one.</i>

195
00:16:03,575 --> 00:16:06,265
<i>And when I find out who did it,</i>

196
00:16:06,345 --> 00:16:09,435
<i>it won't be quick and quiet</i>
<i>like it was with you.</i>

197
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:13,205
<i>It'll be loud and nasty - my kind of kill.</i>

198
00:16:13,315 --> 00:16:16,285
<i>And when his eyes go dead,</i>
<i>the hell I send him to</i>

199
00:16:16,355 --> 00:16:19,945
<i>will seem like heaven</i>
<i>after what I've done to him.</i>

200
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:21,425
<i>I love you, Goldie.</i>

201
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,785
Claire?

202
00:16:55,155 --> 00:16:59,095
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

203
00:16:59,165 --> 00:17:04,095
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

204
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:08,295
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

205
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,065
No.

206
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,705
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

207
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,075
Thanks.
You're the best.

208
00:17:15,575 --> 00:17:17,705
<i>Lucille's my parole officer.</i>

209
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,975
<i>She's a dyke, but God knows why.</i>

210
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:23,575
<i>With that body of hers</i>
<i>she could have any man she wants.</i>

211
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:26,785
<i>The pills come from a girlfriend</i>
<i>who's a shrink.</i>

212
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:30,655
<i>She tried to analyze me once</i>
<i>but she got too scared.</i>

213
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:34,795
Haven't seen you like this in a while.

214
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:38,325
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

215
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:42,965
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

216
00:17:43,035 --> 00:17:45,805
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

217
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,905
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

218
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:51,645
This isn't some barroom brawl.

219
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:54,915
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

220
00:17:55,015 --> 00:17:56,575
Hey, hey.
This is big.

221
00:17:56,685 --> 00:18:00,385
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

222
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,445
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

223
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:08,025
This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

224
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:11,225
They're back.
There's no choices left.

225
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,095
And I'm ready for war.

226
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:15,665
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

227
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:17,175
Ah.

228
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:21,305
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

229
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,445
But I'm out now.

230
00:18:24,545 --> 00:18:28,035
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

231
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:32,175
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

232
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:39,025
<i>So you were scared,</i>
<i>weren't you, Goldie?</i>

233
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:41,755
<i>Somebody wanted you dead</i>
<i>and you knew it.</i>

234
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:44,595
<i>So you hit the saloons. The bad places,</i>

235
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,965
<i>looking for the biggest,</i>
<i>meanest lug around and finding me.</i>

236
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,705
<i>Well, I'm gonna find</i>
<i>that son of a bitch that killed you,</i>

237
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,675
<i>and I'm gonna give him the hard goodbye.</i>

238
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:59,005
<i>Walk down</i>
<i>the right back alley in Sin City...</i>

239
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:02,245
- Leave your hands off Nancy.
<i>... and you could find anything.</i>

240
00:19:02,355 --> 00:19:05,045
That coat looks like Baghdad.

241
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:08,685
So does your face.
Take off!

242
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:16,525
He's new here, Marv.
He didn't know.

243
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:19,035
<i>Kadie's is my kind of joint.</i>

244
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:26,275
<i>Nancy's just getting started with her gig,</i>
<i>but already the crowd's breathing hard.</i>

245
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,505
<i>Plenty of nights I've drooled over Nancy,</i>

246
00:19:28,575 --> 00:19:32,345
<i>shoulder to shoulder</i>
<i>with all the other losers like me.</i>

247
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:35,875
<i>But that's not what I'm lookin' for tonight.</i>

248
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,385
What'll it be, Marv?

249
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:41,355
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

250
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:45,085
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

251
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,875
<i>Most people think Marv is crazy.</i>

252
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:06,675
<i>He just had the rotten luck</i>
<i>of being born in the wrong century.</i>

253
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:09,215
<i>He'd be right at home</i>
<i>on some ancient battlefield,</i>

254
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:11,685
<i>swinging an ax into somebody's face.</i>

255
00:20:12,185 --> 00:20:16,685
<i>Or in a Roman arena</i>
<i>taking a sword to other gladiators like him.</i>

256
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:20,665
<i>They'd have tossed him girls</i>
<i>like Nancy back then.</i>

257
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:26,235
Show's over, dickwad.
Drink up.

258
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:29,205
Now, that's one fine-looking coat
you're wearing there.

259
00:20:32,205 --> 00:20:36,905
Your killin' days are over,
you over-the-hill, do-gooder son of a bitch.

260
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:41,975
<i>I love hit men. No matter what</i>
<i>you do to them, you don't feel bad.</i>

261
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:52,425
- Take it off.
- What?

262
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:54,925
A fine coat like that,
and you're bleeding all over it.

263
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,485
All right, it's all yours.
Oh, God!

264
00:20:57,565 --> 00:21:01,095
It wasn't you losers who killed Goldie.

265
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:05,635
The guy who did that,
he knew what he was doing.

266
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,975
So tell me, man.
Who sent you?

267
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,345
I don't hear you giving me any names.

268
00:21:14,455 --> 00:21:18,015
So I guess when I shot you in the belly
I aimed a little too high.

269
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:25,795
You keep holding out on me like this,
and I'm gonna have to get really nasty.

270
00:21:29,595 --> 00:21:34,465
It was Telly...
Telly Stern passed me the order.

271
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:38,465
He runs the tables over
to the Triple Ace Club.

272
00:21:39,405 --> 00:21:41,905
Thanks again.

273
00:21:47,215 --> 00:21:49,115
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens.</i>

274
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:53,315
<i>For a second, I smell the angel smell</i>
<i>that belonged to my Goldie.</i>

275
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,885
<i>Just need my medicine, is all.</i>

276
00:21:56,395 --> 00:21:58,085
Bastard.

277
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:01,255
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

278
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:05,825
Feel like talking, Louie?

279
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:08,395
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

280
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:10,235
How many for the kill?

281
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:12,905
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

282
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:17,505
He'll never talk.

283
00:22:20,515 --> 00:22:23,715
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

284
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:28,925
<i>Connelly talks.</i>
<i>They all talk.</i>

285
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:32,125
And what have been
your sins, my son?

286
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:34,755
Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

287
00:22:34,835 --> 00:22:37,895
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

288
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,955
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

289
00:22:41,035 --> 00:22:43,165
You're speaking figuratively.

290
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:47,835
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

291
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:50,405
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

292
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:53,675
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

293
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:59,655
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

294
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:01,085
Tortured 'em first.

295
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:05,495
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

296
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:08,365
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

297
00:23:08,435 --> 00:23:13,305
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

298
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:16,095
Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

299
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:19,935
Just give me a damn name.

300
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:23,345
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

301
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:26,385
feeding me garbage like that.

302
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:27,645
It can't be that big.

303
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:30,045
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

304
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:33,055
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

305
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,095
And while you're at it,

306
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:40,525
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

307
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:43,025
<i>Worth dying for.</i>

308
00:23:43,095 --> 00:23:45,125
<i>Worth killing for.</i>

309
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:47,565
<i>Worth going to hell for.</i>

310
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,575
Amen.

311
00:23:53,075 --> 00:23:56,015
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes,</i>

312
00:23:56,075 --> 00:23:59,575
<i>or at least that's what they're</i>
<i>passing off as a Mercedes these days.</i>

313
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:03,745
<i>Modern cars -</i>
<i>they all look like electric shavers.</i>

314
00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:12,025
Goldie.

315
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:15,995
Goldie!

316
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:28,935
It couldn't be Goldie.

317
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:33,315
<i>It's my own fault, and nobody else's,</i>
<i>that I got confused.</i>

318
00:24:33,445 --> 00:24:37,185
<i>I've been having so much fun</i>
<i>I forgot to take my medicine.</i>

319
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:39,185
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there.</i>

320
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,685
<i>Goldie's dead,</i>

321
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:44,715
<i>and that's the whole reason</i>
<i>that I've been doing what I've been doing.</i>

322
00:24:44,795 --> 00:24:48,595
<i>When you got a condition,</i>
<i>it's bad to forget your medicine.</i>

323
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:56,895
<i>The cold thing, it creeps into my gut</i>
<i>and tells me one more time it won't let go.</i>

324
00:24:57,675 --> 00:25:00,265
<i>This is a bad place, this farm.</i>

325
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:02,075
<i>People have died here...</i>

326
00:25:03,915 --> 00:25:05,545
<i>... the wrong way.</i>

327
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:10,255
I don't want to fight, pooch.

328
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:16,085
I got no gripe with you.

329
00:25:18,495 --> 00:25:20,295
Easy, boy.

330
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:26,235
<i>No way I was gonna use</i>
<i>my gun on you, buddy.</i>

331
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:29,035
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about,</i>

332
00:25:29,105 --> 00:25:33,165
<i>because there's blood on your breath,</i>
<i>and I think I know what kind.</i>

333
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,975
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried.</i>

334
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,385
Here we go.

335
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:49,785
<i>It's impossible.</i>
<i>Nobody can sneak up on me.</i>

336
00:25:55,435 --> 00:26:00,235
<i>I go blind.</i>
<i>Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet.</i>

337
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:03,935
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck</i>
<i>into that hotel room two nights ago.</i>

338
00:26:04,345 --> 00:26:07,965
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

339
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:10,575
You killed Goldie.

340
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,305
It was...

341
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:15,445
<i>I blew it, Goldie.</i>

342
00:26:16,115 --> 00:26:18,615
<i>I found your killer,</i>
<i>but he was better than me.</i>

343
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,285
<i>Too quiet, too quick.</i>

344
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:23,845
<i>A killer born.</i>

345
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:26,415
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

346
00:26:39,445 --> 00:26:43,175
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

347
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:46,615
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

348
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:51,545
The wolf just gets scraps.

349
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,585
Bones.

350
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:56,025
It's him.

351
00:26:56,095 --> 00:27:00,525
He eats people.

352
00:27:01,435 --> 00:27:04,955
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

353
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:07,295
Just like they were steaks.

354
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,705
Now he's got both of us.

355
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:13,005
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

356
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:16,645
Just look at the heads on the wall.

357
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:18,835
The heads on the wall.

358
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,485
The heads on the wall.

359
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:25,525
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

360
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:29,755
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

361
00:27:30,225 --> 00:27:32,555
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

362
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:37,565
He made me watch!

363
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:47,445
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

364
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:52,045
<i>Dames.</i>
<i>Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out.</i>

365
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:55,445
<i>And a few buckets later,</i>
<i>there's no way you'd know.</i>

366
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:58,145
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

367
00:27:58,255 --> 00:28:02,815
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

368
00:28:02,895 --> 00:28:05,125
Any leads?

369
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:08,925
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

370
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:13,835
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

371
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:17,535
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

372
00:28:17,605 --> 00:28:19,735
The dead one.

373
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:22,005
Goldie.

374
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,545
I didn't know she was a hooker.

375
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:27,775
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

376
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:34,515
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

377
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:36,255
She must have shown you quite a time.

378
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:38,485
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

379
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:44,865
Kevin!

380
00:28:45,865 --> 00:28:49,665
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name.</i>

381
00:28:49,735 --> 00:28:51,735
I'll see you later, Kevin.

382
00:29:01,685 --> 00:29:02,775
Let's go.

383
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:21,505
They're done checking the house.

384
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:23,595
They're coming this way.

385
00:29:23,675 --> 00:29:26,765
Bastards.
I'll show them.

386
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:35,945
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

387
00:29:36,055 --> 00:29:38,785
No, don't shoot!
Please.

388
00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:41,115
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

389
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:43,655
He's unconscious and unarmed,

390
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:46,715
so there's no need to kill him.

391
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,235
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

392
00:29:55,305 --> 00:29:56,535
Here's a sign!

393
00:30:11,325 --> 00:30:15,055
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

394
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:26,295
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed</i>
<i>and what he told me.</i>

395
00:30:26,365 --> 00:30:29,165
<i>I was pretty steamed about</i>
<i>what he'd done to Lucille,</i>

396
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,795
<i>so I took my time</i>
<i>with that son of a bitch.</i>

397
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:36,145
<i>It wasn't till I showed him</i>
<i>all those pieces of himself that he said it.</i>

398
00:30:36,715 --> 00:30:41,875
<i>Just a name -</i>
<i>Patrick Henry Roark, man of the cloth.</i>

399
00:30:41,985 --> 00:30:45,045
<i>Could've become president,</i>
<i>but he chose to serve God.</i>

400
00:30:45,155 --> 00:30:49,685
<i>Along the way, he happened to become</i>
<i>the most powerful man in the state.</i>

401
00:30:49,755 --> 00:30:53,695
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors</i>
<i>like they were nothing.</i>

402
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:57,355
<i>He even made his rotten brother</i>
<i>a US senator without breaking a sweat.</i>

403
00:30:57,935 --> 00:31:02,425
<i>And here he's gonna get killed</i>
<i>in the name of a dead hooker.</i>

404
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:07,405
<i>I'm getting used to the idea.</i>
<i>More and more, I'm liking the sound of it.</i>

405
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:12,605
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts.</i>

406
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,585
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

407
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:16,515
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

408
00:31:16,585 --> 00:31:18,745
<i>I get confused sometimes.</i>

409
00:31:18,825 --> 00:31:22,755
<i>And with Lucille dead,</i>
<i>I can't get my medicine.</i>

410
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:25,025
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

411
00:31:25,095 --> 00:31:30,395
<i>What if I've finally turned into what</i>
<i>they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

412
00:31:30,465 --> 00:31:32,865
<i>A maniac.</i>

413
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,335
<i>A psycho killer.</i>

414
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:38,535
<i>Can't kill a man</i>
<i>without knowing for sure you ought to.</i>

415
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,635
<i>I've gotta know for sure.</i>

416
00:31:43,715 --> 00:31:48,205
<i>The merchandise is on display</i>
<i>by the time I make my way to Old Town.</i>

417
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:51,045
<i>For an hour or so,</i>
<i>I asked around about Goldie.</i>

418
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,915
<i>I don't get any answers,</i>
<i>but I know I'm bound to.</i>

419
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:56,115
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker,</i>

420
00:31:56,195 --> 00:31:58,955
<i>and if she was, she has roots here -</i>

421
00:31:59,025 --> 00:32:01,865
<i>friends, maybe even family.</i>

422
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:09,665
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

423
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:20,705
Ha.

424
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:24,115
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

425
00:32:24,185 --> 00:32:28,245
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

426
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,885
No wonder I'm seeing things.

427
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:32,425
Bastard!

428
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,065
He's crazy.

429
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:43,195
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

430
00:32:44,845 --> 00:32:47,245
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

431
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,645
Because that's my name, you ape.

432
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:54,685
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

433
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:57,115
I guess she was the nice one.

434
00:33:03,295 --> 00:33:06,925
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

435
00:33:06,995 --> 00:33:08,985
What did you do to them?

436
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,535
You crazy goddamn broad.

437
00:33:11,605 --> 00:33:13,595
Just take a look at this mug.

438
00:33:13,665 --> 00:33:17,865
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

439
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:21,565
None of you would, but Goldie.

440
00:33:21,645 --> 00:33:24,805
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

441
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:30,145
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

442
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:35,315
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

443
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:40,825
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

444
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,555
So, go ahead, doll.

445
00:33:44,635 --> 00:33:49,365
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

446
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:58,345
Aw, nuts.

447
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:01,715
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

448
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:07,885
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

449
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:09,825
You sat there and took it,

450
00:34:09,895 --> 00:34:12,865
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

451
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:17,425
Well, sure, I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

452
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:20,765
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

453
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,925
and I don't hurt girls.

454
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,335
I need a pair of handcuffs.

455
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:28,465
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

456
00:34:28,545 --> 00:34:32,505
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

457
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:35,475
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

458
00:34:35,585 --> 00:34:38,955
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

459
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:41,485
I know that sounds crazy.

460
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:44,895
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

461
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:49,485
<i>Just like that, a whopper of a puzzle piece</i>
<i>falls smack in my lap.</i>

462
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,965
<i>I'm too dumb to put</i>
<i>the whole picture together yet,</i>

463
00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:56,995
<i>but she fires up two cigarettes and hands</i>
<i>me one, and I taste her lipstick on it.</i>

464
00:34:57,075 --> 00:35:01,605
<i>And suddenly, my heart's pounding</i>
<i>so loud I can't hear anything else.</i>

465
00:35:01,675 --> 00:35:06,235
<i>I want to reach over and touch her</i>
<i>and taste Goldie's sweat one more time.</i>

466
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:08,475
<i>But she isn't Goldie.</i>

467
00:35:08,585 --> 00:35:10,605
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>
<i>This'll do.</i>

468
00:35:10,715 --> 00:35:16,155
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

469
00:35:17,255 --> 00:35:19,625
and a spool of razor wire...

470
00:35:20,765 --> 00:35:24,895
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

471
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:27,965
Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

472
00:35:28,035 --> 00:35:29,565
You can bet your ass.

473
00:35:30,035 --> 00:35:33,945
She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

474
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:37,575
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

475
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:42,815
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

476
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:47,375
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

477
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:50,285
You know, the way I look.

478
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:54,895
<i>I take my mind off her</i>
<i>and I crawl back inside myself.</i>

479
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:57,935
<i>It's almost killing time,</i>
<i>and I'd better get sharp.</i>

480
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:02,235
<i>I check the list -</i>
<i>rubber tubing, gas, saw,</i>

481
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:06,335
<i>gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet,</i>

482
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:08,675
<i>Gladys and my mitts.</i>

483
00:36:08,745 --> 00:36:12,705
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

484
00:36:13,815 --> 00:36:15,345
Keep the engine runnin'.

485
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:20,215
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

486
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:22,225
Kill him for me, Marv.

487
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:26,385
Kill him good.

488
00:36:26,465 --> 00:36:28,225
I won't let you down, Goldie.

489
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:46,335
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen.</i>

490
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:51,015
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack,</i>
<i>and I can guess what kind.</i>

491
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:07,565
Come on, you son of a bitch.

492
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:10,405
<i>Damn, he's slick.</i>

493
00:37:22,515 --> 00:37:24,955
Is that the best you can do, creep?

494
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:30,725
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Get personal, get close. I can take it.</i>

495
00:37:31,895 --> 00:37:36,295
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

496
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:44,935
<i>I try to slow my heart down</i>
<i>and breathe the fire out of my lungs.</i>

497
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:48,675
<i>My muscles make me</i>
<i>a thousand promises of pain to come.</i>

498
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:52,545
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

499
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,175
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

500
00:37:55,285 --> 00:37:58,045
Oh, but I want to...

501
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:02,185
<i>I'm sorry, kid,</i>
<i>but I haven't even started with this creep</i>.

502
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:06,485
<i>And I don't want you watching the rest.</i>
<i>It'll give you nightmares.</i>

503
00:38:06,565 --> 00:38:09,585
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

504
00:38:09,665 --> 00:38:12,865
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

505
00:38:12,935 --> 00:38:15,835
It's all that sawing and tying.

506
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:19,165
It's not as easy as it looks.

507
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:24,545
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

508
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:31,185
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

509
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:36,555
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

510
00:38:40,095 --> 00:38:41,925
Well, what do you know?

511
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:45,355
Look who's here.

512
00:38:45,435 --> 00:38:46,925
Here he comes.

513
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:56,375
That's a good dog.

514
00:38:56,445 --> 00:39:00,475
<i>He doesn't scream,</i>
<i>not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

515
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:03,145
<i>and Kevin's guts</i>
<i>are lying all over the place.</i>

516
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:07,125
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive,</i>
<i>still staring at me.</i>

517
00:39:07,185 --> 00:39:11,355
<i>Not even when I grab the saw</i>
<i>and finish the job.</i>

518
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:14,265
<i>He never screams.</i>

519
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:20,365
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's</i>
<i>and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

520
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:23,875
<i>and meet me at her place.</i>
<i>She says, "Yes", like always.</i>

521
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:26,705
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

522
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:29,745
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

523
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:32,745
<i>There isn't much of anything</i>
<i>Nancy wouldn't do for me.</i>

524
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:35,515
<i>Not since a year back</i>
<i>when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

525
00:39:35,615 --> 00:39:37,945
<i>and I straightened him out but good.</i>

526
00:39:38,025 --> 00:39:41,715
<i>It really gets my goat</i>
<i>when guys rough up dames.</i>

527
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,555
So, what do you want me to do with her?

528
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:48,255
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

529
00:39:48,335 --> 00:39:51,425
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

530
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:54,265
Hell, no.
I like it here.

531
00:39:57,235 --> 00:40:00,075
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab</i>
<i>and stay under the speed limit</i>

532
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:02,445
<i>so as not to get any attention.</i>

533
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:06,785
<i>My head starts to clear.</i>
<i>Things start to make sense.</i>

534
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:08,745
<i>I owe you, Goldie.</i>

535
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:11,215
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up.</i>

536
00:40:11,285 --> 00:40:14,255
<i>So, if going after Roark</i>
<i>means dying, win or lose -</i>

537
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:18,855
<i>hell, I'll die laughing</i>
<i>if I know I've done this one thing right.</i>

538
00:40:23,535 --> 00:40:26,095
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

539
00:40:26,165 --> 00:40:28,895
<i>All right, keep a lookout.</i>

540
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:48,115
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

541
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,415
The dog ate the rest.

542
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:03,295
Oh, my God.
You monster.

543
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:06,175
You demon.

544
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:08,705
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

545
00:41:09,445 --> 00:41:14,935
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

546
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:18,915
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

547
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:24,655
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

548
00:41:24,725 --> 00:41:26,995
When he came to me...

549
00:41:28,465 --> 00:41:30,795
he was a tormented boy.

550
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:35,365
Tormented by guilt.

551
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:38,675
I tried to counsel him.

552
00:41:40,205 --> 00:41:44,665
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

553
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:49,845
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

554
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:52,845
What the hell do you know?

555
00:41:52,925 --> 00:41:55,385
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

556
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,395
He didn't just eat their bodies,

557
00:41:58,795 --> 00:42:00,955
he ate their souls.

558
00:42:02,565 --> 00:42:04,965
And I joined in.

559
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:10,395
They were all whores.

560
00:42:11,575 --> 00:42:15,335
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

561
00:42:15,815 --> 00:42:20,835
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

562
00:42:20,945 --> 00:42:23,245
<i>She stayed in public places.</i>

563
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:25,655
<i>And then with you.</i>

564
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,155
<i>You were so convenient.</i>

565
00:42:27,585 --> 00:42:30,495
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night.</i>

566
00:42:30,555 --> 00:42:33,115
Who would believe a thug like you?

567
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:34,785
<i>Kevin killed her.</i>

568
00:42:34,865 --> 00:42:38,595
<i>I ordered the police in for you,</i>
<i>but you wouldn't be caught.</i>

569
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:40,135
<i>You wouldn't stop.</i>

570
00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:43,135
And now he's dead and you're here to...

571
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,645
eliminate me.

572
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,905
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

573
00:42:52,685 --> 00:42:57,645
Killing a helpless old fart?

574
00:42:58,655 --> 00:43:00,515
The killing, no.

575
00:43:00,585 --> 00:43:03,385
No satisfaction.

576
00:43:04,255 --> 00:43:08,055
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

577
00:43:11,435 --> 00:43:13,195
Kevin...

578
00:43:15,675 --> 00:43:17,835
we're going home.

579
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:24,035
You can scream now if you want to.

580
00:43:31,585 --> 00:43:36,385
<i>It's beautiful, Goldie.</i>
<i>It's just like I promised, only better.</i>

581
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:37,985
<i>And when his eyes go dead,</i>

582
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:42,295
<i>the hell I sent him to must seem like</i>
<i>heaven after what I've done to him.</i>

583
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:45,355
- Freeze!
- Oh, my God!

584
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:54,735
<i>Jerks.</i>

585
00:43:54,815 --> 00:43:58,615
<i>They should've shot me in the head,</i>
<i>and enough times to make sure.</i>

586
00:43:58,715 --> 00:44:00,475
<i>It's so stupid.</i>

587
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:04,515
<i>Everybody knows what's coming,</i>
<i>but they go through the motions anyway.</i>

588
00:44:04,615 --> 00:44:06,785
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

589
00:44:07,425 --> 00:44:11,325
<i>Months fall off the calendar</i>
<i>while I breathe and eat through tubes.</i>

590
00:44:11,395 --> 00:44:15,295
<i>Night after night, I wait for somebody</i>
<i>to come and finish me off.</i>

591
00:44:15,365 --> 00:44:19,195
<i>After a while,</i>
<i>I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that.</i>

592
00:44:20,165 --> 00:44:21,825
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

593
00:44:21,905 --> 00:44:24,835
<i>before the cops kick them out</i>
<i>from under me.</i>

594
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:26,935
<i>They don't ask me any questions.</i>

595
00:44:27,005 --> 00:44:31,465
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of</i>
<i>me and waving a confession in my face.</i>

596
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,575
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

597
00:44:33,685 --> 00:44:37,205
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies</i>
<i>they come up with.</i>

598
00:44:37,315 --> 00:44:41,775
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant</i>
<i>district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

599
00:44:41,895 --> 00:44:46,325
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession,</i>
<i>they'll kill my mom.</i>

600
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,855
<i>I break his arm in three places</i>
<i>and I sign it.</i>

601
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:53,025
<i>From then on,</i>
<i>it's the circus everybody wants it to be.</i>

602
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:57,505
<i>They nail me for the works -</i>
<i>not just the people I did kill,</i>

603
00:44:57,575 --> 00:45:01,805
<i>but even Lucille and the girls</i>
<i>that Roark and Kevin ate,</i>

604
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,275
<i>and even Goldie.</i>

605
00:45:04,945 --> 00:45:09,545
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone</i>
<i>when she hands down the sentence.</i>

606
00:45:10,615 --> 00:45:13,585
<i>Midnight and my death</i>
<i>are only a few hours away,</i>

607
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:16,855
<i>when I get my first surprise in 18 months.</i>

608
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,865
<i>My only visitor.</i>

609
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:23,925
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent.</i>

610
00:45:23,995 --> 00:45:27,125
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

611
00:45:32,275 --> 00:45:34,905
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

612
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:38,205
I... I got confused again.

613
00:45:38,285 --> 00:45:40,905
Just seeing you like this.

614
00:45:43,255 --> 00:45:45,815
You can call me Goldie.

615
00:45:54,935 --> 00:45:57,955
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell.</i>

616
00:45:58,035 --> 00:46:00,665
<i>The perfect woman.</i>

617
00:46:00,735 --> 00:46:02,535
<i>The goddess.</i>

618
00:46:03,835 --> 00:46:06,035
<i>Goldie.</i>

619
00:46:06,105 --> 00:46:08,705
<i>She says her name is Goldie.</i>

620
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:14,875
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak</i>
<i>for my last meal.</i>

621
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:19,475
<i>They even throw in a brew.</i>
<i>It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's.</i>

622
00:46:19,585 --> 00:46:24,255
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me</i>
<i>with a rubber diaper and get to it.</i>

623
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:27,195
<i>And it's about damned time,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

624
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,825
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

625
00:46:29,895 --> 00:46:32,625
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

626
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:35,395
You heard the man.
Hit it.

627
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:47,705
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

628
00:47:00,895 --> 00:47:02,025
He's gone.

629
00:47:20,415 --> 00:47:22,045
Forget it, man.

630
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:24,205
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

631
00:47:24,315 --> 00:47:26,845
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in.

632
00:47:26,955 --> 00:47:30,395
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

633
00:47:30,455 --> 00:47:34,795
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

634
00:47:34,865 --> 00:47:36,665
Ha. It meant plenty.

635
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:39,965
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

636
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,665
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

637
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,325
I know you're angry, baby.

638
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:47,565
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

639
00:47:47,645 --> 00:47:49,475
There's a difference
between getting honked off

640
00:47:49,545 --> 00:47:51,275
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

641
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:55,505
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

642
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:58,145
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

643
00:47:58,255 --> 00:48:00,945
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

644
00:48:01,025 --> 00:48:03,925
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

645
00:48:03,995 --> 00:48:06,965
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

646
00:48:07,025 --> 00:48:09,425
That hurt, Shellie.

647
00:48:09,495 --> 00:48:15,125
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

648
00:48:15,205 --> 00:48:17,725
I am impossible to get.

649
00:48:17,805 --> 00:48:24,305
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

650
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:27,215
Get help and get lost.

651
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:28,975
Just open the door.

652
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:33,955
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

653
00:48:34,025 --> 00:48:38,115
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

654
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:43,125
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

655
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:46,865
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

656
00:48:46,935 --> 00:48:50,425
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

657
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,635
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

658
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:55,335
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

659
00:48:55,415 --> 00:49:00,345
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

660
00:49:00,445 --> 00:49:05,975
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

661
00:49:07,225 --> 00:49:09,655
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

662
00:49:09,725 --> 00:49:12,855
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

663
00:49:12,925 --> 00:49:15,055
You feel like taking them on?

664
00:49:15,135 --> 00:49:18,195
You are teasing me, baby.

665
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:21,825
Some of my best friends...

666
00:49:21,935 --> 00:49:24,565
But you're really pushing my buttons.

667
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:26,865
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

668
00:49:26,945 --> 00:49:29,775
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

669
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:33,045
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

670
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:36,045
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

671
00:49:36,115 --> 00:49:38,415
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

672
00:49:38,485 --> 00:49:41,475
All right.
All right, all right!

673
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:47,665
Troops, make yourself at home.

674
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:59,395
You brought your whole pack with you?

675
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:02,305
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

676
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:04,035
You're gonna love this, baby.

677
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:06,945
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

678
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:10,505
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

679
00:50:10,615 --> 00:50:12,415
and it's gonna be great.

680
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:14,615
I ain't calling up nobody.

681
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:23,965
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

682
00:50:24,035 --> 00:50:28,405
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

683
00:50:28,465 --> 00:50:31,835
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

684
00:50:31,905 --> 00:50:35,345
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

685
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:39,475
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

686
00:50:39,585 --> 00:50:42,015
'cause you scared him so bad.

687
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:48,215
You think
I have no feelings at all.

688
00:50:48,325 --> 00:50:50,455
If you're gonna slug me,

689
00:50:50,525 --> 00:50:53,555
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

690
00:50:53,625 --> 00:50:57,755
There you go,
lying about me again,

691
00:50:57,835 --> 00:51:00,425
right in front of my friends.

692
00:51:00,505 --> 00:51:03,805
I have never hit a woman in my life.

693
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:11,635
That's showing her, man.

694
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:16,245
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

695
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:19,285
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

696
00:51:19,355 --> 00:51:23,155
- I gotta take a leak.
- Oh!

697
00:51:23,225 --> 00:51:25,695
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

698
00:51:26,095 --> 00:51:29,395
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

699
00:51:29,465 --> 00:51:31,955
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

700
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:35,865
There you go, after my nuts again.

701
00:51:35,935 --> 00:51:38,235
But I forgive you.

702
00:51:38,305 --> 00:51:40,295
I'm a generous guy.

703
00:51:40,375 --> 00:51:44,835
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

704
00:51:44,915 --> 00:51:48,045
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

705
00:51:48,715 --> 00:51:51,615
My temper you don't have to worry about.

706
00:51:52,085 --> 00:51:55,815
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

707
00:51:56,695 --> 00:51:58,595
Ooh.
I've been told.

708
00:52:00,795 --> 00:52:05,565
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

709
00:52:05,635 --> 00:52:08,395
Answer me!

710
00:52:08,465 --> 00:52:10,565
Oh, I don't need this grief.

711
00:52:10,635 --> 00:52:16,505
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

712
00:52:16,575 --> 00:52:21,485
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

713
00:52:21,545 --> 00:52:25,175
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

714
00:52:25,285 --> 00:52:29,745
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

715
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:35,165
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

716
00:52:35,225 --> 00:52:37,595
You didn't flush.

717
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:32,685
Troops, get outta here.

718
00:53:32,785 --> 00:53:34,915
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

719
00:53:34,985 --> 00:53:36,825
Now!

720
00:53:55,575 --> 00:53:57,775
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

721
00:53:57,845 --> 00:54:00,785
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

722
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:03,005
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

723
00:54:03,455 --> 00:54:06,975
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

724
00:54:07,085 --> 00:54:11,085
Dwight, he was from a while back,

725
00:54:11,155 --> 00:54:14,455
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

726
00:54:14,525 --> 00:54:18,295
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

727
00:54:18,365 --> 00:54:20,805
And it was only once.

728
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:22,855
I've done some dumb things.

729
00:54:22,935 --> 00:54:24,925
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

730
00:54:25,005 --> 00:54:27,705
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

731
00:54:27,775 --> 00:54:32,045
But this guy, he's a menace.

732
00:54:32,145 --> 00:54:34,975
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

733
00:54:36,915 --> 00:54:38,575
I'll call you later.

734
00:54:38,685 --> 00:54:40,155
No, don't go!

735
00:54:40,255 --> 00:54:42,555
<i>Shellie shouts something</i>
<i>I can't quite make out</i>

736
00:54:42,625 --> 00:54:45,315
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter.</i>

737
00:54:45,395 --> 00:54:49,055
- Stop!
<i>- It sounds like "stop", but I can't be sure.</i>

738
00:54:49,735 --> 00:54:53,325
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking,</i.
<i>but I can't just go home and forget about it,</i>

739
00:54:53,405 --> 00:54:56,765
<i>and let Jackie Boy and his pals</i>
<i>find their fun.</i>

740
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:02,435
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're</i>
<i>out for blood tonight - a woman's blood.</i>

741
00:55:02,515 --> 00:55:05,805
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

742
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:08,845
You fool.

743
00:55:08,915 --> 00:55:11,185
You damned fool.

744
00:55:11,285 --> 00:55:13,015
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

745
00:55:13,085 --> 00:55:16,645
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading</i>
<i>like a bat outta hell up the hill.</i>

746
00:55:16,725 --> 00:55:18,715
<i>I'm speeding.</i>

747
00:55:18,795 --> 00:55:23,595
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed.</i>
<i>And if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

748
00:55:23,665 --> 00:55:28,035
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from</i>
<i>the fast track to the gas chamber like I am,</i>

749
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:31,235
<i>the last thing you want</i>
<i>is to get noticed.</i>

750
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:37,035
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me</i>
<i>to bribe this cop, and even if I did,</i>

751
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:40,275
<i>there's always the outside chance</i>
<i>he's one of the honest ones.</i>

752
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:45,975
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this,</i>
<i>or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

753
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:50,385
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me</i>
<i>a great, big, steaming pile of trouble.</i>

754
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:53,055
Watch it, Jack!

755
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:00,795
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

756
00:56:00,865 --> 00:56:04,365
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

757
00:56:04,435 --> 00:56:07,495
<i>My gut tightens up.</i>

758
00:56:07,575 --> 00:56:11,945
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us</i>
<i>straight to Old Town.</i>

759
00:56:14,515 --> 00:56:16,385
<i>The cop shuts off his siren.</i>

760
00:56:16,455 --> 00:56:19,715
<i>He knows he's not the law,</i>
<i>not in Old Town.</i>

761
00:56:19,785 --> 00:56:24,055
<i>The ladies are the law here,</i>
<i>beautiful and merciless.</i>

762
00:56:24,125 --> 00:56:26,095
<i>If you've got the cash</i>
<i>and you play by the rules,</i>

763
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:28,565
<i>they'll make all your dreams come true.</i>

764
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:32,425
<i>But if you cross 'em, you're a corpse.</i>

765
00:56:40,675 --> 00:56:43,145
Hey, baby.

766
00:56:46,085 --> 00:56:48,205
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

767
00:56:48,645 --> 00:56:53,105
Aw, sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

768
00:56:53,225 --> 00:56:56,245
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

769
00:56:56,925 --> 00:57:00,295
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

770
00:57:00,365 --> 00:57:02,455
I don't do talk jobs, either.

771
00:57:02,535 --> 00:57:07,595
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

772
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:11,365
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

773
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:13,565
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

774
00:57:13,645 --> 00:57:17,235
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

775
00:57:17,315 --> 00:57:19,715
well...

776
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:22,285
there's only so much a man can take.

777
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:24,515
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

778
00:57:24,615 --> 00:57:26,985
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

779
00:57:27,055 --> 00:57:29,685
The Amigo's a fag joint.

780
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:36,165
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

781
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:41,735
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

782
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:44,365
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

783
00:57:44,435 --> 00:57:46,465
Everything's under control.

784
00:57:47,575 --> 00:57:49,705
Enjoy the show.

785
00:57:49,775 --> 00:57:52,715
<i>There's no use arguing with her.</i>

786
00:57:52,815 --> 00:57:55,685
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers.</i>

787
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:58,745
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

788
00:57:58,815 --> 00:58:01,755
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

789
00:58:02,025 --> 00:58:03,615
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

790
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:07,955
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

791
00:58:08,025 --> 00:58:11,055
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

792
00:58:11,135 --> 00:58:14,155
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

793
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:18,135
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

794
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:20,295
One of them thinks he is.

795
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:22,395
He's outta control.

796
00:58:22,475 --> 00:58:25,915
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

797
00:58:25,985 --> 00:58:29,605
Us helpless little girls.

798
00:58:30,255 --> 00:58:34,275
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit</i>
<i>less than 20 yards ahead of us,</i>

799
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,945
<i>and still it's hard to take my eyes off her.</i>

800
00:58:38,025 --> 00:58:40,755
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

801
00:58:40,825 --> 00:58:43,295
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

802
00:58:43,365 --> 00:58:45,835
from seeing what Miho can do.

803
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:49,895
And she's been aching for some practice.

804
00:58:50,905 --> 00:58:55,635
<i>She guides my glance upwards</i>
<i>to the pixie perched on the roof's edge.</i>

805
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:59,875
<i>- Deadly little Miho.</i>
- You're running out of alley, cowboy.

806
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:04,215
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

807
00:59:04,315 --> 00:59:06,985
You're a sassy little thing.

808
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:11,885
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

809
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:16,025
<i>The trap is set,</i>
<i>locked and ready to spring.</i>

810
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,995
<i>So what? They're scum.</i>
<i>They deserve what's coming.</i>

811
00:59:20,065 --> 00:59:23,435
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut</i>
<i>that something is awfully wrong?</i>

812
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:26,735
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

813
00:59:26,805 --> 00:59:31,505
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

814
00:59:31,575 --> 00:59:33,015
And they won't.

815
00:59:33,085 --> 00:59:35,205
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

816
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:38,775
<i>Something Shellie said.</i>
<i>I can't place it.</i>

817
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:43,115
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

818
00:59:43,195 --> 00:59:46,155
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

819
00:59:46,265 --> 00:59:49,495
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

820
00:59:49,565 --> 00:59:53,395
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

821
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,905
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

822
00:59:58,635 --> 01:00:00,305
You wanna see it?

823
01:00:01,405 --> 01:00:04,865
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

824
01:00:04,945 --> 01:00:09,005
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

825
01:00:10,115 --> 01:00:12,585
You seen this one?

826
01:00:14,555 --> 01:00:16,185
Get in the car.

827
01:00:16,295 --> 01:00:20,925
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

828
01:00:38,145 --> 01:00:39,405
Oh, God, no!

829
01:00:41,515 --> 01:00:43,145
This is crazy!

830
01:00:43,955 --> 01:00:46,575
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

831
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:55,415
Go ahead.

832
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:58,765
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

833
01:00:58,835 --> 01:01:01,195
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

834
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:05,105
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

835
01:01:07,905 --> 01:01:11,745
I got you right where I want you.

836
01:01:11,815 --> 01:01:15,005
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

837
01:01:15,085 --> 01:01:18,575
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

838
01:01:21,785 --> 01:01:23,085
Yeesh.

839
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:32,785
This isn't funny.

840
01:01:33,535 --> 01:01:37,125
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

841
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:39,435
Every one of you is gonna burn.

842
01:01:41,205 --> 01:01:43,435
Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

843
01:01:43,515 --> 01:01:46,815
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

844
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:51,245
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

845
01:01:51,355 --> 01:01:55,155
I told you to shut up.

846
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,325
I can't see.

847
01:02:02,395 --> 01:02:04,425
What's happening?

848
01:02:06,005 --> 01:02:08,405
I can't see.

849
01:02:08,465 --> 01:02:11,195
I can't hear anything.

850
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:14,735
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

851
01:02:14,805 --> 01:02:18,365
Yeah.
Make it quick, will you?

852
01:02:20,685 --> 01:02:23,305
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off.</i>

853
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:29,355
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him.</i>

854
01:02:31,255 --> 01:02:34,855
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching</i>
<i>the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

855
01:02:34,925 --> 01:02:39,195
<i>and going through their pockets,</i>
<i>divvying up cash when they find it.</i>

856
01:02:39,265 --> 01:02:41,325
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants.</i>

857
01:02:41,405 --> 01:02:43,235
<i>His wallet is packed.</i>

858
01:02:43,305 --> 01:02:47,265
<i>Mastercard, Discover,</i>
<i>Platinum American Express,</i>

859
01:02:47,345 --> 01:02:49,605
<i>and nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

860
01:02:49,675 --> 01:02:53,615
<i>that I'm not too proud</i>
<i>to stuff into my own pockets.</i>

861
01:02:53,685 --> 01:02:55,545
<i>Then I find an atom bomb.</i>

862
01:02:58,015 --> 01:03:00,245
<i>Jackie Boy,</i>

863
01:03:00,325 --> 01:03:02,755
<i>you son of a bitch.</i>

864
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:09,855
<i>There was a helicopter</i>
<i>that kicked up such a racket</i>.

865
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:13,095
<i>I couldn't quite make out what she said.</i>

866
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,605
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop".</i>

867
01:03:15,665 --> 01:03:18,295
<i>She said "cop."</i>

868
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,565
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty.</i>

869
01:03:21,645 --> 01:03:24,975
<i>Iron Jack, the papers call him.</i>

870
01:03:25,045 --> 01:03:27,805
<i>A goddamn hero cop.</i>

871
01:03:30,285 --> 01:03:33,155
<i>It's held for years, the shaky truce.</i>

872
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:37,215
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free</i>
<i>entertainment when they throw a party.</i>

873
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:40,125
<i>The girls get to administer</i>
<i>their own brand of justice.</i>

874
01:03:40,665 --> 01:03:45,185
<i>They get to defend their own turf.</i>
<i>If a cop blunders into the neighborhood</i>

875
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:49,665
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls</i>
<i>are selling. They send him packing,</i>

876
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:52,395
<i>but they send him back alive.</i>

877
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:54,605
<i>That's the rules.</i>

878
01:03:54,675 --> 01:03:56,575
<i>That's the truce.</i>

879
01:03:56,645 --> 01:03:59,165
<i>The cops stay out.</i>

880
01:03:59,235 --> 01:04:02,365
<i>That keeps the girls free</i>
<i>to keep the pimps and the mob out.</i>

881
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:05,435
<i>Old Town will be left wide open.</i>

882
01:04:05,545 --> 01:04:07,445
<i>It'll be war.</i>

883
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:11,005
<i>The streets will run red with blood -</i>

884
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:13,415
<i>women's blood.</i>

885
01:04:13,485 --> 01:04:15,925
The cops!
The mob!

886
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:18,685
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

887
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:22,625
The hell they will!
We got guns.

888
01:04:22,695 --> 01:04:24,785
We'll fight the cops and the mob

889
01:04:24,865 --> 01:04:28,305
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

890
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,995
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

891
01:04:30,065 --> 01:04:33,365
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

892
01:04:33,435 --> 01:04:36,605
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

893
01:04:36,705 --> 01:04:38,075
I'll hide the bodies.

894
01:04:38,175 --> 01:04:41,635
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

895
01:04:41,745 --> 01:04:44,235
The cops know Rafferty came here.

896
01:04:44,355 --> 01:04:47,375
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

897
01:04:47,455 --> 01:04:49,355
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

898
01:04:49,425 --> 01:04:52,325
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

899
01:04:52,395 --> 01:04:54,295
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

900
01:04:54,365 --> 01:04:58,555
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

901
01:04:58,635 --> 01:05:01,225
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

902
01:05:01,305 --> 01:05:04,035
You got what you wanted out of me!

903
01:05:04,105 --> 01:05:07,735
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

904
01:05:07,805 --> 01:05:12,035
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

905
01:05:12,145 --> 01:05:14,845
<i>Miho moves to my back.</i>

906
01:05:16,485 --> 01:05:19,045
<i>One word from Gail</i>
<i>and she'll cut me in half.</i>

907
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:22,785
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

908
01:05:22,855 --> 01:05:26,085
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

909
01:05:26,155 --> 01:05:28,885
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

910
01:05:28,965 --> 01:05:32,925
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

911
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,265
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

912
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:37,925
Get that gun out of my face now!

913
01:05:40,575 --> 01:05:42,375
Bastard!

914
01:05:47,115 --> 01:05:49,345
I forgot how quick you are.

915
01:05:51,355 --> 01:05:53,015
<i>My warrior woman.</i>

916
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:55,715
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off,</i>

917
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,015
<i>shoving my mouth into hers</i>
<i>so hard it hurts.</i>

918
01:05:59,095 --> 01:06:02,525
<i>An explosion that blasts away</i>
<i>the dull, gray years</i>

919
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:06,895
<i>between the now and that one fiery night</i>
<i>when she was mine.</i>

920
01:06:07,765 --> 01:06:10,565
A hardtop with a decent engine.

921
01:06:10,635 --> 01:06:13,005
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

922
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:18,235
I'll always love you, baby.

923
01:06:18,345 --> 01:06:22,215
Always... and never.

924
01:06:30,225 --> 01:06:32,315
Where'd you find that heap?

925
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:35,915
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

926
01:06:35,995 --> 01:06:39,525
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

927
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:41,585
you think maybe I could go home?

928
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:45,835
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

929
01:06:45,905 --> 01:06:48,105
Sure, Becky, go home.

930
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:50,975
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

931
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:53,975
They'll never fit in that trunk.

932
01:06:54,045 --> 01:06:57,815
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

933
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:00,215
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

934
01:07:00,285 --> 01:07:02,415
You'll catch cold if you don't.

935
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:12,255
Yeesh.

936
01:07:14,165 --> 01:07:16,765
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

937
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:20,605
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

938
01:07:20,675 --> 01:07:23,305
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

939
01:07:25,845 --> 01:07:27,365
Hey, Mom?

940
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,975
<i>Dizzy dames.</i>

941
01:07:33,055 --> 01:07:37,075
<i>What were they thinking, sticking me</i>
<i>with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?</i>

942
01:07:37,155 --> 01:07:39,855
<i>We were barely able to get the trunk</i>
<i>to stay closed as it was,</i>

943
01:07:39,925 --> 01:07:41,585
<i>we packed it so tight.</i>

944
01:07:41,665 --> 01:07:46,565
<i>There wasn't anything we could do</i>
<i>but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me,</i>

945
01:07:46,635 --> 01:07:50,535
<i>out where anybody who cares to look</i>
<i>will see him.</i>

946
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:55,675
<i>Go ahead, take one of his cigarettes.</i>

947
01:07:56,675 --> 01:07:58,505
<i>It'll help.</i>

948
01:08:23,005 --> 01:08:27,375
It's got you smoking there, bud.

949
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:34,975
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

950
01:08:35,085 --> 01:08:37,245
You're dead.

951
01:08:37,315 --> 01:08:41,545
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

952
01:08:41,625 --> 01:08:46,555
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

953
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:49,055
It's got you hearing things.

954
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,295
It's got your nerves shot.

955
01:08:52,365 --> 01:08:54,955
It's got you smoking.

956
01:08:55,035 --> 01:08:58,975
You know it's true.

957
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:02,705
Nobody ever really quits.

958
01:09:04,315 --> 01:09:09,075
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

959
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:14,055
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

960
01:09:15,425 --> 01:09:18,085
Will you look at that?

961
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:23,085
Ooh, those hookers let you down.

962
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:29,565
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

963
01:09:29,635 --> 01:09:33,865
You sucker for the babes, you.

964
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:36,935
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

965
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:40,135
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

966
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:43,685
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

967
01:09:44,215 --> 01:09:47,815
Watch it!

968
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:50,275
Ah, this is great.

969
01:09:50,355 --> 01:09:53,725
Just like being in a buddy movie.

970
01:09:53,795 --> 01:09:56,155
Shut up!

971
01:10:00,665 --> 01:10:03,265
Boy, you're screwed.

972
01:10:03,335 --> 01:10:05,395
It's over.

973
01:10:05,475 --> 01:10:07,995
You're flushed.

974
01:10:08,075 --> 01:10:11,665
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

975
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:15,115
Sure, he's an asshole.

976
01:10:15,185 --> 01:10:17,805
Sure, he's dead.

977
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:21,515
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

978
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:25,645
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

979
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:29,185
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

980
01:10:29,265 --> 01:10:31,495
Not in this heap.

981
01:10:31,565 --> 01:10:34,085
Pull over!

982
01:10:35,605 --> 01:10:39,125
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

983
01:10:39,205 --> 01:10:41,675
Tough call.

984
01:10:41,745 --> 01:10:44,935
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

985
01:10:45,045 --> 01:10:49,245
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

986
01:10:49,315 --> 01:10:51,615
My hand moves all on its own,

987
01:10:51,685 --> 01:10:55,715
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

988
01:10:57,895 --> 01:11:02,755
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

989
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:07,035
Whatever you say.

990
01:11:14,005 --> 01:11:17,665
Your friend here...
party a little too hard tonight?

991
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,975
I'm the designated driver.

992
01:11:27,755 --> 01:11:30,955
Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

993
01:11:36,225 --> 01:11:38,355
I'll let you off with a warning.

994
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,625
What next?

995
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:56,615
<i>The tank goes dry</i>
<i>a quarter mile from the pits.</i>

996
01:11:56,685 --> 01:11:59,655
<i>I shove the T-Bird the rest of the way.</i>

997
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:02,985
<i>A few minutes' more work</i>
<i>and it'll all be over.</i>

998
01:12:03,055 --> 01:12:06,425
<i>Jackie Boy</i>
<i>will go into the damn tar pits,</i>

999
01:12:06,495 --> 01:12:10,725
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks,</i>
<i>go home and call it a...</i>

1000
01:12:22,145 --> 01:12:24,265
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

1001
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:28,075
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

1002
01:12:28,185 --> 01:12:30,845
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1003
01:12:30,915 --> 01:12:33,285
Not tonight.

1004
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:40,285
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1005
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:42,625
Your cause is lost.

1006
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:44,455
We know everything.

1007
01:12:44,535 --> 01:12:48,595
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1008
01:12:48,665 --> 01:12:53,665
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1009
01:12:53,735 --> 01:12:56,905
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1010
01:12:57,005 --> 01:13:00,875
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1011
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:05,545
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1012
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:10,615
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1013
01:13:10,685 --> 01:13:15,095
by facilitating the process of transition,

1014
01:13:15,165 --> 01:13:20,495
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1015
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:23,625
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

1016
01:13:23,705 --> 01:13:28,835
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

1017
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,935
I serve a new master now,

1018
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:35,875
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1019
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:41,385
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1020
01:13:41,455 --> 01:13:45,015
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1021
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:47,855
You don't know him.

1022
01:13:47,925 --> 01:13:51,195
My man will find a way.

1023
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:54,325
He always finds a way.

1024
01:13:55,805 --> 01:13:57,825
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1025
01:13:57,905 --> 01:14:01,275
and going on about how they got it so bad.

1026
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:03,635
This is a fine, grand country.

1027
01:14:03,745 --> 01:14:06,105
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

1028
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,405
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1029
01:14:09,485 --> 01:14:13,115
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1030
01:14:13,185 --> 01:14:15,815
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1031
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:18,255
without shite to show for it.

1032
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:22,185
Yeesh.

1033
01:14:23,265 --> 01:14:24,855
You find something, Murphy?

1034
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:28,225
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1035
01:14:28,305 --> 01:14:30,295
It's all bent up.

1036
01:14:30,365 --> 01:14:33,235
What's this stuck in it?

1037
01:14:33,305 --> 01:14:35,365
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

1038
01:14:44,585 --> 01:14:48,245
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

1039
01:14:49,655 --> 01:14:51,885
<i>They weren't cops, these four.</i>

1040
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:53,945
<i>They were mercenaries.</i>

1041
01:14:54,025 --> 01:14:56,295
<i>And if they were hired</i>
<i>by who I think they were,</i>

1042
01:14:56,595 --> 01:14:59,295
<i>the bad times haven't even started yet.</i>

1043
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:02,855
<i>And everything seemed</i>
<i>to be going so well.</i>

1044
01:15:14,785 --> 01:15:20,015
Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

1045
01:15:20,085 --> 01:15:22,385
You got a good point there, Ronnie.

1046
01:15:22,455 --> 01:15:25,685
Lend me your knife.

1047
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:28,855
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1048
01:15:28,925 --> 01:15:31,955
I'm at the bone, all right?

1049
01:15:34,165 --> 01:15:36,295
There we go.

1050
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:43,405
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1051
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:47,975
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1052
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,945
use your imagination, OK?

1053
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:03,095
<i>Silence, now.</i>

1054
01:16:03,165 --> 01:16:05,565
<i>No air to breathe.</i>

1055
01:16:05,635 --> 01:16:09,695
<i>Only the horrid, oily tar taste</i>
<i>creeping up my nostrils.</i>

1056
01:16:10,965 --> 01:16:15,305
<i>Let it in.</i>
<i>Let it fill your lungs.</i>

1057
01:16:15,375 --> 01:16:19,035
<i>They were counting on you</i>
<i>and you blew it.</i>

1058
01:16:20,015 --> 01:16:24,345
<i>Skinny, steely fingers at my wrist.</i>

1059
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:28,115
<i>Miho, you're an angel.</i>

1060
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:30,085
<i>You're a saint.</i>

1061
01:16:30,155 --> 01:16:32,385
<i>You're Mother Teresa.</i>

1062
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:34,515
<i>You're Elvis.</i>

1063
01:16:34,595 --> 01:16:36,825
<i>You're God.</i>

1064
01:16:37,525 --> 01:16:43,125
<i>And if you'd shown up ten minutes</i>
<i>earlier, we'd still have Jackie Boy's head.</i>

1065
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:46,565
Dwight, they got Gail!

1066
01:16:47,605 --> 01:16:50,835
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1067
01:16:50,945 --> 01:16:53,805
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1068
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,315
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

1069
01:16:56,385 --> 01:16:58,375
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1070
01:16:58,485 --> 01:17:02,645
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

1071
01:17:02,725 --> 01:17:07,955
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1072
01:17:16,035 --> 01:17:19,125
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around.</i>

1073
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:25,965
<i>We talk.</i>

1074
01:17:35,025 --> 01:17:38,825
<i>Stay smart.</i>
<i>Stay cool.</i>

1075
01:17:38,895 --> 01:17:42,345
<i>It's time to prove to your friends</i>
<i>that you're worth a damn.</i>

1076
01:17:42,425 --> 01:17:45,595
<i>Sometimes, that means dying.</i>

1077
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:49,155
<i>Sometimes, it means killing</i>
<i>a whole lot of people.</i>

1078
01:17:49,235 --> 01:17:51,725
There they are.
What do we do?

1079
01:17:52,405 --> 01:17:53,965
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1080
01:18:02,215 --> 01:18:04,375
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

1081
01:18:04,445 --> 01:18:08,285
<i>I could almost reach out</i>
<i>and grab it right then and there.</i>

1082
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:15,755
Get the head!
Get the head!

1083
01:18:17,395 --> 01:18:19,455
I got it!
I got it!

1084
01:18:26,205 --> 01:18:29,135
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1085
01:18:33,015 --> 01:18:35,875
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead,</i>

1086
01:18:35,945 --> 01:18:40,685
<i>but I'm on my feet and every ounce of me</i>
<i>wants to get some killing done.</i>

1087
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,945
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1088
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:54,895
Brave lad.

1089
01:18:54,965 --> 01:18:58,835
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1090
01:18:58,905 --> 01:19:02,675
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1091
01:19:02,745 --> 01:19:05,035
You got the drop on me, love.

1092
01:19:05,145 --> 01:19:07,615
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1093
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:17,455
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

1094
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:22,555
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1095
01:19:22,625 --> 01:19:25,255
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

1096
01:19:25,335 --> 01:19:28,425
It's my preference to blow things up.

1097
01:19:28,505 --> 01:19:30,905
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1098
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:34,735
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1099
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:38,765
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1100
01:19:38,845 --> 01:19:44,615
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1101
01:19:44,685 --> 01:19:48,145
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1102
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:50,885
You killed me mates.

1103
01:19:50,955 --> 01:19:55,415
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1104
01:19:57,395 --> 01:19:59,555
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

1105
01:20:00,365 --> 01:20:03,165
<i>You won't feel a thing</i>
<i>unless she wants you to.</i>

1106
01:20:03,235 --> 01:20:06,035
<i>She twists the blade.</i>

1107
01:20:06,475 --> 01:20:07,875
<i>He feels it.</i>

1108
01:20:10,745 --> 01:20:14,475
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do</i>
<i>and how we're gonna do it.</i>

1109
01:20:14,575 --> 01:20:19,035
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make</i>
<i>the most important call of my life.</i>

1110
01:20:19,155 --> 01:20:24,115
<i>First, we gotta rescue Gail,</i>
<i>then comes the kill.</i>

1111
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:28,145
<i>The big, fat kill.</i>

1112
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:41,335
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1113
01:20:41,405 --> 01:20:43,535
What, are you kidding me, man?

1114
01:20:43,645 --> 01:20:47,075
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1115
01:20:47,145 --> 01:20:48,615
I mean, the man's an artist.

1116
01:20:48,715 --> 01:20:53,815
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1117
01:20:53,885 --> 01:20:55,815
Your skin is perfect.

1118
01:20:55,885 --> 01:20:58,985
Your nerves, responsive.

1119
01:20:59,055 --> 01:21:00,355
Beautiful.

1120
01:21:00,425 --> 01:21:03,515
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1121
01:21:07,565 --> 01:21:10,625
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1122
01:21:11,305 --> 01:21:15,105
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1123
01:21:15,175 --> 01:21:17,365
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

1124
01:21:17,475 --> 01:21:20,445
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

1125
01:21:20,545 --> 01:21:22,475
We gotta cut a deal.

1126
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:26,145
You little bitch!
You sold us out!

1127
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,245
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1128
01:21:29,325 --> 01:21:31,515
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1129
01:21:31,585 --> 01:21:33,715
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1130
01:21:33,795 --> 01:21:36,425
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1131
01:21:36,495 --> 01:21:38,985
It wasn't your mom!

1132
01:21:39,065 --> 01:21:42,225
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1133
01:21:42,305 --> 01:21:44,995
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

1134
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:48,975
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1135
01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:51,805
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1136
01:21:51,915 --> 01:21:54,005
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1137
01:21:54,115 --> 01:21:58,845
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

1138
01:21:58,885 --> 01:22:00,815
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1139
01:22:00,885 --> 01:22:02,585
Your neck.

1140
01:22:02,655 --> 01:22:06,785
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1141
01:22:10,895 --> 01:22:14,955
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1142
01:22:16,535 --> 01:22:20,025
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1143
01:22:20,105 --> 01:22:24,135
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1144
01:22:24,245 --> 01:22:26,975
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1145
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:30,575
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1146
01:22:32,555 --> 01:22:34,605
Hey.

1147
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:36,915
Hey.

1148
01:22:37,755 --> 01:22:39,385
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

1149
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:43,125
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1150
01:22:43,195 --> 01:22:46,095
There's something wrapped around it.

1151
01:22:46,165 --> 01:22:47,895
Some kind of note.

1152
01:22:47,965 --> 01:22:50,235
Give it to me.

1153
01:22:50,305 --> 01:22:53,205
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1154
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:57,335
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

1155
01:22:57,445 --> 01:22:59,205
And bring the women.

1156
01:22:59,315 --> 01:23:02,545
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1157
01:23:03,115 --> 01:23:05,275
McCarthy, you fool.

1158
01:23:06,955 --> 01:23:08,005
Hey.

1159
01:23:09,185 --> 01:23:10,555
Guys?

1160
01:23:12,795 --> 01:23:14,255
Aw.

1161
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:21,365
<i>Dozens of them, armed to the teeth.</i>

1162
01:23:21,435 --> 01:23:25,425
<i>I'm outnumbered, outgunned.</i>

1163
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:31,105
<i>But the alley is crooked,</i>
<i>dark and very narrow.</i>

1164
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:33,835
<i>They can't surround me.</i>

1165
01:23:33,945 --> 01:23:39,075
<i>Sometimes, you can beat the odds</i>
<i>with the careful choice of where to fight.</i>

1166
01:23:43,355 --> 01:23:45,845
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1167
01:23:46,625 --> 01:23:50,585
Just give me the woman.

1168
01:23:50,665 --> 01:23:52,655
Shut up.

1169
01:23:52,735 --> 01:23:55,725
Dwight, don't do this.

1170
01:23:55,805 --> 01:24:00,105
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1171
01:24:00,175 --> 01:24:03,695
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

1172
01:24:03,805 --> 01:24:05,575
She's all yours.

1173
01:24:14,485 --> 01:24:19,325
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1174
01:24:19,395 --> 01:24:23,195
Dwight, what have you done?

1175
01:24:23,265 --> 01:24:25,285
Exactly what I had to.

1176
01:24:26,635 --> 01:24:29,225
Every step of the way.

1177
01:24:31,735 --> 01:24:34,795
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1178
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:37,275
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1179
01:24:49,655 --> 01:24:51,915
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot.</i>

1180
01:24:51,995 --> 01:24:56,725
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you do good.

1181
01:24:56,795 --> 01:25:00,825
<i>But there's nothing like having</i>
<i>your friends show up with lots of guns.</i>

1182
01:25:00,895 --> 01:25:03,805
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

1183
01:25:06,335 --> 01:25:09,135
<i>The girls all know the score.</i>

1184
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:15,805
<i>No escape, no surrender, no mercy.</i>

1185
01:25:15,915 --> 01:25:19,815
<i>We gotta kill every last</i>
<i>rat bastard one of 'em.</i>

1186
01:25:19,885 --> 01:25:22,075
<i>Every last one.</i>

1187
01:25:22,155 --> 01:25:26,385
<i>Not for revenge,</i>
<i>not because they deserve it,</i>

1188
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,655
<i>not because it'll make</i>
<i>the world a better place.</i>

1189
01:25:30,795 --> 01:25:32,625
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

1190
01:25:32,695 --> 01:25:36,725
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist</i>
<i>looks over his charts of profits and losses,</i>

1191
01:25:36,805 --> 01:25:41,135
<i>he'll see what it cost him</i>
<i>to mess with the girls of Old Town.</i>

1192
01:25:41,205 --> 01:25:44,405
<i>The Valkyrie at my side</i>
<i>is shouting and laughing</i>

1193
01:25:44,505 --> 01:25:49,875
<i>with the pure, hateful,</i>
<i>bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter,</i>

1194
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:52,285
<i>and so am I.</i>

1195
01:25:57,255 --> 01:25:59,225
<i>The fire, baby.</i>

1196
01:25:59,295 --> 01:26:02,085
<i>It'll burn us both.</i>

1197
01:26:02,165 --> 01:26:06,115
<i>There's no place in this world</i>
<i>for our kind of fire,</i>

1198
01:26:06,195 --> 01:26:10,565
<i>my warrior woman, my Valkyrie.</i>

1199
01:26:10,635 --> 01:26:13,535
<i>You'll always be mine.</i>

1200
01:26:13,605 --> 01:26:15,765
<i>Always...</i>

1201
01:26:15,845 --> 01:26:17,535
<i>and never.</i>

1202
01:26:31,055 --> 01:26:34,115
Evenin', officer.

1203
01:26:34,225 --> 01:26:39,215
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers.

1204
01:26:39,335 --> 01:26:42,765
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1205
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:46,465
You know who I am and what I can do.

1206
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:49,265
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

1207
01:26:49,345 --> 01:26:52,035
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

1208
01:26:52,115 --> 01:26:54,405
You blew my son's ear off.

1209
01:26:56,015 --> 01:27:01,045
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1210
01:27:03,185 --> 01:27:06,985
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

1211
01:27:07,095 --> 01:27:08,955
My boy.

1212
01:27:09,025 --> 01:27:11,755
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

1213
01:27:11,825 --> 01:27:16,065
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

1214
01:27:16,635 --> 01:27:20,005
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

1215
01:27:20,805 --> 01:27:24,965
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

1216
01:27:25,815 --> 01:27:28,545
Power comes from lying.

1217
01:27:28,615 --> 01:27:33,415
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1218
01:27:33,485 --> 01:27:36,515
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

1219
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:39,185
you've got 'em by the balls.

1220
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:44,755
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1221
01:27:46,935 --> 01:27:50,955
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

1222
01:27:51,035 --> 01:27:54,405
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

1223
01:27:54,475 --> 01:27:57,305
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

1224
01:27:57,375 --> 01:28:01,335
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1225
01:28:04,815 --> 01:28:08,255
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

1226
01:28:08,315 --> 01:28:11,375
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1227
01:28:11,485 --> 01:28:14,685
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1228
01:28:16,595 --> 01:28:20,225
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1229
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:26,865
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

1230
01:28:26,935 --> 01:28:29,335
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1231
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:33,205
disgraced, destroyed...

1232
01:28:33,275 --> 01:28:35,305
alone.

1233
01:28:36,215 --> 01:28:38,185
Your wife?

1234
01:28:38,245 --> 01:28:40,515
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1235
01:28:40,585 --> 01:28:43,675
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1236
01:28:45,555 --> 01:28:47,355
They won't let me testify.

1237
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:51,795
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1238
01:28:51,865 --> 01:28:54,695
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1239
01:28:54,765 --> 01:28:57,325
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1240
01:28:57,405 --> 01:28:59,865
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1241
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:04,105
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1242
01:29:04,175 --> 01:29:08,775
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

1243
01:29:09,315 --> 01:29:11,145
They got it all backwards.

1244
01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:14,875
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1245
01:29:14,955 --> 01:29:18,545
But you'll always remember things right.

1246
01:29:18,655 --> 01:29:20,745
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1247
01:29:22,425 --> 01:29:27,385
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1248
01:29:27,495 --> 01:29:29,485
Don't visit me.

1249
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:31,365
Don't write me.

1250
01:29:31,435 --> 01:29:33,635
Don't even say my name.

1251
01:29:34,075 --> 01:29:38,165
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

1252
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:40,235
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia. "

1253
01:29:40,815 --> 01:29:44,835
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1254
01:29:44,915 --> 01:29:49,315
I'll write you every week... for forever.

1255
01:29:49,385 --> 01:29:52,185
Sure, kid.

1256
01:29:52,295 --> 01:29:54,385
Now, run on home.

1257
01:29:54,495 --> 01:29:56,825
It's not safe for you here.

1258
01:30:00,795 --> 01:30:03,595
Bye, Nancy.

1259
01:30:05,935 --> 01:30:08,265
I love you.

1260
01:30:16,515 --> 01:30:18,645
John Hartigan.

1261
01:30:19,485 --> 01:30:21,505
Mr. Law and Order.

1262
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:26,025
Mr. By the Book.

1263
01:30:26,125 --> 01:30:28,285
Mr. High and Mighty.

1264
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:34,065
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

1265
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:36,295
without it catching up with you.

1266
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:39,635
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

1267
01:30:39,705 --> 01:30:41,965
It's catching up with you but good.

1268
01:30:46,515 --> 01:30:48,845
Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

1269
01:30:48,915 --> 01:30:55,315
Ohh, he's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

1270
01:30:55,385 --> 01:30:58,755
He's the picture of health.

1271
01:30:58,855 --> 01:31:02,225
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

1272
01:31:02,325 --> 01:31:04,595
I rented her out of Old Town.

1273
01:31:04,665 --> 01:31:09,325
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

1274
01:31:09,405 --> 01:31:10,765
You hear me, Hartigan?

1275
01:31:10,835 --> 01:31:14,535
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1276
01:31:14,605 --> 01:31:17,475
you might just get some of Tammy.

1277
01:31:17,545 --> 01:31:21,235
You see that?
She flinched.

1278
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:23,645
You make her sick.

1279
01:31:23,715 --> 01:31:26,515
She heard about you and that little girl.

1280
01:31:26,585 --> 01:31:30,955
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised</i>
<i>myself I'd pay, and I'm paying it.</i>

1281
01:31:31,025 --> 01:31:35,425
<i>You don't save a little girl's life, then</i>
<i>turn around and throw her to the dogs.</i>

1282
01:31:35,495 --> 01:31:37,485
<i>Not in my book, you don't.</i>

1283
01:31:37,595 --> 01:31:41,035
<i>They want a confession.</i>
<i>They won't get it.</i>

1284
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:48,025
<i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting</i>
<i>when they put me in solitary.</i>

1285
01:31:48,105 --> 01:31:51,195
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia."</i>
<i>Just like she promised.</i>

1286
01:31:51,275 --> 01:31:55,045
<i>She makes no mention of anything</i>
<i>that would give her away.</i>

1287
01:31:55,985 --> 01:31:58,105
<i>At first, I figure</i>
<i>she'll send another note or two</i>

1288
01:31:58,185 --> 01:32:01,415
<i>before her young mind</i>
<i>moves on to better things.</i>

1289
01:32:01,485 --> 01:32:04,755
<i>But every Thursday, another one arrives.</i>

1290
01:32:04,855 --> 01:32:06,655
<i>What a sweet kid.</i>

1291
01:32:07,255 --> 01:32:11,125
<i>I do my best to keep my hand</i>
<i>from shaking when I reach for it.</i>

1292
01:32:11,195 --> 01:32:15,635
<i>She's the only friend I've got -</i>
<i>the daughter I never had.</i>

1293
01:32:15,735 --> 01:32:17,725
<i>My sweet Cordelia.</i>

1294
01:32:17,805 --> 01:32:20,395
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1295
01:32:22,205 --> 01:32:24,695
<i>Eight years pass.</i>

1296
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:32,075
<i>Then comes a Thursday</i>
<i>when I bound from my cot,</i>

1297
01:32:32,145 --> 01:32:34,175
<i>excited as a kid at Christmas,</i>

1298
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:37,845
<i>only to find myself</i>
<i>staring at the damn floor of my damn cell,</i>

1299
01:32:37,925 --> 01:32:41,115
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy</i>
<i>that isn't there.</i>

1300
01:32:41,725 --> 01:32:44,165
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter.</i>

1301
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,095
<i>Is she all right?</i>

1302
01:32:46,165 --> 01:32:48,565
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

1303
01:32:48,635 --> 01:32:51,155
<i>Nothing.</i>

1304
01:32:51,235 --> 01:32:54,935
<i>Two months now -</i>
<i>not a word from Nancy.</i>

1305
01:32:55,005 --> 01:32:58,445
<i>Did they find her?</i>
<i>Did they get to her?</i>

1306
01:32:58,505 --> 01:33:01,965
<i>Of course!</i>
<i>Stupid old man.</i>

1307
01:33:02,045 --> 01:33:05,675
<i>Do your math.</i>
<i>Nancy's 19 years old.</i>

1308
01:33:05,755 --> 01:33:08,245
<i>How long did you expect her</i>
<i>to keep writing?</i>

1309
01:33:08,315 --> 01:33:12,015
<i>She was a saint to keep it up</i>
<i>as long as she did.</i>

1310
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:15,185
<i>She's forgotten you, old man.</i>

1311
01:33:15,295 --> 01:33:17,265
<i>You're alone.</i>

1312
01:33:17,325 --> 01:33:19,725
<i>You're all alone.</i>

1313
01:33:27,205 --> 01:33:31,105
<i>This guy smells awful -</i>
<i>like bad food.</i>

1314
01:33:31,175 --> 01:33:34,575
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster</i>
<i>in the middle of summer.</i>

1315
01:33:34,645 --> 01:33:36,845
<i>He stinks so bad, I want to throw up.</i>

1316
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:50,815
<i>Practically knocked my head off,</i>
<i>the bastard.</i>

1317
01:33:51,395 --> 01:33:53,725
<i>When I come to, I see it.</i>

1318
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:57,065
<i>The same kind of envelope</i>
<i>Nancy always uses,</i>

1319
01:33:57,135 --> 01:33:59,605
<i>but there's no letter inside of it.</i>

1320
01:33:59,675 --> 01:34:01,695
<i>There's something soft,</i>

1321
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:05,705
<i>something that ought to be alive -</i>
<i>a hunk of meat and bone</i>

1322
01:34:05,775 --> 01:34:09,875
<i>that ought to be the index finger</i>
<i>of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl.</i>

1323
01:34:09,945 --> 01:34:12,075
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1324
01:34:12,145 --> 01:34:13,945
<i>She was so careful.</i>

1325
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:16,885
<i>She never gave away</i>
<i>where she lives or where she works.</i>

1326
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:25,425
<i>I've got to get out.</i>
<i>I've got to help her.</i>

1327
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:30,625
<i>Nothing else matters -</i>
<i>not my life and not my pride, either.</i>

1328
01:34:30,705 --> 01:34:33,295
<i>It's only one final surrender they want.</i>

1329
01:34:33,375 --> 01:34:37,065
<i>You got me, Roark.</i>
<i>You beat me.</i>

1330
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:41,305
<i>I say everything they want to hear,</i>
<i>just the way they want to hear it.</i>

1331
01:34:41,375 --> 01:34:44,815
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted</i>.
<i>Wretched child molester.</i>

1332
01:34:44,885 --> 01:34:48,285
<i>I agree to everything they want from me.</i>

1333
01:34:48,355 --> 01:34:50,415
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1334
01:35:02,195 --> 01:35:04,895
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

1335
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:12,135
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

1336
01:35:12,205 --> 01:35:16,115
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1337
01:35:16,185 --> 01:35:18,705
Christ.

1338
01:35:18,785 --> 01:35:21,615
Eight years.

1339
01:35:21,685 --> 01:35:24,985
Yeah.
Eight years.

1340
01:35:26,355 --> 01:35:29,325
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

1341
01:35:31,165 --> 01:35:33,355
you made me hate myself.

1342
01:35:35,865 --> 01:35:39,095
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

1343
01:35:39,475 --> 01:35:43,335
She got remarried four years ago.

1344
01:35:45,675 --> 01:35:49,845
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

1345
01:35:49,915 --> 01:35:51,935
Don't be.

1346
01:35:52,015 --> 01:35:54,505
I'm glad.

1347
01:35:54,585 --> 01:35:57,785
Eileen always wanted kids.

1348
01:35:57,855 --> 01:35:59,785
She'll make a good mother.

1349
01:36:01,755 --> 01:36:06,095
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

1350
01:36:16,945 --> 01:36:20,305
<i>Bob and I get on</i>
<i>with our fond farewells to each other,</i>

1351
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:24,575
<i>then I go looking for the only human being</i>
<i>on the planet who means a damn to me -</i>

1352
01:36:24,645 --> 01:36:26,045
<i>Nancy.</i>

1353
01:36:26,115 --> 01:36:29,575
<i>How could they have found out it was you</i>
<i>writing all those letters to me?</i>

1354
01:36:29,985 --> 01:36:32,425
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

1355
01:36:32,525 --> 01:36:35,655
<i>And what have they done to you, baby?</i>

1356
01:36:39,365 --> 01:36:41,525
<i>Not a sound.</i>

1357
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,325
<i>No sign of life.</i>

1358
01:36:44,405 --> 01:36:48,135
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble</i>
<i>just to torture a broken old man,</i>

1359
01:36:48,205 --> 01:36:51,975
<i>like a kid poking at a fly</i>
<i>when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

1360
01:36:52,045 --> 01:36:54,845
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

1361
01:36:54,915 --> 01:36:57,645
<i>It's like all she ever does</i>
<i>is read and study and write.</i>

1362
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:03,075
<i>No diary, no phone numbers</i>
<i>or addresses written down anywhere.</i>

1363
01:37:04,125 --> 01:37:08,085
<i>Closest thing to a clue</i>
<i>is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon.</i>

1364
01:37:08,825 --> 01:37:13,425
<i>It's a long shot,</i>
<i>but maybe she's got some friends there.</i>

1365
01:37:20,035 --> 01:37:22,235
<i>A dead end.</i>

1366
01:37:22,305 --> 01:37:26,005
<i>Nancy wouldn't have anything to do</i>
<i>with a pack of drunks and losers like this.</i>

1367
01:37:26,075 --> 01:37:30,015
<i>But if there's anything to be found here,</i>
<i>the faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

1368
01:37:30,085 --> 01:37:33,145
<i>or whoever kidnapped her</i>
<i>and mutilated her, this is the place.</i>

1369
01:37:33,555 --> 01:37:38,245
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

1370
01:37:38,355 --> 01:37:41,655
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

1371
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:44,625
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

1372
01:37:44,695 --> 01:37:47,165
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

1373
01:37:47,265 --> 01:37:50,495
She's just warming up.

1374
01:37:58,575 --> 01:38:01,515
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan.</i>

1375
01:38:01,575 --> 01:38:03,475
<i>She grew up.</i>

1376
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,485
<i>She filled out.</i>

1377
01:38:06,555 --> 01:38:10,175
<i>Nancy Callahan, 19 years old.</i>

1378
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:15,185
<i>And here I was,</i>
<i>expecting a skinny little bookworm,</i>

1379
01:38:15,295 --> 01:38:19,055
<i>maybe a bit too shy for her own good.</i>

1380
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:25,035
<i>How little she told me about herself</i>
<i>in all her letters for all those years.</i>

1381
01:38:29,205 --> 01:38:31,575
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1382
01:38:31,645 --> 01:38:34,165
<i>Then it hits me.</i>

1383
01:38:34,245 --> 01:38:36,505
<i>They were bluffing.</i>

1384
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:40,245
<i>I've led them straight to her.</i>

1385
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:51,555
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet.</i>

1386
01:38:51,665 --> 01:38:54,185
<i>Turn around and walk out the door.</i>

1387
01:38:55,335 --> 01:38:57,025
<i>Lead the creep outside.</i>

1388
01:38:57,105 --> 01:39:02,305
<i>Get that Beretta away from him somehow,</i>
<i>and kill him.</i>

1389
01:39:02,375 --> 01:39:06,335
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con</i>
<i>watching an exotic dancer.</i>

1390
01:39:06,415 --> 01:39:09,375
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe.</i>

1391
01:39:10,115 --> 01:39:12,915
<i>No, Nancy.</i>
<i>Don't notice me.</i>

1392
01:39:12,985 --> 01:39:16,355
<i>Don't recognize me.</i>

1393
01:39:26,095 --> 01:39:28,085
There's no time to explain.

1394
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:31,195
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

1395
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:33,635
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1396
01:39:33,705 --> 01:39:37,575
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1397
01:39:39,675 --> 01:39:44,515
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

1398
01:39:44,585 --> 01:39:46,985
Kept me going.

1399
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:50,555
Kept me from killing myself.

1400
01:39:52,225 --> 01:39:54,285
Hurry up, will you?

1401
01:39:59,965 --> 01:40:02,795
Maybe I should drive.
Not a chance.

1402
01:40:03,605 --> 01:40:06,365
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1403
01:40:12,175 --> 01:40:15,835
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

1404
01:40:15,915 --> 01:40:18,905
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

1405
01:40:20,555 --> 01:40:22,385
It's loaded and it works.

1406
01:40:24,385 --> 01:40:27,015
Yeah, this'll do.

1407
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:30,585
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1408
01:40:34,735 --> 01:40:39,995
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1409
01:40:40,075 --> 01:40:42,635
You've never been far from my thoughts.

1410
01:40:42,705 --> 01:40:46,335
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

1411
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:49,205
What are you talking about?

1412
01:40:49,275 --> 01:40:54,045
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

1413
01:40:56,855 --> 01:40:58,785
<i>She's counting on you, old man.</i>

1414
01:40:58,855 --> 01:41:00,615
What are you doing?

1415
01:41:00,725 --> 01:41:03,125
<i>Prove you're still worth a damn.</i>

1416
01:41:09,095 --> 01:41:11,795
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

1417
01:41:14,575 --> 01:41:16,235
<i>He's a decent shot.</i>

1418
01:41:16,305 --> 01:41:19,205
<i>He's got skill,</i>
<i>but he's in too much of a hurry.</i>

1419
01:41:19,275 --> 01:41:22,265
<i>Throwing away bullets</i>
<i>like they were candy.</i>

1420
01:41:26,315 --> 01:41:28,375
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time.</i>

1421
01:41:28,455 --> 01:41:31,755
<i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye.</i>

1422
01:41:40,295 --> 01:41:42,665
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1423
01:41:42,735 --> 01:41:44,825
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

1424
01:41:44,905 --> 01:41:47,995
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

1425
01:41:54,645 --> 01:41:57,515
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

1426
01:41:57,585 --> 01:42:01,845
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1427
01:42:01,915 --> 01:42:04,115
No!
Let me stay close.

1428
01:42:04,185 --> 01:42:06,715
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1429
01:42:06,825 --> 01:42:09,985
Please?
Let me stay close.

1430
01:42:19,635 --> 01:42:23,405
<i>The stink - I almost gag.</i>

1431
01:42:23,475 --> 01:42:25,405
<i>His blood smells</i>
<i>even worse than he does.</i>

1432
01:42:25,475 --> 01:42:28,465
- Jesus.
<i>- And it's all over the place.</i>

1433
01:42:28,545 --> 01:42:33,035
<i>But the creep himself, he's gone.</i>

1434
01:42:33,115 --> 01:42:35,175
We're out of time.

1435
01:42:35,255 --> 01:42:39,715
<i>The sirens - I used to welcome the sound.</i>

1436
01:42:40,255 --> 01:42:43,125
<i>There's nothing to do now</i>
<i>but find a place to hole up for the night,</i>

1437
01:42:43,195 --> 01:42:46,955
<i>get Nancy calmed down and figure out</i>
<i>what on Earth I'm going to do next.</i>

1438
01:42:47,035 --> 01:42:50,595
<i>The stink - somehow it stays with us</i>
<i>all the way to the motel.</i>

1439
01:42:51,365 --> 01:42:53,395
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

1440
01:42:53,475 --> 01:42:57,405
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1441
01:42:57,475 --> 01:42:59,735
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1442
01:42:59,815 --> 01:43:03,575
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

1443
01:43:03,645 --> 01:43:07,275
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1444
01:43:07,355 --> 01:43:10,985
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

1445
01:43:11,055 --> 01:43:13,615
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

1446
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:17,825
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

1447
01:43:18,495 --> 01:43:20,795
<i>I've never been all that good with people.</i>

1448
01:43:20,865 --> 01:43:24,235
<i>When it comes to reassuring</i>
<i>a traumatized 19-year-old,</i>

1449
01:43:24,305 --> 01:43:28,205
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim</i>
<i>doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench.</i>

1450
01:43:28,275 --> 01:43:31,175
It's always been you, Hartigan.

1451
01:43:31,245 --> 01:43:33,205
All these years.

1452
01:43:34,315 --> 01:43:36,975
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

1453
01:43:37,045 --> 01:43:40,275
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1454
01:43:40,355 --> 01:43:43,545
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

1455
01:43:43,985 --> 01:43:46,085
Eight years.

1456
01:43:46,185 --> 01:43:49,785
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

1457
01:43:49,895 --> 01:43:52,055
It wasn't just gratitude.

1458
01:43:52,165 --> 01:43:55,255
I tried to fall in love with boys.

1459
01:43:55,335 --> 01:43:57,695
Even thought I did once or twice.

1460
01:43:57,765 --> 01:44:01,795
But I was already in love... with you.

1461
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:04,565
That's enough.
Jesus Christ!

1462
01:44:04,645 --> 01:44:06,975
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

1463
01:44:07,045 --> 01:44:09,745
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

1464
01:44:10,445 --> 01:44:12,175
No.

1465
01:44:47,385 --> 01:44:50,585
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1466
01:44:50,655 --> 01:44:53,175
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

1467
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:56,185
I love you.

1468
01:45:00,835 --> 01:45:03,295
I love you, too.

1469
01:45:03,365 --> 01:45:05,265
With all my heart.

1470
01:45:06,535 --> 01:45:09,735
<i>Cold shower - it helps.</i>

1471
01:45:09,805 --> 01:45:11,105
No, Nancy.

1472
01:45:14,645 --> 01:45:16,905
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

1473
01:45:16,985 --> 01:45:20,815
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1474
01:45:20,885 --> 01:45:24,715
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

1475
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:28,785
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

1476
01:45:31,865 --> 01:45:34,335
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell.</i>

1477
01:45:34,435 --> 01:45:36,865
<i>I've been suckered</i>
<i>into betraying the only friend I've got,</i>

1478
01:45:36,935 --> 01:45:40,635
<i>and put her in the hands of a murdering</i>
<i>rapist I thought I'd put down for good.</i>

1479
01:45:41,235 --> 01:45:44,905
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat</i>
<i>son of a senator.</i>

1480
01:45:44,975 --> 01:45:46,965
<i>It's all gone to hell.</i>

1481
01:45:47,045 --> 01:45:49,015
Klump, it's me.

1482
01:45:49,075 --> 01:45:51,945
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1483
01:45:52,015 --> 01:45:54,045
I want you to set me up for a party.

1484
01:45:54,115 --> 01:45:56,555
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

1485
01:45:56,625 --> 01:45:59,485
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

1486
01:45:59,585 --> 01:46:02,085
My tools better be clean and sharp.

1487
01:46:02,195 --> 01:46:04,925
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

1488
01:46:06,835 --> 01:46:12,355
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

1489
01:46:12,905 --> 01:46:16,165
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

1490
01:46:16,235 --> 01:46:19,005
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1491
01:46:19,075 --> 01:46:22,275
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

1492
01:46:22,345 --> 01:46:26,715
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1493
01:46:26,785 --> 01:46:30,775
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

1494
01:46:30,855 --> 01:46:33,045
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

1495
01:46:33,155 --> 01:46:34,885
I've been having the time of my life.

1496
01:46:34,995 --> 01:46:38,485
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

1497
01:46:38,595 --> 01:46:40,685
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

1498
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:42,765
She left not a clue.

1499
01:46:44,135 --> 01:46:47,395
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

1500
01:46:50,075 --> 01:46:54,065
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

1501
01:46:54,145 --> 01:46:57,345
Nancy, don't scream.

1502
01:46:57,415 --> 01:46:59,815
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

1503
01:46:59,885 --> 01:47:04,215
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

1504
01:47:04,285 --> 01:47:07,625
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

1505
01:47:07,725 --> 01:47:10,385
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

1506
01:47:10,495 --> 01:47:13,295
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

1507
01:47:13,365 --> 01:47:16,525
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1508
01:47:16,605 --> 01:47:18,865
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1509
01:47:18,935 --> 01:47:22,925
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

1510
01:47:23,005 --> 01:47:25,705
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

1511
01:47:34,755 --> 01:47:38,385
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>No way to fight it now.</i>

1512
01:47:38,455 --> 01:47:40,515
<i>No hope left.</i>

1513
01:47:40,625 --> 01:47:42,355
<i>No chance.</i>

1514
01:47:42,455 --> 01:47:46,255
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>This is the end.</i>

1515
01:47:48,995 --> 01:47:50,095
<i>No.</i>

1516
01:47:50,735 --> 01:47:55,005
<i>Give it a shot, old man.</i>
<i>Keep your neck tight. Move.</i>

1517
01:47:55,075 --> 01:47:58,935
<i>The window - maybe there's an alarm.</i>
<i>The window.</i>

1518
01:47:59,005 --> 01:48:01,675
<i>Keep your neck tight, goddamn it!</i>
<i>Stay conscious!</i>

1519
01:48:01,745 --> 01:48:04,545
<i>Stay conscious.</i>

1520
01:48:04,615 --> 01:48:05,805
<i>No alarm.</i>

1521
01:48:05,885 --> 01:48:08,645
<i>The glass! Cut the rope.</i>

1522
01:48:08,715 --> 01:48:11,555
<i>You can do it.</i>
<i>You can do it.</i>

1523
01:48:11,625 --> 01:48:13,315
It is inclement upon me

1524
01:48:13,425 --> 01:48:17,755
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1525
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:24,595
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

1526
01:48:24,665 --> 01:48:30,335
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

1527
01:48:30,875 --> 01:48:36,575
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

1528
01:48:36,645 --> 01:48:39,205
boner-inspiring though it may be -

1529
01:48:39,285 --> 01:48:44,185
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1530
01:48:47,625 --> 01:48:51,025
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

1531
01:48:55,565 --> 01:48:59,225
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

1532
01:48:59,305 --> 01:49:00,995
In plain English, creep!

1533
01:49:01,075 --> 01:49:04,835
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

1534
01:49:06,175 --> 01:49:08,265
The farm!

1535
01:49:09,115 --> 01:49:12,085
<i>That's all I need to hear.</i>
<i>Every cop on the force</i>

1536
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:16,245
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm</i>
<i>and to stay away from it.</i>

1537
01:49:16,355 --> 01:49:18,615
<i>Shlubb and Klump</i>
<i>were packing an arsenal.</i>

1538
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:21,815
<i>Once things get loud,</i>
<i>I'll probably have use for the cannons.</i>

1539
01:49:21,925 --> 01:49:24,895
<i>But at first, I'll have to play it quiet.</i>

1540
01:49:24,965 --> 01:49:27,195
<i>Quiet and nasty.</i>

1541
01:49:27,765 --> 01:49:31,135
<i>Nancy's car - six miles from the farm.</i>

1542
01:49:31,205 --> 01:49:34,465
<i>"Nobody but me can keep</i>
<i>this heap running", she told me.</i>

1543
01:49:34,535 --> 01:49:38,025
<i>Good girl.</i>
<i>The car stalled out on that yellow bastard</i>

1544
01:49:38,105 --> 01:49:40,475
<i>and you didn't tell him</i>
<i>how to start it up again.</i>

1545
01:49:40,545 --> 01:49:44,475
<i>You kept your mouth shut.</i>
<i>I'll bet Junior was furious.</i>

1546
01:49:44,545 --> 01:49:47,145
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around</i>
<i>something fierce.</i>

1547
01:49:47,215 --> 01:49:51,175
<i>But you stayed strong.</i>
<i>You bought a few extra minutes.</i>

1548
01:49:51,255 --> 01:49:53,485
<i>There's still a chance, Nancy.</i>

1549
01:49:53,595 --> 01:49:55,555
<i>Don't scream.</i>

1550
01:49:56,625 --> 01:50:00,185
<i>I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm</i>
<i>and make my way through the woods.</i>

1551
01:50:00,735 --> 01:50:04,225
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits.</i>

1552
01:50:05,165 --> 01:50:08,765
<i>My heart.</i>
<i>Can't be my heart.</i>

1553
01:50:08,835 --> 01:50:11,675
<i>I was cured.</i>

1554
01:50:11,745 --> 01:50:14,765
<i>Bad cough - blood in it.</i>

1555
01:50:15,275 --> 01:50:16,905
<i>Doesn't matter now.</i>

1556
01:50:16,985 --> 01:50:20,145
<i>I don't have to stay alive</i>
<i>that much longer, anyway.</i>

1557
01:50:24,825 --> 01:50:27,285
<i>Rotten way to kill a man, but it's quiet.</i>

1558
01:50:33,265 --> 01:50:36,355
<i>Hate yourself later.</i>

1559
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:51,005
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

1560
01:51:00,055 --> 01:51:02,495
Do you think I'm tired?

1561
01:51:02,555 --> 01:51:04,685
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1562
01:51:04,795 --> 01:51:07,195
You're the one who's gonna crack!

1563
01:51:07,265 --> 01:51:09,235
You'll crack!

1564
01:51:09,335 --> 01:51:12,355
You'll cry and beg!

1565
01:51:12,435 --> 01:51:14,165
You'll scream!

1566
01:51:14,235 --> 01:51:18,975
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

1567
01:51:19,045 --> 01:51:20,535
You'll scream!

1568
01:51:26,145 --> 01:51:28,705
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

1569
01:51:29,315 --> 01:51:31,815
That was foreplay.

1570
01:51:32,885 --> 01:51:35,825
Hartigan was right about you.

1571
01:51:35,895 --> 01:51:38,365
You can't get it up unless I scream.

1572
01:51:40,025 --> 01:51:41,795
You're pathetic!

1573
01:51:43,095 --> 01:51:45,195
You're pathetic.

1574
01:51:47,575 --> 01:51:50,665
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

1575
01:51:52,145 --> 01:51:54,605
It brings out the worst in me.

1576
01:52:01,155 --> 01:52:02,915
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1577
01:52:02,985 --> 01:52:05,145
<i>In too much of a hurry.</i>

1578
01:52:06,785 --> 01:52:09,695
Damn!
It can't be!

1579
01:52:10,195 --> 01:52:13,685
<i>Charging in like Galahad,</i>
<i>just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

1580
01:52:13,795 --> 01:52:15,095
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1581
01:52:15,165 --> 01:52:19,365
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

1582
01:52:24,105 --> 01:52:25,935
Good advice.

1583
01:52:36,185 --> 01:52:38,415
Give it up, Junior.

1584
01:52:38,485 --> 01:52:40,475
It's over.
Let her go.

1585
01:52:40,595 --> 01:52:42,285
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

1586
01:52:42,395 --> 01:52:47,325
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

1587
01:52:47,395 --> 01:52:50,595
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

1588
01:52:50,665 --> 01:52:53,435
You can't even lift that cannon!

1589
01:52:53,505 --> 01:52:55,865
Sure, I can.

1590
01:53:02,745 --> 01:53:05,405
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

1591
01:53:05,485 --> 01:53:08,415
Nancy, I'm sorry.

1592
01:53:09,115 --> 01:53:11,915
I'm taking no chances with you.

1593
01:53:14,455 --> 01:53:17,945
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

1594
01:53:21,195 --> 01:53:23,635
Here it comes.

1595
01:53:25,235 --> 01:53:27,065
It's gonna hurt.

1596
01:53:27,135 --> 01:53:29,165
You're right about that.

1597
01:53:33,005 --> 01:53:34,945
Sucker.

1598
01:53:38,215 --> 01:53:40,015
<i>I take away his weapon.</i>

1599
01:53:41,955 --> 01:53:43,315
<i>Both of them.</i>

1600
01:53:55,165 --> 01:53:58,825
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

1601
01:53:59,865 --> 01:54:03,825
<i>After a while, all I'm doing is pounding</i>
<i>wet chunks of bone into the floorboards,</i>

1602
01:54:03,905 --> 01:54:05,105
<i>so I stop.</i>

1603
01:54:06,645 --> 01:54:09,135
So long, Junior.

1604
01:54:09,215 --> 01:54:11,735
Been a pleasure.

1605
01:54:17,125 --> 01:54:20,615
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

1606
01:54:22,055 --> 01:54:23,615
I didn't scream.

1607
01:54:23,725 --> 01:54:25,855
I know it, baby.

1608
01:54:25,965 --> 01:54:28,295
You grew up strong.

1609
01:54:39,745 --> 01:54:43,105
<i>By the time I get her to the car,</i>
<i>Nancy stops shaking.</i>

1610
01:54:43,175 --> 01:54:47,115
<i>Her skin is warm again.</i>
<i>She's herself again.</i>

1611
01:54:47,185 --> 01:54:49,655
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1612
01:54:50,985 --> 01:54:53,085
And for all the little things.

1613
01:54:53,795 --> 01:54:57,245
Like saving my life, twice.

1614
01:54:58,295 --> 01:55:01,285
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

1615
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:06,355
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

1616
01:55:06,435 --> 01:55:09,165
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

1617
01:55:09,235 --> 01:55:11,575
I'm gonna clear my name.

1618
01:55:11,645 --> 01:55:15,705
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

1619
01:55:15,775 --> 01:55:19,405
I can't lose you, not again.

1620
01:55:21,785 --> 01:55:24,775
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1621
01:55:37,505 --> 01:55:41,305
<i>Nancy Callahan, the love of my life.</i>

1622
01:55:42,705 --> 01:55:47,195
<i>Shame to lie to her.</i>
<i>I hope she forgives me for it.</i>

1623
01:55:47,275 --> 01:55:50,875
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars?</i>
<i>Sure.</i>

1624
01:55:50,945 --> 01:55:54,505
<i>And maybe after I've pulled off</i>
<i>that miracle, I'll go and punch out God.</i>

1625
01:55:54,585 --> 01:55:58,385
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state</i>
<i>who'll go after Senator Roark.</i>

1626
01:55:58,455 --> 01:56:00,545
<i>I killed his only son.</i>

1627
01:56:00,655 --> 01:56:02,745
<i>The bloodline is cut.</i>

1628
01:56:02,855 --> 01:56:05,655
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy.</i>

1629
01:56:05,865 --> 01:56:08,555
<i>He'll use all his power</i>
<i>to get revenge on me.</i>

1630
01:56:08,635 --> 01:56:12,225
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy.</i>
<i>He'll find her again.</i>

1631
01:56:12,705 --> 01:56:14,795
<i>There'll be no end to it.</i>

1632
01:56:14,875 --> 01:56:17,065
<i>She'll never be safe.</i>

1633
01:56:17,145 --> 01:56:19,735
<i>Not as long as I'm alive.</i>

1634
01:56:19,805 --> 01:56:22,405
<i>There's only one way to beat him.</i>

1635
01:56:23,045 --> 01:56:25,705
<i>An old man dies,</i>

1636
01:56:25,785 --> 01:56:28,015
<i>a young woman lives.</i>

1637
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:31,385
<i>Fair trade.</i>

1638
01:56:34,355 --> 01:56:37,295
<i>I love you, Nancy.</i>

1639
01:56:44,265 --> 01:56:46,325
Yes.

1640
01:56:46,405 --> 01:56:48,765
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

1641
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:54,005
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1642
01:56:54,075 --> 01:56:57,675
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

1643
01:56:57,745 --> 01:57:00,115
It should be right as rain in no time.

1644
01:57:03,825 --> 01:57:05,845
Uh-huh.

1645
01:57:14,495 --> 01:57:16,265
Mm-hm.

1646
01:57:19,365 --> 01:57:22,705
<i>Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

1647
01:57:22,775 --> 01:57:27,265
<i>and you can find anything.</i>

1648
01:57:27,345 --> 01:57:29,035
Becky.

1649
01:57:31,085 --> 01:57:33,745
Care for a smoke?

1650
01:57:35,785 --> 01:57:38,015
Love you, too, Mom.

1651
01:57:40,325 --> 01:57:41,295
<i>Anything.</i>
