3

<i>I let her hear my footsteps. </i>

4
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,500
<i>She only goes stiff for a moment. </i>

5
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Care for a smoke?

6
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,300
Sure.
I'll take one.

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,900
Are you as bored by that crowd as I am?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,300
I didn't come here for the party.
I came here for you.

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,900
I've watched you for days.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,700
You're everything a man could ever want.

11
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,300
It's not just your face,

12
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,900
your figure, or your voice.

13
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
It's your eyes.

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,700
All the things I see in your eyes.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
What is it you see in my eyes?

16
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,600
I see a crazy calm.

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You're sick of running.

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,700
You're ready to face what you have to face.

19
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,600
But you don't want to face it alone.

20
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,700
No.

21
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,900
I don't want to face it alone.

<i>The wind rises electric. </i>

23
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,400
<i>She's soft and warm</i>

24
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,400
<i>Her perfume a sweet promise</i>
<i>that brings tears to my eyes. </i>

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,500
<i>I tell her that everything will be all right. </i>

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,300
<i>That I'll save her from whatever</i>
<i>she's scared of and take her far. Far away. </i>

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,600

<i>I hold her close until she's gone. </i>

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
<i>I'll never know</i>
<i>what she was running from. </i>

32
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>I'll cash her check in the morning. </i>

33
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,300
<i>(man) Just one hour to go. </i>
<i>My last day on the job. </i>

34
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,200
<i>Early retirement. </i>
<i>Not my idea. </i>

35
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,200
<i>Doctor's orders. </i>
<i>Heart condition. </i>

<i>"Angina. " he calls it. </i>

37
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
<i>I'm polishing my badge and getting myself</i>
<i>used to the idea of saying goodbye to it. </i>

38
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,100
<i>It. And the 30-odd years</i>
<i>of protecting and serving and tears</i>

39
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,800
<i>and the blood and terror</i>
<i>and triumph it represents. </i>

40
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,000
<i>I'm thinking about Eileen's slow smile. </i>

41
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,900
<i>About the thick. Fat steaks</i>
<i>she picked up at the butcher's today. </i>

42
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,400
<i>And I'm thinking about</i>
<i>the one loose end I haven't tied up. </i>

43
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
<i>A young girl who's out there somewhere</i>.
<i>Helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic. </i>

44
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Damn it, Hartigan, I won't let you do this.
You're gonna get yourself killed.

45
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,900
You're gonna get us both killed.
I won't let you. I'm warnin' you.

46
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,900
Let go of my coat, Bob.

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're draggin' me down with you.

48
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,500
I'm your partner.
They can kill me, too.

49
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,900
I ain't puttin' up with that. I'm gettin'
on the horn and calling for backup.

50
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,400
Sure, Bob.
We'll just wait.

51
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,400
Sit on our hands while that Roark brat gets
his sick thrills with victim number four.

52
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,600
Victim number four!

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,200
Nancy Callahan, age 11.

54
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,600
And she'll be raped
and slashed to ribbons.

55
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,600
And that backup that we're waitin' on
will just so happen to show up

56
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,100
just late enough for Roark
to get back to his US Senator daddy.

57
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,800
Take a deep breath, Hartigan.

58
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
Settle down and think straight.

59
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
You're pushin' 60
and you got a bum ticker.

60
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,900
You ain't savin' anyone.

61
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,800
You got a great attitude, Bob.

62
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,300
Real credit to the force, you are.

63
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Eileen's at home waitin' for you.
Think about Eileen.

64
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,900
Heck, Bob,

65
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,000
maybe you are right.

66
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm glad to hear you're finally talkin' sense.

67
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
<i>Hell of a way to end a partnership. </i>

68

<i>Hell of a way to start my retirement. </i>

69

<i>Nancy Callahan. Age 11.</i>

70

<i>For all I know. She's dead already. </i>

71
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,200
You've been a very good girl, Nancy.

72
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,700
- You've been very quiet.
<i>- (Nancy whimpers)</i>

73
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't be scared.

74
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,200
We're gonna be
taking you home really soon.

75
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,300
But first,
we're going to introduce you to somebody.

76
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,700
He's a very nice man.

77
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,900
<i>Halfway to the warehouse where</i>
<i>Weevil said they took her. And it hits. </i>

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
<i>Wicked spot of indigestion. </i>

79
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,000
<i>At least that's what I pray it is. </i>

80
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,400
<i>(man)</i>... lighthearted
and momentary digression.

81
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,400
The briefest indulge-ment
in automotive pleasure.

82
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,400
<i>(man #2)</i> For cheap thrills.
Such short-lived durability, Mr. Shlubb.

83
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,100
You would risk engender-ating ill will
on the part of our employers.

to our custody though it may be -

<i>Gotta keep this quiet. </i>
<i>Take 'em down fast. </i>

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
A single dent,
the merest scratch thereupon,

91
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,100
and the before-mentioned consequences
of which I so recently made mention

92
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,700

<i>Catch your breath. </i>
<i>Give your heart time to slow down. </i>

96
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
<i>But it won't slow down. </i>

97
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,400

We're all done here, Benny.

100
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,100
Let's give them some time together.
Give them some privacy.

101
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,100
Be with you in a minute, Lenny.

102
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm just making sure
they get along really well.

103
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,300
And what kind of beast couldn't get along
with a precious little girl like this?

104
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,500
You must be awfully scared now.

105
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,900
But you've got nothing to be scared of.

<i>(Nancy whimpers)</i>

All we're gonna do is have a nice little talk.

108
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,700
That's all. Just a nice talk.
Just you and me.

152
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,000
Hey. Don't listen to him.
He's a crazy man.

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,300
- What a tough man you are, huh?
- You stay right where you're at.

154
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,300
You shoot your partner in the back...

155
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,600
then you try to scare a little girl.

156
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,000
Maybe I'll pull my spare rod, plug you
a couple of times, show you how it's done.

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
We could've worked something out,
but you've blown that.

158
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Sit down or I'll blast you in half.

159
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,800
- You're so slow, you'll never stop me.
- Sit down!

160
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
You'll never be able to stop me.

<i>She says her name is Goldie. </i>

184

186

<i>And I realize Goldie's dead. </i>
<i>Not a mark on her. </i>

189

<i>She was murdered</i>

190

<i>Lying next to her</i>.
<i>Stone drunk. Just like she was. </i>

<i>Damn it. Goldie. Who were you</i>

Claire?

223
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,300
Now, don't worry, Lucille.
I was just grazed.

224
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,300
- You got any beers around this place?
- No way am I giving you any alcohol.

225
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Besides, it's not what
you came here for anyway, is it?

226
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,300
No.

227
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,900
Go ahead.
You're worse without 'em.

228
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Thanks.
You're the best.

Haven't seen you like this in a while.

235
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,500
- Got in a fight with some cops.
- Didn't happen to kill any of them, did ya?

236
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,200
Not that I know of. But they know they've
been in a fight, that's for damn sure.

237
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,000
How the hell do you suppose
I'm gonna square this with the board?

238
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
There ain't no squaring it.
Not this time.

239
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,800
This isn't some barroom brawl.

240
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,100
Or some creep with a gas can
trying to torch someone.

241
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
Hey, hey.
This is big.

242
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,600
- Settle down, Marv. Take another pill.
- Hey, there ain't no settlin' down!

243
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
This is blood for blood, and by the gallons.

244

This is the old days and the bad days,
the all-or-nothing days.

They're back.
There's no choices left.

246
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,300
And I'm ready for war.

247
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,900
Prison was hell for you, Marv.
It's gonna be life this time.

248
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,400
Ah.

249
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Hell's waking up every goddamn day
and not even knowing why you're here.

250
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,600
But I'm out now.

251
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,200
It took somebody who was kind to me
getting killed to do it.

252
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,300
But I'm out.
I know exactly what I gotta do.

<i>... and you could find anything. </i>

That coat looks like Baghdad.

What'll it be, Marv?

272
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,500
A shot and a brew, Shellie,
and keep 'em comin'.

273
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,300
Sure, honey.
You take it slow, now.

<i>(man) Most people think Marv is crazy. </i>

275

<i>of being born in the wrong century. </i>

<i>Swinging an ax into somebody's face. </i>

<i>Or in a Roman arena</i>
<i>taking a sword to other gladiators like him. </i>

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,300
<i>Then the damnedest thing happens. </i>

299
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,400
<i>For a second. I smell the angel smell</i>
<i>that belonged to my Goldie. </i>

300
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,100
<i>Just need my medicine. Is all. </i>

301
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,300
Bastard.

302
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
You're gonna pay for what you did to me.

303
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,000
Feel like talking, Louie?

304
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,600
How many got paid off
for the frame, Louie? Huh?

305
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,400
How many for the kill?

306
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,100
It was Connelly.
He set me up.

307
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
He'll never talk.

308
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,900
I don't know about you,
but I'm havin' a ball.

309
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,100
<i>Connelly talks. </i>
<i>They all talk. </i>

310
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,300
<i>(man)</i> And what have been
your sins, my son?

311
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,900
<i>(Marv)</i> Well, Padre,
I don't want to keep you up all night,

312
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,100
so I'll just fill you in on the latest batch.

313
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,100
These here hands of mine,
they got blood all over 'em.

314
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,400
You're speaking figuratively.

315
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,000
When I need to find something out,
I just go out and look for somebody

316
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,600
that knows more than me,
and I go and I ask them.

317
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,900
Sometimes, I ask pretty hard.

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,800
By way of a "for instance",
I killed three men tonight.

319
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,300
Tortured 'em first.

320
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,700
You might say I been
working my way up the food chain.

321
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,600
First two were minnows -
small-time messengers.

322
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,500
But it was Connelly, the money man,
who fingered you, Padre.

323
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,300
<i>(whispering)</i> Dear Lord, man,
this is a house of God.

324
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,100
Just give me a damn name.

325
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,500
- Roark.
- You really are pushing your luck, Padre,

326
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,600
feeding me garbage like that.

327
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
It can't be that big.

328
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,200
There's a farm
at North Cross and Lennox.

329
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,200
It's all there.
Find out for yourself.

330
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
And while you're at it,

331
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:41,700
ask yourself if that corpse of a slut
is worth dying for.

332
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
<i>Worth dying for. </i>

333
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
<i>Worth killing for. </i>

334
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,800
<i>Worth going to hell for. </i>

335
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Amen.

336
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,200
<i>His keys say the padre drove a Mercedes</i>.

337
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:00,800
<i>Or at least that's what they're</i>
<i>passing off as a Mercedes these days. </i>

338
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,900
<i>Modern cars -</i>
<i>they all look like electric shavers. </i>

339
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,700
<i>(tires screeching)</i>

340
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
Goldie.

341
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,200
Goldie!

342
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,100
It couldn't be Goldie.

343
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,500
<i>It's my own fault. And nobody else's</i>.
<i>That I got confused. </i>

344
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,400
<i>I've been having so much fun</i>
<i>I forgot to take my medicine. </i>

345
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
<i>That wasn't Goldie back there. </i>

346
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,900
<i>Goldie's dead</i>.

347
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,900
<i>And that's the whole reason</i>
<i>that I've been doing what I've been doing. </i>

348
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,800
<i>When you got a condition</i>.
<i>It's bad to forget your medicine. </i>

349
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,100
<i>The cold thing. It creeps into my gut</i>
<i>and tells me one more time it won't let go. </i>

350
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,500
<i>This is a bad place. This farm. </i>

351
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,300
<i>People have died here... </i>

352
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,000
<i>(growling)</i>

353
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,700
<i>... the wrong way. </i>

354
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
I don't want to fight, pooch.

355
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,300
I got no gripe with you.

356
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Easy, boy.

357
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,700
<i>(dog whimpers)</i>

358
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,400
<i>No way I was gonna use</i>
<i>my gun on you. Buddy. </i>

359
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,200
<i>It's whoever owns you I'm curious about</i>.

360
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,300
<i>Because there's blood on your breath</i>.
<i>And I think I know what kind. </i>

361
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,200
<i>So I sniff around to see what's buried. </i>

362
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
Here we go.

363
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,000
<i>It's impossible. </i>
<i>Nobody can sneak up on me. </i>

364
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,400
<i>I go blind. </i>
<i>Not a sound. Nobody's that quiet. </i>

365
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,100
<i>Nobody except the one who snuck</i>
<i>into that hotel room two nights ago. </i>

366
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,200
It was you, you bastard.
You killed her.

367
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
You killed Goldie.

368
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,500
It was...

369
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,600
<i>I blew it. Goldie. </i>

370
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,800
<i>I found your killer</i>.
<i>But he was better than me. </i>

371
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
<i>Too quiet. Too quick. </i>

372
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,000
<i>A killer born. </i>

373
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,600
<i>Why didn't he finish the job?</i>

374
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,400
He keeps the heads.
He eats the rest.

375
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,800
- Lucille?
- It's not just that wolf of his.

376
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,700
The wolf just gets scraps.

377
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
Bones.

378
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,200
It's him.

379
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,700
He eats people.

380
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,100
- He cooks them like they were steaks.
- Let's get you warm.

381
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,500
Just like they were steaks.

382
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,900
Now he's got both of us.

383
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,200
It's all right.
Take a nice, slow breath.

384
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
Just look at the heads on the wall.

385
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,000
The heads on the wall.

386
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
The heads on the wall.

387
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,700
Son of a bitch!
He kept smiling that damned smile.

388
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,800
He made me watch him
suck the meat off my fingers.

389
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,700
- He made me watch!
- Oh, Jesus.

390
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,800
He made me watch!

391
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,600
Christ, I could use a cigarette.

392
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,200
<i>Dames. </i>
<i>Sometimes all they gotta do is let it out. </i>

393
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,600
<i>And a few buckets later</i>.
<i>There's no way you'd know. </i>

394
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,300
You've brought us
some big trouble this time, Marv.

395
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,000
Whoever's behind this whole thing has
his connections right in the department.

396
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,300
Any leads?

397
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,100
One guy I talked to told me
it was Roark running the show.

398
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Whoever it is, he knew I was checking out
that hooker almost before I did.

399
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,700
- What hooker?
- The one you've been obsessing over.

400
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,900
The dead one.

401
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,200
Goldie.

402
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,700
I didn't know she was a hooker.

403
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,000
Doesn't make any difference
about anything.

404
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,700
- But I didn't know that.
- She was high-class stuff.

405
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,400
She must have shown you quite a time.

406
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,700
Quiet.
There's a car coming.

407
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,100
<i>(man)</i> Kevin!

408
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,900
<i>All I've got is a face... and a name. </i>

409
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,900
I'll see you later, Kevin.

410
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,000
Let's go.

411
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,700
They're done checking the house.

412
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,800
They're coming this way.

413
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,000
Bastards.
I'll show them.

414
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,100
You're not gonna get
either of us killed, Marv.

415
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,000
No, don't shoot!
Please.

416
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,300
Listen to me.
I'm his parole officer.

417
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,800
He's unconscious and unarmed,

418
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,900
so there's no need to kill him.

419
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,400
Captain, the target - there's no sign of him.

420
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,700
Here's a sign!

421
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,200
That there is one
damn fine coat you're wearing.

422
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,500
<i>I keep coming back to that cop I just killed</i>
<i>and what he told me. </i>

423
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,400
<i>I was pretty steamed about</i>
<i>what he'd done to Lucille</i>.

424
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,000
<i>So I took my time</i>
<i>with that son of a bitch. </i>

425
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,300
<i>It wasn't till I showed him</i>
<i>all those pieces of himself that he said it. </i>

426
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:43,100
<i>Just a name -</i>
<i>Patrick Henry Roark. Man of the cloth. </i>

427
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
<i>Could've become president</i>.
<i>But he chose to serve God. </i>

428
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,900
<i>Along the way. He happened to become</i>
<i>the most powerful man in the state. </i>

429
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,900
<i>He's brought down mayors and governors</i>
<i>like they were nothing. </i>

430
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,500
<i>He even made his rotten brother</i>
<i>a US senator without breaking a sweat. </i>

431
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,600
<i>And here he's gonna get killed</i>
<i>in the name of a dead hooker. </i>

432
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,600
<i>I'm getting used to the idea. </i>
<i>More and more. I'm liking the sound of it. </i>

433
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,800
<i>Then it hits me like a kick in the nuts. </i>

434
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,800
<i>What if I'm wrong?</i>

435
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,700
<i>I've got a condition. </i>

436
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,900
<i>I get confused sometimes. </i>

437
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,900
<i>And with Lucille dead</i>.
<i>I can't get my medicine. </i>

438
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,200
<i>What if I've imagined all of this?</i>

439
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,600
<i>What if I've finally turned into what</i>
<i>they've always said I was gonna turn into?</i>

440
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,100
<i>A maniac. </i>

441
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,500
<i>A psycho killer. </i>

442
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,700
<i>Can't kill a man</i>
<i>without knowing for sure you ought to. </i>

443
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
<i>I've gotta know for sure. </i>

444
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:49,400
<i>The merchandise is on display</i>
<i>by the time I make my way to Old Town. </i>

445
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,200
<i>For an hour or so</i>.
<i>I asked around about Goldie. </i>

446
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,100
<i>I don't get any answers</i>.
<i>But I know I'm bound to. </i>

447
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,300
<i>Lucille said Goldie was a hooker</i>.

448
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,100
<i>And if she was. She has roots here -</i>

449
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,100
<i>friends. Maybe even family. </i>

450
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,900
You can't be Goldie.
Goldie's dead.

451
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,900
Ha.

452
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,300
Goldie.
Yeah, sure, right.

453
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,400
I haven't eaten anything
or taken my medicine for days now.

454
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,100
No wonder I'm seeing things.

455
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Bastard!

456
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,300
<i>(Marv laughing)</i>

457
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,300
He's crazy.

458
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,400
Hit him again, Wendy.
Harder.

459
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
Wait a minute.
Why did she call you Wendy?

460
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,800
Because that's my name, you ape.

461
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,900
Goldie was my sister.
My twin sister.

462
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,300
I guess she was the nice one.

463
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,100
Goldie and the other six - where are they?

464
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
What did you do to them?

465
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,700
You crazy goddamn broad.

466
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Just take a look at this mug.

467
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,900
Would any of you dames let me get
close enough to you to kill you?

468
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:22,800
None of you would, but Goldie.

469
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,000
And she only did because
she thought I could protect her.

470
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,300
And I'll bet those cops didn't do a damn
thing about those other girls, did they?

471
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,500
But as soon as they had me for a fall guy,
they showed up, guns blazing.

472
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,000
But they didn't get me, and I've been killing
my way to the truth ever since.

473
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,700
So, go ahead, doll.

474
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,600
Shoot me now,
or get the hell out of my way.

475
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,500
Aw, nuts.

476
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,900
OK, I'm glad we got all that sorted out.

477
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:09,100
- What the hell?
- I tied those knots! That's my specialty!

478
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,000
You sat there and took it,

479
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,100
when you could've taken my gun away
from me any time you wanted to.

480
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,600
Well, sure. I thought I might be able
to talk some sense into you.

481
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,000
And I probably would have had
to paste you one,

482
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,100
and I don't hurt girls.

483
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,500
I need a pair of handcuffs.

484
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,700
What style do you want?
I got a collection.

485
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Just give him the ones
you got with you, Gail.

486
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,700
It was a farm boy named Kevin
who killed Goldie,

487
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,100
but it was Cardinal Roark
who was behind it, and I don't know why.

488
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,700
I know that sounds crazy.

489
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:46,100
No, it doesn't.
Goldie worked the clergy.

490
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,700
<i>Just like that. A whopper of a puzzle piece</i>
<i>falls smack in my lap. </i>

491
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,200
<i>I'm too dumb to put</i>
<i>the whole picture together yet</i>.

492
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,200
<i>But she fires up two cigarettes and hands</i>
<i>me one. And I taste her lipstick on it. </i>

493
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,800
<i>And suddenly. My heart's pounding</i>
<i>so loud I can't hear anything else. </i>

494
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,400
<i>I want to reach over and touch her</i>
<i>and taste Goldie's sweat one more time. </i>

495
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,700
<i>But she isn't Goldie. </i>

496
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
<i>Yeah. Yeah. </i>
<i>This'll do. </i>

497
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:17,300
I'm also gonna be needing a dozen
two-foot lengths of this rubber tubing...

498
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,800
and a spool of razor wire...

499
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
and a pair of those special gloves
that'll let me handle the wire.

500
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,200
<i>(man)</i> Beefing up
the old home security, huh?

501
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,800
<i>(Marv)</i> You can bet your ass.

502
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,100
<i>(Wendy)</i> She was my sister,
so I'm in this one to the end.

503
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,800
But why are you willing to go up against
Roark for someone you barely knew?

504
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:44,000
She was nice to me, gave me
something I didn't even know existed.

505
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:48,600
I wasn't never even able to buy a woman.

506
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:51,500
You know, the way I look.

507
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,100
<i>I take my mind off her</i>
<i>and I crawl back inside myself. </i>

508
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,100
<i>It's almost killing time</i>.
<i>And I'd better get sharp. </i>

509
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,200
<i>I check the list -</i>
<i>rubber tubing. Gas. Saw</i>.

510
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:07,500
<i>Gloves. Cuffs. Razor wire. Hatchet</i>.

511
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,900
<i>Gladys and my mitts. </i>

512
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,900
- We're close enough. Pull over.
- Yes, Marv.

513
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,500
Keep the engine runnin'.

514
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:21,400
If I'm not back in 20 minutes, you get
the hell outta here and don't look back.

515
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,400
Kill him for me, Marv.

516
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
Kill him good.

517
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,400
I won't let you down, Goldie.

518
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
<i>Heading downstairs to the kitchen. </i>

519
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,200
<i>Getting himself a midnight snack</i>.
<i>And I can guess what kind. </i>

520
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,800
Come on, you son of a bitch.

521
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,600
<i>Damn. He's slick. </i>

522
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,600
<i>(yells)</i>

523
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,100
Is that the best you can do, creep?

524
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,900
<i>That's right. </i>
<i>Get personal. Get close. I can take it. </i>

525
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,500
I got you, you little bastard.
Let's see you hop around now.

526
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:46,100
<i>I try to slow my heart down</i>
<i>and breathe the fire out of my lungs. </i>

527
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,900
<i>My muscles make me</i>
<i>a thousand promises of pain to come. </i>

528
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:53,700
Let me do it, Marv.
She was my sister. Let me finish him.

529
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,400
You wasn't supposed
to come down here, Wendy.

530
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,200
Oh, but I want to...

531
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,300
<i>I'm sorry. Kid</i>.
<i>But I haven't even started with this creep</i>.

532
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,700
<i>And I don't want you watching the rest. </i>
<i>It'll give you nightmares. </i>

533
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,800
God, I gotta tell you, I'm good and bushed.

534
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,100
And it's not that fight of ours
that did me in, either.

535
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,000
It's all that sawing and tying.

536
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,400
It's not as easy as it looks.

537
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,700
Could have been a real mess around here
if I didn't have that tubing for tourniquets.

538
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,400
I gotta admit,
there was a spurt or two,

539
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,700
to get the scent in the air,
to get that friend of yours to come running.

540
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,100
Well, what do you know?

541
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,500
Look who's here.

542
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,100
Here he comes.

543
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,800
<i>(dog growling)</i>

544
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,600
That's a good dog.

545
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,600
<i>He doesn't scream</i>.
<i>Not even when the mutt's had its fill</i>

546
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,300
<i>and Kevin's guts</i>
<i>are lying all over the place. </i>

547
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,300
<i>Somehow the bastard is still alive</i>.
<i>Still staring at me. </i>

548
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,400
<i>Not even when I grab the saw</i>
<i>and finish the job. </i>

549
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,500
<i>He never screams. </i>

550
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,600
<i>I put in a call to Kadie's</i>
<i>and ask Nancy to get her clothes on</i>

551
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,100
<i>and meet me at her place. </i>
<i>She says. "Yes. " like always. </i>

552
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,900
Hey, Nancy, you got any beers?

553
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,900
Sure, Marv.
Who's the babe?

554
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,900
<i>There isn't much of anything</i>
<i>Nancy wouldn't do for me. </i>

555
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,700
<i>Not since a year back</i>
<i>when a frat boy roughed her up</i>

556
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,100
<i>and I straightened him out but good. </i>

557
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,900
<i>It really gets my goat</i>
<i>when guys rough up dames. </i>

558
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,700
So, what do you want me to do with her?

559
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Well, your best bet is
drive her all the way up to Sacred Oaks.

560
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,600
What about you?
Are you leaving town?

561
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,500
Hell, no.
I like it here.

562
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,400
<i>(belches)</i>

563
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,300
<i>I hot-wire a parked cab</i>
<i>and stay under the speed limit</i>

564
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,600
<i>so as not to get any attention. </i>

565
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,000
<i>My head starts to clear. </i>
<i>Things start to make sense. </i>

566
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,900
<i>I owe you. Goldie. </i>

567
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>I owe you one and I'm gonna pay up. </i>

568
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,400
<i>So. If going after Roark</i>
<i>means dying. Win or lose -</i>

569
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:20,000
<i>hell. I'll die laughing</i>
<i>if I know I've done this one thing right. </i>

570
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,300
Quiet as a grave out here.
No sign of target.

571
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,100
<i>(man on radio)</i>
<i>All right. Keep a lookout. </i>

572
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,300
- Kevin?
- What's left of him, anyways.

573
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,600
The dog ate the rest.

574
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Oh, my God.
You monster.

575
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,400
You demon.

576
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,900
Don't scream or I'll plug you.

577
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,100
He had the voice of an angel,
yet he spoke only to me.

578
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,100
And he's dead now
because of one stupid whore.

579
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,800
It's not a real good idea for you to talk
about Goldie that way while I'm around.

580
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,200
When he came to me...

581
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,000
he was a tormented boy.

582
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,600
Tormented by guilt.

583
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,900
I tried to counsel him.

584
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,900
But the eating - it filled him with white light.

585
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,000
Tearful, he swore to me
that he felt the touch of God Almighty.

586
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,000
What the hell do you know?

587
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,600
I know it's pretty damn weird to eat people.

588
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,600
He didn't just eat their bodies,

589
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,100
he ate their souls.

590
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,200
And I joined in.

591
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,600
They were all whores.

592
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,500
Nobody cared for them.
Nobody missed them.

593
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:22,000
And then your Goldie
almost ruined everything.

594
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,400
<i>She stayed in public places. </i>

595
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,800
<i>And then with you. </i>

596
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,300
<i>You were so convenient. </i>

597
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,700
<i>You'd broke a man's jaw that very night. </i>

598
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,300
Who would believe a thug like you?

599
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,000
<i>Kevin killed her. </i>

600
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,800
<i>I ordered the police in for you</i>.
<i>But you wouldn't be caught. </i>

601
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,300
<i>You wouldn't stop. </i>

602
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,300
And now he's dead and you're here to...

603
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,800
eliminate me.

604
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,100
Will that give you satisfaction, my son?

605
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,800
Killing a helpless old fart?

606
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,700
The killing, no.

607
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,600
No satisfaction.

608
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,200
Everything up until the killing will be a gas.

609
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,400
Kevin...

610
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,000
we're going home.

611
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,200
You can scream now if you want to.

612
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,600
<i>It's beautiful. Goldie. </i>
<i>It's just like I promised. Only better. </i>

613
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,200
<i>And when his eyes go dead</i>.

614
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,500
<i>The hell I sent him to must seem like</i>
<i>heaven after what I've done to him. </i>

615
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
<i>- (man)</i> Freeze!
<i>- (man #2)</i> Oh, my God!

616
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,000
<i>(beeping)</i>

617
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,900
<i>(sighs) Jerks. </i>

618
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,800
<i>They should've shot me in the head</i>.
<i>And enough times to make sure. </i>

619
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,700
<i>It's so stupid. </i>

620
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,700
<i>Everybody knows what's coming</i>.
<i>But they go through the motions anyway. </i>

621
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,000
<i>What a waste of time. </i>

622
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,500
<i>Months fall off the calendar</i>
<i>while I breathe and eat through tubes. </i>

623
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,500
<i>Night after night. I wait for somebody</i>
<i>to come and finish me off. </i>

624
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,400
<i>After a while</i>.
<i>I realize it's not gonna be so easy as that. </i>

625
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,000
<i>I'm on my feet for about ten minutes</i>

626
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,000
<i>before the cops kick them out</i>
<i>from under me. </i>

627
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,100
<i>They don't ask me any questions. </i>

628
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,700
<i>They just keep knocking the crap out of</i>
<i>me and waving a confession in my face. </i>

629
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
<i>And I keep spitting blood all over it</i>

630
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,400
<i>and laughing at how many fresh copies</i>
<i>they come up with. </i>

631
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,000
<i>Then along comes this worm assistant</i>
<i>district attorney who turns the recorder off</i>

632
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,500
<i>and says if I don't sign their confession</i>.
<i>They'll kill my mom. </i>

633
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,000
<i>I break his arm in three places</i>
<i>and I sign it. </i>

634
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,200
<i>From then on</i>.
<i>It's the circus everybody wants it to be. </i>

635
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,700
<i>They nail me for the works -</i>
<i>not just the people I did kill</i>.

636
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,800
<i>But even Lucille and the girls</i>
<i>that Roark and Kevin ate</i>.

637
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,500
<i>And even Goldie. </i>

638
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,700
<i>The judge is all fire and brimstone</i>
<i>when she hands down the sentence. </i>

639
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,800
<i>Midnight and my death</i>
<i>are only a few hours away</i>.

640
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,000
<i>When I get my first surprise in 18 months. </i>

641
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,100
<i>My only visitor. </i>

642
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,100
<i>I'm ready for anything but that scent. </i>

643
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:28,300
I got 'em for you good,
didn't I, Goldie?

644
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:36,100
Oh, I'm sorry, Wendy.

645
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,400
I... I got confused again.

646
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,100
Just seeing you like this.

647
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,000
You can call me Goldie.

648
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,100
<i>She smells like angels ought to smell. </i>

649
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,900
<i>The perfect woman. </i>

650
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,700
<i>The goddess. </i>

651
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,200
<i>Goldie. </i>

652
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,900
<i>She says her name is Goldie. </i>

653
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,100
<i>They fix me a pretty decent steak</i>
<i>for my last meal. </i>

654
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,700
<i>They even throw in a brew. </i>
<i>It's the first I've had since back at Nancy's. </i>

655
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,400
<i>Then they shave my head and fix me</i>
<i>with a rubber diaper and get to it. </i>

656
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,400
<i>And it's about damned time</i>.
<i>If you ask me. </i>

657
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,000
"Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death... "

658
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,800
Would you get a move on?
I haven't got all night.

659
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,600
You heard the man.
Hit it.

660
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,500
<i>(buzzing)</i>

661
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,900
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?

662
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,200
He's gone.

663
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,600
<i>(knock on door)</i>

664
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,200
Forget it, man.

665
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,400
You can bang on that door
all night if you want to.

666
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,000
There is no way in hell I'm letting you in.

667
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,600
I can't believe
you're doing this to me, Shellie.

668
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,000
Everything we've shared -
it has to mean something to you.

669
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,900
Ha. It meant plenty.

670
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,200
Plenty of lost pay on account of how
nobody wants to flirt with a waitress

671
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,900
whose face is all purple
and swollen up with bruises.

672
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,500
I know you're angry, baby.

673
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,800
And I forgive you for that
without you even asking me to.

674
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,700
There's a difference
between getting honked off

675
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,500
at a guy who's generally not so bad,

676
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,600
and finding out that you've been
sweet-talked by a total jerk loser

677
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,300
who skips out on a wife
that he doesn't even tell you about

678
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,100
every time he gets drunk,
which is way too often!

679
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,100
Especially the kind of total jerk loser

680
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,200
who has to beat up on a girl
to make himself feel like a man.

681
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,600
That hurt, Shellie.

682
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:16,300
It's one thing for you to play hard to get,
but don't go trying to cut my nuts off.

683
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,900
I am impossible to get.

684
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,500
Do yourself a favor, Jackie Boy,
and get help, like a shrink.

685
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,400
Get help and get lost.

686
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,200
Just open the door.

687
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,100
Go ahead and open the door, Shellie.
I'll take care of this.

688
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,200
Just open the door and you'll see
how wrong you've been about me.

689
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,300
Oblige him, Shellie.
I'm ready for him.

690
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,100
No! If he knew that you were here with me,
you don't know how bad this could get!

691
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,600
This clown's got a big, mean drunk on.

692
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:53,800
And he's got four friends
out there in the hall,

693
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,500
breathing hard
and just as drunk as he is.

694
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,500
Hey, I could swear I heard somebody
in there with you just now.

695
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,200
Somebody! Jackie Boy,
it's a regular African love fest in here!

696
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,800
- I'm no racist.
- I mean, I got me all five starters,

697
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,000
and half the bench of
the Basin City Blues keeping me company.

698
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,200
You feel like taking them on?

699
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:19,400
You are teasing me, baby.

700
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,000
Some of my best friends...

701
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:25,800
But you're really pushing my buttons.

702
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,100
And the whole time
you've been doing me like this,

703
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:31,000
I've been too polite to point out
that at any time I want to,

704
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,200
I could kick this damn door to splinters.

705
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,200
OK, baby, you know what I can do.

706
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,600
- You know what I can do. One, two...
- All right, then!

707
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,700
All right.
All right, all right!

708
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,900
Troops, make yourself at home.

709
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,600
You brought your whole pack with you?

710
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,500
None of these bozos got lives,
they gotta hang out with you?

711
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,200
You're gonna love this, baby.

712
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,100
You're gonna call up some of your friends
who work the saloon.

713
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,700
With you and the bunch of us,
we're gonna hit every joint in town,

714
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,600
and it's gonna be great.

715
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:15,800
I ain't calling up nobody.

716
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,200
That's a man's shirt,
and I'm sure as hell it ain't one of mine.

717
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,600
You got somebody's love stink all over you.

718
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,000
You've been with another man
and you've been with him tonight.

719
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,500
- Who is he?
- He's Superman.

720
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,600
He flew out the window
just as soon as he heard you were coming,

721
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,200
'cause you scared him so bad.

722
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,300
<i>(laughs)</i>

723
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,400
<i>(Jackie Boy)</i> You think
I have no feelings at all.

724
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,600
<i>(Shellie)</i> If you're gonna slug me,

725
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,700
just go ahead and get it over with,
you sick bastard.

726
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,800
<i>(Jackie Boy)</i> There you go,
lying about me again,

727
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,600
right in front of my friends.

728
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,000
I have never hit a woman in my life.

729
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,000
<i>(laughter)</i>

730
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,800
That's showing her, man.

731
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:17,400
You goddamn bastard.
You goddamn coward.

732
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,500
- Baby, we're all here to have a good time.
- Yeah.

733
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:24,300
- I gotta take a leak.
- Oh!

734
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,900
Wish you'd dropped by earlier, Jackie Boy.

735
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,600
Then you could've met my boyfriend.

736
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,100
Could've seen what a real man looks like.

737
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,100
There you go, after my nuts again.

738
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,400
But I forgive you.

739
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
I'm a generous guy.

740
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,000
He is generous.
But that temper of his...

741
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:49,200
You never should have
picked on him like you did.

742
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:52,800
My temper you don't have to worry about.

743
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:57,000
Shut up and keep your hands to yourself
or I'll cut your little pecker off.

744
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,800
Ooh.
I've been told.

745
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,800
Hey, baby,
I don't hear you making those calls.

746
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,600
Answer me!

747
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,800
Oh, I don't need this grief.

748
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:17,700
Hi. I'm Shellie's new boyfriend
and I'm out of my mind.

749
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,700
You ever so much as talk to Shellie again,
you even think her name,

750
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:26,400
and I'll cut you in ways
that'll make you useless to a woman.

751
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:30,900
You're making a big mistake, man.
A big mistake.

752
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,400
Yeah?
You already made a big mistake yourself.

753
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,800
You didn't flush.

754
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,900
Troops, get outta here.

755
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,100
No questions, damn it.
No questions.

756
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,000
Now!

757
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,100
<i>(helicopter overhead)</i>

758
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,700
<i>(sirens blaring)</i>

759
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,000
Dwight, what in the devil
did you do to him?

760
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,000
I just gave him a taste of his own medicine.

761
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,200
I don't think he'll be bothering you again.

762
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,200
- How's your jaw?
- I've been slapped around worse.

763
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,300
Dwight, he was from a while back,

764
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,600
before you showed up again
with that new face of yours.

765
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,500
And it was only 'cause I felt sorry for him.

766
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,000
And it was only once.

767
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,000
I've done some dumb things.

768
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,100
Seeing as how
I'm one of those dumb things,

769
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,900
I can't give you
too hard a time about that, Shellie.

770
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But this guy, he's a menace.

771
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,200
He might kill somebody if I don't stop him.

772
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,800
I'll call you later.

773
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,300
No, don't go!

774
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,700
<i>Shellie shouts something</i>
<i>I can't quite make out</i>

775
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,500
<i>over the racket of a passing police 'copter. </i>

776
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,200
- Stop!
<i>- It sounds like "stop. " but I can't be sure. </i>

777
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,500
<i>It's a chance I shouldn't be taking</i>.
<i>But I can't just go home and forget about it</i>.

778
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,000
<i>And let Jackie Boy and his pals</i>
<i>find their fun. </i>

779
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,600
<i>They're a pack of predators and they're</i>
<i>out for blood tonight - a woman's blood. </i>

780
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,000
Damn it, Dwight.
Damn it.

781
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,000
You fool.

782
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,400
You damned fool.

783
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,200
<i>I cut my Caddy across the park</i>

784
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,800
<i>to pick up Jackie Boy heading</i>
<i>like a bat outta hell up the hill. </i>

785
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,900
<i>I'm speeding. </i>

786
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,800
<i>That's a good way to get yourself noticed. </i>
<i>And if you're a murderer with a new face</i>

787
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,200
<i>who's one fingerprint check away from</i>
<i>the fast track to the gas chamber like I am</i>.

788
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,400
<i>The last thing you want</i>
<i>is to get noticed. </i>

789
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,700
<i>(siren blaring)</i>

790
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:38,200
<i>I don't have nearly enough cash on me</i>
<i>to bribe this cop. And even if I did</i>.

791
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,500
<i>There's always the outside chance</i>
<i>he's one of the honest ones. </i>

792
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:47,200
<i>Do I try to talk my way out of this</i>.
<i>Or do I take this cop down and risk it all?</i>

793
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:51,600
<i>Then Jackie Boy saves me</i>
<i>a great. Big. Steaming pile of trouble. </i>

794
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,200
Watch it, Jack!

795
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,300
<i>(horns blaring)</i>

796
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,000
Cops!
They're right on our ass!

797
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,600
Not for long.
Not where we're headed.

798
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,700
<i>My gut tightens up. </i>

799
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,100
<i>Jackie Boy's leading us</i>
<i>straight to Old Town. </i>

800
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,600
<i>The cop shuts off his siren. </i>

801
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,900
<i>He knows he's not the law</i>.
<i>Not in Old Town. </i>

802
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,000
<i>The ladies are the law here</i>.
<i>Beautiful and merciless. </i>

803
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,300
<i>If you've got the cash</i>
<i>and you play by the rules</i>.

804
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,800
<i>They'll make all your dreams come true. </i>

805
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,600
<i>But if you cross 'em. You're a corpse. </i>

806
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,300
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

807
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,400
Hop in, sugar.
We'll get you there.

808
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,300
Aw, sweetheart. I work the day shift
and it's been a long day.

809
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Besides, I don't do group jobs.

810
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,500
Get in the car, baby.
We'll just talk. It'll be nice.

811
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600
I don't do talk jobs, either.

812
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,800
Babydoll,
I've had me one hell of a bad day.

813
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,600
I've been beat up every time I turn around.

814
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,800
But the day I get turned down by a hooker

815
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:18,400
when I got good,
hard-earned cash to pay her with...

816
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,900
well...

817
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,500
there's only so much a man can take.

818
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,700
Go try the Alamo over on Dillon Street.

819
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,200
That's the Alamo, not the Amigo.

820
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,900
The Amigo's a fag joint.

821
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:37,400
Are you having a good time humiliating me
like this for no damn reason at all?

822
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,900
That's far enough, Dwight.
We've been on top of these peckerwoods

823
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,600
since they first showed up
with that cop behind them.

824
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,700
Everything's under control.

825
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,900
Enjoy the show.

826
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,900
<i>There's no use arguing with her. </i>

827
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,900
<i>The ladies are their own enforcers. </i>

828
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,900
So, how's the barmaid?
You know, the one that never shuts up?

829
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,900
- Not right now, Gail.
- Ooh.

830
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,800
Wound up a little tight, aren't we?

831
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:09,100
That's your whole problem, Dwight.
You worry too much.

832
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:12,200
That, and your lousy taste in women.
These days, anyway.

833
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,300
Damn it, Gail.
Not right now.

834
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,300
Those clowns down the way -
they some of the barmaid's boyfriends?

835
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,500
One of them thinks he is.

836
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
He's outta control.

837
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,100
I followed them here to make sure
he didn't hurt any of the girls.

838
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,800
Us helpless little girls.

839
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,400
<i>All kinds of death is about to hit</i>
<i>less than 20 yards ahead of us</i>.

840
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,100
<i>And still it's hard to take my eyes off her. </i>

841
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,900
Us girls are safe as we can be, Lancelot.

842
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,500
Those boys in that Chrysler
are one mistake away

843
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,000
from seeing what Miho can do.

844
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,100
And she's been aching for some practice.

845
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,800
<i>She guides my glance upwards</i>
<i>to the pixie perched on the roof's edge. </i>

846
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:00,900
<i>- Deadly little Miho. </i>
<i>- (girl)</i> You're running out of alley, cowboy.

847
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:05,400
Turn around. Save yourself
and your buddies a ton of grief.

848
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,200
<i>(Jackie Boy)</i> You're a sassy little thing.

849
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,100
You ain't hardly in any kind
of position to be making threats.

850
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:17,100
<i>The trap is set</i>.
<i>locked and ready to spring. </i>

851
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:21,200
<i>So what? They're scum. </i>
<i>They deserve what's coming. </i>

852
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,600
<i>So why this rotten feeling in my gut</i>
<i>that something is awfully wrong?</i>

853
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,900
They haven't killed anybody I know about.

854
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,700
It got pretty bad at Shellie's place,
but they didn't kill anybody.

855
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,200
And they won't.

856
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,400
<i>Why this rotten feeling?</i>

857
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:40,000
<i>Something Shellie said. </i>
<i>I can't place it. </i>

858
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,100
OK, OK, OK. I sounded off
a little more than I should have.

859
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,300
- I'm a little on edge.
- Over the edge.

860
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,700
It's not a woman you need.
It's a good night's sleep.

861
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,600
You couldn't handle a woman,
the state you're in.

862
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,100
She's saying you ain't got
what it takes, Jack.

863
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,500
You wanna see it?

864
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,100
You wanna see what I got? Huh?

865
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:10,100
I've seen all shapes, all sizes.

866
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,800
You seen this one?

867
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,400
Get in the car.

868
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:22,100
Oh, sugar, you just gone and done
the dumbest thing in your whole life.

869
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,600
Oh, God, no!

870
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,300
This is crazy!

871
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,800
Out of nowhere, for no reason at all!

872
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,600
Go ahead.

873
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,000
Go ahead.
Go ahead.

874
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,400
- He's got the drop on her.
- He's got squat.

875
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,300
He's dead.
He's just too damn dumb to know it.

876
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,900
I got you right where I want you.

877
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,200
This is a career-ending wound, whore.

878
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:19,800
- And there's gonna be hell to pay.
- Watch your step, Jackie Boy.

879
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,300
Yeesh.

880
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
This isn't funny.

881
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:38,300
Don't anyone laugh.
I got friends you can't imagine.

882
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,600
Every one of you is gonna burn.

883
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,600
<i>(Dwight)</i> Hang it up.
She's just playing with you.

884
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,000
- You're only making it worse.
- You shut the hell up.

885
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:52,400
Don't pull the trigger.
She blocked the barrel. It'll backfire.

886
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,300
I told you to shut up.

887
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,500
I can't see.

888
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,600
What's happening?

889
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,600
I can't see.

890
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,400
I can't hear anything.

891
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,900
For God's sake, Miho, finish him.

892
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,600
Yeah.
Make it quick, will you?

893
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,500
<i>She doesn't quite chop his head off. </i>

894
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:30,500
<i>She makes a Pez dispenser out of him. </i>

895
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,000
<i>Then it's straight to business - stretching</i>
<i>the corpses out on the alley floor</i>

896
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,400
<i>and going through their pockets</i>.
<i>Divvying up cash when they find it. </i>

897
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
<i>I'm fishing around in Jackie Boy's pants. </i>

898
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,400
<i>His wallet is packed. </i>

899
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,500
<i>Mastercard. Discover</i>.
<i>Platinum American Express</i>.

900
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,800
<i>And nearly 300 bucks worth of twenties</i>

901
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:54,800
<i>that I'm not too proud</i>
<i>to stuff into my own pockets. </i>

902
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,700
<i>Then I find an atom bomb. </i>

903
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,400
<i>Jackie Boy</i>.

904
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,900
<i>You son of a bitch. </i>

905
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
<i>There was a helicopter</i>
<i>that kicked up such a racket</i>.

906
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,300
<i>- I couldn't quite make out what she said. </i>
<i>- (mouthing)</i>

907
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,800
<i>I thought Shellie said "stop. "</i>

908
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:19,500
<i>She said "cop. "</i>

909
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,800
<i>Detective Lieutenant Jack Rafferty. </i>

910
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:26,200
<i>Iron Jack. The papers call him. </i>

911
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,000
<i>A goddamn hero cop. </i>

912
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:34,300
<i>It's held for years. The shaky truce. </i>

913
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,400
<i>The cops get a slice of the profits and free</i>
<i>entertainment when they throw a party. </i>

914
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:41,300
<i>The girls get to administer</i>
<i>their own brand of justice. </i>

915
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:46,400
<i>They get to defend their own turf. </i>
<i>If a cop blunders into the neighborhood</i>

916
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,900
<i>and he's not shopping for what the girls</i>
<i>are selling. They send him packing</i>.

917
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,600
<i>But they send him back alive. </i>

918
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,800
<i>That's the rules. </i>

919
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,800
<i>That's the truce. </i>

920
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,400
<i>The cops stay out. </i>

921
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,600
<i>That keeps the girls free</i>
<i>to keep the pimps and the mob out. </i>

922
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,700
<i>Old Town will be left wide open. </i>

923
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,700
<i>It'll be war. </i>

924
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,300
<i>The streets will run red with blood -</i>

925
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,600
<i>women's blood. </i>

926
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,100
The cops!
The mob!

927
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,900
Things are gonna go back
to the way they used to be!

928
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,900
The hell they will!
We got guns.

929
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:26,000
We'll fight the cops and the mob

930
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,500
and anybody else
who tries to move in on us.

931
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,200
- We'll go to war.
- Don't be stupid.

932
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,600
You wouldn't stand a chance.
Get me a car.

933
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,900
Make sure it's a hardtop
with a decent engine.

934
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,300
I'll hide the bodies.

935
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:42,900
Did you forget that cop car
that trailed them here?

936
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,500
The cops know Rafferty came here.

937
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,600
They'll check the river,
they'll check the sewer.

938
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,600
They'll find him
and come gunning for us.

939
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:53,600
I'll haul the bodies to the pits.
The cops won't check the pits.

940
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,500
Get that gun out of my face or I'll smack ya.

941
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,500
Who do you think you are, giving orders?

942
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,500
- You got what you wanted out of us.
- Shut up, Gail.

943
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,300
You got what you wanted out of me!

944
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:09,000
And you were gone,
off playing with that barmaid.

945
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Gone until you brought
this unholy mess on us.

946
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:16,000
<i>Miho moves to my back. </i>

947
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,300
<i>One word from Gail</i>
<i>and she'll cut me in half. </i>

948
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:24,000
They'll be watching the roads.
They'll catch you.

949
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,300
It'll be the bad old days all over again.

950
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:30,100
The pimps, the beatings,
the drugs, the rapes!

951
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,100
They won't be watching the roads. Not yet,
they won't! Get me a damn hardtop!

952
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,500
If I don't make it, you can have your war.

953
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,200
Get that gun out of my face now!

954
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,400
<i>(yells)</i>

955
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:43,500
Bastard!

956
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,500
I forgot how quick you are.

957
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,200
<i>My warrior woman. </i>

958
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,900
<i>She almost yanks my head clean off</i>.

959
01:05:56,900 --> 01:06:00,300
<i>Shoving my mouth into hers</i>
<i>so hard it hurts. </i>

960
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:03,800
<i>An explosion that blasts away</i>
<i>the dull. Gray years</i>

961
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,100
<i>between the now and that one fiery night</i>
<i>when she was mine. </i>

962
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:11,800
A hardtop with a decent engine.

963
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,200
And make sure it's got a big trunk.

964
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,500
I'll always love you, baby.

965
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,400
Always... and never.

966
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,600
<i>(Dwight)</i> Where'd you find that heap?

967
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:37,200
Just look at that trunk.
We'll never fit 'em all in.

968
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:40,800
Gail? Unless there's something else
you want me to do,

969
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,800
you think maybe I could go home?

970
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,800
All this blood and stuff's got me kind of
feeling like maybe I'm gonna hurl.

971
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,300
Sure, Becky, go home.

972
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,200
But don't you talk to anybody,
not even your mom.

973
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,200
They'll never fit in that trunk.

974
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,000
Not like this, they won't.
Miho.

975
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,400
Dry your hair as soon as you get home!

976
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,600
You'll catch cold if you don't.

977
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,700
<i>(squishing sounds)</i>

978

Yeesh.

979
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:18,000
Hey, Becky.
Gail said no calls.

980
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,800
I just want to hear my mom's voice.
I won't tell her nothing.

981
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,500
Please, don't say nothing to Gail.

982
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,500
Hey, Mom?

983
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,200
<i>Dizzy dames. </i>

984
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:38,200
<i>What were they thinking. Sticking me</i>
<i>with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?</i>

985
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,100
<i>We were barely able to get the trunk</i>
<i>to stay closed as it was</i>.

986
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,800
<i>We packed it so tight. </i>

987
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:47,800
<i>There wasn't anything we could do</i>
<i>but pile Jackie Boy in right next to me</i>.

988
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,700
<i>Out where anybody who cares to look</i>
<i>will see him. </i>

989
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:56,800
<i>Go ahead. Take one of his cigarettes. </i>

990
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,700
<i>It'll help. </i>

991
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:28,500
It's got you smoking there, bud.

992
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:36,200
You shut the hell up, Jackie Boy.

993
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,500
You're dead.

994
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,500
I'm just imagining this, so shut the hell up.

995
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:47,800
Well, it tells you something
about your state of mind, don't it?

996
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,300
It's got you hearing things.

997
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,500
It's got your nerves shot.

998
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,200
It's got you smoking.

999
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:00,200
You know it's true.

1000
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,900
Nobody ever really quits.

1001
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:10,300
A smoker's a smoker
when the chips are down.

1002
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:15,200
- And your chips are down.
- I'm fine. You shut the hell up.

1003
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:19,200
Will you look at that?

1004
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,200
Ooh, those hookers let you down.

1005
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,800
What are you gonna do
when you run outta gas, call AAA?

1006
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,800
You sucker for the babes, you.

1007
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,200
You ain't even gonna make it to the pits.

1008
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,400
You shut the hell up.
I'll make it.

1009
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,800
Not unless you keep
your eyes on the road, sugar pie.

- Watch it!
<i>- (horn blaring)</i>

Ah, this is great.

01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:55,000
Just like being in a buddy movie.

1013
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,400
Shut up!

It's over.

1018
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,200
You're flushed.

1019
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:12,900
This time, I can't bring myself
to tell him to shut up.

1020
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:16,300
Sure, he's an asshole.

1021
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:19,000
Sure, he's dead.

1022
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,700
Sure, I'm just imagining that he's talking.

1023
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:26,700
None of that stops the bastard
from being absolutely right.

1024
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,400
I don't have a chance in hell
of outrunning this cop.

1025
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,700
Not in this heap.

1026
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,200
Pull over!

1027
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:40,400
The only question left
is whether I'm gonna kill him or not.

1028
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,900
Tough call.

1029
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,200
For all I know,
he's an honest cop, regular guy,

1030
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:50,200
a working stiff with a mortgage,
a wife and a pile of kids.

1031
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:52,800
My hand moves all on its own,

1032
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,800
sliding one of my guns to my lap
and thumbing back the hammer.

1033
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,900
- I don't know what to do.
- You better stop. You're making him mad.

1034
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,300

I'm the designated driver.

Well, you're driving with a busted tail light.

1039
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,500
I'll let you off with a warning.

1040
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,800
What next?

01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,800
<i>The tank goes dry</i>

01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,700
<i>Jackie Boy</i>
<i>will go into the damn tar pits</i>.

1045
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:11,700
<i>I'll catch a train out of Sacred Oaks</i>.
<i>Go home and call it a... </i>

1046
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,400
<i>(gunshot)</i>

1047
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,500
No more questions, Dallas.
Do what I say.

1048
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,300
Clear the streets.
We're in lockdown.

1049
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,100
We're not selling any tail in Old Town.

1050
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,400
Not tonight.

1051
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,500
Don't struggle.
You'll only hurt yourself.

1052
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,900
Your cause is lost.

1053
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:45,700
We know everything.

1054
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,700
Soon the corpse of Detective Rafferty
will be in our possession,

1055
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:54,900
and the truce between your prostitutes
and the police will be shattered.

1056
01:12:54,900 --> 01:12:58,200
There'll be arrests.
There'll be deaths.

1057
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,100
My employer will seize
what remains of this neighborhood.

1058
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:06,800
You will all be slaves.
Nothing can stop this.

1059
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:11,800
But it is within your power
to save many lives

1060
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,300
by facilitating the process of transition,

1061
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:21,700
by negotiating the terms
of the surrender of Old Town.

1062
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,900
Son of a bitch!
I know you.

1063
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:30,100
I have suffered your kind before -
the dregs of Sin City.

1064
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,200
I serve a new master now,

1065
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:37,100
and soon you and all your wretched kind
will serve him as well.

1066
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:42,600
Now, get dressed and shed a tear
for Dwight McCarthy if you must,

1067
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,300
because, by now, he is surely dead.

1068
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,100
You don't know him.

1069
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:52,400
My man will find a way.

1070
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,500
He always finds a way.

1071
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,100
I can't fathom
these Americans always whining

1072
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,500
and going on about how they got it so bad.

1073
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,900
This is a fine, grand country.

1074
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:07,300
Guiding light of the modern world, it is.

1075
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:10,600
Low taxes, land of opportunity.

1076
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,300
Where else would one bullet buy us
the fortune that we're getting for this?

1077
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:17,000
Sure beats the living hell
out of blowing up airports and churches

1078
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,400
without shite to show for it.

1079
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:23,300
Yeesh.

1080
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,100
You find something, Murphy?

1081
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:29,500
Looks to be a poor, dead cop's badge.

1082
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
It's all bent up.

1083
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,500
What's this stuck in it?

1084
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,500
Bloody hell.
It's the bullet.

1085
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:49,400
You son of a bitch!
Bastard!

1086
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:53,100
<i>They weren't cops. These four. </i>

1087
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,200
<i>They were mercenaries. </i>

1088
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:57,500
<i>And if they were hired</i>
<i>by who I think they were</i>.

1089
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,500
<i>The bad times haven't even started yet. </i>

1090
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,000
<i>And everything seemed</i>
<i>to be going so well. </i>

1091
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:21,200
<i>(man)</i> Remember, we don't have to
deliver every last inch of the man, Brian.

1092
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:23,600
<i>(Brian)</i> You got a good point there, Ronnie.

1093
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,900
Lend me your knife.

1094
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,100
Should I take a nap
while I'm doing all this waiting?

1095
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:33,100
I'm at the bone, all right?

1096
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,500
There we go.

1097
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:44,600
Have you ever seen anything so pretty
in your whole life?

1098
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:49,200
We'll be back for the three of you,
and if anyone happens by,

1099
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,100
use your imagination, OK?

1100
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:04,300
<i>Silence. Now. </i>

1101
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,800
<i>No air to breathe. </i>

1102
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,800
<i>Only the horrid. Oily tar taste</i>
<i>creeping up my nostrils. </i>

1103
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:16,500
<i>Let it in. </i>
<i>Let it fill your lungs. </i>

1104
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:20,200
<i>They were counting on you</i>
<i>and you blew it. </i>

1105
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,600
<i>Skinny. Steely fingers at my wrist. </i>

1106
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,300
<i>Miho. You're an angel. </i>

1107
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,300
<i>You're a saint. </i>

1108
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,600
<i>You're Mother Teresa. </i>

1109
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:35,800
<i>You're Elvis. </i>

1110
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,000
<i>You're God. </i>

1111
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:44,300
<i>And if you'd shown up ten minutes</i>
<i>earlier. We'd still have Jackie Boy's head. </i>

1112
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,700
Dwight, they got Gail!

1113
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,100
It's a cinch.
You got yourselves a spy in Old Town.

1114
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:55,000
A stoolie who sold you out to the mob.

1115
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,500
We gotta find out who it is and rescue Gail.

1116
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,600
But first, we gotta get
our hands on Jackie Boy's head

1117
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,600
before it gets to wherever it's going
and this whole situation blows wide open.

1118
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,100
Miho, I hope to hell
you left one of 'em alive enough to talk.

1119
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,400
<i>I let him know I'm not fooling around. </i>

1120
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:23,500
<i>(groans)</i>

1121
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,100
<i>We talk. </i>

1122
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:40,100
<i>Stay smart. </i>
<i>Stay cool. </i>

1123
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,600
<i>It's time to prove to your friends</i>
<i>that you're worth a damn. </i>

1124
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,800
<i>Sometimes. That means dying. </i>

1125
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,400
<i>Sometimes. It means killing</i>
<i>a whole lot of people. </i>

1126
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,900
There they are.
What do we do?

1127
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,100
We stop 'em, Dallas.

1128
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,600
<i>Jackie Boy's head is so close to me</i>

1129
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,400
<i>I could almost reach out</i>
<i>and grab it right then and there. </i>

1130
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,000
<i>(gunfire)</i>

1131
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:16,900
Get the head!
Get the head!

1132
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
I got it!
I got it!

1133
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,300
Suck on this, you stupid slag!

1134
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:37,100
<i>I can't tell if Miho is alive or dead</i>.

1135
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:41,800
<i>But I'm on my feet and every ounce of me</i>
<i>wants to get some killing done. </i>

1136
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:49,100
You want the head now, sweetheart?
So come down and get it!

1137
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,100
Brave lad.

1138
01:18:56,100 --> 01:19:00,100
I could've put a bullet
straight down your ear just now,

1139
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,900
if I hadn't got me revolver
all wet and useless.

1140
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,300
You got the drop on me, love.

1141
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,800
I'm as helpless as a baby.

1142
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,700
I got to come clean with you, sweetheart.

1143
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:23,800
It was an outright lie I was giving ya
about me revolver being wet.

1144
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,500
You see, I'm not too fond of shootin'.

1145
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,700
It's my preference to blow things up.

1146
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,100
Once you blast the roof off a pub

1147
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,000
and seen all the parts flying off people,

1148
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
a little bang bang's
never gonna match the sight of that.

1149
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,800
And here's me, with all these fine grenades
and such a sweet beauty of a remote.

1150
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:49,400
But it's me knife I'll be doing you with.

1151
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,100
You killed me mates.

1152
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,600
Someone shoulda told ya - never give
an Irishman good cause for revenge.

1153
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:00,700
<i>Deadly little Miho. </i>

1154
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,400
<i>You won't feel a thing</i>
<i>unless she wants you to. </i>

1155
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,200
<i>She twists the blade. </i>

1156
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:09,000
<i>He feels it. </i>

1157
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:15,700
<i>I tell Miho what we're gonna do</i>
<i>and how we're gonna do it. </i>

1158
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:20,300
<i>I grab poor Dallas's car phone and make</i>
<i>the most important call of my life. </i>

1159
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:25,300
<i>First. We gotta rescue Gail</i>.
<i>Then comes the kill. </i>

1160
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:29,300
<i>The big. Fat kill. </i>

1161
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:39,600
<i>(groans)</i>

1162
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Do we just gotta stand here
and watch this?

1163
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,800
What, are you kidding me, man?

1164
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,300
I could watch old Manute do his thing
all night long and not get tired of it.

1165
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,900
I mean, the man's an artist.

1166
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:55,000
Only an artist should be allowed
to touch such a beautiful subject.

1167
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Your skin is perfect.

1168
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,200
Your nerves, responsive.

1169
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,600
Beautiful.

1170
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,700
Just give them what they want, Gail.

1171
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,800
- Becky?
- It's over, Gail.

1172
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,300
There's no fighting them.
Dwight's dead.

1173
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:18,600
They got what's left of that cop we killed.

1174
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:21,700
The mob's gonna turn it over to the police
chief, the cops are gonna mow us down.

1175
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,700
We gotta cut a deal.

1176
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,400
You little bitch!

1177
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:30,500
I didn't have no choice!
They was gonna hurt my mom.

1178
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,700
You gotta cut a deal with these people.

1179
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,000
It's selfish, you holding out like this.

1180
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,700
You're gonna get a lot of girls killed
for no good reason.

1181
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,200
It wasn't your mom!

1182
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,500
We could have protected her
and you know it.

1183
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:46,200
It was the money, you stupid little bitch!

1184
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,200
Sure, there's money. Sure, you could've
moved my mom into Old Town

1185
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:53,100
and let her know
that her daughter's a goddamn whore.

1186
01:21:53,100 --> 01:21:55,300
Breaks your heart, doesn't it?

1187
01:21:55,300 --> 01:22:00,000
They offered me what you couldn't
never offer me - a way out.

1188
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I had to watch out for my own neck.

1189
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,800
Your neck.

1190
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:07,800
Your precious, scrawny, little neck!

1191
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,600
<i>(screams)</i>

1192
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:16,100
You're crazy! You could have
ripped my throat out, you crazy whore!

1193
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:21,300
Schutz, fetch my blades.

1194
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,300
- Stuka, kill this one.
- No, I was promised!

1195
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:28,200
Stupid little bitch!
You deserve worse!

1196
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,700
I knew there was a reason
I got out of bed this morning.

1197
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,800
Hey.

1198
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,100
Hey.

1199
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,600
Nobody.
I don't see nobody.

1200
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:44,400
Will you look at that?
It's right through me. Guys, look.

1201
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:47,300
There's something wrapped around it.

1202
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,100
Some kind of note.

1203
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,500
Give it to me.

1204
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:54,400
It's poked right through me.
Guys, look.

1205
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,600
- It's starting to really hurt.
- Out back. Everyone.

1206
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,500
And bring the women.

1207
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,700
Do you think somebody
should call me a doctor or something?

1208
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,400
McCarthy, you fool.

1209
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,200
Hey.

1210
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,700
Guys?

1211
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,400
Aw.

1212
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,300
<i>Dozens of them. Armed to the teeth. </i>

1213
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,600
<i>I'm outnumbered. Outgunned. </i>

1214
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:32,400
<i>But the alley is crooked</i>.
<i>Dark and very narrow. </i>

1215
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,100
<i>They can't surround me. </i>

1216
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:40,200
<i>Sometimes. You can beat the odds</i>
<i>with the careful choice of where to fight. </i>

1217
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,000
You can have Old Town, I don't care.

1218
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,800
- Just give me the woman.
<i>- (muffled speaking)</i>

1219
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:53,900
Shut up.

1220
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:57,000
Dwight, don't do this.

1221
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,300
- Hey, wait a minute. Something's not right.
- Shut up, or I'll plug you!

1222
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,000
Of course, Mr. McCarthy.
A fair trade.

1223
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,700
She's all yours.

1224
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,600
Now, if you'll explain to me why
we shouldn't blow both of you to pieces...

1225
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,400
Dwight, what have you done?

1226
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,400
Exactly what I had to.

1227
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:30,400
Every step of the way.

1228
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,000
No! It isn't right!
There wasn't no tape over his mouth!

1229
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,400
How come there's tape over his mouth?

1230
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,200
<i>Where to fight counts for a lot. </i>

1231
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:58,000
Cute trick, McCarthy,
but it will do you do good.

1232
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
<i>But there's nothing like having</i>
<i>your friends show up with lots of guns. </i>

1233
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:05,000
No!
McCarthy, you shit!

1234
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,300
<i>The girls all know the score. </i>

1235
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:17,100
<i>No escape. No surrender. No mercy. </i>

1236
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:21,000
<i>We gotta kill every last</i>
<i>rat bastard one of 'em. </i>

1237
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,300
<i>Every last one. </i>

1238
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:27,300
<i>Not for revenge</i>.
<i>Not because they deserve it</i>.

1239
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,800
<i>Not because it'll make</i>
<i>the world a better place. </i>

1240
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,900
<i>We need a heap of bloody bodies</i>

1241
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:37,900
<i>so when mob boss Wallenquist</i>
<i>looks over his charts of profits and losses</i>.

1242
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,400
<i>He'll see what it cost him</i>
<i>to mess with the girls of Old Town. </i>

1243
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:45,700
<i>The Valkyrie at my side</i>
<i>is shouting and laughing</i>

1244
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:51,100
<i>with the pure. Hateful</i>.
<i>Bloodthirsty joy of the slaughter</i>.

1245
01:25:51,100 --> 01:25:53,400
<i>And so am I.</i>

1246
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,500
<i>The fire. Baby. </i>

1247
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:03,300
<i>It'll burn us both. </i>

1248
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,300
<i>There's no place in this world</i>
<i>for our kind of fire</i>.

1249
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:11,800
<i>My warrior woman. My Valkyrie. </i>

1250
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,800
<i>You'll always be mine. </i>

1251
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,000
<i>Always... </i>

1252
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,700
<i>and never. </i>

1253
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:35,400
Evenin', officer.

1254
01:26:35,400 --> 01:26:40,500
I don't have to introduce myself, do I?
You read the papers.

1255
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:44,000
This being an election year,
you've seen plenty of my picture.

1256
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,700
You know who I am and what I can do.

1257
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,500
And I'm doin' you, Hartigan.

1258
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,300
Cold and hard, I'm doing you.

1259
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:55,600
You blew my son's ear off.

1260
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:02,200
You blew his arm off.
You even blew his nuts and his pecker off.

1261
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:08,300
He's in a coma right now.
They say he may never come out of it.

1262
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,200
My boy.

1263
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,000
He could've been the first Roark to become
the President of the United States,

1264
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,000
but you went and turned him into
a brain-damaged, dickless freak.

1265
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:21,200
Pullin' that trigger make you feel powerful?

1266
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Power don't come from a badge or a gun.

1267
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,800
Power comes from lying.

1268
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,600
Lying big, and gettin' the whole
damn world to play along with you.

1269
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,700
Once you got everybody agreeing with
what they know in their hearts ain't true,

1270
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,500
you've got 'em by the balls.

1271
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:45,900
There's what,
maybe 500 people in this hospital?

1272
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:52,100
I could pump you full of bullets right now,
and I wouldn't even be arrested.

1273
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,600
Everyone would lie for me -
everyone who counts.

1274
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,500
Otherwise, all their own lies -
everything that runs Sin City -

1275
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:02,500
it all comes tumbling down
like a pack of cards.

1276
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:06,000
<i>(laughs)</i>

1277
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:09,500
But I want you firm and fit and healthy.

1278
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,600
I'm even putting up cash of my own
to get you more surgery.

1279
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,800
Fix that heart condition of yours.

1280
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:21,400
You're gonna keep on living a long time.
I'm gonna make sure of that.

1281
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:28,100
You're gonna be convicted of raping
that little brat, and shooting my boy.

1282
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:30,600
And you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

1283
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,400
disgraced, destroyed...

1284
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,500
alone.

1285
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,400
Your wife?

1286
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,700
You tell her the truth and she's dead.

1287
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:44,800
You tell anybody the truth
and they're dead.

1288
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,600
They won't let me testify.

1289
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:53,000
I told the cops that you saved my life
and they just acted like I was crazy.

1290
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,900
They talked my parents
into keeping me away.

1291
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,600
They said that you'd done things
that you didn't do.

1292
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,100
I told them that you saved me
from that Roark creep,

1293
01:29:01,100 --> 01:29:05,100
but they won't even check me out
to see that I'm still a virgin.

1294
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,900
I'm still a virgin, still alive -
thanks to you.

1295
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:12,400
They got it all backwards.

1296
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:16,100
Sometimes, the truth
doesn't matter like it ought.

1297
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:19,800
But you'll always remember things right.

1298
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,900
That's gonna mean a lot to me.

1299
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:28,700
But stay away, Nancy.
They'll kill you if you don't stay away.

1300
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,700
Don't visit me.

1301
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,600
Don't write me.

1302
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,800
Don't even say my name.

1303
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,200
Maybe you won't let me visit,
but I'll still write to you, Hartigan.

1304
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:41,400
I'll sign my letters "Cordelia. "

1305
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:46,000
That's the name of a really cool
detective in books I read.

1306
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:50,500
I'll write you every week... for forever.

1307
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,500
Sure, kid.

1308
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:55,700
Now, run on home.

1309
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:58,000
It's not safe for you here.

1310
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,800
Bye, Nancy.

1311
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,400
I love you.

1312
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:19,800
John Hartigan.

1313
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,700
Mr. Law and Order.

1314
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:27,300
Mr. By the Book.

1315
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,400
Mr. High and Mighty.

1316
01:30:31,900 --> 01:30:35,300
I gotta give you credit, being such
a straight arrow for so damn many years

1317
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,500
without it catching up with you.

1318
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,900
It's catching up with you now,
friend of mine.

1319
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:43,100
It's catching up with you but good.

1320
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:50,100
<i>(woman)</i> Maybe I oughta look at him.
He doesn't look too good.

1321
01:30:50,100 --> 01:30:56,500
Ohh, he's hale and hearty, Tammy. See?

1322
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:00,000
He's the picture of health.

1323
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,500
That Tammy, there - she's fine, isn't she?

1324
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,800
I rented her out of Old Town.

1325
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:10,600
I wanted to show you what you won't
be getting any of, not in prison.

1326
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:12,000
You hear me, Hartigan?

1327
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,800
If you stop being stupid,
start playing along with us,

1328
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,700
you might just get some of Tammy.

1329
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:22,500
You see that?
She flinched.

1330
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,900
You make her sick.

1331
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,700
She heard about you and that little girl.

1332
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:32,200
<i>This is nothing but a price I promised</i>
<i>myself I'd pay. And I'm paying it. </i>

1333
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:36,700
<i>You don't save a little girl's life. Then</i>
<i>turn around and throw her to the dogs. </i>

1334
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,800
<i>Not in my book. You don't. </i>

1335
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:42,200
<i>They want a confession. </i>
<i>They won't get it. </i>

1336
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:49,200
<i>There was a letter from Nancy waiting</i>
<i>when they put me in solitary. </i>

1337
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:52,400
<i>She calls herself "Cordelia. "</i>
<i>Just like she promised. </i>

1338
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,200
<i>She makes no mention of anything</i>
<i>that would give her away. </i>

1339
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,300
<i>At first. I figure</i>
<i>she'll send another note or two</i>

1340
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,600
<i>before her young mind</i>
<i>moves on to better things. </i>

1341
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:06,000
<i>But every Thursday. Another one arrives. </i>

1342
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,800
<i>What a sweet kid. </i>

1343
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,400
<i>I do my best to keep my hand</i>
<i>from shaking when I reach for it. </i>

1344
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,900
<i>She's the only friend I've got -</i>
<i>the daughter I never had. </i>

1345
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:19,000
<i>My sweet Cordelia. </i>

1346
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,600
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan. </i>

1347
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,900
<i>Eight years pass. </i>

1348
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:33,300
<i>Then comes a Thursday</i>
<i>when I bound from my cot</i>.

1349
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,400
<i>Excited as a kid at Christmas</i>.

1350
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:39,100
<i>Only to find myself</i>
<i>staring at the damn floor of my damn cell</i>.

1351
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:42,300
<i>looking for a letter from Nancy</i>
<i>that isn't there. </i>

1352
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,400
<i>Then another Thursday with no letter. </i>

1353
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,300
<i>Is she all right?</i>

1354
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:49,800
<i>Did something happen to her?</i>

1355
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,400
<i>Nothing. </i>

1356
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:56,200
<i>Two months now -</i>
<i>not a word from Nancy. </i>

1357
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:59,700
<i>Did they find her?</i>
<i>Did they get to her?</i>

1358
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:03,200
<i>Of course!</i>
<i>Stupid old man. </i>

1359
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:06,900
<i>Do your math. </i>
<i>Nancy's 19 years old. </i>

1360
01:33:06,900 --> 01:33:09,500
<i>How long did you expect her</i>
<i>to keep writing?</i>

1361
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:13,300
<i>She was a saint to keep it up</i>
<i>as long as she did. </i>

1362
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:16,500
<i>She's forgotten you. Old man. </i>

1363
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,500
<i>You're alone. </i>

1364
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,900
<i>You're all alone. </i>

1365
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:32,300
<i>This guy smells awful -</i>
<i>like bad food. </i>

1366
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:35,800
<i>Like a corpse left in a garbage dumpster</i>
<i>in the middle of summer. </i>

1367
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:38,000
<i>He stinks so bad. I want to throw up. </i>

1368
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,000
<i>Practically knocked my head off</i>.
<i>The bastard. </i>

1369
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,000
<i>When I come to. I see it. </i>

1370
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:58,300
<i>The same kind of envelope</i>
<i>Nancy always uses</i>.

1371
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,800
<i>But there's no letter inside of it. </i>

1372
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:02,900
<i>There's something soft</i>.

1373
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:06,900
<i>Something that ought to be alive -</i>
<i>a hunk of meat and bone</i>

1374
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:10,900
<i>that ought to be the index finger</i>
<i>of the right hand of a 19-year-old girl. </i>

1375
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:13,300
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1376
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,200
<i>She was so careful. </i>

1377
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:18,100
<i>She never gave away</i>
<i>where she lives or where she works. </i>

1378
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,100
<i>(screams)</i>

1379
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,700
<i>I've got to get out. </i>
<i>I've got to help her. </i>

1380
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:31,900
<i>Nothing else matters -</i>
<i>not my life and not my pride. Either. </i>

1381
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,500
<i>It's only one final surrender they want. </i>

1382
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:38,200
<i>You got me. Roark. </i>
<i>You beat me. </i>

1383
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:42,500
<i>I say everything they want to hear</i>.
<i>Just the way they want to hear it. </i>

1384
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:46,000
<i>I tell them I'm a twisted</i>.
<i>Wretched child molester. </i>

1385
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,500
<i>I agree to everything they want from me. </i>

1386
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:51,600
<i>I love you. Nancy. </i>

1387
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,100
It's a lot of miles into town, Hartigan.

1388
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:13,400
- You care for a ride?
- Long as you stay in front of me.

1389
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:17,300
Prison's made you paranoid.
Talk about water under the bridge.

1390
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:19,900
Christ.

1391
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,800
Eight years.

1392
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,100
Yeah.
Eight years.

1393
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:30,500
Well, if it's any consolation to you...

1394
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,500
you made me hate myself.

1395
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,300
- Any word from Eileen?
- Yeah.

1396
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,500
She got remarried four years ago.

1397
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,800
She had two kids.
I'm sorry, John.

1398
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:53,200
Don't be.

1399
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,700
I'm glad.

1400
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:59,000
Eileen always wanted kids.

1401
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,900
She'll make a good mother.

1402
01:36:02,900 --> 01:36:07,300
Like you said, Bob -
water under the bridge.

1403
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:21,500
<i>Bob and I get on</i>
<i>with our fond farewells to each other</i>.

1404
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:25,500
<i>Then I go looking for the only human being</i>
<i>on the planet who means a damn to me -</i>

1405
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,300
<i>Nancy. </i>

1406
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,700
<i>How could they have found out it was you</i>
<i>writing all those letters to me?</i>

1407
01:36:31,100 --> 01:36:33,700
<i>How did they find out who you are?</i>

1408
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,800
<i>And what have they done to you. Baby?</i>

1409
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,800
<i>Not a sound. </i>

1410
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,600
<i>No sign of life. </i>

1411
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,400
<i>Has Roark gone to all this trouble</i>
<i>just to torture a broken old man</i>.

1412
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:53,200
<i>Like a kid poking at a fly</i>
<i>when he's already torn his wings off?</i>

1413
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,100
<i>What has he done to Nancy?</i>

1414
01:36:56,100 --> 01:36:58,800
<i>It's like all she ever does</i>
<i>is read and study and write. </i>

1415
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:04,200
<i>No diary. No phone numbers</i>
<i>or addresses written down anywhere. </i>

1416
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:09,200
<i>Closest thing to a clue</i>
<i>is a pack of matches from a lousy saloon. </i>

1417
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,600
<i>It's a long shot</i>.
<i>But maybe she's got some friends there. </i>

1418
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,500
<i>A dead end. </i>

1419
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:27,200
<i>Nancy wouldn't have anything to do</i>
<i>with a pack of drunks and losers like this. </i>

1420
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,200
<i>But if there's anything to be found here</i>.
<i>The faintest lead to wherever Nancy is</i>

1421
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:34,300
<i>or whoever kidnapped her</i>
<i>and mutilated her. This is the place. </i>

1422
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:39,500
Excuse me, miss. Wondering if you
could help me. I'm looking for somebody.

1423
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,900
Cold night like this, everybody's
looking for somebody, stranger.

1424
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:45,900
It's not like that.
Her name is Nancy.

1425
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:48,400
Eyes to the stage, pilgrim.

1426
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:51,700
She's just warming up.

1427
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:02,700
<i>Skinny little Nancy Callahan. </i>

1428
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,700
<i>She grew up. </i>

1429
01:38:04,700 --> 01:38:07,700
<i>She filled out. </i>

1430
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:11,300
<i>Nancy Callahan. 19 years old. </i>

1431
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:16,500
<i>And here I was</i>.
<i>Expecting a skinny little bookworm</i>.

1432
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:20,300
<i>Maybe a bit too shy for her own good. </i>

1433
01:38:20,300 --> 01:38:26,200
<i>How little she told me about herself</i>
<i>in all her letters for all those years. </i>

1434
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:32,800
<i>How the hell did they find her?</i>

1435
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,400
<i>Then it hits me. </i>

1436
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,700
<i>They were bluffing. </i>

1437
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:41,400
<i>I've led them straight to her. </i>

1438
01:38:49,700 --> 01:38:52,800
<i>She hasn't spotted you yet. </i>

1439
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,300
<i>Turn around and walk out the door. </i>

1440
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,300
<i>Lead the creep outside. </i>

1441
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:03,500
<i>Get that Beretta away from him somehow</i>.
<i>And kill him. </i>

1442
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:07,500
<i>I'm just a horny ex-con</i>
<i>watching an exotic dancer. </i>

1443
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:10,500
<i>Just a few seconds and she'll be safe. </i>

1444
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:14,100
<i>No. Nancy. </i>
<i>Don't notice me. </i>

1445
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:17,500
<i>Don't recognize me. </i>

1446
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:29,400
There's no time to explain.

1447
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,400
I've made a terrible mistake,
put you in terrible danger.

1448
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,900
We need to get out of here
right this second.

1449
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:38,700
Whatever you say, Hartigan.
Let me throw some clothes on.

1450
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,700
And here I'd figured you'd forgotten
all about me. Me and my dumb letters.

1451
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,100
Kept me going.

1452
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,700
Kept me from killing myself.

1453
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,400
Hurry up, will you?

1454
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:04,000
<i>- (Hartigan)</i> Maybe I should drive.
<i>- (Nancy)</i> Not a chance.

1455
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,500
Nobody but me
can keep this heap running.

1456
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:17,100
Besides, from the sound of things,
you might have to shoot somebody.

1457
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,100
- I don't have a gun.
- Under the seat.

1458
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,500
It's loaded and it works.

1459
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:28,300
Yeah, this'll do.

1460
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:31,700
Taken it to the range a couple of times.
Kicks like a mule.

1461
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:41,200
Hartigan, there's so much
I've wanted to say to you.

1462
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,900
You've never been far from my thoughts.

1463
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:47,600
I've lain awake nights, thinking of you.

1464
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:50,400
- What are you talking about?
<i>- (gunshot)</i>

1465
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:55,200
Keep driving, Nancy.
Keep driving and keep the car on the road!

1466
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
<i>She's counting on you. Old man. </i>

1467
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,900
What are you doing?

1468
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,300
<i>Prove you're still worth a damn. </i>

1469
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:13,000
Try and keep it on the road, Nancy!

1470
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:17,500
<i>He's a decent shot. </i>

1471
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:20,400
<i>He's got skill</i>.
<i>But he's in too much of a hurry. </i>

1472
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:23,400
<i>Throwing away bullets</i>
<i>like they were candy. </i>

1473
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,600
<i>He doesn't know how to take his time. </i>

1474
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:32,900
<i>Aim careful and look the devil in the eye. </i>

1475
01:41:41,500 --> 01:41:43,900
Stop the car, Nancy.
Gotta confirm the kill.

1476
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,100
- What?
- Stop the car, now!

1477
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:49,200
Right.
Stop the car, confirm the kill.

1478
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:58,700
Sorry. I got a little rattled.

1479
01:41:58,700 --> 01:42:03,100
It's OK. You did great.
Sit tight. I'll be right back.

1480
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,300
No!
Let me stay close.

1481
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,000
Nothing can happen to me
when I'm with you.

1482
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,100
Please?
Let me stay close.

1483
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,600
<i>The stink - I almost gag. </i>

1484
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,600
<i>His blood smells</i>
<i>even worse than he does. </i>

1485
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:29,700
- Jesus.
<i>- And it's all over the place. </i>

1486
01:42:29,700 --> 01:42:34,300
<i>- But the creep himself. He's gone. </i>
<i>- (siren blaring)</i>

1487
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,400
We're out of time.

1488
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:40,900
<i>The sirens - I used to welcome the sound. </i>

1489
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:44,400
<i>There's nothing to do now</i>
<i>but find a place to hole up for the night</i>.

1490
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:48,200
<i>Get Nancy calmed down. And figure out</i>
<i>what on Earth I'm going to do next. </i>

1491
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:51,800
<i>The stink - somehow it stays with us</i>
<i>all the way to the motel. </i>

1492
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,600
Nancy, I went to your apartment.

1493
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,600
Your window was thrown wide open.
The rooms looked almost empty.

1494
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:01,000
That's why I was sure
you'd been kidnapped.

1495
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,800
My window? Robbed again?
That's the third time this year!

1496
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:08,500
I swore if I ever saw you again,
I'd show you I grew up strong.

1497
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:12,200
But there I was, just like before,
scared and helpless.

1498
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:14,800
- I'm such an asshole.
- You should sit down.

1499
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
You'll feel a little bit better if you sit down.

1500
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:22,000
<i>I've never been all that good with people. </i>

1501
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,500
<i>When it comes to reassuring</i>
<i>a traumatized 19-year-old</i>.

1502
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:29,400
<i>I'm as expert as a palsy victim</i>
<i>doing brain surgery with a pipe wrench. </i>

1503
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:32,400
It's always been you, Hartigan.

1504
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
All these years.

1505
01:43:35,500 --> 01:43:38,200
It's just nerves
making you say that, Nancy.

1506
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:41,500
You're just exhausted.
You need to sleep.

1507
01:43:41,500 --> 01:43:44,700
- Sleep with me.
- Stop it, Nancy!

1508
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,300
Eight years.

1509
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:51,100
Why do you think
I kept writing you those letters?

1510
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:53,300
It wasn't just gratitude.

1511
01:43:53,300 --> 01:43:56,500
I tried to fall in love with boys.

1512
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,900
Even thought I did once or twice.

1513
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:02,900
But I was already in love... with you.

1514
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,800
That's enough.
Jesus Christ!

1515
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,200
I'm old enough to be your grandfather!

1516
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:10,900
- You're just scared.
- I'm not scared.

1517
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,300
No.

1518
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:51,800
There's wrong and there's wrong
and then there's this.

1519
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,300
For God's sakes, you're just a kid!

1520
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,300
I love you.

1521
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,500
I love you, too.

1522
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:06,400
With all my heart.

1523
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:11,000
<i>Cold shower - it helps. </i>

1524
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,300
No, Nancy.

1525
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,100
Recognize my voice, Hartigan?

1526
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:22,000
Recognize my voice,
you piece of shit cop?

1527
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,900
I look different,
but I bet you can recognize my voice.

1528
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:29,900
Sure.
I recognize your voice, Junior.

1529
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,600
<i>Everything's gone straight to hell. </i>

1530
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,100
<i>I've been suckered</i>
<i>into betraying the only friend I've got</i>.

1531
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:41,800
<i>And put her in the hands of a murdering</i>
<i>rapist I thought I'd put down for good. </i>

1532
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:46,100
<i>Suckered by a spoiled brat</i>
<i>son of a senator. </i>

1533
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:48,200
<i>It's all gone to hell. </i>

1534
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:50,200
Klump, it's me.

1535
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:53,200
I got a dead man needs to be fetched.

1536
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:55,300
I want you to set me up for a party.

1537
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:57,800
I've already got the girl, you dumb shit!

1538
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:00,700
Hey, it better be perfect
or I'm calling my dad!

1539
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:03,400
My tools better be clean and sharp.

1540
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,100
It better be ready!
It better be perfect!

1541
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,500
I get to do whatever I want,
however I want, whenever I want it!

1542
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:17,400
My dad - I'd love him if I didn't hate him.

1543
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,200
He spent a fortune
hiring every expert on the planet

1544
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:23,500
to grow back that equipment
you blew off from between my legs,

1545
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:27,900
just so the old fart can hold out
some kind of hope of having a grandkid.

1546
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:31,900
Although, as you can see,
there were some side effects.

1547
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,300
I'm not complaining, though.
Since you've been gone,

1548
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:36,200
I've been having the time of my life.

1549
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:39,800
And now you've led me back
to your darling Cordelia.

1550
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:42,000
We all wondered
who wrote all those letters.

1551
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,900
She left not a clue.

1552
01:46:45,300 --> 01:46:48,600
Clever girl.
And so pretty, so pretty.

1553
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:55,200
A little old for my taste,
but I can forgive that just this once.

1554
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:58,600
Nancy, don't scream.

1555
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,000
Whatever he does to you, don't scream.

1556
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,400
She'll scream. I'm gonna take
all night doing dear old Nancy.

1557
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,900
And you're gonna die knowing
that it's all your fault.

1558
01:47:08,900 --> 01:47:11,700
They've all screamed, Hartigan.

1559
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:14,500
Dozens of them - maybe a hundred.

1560
01:47:14,500 --> 01:47:17,800
Eight years' worth.
Every one of them has screamed.

1561
01:47:17,800 --> 01:47:20,100
And if there weren't
so many people hereabout,

1562
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:24,100
I would show you how
I'm gonna make dear old Nancy scream.

1563
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:26,900
It's gonna be one hell of a show!

1564
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,700
<i>(he chokes)</i>

1565
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,600
<i>This is it. </i>
<i>No way to fight it now. </i>

1566
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:41,800
<i>No hope left. </i>

1567
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,600
<i>No chance. </i>

1568
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,400
<i>This is it. </i>
<i>This is the end. </i>

1569
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:51,300
<i>No. </i>

1570
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:56,200
<i>Give it a shot. Old man. </i>
<i>Keep your neck tight. Move. </i>

1571
01:47:56,200 --> 01:48:00,200
<i>The window - maybe there's an alarm. </i>
<i>The window. </i>

1572
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:02,900
<i>Keep your neck tight. Goddamn it!</i>
<i>Stay conscious!</i>

1573
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:05,800
<i>Stay conscious. </i>

1574
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,000
<i>No alarm. </i>

1575
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,900
<i>The glass! Cut the rope. </i>

1576
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,800
<i>You can do it. </i>
<i>You can do it. </i>

1577
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,600
<i>(Klump)</i> It is inclement upon me

1578
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:19,000
to comment with marked displeasure
on your rash impulsiveness

1579
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:25,800
in selecting such an eye-catching
and impractical car to heist, Mr. Shlubb.

1580
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:31,500
Irrelevant to said mission is the following
query, which I now put forth to you.

1581
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:37,800
Wherein this most streamlined
and trunkless of transports -

1582
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,400
boner-inspiring though it may be -

1583
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:45,300
wherein are we to reposit
our recently deceased cargo?

1584
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:52,200
I can only express puzzlement
that borders on alarm.

1585
01:48:56,700 --> 01:49:00,500
Tell me where Roark takes the girls
or I'll cut your damn head off!

1586
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:02,200
In plain English, creep!

1587
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:06,000
The answer you seek is rural,
even agrarian.

1588
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:09,400
The farm!

1589
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:13,300
<i>That's all I need to hear. </i>
<i>Every cop on the force</i>

1590
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:17,300
<i>knows about the Roark family's farm</i>
<i>and to stay away from it. </i>

1591
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:19,800
<i>Shlubb and Klump</i>
<i>were packing an arsenal. </i>

1592
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:23,100
<i>Once things get loud</i>.
<i>I'll probably have use for the cannons. </i>

1593
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:26,100
<i>But at first. I'll have to play it quiet. </i>

1594
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:28,400
<i>Quiet and nasty. </i>

1595
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:32,400
<i>Nancy's car - six miles from the farm. </i>

1596
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:35,700
<i>"Nobody but me can keep</i>
<i>this heap running. " she told me. </i>

1597
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:39,300
<i>Good girl. </i>
<i>The car stalled out on that yellow bastard</i>

1598
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,700
<i>and you didn't tell him</i>
<i>how to start it up again. </i>

1599
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:45,700
<i>You kept your mouth shut. </i>
<i>I'll bet Junior was furious. </i>

1600
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:48,400
<i>I'll bet he slapped you around</i>
<i>something fierce. </i>

1601
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,400
<i>But you stayed strong. </i>
<i>You bought a few extra minutes. </i>

1602
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,800
<i>There's still a chance. Nancy. </i>

1603
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,700
<i>Don't scream. </i>

1604
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:01,300
<i>I ditch the car a mile or so from the farm</i>
<i>and make my way through the woods. </i>

1605
01:50:01,900 --> 01:50:05,400
<i>I'm not halfway there when it hits. </i>

1606
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:10,000
<i>My heart. </i>
<i>Can't be my heart. </i>

1607
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,900
<i>I was cured. </i>

1608
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,900
<i>Bad cough - blood in it. </i>

1609
01:50:16,400 --> 01:50:18,100
<i>Doesn't matter now. </i>

1610
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:21,300
<i>I don't have to stay alive</i>
<i>that much longer. Anyway. </i>

1611
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,400
<i>Rotten way to kill a man. But it's quiet. </i>

1612
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:37,500
<i>Hate yourself later. </i>

1613
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,700
<i>(slapping)</i>

1614
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:52,200
You're only making this worse for yourself,
you stupid cow!

1615
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:03,700
Do you think I'm tired?

1616
01:51:03,700 --> 01:51:06,000
Is that it?
Do you think I'm getting tired?

1617
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,400
You're the one who's gonna crack!

1618
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,500
You'll crack!

1619
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:13,600
You'll cry and beg!

1620
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:15,400
You'll scream!

1621
01:51:15,400 --> 01:51:20,200
Oh, yeah, you'll scream,
you big, fat, ugly cow!

1622
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,700
You'll scream!

1623
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:29,900
You're thinking the whip
was the worst I could do?

1624
01:51:30,500 --> 01:51:33,000
That was foreplay.

1625
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,100
Hartigan was right about you.

1626
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:39,500
You can't get it up unless I scream.

1627
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:43,000
You're pathetic!

1628
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:46,400
You're pathetic.

1629
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:51,800
It's not wise at all
to make fun of me like that.

1630
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:55,800
It brings out the worst in me.

1631
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,100
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1632
01:52:04,100 --> 01:52:06,300
<i>In too much of a hurry. </i>

1633
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:10,900
Damn!
It can't be!

1634
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:15,000
<i>Charging in like Galahad</i>.
<i>Just like I told myself I wouldn't!</i>

1635
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,300
<i>Stupid old man!</i>

1636
01:52:16,300 --> 01:52:20,300
- You tagged him good!
- Don't take no chances. Perforate the fool.

1637
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,100
Good advice.

1638
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,600
Give it up, Junior.

1639
01:52:39,600 --> 01:52:41,800
It's over.
Let her go.

1640
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,600
You're dreaming, Hartigan!

1641
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:48,600
I get to see your eyes while I fillet the
woman of your dreams right in front of you!

1642
01:52:48,600 --> 01:52:51,800
Look at you!
You're about to keel over!

1643
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:54,700
You can't even lift that cannon!

1644
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:57,000
Sure, I can.

1645
01:53:00,100 --> 01:53:01,700
<i>(laughs)</i>

1646
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:06,600
You gave me a scare there
for a second there, old man.

1647
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:09,600
Nancy, I'm sorry.

1648
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:13,100
I'm taking no chances with you.

1649
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:19,100
First I soften you up,
and then it's showtime.

1650
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,800
Here it comes.

1651
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,300
It's gonna hurt.

1652
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,300
You're right about that.

1653
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,100
Sucker.

1654
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,200
<i>I take away his weapon. </i>

1655
01:53:43,100 --> 01:53:44,500
<i>Both of them. </i>

1656
01:53:44,500 --> 01:53:46,900
<i>(screaming)</i>

1657
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:00,000
Eight long years, son of a bitch!

1658
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:05,000
<i>After a while. All I'm doing is pounding</i>
<i>wet chunks of bone into the floorboards</i>.

1659
01:54:05,100 --> 01:54:06,300
<i>So I stop. </i>

1660
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:10,400
So long, Junior.

1661
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,900
Been a pleasure.

1662
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:21,800
I didn't scream, Hartigan, not once.

1663
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,900
I didn't scream.

1664
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:27,100
I know it, baby.

1665
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:29,500
You grew up strong.

1666
01:54:40,900 --> 01:54:44,300
<i>By the time I get her to the car</i>.
<i>Nancy stops shaking. </i>

1667
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:48,300
<i>Her skin is warm again. </i>
<i>She's herself again. </i>

1668
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:50,800
Thanks for remembering my coat.

1669
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:54,200
And for all the little things.

1670
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:58,400
Like saving my life, twice.

1671
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:02,600
- You better get rolling.
- You're not coming along?

1672
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:07,600
No. I have friends on their way,
to collect evidence.

1673
01:55:07,600 --> 01:55:10,400
I'm gonna blow
this whole sick mess wide open.

1674
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,800
I'm gonna clear my name.

1675
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,800
I'm gonna put Senator Roark
behind bars where he belongs.

1676
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:20,600
I can't lose you, not again.

1677
01:55:22,900 --> 01:55:25,900
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

1678
01:55:38,700 --> 01:55:42,500
<i>Nancy Callahan. The love of my life. </i>

1679
01:55:43,900 --> 01:55:48,400
<i>Shame to lie to her. </i>
<i>I hope she forgives me for it. </i>

1680
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,100
<i>Get Senator Roark behind bars?</i>
<i>Sure. </i>

1681
01:55:52,100 --> 01:55:55,700
<i>And maybe after I've pulled off</i>
<i>that miracle. I'll go and punch out God. </i>

1682
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:59,600
<i>There isn't a prosecutor in the state</i>
<i>who'll go after Senator Roark. </i>

1683
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:01,800
<i>I killed his only son. </i>

1684
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:04,000
<i>The bloodline is cut. </i>

1685
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,000
<i>Roark's lost his goddamn legacy. </i>

1686
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,800
<i>He'll use all his power</i>
<i>to get revenge on me. </i>

1687
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:13,400
<i>He'll go after me through Nancy. </i>
<i>He'll find her again. </i>

1688
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:16,000
<i>There'll be no end to it. </i>

1689
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,300
<i>She'll never be safe. </i>

1690
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:21,000
<i>Not as long as I'm alive. </i>

1691
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,600
<i>There's only one way to beat him. </i>

1692
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:26,900
<i>An old man dies</i>.

1693
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:29,200
<i>A young woman lives. </i>

1694
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:32,500
<i>Fair trade. </i>

1695
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,500
<i>I love you. Nancy. </i>

1696
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,800
<i>(Becky)</i> Uh-huh.

1697
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,600
Yes.

1698
01:56:47,600 --> 01:56:50,000
Oh, Mom, don't go on like that.

1699
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,200
It's not the city. I could've gotten
in a traffic accident anywhere.

1700
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:58,900
Yeah, just a fracture.
The doctor said it's a clean break.

1701
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:01,300
It should be right as rain in no time.

1702
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Uh-huh.

1703
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:17,400
Mm-hm.

1704
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:23,900
<i>(man) Turn the right corner in Sin City</i>

1705
01:57:23,900 --> 01:57:28,500
<i>and you can find anything. </i>

1706
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,200
Becky.

1707
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,900
Care for a smoke?

1708
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:39,200
Love you, too, Mom.

1709
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,500
<i>Anything. </i>
