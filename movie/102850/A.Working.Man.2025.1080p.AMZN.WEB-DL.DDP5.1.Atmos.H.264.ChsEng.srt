00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,540
我想你
I miss ya.

288
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,040
我担心你
I worry about ya,

289
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,350
但你没必要专程跑来假装征求我的同意
but you didn't have to come down here and pretend that

290
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,210
反正你早就下定决心了
you needed my permission for something

291
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,580
你早就拿定主意了
you already made your mind up about.

292
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,050
进来吧 该吃饭了
Get in here. We're eating.

293
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,040

谢谢你能来
Thanks for coming.

295
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
他在哪儿？
Where is he?

296
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,270
楼上 左边第一个门
Upstairs. First door on your left.

297
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,830
《月光奏鸣曲》
"Moonlight Sonata".

298
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,440
-对 -弹得真美
-Yeah. -It's beautiful.

299
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,470
她为了去商学院拒绝了音乐奖学金
She turned down a music scholarship

300
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,810
说要像她爸爸一样
to go to business school.

301
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
想当个地产大亨
She wanted to be like her pops.

302
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,180
做大型土地开发
Be a big land developer.

303
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,650
她会的
And she will.

304
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,150
嗯
Yeah.

305
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,560
不用了 谢谢
Nah. No, thanks.

306
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,930
你的家人需要希望
Your family needs hope.

307
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,830
但我没法以这副模样面对他们
But I can't face 'em like this.

308
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,770
我妻子去世后
When my wife passed,

309
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,740
我离开了皇家海军陆战队
and I left the Royal Marines,

310
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,740
很多人都觉得我废了
a lot of people would've given up on me.

311
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,910
但你们对我很有耐心
But you were patient with me.

312
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,780
-你 卡拉 珍妮 -珍妮
-You, Carla, Jenny. -Jenny.

313
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,990
你们就是我的家人
You're my family.

314
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,310
看着我 兄弟
Look at me, brother.

315
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,380
我会带她回家
I'm gonna bring her home.

316
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,610
我保证
I promise.

317
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,850
我一定会带她回家
I'm gonna bring her home.

318
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,080
"斯基普酒吧"

319
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,940
非常感谢 不错吧兄弟？
Thank you very much. Good, bro?

320
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,870
你没事吧？嗯？
You good? Yeah?

321
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,550
你怎么样？
How you doing?

322
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,380
你需要来点餐后酒提提神
You need a little aperitif, you know?

323
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,350
好吧
All right.

324
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,960
嘿 小子 走错门了
Oh, yo. Wrong house, kid.

325
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,260
滚出去
Get the fuck out.

326
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,330
你好啊 强尼
Hello, Johnny.

327
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,990
想赛跑吗？看谁赢？
Wanna have a race? See who wins?

328
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,970
双手举起来 站起来
Hands up. Stand up.

329
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,200
手指交叉放在脑后
Place your fingers behind your head.

330
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,340
你是条子？
You a cop?

331
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,600
你巴不得我是条子
You wish I was a cop.

332
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,540
你的冒险结束了 小子
Your adventure, kid.

333
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,390
那女孩在哪儿？
Where's the girl?

334
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,390
什么女孩？
What girl?

335
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,460
失踪的女孩
The missing girl.

336
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,600
你朋友从酒吧后门掳走的那个
The one your friends snatched outta the back of the bar.

337
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,770
我告诉过条子 她自己喝醉跑了
I told the cops. She ran off. Drunk or somethin'.

338
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,200
这傻逼连酒都拿不稳
Fuckin' poobutt can't hold her drink.

339
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,140
关我屁事？
How's that my problem?

340
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,340
人会说谎
People lie.

341
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,580
你撒谎吗 强尼？
Do you lie, Johnny?

342
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,580
我不相信人
I don't trust people.

343
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,550
我只信生物学
I trust biology.

344
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
我们的生理反应都一样
We're all wired the same.

345
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,390
给老子起来
Get the fuck up.

346
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,470
去你妈的
Fuck you.

347
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,610
你的大脑知道自己在浴缸里
Your mind knows you're in the bathtub

348
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,140
只是盖了条湿毛巾
and it's just a wet towel.

349
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,310
但肾上腺素会让心跳加速
But adrenaline makes your heart race,

350
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,120
耗氧量增加
so you burn more air.

351
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,120
神经系统会误以为你在溺水
Your nervous system tells you that you're drowning.

352
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,520
你老板知道你在吧台贩毒吗？
Your bosses know you deal dope over the bar top?

353
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,820
偷收银机的钱？
Steal from the till?

354
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,060
操你妈！
Fuck you!

355
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,110
你知道这些人手段多狠
You know these guys are next level.

356
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,180
他们会灭人满门
They wipe out entire fucking bloodlines.

357
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,210
有道理
Fair enough.

358
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,050
但你要明白 名字我拿定了
Just know you're giving me names.

359
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
方式你选
Your choice how.

360
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,150
强尼？
Johnny?

361
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,160
你在哪儿 兄弟？
Where are you, brother?

362
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,760
在等帮手？
You're expecting company?

363
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,400
操 当然在等
Damn fuckin' right, I am.

364
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,000
开门！不然宰了你！
Open the door. Fuckin' kill you.

365
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,190
俄国佬
Russians.

366
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,990
该死
Fuck.

367
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,450
对不起 妈妈
I'm sorry, Mom.

368
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,060
我为……感到抱歉
I'm sorry for...

369
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,730
用成就的外衣……
shielding myself...

370
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,460
包裹真实的自己
in a blanket of accomplishments.

371
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,030
多希望你能看到……
I wish you could've seen me...

372
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,370
真实的我
who I really am.

373
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,740
只想和你一样坚强
Just want to be strong like you.

374
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,980
我为什么在这儿？
What am I doing here?

375
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,110
最好开着免提 让你亲耳听听 老板
on speaker It's better you see for yourself, boss.

376
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,580
不是什么大事
It's not a big problem.

377
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,480
你们两个他妈干了什么？
What the fuck have you two done, huh?

378
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,690
他们为什么互相开枪？
Why'd they shoot each other?

379
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,100
这太不专业了
This is very unprofessional.

380
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,430
强尼没分寸 是个懦夫
Johnny has no control. He's a weak man.

381
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,100
可能他说疯话 然后就突突了
Maybe he talk crazy, and then it's bang-bang time.

382
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,000
-"突突"？-对啊
-"Bang-bang time"? -Yeah.

383
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,410
突突时间
Bang-bang time.

384
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,640
发现有什么不同吗？
You notice anything different?

385
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,910
你的发型
Your hair.

386
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,010
白痴
Idiot.

387
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,880
我的钱呢？
Where is my fucking money?

388
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,520
你觉得这是抢劫？
You think this was a robbery?

389
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,220
不可能
Impossible.

390
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,720
没人敢抢我们 除非又蠢又疯
No one would rob us. No one is that stupid,

391
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,960
或者既蠢又疯
or that crazy.

392
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,820
这是霰弹枪伤口
This is a shotgun wound.

393
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,120
看到霰弹枪了吗？
You see any shotguns?

394
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
-嗯？-少了九捆
-Hmm? -That's nine bands missing.

395
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,960
我们的九万美金不见了！
Ninety thousand dollars of our fucking money!

396
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,330
是赛蒙的钱
It's Symon's money.

397
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,350
嘿 宝贝
Hey, sweetheart.

398
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,150
爸爸你在干嘛？
Hey, Daddy, what are you doing?

399
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,680
呃 没什么 就在……
Uh, nothin'. Just, uh...

400
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,150
处理点工作
Just some work.

401
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,690
-你在学校吗？-对
-Are you in school? -Yeah.

402
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,390
这时候该用学校电话打给我吗？
You supposed to be calling me from school?

403
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,630
不该
No.

404
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,430
一切都好吗？
Everything okay?

405
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,930
嗯 就想说声"嗨" 爱你爸爸
Yeah, I just wanted to say, "hi." Love you, Daddy.

406
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,700
我也爱你
Love you, too.

407
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,930
拜
Bye.

408
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,940
这门他妈会自动开？
The fucking door opens itself?

409
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,100
我不喜欢这样
I don't like this.

410
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,500
整晚床上就我一人
I'm alone in the bed all night.

411
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
你吃
You eat.

412
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,980
来床上躺会儿
You come to bed for a bit.

413
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,790
你以为钱是从天上掉下来的？
You think the money falls from the sky?

414
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,080
希望你不介意
Hope you don't mind.

415
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
我饿了
I was hungry.

416
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,590
觉得我们可以聊聊
Thought we could have a little chat.

417
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,490
我要撕胶带了
I'm gonna take the tape off.

418
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,630
但如果你控制不住音量……
But if you can't control your volume...

419
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,500
就下水待着
You go in the water.

420
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,210
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you know who I am?

421
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,310
我需要知道吗？
Should I?

422
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,340
你显然不知道自己惹了谁
You clearly have no idea who you fuck with.

423
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,150
尽管自嗨 说出来
Make yourself happy. Tell me.

424
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,820
你听说过我们吗？
You have heard of us?

425
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,320
当然
I have.

426
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,650
真的？
Really?

427
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,820
"盗贼"
The Vor.

428
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,690
兄弟会 盗贼联盟
The Bratva. The Brothers.

429
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,890
现在怎么自称都行
The League of Thieves.

430
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,900
随便你们俄国黑帮
Whatever Russian gangsters

431
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,760
现在喜欢叫什么

爷爷呢？他从不会迟到

他没回我消息

我给他发了快二十条信息

他肯定没事
I'm sure he's fine.

821
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,430
你没杀他吧？
You didn't kill him, did you?

822
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:18,100
老爸 我开玩笑的
Dad, I'm kidding.

823
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,470
你信我吗？

所以如果我告诉你一件事
So, if I tell you something,

826
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,140
你知道可以相信我 对吧？
you know you can believe me, right?

827
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,980
铺垫这么多只会更吓人
Okay, the build-up is just making it worse.

828
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,510
我犯了大错
I made a big mistake.

829
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,950
天啊 你真杀了爷爷？

梅瑞 我是认真的

有些狠角色在追杀我
Some really bad people are after me,

832
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,090
我不想连累我爱的人受伤

833
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,360
你和爷爷共享位置了吗？
Are you sharing your location with Grandpa?

834
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,890
嗯

835
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,630
你能看到他位置吗？
Can you see his location?

836
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,190
可能吧 我不确定

837

老爸 他在家

838
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,990
梅瑞 待在这儿别动 好吗？

俄罗斯黑手党？
Russian mafia?

843
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,480
对
Yes.

844

他们是来找你的

845
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,890
这事全因你而起
This happened because of you.

846
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,120
暴力如影随形跟着你
Violence follows you like a cloud.

847
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,430
他本可以不管你 爷爷
He could've left you in there, Grandpa.

848
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,190
他救了你的命

849
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,100

该让警察处理了

855
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,880

862
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:20,380
他在乡下有栋房子

863

老兄 出啥事了？

869
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,240
惹错人了 对吧？

870
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,340
嘿 你本可以拦住我
Hey, you could've stopped me.

871
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,240
这世上谁能拦得住你？
What force on earth is gonna stop you?

872
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,180
情况越来越糟了
It's gettin' ugly.

873

所有线索都指向他
All roads lead to him.

879
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,500
你靠杀人闯进这浑水
Now, you killed your way into this,

880
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,600
也得靠杀人才能脱身
you're gonna have to kill your way out of it.

881
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,940

888
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,390
绕过这面墙
If you come around this wall,

889
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,530
你会看到AK自动步枪

it's the Chevy Impala of the war on terror.

894
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,070
这把MP5 SD适合暗杀
Beautiful MP5 SD here if you wanna kill somebody,

895
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,840
杀人时不会吵醒邻居
but you don't wanna wake 'em up.

896
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,210
但这才是真正的猛兽
But this is the real beast here.

There you go.

902
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,740
得把序列号钻掉
I'll have to drill out the serial numbers.

903
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,110
不用 已经处理好了
Oh, no, that's already done.

904
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,610
这些枪从未存在过 哪儿都没有
These were never here. Never anywhere.

905
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,050
就像我们当年一样

What about school?

913
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,740
最多缺几天课

01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,170
操
Fuck.

1005
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,340
滚开！住手！
Get away! Stop!

1006
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:05,040
明天开始 戒断治疗
Starting tomorrow, rehab.

1007
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:09,340
你只会放任我在泥潭里越陷越深
All you do is let me slip down slippery slope.

1008
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:12,840
你本该是我的支柱
You're supposed to be my rock.

1009
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,780
就像人们说的 "她是我的靠山"
You know, like they say, "Oh, she's my rock."

1010
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:16,480
"多谢了 "可你根本不配
"Hey, thank you." I have nothing to thank you for.

1011
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:30,460
知道吗？你就是个纵容者
You know what? You are just an enabler.

1012
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:37,200
他来了！
he's here!

1013
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,100
行
Okay.

1014
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:10,500
行 你表态了
Okay. You made your point.

1015
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:11,870
现在谈条件 你从此
Now we make a deal, and you begin

1016
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,640
当个有钱人 如何？
a new life as a wealthy man, huh?

1017
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,710
我能自力更生
I can pay my own bills.

1018
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,780
恭喜啊
Congrats.

1019
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,150
-再靠近她就死 -别！
-Come closer and she dies. -No!

1020
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,310
我料到了
I figured that.

1021
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:27,390
你该消失 拿钱走人
You should disappear. Take the money.

1022
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:29,850
过好日子去
Make a nice life.

1023
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,170
她在哪？
Where is she?

1024
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:50,180
我不认识这女人
I do not know this woman.

1025
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,840
你撒谎太烂
You're a bad liar.

1026
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,150
何必赌上一切？
Why risk everything?

1027
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,780
为何为她杀这么多人？
Why kill everyone for her?

1028
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,650
因为我承诺护她周全
'Cause I told her I had her back.

1029
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:09,260
如果我交出这女人
If I give you this woman,

1030
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,260
能活命吗？
you let me live?

1031
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,200
要是我直接给地址
Because if I just give you the address,

1032
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,700
你会毙了我吧？
then you shoot me, huh?

1033
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,910
若你给假地址 我再毙你呢？
What if you give me a fake address and I shoot you?

1034
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,280
两败俱伤罢了
That's bad for both of us.

1035
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,590
沿57号公路往南
Head south on 57.

1036
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,220
到了再给你地址
Then I give you her address.

1037
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,220
走
Let's go.

1038
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,260
你认识这人？
You know this guy?

1039
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:44,060
当然 他是蝰蛇
Of course, I know. He's Viper.

1040
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,700
人力资源部主管
He's Chief of Human Resource Department

1041
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:49,770
专招特殊项目人手
and recruiting for special projects.

1042
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,040
为一个妓女豁出命？
Why you do all this for a whore?

1043
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,080
再说一遍
Say it again.

1044
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,250
有胆再说
Please, say that again.

1045
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,750
果然怂了
Thought so.

1046
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,250
听着 迪米
Okay, Dimi,

1047
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,250
说目的地
tell me where we're going.

1048
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:09,750
她在哪？
Where is she?

1049
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,390
那里
There.

1050
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,020
她在里面？
She's in there?

1051
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,950
对
She's there.

1052
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:41,220
没骗我？
Promise?

1053
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:42,920
保证
I promise.

1054
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
就在里面
She's there.

1055
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:01,810
为何是她？
Why her?

1056
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,240
谁定的？
Who decides?

1057
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:11,350
蝰蛇去夜店
Viper goes to club,

1058
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,820
拍下漂亮姑娘
takes pictures of pretty girls.

1059
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:16,350
我发给客户 他们挑
I send them to clients, they make choice.

1060
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:19,020
安排见面
Meeting is arranged.

1061
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,190
这是我的专长服务
This is my specialty service.

1062
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:25,730
像买雪地胎一样简单
Like shopping for a set of snow tires.

1063
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,440
她们是人！
These are human beings.

1064
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:37,340
你以为钱会在乎
You think money gives a shit

1065
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,740
来源干不干净？
where it comes from?

1066
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,480
我不干这行
If I didn't do this,

1067
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,950
别人也会干
somebody else would.

1068
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,920
你还没说为何追杀我们
You still haven't told me why.

1069
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,750
为何猎杀我们？
Why do you hunt us?

1070
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,460
你有闺女吗？
You have a daughter?

1071
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,920
没有
No.

1072
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,890
那你永远不懂
Then you won't understand.

1073
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,160
嘿 干得漂亮
Hey, good lookin' out.

1074
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,300
兄弟 没事吧？

和迪米搭线那混蛋

所有人
Everybody,

1080
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,850

照他说的做！抄家伙！
You heard the man. Mount up!

1082
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,540

That's funny shit.

1083
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,130

我不认同这种行为

1085

嘿 到点了
Hey. It's time.

1087

1088
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:43,150
我去叫那变态
Yeah. I'll get the pervert.

1089
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:47,190
咱们都是棋子 小子 别往心里去
We're all just numbers, kid. Nothin' personal.

1090
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:49,560
我觉得挺私人的
Feels pretty fuckin' personal to me.

1091

01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,680
机不可失
It's now or never.

那就走
Then it's now.

1095
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:48,320

没有
Nothing.

1097
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,690

That's the best part.

1098
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,430
我好奇你的内脏...
I wonder what you look like on...

1099
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:03,740
长什么样
the inside.

1100
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,390
刚什么动静？
The fuck was that?

1101
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:22,620
哇哦

01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,520
他们在开枪？
Are they fucking shooting?

1104
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:54,550
现在谁要完蛋了 嗯？

正在扫射
Shooting the place up.

1107

所有人
Everybody,

1108
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:20,440

You got it.

1120
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,600
我开始觉得
I'm beginning to think

1121
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,000
你根本不知道自己在干嘛！
that you do not know what you are doing!

1122
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,200
别慌 先生
Don't worry, sir.

1123
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,670
一切尽在掌控
Everything's under control.

1124

我保证
I promise you.

1125
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,250
我要挖出你的心
I'm gonna cut your heart out.

1126
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:33,480

Good luck.

1127
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,790
你真名叫什么？
What the fuck is your real name?

1128

本不想与你为敌
My fight wasn't with you.

1133
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:23,470
我懂 兄弟
I know, brother.

1134
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,400
做个了结吧
Finish it.

1135
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:48,430
对不住了 兄弟
Sorry, brother.

1136
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:09,710
-莱文！-搞什么鬼？
-Levon! -What the fuck?

1137
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,720
你敢闯进来？

1138
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,330
-操！该死！-妈的！
-Fuck! Shit! -Oh, fuck!

1139
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,860
这下糟了
Oh, that is not good.

1140
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:29,500
什么情况？
What the fuck?

1141
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,340
-撑住 -换弹！
-Hang on. -Reload!

1142
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:32,840
等等 等等

1143
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:33,770

No!

1146
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:49,650
