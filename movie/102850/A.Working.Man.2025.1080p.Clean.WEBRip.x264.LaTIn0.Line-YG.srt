1
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,360
I brought you something.

2
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
No, no, no, please.

3
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,100
You heard that your family is going to

4
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,200
be upset.

5
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,180
No, Jasmine prepared it with pleasure for you.

6
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,360
Boss, please, take it.

7
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,660
Tell him thank you.

8
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,280
Listen, this is going to be a hard

9
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:13,380
day.

10
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,320
There will be inspections all day, construction and

11
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,740
demolition forms, and deliveries in the middle of

12
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,079
everything.

13
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,440
If you make an effort, you will have

14
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:24,880
a bonus.

15
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,260
Understood?

16
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,780
Tell him everything, guys, everything.

17
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,020
I hope you go home with the same

18
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,100
number of fingers as you arrived.

19
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,500
Very well.

20
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,720
Come, brothers.

21
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,100
Hello.

22
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,040
How are you?

23
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,380
Very well.

24
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:57,800
Thank you.

25
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,200
Hey, Lebon, no one has asked you for

26
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,720
money today?

27
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,220
No.

28
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,520
Because apparently I am the only one in

29
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,080
the family who can take care of the

30
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,420
accounting.

31
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,420
Oh, sorry.

32
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,400
Now that we are abusive parents, we force

33
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,360
her to work a few hours.

34
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:11,980
Why today?

35
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,780
Hurry up and finish calculating.

36
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,000
There are many trucks waiting for their payments.

37
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,600
Pay me.

38
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,140
Pay you?

39
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,400
Why?

40
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,740
For 19 years of free rent, food, education,

41
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,340
university, makeup, karate classes.

42
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:25,620
Really?

43
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,220
Continue.

44
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,880
No, it's okay.

45
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,420
Lebon, sign this, please.

46
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,120
Dad.

47
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:30,720
What?

48
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,920
This day will be disgusting.

49
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,400
I know.

50
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,900
You scheduled things at the same time.

51
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,560
You're right.

52
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,160
Hi, yes, I'm calling about construction, Garcia and

53
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,420
family.

54
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,700
My name is Carla.

55
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,620
Don't make me wait.

56
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
Just tell me if it was the delivery

57
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,140
today.

58
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:42,900
Dad, come here.

59
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,500
Yes, wait.

60
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,000
I need this for today.

61
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,540
That's crazy.

62
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,320
What?

63
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,600
Is it for a wedding or what?

64
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,920
No, it's for tonight.

65
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,480
The semester is over.

66
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,260
Let's celebrate.

67
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,800
Hey, it's just a semester.

68
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,440
Exactly.

69
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,280
It's a big step.

70
00:05:59,520 --> 00:05:59,880
Really?

71
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:00,520
Yes.

72
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,080
Really?

73
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,460
Hey, it could be worse.

74
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,460
Listen, we're all going to cooperate.

75
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:04,980
Yes.

76
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,740
It's a party van.

77
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,280
Of course.

78
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,140
And the restaurant reservation.

79
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,520
Yes, you know how to save, right?

80
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,020
Please.

81
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,840
I just need the card.

82
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,160
Daughter, I can't.

83
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,960
I don't have it.

84
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,120
I understand.

85
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,580
Okay, I don't need it.

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,580
Give her what she wants.

87
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,780
No, mom.

88
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,100
I can fix it.

89
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,080
No, no, no, no.

90
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,320
No one discusses that.

91
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,280
The party van is essential, right?

92
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,180
They finished a semester.

93
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,160
Here.

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,160
Thank you.

95
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,790
Excuse me.

96
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,370
He has to go back to work.

97
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,450
Get out of here.

98
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,090
This is none of your business.

99
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,250
Don't worry, boss.

100
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,650
I'll be there in five minutes.

101
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,670
Get out of here.

102
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,170
Get out of here.

103
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:21,970
Hey.

104
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,270
Let's go.

105
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:25,930
Let's go upstairs.

106
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:27,670
Go upstairs.

107
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:38,940
Wait, for fuck's sake.

108
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,620
Put the guns down.

109
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,220
I was respectful.

110
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,340
A no.

111
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,520
Get out.

112
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,000
Get up.

113
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,780
And don't move.

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Let's go.

115
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,060
Did you hear that?

116
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,720
Let's go.

117
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,120
Are you okay?

118
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,080
How did he do that?

119
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,820
We have to go back to work.

120
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,440
This way.

121
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,120
To the right.

122
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,220
Thank you.

123
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,480
Lemon.

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,960
For fuck's sake.

125
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,960
Did you learn it in the army?

126
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,600
You didn't see anything.

127
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,140
If my dad knew, he would shit himself.

128
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,440
Will you teach me?

129
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,600
My grandfather was a paratrooper.

130
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,919
He taught me to crack fingers and track

131
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,400
animals.

132
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,020
Crack fingers?

133
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:39,860
Yes.

134
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,020
My grandmother made you tinga.

135
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,740
It's chicken.

136
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,680
Very tasty.

137
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,160
And she also made you her famous handmade

138
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,580
tortillas.

139
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,600
Why does everyone want to feed me?

140
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,720
Because if not, you would only eat tuna

141
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,680
and peanut butter.

142
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
You didn't see anything, okay?

143
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,480
I'll take it to the grave.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,400
But take care of me if I need

145
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:00,500
it.

146
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,180
Yes, Jenny.

147
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:02,920
Goodbye.

148
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,030
Hello, beautiful.

149
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,190
Get in.

150
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:44,990
And all this?

151
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,490
Nothing special.

152
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,990
Megan invited you to some friends.

153
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:49,490
Yes.

154
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,810
I didn't remember that you were going to

155
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,250
visit her today.

156
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:54,550
You can stay.

157
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,430
You can let her stay.

158
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,490
Please, Dr. Ross.

159
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,330
This is not necessary.

160
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,190
You weren't there when her mother needed you,

161
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,530
and you won't be there when she needs

162
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:01,770
you.

163
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,170
But I am.

164
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,950
I know.

165
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,190
You want to hit me.

166
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,890
It's your only answer.

167
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:13,750
Violence.

168
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,180
You are a dangerous father.

169
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,640
You are a murderer.

170
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:22,780
No.

171
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,680
Don't pretend you're not.

172
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Excuse me, Dr. Ross.

173
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,220
It's my turn today.

174
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,400
Why did your grandfather decide to throw a

175
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:44,620
party?

176
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,540
I'm very hungry and I didn't eat.

177
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,860
I was waiting for you.

178
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,480
Really?

179
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,800
Yes.

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,240
Okay.

181
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Thank you.

182
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,520
Thank you.

183
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,350
Don't buy me things.

184
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,490
Come on.

185
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:10,610
Open it.

186
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:23,860
It's mom.

187
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,240
I took that picture.

188
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,760
With the camera my dad gave me.

189
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,620
Grandpa took all mom's pictures.

190
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,860
Sometimes I forget how she looked.

191
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,520
She looked like you.

192
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,220
Dad, can I tell you something?

193
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:47,820
Whatever.

194
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,020
I was mad at mom.

195
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,440
For dying and leaving us.

196
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:03,840
It's okay.

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,220
Me too.

198
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,060
Matthew is waiting for you.

199
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,840
He organizes parties on my days off.

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,360
He's making fun of me.

201
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,600
Is it on purpose?

202
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,600
Does he expect you to hit him?

203
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,000
No.

204
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,360
He would win.

205
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,940
The opposition council says you have post-traumatic

206
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,260
stress disorder.

207
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,000
And brain trauma from your military service.

208
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,380
Which makes you dangerous and violent.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,860
I served in Great Britain, the place where

210
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,160
I was born for 22 years.

211
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,220
Why is it bad?

212
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,700
It's not the worst.

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,040
Now he requests supervised visits and a reduction

214
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,540
in his duration of two hours a week.

215
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,300
To one hour every two.

216
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,840
I can't allow it.

217
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,280
I've already saved 10,000.

218
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,580
Sleeping in your truck?

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,780
It will be harmful.

220
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,540
You don't have a permanent residence.

221
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,780
Yes, I will solve it.

222
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,080
Why does Dr. Roth hate you so much?

223
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,460
He thinks I killed his daughter.

224
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,800
You did?

225
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,760
He committed suicide.

226
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,380
I was on a mission abroad.

227
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,080
She suffered from depression all her life.

228
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,320
Have you heard of the war of wear

229
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,420
and tear?

230
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,300
Yes, you slowly drown the enemy.

231
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,840
The subject has a team of extremely expensive

232
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:48,940
lawyers.

233
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,320
They will make you bleed until there is

234
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
nothing left of you and they will sweep

235
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,600
you away.

236
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,620
The best option is to negotiate in his

237
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:55,940
favor.

238
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,680
Do you have children?

239
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,560
I brought you a gift.

240
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,460
For Nina.

241
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,020
I brought Lynn.

242
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,000
How crazy!

243
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,660
Where did you get them?

244
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,640
With a princess.

245
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,570
Thank you.

246
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,130
Thank you.

247
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,800
What?

248
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,140
What are we still doing here?

249
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,640
She said she wanted that one.

250
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,780
I want that one.

251
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:50,660
I don't want any other.

252
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,820
What the hell does that mean?

253
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,160
She'll tell us when she sees it.

254
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,380
Do you have any idea how much we'll

255
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,240
make with this?

256
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,060
It's not worth it.

257
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,040
Relax.

258
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,280
Do you want it?

259
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,620
How much is the table free?

260
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,140
I'll give it to you if you tell

261
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,640
me your name.

262
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,040
I'm Jenny.

263
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,020
Hi, I'm Johnny.

264
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:32,960
Hi, Johnny.

265
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,220
She's over there.

266
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't be desperate.

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,640
Nina.

268
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,520
Nina, don't be pretty.

269
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,340
No, I'm fine.

270
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,300
Girls.

271
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,760
She's about to be pretty.

272
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,099
Yes.

273
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,599
We have to find a boyfriend.

274
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,839
Bad energy.

275
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,670
Oh my God.

276
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,089
I hate them.

277
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,930
They don't make me laugh.

278
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:23,569
It's something funny.

279
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,260
Oh, that's horrible.

280
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,660
It's going to destroy me.

281
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,280
I can't go out like this.

282
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,520
Well, get ready because we're leaving soon.

283
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,570
Shit!

284
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,590
It's complicated.

285
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,830
I understand.

286
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,170
Well, then I'll tell you to go to

287
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:20,790
Spain tomorrow.

288
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,700
Jenny disappeared.

289
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,670
What do you mean she disappeared?

290
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,210
She went out with her friends on Friday.

291
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,690
On Saturday we got worried and called the

292
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:46,990
police.

293
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,970
On Sunday she had a piano recital on

294
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:51,290
the radio.

295
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,390
We invited the family.

296
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,670
My cousin, Dinora, is the police captain at

297
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:58,970
Philly.

298
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,410
She said they don't investigate these cases.

299
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,890
They make the report and forget it.

300
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,170
Can you help us?

301
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,650
Yes, I can take care of the work.

302
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,370
No, find Jenny.

303
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,810
My dad was a green collar.

304
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,650
I knew you were too.

305
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,870
You hunt bad guys.

306
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,710
You jump from planes.

307
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,370
You have to help me.

308
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:23,890
Help us.

309
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,950
I'm different now.

310
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:31,970
Wait.

311
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,250
Maybe this will help.

312
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,120
There are 50,000.

313
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,860
Take them.

314
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,440
And 20 more for expenses.

315
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,340
Please take them.

316
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,180
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm not that person anymore.

318
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,140
Donny, it's me.

319
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,960
Don't kill me.

320
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,440
I brought carmine.

321
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,780
If you had a better aim, I would

322
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,180
be dead.

323
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,040
I would have killed you if I wanted

324
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,280
to.

325
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,440
Look, for me, there is no difference between

326
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,760
day and night.

327
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,820
I have to manage them.

328
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,780
It's hard to live in a gray world.

329
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,580
I couldn't save your eyes.

330
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,820
I'm sorry.

331
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,640
It weighs a lot on me.

332
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,460
No.

333
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,500
You saved my life.

334
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,760
I would have buried my plates in the

335
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,200
yard if you hadn't come that day.

336
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,590
What's her name?

337
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,150
Jenny.

338
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,770
Jenny, perfect.

339
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,070
Is she a good girl?

340
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:19,310
She's wonderful.

341
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,730
Hey, if you do this, better get ready.

342
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,710
You must give it your all.

343
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,610
No half-baked, but what can I say?

344
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,250
You always do.

345
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,790
She always counted on me.

346
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,350
Hey, Adam.

347
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,110
I miss you.

348
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,430
And I worry about you.

349
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,910
But you didn't have to come here to

350
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,090
pretend that you need my permission to do

351
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,730
something you already decided to do.

352
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,900
Hi, Carla.

353
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,200
Thank you for coming.

354
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,160
Where is she?

355
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,000
Upstairs, first door on the left.

356
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,570
Of course, Delona.

357
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,110
Yes, she's beautiful.

358
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,930
She rejected a music scholarship to go to

359
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,810
business school.

360
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,490
She wanted to be like her father and

361
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,670
be a great businesswoman.

362
00:22:58,910 --> 00:22:59,810
She will succeed.

363
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,410
Yes.

364
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,500
Thank you.

365
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,170
Give them hope.

366
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,470
I can't face them like this.

367
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,250
When my wife died and I left the

368
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:24,390
Royal Navy, many people made fun of me.

369
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,810
You were patient.

370
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,630
You, Carla, Jenny.

371
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:32,250
Jenny.

372
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,350
You're my family.

373
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,560
Look at me.

374
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,870
I'll bring her home.

375
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:04,550
I promise.

376
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,390
I'll bring her home.

377
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,760
This is the last time.

378
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,800
That's what I like.

379
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,480
Thank you.

380
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,220
Thank you.

381
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:01,760
Everything okay?

382
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,790
Everything okay?

383
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:06,390
Yes.

384
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,470
Thank you.

385
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,390
Thank you.

386
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,570
How are you?

387
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,970
Do you have a phone?

388
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:12,870
Yes.

389
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,070
No?

390
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,230
I think you have a phone.

391
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:15,430
Here you are.

392
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,010
Here you are.

393
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,710
Do you want one?

394
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:16,910
Yes.

395
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:18,370
Thank you.

396
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,110
See you later.

397
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:21,630
Don't worry.

398
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,310
There will be more tomorrow.

399
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,090
Don't worry.

1
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,080
Hey, you got the wrong house.

2
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,820
Get out of there.

3
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Hi, Johnny.

4
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,140
Do you want to play?

5
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,200
Let's see who wins.

6
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,520
Put your hands up.

7
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,360
Quickly.

8
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,520
Put your hands behind your head.

9
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,880
Are you a cop?

10
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,840
You'd better be.

11
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
As you wish.

12
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,830
Where is she?

13
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:10,690
Who are you talking about?

14
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,970
The missing girl.

15
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,170
The one that one of your friends kidnapped

16
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:17,970
from this bar.

17
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,310
I talked to the police.

18
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,210
She got drunk or something.

19
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:23,370
The bitch couldn't control the alcohol.

20
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,410
It's not my problem.

21
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,430
People lie.

22
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,010
Do you lie, Johnny?

23
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,950
I don't trust anyone.

24
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,770
I trust biology.

25
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,470
We're all the same.

26
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,130
Get up.

27
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:57,330
Fuck!

28
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:57,670
Fucking bastard!

29
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,770
Your mind knows you're in a tub.

30
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,810
With a wet towel.

31
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,450
But the adrenaline speeds up your heart.

32
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,710
So you spend more air.

33
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,510
Your nervous system tells you you're choking.

34
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,350
Your bosses know you sell drugs at the

35
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:14,570
bar.

36
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,730
That you steal from the cash register.

37
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:16,690
Go to hell!

38
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,530
These guys are very dangerous.

39
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,010
They can kill entire families.

40
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,110
I don't care.

41
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,470
I want you to tell me their names.

42
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,270
It's your choice.

43
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,230
Johnny!

44
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,410
Where are you, brother?

45
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,950
Are you waiting for company?

46
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,450
Yes, of course!

47
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:02,090
Open the door or I'll kill you.

48
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,870
Russians.

49
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:24,450
Fuck.

50
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:59,510
Forgive me for hiding behind

51
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,010
a hill of achievements.

52
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,610
I wish you had seen me.

53
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,970
How I really am.

54
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,630
I wanted to be strong like you.

55
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,799
What am I doing here?

56
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,640
It's better that you see it.

57
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,680
What the fuck did they do now?

58
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,800
Why did they shoot each other?

59
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,160
How unprofessional.

60
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,260
Johnny is a weak man, uncontrollable.

61
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,480
Maybe he said nonsense and it was time

62
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,040
for the bullets.

63
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,040
Time for the bullets?

64
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:14,880
Yes.

65
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,980
Bang, bang, my friend.

66
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,040
Do you notice anything different?

67
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,640
His head.

68
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,180
Idiot.

69
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,540
What about my fucking money?

70
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,460
He thinks it was a robbery.

71
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,480
Impossible.

72
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,240
Nobody would rob us.

73
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,180
Nobody is so stupid.

74
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,500
Or so crazy.

75
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,980
They used a shotgun.

76
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Do you see a shotgun?

77
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,020
Nine bundles are missing.

78
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,800
Nine thousand dollars of our fucking money.

79
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,800
This is Simon.

80
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,580
Princess.

81
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,340
Hi daddy, what are you doing?

82
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,120
Nothing, just working.

83
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,180
Are you at school?

84
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,220
Yes.

85
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,920
Can you call me from school?

86
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,320
No.

87
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,140
Is everything okay?

88
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:45,960
Yes.

89
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:49,480
I love you too.

90
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,440
Bye.

91
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,730
The door opens by itself?

92
00:35:14,540 --> 00:36:03,370
I don't like this.

93
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:05,730
You sleep alone every night.

94
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:07,309
Eat.

95
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,890
And then come to bed for a while.

96
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,370
Do you think money falls from the sky?

97
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,460
Excuse me.

98
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:22,870
I was hungry.

99
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,590
I wanted to talk to you.

100
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,730
I'm going to take the tape off.

101
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,110
But if you don't control the volume.

102
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,720
You're going to take a bath.

103
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,440
You don't know who I am.

104
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,060
Should I?

105
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,560
Clearly you have no idea who you're messing

106
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:51,660
with.

107
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,800
I'll give you the pleasure.

108
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,500
Tell me.

109
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,820
Boris Zaconia.

110
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,660
Have you heard of us?

111
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,120
Well, yes.

112
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,220
Seriously.

113
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:02,860
The Four.

114
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,660
The Bratwa.

115
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,420
The Brothers.

116
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,260
The League of Thieves.

117
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,640
Whatever the Russian mafia calls itself these days.

118
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,020
I see you know what you're doing.

119
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,700
You murder soldiers, Four.

120
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,580
You steal money, Four.

121
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,240
It was a misunderstanding.

122
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,680
I'm a high-ranking brother.

123
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,580
You and those around you will suffer for

124
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,480
three generations.

125
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,220
Yes.

126
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,720
I guess.

127
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,760
We know what these things are like.

128
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,960
If you don't finish them...

129
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,280
Eat!

130
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,290
For slapping that woman a while ago.

131
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,750
That woman was my wife.

132
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,830
For slapping your wife.

133
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,220
Your money.

134
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,760
I'm not a thief.

135
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,240
I don't care about your business.

136
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,400
I'm looking for a young woman.

137
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:09,710
In Panama.

138
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,930
I don't understand.

139
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,490
In the bar where you do these dirty

140
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:14,590
deals.

141
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,150
They kidnapped a 19-year-old girl.

142
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:20,730
I'm looking for her.

143
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:36,430
You should lower your voice.

144
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,430
What do you want?

145
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,750
Give me the girl and we can go

146
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,490
on with our lives.

147
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:44,930
A girl.

148
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,610
Everything for a girl.

149
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:48,090
Seriously.

150
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,610
Nobody sends three people to sell a girl.

151
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:54,550
Nobody.

152
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:01,190
I won't sell her.

153
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:03,750
I'll take her home.

154
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,670
I won't stop until I do.

155
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:11,290
Who are you?

156
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,970
What are you?

157
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,070
Who are you?

158
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,570
Fuck you.

159
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,690
Fuck you.

160
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,110
Fuck you!

161
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:22,910
Enough.

162
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,520
Sir.

163
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:00,280
Tell me.

164
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,250
Who are you to me?

165
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:43,760
He took the money.

166
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,000
He returned the money.

167
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,880
He killed without hesitation.

168
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,500
The question is why.

169
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:50,620
Why?

170
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:58,970
Wolo was a respectable man with honor.

171
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,770
But his son is not like us.

172
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,750
Dimi is not a businessman.

173
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:14,270
He prefers to have fun than work hard.

174
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,610
He tramples on his father's name every fucking

175
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,190
day.

176
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:31,120
Find him and bring him to me.

177
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,420
My name is Jenny Garcia.

178
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,420
My father is Joe.

179
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,020
My mother is Carla.

180
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,560
They made a mistake.

181
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,880
It's a mistake.

182
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,790
That's not true.

183
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,740
You no longer exist.

184
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,840
This is the only reality.

185
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,460
Eat at once.

186
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,180
Put on your fucking clothes and shut your

187
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,460
mouth.

188
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,120
Enjoy yourself.

189
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,060
Have you ever seen someone die?

190
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,740
Their eyes cloud immediately.

191
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,900
How beautiful you are.

192
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,740
Right, princess?

193
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:36,920
Princess?

194
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:38,840
No.

195
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,510
Eat at once, bitch.

196
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:28,280
How are you?

197
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,580
Do you have money?

198
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:30,660
I wish.

199
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,780
I only have cement.

200
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,600
I don't do that anymore.

201
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:36,460
I save, I pay taxes.

202
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,999
Have you talked to Goni?

203
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:39,680
How is he?

204
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:41,320
I saw him the other day.

205
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,160
He is not happy.

206
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,999
You never call me unless you need something.

207
00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:46,259
So, what do you want?

208
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:48,340
I'm looking for someone named Dimmie.

209
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:53,320
Maybe Dimitri, an associate of Vladimir Kalishnik.

210
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,840
He is someone very important.

211
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,259
He is from Alto Rago.

212
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,759
Commander of the Bratva.

213
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,000
You shouldn't mess with him.

214
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,200
No, I know.

215
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,960
But Uncle Dimmie may be trafficking people.

216
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,740
You can check the narcotics and the database

217
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,280
to see if there are any.

218
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,340
But there is a bar called Gali's in

219
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,000
Cholet, where they sell Russian beer.

220
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,460
Go for a beer.

221
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,960
Thank you.

222
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:52,030
Hi, what

223
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:52,410
can I offer you?

224
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,010
A beer, any beer.

225
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:56,350
Right away.

226
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:19,790
Hello, stranger.

227
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:20,630
Where were you?

228
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,810
Earning money.

229
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:28,510
Hey, they say you and your brother's asshole

230
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,610
talked to the Russians.

231
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,170
And they say you were so high that

232
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,910
you killed Big Mike in a brothel and

233
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:34,850
blamed some thieves.

234
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,090
Shut up.

235
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,450
If Dodge finds out that someone besides him

236
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:40,790
talks to the Russians, he will go crazy.

237
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:42,790
Do you know him?

238
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,540
No, I've never seen him.

239
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,880
I don't like him.

240
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,100
He looks like a cop.

241
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,570
He has a gun in his pocket.

242
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:00,510
Do you see the 38?

243
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,950
Yes, I see it.

244
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:03,510
Then go get him.

245
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,680
Follow me.

246
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:01,970
Talk to him.

247
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,880
Were you looking for something?

248
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,700
I'm only interested in pharmaceuticals, brother.

249
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,360
Then why are you armed?

250
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,920
I have money.

251
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,440
I would hate to be robbed.

252
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,420
He's a cop.

253
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,310
Are you a cop?

254
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:34,750
No.

255
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:36,070
And you?

256
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,410
Empty your pockets.

257
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,570
See if you have a badge.

258
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,210
You heard him.

259
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:47,150
Put everything on the table.

260
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:52,610
I didn't come to disrespect you.

261
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,820
Very well.

262
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:15,880
Let's play.

263
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,060
Come on.

264
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,120
Hit him, brother.

265
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,320
Goodbye, asshole.

266
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,940
Enough!

267
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,120
My grandfather told me never to shake hands.

268
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,010
Look at those muscles.

269
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:41,670
You're not a cop.

270
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:43,530
You're a worker.

271
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,290
I've been in construction all my life.

272
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:47,610
Were you a soldier?

273
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,790
Why do you fight like a soldier?

274
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,570
It wasn't for a while.

275
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,230
I was an aviator.

276
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,430
They trained us to jump from planes and

277
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:56,310
we ended up fighting.

278
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,590
It makes sense.

279
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,690
Sit down.

280
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,060
What do you want to buy?

281
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:08,120
I'm looking for a blue crystal.

282
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,400
The good one.

283
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,040
I need it.

284
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,280
Two kilos a month.

285
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,180
Is that all?

286
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,340
What will you do with it?

287
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,700
I'll distribute it.

288
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,180
My clients are my problem, not yours.

289
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:23,960
Why here?

290
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,800
With us?

291
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,980
My contact in Chicago disappeared.

292
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,840
He received orders to buy 24-7.

293
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,660
Time is money.

294
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,840
7,000 for a quarter kilo.

295
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,860
That's the price of Chicago.

296
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:41,280
Five.

297
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,010
There's a cafeteria at the intersection of the

298
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,050
road north of here.

299
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,250
Get there at seven o'clock and eat

300
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:52,550
something.

301
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:53,690
And?

302
00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:56,270
Take the 5,000.

303
00:51:57,910 --> 00:51:58,890
Nice to meet you.

304
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:01,210
Now disappear.

305
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,610
Sit down.

306
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,460
It's like an uncomfortable appointment on Tinder.

307
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,600
Is the money worth it?

308
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,090
Look at that.

309
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,410
People talk.

310
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,810
Money rules.

311
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,560
And what about me?

312
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,360
We don't know who the hell you are.

313
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,180
We'll call you to let you know.

314
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:29,490
That's all.

315
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,050
Don't play with me.

316
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,090
Do you know where to find them?

317
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,710
Yes, I guess so.

318
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:53,670
Thank you for not shooting him.

319
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,500
Asshole.

320
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,170
Yes?

321
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,170
Are you ready?

322
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:11,910
I'll tell you where we have him hidden.

323
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,050
I'm listening.

324
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:14,890
On your seat.

325
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,060
Thank you.

326
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,260
Stay with the phone.

327
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:30,920
I'll call you tomorrow and you'll tell me

328
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,840
how to build Rome in one day with

329
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,480
my product.

330
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,220
And we'll talk about volume.

331
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,200
The princess of the night has arrived.

332
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,560
Dimi said they do miracles.

333
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,260
And that's because of Dimi's miracle.

334
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,860
Why her?

335
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:32,880
It reminded me of a painting that was

336
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,720
at my father's house.

337
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,660
Take her back.

338
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:38,820
Are you sure?

339
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:21,530
Look how beautiful they are.

340
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,450
They look like sharks.

341
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,310
They're just like you, beauty.

342
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,850
She bit me!

343
00:56:35,010 --> 00:56:36,950
She was supposed to be asleep!

344
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:39,090
I'm very sorry, sir.

1
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:09,930
Yes?

2
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,910
Did you like the product?

3
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:13,670
Newly completed.

4
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:16,970
There is much more where that came from.

5
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,610
But you must talk to someone else if

6
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,350
we do business.

7
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:21,670
What does it mean?

8
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:23,830
It's just a precaution.

9
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,870
Because now they impose perpetual chains for half

10
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,270
kilos.

11
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,670
Yes, the business is not for everyone.

12
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,250
I understand you, Carbon.

13
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,070
That's why I'll invite you to this meeting.

14
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:37,550
Bring money and put on a suit.

15
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:38,730
I don't have a suit.

16
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:40,810
Shit, get one.

17
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:43,250
Because these people are very important.

18
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,900
How are you?

19
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:20,400
Hello, Don.

20
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,770
Did you bring the money?

21
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:31,090
Can I?

22
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,700
First, turn off your phone.

23
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:48,420
Now what?

24
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:50,500
You already have my money.

25
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,660
I just came to do business.

26
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,460
My name is Timmy.

27
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:06,310
And yours?

28
00:59:07,629 --> 00:59:08,230
Bill.

29
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:10,210
Bill Coates.

30
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:12,630
Did you bring your license?

31
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:13,810
Bill Coates.

32
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:27,700
Sorry.

33
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,920
It's okay.

34
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:30,480
Check it.

35
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,940
Did you rent your car?

36
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,080
We already checked it.

37
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,880
For taxes.

38
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:43,940
All right.

39
00:59:48,610 --> 00:59:50,590
This man is my partner.

40
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,610
He is usually my dog.

41
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,350
I give the orders here.

42
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,670
Tell me.

43
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,350
Will you cause problems?

44
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,910
Is that how you do business?

45
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,390
Do you invite me to threaten me?

46
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:24,110
I'm sorry about that.

47
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:25,950
William.

48
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,940
I already saw that you are ...

49
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:36,360
A serious man.

50
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:45,410
A serious man.

51
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:52,620
If you need more drugs, use the phone

52
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,900
and send the rabbit emoji.

53
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,800
I sent you the rabbit emoji.

54
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:00,860
You know I need two kilos a month.

55
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:02,300
Oh.

56
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:05,800
Then send the eggplant emoji.

57
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,200
We already know.

58
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,300
We already know.

59
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,940
If you like what's inside, we'll continue with

60
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:18,200
this.

61
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,880
Now go and don't look back.

62
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:23,560
Good for me.

63
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,830
Johnny, you're an idiot.

64
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:26,640
What?

65
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,900
That fucking snake is back.

66
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:59,970
Hi, asshole.

67
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:12,330
He's here.

68
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:18,750
They are in a black Dodge Ram.

69
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:19,950
Hide in the trees.

70
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,370
Okay, we'll get out.

71
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:24,810
Let's go.

72
01:03:32,410 --> 01:03:32,990
Let's go.

73
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:42,150
Fuck, he got on a motorcycle.

74
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:42,930
Follow him.

75
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,090
Let's go.

76
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:45,910
Go, go, go.

77
01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:49,090
Shit.

78
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:52,490
Go, go, go.

79
01:04:12,410 --> 01:04:13,050
Go, go, go.

80
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,720
Show me your hands.

81
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:23,900
Hey, you've never seen us before.

82
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,000
Nothing has happened here.

83
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,000
We'll take care of it.

84
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,040
They are also in the lava.

85
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,059
Let's go.

86
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:33,840
Yes.

87
01:05:42,699 --> 01:05:51,740
How do you know Timmy?

88
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,360
What business do you have with Timmy?

89
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,360
Are you again?

90
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,100
The man you drowned in his pool while

91
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:02,240
his wife was in Pilates?

92
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,920
He was our uncle.

93
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:06,320
He didn't shut up.

94
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,280
I warned him.

95
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:09,720
Do you know who we are?

96
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:10,460
Yes.

97
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,100
They are children of evil mothers.

98
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,820
This suit is branded, asshole.

99
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:16,860
What the fuck do you know?

100
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,420
Tie him up.

101
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,420
If you want to scare me, you'll have

102
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:27,920
to make an effort.

103
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:39,990
I hate you.

104
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:55,050
I hate you.

105
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:04,850
What the fuck?

106
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:09,550
Fuck you.

107
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:11,950
Shit.

108
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,210
Fuck.

109
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:24,150
Fuck.

110
01:08:43,770 --> 01:08:44,710
He is Banco.

111
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,580
And he is Dania.

112
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,750
They are my children.

113
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:02,810
My home and my lineage ends in these

114
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,530
cold metal plates.

115
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,380
Join the war council.

116
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:32,910
I'm sorry, baby.

117
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,450
Get out.

118
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,320
Get your fucking hands away.

119
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:52,660
Fuck.

120
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,880
You are lucky to still be alive.

121
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:04,500
Tell me.

122
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:05,520
I'm sorry.

123
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,040
I'm really sorry.

124
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,220
He ripped off half of my face.

125
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,240
Although it was not half of the face.

126
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,540
36 stitches.

127
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:16,320
It's too much.

128
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,560
To join his cheek.

129
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,820
I'm in the pleasure business, not surgery.

130
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,360
Tell me.

131
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,160
Do you know what a business involves?

132
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:36,240
No, I don't.

133
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,180
I mean, yes.

134
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,820
A business involves Fulfilling your word.

135
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,420
Fulfilling your promises.

136
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,740
Making the client happy.

137
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:45,360
No.

138
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,120
Forcing the fucking face.

139
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:52,580
Did you know you just cost me 200

140
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:53,420
,000 grand?

141
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,160
If you win one, I win two.

142
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,980
The client wants her dead.

143
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,060
I want her dead.

144
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:06,100
Kill her.

145
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,060
You know where to take her.

146
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:07,380
Of course.

147
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:09,060
Now get the fuck out.

148
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:09,900
I will, sir.

149
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:13,020
It was annoying.

150
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:13,780
More than annoying.

151
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,100
It was about to kill us.

152
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,280
But then a demon appeared.

153
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,980
A demon that killed two soldiers.

154
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,360
That drowned Vladimir.

155
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,380
An esteemed captain.

156
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:36,180
That killed my two children.

157
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,180
Now they understand my concern.

158
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,020
Where is Dimi?

159
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,900
Does he know who the demon is?

160
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:46,880
Dimi is hidden.

161
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,700
You will help him find Dimi.

162
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:01,200
Thank you for telling me about this situation.

163
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,500
You can go.

164
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:08,170
Do you want champagne?

165
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:25,740
Your father is dead.

166
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,460
Killed in a chair.

167
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,400
Drowned in his pool.

168
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,040
What good news.

169
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,560
The man who killed him killed my children.

170
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,800
Dania Ivanko.

171
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,700
What the fuck?

172
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:47,920
You didn't know?

173
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,180
How the fuck would I know?

174
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,480
Nobody tells me anything.

175
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,260
The Brotherhood treats me like I'm radioactive.

176
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,440
Who is this man?

177
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,570
I ask you politely.

178
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,479
I know motorcyclists with META connections.

179
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,600
They introduced me to a buyer with reliable

180
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:21,700
money.

181
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:23,280
We meet for five minutes.

182
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:24,420
That's all.

183
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,580
Wait.

184
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:30,400
I have this.

185
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,960
He's hunting you.

186
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,880
I found him.

187
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,380
Hello.

188
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:43,880
Hello.

189
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:59,060
Are you okay?

190
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,160
Yes.

191
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:00,840
Let's go.

192
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,540
Grandpa never comes home late.

193
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,160
He doesn't answer me.

194
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,200
I sent him like 20 messages.

195
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,440
I'm sure he's okay.

196
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:15,080
You didn't kill him, did you?

197
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,800
It's a joke.

198
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:23,960
Do you trust me?

199
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,260
Yes.

200
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,840
If I tell you something, you know you

201
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:28,800
can believe me, right?

202
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:31,080
Hey, you're making me nervous.

203
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,800
I made a big mistake.

204
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,840
Oh my God, you killed Grandpa.

205
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:36,800
Mary, I'm serious.

206
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:38,500
Dangerous people are following me.

207
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,140
I don't want anyone we love to get

208
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:40,380
hurt.

209
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,420
Did you share your location with Grandpa?

210
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:44,320
Yes.

211
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:46,620
Can you see his location?

212
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,560
Maybe I don't know.

213
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:53,070
He's at home.

214
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,120
Mary, stay here, okay?

215
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,000
Mary, listen to me!

216
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,460
Grandpa, be careful!

217
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,840
Grandpa!

218
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:05,500
Who were they?

219
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,180
The Russian mafia?

220
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,180
Yes.

221
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:13,440
They were looking for you.

222
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,720
All this was your fault.

223
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,020
The violence follows you like a shadow.

224
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,460
He could leave you there, Grandpa.

225
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,240
He saved your life.

226
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,180
I'm aware of that.

227
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:35,480
Go to the hospital.

228
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,480
You'll be safe there.

229
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,820
I'll take care of Mary.

230
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:41,920
I think it's time for the police to

231
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:42,500
take care of it.

232
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,900
They won't stop us.

233
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,060
Well, we'll figure it out.

234
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:51,980
And, Levon.

235
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:54,280
Thank you.

236
01:18:56,860 --> 01:19:10,540
Do you

237
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:11,160
remember Agony?

238
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,260
The blind man who doesn't know he's blind?

239
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:14,380
That's him.

240
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:16,300
He has a house in the field.

241
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:18,620
We'll be safe until this is over.

242
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:32,600
Hi!

243
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,560
Come in.

244
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:36,720
Are you hungry?

245
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:37,520
Yes.

246
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,740
And you?

247
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:39,520
Yes.

248
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:41,480
What happened, friend?

249
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:43,700
Did you mess with the wrong people?

250
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:45,140
You could stop me.

251
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,480
There's a force on Earth that can stop

252
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:47,860
you.

253
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:50,740
I don't like this.

254
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,000
Will you find the real girl?

255
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:54,900
Will you find her?

256
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:58,600
I'll take her to his house.

257
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:00,860
Do you have a plan?

258
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:05,740
I'll ask the blind man where he is.

259
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:09,100
He's got the whole way.

260
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:11,800
You opened your path by killing.

261
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:13,400
You'll have to go out killing.

262
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,420
I thought so.

263
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:18,080
I can help you.

264
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,180
Really?

265
01:20:20,230 --> 01:20:21,040
I'll show you.

266
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:28,220
Come in.

267
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:28,680
Come in, sir.

268
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,540
I'm going to be your gun sommelier tonight.

269
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:36,680
If you come close to this wall, you'll

270
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,420
see that Abdomat Kalashnikov has been killing Americans

271
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:40,180
since 1947.

272
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,860
Also in a luxury version.

273
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:43,400
Bright.

274
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,000
Directly from the palace of Saddam.

275
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,420
This is the M4 Carbine.

276
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:51,380
It's the Chevy Impala from the War of

277
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:51,760
Terror.

278
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,040
Or a beautiful MP5 SD if you're looking

279
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,700
to kill someone without waking him up.

280
01:20:57,180 --> 01:20:59,580
But this is the real beast.

281
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,200
The original weapon of the four horsemen of

282
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:02,760
the apocalypse.

283
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,540
The M14.

284
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,780
Maybe you remember it.

285
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:11,780
I don't want to, but I'll do it.

286
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,140
Hold it.

287
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:24,740
I'll have to erase the serial number.

288
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,320
No, I already did that.

289
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,880
They were never here.

290
01:21:28,900 --> 01:21:30,260
Nor anywhere.

291
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,520
Like us.

292
01:21:33,420 --> 01:21:34,680
Back then.

293
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,340
But we were the good guys.

294
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,500
That's right.

295
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,240
What's in there?

296
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,400
It doesn't matter.

297
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:52,040
Can I go?

298
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,920
Of course not.

299
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,500
And the school?

300
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:57,740
You'll be gone for a few days.

301
01:21:58,420 --> 01:21:59,020
Get some rest.

302
01:22:05,780 --> 01:22:07,000
I hardly see you.

303
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:08,880
I don't want you to be in trouble.

304
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:10,600
Or I'll never see you again.

305
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:11,660
It won't happen.

306
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:13,980
It's this.

307
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:15,960
It's you.

308
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:17,960
Half and half.

309
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,380
I want you to keep it.

310
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,280
I'll come back for it.

311
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:26,700
Okay.

312
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,200
I love you.

313
01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:32,960
I love you, Daddy.

314
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:38,490
Daddy, don't get hurt.

315
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:40,730
I'll be back soon.

316
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:41,450
Okay?

317
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:44,130
Connie, take good care of her.

318
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,030
Yes, of course.

319
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:46,270
Thank you, Joyce.

320
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:47,270
Goodbye.

321
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:47,990
Come with us.

322
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:16,210
You are

323
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:16,890
in heaven.

324
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:19,270
Blessed be your name.

325
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,210
Come to us.

326
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,010
Your kingdom.

327
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,730
Precious, God is not here.

328
01:23:26,610 --> 01:23:28,050
The princess should be sleeping.

329
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:30,430
We have to find a way to give

330
01:23:30,430 --> 01:23:31,770
this bitch pills to sleep.

331
01:23:53,010 --> 01:23:53,350
Shit!

332
01:23:58,050 --> 01:23:58,150
No!

333
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:48,900
Hey!

334
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:50,220
What the fuck?

335
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,500
It's really too fast.

336
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,240
We'll go back to the fucking prison!

337
01:24:56,260 --> 01:24:56,480
Huh?

338
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:58,100
Do you understand?

339
01:24:58,520 --> 01:24:59,620
I understand.

340
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:02,560
Motherfucker!

341
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:03,440
What did I say?

342
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:03,960
Shit!

343
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:05,460
Motherfucker!

344
01:25:24,270 --> 01:25:25,110
Okay, genius.

345
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,250
Now what?

346
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,040
What's going on?

347
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:47,140
Hey!

348
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:49,340
Are you okay?

349
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,520
My name is Jenny Garcia.

350
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:54,580
I was kidnapped.

351
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:55,380
Don't worry.

352
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:56,580
I know who you are.

353
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,920
We'll take you home.

1
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:28,080
I'm sorry, really.

2
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:34,680
Did you miss me?

3
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:37,060
Shit!

4
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,820
Get that bitch out of here!

5
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:47,850
Tell me it's a joke.

6
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:48,170
Is it him?

7
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:49,490
Fuck off!

8
01:26:51,590 --> 01:26:52,710
Shit, it's a video call.

9
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:54,590
Take the fucking phone, give it to me!

10
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:55,090
What the fuck?

11
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,130
Fucking, damn weapon!

12
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:58,270
Hello, sir.

13
01:26:58,970 --> 01:27:00,470
Tell me you still have the girl.

14
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,790
Ah, yes, yes, we still have her.

15
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,070
Show me she's still alive.

16
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:12,120
You see?

17
01:27:12,380 --> 01:27:13,180
She's still alive.

18
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,980
I want a second night at the farm

19
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:18,240
tonight.

20
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:19,740
A million dollars.

21
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,420
Ah, yes, whatever you want, sir.

22
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,280
I'll make her and leave her smelling good

23
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:24,660
for you.

24
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:26,880
I want her dirty.

26
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,380
Without sleep.

27
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:31,840
Dirty and alive.

28
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:33,760
For now.

29
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:34,620
For now?

30
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:36,900
Yes.

31
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,020
Tell me which passport.

32
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,780
You sent me a lot of passports.

33
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:43,940
I don't know which ones.

34
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:45,180
Red, blue, green.

35
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:45,940
Sir.

36
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:47,740
Where are we going?

37
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,540
I'll take them all, okay?

38
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,080
What do you want?

39
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:55,800
Do you want money?

40
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,440
No!

41
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:57,220
Do you want money?

42
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,880
I don't want your fucking money!

43
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,140
I don't want your fucking money!

44
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,420
Take everything you want, okay?

45
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:01,960
Can we help you?

46
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,880
No, no, I don't need help.

47
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,080
Get away!

48
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:08,220
Get away!

49
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:08,580
Stop!

50
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:12,660
Okay, finish this with what I start here.

51
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:17,820
What?

52
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:37,010
You're just a contact.

53
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:40,490
Stop!

54
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,340
Very good, my friend.

55
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:17,280
You're dressed.

56
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,640
Let's make a deal and you can start

57
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,120
a life as a rich man.

58
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,880
I don't need your money.

59
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:24,740
Congratulations.

60
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:27,260
Come closer and she dies.

61
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:27,920
No!

62
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:28,960
That's what I thought.

63
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:33,680
Disappear.

64
01:29:34,380 --> 01:29:35,200
Take the money.

65
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:37,560
I owe you my life.

66
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,500
Where is she?

67
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,720
I don't know that girl.

68
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,980
You're lying very badly.

69
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,600
Why do you risk so much?

70
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:08,220
Why do you murder for her?

71
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,160
Because they expect her to return.

72
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:20,360
If I give you this girl, will

73
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:20,980
you let me live?

74
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:23,920
Because if I only give you the address,

75
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:26,640
will you shoot me?

76
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:29,380
And if you give me a false address

77
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,840
and I shoot you?

78
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,240
It would be bad for both of us.

79
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:41,780
Go south at 57.

80
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,120
There I will give you the address.

81
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:47,020
Let's go.

82
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:49,560
Do you know him?

83
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:51,920
Of course I know him.

84
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,020
He is Piper.

85
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,460
He is the human resources manager who recruits

86
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,000
for special projects.

87
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,920
Why do you do all this for a

88
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,180
whore?

89
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,440
Say it again.

90
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,920
I challenge you, repeat it.

91
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:13,220
That's what I thought.

92
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:15,280
Well, tell me.

93
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:16,780
Tell me where we are going.

94
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,400
Where is she?

95
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:22,610
There.

96
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,070
Is she there?

97
01:31:47,790 --> 01:31:48,510
She is there.

98
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,170
Do you promise?

99
01:31:51,550 --> 01:31:52,910
I promise.

100
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:54,630
She is there.

101
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:12,180
Why her?

102
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:15,580
Who decides?

103
01:32:20,420 --> 01:32:22,040
Piper Bar Club.

104
01:32:22,520 --> 01:32:24,560
She takes pictures of pretty girls.

105
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,760
She sends them to the clients and they

106
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:27,140
choose.

107
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:30,040
The appointment is scheduled.

108
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:34,180
That is my exclusive service.

109
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:36,780
Like buying a toy for a child.

110
01:32:41,190 --> 01:32:42,630
They are human beings.

111
01:32:42,630 --> 01:32:42,910
Let's go.

112
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:49,790
Do you really think it matters where the

113
01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:50,030
money comes from?

114
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:53,950
If I didn't do it, someone else would.

115
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:57,250
You haven't told me why.

116
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:00,210
Why are you chasing us?

117
01:33:01,010 --> 01:33:01,950
Do you have children?

118
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:04,290
No.

119
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:06,310
Then you wouldn't understand.

120
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:27,560
Let's go.

121
01:34:48,340 --> 01:34:49,460
Be careful.

122
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:53,040
Everything is fine.

123
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:55,480
It couldn't be worse.

124
01:34:56,140 --> 01:34:57,780
The son of a bitch we contacted with

125
01:34:57,780 --> 01:35:00,200
Timmy killed half a dozen Russians today.

126
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,760
They say he's on his way to Timmy's

127
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:03,240
house right now.

128
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:07,460
Listen!

129
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:08,540
Get ready!

130
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,020
Listen!

131
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:10,780
Get ready!

132
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:14,780
He's coming!

133
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:17,080
Let's go!

134
01:36:08,350 --> 01:36:09,890
How funny.

135
01:36:15,630 --> 01:36:16,070
Let's go.

136
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:24,610
What a princess.

137
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:45,370
I don't approve of this behavior.

138
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:47,970
But my bank account is like this.

139
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:51,530
Hey!

140
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,950
It's time.

141
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:53,750
What are you doing here?

142
01:36:53,950 --> 01:36:54,190
Let's go.

143
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:55,350
Yes, for the pervert.

144
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:58,650
We're all numbers.

145
01:36:58,970 --> 01:36:59,650
It's nothing personal.

146
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:01,810
It seems very personal to me.

147
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:19,650
You must go now, sir.

148
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,090
Why?

149
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:22,650
It's now or never.

150
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:24,750
Then now.

151
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,720
What did I do to you?

152
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:02,080
Nothing.

153
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:04,300
That's the best part.

154
01:38:10,780 --> 01:38:13,840
I wonder how you'll look...

155
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,960
...from the inside.

156
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:23,410
He's inside!

157
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:29,220
Listen to me!

158
01:39:30,220 --> 01:39:31,380
Load your weapons!

159
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:33,000
Let's go get that son of a bitch!

160
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:33,540
Yes.

161
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:34,980
You two, come with me.

162
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:35,860
You heard him.

163
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:36,760
Focus!

164
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,720
Hey!

165
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,340
Open the window!

166
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:41,200
Understood.

167
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:19,690
Everything will be fine.

168
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:20,930
Yes.

169
01:40:22,510 --> 01:40:24,210
You just have to...

170
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:24,430
Yes.

171
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:27,030
I'm starting to think you have no idea

172
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,990
what you're doing!

173
01:40:28,130 --> 01:40:29,090
Don't worry, sir.

174
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:30,450
Everything is under control.

175
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:31,350
I promise.

176
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:34,250
No!

177
01:40:40,510 --> 01:40:42,270
I'll rip your heart out.

178
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:43,230
Good luck.

179
01:41:14,580 --> 01:41:16,160
What's your real name?

180
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,320
Lebon.

181
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:19,300
Nice to meet you, Lebon.

182
01:41:20,120 --> 01:41:21,100
Are you ready?

183
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:22,580
I always am.

184
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:31,460
My fight wasn't with you.

185
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:32,260
I know.

186
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,820
Finish it!

187
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:41,560
Let's go.

188
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:57,780
Forgive me.

189
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:27,500
How dare you come in here?

190
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,800
Oh, fuck!

191
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:32,220
That's not good!

192
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,000
What the fuck?

193
01:42:38,740 --> 01:42:39,220
Let's go!

194
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,320
No, no, no!

195
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,480
No, no, no, no, no!

196
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,720
No, no, no, no, no!

197
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:46,120
What the fuck?

198
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:58,000
What the fuck?

199
01:43:11,319 --> 01:43:13,359
Let me go!

200
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,000
It's over.

201
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:58,420
I think

202
01:43:58,420 --> 01:43:58,980
I killed her.

203
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:01,440
Good.

204
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,140
Stay with me.

205
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,480
What do you mean?

206
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:17,020
Follow me.

207
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:29,690
We have

208
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:30,530
a shooter inside.

209
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:53,980
Shit!

210
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:02,460
I'll take care of him.

211
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,500
What was that?

212
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:21,460
Bluetooth.

213
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:26,050
A grenade?

214
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:27,290
Cover your ears.

215
01:45:40,990 --> 01:45:41,510
Ready?

216
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:42,590
No.

217
01:45:43,630 --> 01:45:44,110
We have to go.

218
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:58,680
I'll see you on the other side.

219
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,620
What was that?

220
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:05,380
Respect for an old friend.

221
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:33,760
Ready to go home?

222
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:35,180
Get me out of here.

223
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:42,780
No!

224
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,160
Yes, brother.

225
01:46:59,120 --> 01:46:59,900
He managed to escape.

226
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,940
With the girl.

227
01:47:02,580 --> 01:47:04,040
It's not our problem.

228
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,920
The devil found what he came for.

229
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:09,860
Let him go.

230
01:47:11,220 --> 01:47:13,800
I'm very aware that we always have to

231
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,040
be discreet about this.

232
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:18,400
But I'm not willing to bow my head...

233
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,620
...before the man who killed my two children.

234
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,760
Then we'll kill you.

235
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,260
Brotherhood is more important than personal revenge.

236
01:47:29,290 --> 01:47:30,220
Do you understand?

237
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,080
I understand.

238
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:49,960
Hey.

239
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:53,380
We'll take him to the grave.

240
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:09,690
No!

241
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:50,400
I was thinking of taking him to the

242
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:50,940
chicken coop.

243
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,480
Would you like that?

244
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:53,300
Yes.

245
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:55,440
You'd better be careful with the old rooster.

246
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:56,800
It's bad.

247
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:57,700
Very bad.

248
01:48:58,340 --> 01:48:59,240
Yes, it's true.

249
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:03,720
Dad, it's you.

250
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:04,420
You're back.

251
01:49:07,220 --> 01:49:08,320
I promised you.

252
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,140
Are you okay, daddy?

253
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,580
Yes, I cut myself while shaving.

254
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:22,380
Welcome.

255
01:49:25,290 --> 01:49:26,350
Hi, Joyce.

256
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:28,730
You're safe.

257
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:31,190
Barely.

258
01:49:33,850 --> 01:49:35,350
So they didn't kill you.

259
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:38,310
But they tried.

260
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:42,870
Did you find the girl?

261
01:49:43,590 --> 01:49:44,190
That's right.

262
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:52,090
What did I miss?

263
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:53,410
Let's see.

264
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:55,310
I made friends with a crow and an

265
01:49:55,310 --> 01:49:55,530
owl.

266
01:49:56,130 --> 01:49:57,670
And that goat says my name.

267
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:21,570
Welcome home.
