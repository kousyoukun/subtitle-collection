1
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,240
-Boss. This for you. -No, no, no. Come on.

2
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,880
I can't impose on your family.

3
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,740
No.

4
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,380
Yasmin, she made this just for you.

5
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,880
Jefe, please.

6
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Take it.

7
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,950
Tell her thank you.

8
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,720
Yeah.

9
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,190
So, listen.

10
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,890
Today's gonna be hard.

11
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,200
We got inspections all day.

12
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,460
Forms to build, forms to break down

13
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,170
and deliveries all gettin' in our way.

14
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,500
We work hard today,

15
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,570
there'll be a bonus for ya.

16
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,710
And let's all go home

17
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,980
with the same amount of fingers that we came with.

18
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,750
All right.

19
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,220
Hermanos.

20
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,520
Have a good day. Let's get it.

21
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,470
-Morning, Jess. -Buenos dias, Levon.

22
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,600
-How you doing? -I'm good.

23
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,010
-Gracias. -Hey, Levon.

24
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,740
No one's been asking you for money today?

25
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,710
No.

26
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,580
-Why? -Because, apparently,

27
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,380
I am the only person in the family

28
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,610
who can do the vendor accounting.

29
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,050
Oh, excuse me!

30
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,650
Hey, I guess we're evil parents, babe, huh?

31
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,480
'Cause we make her work a couple hours.

32
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,720
Not today.

33
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,250
How about you get those disbursements done, huh?

34
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,320
We got a line of trucks out there that need paying.

35
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
You could pay me.

36
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,490
Pay you for what?

37
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,530
For 19 years of free rent,

38
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,400
and groceries, and high school,

39
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,670
college, makeup, karate classes?

40
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
-You want me to keep goin'? -Really? No. It's okay.

41
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,940
Levon, can you sign that, please?

42
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,410
-Dad? -What?

43
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,910
-Today is a total shitshow. -I know.

44
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,410
And you scheduled three things at once.

45
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,810
She's not wrong.

46
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,980
Hi, yeah. This is Garcia and Family Construction.

47
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,310
Yeah, you're speaking with Carla,

48
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,510
you've had me on hold for a bit now.

49
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,650
So, we're gettin' those deliveries today, right?

50
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,050
Yeah, I'll hold.

51
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,520
This is what I need for tonight.

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
That's insane. What is that? Is that for your wedding or something?

53
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,190
No, it's for tonight.

54
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,030
We finished the semester, so we're gonna celebrate.

55
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,930
I mean, you just finished one semester.

56
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,270
-Right. It's a big milestone. -Is it?

57
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,800
-Yes. -Is that a thing?

58
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,470
Look, it could be worse, okay?

59
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,010
-Look, I'm passing the hat. -Mm-hmm. Yeah.

60
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,510
-That gets us a party van. -Oh, my God.

61
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,610
Locks in a private room for dinner.

62
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,780
Just saving like crazy.

63
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah. I just need a card on file.

64
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,180
Mija, I can't. I don't...

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
Mija...

66
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,920
Okay, fine. I don't need it.

67
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,620
Just give her what she wants.

68
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,690
No, Mom, I can fight my own battles.

69
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,060
Oh, no, no, nobody's arguing that.

70
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,900
I mean, everybody needs a party bus, right?

71
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,140
After they finish one semester. Here.

72
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,600
Thank you.

73
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,380
Hey, Kate.

74
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,800
Excuse me.

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,900
He needs to get back to work.

76
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,700
Get the fuck out of here. It's not your business.

77
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,730
I'm good, boss.

78
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,840
All good. Five minutes.

79
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,890
Hey!

80
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,210
I was respectful.

81
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,080
You weren't.

82
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,180
Get outta here. Get up.

83
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,820
Don't come back.

84
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,060
-Vamonos. -Vamonos.

85
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,130
You okay?

86
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,300
How did you do that?

87
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,170
We need to get back to work.

88
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,610
This one. Over to the right.

89
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,110
-You got it. -Thanks, Kate.

90
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,920
Levon! Holy fuck!

91
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,520
Was that some military shit?

92
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,650
You didn't see anything.

93
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,890
If Dad knew, he'd shit bricks.

94
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,060
Can you teach me?

95
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,560
Look, my grandpa, he was a paratrooper.

96
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,160
Taught me how to break fingers,

97
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,000
track animals.

98
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Break fingers?

99
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,770
Yeah.

100
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,600
Grandma made you tinga. Shredded chicken.

101
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,100
It's good.

102
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,340
And Grandma made you some handmade grandma tortillas.

103
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,410
Why is everyone always feeding me?

104
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,950
If we don't, you'll just eat canned tuna and peanut butter.

105
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,350
You didn't see anything, okay?

106
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,050
Snitches get stitches.

107
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,750
Just get my back if I ever need it.

108
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,990
Sure, Jenny.

109
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,720
See ya.

110
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,090
Love you, Daddy.

111
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Love you, too, honey. Get in the truck.

112
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,530
What's the occasion?

113
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,030
No occasion.

114
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:44,100
Meredith's entertaining some friends.

115
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,100
Yeah.

116
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,770
I didn't realize today was your visitation.

117
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,440
You could let her stay.

118
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,180
Yeah, please, Doctor Roth, we don't have to do this.

119
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,910
You weren't there when her mother needed you

120
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,080
and you won't be there when Meredith needs you,

121
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,850
but I will.

122
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,760
Oh, I know.

123
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,960
You want to strike me.

124
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,890
It's your only answer.

125
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:09,990
Violence.

126
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,570
You're an unsafe parent.

127
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,000
You're a killer.

128
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,070
You can't pretend that you're not.

129
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,410
Excuse me, Doctor Roth.

130
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,920
Today's my day.

131
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,190
Why's your grandfather throwing a party on my day?

132
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,900
I'm super hungry. I didn't eat.

133
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,130
I was waiting for you.

134
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,300
You were?

135
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,870
Yeah.

136
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,010
Okay. Let's go.

137
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,510
-Here you go. -Thank you.

138
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
-Thank you. -Enjoy.

139
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,350
I don't need you buying stuff.

140
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,350
Come on. Open it.

141
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,170
It's Mama.

142
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,900
I took that picture

143
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,410
with a film camera my dad gave me.

144
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,940
Grandpa took all of Mama's pictures down.

145
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,310
Sometimes I forget what she looks like.

146
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,220
She looks like you.

147
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,720
Dad, can I tell you something?

148
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,960
Anything.

149
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,660
I'm mad at Mama.

150
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,470
For dying and leaving us.

151
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,170
It's okay.

152
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,640
I hurt, too.

153
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,260
Matt will see you now.

154
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,970
He's throwing parties for her during my visitation time.

155
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,000
Staring at me, laughing.

156
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,570
He's baiting you.

157
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,310
Hoping you throw a punch.

158
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,070
Nah.

159
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,080
Then he wins.

160
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,950
Opposing counsel

161
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,480
alleges you have untreated PTSD

162
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,650
and brain trauma from your military service,

163
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,450
making you at-risk for violence.

164
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,790
I served Britain, the country of my birth, for 22 years.

165
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,430
I'm the fuckin' bad guy for it?

166
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,730
It gets worse.

167
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,170
They're requesting supervised visits

168
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,540
and a reduction in visitation from two hours a week

169
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,340
to one hour every two.

170
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,940
I have to fight this.

171
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,940
I have ten grand saved up.

172
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,610
From sleeping in your truck?

173
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,950
Court won't be thrilled

174
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,210
by your lack of a fixed residence.

175
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,450
Hey, I'll figure it out.

176
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,080
Why does Doctor Roth hate you so much?

177
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,550
He thinks I killed his daughter.

178
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,090
Did you?

179
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,530
It was suicide.

180
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,730
I was overseas on a deployment.

181
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,800
She battled depression her whole life.

182
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,900
You've heard of attrition warfare?

183
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,040
Yeah. You grind the enemy down slowly.

184
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,010
This guy's got a team

185
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,240
of thousand-dollar-an-hour attorneys

186
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,780
who will bleed you dry

187
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,380
until you turn to dust and blow away.

188
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,080
The best we can do is negotiated surrender.

189
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,050
You have a daughter?

190
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,430
I got you guys a little somethin'.

191
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,570
Nina.

192
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,500
Jocelyn...

193
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,570
-Chantel. And Rubi. -Thanks, Mama.

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,970
Dude, these are insane!

195
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,070
Where'd you get these?

196
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,070
I have a cousin. Or seven.

197
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,810
Salud , bitches!

198
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,070
Thank you.

199
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,290
Shots.

200
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,260
Hey!

201
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,460
What? What? What?

202
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,890
What the fuck are we still doing here?

203
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,430
He said he wants the One.

204
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,260
"I want the One. I want the fucking One."

205
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,500
What the fuck does that mean?

206
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,370
He'll know it when he sees her, okay?

207
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
Do you know how much fuckin' money

208
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,940
we're gonna make on this?

209
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,600
-We better. -Enjoy, yeah?

210
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,150
Hey, last establishment.

211
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,620
You guys have early flights.

212
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,960
Is that back table open?

213
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,200
It's yours if you tell me your name.

214
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,830
It's Jenny.

215
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,570
Hi, I'm Johnny.

216
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,370
Hi, Johnny.

217
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,710
Right here.

218
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,220
My man.

219
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,890
You are more than a pitch deck.

220
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,100
Nina?

221
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,170
-Nina, don't throw up. -I'm fine.

222
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,300
She's making her puke face.

223
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,670
-Let's get you to a bathroom. -Oh, ew.

224
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,300
Cheap! Bad energy.

225
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,880
Ew!

226
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
Oh, my God.

227
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,720
I hate you so much right now, it's not funny.

228
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,750
It's kinda funny.

229
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,490
Oh, my God, I look mad busted.

230
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,490
I cannot go out there like this.

231
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,430
Okay, well, pick your battles, 'cause we're leavin' in 30.

232
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,690
Fuck!

233
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,660
Go.

234
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,650
Jenny's missing.

235
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,490
What do you mean, "missing"?

236
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
She went out with her friends on Friday.

237
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,830
Saturday, we were worried,

238
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,370
so we called the cops, and then on Sunday...

239
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,170
She had a piano recital on Sunday night.

240
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,910
We invited half our family.

241
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,880
My cousin Dinora is a Police Captain in Philly,

242
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,780
and she says they don't work these cases.

243
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,380
They take a report and forget about it.

244
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,620
Can you help us?

245
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,190
I can keep the site running smoothly.

246
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,320
No. Help us find Jen.

247
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,930
My dad was a Green Beret.

248
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,330
I can see you guys comin' a mile away.

249
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:08,870
You hunt bad guys.

250
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,400
You jump outta planes.

251
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,810
And you get those bad guys.

252
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,040
I'm a different person now.

253
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,850
All right, well,

254
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,950
maybe this'll help her.

255
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Here, it's 50.

256
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,420
Take it.

257
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,260
We have another 20 for expenses.

258
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,230
Come on, just take it, man.

259
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,790
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,570
It's not who I am anymore.

261
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,900
Gunny, it's me!

262
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,940
Don't kill me!

263
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:20,170
I got steaks!

264
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,610
If you'd shot a foot to the left, I'd be dead.

265
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,710
If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead.

266
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,980
You know, for me,

267
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,680
there's no separation between day and night.

268
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,820
So, I got to make my own.

269
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,190
It's hard livin' in a gray world.

270
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,860
I couldn't save your eyes.

271
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,190
Sorry.

272
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,630
That eats at me.

273
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,400
No.

274
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,470
You saved my life.

275
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,970
Joyce would be burying tags in the back yard

276
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,940
if you hadn't come along, scooped me up and ran.

277
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,110
What's her name?

278
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,650
Jenny.

279
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,550
Jenny. All right.

280
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,850
She a good kid?

281
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,150
She's a great kid.

282
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,390
Now, you do this, you better lock in.

283
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,260
You better go full on, no half-measures.

284
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,630
But you do, God help 'em.

285
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,130
I told Jenny I had her back.

286
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,840
Well, uh...

287
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,540
I miss ya.

288
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,040
I worry about ya,

289
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,350
but you didn't have to come down here and pretend that

290
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,210
you needed my permission for something

291
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,580
you already made your mind up about.

292
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,050
Get in here. We're eating.

293
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,040
Hey, Carla.

294
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,070
Thanks for coming.

295
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Where is he?

296
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,270
Upstairs. First door on your left.

297
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,830
"Moonlight Sonata".

298
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,440
-Yeah. -It's beautiful.

299
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,470
She turned down a music scholarship

300
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,810
to go to business school.

301
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
She wanted to be like her pops.

302
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,180
Be a big land developer.

303
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,650
And she will.

304
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,150
Yeah.

305
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,560
Nah. No, thanks.

306
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,930
Your family needs hope.

307
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,830
But I can't face 'em like this.

308
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,770
When my wife passed,

309
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,740
and I left the Royal Marines,

310
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,740
a lot of people would've given up on me.

311
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,910
But you were patient with me.

312
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,780
-You, Carla, Jenny. -Jenny.

313
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,990
You're my family.

314
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,310
Look at me, brother.

315
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,380
I'm gonna bring her home.

316
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,610
I promise.

317
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:51,850
I'm gonna bring her home.

318
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,080
"Skip's Bar."

319
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,940
Thank you very much. Good, bro?

320
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,870
You good? Yeah?

321
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,550
How you doing?

322
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,380
You need a little aperitif, you know?

323
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,350
All right.

324
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,960
Oh, yo. Wrong house, kid.

325
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,260
Get the fuck out.

326
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,330
Hello, Johnny.

327
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,990
Wanna have a race? See who wins?

328
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,970
Hands up. Stand up.

329
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,200
Place your fingers behind your head.

330
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,340
You a cop?

331
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,600
You wish I was a cop.

332
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,540
Your adventure, kid.

333
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,390
Where's the girl?

334
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,390
What girl?

335
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,460
The missing girl.

336
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,600
The one your friends snatched outta the back of the bar.

337
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:02,770
I told the cops. She ran off. Drunk or somethin'.

338
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,200
Fuckin' poobutt can't hold her drink.

339
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,140
How's that my problem?

340
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,340
People lie.

341
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:12,580
Do you lie, Johnny?

342
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,580
I don't trust people.

343
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,550
I trust biology.

344
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,520
We're all wired the same.

345
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,390
Get the fuck up.

346
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,470
Fuck you.

347
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,610
Your mind knows you're in the bathtub

348
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,140
and it's just a wet towel.

349
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,310
But adrenaline makes your heart race,

350
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:51,120
so you burn more air.

351
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,120
Your nervous system tells you that you're drowning.

352
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,520
Your bosses know you deal dope over the bar top?

353
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,820
Steal from the till?

354
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,060
Fuck you!

355
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,110
You know these guys are next level.

356
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,180
They wipe out entire fucking bloodlines.

357
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,210
Fair enough.

358
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,050
Just know you're giving me names.

359
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,620
Your choice how.

360
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,150
Johnny?

361
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,160
Where are you, brother?

362
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,760
You're expecting company?

363
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,400
Damn fuckin' right, I am.

364
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:43,000
Open the door. Fuckin' kill you.

365
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,190
Russians.

366
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:07,990
Fuck.

367
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,450
I'm sorry, Mom.

368
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm sorry for...

369
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,730
shielding myself...

370
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,460
in a blanket of accomplishments.

371
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,030
I wish you could've seen me...

372
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:52,370
who I really am.

373
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,740
Just want to be strong like you.

374
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,980
What am I doing here?

375
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:34,110
on speaker It's better you see for yourself, boss.

376
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,580
It's not a big problem.

377
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,480
What the fuck have you two done, huh?

378
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,690
Why'd they shoot each other?

379
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,100
This is very unprofessional.

380
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:54,430
Johnny has no control. He's a weak man.

381
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,100
Maybe he talk crazy, and then it's bang-bang time.

382
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,000
-"Bang-bang time"? -Yeah.

383
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,410
Bang-bang time.

384
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,640
You notice anything different?

385
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,910
Your hair.

386
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,010
Idiot.

387
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,880
Where is my fucking money?

388
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,520
You think this was a robbery?

389
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,220
Impossible.

390
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,720
No one would rob us. No one is that stupid,

391
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,960
or that crazy.

392
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,820
This is a shotgun wound.

393
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,120
You see any shotguns?

394
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
-Hmm? -That's nine bands missing.

395
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,960
Ninety thousand dollars of our fucking money!

396
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,330
It's Symon's money.

397
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,350
Hey, sweetheart.

398
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,150
Hey, Daddy, what are you doing?

399
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,680
Uh, nothin'. Just, uh...

400
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,150
Just some work.

401
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,690
-Are you in school? -Yeah.

402
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,390
You supposed to be calling me from school?

403
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,630
No.

404
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,430
Everything okay?

405
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,930
Yeah, I just wanted to say, "hi." Love you, Daddy.

406
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,700
Love you, too.

407
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,930
Bye.

408
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,940
The fucking door opens itself?

409
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,100
I don't like this.

410
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,500
I'm alone in the bed all night.

411
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
You eat.

412
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,980
You come to bed for a bit.

413
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,790
You think the money falls from the sky?

414
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,630
Hmm?

415
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,080
Hope you don't mind.

416
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,680
I was hungry.

417
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,590
Thought we could have a little chat.

418
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,490
I'm gonna take the tape off.

419
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,630
But if you can't control your volume...

420
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,500
You go in the water.

421
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,210
Do you know who I am?

422
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,310
Should I?

423
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,340
You clearly have no idea who you fuck with.

424
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,150
Make yourself happy. Tell me.

425
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,820
You have heard of us?

426
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,320
I have.

427
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,650
Really?

428
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,820
The Vor.

429
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,690
The Bratva. The Brothers.

430
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,890
The League of Thieves.

431
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,900
Whatever Russian gangsters

432
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,760
like to call themselves these days.

433
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,070
You clearly are somebody.

434
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,200
You slaughter Vory soldiers.

435
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,140
You steal Vory money.

436
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,710
It was a misunderstanding.

437
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,610
I am a brother of high rank.

438
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,510
You and all connected with you,

439
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,610
will be hunted for three generations.

440
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,820
Yep. I assumed so.

441
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,090
We all know how these things play out

442
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,160
if you don't keep them tidy.

443
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,260
Fuck you!

444
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,390
That's for slapping that woman this morning.

445
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:31,360
That woman was my wife.

446
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,900
That's for slapping your wife.

447
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,270
Here's your money.

448
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,140
I'm not a thief.

449
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,280
I don't care about your business.

450
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,980
I'm lookin' for a young lady.

451
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,930
I... I don't understand.

452
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,530
The bar you do your dirty business out of,

453
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,660
a 19 year-old girl was kidnapped.

454
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,730
I'm lookin' for her.

455
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,770
Dimi.

456
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,280
Maybe you should keep your voice down.

457
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,950
What do you want?

458
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,520
Gimme the girl,

459
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,690
and everybody goes about their business.

460
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,290
A girl?

461
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:37,230
All of this is for a girl?

462
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,300
No one kills three people to sell a woman.

463
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,240
No one.

464
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,780
I'm not selling her.

465
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
I'm gonna bring her home.

466
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,980
Not stopping until I do.

467
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,720
Who are you?

468
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,290
What are you?

469
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
Fuck you.

470
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Fuck you.

471
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,300
Fuck you!

472
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,700
Okay, we're done.

473
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,870
Dimi.

474
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,170
Who are you, Dimi?

475
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,150
He takes money.

476
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,680
He leaves money.

477
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,420
He kills without fear.

478
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,990
The question is why?

479
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,690
Wolo was a respected man of honor,

480
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,070
but his son was never like us.

481
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,140
Dimi is not a businessman.

482
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,080
He prefers mischief over hard work.

483
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:11,080
He spits on his father's heart every fucking day.

484
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,890
Find this man.

485
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,930
And bring him to me.

486
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,780
My name is Jenny Garcia.

487
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:42,720
My father is Joe.

488
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,650
My mother is Carla.

489
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,950
You have the wrong girl. This is a mistake.

490
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,960
They're not real.

491
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,960
You're not real.

492
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,230
This...

493
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,400
is fucking real.

494
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,940
Eat your fuckin' food,

495
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:05,670
then you put on the fucking clothes

496
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,270
-and shut the fuck up! -Fuck you!

497
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,380
Have you ever seen someone die before?

498
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,410
Huh?

499
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,220
Their eyes just cloud right over.

500
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:25,960
Mmm. You're so fuckin' pretty. Huh?

501
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,530
Aren't you, Princess?

502
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,930
Aw.

503
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,270
Boop.

504
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,440
Eat your fuckin' food!

505
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,150
Believe the idea the

506
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:57,960
White Sox are in serious talks

507
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,460
to build a new stadium in the South Loops, The 78,

508
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,600
the location by the Chicago River just off Roosevelt.

509
00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:07,900
I love the idea of being in serious talks

510
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:09,830
for a new stadium in the South Loop.

511
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,680
How's it goin', cat? Getting rich contracting?

512
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:25,180
Oh, yeah. Pouring concrete more like.

513
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,390
I'm outta the game. I'm an honest taxpayer now.

514
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,660
You talked to Gunny? How's he doing?

515
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:34,390
Saw him the other day. He's happy.

516
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,860
Well, you never call me unless you need something,

517
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:38,160
so, what do you want?

518
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,500
Lookin' for someone called Dimi.

519
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,670
Probably Dimitri. An associate of Wolodymyr Kolisnyk.

520
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,440
That's a high-ranking dude, cat.

521
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,470
Mafia captain.

522
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,380
Legit Bratva shot caller.

523
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,540
Not a guy you wanna fuck with.

524
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,750
Nah, never.

525
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:56,380
This Dimi fella,

526
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,320
he might be involved in human trafficking.

527
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:01,990
Can you check NADDIS and NCIC? See if you can get a hit?

528
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,150
I gotta be careful,

529
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:05,320
but there's a bar called Hattie's in Joliet,

530
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,230
where they sell meth for the Russians.

531
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,830
Maybe you should get a beer there.

532
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,500
Nice one. Thanks.

533
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,760
Hey. Whatcha havin'?

534
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,260
I'll just have a beer. You pick.

535
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,900
Okay.

536
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:11,320
Oh, hey, stranger. Where you been?

537
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,690
Tryin' to make a buck.

538
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:15,460
You know,

539
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,260
rumor has it you and your shitbag brother

540
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:20,600
have been talkin' to the Russians.

541
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,230
Rumor has it you were so high,

542
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:24,070
you accidentally killed Big Mike in a trap house

543
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,870
and blamed it on a robbery crew.

544
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,370
Fuckin' shut up. Fuckin'...

545
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,670
Dutch finds out anybody's talkin' to the Russians but him,

546
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,440
he's gonna lose his fuckin' mind.

547
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,980
Shh!

548
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,580
Do you know this guy?

549
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,020
No. I've never seen him.

550
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:43,620
I don't like him.

551
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:44,760
Looks like a cop.

552
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,290
He's got a gun in his pocket.

553
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,500
Like a .38. You see it?

554
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,760
Fuck. Yes.

555
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,130
You're up, kid.

556
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,030
Follow me.

557
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,120
Go talk to the man.

558
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,770
You lookin' for somethin'?

559
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,600
My interests are strictly pharmaceutical, brother.

560
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
Any reason why you packin' heat, brah?

561
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm carrying money.

562
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,610
Hate to lose it to a man with a knife.

563
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,550
He's a cop.

564
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:23,320
Are you a cop?

565
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,820
Nah. Are you?

566
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,800
Run your pockets, Chief.

567
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,770
Let's check for that badge.

568
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,300
You heard the man.

569
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,670
Put it on the table.

570
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,200
Fuckin' now.

571
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:41,470
I didn't come here to be disrespected.

572
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:00,890
All right.

573
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Let's play.

574
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,200
Get him.

575
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:36,800
Get him, brother.

576
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,190
Bye, asshole.

577
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:09,460
Enough!

578
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:24,440
My grandpa told me to never shake hands sittin'.

579
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,210
Look at those bricks.

580
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:32,250
You ain't a cop, you're a working man.

581
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,050
Been in construction my whole life.

582
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,550
Were you a soldier?

583
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:38,060
'Cause you fight like a soldier.

584
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:39,620
I did my part.

585
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,430
I was Airborne.

586
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,860
They trained us to jump outta planes

587
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:44,430
and we ended up ridin' a bus into combat.

588
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:46,970
Sounds about right.

589
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Have a seat, brother.

590
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,570
I heard you're in a buyin' mood.

591
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,810
I'm lookin' for blue glass,

592
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,280
the good stuff.

593
00:50:58,310 --> 00:51:00,340
I need weight. Regular.

594
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,580
Like four pounds a month.

595
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,610
That's all?

596
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,450
Who you flippin' it to?

597
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,990
It goes where it's needed.

598
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,420
The customers are my concern, not yours.

599
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,090
And why here? Why us?

600
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:16,330
My Chicago connect is missin' in action.

601
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:19,870
I'm runnin' work crews in shifts 24/7.

602
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:21,770
Time is money.

603
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,170
Seven K for half a pound.

604
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,710
That's a Chicago price.

605
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,880
Five.

606
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,450
There's a pancake house

607
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,820
at the highway junction straight north of here.

608
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,580
Be there, 7:00 a.m., having breakfast.

609
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,290
And?

610
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,290
And bring five stacks.

611
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,460
Good talk.

612
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,960
Now get the fuck outta here.

613
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:15,750
Have a seat.

614
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,860
Mm.

615
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:29,330
This is like an awkward Tinder date.

616
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:31,700
Just give her the money.

617
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,420
Mmm. Lo, and behold.

618
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,760
People talk,

619
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,860
money fucks.

620
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:06,400
You got somethin' for me?

621
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,040
We don't know who the fuck you are, brother.

622
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:11,410
You'll get a call tellin' you where your shit is.

623
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:16,920
That's it?

624
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:20,480
Yeah. Uh-huh.

625
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,900
Don't play me.

626
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,070
I know where to find you.

627
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,870
Yeah. I guess you do.

628
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,770
Thank you for not shooting me.

629
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:46,640
fuckin' asshole.

630
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,420
-Yeah? -All right. You ready?

631
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,920
I'm gonna tell you where the skante's at, big dog.

632
00:53:58,960 --> 00:53:59,930
I'm waitin'.

633
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,790
Under your seat.

634
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:15,510
-Thank you. -Keep the burner phone.

635
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:16,710
I'mma hit you tomorrow.

636
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,210
Then you can tell me how y'all motherfuckers

637
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,280
built Rome in a day off my shit.

638
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,880
Then we can talk about weight.

639
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:58,220
Guess who's gonna be princess for a night?

640
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,930
You are Dimi's miracle workers. Huh?

641
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,930
And that, that is for Dimi's miracle.

642
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,130
Why her?

643
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,900
She reminded me of a painting in one of my father's houses.

644
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,840
Take her in the back.

645
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,180
Sure.

646
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,250
Look how cute these ones are.

647
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:09,320
They look like little sharks.

648
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:12,060
Just like you, cutie.

649
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,530
She bit me!

650
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:23,070
She's supposed to be asleep!

651
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,300
I'm so sorry, sir.

652
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,540
I want her out!

653
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,270
Yeah?

654
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,470
Did they like my shit?

655
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,940
Let's just say they were pleased.

656
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:02,210
There's plenty more where that came from,

657
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,810
but there's someone you gotta check in with

658
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,110
if we're gonna do business.

659
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,350
What does that mean?

660
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,010
Precautionary measures, brah.

661
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:12,680
Seein' as the Feds are handin' out life sentences per pound.

662
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,590
Yeah, this game's not for everyone.

663
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,890
I hear you, big dog.

664
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,690
I'mma shoot you an invite for a sit-down.

665
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,290
Bring your money and wear a suit.

666
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:23,730
I don't have a suit.

667
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,460
Shit. You will tomorrow.

668
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,330
'Cause these motherfuckers are as high power as it gets.

669
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,280
I'm here to see someone called Dutch.

670
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:40,010
He's right this way.

671
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,090
He's over there.

672
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,000
-How you doin'? -Hey, Dutch.

673
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:14,450
You bring the money?

674
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,810
May I?

675
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,420
First, you gotta turn your phone off.

676
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:32,830
Now what?

677
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,670
You already have my money.

678
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,200
I came here in good faith to do business.

679
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,310
My name is Dimi.

680
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:50,720
Yours?

681
00:58:51,620 --> 00:58:52,820
Bill.

682
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,750
Bill Coates.

683
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,460
Do you have driver's license, Bill Coates?

684
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:11,670
Excuse me?

685
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:14,140
It's fine. Let him check.

686
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:18,940
You drive rental.

687
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,480
We check plates.

688
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:24,880
Tax write-off.

689
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,020
That okay?

690
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,290
This man is my business partner.

691
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:37,200
He is small potatoes.

692
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,830
I am the big potatoes.

693
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:44,400
Tell me.

694
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,240
Will you be a problem?

695
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,780
Is this how you do business?

696
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,850
You invite me here to be threatened?

697
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,190
Checks out.

698
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:09,360
I apologize for that, "William."

699
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,170
You are clearly a...

700
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,000
serious person.

701
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,390
If you need resupply, use the burner.

702
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,990
Text bunny rabbit emoji.

703
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:41,230
Bunny rabbit emoji.

704
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,030
You made aware I need four pounds a month?

705
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,960
Oh.

706
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,030
Then text eggplant emoji.

707
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,240
We are aware.

708
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,010
If you like what is in the case,

709
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:00,850
we do more business.

710
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:03,920
Now, you leave and don't look back.

711
01:01:05,350 --> 01:01:06,620
Fine by me.

712
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,570
Johnny, you're a real piece of shit.

713
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:33,340
You sneaky motherfucker.

714
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:43,480
Hi, asshole.

715
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,950
Hmm.

716
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:56,730
He's here.

717
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,070
-Oh, shit. - -on speakers He's in a black Dodge Ram

718
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,370
hiding in the trees.

719
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,470
Okay, we're pulling up now.

720
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:08,940
Let's go!

721
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,620
Fuck! He just fuckin' left on a bike! Go!

722
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:30,390
Go! Go! Go!

723
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,730
Fuck!

724
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,760
Show me your hands.

725
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,860
Hey.

726
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,190
You didn't see us here.

727
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:12,130
Nothing fucking happened.

728
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,100
We'll take it from here.

729
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:15,600
You're on the payroll too?

730
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,620
How do you know Dimi?

731
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,290
What is your business with Dimi?

732
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,330
Ah, you two assholes.

733
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,700
That man you drowned,

734
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:49,500
in his own pool while his wife was at Pilates,

735
01:05:50,870 --> 01:05:52,540
that man was our uncle.

736
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:53,570
He wouldn't shut up.

737
01:05:54,570 --> 01:05:55,470
I warned him.

738
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:57,980
-Do you know who we are, hmm? -Hey. Hey.

739
01:05:58,010 --> 01:06:00,180
Yeah, people whose ma dresses 'em funny.

740
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:02,210
This is fucking couture, man.

741
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,520
It's our fucking brand!

742
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:06,720
Tie up his legs.

743
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:15,860
If you want me to be scared, you gotta try harder.

744
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,610
Whoa!

745
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:35,600
That is Vanko.

746
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,410
And that is Danya.

747
01:08:47,110 --> 01:08:48,980
These are my sons.

748
01:08:49,010 --> 01:08:51,780
My house and my lineage end

749
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:56,590
on these cold, steel tables.

750
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:05,600
Convene the war counsel.

751
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,680
Excuse me, dear.

752
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:26,450
Fuck off.

753
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:41,900
Oh, wow.

754
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:43,600
Absolutely fuckin' not.

755
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:52,340
Oh, fuck.

756
01:09:53,410 --> 01:09:55,380
You're lucky you're not already dead.

757
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,450
Dimi, apologies, okay?

758
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,820
I'm sorry. I'm truly fuckin' sorry.

759
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:02,120
She fucking bit half his face off.

760
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,920
-It wasn't exactly half his face. But... -Oh.

761
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,420
Thirty-six stitches.

762
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,560
That's a lot.

763
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,560
To reattach his cheek.

764
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,830
I am in the business of pleasure, not surgery.

765
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,470
Tell me...

766
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,140
Fuck.

767
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,150
Do you know what business means?

768
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,350
Do I... No. I mean, yeah. Fuck.

769
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:32,420
Business means

770
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:33,820
you keep your word.

771
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,990
You deliver promises. You make customer happy.

772
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,190
Not bite fucking face off!

773
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:43,930
-Understood. -No.

774
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:46,930
You just fucked me out of 200 grand.

775
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,470
If you make one, I make two.

776
01:10:55,940 --> 01:10:58,610
Customer wants her dead. I want her dead.

777
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,050
You kill her. You know where to take her.

778
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,210
Consider it done.

779
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,350
Now fuck off!

780
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,580
Fucking off, sir.

781
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:06,680
Holy shit, he was pissed.

782
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,620
Fucking beyond. He was this close to smokin' us both.

783
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:09,720
We gotta whack that girl.

784
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,020
Fine by me. Let's do the little bitch.

785
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:18,160
We are facing a devil.

786
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:23,470
This devil kills two soldiers.

787
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,040
He drowns Wolodymyr,

788
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,600
an esteemed captain.

789
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:30,780
Now he kills my sons.

790
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,750
You do understand my concern?

791
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:36,050
Where is Dimi?

792
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,180
Won't he know who this devil is?

793
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,250
Dimi's hiding.

794
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,500
They will help you find Dimi.

795
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:56,130
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

796
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,700
Now go.

797
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:05,070
Some champagne?

798
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,220
Your father is dead.

799
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,120
Tied to a chair

800
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,290
and drowned in his pool.

801
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,100
So, it's good news.

802
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,460
The man who killed him

803
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,170
murdered my sons.

804
01:13:37,670 --> 01:13:39,070
Danya and Vanko?

805
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:41,940
What the fuck?

806
01:13:43,510 --> 01:13:45,740
You did not know this?

807
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,880
How the fuck would I know? Nobody tells me anything.

808
01:13:49,950 --> 01:13:52,780
The Brotherhood treats me like I'm radioactive.

809
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:00,620
Who is this man?

810
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,130
I ask with kindness.

811
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:16,740
I bankroll biker gang with meth connection.

812
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:19,410
They introduce me to buyer with real cash.

813
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:21,280
We met for five minutes.

814
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:22,310
That's it.

815
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,120
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

816
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:28,790
I have this.

817
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,890
He's hunting you.

818
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:00,320
Found him.

819
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:08,360
Oh.

820
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,290
-Hello? -Hi. Mr. Cade?

821
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,160
This is the Main Office.

822
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:42,700
Um, no one's come to pick up Meredith today.

823
01:15:42,730 --> 01:15:43,900
I'll be right there.

824
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,180
-Hey. -Good day?

825
01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:00,850
-Yeah. -Let's go.

826
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:07,450
Where's Grandpa? He's never late.

827
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:09,090
He's not answering me.

828
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,390
I sent him, like, 20 messages.

829
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:12,420
I'm sure he's fine.

830
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,430
You didn't kill him, did you?

831
01:16:16,790 --> 01:16:18,100
Dad, I'm kidding.

832
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,470
Do you trust me?

833
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:25,940
Yeah.

834
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,840
So, if I tell you something,

835
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,140
you know you can believe me, right?

836
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,980
Okay, the build-up is just making it worse.

837
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,510
I made a big mistake.

838
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,950
Oh, my God. You did kill Grandpa.

839
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:37,620
Merry, I'm serious.

840
01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,920
Some really bad people are after me,

841
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:41,090
and I don't want anyone I love to get hurt.

842
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:44,360
Are you sharing your location with Grandpa?

843
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:45,890
Yeah.

844
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:47,630
Can you see his location?

845
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:49,190
Maybe, I don't know.

846
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,830
Daddy, he's at home.

847
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:16,990
Merry, stay here, okay?

848
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,490
Merry! Stay there!

849
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,330
Daddy, be careful!

850
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:07,970
Who were they?

851
01:18:08,710 --> 01:18:10,040
Russian mafia?

852
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,480
Yes.

853
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,180
They were looking for you.

854
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,890
This happened because of you.

855
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:25,120
Violence follows you like a cloud.

856
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:28,430
He could've left you in there, Grandpa.

857
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:30,190
He saved your life.

858
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,100
I can acknowledge that.

859
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,640
You should go to the hospital.

860
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,070
You'll be safe there.

861
01:18:41,670 --> 01:18:42,840
I'll take care of Merry.

862
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,680
It's time o let the cops handle this.

863
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,310
Cops can't stop them.

864
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,880
All right.

865
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,420
We'll figure it out later.

866
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,620
And, Levon,

867
01:18:56,590 --> 01:18:57,760
thank you.

868
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,010
You remember Gunny?

869
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:17,540
Your blind friend who doesn't know he's blind?

870
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,880
That's the one.

871
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:20,380
He has a country house.

872
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:22,680
We'll be safe there till the storm passes.

873
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:36,560
Hi.

874
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,560
You wanna come inside? Come on.

875
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,570
-You hungry? -Always.

876
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:43,100
-And you? -Yeah.

877
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,070
What happened, man?

878
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,240
You fuck with the wrong people, huh?

879
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,340
Hey, you could've stopped me.

880
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,240
What force on earth is gonna stop you?

881
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,180
It's gettin' ugly.

882
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:58,450
Can you find this girl? Can you really find this girl?

883
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,520
I can find her.

884
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:01,550
I'm gonna bring her home.

885
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:04,120
I hear that. You got a plan?

886
01:20:06,590 --> 01:20:09,090
I'm gonna ask this Dimi fella where she is.

887
01:20:11,060 --> 01:20:12,930
All roads lead to him.

888
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,500
Now, you killed your way into this,

889
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:16,600
you're gonna have to kill your way out of it.

890
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,940
I figured as much.

891
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,010
I can help you with that.

892
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,540
Oh, yeah?

893
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:24,140
Let me show you somethin'.

894
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:31,380
After you, sir.

895
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,650
All right, I will be your weapons sommelier

896
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:37,290
for this evening.

897
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,390
If you come around this wall,

898
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:40,530
you see the Avtomat Kalashnikov,

899
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,360
been killing Americans since 1947.

900
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:46,900
Also, comes in a deluxe, blingy version pulled direct

901
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:48,470
from Saddam's palace.

902
01:20:48,500 --> 01:20:50,600
What you got over here is the M-Four Carbine,

903
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,070
it's the Chevy Impala of the war on terror.

904
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,840
Beautiful MP5 SD here if you wanna kill somebody,

905
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,210
but you don't wanna wake 'em up.

906
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,680
But this is the real beast here.

907
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:02,920
One of the original weapons of

908
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,480
the four horsemen of the apocalypse.

909
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:07,620
The M14.

910
01:21:10,090 --> 01:21:11,760
You might remember this weapon.

911
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:13,520
I don't want to, but I do.

912
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:15,560
There you go.

913
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,740
I'll have to drill out the serial numbers.

914
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,110
Oh, no, that's already done.

915
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:31,610
These were never here. Never anywhere.

916
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,050
Kinda like us,

917
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:36,210
back in the day.

918
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:38,450
We did some righteous shit, brother.

919
01:21:40,890 --> 01:21:42,120
Yeah, we did.

920
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,560
-What's in there? -None of your business.

921
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:53,200
Can I come?

922
01:21:53,930 --> 01:21:55,530
Absolutely not.

923
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:57,300
What about school?

924
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,740
You'll miss a couple of days, at most.

925
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,180
I barely see you.

926
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:09,980
I don't want you getting in trouble.

927
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,080
Then I'll never see you.

928
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,720
That's not gonna happen.

929
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:16,620
See this? This is you.

930
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:18,620
Half and half.

931
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:21,830
I want you to hold onto this.

932
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,600
I'm comin' back for that.

933
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:27,730
Okay.

934
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:31,970
I love you.

935
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,040
Love you, Daddy.

936
01:22:37,310 --> 01:22:38,680
Daddy, I don't want you getting hurt.

937
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,610
I'll be back soon, okay?

938
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:43,820
Gunny, take good care of her.

939
01:22:43,850 --> 01:22:45,220
Yeah, of course.

940
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,420
-Thank you, Joyce. -This way.

941
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,820
-Bye, Levon. -All right, sweetheart.

942
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:14,250
"Our Father,

943
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:16,380
who art in heaven,

944
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,320
hallowed be thy name,

945
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:20,650
thy kingdom come,

946
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:22,420
thy will be done."

947
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:24,920
God ain't here, sweetheart.

948
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:28,030
Have a nice nap, Princess?

949
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,330
We gotta pull over and load this bitch

950
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:31,030
with some fuckin' sleeping pills...

951
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

952
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,100
-Fucking bitch! -Hey, take it easy!

953
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,570
-Pull over! -Come on! Stop!

954
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:36,840
Fucking get it, fucking bitch.

955
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:37,970
Fucking grab that bitch!

956
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,500
Pull over! Pull over! Pull over!

957
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,580
God damn it! Where's my fucking gun!

958
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,180
Fuck!

959
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:55,420
Fuck.

960
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:06,630
Fuckin' move, Viper!

961
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:41,600
Fuck! Fuck!

962
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,010
I mean, what the fuck?

963
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:49,980
She is fast.

964
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:52,910
We're going back to fuckin' prison!

965
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:54,310
Huh?

966
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,050
Huh? You get it?

967
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,920
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

968
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:00,820
Fuck! Okay, okay.

969
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,920
Fuck! Fuck!

970
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:06,860
Shit.

971
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:21,970
Okay, genius,

972
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:24,440
now what?

973
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:46,030
Are you all right?

974
01:25:48,830 --> 01:25:50,840
My name is Jenny Garcia. I was kidnapped.

975
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:52,870
It's all right. We know who you are.

976
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,910
Let's get you home.

977
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:56,340
Okay.

978
01:26:22,330 --> 01:26:23,740
I'm so fucking sorry.

979
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,910
Miss me?

980
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:32,980
Fuck!

981
01:26:36,510 --> 01:26:38,480
Fucking dome the bitch!

982
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:44,060
-You gotta be kidding me. -Is that him?

983
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,690
What the fuck?

984
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:47,630
Fuck, it's a video call.

985
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:49,460
Here, take the fucking phone! Give me the...

986
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:52,030
-Fuck! -...God damn fucking gun.

987
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,660
Hey, sir.

988
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,970
Dimi says you still have the girl.

989
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,940
Uh, yeah, yeah. We still got her.

990
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,500
Show me she's still alive.

991
01:27:06,410 --> 01:27:07,810
See? Still alive.

992
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:13,220
I want a second date tonight, at the farmhouse.

993
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:14,820
One million dollars.

994
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:17,020
Uh, yeah. Whatever you want, sir.

995
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,190
I'll get her cleaned up and smelling real pretty for you.

996
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,690
No, no, no. I want her dirty.

997
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:23,190
Not sleepy,

998
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:26,460
but dirty and alive.

999
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:29,030
For now.

1000
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:34,070
-Fuck, yeah. -Oh, yes.

1001
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,410
Which passport, okay?

1002
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:37,280
You sent me all these passports.

1003
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:39,480
I can't tell. Red? Blue? Green?

1004
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:42,350
-I don't know what color, just tell me. - -Where are we going?

1005
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,250
What? Okay. Yeah. Go.

1006
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,820
I take all of them, okay?

1007
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:50,420
-What do you want? You want money? -No, I don't...

1008
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:51,490
Here, take your money. You take money.

1009
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:52,660
I don't want your fucking money!

1010
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:53,960
-You take all the money. -I don't want

1011
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:55,530
-your fucking money! -You take all the money, okay?

1012
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:58,060
-Let me help you! -No, no, I don't need help.

1013
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,170
Fuck.

1014
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,340
Get away! Stop!

1015
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:05,040
Starting tomorrow, rehab.

1016
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:09,340
All you do is let me slip down slippery slope.

1017
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:12,840
You're supposed to be my rock.

1018
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,780
You know, like they say, "Oh, she's my rock."

1019
01:28:14,810 --> 01:28:16,480
"Hey, thank you." I have nothing to thank you for.

1020
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:30,460
You know what? You are just an enabler.

1021
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:37,200
he's here!

1022
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,100
Okay.

1023
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:10,500
Okay. You made your point.

1024
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:11,870
Now we make a deal, and you begin

1025
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,640
a new life as a wealthy man, huh?

1026
01:29:13,670 --> 01:29:15,710
I can pay my own bills.

1027
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:17,780
Congrats.

1028
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,150
-Come closer and she dies. -No!

1029
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:21,310
I figured that.

1030
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:27,390
You should disappear. Take the money.

1031
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:29,850
Make a nice life.

1032
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,170
Where is she?

1033
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:50,180
I do not know this woman.

1034
01:29:51,380 --> 01:29:52,840
You're a bad liar.

1035
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,150
Why risk everything?

1036
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,780
Why kill everyone for her?

1037
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,650
'Cause I told her I had her back.

1038
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:09,260
If I give you this woman,

1039
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,260
you let me live?

1040
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,200
Because if I just give you the address,

1041
01:30:16,770 --> 01:30:18,700
then you shoot me, huh?

1042
01:30:18,740 --> 01:30:21,910
What if you give me a fake address and I shoot you?

1043
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,280
That's bad for both of us.

1044
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,590
Head south on 57.

1045
01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:35,220
Then I give you her address.

1046
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,220
Let's go.

1047
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:41,260
You know this guy?

1048
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:44,060
Of course, I know. He's Viper.

1049
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,700
He's Chief of Human Resource Department

1050
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:49,770
and recruiting for special projects.

1051
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,040
Why you do all this for a whore?

1052
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,080
Say it again.

1053
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,250
Please, say that again.

1054
01:31:02,450 --> 01:31:03,750
Thought so.

1055
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:05,250
Okay, Dimi,

1056
01:31:05,850 --> 01:31:07,250
tell me where we're going.

1057
01:31:08,450 --> 01:31:09,750
Where is she?

1058
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:13,390
There.

1059
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,020
She's in there?

1060
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,950
She's there.

1061
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:41,220
Promise?

1062
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:42,920
I promise.

1063
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
She's there.

1064
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:01,810
Why her?

1065
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,240
Who decides?

1066
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:11,350
Viper goes to club,

1067
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,820
takes pictures of pretty girls.

1068
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:16,350
I send them to clients, they make choice.

1069
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:19,020
Meeting is arranged.

1070
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:23,190
This is my specialty service.

1071
01:32:23,230 --> 01:32:25,730
Like shopping for a set of snow tires.

1072
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,440
These are human beings.

1073
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:37,340
You think money gives a shit

1074
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,740
where it comes from?

1075
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,480
If I didn't do this,

1076
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:42,950
somebody else would.

1077
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,920
You still haven't told me why.

1078
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:48,750
Why do you hunt us?

1079
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:50,460
You have a daughter?

1080
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:52,920
No.

1081
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:54,890
Then you won't understand.

1082
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:36,160
Hey, good lookin' out.

1083
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,300
Hey, yo, we good, brother?

1084
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:42,300
Man, we far from good.

1085
01:34:42,330 --> 01:34:44,370
That motherfucker we hooked up with Dimi

1086
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:47,110
clapped out half a dozen Russians tonight.

1087
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,870
Rumor is, he's on his way to Dimi's trap house right now.

1088
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:54,280
Everybody,

1089
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:55,850
mount the fuck up!

1090
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:57,520
You heard the man. Mount up!

1091
01:35:56,140 --> 01:35:57,540
That's funny shit.

1092
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:17,130
Sounds lovely, Princess.

1093
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,280
I don't condone this behavior,

1094
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,450
but my bank account does.

1095
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,120
Hey. It's time.

1096
01:36:40,150 --> 01:36:41,790
What the fuck are we still doing here? Come on.

1097
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:43,150
Yeah. I'll get the pervert.

1098
01:36:44,690 --> 01:36:47,190
We're all just numbers, kid. Nothin' personal.

1099
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:49,560
Feels pretty fuckin' personal to me.

1100
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:07,580
We have to go now, sir.

1101
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:08,610
Why?

1102
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,680
It's now or never.

1103
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,750
Then it's now.

1104
01:37:46,650 --> 01:37:48,320
What have I done to you?

1105
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,520
Nothing.

1106
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,690
That's the best part.

1107
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,430
I wonder what you look like on...

1108
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:03,740
the inside.

1109
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:21,390
The fuck was that?

1110
01:38:21,420 --> 01:38:22,620
whoa.

1111
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:49,750
Levon!

1112
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:52,520
Are they fucking shooting?

1113
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:54,550
Who's gonna get fucked now, huh?

1114
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:13,370
He's in there.

1115
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:15,240
Shooting the place up.

1116
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:18,910
Everybody,

1117
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:20,440
lock and load.

1118
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,680
Let's go get this motherfucker.

1119
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:24,080
Yeah, you two on me.

1120
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:25,420
You heard the man. Come on.

1121
01:39:25,450 --> 01:39:27,420
Stay tight, stay right.

1122
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:30,090
Demon, put it through the glass.

1123
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,220
You got it.

1124
01:40:04,190 --> 01:40:05,360
Levon!

1125
01:40:05,390 --> 01:40:07,790
Shut the fuck up!

1126
01:40:07,830 --> 01:40:09,330
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

1127
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:11,700
Yeah?

1128
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:14,370
You just... Yeah.

1129
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,600
I'm beginning to think

1130
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:18,000
that you do not know what you are doing!

1131
01:40:18,040 --> 01:40:19,200
Don't worry, sir.

1132
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:20,670
Everything's under control.

1133
01:40:20,710 --> 01:40:21,740
I promise you.

1134
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,250
I'm gonna cut your heart out.

1135
01:40:32,280 --> 01:40:33,480
Good luck.

1136
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:06,790
What the fuck is your real name?

1137
01:41:06,820 --> 01:41:08,390
Levon.

1138
01:41:08,420 --> 01:41:09,860
Nice to meet you, Levon.

1139
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:11,990
You ready, son?

1140
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:12,990
I'm always ready.

1141
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,130
My fight wasn't with you.

1142
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:23,470
I know, brother.

1143
01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,400
Finish it.

1144
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:48,430
Sorry, brother.

1145
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:09,710
-Levon! -What the fuck?

1146
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,720
How dare you come in here?

1147
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:22,330
-Fuck! Shit! -Oh, fuck!

1148
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:23,860
Oh, that is not good.

1149
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:29,500
What the fuck?

1150
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:31,340
-Hang on. -Reload!

1151
01:42:31,370 --> 01:42:32,840
wait, wait, wait.

1152
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:33,770
No, no, no!

1153
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,040
-I can explain everything! -Fuck!

1154
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:36,340
No!

1155
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:49,650
Oh, shit.

1156
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,430
Mommy!

1157
01:42:57,460 --> 01:42:59,230
Fuck!

1158
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:00,800
Fuck!

1159
01:43:00,830 --> 01:43:01,730
Fuckin' bitch!

1160
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:03,430
Fuck.

1161
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,400
Fuck you!

1162
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:13,910
It's over now.

1163
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,050
Fucking die, bitch!

1164
01:43:50,250 --> 01:43:51,520
I think I killed her.

1165
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:54,120
Good.

1166
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:02,790
Fuck.

1167
01:44:02,830 --> 01:44:03,760
Whoa.

1168
01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:06,230
Stay on my six.

1169
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:07,460
What's that mean?

1170
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:09,030
Follow me.

1171
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:23,550
There's an active shooter in there.

1172
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,140
Shit.

1173
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:55,380
Let's kill this guy.

1174
01:45:12,560 --> 01:45:13,830
What was that?

1175
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:14,870
Bluetooth.

1176
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:19,400
Is that a grenade?

1177
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,740
Mind your ears.

1178
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:30,220
Oh.

1179
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,350
You ready?

1180
01:45:35,390 --> 01:45:36,920
No.

1181
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,960
Time to go.

1182
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,570
See you on the other side.

1183
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,480
What was that?

1184
01:45:57,510 --> 01:45:59,040
Respect for an old friend.

1185
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:27,710
You ready to go home?

1186
01:46:27,740 --> 01:46:29,740
Get me the hell outta here.

1187
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:53,060
Yes, my brother.

1188
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:54,300
He escaped...

1189
01:46:55,330 --> 01:46:56,730
with the girl.

1190
01:46:56,770 --> 01:46:58,270
None of this was business.

1191
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:01,710
The devil has what he came for.

1192
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:05,310
Let him go.

1193
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:09,580
I understand our need to move quietly in the world.

1194
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:12,520
But I will not turn the other cheek

1195
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:16,390
to the man who killed my children.

1196
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:19,060
Then we will kill you.

1197
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:22,660
The Brotherhood comes before your personal vengeance.

1198
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:25,400
Do you understand?

1199
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:26,760
I understand.

1200
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,020
Hey...

1201
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:48,650
snitches get stitches.

1202
01:48:05,370 --> 01:48:07,540
¡Mija! Oh, my God.

1203
01:48:13,380 --> 01:48:16,750
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. -No. No.

1204
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,920
No. No.

1205
01:48:22,550 --> 01:48:23,790
Levon!

1206
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,030
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

1207
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:45,040
I was thinking about taking Merry

1208
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:46,340
out to the chicken coop today.

1209
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:47,210
Oh.

1210
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:48,580
-Yeah, would you like that? -Yeah.

1211
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,750
-Yeah. -I don't know.

1212
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:51,580
You better watch out for that old grumpy one.

1213
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:53,620
He's mean. He's mean.

1214
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:55,420
Oh, no. He's mean.

1215
01:48:58,120 --> 01:49:00,330
Hey, Dad, it's you! You came back.

1216
01:49:03,230 --> 01:49:04,230
Told you I would.

1217
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:10,030
You're okay, Daddy?

1218
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:11,840
Yeah. I nicked myself shaving.

1219
01:49:16,440 --> 01:49:17,380
Hi.

1220
01:49:17,410 --> 01:49:18,680
Welcome back.

1221
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:22,250
Hey, Joyce.

1222
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,980
You're in one piece.

1223
01:49:26,350 --> 01:49:27,350
Just about.

1224
01:49:29,820 --> 01:49:31,860
Well, I guess they didn't kill you, huh?

1225
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:34,530
Nah. They really tried their best.

1226
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:36,030
Oh.

1227
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:39,060
You found that girl?

1228
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:41,070
I found her.

1229
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:48,310
So, what did I miss?

1230
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:51,810
Well, I made friends with a crow and an owl.

1231
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,110
And there's a goat I taught to say my name.

1232
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:56,680
-No. -Yeah.

1233
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,120
It was really cool. I was just talking,

1234
01:49:58,150 --> 01:49:59,480
and then it was like, "Merry!

1235
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,550
"Merry!"

1236
01:50:16,830 --> 01:50:18,240
Welcome back, brother.

1237
01:50:19,170 --> 01:50:19,940
You're home.
