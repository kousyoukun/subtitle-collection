1
00:03:40,143 --> 00:03:43,246
-Boss. This for you.
-No, no, no. Come on.

2
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,881
I can't impose on your family.

3
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:45,749
No.

4
00:03:45,782 --> 00:03:49,386
Yasmin, she made this
just for you.

5
00:03:49,418 --> 00:03:50,887
<i>Jefe,</i> please.

6
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:52,822
Take it.

7
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,958
Tell her thank you.

8
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:57,727
Yeah.

9
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,195
So, listen.

10
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:01,898
Today's gonna be hard.

11
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:05,201
We got inspections all day.

12
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:07,469
Forms to build,
forms to break down

13
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:09,172
and deliveries
all gettin' in our way.

14
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,507
We work hard today,

15
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:13,575
there'll be a bonus for ya.

16
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:18,715
And let's all go home

17
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,984
with the same amount
of fingers that we came with.

18
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:23,753
All right.

19
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:26,222
<i>Hermanos.</i>

20
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,524
Have a good day.
Let's get it.

21
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:45,474
-Morning, Jess.
<i>-Buenos dias,</i> Levon.

22
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,608
-How you doing?
-I'm good.

23
00:04:46,642 --> 00:04:48,011
<i>-Gracias.</i>
-Hey, Levon.

24
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:49,746
No one's been asking you
for money today?

25
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:50,714
No.

26
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,581
-Why?
-Because, apparently,

27
00:04:52,614 --> 00:04:54,384
I am the only person
in the family

28
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,617
who can do
the vendor accounting.

29
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:57,053
Oh, excuse me!

30
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,654
Hey, I guess we're
evil parents, babe, huh?

31
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:00,489
'Cause we make her work
a couple hours.

32
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:01,725
Not today.

33
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,259
How about you get those
disbursements done, huh?

34
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:05,328
We got a line of trucks
out there that need paying.

35
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:06,363
You could pay me.

36
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:08,497
Pay you for what?

37
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,532
For 19 years of free rent,

38
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,402
and groceries,
and high school,

39
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:14,670
college, makeup,
karate classes?

40
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,505
-You want me to keep goin'?
-Really? No. It's okay.

41
00:05:16,538 --> 00:05:17,941
Levon,
can you sign that, please?

42
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:20,410
-Dad?
-What?

43
00:05:20,443 --> 00:05:21,911
-Today is a total shitshow.
-I know.

44
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:23,413
And you scheduled
three things at once.

45
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:25,815
She's not wrong.

46
00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:27,984
Hi, yeah. This is Garcia
and Family Construction.

47
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,319
Yeah, you're speaking
with Carla,

48
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,519
you've had me on hold
for a bit now.

49
00:05:30,552 --> 00:05:31,653
So, we're gettin' those
deliveries today, right?

50
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:35,058
Yeah, I'll hold.

51
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:38,527
This is
what I need for tonight.

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,364
That's insane. What is that?
Is that for your wedding
or something?

53
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:43,199
No, it's for tonight.

54
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,036
We finished the semester,
so we're gonna celebrate.

55
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,937
I mean, you just finished
one semester.

56
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,273
-Right. It's a big milestone.
-Is it?

57
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,808
-Yes.
-Is that a thing?

58
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:53,476
Look, it could be worse, okay?

59
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,011
-Look, I'm passing the hat.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

60
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:56,513
-That gets us a party van.
-Oh, my God.

61
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:57,613
Locks in a private room
for dinner.

62
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:58,782
Just saving like crazy.

63
00:05:58,815 --> 00:06:01,583
Yeah.
I just need a card on file.

64
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:04,187
<i>Mija,</i> I can't. I don't...

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,221
<i>Mija...</i>

66
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,925
Okay, fine. I don't need it.

67
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,626
Just give her what she wants.

68
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:12,695
No, Mom,
I can fight my own battles.

69
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,065
Oh, no, no,
nobody's arguing that.

70
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,905
I mean, everybody needs
a party bus, right?

71
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:24,140
After they finish
one semester. Here.

72
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,608
Thank you.

73
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,384
Hey, Kate.

74
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:50,800
Excuse me.

75
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,902
He needs to get back to work.

76
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:55,705
Get the fuck out of here.
It's not your business.

77
00:06:55,738 --> 00:06:56,739
I'm good, boss.

78
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:58,842
All good. Five minutes.

79
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,893
Hey!

80
00:07:36,678 --> 00:07:38,214
I was respectful.

81
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:40,083
You weren't.

82
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,188
Get outta here. Get up.

83
00:07:45,654 --> 00:07:46,823
Don't come back.

84
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:51,060
<i>-Vamonos.</i>
<i>-Vamonos.</i>

85
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:03,139
You okay?

86
00:08:03,173 --> 00:08:04,307
How did you do that?

87
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:08,178
We need to get back to work.

88
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:12,615
This one.
Over to the right.

89
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,117
-You got it.
-Thanks, Kate.

90
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,920
Levon! Holy fuck!

91
00:08:16,953 --> 00:08:18,521
Was that some military shit?

92
00:08:18,555 --> 00:08:20,657
You didn't see anything.

93
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,892
If Dad knew, he'd shit bricks.

94
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,061
Can you teach me?

95
00:08:25,094 --> 00:08:27,564
Look, my grandpa,
he was a paratrooper.

96
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:29,165
Taught me
how to break fingers,

97
00:08:29,832 --> 00:08:31,000
track animals.

98
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:32,602
Break fingers?

99
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:33,770
Yeah.

100
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:36,606
Grandma made you tinga.
Shredded chicken.

101
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,107
It's good.

102
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,344
And Grandma made you some
handmade grandma tortillas.

103
00:08:42,745 --> 00:08:44,414
Why is everyone
always feeding me?

104
00:08:44,447 --> 00:08:47,951
If we don't, you'll just eat
canned tuna and peanut butter.

105
00:08:49,752 --> 00:08:51,354
You didn't see anything, okay?

106
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:53,056
Snitches get stitches.

107
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:54,757
Just get my back
if I ever need it.

108
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,992
Sure, Jenny.

109
00:08:56,526 --> 00:08:57,727
See ya.

110
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,095
Love you, Daddy.

111
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,364
Love you, too, honey.
Get in the truck.

112
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:40,536
What's the occasion?

113
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,038
No occasion.

114
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:44,107
Meredith's entertaining
some friends.

115
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,108
Yeah.

116
00:09:45,141 --> 00:09:47,777
I didn't realize today
was your visitation.

117
00:09:49,646 --> 00:09:51,447
You could let her stay.

118
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:53,182
Yeah, please, Doctor Roth,
we don't have to do this.

119
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,917
You weren't there
when her mother needed you

120
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:57,086
and you won't be there
when Meredith needs you,

121
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,855
but I will.

122
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:02,760
Oh, I know.

123
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,961
You want to strike me.

124
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:07,897
It's your only answer.

125
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:09,999
Violence.

126
00:10:13,436 --> 00:10:16,572
You're an unsafe parent.

127
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,008
You're a killer.

128
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:21,077
You can't pretend
that you're not.

129
00:10:26,516 --> 00:10:28,418
Excuse me, Doctor Roth.

130
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,926
Today's my day.

131
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:41,197
Why's your grandfather
throwing a party on my day?

132
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:44,901
I'm super hungry.
I didn't eat.

133
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,135
I was waiting for you.

134
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:48,304
You were?

135
00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:49,872
Yeah.

136
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:54,010
Okay. Let's go.

137
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,512
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

138
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,547
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

139
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:05,355
I don't need you buying stuff.

140
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:07,357
Come on. Open it.

141
00:11:20,203 --> 00:11:21,170
It's Mama.

142
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,908
I took that picture

143
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:28,411
with a film camera
my dad gave me.

144
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,948
Grandpa took
all of Mama's pictures down.

145
00:11:32,882 --> 00:11:35,318
Sometimes I forget
what she looks like.

146
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,221
She looks like you.

147
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:44,728
Dad, can I tell you something?

148
00:11:44,762 --> 00:11:45,962
Anything.

149
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:52,668
I'm mad at Mama.

150
00:11:53,837 --> 00:11:56,472
For dying and leaving us.

151
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:02,178
It's okay.

152
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:04,647
I hurt, too.

153
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,262
Matt will see you now.

154
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:28,971
He's throwing parties for her
during my visitation time.

155
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,008
Staring at me, laughing.

156
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,576
He's baiting you.

157
00:12:33,609 --> 00:12:35,311
Hoping you throw a punch.

158
00:12:35,779 --> 00:12:37,079
Nah.

159
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:39,081
Then he wins.

160
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:40,950
Opposing counsel

161
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:43,486
alleges you have
untreated PTSD

162
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,656
and brain trauma
from your military service,

163
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:48,458
making you
at-risk for violence.

164
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:52,796
I served Britain, the country
of my birth, for 22 years.

165
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,430
I'm the fuckin' bad guy
for it?

166
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,735
It gets worse.

167
00:12:59,803 --> 00:13:03,172
They're requesting
supervised visits

168
00:13:03,206 --> 00:13:06,542
and a reduction in visitation
from two hours a week

169
00:13:06,576 --> 00:13:08,344
to one hour every two.

170
00:13:08,377 --> 00:13:09,947
I have to fight this.

171
00:13:09,979 --> 00:13:11,949
I have ten grand saved up.

172
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:13,616
From sleeping
in your truck?

173
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:14,952
Court won't be thrilled

174
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:16,219
by your lack
of a fixed residence.

175
00:13:16,252 --> 00:13:17,453
Hey, I'll figure it out.

176
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:20,089
Why does Doctor Roth
hate you so much?

177
00:13:21,357 --> 00:13:23,559
He thinks
I killed his daughter.

178
00:13:23,593 --> 00:13:25,094
Did you?

179
00:13:26,128 --> 00:13:27,530
It was suicide.

180
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,735
I was overseas
on a deployment.

181
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:36,807
She battled depression
her whole life.

182
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,909
You've heard
of attrition warfare?

183
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,043
Yeah. You grind
the enemy down slowly.

184
00:13:41,077 --> 00:13:43,012
This guy's got a team

185
00:13:43,045 --> 00:13:45,248
of thousand-dollar-an-hour
attorneys

186
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:46,783
who will bleed you dry

187
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:49,385
until you turn to dust
and blow away.

188
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:52,088
The best we can do
is negotiated surrender.

189
00:13:52,856 --> 00:13:54,056
You have a daughter?

190
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,437
I got you guys
a little somethin'.

191
00:14:08,471 --> 00:14:09,572
Nina.

192
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:10,506
Jocelyn...

193
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,575
-Chantel. And Rubi.
-Thanks, Mama.

194
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:13,977
Dude, these are insane!

195
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:15,077
Where'd you get these?

196
00:14:15,111 --> 00:14:17,079
I have a cousin. Or seven.

197
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:18,815
<i>Salud</i> , bitches!

198
00:14:41,872 --> 00:14:43,072
Thank you.

199
00:15:02,525 --> 00:15:05,294
Shots.

200
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,260
Hey!

201
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:39,462
What? What? What?

202
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:40,897
What the fuck
are we still doing here?

203
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:42,431
He said he wants the One.

204
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,266
"I want the One.
I want the fucking One."

205
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,501
What the fuck does that mean?

206
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:47,370
He'll know it
when he sees her, okay?

207
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:48,805
Do you know
how much fuckin' money

208
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:49,940
we're gonna make on this?

209
00:15:49,973 --> 00:15:52,608
-We better.
-Enjoy, yeah?

210
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:08,157
Hey, last establishment.

211
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,625
You guys have early flights.

212
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:17,968
Is that back table open?

213
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:20,202
It's yours
if you tell me your name.

214
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:22,839
It's Jenny.

215
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:24,573
Hi, I'm Johnny.

216
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,375
Hi, Johnny.

217
00:16:28,712 --> 00:16:29,713
Right here.

218
00:16:43,026 --> 00:16:44,226
My man.

219
00:16:46,328 --> 00:16:47,898
You are more
than a pitch deck.

220
00:16:49,032 --> 00:16:51,101
Nina?

221
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:53,170
-Nina, don't throw up.
-I'm fine.

222
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:55,304
She's making her puke face.

223
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:57,673
-Let's get you to a bathroom.
-Oh, ew.

224
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,309
Cheap! Bad energy.

225
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,886
Ew!

226
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,922
Oh, my God.

227
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:14,725
I hate you so much right now,
it's not funny.

228
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:15,759
It's kinda funny.

229
00:17:19,196 --> 00:17:21,497
Oh, my God, I look mad busted.

230
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,499
I cannot go out there
like this.

231
00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:26,435
Okay, well, pick your battles,
'cause we're leavin' in 30.

232
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:48,692
Fuck!

233
00:17:55,098 --> 00:17:56,665
Go.

234
00:18:21,457 --> 00:18:22,658
Jenny's missing.

235
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:26,495
What do you mean, "missing"?

236
00:18:30,801 --> 00:18:32,803
She went out
with her friends on Friday.

237
00:18:34,603 --> 00:18:35,839
Saturday, we were worried,

238
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:38,374
so we called the cops,
and then on Sunday...

239
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:42,179
She had a piano recital
on Sunday night.

240
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:43,914
We invited half our family.

241
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:48,885
My cousin Dinora
is a Police Captain in Philly,

242
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,787
and she says
they don't work these cases.

243
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:53,389
They take a report
and forget about it.

244
00:18:54,024 --> 00:18:55,624
Can you help us?

245
00:18:55,658 --> 00:18:58,195
I can keep the site
running smoothly.

246
00:18:58,228 --> 00:18:59,328
No. Help us find Jen.

247
00:19:01,497 --> 00:19:02,933
My dad was a Green Beret.

248
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:06,335
I can see you guys
comin' a mile away.

249
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,872
You hunt bad guys.

250
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:11,407
You jump outta planes.

251
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,810
And you get those bad guys.

252
00:19:15,344 --> 00:19:17,047
I'm a different person now.

253
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:21,852
All right, well,

254
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,955
maybe this'll help her.

255
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:29,826
Here, it's 50.

256
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:31,427
Take it.

257
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,263
We have another 20
for expenses.

258
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:34,231
Come on, just take it, man.

259
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:35,799
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,571
It's not who I am anymore.

261
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:14,905
Gunny, it's me!

262
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:16,940
Don't kill me!

263
00:20:17,974 --> 00:20:20,176
I got steaks!

264
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,611
If you'd shot
a foot to the left,
I'd be dead.

265
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:25,715
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

266
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:30,987
You know, for me,

267
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,689
there's no separation
between day and night.

268
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:34,824
So, I got to make my own.

269
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,193
It's hard livin'
in a gray world.

270
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,864
I couldn't save your eyes.

271
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:42,198
Sorry.

272
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,633
That eats at me.

273
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,404
No.

274
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:49,471
You saved my life.

275
00:20:49,505 --> 00:20:50,974
Joyce would be burying tags
in the back yard

276
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:52,943
if you hadn't come along,
scooped me up and ran.

277
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,115
What's her name?

278
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,650
Jenny.

279
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,552
Jenny. All right.

280
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,855
She a good kid?

281
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,157
She's a great kid.

282
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,395
Now, you do this,
you better lock in.

283
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:15,265
You better go full on,
no half-measures.

284
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:18,634
But you do, God help 'em.

285
00:21:19,436 --> 00:21:21,137
I told Jenny I had her back.

286
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,840
Well, uh...

287
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,542
I miss ya.

288
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:30,046
I worry about ya,

289
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,351
but you didn't have
to come down here
and pretend that

290
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:36,219
you needed my permission
for something

291
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:37,586
you already
made your mind up about.

292
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:42,058
Get in here.
We're eating.

293
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,040
Hey, Carla.

294
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,074
Thanks for coming.

295
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,944
Where is he?

296
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,279
Upstairs.
First door on your left.

297
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,839
"Moonlight Sonata".

298
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:32,442
-Yeah.
-It's beautiful.

299
00:22:32,475 --> 00:22:34,477
She turned down
a music scholarship

300
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:35,812
to go to business school.

301
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,949
She wanted to be like her pops.

302
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:43,186
Be a big land developer.

303
00:22:44,521 --> 00:22:45,654
And she will.

304
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,157
Yeah.

305
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:52,561
Nah. No, thanks.

306
00:22:56,399 --> 00:22:57,934
Your family needs hope.

307
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,836
But I can't face 'em like this.

308
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:03,773
When my wife passed,

309
00:23:05,508 --> 00:23:07,744
and I left the Royal Marines,

310
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:09,746
a lot of people
would've given up on me.

311
00:23:11,448 --> 00:23:12,916
But you were patient with me.

312
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,787
-You, Carla, Jenny.
-Jenny.

313
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,991
You're my family.

314
00:23:39,175 --> 00:23:40,310
Look at me, brother.

315
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:44,380
I'm gonna bring her home.

316
00:23:48,418 --> 00:23:49,618
I promise.

317
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:51,855
I'm gonna bring her home.

318
00:24:18,581 --> 00:24:20,083
"Skip's Bar."

319
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,941
Thank you very much.
Good, bro?

320
00:24:48,211 --> 00:24:49,879
You good? Yeah?

321
00:24:52,515 --> 00:24:53,550
How you doing?

322
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:57,387
You need a little aperitif,
you know?

323
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,355
All right.

324
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:17,960
Oh, yo. Wrong house, kid.

325
00:27:17,994 --> 00:27:19,262
Get the fuck out.

326
00:27:19,295 --> 00:27:20,330
Hello, Johnny.

327
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,999
Wanna have a race?
See who wins?

328
00:27:26,903 --> 00:27:28,971
Hands up. Stand up.

329
00:27:29,005 --> 00:27:31,207
Place your fingers
behind your head.

330
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,342
You a cop?

331
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,609
You wish I was a cop.

332
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:37,547
Your adventure, kid.

333
00:27:49,392 --> 00:27:50,393
Where's the girl?

334
00:27:50,828 --> 00:27:52,395
What girl?

335
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:53,463
The missing girl.

336
00:27:56,366 --> 00:27:59,602
The one your friends snatched
outta the back of the bar.

337
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:02,773
I told the cops. She ran off.
Drunk or somethin'.

338
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,208
Fuckin' poobutt
can't hold her drink.

339
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,143
How's that my problem?

340
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:11,347
People lie.

341
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:12,582
Do you lie, Johnny?

342
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,585
I don't trust people.

343
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:17,553
I trust biology.

344
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:21,524
We're all wired the same.

345
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,394
Get the fuck up.

346
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,476
Fuck you.

347
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:43,613
Your mind
knows you're in the bathtub

348
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:46,149
and it's just a wet towel.

349
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:49,318
But adrenaline
makes your heart race,

350
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,120
so you burn more air.

351
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:54,123
Your nervous system tells you
that you're drowning.

352
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:56,526
Your bosses know you deal dope
over the bar top?

353
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,828
Steal from the till?

354
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,061
Fuck you!

355
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:18,114
You know these guys
are next level.

356
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:21,184
They wipe out
entire fucking bloodlines.

357
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:23,219
Fair enough.

358
00:29:23,252 --> 00:29:25,054
Just know
you're giving me names.

359
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:26,622
Your choice how.

360
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:29,158
Johnny?

361
00:29:30,794 --> 00:29:32,161
Where are you, brother?

362
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,766
You're expecting company?

363
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,401
Damn fuckin' right, I am.

364
00:29:40,771 --> 00:29:43,005
Open the door.
Fuckin' kill you.

365
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:05,194
Russians.

366
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:07,997
Fuck.

367
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,457
I'm sorry, Mom.

368
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,060
I'm sorry for...

369
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:42,733
shielding myself...

370
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:46,469
in a blanket
of accomplishments.

371
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:50,039
<i>I wish you could've seen me...</i>

372
00:30:50,874 --> 00:30:52,375
<i>who I really am.</i>

373
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,746
<i>Just want to be strong</i>
<i>like you.</i>

374
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:31,982
What am I doing here?

375
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,116
on speaker <i>It's better</i>
<i>you see for yourself, boss.</i>

376
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,586
<i>It's not a big problem.</i>

377
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:39,488
What the fuck
have you two done, huh?

378
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,699
Why'd they shoot each other?

379
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:52,101
This is very unprofessional.

380
00:31:52,134 --> 00:31:54,437
Johnny has no control.
He's a weak man.

381
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:57,106
Maybe he talk crazy,
and then it's bang-bang time.

382
00:31:57,139 --> 00:31:59,009
-"Bang-bang time"?
-Yeah.

383
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,410
Bang-bang time.

384
00:32:01,444 --> 00:32:03,646
You notice anything different?

385
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:05,916
Your hair.

386
00:32:05,949 --> 00:32:08,018
Idiot.

387
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,886
Where is my fucking money?

388
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,520
You think this was a robbery?

389
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:13,222
Impossible.

390
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:15,726
No one would rob us.
No one is that stupid,

391
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,960
or that crazy.

392
00:32:16,994 --> 00:32:18,829
This is a shotgun wound.

393
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,129
You see any shotguns?

394
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:22,164
-Hmm?
-That's nine bands missing.

395
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,969
Ninety thousand dollars
of our fucking money!

396
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,336
It's Symon's money.

397
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:14,350
Hey, sweetheart.

398
00:33:14,383 --> 00:33:16,153
<i>Hey, Daddy,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

399
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:18,688
Uh, nothin'. Just, uh...

400
00:33:19,321 --> 00:33:21,158
Just some work.

401
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,694
-Are you in school?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

402
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:26,395
You supposed to be
calling me from school?

403
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:27,630
<i>No.</i>

404
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,433
Everything okay?

405
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,936
<i>Yeah, I just wanted</i>
<i>to say, "hi." Love you, Daddy.</i>

406
00:33:33,737 --> 00:33:34,705
Love you, too.

407
00:33:34,738 --> 00:33:35,939
<i>Bye.</i>

408
00:33:42,344 --> 00:33:43,947
The fucking door opens itself?

409
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,106
I don't like this.

410
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,508
I'm alone in the bed
all night.

411
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:54,044
You eat.

412
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,980
You come to bed for a bit.

413
00:36:09,893 --> 00:36:11,795
You think the money
falls from the sky?

414
00:36:11,828 --> 00:36:14,630
Hmm?

415
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,082
Hope you don't mind.

416
00:37:09,485 --> 00:37:10,686
I was hungry.

417
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:15,591
Thought we could
have a little chat.

418
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,494
I'm gonna take the tape off.

419
00:37:21,298 --> 00:37:23,632
But if you can't
control your volume...

420
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,506
You go in the water.

421
00:37:33,009 --> 00:37:34,210
Do you know who I am?

422
00:37:34,978 --> 00:37:36,313
Should I?

423
00:37:36,346 --> 00:37:39,349
You clearly have no idea
who you fuck with.

424
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,152
Make yourself happy.
Tell me.

425
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:46,823
You have heard of us?

426
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,325
I have.

427
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:49,658
Really?

428
00:37:49,693 --> 00:37:50,827
The Vor.

429
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,697
The Bratva. The Brothers.

430
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,898
The League of Thieves.

431
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:56,900
Whatever Russian gangsters

432
00:37:56,933 --> 00:37:58,768
like to call themselves
these days.

433
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,071
You clearly are somebody.

434
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:04,207
You slaughter Vory soldiers.

435
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,142
You steal Vory money.

436
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:07,711
It was a misunderstanding.

437
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,611
I am a brother of high rank.

438
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,515
You and all connected
with you,

439
00:38:13,549 --> 00:38:15,617
will be hunted
for three generations.

440
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:17,821
Yep. I assumed so.

441
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:22,092
We all know
how these things play out

442
00:38:22,826 --> 00:38:24,160
if you don't keep them tidy.

443
00:38:24,194 --> 00:38:25,261
Fuck you!

444
00:38:27,663 --> 00:38:29,399
That's for slapping
that woman this morning.

445
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,368
That woman was my wife.

446
00:38:33,535 --> 00:38:34,904
That's for slapping your wife.

447
00:38:42,312 --> 00:38:43,279
Here's your money.

448
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,149
I'm not a thief.

449
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,287
I don't care
about your business.

450
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:52,989
I'm lookin' for a young lady.

451
00:38:59,062 --> 00:39:00,930
I... I don't understand.

452
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,532
The bar you do
your dirty business out of,

453
00:39:04,701 --> 00:39:06,668
a 19 year-old girl
was kidnapped.

454
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:09,739
I'm lookin' for her.

455
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:10,774
Dimi.

456
00:39:23,853 --> 00:39:25,288
Maybe you should
keep your voice down.

457
00:39:27,357 --> 00:39:28,958
What do you want?

458
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:30,527
Gimme the girl,

459
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:32,695
and everybody
goes about their business.

460
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:34,297
A girl?

461
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:37,233
All of this is for a girl?

462
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:42,305
No one kills three people
to sell a woman.

463
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,240
No one.

464
00:39:49,312 --> 00:39:50,780
I'm not selling her.

465
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:53,283
I'm gonna bring her home.

466
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:56,986
Not stopping until I do.

467
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:00,723
Who are you?

468
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,293
What are you?

469
00:40:05,128 --> 00:40:06,129
Fuck you.

470
00:40:07,263 --> 00:40:08,264
Fuck you.

471
00:40:09,966 --> 00:40:11,301
Fuck you!

472
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:12,702
Okay, we're done.

473
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:52,876
Dimi.

474
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,179
Who are you, Dimi?

475
00:41:32,148 --> 00:41:34,150
He takes money.

476
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,685
He leaves money.

477
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:38,421
He kills without fear.

478
00:41:39,355 --> 00:41:40,990
The question is why?

479
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:49,699
Wolo was
a respected man of honor,

480
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,070
but his son was never like us.

481
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,144
Dimi is not a businessman.

482
00:42:01,177 --> 00:42:05,081
He prefers mischief
over hard work.

483
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:11,087
He spits on his father's heart
every fucking day.

484
00:42:14,791 --> 00:42:15,892
Find this man.

485
00:42:20,763 --> 00:42:21,931
And bring him to me.

486
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:40,783
My name is Jenny Garcia.

487
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:42,720
My father is Joe.

488
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:44,654
My mother is Carla.

489
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,956
You have the wrong girl.
This is a mistake.

490
00:42:47,824 --> 00:42:50,960
They're not real.

491
00:42:53,396 --> 00:42:54,964
You're not real.

492
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:57,233
This...

493
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:00,403
is fucking real.

494
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,940
Eat your fuckin' food,

495
00:43:03,973 --> 00:43:05,675
then you put on
the fucking clothes

496
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,277
-and shut the fuck up!
-Fuck you!

497
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:12,382
Have you ever seen
someone die before?

498
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:13,416
Huh?

499
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:20,223
Their eyes
just cloud right over.

500
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:25,962
Mmm.
You're so fuckin' pretty. Huh?

501
00:43:26,963 --> 00:43:28,531
Aren't you, Princess?

502
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:30,933
Aw.

503
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:38,274
Boop.

504
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,447
Eat your fuckin' food!

505
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,159
<i>Believe the idea the</i>

506
00:43:56,192 --> 00:43:57,960
<i>White Sox are in serious talks</i>

507
00:43:57,994 --> 00:44:01,464
<i>to build a new stadium</i>
<i>in the South Loops, The 78,</i>

508
00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:04,600
<i>the location by</i>
<i>the Chicago River</i>
<i>just off Roosevelt.</i>

509
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:07,904
<i>I love the idea</i>
<i>of being in serious talks</i>

510
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,839
<i>for a new stadium</i>
<i>in the South Loop.</i>

511
00:44:19,549 --> 00:44:21,684
How's it goin', cat?
Getting rich contracting?

512
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:25,188
Oh, yeah.
Pouring concrete more like.

513
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:28,391
I'm outta the game.
I'm an honest taxpayer now.

514
00:44:28,424 --> 00:44:31,661
<i>You talked</i>
<i>to Gunny? How's he doing?</i>

515
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:34,397
<i>Saw him the other day.</i>
<i>He's happy.</i>

516
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,866
Well, you never call me unless
you need something,

517
00:44:36,899 --> 00:44:38,167
so, what do you want?

518
00:44:38,201 --> 00:44:40,503
Lookin' for someone
called Dimi.

519
00:44:40,536 --> 00:44:44,674
<i>Probably Dimitri.</i>
<i>An associate of</i>
Wolodymyr Kolisnyk.

520
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:46,442
<i>That's a high-ranking</i>
<i>dude, cat.</i>

521
00:44:46,909 --> 00:44:48,478
Mafia captain.

522
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,380
Legit Bratva shot caller.

523
00:44:51,681 --> 00:44:53,549
Not a guy you wanna fuck with.

524
00:44:53,583 --> 00:44:54,752
<i>Nah, never.</i>

525
00:44:54,785 --> 00:44:56,386
This Dimi fella,

526
00:44:56,419 --> 00:44:58,321
he might be involved
in human trafficking.

527
00:44:58,354 --> 00:45:01,991
<i>Can you check NADDIS and NCIC?</i>
<i>See if you can get a hit?</i>

528
00:45:02,024 --> 00:45:03,159
I gotta be careful,

529
00:45:03,192 --> 00:45:05,328
<i>but there's a bar</i>
<i>called Hattie's in Joliet,</i>

530
00:45:05,361 --> 00:45:07,230
<i>where they sell meth</i>
<i>for the Russians.</i>

531
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:08,832
Maybe you should
get a beer there.

532
00:45:08,866 --> 00:45:10,500
<i>Nice one. Thanks.</i>

533
00:45:41,964 --> 00:45:43,767
Hey. Whatcha havin'?

534
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:46,269
I'll just have a beer.
You pick.

535
00:45:46,804 --> 00:45:47,905
Okay.

536
00:46:09,158 --> 00:46:11,327
Oh, hey, stranger.
Where you been?

537
00:46:12,528 --> 00:46:13,697
Tryin' to make a buck.

538
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,465
You know,

539
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,268
rumor has it
you and your shitbag brother

540
00:46:19,302 --> 00:46:20,603
have been talkin'
to the Russians.

541
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:22,238
Rumor has it you were so high,

542
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:24,073
you accidentally killed
Big Mike in a trap house

543
00:46:24,106 --> 00:46:25,876
and blamed it
on a robbery crew.

544
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:27,376
Fuckin' shut up. Fuckin'...

545
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:29,679
Dutch finds out
anybody's talkin'
to the Russians but him,

546
00:46:29,713 --> 00:46:31,447
he's gonna lose
his fuckin' mind.

547
00:46:31,481 --> 00:46:32,982
Shh!

548
00:46:38,554 --> 00:46:39,589
Do you know this guy?

549
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:42,024
No. I've never seen him.

550
00:46:42,058 --> 00:46:43,626
I don't like him.

551
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:44,761
Looks like a cop.

552
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,298
He's got
a gun in his pocket.

553
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,501
Like a .38. You see it?

554
00:46:51,534 --> 00:46:52,769
Fuck. Yes.

555
00:46:52,803 --> 00:46:54,136
You're up, kid.

556
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:28,037
Follow me.

557
00:47:50,928 --> 00:47:52,128
Go talk to the man.

558
00:47:58,668 --> 00:47:59,770
You lookin' for somethin'?

559
00:47:59,803 --> 00:48:02,605
My interests are strictly
pharmaceutical, brother.

560
00:48:04,407 --> 00:48:06,409
Any reason
why you packin' heat, brah?

561
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,246
I'm carrying money.

562
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:12,615
Hate to lose it
to a man with a knife.

563
00:48:18,154 --> 00:48:19,555
He's a cop.

564
00:48:22,091 --> 00:48:23,326
Are you a cop?

565
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:25,829
Nah. Are you?

566
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,802
Run your pockets, Chief.

567
00:48:31,835 --> 00:48:33,770
Let's check for that badge.

568
00:48:33,804 --> 00:48:35,304
You heard the man.

569
00:48:35,338 --> 00:48:36,672
Put it on the table.

570
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,208
Fuckin' now.

571
00:48:39,241 --> 00:48:41,477
I didn't come here
to be disrespected.

572
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:00,897
All right.

573
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,501
Let's play.

574
00:49:06,602 --> 00:49:08,204
Get him.

575
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:36,800
Get him, brother.

576
00:50:05,996 --> 00:50:07,196
Bye, asshole.

577
00:50:08,031 --> 00:50:09,465
Enough!

578
00:50:21,544 --> 00:50:24,447
My grandpa told me to
never shake hands sittin'.

579
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,218
Look at those bricks.

580
00:50:29,251 --> 00:50:32,254
You ain't a cop,
you're a working man.

581
00:50:33,255 --> 00:50:35,058
Been in construction
my whole life.

582
00:50:35,092 --> 00:50:36,559
Were you a soldier?

583
00:50:36,592 --> 00:50:38,061
'Cause you fight
like a soldier.

584
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:39,628
I did my part.

585
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,430
I was Airborne.

586
00:50:41,464 --> 00:50:42,866
They trained us
to jump outta planes

587
00:50:42,899 --> 00:50:44,433
and we ended up
ridin' a bus into combat.

588
00:50:44,467 --> 00:50:46,970
Sounds about right.

589
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,004
Have a seat, brother.

590
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:54,577
I heard you're
in a buyin' mood.

591
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:56,813
I'm lookin' for blue glass,

592
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,280
the good stuff.

593
00:50:58,314 --> 00:51:00,349
I need weight. Regular.

594
00:51:00,984 --> 00:51:02,585
Like four pounds a month.

595
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:03,619
That's all?

596
00:51:04,253 --> 00:51:05,454
Who you flippin' it to?

597
00:51:05,488 --> 00:51:06,990
It goes where it's needed.

598
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:10,426
The customers
are my concern, not yours.

599
00:51:11,094 --> 00:51:14,097
And why here? Why us?

600
00:51:14,131 --> 00:51:16,332
My Chicago connect
is missin' in action.

601
00:51:17,266 --> 00:51:19,870
I'm runnin' work crews
in shifts 24/7.

602
00:51:20,737 --> 00:51:21,772
Time is money.

603
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:26,176
Seven K for half a pound.

604
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:27,711
That's a Chicago price.

605
00:51:28,677 --> 00:51:29,880
Five.

606
00:51:32,581 --> 00:51:34,450
There's a pancake house

607
00:51:34,483 --> 00:51:36,820
at the highway junction
straight north of here.

608
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:40,589
Be there, 7:00 a.m.,
having breakfast.

609
00:51:40,991 --> 00:51:42,291
And?

610
00:51:42,926 --> 00:51:44,293
And bring five stacks.

611
00:51:45,796 --> 00:51:47,463
Good talk.

612
00:51:47,496 --> 00:51:48,965
Now get the fuck outta here.

613
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:15,759
Have a seat.

614
00:52:24,633 --> 00:52:25,869
Mm.

615
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:29,338
This is like an awkward
Tinder date.

616
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:31,708
Just give her the money.

617
00:52:45,121 --> 00:52:47,423
Mmm. Lo, and behold.

618
00:52:49,326 --> 00:52:50,760
People talk,

619
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:53,864
money fucks.

620
00:53:04,673 --> 00:53:06,408
You got somethin' for me?

621
00:53:06,442 --> 00:53:09,045
We don't know
who the fuck you are, brother.

622
00:53:09,079 --> 00:53:11,413
You'll get a call tellin' you
where your shit is.

623
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:16,920
That's it?

624
00:53:18,955 --> 00:53:20,489
Yeah. Uh-huh.

625
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:30,901
Don't play me.

626
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:34,070
I know where to find you.

627
00:53:34,104 --> 00:53:36,873
Yeah. I guess you do.

628
00:53:38,241 --> 00:53:39,776
Thank you for not shooting me.

629
00:53:44,546 --> 00:53:46,649
fuckin' asshole.

630
00:53:54,257 --> 00:53:56,425
-Yeah?
<i>-All right. You ready?</i>

631
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:58,929
I'm gonna tell you where
the skante's at, big dog.

632
00:53:58,962 --> 00:53:59,930
<i>I'm waitin'.</i>

633
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,798
Under your seat.

634
00:54:13,575 --> 00:54:15,511
-Thank you.
-<i>Keep the burner phone.</i>

635
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:16,713
I'mma hit you tomorrow.

636
00:54:16,746 --> 00:54:18,214
Then you can tell me
how y'all motherfuckers

637
00:54:18,248 --> 00:54:20,283
built Rome
in a day off my shit.

638
00:54:20,317 --> 00:54:21,885
Then we can talk about weight.

639
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:58,221
Guess who's gonna be
princess for a night?

640
00:55:03,994 --> 00:55:07,931
You are Dimi's
miracle workers. Huh?

641
00:55:07,964 --> 00:55:10,934
And that,
that is for Dimi's miracle.

642
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:16,139
Why her?

643
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:19,909
She reminded me of a painting
in one of my father's houses.

644
00:55:21,643 --> 00:55:22,846
Take her in the back.

645
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,181
Sure.

646
00:56:04,954 --> 00:56:07,257
Look how cute these ones are.

647
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:09,325
They look like little sharks.

648
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:12,062
Just like you, cutie.

649
00:56:16,232 --> 00:56:17,534
She bit me!

650
00:56:19,903 --> 00:56:23,073
She's supposed to be asleep!

651
00:56:23,106 --> 00:56:24,307
I'm so sorry, sir.

652
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,542
I want her out!

653
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:55,271
Yeah?

654
00:56:55,305 --> 00:56:57,474
Did they like my shit?

655
00:56:57,507 --> 00:56:58,942
<i>Let's just say</i>
<i>they were pleased.</i>

656
00:57:00,076 --> 00:57:02,212
There's plenty more
where that came from,

657
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:03,813
but there's someone
you gotta check in with

658
00:57:03,847 --> 00:57:05,115
if we're gonna do business.

659
00:57:05,614 --> 00:57:07,350
What does that mean?

660
00:57:07,383 --> 00:57:09,018
Precautionary measures, brah.

661
00:57:09,052 --> 00:57:12,688
Seein' as the Feds
are handin' out
life sentences per pound.

662
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:14,591
Yeah, this game's not
for everyone.

663
00:57:14,623 --> 00:57:16,893
I hear you, big dog.

664
00:57:16,926 --> 00:57:19,696
I'mma shoot you
an invite for a sit-down.

665
00:57:19,729 --> 00:57:22,298
Bring your money
and wear a suit.

666
00:57:22,332 --> 00:57:23,733
I don't have a suit.

667
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:25,468
Shit. You will tomorrow.

668
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:28,338
'Cause these motherfuckers
are as high power as it gets.

669
00:57:36,613 --> 00:57:38,281
I'm here
to see someone called Dutch.

670
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,016
He's right this way.

671
00:57:50,093 --> 00:57:51,094
He's over there.

672
00:58:03,506 --> 00:58:05,008
-How you doin'?
-Hey, Dutch.

673
00:58:13,216 --> 00:58:14,450
You bring the money?

674
00:58:14,484 --> 00:58:15,818
May I?

675
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:25,428
First, you gotta turn
your phone off.

676
00:58:31,634 --> 00:58:32,835
Now what?

677
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:34,671
You already have my money.

678
00:58:34,704 --> 00:58:37,207
I came here in good faith
to do business.

679
00:58:45,215 --> 00:58:46,316
My name is Dimi.

680
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:50,720
Yours?

681
00:58:51,621 --> 00:58:52,822
Bill.

682
00:58:53,289 --> 00:58:54,757
Bill Coates.

683
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:57,460
Do you have driver's license,
Bill Coates?

684
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:11,674
Excuse me?

685
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:14,143
It's fine. Let him check.

686
00:59:17,447 --> 00:59:18,948
You drive rental.

687
00:59:20,483 --> 00:59:21,484
We check plates.

688
00:59:23,486 --> 00:59:24,887
Tax write-off.

689
00:59:26,656 --> 00:59:28,024
That okay?

690
00:59:32,161 --> 00:59:34,297
This man
is my business partner.

691
00:59:35,733 --> 00:59:37,200
He is small potatoes.

692
00:59:37,867 --> 00:59:40,837
I am the big potatoes.

693
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:44,407
Tell me.

694
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:47,243
Will you be a problem?

695
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:51,781
Is this how you do business?

696
00:59:52,815 --> 00:59:54,851
You invite me here
to be threatened?

697
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:02,191
Checks out.

698
01:00:05,696 --> 01:00:09,365
I apologize
for that, "William."

699
01:00:15,505 --> 01:00:17,173
You are clearly a...

700
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:20,009
serious person.

701
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:35,391
If you need resupply,
use the burner.

702
01:00:35,425 --> 01:00:36,993
Text bunny rabbit emoji.

703
01:00:39,429 --> 01:00:41,230
Bunny rabbit emoji.

704
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:44,033
You made aware
I need four pounds a month?

705
01:00:44,702 --> 01:00:45,968
Oh.

706
01:00:46,002 --> 01:00:49,038
Then text eggplant emoji.

707
01:00:53,643 --> 01:00:55,244
We are aware.

708
01:00:57,180 --> 01:00:59,015
If you like
what is in the case,

709
01:00:59,515 --> 01:01:00,850
we do more business.

710
01:01:01,819 --> 01:01:03,920
Now, you leave
and don't look back.

711
01:01:05,355 --> 01:01:06,622
Fine by me.

712
01:01:53,102 --> 01:01:55,571
Johnny, you're
a real piece of shit.

713
01:02:30,973 --> 01:02:33,342
You sneaky motherfucker.

714
01:02:42,285 --> 01:02:43,486
Hi, asshole.

715
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:48,958
Hmm.

716
01:02:55,465 --> 01:02:56,733
He's here.

717
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,071
-Oh, shit.
- -on speakers <i>He's in a black Dodge Ram</i>

718
01:03:02,104 --> 01:03:03,372
<i>hiding in the trees.</i>

719
01:03:03,406 --> 01:03:05,475
<i>Okay,</i>
<i>we're pulling up now.</i>

720
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:08,946
Let's go!

721
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,629
Fuck! He just fuckin' left
on a bike! Go!

722
01:03:29,198 --> 01:03:30,399
Go! Go! Go!

723
01:03:33,469 --> 01:03:34,738
Fuck!

724
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:04,761
Show me your hands.

725
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:08,865
Hey.

726
01:05:08,899 --> 01:05:10,199
You didn't see us here.

727
01:05:10,232 --> 01:05:12,134
Nothing fucking happened.

728
01:05:12,168 --> 01:05:14,103
We'll take it
from here.

729
01:05:14,136 --> 01:05:15,605
You're on the payroll too?

730
01:05:37,393 --> 01:05:38,628
How do you know Dimi?

731
01:05:39,963 --> 01:05:42,298
What is your business
with Dimi?

732
01:05:43,767 --> 01:05:45,334
Ah, you two assholes.

733
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:46,703
That man you drowned,

734
01:05:46,737 --> 01:05:49,505
in his own pool
while his wife was at Pilates,

735
01:05:50,874 --> 01:05:52,541
that man was our uncle.

736
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:53,576
He wouldn't shut up.

737
01:05:54,577 --> 01:05:55,478
I warned him.

738
01:05:55,511 --> 01:05:57,981
-Do you know who we are, hmm?
-Hey. Hey.

739
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,182
Yeah, people
whose ma dresses 'em funny.

740
01:06:00,216 --> 01:06:02,218
This is fucking couture, man.

741
01:06:02,953 --> 01:06:04,520
It's our fucking brand!

742
01:06:04,988 --> 01:06:06,723
Tie up his legs.

743
01:06:12,829 --> 01:06:15,866
If you want me to be scared,
you gotta try harder.

744
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,617
Whoa!

745
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:35,604
That is Vanko.

746
01:08:39,976 --> 01:08:41,410
And that is Danya.

747
01:08:47,117 --> 01:08:48,985
These are my sons.

748
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:51,788
My house and my lineage end

749
01:08:52,621 --> 01:08:56,592
on these cold, steel tables.

750
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:05,601
Convene the war counsel.

751
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,687
Excuse me, dear.

752
01:09:25,222 --> 01:09:26,455
Fuck off.

753
01:09:40,804 --> 01:09:41,905
Oh, wow.

754
01:09:41,938 --> 01:09:43,606
Absolutely fuckin' not.

755
01:09:50,914 --> 01:09:52,349
Oh, fuck.

756
01:09:53,415 --> 01:09:55,384
You're lucky
you're not already dead.

757
01:09:56,086 --> 01:09:58,454
Dimi, apologies, okay?

758
01:09:58,487 --> 01:09:59,823
I'm sorry.
I'm truly fuckin' sorry.

759
01:09:59,856 --> 01:10:02,125
She fucking bit
half his face off.

760
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:05,929
-It wasn't exactly
half his face. But...
-Oh.

761
01:10:05,962 --> 01:10:07,429
Thirty-six stitches.

762
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:08,564
That's a lot.

763
01:10:08,597 --> 01:10:10,566
To reattach his cheek.

764
01:10:11,935 --> 01:10:14,838
I am in the business
of pleasure, not surgery.

765
01:10:17,207 --> 01:10:18,474
Tell me...

766
01:10:23,445 --> 01:10:25,148
Fuck.

767
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:28,151
Do you know
what business means?

768
01:10:28,184 --> 01:10:30,353
Do I... No.
I mean, yeah. Fuck.

769
01:10:30,387 --> 01:10:32,421
Business means

770
01:10:32,454 --> 01:10:33,823
you keep your word.

771
01:10:33,857 --> 01:10:36,993
You deliver promises.
You make customer happy.

772
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:41,197
Not bite fucking face off!

773
01:10:42,265 --> 01:10:43,934
-Understood.
-No.

774
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,937
You just fucked me
out of 200 grand.

775
01:10:47,704 --> 01:10:50,472
If you make one, I make two.

776
01:10:55,946 --> 01:10:58,614
Customer wants her dead.
I want her dead.

777
01:10:58,647 --> 01:11:00,050
You kill her.
You know where to take her.

778
01:11:00,083 --> 01:11:01,217
Consider it done.

779
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,352
Now fuck off!

780
01:11:02,385 --> 01:11:03,585
Fucking off, sir.

781
01:11:05,322 --> 01:11:06,689
Holy shit, he was pissed.

782
01:11:06,723 --> 01:11:08,624
Fucking beyond.
He was this close
to smokin' us both.

783
01:11:08,657 --> 01:11:09,726
We gotta whack that girl.

784
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:12,028
Fine by me.
Let's do the little bitch.

785
01:11:16,299 --> 01:11:18,168
We are facing a devil.

786
01:11:20,704 --> 01:11:23,472
This devil kills two soldiers.

787
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,042
He drowns Wolodymyr,

788
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:27,609
an esteemed captain.

789
01:11:28,178 --> 01:11:30,780
Now he kills my sons.

790
01:11:30,814 --> 01:11:33,750
You do understand my concern?

791
01:11:35,085 --> 01:11:36,052
Where is Dimi?

792
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,189
Won't he know
who this devil is?

793
01:11:40,123 --> 01:11:41,257
Dimi's hiding.

794
01:11:50,734 --> 01:11:52,501
They will help you find Dimi.

795
01:11:53,535 --> 01:11:56,139
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

796
01:11:57,407 --> 01:11:58,708
Now go.

797
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:05,075
Some champagne?

798
01:13:20,490 --> 01:13:22,225
Your father is dead.

799
01:13:24,461 --> 01:13:26,129
Tied to a chair

800
01:13:26,162 --> 01:13:28,298
and drowned in his pool.

801
01:13:28,331 --> 01:13:30,100
So, it's good news.

802
01:13:30,767 --> 01:13:32,469
The man who killed him

803
01:13:32,502 --> 01:13:34,170
murdered my sons.

804
01:13:37,673 --> 01:13:39,075
Danya and Vanko?

805
01:13:40,577 --> 01:13:41,945
What the fuck?

806
01:13:43,513 --> 01:13:45,748
You did not know this?

807
01:13:45,782 --> 01:13:48,885
How the fuck would I know?
Nobody tells me anything.

808
01:13:49,953 --> 01:13:52,789
The Brotherhood treats me
like I'm radioactive.

809
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:00,629
Who is this man?

810
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:08,138
I ask with kindness.

811
01:14:14,277 --> 01:14:16,746
I bankroll biker gang
with meth connection.

812
01:14:16,779 --> 01:14:19,415
They introduce me to buyer
with real cash.

813
01:14:19,449 --> 01:14:21,284
We met for five minutes.

814
01:14:21,317 --> 01:14:22,318
That's it.

815
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,122
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

816
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:28,791
I have this.

817
01:14:32,762 --> 01:14:34,898
He's hunting you.

818
01:14:59,355 --> 01:15:00,323
Found him.

819
01:15:06,996 --> 01:15:08,364
Oh.

820
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:37,293
-Hello?
<i>-Hi. Mr. Cade?</i>

821
01:15:37,327 --> 01:15:39,162
<i>This is the Main Office.</i>

822
01:15:39,195 --> 01:15:42,700
<i>Um, no one's come to pick up</i>
<i>Meredith today.</i>

823
01:15:42,732 --> 01:15:43,900
I'll be right there.

824
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,182
-Hey.
-Good day?

825
01:15:59,215 --> 01:16:00,850
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

826
01:16:05,622 --> 01:16:07,457
Where's Grandpa?
He's never late.

827
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:09,092
He's not answering me.

828
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,394
I sent him, like, 20 messages.

829
01:16:11,427 --> 01:16:12,428
I'm sure he's fine.

830
01:16:13,863 --> 01:16:15,431
You didn't kill him, did you?

831
01:16:16,799 --> 01:16:18,101
Dad, I'm kidding.

832
01:16:23,339 --> 01:16:24,474
Do you trust me?

833
01:16:24,507 --> 01:16:25,942
Yeah.

834
01:16:26,576 --> 01:16:27,844
So, if I tell you something,

835
01:16:27,877 --> 01:16:29,145
you know
you can believe me, right?

836
01:16:29,178 --> 01:16:31,981
Okay, the build-up
is just making it worse.

837
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:34,517
I made a big mistake.

838
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,952
Oh, my God.
You did kill Grandpa.

839
01:16:35,985 --> 01:16:37,620
Merry, I'm serious.

840
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:38,921
Some really bad people
are after me,

841
01:16:38,955 --> 01:16:41,090
and I don't want anyone
I love to get hurt.

842
01:16:42,091 --> 01:16:44,360
Are you sharing your location
with Grandpa?

843
01:16:44,394 --> 01:16:45,895
Yeah.

844
01:16:45,928 --> 01:16:47,630
Can you see his location?

845
01:16:47,664 --> 01:16:49,198
Maybe, I don't know.

846
01:16:52,568 --> 01:16:53,836
Daddy, he's at home.

847
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:16,993
Merry, stay here, okay?

848
01:17:19,929 --> 01:17:21,497
Merry! Stay there!

849
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:23,333
Daddy, be careful!

850
01:18:06,142 --> 01:18:07,977
Who were they?

851
01:18:08,712 --> 01:18:10,046
Russian mafia?

852
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:12,482
Yes.

853
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:16,185
They were looking for you.

854
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:20,890
This happened because of you.

855
01:18:22,024 --> 01:18:25,128
Violence follows you
like a cloud.

856
01:18:26,362 --> 01:18:28,431
He could've left you
in there, Grandpa.

857
01:18:28,464 --> 01:18:30,199
He saved your life.

858
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:34,103
I can acknowledge that.

859
01:18:37,206 --> 01:18:38,641
You should go to the hospital.

860
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:41,077
You'll be safe there.

861
01:18:41,677 --> 01:18:42,846
I'll take care of Merry.

862
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:45,681
It's time
o let the cops
handle this.

863
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,317
Cops can't stop them.

864
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:51,889
All right.

865
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:53,423
We'll figure it out later.

866
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:55,625
And, Levon,

867
01:18:56,592 --> 01:18:57,761
thank you.

868
01:19:13,609 --> 01:19:15,011
You remember Gunny?

869
01:19:15,044 --> 01:19:17,547
Your blind friend
who doesn't know he's blind?

870
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:18,882
That's the one.

871
01:19:18,916 --> 01:19:20,383
He has a country house.

872
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:22,685
We'll be safe there
till the storm passes.

873
01:19:35,565 --> 01:19:36,566
Hi.

874
01:19:37,801 --> 01:19:39,569
You wanna come inside?
Come on.

875
01:19:39,602 --> 01:19:41,571
-You hungry?
-Always.

876
01:19:41,604 --> 01:19:43,105
-And you?
-Yeah.

877
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,074
What happened, man?

878
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:47,243
You fuck with
the wrong people, huh?

879
01:19:47,276 --> 01:19:48,344
Hey, you could've stopped me.

880
01:19:48,377 --> 01:19:51,247
What force on earth
is gonna stop you?

881
01:19:52,648 --> 01:19:55,184
It's gettin' ugly.

882
01:19:55,218 --> 01:19:58,454
Can you find this girl?
Can you really find this girl?

883
01:19:58,488 --> 01:19:59,522
I can find her.

884
01:20:00,156 --> 01:20:01,557
I'm gonna bring her home.

885
01:20:02,291 --> 01:20:04,126
I hear that. You got a plan?

886
01:20:06,596 --> 01:20:09,098
I'm gonna ask this Dimi fella
where she is.

887
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:12,936
All roads lead to him.

888
01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:14,504
Now, you killed
your way into this,

889
01:20:14,537 --> 01:20:16,606
you're gonna have to kill
your way out of it.

890
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,942
I figured as much.

891
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,010
I can help you with that.

892
01:20:21,043 --> 01:20:22,545
Oh, yeah?

893
01:20:22,578 --> 01:20:24,146
Let me show you somethin'.

894
01:20:30,152 --> 01:20:31,387
After you, sir.

895
01:20:33,089 --> 01:20:35,658
All right, I will be
your weapons sommelier

896
01:20:35,691 --> 01:20:37,293
for this evening.

897
01:20:37,326 --> 01:20:38,394
If you come around this wall,

898
01:20:38,427 --> 01:20:40,530
you see
the Avtomat Kalashnikov,

899
01:20:40,563 --> 01:20:43,366
been killing Americans
since 1947.

900
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:46,904
Also, comes in a deluxe,
blingy version pulled direct

901
01:20:46,937 --> 01:20:48,471
from Saddam's palace.

902
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:50,606
What you got over here
is the M-Four Carbine,

903
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,076
it's the Chevy Impala
of the war on terror.

904
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,847
Beautiful MP5 SD here
if you wanna kill somebody,

905
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,215
but you don't wanna
wake 'em up.

906
01:20:59,248 --> 01:21:01,684
But this is
the real beast here.

907
01:21:01,718 --> 01:21:02,920
One of the original weapons of

908
01:21:02,953 --> 01:21:04,487
the four horsemen
of the apocalypse.

909
01:21:06,556 --> 01:21:07,623
The M14.

910
01:21:10,092 --> 01:21:11,762
You might remember this weapon.

911
01:21:11,795 --> 01:21:13,529
I don't want to, but I do.

912
01:21:14,463 --> 01:21:15,565
There you go.

913
01:21:24,607 --> 01:21:26,743
I'll have to drill out
the serial numbers.

914
01:21:26,777 --> 01:21:28,110
Oh, no, that's already done.

915
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:31,614
These were never here.
Never anywhere.

916
01:21:32,849 --> 01:21:34,051
Kinda like us,

917
01:21:35,052 --> 01:21:36,218
back in the day.

918
01:21:36,252 --> 01:21:38,454
We did some
righteous shit, brother.

919
01:21:40,891 --> 01:21:42,124
Yeah, we did.

920
01:21:47,597 --> 01:21:49,565
-What's in there?
-None of your business.

921
01:21:52,035 --> 01:21:53,202
Can I come?

922
01:21:53,937 --> 01:21:55,538
Absolutely not.

923
01:21:55,571 --> 01:21:57,306
What about school?

924
01:21:57,340 --> 01:21:59,743
You'll miss
a couple of days, at most.

925
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,184
I barely see you.

926
01:22:08,217 --> 01:22:09,987
I don't want you
getting in trouble.

927
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:11,088
Then I'll never see you.

928
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,723
That's not gonna happen.

929
01:22:13,924 --> 01:22:16,626
See this? This is you.

930
01:22:17,627 --> 01:22:18,628
Half and half.

931
01:22:20,831 --> 01:22:21,832
I want you to hold onto this.

932
01:22:23,366 --> 01:22:24,600
I'm comin' back for that.

933
01:22:26,636 --> 01:22:27,738
Okay.

934
01:22:30,774 --> 01:22:31,975
I love you.

935
01:22:32,009 --> 01:22:33,043
Love you, Daddy.

936
01:22:37,313 --> 01:22:38,681
Daddy, I don't want you
getting hurt.

937
01:22:39,315 --> 01:22:41,617
I'll be back soon, okay?

938
01:22:42,351 --> 01:22:43,820
Gunny, take good care of her.

939
01:22:43,854 --> 01:22:45,221
Yeah, of course.

940
01:22:45,254 --> 01:22:46,422
-Thank you, Joyce.
-This way.

941
01:22:46,455 --> 01:22:47,824
-Bye, Levon.
-All right, sweetheart.

942
01:23:13,016 --> 01:23:14,250
"Our Father,

943
01:23:15,152 --> 01:23:16,385
who art in heaven,

944
01:23:16,987 --> 01:23:18,320
hallowed be thy name,

945
01:23:19,655 --> 01:23:20,656
thy kingdom come,

946
01:23:21,223 --> 01:23:22,425
thy will be done."

947
01:23:23,026 --> 01:23:24,928
God ain't here, sweetheart.

948
01:23:24,961 --> 01:23:28,031
Have a nice nap, Princess?

949
01:23:28,065 --> 01:23:29,331
We gotta pull over
and load this bitch

950
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:31,034
with some
fuckin' sleeping pills...

951
01:23:31,068 --> 01:23:32,468
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

952
01:23:32,501 --> 01:23:34,104
-Fucking bitch!
-Hey, take it easy!

953
01:23:34,137 --> 01:23:35,571
-Pull over!
-Come on! Stop!

954
01:23:35,604 --> 01:23:36,840
Fucking get it, fucking bitch.

955
01:23:36,873 --> 01:23:37,974
Fucking grab that bitch!

956
01:23:38,008 --> 01:23:40,509
Pull over!
Pull over! Pull over!

957
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:49,585
God damn it!
Where's my fucking gun!

958
01:23:49,618 --> 01:23:51,188
Fuck!

959
01:23:53,957 --> 01:23:55,424
Fuck.

960
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:06,635
Fuckin' move, Viper!

961
01:24:39,069 --> 01:24:41,604
Fuck! Fuck!

962
01:24:46,176 --> 01:24:48,011
I mean, what the fuck?

963
01:24:48,812 --> 01:24:49,980
She is fast.

964
01:24:50,747 --> 01:24:52,916
We're going back
to fuckin' prison!

965
01:24:52,949 --> 01:24:54,316
Huh?

966
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,052
Huh? You get it?

967
01:24:56,086 --> 01:24:57,921
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

968
01:24:59,388 --> 01:25:00,824
Fuck! Okay, okay.

969
01:25:00,857 --> 01:25:02,926
Fuck! Fuck!

970
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:06,863
Shit.

971
01:25:20,944 --> 01:25:21,978
Okay, genius,

972
01:25:23,213 --> 01:25:24,446
now what?

973
01:25:45,035 --> 01:25:46,036
Are you all right?

974
01:25:48,839 --> 01:25:50,841
My name is Jenny Garcia.
I was kidnapped.

975
01:25:50,874 --> 01:25:52,876
It's all right.
We know who you are.

976
01:25:52,909 --> 01:25:53,910
Let's get you home.

977
01:25:55,078 --> 01:25:56,345
Okay.

978
01:26:22,339 --> 01:26:23,740
I'm so fucking sorry.

979
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:30,914
Miss me?

980
01:26:31,948 --> 01:26:32,983
Fuck!

981
01:26:36,518 --> 01:26:38,487
Fucking dome the bitch!

982
01:26:41,958 --> 01:26:44,060
-You gotta be kidding me.
-Is that him?

983
01:26:44,094 --> 01:26:45,695
What the fuck?

984
01:26:46,428 --> 01:26:47,630
Fuck, it's a video call.

985
01:26:47,663 --> 01:26:49,465
Here, take the fucking phone!
Give me the...

986
01:26:49,498 --> 01:26:52,035
-Fuck!
-...God damn fucking gun.

987
01:26:52,769 --> 01:26:53,669
Hey, sir.

988
01:26:53,703 --> 01:26:55,972
<i>Dimi says you still</i>
<i>have the girl.</i>

989
01:26:56,006 --> 01:26:57,941
Uh, yeah, yeah.
We still got her.

990
01:26:59,009 --> 01:27:00,509
<i>Show me she's still alive.</i>

991
01:27:06,415 --> 01:27:07,817
See? Still alive.

992
01:27:09,786 --> 01:27:13,223
<i>I want a second date tonight,</i>
<i>at the farmhouse.</i>

993
01:27:13,256 --> 01:27:14,824
<i>One million dollars.</i>

994
01:27:14,858 --> 01:27:17,027
Uh, yeah.
Whatever you want, sir.

995
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:19,195
I'll get her cleaned up
and smelling
real pretty for you.

996
01:27:19,229 --> 01:27:21,698
<i>No, no, no. I want her dirty.</i>

997
01:27:22,198 --> 01:27:23,199
<i>Not sleepy,</i>

998
01:27:24,134 --> 01:27:26,468
<i>but dirty and alive.</i>

999
01:27:27,436 --> 01:27:29,039
<i>For now.</i>

1000
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,077
-Fuck, yeah.
-Oh, yes.

1001
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,412
Which passport, okay?

1002
01:27:35,444 --> 01:27:37,280
You sent me
all these passports.

1003
01:27:37,314 --> 01:27:39,481
I can't tell.
Red? Blue? Green?

1004
01:27:41,251 --> 01:27:42,352
-I don't know what color, just tell me.
- -Where are we going?

1005
01:27:42,385 --> 01:27:45,255
What? Okay. Yeah. Go.

1006
01:27:45,288 --> 01:27:46,823
I take all of them, okay?

1007
01:27:48,124 --> 01:27:50,427
-What do you want?
You want money?
-No, I don't...

1008
01:27:50,459 --> 01:27:51,493
Here, take your money.
You take money.

1009
01:27:51,527 --> 01:27:52,661
I don't want
your fucking money!

1010
01:27:52,696 --> 01:27:53,964
-You take all the money.
-I don't want

1011
01:27:53,997 --> 01:27:55,531
-your fucking money!
-You take all the money, okay?

1012
01:27:55,564 --> 01:27:58,068
-Let me help you!
-No, no, I don't need help.

1013
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:01,171
Fuck.

1014
01:28:01,204 --> 01:28:03,340
Get away! Stop!

1015
01:28:03,373 --> 01:28:05,041
Starting tomorrow, rehab.

1016
01:28:05,075 --> 01:28:09,346
All you do is let me slip down
slippery slope.

1017
01:28:11,414 --> 01:28:12,849
You're supposed
to be my rock.

1018
01:28:12,882 --> 01:28:14,784
You know, like they say,
"Oh, she's my rock."

1019
01:28:14,818 --> 01:28:16,485
"Hey, thank you."
I have nothing
to thank you for.

1020
01:28:27,831 --> 01:28:30,467
You know
what? You are just an enabler.

1021
01:28:35,071 --> 01:28:37,207
he's here!

1022
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:08,104
Okay.

1023
01:29:08,138 --> 01:29:10,507
Okay. You made your point.

1024
01:29:10,539 --> 01:29:11,875
Now we make
a deal, and you begin

1025
01:29:11,908 --> 01:29:13,642
a new life as
a wealthy man, huh?

1026
01:29:13,675 --> 01:29:15,712
I can pay my own bills.

1027
01:29:16,346 --> 01:29:17,781
Congrats.

1028
01:29:17,814 --> 01:29:20,150
-Come closer and she dies.
-No!

1029
01:29:20,183 --> 01:29:21,317
I figured that.

1030
01:29:24,788 --> 01:29:27,390
You should disappear.
Take the money.

1031
01:29:28,624 --> 01:29:29,859
Make a nice life.

1032
01:29:43,206 --> 01:29:44,174
Where is she?

1033
01:29:48,677 --> 01:29:50,180
I do not know this woman.

1034
01:29:51,381 --> 01:29:52,849
You're a bad liar.

1035
01:29:53,483 --> 01:29:55,151
Why risk everything?

1036
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,789
Why kill everyone for her?

1037
01:29:59,823 --> 01:30:01,657
'Cause I told her
I had her back.

1038
01:30:07,697 --> 01:30:09,265
If I give you this woman,

1039
01:30:11,267 --> 01:30:12,268
you let me live?

1040
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:15,205
Because if I just give you
the address,

1041
01:30:16,773 --> 01:30:18,708
then you shoot me, huh?

1042
01:30:18,741 --> 01:30:21,911
What if you give me
a fake address
and I shoot you?

1043
01:30:22,644 --> 01:30:24,280
That's bad for both of us.

1044
01:30:31,187 --> 01:30:33,590
Head south on 57.

1045
01:30:33,622 --> 01:30:35,225
Then I give you her address.

1046
01:30:37,227 --> 01:30:38,228
Let's go.

1047
01:30:39,529 --> 01:30:41,264
You know this guy?

1048
01:30:41,297 --> 01:30:44,067
Of course, I know. He's Viper.

1049
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,703
He's Chief of
Human Resource Department

1050
01:30:46,736 --> 01:30:49,772
and recruiting
for special projects.

1051
01:30:49,806 --> 01:30:52,041
Why you do all this
for a whore?

1052
01:30:57,080 --> 01:30:58,081
Say it again.

1053
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,250
Please, say that again.

1054
01:31:02,452 --> 01:31:03,753
Thought so.

1055
01:31:04,254 --> 01:31:05,255
Okay, Dimi,

1056
01:31:05,855 --> 01:31:07,257
tell me where we're going.

1057
01:31:08,458 --> 01:31:09,759
Where is she?

1058
01:31:12,095 --> 01:31:13,396
There.

1059
01:31:35,752 --> 01:31:37,020
She's in there?

1060
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:38,955
She's there.

1061
01:31:38,988 --> 01:31:41,224
Promise?

1062
01:31:41,624 --> 01:31:42,926
I promise.

1063
01:31:43,326 --> 01:31:44,327
She's there.

1064
01:32:00,577 --> 01:32:01,811
Why her?

1065
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:05,248
Who decides?

1066
01:32:09,519 --> 01:32:11,354
Viper goes to club,

1067
01:32:11,387 --> 01:32:13,823
takes pictures of pretty girls.

1068
01:32:13,856 --> 01:32:16,359
I send them to clients,
they make choice.

1069
01:32:17,594 --> 01:32:19,028
Meeting is arranged.

1070
01:32:20,129 --> 01:32:23,199
This is my specialty service.

1071
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:25,735
Like shopping for
a set of snow tires.

1072
01:32:29,906 --> 01:32:31,441
These are human beings.

1073
01:32:35,878 --> 01:32:37,347
You think money gives a shit

1074
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,748
where it comes from?

1075
01:32:40,383 --> 01:32:41,484
If I didn't do this,

1076
01:32:41,517 --> 01:32:42,952
somebody else would.

1077
01:32:44,020 --> 01:32:45,922
You still haven't told me why.

1078
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:48,758
Why do you hunt us?

1079
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:50,460
You have a daughter?

1080
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:52,929
No.

1081
01:32:52,962 --> 01:32:54,897
Then you won't understand.

1082
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:36,165
Hey, good lookin' out.

1083
01:34:37,166 --> 01:34:39,302
Hey, yo, we good, brother?

1084
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:42,305
Man, we far from good.

1085
01:34:42,338 --> 01:34:44,374
That motherfucker
we hooked up with Dimi

1086
01:34:44,407 --> 01:34:47,110
clapped out half
a dozen Russians tonight.

1087
01:34:47,143 --> 01:34:49,879
Rumor is, he's on his way to
Dimi's trap house right now.

1088
01:34:53,216 --> 01:34:54,283
Everybody,

1089
01:34:54,317 --> 01:34:55,853
mount the fuck up!

1090
01:34:55,918 --> 01:34:57,520
You heard the man.
Mount up!

1091
01:35:56,145 --> 01:35:57,547
That's funny shit.

1092
01:36:14,765 --> 01:36:17,133
Sounds lovely, Princess.

1093
01:36:31,247 --> 01:36:33,282
I don't condone this behavior,

1094
01:36:33,884 --> 01:36:35,451
but my bank account does.

1095
01:36:38,722 --> 01:36:40,122
Hey. It's time.

1096
01:36:40,156 --> 01:36:41,792
What the fuck
are we still doing here?
Come on.

1097
01:36:41,825 --> 01:36:43,159
Yeah. I'll get the pervert.

1098
01:36:44,694 --> 01:36:47,196
We're all just numbers, kid.
Nothin' personal.

1099
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:49,565
Feels pretty fuckin'
personal to me.

1100
01:37:05,782 --> 01:37:07,583
We have to go now, sir.

1101
01:37:07,617 --> 01:37:08,618
Why?

1102
01:37:09,619 --> 01:37:10,686
It's now or never.

1103
01:37:11,722 --> 01:37:12,756
Then it's now.

1104
01:37:46,656 --> 01:37:48,324
What have I done to you?

1105
01:37:49,927 --> 01:37:51,527
Nothing.

1106
01:37:51,561 --> 01:37:52,696
That's the best part.

1107
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:02,438
I wonder
what you look like on...

1108
01:38:02,471 --> 01:38:03,740
the inside.

1109
01:38:19,655 --> 01:38:21,390
The fuck was that?

1110
01:38:21,424 --> 01:38:22,625
whoa.

1111
01:38:48,752 --> 01:38:49,753
Levon!

1112
01:38:50,586 --> 01:38:52,521
Are they fucking shooting?

1113
01:38:52,555 --> 01:38:54,557
Who's gonna
get fucked now, huh?

1114
01:39:12,075 --> 01:39:13,376
He's in there.

1115
01:39:13,409 --> 01:39:15,244
Shooting the place up.

1116
01:39:17,714 --> 01:39:18,915
Everybody,

1117
01:39:19,515 --> 01:39:20,449
lock and load.

1118
01:39:20,483 --> 01:39:22,685
Let's go get this motherfucker.

1119
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:24,087
Yeah, you two on me.

1120
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:25,421
You heard the man. Come on.

1121
01:39:25,454 --> 01:39:27,423
Stay tight, stay right.

1122
01:39:27,456 --> 01:39:30,093
Demon, put it through
the glass.

1123
01:39:30,127 --> 01:39:31,227
You got it.

1124
01:40:04,193 --> 01:40:05,361
Levon!

1125
01:40:05,394 --> 01:40:07,798
Shut the fuck up!

1126
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:09,331
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

1127
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:11,702
Yeah?

1128
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:14,370
You just... Yeah.

1129
01:40:14,403 --> 01:40:15,604
I'm beginning to think

1130
01:40:15,638 --> 01:40:18,008
that you do not know
what you are doing!

1131
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:19,208
Don't worry, sir.

1132
01:40:19,241 --> 01:40:20,676
Everything's under control.

1133
01:40:20,711 --> 01:40:21,745
I promise you.

1134
01:40:30,887 --> 01:40:32,254
I'm gonna cut your heart out.

1135
01:40:32,288 --> 01:40:33,489
Good luck.

1136
01:41:04,755 --> 01:41:06,790
What the fuck
is your real name?

1137
01:41:06,823 --> 01:41:08,390
Levon.

1138
01:41:08,424 --> 01:41:09,860
Nice to meet you, Levon.

1139
01:41:10,861 --> 01:41:11,995
You ready, son?

1140
01:41:12,028 --> 01:41:12,996
I'm always ready.

1141
01:41:20,603 --> 01:41:22,139
My fight wasn't with you.

1142
01:41:22,172 --> 01:41:23,472
I know, brother.

1143
01:41:24,207 --> 01:41:25,407
Finish it.

1144
01:41:47,230 --> 01:41:48,430
Sorry, brother.

1145
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,719
-Levon!
-What the fuck?

1146
01:42:17,127 --> 01:42:18,728
How dare you come in here?

1147
01:42:20,596 --> 01:42:22,331
-Fuck! Shit!
-Oh, fuck!

1148
01:42:22,364 --> 01:42:23,867
Oh, that is not good.

1149
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:29,505
What the fuck?

1150
01:42:30,207 --> 01:42:31,340
-Hang on.
-Reload!

1151
01:42:31,373 --> 01:42:32,843
wait, wait, wait.

1152
01:42:32,876 --> 01:42:33,777
No, no, no!

1153
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,045
-I can explain everything!
-Fuck!

1154
01:42:35,078 --> 01:42:36,345
No!

1155
01:42:48,758 --> 01:42:49,658
Oh, shit.

1156
01:42:55,765 --> 01:42:57,433
Mommy!

1157
01:42:57,466 --> 01:42:59,236
Fuck!

1158
01:42:59,269 --> 01:43:00,804
Fuck!

1159
01:43:00,837 --> 01:43:01,738
Fuckin' bitch!

1160
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:03,439
Fuck.

1161
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:05,407
Fuck you!

1162
01:43:12,381 --> 01:43:13,917
It's over now.

1163
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,055
Fucking die, bitch!

1164
01:43:50,253 --> 01:43:51,520
I think I killed her.

1165
01:43:53,123 --> 01:43:54,124
Good.

1166
01:44:01,765 --> 01:44:02,799
Fuck.

1167
01:44:02,832 --> 01:44:03,767
Whoa.

1168
01:44:04,834 --> 01:44:06,236
Stay on my six.

1169
01:44:06,269 --> 01:44:07,469
What's that mean?

1170
01:44:07,971 --> 01:44:09,039
Follow me.

1171
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:23,552
There's an active shooter
in there.

1172
01:44:45,408 --> 01:44:47,143
Shit.

1173
01:44:54,117 --> 01:44:55,385
Let's kill this guy.

1174
01:45:12,568 --> 01:45:13,837
What was that?

1175
01:45:13,870 --> 01:45:14,871
Bluetooth.

1176
01:45:17,974 --> 01:45:19,409
Is that a grenade?

1177
01:45:19,442 --> 01:45:20,744
Mind your ears.

1178
01:45:29,219 --> 01:45:30,220
Oh.

1179
01:45:34,324 --> 01:45:35,358
You ready?

1180
01:45:35,392 --> 01:45:36,926
No.

1181
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:37,961
Time to go.

1182
01:45:51,141 --> 01:45:52,574
See you on the other side.

1183
01:45:56,413 --> 01:45:57,480
What was that?

1184
01:45:57,514 --> 01:45:59,049
Respect for an old friend.

1185
01:46:26,575 --> 01:46:27,710
You ready to go home?

1186
01:46:27,744 --> 01:46:29,746
Get me the hell outta here.

1187
01:46:51,568 --> 01:46:53,069
Yes, my brother.

1188
01:46:53,103 --> 01:46:54,304
He escaped...

1189
01:46:55,338 --> 01:46:56,739
with the girl.

1190
01:46:56,773 --> 01:46:58,274
<i>None of this was business.</i>

1191
01:46:59,442 --> 01:47:01,711
The devil has what he came for.

1192
01:47:03,346 --> 01:47:05,315
Let him go.

1193
01:47:05,348 --> 01:47:09,586
I understand our need
to move quietly in the world.

1194
01:47:09,618 --> 01:47:12,522
<i>But I will not turn</i>
<i>the other cheek</i>

1195
01:47:12,555 --> 01:47:16,392
to the man
who killed my children.

1196
01:47:16,426 --> 01:47:19,062
Then we will kill you.

1197
01:47:19,095 --> 01:47:22,664
The Brotherhood comes before
your personal vengeance.

1198
01:47:23,833 --> 01:47:25,401
Do you understand?

1199
01:47:25,435 --> 01:47:26,769
I understand.

1200
01:47:44,120 --> 01:47:45,021
Hey...

1201
01:47:46,623 --> 01:47:48,657
snitches get stitches.

1202
01:48:05,375 --> 01:48:07,544
<i>¡Mija!</i> Oh, my God.

1203
01:48:13,383 --> 01:48:16,753
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-No. No.

1204
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,922
No. No.

1205
01:48:22,559 --> 01:48:23,793
Levon!

1206
01:48:28,164 --> 01:48:31,034
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1207
01:48:44,013 --> 01:48:45,048
I was thinking
about taking Merry

1208
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:46,349
out to the chicken coop today.

1209
01:48:46,382 --> 01:48:47,217
Oh.

1210
01:48:47,250 --> 01:48:48,585
-Yeah, would you like that?
-Yeah.

1211
01:48:48,618 --> 01:48:49,752
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

1212
01:48:49,786 --> 01:48:51,588
You better watch out
for that old grumpy one.

1213
01:48:51,621 --> 01:48:53,623
He's mean. He's mean.

1214
01:48:53,656 --> 01:48:55,425
Oh, no. He's mean.

1215
01:48:58,127 --> 01:49:00,330
Hey, Dad, it's you!
You came back.

1216
01:49:03,233 --> 01:49:04,234
Told you I would.

1217
01:49:08,605 --> 01:49:10,039
You're okay, Daddy?

1218
01:49:10,073 --> 01:49:11,841
Yeah. I nicked myself shaving.

1219
01:49:16,446 --> 01:49:17,380
Hi.

1220
01:49:17,413 --> 01:49:18,681
Welcome back.

1221
01:49:21,351 --> 01:49:22,252
Hey, Joyce.

1222
01:49:23,721 --> 01:49:24,988
You're in one piece.

1223
01:49:26,356 --> 01:49:27,357
Just about.

1224
01:49:29,826 --> 01:49:31,861
Well, I guess
they didn't kill you, huh?

1225
01:49:31,894 --> 01:49:34,530
Nah. They really tried
their best.

1226
01:49:34,564 --> 01:49:36,032
Oh.

1227
01:49:37,701 --> 01:49:39,068
You found that girl?

1228
01:49:39,636 --> 01:49:41,070
I found her.

1229
01:49:47,310 --> 01:49:48,311
So, what did I miss?

1230
01:49:48,344 --> 01:49:51,814
Well, I made friends
with a crow and an owl.

1231
01:49:51,848 --> 01:49:54,117
And there's a goat
I taught to say my name.

1232
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:56,686
-No.
-Yeah.

1233
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,121
It was really cool.
I was just talking,

1234
01:49:58,154 --> 01:49:59,489
and then it was like, "Merry!

1235
01:49:59,522 --> 01:50:01,557
"Merry!"

1236
01:50:16,839 --> 01:50:18,241
Welcome back, brother.

1237
01:50:19,175 --> 01:50:19,942
You're home.
