1
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:23,116
<i>Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.</i>

2
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:25,645
<i>The survivors of the nuclear fire...</i>

3
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,446
<i>called the war 'Judgment Day'.</i>

4
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:31,613
<i>They lived only to face
a new nightmare--</i>

5
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:33,714
<i>the war against the machines.</i>

6
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,681
<i>The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...</i>

7
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,744
<i>sent two Terminators
back through time.</i>

8
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:02,885
<i>Their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance...</i>

9
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:05,555
<i>John Connor, my son.</i>

10
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:12,092
<i>The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me...</i>

11
00:03:12,137 --> 00:03:14,127
<i>in the year 1984...</i>

12
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,540
<i>before John was born.</i>

13
00:03:16,578 --> 00:03:18,443
<i>It failed.</i>

14
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:21,379
<i>The second was set to strike
at John himself...</i>

15
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,906
<i>when he was still a child.</i>

16
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:31,354
<i>As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...</i>

17
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:33,726
<i>a protector for John.</i>

18
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:37,198
<i>It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.</i>

19
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,191
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

20
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:06,344
You forgot to say 'please'.

21
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:23,724
Get him off me!

22
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:48,787
Pull it out!

23
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:09,039
Take it.

24
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:38,174
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

25
00:09:38,216 --> 00:09:41,084
Now, get off
before I put you down.

26
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:52,365
That's it, goddamn it.

27
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,236
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

28
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:59,230
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

29
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:02,542
<i>Ten-four, R-31 David.</i>

30
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,420
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

31
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,174
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

32
00:12:56,213 --> 00:12:59,580
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

33
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:02,313
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

34
00:13:02,353 --> 00:13:05,324
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

35
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:08,224
- Todd!
- What?

36
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,662
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

37
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:14,860
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

38
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,340
Come on.

39
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,644
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

40
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,584
She's not my mother, Todd.

41
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,780
This next patient is interesting.

42
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,310
I've been following the case
for years.

43
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,482
A 29-year-old female...

44
00:14:06,794 --> 00:14:09,491
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

45
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:12,830
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

46
00:14:12,868 --> 00:14:14,631
delusions of persecution.

47
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:24,443
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

48
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:27,345
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

49
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:30,249
which looks human, of course,
was sent back through time...

50
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,910
- to kill her.
- That's original.

51
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:36,220
And also that the father
of her child...

52
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:39,589
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

53
00:14:39,626 --> 00:14:41,595
He was from the future too.

54
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:46,294
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

55
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,565
And here we are.

56
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:50,464
<i>Morning, Sarah.</i>

57
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,747
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

58
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,552
<i>Fine, Sarah.</i>

59
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:05,952
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

60
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:09,551
with my pen a few weeks ago.

61
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:11,084
Repeated escape attempts.

62
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:23,675
Let's move on, shall we?

63
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,078
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

64
00:15:27,115 --> 00:15:30,685
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

65
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:46,362
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

66
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,167
You take it.

67
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:49,697
Now you know you gotta be good...

68
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,606
because you're up for review
this afternoon.

69
00:15:51,642 --> 00:15:55,512
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

70
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:56,673
Ain't no trouble.

71
00:16:02,957 --> 00:16:04,049
Yeah, zap her.

72
00:16:14,636 --> 00:16:16,662
Last call, sugar.

73
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,671
Sweet dreams.

74
00:16:54,282 --> 00:16:55,875
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

75
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,014
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

76
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:03,045
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

77
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,991
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

78
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,393
Do you have a photograph of John?

79
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:09,691
Yeah. Hold on.

80
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,896
Gonna tell me what this is about?

81
00:17:14,937 --> 00:17:17,531
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

82
00:17:18,674 --> 00:17:22,543
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

83
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,107
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

84
00:17:26,149 --> 00:17:28,379
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

85
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:30,886
Has that got something
to do with this?

86
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:37,321
I wouldn't worry about him.

87
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:40,230
Thanks for your cooperation.

88
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,233
Please insert your stolen card now.

89
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:53,242
PIN number.

90
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,076
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

91
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,641
Go, baby.

92
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:00,679
All right.

93
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:04,490
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

94
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:07,053
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

95
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:11,399
Withdraw 300 bucks.

96
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:14,269
Come on, baby. Come on!

97
00:18:14,306 --> 00:18:16,605
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

98
00:18:16,642 --> 00:18:20,771
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

99
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,939
Yes! Piece of cake.

100
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:33,350
- Is that her?
- Yes.

101
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,291
She's pretty cool, huh?

102
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,624
No, she's a complete psycho.

103
00:18:37,662 --> 00:18:40,392
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

104
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,197
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

105
00:18:45,239 --> 00:18:47,330
No shit.

106
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,474
She's a total loser.

107
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,239
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

108
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,341
Sarah...

109
00:19:22,313 --> 00:19:24,247
Sarah, wake up.

110
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,052
Kyle.

111
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:37,161
You're dead.

112
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:39,256
Where's our son, Sarah?

113
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:42,532
They took him away from me.

114
00:19:42,569 --> 00:19:45,801
- He's the target now.
- I know.

115
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,968
He's all alone
and you have to protect him.

116
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,479
I know.

117
00:19:50,512 --> 00:19:53,140
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

118
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,379
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

119
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:59,481
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

120
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:02,014
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

121
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:04,485
On your feet, soldier!

122
00:20:06,532 --> 00:20:08,000
I love you, Sarah.

123
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,331
I always will.

124
00:20:11,636 --> 00:20:12,797
I need you.

125
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:14,568
I'll always be with you.

126
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:21,972
Remember the message?

127
00:20:22,016 --> 00:20:23,881
The future is not set.

128
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:28,587
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

129
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,548
Stay with me.

130
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:54,352
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

131
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,619
Kyle, don't go!

132
00:21:15,778 --> 00:21:17,804
Kyle!

133
00:22:29,296 --> 00:22:33,289
<i>It's like a giant strobe light...</i>

134
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,700
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

135
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:42,199
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

136
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,882
<i>Oh, God.</i>

137
00:22:53,323 --> 00:22:56,823
<i>We know the dream's the same
every night.</i>

138
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:00,260
<i>- Why do I have to--
- Please continue.</i>

139
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,731
<i>Children look like burnt paper.</i>

140
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:10,500
<i>Black.</i>

141
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:12,509
<i>Not moving.</i>

142
00:23:14,312 --> 00:23:16,746
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

143
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:28,756
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

144
00:23:30,463 --> 00:23:31,625
<i>Dreams...</i>

145
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:33,896
<i>of cataclysm,
the end of the world...</i>

146
00:23:33,935 --> 00:23:35,904
<i>are very common.</i>

147
00:23:37,573 --> 00:23:41,839
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

148
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,871
<i>- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.</i>

149
00:23:45,916 --> 00:23:48,442
<i>On August 29, 1997...</i>

150
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:52,046
<i>it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin'real to you too!</i>

151
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:56,754
<i>Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

152
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:57,820
<i>Get it?</i>

153
00:23:57,862 --> 00:24:00,763
<i>God, you think
you're safe and alive.</i>

154
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,131
<i>You're already dead. Everybody!</i>

155
00:24:03,168 --> 00:24:05,730
<i>Him. You. You're dead already.</i>

156
00:24:05,771 --> 00:24:08,708
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

157
00:24:08,742 --> 00:24:12,838
<i>You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happened!</i>

158
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,847
<i>It happened!</i>

159
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:28,889
I feel much better now.

160
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,866
Clearer.

161
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,733
Yes, your attitude has been...

162
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:36,103
much improved lately.

163
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,910
It's helped me to have a goal...

164
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:51,219
something to look forward to.

165
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:52,417
What is that?

166
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,858
Well, you said...

167
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:58,797
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

168
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:01,529
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

169
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:04,366
and I could have visitors.

170
00:25:05,974 --> 00:25:08,534
Well, it's been six months...

171
00:25:08,577 --> 00:25:10,044
and...

172
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:13,445
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

173
00:25:14,483 --> 00:25:16,452
I see.

174
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:23,390
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

175
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,967
Now you think they don't exist?

176
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,402
They don't exist.

177
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:32,167
I know that now.

178
00:25:32,206 --> 00:25:35,404
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

179
00:25:35,443 --> 00:25:37,570
in a hydraulic press.

180
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:42,076
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

181
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:44,584
They would have found something
at the factory.

182
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:46,780
I see.

183
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:50,258
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

184
00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:55,431
No. Why would they?

185
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:58,760
Let's try a new position
right there.

186
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:12,013
Mr. Dyson?

187
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:14,713
The materials team
is running another--

188
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:16,449
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

189
00:26:16,489 --> 00:26:19,515
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

190
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,552
You have to sign for the--it.

191
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:25,464
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

192
00:26:27,301 --> 00:26:31,500
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know--

193
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,939
Know what?

194
00:26:32,976 --> 00:26:35,671
If you know where "it" came from.

195
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:39,169
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

196
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:41,183
Don't ask.

197
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:50,151
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

198
00:26:50,195 --> 00:26:53,187
Insert key.
Left on three.

199
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:55,598
Two, one, turn.

200
00:26:58,638 --> 00:27:01,869
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

201
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:32,141
So what do you think, Doctor?

202
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,146
I have shown improvement,
haven't I?

203
00:27:36,215 --> 00:27:39,048
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

204
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,587
I know how smart you are.

205
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:44,647
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

206
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:48,788
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

207
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:52,731
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

208
00:27:57,574 --> 00:27:59,904
You have to let me see my son.

209
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,737
Please.

210
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:09,914
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

211
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,779
If I could make a phone call--

212
00:28:12,823 --> 00:28:15,315
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

213
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,020
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

214
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:22,626
that you stay here
for another six months.

215
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:29,104
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

216
00:28:30,144 --> 00:28:32,111
You son of a bitch!

217
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,485
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

218
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:39,042
You don't know what you're doing!

219
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,248
Get some restraints in here now!

220
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,021
You don't know what you're doing!

221
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:52,166
<i>Model citizen.</i>

222
00:29:31,148 --> 00:29:33,912
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

223
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:37,183
- He was going to the Galleria.
- Yeah.

224
00:29:37,221 --> 00:29:39,019
The Galleria?

225
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:27,439
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

226
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:45,199
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

227
00:30:48,905 --> 00:30:51,703
Hey, do you know this guy?

228
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:53,936
Nah, I don't know him.

229
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,684
- John.
- Not now.

230
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:05,018
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

231
00:31:07,526 --> 00:31:09,494
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

232
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:12,019
- Just go.
- Yeah.

233
00:31:16,704 --> 00:31:17,966
I saw that kid--

234
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:35,258
You're not supposed to
be in here!

235
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:02,183
Get down.

236
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:15,133
Mister, are you all right?

237
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:17,503
You all right?

238
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,021
Come on!

239
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,343
Goddamn!

240
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,231
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

241
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:59,898
Time out.
Come on, stop the bike.

242
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:15,718
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

243
00:39:15,758 --> 00:39:18,191
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

244
00:39:18,226 --> 00:39:21,060
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

245
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,610
Holy shit.

246
00:39:36,081 --> 00:39:38,709
You're really real.

247
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,718
I mean--

248
00:39:43,188 --> 00:39:46,215
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

249
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,783
But alive outside?

250
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:49,796
I'm a cybernetic organism.

251
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:52,559
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

252
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,579
This is intense.

253
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:12,417
Get a grip, John. Okay.

254
00:40:14,992 --> 00:40:17,154
You're not here to kill me.

255
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:21,190
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

256
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:23,996
My mission is to protect you.

257
00:40:24,036 --> 00:40:26,698
Yeah? Who sent you?

258
00:40:27,873 --> 00:40:29,067
You did.

259
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:31,338
35 years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

260
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:32,138
to be your protector here,
in this time.

261
00:40:32,144 --> 00:40:33,633
to be your protector here,
in this time.

262
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:37,112
Oh, this is deep.

263
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:02,069
So this other guy, he's
a Terminator like you, right?

264
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,206
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

265
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:09,614
More advanced than you are?

266
00:41:09,652 --> 00:41:12,348
Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

267
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:14,219
What the hell does that mean?

268
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:16,226
Liquid metal.

269
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,557
Where are we going?

270
00:41:18,596 --> 00:41:21,461
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

271
00:41:22,033 --> 00:41:24,796
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

272
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:29,635
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

273
00:41:29,674 --> 00:41:32,476
- You sure?
- I would.

274
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:45,752
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

275
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:49,484
but I gotta warn 'em.

276
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:51,964
Shit. You got a quarter?

277
00:42:00,678 --> 00:42:03,737
<i>- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.</i>

278
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,181
<i>- John?
- Is everything all right?</i>

279
00:42:06,215 --> 00:42:08,684
<i>- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>

280
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,847
<i>- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

281
00:42:11,889 --> 00:42:15,518
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

282
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:18,290
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

283
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,922
I'm making beef stew.

284
00:42:19,966 --> 00:42:22,957
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

285
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,797
Where are you?

286
00:42:24,836 --> 00:42:27,772
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

287
00:42:27,808 --> 00:42:31,106
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

288
00:42:31,143 --> 00:42:32,701
The dog's really barking.

289
00:42:32,745 --> 00:42:34,976
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

290
00:42:38,821 --> 00:42:41,618
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

291
00:42:41,656 --> 00:42:43,386
Could he already be there?

292
00:42:44,524 --> 00:42:45,891
Are you okay?

293
00:42:45,928 --> 00:42:49,955
<i>- I'm right here. I'm fine.
- Are you sure you're all right?</i>

294
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,333
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

295
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,804
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfie?

296
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,468
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

297
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,412
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

298
00:43:02,447 --> 00:43:04,174
Where are you?

299
00:43:05,718 --> 00:43:06,844
Your foster parents are dead.

300
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:46,722
I need a minute here.

301
00:43:46,766 --> 00:43:51,135
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

302
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:54,140
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

303
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,665
Get real.

304
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,510
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

305
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,515
No, only an object
of equal size.

306
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:04,150
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

307
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:06,242
It can't form complex machines.

308
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:08,913
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

309
00:44:08,954 --> 00:44:10,353
It doesn't work that way.

310
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:13,051
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

311
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:15,220
Knives and stabbing weapons.

312
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:48,265
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

313
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,895
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

314
00:44:53,172 --> 00:44:56,164
He killed 17 police officers
that night.

315
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:59,678
Men with families...

316
00:45:01,215 --> 00:45:02,682
children.

317
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,651
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

318
00:45:06,688 --> 00:45:08,384
today.

319
00:45:10,092 --> 00:45:13,635
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

320
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:20,525
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

321
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:23,471
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

322
00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:25,203
We know this guy's involved.

323
00:45:26,309 --> 00:45:29,677
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

324
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,010
We're wasting our time.

325
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:38,216
Let's go.

326
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:40,853
Sorry, guys.

327
00:45:40,894 --> 00:45:45,196
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

328
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:47,530
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

329
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:50,834
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

330
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:52,464
Sure.

331
00:45:52,507 --> 00:45:55,566
Douglas, take her back to her room.

332
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,736
Yes, sir.

333
00:45:58,346 --> 00:46:00,439
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

334
00:46:00,483 --> 00:46:02,643
You see...

335
00:46:02,684 --> 00:46:05,917
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

336
00:46:07,089 --> 00:46:11,528
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

337
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:12,962
running guns.

338
00:46:12,996 --> 00:46:15,990
Then there were some other guys.

339
00:46:16,036 --> 00:46:18,061
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

340
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:21,335
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

341
00:46:23,107 --> 00:46:25,168
Then she gets busted.

342
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:28,839
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

343
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:34,954
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

344
00:46:34,988 --> 00:46:37,686
I hated her for that.

345
00:46:40,896 --> 00:46:43,627
But everything she said was true.

346
00:46:44,901 --> 00:46:46,870
She knew...

347
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,132
and nobody believed her...

348
00:46:52,842 --> 00:46:54,810
not even me.

349
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,648
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

350
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:02,049
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

351
00:47:02,087 --> 00:47:05,182
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

352
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:07,351
Great. What happens to her?

353
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:10,329
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

354
00:47:10,363 --> 00:47:13,629
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

355
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:15,794
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

356
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:18,032
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

357
00:47:19,875 --> 00:47:23,901
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

358
00:47:23,946 --> 00:47:25,812
This does not help our mission.

359
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:28,340
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

360
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:31,480
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

361
00:47:31,522 --> 00:47:32,579
Let me go!

362
00:47:37,095 --> 00:47:38,926
Why did you do that?

363
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:40,898
Because you told me to.

364
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:45,168
What?

365
00:47:50,176 --> 00:47:52,201
You have to do what I say?

366
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,509
That's one of my mission parameters.

367
00:47:55,717 --> 00:47:59,277
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

368
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:02,846
Yes!

369
00:48:04,993 --> 00:48:08,623
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

370
00:48:10,066 --> 00:48:11,398
You okay, kid?

371
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:12,866
Take a hike, bozo.

372
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:15,531
Let's get outta here, man.

373
00:48:15,572 --> 00:48:17,472
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

374
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:19,675
Dipshit?

375
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,973
Put your leg down.

376
00:48:24,014 --> 00:48:28,885
<i>- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.</i>

377
00:48:28,921 --> 00:48:31,288
Grab this guy.

378
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,120
Get him off of me!

379
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,287
Now who's the dipshit...

380
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,127
you jock douche bag?

381
00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:49,700
Put the gun down now!

382
00:48:49,745 --> 00:48:53,009
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

383
00:48:59,922 --> 00:49:01,914
You were gonna kill that guy!

384
00:49:01,959 --> 00:49:04,119
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

385
00:49:06,296 --> 00:49:08,993
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

386
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:12,435
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

387
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,905
You got that?

388
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:17,273
You just can't go around
killing people.

389
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,335
Why?

390
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:21,473
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

391
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:25,384
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

392
00:49:31,393 --> 00:49:34,885
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

393
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,797
I order you to help me.

394
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,807
You have a Sarah Connor here?

395
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:09,502
You're runnin' kind of late.

396
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,034
They've been in there for an hour.

397
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:14,514
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

398
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:20,152
Oh, here come your friends now.

399
00:53:21,926 --> 00:53:25,419
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

400
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:28,456
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

401
00:53:52,327 --> 00:53:55,594
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

402
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,964
Must be my lucky day.

403
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:23,256
You're right about number 24.

404
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,328
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

405
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:29,271
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,425
You!

407
00:56:48,929 --> 00:56:50,899
You broke my arm.

408
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:53,731
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

409
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,399
That's one. Now, don't move.

410
00:57:02,346 --> 00:57:04,006
What are you going to do?

411
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:09,678
Why do we stop now?

412
00:57:10,921 --> 00:57:14,790
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

413
00:57:14,826 --> 00:57:17,455
- Right.
- Swear?

414
00:57:17,496 --> 00:57:19,020
What?

415
00:57:19,064 --> 00:57:22,193
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

416
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:25,704
I swear I will not kill anyone.

417
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:28,765
All right. Let's go.

418
00:57:34,348 --> 00:57:36,374
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

419
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:38,716
Monday through Friday.

420
00:57:42,391 --> 00:57:43,654
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,321
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

422
00:57:48,098 --> 00:57:49,463
Crazy bastard!

423
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:56,002
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

424
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:01,511
He'll live.

425
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:18,159
Son of a bitch!

426
00:58:19,602 --> 00:58:20,933
Let's try to remain calm.

427
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:22,938
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

428
00:58:22,971 --> 00:58:25,064
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

429
00:58:25,107 --> 00:58:27,669
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

430
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,611
Take it easy, Sarah.

431
00:58:29,647 --> 00:58:32,809
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

432
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:35,877
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

433
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,980
So don't fuck with me!

434
00:58:38,024 --> 00:58:39,753
Open the door!

435
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:48,261
Back off!

436
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:49,768
Get back!

437
00:58:49,802 --> 00:58:51,770
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

438
00:58:53,107 --> 00:58:55,199
Don't move!

439
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:57,538
Drop the shit!

440
00:58:57,579 --> 00:58:59,479
Do it!

441
00:58:59,514 --> 00:59:01,482
Get in the office.

442
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:03,609
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

443
00:59:03,652 --> 00:59:05,381
Open the door.

444
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,658
On the floor. Hold it open.

445
00:59:09,693 --> 00:59:11,661
Face the wall!

446
00:59:27,614 --> 00:59:29,478
Get her!

447
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:00,174
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

448
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:03,152
Let's go! Open it!

449
01:00:05,592 --> 01:00:07,617
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

450
01:00:12,999 --> 01:00:15,333
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

451
01:00:47,472 --> 01:00:48,598
Mom, wait!

452
01:00:55,381 --> 01:00:56,439
Come back here!

453
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,716
- Help her!
- Wait here.

454
01:01:02,757 --> 01:01:05,352
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

455
01:01:06,628 --> 01:01:07,890
Hold her.

456
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:10,591
He'll kill us all!

457
01:01:32,791 --> 01:01:35,156
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

458
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:42,067
Come with me
if you want to live.

459
01:01:42,103 --> 01:01:44,662
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

460
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:10,426
Go.

461
01:02:42,738 --> 01:02:45,299
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

462
01:03:00,025 --> 01:03:01,926
Get down.

463
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:39,394
Out of the car!

464
01:03:40,772 --> 01:03:41,966
Right now!

465
01:04:06,403 --> 01:04:07,428
Go!

466
01:04:18,684 --> 01:04:19,910
I'm out.

467
01:04:26,725 --> 01:04:28,625
- Come on.
- Here.

468
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,257
Reload.

469
01:04:42,177 --> 01:04:44,169
Last one!

470
01:04:51,354 --> 01:04:52,945
Hang on.

471
01:05:19,153 --> 01:05:20,711
Ready!

472
01:05:34,403 --> 01:05:36,339
Here, drive.

473
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,833
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

474
01:06:31,871 --> 01:06:33,839
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

475
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:37,435
Can you see anything?

476
01:06:38,645 --> 01:06:39,873
I see everything.

477
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:44,375
Cool.

478
01:06:47,988 --> 01:06:49,956
Come here.

479
01:06:55,665 --> 01:06:57,461
I said I was okay.

480
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:01,362
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

481
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:04,636
You have to be smarter
than that.

482
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:06,301
You were almost killed.

483
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:09,241
What were you thinking?

484
01:07:10,147 --> 01:07:12,810
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

485
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:14,409
Do you understand?

486
01:07:14,452 --> 01:07:16,011
You're too important.

487
01:07:16,055 --> 01:07:18,717
Do you understand?

488
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:22,720
But...

489
01:07:24,397 --> 01:07:28,164
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

490
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:31,465
I didn't need your help.

491
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:40,569
What's wrong with your eyes?

492
01:07:42,547 --> 01:07:44,014
Nothing.

493
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:56,386
So, what's your story?

494
01:08:06,909 --> 01:08:08,034
You okay?

495
01:08:08,077 --> 01:08:09,545
Fine.

496
01:08:11,348 --> 01:08:14,647
Say, that's a nice bike.

497
01:08:37,144 --> 01:08:38,906
Watch it, lug nuts.

498
01:08:46,389 --> 01:08:49,825
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

499
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:52,658
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

500
01:08:53,596 --> 01:08:55,588
I bet.

501
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,657
Makes you a more efficient killer,
right?

502
01:08:58,702 --> 01:08:59,827
Correct.

503
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:07,878
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

504
01:09:08,947 --> 01:09:12,406
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

505
01:09:14,754 --> 01:09:16,722
John, help me with the light.

506
01:09:16,757 --> 01:09:19,088
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

507
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:23,358
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

508
01:09:23,397 --> 01:09:26,526
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

509
01:09:26,568 --> 01:09:29,537
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

510
01:09:29,572 --> 01:09:32,540
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

511
01:09:32,575 --> 01:09:34,042
so you can be...

512
01:09:35,245 --> 01:09:38,009
you know, more human...

513
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,812
and not such a dork
all the time?

514
01:09:43,954 --> 01:09:47,517
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

515
01:09:47,559 --> 01:09:51,927
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

516
01:09:53,265 --> 01:09:55,733
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

517
01:09:55,768 --> 01:09:57,100
No.

518
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:00,936
Can we reset the switch?

519
01:10:18,961 --> 01:10:23,456
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

520
01:10:29,307 --> 01:10:30,831
Do it.

521
01:10:38,986 --> 01:10:41,477
Now open the port cover.

522
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:46,585
<i>Pull to break the seal.</i>

523
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:53,690
<i>Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.</i>

524
01:10:57,205 --> 01:10:59,696
You can now access the CPU.

525
01:11:00,643 --> 01:11:02,872
<i>- Do you see it?
- Yes.</i>

526
01:11:02,912 --> 01:11:06,872
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

527
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:08,351
<i>Pull.</i>

528
01:11:45,729 --> 01:11:47,492
Do you see the pin switch?

529
01:11:47,531 --> 01:11:49,431
No! No!

530
01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:53,063
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

531
01:11:53,104 --> 01:11:56,438
<i>It, John, not him.
It.</i>

532
01:11:56,475 --> 01:12:00,002
<i>Okay, 'It'.
But we need 'It'.</i>

533
01:12:00,046 --> 01:12:02,708
Listen to me.
You listen.

534
01:12:02,748 --> 01:12:04,909
We're better-off on our own.

535
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:06,817
But he's the only proof we have...

536
01:12:06,853 --> 01:12:09,377
of the future and the war
and all that.

537
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:10,855
Maybe.

538
01:12:13,427 --> 01:12:15,521
I don't trust it.

539
01:12:15,562 --> 01:12:17,258
But he's my friend, all right?

540
01:12:18,098 --> 01:12:20,932
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

541
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,565
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

542
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:26,734
If I'm ever supposed to be this
great military leader...

543
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:30,644
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

544
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:35,415
Because if my own mother won't...

545
01:12:35,454 --> 01:12:38,285
how do you expect anyone else to?

546
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:55,567
All right, play it your way.

547
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:05,078
Was there a problem?

548
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,646
No problem.

549
01:13:08,325 --> 01:13:09,587
None whatsoever.

550
01:13:43,222 --> 01:13:45,190
Are we learning yet?

551
01:13:57,606 --> 01:14:00,574
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

552
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:05,906
Just head south.

553
01:14:14,656 --> 01:14:16,285
Keep it under 65.

554
01:14:16,326 --> 01:14:19,295
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

555
01:14:22,533 --> 01:14:25,060
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

556
01:14:25,103 --> 01:14:28,664
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

557
01:14:28,707 --> 01:14:31,004
<i>You say, "No problemo".</i>

558
01:14:31,043 --> 01:14:35,002
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

559
01:14:35,047 --> 01:14:39,348
<i>And if you want to shine them on,
it's "Hasta la vista, baby."</i>

560
01:14:39,919 --> 01:14:42,116
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

561
01:14:42,657 --> 01:14:44,716
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad".

562
01:14:44,759 --> 01:14:47,821
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out".

563
01:14:47,864 --> 01:14:49,330
Or you can do combinations.

564
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:52,365
Chill out, dick-wad.

565
01:14:53,168 --> 01:14:55,193
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

566
01:14:55,304 --> 01:14:56,329
<i>No problemo.</i>

567
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:09,317
You got any cash?

568
01:15:09,352 --> 01:15:12,947
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

569
01:15:12,989 --> 01:15:14,683
Mom!

570
01:15:15,826 --> 01:15:17,852
Get some food.

571
01:15:19,831 --> 01:15:22,354
No sense of humor.

572
01:15:27,505 --> 01:15:31,272
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

573
01:15:32,178 --> 01:15:34,374
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

574
01:15:34,413 --> 01:15:36,314
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

575
01:15:36,351 --> 01:15:38,376
Smile once in a while.

576
01:15:38,418 --> 01:15:39,817
Smile?

577
01:15:39,853 --> 01:15:43,813
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

578
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:48,523
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

579
01:15:49,429 --> 01:15:51,329
Give me a break.

580
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,226
Okay, bad example.

581
01:15:55,337 --> 01:15:57,033
See that guy over there?

582
01:15:57,072 --> 01:15:59,007
That's a smile.

583
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:19,820
That's good.

584
01:16:19,865 --> 01:16:23,699
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

585
01:16:30,078 --> 01:16:32,047
Want some of my fries?

586
01:16:42,025 --> 01:16:43,993
Need any help?

587
01:16:44,027 --> 01:16:45,723
No.

588
01:16:45,764 --> 01:16:47,628
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

589
01:16:55,975 --> 01:16:59,138
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

590
01:17:01,014 --> 01:17:02,276
People, I mean.

591
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,283
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

592
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:11,292
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

593
01:17:12,426 --> 01:17:13,825
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

594
01:17:16,362 --> 01:17:19,491
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

595
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:20,830
Who's responsible?

596
01:17:20,867 --> 01:17:24,464
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

597
01:17:24,504 --> 01:17:26,269
Who is that?

598
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:30,266
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

599
01:17:33,014 --> 01:17:34,812
Why him?

600
01:17:34,849 --> 01:17:38,252
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

601
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:40,654
Go on. Then what?

602
01:17:41,726 --> 01:17:44,694
In three years, Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

603
01:17:44,728 --> 01:17:46,163
of military computer systems.

604
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:50,168
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

605
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:51,692
becoming fully unmanned.

606
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:54,831
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

607
01:17:54,872 --> 01:17:57,570
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

608
01:17:57,610 --> 01:18:00,910
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

609
01:18:00,947 --> 01:18:04,177
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

610
01:18:04,217 --> 01:18:06,981
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

611
01:18:07,021 --> 01:18:11,354
It becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.

612
01:18:12,393 --> 01:18:15,021
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

613
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:18,397
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

614
01:18:18,434 --> 01:18:21,232
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

615
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:24,364
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

616
01:18:24,408 --> 01:18:26,843
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack...

617
01:18:26,877 --> 01:18:28,846
will eliminate its enemies
over here.

618
01:18:28,879 --> 01:18:30,848
Jesus.

619
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:35,119
How much do you know
about Dyson?

620
01:18:37,222 --> 01:18:39,189
I have detailed files.

621
01:18:40,359 --> 01:18:42,327
I want to know everything.

622
01:18:42,562 --> 01:18:44,927
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

623
01:18:59,245 --> 01:19:00,712
Miles.

624
01:19:03,048 --> 01:19:05,073
<i>Miles.</i>

625
01:19:22,936 --> 01:19:24,734
Are you going to work all day?

626
01:19:24,771 --> 01:19:28,676
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

627
01:19:28,711 --> 01:19:30,076
Miles, it's Sunday.

628
01:19:30,112 --> 01:19:32,876
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

629
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:35,975
I can't...

630
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,314
I'm on a roll.

631
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:53,434
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

632
01:19:53,472 --> 01:19:56,601
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

633
01:19:56,643 --> 01:19:59,839
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

634
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,609
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

635
01:20:02,648 --> 01:20:06,917
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

636
01:20:08,824 --> 01:20:11,121
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

637
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:12,524
I really need to know...

638
01:20:12,561 --> 01:20:15,689
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

639
01:20:17,333 --> 01:20:19,358
Baby, I am this close.

640
01:20:20,437 --> 01:20:21,460
Come here.

641
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:26,635
Imagine a jet airliner...

642
01:20:26,677 --> 01:20:29,372
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

643
01:20:29,413 --> 01:20:31,313
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

644
01:20:33,685 --> 01:20:36,154
Meet the pilot.

645
01:20:36,189 --> 01:20:39,319
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

646
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:40,418
You don't need us.

647
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:43,954
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

648
01:20:43,999 --> 01:20:46,900
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

649
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:57,672
I'm sorry.
Really.

650
01:20:57,713 --> 01:21:02,012
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

651
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:06,521
<i>Raging Waters!</i>

652
01:21:36,189 --> 01:21:37,452
Wait in the car.

653
01:22:16,336 --> 01:22:18,064
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

654
01:22:38,963 --> 01:22:40,589
Hey, big John.

655
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:42,390
What's up?

656
01:22:43,799 --> 01:22:44,927
He's cool, Enrique.

657
01:22:44,968 --> 01:22:46,094
He's with me.

658
01:22:46,137 --> 01:22:49,334
He's... Uncle Bob.

659
01:22:49,373 --> 01:22:51,500
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

660
01:22:51,543 --> 01:22:53,476
Uncle Bob, huh?

661
01:22:54,513 --> 01:22:55,810
Okay.

662
01:23:02,789 --> 01:23:03,812
Drink?

663
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:10,463
"Uncle Bob"?

664
01:23:12,467 --> 01:23:15,435
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

665
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:18,167
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

666
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:21,175
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

667
01:23:23,979 --> 01:23:28,110
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

668
01:23:28,151 --> 01:23:30,120
How about the fillings in my teeth?

669
01:23:30,153 --> 01:23:32,348
Now, Enrique.

670
01:23:33,658 --> 01:23:35,889
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

671
01:23:35,928 --> 01:23:37,259
Let's go.

672
01:23:58,221 --> 01:24:00,188
One thing about my mom--

673
01:24:02,457 --> 01:24:04,426
she always plans ahead.

674
01:24:15,303 --> 01:24:16,303
Excellent.

675
01:24:26,949 --> 01:24:30,646
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

676
01:24:30,685 --> 01:24:32,654
You got time to change it out?

677
01:24:32,688 --> 01:24:36,089
Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border.

678
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:37,650
Enrique.

679
01:24:37,693 --> 01:24:41,289
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

680
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,925
Sure.

681
01:24:43,966 --> 01:24:47,698
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

682
01:24:52,111 --> 01:24:55,672
See, I grew up in places like this...

683
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:58,184
so I just thought
that's how people lived--

684
01:24:59,453 --> 01:25:02,216
riding around in helicopters...

685
01:25:03,255 --> 01:25:05,521
Iearning how to blow shit up.

686
01:25:06,994 --> 01:25:09,690
But then when my mom got busted...

687
01:25:09,731 --> 01:25:12,130
I got put into a regular school.

688
01:25:12,766 --> 01:25:15,566
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

689
01:25:29,786 --> 01:25:31,981
Are you ever afraid?

690
01:25:32,022 --> 01:25:34,217
No.

691
01:25:37,196 --> 01:25:38,891
Not even of dying?

692
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:41,396
No.

693
01:25:45,805 --> 01:25:50,105
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

694
01:25:50,144 --> 01:25:54,136
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

695
01:25:59,121 --> 01:26:02,285
Then it doesn't matter.

696
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:05,956
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

697
01:26:22,314 --> 01:26:24,076
That's definitely you.

698
01:26:35,394 --> 01:26:37,865
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

699
01:26:38,467 --> 01:26:42,026
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

700
01:26:42,067 --> 01:26:44,035
He taught me engines.

701
01:26:44,069 --> 01:26:46,300
Hold here.

702
01:26:46,339 --> 01:26:48,772
Mom screwed it up, of course.

703
01:26:48,808 --> 01:26:51,298
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

704
01:26:51,343 --> 01:26:54,176
and me being this world leader.

705
01:26:54,213 --> 01:26:56,182
That'd be all she wrote.

706
01:26:57,518 --> 01:26:58,643
Torque wrench, please.

707
01:27:00,888 --> 01:27:02,149
Here.

708
01:27:02,189 --> 01:27:05,420
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

709
01:27:05,459 --> 01:27:07,257
You will.

710
01:27:07,296 --> 01:27:09,526
Yeah, I guess.

711
01:27:09,564 --> 01:27:13,433
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

712
01:27:13,469 --> 01:27:17,236
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

713
01:27:17,275 --> 01:27:18,741
Man.

714
01:27:20,243 --> 01:27:22,712
He hasn't even been born yet.

715
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,451
It messes with your head.

716
01:27:29,154 --> 01:27:32,123
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

717
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:42,027
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

718
01:27:42,069 --> 01:27:44,560
She still loves him, I guess.

719
01:27:44,604 --> 01:27:47,539
I see her crying sometimes.

720
01:27:47,575 --> 01:27:52,037
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

721
01:27:56,519 --> 01:27:58,078
Why do you cry?

722
01:27:59,155 --> 01:28:00,680
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

723
01:28:00,724 --> 01:28:02,158
I don't know.

724
01:28:02,193 --> 01:28:04,320
We just cry...

725
01:28:04,361 --> 01:28:06,957
you know, when it hurts.

726
01:28:13,005 --> 01:28:14,802
Pain causes it?

727
01:28:15,842 --> 01:28:18,002
No. It's different.

728
01:28:18,044 --> 01:28:21,377
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

729
01:28:21,414 --> 01:28:23,041
- You get it?
- No.

730
01:28:24,283 --> 01:28:26,048
All right, my man!

731
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:27,645
<i>No problemo.</i>

732
01:28:27,822 --> 01:28:29,449
Give me five.

733
01:28:31,494 --> 01:28:33,620
Just put out your hand
like this.

734
01:28:34,964 --> 01:28:39,298
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

735
01:28:44,006 --> 01:28:46,498
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

736
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:48,776
Five low.

737
01:28:49,514 --> 01:28:50,538
Too slow.

738
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:55,783
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

739
01:28:55,821 --> 01:28:58,085
Good. Now try it.

740
01:28:58,123 --> 01:29:00,092
Now do me.
Give me five.

741
01:29:01,528 --> 01:29:06,125
<i>Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.</i>

742
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:09,135
<i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>

743
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:13,163
<i>It would never leave him,
never hurt him...</i>

744
01:29:13,207 --> 01:29:16,666
<i>never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...</i>

745
01:29:16,712 --> 01:29:19,305
<i>or be too busy
to spend time with him.</i>

746
01:29:20,148 --> 01:29:22,310
<i>It would always be there...</i>

747
01:29:22,351 --> 01:29:25,046
<i>and it would die
to protect him.</i>

748
01:29:26,423 --> 01:29:29,823
<i>Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...</i>

749
01:29:29,859 --> 01:29:31,920
<i>this thing, this machine...</i>

750
01:29:31,962 --> 01:29:34,362
<i>was the only one
who measured up.</i>

751
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:37,001
<i>In an insane world...</i>

752
01:29:37,036 --> 01:29:39,004
<i>it was the sanest choice.</i>

753
01:31:16,784 --> 01:31:18,752
Hey, let's try this one.

754
01:31:24,359 --> 01:31:26,590
There we go.

755
01:33:12,652 --> 01:33:15,176
She said go south with him
like you planned.

756
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:17,451
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

757
01:33:19,225 --> 01:33:20,420
Mom, wait!

758
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:37,146
"No fate."

759
01:33:38,347 --> 01:33:40,815
No fate but what we make.

760
01:33:42,919 --> 01:33:44,887
My father told her this.

761
01:33:47,493 --> 01:33:51,792
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

762
01:33:53,432 --> 01:33:55,400
Never mind.

763
01:33:55,434 --> 01:33:58,836
Okay, the whole thing goes--

764
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:01,602
The future's not set.

765
01:34:01,641 --> 01:34:05,202
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

766
01:34:05,245 --> 01:34:08,306
She intends to change the future.

767
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,816
Yeah, I guess.

768
01:34:11,352 --> 01:34:13,216
Oh, shit!

769
01:34:13,254 --> 01:34:15,221
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

770
01:34:15,256 --> 01:34:18,783
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

771
01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:20,886
She's gonna blow him away.

772
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:22,989
Come on! Let's go!

773
01:34:35,413 --> 01:34:37,473
This is tactically dangerous.

774
01:34:37,517 --> 01:34:38,642
Drive faster.

775
01:34:38,683 --> 01:34:41,278
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do.

776
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:44,778
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

777
01:34:44,824 --> 01:34:47,316
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

778
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,327
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

779
01:34:49,362 --> 01:34:51,227
I don't care!

780
01:34:51,829 --> 01:34:53,625
Haven't you learned anything yet?

781
01:34:53,664 --> 01:34:56,189
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

782
01:34:58,871 --> 01:35:01,466
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

783
01:35:01,507 --> 01:35:03,702
but everybody's not like that.

784
01:35:03,743 --> 01:35:07,339
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

785
01:35:09,851 --> 01:35:13,547
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

786
01:35:51,065 --> 01:35:54,399
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

787
01:35:54,435 --> 01:35:56,734
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

788
01:36:13,389 --> 01:36:15,792
Danny, your time is up!

789
01:36:15,827 --> 01:36:18,796
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

790
01:36:47,329 --> 01:36:48,955
Danny!

791
01:37:00,543 --> 01:37:01,942
Daddy!

792
01:37:01,978 --> 01:37:04,469
Danny, go! Go!

793
01:37:06,017 --> 01:37:07,244
Miles?

794
01:37:12,457 --> 01:37:14,925
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

795
01:37:21,968 --> 01:37:24,028
Just take Danny and run!

796
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:25,368
Run!

797
01:37:25,405 --> 01:37:27,203
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

798
01:37:46,062 --> 01:37:47,121
Daddy!

799
01:37:48,766 --> 01:37:50,290
Nobody fucking move!

800
01:37:51,067 --> 01:37:52,365
Don't hurt my daddy!

801
01:37:52,403 --> 01:37:53,994
On the floor, bitch.

802
01:37:54,036 --> 01:37:56,234
Get down now!

803
01:37:57,075 --> 01:37:58,201
Get out of the way!

804
01:37:58,243 --> 01:37:59,710
Don't hurt him!

805
01:38:01,179 --> 01:38:03,238
Get on the floor now!

806
01:38:06,253 --> 01:38:08,015
Just let the boy go.

807
01:38:08,054 --> 01:38:09,682
Shut up. Shut up.

808
01:38:09,723 --> 01:38:11,054
Shut up!

809
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:13,719
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

810
01:38:13,761 --> 01:38:16,059
- It's all your fault!
- What?

811
01:38:16,097 --> 01:38:18,225
I'm not gonna let you do it.

812
01:39:10,228 --> 01:39:12,388
Shit! We're too late!

813
01:39:16,833 --> 01:39:17,959
Check them.

814
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:23,664
Look at me, Mom.

815
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,939
Are you hurt?

816
01:39:29,548 --> 01:39:31,642
I almost--

817
01:39:43,265 --> 01:39:45,665
It'll be okay.

818
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,668
We'll figure something out.
Okay?

819
01:39:49,237 --> 01:39:50,933
I promise.

820
01:39:54,176 --> 01:39:57,145
You came here to stop me.

821
01:39:58,015 --> 01:39:59,984
Yeah, I did.

822
01:40:02,853 --> 01:40:04,844
I love you, John.

823
01:40:06,524 --> 01:40:08,117
I always have.

824
01:40:09,995 --> 01:40:11,462
I know.

825
01:40:18,437 --> 01:40:20,669
Deep penetration.

826
01:40:22,242 --> 01:40:24,210
No shattered bone.

827
01:40:24,244 --> 01:40:27,215
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

828
01:40:37,962 --> 01:40:39,394
Who are you people?

829
01:40:40,330 --> 01:40:41,798
Show him.

830
01:40:44,434 --> 01:40:48,668
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

831
01:41:29,086 --> 01:41:30,384
Oh, my God.

832
01:41:30,423 --> 01:41:33,084
Now listen to me
very carefully.

833
01:41:38,965 --> 01:41:43,128
<i>Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.</i>

834
01:41:43,169 --> 01:41:47,072
<i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>

835
01:41:47,107 --> 01:41:49,440
<i>The history of things to come.</i>

836
01:41:50,844 --> 01:41:53,643
<i>It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...</i>

837
01:41:53,682 --> 01:41:56,549
<i>for three billion deaths.</i>

838
01:41:56,584 --> 01:41:58,552
<i>He took it pretty well.</i>

839
01:42:00,523 --> 01:42:02,991
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

840
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,160
You're judging me...

841
01:42:11,202 --> 01:42:13,669
on things I haven't even done yet.

842
01:42:17,875 --> 01:42:20,003
How were we supposed to know?

843
01:42:22,449 --> 01:42:24,439
Yeah.

844
01:42:24,483 --> 01:42:26,919
Right.

845
01:42:26,953 --> 01:42:29,115
How were you supposed to know?

846
01:42:30,157 --> 01:42:32,022
Fucking men like you...

847
01:42:32,059 --> 01:42:33,890
built the hydrogen bomb.

848
01:42:33,928 --> 01:42:36,557
Men like you...

849
01:42:36,598 --> 01:42:38,065
thought it up.

850
01:42:41,905 --> 01:42:43,872
You think you're so creative.

851
01:42:45,274 --> 01:42:48,404
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

852
01:42:48,446 --> 01:42:50,641
to create a life...

853
01:42:50,681 --> 01:42:52,240
to feel it growing inside you.

854
01:42:52,283 --> 01:42:55,252
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

855
01:42:55,287 --> 01:42:57,017
Mom!

856
01:42:57,056 --> 01:43:00,856
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

857
01:43:00,892 --> 01:43:03,020
We still have to stop this
from happening.

858
01:43:03,061 --> 01:43:05,930
But I thought--

859
01:43:05,965 --> 01:43:09,992
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

860
01:43:10,036 --> 01:43:14,905
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to finish the new processor. Not now.

861
01:43:14,941 --> 01:43:18,436
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

862
01:43:18,481 --> 01:43:20,415
That's not good enough.

863
01:43:20,449 --> 01:43:22,418
No one must follow your work.

864
01:43:22,451 --> 01:43:24,352
Right.

865
01:43:24,387 --> 01:43:28,790
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab--

866
01:43:28,824 --> 01:43:30,452
the files, the disk drives...

867
01:43:30,493 --> 01:43:33,189
everything here.

868
01:43:33,229 --> 01:43:35,322
Everything.

869
01:43:35,364 --> 01:43:37,334
I don't care.

870
01:43:38,570 --> 01:43:39,628
The chip.

871
01:43:39,671 --> 01:43:41,798
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

872
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,308
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

873
01:43:44,342 --> 01:43:47,106
The CPU from the first Terminator.

874
01:43:47,146 --> 01:43:49,581
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

875
01:43:49,615 --> 01:43:52,379
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

876
01:43:52,418 --> 01:43:54,784
Those lying motherfuckers.

877
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:56,653
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

878
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:57,885
It was smashed.

879
01:43:57,925 --> 01:44:01,588
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

880
01:44:01,629 --> 01:44:03,654
Things we would've never--

881
01:44:05,801 --> 01:44:07,928
All my work was based on it.

882
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:09,801
It must be destroyed.

883
01:44:12,041 --> 01:44:15,101
Can you get us in?
Past security?

884
01:44:15,145 --> 01:44:17,238
I think so, yeah. When?

885
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:23,244
Now?

886
01:44:27,059 --> 01:44:30,155
<i>The future,
always so clear to me...</i>

887
01:44:30,196 --> 01:44:33,222
<i>had become like
a black highway at night.</i>

888
01:44:33,266 --> 01:44:36,032
<i>We were in
uncharted territory now...</i>

889
01:44:36,071 --> 01:44:39,039
<i>making up history
as we went along.</i>

890
01:45:17,316 --> 01:45:19,285
Carl, right?

891
01:45:20,587 --> 01:45:24,046
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

892
01:45:24,091 --> 01:45:26,151
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

893
01:45:26,194 --> 01:45:29,527
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

894
01:45:29,564 --> 01:45:31,725
I need written authorization--

895
01:45:32,767 --> 01:45:34,826
I insist.

896
01:45:34,869 --> 01:45:36,668
Don't even think about it.

897
01:45:47,585 --> 01:45:49,052
It's okay.

898
01:45:50,455 --> 01:45:53,618
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

899
01:45:53,658 --> 01:45:56,628
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

900
01:45:57,930 --> 01:45:59,397
Gibbons?

901
01:46:02,436 --> 01:46:04,301
Gibbons! Come on, man!

902
01:46:04,338 --> 01:46:07,466
You can't leave the desk
like that!

903
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,769
Oh, shit.

904
01:46:31,337 --> 01:46:33,395
My card should access this.

905
01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:40,478
- What is it?
- Damn it.

906
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:42,503
The silent alarm's been tripped.

907
01:46:48,655 --> 01:46:51,421
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

908
01:46:51,459 --> 01:46:53,427
Nothing will open anywhere now.

909
01:46:54,463 --> 01:46:56,364
We have to abort.

910
01:46:59,535 --> 01:47:02,972
We go all the way.
Okay?

911
01:47:05,075 --> 01:47:08,943
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

912
01:47:08,979 --> 01:47:11,447
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

913
01:47:11,481 --> 01:47:13,449
It's him and the woman.

914
01:47:14,985 --> 01:47:18,218
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

915
01:47:20,392 --> 01:47:23,850
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

916
01:47:28,336 --> 01:47:29,462
It's no good.

917
01:47:29,503 --> 01:47:31,027
Let me try mine.

918
01:47:36,011 --> 01:47:38,138
John, fire in the hole!

919
01:47:50,126 --> 01:47:54,996
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the Halon system.

920
01:48:02,108 --> 01:48:04,108
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

921
01:48:07,075 --> 01:48:08,373
Put this on.

922
01:48:22,325 --> 01:48:24,885
All right, let's get to work.

923
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:49,353
<i>All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...</i>

924
01:48:49,390 --> 01:48:54,260
<i>a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.</i>

925
01:48:54,295 --> 01:48:55,990
<i>Suspect one is white female...</i>

926
01:48:56,031 --> 01:48:59,523
<i>identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.</i>

927
01:48:59,567 --> 01:49:02,537
<i>Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.</i>

928
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:04,539
<i>Suspect two: White male...</i>

929
01:49:08,178 --> 01:49:10,373
All the disks in my office...

930
01:49:10,413 --> 01:49:12,608
all the disks
in that office over there...

931
01:49:12,649 --> 01:49:14,675
everything behind my desk...

932
01:49:14,719 --> 01:49:17,018
and all the processors
on my left.

933
01:49:17,055 --> 01:49:19,650
We'll blow those with the CP4.

934
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:34,730
Can I...

935
01:49:35,375 --> 01:49:37,174
Excuse me.

936
01:49:38,847 --> 01:49:41,475
Can I borrow that thing?

937
01:49:50,561 --> 01:49:52,927
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

938
01:49:56,935 --> 01:49:59,165
<i>One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.</i>

939
01:49:59,204 --> 01:50:01,002
<i>2111 Kramer.</i>

940
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,032
<i>Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

941
01:50:56,398 --> 01:50:58,128
All right.

942
01:50:58,167 --> 01:50:59,965
7-2-5-6.

943
01:51:06,945 --> 01:51:08,310
Easy money.

944
01:51:13,051 --> 01:51:14,517
Uh-oh.

945
01:51:17,223 --> 01:51:19,691
Oh, shit. Not good.

946
01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:26,391
How we doing?

947
01:51:26,432 --> 01:51:28,162
Primer cord is set.

948
01:51:28,201 --> 01:51:30,670
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

949
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:37,512
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

950
01:51:37,546 --> 01:51:39,980
Piece of cake.

951
01:51:40,015 --> 01:51:41,573
- We got company.
- Police?

952
01:51:41,617 --> 01:51:45,019
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

953
01:51:45,055 --> 01:51:46,455
Go. I'll finish here.

954
01:51:48,426 --> 01:51:49,894
Come on.

955
01:51:50,928 --> 01:51:52,896
I'll take care of the police.

956
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:54,262
Wait! You swore!

957
01:51:57,202 --> 01:51:58,669
Trust me.

958
01:52:11,918 --> 01:52:13,580
<i>You at the window!</i>

959
01:52:13,622 --> 01:52:17,115
<i>Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!</i>

960
01:52:18,426 --> 01:52:20,291
Holy shit!

961
01:52:20,328 --> 01:52:21,886
That's a mini-gun!

962
01:52:44,122 --> 01:52:46,489
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

963
01:52:46,525 --> 01:52:48,119
Go! Go! Go!

964
01:53:35,682 --> 01:53:37,150
Fire!

965
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:56,167
Same time, to the left.

966
01:53:56,208 --> 01:53:58,573
One, two, three, go.

967
01:54:10,691 --> 01:54:13,557
In order to get that out--

968
01:54:20,301 --> 01:54:23,100
We got Skynet by the balls now.

969
01:54:23,138 --> 01:54:24,781
Come on, let's book.

970
01:54:26,006 --> 01:54:27,564
Hold your fire!

971
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:55,029
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

972
01:54:58,643 --> 01:54:59,974
Time to go.

973
01:55:00,012 --> 01:55:01,502
Now.

974
01:55:01,547 --> 01:55:04,538
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

975
01:55:04,582 --> 01:55:07,712
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

976
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:34,748
Mom! Mom!

977
01:56:19,103 --> 01:56:20,230
Shit!

978
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:24,610
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

979
01:56:34,122 --> 01:56:35,144
Get down!

980
01:56:42,564 --> 01:56:44,031
Here.

981
01:57:09,529 --> 01:57:12,987
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

982
01:57:17,138 --> 01:57:18,663
Fall back!

983
01:57:18,707 --> 01:57:20,333
Everybody out!

984
01:57:20,375 --> 01:57:22,309
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

985
01:57:57,718 --> 01:57:59,685
<i>We got a war zone here!</i>

986
01:58:31,591 --> 01:58:33,320
Shut your eyes.

987
01:58:39,899 --> 01:58:43,096
Stay here. I'll be back.

988
01:58:50,879 --> 01:58:53,245
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

989
01:58:55,952 --> 01:58:57,510
On the floor now!

990
01:58:59,856 --> 01:59:01,380
Okay, drop him!

991
02:00:21,249 --> 02:00:22,717
Here, hold this.

992
02:00:39,472 --> 02:00:41,099
Holy shit!

993
02:00:56,158 --> 02:00:57,181
Go!

994
02:01:36,037 --> 02:01:37,062
Shit!

995
02:01:50,554 --> 02:01:52,249
Get out.

996
02:02:11,276 --> 02:02:12,642
Listen.

997
02:02:12,678 --> 02:02:15,409
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

998
02:02:15,449 --> 02:02:16,778
- You got it?
- Yeah.

999
02:02:16,816 --> 02:02:18,283
All right.

1000
02:02:32,803 --> 02:02:34,099
Chopper's coming in!

1001
02:02:34,135 --> 02:02:35,262
It's him.

1002
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:34,439
Shit!

1003
02:03:37,278 --> 02:03:39,109
Stay down!

1004
02:04:53,365 --> 02:04:55,162
Goddamn!

1005
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,225
You okay--

1006
02:05:03,309 --> 02:05:05,776
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

1007
02:05:07,648 --> 02:05:09,309
Take the shotgun.

1008
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:14,111
Are you hurt?

1009
02:05:27,305 --> 02:05:28,329
Holy shit.

1010
02:05:28,373 --> 02:05:30,273
Come on, Mom. Come on!

1011
02:05:30,307 --> 02:05:31,467
We need your truck.

1012
02:05:31,508 --> 02:05:33,032
Hurry!

1013
02:05:38,017 --> 02:05:40,577
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1014
02:05:43,521 --> 02:05:44,784
Go!

1015
02:05:50,764 --> 02:05:52,789
What the hell--

1016
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:01,438
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1017
02:06:03,078 --> 02:06:04,738
Here. This'll work.

1018
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,015
He's gaining.

1019
02:06:14,557 --> 02:06:16,287
Step on it!

1020
02:06:16,327 --> 02:06:19,161
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

1021
02:06:29,977 --> 02:06:31,444
Coming up, to the right.

1022
02:06:33,481 --> 02:06:35,448
Watch it! Watch it!

1023
02:06:58,009 --> 02:07:00,136
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

1024
02:07:07,588 --> 02:07:09,555
Take the off-ramp.

1025
02:07:19,201 --> 02:07:20,394
Shit!

1026
02:07:23,537 --> 02:07:24,595
Hold on!

1027
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:12,120
Don't stop!

1028
02:08:19,937 --> 02:08:21,336
Go straight!

1029
02:08:23,975 --> 02:08:24,998
Look out!

1030
02:08:25,043 --> 02:08:26,068
Duck!

1031
02:08:40,395 --> 02:08:42,363
Get the hell outta here!

1032
02:08:47,869 --> 02:08:50,963
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

1033
02:10:07,928 --> 02:10:10,420
<i>Hasta la vista, baby.</i>

1034
02:10:59,922 --> 02:11:01,389
We don't have much time.

1035
02:11:24,016 --> 02:11:25,313
Let's go.

1036
02:11:26,353 --> 02:11:28,117
We gotta get outta here.

1037
02:11:28,155 --> 02:11:30,281
Come on! Get up!

1038
02:11:43,838 --> 02:11:45,601
Hand me the shotgun.

1039
02:11:50,379 --> 02:11:52,679
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1040
02:11:53,484 --> 02:11:55,418
Hurry!

1041
02:11:58,957 --> 02:12:00,618
Come on, Mom.

1042
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:08,432
Get up!

1043
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:41,868
This way. Come on.

1044
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:13,426
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1045
02:13:13,466 --> 02:13:14,763
Go back.

1046
02:13:22,942 --> 02:13:25,241
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1047
02:13:25,280 --> 02:13:27,306
John, you've got to go now.

1048
02:13:27,349 --> 02:13:29,544
- John!
- Go! Now!

1049
02:14:43,836 --> 02:14:45,804
Get up the steps.

1050
02:14:47,741 --> 02:14:49,208
Go.

1051
02:14:53,182 --> 02:14:54,649
Get up.

1052
02:14:55,451 --> 02:14:57,578
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1053
02:15:32,027 --> 02:15:34,393
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1054
02:15:35,764 --> 02:15:38,462
Grab it. Go. Go!

1055
02:15:48,813 --> 02:15:52,113
Mom, come on! Mom!

1056
02:16:41,273 --> 02:16:43,104
Call to John.

1057
02:16:45,878 --> 02:16:47,743
I know this hurts.

1058
02:16:49,550 --> 02:16:51,211
Call John.

1059
02:17:07,604 --> 02:17:10,265
Call to John now.

1060
02:17:12,342 --> 02:17:14,207
Fuck you.

1061
02:20:31,773 --> 02:20:33,239
Help!

1062
02:20:53,762 --> 02:20:54,854
Mom.

1063
02:20:57,064 --> 02:20:59,033
Help me.

1064
02:21:01,637 --> 02:21:02,934
Get out of the way, John.

1065
02:21:06,276 --> 02:21:06,799
Shoot!

1066
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:04,537
Get down!

1067
02:23:37,813 --> 02:23:40,008
Get up. Come on.

1068
02:23:42,251 --> 02:23:44,082
Holy shit.

1069
02:23:44,121 --> 02:23:46,590
I need a vacation.

1070
02:23:59,805 --> 02:24:02,639
Is it dead?

1071
02:24:02,676 --> 02:24:04,143
Terminated.

1072
02:24:07,515 --> 02:24:09,277
Will this melt in there?

1073
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:14,119
Yes. Throw it in.

1074
02:24:18,794 --> 02:24:19,819
Adios.

1075
02:24:21,196 --> 02:24:23,164
And the chip.

1076
02:24:38,317 --> 02:24:39,943
It's over.

1077
02:24:46,760 --> 02:24:48,455
There's one more chip.

1078
02:24:53,100 --> 02:24:55,398
And it must be destroyed also.

1079
02:25:00,810 --> 02:25:02,437
Here.

1080
02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:05,916
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1081
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:21,522
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1082
02:25:21,566 --> 02:25:23,899
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1083
02:25:23,935 --> 02:25:25,995
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1084
02:25:26,039 --> 02:25:28,667
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1085
02:25:28,707 --> 02:25:31,802
I must go away, John.

1086
02:25:31,845 --> 02:25:33,369
No, wait.

1087
02:25:33,415 --> 02:25:34,939
You don't have to do this.

1088
02:25:34,984 --> 02:25:36,348
I'm sorry.

1089
02:25:37,254 --> 02:25:39,551
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1090
02:25:39,588 --> 02:25:41,556
It has to end here.

1091
02:25:42,759 --> 02:25:48,101
I order you not to go!

1092
02:25:54,004 --> 02:25:56,063
I know now why you cry.

1093
02:25:58,443 --> 02:26:00,934
But it's something
I can never do.

1094
02:26:35,219 --> 02:26:37,449
Goodbye.

1095
02:28:16,498 --> 02:28:19,592
<i>The unknown future
rolls toward us.</i>

1096
02:28:19,636 --> 02:28:23,595
<i>I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.</i>

1097
02:28:23,640 --> 02:28:26,040
<i>Because if a machine,
a Terminator...</i>

1098
02:28:26,076 --> 02:28:29,512
<i>can learn the value
of human life...</i>

1099
02:28:29,546 --> 02:28:32,016
<i>maybe we can too.</i>
