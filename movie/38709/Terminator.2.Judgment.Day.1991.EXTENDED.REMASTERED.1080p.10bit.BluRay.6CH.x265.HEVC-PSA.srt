This next patient is interesting.

68
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,590
I've been following
the case for years.

69
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,793
A 29-year-old female,

70
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,761
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

71
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,012
The usual indicators:
depression, anxiety,

72
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,766
violent acting out,
delusions of persecution.

73
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,563
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

74
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,615
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator,

75
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,033
which looked human, of course,

76
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,828
was sent back through time
to kill her.

77
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,154
That's original.

78
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,082
And also,
that the father of her child

79
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:11,126
was a soldier
sent back to protect her.

80
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,625
- No?
- He was from the future too.

81
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,631
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

82
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,712
And here we are.

83
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,593
Morning, Sarah.

84
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:30,897
Good morning, Dr Silberman.
How's the knee?

85
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,684
Fine, Sarah.

86
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:41,070
She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap
with my pen a few weeks ago.

87
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,242
Repeated escape attempts...

88
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,672

Lewis.

90
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:59,514
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

91
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:02,804
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

92
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,435
Time to take you meds, Connor.

93
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,987
You take it.

94
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,359
You gotta be good.
You're up for review this afternoon.

95
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,360
I'm not taking it.

96
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:28,822
- I don't want any trouble.
- Ain't no trouble...

97
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,203
Yeah, zap her.

98
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,553
Last call, sugar.

99
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,190
Sweet dreams.

100
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,506
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

101
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,676
That's right, Officer.
What's he done now?

102
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,229
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

103
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,148
He took off on his bike this morning
so he could be anywhere.

104
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,853
- Do you have a photograph of John?
- Yeah. Hold on.

105
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,158
You gonna tell me what this is about?

106
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:49,235
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

107
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,700
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

108
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,161
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him, too.

109
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,087
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

110
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,211
Has that got something
to do with this?

111
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:08,471
No. I wouldn't worry about him.

112
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,391
Thanks for your cooperation.

113
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,137
Please insert
your stolen card now.

114

Hurry up.
This is taking too long.

116
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,818
Go, baby. Go, baby.

117
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,870
All right!

118
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,574

119
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,205
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

120

121
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,425

122
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,720
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

123
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,469
All right. Easy money. Come on!

124
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,094
Yes! Piece of cake.

125
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,482
- Is that her?
- Yes.

126
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:09,736
- She's pretty cool, huh?
- No, she's a complete psycho.

127
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,570
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute, OK?

128
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,322
She tried to blow up
a computer factory,

129
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,827
but she got shot and arrested.

130
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,500
No shit.

131
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,624
She's a total loser.

132
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,422
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

136
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,291
You're dead.

137
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,381
Where's our son, Sarah?

138
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,555
They took him away from me.

139
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,009
- He's the target now.
- I know!

140
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,094
He's alone.
You have to protect him.

141
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,599
I know.

142
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,561
You tell me how I am supposed
to do that.

143
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,976
He doesn't even
believe me anymore.

144
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,319
I've lost him.

145
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,272
You're strong, Sarah.

146
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,824
- Stronger than you ever thought.
- No.

147
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,619
On your feet, soldier!

148
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,248
I love you. I always will.

149
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,712
- I need you.
- I'll always be with you.

150
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,840
Remember the message?

151

153

There's not much time left

155
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,552
Kyle, don't go!

156
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,017
Kyle!

157
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,926
It's like a giant strobe light,

158
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:07,511
burning right to my eyes.

159
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,151
Somehow I can still see.

160
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,874
We know
the dream's the same every night.

161
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,415
- Why do I have to...
- Please continue.

162
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,835
Children look like burnt paper.

163
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,054
Black.

164
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,632
Not moving.

165
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,394
And then the blast wave hits them.

166
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,777
And they fly apart like leaves.

167
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:07,910
Dreams of cataclysm,
the end of the world are very common.

168
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:14,003
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

169
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:17,958
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels very real to you.

170
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:23,262
On August 291997, it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you, too!

171
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,924
Anybody not wearing
two-million sunblock

172
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,635
is gonna have
a real bad day. Get it?

173
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,854
God! You think you're safe and alive.

174
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,228
You're already dead. Everybody!

175
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,855
Him. You. You're dead already.

176
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,813
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

177
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,991
You're the one
living in a fucking dream, Silberman!

178
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:44,987
Cos I know it happened!

179
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,785
It happened!

180
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,003
I feel much better now.

181
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,960
Clearer.

182
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:08,516
Yes, your attitude has been
much improved lately.

183
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,069
It's helped me to have a goal,

184
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,322
something to look forward to.

185
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,569
What is that?

186
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:30,914
Well, you said that if I showed
improvement after six months,

187
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,662
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing

188
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,961
and I could have visitors.

189
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:41,545
Well, it's been six months and...

190
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,587
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

191
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,297
I see.

192
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:56,564
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

193
00:25:56,764 --> 00:26:00,018
Now you think they don't exist?

194
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,444
They don't exist.

195
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,237
I know that now.

196
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,236
But you've told me
on many occasions

197
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,785
about how you crushed one
in a hydraulic press.

198
00:26:11,153 --> 00:26:14,157
If I had, there would have been
some evidence.

199
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,662
They would have found something
at the factory.

200
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
I see.

201
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:22,924
So, you don't believe any more
that the company covered it up?

202
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,553
No. Why would they?

203
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,715
Let's try a new position right there.

204
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:35,099
The neuronal sensors are correct,
because it works.

205
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,805
- Right.
- Those neurons are all centred.

206
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,682
Maybe
the inhibitor circuits failed...

207
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:41,983
Mr Dyson?

208
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,859
Mr Dyson, the materials team
is running another...

209
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,569
- Mr Dyson.
- Yes?

210
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,618
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

211
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,663
You have to sign for the...
Er... it.

212
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,787
- You have to sign it out.
- OK. Come on. I'll get it.

213
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,623
Mr Dyson,

214
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:02,847
I know I haven't been here long, but
I was wondering if you could tell me,

215
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,044
- I mean, if you know...
- Know what?

216
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,798
Well, if you know
where "it" came from.

217
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,301
I asked them that very same question
once. You know what they told me?

218
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:12,677
"Don't ask."

219
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,482
- Good morning, Mr Dyson.
- How's it going?

220
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,771
Insert key.

221
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:26,946
Left on three, two, one, turn.

222
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,618
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

223
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,990
There you go.

224
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,274
So, what do you think, Doctor?

225
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,102
I have shown improvement, haven't I?

226
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,527
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

227
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,068
I know how smart you are.

228
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,818
I think you're just telling me
what I want to hear.

229
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,624
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

230
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:22,626
I think if I put you
in minimum security,

231
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,828
you'll just try to escape again.

232
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,511
You have to let me see my son.

233
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,964
Please.

234
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,762
Please.

235
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:42,931
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

236
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,890
If I could just make a phone call...

237
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,022
Afraid not. Not for a while.

238
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:52,239
I don't see any choice
but to recommend to the review board

239
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,737
that you stay here
for another six months.

240
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,822
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!

241
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,661
- Get her off of me!
- You son of a bitch!

242
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,122
10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!

243
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,551
- You don't know what you're doing!
- Get some restraints in here now!

244
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,798
You don't know what you're doing!

245
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,267
Model citizen.

246
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,229
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

247
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,023
He said he was going to the galleria?

248
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,270
Yeah.

249
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,101
The galleria?

250
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,525
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

251
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,209
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

252
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,919
No.

253
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,968
- Hey, do you know this guy?
- Nah, I don't know him.

254
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,149
- John.
- Not now.

255
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,194
Hey, there's this cop
scoping for you. Check it out.

256
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,571
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

257
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,698
- Just go.
- Yeah.

258
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:49,950
I saw that kid...

259
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,284
Hey!

260
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,350
Hey! You're not supposed
to be in here!

261
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,074
Hey!

262
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,248
Get down.

263
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,196
Mister, are you all right?

264
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,090
Come on!

265
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,677
Goddamn!

266
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,627
Agh!

267
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:29,201
OK. Time out. Stop the bike.

268
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,332
Time out. Come on, stop the bike.

269
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,768
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

270
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,017
- But you are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

271
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,067
- Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
- No?

272
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,873
Holy shit! You're really real.

273
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,752
I mean...

274
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:19,793
You're like a machine underneath,
right? But sort of alive outside?

275
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,799
I'm a cybernetic organism:

276
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:24,552
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

277
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,485
This is intense.

278
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,408
Get a grip, John. OK.

279
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,072
You're not here to kill me.

280
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,205
I figured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

281
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,003
My mission is to protect you.

282
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:58,707
Yeah? Who sent you?

283
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,000
You did.

284
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,552
35 years from now,

285
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,131
you reprogrammed me to be
your protector here, in this time.

286
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:09,092
Oh, this is deep.

287
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:34,542
This other guy,
he's a terminator like you, right?

288
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:38,212
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

289
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:44,340
- More advanced than you are?
- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

290
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,676
- What the hell does that mean?
- Liquid metal.

291
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,550
Where are we going?

292
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,510
We have to get out of the city
immediately

293
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:53,971
and avoid the authorities.

294
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,436
Listen, I got to stop by my house.
I want to pick up some stuff.

295
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,611
Negative. The T-1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.

296
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:04,485
- You sure?
- I would.

297
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,835
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

298
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,506
...but I gotta warn them.

299
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,050
Shit! You got a quarter?

300
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:35,763
- Hello.
- 'Janelle, it's me.'

301
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,189
- John?
- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'

302
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,687
- Are you guys OK?
- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'

303
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,896
- Are you all right?
- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'

304
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,573
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

305
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,323
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

306
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,948
I'm making beef stew.

307
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:54,247
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

308
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,825
John, where are you?

309
00:42:57,033 --> 00:42:59,786
What the hell is the goddamn dog
barking at?

310
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,123
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

311
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,674
The dog's really barking.

312
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,234
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that fucking mutt.

313
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,633
John, honey, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

314
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,846
- Could he already be there?
- Honey, are you OK?

315
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,227
I'm right here. I'm fine.

316
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,933
'Are you sure you're all right?'

317
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,940
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

318
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,780
Janelle, what's wrong
with Wolfie?

319
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,449
I can hear him barking. Is he OK?

320
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,324
Wolfie's fine, honey.
Wolfie's just fine.

321
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,156
Where are you?

322
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,826
Your foster parents are dead.

323
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,823
No, no. I need a minute here.

324
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,207
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

325
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:25,755
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

326
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,753
Get real.

327
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:31,587
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

328
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,467
No, only an object of equal size.

329
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,094
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

330
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:40,020
It can't form complex machines.
Guns, explosives have chemicals,

331
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,392
moving parts.
It doesn't work that way.

332
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,190
But it can form solid metal shapes.

333
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,234
- Like what?
- Knives and stabbing weapons.

334
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,138
These were taken
by a video surveillance camera

335
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,691
at the West Highland police station
in 1984.

336
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,108
He killed
17 police officers that night.

337
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,859
Men with families...

338
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,827
...children.

339
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:07,667
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda today.

340
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:12,960
Miss Connor,
we know you know who this guy is.

341
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:19,425
Look, I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing.

342
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,505
That the foster parents
have been murdered.

343
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,967
We know this guy's involved.

344
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:29,022
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

345
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:39,525
- We're wasting our time. Let's go.
- Sorry, guys.

346
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,235
She's grown more and more
disconnected from reality

347
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,945
as time goes on.

348
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,826
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

349
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:49,705
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

350
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,252
Sure.

351
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,205
Douglas,
take her back to her room, please.

352
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,505
Yes, sir.

353
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:59,214
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

354
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:04,390
You see, we spent a lot of time
in Nicaragua and places like that.

355
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:10,139
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy

356
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,555
running guns.

357
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,608
Then there were some other guys.

358
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,689
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from

359
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:19,989
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

360
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,780
Then she gets busted.

361
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:27,488
It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

362
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,824
It's like everything
I'd been brought up to believe

363
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,703
was all made-up bullshit.

364
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,334
I hated her for that.

365
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,295
But everything she said was true.

366
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,548
She knew.

367
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,802
And nobody believed her.

368
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,480
Not even me.

369
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:57,268
Listen,
we gotta get her out of there.

370
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,821
Negative. The T-1000's
highest probability for success now

371
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,238
will be to copy Sarah Connor

372
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,080
and wait for you
to make contact with her.

373
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,118
Great. What happens to her?

374
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,071
Typically, the subject
being copied is terminated.

375
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,250
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

376
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,578
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

377
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,787
Fuck you! She's a priority to me!

378
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,508
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Damn it!

379
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:24,553
- Help! Help!
- This does not help our mission.

380
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,097
Get this psycho off of me! Help!

381
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,222
Help! I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

382
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,426
Let me go!

383
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:39,645
- Why the hell did you do that?
- Because you told me to.

384
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,153
What?

385
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,954
You have to do what I say, huh?

386
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,249
That's one of my mission parameters.

387
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:58,037
Prove it. Stand on one foot.

388
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,590
Yes!

389
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,387
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

390
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,600
- You OK, kid?
- Take a hike, bozo.

391
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,226
- Let's get outta here, man.
- Fuck you, you little dipshit!

392
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,649
Dipshit?

393
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,686
Put your leg down.

394
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:27,571
- Did you call moi dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

395
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,028
Grab this guy.
I can't believe he called me...

396
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,864
Agh! God! Get him off of me!

397
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:36,121
Now who's the dipshit,
you jock douche bag?

398
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,542
Get off me!

399
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,875
No!

400
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,424
Put the gun down, now!

401
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,803
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

402
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,649
Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!

403
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,851
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

404
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,736
Listen to me very carefully, OK?

405
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,160
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

406
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,454
You got that?

407
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,998
You just can't go around
killing people.

408
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,198
Why?

409
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:20,206
What do you mean, why?
Cos you can't.

410
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,411
Why?

411
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,127
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

412
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,640
Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.

413
00:51:33,841 --> 00:51:37,266
And I order you to help me.

414
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,204
Hm!

415
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:04,037
Hi!

416
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:08,291
- You have a Sarah Connor here?
- You're running late, aren't you?

417
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,748
They've been in there for an hour.

418
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,300
Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.

419
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,797
Oh, here come your friends now.

420
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,406
Well, that was productive.

421
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,863
- Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

422
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:25,614
How 'bout a beer?

423
00:55:25,823 --> 00:55:27,245
Yeah, right!

424
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,776
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Lewis.

425
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:56,900
Must be my lucky day.

426
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:21,957
I think you're right
about number 24.

427
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,884
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

428
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,304
- Same time?
- Mm-hmm.

429
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,482
You!

430
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,614
You broke my arm.

431
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,412
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

432
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,161
That's one. Now, don't move.

433
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,836
What are you gonna do?

434
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,508
Why do we stop now?

435
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,559
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

436
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,228
- Right.
- Swear?

437
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,805
What?

438
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,017
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

439
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:26,064
- I swear I will not kill anyone.
- All right. Let's go.

440
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,991
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,
Monday through Friday.

441
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:45,041
- What the hell are you doing?
- You son of a bitch! You shot me!

442
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,176
You crazy bastard!

443
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,717
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

444
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:00,014
He'll live.

445
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,863
Son of a bitch!

446
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,662
Let's try to remain calm.

447
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,844
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

448
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,791
There's no way, Connor. Let him go.

449
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,123
Open the door.
It ain't gonna happen.

450
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,174
Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.

451
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,002
It won't work, Sarah.
You're no killer.

452
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,553
I don't believe you can do it.

453
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,005
You're already dead, Silberman.

454
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,693
Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

455
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,470
- So don't fuck with me!
- Open the door. Open the door.

456
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:46,985
Back off!

457
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,482
Get back!

458
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:50,485
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

459
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,904
Don't move!

460
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,205
- Drop the shit!
- Do it! Do it!

461
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,078
Get in the office.
On the floor, face down.

462
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,375
Not you!

463
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,078
Open the door.

464
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,333
On the floor. Hold it open.
Face the wall!

465
01:01:26,558 --> 01:01:28,060
Get her! Get her!

466
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:55,841
Sarah!

467
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:58,890
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- The door's locked!

468
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,851
Let's go! Open it!

469
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,052
Get the other door!

470
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:06,314
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

471
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:14,026
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

472
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,719
No!

473
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,267
No!

474
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,314
- No!
- Mom, wait!

475
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:48,811
Mom!

476
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,987
- Come back here!
- No! No!

477
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,700
No!

478
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,403
- Help her!
- Wait here.

479
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:03,113
Hurry UP!

480
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,289
He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!

481
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,582
Hold her.

482
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,832
He'll kill us all!

483
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,727
Mom, are you OK? Mom!

484
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,738
Come with me, if you want to live.

485
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,161
It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.
It's OK.

486
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:09,095
Go.

487
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,964
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

488
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,238
Get down.

489
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,548
No! Mom!

490
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:38,060
Out of the car!

491
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,649
Right now!

492
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,135
Go!

493
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:18,604
I'm out.

494
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,317
- Come on.
- Here.

495
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,951
Reload.

496
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,882
Last one!

497
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,633
Hang on.

498
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,244
Ready!

499
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,175
John!

500
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:34,885
Here, drive.

501
01:08:28,563 --> 01:08:30,565
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

502
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,946
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

503
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:38,494
- Can you even see anything?
- I see everything.

504
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,127
Cool.

505
01:08:46,873 --> 01:08:48,420
Come here.

506
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,174
I said I was OK.

507
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,103
John,
it was stupid of you to go there.

508
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:03,348
God dammit! You have to be
smarter than that.

509
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:05,024
You almost got yourself killed.

510
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,985
What were you thinking?

511
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,523
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

512
01:09:11,731 --> 01:09:13,074
Do you understand?

513
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:17,450
You're too important.
Do you understand?

514
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,449
But...

515
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:26,879
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

516
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:30,466
I didn't need your help.
I can take care of myself.

517
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,301
What's wrong with your eyes?

518
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:42,812
Nothing.

519
01:09:52,814 --> 01:09:55,112
So, what's your story?

520
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:06,749
You OK?

521
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,375
Fine.

522
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:13,384
Say, that's a nice bike.

523
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,526
Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.

524
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:48,336
Listen,
do you know what you're doing?

525
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,380
I have detailed files
on human anatomy.

526
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:57,303
I bet! Makes you
a more efficient killer, right?

527
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:58,550
Correct.

528
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,558
Does it hurt when you get shot?

529
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:11,442
I sense injuries. The data
could be called pain.

530
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,730
John, help me with the light.

531
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,948
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

532
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:21,616
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

533
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:25,323
How long do you live,
I mean "last", whatever?

534
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:28,243
120 years with
my existing power cell.

535
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,212
Can you learn stuff you
haven't been programmed with?

536
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:36,380
So you can be...
you know, more human?

537
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:38,803
Not such a dork all the time?

538
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:46,136
My CPU is a neural-net processor,
a learning computer,

539
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:49,389
hat Skynet presets to READ
only when we are sent out alone.

540
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,185
Doesn't want you
to do too much thinking.

541
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:55,774
No.

542
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,281
Can we reset the switch?

543
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:21,345
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

544
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:28,844
Do it.

545
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,147
Now open the port cover.

546
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:44,615
Pull to break the seal.

547
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:52,118
Good, now remove
the shock damping assembly.

548
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,958
You can now access the CPU.

549
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,843
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

550
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:03,588
Pull the CPU by its base tap.

551
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,548
Pull.

552
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,595
Can you see the pin switch?

553
01:13:46,172 --> 01:13:47,424
No!

554
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,098
- Out of my way, John!
- Don't kill him!

555
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,893
"It", John, not "him".

556
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,063
Okay, "it". But we need "it".

557
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,486
Listen to me. Listen.

558
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,022
We're better off on our own.

559
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,780
He's the only proof of
the future, the war and that.

560
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:09,327
Maybe.

561
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,533
I don't trust it.

562
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,702
But he's my friend, alright?

563
01:14:16,827 --> 01:14:19,171
You don't know what it's like
to kill these things.

564
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,504
If something goes wrong,
this could be our last chance.

565
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,302
If I'm supposed to
be this military leader,

566
01:14:25,503 --> 01:14:28,552
maybe you start listening
to my ideas once in a while.

567
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,889
'Cause if my own mother won't,
how do you expect anyone else to?

568
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:54,039
Alright, play it your way.

569
01:15:01,539 --> 01:15:03,541
Was there a problem?

570
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,126
No problem.

571
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:08,053
None whatsoever.

572
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,206
Are we learning yet?

573
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,188
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

574
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,943
Just head south.

575
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:14,954
Keep it under 65.

576
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:17,782
- We don't wanna be pulled over.
- Affirmative.

577
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:23,497
No, no, no. You gotta listen
to the way people talk.

578
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,129
You don't say "affirmative"
or some shit like that.

579
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,506
<i>You say, "No problemo."</i>

580
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:33,510
And if someone comes up to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"

581
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:37,844
And if you want to shine them on,
it's <i>"Hasta</i> la vista, baby."

582
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,471
<i>Hasta</i> la vista, baby.

583
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:43,232
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

584
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:46,231
And if someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

585
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:50,861
- Or you can do combinations.
- Chill out, dick-wad.

586
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,697
That's great. See? You're getting it.

587
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,824
<i>No problemo.</i>

588
01:17:06,163 --> 01:17:09,383
- You got any cash?
- I got a couple of hundred bucks.

589
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:10,925
I'll give you half.

590
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:13,045
Mom!

591
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:15,802
Get some food.

592
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,265
No sense of humor.

593
01:17:26,267 --> 01:17:27,940
And that's another thing:

594
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:29,771
lighten up a bit.

595
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,867
This severe routine is getting old.
You're acting like such a geek.

596
01:17:35,109 --> 01:17:36,577
Smile once in a while.

597
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,162
Smile?

598
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,865
Yeah. You know, smile.

599
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,245
Watch.

600
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:47,042
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

601
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:49,423
Gimme a break.

602
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,427
Okay. Bad example.

603
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:57,265
See that guy over there?
That's a smile.

604
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,573
That's good.

605
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:21,948
You could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

606
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:30,665
Want some of my fries?

607
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,551
Do you need any help?

608
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,260
No.

609
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:46,146
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

610
01:18:46,347 --> 01:18:47,815
- Got you!
- No, you didn't!

611
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,862
We're not gonna make it, are we?

612
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,778
People, I mean.

613
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,783
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

614
01:19:06,951 --> 01:19:09,579
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

615
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:12,666
Break it up
before I wring both of your necks.

616
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:19,138
I need to know how Skynet gets built,
who's responsible.

617
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:22,808
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

618
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:24,843
Who is that?

619
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:28,181
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

620
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,102
Why him?

621
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,563
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type

622
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,023
of microprocessor.

623
01:19:37,773 --> 01:19:41,027
- Go on. Then what?
- In three years,

624
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:43,203
Cyberdyne will become the largest
supplier

625
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:44,656
of military computer systems.

626
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:48,455
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers,

627
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:50,002
becoming fully unmanned.

628
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,331
Afterwards, they fly
with a perfect operational record.

629
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,917
The Skynet Funding bill is passed.

630
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:59,425
The system goes on-line
on August 41997.

631
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,552
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defence.

632
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,475
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

633
01:20:05,676 --> 01:20:09,852
It becomes self-aware at 02:14 am
Eastern time, August 29.

634
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,359
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

635
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,904
- Skynet fights back.
- Yes.

636
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:19,607
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

637
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,864
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

638
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,321
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack

639
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,327
will eliminate its enemies over here.

640
01:20:27,531 --> 01:20:29,033
Jesus!

641
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,773
How much do you know about Dyson?

642
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:38,088
I have detailed files.

643
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:41,136
Want to know everything.

644
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:46,134
What he looks like.
Where he lives. Everything.

645
01:20:58,020 --> 01:20:59,272
Miles!

646
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,714
- You going to work all day?
- I'm sorry, baby.

647
01:21:25,172 --> 01:21:26,924
This thing is kicking my ass.

648
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:31,138
It's Sunday. You promised to take
the kids to Raging Waters today.

649
01:21:33,055 --> 01:21:36,275
I can't. I'm on a roll.

650
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:53,368
This is gonna blow 'em away.
It's a neural-net processor.

651
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:55,085
I know. You told me.

652
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,080
It thinks and learns like we do.

653
01:21:58,539 --> 01:22:00,962
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

654
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:05,179
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

655
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,137
Why is that so important?

656
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,852
I need to know,
'cause sometimes I feel like

657
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,430
I'm going crazy here.

658
01:22:15,973 --> 01:22:17,896
Baby, I am this close.

659
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,981
Come here.

660
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:26,158
Imagine a jet airliner
with a pilot that never gets tired,

661
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,574
never makes mistakes,
never shows up with a hangover.

662
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:33,915
Meet the pilot.

663
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:38,667
Why did we get married?
Have children? You don't need us.

664
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,587
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

665
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,089
But it doesn't love you like we do.

666
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,933
I'm sorry. Really.

667
01:22:56,680 --> 01:23:00,275
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

668
01:23:03,312 --> 01:23:05,030
- Raging Waters?
- Yeah!

669
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:36,887
Wait in the car.

670
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,324
Enrique!

671
01:23:57,533 --> 01:23:59,877
Are you here?

672
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,643
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

673
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:24,857
And you... are always like a snake.

674
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,981
It's great to see you, Connor!

675
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:30,269
I told you I would be back.

676
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:33,159
I knew you would.
It's good to see you.

677
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,360
Jolanda!

678
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:37,623
Get out here, we got company.
And bring some tequila.

679
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:40,952
- Hey, big John. Como te va?
- What's up?

680
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,877
Who's this big guy?

681
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:48,050
He's cool, Enrique.
He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.

682
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,093
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

683
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,717
Uncle Bob, huh?

684
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,800
OK. OK!

685
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,267
How are you?

686
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,768
How are you?
You've grown so much.

687
01:25:01,972 --> 01:25:03,474
Drink?

688
01:25:07,769 --> 01:25:09,021
Uncle Bob?

689
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:14,110
Hey, Sarita! You're pretty
famous, all over the goddamn TV.

690
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,867
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

691
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:19,789
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

692
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:23,827
I just came for my stuff.

693
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,505
I need clothes,
food and one of your trucks.

694
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,673
How about the fillings
out of my fucking teeth?

695
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,377
Now, Enrique!

696
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:36,219
- You two, you're on weapons detail.
- Come on. Let's go.

697
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,533
One thing about my mom...

698
01:26:01,365 --> 01:26:03,493
...she always plans ahead.

699
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,044
Excellent.

700
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:29,773
This is the best truck I got,
but the starter is gone.

701
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:32,820
- You got the time to change it out?
- Yeah.

702
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,944
I'm gonna wait till dark
to cross the border.

703
01:26:35,065 --> 01:26:38,069
Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.

704
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,988
- You get out tonight too, okay?
- Sure.

705
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,868
Just drop by any time
and totally fuck up my life.

706
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:54,209
See, I grew up in places like this,

707
01:26:54,543 --> 01:26:57,217
so I thought
that's how people lived:

708
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:01,133
riding around in helicopters,

709
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,769
learning how to blow shit up.

710
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:10,351
But then, when my mom got busted,
I got put in a regular school.

711
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,196
The other kids were into Nintendo.

712
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:30,500
Are you ever afraid?

713
01:27:30,746 --> 01:27:32,043
No.

714
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:37,510
Not even of dying?

715
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,679
No.

716
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:48,601
You don't feel any emotion about it
one way or another?

717
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:51,475
No.
I have to stay functional

718
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:53,773
until the mission is complete.

719
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:00,324
Then it doesn't matter.

720
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:04,367
Yeah. I have to stay functional too.
I'm "too important".

721
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,597
That's definitely you.

722
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:36,979
Most of the guys my mom
hung round with were geeks.

723
01:28:37,187 --> 01:28:40,862
But there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

724
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:44,240
- He taught me engines.
- Hold here.

725
01:28:45,195 --> 01:28:47,618
Mom screwed it up, of course.

726
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,871
She'd always tell 'em about
Judgment Day

727
01:28:50,075 --> 01:28:52,453
and me being this world leader.

728
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:57,250
- That'd be all she wrote.
- Torque wrench, please.

729
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:00,760
Here.

730
01:29:01,795 --> 01:29:06,221
- I wish I could've met my real dad.
- You will.

731
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:11,021
Yeah, I guess.
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

732
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:15,479
I sent him back through time
to 1984.

733
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:17,561
Man!

734
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,569
He hasn't even been born yet.

735
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:25,284
It messes with your head.

736
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:30,532
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

737
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,922
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

738
01:29:41,126 --> 01:29:46,303
She still loves him, I guess.
I see her crying sometimes.

739
01:29:46,506 --> 01:29:47,928
She denies it totally, of course,

740
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:50,932
like she got something
stuck in her eye.

741
01:29:55,181 --> 01:29:56,683
Why do you cry?

742
01:29:57,809 --> 01:29:59,607
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

743
01:29:59,811 --> 01:30:02,280
I don't know. We just cry.

744
01:30:03,231 --> 01:30:05,575
You know, when it hurts.

745
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:16,871
- Pain causes it?
- Er... no. It's different.

746
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,048
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyways.

747
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,670
- Get it?
- No.

748
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,636
All right, my man!

749
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,056
- No problemo.
- Give me five.

750
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,515
Just put out your hand, like this.

751
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:37,608
All right! Now hit me.
Give me five. Do the same thing.

752
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:39,855
All right!

753
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:45,115
OK, that's good. Up high! High five!

754
01:30:46,232 --> 01:30:47,358
Five low.

755
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,069
Too slow.

756
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:54,366
I'm just kidding. One more time.

757
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,668
Good. Now try it. Good!

758
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,620
Now do me. Give me five.

759
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,332
'Watching John with the machine,

760
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:04,713
it was suddenly so clear.

761
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:07,888
'The Terminator would never stop.

762
01:31:08,088 --> 01:31:11,763
'It would never leave him
and it would never hurt him,

763
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,392
'never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him

764
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:17,893
'or say it was too busy
to spend time with him.

765
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:23,654
'It would always be there
and it would die to protect him.

766
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:28,401
'Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years,

767
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:32,954
'this thing, this machine,
was the only one who measured up.

768
01:31:33,947 --> 01:31:38,373
'In an insane world,
it was the sanest choice.'

769
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:16,248
Come here, darling.

770
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:18,226
Hey, let's try this one.

771
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:25,145
There we go.

772
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,795
She said you go south
with him like you planned.

773
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:17,004
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

774
01:35:17,212 --> 01:35:18,964
Mom, wait!

775
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:36,155
"No fate".

776
01:35:37,482 --> 01:35:39,701
"No fate, but what we make."

777
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:43,488
My father told her this.

778
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:51,088
I mean, I made him memorise it
in the future as a message to her.

779
01:35:52,330 --> 01:35:57,507
Never mind.
Now, OK, the whole thing goes...

780
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,338
The future's not set.

781
01:36:00,546 --> 01:36:03,971
There's no fate,
but what we make for ourselves.

782
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:08,681
- She intends to change the future.
- Yeah, I guess.

783
01:36:10,139 --> 01:36:11,857
Oh, shit!

784
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,856
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

785
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:17,439
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

786
01:36:17,647 --> 01:36:19,524
She's gonna blow him away.

787
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,609
Come on! Let's go!

788
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:23,491
Let's go! Come on!

789
01:36:34,247 --> 01:36:37,251
- This is tactically dangerous.
- Drive faster.

790
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:41,213
The T-1000 has the same files
that I do. It knows what I know.

791
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:45,927
- It might anticipate this move.
- I don't care. We gotta stop her.

792
01:36:46,134 --> 01:36:48,512
Killing Dyson might prevent the war.

793
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:50,438
I don't care!

794
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,436
Haven't you learned anything yet?

795
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,813
Haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?

796
01:36:57,687 --> 01:37:00,531
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die.

797
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,822
But everybody's not like that!
We have feelings.

798
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,950
We hurt. We're afraid.

799
01:37:08,531 --> 01:37:12,786
You gotta learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

800
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:53,080
Danny, I told you
to go to bed. I'm not kidding.

801
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,286
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

802
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:14,810
Danny, your time is up.

803
01:38:14,972 --> 01:38:17,691
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

804
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:47,554
Danny!

805
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:50,633
Ugh!

806
01:38:59,308 --> 01:39:03,063
- Daddy!
- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!

807
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:05,819
Miles?

808
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:10,991
Miles!

809
01:39:11,195 --> 01:39:13,493
- Tarissa, run!
- Oh, my God!

810
01:39:20,705 --> 01:39:22,628
Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!

811
01:39:22,832 --> 01:39:23,958
Run!

812
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:25,794
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

813
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:47,240
Daddy!
' Danny! Danny!

814
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,944
- Nobody fucking move!
- Don't hurt my daddy!

815
01:39:51,152 --> 01:39:54,827
Get down on the floor, bitch.
Get down now!

816
01:39:55,031 --> 01:39:56,783
Get out of the way.

817
01:39:56,991 --> 01:39:58,584
Don't hurt him!

818
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,833
Get on the floor now!

819
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:06,592
Just let the boy go.

820
01:40:06,792 --> 01:40:09,636
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!

821
01:40:09,837 --> 01:40:12,306
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

822
01:40:12,507 --> 01:40:14,635
- It's all your fault!
- What?

823
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:16,844
I'm not gonna let you do it.

824
01:40:35,488 --> 01:40:36,614
Shhh!

825
01:40:40,868 --> 01:40:42,085
Shhh.

826
01:41:08,938 --> 01:41:11,316
Shit! We're too late!

827
01:41:15,528 --> 01:41:16,529
Check them.

828
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:23,745
Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?

829
01:41:24,704 --> 01:41:26,251
Look at me.

830
01:41:28,249 --> 01:41:30,217
I almost...

831
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:32,341
I almost...

832
01:41:42,138 --> 01:41:46,188
It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.
We'll figure something out. OK?

833
01:41:48,144 --> 01:41:49,487
I promise.

834
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:58,534
- You came here to stop me.
- Yeah, I did.

835
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:03,414
I love you, John.

836
01:42:05,328 --> 01:42:07,422
I always have.

837
01:42:08,873 --> 01:42:10,716
I know.

838
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,221
Deep penetration.

839
01:42:20,968 --> 01:42:22,766
No shattered bone.

840
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:25,769
You hold here. The pressure
should stop the bleeding.

841
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:39,866
- Who are you people?
- Show him.

842
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:47,207
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

843
01:43:00,257 --> 01:43:03,386
Oh, God! No!

844
01:43:15,856 --> 01:43:18,154
Oh, my God!

845
01:43:27,410 --> 01:43:28,912
Oh, my God.

846
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,589
Now, listen to me very carefully.

847
01:43:33,999 --> 01:43:37,378
Nuclear winter effects
caused massive cooling...

848
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:41,636
'Dyson listened while
the Terminator laid it all down.

849
01:43:41,841 --> 01:43:45,436
'Skynet. Judgment Day.

850
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:48,685
'The history of things to come.

851
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:51,358
'It's not every day that you find out

852
01:43:51,559 --> 01:43:54,938
you're responsible
for three billion deaths.

853
01:43:55,146 --> 01:43:57,740
'He took it pretty well.'

854
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,744
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

855
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:12,839
You're judging me
on things I haven't even done yet.

856
01:44:16,584 --> 01:44:19,212
How were we supposed to know?

857
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:22,924
Yeah!

858
01:44:23,132 --> 01:44:24,634
Right.

859
01:44:25,551 --> 01:44:28,646
How were you supposed to know?

860
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:32,441
Fucking men like you
built the hydrogen bomb.

861
01:44:32,641 --> 01:44:36,862
Men like you thought it up.

862
01:44:40,649 --> 01:44:43,698
You think you're so creative.

863
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,952
You don't know what it's like
to really create something,

864
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:50,751
to create a life,
to feel it growing inside you.

865
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,204
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

866
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:54,789
Mom!

867
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:59,378
We need to be a little more
constructive here. OK?

868
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:01,625
We still have to stop this
from happening, don't we?

869
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:03,472
But I thought...

870
01:45:04,673 --> 01:45:08,519
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

871
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,269
That's right. There's no way
I'm gonna finish the new processor.

872
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,147
Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.

873
01:45:15,351 --> 01:45:18,946
- I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
- That's not good enough.

874
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:22,150
- No one must follow your work.
- Right.

875
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:27,080
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab:

876
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,705
the files, the disk drives,
everything, everything here.

877
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:35,379
Everything. I don't care.

878
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:38,373
The chip.

879
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,431
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

880
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:42,045
They keep it in a vault
at Cyberdyne.

881
01:45:42,253 --> 01:45:43,688
It must be from
the other one like you.

882
01:45:43,712 --> 01:45:48,092
- The CPU from the first Terminator.
- Son of a bitch! I knew it!

883
01:45:48,300 --> 01:45:50,894
They told us
not to ask where they got it.

884
01:45:51,095 --> 01:45:53,314
Those lying motherfuckers.

885
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:55,187
It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.

886
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,519
I mean,
it was smashed, it didn't work,

887
01:45:57,726 --> 01:45:59,103
but it gave us ideas,

888
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:02,190
took us in new directions,
things we would've never th...

889
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:06,443
All my work was based on it.

890
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,325
It must be destroyed.

891
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:13,626
Can you get us in? Past security?

892
01:46:13,826 --> 01:46:16,750
I think so, yeah. When?

893
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:21,791
Now?

894
01:46:26,005 --> 01:46:28,679
'The future,
always so clear to me,

895
01:46:28,883 --> 01:46:31,807
'had become
like a black highway at night.

896
01:46:32,011 --> 01:46:37,563
'We were in uncharted territory now,
making up history as we went along.'

897
01:47:13,010 --> 01:47:17,516
Hi. Er... Carl, right?

898
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,109
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

899
01:47:21,518 --> 01:47:22,518
Hi!

900
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,647
...take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

901
01:47:24,855 --> 01:47:28,029
Mr Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

902
01:47:28,233 --> 01:47:30,235
I need written authorisation...

903
01:47:31,445 --> 01:47:35,166
- I insist.
- Don't even think about it.

904
01:47:46,126 --> 01:47:47,673
Come on. It's OK.

905
01:47:49,088 --> 01:47:50,528
It takes two keys to open the vault.

906
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,266
They have
to be turned simultaneously.

907
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:55,140
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

908
01:47:56,762 --> 01:47:58,014
Gibbons?

909
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:05,942
Gibbons! Come on, man!
You can't leave the desk like that!

910
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:09,484
Gibbons!

911
01:48:10,985 --> 01:48:12,282
Oh, shit.

912
01:48:30,254 --> 01:48:32,302
My card should access this.

913
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:38,138
- What? What is it?
- Damn it.

914
01:48:39,388 --> 01:48:41,186
The silent alarm's been tripped.

915
01:48:47,312 --> 01:48:50,111
It's neutralised all the codes
in the entire building.

916
01:48:50,315 --> 01:48:53,910
Nothing will open anywhere now.
We have to abort.

917
01:48:55,154 --> 01:48:56,576
No.

918
01:48:58,282 --> 01:49:01,456
We go all the way. OK?

919
01:49:03,746 --> 01:49:07,421
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

920
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:09,064
I think it's that guy from the mall.

921
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:10,251
It is!

922
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:12,550
It's him and the woman.

923
01:49:13,881 --> 01:49:16,725
Look, just send everything
you got in the area right now.

924
01:49:19,303 --> 01:49:22,557
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

925
01:49:27,227 --> 01:49:29,400
- It's no good.
- Let me try mine.

926
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:36,619
John, fire in the hold!

927
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:53,467
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fire set off the halon system.

928
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:03,105
You have
to wait until the gas clears.

929
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:06,850
Put this on.

930
01:50:21,115 --> 01:50:23,368
All right, let's get to work.

931
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:48,229
All units in the vicinity,
all units able to respond:

932
01:50:48,433 --> 01:50:52,939
A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer
Street, the Cyberdyne building.

933
01:50:53,272 --> 01:50:55,195
Suspect 1 is white, female,

934
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:58,403
identified as: last name Connor,
first name Sarah,

935
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:01,238
escaped from
Pescadero State Hospital.

936
01:51:01,738 --> 01:51:03,035
Suspect 2: white, male...

937
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:11,377
All the disks in my office. All the
disks in that office over there.

938
01:51:11,623 --> 01:51:13,591
Everything behind my desk.

939
01:51:13,834 --> 01:51:15,836
All the processors on my left.

940
01:51:16,086 --> 01:51:18,339
We'll blow it up with the CP4.

941
01:51:32,144 --> 01:51:33,521
Could I...

942
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,568
Excuse me...

943
01:51:37,774 --> 01:51:39,902
Could I borrow that thing?

944
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:51,667
I worked a lot
of years on this thing.

945
01:51:55,709 --> 01:51:59,964
- Give me that location again.
- 2111, Kramer.

946
01:52:00,214 --> 01:52:03,844
The suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

947
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:56,733
All right!

948
01:52:56,937 --> 01:52:58,564
7-2-5-6.

949
01:53:00,148 --> 01:53:01,148
Yes!

950
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:07,159
Easy money.

951
01:53:11,952 --> 01:53:13,295
Uh-oh.

952
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:18,296
Oh, shit! Not good.

953
01:53:18,500 --> 01:53:19,672
Not good!

954
01:53:23,505 --> 01:53:26,759
- How we doing?
- Primer cord is set.

955
01:53:26,967 --> 01:53:29,220
One more barrel, two more minutes.

956
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:36,110
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

957
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,563
Piece of cake.

958
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:40,192
- We got company.
- Police?

959
01:53:40,397 --> 01:53:43,617
- How many?
- All of 'em, I think.

960
01:53:43,817 --> 01:53:45,740
Go. I'll finish here.

961

Come on.

962
01:53:49,698 --> 01:53:52,872
- I'll take care of the police.
- Wait! You swore!

963
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:57,248
Trust me.

'You at the window!

965
01:54:12,763 --> 01:54:15,733
'Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!'

966
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:20,484
- Holy shit!
- That's a damn mini-gun!

967
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:45,132

We go same time, to the left.

971

One, two, three, go.

972
01:56:09,588 --> 01:56:12,137
All right, in order to get that out,
you have to...

973
01:56:19,848 --> 01:56:23,478
We got Skynet by the balls now,
don't we? Come on, let's book.

974
01:56:24,853 --> 01:56:26,196
Hold your fire!

975
01:56:51,838 --> 01:56:54,091
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

976
01:56:57,594 --> 01:57:00,222
Time to go. Now.

977
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,229
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

978
01:57:03,433 --> 01:57:06,403
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

979

Listen. No matter what happens,
you stay under these vests.

- Yeah.

All right.

Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.

1012
02:07:06,410 --> 02:07:08,162
- Take the shotgun.
- OK.

1013
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:11,289
- Agh!

1014
02:07:12,208 --> 02:07:13,425
Are you hurt?

1015
02:07:26,264 --> 02:07:30,064
- Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!
- We need your truck.

1016

What the hell...?

1020

- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1021

- Step on it!
- This is the vehicle's top speed.

1024
02:08:16,314 --> 02:08:18,362
I can run faster than this!

1025
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:29,998
Coming up, to the right.

1026

- Drive a minute.
- Where the hell are you going?

1028
02:09:06,572 --> 02:09:08,119
Take the off-ramp.

Yes. Throw it in.

No, don't do it! Don't go!
