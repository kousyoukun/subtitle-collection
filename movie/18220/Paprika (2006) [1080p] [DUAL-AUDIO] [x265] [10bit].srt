1
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,820
It's the greatest show time!

2
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,730
There's no doubt. He's here.

3
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,380
Who?

4
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,400
Be careful. He's a traitor.

5
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,530
There's someone who keeps looking at you. See?

6
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,070
It's okay, he's a friend.

7
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:43,330
Please turn your attention to this gentleman!

8
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:47,600
Now, one, two, three!

9
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,510
There he is! Get him!

10
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,610
Grab my hand!

11
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,200
I let him get away again!

12
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,940
Aren't you the one who got away?

13
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,630
One more time!

14
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,530
Take that!

15
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,800
Damn.

16
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,950
<i>But what about the rest of it?</i>

17
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,410
You were in my dream.

18
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,810
Everyone is startled at first.

19
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,690
The DC Mini.

20
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:59,780
It's the scientific key that allows us to open the door to our dreams.

21
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,340
It can even do all this?

22
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,990
It really is a dream machine.

23
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,960
To tell you the truth, the DC Mini is still incomplete.

24
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:17,290
Once complete, we'll be able to enter your dream even while awake.

25
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,110
You said he was a friend.

26
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,640
We used to work together.

27
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,720
Why did he put you in a cage?

28
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,450
I don't know.

29
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,980
He's not the kind of person who would trick me.

30
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,340
Why are they all me?

31
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,090
That was really disturbing.

32
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,510
This is Tarzan, right?

33
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,450
This is a scene from a spy movie, perhaps?

34
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,350
The fighting was rather fun.

35
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,000
REM sleep that occurs later during the sleep cycle is longer and easier to analyze.

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,740
If earlier cycles are, say, artsy film shorts later cycles are like feature-length blockbuster movies.

37
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,500
Then that makes you a dream movie star.

38
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,560
Do you not like movies?

39
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
It's not that.

40
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,440
What is this?

41
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,300
The victim in the homicide case I'm working on right now.

42
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,560
I haven't been able to catch the perp, so maybe that's why I....

43
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,310
Your anxiety neurosis.

44
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,060
Do you think this is the source?

45
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,380
No need to rush.

46
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,130
The treatment's just getting started.

47
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,760
Take care, Captain Konakawa.

48
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,060
When can I see you again?

49
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,570
I'm in a bind.

50
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,840
I can see that.

51
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,830
No, it's not that.

52
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,100
I was on my way to see you.

53
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,630
It's not that! The DC Mini!

54
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,200
It was stolen? The DC Mini?

55
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,930
We found out this morning.

56
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,700
Three samples in Dr. Tokita's possession were stolen.

57
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,900
But why?

58
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,380
<i>We'll worry about the reason later. We need to find them now.</i>

59
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,130
Do you think it's internal?

60
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,630
Unfortunately.

61
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,450
We'll talk about that later.

62
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,180
Foundation for Psychiatric Research

63
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,390
Foundation for Psychiatric Research

64
00:08:59,390 --> 00:08:59,760
Foundation for Psychiatric Research

65
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,850
Meet me in my office. We'll figure out a plan before the chairman finds out.

66
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,730
Yes, we have to protect the DC Mini.

67
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,330
It's too bad it was stolen, but all we have to do is make another one.

68
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:24,310
You should know better than anyone what can happen if it's misused.

69
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,480
You invented it.

70
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,340
I make it, but how it's used is your job, At-chan.

71
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,090
Please don't call me that.

72
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,210
There is one more problem.

73
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,810
Good grief.

74
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,480
I hadn't programmed the access controls into the DC Mini yet.

75
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,230
Translate that for me.

76
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:01,430
It means that the person who stole the DC Mini can connect to a psychotherapy machine

77
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:06,710
at any time, from any place, and use it to intrude into the minds connected to that machine.

78
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,840
Chief's Office

79
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,340
I see. We have to hurry.

80
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,180
It is man's responsibility to control science and technology.

81
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,770
Chairman.

82
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,580
Sharing in another's dream.

83
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,200
It is quite literally a technological dream but, in time, it can lead to violence.

84
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,030
It was an invention that never should have been created.

85
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,350
This discussion again?

86
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:53,170
The DC Mini represents the hope that shines on the new horizons of psychiatric treatment.

87
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,110
It is taking control over dreams.

88
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,670
Your overconfidence will bring weakness.

89
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,990
It is not about control.

90
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,180
We are simply pursuing a deeper connection with our patients.

91
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,560
The terrorist who stole it won't see it that way.

92
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,820
But it hasn't even been misused yet.

93
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,490
Thieves are not always wrong.

94
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,910
Paprika.

95
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:32,170
I hear there's a woman who's been using the psychotherapy machine for unapproved treatments.

96
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,420
Are you going to believe such groundless rumors, chairman?

97
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,060
Discipline calls for a search of the DC Mini rather than Paprika's bikini.

98
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,180
This is true happiness.

99
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,180
Discipline?

100
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:51,690
Even the five court ladies danced in sync to the frog's flutes and drums.

101
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:55,770
The whirlwind of the recycled paper was a sight to see.

102
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,150
It was like computer graphics!

103
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,470
The fact that I don't support Technicolor parfaits and snobby petit bourgeois,

104
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,450
is common knowledge in Oceania!

105
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,580
Now is the time to return home to the blue sky!

106
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,020
The confetti will dance around the shrine gates,

107
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,550
and the mailbox and the refrigerator will lead the way!

108
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:28,470
Anyone who cares about expiration dates will not get in the way of the glory train!

109
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,230
They need to fully realize the liver of the triangle rulers!

110
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:40,440
Now, this festival was decided by the third-grade class with the telephoto camera!

111
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,240
Move forward! Come together!
I am the ultimate governor!

112
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,370
Chief!

113
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,000
Now! Right now!

114
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,000
Take me in!

115
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,700
<i>He has the dream of a patient planted into his brain.</i>

116
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,710
How's the chief doing?

117
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,210
His breathing and pulse are stable.

118
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,410
I guess it could've been worse.

119
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,950
Dr. Chiba, here are the chief's medical records.

120
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,260
Thank you.

121
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,570
He was probably using the therapy machine to treat a patient-

122
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,400
When someone used a DC Mini to intrude.

123
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,570
And the dream was projected into his subconscious without him knowing.

124
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,490
But for that to happen....

125
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,370
The culprit has to be watching this nightmare too.

126
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,370
What a desperate terrorist.

127
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,850
All terrorists are desperate.

128
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,380
<i>The sun during midday will light up the dark night.</i>

129
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:28,380
<i>Night dreams of day. Light dreams of darkness.</i>

130
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,060
But the ignorant sun will chase away the darkness and burn the shadows...

131
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,560
...eventually burning itself!

132
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,060
Himuro!

133
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,180
The shade of the tree with the flowers that bloom at night

134
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,570
is where the residents of darkness rest.

135
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,070
Why is Himuro in there?

136
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:52,300
<i>The people of daytime are not allowed!</i>

137
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,700
Where is Himuro?

138
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:02,920
He's been out for the past few days, but I didn't think too much of it.

139
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,420
Himuro tends to abandon everything else when he really gets into something.

140
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,070
Like doctor, like assistant.

141
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,830
How could we have not seen this coming?

142
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,770
I thought he was my friend.

143
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,010
A genius produces a lot more than he realizes.

144
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,570
More clearly, please.

145
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:35,100
Himuro was jealous of Dr. Tokita.

146
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,080
Even I feel bitter towards you sometimes, Dr. Chiba.

147
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,620
No matter how hard I try, I'm not as good as you.

148
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,750
I feel powerless.

149
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,730
It's open.

150
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,300
You mean you opened it.

151
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,000
This is illegal, you know.

152
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,210
I'm not as bad as Himuro, though.

153
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,230
<i>-Welcome home.</i>
<i>-Welcome back.</i>

154
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,390
He can't be serious.

155
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,950
This is dangerous.

156
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,540
This isn't your cue.

157
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,630
<i>Anaphylaxis?</i>

158
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,880
Like an allergy?

159
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,140
I can't think of any other reason.

160
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,610
I got stung by a jellyfish when I was a kid.

161
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,540
Even now, I have allergic reactions at the sight of one.

162
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,010
It didn't occur to me until now.

163
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:00,070
Here you go.
Who had the udon set?

164
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,160
But the DC Mini uses a transmission formula

165
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,660
within the natural width of the body's energy level.

166
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,040
Who had the jumbo steak set?

167
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:16,550
Depending on the frequency of use, the body might adapt to it.

168
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,670
And as a result, Dr. Chiba, who has had the most exposure, was more susceptible to invasion,

169
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,080
even when she wasn't connected to the DC Mini, nor was she asleep.

170
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,020
Who had the paella?

171
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,650
I think you have a problem too. Like overeating.

172
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,650
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

173
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,660
Fight?

174
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,600
Implanting dreams into other people's heads is terrorism.

175
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,090
At-chan, you said that Himuro and I were alike.

176
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,840
I think so too. All the more reason this is unforgivable.

177
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,080
Hello?

178
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,400
We'll be there immediately.

179
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,950
Chief! Please, come back!

180
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,850
Wake up! Chief!

181
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,880
The delicious left brain is getting older and drifting to a faraway island.

182
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,790
Himuro, give him back!

183
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,920
I, who stand before you, am the protector of your dreams.

184
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,630
I wonder what kind of punishment will befall the ignorant commoner

185
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,860
who tries to enter this sacred dream?

186
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,750
You're the feisty country girl I saved some time ago.

187
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,750
How are you?

188
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,020
If he was not home when I passed by around 7:30...

189
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,320
...then he probably disappeared into the instant noodle soup.

190
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,550
Thank you for saving me.

191
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,680
I have come to show you my appreciation.

192
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,020
Is it a square?

193
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,540
No.

194
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,260
It's round, like this.

195
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,010
I can feel it.

196
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,070
Paprika.

197
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,060
Do you remember me now?

198
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,390
I'm going to be a little rough.

199
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,960
Paprika, what are you doing?

200
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,940
Now, now, stop that.

201
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,250
Welcome back, Chief.

202
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:28,200
I wonder where that parade was going?

203
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,700
A place of no return, most likely.

204
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:41,210
I felt like I was really close to controlling the entire world.

205
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,530
That was a dream of a severely delusional patient.

206
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:52,390
While you were in there, your brain waves and body deteriorated almost to the point of death.

207
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,160
That's why Paprika came.
Thank you.

208
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,810
You haven't changed since the time you treated my depression two years ago.

209
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,150
I'll let Paprika know.

210
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,640
But to think that that honest Himuro was responsible.

211
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,160
What should I do now, Dr. Chiba?

212
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,270
Please don't do anything.

213
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,170
What?

214
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:30,820
The chairman will probably halt the development of the DC Mini as a result of this incident.

215
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,180
But with you, a board member, in the hospital....

216
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,500
They can't have a meeting.

217
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,570
Hello? Oh, Konakawa.

218
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,070
How was the...? You know.

219
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,680
I would have asked sooner if I had known that it would be this good.

220
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,850
<i>Remember, you can't tell anyone.</i>

221
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,080
I want to keep it a secret all to myself.

222
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:07,230
<i>Paprika's existence cannot become public until the psychotherapy machines gain public approval.</i>

223
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,090
<i>She really is a woman of your dreams.</i>

224
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,370
Women of dreams are busy these days.

225
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,970
You look tired. Want me to look in on your dreams?

226
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:26,150
I haven't been seeing any of my own lately.

227
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,720
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

228
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,110
Good evening.

229
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,020
What is this place?

230
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,080
A counseling room. A meeting place. A date spot.

231
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,480
Don't you think dreams and the Internet are similar?

232
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,590
They are both areas where the repressed conscious mind vents.

233
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,360
Here you go.

234
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,900
Have you found anything?

235
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,650
In regards to my dreams?

236
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,650
You're so impatient.

237
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,180
Do you work at the research foundation?

238
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,640
It was Shima who introduced me, after all.

239
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,210
Where do you know Mr. Shima from?

240
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,810
He's a friend from college.

241
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:13,210
We got along pretty well, so we always hung out.

242
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,470
Drinking and watching movies?

243
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,390
No, movies don't interest me.

244
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,370
I love them!

245
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,410
Paprika?

246
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,400
Put it on my tab.

247
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,750
Hey, Paprika!

248
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,210
Which one do you want to see?

249
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,960
I'm sorry, but movies really aren't my thing.

250
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,240
Come on, hurry!

251
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,840
I don't like movies!

252
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,670
Hey, Tsumura, stop-

253
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,060
Breaking news!

254
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,960
The widow who tells fortunes in the shade of roof tiles!

255
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,320
The response is sunny!

256
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,970
The sign is good fortune!

257
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,070
The ceiling fan brings a message releasing epithets!

258
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,720
The maiden who sleeps under the veranda has a pulse!

259
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,970
This is the way out!

260
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,600
The secret of this view is deep within the 10-year loan payment!

261
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:33,000


262
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,610


263
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,670
<i>They are new victims.</i>

264
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,860
I am stopping development.

265
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,430
But the board meeting-

266
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,490
The culprit won't wait for a board meeting to happen.

267
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:52,390
I am forbidding all use of the DC Mini and the psychotherapy machines.

268
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,320
This is retribution.

269
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:05,820
Science is nothing but a piece of trash before a profound dream.

270
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,520
Are you okay?

271
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,920
I heard the parts are non-recyclable.

272
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
But that's an important piece of equipment.

273
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,850
I'll just have to make it again.

274
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,850
He's a genius.

275
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,880
He's a mysterious one, all right.

276
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,800
You're giving him too much credit.

277
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,280
He's just a kid inside.

278
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:56,670
DREAMLAND

279
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,500
It was a small theme park, but I liked it as a kid.

280
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,130
DREAMLAND

281
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,250
DREAMLAND

282
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,840
I used to talk about it with Himuro.

283
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,590
DREAMLAND

284
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,680
Do you really think Himuro is here?

285
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,660
If l knew, I wouldn't be searching.

286
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:35,310
You're so cold, At-chan.

287
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:38,670
You should act more like Paprika.

288
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,000
I know, I know.

289
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,360
I have a feeling he's near.

290
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,720
Keep quiet, both of you.

291
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:18,670
Watch out!

292
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,080
Himuro?

293
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:37,230
That's-

294
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,230
A DC Mini.

295
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,170
The high pressure holds the grab bag and looks a lot like milk.

296
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,320
The dense forest turns into a shopping district.

297
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,650
The 24-bit eggplant will be analyzed.

298
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:12,430
<i>So you're saying both of them were attacked by way of the DC Mini which broke their psyches.</i>

299
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,800
And the culprit, Kei Himuro,

300
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,810
was also disturbed by the nightmare and tried to commit suicide. Right?

301
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,090
It's not because of the DC Mini!

302
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:30,570
It's just a little incomplete. Himuro knew that.

303
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,430
I'm not refuting your invention.

304
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,550
She's the head of the DC Mini development team.

305
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:47,750
I'm Chiba.

306
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,490
This is Mr. Konakawa
from the police department.

307
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,680
Yes?

308
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,690
Isn't it wonderful?

309
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,280
The ability to see a friend's dream as if it were your own.

310
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,650
To share the same dream.

311
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:16,160
Yes, it probably would be a wonderful experience.

312
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,830
You understand, right?

313
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:26,380
It came to me during a brain scan I was doing using a computer image processor.

314
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:31,380
And you can use it to treat illness.

315
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,780
That's exactly right!

316
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,360
The nonlinear waves created by surges in the bioelectrical current

317
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:45,060
can be applied to create new synapse connections by adjusting the BTU output.

318
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,550
To use a person's body for energy is a remarkable idea.

319
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,970
Exactly! And the reason why I focused....

320
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:58,780
You are talking with Dr. Tokita, right?

321
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,440
That's her, isn't it?

322
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:07,580
Paprika.

323
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:15,240
So, what do you think about this case?

324
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,010
Well, I think it's an accident.

325
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:22,450
It's hard to build a case against a dream.

326
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:27,460
"Isn't it wonderful," eh?

327
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,960
The bulky one.

328
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:35,320
To think such a silly thought would lead to such an invention.

329
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,930
He's a kid trapped inside the body of a genius.

330
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:44,770
It's an adult's responsibility to steer that genius in the right direction.

331
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,670
Chairman.

332
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,170
There is always conceit and negligence behind misconduct.

333
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,180
You have it hard too, I guess.

334
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,010
Good grief.

335
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,870
Where did I go wrong to end up here?

336
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:12,520
I want to go back to our college days back to when we used to talk about our futures.

337
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:28,730
<i>I want to go back to our college days back to when we used to talk about our futures.</i>

338
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,010
<i>But what about the rest of it?</i>

339
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,370
It's too dangerous!

340
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:08,960
Himuro went in and he's not coming back.

341
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,520
If the same happens to you....

342
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,190
There are still two DC Minis out there.

343
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:21,860
Our only lead is inside Himuro.

344
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,140
And besides....

345
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,390
The chairman has already prohibited the use of the therapy machines.

346
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,580
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

347
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,400
Don't worry. The genius boy is here for backup.

348
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,590
Dr. Tokita again?

349
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,960
I know that you two established this field.

350
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,970
So that's all the more reason for you to place your trust in him, but...

351
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,210
...his immaturity is the cause of all these mishaps!

352
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,240
That's why we'll make him take responsibility.

353
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,970
Besides, is there anyone else?

354
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,680
This isn't the time for that.

355
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,240
There are people in the world that understand.

356
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,350
That cop. He has a mind for science.

357
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,500
He doesn't seem very smart, though.

358
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,000
Now all I have to do is set the filtering program for external access and-

359
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,570
What was that for?

360
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:50,270
Do you really think it was Himuro?

361
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:58,770
He's your assistant, and he knew the risks involved with the DC Mini.

362
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,670
He knew what would happen if he exposed himself for that long.

363
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,780
What did he have to gain from it all?

364
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,330
He was jealous of me. Even Osanai says so.

365
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,310
He might be a victim too.

366
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,420
That's like a line from a mystery novel.

367
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,540
If so, then it's still dangerous. We need to confirm-

368
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,200
No more talk.

369
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,570
What I need to do is finish this.

370
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:37,580
You guys really are alike.

371
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,060
At-chan?

372
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,130
You and Himuro.

373
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,590
You get preoccupied with what you want to do and ignore what you have to do.

374
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:50,080
Don't you understand that your irresponsibility cost lives?

375
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,680
Of course not. Nothing can get through all that fat.

376
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,440
And now what? "Isn't it wonderful"? "A mind for science"?

377
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,980
Don't make me laugh.

378
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,740
How can a mad scientist know what a human mind is?

379
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,940
If you want to be the king of geeks with your bloated ego,

380
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,280
then just keep up all this and indulge in your freakish masturbation!

381
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:42,860
And where is Mr. Konakawa now?

382
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,940
At a hotel. It's all here.

383
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,610
I'm counting on you.

384
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,430
There's no doubt. He's here.

385
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,610
You've crossed the line of action.

386
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,770
Be careful. He's a traitor.

387
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,660
You need to narrow the exposure. This is Panfocus.

388
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,690
Now, one, two, three!

389
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,930
There he is! Get him!

390
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,550
Welcome.

391
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,280
What floor?

392
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,780
The guy, I'm after him.

393
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,560
Of course. The fourteenth floor.

394
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,900
Fourteenth floor, the adventure section.

395
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,550
Fifteenth floor, the suspense section.

396
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,040
Sixteenth floor, the romance section.

397
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,480
One more time!

398
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,530
Seventeenth floor, the special section.

399
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:30,740
No!

400
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,490
I don't need to go there.

401
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,900
Encore!

402
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,240
I killed myself?

403
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,830
That's like a line from a mystery novel.

404
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:13,570
It was a rush job, but I put an access function on it.

405
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,030
Morals, responsibilities....

406
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,680
I don't really get that adults' stuff.

407
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,560
But let's talk it over again.

408
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,190
We're friends, right?

409
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,230
Oh, jeez.

410
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:52,920
Was making them not enough? You had to become a doll yourself?

411
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,970
Why did you steal it?

412
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,970
Do you hate me that much?

413
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,000
Or was it not you who did it?

414
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,400
Even with an access function it's not one person's dream anymore.

415
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,670
That's right! The DC Mini was both our dreams!

416
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,070
The crossing of two dreams creates many more dreams.

417
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,850
That's right! The entire development team dreamt of its completion.

418
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:28,520
This is a foolish place to be to inquire about the master of this dream.

419
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,830
The conceit of the daytime residents is what the nighttime residents want.

420
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:38,820
To come in carelessly is like a moth to a flame.

421
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,720
You're not Himuro, are you?

422
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,810
What's the "line of action" that clown was talking about?

423
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:57,190
It's an imaginary line that connects the subjects on camera.

424
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:03,800
If the camera crosses that line the cut is awkward.

425
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:06,970
That's why it has to be like this.

426
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,250
I see. How about "Panfocus"?

427
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:17,730
It's a camera technique where you narrow the angle to get the entire screen in focus.

428
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,450
So you did like them.

429
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,820
Movies.

430
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:26,950
Are your dreams in Panfocus now too?

431
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,100
Have you solved the mystery of why you killed yourself?

432
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:37,090
I've never thought of suicide.

433
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:39,650
Maybe it's someone a lot like you.

434
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,720
Like me?

435
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,160
Or another you.

436
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,660
Another me?

437
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,200
Paprika, is the inside of my head this messed up?

438
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,640
The dreams are merging.

439
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,120
Tokita.

440
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:16,170
He got started without me!

441
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,500
Wait! Tokita!

442
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,980
Hey, Paprika!

443
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,630
Why are you here?

444
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,220
The ecstasy that blooms in synapse is Paprika-brand milk fat!

445
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,950
Five percent is the norm.

446
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,900
Tokita! No!

447
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:40,300
The safety net of the ocean is nonlinear, even with what crabs dream of!

448
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,380
Let's go!

449
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,850
Wake up!

450
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:06,240
So you're saying the dreams of Tokita and Himuro merged into Konakawa's dream?

451
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,200
The anaphylaxis of the DC Mini is expanding exponentially!

452
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,580
Just meet me at the lab.

453
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:26,090
They're not dreaming?

454
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,740
But they're in REM sleep.

455
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,290
It's as if their conscious itself has been taken away.

456
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,860
I guess this calls for Paprika.

457
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:52,050
I'll dive into Himuro's dream. That's the only way to save Tokita.

458
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,180
Chief, can you hear me?

459
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:17,680
Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.

460
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,080
Any abnormalities?

461
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,360
<i>This dream is very dangerous.</i>

462
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,340
<i>If anything happens to Atsuko, use the awakening apparatus.</i>

463
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,300
Of course. But is it really safe?

464
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,370
Tokita is gone because he went into Himuro's dream.

465
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,870
<i>Who do you think I am?</i>

466
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,350
Sorry I doubted you, Paprika.

467
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,120
<i>There they are!</i>

468
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,600
Himuro isn't there.

469
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,230
But it's his dream.

470
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,380
Osanai?

471
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,290
Be careful.

472
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,020
Leave it to me.

473
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,970
Himuro.

474
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,170
Wake her up!

475
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,160
Chief! Hurry!

476
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:08,040
That's not Himuro's dream anymore.

477
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,890
So he was a victim too.

478
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,670
He's an empty shell.

479
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,030
He was invaded by a collective dream.

480
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,030
A collective dream?

481
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:28,540
With no access restrictions the DC Mini can be used to invade any psychotherapy machine.

482
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:37,040
Every dream it came in contact with was eaten up into one huge delusion.

483
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:41,280
And that delusion belongs to....

484
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:56,040
This breath seethes in the joy of life.

485
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:05,410
I will not allow arrogant scientific technology to intrude in this holy ground.

486
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,430
Return Dr. Tokita to us.

487
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:20,170
The dreams are horrified that their safe refuge is destroyed by technology.

488
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,180
Are you going to punish him like you did Himuro?

489
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:34,960
In a world of inhumane reality it is the only humane sanctuary left.

490
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,960
That is a dream.

491
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,920
That parade is full of refugees who were unwillingly chased out of reality.

492
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,140
You are collecting those with stolen technology.

493
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:48,570
Do you plan to take over the world of dreams?

494
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:51,810
I am protecting them.

495
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,750
I am the guardian of dreams.

496
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:00,670
My duty is to mete out justice to terrorists like you, Paprika.

497
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,320
Don't make me get rough with you.

498
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,850
This is a dream too, huh?

499
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:16,330
Paprika, wake up! Paprika!

500
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:17,770
Awakening subject

501
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:18,520
Awakening subject

502
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,230
Awakening subject

503
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:19,650
Awakening subject

504
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:23,650
Wake up, Chiba!

505
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,650
Chiba! Paprika!

506
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,260
The sphinx look doesn't suit you.

507
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:00,460
An intelligent researcher by day the chairman's humble servant by night, is that it?

508
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:04,020
Shut up! l have many faces. That makes me human!

509
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,240
Oedipus is the perfect look for a man completely controlled by the chairman!

510
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,640
Shut up!

511
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:28,030
<i>That's right, keep running.</i>

512
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,990
<i>There are no boundaries to dreams.</i>

513
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:35,370
<i>The spirit will be freed from the constraints of the body and gain limitless freedom.</i>

514
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:36,970
<i>Including me!</i>

515
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,290
<i>l will also be free!</i>

516
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,240
The dream continues from here.

517
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,920
No! Paprika!

518
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,820
It's a trap!

519
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,520
Chief! Wake her up! Hurry!

520
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:03,810
What a lovely sight.

521
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,170
Osanai! What is this? Let me go!

522
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,590
But I finally caught you.

523
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,010
Where is Tokita?

524
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,910
I have no interest in such ugly things.

525
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:24,620
Of course, because you're not. You were Himuro's idol after all.

526
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,000
Shut up! Just shut up!

527
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,750
You sold your body for the DC Mini, didn't you?

528
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,150
Don't remind me!

529
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,220
You coward!

530
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,170
Stop it!

531
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,950
This is my sanctuary, and you'll do as I say.

532
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:45,180
I'm a special person.

533
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,170
Yes, hand-chosen by the chairman.

534
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:49,920
Osanai, you used to be smarter than that.

535
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,460
You don't know its true power!

536
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:59,300
The DC Mini was, in a way, complete.

537
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,700
No, better than complete.

538
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:05,390
We can now go back and forth between dreams and reality...

539
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,460
...even without the DC Mini, while awake.

540
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:11,800
You were the one who set up Atsuko at Himuro's place.

541
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:18,180
It was just a friendly warning to a terrorist threatening dreams.

542
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:22,080
You're just like an old baldy I know.

543
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,290
We are the chosen ones,

544
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:33,010
assigned to protect the sanctuary threatened by technology that has lost its philosophy.

545
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,800
You're just twisted.

546
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,150
You should understand.

547
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:39,530
Dreams are so sacred they cannot be controlled-

548
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:44,410
What would you know? You're just a little man controlled by jealousy.

549
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,270
You really think you can beat Tokita?

550
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:58,510
I warned you, don't make me get rough.

551
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,670
You should call it a night.

552
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,670
Don't worry, I'm drunk.

553
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:19,640
The fact that I know I'm drunk is proof that I'm sober.

554
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:26,600
This isn't a real bar, this isn't real alcohol, and you're not a real bartender.

555
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,370
Right?

556
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,230
I'm sober...

557
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,490
Even if odds and sods go around in my head.

558
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,140
Paprika will come, right?

559
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,000
Do you not like the number 17?

560
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,880
The conspiratorial 17.

561
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:06,810
You're familiar with movies as if you've made them before.

562
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,860
I did. Shot an independent on an 8mm.

563
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,460
It was child's play.

564
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,530
When you were in high school?

565
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,700
When I was 17-

566
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,430
It's a silly cop story.

567
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:51,410
Two men who used to be best friends are now fugitive and cop engaged in a chase.

568
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,900
They just keep running...

569
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,230
...and flashbacks of their past play throughout.

570
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:01,820
Very experimental.

571
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,130
That guy....

572
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,560
How could I have forgotten about him until now?

573
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,880
He was always one step ahead of me.

574
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:20,500
He was smart and popular with the girls.

575
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,070
I could never catch up with him.

576
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,390
I was frustrated at myself for not being frustrated with him.

577
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:32,830
He really was a good guy.

578
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:36,830
We talked about making movies together.

579
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:43,700
But l gave up. I didn't have the confidence.

580
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,260
I left the unfinished movie for him to deal with.

581
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,910
And that friend now?

582
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,160
He died.

583
01:01:55,290 --> 01:01:59,610
He had just gotten accepted to film school, but he was sick.

584
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,800
He didn't tell me.

585
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,760
I betrayed him.

586
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,030
I was his partner. I was his counterpart.

587
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,120
He was the other-

588
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,230
The other me.

589
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,410
But what about the rest of it?!

590
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,850
Wait!

591
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,580
<i>Stop!</i>

592
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:58,810
<i>Why do you dress like a girl?</i>

593
01:02:58,890 --> 01:02:59,480
Paprika!

594
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,090
<i>The real you is more befitting of me.</i>

595
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:04,090
Paprika!

596
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:08,780
Stop, please...

597
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,730
You jealous, perverted prince!

598
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:17,790
You have a bad habit of trying to manipulate people with your words.

599
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,770
And you think you can manipulate people with power?

600
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,170
In here, yes.

601
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,740
I love you.

602
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,290
I love you as you are.

603
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:21,140
I will show no mercy for those who defy me.

604
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,000
Chairman....

605
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,750
You cannot hide anything from me.

606
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:36,120
Chairman, not her. Not her!

607
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,950
Can you not control even one sensual desire?

608
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,340
Please! Please spare her!

609
01:04:47,340 --> 01:04:52,240
Why won't you obey me? You are nothing without me!

610
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:57,490
But I love her.

611
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:08,980
Paprika!

612
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,760
Are you okay?

613
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,160
I knew you were Paprika.

614
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:26,060
What are you doing? You will obey!

615
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:34,910
Disgusting.

616
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:42,810
You fool. Swayed by a mere woman.

617
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:01,510
I'm too anxious to dream!

618
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,230
Konakawa?

619
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:09,040
<i>Shima? Is that you?</i>

620
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,230
Konakawa.

621
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:13,220
Why are you in Chiba's dream?

622
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:14,740
Why are you a monkey?

623
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:15,990
What's going on?

624
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:18,180
I'll explain later. Just go!

625
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,720
Go where?

626
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:22,370
To your dream!

627
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:39,550
Don't get in the way of my dream!

628
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,470
This is my dream. You get out!

629
01:06:51,290 --> 01:06:54,730
I am justice!

630
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:01,240
Freeze!

631
01:07:10,110 --> 01:07:12,900
How's that for traumatic?

632
01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:21,700
What about the rest of it?!

633
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,580
It's coming up right now!

634
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,690
This time, I'll end it!

635
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,320
That hurts.

636
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,060
It's over.

637
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:39,610
Chief.

638
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:43,780
Is this really the real world?

639
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:45,140
I think so.

640
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:48,700
See? It hurt a lot.

641
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,630
But why was Konakawa in your dream?

642
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:02,450
That's right, Paprika was saved by Mr. Konakawa.

643
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:06,810
The chairman and Osanai....

644
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:10,200
Tokita! What about Tokita?

645
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:26,050
Osanai! What's wrong?

646
01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,800
Osanai!

647
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:34,600
No! No! Osanai! You can't go!

648
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:38,360
That body is mine! I will not allow you to act on your own!

649
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,280
My noble spirit needs that body!

650
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:49,430
When the two become one, I will be complete!

651
01:09:55,020 --> 01:09:56,770
Something's wrong.

652
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:59,960
Not just Tokita, but what just happened with Osanai.

653
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:03,820
Don't worry. We just need to get the mastermind.

654
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,840
A happy ending is right around the corner.

655
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:12,120
But that mastermind is lost in his own delusion.

656
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,350
No problem.

657
01:10:14,290 --> 01:10:16,710
We have backup.

658
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:17,900
Mr. Konakawa.

659
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:24,280
The number you called for assisting young children,

660
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:31,810
is not available because of crowded tires in the Pacific Ocean starting at 7:63 a.m.

661
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,280
The battle has ended.

662
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:12,010
Now it's showtime!

663
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:44,190
<i>Today's weather is dreamy and will clear up after a sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny day.</i>

664
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:47,760
The dream I had yesterday and today.

665
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,450
The happy and mundane world will vent their anger.

666
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:55,700
The dreams will grow and grow. Let's grow the tree that blooms money.

667
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,440
It's most valuable while it's still a bud.

668
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,460
That's right, so we shall preserve the memory forever.

669
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:06,570
If there is no flower, there will be no fruit.

670
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,220
If there's nothing, then I won't do anything.

671
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:15,720
If you're unhappy, please put a vote in this eyeball.

672
01:12:16,660 --> 01:12:19,540
Who would give up this throne?

673
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:23,210
I am the emperor, chosen by the lord himself!

674
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:25,230
I didn't choose you!

675
01:12:25,230 --> 01:12:28,760
God and Buddha will change religions.

676
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:35,720
The happy and mundane world will vent their anger.

677
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,310
Am I still dreaming?

678
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:42,940
Yes, the whole world is.

679
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:49,280
You forgot this.

680
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,700
Thank you.

681
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:54,210
Now, let's go.

682
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,490
To clean up this mess.

683
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,900
Dreams and reality are merging?

684
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:12,510
Is this because of the DC Mini too?

685
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:23,980
Chief! Hold on!

686
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,890
Paprika?

687
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:44,330
No time for questions. Hurry up!

688
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,510
Why are you here?

689
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:52,650
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

690
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:55,760
<i>Is this reality?</i>

691
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:59,660
<i>Hurry! We have to get the mastermind!</i>

692
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:01,970
<i>It's as if we're in a dream.</i>

693
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,900
Hurry!

694
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:10,670
Don't get ahead of yourself, Paprika!

695
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,800
Don't think you're always right.

696
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,000
Tokita.

697
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,830
Let's go, Atsuko.

698
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,650
I have to help Tokita.

699
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:55,090
Leave that irresponsible fatso.

700
01:14:56,610 --> 01:15:01,100
Why don't you listen? You're a part of me!

701
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,480
Have you ever thought that maybe you are a part of me?

702
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,930
Do as I say!

703
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:12,590
To think that you can control yourself and others.

704
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:14,940
You're just like an old baldy I know.

705
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,720
Let's go. We need to stop that old baldy and his excursions.

706
01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:25,380
Now!

707
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:25,950
No!

708
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:29,710
I can't just leave Tokita because I....

709
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:33,090
Because what?

710
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:40,360
Chiba!

711
01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:44,600
She's become true to herself, hasn't she?

712
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,600
An overweight spirit needs no diet!

713
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,040
Go forward, superhero, to anywhere you please!

714
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:54,610
Tokita, wake up! It's me!

715
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:58,420
The one I've been waiting for since historic times!

716
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:01,090
Your flute's melody is a sound for sore neurons!

717
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,620
Yes, try to remember.

718
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,240
Atsuko, the one you like! It's me, At-chan!

719
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:12,600
A fragrant fat is a first-class lunch!

720
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:18,280
It needs a little more spice.

721
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:21,220
Maybe a little paprika?

722
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:44,930
What is this?

723
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,930
A big hole.

724
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,370
I can see that!

725
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:51,550
It's connected.

726
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,560
To the other world.

727
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,730
The other- You mean...?

728
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,940
What should we do, Paprika?

729
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,790
Run?

730
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:05,080
You think so too?

731
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:16,250
Well-rounded achievement is missing a spice.

732
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:18,440
Paprika found!

733
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,040
Hey!

734
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:37,790
Paprika! Shima! Are you two okay?

735
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,670
Mr. Konakawa!

736
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:41,710
Konakawa.

737
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,060
Chiba?

738
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,590
I'm in a bind.

739
01:18:08,890 --> 01:18:10,200
I can see that.

740
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:16,540
It's not that!

741
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,790
Sorry.

742
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:39,540
You're such a slob.

743
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:41,210
I know.

744
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:45,990
You're fat, slow and sloppy.

745
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:52,390
It's not the outside that counts, but there's a limit to that too.

746
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,230
Yeah.

747
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:59,250
To think, a food disposal like you is the genius of the century.

748
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,000
I swallow everything.

749
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:08,820
I know. You're so much fun.

750
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,520
Atsuko is dreaming.

751
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,090
What is that?

752
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:35,790
Our chairman!

753
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:38,460
I feel great!

754
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:41,790
I am reborn!

755
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:51,200
Look! I am standing! With my own legs!

756
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,550
I am perfect!

757
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:57,560
I can control the dreams, and even death!

758
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:06,440
Now, to make the cosmos complete, I shall heal all deficiencies!

759
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,850
Way to go, Lord of Darkness!

760
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:18,000
Light and dark. Reality and dreams. Life and death. Man and...?

761
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,520
-Woman?
-Woman?

762
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:23,520
Then you add the missing spice.

763
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,500
-Paprika?
-Paprika?

764
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:27,570
Bingo.

765
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:35,760
Paprika!

766
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,830
The new cosmos begins with me!

767
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,150
Who is eating up my dream?

768
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,640
Is that Paprika?

769
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,790
Well, it's a girl.

770
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,240
Why won't you obey?

771
01:22:57,550 --> 01:23:01,140
Have we awoken from the dream?

772
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,310
I just had the best dream.

773
01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:30,250
I had a good dream too. The first in a long time.

774
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,790
I guess I've been dumped.

775
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:46,560
You mean you were serious?

776
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,500
But Paprika is a woman in your dreams.

777
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:54,020
That's true. I'll see her in my dreams again some day.

778
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:59,360
How are your dreams going?

779
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,320
I almost forgot about it.

780
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:04,260
Did you find out what was causing it?

781
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,270
The cause....

782
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:13,270
<i>You didn't do anything wrong.</i>

783
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,300
You just lived out our movie in real life.

784
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:22,530
That's why you became a cop.

785
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,290
It's truth that came from fiction. Always remember that.

786
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,620
Yeah, all the truths and the fiction.

787
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,140
<i>Welcome.</i>

788
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,640
<i>I have a message for you from Miss Paprika.</i>

789
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:54,520

919

In the distant sky, twirling flowers form a clamorous circle

920
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:29,970
And it wakes up the turning point you passed through on that day, on that day

921
01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:38,020
In a form of a shimmer, you chase the girl who points the way

922
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:46,210
Then you find a nameless and nostalgic field on a hill

923
01:26:54,300 --> 01:27:02,010
"That is the city I let you see in your dream", whispered a shadow

924
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:10,000
Day after day , day after day, when you have passed through countless turning points

925
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:18,050
a sage in the dimness will collect discarded days

926
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:26,120
Along the shore, along the shore, he makes an unknown flame dance

927
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:41,990
Ah, mantle loquaciously throws up a flame

928
01:27:41,990 --> 01:27:50,050
to congratulate the person who stands on the abandoned field

929
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:58,030
Ah, in the girl's silent, silent view

930
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:06,240
Ah, lights begin to shine in the unseen city

931
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:46,020
High up in the sky, dyed in vermillion, clouds arise like a fire burning

932
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:54,030
It shows you the way you lost on that day, on that day

933
01:28:54,030 --> 01:29:02,000
Chasing the wind blowing repeatedly in your dream, you go down the flow of time

934
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:10,190
Along the river, along the river, you saw an unknown flower of felicity

935
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:21,980
Ah, mantle loquaciously throws up a flame

936
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:30,010
to congratulate the person who stands on the abandoned field

937
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:38,010
Ah, in the girl's silent, silent view

938
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:45,990
Ah, lights begin to shine in the unseen city

939
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:54,000
Ah, mantle loquaciously throws up a flame

940
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:02,020
to congratulate the person who stands on the abandoned field

941
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:10,030
Ah, in the girl's silent, silent view

942
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:18,240
Ah, lights begin to shine in the unseen city
