00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Paprika (2006) Sub ENG

2
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:54,650
It's The Greatest Show time!

3
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:25,317
There's no doubt. He's here.

4
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,246
Who?

5
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,255
Be careful. He's a traitor.

6
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,755
There's someone who keeps looking at you.

7
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:34,360
See?

8
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,723
It's okay, he's a friend.

9
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:42,499
Please turn your attention to this gentleman!

10
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,402
Now ...

11
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:47,039
One... two... three!

12
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,347
There he is! Get him!

13
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:15,433
Grab my hand!

14
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,035
I let him get away again!

15
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,910
Aren't you the one who got away?

16
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,649
One more time!

17
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,756
Take that!

18
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,670
But what about the rest of it?

19
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,587
You were in my dream.

20
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:51,620
Everyone is startled at first.

21
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,462
The DC Mini.

22
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,662
It's the scientific key that allows us
to open the door to our dreams.

23
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,171
It can even do all this?

24
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,807
It really is a dream machine.

25
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:11,816
To tell you the truth,
the DC Mini is still incomplete.

26
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:17,184
Once complete, we'll be able to
enter your dream even while awake.

27
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,954
You said he was a friend.

28
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:25,494
We used to work together.

29
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,532
Why did he put you in a cage?

30
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,234
I don't know.

31
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,838
He's not the kind of person who would trick me.

32
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,145
Why are they all me?

33
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,578
That was really disturbing.

34
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,348
This is Tarzan, right?

35
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,486
This looks like a scene from a spy movie?

36
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,186
The fighting was rather fun.

37
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:59,623
REM sleep, that occurs later during the sleep
cycle is longer and easier to analyze.

38
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:03,460
If earlier cycles are, say, artsy film shorts,

39
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,539
then later cycles are like
feature-length blockbuster movies.

40
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:14,078
Then that makes you... a dream movie star.

41
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,449
Do you not like movies?

42
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:19,279
It's not that.

43
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:22,853
What is this?

44
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,157
The victim in the homicide
case I'm working on right now.

45
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:29,089
I haven't been able to catch the perp,

46
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,721
so maybe that's why I...

47
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,062
Your anxiety neurosis.

48
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,897
Do you think this is the source?

49
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,870
No need to rush.

50
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,031
The treatment's just getting started.

51
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,241
Take care, Captain Konakawa.

52
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,784
When can I see you again?

53
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:14,950
I'm in a bind.

54
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,931
I can see that.

55
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,558
No, it's not that.

56
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,929
I was on my way to see you.

57
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:29,340
It's not that! The DC Mini!

58
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,008
It was stolen? The DC Mini?

59
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:37,348
We found out this morning.

60
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,514
Three samples in Dr. Tokita's
possession were stolen.

61
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,718
But why?

62
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:49,192
We'll worry about the reason later.
We need to find them now.

63
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,960
Do you think it's internal?

64
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,658
Unfortunately.

65
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,505
We'll talk about that later.

66
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,665
- Foundation for Psychiatric Research -

67
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,766
Meet me in my office.
We'll figure out a plan...

68
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,643
...before the chairman finds out.

69
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,713
Yes, we have to protect the DC Mini.

70
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:20,149
It's too bad it was stolen, but all we
have to do is make another one.

71
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,121
You should know better than anyone
what can happen if it's misused.

72
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,391
You invented it.

73
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:31,134
I make it, but how it's
used is your job, At-chan.

74
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,541
Don't call me At-chan.

75
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,277
There is one more problem.

76
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,650
Good grief.

77
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:51,323
I hadn't programmed the access
controls into the DC Mini yet.

78
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,052
Translate that for me.

79
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,626
It means that the person
who stole the DC Mini...

80
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,426
...can connect to a psychotherapy
machine at any time, from any place...

81
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:06,400
...and use it to intrude into the
minds connected to that machine.

82
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,400
- Chief's Office -

83
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,840
I see. We have to hurry.

84
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,887
It is man's responsibility to
control science and technology.

85
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:27,250
Chairman.

86
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:33,764
Sharing in another's dream. It is quite
literally a technological dream...

87
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,167
...but, in time, it can lead to violence.

88
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,840
It was an invention that never
should have been created.

89
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,268
This discussion again?

90
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:52,975
The DC Mini represents the hope that shines
on the new horizons of psychiatric treatment.

91
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,481
It is taking control over dreams.
Your overconfidence will bring weakness.

92
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,650
It is not about control.

93
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:05,989
We are simply pursuing
a deeper connection with our patients.

94
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,398
The terrorist who stole
it won't see it that way.

95
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,641
But it hasn't even been misused yet.

96
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:21,978
Thieves are not always wrong.

97
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,748
Paprika.

98
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:31,981
I hear there's a woman who's been using the
psychotherapy machine for unapproved treatments.

99
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,550
Are you going to believe...

100
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,219
...such groundless rumours, chairman?

101
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:39,189
Discipline calls for a search of the DC Mini,

102
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:42,995
rather than Paprika's bikini.
This is true happiness.

103
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:45,971
Discipline?

104
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:51,542
Even the five court ladies danced in
sync to the frog's flutes and drums.

105
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:55,375
The whirlwind of the recycled
paper was a sight to see.

106
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,980
It was like computer graphics!

107
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,918
That I don't support Technicolor parfaits,

108
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:08,255
and snobby petit bourgeois
is common knowledge in Oceania!

109
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:11,529
Now is the time to return home to the blue sky!

110
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:15,535
The confetti will dance around the shrine gates.

111
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:20,063
The mailbox and the refrigerator will lead the way!

112
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:28,270
Anyone who cares about expiration dates,
will not get in the way of the glory train!

113
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,815
They need to fully realize
the lives of the triangle rulers!

114
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:36,012
Now, this festival was decided,

115
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:40,360
by the third grade class
with the telephoto camera!

116
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,692
Move forward! Come together!
I am the ultimate...

117
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,456
...governor!

118
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,126
Chief!

119
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:51,535
Now!

120
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,831
Right now!

121
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:56,498
Take me in!

122
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,542
He has the dream of a patient
planted into his brain.

123
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,542
How's the chief doing?

124
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,047
His breathing and pulse are stable.

125
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,587
I guess it could've been worse.

126
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,590
Dr. Chiba, here are the chief's medical records.

127
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:52,796
Thank you.

128
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:57,265
He was probably using the therapy
machine to treat a patient...

129
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,236
When someone used a DC Mini to intrude.

130
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:05,401
And the dream was projected into
his subconscious without him knowing.

131
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,271
But for that to happen...

132
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,146
The culprit has to be watching this nightmare too.

133
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,176
What a desperate terrorist.

134
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,581
All terrorists are desperate.

135
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:22,156
The sun during midday will
light up the dark night.

136
00:14:22,628 --> 00:14:24,687
Night dreams of day.

137
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,158
Light dreams of darkness.

138
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:31,125
But the ignorant sun...

139
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,830
will chase away the darkness,

140
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,265
and burn the shadows,
eventually burning itself!

141
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:38,874
Himuro!

142
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,915
The shade of the tree with the
flowers that bloom at night...

143
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,382
... is where the residents of darkness rest.

144
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:47,878
Why is Himuro in there!

145
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,546
The people of daytime are nut allowed!

146
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,520
Where is Himuro?

147
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:02,427
He's been out for the past few days,
but I didn't think too much of it.

148
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:09,231
Himuro tends to abandon everything else,
when he really gets into something.

149
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,607
Like doctor, like assistant.

150
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,277
How could we have not seen this coming?

151
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,252
I thought he was my friend.

152
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:28,556
A genius produces a lot more than he realizes.

153
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,328
More clearly, please.

154
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:34,194
Himuro was jealous of Dr. Tokita.

155
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,900
Even I feel bitter towards
you sometimes, Dr. Chiba.

156
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:42,434
No matter how hard I try,
I'm not as good as you.

157
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:45,503
I feel powerless.

158
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:02,926
It's open.

159
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,061
You mean you opened it.

160
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,698
This is illegal, you know.

161
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,725
I'm not as bad as Himuro, though.

162
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,437
Welcome home. Welcome back.

163
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,820
He can't be serious.

164
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,315
This is dangerous.

165
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,376
This isn't your cue.

166
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,438
Anaphylaxis?

167
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,717
Like an allergy?

168
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,950
I can't think of any other reason.

169
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,219
I got stung by a jellyfish when I was a kid...

170
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:51,192
...and even now, I have allergic
reactions at the sight of one.

171
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,460
It didn't occur to me until now.

172
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,266
Here you go.

173
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,428
Who had the udon set?

174
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,868
But the DC Mini uses a transmission formula...

175
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,470
...within the natural width
of the body's energy level.

176
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,877
Who had the jumbo steak set?

177
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:16,384
Depending on the frequency of use,
the body might adapt to it.

178
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:22,460
And as a result, Dr. Chiba, who has had the
most exposure was more susceptible to invasion...

179
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:28,399
...even when she wasn't connected to
the DC Mini, nor was she asleep.

180
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,035
Who had the paella?

181
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,640
I think you have a problem too.

182
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,465
Like overeating.

183
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,475
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

184
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:43,377
Fight?

185
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:47,783
Implanting dreams into other
people's heads is terrorism.

186
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,926
At-chan, you said that Himuro and I were alike.

187
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,991
I think so too.

188
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,960
All the more reason this is unforgivable.

189
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:11,473
Hello?

190
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,138
We'll be there immediately.

191
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,792
Chief! Please, come back!

192
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:35,394
Wake up! Chief!

193
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,370
The delicious left brain is getting older...

194
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:42,201
...and drifting to a faraway island.

195
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,480
Himuro, give him back!

196
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:54,311
I, who stand before you,
am the protector of your dreams.

197
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:01,319
I wonder what kind of punishment
will befall the ignorant commoner...

198
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,985
...who tries to enter this sacred dream?

199
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,572
You're the feisty country
girl I saved some time ago.

200
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,000
How are you?

201
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:24,744
If he was not home when
I passed by around 7:30...

202
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:28,183
...then he probably disappeared
into the instant noodle soup.

203
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,379
Thank you for saving me.

204
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,449
I have come to show you my appreciation.

205
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,853
Is it a square?

206
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,860
No.

207
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,735
It's round, like this.

208
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,206
I can feel it.

209
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:52,907
Paprika.

210
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,642
Do you remember me now?

211
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,172
I'm going to be a little rough.

212
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,948
Paprika, what are you doing?

213
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,657
Now, now, stop that.

214
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,805
Welcome back, Chief.

215
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,975
I wonder where that parade was going?

216
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,506
A place of no return, most likely.

217
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:38,353
I felt like I was really close...

218
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,918
...to controlling the entire world.

219
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,186
That was a dream of a
severely delusional patient.

220
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,703
While you were in there,
your brain waves and body deteriorated...

221
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,170
...almost to the point of death.

222
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:54,738
That's why Paprika came.

223
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,300
Thank you.

224
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:02,706
You haven't changed since the time you
treated my depression two years ago.

225
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,949
I'll let Paprika know.

226
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:14,021
But to think that that
honest Himuro was responsible.

227
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,994
What should I do now, Dr. Chiba?

228
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:19,987
Please don't do anything.

229
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,691
What?

230
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:30,739
The chairman will probably halt the development
of the DC Mini as a result of this incident.

231
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,979
But with you, a board member, in the hospital...

232
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:37,915
They can't have a meeting.

233
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,385
Hello? Oh, Konakawa.

234
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:49,886
How was the? You know.

235
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:55,461
I would have asked sooner,
if I had known that it would be this good.

236
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:57,569
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

237
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,896
I want to keep it a secret all to myself.

238
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:04,098
Paprika's existence cannot become public...

239
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,709
... until the psychotherapy
machines gain public approval.

240
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,646
She really is a woman of your dreams.

241
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,783
Women of dreams are busy these days.

242
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,616
You look tired.

243
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:18,789
Want me to look in on your dreams?

244
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,191
I haven't been seeing any of my own lately.

245
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,631
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

246
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:12,801
Good evening.

247
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,578
What is this place?

248
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,487
A counselling room.

249
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,454
A meeting place. A date spot.

250
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:30,328
Don't you think dreams
and the internet are similar?

251
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:33,863
They are both areas where
the repressed conscious mind vents.

252
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:35,793
Here you go.

253
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,671
Have you found anything?

254
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,479
In regards to my dreams?

255
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:54,882
You're so impatient.

256
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,687
Do you work at the research foundation?

257
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,492
It was Shima who introduced me, after all.

258
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,664
Where do you know Mr. Shima from?

259
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,198
He's a friend from college.

260
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,869
We got along pretty well,
so we always hung out.

261
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:16,307
Drinking and watching movies?

262
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:21,168
No, movies don't interest me.

263
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,940
I love them!

264
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:26,878
Paprika?

265
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,452
Put it on my tab.

266
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,654
Hey, Paprika!

267
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:52,041
Which one do you want to see?

268
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:55,775
I'm sorry, but movies really aren't my thing.

269
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,547
Come on, hurry!

270
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,681
I don't like movies!

271
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,056
Hey, Tsumura, stop...

272
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:12,486
Breaking news!

273
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:16,757
The widow who tells fortunes
in the shade of roof tiles!

274
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:18,130
The response is sunny!

275
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,767
The sign is good fortune!

276
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:22,897
The ceiling fan brings a
message releasing epithets!

277
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,509
The maiden who sleeps under
the veranda has a pulse!

278
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,668
This is the way out!

279
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,440
The secret of this view is deep
within the 10-year loan payment!

280
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,485
They are new victims.

281
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,589
I am stopping development.

282
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,217
But the board meeting...

283
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,328
The culprit won't wait for
a board meeting to happen.

284
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:52,233
I am forbidding all use of the DC Mini
and the psychotherapy machines.

285
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,269
This is retribution.

286
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:05,049
Science is nothing but a piece of
trash before a profound dream.

287
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,490
Are you okay?

288
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:21,761
I heard the parts are non-recyclable.

289
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,661
But that's an important piece of equipment.

290
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,668
I'll just have to make it again.

291
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,041
He's a genius.

292
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:39,583
He's a mysterious one, all right.

293
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,952
You're giving him too much credit.

294
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:44,652
He's just a kid inside.

295
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,533
- DREAMLAND -

296
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,634
- DREAMLAND - It was a small
theme park, but I liked it as a kid.

297
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,034
It was a small theme park,
but I liked it as a kid.

298
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,438
I used to talk about it with Himuro.

299
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,391
Do you really think Himuro is here?

300
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,499
If I knew, I wouldn't be searching.

301
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,938
You're so cold, At-chan.

302
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,506
You should act more like Paprika.

303
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,678
I know, I know.

304
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,181
I have a feeling he's near.

305
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:45,542
Keep quiet, both of you.

306
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:17,744
Watch out!

307
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,298
Himuro?

308
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,063
That's...

309
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:39,063
A DC Mini.

310
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,788
The high pressure holds the grab bag
and looks a lot like milk.

311
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:00,949
The high pressure holds the grab bag
and looks a lot like milk.

312
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:05,329
The dense forest turns into a shopping district.
The 24-bit eggplant will be analyzed.

313
00:31:05,497 --> 00:31:11,766
Su you’re saying both of them were attacked by
way of the DC Mini which broke their psyches.

314
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:18,844
And the culprit, Kei Himuru, was also disturbed
by the nightmare and tried to commit suicide.

315
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:20,607
Is that right?

316
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,981
It's not because of the DC Mini!

317
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,917
It's just a little incomplete.

318
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,388
Himuro knew that.

319
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:35,187
I'm not refuting your invention.

320
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:45,861
She's the head of the DC Mini development team.

321
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47,435
I'm Chiba.

322
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,665
This is Mr. Konakawa from the police department.

323
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:00,146
Yes?

324
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,377
Isn't it wonderful?

325
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:07,750
The ability to see a friend's
dream as if it were your own.

326
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,023
To share the same dream.

327
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,000
Yes, it probably would be
a wonderful experience.

328
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,168
You understand, right?

329
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:26,208
It came to me during a brain scan I was doing,
using a computer image processor.

330
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,211
And you can use it to treat illness.

331
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:32,950
That's exactly right!

332
00:32:33,752 --> 00:32:38,018
The nonlinear waves created by
surges in the bioelectrical current...

333
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:44,891
...can be applied to create new synapse
connections by adjusting the BTU output.

334
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:52,435
To use a person's body for
energy is a remarkable idea.

335
00:32:52,571 --> 00:32:53,560
Exactly!

336
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:54,840
And the reason why I focused...

337
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,740
You are talking with Dr. Tokita, right?
And the reason why I focused...

338
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,072
You are talking with Dr. Tokita, right?

339
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,808
That's her, isn't it?

340
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,375
Paprika.

341
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:14,319
So what do you think about this case?

342
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,828
Well, I think it's an accident.

343
00:33:18,964 --> 00:33:21,899
It's hard to build a case against a dream.

344
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:27,332
"Isn't it wonderful," eh?

345
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:29,401
The bulky one.

346
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,871
To think such a silly thought
would lead to such an invention.

347
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,611
He's a kid trapped inside the body of a genius.

348
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,382
It's an adult's responsibility to steer
that genius in the right direction.

349
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:45,778
Chairman.

350
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,989
There is always conceit and
negligence behind misconduct.

351
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,968
You have it hard too, I guess.

352
00:33:58,403 --> 00:33:59,836
Good grief.

353
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:05,099
Where did I go wrong to end up here?

354
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:11,908
I want to go back to our college days,
back to when we used to talk about our futures.

355
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,320
I want to go back to our college days...

356
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:29,192
... back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

357
00:34:57,495 --> 00:34:59,292
But what about the rest of it?

358
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:04,969
It's too dangerous!

359
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:08,730
Himuro went in and he's not coming back.

360
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,940
If the same happens to you...

361
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:16,879
There are still two DC Minis out there.

362
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,949
Our only lead is inside Himuro.

363
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:22,717
And besides...

364
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:28,223
The chairman has already prohibited
the use of the therapy machines.

365
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,922
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

366
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:36,191
Don't worry.
The genius boy is here for backup.

367
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:39,068
Dr. Tokita again?

368
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,801
I know that you two established this field...

369
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:50,075
...so that's all the more reason for you
to place your trust in him,

370
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:50,779
but...

371
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,051
...his immaturity is the
cause of all these mishaps!

372
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,585
That's why we'll make him take responsibility.

373
00:35:59,224 --> 00:36:01,749
Besides, is there anyone else?

374
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,970
This isn't the time for that.

375
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:25,047
There are people in the world that understand.

376
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,311
That cop.

377
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:29,880
He has a mind for science.

378
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,322
He doesn't seem very smart, though.

379
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:37,417
Now, all I have to do is set the filtering
program for external access and...

380
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:41,632
What was that for?

381
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:50,102
Do you really think it was Himuro?

382
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:58,148
He's your assistant, and he knew
the risks involved with the DC Mini.

383
00:36:59,117 --> 00:37:02,280
He knew what would happen,
if he exposed himself for that long.

384
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:04,581
What did he have to gain from it all?

385
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,918
He was jealous of me.

386
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,150
Even Osanai says so.

387
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,417
He might be a victim too.

388
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,232
That's like a line from a mystery novel.

389
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,098
If so, then it's still dangerous.

390
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,103
We need to confirm...

391
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,799
No more talk.

392
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:28,078
What I need to do is finish this.

393
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,088
You guys really are alike.

394
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,578
At-chan?

395
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:40,751
You and Himuro.

396
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:45,120
You get preoccupied with what you want to do,
and ignore what you have to do.

397
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:49,490
Don't you understand that your
irresponsibility cost lives?

398
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,428
Of course not.

399
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,504
Nothing can get through all that fat.

400
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:56,766
And now what? "Isn't it wonderful"?

401
00:37:56,908 --> 00:37:58,307
"A mind for science"?

402
00:37:58,476 --> 00:37:59,807
Don't make me laugh.

403
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:03,209
How can a mad scientist know
what a human mind is?

404
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:07,640
If you want to be the king of geeks
with your bloated ego...

405
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:11,552
...then just keep up all this and
indulge in your freakish masturbation!

406
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:42,750
And where is Mr. Konakawa now?

407
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,321
At a hotel. It's all here.

408
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,859
I'm counting on you.

409
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:08,273
There's no doubt. He's here.

410
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,438
You've crossed the line of action.

411
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,451
Be careful. He's a traitor.

412
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:19,487
You need to narrow the exposure.
This is Panfocus.

413
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,450
Now...

414
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:27,063
one... two... three!

415
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,702
There he is! Get him!

416
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,908
Welcome.

417
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:50,048
What floor?

418
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:55,619
The guy, I'm after him.

419
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,994
Of course. The 14th floor.

420
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,565
Fourteenth floor, the adventure section.

421
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,673
Fifteenth floor, the suspense section.

422
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,846
Sixteenth floor, the romance section.

423
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:23,976
One more time!

424
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,221
Seventeenth floor, the special section.

425
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,156
No!

426
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,330
I don't need to go there.

427
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,296
Encore!

428
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:53,770
I... killed... myself?

429
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,479
That's like a line from a mystery novel.

430
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:14,227
It was a rush job, but I put
an access function on it.

431
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,801
Morals, responsibilities...

432
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,529
I don't really get that adults' stuff.

433
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,703
But let's talk it over again.

434
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,738
We're friends, right?

435
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,392
Oh, jeez.

436
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,862
Was making them not enough?

437
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,732
You had to become a doll yourself?

438
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,803
Why did you steal it?

439
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,572
Do you hate me that much?

440
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:06,877
Or was it not you who did it?

441
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:11,217
Even with an access function,
it's not one person's dream anymore.

442
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,424
That's right!
The DC Mini was both our dreams!

443
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,893
The crossing of two dreams,
creates many more dreams.

444
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,556
That's right!

445
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:23,561
The entire development team
dreamt of its completion.

446
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,668
This is a foolish place to be...

447
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,267
...to inquire about the master of this dream.

448
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:32,672
The conceit of the daytime residents,
is what the nighttime residents want.

449
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:38,078
To come in carelessly is
like a moth to a flame.

450
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:42,549
You're not Himuro, are you?

451
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:50,617
What's the line of action
that clown was talking about?

452
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,493
It's an imaginary line...

453
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,032
...that connects the subjects on camera.

454
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,269
If the camera crosses that line...

455
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:04,640
...the cut is awkward.

456
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,810
That's why it has to be like this.

457
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,674
I see. How about Panfocus?

458
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,978
It's a camera technique...

459
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:17,417
...where you narrow the angle
to get the entire screen in focus.

460
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,417
So you did like them.

461
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:23,587
Movies.

462
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:26,288
Are your dreams in Panfocus now too?

463
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,594
Have you solved the mystery
of why you killed yourself?

464
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:36,431
I've never... thought of suicide.

465
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,474
Maybe it's someone a lot like you.

466
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,168
Like me?

467
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,978
Or another you.

468
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,480
Another me?

469
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:05,697
Paprika, is the inside of
my head this messed up?

470
00:45:06,871 --> 00:45:09,271
The dreams are merging.

471
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:12,006
Tokita.

472
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,568
He got started without me!

473
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,206
Wait! Tokita!

474
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:18,781
Paprika!

475
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:21,809
Why are you here?

476
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:26,750
The ecstasy that blooms in synapse
is Paprika-brand milk fat!

477
00:45:27,291 --> 00:45:28,758
Five percent is the norm.

478
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,827
Tokita! No!

479
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:40,668
The safety net of the ocean is nonlinear,
even with what crabs dreams of!

480
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,133
Let's go!

481
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,639
Wake up!

482
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:00,552
So you're saying...

483
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:06,021
...the dreams of Tokita and Himuro
merged into Konakawa's dream?

484
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:10,858
The anaphylaxis of the DC Mini
is expanding exponentially!

485
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:13,326
Just meet me at the lab.

486
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,912
They're not dreaming?

487
00:46:26,651 --> 00:46:28,346
But they're in REM sleep.

488
00:46:29,754 --> 00:46:35,021
It's as if...
their conscious itself has been taken away.

489
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,699
I guess this calls for Paprika.

490
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,536
I'll dive into Himuro's dream.

491
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:51,608
That's the only way to save Tokita.

492
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,995
Chief, can you hear me?

493
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:17,058
Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.

494
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,627
Any abnormalities?

495
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:22,130
This dream is very dangerous.

496
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:27,070
If anything happens to Atsuko,
use the awakening apparatus.

497
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,268
Of course.

498
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:35,182
But is it really safe? Tokita is gone
because he went into Himuro's dream.

499
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:36,685
Who do you think I am?

500
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:40,181
I'm sorry to have doubted you.

501
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:40,949
There they are!

502
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,269
Himuro isn't there.

503
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,947
But it's his dream.

504
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,501
Osanai?

505
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,916
Be careful.

506
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:48,914
Leave it to me.

507
00:51:00,124 --> 00:51:01,056
Himuro.

508
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:36,387
Wake her up!

509
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,025
Chief! Hurry!

510
00:52:03,854 --> 00:52:07,255
That's not Himuro's dream anymore.

511
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:10,722
So he was a victim too.

512
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:15,063
He's an empty shell.

513
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:18,860
He was invaded by a collective dream.

514
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,766
A collective dream?

515
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:28,371
With no access restrictions the DC Mini can
be used to invade any psychotherapy machine.

516
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:36,884
Every dream it came in contact with
was eaten up into one huge delusion.

517
00:52:38,122 --> 00:52:41,148
And that delusion belongs to...

518
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:55,899
This breath seethes in the joy of life.

519
00:52:56,774 --> 00:53:05,239
I will not allow arrogant scientific
technology to intrude in this holy ground.

520
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:09,051
Return Dr. Tokita to us.

521
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:19,886
The dreams are horrified that their
safe refuge is destroyed by technology.

522
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,960
Are you going to punish
him like you did Himuro?

523
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:34,836
In a world of inhumane reality it
is the only humane sanctuary left.

524
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,707
That is a dream.

525
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:42,752
That parade is full of refugees who
were unwillingly chased out of reality.

526
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,616
You are collecting those
with stolen technology.

527
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:49,393
Do you plan to take over
the world of dreams?

528
00:53:49,393 --> 00:53:51,588
I am protecting them.

529
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,562
I am the guardian of dreams.

530
00:53:55,866 --> 00:54:00,496
My duty is to mete out justice
to terrorists like you, Paprika.

531
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:07,566
Don't make me get rough with you.

532
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:12,114
This is a dream too, huh?

533
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:15,919
Paprika, wake up! Paprika!

534
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,486
Wake up, Chiba!

535
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,489
Chiba! Paprika!

536
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,081
The sphinx look doesn't suit you.

537
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,959
An intelligent researcher by day,
the chairman's humble servant by night.

538
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:00,085
Is that it?

539
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:01,092
Shut up!

540
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,859
I have many faces. That makes me human!

541
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:08,933
Oedipus is the perfect look for a man
completely controlled by the chairman!

542
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:10,536
Shut up!

543
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,854
That's right, keep running.

544
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,822
There are no boundaries to dreams.

545
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,988
The spirit will be freed from the constraints
of the body and gain limitless freedom.

546
00:55:35,132 --> 00:55:36,759
Including me!

547
00:55:38,602 --> 00:55:41,537
I will also be free!

548
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:56,084
The dream continues from here.

549
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,356
No! Paprika!

550
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:11,898
It's a trap!

551
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,707
Chief! Wake her up!

552
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,281
Please hurry!

553
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,080
What a lovely sight.

554
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:06,047
Osanai!

555
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,383
What is this? Let me go!

556
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,889
But I finally caught you.

557
00:57:11,662 --> 00:57:14,153
Where is Tokita?

558
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:17,523
I have no interest in such ugly things.

559
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,596
Of course, because you're not.

560
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:24,440
You were Himuro's idol after all.

561
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:25,835
Shut up! Just shut up!

562
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:28,576
You sold your body for the DC Mini, didn't you?

563
00:57:29,513 --> 00:57:30,844
Don't remind me!

564
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,048
You coward!

565
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,012
Stop it!

566
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:39,083
This is my sanctuary, and you'll do as I say.

567
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,960
I'm a special person.

568
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,960
Yes, hand-chosen by the chairman.

569
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,691
Osanai, you used to be smarter than that.

570
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,631
You don't know it’s true power!

571
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,732
The DC Mini was, in a way, complete.

572
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,971
No, better than complete.

573
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:08,273
We can now go back and forth between dreams and
reality even without the DC Mini, while awake.

574
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:12,618
You were the one who set up
Atsuko at Himuro's place.

575
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:17,990
It was just a friendly warning
to a terrorist threatening dreams.

576
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,658
You're just like an old baldy I know.

577
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:27,968
We are the chosen ones,
assigned to protect the sanctuary...

578
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:32,769
...threatened by technology
that has lost its philosophy.

579
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,410
You're just twisted.

580
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:35,973
You should understand.

581
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,344
Dreams are so sacred,
they cannot be controlled...

582
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:44,510
What would you know? You're just a
little man controlled by jealousy.

583
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:49,150
You really think you can beat Tokita?

584
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:58,227
I warned you, don't make me get rough.

585
00:59:10,347 --> 00:59:12,474
You should call it a night.

586
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:15,446
Don't worry, I'm drunk.

587
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:19,486
The fact that I know I'm
drunk is proof that I'm sober.

588
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:26,060
This isn't a real bar and this isn't real
alcohol, and you're not a real bartender.

589
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:28,191
Right?

590
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,828
I'm sober...

591
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:38,238
...even if odds and sods go around in my head.

592
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,974
Paprika will come, right?

593
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:52,649
Do you not like the number 17?

594
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,321
The conspiratorial 17.

595
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:06,435
You're familiar with movies,
as if you've made them before.

596
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:10,471
I did.

597
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,303
Shot an independent on an 8 mm.

598
01:00:13,844 --> 01:00:15,539
It was child's play.

599
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:17,279
When you were in high school?

600
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:19,444
When I was 17...

601
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,198
It's a silly cop story.

602
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:50,812
Two men who used to be best friends,
are now fugitive and cop engaged in a chase.

603
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,942
They just keep running...

604
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:58,785
...and flashbacks of their
past play throughout.

605
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:01,850
Very experimental.

606
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:03,619
That guy...

607
01:01:05,862 --> 01:01:08,023
How could I have forgotten
about him until now?

608
01:01:12,536 --> 01:01:15,334
He was always one step ahead of me.

609
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,372
He was smart and popular with the girls.

610
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:23,736
I could never catch up with him.

611
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,119
I was frustrated at myself,
for not being frustrated with him.

612
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,122
He really was a good guy.

613
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:36,348
We talked about making movies together.

614
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,755
But I gave up.

615
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:42,587
I didn't have the confidence.

616
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:46,363
I left the unfinished
movie for him to deal with.

617
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,139
And that friend now?

618
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,609
He died.

619
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:58,942
He had just gotten accepted to
film school, but he was sick.

620
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,448
He didn't tell me.

621
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:06,551
I betrayed him.

622
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:10,148
I was his partner.
I was his counterpart.

623
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:11,783
He was the other...

624
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,858
The other me.

625
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:31,777
But what about the rest of it?!

626
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:35,542
Wait!

627
01:02:54,304 --> 01:02:55,794
Stop!

628
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,642
Why do you dress like a girl?

629
01:02:58,642 --> 01:02:59,342
Paprika!
Why do you dress like a girl?

630
01:02:59,342 --> 01:02:59,442
Paprika!

631
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,910
The real you is more befitting of me.

632
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:03,904
Paprika!

633
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,439
Stop, please...

634
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:12,521
...you jealous, perverted prince!

635
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:17,616
You have a bad habit of trying
to manipulate people with your words.

636
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:20,525
And you think you can
manipulate people with power?

637
01:03:21,731 --> 01:03:22,925
In here, yes.

638
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,576
I love you.

639
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:42,108
I love you as you are.

640
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:20,720
I will show no mercy for those who defy me.

641
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:21,824
Chairman...

642
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:26,253
You cannot hide anything from me.

643
01:04:32,736 --> 01:04:36,035
Chairman, not her. Not her!

644
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:39,767
Can you not control
even one sensual desire?

645
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:46,946
Please! Please spare her!

646
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,550
Why won't you obey me?

647
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:52,052
You are nothing without me!

648
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,321
But I love her.

649
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:08,504
Paprika!

650
01:05:12,142 --> 01:05:13,040
Are you okay?

651
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:18,576
I knew you were Paprika.

652
01:05:21,518 --> 01:05:25,079
What are you doing? You will obey!

653
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:34,219
Disgusting.

654
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:43,037
You fool.
Swayed by a mere woman.

655
01:05:58,054 --> 01:06:01,387
I'm too anxious to dream!

656
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,056
Konakawa?

657
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:07,992
Shima? Is that you?

658
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,064
Konakawa.

659
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,930
Why are you in Chiba's dream?

660
01:06:13,236 --> 01:06:14,567
Why are you a monkey?

661
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:15,662
What's going on?

662
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,670
I'll explain later. Just go!

663
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:18,539
Go where?

664
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:22,208
To your dream!

665
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:39,389
Don't get in the way of my dream!

666
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:44,296
This is my dream. You get out!

667
01:06:51,241 --> 01:06:54,574
I am justice!

668
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:00,380
Freeze!

669
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,820
How's that for traumatic?

670
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,333
What about the rest of it?!

671
01:07:24,574 --> 01:07:25,905
It's coming up right now!

672
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:30,137
This time, I'll end it!

673
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,718
That hurts.

674
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,194
It's over.

675
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:38,903
Chief.

676
01:08:40,883 --> 01:08:43,579
Is this really the real world?

677
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:44,784
I think so.

678
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:48,115
See? It hurts a lot.

679
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,489
But why was Konakawa in your dream?

680
01:08:58,368 --> 01:09:02,270
That's right,
Paprika was saved by Mr. Konakawa.

681
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,506
The chairman and Osanai...

682
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:07,843
Tokita!

683
01:09:08,044 --> 01:09:09,011
What about Tokita?

684
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:25,889
Osanai! What's wrong?

685
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:27,619
Osanai!

686
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:33,061
No! No! Osanai!

687
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:34,362
You can't go!

688
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:38,370
That body is mine!
I will not allow you to act on your own!

689
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:43,104
My noble spirit needs that body!

690
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:48,477
When the two become one, I will be complete!

691
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,514
Something's wrong.

692
01:09:56,726 --> 01:09:59,786
Not just Tokita, but what
just happened with Osanai.

693
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:03,699
Don't worry.
We just need to get the mastermind.

694
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,629
A happy ending is right around the corner.

695
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:11,936
But that mastermind is
lost in his own delusion.

696
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:12,837
No problem.

697
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,542
We have backup.

698
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:17,746
Mr. Konakawa.

699
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:24,111
The number you called fur
assisting young children...

700
01:10:24,487 --> 01:10:29,117
... is not available because of
crowded lines in the Pacific Ocean...

701
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:31,516
... starting at 7:63 a.m.

702
01:11:03,392 --> 01:11:05,053
The battle has ended.

703
01:11:07,497 --> 01:11:08,088
Now...

704
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,365
...it's show time!

705
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:44,023
Today’s weather is dreamy and will clear up
after a sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny day.

706
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:47,169
The dream I had yesterday and today.

707
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:50,265
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

708
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:55,535
The dreams will grow and grow.
Let's grow the tree that blooms money.

709
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:58,808
It's most valuable while it's still a bud.

710
01:11:59,382 --> 01:12:02,283
That's right, so we shall
preserve the memory forever.

711
01:12:02,852 --> 01:12:05,844
If there is no flower,
there will be no fruit.

712
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,049
If there's nothing,
then I won't do anything.

713
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:15,560
If you're unhappy,
please put a vote in this eyeball.

714
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,361
Who would give up this throne?

715
01:12:19,502 --> 01:12:23,063
I am the emperor,
chosen by the lord himself!

716
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:25,071
I didn't choose you!

717
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:28,275
God and Buddha will change religions.

718
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:31,609
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

719
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:35,017
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

720
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:39,118
Am I still dreaming?

721
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:42,383
Yes, the whole world is.

722
01:12:47,163 --> 01:12:48,528
You forgot this.

723
01:12:51,234 --> 01:12:51,996
Thank you.

724
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:54,192
Now, let's go.

725
01:12:54,337 --> 01:12:54,826
Where?

726
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:57,805
To clean up this mess.

727
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:09,748
Dreams and reality are merging?

728
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:11,979
Is this because of the DC Mini too?

729
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,431
Chief! Hold on!

730
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:40,712
Paprika?

731
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:43,511
No time for questions. Hurry up!

732
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:50,090
Why are you here?

733
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,485
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

734
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:55,227
Is this reality?

735
01:13:57,233 --> 01:13:59,497
Hurry! We have to get the mastermind!

736
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,034
It's as if we're in a dream.

737
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:07,837
Hurry!

738
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,507
Don't get ahead of yourself, Paprika!

739
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,618
Don't think you're always right.

740
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:48,682
Tokita.

741
01:14:49,285 --> 01:14:50,309
Let's go, Atsuko.

742
01:14:50,853 --> 01:14:52,286
I have to help Tokita.

743
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:54,919
Leave that irresponsible fatso.

744
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,755
Why don't you listen?

745
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,924
You're a part of me!

746
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:05,300
Have you ever thought that
maybe you are a part of me?

747
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:06,763
Do as I say!

748
01:15:08,137 --> 01:15:12,369
To think that you can
control yourself and others.

749
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,768
You're just like an old baldy I know.

750
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:21,844
Let's go.

751
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:24,413
We need to stop that old
baldy and his excursions.

752
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,115
Now!

753
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:25,743
No!

754
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:29,081
I can't just leave Tokita because I...

755
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,825
Because what?

756
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:39,428
Chiba!

757
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,434
She's become true to herself, hasn't she?

758
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:48,435
An overweight spirit needs no diet!

759
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,605
Go forward, superhero,
to anywhere you please!

760
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,438
Tokita, wake up! It's me!

761
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:58,354
The one I've been waiting
for since historic times!

762
01:15:58,354 --> 01:16:00,914
Your flute's melody is
a sound for sore neurons!

763
01:16:00,990 --> 01:16:02,457
Yes, try to remember.

764
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:05,428
Atsuko, the one you like!

765
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:06,452
It's me, At-chan!

766
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:12,360
A fragrant fat is a first class lunch!

767
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:17,966
It needs a little more spice.

768
01:16:19,642 --> 01:16:20,939
Maybe a little paprika?

769
01:16:42,832 --> 01:16:44,163
What is this?

770
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:46,697
A big hole.

771
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,201
I can see that!

772
01:16:48,871 --> 01:16:51,203
It's connected.

773
01:16:51,474 --> 01:16:53,032
To the other world.

774
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:55,100
The other... You mean?

775
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,348
What should we do?

776
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:03,543
Run?

777
01:17:03,686 --> 01:17:04,618
You think so too?

778
01:17:13,262 --> 01:17:15,924
Well-rounded achievement is missing a spice.

779
01:17:16,232 --> 01:17:17,324
Paprika found!

780
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,513
Hey!

781
01:17:34,183 --> 01:17:37,550
Paprika! Shima!
Are you two okay?

782
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,347
Mr. Konakawa!

783
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:41,486
Konakawa.

784
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:54,660
Chiba?

785
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:07,011
I'm in a bind.

786
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:09,909
I can see that.

787
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:16,356
It's not that!

788
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:34,773
Sorry.

789
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:39,108
You're such a slob.

790
01:18:39,582 --> 01:18:40,674
I know.

791
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:45,378
You're fat, slow and sloppy.

792
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:51,890
It's not the outside that counts,
but there's a limit to that too.

793
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:53,255
Yeah.

794
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:59,063
To think, a food disposal like you
is the genius of the century.

795
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,831
I swallow everything.

796
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,398
I know.

797
01:19:05,941 --> 01:19:08,409
You're so much fun.

798
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:16,109
Atsuko is dreaming.

799
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:33,796
What is that?

800
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,597
Our chairman!

801
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:38,270
I feel great!

802
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:41,599
I am reborn!

803
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,409
Look! I am standing!

804
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:51,018
With my own legs!

805
01:19:51,153 --> 01:19:52,381
I am perfect!

806
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:56,991
I can control the dreams, and even death!

807
01:19:58,661 --> 01:20:01,755
Now, to make the cosmos complete...

808
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:06,224
...I shall heal all deficiencies!

809
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,735
Way to go, Lord of Darkness!

810
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,535
Light and dark. Reality and dreams.

811
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:17,805
Life and death. Man and?

812
01:20:19,048 --> 01:20:19,878
Woman?

813
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:22,816
Then you add the missing spice.

814
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,644
Paprika?

815
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:26,620
Bingo.

816
01:20:33,729 --> 01:20:34,627
Paprika!

817
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:40,291
The new cosmos begins with me!

818
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:31,609
Who is eating up my dream?

819
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:38,619
Is that Paprika?

820
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:42,621
Well, it's a girl.

821
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,039
Why won't you obey?

822
01:22:57,573 --> 01:23:00,337
Have we awoken from the dream?

823
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:24,131
I just had the best dream.

824
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:29,430
I had a good dream too.
The first in a long time.

825
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:43,551
I guess I've been dumped.

826
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,619
You mean you were serious?

827
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:48,615
But Paprika is a woman in your dreams.

828
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:53,490
That's true. I'll see her
in my dreams again someday.

829
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,157
How are your dreams going?

830
01:23:59,101 --> 01:24:00,693
I almost forgot about it.

831
01:24:02,337 --> 01:24:04,100
Did you find out what was causing it?

832
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:06,804
The cause...

833
01:24:11,113 --> 01:24:13,081
You didn't do anything wrong.

834
01:24:17,019 --> 01:24:20,352
You just lived out our movie in real life.

835
01:24:20,923 --> 01:24:22,356
That's why you became a cop.

836
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:27,117
It's truth that came from fiction.
Always remember that.

837
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:30,898
Yeah, all the truths and the fiction.

838
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:42,837
Welcome.

839
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,485
I have a message for you from Miss Paprika.

840
01:24:56,224 --> 01:25:00,160
I heard you caught the perpetrator in
that homicide case. Congratulations.

841
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,356
I also have an announcement:

842
01:25:05,167 --> 01:25:08,364
Atsuko's last name will change to Tokita.

843
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:11,865
P.S.

844
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:16,875
The movie "Dreaming Kids" was very good.
I recommend it.

845
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,524
- Dreaming Kids -

846
01:25:40,669 --> 01:25:41,658
One adult, please.

847
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
