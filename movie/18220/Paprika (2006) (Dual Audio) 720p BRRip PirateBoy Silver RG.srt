1
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,650
...within the natural width
of the body's energy level.

2
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,170
Who had the jumbo steak set?

3
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,570
Depending on the frequency of use,
the body might adapt to it.

4
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,010
And as a result, Dr. Chiba, who has had the most exposure...

5
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,750
...was more susceptible to invasion...

6
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,750
...even when she wasn't connected
to the DC Mini, nor was she asleep.

7
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,750
Who had the paella?

8
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,780
I think you have a problem too.
Like overeating.

9
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,080
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

10
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,640
Fight?

11
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,640
Implanting dreams into other people's heads is terrorism.

12
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,170
At-chan, you said that Himuro and I were alike.

13
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,810
I think so too. All the more reason this is unforgivable.
