1
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,760
I remember those cheers,

2
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,960
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,900
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,340
'cause one night,

5
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,500
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,740
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,410
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,680
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,080
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,920
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,260
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve--

12
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,330
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,200
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,270
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

15
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,910
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,610
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,550
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,050
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,120
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,780
That's entertainment.

21
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,830
That's entertainment.

22
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,560
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

23
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,140
in the Cleveland Arena.

24
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,260
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

25
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,470
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

26
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,840
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

27
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,250
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,480
to get beaten by a mulignane?

29
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,490
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,750
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,480
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,750
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,690
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,770
Just like home--
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,660
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,030
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,200
Help!

38
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,780
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,850
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,640
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

41
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,780
La Motta fighting
out of a half crouch.

42
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,880
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

43
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,960
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

44
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,620
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

45
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,220
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

46
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,230
The crowd is urging Jake on.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,230
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

48
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,970
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

49
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,970
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

50
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,510
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

51
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,840
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

52
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,420
here in the tenth round.

53
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,580
Reeves is up again.
La Motta comes at him.

54
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,850
A left hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,590
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

56
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,690
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,790
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

58
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,160
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

59
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,260
Two... three...

60
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,860
four... five...

61
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,460
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

62
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,600
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

63
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,180
...and there is the bell.

64
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,370
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,380
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

66
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,890
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,320
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,290
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,550
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,100
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

72
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,840
after ten rounds,

73
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,500
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

74
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,480
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

75
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,610
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,850
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Jake won that fight!

78
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,360
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

79
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,300
You won-- let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,100
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,500
but La Motta still lost the fight.

82
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,540
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

83
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,720
Help!

84
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,110
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

85
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,710
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,760
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,090
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,130
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

89
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,460
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,030
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,040
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,770
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,210
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,210
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

95
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,140
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,220
He just wants to do
things for himself.

97
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,220
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,220
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,410
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,320
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,320
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,090
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,160
They knew.

104
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,700
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,170
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

106
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,070
The people knew.

107
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,510
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,580
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,620
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,880
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,450
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,530
Is it done?

113
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,000
No, it's not done.

114
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,800
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,040
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,880
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,050
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,220
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,450
Bring it over!

120
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,660
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,160
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,930
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,500
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,600
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,270
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,240
That's-- there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,940
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,020
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,950
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,850
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

131
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,450
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,490
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,790
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,260
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,870
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,700
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,100
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

140
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,210
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,300
Yeah?

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,210
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

143
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,220
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,150
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,950
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,750
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,730
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,390
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,800
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,630
What's the matter with you,

153
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,300
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,400
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,640
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,150
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,910
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,450
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,750
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,330
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,290
You son of a bitch!

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,460
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,030
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,190
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,870
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,770
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,340
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,610
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,620
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,780
What'd I do?

172
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,960
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

173
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,460
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
You can't, I'm telling you--

175
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,930
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,300
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

177
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,670
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,540
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,610
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,340
What's wrong?

181
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,640
Something's the matter,
what's up?

182
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,120
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,090
My hands.

184
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,760
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,270
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,500
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,110
Know what that means?

188
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,370
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,940
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,290
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,750
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,620
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,660
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,960
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,340
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,470
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,340
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,570
It's not normal.

199
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,420
Do me a favor.

200
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,320
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,890
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,890
Forget about it.

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,120
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

204
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,220
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,770
We have fights all the time--
are you worried now?

206
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,000
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,440
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,530
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,940
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

210
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,880
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,210
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,390
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,950
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,860
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,630
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,300
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,030
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,840
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,070
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,410
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,250
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,650
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,850
with everything you got. I want you
to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,930
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,290
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,490
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,260
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,030
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,930
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,300
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,800
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,170
- That's enough with that--
- Take it off.

235
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,400
Come on.

236
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,640
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,340
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,070
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,270
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,180
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,950
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,580
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,210
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,760
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,090
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,660
How you doin'?

247
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,460
Joey.

249
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,470
Come here.

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,680
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,970
Looks mad.

252
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,510
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,550
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,910
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,120
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,320
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

258
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,400
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,630
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,740
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,180
Hey, Jake, watch you
don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,020
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,530
Anybody bothers you,
let me know, okay?

264
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah. Yeah, wave.
They're your friends.

265
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,730
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,970
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,010
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,770
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,870
Is that what youse talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,080
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, you hear me?

272
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,250
What are ya,

273
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,920
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

274
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,390
What the fuck

275
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,490
Yeah, yeah,

276
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,390
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,840
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,920
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,860
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,520
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,240
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,310
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

283
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,880
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,950
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,110
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,150
What's her last name?

287
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,750
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,120
She knows them?

289
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,200
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,960
Everybody knows each other--
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,200
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,670
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,540
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,740
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

295
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,900
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

296
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,750
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,550
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,880
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,420
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,010
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,650
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,330
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's--

304
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,400
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about-- she's not like that.

305
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,100
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

306
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,440
You know, it's...

307
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,770
D'you bang her?

308
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,940
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,480
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,550
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,750
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,190
I took her out
a couple of times.

313
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,660
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,820
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,230
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,990
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,330
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,090
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,170
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,070
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,980
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,010
- That's--
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,840
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,940
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,350
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,850
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,250
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,350
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,420
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,120
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,670
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,610
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,070
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,440
Big shot.

335
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,780
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot--

336
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,180
without his gun.

337
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,960
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,620
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,630
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,130
Big shot.

342
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,810
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,040
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,380
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,470
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,650
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,380
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,460
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,320
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,550
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,130
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,250
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,590
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,930
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,480
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

356
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,950
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,180
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

358
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,720
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,590
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,280
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,790
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,690
You and your fuckin' ass--
you, too ya-- go out!

363
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,430
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,900
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,900
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,670
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,270
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,480
Jack.

369
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,790
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,420
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,190
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,930
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,270
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,770
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,270
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,540
- Hello, Joe, how you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,640
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,090
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,460
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,960
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,400
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,260
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,800
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,530
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,370
D'you put money
in the basket this week?

386
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,160
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,560
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,860
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,940
Go ahead.

390
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,080
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,660
Get out! Get out!

392
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,050
You, too, get out.

393
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,850
Get outta here,
ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,360
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,760
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,670
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,710
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,910
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,610
D'you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,520
- No, Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,950
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,450
There.

403
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,230
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,470
Hi.

405
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,300
How you doin'?

406
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,970
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,750
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,930
Where you from?

410
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
Around here.

411
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,630
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,440
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,780
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,410
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,650
Okay.

416
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,120
Move over.

417
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,070
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,640
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,520
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,740
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,510
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,020
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,600
You see it?

424
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,630
No.

425
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,960
What does that mean?

426
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,960
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,290
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,630
Daddy?

429
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,420
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,390
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

431
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,290
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

432
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,110
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,010
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,950
Salute.

435
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,400
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,580
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,660
Come here,
come here.

438
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,740
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,600
Come on,
come up from there.

440
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,540
That's better.

441
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,150
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,650
Some water?

443
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,830
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

444
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,160
All right.

445
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,740
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,970
Oh, yeah?

447
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,410
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,070
What else?

449
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,590
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,260
That's a bird.

451
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,830
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,600
The restroom.

453
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,310
Sit down.

454
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,970
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,370
I know.

456
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,180
You look good, though.

457
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,160
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,150
I don't know.

459
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,330
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

462
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,240
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

463
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,570
for their second fight.

464
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,650
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

465
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,310
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

466
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,990
You can see the contrast
in their styles--

467
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,250
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

468
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,380
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

469
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,290
Now he's hurt Robinson.

470
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,660
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

471
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,860
both hands to the head,
a left and a right to the jaw.

472
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,700
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

473
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,570
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point. 10-rounder.

474
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,740
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

475
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,340
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

476
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,780
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose.

477
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,010
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,020
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

479
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,180
for the first knockdown of his career.

480
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,420
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

481
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,240
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

482
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,640
The undefeated Sugar Ray--
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

483
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,870
La Motta coming at him again.
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

484
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,920
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,890
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

486
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,900
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

487
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,670
La Motta has won the fight!

488
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,600
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull.

489
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,230
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

490
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,050
his first loss as a professional,
and Robinson doesn't like it.

491
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,320
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

492
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,360
the impossible--
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

493
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,630
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

494
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,260
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

495
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,310
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,230
Come here.

497
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,810
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,150
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,650
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,650
Come here.

501
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,160
Come here.

502
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,210
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,640
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,620
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,620
Make it better.

506
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,160
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,470
You know how to
take off my pants?

508
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,060
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,130
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,280
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,570
I like the gym smell.

513
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,930
What?

514
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,340
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,130
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,480
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,140
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,670
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,910
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,520
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

521
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,950
meet for the third time.

522
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,460
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

523
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,190
These two men--
fierce, powerful fighters,

524
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,630
dangerous-- so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

525
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,670
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

526
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,100
They've each won one,

527
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,440
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

528
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,510
They go to close quarters at the bell.

529
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,050
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points,

530
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,950
La Motta may need a knockout.

531
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,880
The left hook to the jaw,

532
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,980
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

533
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,290
He was down
in the last fight, too.

534
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,660
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

535
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,430
- Robinson trying to get up.
- ...six... seven...

536
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,770
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

537
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,860
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

538
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,630
La Motta comes at him.

539
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,080
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

540
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,880
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

541
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,260
Your attention, fans.

542
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,030
Judge Joe Lanahan

543
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,930
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

544
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,600
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

545
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,930
Boo! Boo!

546
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,940
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

547
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,280
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

548
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,820
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

549
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,410
Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,990
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'--

551
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,160
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,720
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,430
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

554
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,300
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

555
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,930
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,410
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

557
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,040
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,450
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,590
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,950
Forget about all that shit--
this was your shot.

561
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,690
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,030
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,470
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,840
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

565
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,100
You sure?

566
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,740
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

567
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,110
Yeah, child. I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

568
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,350
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,520
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,560
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,890
Look at that-- 168 pounds.

572
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,190
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,460
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,660
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,670
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,640
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,570
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,740
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,210
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,310
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,580
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,210
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,220
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you--

584
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,920
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,090
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,720
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

587
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,100
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,500
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,000
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,630
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,010
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,440
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,210
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,180
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,190
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,650
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,460
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,300
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,130
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,000
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

601
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,240
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,440
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,570
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,740
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,820
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,180
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,550
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,180
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,990
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

610
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,320
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,490
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,900
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,520
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,830
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,300
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,600
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,300
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,170
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,840
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,440
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

621
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,180
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,190
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,520
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,190
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,260
- You beat him now--
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,300
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,800
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win--
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,390
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,700
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,600
- Nothin'--
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,730
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,340
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,380
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

634
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,710
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,090
Who asked you?

636
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,850
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,930
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,660
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,130
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,830
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,270
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,930
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,810
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,840
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,020
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds--

646
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,060
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,460
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,360
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,130
- your usual diet--
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,130
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,970
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,400
Like what?

653
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,470
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,640
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,800
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

656
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,880
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,780
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,820
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,250
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,020
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

661
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,990
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,590
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,930
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,370
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,100
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,770
and you tell her, "What are you--?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,340
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,540
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,840
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't--

670
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,920
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,080
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,880
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,250
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,320
All right.

675
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:26,790
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,450
Make up with her.

677
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,660
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

678
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,530
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

679
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,030
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,130
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,540
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,610
All right?

683
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,740
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,400
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

685
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,810
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,080
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,180
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,450
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,390
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,120
Come here.

691
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,390
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,620
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,060
What a great audience.

694
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,130
Come on, lady, laugh it up--
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,060
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,070
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,870
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

698
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,470
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,690
What's your name again?

700
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,280
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,190
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,290
He hits me with a left hook--
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,830
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,640
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,400
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,670
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,250
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,080
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,670
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,270
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,510
See ya later.

712
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,250
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,920
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,690
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,030
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

716
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,260
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,560
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,230
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,900
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,670
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,610
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,880
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,450
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,500
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,070
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,300
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,710
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,680
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,880
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,720
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,620
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,590
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,430
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,770
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,700
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,280
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,350
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

738
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,540
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,480
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,710
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,550
Are you interested in him?

742
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,650
No, why would I be
interested in him?

743
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,660
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,730
Yeah.

745
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,730
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

746
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,200
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,430
What do you gotta--? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,240
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,970
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,050
Shall I take the...?

751
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,480
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,490
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,150
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,250
I tell ya the truth, it's so--
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,530
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,260
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,130
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,640
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,400
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,910
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,920
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,320
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,920
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,460
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

765
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,830
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,660
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,000
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,070
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes.

769
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,640
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

770
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,970
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,810
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,180
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,080
I think he should.

774
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,850
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,010
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,220
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,350
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,460
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,300
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

780
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,170
Right off, right off.

781
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,740
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,640
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,110
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,340
Yeah?

785
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,320
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,390
I would say
bet everything you got.

787
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,720
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,490
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

789
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,220
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,230
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,500
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,010
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,040
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,700
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,940
I don't know, I got a problem--
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,090
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:52,450
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,120
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,280
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,420
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,160
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,230
How you gonna do that?

803
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,530
I'll get youse both in the ring
and give youse both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,190
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,400
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,780
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,540
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

808
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,270
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,150
Hey, Vick.

810
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,390
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,520
No.

812
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,930
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,310
You ever think
of anybody else...

814
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,640
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,240
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,910
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,090
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

818
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,490
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,460
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,670
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,000
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,170
Go to sleep.

823
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,010
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,380
And the winner
by unanimous decision

825
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,160
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,290
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,690
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,290
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,600
Four pounds.

830
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,700
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,510
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it--

832
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,710
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,120
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,850
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,120
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,950
I don't know.
You never know these things--

837
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,790
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,820
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,260
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,270
Pleasure-- heard a lot
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,700
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

842
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,670
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,470
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,810
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,610
Whatever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,340
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,940
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,350
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,150
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,550
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,820
He's workin' downtown,
big building-- workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,250
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,790
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,620
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,750
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,420
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

857
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:05,470
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

858
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,590
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,230
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,360
Come on back. Okay.

861
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,840
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,140
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,610
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,950
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,650
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,520
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of youse are the same.

867
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,610
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,720
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,360
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,860
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,690
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,890
and havin' both of youse
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,770
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,340
- Don't make me--
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,500
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,740
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,040
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,910
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,680
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,750
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,480
He's just been
a contender too long.

882
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,720
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,490
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,960
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,590
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,500
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,670
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,770
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,850
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,170
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,980
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

892
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,680
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,690
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,920
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,450
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,930
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,120
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,830
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:44,920
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,330
We're friends,
we can straighten this--

901
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,100
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,330
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:59,080
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,350
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,350
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,060
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,920
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,980
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,310
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,710
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:23,750
Hey, you fuckin'--
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,880
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,050
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,990
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:31,120
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,660
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

917
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,470
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,170
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,680
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

920
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,290
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

921
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,430
and you've done
a lot of things together.

922
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,130
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,010
But you don't raise your hands,

924
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:16,840
But you don't raise your hands,

925
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,280
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

926
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,120
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

927
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,390
and we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,950
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

929
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,720
Right?

930
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,890
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

931
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,100
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

932
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,730
and no grudges.

933
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,640
That's the most important thing--
no grudges.

934
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,410
Now, come on, shake hands.

935
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,590
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

936
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,810
All right?

937
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,850
I only wish this thing
never happened.

938
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,790
We all wish it never happened.

939
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:00,020
Right?
You'll get over it.

940
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:03,260
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

941
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,490
Yeah, all right.

942
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,970
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

943
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,100
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

944
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,440
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

945
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,220
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

946
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,080
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

947
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,880
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

948
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,520
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

949
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,890
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

950
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,060
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

951
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,330
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

952
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,800
No, it's nothin' like that.

953
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,810
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

954
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,840
all the fights and all.

955
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:54,050
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

956
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,580
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

957
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,420
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

958
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,790
and I'm lookin' very bad.

959
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,760
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

960
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,360
What is it with him?

961
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,430
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

962
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:15,160
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

963
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,270
The man's got a head of rock.

964
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,710
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

965
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,710
Jack respects you.

966
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,290
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

967
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,690
You he talks to, he likes you.

968
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:38,790
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

969
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,890
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

970
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,360
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

971
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,900
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

972
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,030
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

973
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,440
Make it on his own.

974
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:56,600
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

975
01:05:57,350 --> 01:06:00,180
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

976
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,680
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

977
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,080
That's not crazy.

978
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:08,590
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

979
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,820
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

980
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:16,130
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

981
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,860
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

982
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,990
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

983
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,660
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

984
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:26,600
Now, you're a smart kid.

985
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,100
You go to him, you tell him...

986
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,550
Son of a bitch.

987
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,210
Twenty dollar shoe here.

988
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,400
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

989
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,730
What's the matter?

990
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,070
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

991
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,230
- Who?
- Vickie.

992
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,250
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

993
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,520
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

994
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,750
Just once.

995
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,330
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

996
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,090
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

997
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:27,190
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

998
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,100
'cause that's what's happenin'.

999
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,880
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

1000
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,310
So, what'd that guy say?

1001
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,880
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1002
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,480
The good news is

1003
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,720
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

1004
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:58,060
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

1005
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,160
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1006
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,700
You didn't know that was comin'?

1007
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,430
You win some,
you lose some.

1008
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,010
This one, we're losin'.

1009
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,470
Billy Fox.

1010
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,810
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1011
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,690
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1012
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:25,060
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

1013
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,890
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1014
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,360
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1015
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:33,460
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1016
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:36,370
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1017
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,530
and It's not good.

1018
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,610
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1019
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:41,540
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1020
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,480
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1021
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,780
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1022
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,050
You got any money
you wanna bet?

1023
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,710
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1024
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,620
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1025
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,060
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1026
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,960
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1027
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,530
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1028
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:02,120
Okay, that's it.

1029
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:03,560
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

1030
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,360
- That was it?
- That was it.

1031
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,400
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:20,420
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

1033
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,620
feature attraction.

1034
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:27,290
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1035
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,200
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

1036
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,100
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

1037
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,970
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

1038
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,070
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1039
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,350
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1040
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,450
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1041
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,990
It's all right, yeah.

1042
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,750
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

1043
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,660
Five seconds, Alex.

1044
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,970
Come on, stand--
come on, stand up!

1045
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,770
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1046
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,570
Come on.

1047
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:19,620
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1048
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,260
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

1049
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,860
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1050
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,260
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1051
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,930
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1052
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,200
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1053
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:44,870
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1054
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:47,210
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1055
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,970
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1056
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,380
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1057
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,250
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1058
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,880
Pocket your dirty money!

1059
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:03,050
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1060
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,720
We're stoppin' the fight!

1061
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,600
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1062
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,230
And you standin' there.

1063
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:13,330
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1064
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,140
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1065
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,640
The winner
by technical knockout,

1066
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,910
and still undefeated,

1067
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:27,010
Billy Fox!

1068
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,250
What'd I do?!

1069
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:43,530
Don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,430
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1071
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:51,610
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1072
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,140
What'd I do?

1073
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,120
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview--

1074
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,130
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1075
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,630
Why did I do it? Why?

1076
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,540
They got some balls,
some balls.

1077
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,900
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1078
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,000
They want me
to go down, too?

1079
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,580
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1080
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,310
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1081
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,720
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1082
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,760
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1083
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,420
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1084
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:49,430
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1085
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,160
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1086
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,360
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

1087
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,170
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1088
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,500
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1089
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,830
I don't know.

1090
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,970
"Purse was withheld--" look at this--
"Purse was withheld pending

1091
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,140
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1092
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,840
Look how they make me look.

1093
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,980
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

1094
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,620
A what?

1095
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,990
Like the mammalucco of the year.

1096
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,720
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1097
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,120
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1098
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,320
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1099
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,990
What are you talkin' about?

1100
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,000
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1101
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,330
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1102
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,500
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1103
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,510
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

1104
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:33,370
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1105
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,410
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1106
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,410
- is if he dies, he won't be able to--
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1107
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,680
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1108
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,590
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

1109
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,290
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1110
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,430
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1111
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,590
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1112
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,370
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1113
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,030
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

1114
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,440
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1115
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:09,710
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

1116
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,370
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1117
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,780
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1118
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:17,880
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1119
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,620
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1120
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,630
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1121
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,850
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,520
I don't want nothin'.

1123
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,600
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1124
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,240
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1125
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,240
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1126
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,370
You're worried about that?

1127
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,910
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1128
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,910
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1129
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,450
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1130
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,020
Order me a piece of cake.

1131
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,020
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

1132
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,750
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

1133
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,850
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1134
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,430
That's good,
order me one of those.

1135
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,470
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

1136
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,800
Since when did you
order one of those?

1137
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,300
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1138
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,530
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1139
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,770
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1140
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,810
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1141
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,040
I'm not tellin' her-- personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1142
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,780
What were you tellin' her that for?

1143
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,780
Order me a cheeseburger.

1144
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,360
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

1145
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:28,800
What the f--?

1146
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,000
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1147
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,070
Forty seconds.

1148
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,730
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1149
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,970
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1150
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,580
Ya up?

1151
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,590
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1152
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,090
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1153
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,490
How are you?

1154
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,930
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1155
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:00,660
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1156
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,500
Thank you.

1157
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,570
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1158
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,770
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,350
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1160
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:15,540
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1161
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:17,120
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1162
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,580
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1163
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,650
No, thank you, Tommy.

1164
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,810
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1165
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,620
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1166
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:26,020
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1167
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,090
See you later, everybody.

1168
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,060
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1169
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,630
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1170
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,900
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1171
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,870
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1172
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,270
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1173
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,210
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

1174
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,580
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1175
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,410
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1176
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,510
Good-bye, honey.

1177
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:53,150
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1178
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,920
Can you believe that girl?

1179
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,360
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1180
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,650
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1181
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,220
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1182
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,600
Hey! Come here.

1183
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,670
Come here a minute.

1184
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,710
What was all that about?

1185
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,450
All what?

1186
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,320
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1187
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,060
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1188
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,260
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

1189
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,060
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1190
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,530
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1191
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,100
- I hear.
- Hey!

1192
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,330
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

1193
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,070
You hear what I said?

1194
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,440
- Yeah, I hear.
- All right. Go in there.

1195
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:54,320
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1196
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,040
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1197
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,580
Shut up! I'll fuckin'
take care of you later!

1198
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,810
Shut up!

1199
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,700
Disgusted with the two of youse.

1200
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,640
Get to youse later.

1201
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:24,240
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...

1202
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,580
Hit the fuckin' thing, come on!

1203
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:31,920
All right, let's go.

1204
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,440
Good luck, Jake!

1205
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:48,860
For the Middleweight Championship
of the World, 15 rounds.

1206
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:52,520
In this corner,

1207
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:56,070
weighing in at 158 1/4 pounds,

1208
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:00,470

1209
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:08,950
Shake hands,

1210
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,170

1211
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:39,600
Pressure, pressure, pressure!

1212
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:54,750
Now finish him off.
He's all stupiada. you got him.

1213
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,420
Come on, Jake!

1214
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:00,570
Blow on him, he'll fuckin' fall
right over for ya.

1215
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:03,330
Look at him.
Do you feel all right?

1216
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,970
- No way, huh?
- Can't continue?

1217
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,440
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,
I'm gonna stop the fight.

1218
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:13,010
Yeah, you did it, Jake!

1219
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,230
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

1220
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:32,840
Cerdan, unable to continue,
the referee stops the fight.

1221
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:35,170
And the winner by
a technical knockout

1222
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,680
in the tenth round,

1223
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,550
and the new
Middleweight Champion of the World,

1224
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:43,410
the Bronx Bull,
Jake La Motta!

1225
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,990
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

1226
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:10,610
Don't shake that.
Don't shake it like that, I'm tellin' ya.

1227
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,410
It's the worst thing you could do.

1228
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,120
Oh, you're home.

1229
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,560
- Hi, Vick.
- Hi, Joe.

1230
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:27,730
- Hello.
- Hi. Where were ya?

1231
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:30,730
I went out.
What's the matter?

1232
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,300
Television won't work.

1233
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:34,660
Where'd you go?

1234
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:39,070
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1235
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:53,980
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1236
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,150
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1237
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,780
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

1238
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,860
Come on, huh?

1239
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,520
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1240
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,220
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

1241
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,270
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

1242
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,000
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1243
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,240
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1244
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,380
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1245
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,580
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

1246
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,220
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1247
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,120
That's it, go ahead--
forget how long it took you

1248
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,320
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1249
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:36,160
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1250
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,560
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1251
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:45,740
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1252
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,840
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1253
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,780
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

1254
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,110
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1255
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,150
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1256
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:58,250
- Didn't I?
- No.

1257
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,760
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1258
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,190
It was no big thing, anyway.

1259
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:05,090
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1260
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,390
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1261
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,490
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1262
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,690
How come you
never told me about it?

1263
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,030
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

1264
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,510
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1265
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:21,340
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with-- Vickie?

1266
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,880
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1267
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,970
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1268
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,490
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1269
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,390
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1270
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,980
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1271
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:39,060
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1272
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,720
I heard some things.

1273
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:44,030
- You heard about me and Salvy--
- I heard things, Joey.

1274
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,660
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

1275
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,670
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1276
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:49,870
I heard some things.

1277
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:52,470
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1278
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,010
You know what
you should worry about?

1279
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:57,170
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1280
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,210
Do that.

1281
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:04,110
Christ!

1282
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:11,390
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1283
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,090
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1284
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:17,470
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

1285
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,540
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1286
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,700
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1287
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:24,240
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

1288
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,640
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1289
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,370
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1290
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,410
- He thinks he's a wiseguy--
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1291
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,540
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1292
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,210
Hey, I'm your brother.

1293
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,380
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1294
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,980
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1295
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,030
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1296
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:47,230
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1297
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:49,770
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1298
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,630
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1299
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:00,440
You give me
that look, Joey.

1300
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:06,110
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

1301
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,190
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1302
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,950
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1303
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,320
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1304
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:16,860
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

1305
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,260
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1306
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,230
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1307
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:24,170
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1308
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:26,170
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1309
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,170
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1310
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:32,370
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1311
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,500
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1312
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:37,550
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1313
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,880
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

1314
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,820
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1315
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,350
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1316
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,980
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1317
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:50,490
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you--

1318
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,030
you included you with them.

1319
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,560
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1320
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,070
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

1321
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:02,070
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1322
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,700
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,780
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1324
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:12,210
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1325
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,220
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1326
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,290
You ask me that?

1327
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,950
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

1328
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,020
Just tell me.

1329
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,740
I'm not answerin' that.

1330
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,010
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1331
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,810
You're very smart, Joey.

1332
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,390
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1333
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,850
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1334
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,360
Did you or did you not?

1335
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,970
I'm not gonna answer.

1336
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:59,010
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1337
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,170
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1338
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,570
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1339
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,650
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1340
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,870
You're a sick bastard--
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1341
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,040
You know what you should do?

1342
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:12,740
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1343
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:15,010
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

1344
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,250
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

1345
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,450
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1346
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,260
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1347
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,400
Where were ya?

1348
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:10,880
I was at my sister's.

1349
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,640
Where'd you go after that?

1350
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:16,710
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1351
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:20,380
Father of the Bride.

1352
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,760
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

1353
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,770
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1354
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,490
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

1355
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,870
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

1356
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:41,940
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1357
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,310
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1358
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:48,850
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1359
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,250
- Huh?
- No!

1360
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,180
Open the door.

1361
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,920
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1362
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,430
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1363
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,090
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1364
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,500
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1365
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,730
No.

1366
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,300
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1367
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,070
I didn't do anything!

1368
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,250
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1369
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,340
I fucked all of 'em!

1370
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,580
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1371
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,240
I fucked all of 'em-- Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1372
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,020
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1373
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,920
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1374
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:33,860
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

1375
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,020
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1376
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:40,100
Forget fuckin' with you!

1377
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,900
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

1378
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,970
Where you goin'?

1379
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,640
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

1380
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,610
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1381
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,620
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

1382
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,210
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1383
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,220
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

1384
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,950
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1385
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,100
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

1386
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,130
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like--

1387
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,460
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1388
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:18,000
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1389
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,140
Get off of him!

1390
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:29,510
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1391
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,680
Call the police!

1392
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,720
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1393
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,050
Get out!

1394
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,110
Don't leave, honey, please.

1395
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:13,350
Honey, look-- I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

1396
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,570
Just...

1397
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:56,300
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

1398
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:58,640
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1399
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:01,640
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life.

1400
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,650
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1401
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,650
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

1402
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,380
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

1403
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:14,520
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

1404
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:18,030
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

1405
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,620
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

1406
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,390
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

1407
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,260
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

1408
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,670
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

1409
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,040
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

1410
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,910
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

1411
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:41,250
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

1412
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:44,410
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

1413
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,220
Six... seven...

1414
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,820
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

1415
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:50,950
You're out!

1416
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,390
It is all over!

1417
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,620
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

1418
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:57,430
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

1419
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:00,000
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

1420
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,770
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

1421
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,100
Come on.

1422
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,110
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1423
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:20,280
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

1424
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,160
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1425
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:33,130
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1426
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,580
Go ahead.

1427
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,930
Hey, champ-- like to ask
you a few questions.

1428
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,430
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1429
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:06,160
- Excuse me, my wife is--
- There's a great angle here...

1430
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:08,930
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1431
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,270
Come on. All right, champ?

1432
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:13,100
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya--?

1433
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,210
Hello?

1434
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:34,730
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

1435
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:35,890
Is that you?

1436
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,900
I know somebody's there.
I can hear you breathin'.

1437
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,730
You listenin'?

1438
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:45,640
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

1439
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,210
You got that?

1440
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:37,380
The fight of the year.

1441
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:40,760
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

1442
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,830
give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1443
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:50,170
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1444
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:53,500
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1445
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:58,450
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

1446
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,480
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

1447
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:04,710
That's it,
that was his last shot.

1448
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,820
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

1449
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:11,520
There's the buzzer,

1450
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,620
and I think you know
both the boys.

1451
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,800
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

1452
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:32,810
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

1453
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,180
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

1454
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:39,120
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

1455
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:40,950
Come on! Come on.

1456
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,890
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

1457
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,900
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

1458
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,660
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1459
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,450
These are clean, whistling shots.

1460
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:06,250
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

1461
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:08,580
No man can endure this pummeling!

1462
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:11,450
The fight is stopped on...

1463
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,290
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

1464
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:17,360
Row after row after row
from the ring,

1465
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,990
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1466
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,130
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

1467
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,260
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

1468
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:28,470
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1469
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,700
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

1470
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:33,840
Never went down, Ray.

1471
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,950
You never got me down, Ray.

1472
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:38,940
Ya hear me?

1473
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:41,640
Never got me down.

1474
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,190
Yeah? See, look?

1475
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:46,990
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

1476
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:49,960
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

1477
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:51,850
And there you see it...

1478
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,130
a champion gone down to defeat.

1479
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,270
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

1480
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:02,310
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

1481
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,440
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

1482
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,980
throughout the world,

1483
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,640
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

1484
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:13,340
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

1485
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:16,420
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

1486
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,860
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner--

1487
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,930
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1488
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:24,860
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1489
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,860
of the thirteenth round,

1490
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:29,870
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1491
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:31,370
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1492
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,910
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1493
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:43,780
It's over for me--
boxing's over for me.

1494
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,640
I'm through.

1495
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,610
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1496
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,780
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1497
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:54,330
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1498
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:56,830
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1499
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:59,330
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1500
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:03,290
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1501
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,500
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1502
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:08,800
Take a picture, Bob.

1503
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,570
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey-- for us.

1504
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,310
Go ahead, smile.

1505
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:16,740
Thank you, Bob.

1506
01:42:16,850 --> 01:42:19,650
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1507
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,220
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1508
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:31,290
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1509
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,630
I think it's great.

1510
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,060
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

1511
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,970
He's home with us
all the time now.

1512
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,200
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1513
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:41,870
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1514
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,140
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

1515
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,480
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1516
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:48,550
I don't know.

1517
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,450
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1518
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,960
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1519
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:07,990
Thank you.

1520
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:16,370
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

1521
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,840
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1522
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,580
See how that sounds.

1523
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,120
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1524
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,380
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1525
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:33,960
at Madison Square Garden.

1526
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:38,100
Okay, honey.

1527
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,770
Thank you, doll.

1528
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,760
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1529
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:45,500
- Salute.
- Salute.

1530
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,840
Look at this terrific girl.

1531
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:52,280
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

1532
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,680
especially if he's a degenerate.

1533
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,110
Did I say that?

1534
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:02,510
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1535
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:05,350
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

1536
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,760
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

1537
01:44:10,330 --> 01:44:13,360
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1538
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,660
you're all full of shit.

1539
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,540
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

1540
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,870
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1541
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:27,550
Is she here?
She's not here.

1542
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,480
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1543
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:32,240
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate--

1544
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:34,820
it's a little different--
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1545
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,150
Thank you.

1546
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:40,490
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

1547
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:42,490
One was married,
one was single.

1548
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,000
The married guy
tells the single guy,

1549
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,830
"What's the matter with you?

1550
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,090
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1551
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,000
And look at me,
and look at you."

1552
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:56,440
Let me get on with it.

1553
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,140
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1554
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:00,680
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1555
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,910
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

1556
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,010
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

1557
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,020
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

1558
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,850
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

1559
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,520
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1560
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:14,150
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1561
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:15,730
What time does
your wife get home?"

1562
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:24,060
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1563
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,730
he would say

1564
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,970
that the thing ain't the ring,

1565
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,980
it's the play.

1566
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:33,590
So give me a stage

1567
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:35,990
where this bull here can rage,

1568
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,990
and though I can fight,

1569
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:40,490
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

1570
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:48,100
That's entertainment!

1571
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,930
Jake, how have you been?

1572
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,060
Hey!
You were just great.

1573
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,730
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1574
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,830
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1575
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:27,410
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1576
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:30,510
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1577
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,740
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1578
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:34,280
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1579
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,790
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1580
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:41,390
It's good seein' you.

1581
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,750
That is a joke, right?

1582
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,090
It's a joke--
only you know if it's a joke.

1583
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,820
He's just kidding, right?

1584
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,800
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

1585
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:51,660
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1586
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:53,570
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1587
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:55,540
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1588
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,940
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1589
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,740
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1590
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:06,610
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1591
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:10,280
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1592
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,880
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1593
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:15,290
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1594
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:16,950
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

1595
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:20,090
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1596
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,430
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

1597
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:24,830
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

1598
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:26,490
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1599
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,570
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1600
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,230
What's the problem?

1601
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,360
There's really not a problem.

1602
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:34,340
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1603
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,500
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1604
01:47:36,610 --> 01:47:37,910
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1605
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:40,280
Can you prove
that you're 21?

1606
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,350
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1607
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,360
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1608
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,760
What about you?
How old are you?

1609
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,260
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1610
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,330
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1611
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:58,730
Come here.

1612
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:11,940
She's 21, too?

1613
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:15,950
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

1614
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,430
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1615
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,010
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1616
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:52,150
There.

1617
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:58,750
Come on, Jake.

1618
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:07,070
Lonely nights

1619
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:11,070
I'm so lonely

1620
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:13,910
Please come home

1621
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:18,310
You great big
lump of sugar

1622
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:21,010
I miss you so much

1623
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,950
Please come home

1624
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:26,020
Lonely nights

1625
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:43,140
It was a busy night last night.

1626
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:46,970
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1627
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,500
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1628
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:52,910
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1629
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:56,710
- Move over.
- Why?

1630
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:59,310
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1631
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,890
Come on, honey,
open the door.

1632
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:02,510
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1633
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:04,560
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

1634
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,690
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1635
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:09,790
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1636
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:12,530
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1637
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,930
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1638
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,470
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1639
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,730
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1640
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:45,930
Wake up, champ.

1641
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:50,530
What's up?

1642
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:55,240
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1643
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:57,640
- They wanna talk with you.
- Youse all look the same to me.

1644
01:50:57,750 --> 01:51:00,150
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1645
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:02,220
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1646
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,720
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do youse want?

1647
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:05,950
For what?

1648
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:11,720
Do you recognize this girl?

1649
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,790
She been in the club?

1650
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:20,600
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1651
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,000
Nah, I don't know her.

1652
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:26,270
She says you introduced
her to some men.

1653
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,970
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

1654
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,390
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1655
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:36,550
But I don't say nothin'.

1656
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:39,560
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

1657
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:42,500
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1658
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,570
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1659
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:52,830
Let me ask you somethin'.

1660
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:57,080
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

1661
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,310
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1662
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:02,550
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1663
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,020
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1664
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:07,660
For what,
because of this girl?

1665
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,320
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1666
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:15,260
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1667
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:17,060
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1668
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:18,800
Let me just get somethin'.

1669
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:21,540
All right, don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,630
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1671
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,870
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

1672
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:29,810
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1673
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,820
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

1674
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,150
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1675
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:35,550
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1676
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,950
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

1677
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:43,490
You saw the papers--
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1678
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,930
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1679
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,760
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1680
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:50,340
Yeah, what friends?

1681
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,630
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1682
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:56,110
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

1683
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,510
What's the matter with you?

1684
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:07,110
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1685
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:09,310
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

1686
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,250
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

1687
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:15,330
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1688
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:18,520
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1689
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:21,530
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1690
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:23,000
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together--

1691
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,540
Give me 2,000 for them.

1692
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,940
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all--

1693
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,940
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1694
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,940
- I'm sorry. I'd lose--
- Give me them.

1695
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,450
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

1696
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:39,420
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1697
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:42,950
I can't raise the 10,000.

1698
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:47,610
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1699
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:49,790
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1700
01:53:50,830 --> 01:53:53,800
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1701
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:58,100
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1702
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,970
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1703
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:06,670
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1704
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:11,070
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

1705
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,480
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1706
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:17,920
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1707
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:21,150
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

1708
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:23,250
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1709
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,090
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1710
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,670
See it? See it?!

1711
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,830
Look at it, son!
Live in it!

1712
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:33,500
Go on, boy, live in it!

1713
01:54:33,610 --> 01:54:36,400
- Do you understand that?
- On your mother's cunt, then!

1714
01:54:36,510 --> 01:54:37,640
Your mother's--!

1715
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:40,540
- You cocksucker!
- Live in it!

1716
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:45,940
Let that son of a bitch sit,
fuck him!

1717
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:47,550
Fuck you!

1718
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:51,620
Fuck your mother!

1719
01:55:28,630 --> 01:55:31,760
Dummy, dummy, dummy...

1720
01:55:38,470 --> 01:55:40,600
Why? Why? Why?

1721
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,560
You motherfucker!

1722
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:14,970
My hands!

1723
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:20,070
Why'd you do it, why?

1724
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:22,580
You're so stupid,
you're so stupid,

1725
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:25,080
you're so fuckin' stupid!

1726
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:27,580
You're so stupid.

1727
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:30,520
They called me an animal.
I'm not an animal.

1728
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:32,020
I'm not an animal.

1729
01:56:32,120 --> 01:56:36,530
Why do they treat me like this?
I'm not that bad. I'm not that bad.

1730
01:56:39,370 --> 01:56:41,330
I'm not that guy.

1731
01:56:59,320 --> 01:57:03,280
Guy comes home, finds his wife
in bed with another guy, the wife says,

1732
01:57:03,390 --> 01:57:06,320
"Look who's here-- big mouth.
Now the whole neighborhood will know."

1733
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:10,960
Thanks. Thanks for laughin'.
Spread it around a little bit.

1734
01:57:12,500 --> 01:57:14,900
The first night I was here,
I said to the owner of the joint,

1735
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,970
I said, "Listen,
where's the toilet?"

1736
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:19,540
He said, "You're in it."

1737
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:22,660
Come on, let's go, let's go.

1738
01:57:22,780 --> 01:57:24,770
Why don't you leave me alone?
I'm tryin' to do my routine.

1739
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:25,870
Up yours.

1740
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:29,680
Pal, you're gonna force me
to make a comeback.

1741
01:57:29,780 --> 01:57:32,410
- Funny.
- Fuck you...

1742
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:34,920
And the horse you rode in on.

1743
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,930
And the whole cavalry behind ya.

1744
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,930
Funny man.

1745
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:43,260
That's why I'm here.

1746
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:47,270
Give him another drink.

1747
01:57:47,810 --> 01:57:49,280
Piss in it for me.

1748
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:54,380
I'm now gonna introduce a woman
who's made a worldwide tour

1749
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:57,450
with top billing and all that
other bullshit where they all hated her.

1750
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,050
And I want you all
to give her a warm welcome.

1751
01:58:00,160 --> 01:58:02,320
I know you're all capable of it.

1752
01:58:02,420 --> 01:58:04,390
You look like a bunch of junkies.

1753
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:08,630
Her name is Emma 48's.

1754
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,630
Oh, yeah! Go get it!

1755
01:58:28,520 --> 01:58:29,710
Taxi!

1756
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,720
Honey...

1757
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,890
Listen, I'm gonna take a little walk.

1758
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,530
I got a couple of things
I gotta take care of, all right?

1759
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:50,330
- Will I see you later?
- Yeah, here.

1760
01:58:51,870 --> 01:58:53,670
- Take that, I'll be home later.
- Thank you.

1761
01:58:55,380 --> 01:58:56,670
Be careful.

1762
01:59:11,230 --> 01:59:12,630
Hey, what are you doin'?

1763
01:59:12,730 --> 01:59:13,990
Joey.

1764
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:19,760
Come on, Joey.
Why don't you turn around?

1765
01:59:32,110 --> 01:59:33,840
Come on, Joey,
turn around.

1766
01:59:33,950 --> 01:59:35,710
Hey, Joey, come on.

1767
01:59:48,860 --> 01:59:50,990
Come on, Joey?
What are you doin'?

1768
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:54,190
Come on. What are you
gettin' so angry about?

1769
01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:56,100
Come on, be friends.

1770
01:59:56,210 --> 01:59:57,730
Come on, you're my brother.

1771
01:59:57,840 --> 01:59:59,330
- Be friends.
- I'm your brother?

1772
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,070
Yeah, ya fuckin' bum.
Give me a break, come on.

1773
02:00:02,180 --> 02:00:03,270
- Kiss me.
- Come on, huh?

1774
02:00:03,380 --> 02:00:04,850
Give me a kiss, come on.

1775
02:00:05,380 --> 02:00:08,280
Wait, let me call my wife and kids.
Don't you want them to see the kiss?

1776
02:00:08,380 --> 02:00:11,840
You gonna forgive and forget?
It's a long time ago, forget about it.

1777
02:00:11,950 --> 02:00:13,420
Just give me a kiss, come on.

1778
02:00:14,220 --> 02:00:15,350
Come on.

1779
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:23,120
You're my brother.
Come on.

1780
02:00:25,130 --> 02:00:26,600
Come on, give me a kiss.

1781
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:31,130
- What?
- Come on.

1782
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:34,570
- How's everything, all right?
- Good.

1783
02:00:34,680 --> 02:00:36,640
- Everything's all right?
- Yeah.

1784
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:39,480
- Family?
- All right.

1785
02:00:43,690 --> 02:00:44,740
Come on.

1786
02:00:44,850 --> 02:00:46,820
You don't wanna
do this here, come on.

1787
02:00:47,860 --> 02:00:50,320
Let me call you,
we'll get together in a couple days.

1788
02:00:50,430 --> 02:00:52,390
- You'll call me?
- I will.

1789
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:54,500
Don't forget.

1790
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:58,000
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1791
02:01:09,440 --> 02:01:10,740
...won it legitimately...

1792
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:15,870
...and nobody could take that
away from me, nobody.

1793
02:01:16,990 --> 02:01:19,040
Some people aren't that lucky.

1794
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:24,020
Like the one that Marlon Brando
played in On the Waterfront.

1795
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:26,790
an up-and-comer
who's now a down-and-outer.

1796
02:01:26,900 --> 02:01:28,800
You remember that scene
in the back of the car

1797
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:31,490
with his brother Charley,
a small-time racket guy?

1798
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:33,400
And it went somethin' like this.

1799
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:39,470
"It wasn't him, Charley, it was you.

1800
02:01:40,180 --> 02:01:42,740
"You remember that night at the Garden,
you came to my dressing room

1801
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:47,410
"and you said, 'Kid, this ain't your night.
We're goin' for the price on Wilson.'

1802
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,250
"Remember that?
'This ain't your night.'

1803
02:01:50,350 --> 02:01:51,650
"My night.

1804
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:54,660
"I could've taken
Wilson apart that night.

1805
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:56,160
"So, what happens?

1806
02:01:56,260 --> 02:01:59,660
"He gets a title shot outdoors
in the ballpark, and what do I get?

1807
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:01,920
"A one-way ticket to palookaville.

1808
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:05,260
"I was never no good
after that night, Charley.

1809
02:02:05,370 --> 02:02:09,200
"It was like a peak you reach,
and then it's downhill.

1810
02:02:11,040 --> 02:02:12,670
"It was you, Charley.

1811
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,000
"You was my brother.

1812
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:18,010
"You should've looked out
for me a little bit.

1813
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:21,280
"You should've looked out
for me just a little bit.

1814
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,440
"You should've taken care
of me just a little bit,

1815
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:28,350
"instead of making me take
them dives for the short-end money.

1816
02:02:28,890 --> 02:02:30,690
"You don't understand.

1817
02:02:31,390 --> 02:02:34,950
"I could've had class.
I could've been a contender.

1818
02:02:35,060 --> 02:02:39,900
"I could've been somebody,
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

1819
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,630
"Let's face it--
it was you, Charley.

1820
02:02:44,840 --> 02:02:47,470
- It was you, Charley."
- How you doin', Jake?

1821
02:02:48,010 --> 02:02:49,980
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1822
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:52,480
- Ready?
- You got about five minutes.

1823
02:02:53,350 --> 02:02:54,750
- You need anything?
- No.

1824
02:02:54,850 --> 02:02:55,980
You sure?

1825
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:58,150
I'm sure.

1826
02:03:02,520 --> 02:03:05,650
- A lot of people out there?
- Yeah, it's crowded.

1827
02:03:26,310 --> 02:03:27,940
Go get 'em, champ.

1828
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,970
I'm the boss, I'm the boss...
