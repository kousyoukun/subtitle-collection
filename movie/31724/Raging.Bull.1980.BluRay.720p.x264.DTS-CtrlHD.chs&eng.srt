就算你因为体重的关系输了
Let's say you lose because of your weight.

618
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,736

Are they gonna think you're not as tough as you were?

619
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,572
你不是同一个拳击手了吗?
You're not the same fighter?

620
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,407
那也好,他们会帮你安排
Good. They'll match you with all those guys

621
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,276
那些过去不敢和你比赛的人
they were afraid to match you with you before.

622
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,510
结果呢?你会痛宰他们 他们就得让你进入冠军赛
What happens? You'll kill 'em. And they gotta give you a title shot.

623
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,712

Now let's say you win, you beat Janiro.

630
00:45:37,567 --> 00:45:40,263

-你把他打败... -抱歉,你什么意思
- You beat him now... - Excuse me, what do you mean,

647
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,573
-长得帅? -我没说“长得帅”
- good-lookin'? - I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

648
00:46:17,674 --> 00:46:20,074
-我是说受欢迎,如果你赢了... -你刚才说什么...
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win... - But what were you just sayin'

649
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,667
-长得帅又受欢迎? -我没什么意思
- about good-lookin', popular? - I'm not sayin' anything.

650
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,975
-我只是说乔伊说得对 -你是权威吗?
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right. - Are you an authority, or what?

651
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,879
-没有... -出去
- Nothin'... - Get outta here.

652
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:30,009
出去,把宝宝带出去
Get outta here. Take the baby and get outta here.

653
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,616
每个人突然都变成权威了
Everybody all of a sudden's an authority about this.

654
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:36,658
第一,她怎么知道他长得帅?
Where'd she find out he's good-lookin', first of all?

655
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,988
她没有什么意思
She didn't mean nothin'.

656
00:46:40,897 --> 00:46:42,364
谁问你了?
Who asked you?

657
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,127
现在你要和我吵吗?
You gonna start with me now?

658
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,202
别人在讲话就不能插嘴
When people are talkin', you don't interrupt.

659
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:49,932
这不关你的事 尤其是我哥和他老婆之间的事
It's none of your business, especially if it's my brother and his wife.

660
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,405
和你一点关系也没有
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

661
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:54,102
走开,进去,带宝宝进去
Get outta here, go inside. Take the baby inside.

662
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:57,544
来,咱们离开这些凶巴巴的人
Come on. Let's leave the grouches here, okay?

663
00:46:57,647 --> 00:47:00,207
-走吧 -看不出来该换尿布了吗?
- Come on. - Change her diapers, can't you see?

664
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:03,081
-她又要哭了,她好臭 -是你害她哭的
- She's gonna cry, she stinks. - You make her cry.

665
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:07,111
-待会我让你哭 -来,走吧
- I'm gonna make you cry. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

666
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,292
-他们不懂事 -一百五十五磅...
- They're a couple of babies. - 155 pounds...

667
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:15,330
咱们去训练营

668
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,731
不受干扰,没有老婆,电话
No distractions, no wives, no phone calls.

669
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:21,667
没有人会烦你 我来拟出你的行程表
Nobody around to bother you. I'll write out your usual schedule,

670
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:24,400
-你的饮食... -听着,我想问你一件事
- your usual diet... - Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

671
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,409
我不在的时候 你有没有注意到她怪怪的?
When I'm away, you ever notice anything funny goin' on with her?

672
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,240
-谁,维琪吗? -对
- With who, Vickie? - Yeah.

673
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,677
比如说?
Like what?

674
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,748
你认为我是什么意思?
What do you think I mean?

675
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,915
我没注意到任何事
No, I don't notice anything.

676
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,078
我要你盯着她,好吗?
I want you to keep an eye on her, all right?

677
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,156
为什么,杰克? 她又没做错事
For what, Jack? She don't do anything wrong.

678
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:43,055
我不在的时候 我要你盯着她,好吗?
I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm away, all right?

679
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:46,095
你无缘无故找麻烦 我告诉你,你快不行了
You just start trouble for nothin', I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

680
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,527
我有理由的,好吗?
I got a reason, right?

681
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:50,293
你我都知道 女人只要找对时间
You and I both know, any woman, given the right time,

682
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,267
只要天时地利人和 她们就会乱来
the right place, the right circumstances, they'll do anything, right?

683
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,861
什么事都可能发生,好吗?
I mean, anything's possible. All right?

-你说得对 -你知道的
- You're right. - You oughta know.

685
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:00,640
你没说错,可是 你在找她麻烦,我刚才有看到
You're not wrong, but you're pickin' on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

686
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,371
你在担心你的体重 然后愈说愈烦闷
You're worried about your weight, you're gettin' aggravated,

687
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:06,040
你跟她说“什么?进去,谁问你了?”
and you tell her, "What are you? Go inside. Who asked ya?"

688
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:08,617
你拿那种事烦她 等于让她有借口出去
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna give her an excuse to go out.

689
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:11,810
-她在讲一个男人 -又怎样?
- She was talkin' about a guy. - So?

690
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:14,117
又怎样? 她在替你说话,她又没有...
So what? She was talkin' on your behalf, she wasn't...

691
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,193
替我说话?她在讲 一个小帅哥,说他长得帅
On my behalf? She was talkin' about a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

692
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:18,352
你在说什么?
What are you talkin' about?

693
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:20,156
那你就让他难看啊,那又怎样?
So you make him ugly, what's the difference?

694
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:21,525
-为什么? -你别管,照做就是了
- That's why? - Never mind, just do it.

695
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:22,598
好啦
All right.

696
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,069
你知道你该怎么做? 进去,对她好一点
You know what you should do? Go inside and be nice to her.

697
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,728
跟她和好
Make up with her.

698
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:30,931
跟她说你要带她出门 我们都出门
Tell her you're gonna take her out, we'll go out.

699
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,804
你想在离开前出去玩玩吧?
You wanna go out before you go away, don't you?

700
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,308
这样你才能放心地离开
This way, you go away with a clear head.

701
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,400
你带她出去
You know you took her out,

702
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,810
享用美酒大餐,开心一下
you wined and dined her, you had a good time.

703
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:38,881
好吗?
All right?

704
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,010
好,你想去哪?
All right. Where do you wanna go?

705
00:48:42,118 --> 00:48:44,678
-“出去”就对了 -好
- Well, "out" out, you know. - All right.

706
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:48,087
听着,把她拉到旁边去说
Listen, though, if you tell her now, pull her on the side.

707
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:50,352
别在莉诺面前说...
Don't say nothin' in front of Lenore...

708
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,451
-我不要带她去 -你想太多了
- 'cause I'm not takin' her. - It's on your head.

709
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,723
-好 -她不必跟我们去
- All right. - We can go without her.

710
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,664
-你想干嘛就干嘛 -我是啊
- Do what you're gonna do. - Oh, I am.

711
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,398

Come here.

734
00:50:37,634 --> 00:50:39,192

739
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,504

740
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:52,171
查理,我们在这里做什么?

Hey, that's some suit. He looks good, huh, Jack?

744
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:08,725
我以为那是我最棒的笑话

745
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,767
丽塔,看谁来了

750
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,140
-坐下来喝一杯 -不了,我得回去找杰克
- Sit down, have a drink. - I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

751
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,980
-我只是过来打个招呼 -好,甜心,谢谢你过来
- I just came by to say hello. - All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

752
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:33,886
-维琪这孩子不错 -她和那个无赖在一起
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know. - She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

753
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,855
她一定被那家伙打得很惨
She must've caught a hundred beatin's off that guy.

754
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,695
-你怎么去那么久? -我去汤米那桌打声招呼
- What took ya so long? - I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

755
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:46,030
我看到你和他们打招呼 但怎么去那么久?
I saw you say hello to them all. But what took ya so long?

756
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,966
没有,我打个招呼就回来了
Nothin', I said hello. I came back.

757
00:51:50,573 --> 00:51:53,542
-你还说了什么? -他问我要不要喝一杯
- What else did you say? - He asked me if I wanted a drink.

758
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:56,612
我说“不了,杰克和乔伊在那边” 然后我就离开了
I said, "No, Jake and Joey are over there," and I left.

759
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:58,806
你干嘛和沙维说话?
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

760
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:01,746
他问我乔伊有没有来 我说“他在那里”
He asked me if Joey was there, I said, "He's over there."

761
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:04,979
然后他说“汤米在那里 你要不要去打个招呼?”我就去了
Then he said, "Tommy's over there, why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

762
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:07,816
你对他有意思吗?
Are you interested in him?

763
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:09,915
没有,我怎么会对他有意思?
No, why would I be interested in him?

764
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,926
你确定你对他没有意思?
You sure you're not interested in him?

765
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:12,995
对
Yeah.

766
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,992
换句话说,你对他没意思 但是你有可能对别人
In other words, you're not interested in him, but you could be interested

767
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,467
-有意思吧? -杰克,别再说了
- in somebody? - Jake, don't start.

768
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:23,698
你干嘛...?闭嘴,不然我就扁你
What do you gotta? Hey, shut up, or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

769
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,502
你让我丢脸
You embarrass me.

770
00:52:25,608 --> 00:52:28,236
这是康伯先生请的
These are from Mr. Como.

771

我们都见不到你了,真是的
We never see ya anymore. For cryin' out loud.

784

你都不出现了? 连个电话也不打?怎么回事?
You never come around anymore? You can't even make a call? What is it?

785
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:18,725
我忙嘛 我到处去打拳,我很忙

793
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,444
那么吉尼洛得小心了,对吧?
Then Janiro's gotta watch his ass, right?

794
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:41,341
他是该小心
I think he should.

795
00:53:41,818 --> 00:53:44,116
前三,四场比赛 这家伙让我赢不少钱
Last three, four times, I won nothin' but money with the guy.

799
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:55,729
杰克,是真的吗? 你的体重增加了?
Jake, am I wrong? Did you gain a few pounds?

800
00:53:55,832 --> 00:53:58,562
只增加几磅 一下就可以减掉,没问题
A few pounds. I'll knock it off right away, though, no problem.

801
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:00,431
一下就减掉
Right off, right off.

802
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:06,005
我问你哦,我只是随便聊聊
Look, let me ask you somethin'. I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

803
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:09,909
如果我跟你说 你跟吉尼洛的这场比赛

我会说把全部的家当都押下去
I would say bet everything you got.

808

-全部? -全部
- Everything? - Everything.

809
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,756
因为我要打得他屁滚尿流
'Cause I'm gonna open his hole like this.

810
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,488
原谅我说粗话,小姐们
Excuse my French, girls.

811

- Did he say somethin' in the papers? - No, he's a nice kid.

815

他还长得很清秀
He's a pretty kid, too.

816
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:44,205
我很困扰,我不知道... 该上他还是打他
I don't know, I got a problem... if I should fuck him or fight him.

817

我们在床上的时候...
You ever think of anybody else...

835
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,907
你会想着别人吗?

我根本不知道我说了什么 我连他长什么样子都不知道
I don't even know what I said. I don't even know what he looks like.

843
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:51,436

我不知道,这无法预料的...
I don't know. You never know these things...

859

01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:46,766
-还有你哥哥,我没错 -别逼我在这里发飙
- and your brother. I'm not wrong. - Don't make me get nuts in this place.

898
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:48,002
你要我怎么办?
What am I supposed to do?

899
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,305
我二十岁了 却得每晚回家自己一个人睡觉?
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home and sleep by myself every night?

900
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:52,176
-你干嘛嫁给他? -因为我爱他
- What the fuck did you marry him for? - 'Cause I love him.

901
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:53,942
-是吗? -对,我爱他
- You do? - Yeah, I love him.

902
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,019
但你要我怎么办? 他根本不想上我
What am I supposed to do? This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

903
01:00:58,187 --> 01:00:59,745
他只是参赛太久了
He's just been a contender too long.

904
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:02,983
等他赢得冠军就好了 到时候就没事了
He'll be all right as soon as he gets his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

905
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:05,754
你就不必像个花痴一样乱跑了
You won't have to go fuckin' runnin' around when he does.

906
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:08,227
杰克不可能成为冠军 太多人讨厌他了
Jake is never gonna be champ. Too many people hate him.

907
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,856
-而你却和那些人喝酒! -我要把我的酒喝完
- And you're drinking with them! - And I'm gonna finish my drink

908
01:01:10,967 --> 01:01:13,765
-而且我要开心一下 -去拿你的东西
- and I'm gonna have a good time. - Get your stuff.

909
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,936
我说了你不能留在这里
I said you ain't stayin' here.

910
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:21,031
-去拿你的东西 -我要留下来
- Get your stuff. - I'm stayin'.

911
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:23,111
你在让我哥哥出糗,去拿东西
You're making an asshole out of my brother, get your stuff.

912
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:24,440
-别激动嘛 -闭嘴
- Come on, relax. - Shut up.

913
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:26,242
管你自己它妈的的事,闭嘴
Mind your fuckin' business and shut up.

914
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,943
-你误会我们了 -我是不是叫你闭嘴?
- You're taking this all wrong. - I said shut up, didn't I?!

915
01:01:29,051 --> 01:01:30,951
你怎么回事? 我们又没有做什么
What's the matter with you? There's nothin' goin' on here.

916
01:01:31,053 --> 01:01:33,180
我们是清白的 我们只是喝几杯酒
This is innocent. We're only having a few drinks.

917
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:36,718
-别激动,没问题 -你知道不是那么一回事
- Relax, no problem. - Come on, you know better than that.

918
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,193
-好了,大家都冷静下来 -别激动嘛
- All right. Let's all calm down. - Just relax, come on.

919
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:41,388
-我们是多年的朋友了 -我只是不爽
- We've been friends a long time. - I'm just upset.

920
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:44,091
-她是我大嫂... -我们没有做什么
- It's my brother's wife... - There's nothing goin' on over here.

921
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,189
对不起,真的
I'm sorry, I really am.

922
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:46,598
大家是朋友,可以讲清楚的...
We're friends, we can straighten this...

923
01:01:47,136 --> 01:01:49,366
是吗?没做什么?!
Right? Nothing going on?!

924
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:52,600
没做什么?!你这个下三滥!
Nothing going on?! Ya dirty cocksucker!

925
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:59,341
-你这老不死的! -放开!叫他放手!
- Fuckin' hard-on! - Get off! Get him off!

926
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:02,611
我要狠狠教训你一顿,下三滥!
I'll bite your fuckin' head off, ya cocksucker!

927
01:02:02,718 --> 01:02:05,619
滚出去,乔伊! 你在搞什么啊?!
Get outta here, Joey! What the fuck are you doin'?!

928
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:08,323
-小心点!别这样! -别碰我!
- Easy, easy! Come on! - Get your hands off me!

929
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:10,187
-别这样! -别这样!
- Come on! - Come on!

930
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,692
混蛋
Fuckin' cunt.

931
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:16,025
滚!滚出去!
Get out! Get outta the way!

932
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,430
杂碎!我要把你的眼睛挖出来!
Oh, scumbag! I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

933
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:24,464
你混帐...你疯了吗?
Hey, you fuckin'... what are you, nuts?!

934
01:02:24,573 --> 01:02:25,597
别提到汤米
Don't mention Tommy.

935
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,767
咱们最好井水不犯河水
You do what you do, and we do what we gotta do.

936
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:29,708
-别扯到别人 -你误会了,乔
- Don't mention no names. - No, you're wrong, Joe.

937
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,939
他误会了 别在这里惹麻烦
He's wrong. No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

938
01:02:37,753 --> 01:02:40,381
我叫你滚出去,你这个无赖!
I said get outta here, ya fuckin' mamone!

939
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:43,185
给我过来,你混蛋!
Get back there, ya fuck, ya!

940
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,889
大家别激动,别激动嘛
Take it easy, people. Come on, now, take it easy.

941
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:50,394
你完了,你这个王八蛋!
You've had it, you rat bastard!

942
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,148
迪邦奈俱乐部

943
01:03:07,249 --> 01:03:08,739
会员专属

944
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:11,012
你们两个认识很多年了
You guys have a lot of years between you,

945
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,145
你们一起做了不少事
and you've done a lot of things together.

946
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:15,849
我明白她是你的大嫂,乔伊
I understand, Joey, it was your brother's wife.

947
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,725
但是你不能打人
But you don't raise your hands,

948
01:03:16,725 --> 01:03:17,555
但是你不能打人
But you don't raise your hands,

949
01:03:17,726 --> 01:03:20,991
你不能在那样的地方闹事
you don't create a scene like that in a place like that.

950
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,827
现在大家都把话说清楚了
Now, we've heard everybody's point of view here,

951
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:26,094
我们要把这件事给忘了
and we're gonna forget about it.

952
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:29,660
这种事不该忘 但是我们要把它忘掉
I shouldn't forget about it, but we're gonna forget about it.

953
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,432
好吗?
Right?

954
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:33,599
现在我要你们两个
What I want you to do now, you two guys,

955
01:03:33,709 --> 01:03:36,803
握手和好,把这整件事忘了
I want you to shake hands, forget this whole thing,

956
01:03:36,912 --> 01:03:38,436
不要记恨
and no grudges.

957
01:03:38,547 --> 01:03:41,345
那是最重要的...不要记恨
That's the most important thing... no grudges.

958
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,115
好,来握个手吧
Now, come on, shake hands.

959
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:51,292
只要你没问题,我就没问题
It's all right with me if it's all right with you.

960
01:03:51,393 --> 01:03:52,519
好吗?
All right?

961
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,556
真希望没发生这种事
I only wish this thing never happened.

962
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,495
我们都希望没这回事
We all wish it never happened.

963
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,728
好吗?你不会有事的
Right? You'll get over it.

964
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:03,964
沙维,让我和他单独谈谈
Salvy, let me talk with him alone a minute.

965
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,199
好啊
Yeah, all right.

966
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:09,674
咱们星期一,二或改天见?
I'll see you Monday, Tuesday or somethin', all right?

967
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:11,803
对不起,我忘了
I'm sorry, I forgot all about it.

968
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:15,146
你疯了吗?痛死我了
What are you, fucking nuts? You're killin' me.

969
01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:22,922
先不管这些,家里都好吧?
Aside from everything else, is the family all right?

970
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,789
对,他们都好,大家都好
Yeah, they're fine. Everybody's fine.

971
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,591
你怎么搞的?不会说话吗?
What is it with you? You can't talk?

972
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,224
-我说了啊,什么意思? -我知道
- I'm talkin', what do you mean? - I know.

973
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:36,600
你这是什么态度? 我真搞不懂你
Why have you got this funny attitude? I can't figure you out.

974
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:40,768
这么简短的回答? “对,他们都好”
What is it with all the quick answers? "Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

975
01:04:41,977 --> 01:04:44,036
你想赶快离开这儿是不是?
You wanna get outta here fast or something?

976
01:04:44,146 --> 01:04:45,511
不,没这回事
No, it's nothin' like that.

977
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:48,515
只是因为之前的气,还有...
It's just all the aggravation and everything and...

978
01:04:49,084 --> 01:04:50,551
打了一场架嘛
all the fights and all.

979
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,789
听我说,杰克他...
Listen to me. Now, Jake...

980
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,285
这家伙很让人难堪
the guy's become an embarrassment.

981
01:04:58,994 --> 01:05:02,122
他让我在一些人的面前难堪
He's embarrassin' me with certain people,

982
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:04,495
我的面子挂不住
and I'm lookin' very bad.

983
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:08,466
我想提拔他这个自己人都不行
I can't deliver a kid from my own goddamn neighborhood.

984
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:10,062
他有什么问题?
What is it with him?

985
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:13,141
他干嘛跟自己过不去?
Why does he have to make it so hard on himself?

986
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,870
他来找我,我就让他平步青云
He comes to me, I make it easier for him.

987
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,974
他真是死脑筋
The man's got a head of rock.

988
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,419
这很难解释,汤米,他...
You know, it's hard to explain, Tommy, he's...

989
01:05:29,124 --> 01:05:30,421
杰克尊敬你
Jack respects you.

990
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,994
他根本不跟人打招呼的
I mean, he don't even say hello to anybody.

991
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,393
但是他跟你说话,他喜欢你
You he talks to, he likes you.

992
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:39,493
只是当他拿定主意的时候
It's just that when he gets somethin' on his mind,

993
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:42,594
他就很固执,他喜欢我行我素
he's got a hard head, he likes to do things his own way.

994
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,071
耶稣可以走下十字架来
Jesus Christ could come off the cross sometimes,

995
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:47,642
他也不在乎,他只要随心所欲
he don't give a fuck, he's gonna do what he wants to do,

996
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,736
他想靠自己成功 他认为他可以靠自己成功
he wants to make it on his own. He thinks he can make it on his own.

997
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:52,143
靠自己成功
Make it on his own.

998
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:57,311
他以为他可以靠自己就变成冠军?
He thinks he's gonna walk in there and become champion on his own?

999
01:05:58,053 --> 01:06:00,886
-他疯了,你知道他疯了 -对,他疯了
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts. - Yeah, he's crazy.

1000
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:04,391
是他不尊重任何人 他谁的话也不听
And he's got no respect for nobody, he doesn't listen to nobody.

1001
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:05,790
不是因为他疯了
That's not crazy.

1002
01:06:05,894 --> 01:06:09,295
-不过他尊重你 -他谁也不尊重
- He respects you, though. - He doesn't respect anybody.

1003
01:06:09,398 --> 01:06:11,525
你帮我这个忙,懂不懂?
Now, you do this for me, you understand?

1004
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:16,833
你去跟他说 我才不在乎他有多厉害
You tell him I don't care how colorful he is, how great he is.

1005
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:18,566
他可以打败世上所有的
He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons

1006
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,699
罗宾森和吉尼洛
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

1007
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:24,370
但是他进不了冠军赛的 没有我们帮忙就不可能
But he ain't gonna get a shot at that title, not without us, he ain't.

1008
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,307
你是个聪明人
Now, you're a smart kid.

1009
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,810
你去找他,跟他说...
You go to him, you tell him...

1010
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:36,254
王八蛋
Son of a bitch.

1011
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,920
这双鞋花了二十大元
Twenty dollar shoe here.

1012
01:06:46,135 --> 01:06:48,103
你不问我出了什么事吗?
Aren't you gonna ask me what happened?

1013
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:53,434
怎么了?
What's the matter?

1014
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:58,773
-怎么回事? -我记得在这里见到她的
- What's wrong? - I remember when I met her here.

1015
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,942
-谁? -维琪
- Who? - Vickie.

1016
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:07,956
怎么了?她又做了什么?
Why, what's the matter? What'd she do now?

1017
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:14,228
我知道她在搞鬼 我真想逮到她一次
I know she's doin' somethin', I just wanna catch her once.

1018
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,456
一次就好
Just once.

1019
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:22,037
杰克,帮你自己一个忙好不好?
Hey, Jack. Wanna do yourself a favor?

1020
01:07:22,571 --> 01:07:24,801
把她扁一顿,赶出去
Bust her fuckin' hole, throw her out.

1021
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,901
不然就和她在一起 让她毁了你的一生
Either that, or live with her and let her ruin your life,

1022
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,807
因为她毁了你的生活
'cause that's what's happenin'.

1023
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:35,583
你还能忍多久? 你还要吃几次瘪?
How much could you take? How much shit could you take?

1024
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,019
他说了什么?

01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,673
我就是这个意思
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1279
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,918
-怎么样? -好像有东西了
- How's that? - That looks like somethin'.

1280
01:23:17,992 --> 01:23:21,052
后退点,你的肚子挡到看不到
Get back, I can't see nothin' with your stomach in the way.

1281
01:23:22,263 --> 01:23:24,254
你干嘛瞪我?
What are you givin' me dirty looks for?

1282
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:29,899
你是个冠军,却没命地狂吃
Supposed to be a champion, ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1283
01:23:30,004 --> 01:23:31,801
尽管吃吧... 你忘了你等多久
That's it, go ahead... forget how long it took you

1284
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:33,999
才进入冠军赛,多年来的辛苦
to get to the title, all the years, the hard work.

1285
01:23:34,108 --> 01:23:36,838
你都忘了 你下个月要卫冕赛,你还吃
You forgot. You're gonna defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1286
01:23:37,612 --> 01:23:40,240
还瞪我,好像我胡言乱语似的
Give me dirty looks like I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1287
01:23:43,785 --> 01:23:46,413
你在柯帕酒吧 和沙维是怎么回事?
What happened with you and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1288
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,513
-什么时候? -你痛扁他那次
- When? - When you gave him a beatin'.

1289
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,452
你是说我用计程车门撞他的头
You mean when I caught his head in the taxicab door,

1290
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:54,790
还用玻璃打他那次?
and was bangin' it, smacked him with a glass?

1291
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,830
-对 -我跟你讲过了
- Yeah. - I told you about that.

1292
01:23:57,465 --> 01:23:58,932
-没有吗? -没有
- Didn't I? - No.

1293
01:23:59,033 --> 01:24:01,433
-我没跟你说过? -没有,你没说过
- I never told you? - No, you never told me.

1294
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,867
反正没什么大不了的
It was no big thing, anyway.

1295
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:05,768
我打他的嘴 他喝醉了,开始打起来
I smacked him in the mouth, he was drunk, he started some shit.

1296
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:08,068
还得去市区和汤米解决这件事
Had to go downtown, straighten it all out with Tommy.

1297
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:10,167
反正现在已经没事了
It's all forgotten about, supposedly, anyway.

1298
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,371
你怎么没跟我说过?
How come you never told me about it?

1299
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,710
那件事又和你无关
It didn't have anything to do with you.

1300
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:18,182
-和我无关? -对啊
- Had nothin' to do with me? - No.

1301
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:22,017
那和谁有关...维琪吗?
Who'd it have somethin' to do with... Vickie?

1302
01:24:22,657 --> 01:24:25,558
我不是才跟你解释了整件事吗?
I just explained the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1303
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:27,651
-对 -那是我和沙维的事
- Yeah. - It was between me and Salvy.

1304
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:31,163
如果是和你或维琪有关 我会告诉你的
If it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1305
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,062
我听到的不是这样,乔
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1306

1320
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,178
杰克,别又开始了

1325
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,049
完全和你无关
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1326

I'm not tellin' ya anything. I'm gonna leave.

你就不会有闺房的问题了
You won't have troubles upstairs in your bedroom,

1380

还有这条街上的每个人
and everybody else on the fuckin' street.

What do you want? You're nothin' but a fat pig, selfish fool!

你要去哪里,混帐?
Where are you goin', you bastard?

1416
01:30:54,415 --> 01:30:56,280
你这个变态!你要去哪里?
You sick animal! Where you goin'?

01:30:56,383 --> 01:31:00,285
放开我!放开我,杂碎!
Let me go! Get off of me, ya piece of shit!

1418
01:31:00,387 --> 01:31:02,878
如果我再看到你用手碰盘子
If I see you put your hands in that plate one more time,

1419
01:31:02,990 --> 01:31:04,890
我就用这把刀刺你,听到没?
I'm gonna stab you with this knife, ya hear me?

1420

我叫你不要用手吃东西!
I told ya, keep your hands outta the plate!

1421
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:11,762
我们为什么不能 安静吃饭?别激动
Why can't we eat in peace around here? Just relax.

1422
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,800
我得和你一样吗?像个野人...
Do I have to eat like you? Like a gavone, like...

1424
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:18,705
你上我老婆是不是?!
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1425
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:23,804
放开他!
Get off of him!

1426
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:30,177

Honey, look... I'm a bum without you and the kids, don't go.

1432
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:33,231
只是...
Just...

1433
01:33:54,395 --> 01:33:56,955
只剩不到一分钟 拉莫塔就快要失去
Less than a minute to go, and La Motta is losing the title

1434
01:33:57,064 --> 01:33:59,294
他打败马赛瑟登 而赢来的冠军头衔
that he won from the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1435
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,301
在瑟登不幸坠机身亡之后
After the tragic plane crash that took Cerdan's life,

1436
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:05,304

with lefts and rights to the head. Another left, another right to the jaw.

1441
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:21,277
拉莫塔反守为攻 他一直是在装死!
La Motta turns around, he's been playing possum!

1442
01:34:21,388 --> 01:34:24,050

1446
01:34:35,369 --> 01:34:38,566
他晃到绳索旁倒下了!
And he wobbles into the ropes and goes down!

1447
01:34:39,106 --> 01:34:41,904
道惠倒下了 裁判路汉勒跑过来
Dauthuille is down, and referee Lou Handler comes over

1448
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:45,069
他开始计时 他试着爬起来
and starts the count. He's trying to get up.

1449
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,874

冠军,我想问你几个问题

1470
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:35,384
沙维,这一点也不好笑

真是年度大赛

1478
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:41,417
下次酒保问你喝什么的话
The next time that friendly bartender says, "What'll you have?"

Give him that answer the whole world gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1480
01:37:47,928 --> 01:37:50,829
拉莫塔的拳正中要害
Those punches by La Motta explain themselves.

1481
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:54,162
他们在1942年 和1945年间对打五次
They fought five times between 1942 and 1945.

It has so far been a blazing bout for the Middleweight Championship.

1483

拉莫塔的表现优异 却无法获得高分
In that great action by La Motta, he couldn't score the big one.

1484

那是他的最后机会了
That's it, that was his last shot.

1487
01:38:12,286 --> 01:38:14,277

1488
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:27,460
罗宾森痛击拉莫塔 他现在让他好看
Robinson hurting La Motta, he's hurting him now.

1489

他把拉莫塔逼到死角去了
He has La Motta on queer street, holding on.

1490
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,837

-你站在那儿干嘛? -显然疲累的罗宾森
- What are you standin' there for? - Robinson, apparently tired,

1494
01:38:50,657 --> 01:38:53,558
击出完美的一拳 打得杰克拉莫塔
punched with a "fare thee well," and rocked Jake La Motta

1495
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:55,321
-天摇地动 -来啊,来啊!
- right to his heels. - Come on, Ray, come on!

1496
01:40:02,229 --> 01:40:04,094
这几拳干净俐落
These are clean, whistling shots.

1497
01:40:04,197 --> 01:40:06,893
不知道他如何能屹立不倒
How he can survive them, nobody knows.

1498
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,230
没有人能承受这些重拳!
No man can endure this pummeling!

1499
01:40:09,336 --> 01:40:12,100
在法兰奇西柯拉的指示下...

1503
01:40:19,746 --> 01:40:22,772

1504
01:40:22,883 --> 01:40:25,909
-让他彻底败退 -罗宾森

1505
01:40:26,019 --> 01:40:29,113
这时候杰克还不想放弃
And when I say that, I mean Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1506

Why are you pulling out of Wednesday's fight?

1531
01:41:42,195 --> 01:41:44,425
结束了...我的拳击生涯结束了
It's over for me... boxing's over for me.

1532
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:46,290
我不打了
I'm through.

1533
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,261
我受够了成天担心体重
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1534
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:52,429
我以前满脑子只想着体重
That's all I used to think about was weight, weight, weight.

1535
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:55,007
久了你就明白生命中还有别的事物
After a while, you realize there are other things in life.

1536
01:41:55,075 --> 01:41:57,475
我很感激我的拳击生涯
I'm very grateful. Boxing's been good to me.

1537
01:41:57,577 --> 01:41:59,977
我有一栋豪宅,有三个好孩子
I got a nice house, I got three great kids.

1538
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:03,941
我有个又美又好的老婆 我还能要求什么?
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife. What more could I ask for?

1539
01:42:05,652 --> 01:42:08,143
-你叫什么名字? -巴伯
- Hey, what's your name? - Bob.

1540
01:42:08,255 --> 01:42:09,449
照张相吧,巴伯
Take a picture, Bob.

1541
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,220
甜心,让他照张相...为了我们
Let him take a picture of ya, honey... for us.

1542
01:42:12,325 --> 01:42:13,952
来,笑一个
Go ahead, smile.

1543
01:42:16,196 --> 01:42:17,390
谢谢你,巴伯
Thank you, Bob.

1544
01:42:17,497 --> 01:42:20,295
照一张全家福 杰克,过来坐在这里
Take a picture of all of us. Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1545
01:42:24,571 --> 01:42:26,869
好,大家笑一个
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1546
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,942
拉莫塔太太 你对杰克退休有什么看法?
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel about Jake's retirement?

1547
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:33,273
我觉得很棒
I think it's great.

1548
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,712
他选择退休的时机很恰当
He picked the right time to stop fightin'.

1549
01:42:35,816 --> 01:42:37,613
他现在每天在家陪我们
He's home with us all the time now.

1550
01:42:37,751 --> 01:42:39,844
-真的很棒 -你知道吗?你讲完了吗?
- It's really good. - You know what? You through?

1551
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:42,513
-对不起,你讲完了? -对
- Excuse me, you through? - Yeah.

1552
01:42:42,622 --> 01:42:44,783
我才在柯林斯大道买了一间俱乐部
I just bought a club on Collins Avenue.

1553
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:48,122
那是一间酒吧加酒店 你猜我要取什么名字?
It's a bar, package store, everything. Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1554
01:42:48,228 --> 01:42:49,195
我不知道
I don't know.

1555
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:51,093
-你要取什么名字? -猜一下
- What are you gonna call it? - Take a guess.

1556
01:42:52,899 --> 01:42:55,697
杰克拉莫塔酒店

1557
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:05,607
好了,闭嘴 够了,够了
All right, shut up. Enough, enough.

1558
01:43:07,647 --> 01:43:08,636
谢谢
Thank you.

1559
01:43:14,387 --> 01:43:17,015
只是想看看麦克风
Just wanted to see what the microphone

1560
01:43:17,123 --> 01:43:19,489
在美女的身上听来如何
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1561
01:43:26,933 --> 01:43:28,230
都听到了吧
See how that sounds.

1562
01:43:29,302 --> 01:43:30,769
大家晚安
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1563
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:33,032
从最后一次 在麦迪森广场花园比赛以来
I haven't seen so many losers since my last fight

1564
01:43:33,139 --> 01:43:34,606
我还没见过这么多的废物
at Madison Square Garden.

1565
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:38,744
好了,甜心
Okay, honey.

1566
01:43:39,946 --> 01:43:41,413
谢谢,美女
Thank you, doll.

1567
01:43:42,282 --> 01:43:44,409
-不得了吧? -再给我们来一杯
- Isn't that somethin'? - Bring us another drink.

1568
01:43:44,518 --> 01:43:46,145
-干杯 -干杯
- Salute. - Salute.

1569
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:50,487
看看这个美女
Look at this terrific girl.

1570
01:43:50,590 --> 01:43:52,922
她是让你想带回家去 见父亲的那种女孩
She's the kinda girl you wanna bring home to your father,

1571
01:43:53,026 --> 01:43:55,324
尤其如果他是变态的话
especially if he's a degenerate.

1572
01:43:56,630 --> 01:43:57,756
是我说的吗?
Did I say that?

1573
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:03,160
不,说真的,今天晚上很高兴
Nah, seriously, folks, it's a thrill to be standing here

1574
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:06,000
能站在你们这些美丽的观众面前
before all you wonderful people tonight.

1575
01:44:06,106 --> 01:44:08,404
事实上,我很高兴我能站着
In fact, it's a thrill to be standing.

1576
01:44:10,977 --> 01:44:14,003
如果你们相信 我很高兴站在你们面前...
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin' before you wonderful people, then...

1577
01:44:14,114 --> 01:44:15,308
那你们就是大骗子
you're all full of shit.

1578
01:44:18,818 --> 01:44:21,184
对了,我和我老婆维琪要结婚了
By the way, me and my wife Vickie's gettin' married.

1579
01:44:21,288 --> 01:44:23,518
我在说什么?我疯了
What am I talkin' about? I'm out of it.

1580
01:44:25,759 --> 01:44:28,227
她在吗?她不在
Is she here? She's not here.

1581
01:44:28,295 --> 01:44:30,126
维琪? 不,她不在这儿
Vickie? Nah, she's not here.

1582
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:32,892
对了,我和我老婆维琪要庆祝...
By the way, me and my wife Vickie's gonna celebrate...

1583
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:35,467
刚才说错...我们结婚十一年
it's a little different... our 11th wedding anniversary.

1584
01:44:36,169 --> 01:44:37,796
谢谢
Thank you.

1585
01:44:39,439 --> 01:44:41,134
那让我想起我的两个朋友
That reminds me about two friends of mine.

1586
01:44:41,241 --> 01:44:43,141
一个已婚,一个单身
One was married, one was single.

1587
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:45,643
已婚的那个跟单身的说
The married guy tells the single guy,

1588
01:44:45,745 --> 01:44:47,474
“你怎么回事?”
"What's the matter with you?

1589
01:44:47,647 --> 01:44:49,740
“你怎么回事? 看看我再看看你”
"What's the matter with you? Look at me, and look at you.

1590
01:44:49,849 --> 01:44:52,647
“看看我再看看你”
And look at me, and look at you."

1591
01:44:55,622 --> 01:44:57,089
让我继续说下去
Let me get on with it.

1592
01:44:57,724 --> 01:44:59,783
“我晚上回家就看到我老婆”
"When I come home at night, my wife's at the door

1593
01:44:59,893 --> 01:45:01,360
“手里拿着酒等我”
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1594
01:45:01,428 --> 01:45:03,555
“然后她让我洗个热水澡”
"Then she gives me a nice hot bath,

1595
01:45:03,663 --> 01:45:05,654
“然后她替我按摩”
"then she gives me a nice rubdown,

1596
01:45:05,765 --> 01:45:07,665
“然后她激情地和我做爱”
"then she makes passionate love to me,

1597
01:45:07,767 --> 01:45:09,496
“然后她做晚餐给我吃”
"and then she makes me a nice dinner.

1598
01:45:09,603 --> 01:45:12,163
“真是夫复何求?你该试试”
What more could you ask for? You oughta try that."

1599
01:45:12,305 --> 01:45:14,830
另一个朋友说“嘿,听来很棒”
The other friend says, "Hey, that sounds great.

1600
01:45:14,908 --> 01:45:16,375
“你老婆几点回家?”
What time does your wife get home?"

1601
01:45:21,481 --> 01:45:24,712
我知道我不是奥利维 但如果他和罗宾森对打的话
I know I'm no Olivier, but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1602
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:26,376
他会说
he would say

1603
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:29,614
重点不在于比赛
that the thing ain't the ring,

1604
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:31,623
而在于娱乐
it's the play.

1605
01:45:32,425 --> 01:45:34,222
给我一个舞台
So give me a stage

1606
01:45:34,327 --> 01:45:36,625
让我这只公牛发威吧
where this bull here can rage,

1607
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,630
虽然我可以打斗
and though I can fight,

1608
01:45:38,732 --> 01:45:41,132
我宁愿吟诵
I'd much rather hear myself recite.

1609
01:45:43,103 --> 01:45:48,735
那才是娱乐!
That's entertainment!

1610
01:46:12,766 --> 01:46:14,563
杰克,你好吗?
Jake, how have you been?

1611
01:46:16,636 --> 01:46:19,696
嘿!太精彩了
Hey! You were just great.

1612
01:46:19,839 --> 01:46:22,364
好在罗宾森今晚没来,对吧?
It's a good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight, huh?

1613
01:46:22,475 --> 01:46:25,467
-他上星期讲过这个笑话 -少来!
- He told that joke last week. - Come on!

1614
01:46:25,578 --> 01:46:28,046
他老了,不断说一样的话
He repeats himself, gettin' a little senile.

1615
01:46:28,848 --> 01:46:31,146
这位是州检察官布朗森
I'd like you to meet State's Attorney Bronson.

1616
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:33,378
-你好吗?很高兴认识你 -他的夫人
- How are ya? Nice to meet you. - And his wife.

1617
01:46:33,486 --> 01:46:34,953
-很高兴认识你 -你不该是这星期来吧
- Nice to meet you. - You shouldn't be here this week.

1618
01:46:35,021 --> 01:46:38,422
我们是下星期才交保护费,对吧?
It's next week we got the shakedown payments, right?

1619
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:42,024
很高兴见到你
It's good seein' you.

1620
01:46:42,162 --> 01:46:43,390
那是开玩笑对不对?
That is a joke, right?

1621
01:46:43,496 --> 01:46:45,726
开玩笑的... 只有你才知道是不是玩笑
It's a joke... only you know if it's a joke.

1622
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:47,459
他只是开玩笑吧?
He's just kidding, right?

1623
01:46:48,001 --> 01:46:49,468
好,我们待会再讨论
All right, we'll talk about it later.

1624
01:46:50,170 --> 01:46:52,297
-这位是尊夫人? -对,布朗森太太
- This is your wife? - Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1625
01:46:52,405 --> 01:46:54,202
很漂亮,真是幸会
Very pretty lady. Charmed to meet you.

1626
01:46:54,307 --> 01:46:56,172
-谢谢 -他是个好人
- Thank you. - He's really a nice guy.

1627
01:46:56,276 --> 01:46:58,574
你开得起玩笑吧,美女?
You can take a joke, can't you, doll?

1628
01:47:00,714 --> 01:47:02,375
-对不起 -没关系
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

1629
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:07,243
嘿,卡罗?卡罗!
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1630
01:47:08,121 --> 01:47:10,919
再给他们拿酒来 这里出状况了
Give 'em another drink. Somethin' happened over here.

1631
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:14,518
-亲爱的琳达,过来 -尊夫人呢?
- Darling, Linda, come here. - Where's your wife?

1632
01:47:14,627 --> 01:47:15,924
-我老婆? -对,为什么她没来?
- My wife? - Yeah, why isn't she here?

1633
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:17,587
关你什么事? 你想我会把她带来
What's it to you? You think I'm gonna bring her around here,

1634
01:47:17,697 --> 01:47:20,723
-让你们这些无赖追她吗? -别这样!
- let you bums get involved with her? - Come on!

1635
01:47:20,834 --> 01:47:23,064
尤其是州检察官在这儿?
Especially the State's Attorney over here?

1636
01:47:23,169 --> 01:47:25,467
他很常来,亲爱的,盯紧他
He comes here a lot, darling, watch him.

1637
01:47:25,572 --> 01:47:27,130
他知道我只是开玩笑
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1638
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,208
-谢谢 -盯着他
- Thank you. - Keep an eye on him.

1639
01:47:29,642 --> 01:47:30,870
有什么问题?
What's the problem?

1640
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:32,001
没什么大问题
There's really not a problem.

1641
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:34,979
她看来不像二十一岁 所以我请她出示身份证
She doesn't look 21, so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1642
01:47:35,515 --> 01:47:37,142
-你几岁,甜心? -二十一岁
- How old are you, honey? - Twenty-one.

1643
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:38,547
-二十一? -嗯
- Twenty-one? - Mm-hmm.

1644
01:47:39,085 --> 01:47:40,916
你能证明你二十一岁吗?
Can you prove that you're 21?

1645
01:47:41,020 --> 01:47:42,988
-嗯 -证明给我看
- Mm-hmm. - Prove it to me.

1646
01:47:48,595 --> 01:47:51,996
这么会接吻的女孩 可以随时来我的店里喝酒
Any girl that can kiss like that can drink at my joint anytime.

1647
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:53,395
你呢?你几岁?
What about you? How old are you?

1648
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:55,900
-二十一岁 -你能证明你二十一岁吗?
- Twenty-one. - Can you prove that you're 21?

1649
01:47:56,002 --> 01:47:57,970
-可以 -你可以证明给我看吗?

1650
01:47:58,071 --> 01:47:59,368
过来
Come here.

1651
01:48:11,451 --> 01:48:12,577
她也二十一岁吗?
She's 21, too?

1652
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:16,589
我相信她也是二十一岁
She has convinced me that she's 21, too.

1653
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:35,071
-小心,我在倒酒 -你的夫人在外面
- Watch it while I'm pouring. - Your wife's outside.

1654
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:37,643
-她在等你 -怎么不大声一点?
- She's waitin' for you. - Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1655
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:52,788
好了
There.

1656
01:48:58,264 --> 01:48:59,390
拜托,杰克
Come on, Jake.

1657
01:49:05,772 --> 01:49:07,706
寂寞的夜
Lonely nights

1658
01:49:08,875 --> 01:49:11,708
我好寂寞
I'm so lonely

1659
01:49:12,245 --> 01:49:14,543
求你回家
