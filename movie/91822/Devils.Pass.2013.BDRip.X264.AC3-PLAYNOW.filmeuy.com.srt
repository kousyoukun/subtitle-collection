3
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:49,709
- Okay, I'm rolling.

4
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:51,269
- My name is Holly King.

5
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:54,976
I'm a psychology student
at the University of Oregon.

6
00:01:55,017 --> 00:01:57,952
In 2008, I saw a news report

7
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,922
about 30 elite scientists
that had gotten together

8
00:02:00,956 --> 00:02:04,153
in a remote area
of the Ural Mountains in Russia.

9
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,626
They were trying to solve
a mystery

10
00:02:05,661 --> 00:02:08,858
that had baffled the world
for almost 50 years.

11
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:11,924
It had become known
as the Dyatlov Pass Incident

12
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:15,061
after a leader of an expedition
there in 1959

13
00:02:15,104 --> 00:02:16,969
named Igor Dyatlov.

14
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:20,305
They failed,
but I was riveted by the story.

15
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:23,641
So when my favorite professor,
Dr. Kittles, assigned the class

16
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,306
a project
on that very same incident,

17
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,837
I couldn't believe it.

18
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:29,214
I mentioned it to a buddy
of mine, Jensen,

19
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,718
a film student here,

20
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:32,983
and he said
that we should make a film.

21
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:36,822
So we applied for a grant,
and...

22
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,019
we got it.

23
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,925
Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

24
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:42,692
- So tell us what happened.

25
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,529
- Uh, I first heard
about the incident

26
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:47,161
when a Russian journalist
named Yuri Yarovoi

27
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,465
published
a fictionalized account of it

28
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:50,233
in a book.

29
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:54,636
- Of course,
they had him killed.

30
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:00,911
I mean, it didn't matter
that he fictionalized it.

31
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,386
They didn't want anybody talking
about Dyatlov.

32
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,217
<i>- And I began using
the facts</i>

33
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:07,279
of the incident

34
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:08,847
as a teaching exercise
in psychology

35
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,859
because there's so much that
we know about what happened

36
00:03:10,893 --> 00:03:14,056
at Dyatlov's Pass,
so many details,

37
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:17,065
and yet the whole thing
remains shrouded in mystery.

38
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,498
<i>- What are some
of the explanations</i>

39
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,092
<i>that you tend to get?</i>

40
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:24,232
<i>- The most common, cold,
scientific explanation I get</i>

41
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:27,208
<i>is a condition called
hypothermic dementia.</i>

42
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:28,835
- Hypothermic dementia.

43
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:31,506
Yup, that is literally
what everybody says.

44
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:37,417
But, um, my favorite is, um,
"paradoxical undressing."

45
00:03:37,453 --> 00:03:38,579
- That does actually happen,
though,

46
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,816
to people suffering
with severe hypothermia.

47
00:03:40,856 --> 00:03:43,188
They get disoriented,
think that they're overheating,

48
00:03:43,225 --> 00:03:44,783
and then start
taking off their clothes.

49
00:03:44,827 --> 00:03:45,987
Come on!

50
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:48,724
Holly, these were nine
experienced backpackers.

51
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:50,095
- Yeah?

52
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:53,624
- You're telling me that
they all got severe hypothermia

53
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,830
at the same time
on the same night?

54
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,237
- Maybe.

55
00:03:58,274 --> 00:04:00,606
- They'd been out there
for three days already.

56
00:04:00,643 --> 00:04:02,167
Why, then?

57
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:06,147
<i>- An avalanche
is another frequent answer.</i>

58
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:09,481
- That is even stupider
than paradoxical undressing.

59
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:10,815
- Why?

60
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:12,081
- If they could hear
an avalanche,

61
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:13,281
then why did they
stay away from the camp

62
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:15,290
for three hours
with no shoes?

63
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:17,986
<i>- But in truth, there are
innumerable answers</i>

64
00:04:18,027 --> 00:04:19,324
<i>to the question.</i>

65
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:20,953
<i>Most of my students</i>

66
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:22,861
<i>will project their own fears
onto it.</i>

67
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,331
- The Russian military.

68
00:04:24,366 --> 00:04:25,993
<i>- I really expect my students
to do more</i>

69
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:28,265
<i>than to come up
with a believable explanation.</i>

70
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:31,364
I want them to put themselves
in the place of those people

71
00:04:31,407 --> 00:04:32,874
so that they can try
to understand

72
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:35,468
why the victims did
what they did.

73
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,537
<i>That is the answer
I'm looking for.</i>

74
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,775
- We're gonna find out
the truth.

75
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:42,249
<i>- Even though
they'll never find it.</i>

76
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,980
- What do you mean?

77
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,215
- There is no truth.

78
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:53,586
- The first leg of our journey
will take us

79
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,995
from Eugene, Oregon,
to Chelyabinsk, Russia.

80
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:58,522
- You're not gonna use that
stupid dotted red line thing

81
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,364
to show us traveling, right?

82
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:03,371
Wrong.

83
00:05:03,405 --> 00:05:06,397
- Our ultimate destination
is the Kholat Syakhl,

84
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:10,674
literally translated
"the Mountain of the Dead,"

85
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:12,806
seriously,

86
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:15,442
a name the Mansi tribe gave it
due to many accounts

87
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:18,078
of mysterious deaths
and disappearances

88
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,610
throughout history.

89
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:25,355
So we found ourselves
an audio engineer, Denise Evers.

90
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,225
- She was the only
audio person on campus

91
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:30,699
that could handle the, uh,
physical requirements.

92
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,497
- A lot of skinny dudes
in audio.

93
00:05:33,535 --> 00:05:36,868
- Hey, what's wrong
with skinny dudes?

94
00:05:36,906 --> 00:05:39,272
Oh.
Uh, sorry, my bad.

95
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:42,072
- And then we found
two capable guides.

96
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,510
- I'm Andy Thatcher,

97
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,945
president of the
Northwest Trail Association.

98
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:48,006
I've climbed just about
every mountain worth climbing

99
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,210
in the U.S.

100
00:05:49,251 --> 00:05:50,240
I've also hiked the A.T.

101
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:51,253
- Sorry, the what?

102
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:53,187
- The Appalachian Trail.
- Okay.

103
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:55,884
- It runs from Maine to Georgia.
It took me all summer.

104
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,859
- So you think
that you can handle this?

105
00:05:57,893 --> 00:05:59,360
- Yeah.

106
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,920
- Okay, what makes you want
to do this, Andy?

107
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,727
- Well, like I said,
I've climbed pretty much

108
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:05,700
just about everything
worth climbing in the U.S.

109
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:06,894
It's time for a new challenge.

110
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:08,426
- Are you scared?

111
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,960
- No.
- Really?

112
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:12,269
It's just that, you know,
we're re-creating a trip

113
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:13,332
in which nine people died.

114
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,842
- Yeah, what,
like, 50 years ago?

115
00:06:14,877 --> 00:06:15,969
I mean, come on.

116
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,205
Even if it was
the Abominable Snowman...

117
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,372
- Yeti!

118
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,608
<i>- He's dead or moved on by now.</i>

119
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:22,014
- And you are?
- He's JP Hauser.

120
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:23,643
JP.
- Got it.

121
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:25,517
- And you think
that you're ready for this?

122
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,317
- Man, he spent a year
hiking in the Himalayas.

123
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:28,414
He's ready.

124
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:29,754
- Really?
- Yeah.

125
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,623
- Yeah, I took
a little time off.

126
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,651
- A lot of time off.
- Cool.

127
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:39,123
Like, Hauser
like Hauser Hall?

128
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:42,228
Like the building that
we're in front of right now?

129
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:44,637
- That's the one.
- Cool.

130
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,106
- That reminds me;
I got to get to Philosophy.

131
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:47,108
I'll catch you kids later.

132
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:49,042
Slam!

133
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:52,673
- Now that we had our crew,
it was time to get busy.

134
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:55,115
We studied our maps
and secured our gear.

135
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,744
We gathered our rations
and supplies.

136
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:00,186
And then we trained
in the local mountains.

137
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:03,055
We were all getting excited
and eager to go.

138
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:06,054
- I hate
these freakin' snowshoes.

139
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:09,656
- But you look so cool in them,
Jensen.

140
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,326
- Hey, I think you guys
are getting the hang of it!

141
00:07:15,838 --> 00:07:18,568
- Almost as much as I hate him.

142
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,306
Shit.

143
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:25,211
- And now it's January 25th.

144
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:28,210
Time to go.

145
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,244
<i>- The search continues today</i>

160
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:29,293
<i>Experts reviewed the footage</i>

162
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,130

163
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:35,227

ConspiraLeaks</i>

164

165
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:39,167
<i>and posted it
on their website.</i>

166
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,676
<i>- I opened the door,
and the darkness swallowed me,</i>

167
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,938
<i>just like in my dreams.</i>

168
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:45,503
<i>- Hey, come on. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.</i>

169
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:46,571
<i>That was a dream.</i>

170
00:10:46,615 --> 00:10:47,741
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

171
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,182
<i>- It was a dream.</i>

172
00:10:49,218 --> 00:10:52,153
<i>- Jensen, we're never gonna
get out of here.</i>

173
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:56,019
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

174
00:11:11,873 --> 00:11:13,500
So we've landed in Russia,

175
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:15,908
and the next leg of our journey
takes us from Chelyabinsk

176
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:19,038
into the Ural Mountains
to a town called Ivdel.

177
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:20,070
- Nice tattoo, angel.

178
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:21,776
Got matching wings
or just the one?

179
00:11:21,817 --> 00:11:24,012
- Just the one,
and it hurt like hell.

180
00:11:24,052 --> 00:11:25,178
- Yeah, I bet.

181
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,312
- Any others
we should know about?

182
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:27,913
Maybe something
you want to show the camera?

183
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:29,150
In your dreams, perv.

184
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,385
Now, tell us about that phone.

185
00:11:30,425 --> 00:11:31,756
- My phone?
Oh, yeah.

186
00:11:31,793 --> 00:11:33,954
It's equipped with a GPS.
Reversal GPS, that is.

187
00:11:33,996 --> 00:11:35,759
And when there's no cell signal,

188
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:39,324
the GPS on here can navigate
for us anywhere in the world.

189
00:11:39,368 --> 00:11:41,063
- Cool.

190
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:43,003
- I've got oil; I can't
get it off with this, baby.

191
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:45,029
You know I didn't bring
any fluid.

192
00:11:45,073 --> 00:11:46,973
Don't do me like this.

193
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,170
- Are you talking
to your camera?

194
00:11:49,211 --> 00:11:51,771
- I'm talking to Lucille.

195
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,178
- You talk to her
like she's a girl?

196
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,207
- Film guys get very attached
to their cameras.

197
00:11:56,251 --> 00:11:59,118
- Don't listen to 'em, baby.
They're just jealous.

198
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,280
- Ah, thank you.

199
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:01,721
- Very attached.

200
00:12:01,757 --> 00:12:04,021
<i>- Spasibo.
- Thank you.</i>

201
00:12:05,327 --> 00:12:07,318
<i>- Spasibo.</i>

202
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:10,525
So what is it about all of that
that makes you guys think,

203
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:12,055
"I just want to strap on
a backpack

204
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,159
and spend a week out there?"

205
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:17,069
- Well, it's a test, you know?

206
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,629
Man against the elements.

207
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:20,335
People survived
for thousands of years

208
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,842
without any
of this kind of stuff.

209
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,071
Still got it in you
to do without?

210
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:24,373
You bet your ass, I do.

211
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,472
You're awfully confident.

212
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:28,710
- Well, you go out into all that
anything less than confident,

213
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,377
you're not coming back.

214
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,080
- Okay.

215
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,850
What about you, JP?

216
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:36,414
- Uh...

217
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:39,120
I just figure we only get
one go-around, you know?

218
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:42,790
I want to try to do and see
as much as possible.

219
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:44,230
And I've got everything I need
in that pack

220
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,358
to survive for months.

221
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,594
- That pack?

222
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,796
- Years, maybe.
Yeah, that pack.

223
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,998
I mean, how many people
can say that?

224
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,405
- I hope that we don't need
to survive for that long.

225
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:55,967
- Well, you never know.

226
00:12:56,011 --> 00:12:58,343
You never know.

227
00:13:12,194 --> 00:13:14,822
- Guys, say hi from Ivdel!

228
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:16,831
<i>- Hola!
- Hi!</i>

229
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:38,418
- We're spending
one night in Ivdel

230
00:13:38,453 --> 00:13:40,421
so we can interview a man
named Piotr Karov.

231
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:43,481
He was actually the tenth member
of the Dyatlov group

232
00:13:43,525 --> 00:13:45,117
but got sick
on the first day out

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,593
and had to turn back.

234
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:49,153
Not long after, he had
some kind of breakdown

235
00:13:49,197 --> 00:13:52,394
and has been in a psychiatric
hospital here ever since.

236
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,733
- Hey, hey.
Don't--hey.

237
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,207
- No!
- Don't touch the camera.

238
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:02,403
- Turn that off!
No recording!

239
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,435
- I just want to get you
saying that on camera.

240
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:05,912
- You must go now, please!

241
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:07,437
- Come on, Ivan!
The Cold War's over.

242
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:08,608
We're friends now.

243
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,515
- Why can't we interview
Piotr Karov?

244
00:14:10,552 --> 00:14:11,985
- He's dead.
- What?

245
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,988
- Now go.
- How did he die?

246
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,614
- Go!

247
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,090
Shit.

248
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,524
- Sure are friendly, huh?
- Yeah.

249
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,152
- Hey, Holly, top window.

250
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:22,026
- What?

251
00:14:22,063 --> 00:14:24,623
Is that him?

252
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:27,066
I don't understand!

253
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:28,569
- Whoa.
Did you see that?

254
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,231
- Was that for us?
What did it say?

255
00:14:31,273 --> 00:14:32,900
- You guys--you guys saw that,
right?

256
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:34,431
- Yeah.
- What the hell?

257
00:14:42,784 --> 00:14:45,082
I know I'm starting
to sound like Jensen,

258
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,485
but I believe
that was Piotr Karov

259
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,250
we saw in that window,
and I really want to know

260
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,951
what was on that note
he showed us.

261
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:52,960
But since we can't see him
and trains don't run here,

262
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:55,656
we're trying to find a ride
to a town called Vizhay,

263
00:14:55,697 --> 00:14:57,164
where we'll begin our hike.

264
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,757
- You know, I'm not sure
we should have sent Jensen

265
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,062
to be our American emissary.

266
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:01,830
That guy could restart
the Cold War.

267
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,431
- Okay, so these guys say
that there is a local bar

268
00:15:05,474 --> 00:15:06,964
just down this way
that we should check out,

269
00:15:07,008 --> 00:15:09,977
because a couple of the locals
might have family in Vizhay,

270
00:15:10,011 --> 00:15:11,308
so we might be able
to hitch a ride.

271
00:15:11,346 --> 00:15:12,472
Sound good?

272
00:15:12,514 --> 00:15:13,879
- Cool.
- Let's go.

273
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:16,679
- A bar sounds good to me.

274
00:15:16,718 --> 00:15:17,707
- You took us the wrong way,
man.

275
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:18,741
- I did not!

276
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,152
This is the way
he said we should go!

277
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:21,815
Oh!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

278
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,121
- Oh, yes, a bar.
- Jensen one, Andy zero.

279
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,683
- Oh, look at that; you can't
take your dogs inside.

280
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,058
Looks like you're
going home alone.

281
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:28,426
- That's hilarious.
- Boomtown!

282
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:29,623
- Hey, Holly, you know why

283
00:15:29,664 --> 00:15:30,926
there's no drunk driving
in Russia?

284
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,160
- No.
- Ta-da!

285
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,326
- Hey, hey,
we should take a picture!

286
00:15:33,368 --> 00:15:34,733
Come on.
- Yeah.

287
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,829
- Yeah, I got a timer
on my camera.

288
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,738
- Only if we can do "thug life"
on three.

289
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:40,866
- If that's so, I insist.

290
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,171
- Let's go.

291
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,177
- Let's do it.

292
00:15:43,211 --> 00:15:44,610
- Okay, one...
- Cheese.

293
00:15:44,646 --> 00:15:45,613
- Two, three.

294
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:46,841
- West Coast, thug life.
- Let's do it.

295
00:15:55,991 --> 00:15:58,323
- Do you speak English?

296
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,123
- Of course.
- Ha!

297
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:02,288
- Something to drink?
- Yes, please.

298
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,264
- Jensen, we're looking
for a ride here.

299
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:07,393
- We are young, attractive
people in a foreign land,

300
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,868
and we would like a drink.

301
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,633
- Where you going?

302
00:16:10,672 --> 00:16:12,037
- Vizhay.

303
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:14,899
- Now, about that drink...

304
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:18,572
- Vizhay?
What for?

305
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,137
- We're making a documentary

306
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:22,649
about the Dyatlov Pass Incident.

307
00:16:22,684 --> 00:16:25,175
- Oh.

308
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,188
Then you must try this.

309
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:28,314
- Oh.
- Oh.

310
00:16:28,356 --> 00:16:30,324
- Oh!
- Whoa, he's got something.

311
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:31,620
- See what you've done now?

312
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,651
- What do we got?
- VIP, gentlemen.

313
00:16:33,695 --> 00:16:34,992
- Oh, come at me, shot.

314
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,997
- It's 'cause you're with me.

315
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,896
- Oh, it's a shot?
Oh, God.

316
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,366
- You're with me,
so you get special treatment.

317
00:16:39,401 --> 00:16:40,629
That's why.

318
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,863
- Can I get a cigarette
with mine?

319
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,495
- Yeah, I think
there's plenty around.

320
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,871
- What do you think, Holly?

321
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:48,739
- The unmarked bottle of doom.

322
00:16:48,777 --> 00:16:50,404
- Dusty bottle.
- The rape bottle.

323
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:53,903
- Yo.
- Shh, shh.

324
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,109
- Oh, my God,
do you smell that?

325
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,617
- Yeah.
- Oh, God, no.

326
00:16:56,651 --> 00:16:58,209
- It stinks.
- It stinks.

327
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:00,448
- Maybe not so full.
- Fill it up.

328
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:03,548
That is big.

329
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:07,720
- Let's do it.

330
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,854
Okay, should I pass 'em around?

331
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:09,864
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

332
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,024
- Oh.
- Oh.

333
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:12,931
- Hello.
- More?

334
00:17:14,536 --> 00:17:16,197
Okay.

335
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:17,932
- Oh, God.
It's gonna be messy.

336
00:17:17,973 --> 00:17:19,270
- It's college all over again.

337
00:17:19,307 --> 00:17:20,501
- It's about to get messy
up in this bitch.

338
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:22,100
- Can we take?
- Please.

339
00:17:22,143 --> 00:17:23,872
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

340
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:26,346
- Come at me, shot.
- Get on me, shot.

341
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:28,645
- To the success of your trip.

342
00:17:28,683 --> 00:17:29,707
- Thank you.

343
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,777
<i>- Um, nostrovia.
- What?</i>

344
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,812
- Well, I may not know anything
about the people or the culture

345
00:17:34,856 --> 00:17:36,983
or the history or the women
of Russia,

346
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:39,687
but I did my homework
on good bar etiquette, so...

347
00:17:39,728 --> 00:17:40,752
- Okay.
- All right.

348
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,456
- Cheers.
- Cheers, guys.

349
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:49,334
Oh, God.

350
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:51,601
- Oh, that's some serious shit.
- It's so good.

351
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,336
- What are you guys, pussies?
- Oh, my God, that burns.

352
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,604
What is that?

353
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:58,135
<i>- Uh, samogon.</i>

354
00:17:58,179 --> 00:17:59,703
<i>Samogon.
- Samogon.</i>

355
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:01,875
- Oh, it's, um--
it's like Russian moonshine.

356
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>- Yeah.
So why serve us samogon?</i>

357
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:07,719
- Uh, they had it right here
before they left.

358
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,553
- Who?
Who had it here?

359
00:18:09,591 --> 00:18:12,822
- Dyatlov--they drank
this before they left.

360
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,260
♪ Dun, dun, dun, dun ♪

361
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:24,669
- Stop it.
It's not funny!

362
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:26,367
- It's not a bad omen at all,
right?

363
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,535
- No, come on.
It's just a coincidence.

364
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,635
- I believe we will take
one more round, my friend.

365
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:32,044
- Yeah.
- Rack 'em up.

366
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,140
- You're making movie?
- That's right.

367
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,674
- And going to Vizhay, yes?

368
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:40,244
- Yeah. Do you know
how we can get there?

369
00:18:40,288 --> 00:18:42,051
- I will take you.

370
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,421
Oh.

371
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,016
- Oh.
- You will? Okay.

372
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,652
- We leave tomorrow.

373
00:18:46,695 --> 00:18:49,960
- Yes, that's great.
Can you take all of us?

374
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,158
- No problem.

375
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,167
- I told you, man,
it'd work out.

376
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:55,931
Okay, can we get, uh,
this guy a drink?

377
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,597
Vodka.

378
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:58,867
Vodka.

379
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:00,374
- Thank you very much.

380
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:04,105
- No problem.
I am Sergei.

381
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:09,415
- See, this isn't so bad.

382
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:12,113
- Who put Jensen in charge
of transportation?

383
00:19:12,153 --> 00:19:13,916
- At least we got
the ladies, bro.

384
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,320
- Keep dreaming.

385
00:19:15,356 --> 00:19:17,551
How far is it to Viz--

386
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,617
- Vizhay?
About 40 miles.

387
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,060
- 40?

388
00:19:21,096 --> 00:19:22,791
Great.

389
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,458
At least we have enough potato

390
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,057
to choke donkey.

391
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:51,358
- Come on, Denise.
Let's go.

392
00:19:51,392 --> 00:19:52,984
- Guys?

393
00:19:53,027 --> 00:19:55,359
My eyelids are frozen shut.

394
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:58,230
- It's not funny!
What do I do?

395
00:19:58,266 --> 00:19:59,255
- Here, hold still.

396
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,495
- Go easy on her, Andy.

397
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:04,566
- Here, hold on.

398
00:20:04,606 --> 00:20:06,870
- Ow!
Shit.

399
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:09,103
- Hold on.
One more.

400
00:20:10,578 --> 00:20:11,909
Here.

401
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:13,311
- Ow!

402
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:15,680
- There you go. There you go.
Better?

403
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,241
- Yeah, thanks.

404
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:18,547
- You okay?

405
00:20:21,156 --> 00:20:23,215
- Whoo!

406
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:26,785
Oh, man.

407
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,295
Cold out here?
It kind of feels--

408
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:30,297
You got a bit of--
your eye--

409
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:31,320
It feels kind of cold.

410
00:20:31,366 --> 00:20:32,856
- All right, let's go!

411
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,459
- Whoa!
- No, man.

412
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,834
- What?
- That's not cool.

413
00:20:36,871 --> 00:20:39,032
- I'll give you 1,000 bucks
if you lick that bumper.

414
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,007
- I'll give you $1
if you blow JP.

415
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,510
- Come on, guys.

416
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:45,308
- Hey, you're gonna love this.

417
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:47,610
Turns out that Sergei
is here to visit his aunt.

418
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,173
- How exciting.

419
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:52,084
- No, she says that she was
part of the first rescue team

420
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,451
at the scene at Dyatlov.

421
00:20:53,488 --> 00:20:54,785
- Wait. Really?

422
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:58,350
- Yes, I can ask if she
speak to you if you want.

423
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:00,657
- Yes, yes.
I want. I want.

424
00:21:00,695 --> 00:21:02,492
- I'll be in movie, right?

425
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,623
- You bet.
She speak English?

426
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:06,429
- Better than me.

427
00:21:06,467 --> 00:21:09,095
- Can you translate
something for me?

428
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,469
Here, take the camera.
- Yeah, sure.

429
00:21:13,374 --> 00:21:15,467
- Let's get inside
and meet his aunt.

430
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,000
- What's her name?

431
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:20,708
- Alya.
She was a schoolteacher.

432
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:24,245
What is it?

433
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:26,276
- The note that Igor held up.

434
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:41,429
- Like this?
- Yeah, I think so.

435
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,369
- What does it mean?

436
00:21:45,473 --> 00:21:47,407
- "Stay away."

437
00:21:50,144 --> 00:21:51,771
- Tell us what happened.

438
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:55,681
- My brother Vallik,
Sergei's father,

439
00:21:55,717 --> 00:21:58,117
found first body.

440
00:21:58,152 --> 00:22:02,179
I still remember
how he was screaming

441
00:22:02,223 --> 00:22:05,021
when he turned her over.

442
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,819
- Go on.

443
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:19,272
- It didn't take long time
to find the others.

444
00:22:22,477 --> 00:22:25,173
A trail.

445
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:27,807
A trail of bodies.

446
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,275
We found two.

447
00:22:32,654 --> 00:22:35,748
And the woman led to big tree

448
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,850
where they had built a fire.

449
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:41,259
There we found two

450
00:22:41,296 --> 00:22:44,788
and four more in the ravine.

451
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:52,228
We were so sad

452
00:22:52,273 --> 00:22:54,798
but not surprised.

453
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:57,504
Then we found

454
00:22:57,545 --> 00:23:00,810
nobody had survived.

455
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:07,083
But this scene
was so strange.

456
00:23:08,456 --> 00:23:14,292
I felt
the people getting nervous.

457
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:16,456
I felt it too.

458
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:21,532
Something was wrong
with that place.

459
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:29,106
I walked away, just wanted
to get away from it.

460
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:34,445
That's when I found two others
on the north side.

461
00:23:35,783 --> 00:23:38,775
There was something wrong
with them,

462
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,654
more wrong than the others,

463
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:47,024
and something in the snow
near them.

464
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,254
A machine.

465
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:56,296
So strange.

466
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:59,829
- Sorry.
Let's--let's cut a minute.

467
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:02,434
So you found 11 bodies.

468
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:04,377
- Yeah.

469
00:24:04,412 --> 00:24:06,312
- You--you're sure?

470
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,780
- I know what I saw,
young lady.

471
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:15,512
I will never forget it.

472
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:19,720
- It's just, the report,
the photos of the scene,

473
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:22,457
everything says
that there were only nine.

474
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:25,557
- The report?

475
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,933
You believe what everyone
tell you to believe?

476
00:24:30,104 --> 00:24:32,971
Or you believe your own eyes?

477
00:24:36,144 --> 00:24:38,271
- I will drop you
at trailhead.

478
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:41,509
- We really can't
thank you enough, Sergei.

479
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,317
- I told you.

480
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:47,412
- What did you tell me?

481
00:24:47,455 --> 00:24:49,980
- Aliens.
What else could this be?

482
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:51,548
- What about the military?

483
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:52,820
You said yourself

484
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,350
they were conducting experiments
back then.

485
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:56,761
- Well, I'm changing my vote
to aliens now.

486
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,063
- Yeah, that makes
way more sense, Jensen.

487
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,566
How about it, Andy?

488
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:05,265
What do you think
of Jensen's alien theory?

489
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,004
Stupid.

490
00:25:08,042 --> 00:25:10,806
- Hmm, he's the strong,
silent type, huh?

491
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:14,781
I don't think Andy agrees
with your theory.

492
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,545
- Whatever.

493
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:19,576
- Do you think you have
enough footage of me?

494
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,019
Get some of the mountains.

495
00:25:21,055 --> 00:25:23,717
- But you're so much
more interesting, JP.

496
00:25:31,632 --> 00:25:35,796
- Hey, Andy, Denise cannot
take her eyes off you.

497
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,771
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

498
00:25:37,805 --> 00:25:40,035
- Oh, Jesus.

499
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,140
You're such an asshole.

500
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:49,412
- So, guys, is it everything
that you hoped?

501
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,610
- Yeah.

502
00:25:50,651 --> 00:25:52,846
- Hell, yeah.

503
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,913
- JP, at a loss for words?

504
00:25:55,957 --> 00:25:57,754
Is that it?

505
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:58,759
- Is that what?

506
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,852
- The Kholat Syakhl.

507
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,123
- Yeah.

508
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,631
- The Mountain of the Dead.

509
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,801
Jesus.

510
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:18,472
- As you can see,
the weather changes quickly.

511
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:20,538
And it has.

512
00:26:22,116 --> 00:26:24,311
- My snowshoe again.

513
00:26:27,822 --> 00:26:29,483
Piece of shit.

514
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:32,289
- I would not want to die here.

515
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,816
- Weather should get better
over the next hill.

516
00:26:33,861 --> 00:26:34,850
- Get some Beefaroni going.

517
00:26:34,896 --> 00:26:35,920
- Jensen!
- Yo!

518
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:36,930
- Just one more shot!

519
00:26:36,964 --> 00:26:37,953
- Come on.

520
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,994
- You guys, this is awesome.

521
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,314
So, Mr. Hauser, tell us
about cooking on the trail.

522
00:26:57,351 --> 00:26:58,648
- Ah.

523
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:02,452
Well, we like to keep it
as simple and light as possible.

524
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,787
Therefore...

525
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,027
I give you...

526
00:27:07,061 --> 00:27:08,460
- ♪ Dun dun dun ♪

527
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:09,827
- Dehydrated mountain chili.

528
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:11,331
It's delicious.

529
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:13,265
- You know
I'm a vegetarian, right?

530
00:27:13,301 --> 00:27:14,495
- Seriously?

531
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,526
- Yeah.

532
00:27:16,571 --> 00:27:18,004
- Well, I don't know.

533
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,870
You're lucky I have
macaroni and cheese, huh?

534
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:21,431
- Thanks.

535
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:23,340
All right.

536
00:27:23,377 --> 00:27:25,277
So all we do
is boil some water.

537
00:27:25,313 --> 00:27:26,837
- You're using snow, though.

538
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:28,712
- Yeah, well, we need
to conserve our fresh water.

539
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:29,841
But don't worry;

540
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:32,250
boiling snow will kill
any bacteria that's in there.

541
00:27:32,286 --> 00:27:33,344
- That smells amazing.

542
00:27:33,387 --> 00:27:35,378
- JP, sir,
you are a king of kings.

543
00:27:35,423 --> 00:27:36,412
- Dude, you might want to wait
so you don't...

544
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:38,616
burn your mouth.

545
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,354
Oh, Jensen!

546
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:42,862
Ouch.
- Idiot.

547
00:27:42,897 --> 00:27:44,262
Why would you give me that

548
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,629
when you knew
how hot it was?

549
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,826
- You're so dumb.

550
00:27:47,935 --> 00:27:49,129
- I still can't taste anything.

551
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,296
- Serves you right.

552
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:51,669
- Got a little surprise
for everybody.

553
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:52,673
- What's up?

554
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:53,833
<i>- Chocolat?</i>

555
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:55,842
I was holding out on you.

556
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:57,104
- Oh, that looks good.

557
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,634
- You've had that
the whole time?

558
00:28:00,615 --> 00:28:03,175
I sleep fine anywhere.

559
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:05,082
- I got a little surprise
for you too, Denise.

560
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,347
- Really?
What's that?

561
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:07,649
- Yeah, I made it earlier

562
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:08,882
when I was chopping up
some wood.

563
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:12,249
- Thank you.

564
00:28:12,293 --> 00:28:14,420
- Nice.
That is not coming in the tent.

565
00:28:14,462 --> 00:28:15,759
- What do I do with it?

566
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,593
- I can show you later
if you want.

567
00:28:17,632 --> 00:28:18,656
- I'm sure you can.

568
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,826
How many nights we got
with these guys?

569
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,460
- Uh, two.

570
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:31,972
Tasty.

571
00:28:32,013 --> 00:28:34,072
- How's everyone's Beefaroni?

572
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:35,946
- It's good.
- Gourmet.

573
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:37,314
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

574
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:38,545
- No?

575
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:43,489
- Oh, Jensen.
Show me your beautiful eyes.

576
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,517
That is sexy.

577
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,027
Is it sexy?

578
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:49,962
- How's your, uh--
how's your first experience

579
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:52,989
on a professional film set
working out?

580
00:28:53,034 --> 00:28:54,626
- Oh, is this
a professional film set?

581
00:28:54,669 --> 00:28:56,330
- This is a profess--
this is best as it gets,

582
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,337
top of the game.

583
00:28:57,371 --> 00:28:58,429
- It's fun, man.

584
00:28:58,472 --> 00:28:59,769
How you holdin' up
with the hike?

585
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:00,865
- Fine.
- Yeah?

586
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:01,897
- Easy.
- Yeah, really?

587
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:03,034
I could do it in my sleep.

588
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:04,738
- Come at me, hike.
- Come at me, hike.

589
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:06,337
Come at me, mountains.

590
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,974
- We were thinking you could
lead the expedition tomorrow.

591
00:29:09,016 --> 00:29:11,883
- I think we're gonna stick
with A-Thatch.

592
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,784
- I think that's probably
pretty smart.

593
00:29:13,821 --> 00:29:16,915
- It's his confidence
that does it for me.

594
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:20,051
- I heard there's a few other
things that do it for you, huh?

595
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:21,391
- Jesus Christ.

596
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:22,987
- I didn't even hear that,
and I'm glad.

597
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,964
- You didn't want to hear it.
- It was hilarious.

598
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:25,966
- Really?

599
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:28,758
Isn't it beautiful?

600
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:30,361
- What?

601
00:29:30,404 --> 00:29:32,838
- The northern lights.

602
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:37,675
- Oh, right.

603
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,340
Yeah, it's very...

604
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,370
lovely.

605
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:44,683
How's your tongue?

606
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,277
- Fine.

607
00:29:49,457 --> 00:29:51,254
- You know,
if you're not interested

608
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:54,784
in the aurora borealis,
Denise's tent is over there.

609
00:29:54,829 --> 00:29:56,091
- Believe it or not,

610
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,463
I'm not actually perving
on Denise right now.

611
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,162
- Okay.
What are you doing?

612
00:30:04,038 --> 00:30:05,938
- In the week leading up
to the incident,

613
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:09,773
there were reports
of orange lights in the sky.

614
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,937
Six totally separate
witnesses.

615
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,503
- Aliens!

616
00:30:13,547 --> 00:30:15,208
- That's what
most people think.

617
00:30:15,249 --> 00:30:17,843
The official response was

618
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,479
"unusual atmospheric
conditions."

619
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:25,015
So, um, moonlight reflecting
off clouds, things like that.

620
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,686
- But you don't believe that.

621
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:28,422
- Hey, you guys should
get some sleep!

622
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:29,622
If we get an early enough
start,

623
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:30,630
we should hit
the site tomorrow.

624
00:30:30,664 --> 00:30:31,790
- 'Kay!

625
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,459
- What?

626
00:30:33,501 --> 00:30:35,196
- Big day.

627
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:38,967
- Yeah, um,
I'm just gonna be a minute.

628
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,633
- Okay.

629
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,170
- What was that?

630
00:30:48,215 --> 00:30:49,182
- What was what?

631
00:30:49,216 --> 00:30:50,615
- That sound.

632
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:53,844
Never mind.

633
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:55,219
- Holly, get up!
- What?

634
00:30:55,256 --> 00:30:56,280
- Something was here!
- I'm coming.

635
00:30:56,323 --> 00:30:57,585
- You got to see this.

636
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:58,956
- It's just Jensen;
he's screwing around.

637
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:01,188
- Holy shit.
- What the hell?

638
00:31:01,228 --> 00:31:02,661
- Okay, we're rolling.
Denise?

639
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:03,788
- I don't like this.

640
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:05,389
- Denise, if anything
was gonna happen,

641
00:31:05,433 --> 00:31:06,491
it would have happened
last night.

642
00:31:06,534 --> 00:31:07,796
- You don't know that.

643
00:31:07,835 --> 00:31:09,063
- I wouldn't put you
in any danger.

644
00:31:09,103 --> 00:31:10,331
I know that it's weird,

645
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:12,100
but that's why we have to get it
on film, okay?

646
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:14,107
- All right, whatever.

647
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,405
- Can you guys wait a sec?

648
00:31:18,145 --> 00:31:19,373
Thanks.

649
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:22,615
You're a dick.

650
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,019
Okay, so we woke up
this morning,

651
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,578
and we found something weird:

652
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:31,113
footprints lurking
between these two rocks

653
00:31:31,158 --> 00:31:32,716
and around the tents.

654
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,022
The shape is weird.

655
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:35,926
See how big that one is?

656
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:39,364
And then the other one
is even bigger.

657
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,493
Two different sets,
two different people.

658
00:31:41,535 --> 00:31:43,230
- Whoa!
People?

659
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,430
- I'm not talking about yetis,
Jensen.

660
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:45,530
- Oh, come on!

661
00:31:45,573 --> 00:31:46,597
Look at the size
of these things.

662
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,766
What else could do that?

663
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:49,537
- I don't know.
A bear, a snow tiger?

664
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,477
- What the--
a snow tiger?

665
00:31:51,512 --> 00:31:53,207
- Snow tigers
are all extinct, genius.

666
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,441
Okay.

667
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:55,540
It gets weirder.

668
00:31:55,583 --> 00:31:57,175
Anyone hiking
in this kind of snow

669
00:31:57,218 --> 00:31:58,845
needs specialized boots.

670
00:31:58,886 --> 00:32:00,217
They need to have
a lot of grip,

671
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,882
so they either have spikes
or very defined grooves.

672
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:04,413
But these are smooth.

673
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,858
Whoever it was,
they were barefoot.

674
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:09,124
Now, Andy tells us that as low
as the temperature gets

675
00:32:09,163 --> 00:32:11,791
at night here, you'd lose
your toes in ten minutes.

676
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:12,821
- Which would explain a yeti.

677
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:13,856
- It's not a freaking yeti!

678
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:15,027
- How do you know?

679
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:16,195
- 'Cause yetis
don't freaking exist!

680
00:32:16,237 --> 00:32:18,000
- You don't exist!
- For God's sake, Jensen!

681
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,835
- Okay, we're rolling.

682
00:32:19,874 --> 00:32:23,366
- None of the footprints
lead into or out of the camp.

683
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,605
It's like something dropped
out of the sky,

684
00:32:25,646 --> 00:32:27,910
walked around in barefoot
while we were sleeping,

685
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:29,973
and then took off again.

686
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,348
Do yetis fly too?

687
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:32,374
- They might.

688
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,046
- Hey.
Can we pack up now, please?

689
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,453
- Andy, are there really
snow tigers here?

690
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:36,956
- No, there's no
freakin' tigers here.

691
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:38,959
Come on.

692
00:32:38,993 --> 00:32:42,326
- We don't have to cross that,
do we?

693
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:43,830
- No.

694
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:45,422
- You guys all right?
You've been quiet all morning.

695
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:47,491
- Yeah, we're fine.

696
00:32:47,535 --> 00:32:49,059
- You don't seem fine.

697
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,264
- We just don't like
being messed with is all.

698
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,273
- Do you think
that we're messing with you?

699
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,400
- No, we think Bigfoot was
checking out our campsite

700
00:32:55,442 --> 00:32:56,602
last night.

701
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:58,236
- How could we possibly
fake that?

702
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,644
- Oh, you're right, Holly.

703
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,705
No one's ever faked
footprints in the snow before.

704
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,910
Freakin' amateur, man.

705
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:06,385
- He's right, Holls.

706
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,149
It's cool to cut loose
and have some fun,

707
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,655
but look around you.

708
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,782
This is the last place
in the world

709
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,223
you want to have
everyone freaked out.

710
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:14,489
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

711
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:18,991
So needless to say,

712
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,263
we're all a little on edge
this morning.

713
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:36,811
- Holly!
Do you hear that?

714
00:33:39,153 --> 00:33:40,381
- So we're searching

715
00:33:40,421 --> 00:33:43,322
where we think those
strange sounds came from.

716
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:44,619
We've listened to the tape,

717
00:33:44,658 --> 00:33:47,058
and no one can even begin
to explain what it is.

718
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:49,654
And then we found these,

719
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:51,756
just like at the campsite.

720
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:53,528
No tracks in or out.

721
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:55,296
We're getting
a little freaked out.

722
00:33:55,336 --> 00:33:57,361
- Holly!
Come look at this!

723
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:59,099
More footprints!

724
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,003
- What is it?

725
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,772
- It's a weather tower.

726
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,643
They put them
in remote areas like this.

727
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,978
That propeller at the top
measures wind speed.

728
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:10,677
- Well, not anymore, it doesn't.

729
00:34:17,992 --> 00:34:19,653
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

730
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,320
- Look at the footprints.

731
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,455
Whatever made that sound
was here,

732
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:25,089
and I want to know why.

733
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,529
- Well?

734
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,937
- Hang on.
What the--

735
00:34:36,043 --> 00:34:37,738
- Are you okay?
- You all right?

736
00:34:37,778 --> 00:34:39,245
- Yeah.

737
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:41,270
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

738
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:44,876
- Holly, wait.
A tongue?

739
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,012
This isn't safe, Holly.

740
00:34:48,055 --> 00:34:49,647
- Yeah, that's
what it looked like.

741
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,714
- It's not nothing.
It's a tongue.

742
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:53,124
We should just leave right now!

743
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,388
- Denise, can you just--

744
00:34:54,428 --> 00:34:55,395
- What about the footprints?

745
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,862
- It's probably
from an animal.

746
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:58,296
Please, can you just
give us a minute?

747
00:34:58,332 --> 00:34:59,799
- Hey, hey, hey,
come on.

748
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,095
Look, she's just
messing around with us

749
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:02,124
for her stupid movie.

750
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:03,568
Come on.

751
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:05,435
Okay?
- Yeah.

752
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:09,570
- Are you okay?

753
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,009
- Yeah, yeah.

754
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:13,445
I'm just a bit freaked out.
That's all.

755
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,607
- Well, you know, everyone's
a little rattled, but--

756
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,345
- I heard about
this mountain pass in China

757
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:21,479
where birds fly into walls

758
00:35:21,522 --> 00:35:25,982
and people and animals
go crazy and die.

759
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:28,654
And it's all because
the wind generates

760
00:35:28,696 --> 00:35:33,395
a four-megahertz sound
that makes people go insane.

761
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:34,662
Do you think that--

762
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,033
- That the wind
is making us crazy?

763
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,231
No, Jensen,
we all saw the tape

764
00:35:38,272 --> 00:35:41,207
and heard whatever it was.

765
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:43,436
Please, tell me what's wrong.

766
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:47,610
- I've heard them before.

767
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,343
- Jesus, Jensen.

768
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,920
- I had a, um--

769
00:35:57,424 --> 00:36:00,018
I had a really bad trip
when I was in high school.

770
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,652
- Like, on acid?

771
00:36:01,695 --> 00:36:03,754
Okay, I've never done it.

772
00:36:03,797 --> 00:36:06,823
- It's, uh--it's fun at first.

773
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:10,997
It's kind of like, um,
all your brain cells are firing

774
00:36:11,038 --> 00:36:14,838
at the same time
for the first time in your life.

775
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,002
Then it got a little weird,

776
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,912
and I heard them.

777
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:25,112
And they were chasing me,
and I was just running.

778
00:36:25,152 --> 00:36:27,620
And the next thing
I remember, um,

779
00:36:27,654 --> 00:36:28,712
the cops were picking me up

780
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:30,223
and I was in the middle
of the street,

781
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:32,987
screaming about demons.

782
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,728
And...

783
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:38,323
now I'm out here with you,

784
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:39,855
and here they are.

785
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,299
- Okay, sweetie.

786
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:44,031
When I was a kid, yeah,
I used to have this dream

787
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,060
about this place.

788
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:46,629
It was exactly the same--

789
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:49,437
the mountains,
the snow, everything.

790
00:36:49,476 --> 00:36:52,968
And it was like there was this
magnet pulling me toward it.

791
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:55,914
And, you know, I'd get out here,
and then there's this door.

792
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,473
A door.

793
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:00,715
And I don't want to open it,
but I have to.

794
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:01,948
And then, like,
on the other side,

795
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:04,423
there's just this darkness,
like blackness,

796
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:06,221
and it swallows me up.

797
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,888
And I used to wake up, like,
absolutely screaming,

798
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:12,194
and my parents said that I was
having, um, those night terrors.

799
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:14,393
And they took me to a shrink,
and he put me on pills,

800
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,265
and nothing worked, okay?

801
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:19,170
And then I saw that news report
about the scientists,

802
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:21,697
and I just knew.

803
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:23,471
I said, "That's it.
Oh, my God.

804
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,774
That's the place
that I've been dreaming about."

805
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:28,475
And this is how I know
that we are all gonna do

806
00:37:28,515 --> 00:37:30,244
what nobody else
has been able to do

807
00:37:30,284 --> 00:37:31,342
and we are gonna figure out

808
00:37:31,385 --> 00:37:33,376
what happened to those people,
okay?

809
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,411
You were just meant
to be here too.

810
00:37:35,455 --> 00:37:37,889
Uh-huh?
So how's that for crazy?

811
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:40,052
- You've been hanging out
with me for too long, man.

812
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:41,458
You're supposed to be
our Velma.

813
00:37:41,495 --> 00:37:43,292
- What's that?

814
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,592
<i>- Scooby-Doo.</i>

815
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:45,859
- The dog?

816
00:37:45,899 --> 00:37:47,958
- Yeah--
No, no, Velma.

817
00:37:48,001 --> 00:37:48,968
You know, she's--

818
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:50,230
In the gang, she's, like,

819
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,567
the smart, the intelligent one,
with short hair and--

820
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:52,833
- Thank you.

821
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:54,238
- She says, "Jinkies."
- I've never seen it.

822
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,400
- Okay, whatever.

823
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:56,670
- Hey, unless you guys
want to camp here,

824
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,904
we should get going.

825
00:37:57,945 --> 00:38:01,437
- I definitely don't want
to camp here, okay?

826
00:38:01,481 --> 00:38:03,381
Okay.

827
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,588
This mountain
really is amazing.

828
00:38:10,624 --> 00:38:12,251
- Did I already mention

829
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:14,419
how much I hate
these freakin' snowshoes?

830
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,826
Anybody?

831
00:38:15,863 --> 00:38:16,887
Nobody?

832
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,369
- Guys, wait!

833
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,808
- Come on, slowpoke.

834
00:38:30,844 --> 00:38:33,779
- Guys, wait!
This is it! We're here!

835
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:37,045
- A break.
Oh, thank God.

836
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,847
- Are you sure?

837
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:41,013
- I've seen the pictures
a hundred times.

838
00:38:41,054 --> 00:38:44,148
This is it.
This is where it happened.

839
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:46,682
This is Dyatlov's Pass.

840
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:49,957
- Can you pass
the other one over?

841
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:50,986
- Yeah.

842
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:54,158
- 53 years ago today,

843
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:57,227
nine people set up camp
on this very ground,

844
00:38:57,271 --> 00:38:59,535
ate dinner, and went to bed.

845
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:03,566
At some point between 9:00
and 11:00 that night,

846
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:06,602
something that Russian officials
could only identify

847
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:08,706
as "an unknown compelling force"

848
00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:11,149
caused all nine of them
to flee from their tent

849
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:12,481
in such terror

850
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,113
that they ripped through it
and fled into the night.

851
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:18,249
It was 17 degrees below zero.

852
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:19,953
- You're gonna love
this footage, Andy.

853
00:39:19,993 --> 00:39:21,517
You look like a TV chef.

854
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:23,358
- Oh, yeah?
Which one?

855
00:39:23,397 --> 00:39:24,625
- The gay one.

856
00:39:24,665 --> 00:39:26,257
That's harsh.

857
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,325
- That's real cute, Jensen.

858
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,537
- Rustem Slobotkin, 23,

859
00:39:35,575 --> 00:39:37,372
the first of them to fall.

860
00:39:37,411 --> 00:39:39,811
Igor Dyatlov, 23,

861
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:43,009
the group's leader
and the most experienced hiker.

862
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,883
It was probably his idea
to try for the tents.

863
00:39:45,919 --> 00:39:48,683
Zinaida Kolmogorova, 22.

864
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:51,691
She was just a year older
than I am now.

865
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:54,125
She got the closest to the camp
before succumbing.

866
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,891
The only victim showing
any sign of a struggle,

867
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:58,454
she was missing her tongue

868
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:01,399
and a large portion
of her oral cavity.

869
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:05,132
Lyudmila Dublinina, 21.

870
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:08,573
Nicholas Thibeaux-Brignollel.

871
00:40:08,608 --> 00:40:11,475
Alexander Zolotarev.

872
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:14,275
Alexander Kolevatov.

873
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:17,549
The cause of death
for all the victims

874
00:40:17,584 --> 00:40:20,052
was determined
to be hypothermia.

875
00:40:20,087 --> 00:40:24,490
But Rustem and Nicholas also
had severely crushed skulls,

876
00:40:24,524 --> 00:40:27,391
and Lyudmila
and Alexander Zolotarev

877
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,089
had a number of broken ribs.

878
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,224
But none of the bodies
had any defensive injuries,

879
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:36,099
no external injuries whatsoever.

880
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:40,072
Somehow something managed
to crush the skulls of two men

881
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:43,304
and shatter the ribs
of Lyudmila and Alexander

882
00:40:43,343 --> 00:40:45,971
without leaving
so much as a bruise.

883
00:40:47,381 --> 00:40:49,941
Also, Alexander's body
tested positive

884
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:52,076
for high levels of radiation.

885
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,380
Hello!

886
00:40:57,424 --> 00:40:58,652
Where out here

887
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:01,661
did Alexander encounter
so much radiation?

888
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:03,492
And why only him?

889
00:41:04,498 --> 00:41:08,195
Georgyl Krivonischenko, 24.

890
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:11,864
Yuri Doroshenko, 21.

891
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:13,770
While the others ran,

892
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:16,537
they sat quietly
by their dying fire

893
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,703
and calmly froze to death.

894
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:29,378
What's up, Andy?

895
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:30,720
- Nothing.

896
00:41:30,757 --> 00:41:32,918
- Doesn't look like nothing.

897
00:41:32,959 --> 00:41:34,927
- The GPS is all screwed up.

898
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:36,895
It should have alerted us
when we got to site.

899
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,125
We're lucky you spotted it.

900
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:42,363
- And I supposed you think
that that's my fault too.

901
00:41:42,402 --> 00:41:43,596
- I don't know.
Did you screw with it?

902
00:41:43,637 --> 00:41:45,070
- No!

903
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,834
- Well, if she did, she managed
to get ahold of my watch too.

904
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:48,340
My altimeter is toast.

905
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:52,038
And look at this.
That compass is a Suunto.

906
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:53,273
It got me through the Himalayas,

907
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,440
and it's always worked perfectly
everywhere but here.

908
00:41:57,551 --> 00:42:00,384
- I think we should go.

909
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,648
- What?
We just got here.

910
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:03,212
- Look, we don't have
to go back yet,

911
00:42:03,256 --> 00:42:06,020
but we're flying blind
without a GPS or a reliable map.

912
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:07,321
- Well, what's wrong
with the map?

913
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,453
- We shouldn't be here yet.

914
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:13,023
- What do you mean?

915
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:16,331
- According to the map,
we've covered 14 miles today.

916
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:19,065
There's no way we could have
gotten here before midnight.

917
00:42:19,106 --> 00:42:21,131
- So what?
So we were fast.

918
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:23,039
- Look, let's just pack up
and keep moving

919
00:42:23,076 --> 00:42:24,600
until the compass
stops acting up.

920
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:27,112
There's obviously some kind of--
I don't know--magnetic field

921
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:28,614
in the rock here or something.

922
00:42:28,648 --> 00:42:29,979
We can start up
somewhere new,

923
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:31,506
and nobody'd be able
to tell the difference.

924
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,610
- It won't match the footage
that we shot before, though.

925
00:42:33,653 --> 00:42:35,245
- Screw the footage, Holly.

926
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:37,415
Something obviously is wrong.
We should just leave.

927
00:42:37,457 --> 00:42:39,186
If we start packing now,
we can make it.

928
00:42:39,226 --> 00:42:40,318
- No, no. No, no, no, no.

929
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,884
I don't want
to camp here either,

930
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:43,486
but by the time we get packed up
and get moving,

931
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,997
we're gonna be hiking
in the dark.

932
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:46,965
It's no good.

933
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,797
- Guys, it's for one night.

934
00:42:48,835 --> 00:42:51,099
You know, people lived
for thousands of years

935
00:42:51,138 --> 00:42:53,698
without watches and GPS.

936
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,265
I think that we could make
one night.

937
00:42:56,309 --> 00:42:58,903
It's what we all came here for.

938
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:02,314
- All right.
All right, I'll start dinner.

939
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:03,441
- Thank you.

940
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,190
Hey.

941
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:17,787
I'm ruining date night
over there.

942
00:43:17,831 --> 00:43:20,129
Starting to feel like
a third wheel.

943
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:22,158
- I just don't understand what
she sees in somebody like him.

944
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:23,430
I mean, he's just such
an arrogant...

945
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,596
- Confident.
- Self-important...

946
00:43:24,638 --> 00:43:25,605
- Rugged.
- Douche bag.

947
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:26,833
- Stud.

948
00:43:26,873 --> 00:43:27,999
- Yeah, you know, there is room
in that tent, I'm sure,

949
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,668
if you want to go and join them.

950
00:43:29,709 --> 00:43:30,971
- Aw.

951
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:32,171
Maybe for you too.

952
00:43:32,212 --> 00:43:35,477
I'm sure you'll have a boyfriend
as nice as Andy one day, so...

953
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:37,774
What are you doing?

954
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:39,876
- Nothing.
I'm just gonna...

955
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,683
- Oh, shit.

956
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:45,055
Thank you.

957
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:46,285
Thank you.

958
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:48,487
This is one of the reasons
that you can't meet anyone.

959
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:49,859
- No, I can't meet anybody

960
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:51,158
because everybody thinks
I'm dating you.

961
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:52,495
- Oh, you wish.

962
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:56,160
- Um...

963
00:43:56,203 --> 00:44:00,299
look, I was thinking
about what Ranger Rick said

964
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,205
about this being
a magnetic field.

965
00:44:02,242 --> 00:44:04,039
- Yeah?

966
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,669
- What if it's not?

967
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:10,843
Okay.

968
00:44:10,884 --> 00:44:13,648
Why don't you tell the folks
at home what you got there?

969
00:44:13,687 --> 00:44:16,781
- So this is a fairly basic
Geiger counter.

970
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:18,950
Um, without getting
too complicated,

971
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,324
it detects levels of radiation.

972
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,926
As you can hear,

973
00:44:28,969 --> 00:44:32,336
there is definitely radiation
in this area.

974
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:35,933
- It could be, uh,
uranium in the rock here.

975
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,211
- It's nothing dangerous,

976
00:44:40,247 --> 00:44:43,876
but it's--it's way more
than we should be seeing.

977
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:45,179
Yeah.

978
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:49,120
And the source of it
is definitely coming from here.

979
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,417
- Let's check it out.

980
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:00,861
- Over this way.

981
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,299
- Watch your step.

982
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,098
Oh.
- Yeah.

983
00:45:04,137 --> 00:45:05,900
- Lucille does not like this.

984
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:07,930
- I think
that we found something.

985
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:12,276
Hey, Jensen.

986
00:45:12,312 --> 00:45:14,337
See how the ice
is thinner there?

987
00:45:14,381 --> 00:45:16,941
- Yeah.
- The snow.

988
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:18,678
- Yeah?
What about it?

989
00:45:18,718 --> 00:45:21,744
- It looks like
someone's been here.

990
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:24,621
Maybe, like, even
in the last few days.

991
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:26,125
- Be careful.

992
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:28,389
- Okay.

993
00:45:28,428 --> 00:45:30,055
Here, right up here.

994
00:45:38,305 --> 00:45:41,206
- Holly, be careful.
- Okay.

995
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,435
Wait.

996
00:45:45,145 --> 00:45:47,545
Jensen, I don't think
that this is a rock.

997
00:45:52,218 --> 00:45:54,379
Oh, shit.
Are you getting this?

998
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,479
- I'm getting it.
I'm getting it.

999
00:45:55,522 --> 00:45:58,355
Jensen, this--

1000
00:45:58,391 --> 00:45:59,824
Shit.
- Be careful.

1001
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,326
- Can you see this?
- Yes.

1002
00:46:04,364 --> 00:46:06,298
Keep going.
Keep going.

1003
00:46:06,333 --> 00:46:07,425
Come on.

1004
00:46:11,171 --> 00:46:12,229
What is that?

1005
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:13,534
- I don't know.
It's--

1006
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:14,562
- Oh, my God.

1007
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:17,371
- Oh, Jensen.
Do you see that?

1008
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:18,900
- Tell the camera what you see.
- Oh, Jensen!

1009
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:20,071
- What do you see?
Come on!

1010
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:23,014
- It's like a cave
or something.

1011
00:46:23,049 --> 00:46:24,448
Oh, my God, Jensen, it's--

1012
00:46:24,484 --> 00:46:27,544
You got to put the camera down
and come help me.

1013
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:28,884
There's a door.

1014
00:46:28,922 --> 00:46:31,186
- What?

1015
00:46:31,224 --> 00:46:32,714
- Put the camera down.

1016
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:34,488
- Got to get this on film.

1017
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:38,721
This is so weird.

1018
00:46:38,765 --> 00:46:41,563
- Of course it's weird, Jensen.
Look.

1019
00:46:41,601 --> 00:46:43,762
It's a door
in the middle of a mountain.

1020
00:46:43,803 --> 00:46:46,465
- It locks from the outside.

1021
00:46:49,242 --> 00:46:51,676
It's designed
to keep something in.

1022
00:46:53,446 --> 00:46:54,743
- Yeah, but what?

1023
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:55,907
- Holly!

1024
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,678
Look, man, come on!

1025
00:46:57,717 --> 00:46:59,548
The Russian government has
spent a lot of time and effort

1026
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:02,054
building a big, solid door
in the side of a mountain

1027
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:03,282
to keep whatever's inside
in there.

1028
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:04,312
I don't think we should be--

1029
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:06,450
- Jensen, what the hell
are we here for?

1030
00:47:06,493 --> 00:47:10,054
Do you want to know if the
"unknown compelling force"

1031
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:13,065
is a yeti or an alien or a...

1032
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,829
Soviet-engineered superman?

1033
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:17,268
I want to know
what happened here,

1034
00:47:17,303 --> 00:47:19,430
and the answer
is behind that door!

1035
00:47:19,472 --> 00:47:22,737
So would you just help me
open it, please?

1036
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:26,106
Okay?

1037
00:47:33,253 --> 00:47:34,515
- Wait.

1038
00:47:39,092 --> 00:47:40,491
- It's moving.

1039
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:44,558
- It's already open.

1040
00:47:44,597 --> 00:47:47,930
It's--it's frozen shut
at the seams.

1041
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,628
- Well, that's good.

1042
00:47:49,669 --> 00:47:51,000
That means that we can--
we can get it open.

1043
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:52,061
We just need to melt the ice.

1044
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:53,231
- Let me get the guys.

1045
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:54,365
We'll get some hot water,
and we can--

1046
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:55,374
- No, no, no, not them.
- What?

1047
00:47:55,408 --> 00:47:58,844
- Jesus.
Uh, no, because...

1048
00:47:58,878 --> 00:48:00,209
- What?

1049
00:48:00,246 --> 00:48:02,077
- They're already
really jumpy, okay?

1050
00:48:02,115 --> 00:48:04,310
And this is just gonna
freak them out, and...

1051
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:05,339
I just--

1052
00:48:05,385 --> 00:48:06,613
I don't want to move camp, okay?

1053
00:48:06,653 --> 00:48:09,121
So we'll tell them about it
tomorrow.

1054
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:12,420
We'll just leave it now,
and then we'll come back, okay?

1055
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:32,611
Hey, guys.
What's up?

1056
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:33,942
- Want to go to bed?

1057
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,538
- Yeah, sure.

1058
00:48:35,582 --> 00:48:37,277
- Good night.

1059
00:48:37,317 --> 00:48:38,579
- All right.

1060
00:48:38,618 --> 00:48:39,676
- Night, Holly.
- Good night.

1061
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:40,686
- You guys have a good one.

1062
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,812
- Night, guys.

1063
00:48:45,024 --> 00:48:46,286
- What are you reading?

1064
00:48:48,995 --> 00:48:51,486
<i>Slaughterhouse Five.</i>

1065
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:53,158
- You don't like Vonnegut?

1066
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,325
- No, I love that book.

1067
00:48:54,367 --> 00:48:56,426
I was just thinking about it
yesterday.

1068
00:48:56,469 --> 00:48:58,960
- It's good.
- Very impressive.

1069
00:48:59,005 --> 00:49:00,666
- Have a seat, Professor.

1070
00:49:00,707 --> 00:49:02,504
- Thanks.

1071
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:04,567
Just let me put this down.

1072
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:13,752
You know...

1073
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:16,619
it's impossible to get warm

1074
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:19,591
when you're sitting on snow
all the time.

1075
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:21,321
- Yeah, I think my ass
has been numb

1076
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:23,022
since we left Vizhay.

1077
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:28,030
So did you guys find anything
with the Geiger counter?

1078
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:29,364
- No, perfectly safe.

1079
00:49:29,402 --> 00:49:31,336
- Well, that's good,
I guess.

1080
00:49:31,371 --> 00:49:33,168
I mean, I know you were hoping

1081
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:35,003
to find something
for your movie.

1082
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,770
- There's still time.

1083
00:49:41,581 --> 00:49:43,879
Young love.

1084
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:46,678
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

1085
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:49,153
Um, Thatch is a good dude,

1086
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:52,885
but I'm not sure
he's boyfriend material.

1087
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:55,724
- Really?
I think they look cute.

1088
00:49:55,762 --> 00:49:58,697
- It's because he's a master
of the trail hookup.

1089
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:00,528
- The trail hookup?

1090
00:50:00,567 --> 00:50:01,693
Yeah.

1091
00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:04,430
There it is.
Oh, man.

1092
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:05,835
Uh, the trail hookup.

1093
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:07,430
You get a girl
out in the middle of nowhere,

1094
00:50:07,473 --> 00:50:09,236
especially where it's cold.

1095
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,108
She needs someone
to snuggle up with...

1096
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:14,875
- How romantic.
Oh, God.

1097
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:16,245
- That's not the worst of it.

1098
00:50:16,282 --> 00:50:17,647
- He has herpes?

1099
00:50:19,419 --> 00:50:20,613
No, not that I know of.

1100
00:50:20,653 --> 00:50:23,349
Uh, you know that camera
on his phone?

1101
00:50:23,389 --> 00:50:25,550
- Oh, no.
He records it?

1102
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:28,288
- It's not just
for shooting landscapes, yeah.

1103
00:50:28,328 --> 00:50:30,057
It's like a digital notch
in the bedpost.

1104
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:31,688
- No, Denise!

1105
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:33,221
- Oh, she's going down.

1106
00:50:35,401 --> 00:50:37,392
So where's your trail game?

1107
00:50:39,472 --> 00:50:41,337
- Oh.

1108
00:50:41,374 --> 00:50:43,842
I'd like to introduce you
to my young friend

1109
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:45,343
Colonel Whiskey.

1110
00:50:45,378 --> 00:50:46,538
- Hello, Colonel.

1111
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:48,308
- Yes, please.

1112
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:52,876
- John Patrick Hauser,
are you trying to get me drunk?

1113
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,284
- Well, it's either that

1114
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,652
or wait for a little
paradoxical undressing.

1115
00:50:58,324 --> 00:50:59,882
I'll take a little bit of that.

1116
00:50:59,926 --> 00:51:01,086
- Nice.

1117
00:51:01,127 --> 00:51:02,116
- Hey.

1118
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:04,823
- Hey.
- Hey.

1119
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:06,126
- You believe those two?

1120
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:09,225
- Don't worry;
it's just a trail hookup.

1121
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:10,599
- What's a trail hookup?

1122
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:12,400
- You're still in the running,
Casanova.

1123
00:51:12,438 --> 00:51:16,602
- I'm not sure if I want
that guy's sloppy seconds.

1124
00:51:16,643 --> 00:51:20,739
- Well, you could always
curl up with Lucille, right?

1125
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,271
- Hey, man, you laugh, but...

1126
00:51:23,316 --> 00:51:26,114
if it was legal in the state
of Oregon to marry a camera,

1127
00:51:26,152 --> 00:51:27,915
then I would do it.

1128
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:30,149
But unfortunately it's not,

1129
00:51:30,189 --> 00:51:33,522
so we're gonna have to keep
our relationship professional.

1130
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:34,958
Mostly.

1131
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:52,942
Well, I am going to...

1132
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,378
go to sleep.

1133
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:55,642
- Right on.

1134
00:51:58,785 --> 00:52:00,446
- Good night.
- Good night.

1135
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:01,817
- Sweet dreams.

1136
00:52:10,263 --> 00:52:12,891
Look, I'm sorry we accused you
of faking those footprints.

1137
00:52:12,932 --> 00:52:14,024
- It's all right.

1138
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:15,659
If I didn't know
that I didn't do it,

1139
00:52:15,702 --> 00:52:17,795
I would have thought
exactly the same thing.

1140
00:52:17,837 --> 00:52:19,532
- No, we jumped
to a conclusion

1141
00:52:19,572 --> 00:52:21,267
that we shouldn't have.

1142
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:22,797
I expect that of Slap-Nuts
over there,

1143
00:52:22,842 --> 00:52:26,744
but I know better.

1144
00:52:26,779 --> 00:52:28,838
- Well, if you want
to make it up to me,

1145
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:32,874
you could give me something warm
to snuggle up with.

1146
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:37,987
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1147
00:52:38,024 --> 00:52:39,992
- Um, yes.

1148
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,160
- It's, uh, 6:00 a.m.

1149
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,931
That makes it the third day
of the trip.

1150
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,531
And it's time to meet Denise.

1151
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:12,415
- What are you doing?

1152
00:53:12,458 --> 00:53:14,085
- Huh?

1153
00:53:14,127 --> 00:53:15,355
Making a little home movie.

1154
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:17,123
- You're ready again?

1155
00:53:17,163 --> 00:53:18,994
- Don't look so surprised.

1156
00:53:19,031 --> 00:53:21,363
- I'm not surprised.
I'm impressed.

1157
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,459
- Impressed?
- Mm-hmm.

1158
00:53:25,404 --> 00:53:26,837
Oh, no, no.
Turn that off.

1159
00:53:26,873 --> 00:53:27,862
- What?

1160
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:29,374
- Turn it off.
- Come on.

1161
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:31,342
Don't act like you haven't
had sex on camera before.

1162
00:53:31,377 --> 00:53:32,674
- Andy.

1163
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:34,009
- Well, what better way
to remember

1164
00:53:34,046 --> 00:53:35,013
the best part of the trip,
huh?

1165
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:36,639
- Oh, the dinner we had
in Ivdel?

1166
00:53:36,682 --> 00:53:38,013
- You mean getting fucked
in Ivdel?

1167
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,244
- Andy.

1168
00:53:48,261 --> 00:53:51,458
Shit.
Andy, what the hell was that?

1169
00:53:51,497 --> 00:53:53,055
What was that?
- You heard that, right?

1170
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:54,930
- Yeah, fuck.
Shit.

1171
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:57,800
- Uh, guys?
- Here.

1172
00:53:57,837 --> 00:53:59,270
- Everybody okay?

1173
00:53:59,305 --> 00:54:01,535
- What was that?

1174
00:54:02,608 --> 00:54:04,132
- What the hell is that?

1175
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:05,576
- Shit.

1176
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:07,272
- Denise, grab your equipment!

1177
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:08,280
- Guys!

1178
00:54:08,314 --> 00:54:09,975
- Denise, get out!

1179
00:54:10,016 --> 00:54:11,244
- Avalanche!

1180
00:54:11,284 --> 00:54:12,273
- Oh, my God!

1181
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,817
- Come on!
Let's go!

1182
00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:17,379
- Come on, Denise!

1183
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:19,152
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

1184
00:54:19,192 --> 00:54:21,126
- Andy!
- Go!

1185
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,151
- Andy!
- Denise, no!

1186
00:54:23,196 --> 00:54:24,561
Get up, Denise!

1187
00:54:31,237 --> 00:54:32,727
- Denise!

1188
00:54:39,812 --> 00:54:41,211
- Oh, God, it's Andy!

1189
00:54:43,983 --> 00:54:45,644
- Oh, shit.

1190
00:54:45,685 --> 00:54:47,118
- Let's get him out of here.

1191
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,182
Oh, God, get under his head.

1192
00:54:54,227 --> 00:54:56,559
- Okay.
Come on.

1193
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:02,030
- Denise!
- Denise!

1194
00:55:02,068 --> 00:55:04,229
- Denise!

1195
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,170
- She's gone!

1196
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:07,536
- Denise!
She's gone!

1197
00:55:07,573 --> 00:55:08,631
- No way, man.

1198
00:55:08,674 --> 00:55:10,699
She could still be breathing
somewhere.

1199
00:55:10,743 --> 00:55:13,177
- She's gone!

1200
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:15,180
- Settle down.
- She's gone!

1201
00:55:23,322 --> 00:55:25,756
- You left her!

1202
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:26,815
You left her!

1203
00:55:26,859 --> 00:55:28,986
- Screw you!

1204
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,695
- She was just another
trail hookup to you, wasn't she?

1205
00:55:32,732 --> 00:55:34,324
- I said shut up right now!

1206
00:55:34,367 --> 00:55:35,595
He's right!

1207
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:37,432
There's nothing we can do
for her!

1208
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,869
- They goddamn killed her!

1209
00:55:38,905 --> 00:55:39,963
- It was an avalanche!

1210
00:55:40,006 --> 00:55:40,973
- Oh, wake up, man!

1211
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:42,372
They tried to kill us.

1212
00:55:42,408 --> 00:55:44,308
They tried to bury us so it
would look like an accident!

1213
00:55:44,343 --> 00:55:45,708
- You crazy bastard!

1214
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:47,542
Shit like that doesn't happen
in the real world, okay?

1215
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,447
- Are you telling me you didn't
see those charges, huh?

1216
00:55:50,483 --> 00:55:53,111
Or was that a herd of Ukrainian
exploding mountain goats?

1217
00:55:53,152 --> 00:55:54,881
- You don't know what happened!

1218
00:55:54,921 --> 00:55:56,252
How would anyone find us
out here?

1219
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:57,950
Look around, you joker!
- Okay, stop!

1220
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:02,086
I had to apply for permits
and submit travel plans!

1221
00:56:02,128 --> 00:56:04,358
JP, they knew exactly
where we were

1222
00:56:04,397 --> 00:56:05,625
and when we'd be there.

1223
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:06,927
They waited
until we were asleep.

1224
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:08,263
Jensen is right!

1225
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:09,563
Somebody is trying to kill us!

1226
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:11,695
- Jesus, Holly, you too?
- Oh, God.

1227
00:56:11,737 --> 00:56:13,568
- Okay.
Tell me, who is it?

1228
00:56:13,606 --> 00:56:15,733
- The military, man!

1229
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:17,868
This is serious, grade-A...

1230
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,775
Shut up!

1231
00:56:19,812 --> 00:56:21,803
Both of you, shut up, okay?

1232
00:56:21,847 --> 00:56:24,247
I don't want to believe
that Denise is gone,

1233
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:25,580
but she is, okay?

1234
00:56:25,618 --> 00:56:27,518
And now we have to pull together

1235
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:30,113
and focus
on not losing anybody else.

1236
00:56:30,156 --> 00:56:32,181
Andy, what--what do we do?
What--

1237
00:56:32,224 --> 00:56:34,488
- My pack. My pack.
There's a first aid kit.

1238
00:56:39,332 --> 00:56:40,799
- Okay, okay, okay,
what now?

1239
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:41,891
Tell us what to do.

1240
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:43,333
- You guys have got
to reset my leg.

1241
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:44,358
It's the bone.

1242
00:56:44,403 --> 00:56:46,337
- Oh, okay.
Jensen, take the camera.

1243
00:56:46,372 --> 00:56:47,737
- I can do this.
It's okay.

1244
00:56:47,773 --> 00:56:49,707
- Be careful with my leg.
- I'm just gonna--

1245
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:51,369
Sorry! Sorry!

1246
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,775
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

1247
00:56:52,812 --> 00:56:54,302
Okay, Andy, Andy, I need to--

1248
00:56:54,347 --> 00:56:56,042
I need to cut the pant leg,
okay, so you just--

1249
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:57,515
- Okay.
Out it. Out it. Out it.

1250
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,847
- I'm gonna be really quick.
- Okay, okay.

1251
00:56:58,884 --> 00:56:59,942
Just don't--

1252
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:00,953
- Just--just be brave.

1253
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:02,784
I promise I'm being gentle.

1254
00:57:02,822 --> 00:57:05,188
Shit.
Shit, okay.

1255
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:08,216
Andy, just stay calm.
It's gonna be okay.

1256
00:57:10,663 --> 00:57:12,255
Okay, okay.
It's fine. It's fine.

1257
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:13,765
I'm just gonna do it this way.

1258
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:16,131
Okay, JP, in a second,

1259
00:57:16,168 --> 00:57:18,261
I'm gonna need you
to get something that we can--

1260
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:20,966
Oh, my God.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1261
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:22,907
- How is it?
- Okay. It's okay.

1262
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:24,876
- How is it?
- It's okay. It's okay.

1263
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:26,400
I really can't do this, JP.

1264
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:28,845
- It's okay.
I got it. It's okay.

1265
00:57:28,881 --> 00:57:31,281
It's--it's not as bad
as you thought.

1266
00:57:31,317 --> 00:57:32,614
It's--
- Okay.

1267
00:57:32,651 --> 00:57:34,312
- Jensen, please go get a piece
of wood

1268
00:57:34,353 --> 00:57:35,479
or something we can make
a splint with.

1269
00:57:35,521 --> 00:57:36,647
- Let me see it.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1270
00:57:36,689 --> 00:57:37,656
- It's not as bad
as you thought.

1271
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,055
You're gonna be okay.
All right, hold on.

1272
00:57:39,091 --> 00:57:40,956
- It's gonna be okay.
I promise you. I promise you.

1273
00:57:40,993 --> 00:57:43,086
I'm just--
I'm just a little squeamish.

1274
00:57:43,129 --> 00:57:44,255
- This is gonna hurt a little.

1275
00:57:44,296 --> 00:57:46,196
This is just gonna hurt
a little, okay?

1276
00:57:46,232 --> 00:57:49,395
- You got to reset it.
You got to reset it now.

1277
00:57:49,435 --> 00:57:50,595
- Okay.

1278
00:57:50,636 --> 00:57:51,864
- All right, brother.

1279
00:57:51,904 --> 00:57:53,895
I'm gonna go on three, okay?

1280
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:55,497
Take some deep breaths.
Get ready. Okay.

1281
00:57:55,541 --> 00:57:57,099
- Okay.
- Get ready.

1282
00:57:57,143 --> 00:57:59,737
- Just do it anyway.
- All right, on three.

1283
00:57:59,779 --> 00:58:01,076
Ready?
One.

1284
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:05,207
That wasn't so bad.
That wasn't so bad.

1285
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:06,616
It's done.
It's done.

1286
00:58:06,652 --> 00:58:08,313
- Not for you.
- It's done. It's all over.

1287
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:11,084
Okay.
Oh, shit.

1288
00:58:11,123 --> 00:58:14,422
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.

1289
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,552
- It's okay.

1290
00:58:15,594 --> 00:58:16,959
- Is this thing really on?

1291
00:58:16,996 --> 00:58:18,224
- Oh, sh--yeah.
- Turn it off!

1292
00:58:18,264 --> 00:58:19,629
I don't want people
to see me like this!

1293
00:58:19,665 --> 00:58:20,654
Turn it--

1294
00:58:28,274 --> 00:58:30,799
I told you that won't work.

1295
00:58:30,843 --> 00:58:34,643
- I paid
for the international plan.

1296
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,511
- This is so stupid.
We need help.

1297
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:37,880
We have to send up the flare.

1298
00:58:37,917 --> 00:58:39,441
- If whoever did this
sees the flare--

1299
00:58:39,485 --> 00:58:40,884
- Nobody did this!

1300
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,514
- I don't know, JP.
I mean, maybe Jensen's right.

1301
00:58:43,556 --> 00:58:45,421
- No.

1302
00:58:45,458 --> 00:58:46,925
This is why Andy risked his life

1303
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:48,392
to go back and get the pack,
okay?

1304
00:58:48,427 --> 00:58:50,019
It's late enough in Vizhay
that somebody will be up.

1305
00:58:50,062 --> 00:58:51,586
They have to see it.

1306
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:55,133
Do you have to do that?

1307
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,862
- No matter how this ends,

1308
00:58:56,902 --> 00:58:59,735
I want there to be a record
of what happened to us

1309
00:58:59,772 --> 00:59:02,866
so we don't end up
another Dyatlov mystery.

1310
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,141
- If we're gonna do this, can we
at least get some cover first?

1311
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,512
- I don't think
that we can move Andy.

1312
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,279
- What was that?

1313
00:59:13,319 --> 00:59:14,616
- What?

1314
00:59:14,653 --> 00:59:17,383
- That look.
What the hell's goin' on?

1315
00:59:21,093 --> 00:59:23,061
- We found something before

1316
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:25,029
when we were out
with the Geiger counter.

1317
00:59:28,234 --> 00:59:29,724
- What did you find?

1318
00:59:31,403 --> 00:59:33,997
- A door.

1319
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:35,631
- What?

1320
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:38,404
We've been freezing
in this freaking snow all day

1321
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:41,311
and there's a freaking bunker
here?

1322
00:59:41,347 --> 00:59:43,110
- We couldn't open it anyway,

1323
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:46,482
and the radiation was--
was strong.

1324
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:50,986
- How strong?

1325
00:59:51,023 --> 00:59:54,356
- Not dangerous, but...

1326
00:59:54,393 --> 00:59:56,190
- You're unbelievable.

1327
01:00:02,535 --> 01:00:04,969
Did you plant the footprints?

1328
01:00:05,004 --> 01:00:08,132
- No, I didn't plant footprints.

1329
01:00:08,174 --> 01:00:09,869
- I don't believe you.

1330
01:00:09,909 --> 01:00:13,310
- Fine.
Don't believe me.

1331
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:21,317
Okay.

1332
01:00:23,122 --> 01:00:24,749
If somebody did start
this avalanche,

1333
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:27,156
the reason why
is in there, right?

1334
01:00:27,193 --> 01:00:28,387
- Yeah.

1335
01:00:28,427 --> 01:00:29,621
- Let's send up the flares.

1336
01:00:29,662 --> 01:00:31,289
We'll get some people out here,
and that way,

1337
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,890
whoever is doing this has
no option of killing us anymore.

1338
01:00:34,667 --> 01:00:35,998
- Okay.

1339
01:00:50,783 --> 01:00:52,182
Come on.

1340
01:00:54,987 --> 01:00:56,284
- Huh.

1341
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:58,381
- What?

1342
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:02,260
- Orange lights in the sky.

1343
01:01:07,299 --> 01:01:09,324
- JP, I'm so sorry.

1344
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:13,167
I should have told you,
but you were just--

1345
01:01:13,205 --> 01:01:15,673
you guys were so worked up
about the compass

1346
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,437
and--and the map.

1347
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:22,413
And I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

1348
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:29,981
- You--you followed
a step-by-step plan

1349
01:01:30,022 --> 01:01:31,614
that killed nine people.

1350
01:01:31,657 --> 01:01:34,125
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1351
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:36,719
I don't know.

1352
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,324
I just--

1353
01:01:44,370 --> 01:01:47,862
I've just always been drawn
to this place,

1354
01:01:47,906 --> 01:01:49,840
and I don't know why.

1355
01:01:49,875 --> 01:01:52,139
I can't explain it.

1356
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,848
I didn't mean for this.

1357
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:01,515
Do you think
that anybody saw the flare?

1358
01:02:03,022 --> 01:02:05,786
- I don't know.

1359
01:02:05,824 --> 01:02:07,018
But if we have to sit out here
much longer,

1360
01:02:07,059 --> 01:02:08,788
I'm gonna rip that goddamn door
off its hinges,

1361
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:10,226
radiation or not, okay?

1362
01:02:11,697 --> 01:02:13,995
- Okay, looks like

1363
01:02:14,033 --> 01:02:17,469
it's blueberry pancakes
or mac and cheese.

1364
01:02:17,503 --> 01:02:20,165
- You got to go with blueberry
for breakfast.

1365
01:02:20,205 --> 01:02:22,139
- Agreed.

1366
01:02:22,174 --> 01:02:23,607
- Hey, Jensen.

1367
01:02:23,642 --> 01:02:25,041
- Yeah, what's up?

1368
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:26,635
- Hey, man.

1369
01:02:26,679 --> 01:02:28,738
Man, I'm sorry about Denise.

1370
01:02:30,082 --> 01:02:31,310
I really am.

1371
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:35,116
You can think whatever you want
to think, but I'm--I'm sorry.

1372
01:02:35,154 --> 01:02:36,553
- Yeah, me too.

1373
01:02:38,457 --> 01:02:40,925
Holy shit, somebody's coming.
Look.

1374
01:02:41,994 --> 01:02:46,727
- Help!
We need help!

1375
01:02:46,765 --> 01:02:48,699
- We saw flares!

1376
01:02:48,734 --> 01:02:50,599
Are you all right?

1377
01:02:50,636 --> 01:02:54,436
- Our friend is hurt!

1378
01:02:54,473 --> 01:02:56,407
- Don't look.
He's lying.

1379
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:57,636
- What?
- They don't have any packs.

1380
01:02:57,676 --> 01:02:59,007
How'd they get here so fast?

1381
01:02:59,044 --> 01:03:00,136
They were following us.

1382
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:01,271
- You see?
I told you.

1383
01:03:01,313 --> 01:03:02,507
They're the ones
that set the charges.

1384
01:03:02,548 --> 01:03:03,515
- Go.
- Who?

1385
01:03:03,549 --> 01:03:04,516
- The military.
- Go.

1386
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:06,142
- We're not leaving you, Andy.

1387
01:03:06,185 --> 01:03:07,914
- Look, just go!
I can't go anywhere.

1388
01:03:07,953 --> 01:03:09,147
- Help me lift him up.

1389
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:10,450
- We'll get you up.
We'll get you up.

1390
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:13,014
- I can't go anywhere!
- One, two, three.

1391
01:03:14,126 --> 01:03:15,718
- Okay, okay.
He's right.

1392
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:17,126
- Shit.
- I can't go. I can't. I can't.

1393
01:03:17,162 --> 01:03:18,789
Just go. Go without me!
Go now!

1394
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:20,059
- Jensen, the door.

1395
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:21,327
- Okay, got it.

1396
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:22,629
- JP, you're gonna follow us,
okay?

1397
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:23,726
- Wait. Wait.

1398
01:03:23,769 --> 01:03:25,066
Give me the flare gun
out of the pack.

1399
01:03:25,104 --> 01:03:26,162
Give me the flare gun.

1400
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:29,999
- Hurry up.

1401
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:34,603
We got to go now.
- Go.

1402
01:03:34,646 --> 01:03:35,635
- I'm not gonna leave you here.

1403
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:40,647
We'll send help.

1404
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:42,551
- Oh, shit.

1405
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:47,624
Jesus, they're shooting at us.
What the--

1406
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:53,997
- Oh, Jesus.

1407
01:03:54,032 --> 01:03:54,999
No!

1408
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:56,330
- Go!
- Oh, my God!

1409
01:03:56,368 --> 01:03:57,596
- Come on!
- JP!

1410
01:03:57,636 --> 01:03:58,625
- Get up!
Get up!

1411
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,501
- Jensen!
- JP, come on!

1412
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:01,528
- Shit!

1413
01:04:04,643 --> 01:04:06,543
- Come on, Holly.

1414
01:04:09,782 --> 01:04:10,840
Get up!

1415
01:04:15,087 --> 01:04:16,111
- Open the door.

1416
01:04:16,155 --> 01:04:17,952
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.
Shit, shit.

1417
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:19,890
Open it!

1418
01:04:19,925 --> 01:04:22,052
- It's already open.
It's just frozen shut.

1419
01:04:22,094 --> 01:04:23,823
- Guys, guys!

1420
01:04:26,899 --> 01:04:29,094
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

1421
01:04:29,134 --> 01:04:30,761
Open it!
Get inside! Get inside!

1422
01:04:30,803 --> 01:04:32,168
Come on!

1423
01:04:32,204 --> 01:04:33,535
Get in!

1424
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,898
- Holly?

1425
01:04:35,941 --> 01:04:38,307
- Shut the door!
Shut the damn door!

1426
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,847
- Lock it!

1427
01:04:42,881 --> 01:04:45,349
- It locks from the outside!
Help me hold it closed.

1428
01:04:47,186 --> 01:04:49,086
JP?
- Uh, yeah?

1429
01:04:49,121 --> 01:04:51,555
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm bleeding a lot.

1430
01:04:51,590 --> 01:04:52,750
- Put pressure on it.

1431
01:04:53,992 --> 01:04:55,254
- JP, it's all right.

1432
01:04:55,294 --> 01:04:56,556
- Just stay still for a second.

1433
01:04:56,595 --> 01:04:57,562
I dropped the camera.

1434
01:04:57,596 --> 01:04:58,961
I need to find the camera.

1435
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:07,602
Okay, I--I got it.

1436
01:05:07,639 --> 01:05:10,267
Oh, my God.

1437
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:12,470
- What do you see?

1438
01:05:12,511 --> 01:05:15,173
- Uh, it's a tunnel.

1439
01:05:15,214 --> 01:05:17,341
We--we're in a tunnel.

1440
01:05:20,452 --> 01:05:22,443
- Ah!
- Help.

1441
01:05:24,723 --> 01:05:26,486
- Okay.

1442
01:05:32,998 --> 01:05:34,465
- What do you see?

1443
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,990
- Um, um...

1444
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:39,470
Oh, it's a switch,
a power switch.

1445
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:40,494
- Flip it!

1446
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:42,234
- Okay, okay.
Fine.

1447
01:05:49,615 --> 01:05:51,378
It worked.
- Oh, thank God.

1448
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,849
- It worked.
- Come on.

1449
01:05:52,885 --> 01:05:54,443
We need to barricade the door.

1450
01:05:54,486 --> 01:05:55,885
- Why?

1451
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:57,183
- Because if it locks
from the outside,

1452
01:05:57,222 --> 01:05:58,382
they can get in
whenever they want.

1453
01:05:58,423 --> 01:05:59,617
- No one's coming in here, man.

1454
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:01,148
They're not gonna waste
the bullets.

1455
01:06:01,193 --> 01:06:02,251
- Goddamn it, Jensen.
Just--

1456
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:03,454
- No, look.
Have you looked around?

1457
01:06:03,495 --> 01:06:06,464
No one is coming to save us.

1458
01:06:06,498 --> 01:06:08,557
We're on our own.

1459
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,001
They know that in a few days,
we're gonna dehydrate.

1460
01:06:12,037 --> 01:06:14,597
Then they don't have to worry
about any mess.

1461
01:06:16,074 --> 01:06:18,042
- So that's it, then?

1462
01:06:18,076 --> 01:06:20,840
They just lock the door
and come back in a week?

1463
01:06:20,879 --> 01:06:23,347
- Unless we can find a way out.

1464
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:25,873
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

1465
01:06:25,918 --> 01:06:29,251
- Okay, uh, careful.
Be careful.

1466
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:30,346
- Shit.

1467
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:33,350
- Okay.

1468
01:06:35,027 --> 01:06:36,824
We go straight.
- Okay.

1469
01:06:38,764 --> 01:06:39,992
- Jensen, stay close.

1470
01:06:40,032 --> 01:06:42,728
- Okay.
Just go slow. Go slow.

1471
01:07:00,786 --> 01:07:02,549
- Turn around! Go!
- Shit!

1472
01:07:02,588 --> 01:07:03,748
Shit, other tunnel!
Other tunnel!

1473
01:07:03,789 --> 01:07:04,813
- Other way.

1474
01:07:04,856 --> 01:07:06,414
- JP, JP, JP.

1475
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:12,089
- What? What? What? What?

1476
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,654
- I just felt something.

1477
01:07:13,699 --> 01:07:15,633
- What?

1478
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:17,157
- Something is here.

1479
01:07:17,202 --> 01:07:18,328
- Just follow me.

1480
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,769
- Something is here, Jensen,
I swear.

1481
01:07:19,805 --> 01:07:20,897
- No, it's not.

1482
01:07:20,939 --> 01:07:22,270
No, there's nobody down here,
guys.

1483
01:07:22,307 --> 01:07:23,638
Come on.

1484
01:07:26,244 --> 01:07:27,404
Shit.

1485
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:28,743
- Which way?

1486
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:30,270
- Left.

1487
01:07:30,315 --> 01:07:32,010
- Just take it easy.
Go slow. Go slow.

1488
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:33,984
- Okay.

1489
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:34,986
- Hey.

1490
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:36,453
- The lights are still on here.

1491
01:07:36,488 --> 01:07:37,978
- Stay close.

1492
01:07:38,023 --> 01:07:40,287
- Okay.
Oh, shit.

1493
01:07:41,326 --> 01:07:42,657
- Don't go too far ahead.

1494
01:07:48,634 --> 01:07:49,896
Keep going.
Keep going.

1495
01:07:52,771 --> 01:07:55,797
Oh, Jesus.

1496
01:07:58,243 --> 01:07:59,733
- What is this place?

1497
01:07:59,778 --> 01:08:02,838
- It's a--a lab, I think.

1498
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,240
At least it was.

1499
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:08,548
What happened in here?

1500
01:08:08,587 --> 01:08:10,521
- Who knows?

1501
01:08:10,555 --> 01:08:13,115
- Sit down.
Let me see. Let me see.

1502
01:08:13,158 --> 01:08:15,023
- Wait.

1503
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:16,618
Here.

1504
01:08:16,662 --> 01:08:18,129
Use this.

1505
01:08:19,931 --> 01:08:21,592
- Yes, okay.

1506
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:22,998
This is gonna hurt.

1507
01:08:26,071 --> 01:08:27,766
I'm sorry.

1508
01:08:31,877 --> 01:08:34,402
Just rest here
for a few minutes.

1509
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:47,884
- Uh, I fou--
I found an opening.

1510
01:08:47,926 --> 01:08:49,416
- Be careful.

1511
01:08:49,461 --> 01:08:50,826
- Yeah, no problem.

1512
01:08:57,402 --> 01:08:59,597
Look at this place.

1513
01:09:02,708 --> 01:09:04,141
Whoa.

1514
01:09:08,613 --> 01:09:11,104
Ho--Holly, come here.
Look at this.

1515
01:09:13,251 --> 01:09:14,445
- What is it?

1516
01:09:14,486 --> 01:09:17,387
- It's, uh, a logbook,
I think.

1517
01:09:19,591 --> 01:09:21,024
- I know this word.

1518
01:09:21,059 --> 01:09:22,526
- You do?

1519
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:26,258
- Yeah, I saw it lots of times
when I was researching this.

1520
01:09:26,298 --> 01:09:27,458
- What does it mean?

1521
01:09:29,067 --> 01:09:31,160
- "Killed in action."

1522
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:33,831
- Of course it does.

1523
01:09:33,872 --> 01:09:35,737
Can you read anything else?

1524
01:09:35,774 --> 01:09:37,469
- Just the dates.

1525
01:09:37,509 --> 01:09:39,306
1945.

1526
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:42,913
1959,

1527
01:09:42,948 --> 01:09:44,939
the year the hikers were killed.

1528
01:09:46,318 --> 01:09:47,979
And then it stops.

1529
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:53,523
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1530
01:09:53,558 --> 01:09:55,492
- What?
It's a boat.

1531
01:09:55,527 --> 01:09:57,961
<i>- It's the Eldridge.</i>

1532
01:09:57,996 --> 01:10:01,454
<i>The USS Eldridge from
the Philadelphia Experiment.</i>

1533
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,525
- What Philadelphia experiment?

1534
01:10:03,568 --> 01:10:04,762
- Come on.

1535
01:10:04,803 --> 01:10:07,328
Have you been under a rock
or something?

1536
01:10:07,372 --> 01:10:09,704
In 1943,

1537
01:10:09,741 --> 01:10:13,438
the United States government
commissioned experiments

1538
01:10:13,478 --> 01:10:14,638
on that ship.

1539
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:16,909
- What kind of experiments?

1540
01:10:16,948 --> 01:10:19,041
- Teleportation.

1541
01:10:19,084 --> 01:10:20,779
Oh, my God.

1542
01:10:20,819 --> 01:10:24,516
There were rumors that people
wound up fused to the ship,

1543
01:10:24,556 --> 01:10:27,423
but no one has ever seen
anything like this.

1544
01:10:27,459 --> 01:10:31,486
These pictures are, like,
top, top secret.

1545
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:34,021
Someone could have been killed
for these.

1546
01:10:34,065 --> 01:10:35,498
Oh, my God.

1547
01:10:36,468 --> 01:10:39,335
- Okay.
We need to get out of here.

1548
01:10:39,371 --> 01:10:40,565
- Uh, yeah.

1549
01:10:40,605 --> 01:10:42,630
- JP, can you move?

1550
01:10:42,674 --> 01:10:44,801
- No.
- Oh, shit.

1551
01:10:44,843 --> 01:10:46,367
- I'm not leaving you here,
okay?

1552
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:48,641
So think of something.

1553
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,671
- Just find a way out, okay?

1554
01:10:51,883 --> 01:10:52,872
- Okay.

1555
01:10:52,918 --> 01:10:54,385
When I do, I am coming back

1556
01:10:54,419 --> 01:10:57,354
and I am dragging you out
myself, okay?

1557
01:10:57,389 --> 01:10:58,617
Let's go.

1558
01:11:20,078 --> 01:11:21,375
- Oh!

1559
01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:24,638
Jesus Christ.

1560
01:11:45,704 --> 01:11:48,571
It's a, uh--
it's a naturally formed cave.

1561
01:11:48,607 --> 01:11:49,869
- Yeah.

1562
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:51,341
- I don't think they tunneled
this one out.

1563
01:11:51,376 --> 01:11:53,810
It looks like it's been
widened a little, but that's it.

1564
01:11:53,845 --> 01:11:55,608
- What are you,
a spelunker now?

1565
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,478
Look at this.

1566
01:11:57,515 --> 01:11:59,745
- That's got to be
a nuclear power cell.

1567
01:11:59,784 --> 01:12:02,082
That's why
there's electricity here.

1568
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,917
- Alexander was here.

1569
01:12:03,955 --> 01:12:06,719
This is where he picked up
the radiation.

1570
01:12:06,758 --> 01:12:09,886
Shit.
There has to be a way out.

1571
01:12:13,031 --> 01:12:14,225
- Be careful.

1572
01:12:18,603 --> 01:12:19,968
Oh, my God.

1573
01:12:27,345 --> 01:12:28,812
He's dead.

1574
01:12:38,223 --> 01:12:40,657
Oh, no way.
- Still works.

1575
01:12:40,692 --> 01:12:42,159
- Here.
Give me that.

1576
01:12:44,562 --> 01:12:47,429
- I told you someone
had been here recently.

1577
01:12:47,465 --> 01:12:49,626
- Who is he?

1578
01:12:49,668 --> 01:12:50,965
- Military.

1579
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,767
- Well, why is he down here?

1580
01:12:57,475 --> 01:13:00,342
- If you were thinking
about killing five Americans

1581
01:13:00,378 --> 01:13:03,745
to keep a secret that had been
buried for 50 years,

1582
01:13:03,782 --> 01:13:05,079
wouldn't you send somebody

1583
01:13:05,116 --> 01:13:07,175
to make sure there was still
a secret to keep?

1584
01:13:12,324 --> 01:13:13,723
- What--what are you doing?

1585
01:13:13,758 --> 01:13:14,986
- Checking something.

1586
01:13:15,026 --> 01:13:17,995
- Oh, shit.

1587
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:20,930
- That thing we found
in the weather tower...

1588
01:13:20,966 --> 01:13:22,661
- That was his tongue?

1589
01:13:22,701 --> 01:13:24,965
- Uh-huh.

1590
01:13:25,003 --> 01:13:27,870
- Wha--
How did it get up there?

1591
01:13:27,906 --> 01:13:30,238
- He must have
let something out.

1592
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:32,368
- That's why the door
was unlocked.

1593
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:33,843
- They could have been doing

1594
01:13:33,878 --> 01:13:36,904
some kind of experiments
on them, maybe?

1595
01:13:36,948 --> 01:13:39,314
You said there was a lot of that
going on.

1596
01:13:39,351 --> 01:13:40,909
- Oh, my God.

1597
01:13:40,952 --> 01:13:43,512
Holly, look at the bullet holes.

1598
01:13:43,555 --> 01:13:45,921
This wasn't a lab.

1599
01:13:45,957 --> 01:13:47,788
It was an execution chamber.

1600
01:13:47,826 --> 01:13:49,555
Oh, Christ.

1601
01:13:51,363 --> 01:13:53,661
- Holly, what--what is that?

1602
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:03,640
- It looks like
one of the soldiers

1603
01:14:03,675 --> 01:14:04,937
from the book out there.

1604
01:14:14,285 --> 01:14:16,378
I don't understand.

1605
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:17,683
Jensen.

1606
01:14:17,722 --> 01:14:19,815
- These things, they--

1607
01:14:19,858 --> 01:14:21,382
they don't look right.

1608
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:24,158
- Maybe that's what he let out.

1609
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:32,430
- What the hell was that?

1610
01:14:41,379 --> 01:14:43,244
Wait.

1611
01:14:43,281 --> 01:14:46,409
That door wasn't open before,
was it?

1612
01:14:52,924 --> 01:14:54,414
- What's that noise?

1613
01:14:54,459 --> 01:14:55,721
- Be careful.

1614
01:14:59,230 --> 01:15:01,460
- Come up here.

1615
01:15:01,499 --> 01:15:02,864
What was that?

1616
01:15:02,901 --> 01:15:05,699
JP?

1617
01:15:05,737 --> 01:15:07,204
Oh, God.

1618
01:15:13,311 --> 01:15:15,302
Something's here, Jensen.

1619
01:15:20,752 --> 01:15:21,980
Oh, no.

1620
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,282
- Oh, my God.

1621
01:15:28,526 --> 01:15:29,823
Is that blood?

1622
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:31,021
- We need to get--

1623
01:15:31,062 --> 01:15:32,927
we need to get
out of here, okay?

1624
01:15:35,667 --> 01:15:37,100
- Whoa.
What is that?

1625
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:39,365
- I don't know.
Some kind of light?

1626
01:15:39,404 --> 01:15:40,803
- No, underneath it.

1627
01:15:40,839 --> 01:15:42,568
- Let me see that.

1628
01:15:42,607 --> 01:15:45,440
- That--that's the same
as this camera.

1629
01:15:45,477 --> 01:15:46,944
There's still battery life.

1630
01:15:46,978 --> 01:15:48,104
Check what's on there.

1631
01:15:49,214 --> 01:15:50,408
<i>- No recording!</i>

1632
01:15:50,448 --> 01:15:52,143
<i>- I just want to get you
saying that on camera.</i>

1633
01:15:52,183 --> 01:15:53,980
<i>- You must go now, please!</i>

1634
01:15:54,018 --> 01:15:55,212
<i>- Come on, Ivan!
The Cold War's over.</i>

1635
01:15:55,253 --> 01:15:56,220
<i>We're friends now.</i>

1636
01:15:56,254 --> 01:15:57,414
- I don't--I don't--

1637
01:15:57,455 --> 01:15:58,854
- Can we fast-forward
before the battery dies?

1638
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:00,824
<i>- He's dead.
Now go.</i>

1639
01:16:05,697 --> 01:16:07,460
- Stop!

1640
01:16:07,499 --> 01:16:09,729
<i>Check what's on there.</i>

1641
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:11,257
<i>- No recording!</i>

1642
01:16:11,302 --> 01:16:12,769
<i>- I just want to get
you saying that on cam--</i>

1643
01:16:12,804 --> 01:16:14,601
Shit!

1644
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,808
That's--that's impossible.

1645
01:16:20,845 --> 01:16:22,779
- No, no, maybe not.

1646
01:16:22,814 --> 01:16:24,907
<i>Remember the, um--
the Eldridge</i>

1647
01:16:24,949 --> 01:16:26,576
from the Philadelphia
Experiment?

1648
01:16:26,618 --> 01:16:28,711
It was supposed
to have teleported

1649
01:16:28,753 --> 01:16:30,880
from Philadelphia to Norfolk.

1650
01:16:30,922 --> 01:16:32,253
- So?

1651
01:16:32,290 --> 01:16:34,986
- So it's supposed to have
arrived in Norfolk

1652
01:16:35,026 --> 01:16:37,722
ten minutes
before it left Philadelphia.

1653
01:16:39,097 --> 01:16:41,031
- Now you're telling me
there's a goddamn time machine?

1654
01:16:41,065 --> 01:16:44,091
- No, I'm telling you
that no one--

1655
01:16:44,135 --> 01:16:45,864
not our top scientists,

1656
01:16:45,904 --> 01:16:48,566
not the government,
not theirs--

1657
01:16:48,606 --> 01:16:50,665
knew what was going on.

1658
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:52,972
They didn't know
what they were screwing with.

1659
01:16:53,011 --> 01:16:56,003
Holly, all of these experiments
were abandoned.

1660
01:16:57,248 --> 01:16:58,545
<i>The crew of the Eldridge,</i>

1661
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:01,017
the ones that weren't fused
to a bulkhead,

1662
01:17:01,052 --> 01:17:03,350
they went insane.

1663
01:17:03,388 --> 01:17:06,653
Some of them--
some of them even changed,

1664
01:17:06,691 --> 01:17:07,851
mutated.

1665
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:11,353
People weren't meant
to do these things.

1666
01:17:12,897 --> 01:17:14,888
- JP.
- Shit.

1667
01:17:17,202 --> 01:17:19,329
- Jensen, come on!

1668
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,838
Come on!

1669
01:17:23,374 --> 01:17:25,137
- Holly!

1670
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:26,541
- JP!

1671
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:34,610
Holly!

1672
01:17:40,325 --> 01:17:41,485
- Jensen.

1673
01:17:46,831 --> 01:17:49,299
Jensen!

1674
01:17:52,203 --> 01:17:53,830
What are you doing?
Get over here!

1675
01:18:14,025 --> 01:18:15,322
- Oh, God!

1676
01:18:24,235 --> 01:18:25,293
- Where'd they go?

1677
01:18:25,336 --> 01:18:27,304
- They--they came back for me.

1678
01:18:27,338 --> 01:18:28,566
- And they're gonna get you

1679
01:18:28,606 --> 01:18:30,403
if you don't get
your shit together right now.

1680
01:18:48,493 --> 01:18:49,585
JP?

1681
01:18:53,231 --> 01:18:55,256
- They're on the ceiling!
They're on the ceiling!

1682
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:56,995
- Jensen!

1683
01:18:57,035 --> 01:18:59,299
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

1684
01:19:02,407 --> 01:19:04,534
- Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1685
01:19:04,575 --> 01:19:06,736
- Look out, he's up there!
He's up there!

1686
01:19:08,413 --> 01:19:09,607
- Jensen, where'd it go?

1687
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:10,909
- I don't know.

1688
01:19:10,948 --> 01:19:13,382
- Where'd he go?
- Get JP!

1689
01:19:17,288 --> 01:19:18,983
Run!

1690
01:19:19,023 --> 01:19:21,082
- Jensen!

1691
01:19:23,728 --> 01:19:25,559
I'm gonna get her away
from that door!

1692
01:19:25,596 --> 01:19:27,120
When I do, you run!
Got it?

1693
01:19:27,165 --> 01:19:28,393
- Got it!

1694
01:19:31,436 --> 01:19:32,767
- Run!
Watch out!

1695
01:19:32,804 --> 01:19:34,396
- Come on!
Come on!

1696
01:19:34,439 --> 01:19:36,430
- Let's try the tunnel!
- Right behind you!

1697
01:19:36,474 --> 01:19:38,465
Go! Go!

1698
01:19:38,509 --> 01:19:40,773
- Jensen, this way!

1699
01:19:44,782 --> 01:19:46,340
- Holly. Holly.

1700
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:50,481
- Oh!

1701
01:20:05,169 --> 01:20:06,261
- Go. Go.

1702
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:10,173
- Why'd they let us go?

1703
01:20:10,208 --> 01:20:11,505
Why'd they stop?

1704
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:13,635
- I don't know.
We should be dead.

1705
01:20:13,678 --> 01:20:16,647
Why didn't they kill us
when they had the chance?

1706
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:31,321
- What the hell is that?

1707
01:20:31,362 --> 01:20:33,626
- It's like a giant fossil.

1708
01:20:45,109 --> 01:20:46,599
- What are they doing?

1709
01:20:46,644 --> 01:20:49,579
- They're waiting for us.

1710
01:20:49,614 --> 01:20:51,275
- JP--I said that I would
go back for him.

1711
01:20:51,315 --> 01:20:53,613
- No, we can't go back for him.
You saw what they did to him.

1712
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:54,845
If we open that door,

1713
01:20:54,886 --> 01:20:56,751
they're gonna do
the same thing to us.

1714
01:20:56,788 --> 01:20:58,449
We're trapped,
and they know it.

1715
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:01,356
We're in here because this
is where they wanted us to be.

1716
01:21:06,697 --> 01:21:08,824
- Holly, are you seeing that?

1717
01:21:08,866 --> 01:21:09,992
- Yeah.

1718
01:21:11,269 --> 01:21:12,361
- Do it again.

1719
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:23,545
- You recorded that, right?

1720
01:21:23,581 --> 01:21:24,809
- Yeah.

1721
01:21:24,849 --> 01:21:26,908
Good.

1722
01:21:26,951 --> 01:21:30,182
I knew it.
I knew it.

1723
01:21:30,221 --> 01:21:31,245
- What?

1724
01:21:31,289 --> 01:21:33,951
- Teleportation.

1725
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:37,119
Those creatures, the way
that they just disappear,

1726
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:40,153
become intangible.

1727
01:21:40,198 --> 01:21:42,894
They can teleport...

1728
01:21:42,934 --> 01:21:45,562
but not through the doors
down here.

1729
01:21:45,603 --> 01:21:47,867
- That's why they all lock
from the outside.

1730
01:21:49,407 --> 01:21:51,671
- There's got to be a connection
between those things

1731
01:21:51,709 --> 01:21:54,109
and this place.

1732
01:22:03,988 --> 01:22:06,013
- They came from here.

1733
01:22:06,057 --> 01:22:08,116
They came through this.

1734
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:10,286
- That makes sense.

1735
01:22:10,328 --> 01:22:15,732
It's kind of like
a giant wormhole,

1736
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:19,133
like, a--a transporter.

1737
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:21,468
- But how did it get here?

1738
01:22:21,506 --> 01:22:22,666
- I don't know.

1739
01:22:28,613 --> 01:22:30,205
Holly.

1740
01:22:30,248 --> 01:22:32,443
The Mansi, the natives.

1741
01:22:32,483 --> 01:22:35,111
Alya said that they'd been here
for thousands of years.

1742
01:22:35,152 --> 01:22:36,710
I don't know
how this thing works,

1743
01:22:36,754 --> 01:22:38,585
but I bet these drawings
are theirs.

1744
01:22:43,661 --> 01:22:45,754
- So they built a teleporter.

1745
01:22:45,796 --> 01:22:47,127
- I don't know.
Maybe.

1746
01:22:47,164 --> 01:22:48,131
Hell, maybe they just

1747
01:22:48,165 --> 01:22:49,462
found this thing
down in the cave

1748
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:51,092
and put the drawings on it.

1749
01:22:51,135 --> 01:22:54,593
It could be some kind
of alien technology.

1750
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,937
Maybe they were trying
to weaponize it.

1751
01:22:56,974 --> 01:23:01,104
What if there are more portals
like this around the world?

1752
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:03,477
If those things came out
of one of them,

1753
01:23:03,514 --> 01:23:05,744
it could explain all kinds
of unsolved mysteries:

1754
01:23:05,783 --> 01:23:07,512
<i>the Eldridge,</i>

1755
01:23:07,552 --> 01:23:10,453
the Mothman sightings
in Point Pleasant.

1756
01:23:10,488 --> 01:23:12,183
Who knows what else?

1757
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,057
Flashlight's dead.

1758
01:23:17,094 --> 01:23:19,119
Shit.

1759
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:20,687
- Jensen, I can't see.

1760
01:23:20,731 --> 01:23:22,096
- It's okay.
Just take my hand.

1761
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:23,259
There you go.
You got it.

1762
01:23:23,301 --> 01:23:25,269
Okay, watch your step.
Okay, okay.

1763
01:23:25,303 --> 01:23:27,362
We're going up to the door.

1764
01:23:27,405 --> 01:23:28,394
Okay, sit--

1765
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:29,463
Reach out in front
and sit down.

1766
01:23:29,507 --> 01:23:30,474
Okay, you got it.

1767
01:23:30,508 --> 01:23:31,532
- Okay.
- All right.

1768
01:23:39,784 --> 01:23:42,480
- It happened.

1769
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:44,078
- What?

1770
01:23:44,121 --> 01:23:46,954
- I opened the door,
and the darkness swallowed me,

1771
01:23:46,991 --> 01:23:48,151
just like in my dream.

1772
01:23:48,192 --> 01:23:50,558
- Hey, come on. Come on.
Hey, hey, hey.

1773
01:23:50,595 --> 01:23:51,584
That was a dream.

1774
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:52,653
- I'm sorry.

1775
01:23:52,697 --> 01:23:54,164
- It was a dream.

1776
01:23:54,198 --> 01:23:57,065
- Jensen, we're never gonna
get out of here.

1777
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:00,194
I'm sorry.

1778
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:49,251
Is the camera on?

1779
01:24:49,286 --> 01:24:50,844
I can see the light.

1780
01:24:50,888 --> 01:24:51,855
- Yeah.

1781
01:24:52,857 --> 01:24:54,586
Why?

1782
01:24:56,661 --> 01:24:58,424
- I have an idea.

1783
01:25:00,097 --> 01:25:01,962
- Not tic-tac-toe again,
Jensen.

1784
01:25:01,999 --> 01:25:03,261
We're just killing the battery.

1785
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,790
- No, no, no.

1786
01:25:06,203 --> 01:25:07,534
The gate.

1787
01:25:10,474 --> 01:25:14,843
What about ripping holes
in the space-time continuum

1788
01:25:14,879 --> 01:25:17,609
and obliterating
our puny human brains?

1789
01:25:18,716 --> 01:25:20,240
- That's my plan.

1790
01:25:21,819 --> 01:25:23,218
You see...

1791
01:25:25,523 --> 01:25:28,458
it's got no controls.

1792
01:25:28,492 --> 01:25:31,620
It has no buttons,

1793
01:25:31,662 --> 01:25:36,326
which means that it either goes
to one fixed place

1794
01:25:36,367 --> 01:25:37,959
or anywhere.

1795
01:25:39,403 --> 01:25:41,098
- Anywhere?

1796
01:25:41,138 --> 01:25:42,901
- That's all I can think of.

1797
01:25:44,575 --> 01:25:47,169
But what if you--

1798
01:25:47,211 --> 01:25:51,671
you picture somewhere
clear in your mind

1799
01:25:51,716 --> 01:25:56,016
and you concentrate on it
and that is where it takes you?

1800
01:25:57,288 --> 01:25:59,313
- You can just think,
"There's no place like home,"

1801
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:00,846
that easy.

1802
01:26:00,891 --> 01:26:02,222
- That easy.

1803
01:26:05,296 --> 01:26:08,356
- And we won't wind up fused
to a mountain or something?

1804
01:26:10,401 --> 01:26:12,335
- I don't know.
I hope not.

1805
01:26:17,141 --> 01:26:19,302
- We're gonna die here, Jensen.

1806
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:26,314
- It's this...

1807
01:26:28,552 --> 01:26:29,849
or them.

1808
01:26:34,325 --> 01:26:35,553
- Okay.

1809
01:26:37,261 --> 01:26:38,455
What do we do?

1810
01:26:41,098 --> 01:26:43,032
- Um, well, um...

1811
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:44,967
I'm doing a lot
of guessing here.

1812
01:26:46,470 --> 01:26:48,199
But I think it should be
someplace

1813
01:26:48,239 --> 01:26:53,142
that--that is still fresh
in your memory,

1814
01:26:53,177 --> 01:26:54,974
someplace nearby,

1815
01:26:55,012 --> 01:26:58,778
someplace that you can--
you can picture clearly.

1816
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,340
- Outside the mountain.

1817
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:04,981
- Wait. You mean
the other side of the door?

1818
01:27:05,022 --> 01:27:07,650
- It's certainly the freshest
thing in our minds.

1819
01:27:07,691 --> 01:27:09,420
And now that the door's locked,

1820
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:11,928
it will protect us
from those things, right?

1821
01:27:18,602 --> 01:27:19,899
- Okay.

1822
01:27:21,405 --> 01:27:22,667
- Okay.

1823
01:27:53,971 --> 01:27:55,734
I'm scared.

1824
01:28:05,049 --> 01:28:07,711
- "Everything is all right,

1825
01:28:07,751 --> 01:28:10,311
and everybody has to do
exactly what he does."

1826
01:28:11,889 --> 01:28:13,720
- What's that from?

1827
01:28:13,757 --> 01:28:15,452
<i>- Slaughterhouse Five.</i>

1828
01:28:17,995 --> 01:28:19,519
- I never read it.

1829
01:28:23,934 --> 01:28:25,492
