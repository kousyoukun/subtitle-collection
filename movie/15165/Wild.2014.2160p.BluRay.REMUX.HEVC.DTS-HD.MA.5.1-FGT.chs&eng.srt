526
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,390
That's why you're losing toenails.

537
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,710
And your pack, ifsinsane.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}你的背包 太恐怖了{\r}

538
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,080
We need to do a little pruning.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我们得精简一下{\r}

539
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,000
Okay, so I'm gonna pick out

540
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,880
the stuff that's useless to you.

541
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,300
And you can leave it in the free box

542
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,590
unless you can give me a good reason
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}那个不用的箱子里除非你能给我一个理由{\r}

543
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:05,760
why you need it with you.

599
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:15,780
And they're catching a bus up to Reno and on to Truckee,

600
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,740
just, rejoining the trail at a lower elevation.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}再回到主干道{\r}

601
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:20,160
I didn't come out here to ride buses.

603
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,460
to slide off the side of a mountain, either.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}就滑到山脚下了{\r}

604

{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}或是肢解我也没有关系{\r}

638
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,130
Hey, going north?

649
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,660
I think you're mistaken. I'm not a hobo.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}首先你搞错了 我不是流浪汉{\r}

650
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:51,160
Second of all, that's a real thing, the Hobo Times?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}其次《流浪时代》是真的吗？{\r}

651
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,130
Yeah, it's real enough to pay for my rent and gas.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}绝对是千真万确{\r}

652
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,630
So, how long have you been out on the road?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}你在这路上出来多长时间了？{\r}

653
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,260
I'm not "on the road." I'm hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我不是"在路上" 我在太平洋山脊径徒步旅行{\r}

654
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,050
I just had to bypass a chunk of it
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我只是要绕过那里{\r}

655
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:04,220
because there was a snowfall this year.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}因为今年那儿要雪崩{\r}

656
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,140

{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}如果你不是流浪汉 那你住在哪里？{\r}

657
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,760

{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}等我徒步旅行完了后我可能去波特兰住{\r}

659
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,730

662
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,440
And that's probably because women cannot walk out of their lives.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}可能是因为女人没法走出她们的生活圈{\r}

663
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:23,070
They've got kids to take care of,
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}他们要照顾孩子{\r}

664
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:25,070

666
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,030
I am.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}没错{\r}

667
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,830
That's excellent. That's fantastic. I love feminists.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}太好了 太棒了 我喜欢女权主义者{\r}

668
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,040
So you're trying to tell me you're not a hobo,
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}你一直说你不是流浪女{\r}

669
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:36,920
so that means you have a job then, right?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}那你有工作吗？{\r}

670
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,590

I hope you don't think this is too personal,
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我希望你不要觉得我在问你私人问题{\r}

673
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,140
but I've noticed it's often personal trauma
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}但我发现很多人心灵受到创伤后{\r}

674
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:52,350
that forces people out of their life
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}就会想着逼自己走出他们的生活{\r}

675
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,230
and into the hobo life. Would you say that's been the case for you?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}过着流浪汉的生活 你觉得你也是这样吗？{\r}

676
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,520

{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}这就是我的生活 我只想出来透透气{\r}

677
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,110

678
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:04,360
I don't know what else to tell you.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我不知道还要怎么跟你说{\r}

679
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,070
- Can I get a shot? - No! That...
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}- 我可以拍张照吗？- 不行 那…{\r}

680
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,790
Yeah, this should be in the fall issue.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}这可能要到秋季期刊的时候出来{\r}

1109
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:54,850

1110
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,640
Sounds good.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}听着不错啊{\r}

1111
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,560

1113
01:37:05,070 --> 01:37:06,980
- "If your nerve deny you... " - ...go above your nerve."

1117
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,330
No, that was Robert Frost.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}不是是罗伯特·弗罗斯特{\r}

1118
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:17,330
The Whitman was, "Be curious, notjudgmental."
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}惠特曼说的是 "要有好奇心 但别太挑剔"{\r}

1119
01:37:17,410 --> 01:37:18,620
Yes.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}对{\r}

1120
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:21,160
"God is a ruthless bitch." You left the name off.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}"上帝是个无情的贱货" 是你说的吗{\r}

1121
01:37:21,250 --> 01:37:23,080
- That one was me. - You're our hero.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}- 这句是我说的 - 你是我们的英雄{\r}

1122
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,130
Okay, fellas, I'm shutting up now.

1123
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:27,000
We just wanted to pick up our post?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我们想拿包裹{\r}

1124
01:37:27,090 --> 01:37:29,380

1126
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:31,800
But you wouldn't really have to reopen
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}但你其实不用再开一次{\r}

1127
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,090
because you haven't closed yet.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}因为你还没有关门{\r}

1128
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:35,140
And their packages are right there.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}他们的包裹就在那儿{\r}

1129
01:37:35,220 --> 01:37:36,600
It's such a miserable night.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}今晚是个悲惨的夜晚{\r}

1130
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,310
Whatever's in them is gonna make the night just that much better.

1131
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:40,730

1132
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,360
That your horse?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}那是你的马？{\r}

1133
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:50,860
If you want to take her out in the morning, she could do with it.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}要是你明天早上想带她走的话 尽管拿去吧{\r}

1134
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:54,660
Hey, so the campsite, is it left? Left, right?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}嘿 营地 在左边 还是右边？{\r}

1135
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,950

1138
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:05,880
Number one and number two.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}一瓶两瓶{\r}

1139
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:09,840
Just a little. Just a little.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}一点点 一点点就好了{\r}

1140
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:14,340
Wonderful!
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}太好了{\r}

1141
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:17,010
So, Cheryl, how do you deal with
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}谢丽尔 你自己一个人{\r}

1142
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,260
being on your own all the time?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}是怎么做到的？{\r}

1143
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:21,390
I mean, we're with each other and we're still sick of ourselves.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我们几个人一起都已经很恼火了{\r}

1144
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:22,480
Mmm-hmm.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}嗯{\r}

1145
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,810
No. I've been to most of the places in my head that
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}没有其实很多地方我也不想去的{\r}

1146
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,650
I didn't want to go to, but I feel like there's
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}但我觉得一定有一两个原因{\r}

1147
01:38:28,730 --> 01:38:32,860
one or two that, for whatever reason, I just...
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}不管是什么原因 我…{\r}

1148
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:34,320
I hear you.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我明白你的意思{\r}

1149
01:38:34,610 --> 01:38:38,950
There's a few girlfriends that I'm in no hurry to think about again.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}有几个女朋友 我再也不会考虑了{\r}

1150
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,920
I think I know exactly who you're talking about. Right?
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我好像知道你在说谁了{\r}

1151
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:48,540
I don't want to talk about this right now.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我现在不想说这个{\r}

1152
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:54,050
Not again! Good night!
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}不要有下次了 晚安{\r}

1153
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:14,990
Just please try to do the kindest thing.

1154
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
We don't have to do this.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我们没别要这样{\r}

1155
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:39,510

1156
01:39:40,970 --> 01:39:43,220
There has to be another way.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}得想想别的办法{\r}

1157
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,730
We don't have the money to do it right.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我们没有钱给它治疗{\r}

1158
01:39:46,810 --> 01:39:48,400
We can't go to a vet.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}我们看不了兽医{\r}

1159
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:55,440
Leif, she's just going to die slowly and painfully.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}列夫 她会慢慢地痛苦地死去{\r}

1160
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:03,080
Just please do the kindest thing.
{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}像个最好的办法{\r}

1161
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:07,970
Hey, brother, it's me.

{\fn华文楷体\fs16\1c&HE0E0E0&}听着 我知道我们无家可归 但是…{\r}

1163
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:14,110
