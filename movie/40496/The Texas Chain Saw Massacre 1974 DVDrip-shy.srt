1
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,200
...this inditement is only one of
a series to be handed down...

2
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,840
as result of the respectful
rangery investigation.

3
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,840
Ray Robbin, in Texas, is this
hour top news story...

4
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,240
and informant led officers at
Marto County sheriff...

5
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,040
department, to a cemetery, just
outside the small rude Texas...

6
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,160
community of Newt, early this
morning. Officers there...

7
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,600
discovered what appeared to be
a grizzly work of art...

8
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,880
The remains of a badly
decomposed body, wired to a...

9
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,640
large monument. A second body
was found in the ditch near...

10
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,680
the perimeter of the cemetery,
subsequent investigation has...

11
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,800
revealed at least a dozen empty
crypts, and it's clear more...

12
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
will turn up as the probe
continues deputies report...

13
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,160
that in some instances, only
parts of the corpses have been...

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,680
removed. The head,
or in some cases...

15
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,120
the extremities removed, and...

16
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,880
the remainder of the corpse left
intact. Evidence indicates the...

17
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,000
robberies have occurred over a
period of time.

18
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,400
Sheriff Rhesus Maldonado
refuses to give details...

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,520
in this case and said only...

20
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,040
that he did have a strong
evidence linking the crime to...

21
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
elements outside the state. Area
residents have reportedly...

22
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,720
converged on the cemetery
claiming the remains of relatives

23
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
have been removed.

24
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,320
No suspects are in custody, as
investigation at the scene...

25
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,440
continues.

26
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
...mental hospital and released.
A 16-story-building downtown...

27
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,160
Atlanta, collapsed today, killing
at least 29 persons.

28
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,680
The engineering firm responsible
could offer no explanation for...

29
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,960
the collapse although the
construction firm say there's...

30
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,560
no logical reason for the
collapse is suspected sabotage.

31
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,880
Police in Gary, Indiana, have
been unable to identify the...

32
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,040
bodies of a young man...

33
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,200
and four children
who had...

34
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,160
their features carved away,
the man's dimples had been...

35
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,520
removed. Police first identified
the victims as 2 women...

36
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,280
continuing the program of the
government to overwhelm reaches...

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,640
beyond the Amazon today are
ruptured into violence...

38
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
forces of at least three South
America governments already...

39
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,440
have been involved.

40
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,800
...this territory it tells it's
sketchy and yet none of...

41
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,600
the governments is involved
as its knowledge to a war.

42
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,000
...Police in Dallas arrested a
young couple today...

43
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,960
complaints by neighbors led
them to discover a 18-month-old

44
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,680
daughter the couple...

45
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,320
chained in the attic of a
dilapidated house...

46
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,640
Franklin!

47
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,520
Are you ok?

48
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,160
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take...

49
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,880
- much more of this.
- The condition of retro gradation...

50
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,120
is contrary or inharmonious to the
regular direction of actual...

51
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,160
movement in the zodiac, and is,
in that respect, evil.

52
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,720
Hint: When malefic planets are in
retrograde, and Saturn is malefic...

53
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,040
their maleficies are increased.

54
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,240
Have you been doing that Reader's
Digest worth our...

55
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,600
Jerry, it just means Saturn's a bad
influence. It's just particularly...

56
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,240
bad influence now, because
it's in retrograde.

57
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,760
Hey, man, do you believe all that
stuff your old lady is talking me?

58
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,640
My granddaddy is buried here. Can
we find out if anything happened?

59
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- See that big heavy fella...

60
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,640
standing with that big flashlight,
isn't that the sheriff?

61
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,920
You go tell him your granddaddy is
buried in there. He'll let you in.

62
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,800
Ok. Thank you.

63
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,280
Hey, fella, I'm gonna
run off to...

64
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,320
- meet him if you don't mind, do you?
- Not at all.

65
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,080
- Hey, folks. Let us go see where...

66
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,680
her granddaddy's buried.

67
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,240
Things happen here about
they don't tell about.

68
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,600
I see things.

69
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,320
You see, they say it's just an old
man talking.

70
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,760
You laugh at an old man...

71
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,440
this thing that laughs
knows better.

72
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,960
Yes, they're sure. The man said the
Tallman's grave had been dug up.

73
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,520
Mama, don't worry.
I saw it myself!

74
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,520
It didn't look dug up to me.

75
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,240
What's that? What smell?

76
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
What is that stench?

77
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,960
Hey. That's the old slaughterhouse.
That's where Grandpa used...

78
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,720
to sell his cattle! We got an uncle
that works in one of those places...

79
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,920
outside of Fortworth. See those
buildings there? That's where...

80
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,440
they kill him. They bash'em in the
head with a big sledgehammer!

81
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,360
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill him.

82
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,480
It'd start squealing and freaking
out, they'd have to...

83
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,680
come up and bash'em 2 or 3 times.

84
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,040
They'd scatter them before
they were even dead.

85
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,840
That's horrible! People shouldn't
kill animals for food.

86
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,200
They don't do it like that anymore.
Now they get this big air gun...

87
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,840
that shoots a bullet into the skull
and then retracts it.

88
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,080
Franklin, I like me, please
change the subject.

89
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
That smell's still going on.

90
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,280
Oh, man! It's hot in here.

91
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,440
- Hitchhiker!
- Should we take him up?

92
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,920
Yeah man, pick him up.
He'll asphyxiate out there!

93
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,760
- What does he look like?
- The son of a bitch 's gonna...

94
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,000
- smell like the slaughterhouse.
- Give the guy a break. He can...

95
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
- sit by Franklin.
- What do you wanna do?

96
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
- He's weird looking, no.

97
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,120
- I think we just picked up Dracula.
- Where're you heading, man?

98
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,320
- You work at that place?
- Don't.

99
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,440
- How did you get stuck out here?

100
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,480
- I was at the slaughterhouse.
- I got an uncle that works...

101
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,840
- at a slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

102
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,960
My grandfather, too.

103
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
My family's always been in beef.

104
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
The whole family are cracked.
Hey man, did you go into that...

105
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,480
slaughter room or whatever
they call it?

106
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,800
Where they shoot the cattle
with that air gun thing?

107
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,480
- That gun is no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

108
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,920
With the sledge!
That was better.

109
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,520
- They died better that way.
- How come? I thought the gun...

110
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,600
- was better.
- Oh no. With the new way...

111
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,240
- people were put out of jobs.

112
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,400
- You do that?
- Look!

113
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,680
- I was the killer!
- Let me see them.

114
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,400
- They don't seem to head your way.
- You took these, huh?

115
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,720
- Yeah!
- Franklin.

116
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,160
- Let me see.
- They make hitches...

117
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:33,000
They take the head and they boil,
except for the tongue, and scrape...

118
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,640
all the flesh away from the bone.

119
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
They use everything,
they throw nothing away.

120
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:45,600
They use jaws, muscles, and
the eyes, and the ligaments...

121
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,120
- and everything!
- Look at this.

122
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,000
- They boil the nose and the gums
down to a big jelly of fat.

123
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,240
I don't know it was in that stuff.

124
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,320
It's really good. Do you like it?

125
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,000
- Yeah, I like it. It's good!
- It sounds horrible. Can't we...

126
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,720
- talk about something else?
- You'd probably like it if you...

127
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,760
didn't know what was in it.

128
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,840
I wouldn't and I wish you'd
stop talking about it.

129
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,880
Take it before everybody's sick.

130
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,760
What are you doing?

131
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,440
Look. I think that might hurt.

132
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,520
Oh, come on!

133
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,280
What are you doing to yourself?

134
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,280
Oh, what are you doing?

135
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
Nice, man!

136
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,120
I have this knife.

137
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,360
Put that away, too.

138
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,360
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man. Put it back.

139
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,680
You took my picture!

140
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,160
You can take me to my house.
I live right off this road.

141
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,240
I don't know, man.
We're in much of a hurry.

142
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,520
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

143
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,160
Couldn't you just walk? I mean...
If it's so close.

144
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,360
You could have dinner with us.
You like head cheese. My brother...

145
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,280
- makes it real good. You'll like it.
- I think we'd better push on, man.

146
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,600
Don't we, Jerry?
Yeah, I'm sorry...

147
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,880
- It didn't turn out so good.
- It's a nice picture.

148
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,280
- You can pay me now.
- Huh?

149
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,000
- 2 dollars. It's a good picture.
- No, man. Franklin...

150
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,080
give him back that picture.

151
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,760
I'm about to freak. Call a cop.

152
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,720
That's the last damn hitchhiker
I ever take.

153
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
- Listen to Franklin's horoscope:
- I'm sorry.

154
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Travel in the countryside.

155
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,120
Long range plans,
upsetting persons...

156
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,920
around you, could make this a
disturbing and unpredictable day.

157
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,720
The events in the world are not
doing much, to cheer one up.

158
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,080
- That's just perfect!
- Franklin, I think you'll be alright.

159
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,400
Hey, Kat, read Alex's. He's
Capricorn.

160
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,560
Oh, no.

161
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,800
Capricorn is ruled by Saturn.
There are moments where we...

162
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,280
cannot believe that what's
happening is really true...

163
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,880
pinch yourself and you may
find out that it is.

164
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,400
Hurry up.

165
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,440
Here comes somebody.

166
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,200
How are you?

167
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,920
Would you fill her up, please?

168
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,480
I got no gas.

169
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,520
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty. Transport won't...

170
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,480
be here until this afternoon.

171
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,440
Maybe not even until
tomorrow morning.

172
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,240
Hey, you know where "The Old
Franklin Place" is?

173
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,000
- "The Old Franklin Place"?
- It's an old 2-story house and...

174
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,240
it's sitting up on the hill. I think
you have to turn on the road...

175
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,440
back there,
but I'm not real sure.

176
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,000
Maybe I've seen something like
that up there. But look, you boys...

177
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,320
don't wanna go messing around
an old house.

178
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,560
Those things are dangerous,
you're bound to get hurt!

179
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,680
- We'll be careful.
- Don't wanna go fooling around...

180
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,800
other folk's property. Some folks
don't like it.

181
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,680
They don't mind
showing you.

182
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,720
- My father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

183
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,960
- Yeah.
- Look...

184
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,760
I got barbecue here. Why don't
you stay a while?

185
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,880
The transport will be by
in a little while...

186
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,720
I can go and get some barbecue.

187
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,520
Them girls, they don't wanna go
messing around an old house.

188
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
Best you stick around here.

189
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,840
We should've asked him if there's
another gas station around here.

190
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
Don't you think he would have told
us if there was?

191
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
- It wouldn't hurt to ask.
- I'll go ask.

192
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,000
What the hell, we should have
stopped back there for gas.

193
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,280
Go, damn it.
There.

194
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,960
You think this place has
room service?

195
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,080
Franklin, you're cutting the van!

196
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,680
Yeah, I just started doing that.

197
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,480
I bet this is some of that guy's
blood. Look at that.

198
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,840
- Think it's his blood?
- I guess so.

199
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
That's blood, alright. And I got
cut the hell out of him, chef.

200
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,080
You think you could do that
to yourself?

201
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,440
Crazy?

202
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,280
It takes something, though, I mean,
do that to yourself, like he did.

203
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,480
You think I said something that
made him mad?

204
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,400
- What?
- Franklin, you're crazy as he was.

205
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,800
Hey, I got us some barbecue.
Newt's the closest place to get gas.

206
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,840
We're going to that Granpa's place.
There's a creek, you can go swimming.

207
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,360
Come on, Sally, we're going to
that Granpa's place!

208
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,320
- Let's go.
- Hey, that guy smeared blood...

209
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,120
- all over the van.
- Let's not waste time to wipe this up.

210
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,760
What? What did you do?
You're in someone's van?

211
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,120
Let me see your knife.

212
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,960
Thank you.

213
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,800
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that service...

214
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,360
station, you're towing us back
in that chair.

215
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,320
Hey...

216
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,080
You think that guy was just trying
to scare us by blowing out...

217
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,360
my picture like that?

218
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,560
Oh, look, they let the place
fall apart.

219
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,920
Put it over there.

220
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
- Wanna go over there?
- Let's go.

221
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,360
Oh, Kirk, come on!

222
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,360
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

223
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,280
I want to see the smear
the guy made.

224
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,400
This is weird.
I wonder if that means something.

225
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,880
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's gonna get you.

226
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,480
- Why don't you wash it off, ok?
- I want to see inside.

227
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,560
- Jerry!
- Ok!

228
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,440
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

229
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,960
- Get it. You wash it up.
- You don't think that guy...

230
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,800
- is trying to follow us, do you?
- What for?

231
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,320
Where's my knife?
Kirk?

232
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,600
Looks like it must have been
a nursery room.

233
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,600
This was my room. I got to stay
here until I was 8 years old.

234
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,400
- Until my grandmother died.
- What happened?

235
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,160
- To my grandmother?
- Yeah, she died.

236
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,360
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- I think it's seen better days...

237
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,560
These animals would to put me to
sleep when I was a little girl.

238
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,920
Look at the zebra. I had this
fascination for the zebras...

239
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,440
Kate?

240
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,880
Sally!

241
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,200
Come on, Franklin!
It's gonna be a fun trip.

242
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,120
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'll take it!

243
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,480
- Hey, Franklin!
- What's wrong?

244
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,440
Didn't you say there was a
swimming well out here?

245
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,280
Pam and I would like to go
swimming in there.

246
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,400
There used to be a trail down
between those two old sheds.

247
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,320
Come on.

248
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,360
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- We'll see them in an hour or so.

249
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,360
Yeah. See them down in
about an hour or so.

250
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,920
Sally!
Sally...

251
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,480
Seed growing in the world...

252
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,080
I don't want to miss it.

253
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,880
Man, a scorpion,
there's a scorpion!

254
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,640
Crap!

255
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,280
This must be it!

256
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,560
Are you ok?

257
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,120
What the hell, Franklin would never
get down here anyway.

258
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,920
I bet he must have when
he was little.

259
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,880
Franklin never was little.

260
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,240
Gasoline.

261
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,160
I can leave my guitar, you know,
I'd give him a couple of bucks...

262
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,640
We gotta come back by here anyway,
I can pick up my guitar and...

263
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,880
give him a couple more dollars
and we get more gas...

264
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,920
He won't want your guitar,
he's not gonna sell us some gas...

265
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,680
let's just go back now.

266
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,480
Hey, come here!
Come here, look at this.

267
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,200
- A generator!
- What?

268
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,080
A generator! For electricity!

269
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,600
Hey, hello! Is there anybody
in the house?

270
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,320
Hello! Is anybody home?

271
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,000
I got something for you.

272
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,560
Let's go!

273
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,120
Hello?

274
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,520
Hello?

275
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,160
- Come look at this!
- Let's go!

276
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,960
Hello!

277
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,360
Anybody home?

278
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,400
Hello?

279
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,200
Hey, Pam!

280
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,200
Hello!

281
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,080
Kirk!

282
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,640
Kirk!

283
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,280
Kirk!

284
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,760
Kirk?

285
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,160
Kirk!

286
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,040
Kirk?

287
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,160
Kirk?

288
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,320
He's gonna get you, Franklin.
He's coming to get you!

289
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,360
You don't think it means anything?

290
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,440
We'll protect you if
he tries to get you.

291
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,120
- Maybe it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

292
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,160
- It probably doesn't mean anything.
- You worry too much.

293
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,680
He couldn't find us, anyway.
He doesn't even know our names.

294
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,680
I gave him your name, Franklin.
And I told him where you lived.

295
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,440
I even gave him your ZIP code.
He's gonna kill you.

296
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,920
Jerry...

297
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,080
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

298
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,120
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife, remember?

299
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,120
When did you have it last?

300
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,760
I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

301
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,520
I gave it to you, remember?
What did you do with it?

302
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,360
I don't know. Didn't I
give it back to you?

303
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,680
No, I didn't have it when I got
out of the van.

304
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,920
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right. I'll look for it.

305
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Listen, I think I'll walk down to
the creek before it gets too dark.

306
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,000
How do I get there, Frank?

307
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,360
Well, there's a trail down there.
Between the two old sheds.

308
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,520
- Can I go too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

309
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,800
All right.

310
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,880
I can't find it.

311
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,680
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

312
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,560
You really are mad, huh?

313
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,840
I don't blame you.

314
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,440
Kirk!

315
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,800
You really didn't want me
to come, did you?

316
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,760
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.
It's been a long day.

317
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,480
Did you believe all that stuff
Pam was telling about?

318
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,360
Saturn, and retrograde,
and all that?

319
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,920
I don't know. Everything means
something, I guess.

320
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:17,160
You don't think that guy is
trying to follow us, do you?

321
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,280
I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

322
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,960
He'd probably find
Kirk and kill him.

323
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
- Sally...
- What now?

324
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,680
Nothing.

325
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,400
Nevermind.

326
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,000
Kirk!

327
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,960
Hello?

328
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,280
Is anybody home?

329
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,240
Excuse me, I'm looking for
some friends. Hello?

330
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,960
Is anybody here?

331
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,440
Damn.

332
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,240
Kirk!
Are you guys in there?

333
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Hey, guys! Quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

334
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Pam, is that you?

335
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,640
Okay, you guys!

336
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,640
Come on out.
Come on!

337
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,680
Kirk?

338
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,440
They must be lost. They don't
have a flashlight or anything.

339
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,400
If they 're not back in a minute,
we'd better go look for them

340
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,400
What if we get lost, too?

341
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,280
Sally, we ought to go to that
gas station and get help.

342
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,840
I'm not leaving here
without Jerry.

343
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,480
Jerry!

344
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,640
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

345
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,920
Jerry!

346
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,080
Jerry!

347
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,720
Hey!

348
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:39,840
They'll probably be back
in a minute or so.

349
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,800
Sally, we ought to go
to that gas station.

350
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,360
Sally...

351
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:52,720
I think we ought to go.

352
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,720
Are the keys in the van?

353
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,480
Could I see the flashlight
for a minute?

354
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,360
What for?

355
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,320
Let me see the flashlight.
I'm gonna go look for them.

356
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,560
You don't have to go.

357
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,000
Sally, no, I don't think that's
a good idea, Sally.

358
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,880
I don't think you ought to go.

359
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,360
Look, I'm gonna honk
the horn one more time.

360
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,840
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No, I'm gonna honk the horn...

361
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,880
and we will wait a minute, and
they will come and we will go.

362
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,920
All right?

363
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,960
Sally, they took the keys!
We don't have any keys!

364
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,480
They took the keys!

365
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,200
Stop it!
Stop it!

366
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,240
- Now give me the flashlight!
- No, Sally! You can't go!

367
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,360
What if they came back
and we weren't here?

368
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,840
- Franklin, give me that flashlight!
- I'll keep the flashlight!

369
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,120
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right! All right!

370
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,000
I'll go with you. I'll go
with you, all right?

371
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,040
I'll go with you, but I'll
keep the flashlight.

372
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,920
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

373
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,840
I can't push you down the hill!

374
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,400
Sally...

375
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,640
- Look, I'll go with you...
- Never mind, I'll go without it.

376
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,720
All right. Sally, wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.

377
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,520
Sally! Hold on a minute now.

378
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,200
All right, let's go.

379
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,360
Let's go, I'll go with you.

380
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,160
Sally, I can't keep up with you!

381
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,720
Sally!

382
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,240
Sally, wait a minute!

383
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,200
Hold on!

384
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,040
Jerry!

385
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,320
Jerry!

386
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:16,440
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

387
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,760
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

388
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,400
I thought I heard something.

389
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,440
There's a light!

390
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,160
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

391
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:41,320
- It looks like a house.
- Come on, push!

392
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:55,000
- It's a house!
- I can't see it very well.

393
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,680
- Franklin, this is impossible.
- Come on, Sally!

394
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,080
Get back and push, damn!

395
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,160
Impossible!

396
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,560
I heard something over there!

397
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,920
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

398
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,760
Sally, I hear something.
Stop! Stop!

399
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,880
Help!

400
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,400
Help me!

401
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,880
Help!

402
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:33,080
Help me, please!

403
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:28,760
- Help! Help!
- Whoa! Whoa!

404
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,240
- Help me! Help me!
- Come over here!

405
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,920
You're all right, girl.
Okay?

406
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,520
Hold on, take it easy, all right?

407
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,760
He killed...

408
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,400
- Take it easy...
- He killed Franklin...

409
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,600
Call the police!

410
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:54,400
Jerry!

411
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,040
I don't know what happened
to the others...

412
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,080
There's nobody out there now!

413
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,440
Take it easy!
Take it easy!

414
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,800
What happened?

415
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,160
- Call the police...
- There's no phone here.

416
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,320
We have to drive to the sheriff's.

417
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Take it easy. Take it easy.

418
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,200
I'll get the truck.

419
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,800
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go! Don't go!

420
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,640
The weather is expected to
continue warm and clear...

421
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,600
and partially cloudy tomorrow...

422
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,040
with no chance of precipitation.
Expected high of 90 �F.

423
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,600
Our current temperature is 96�.
Winds blow southeast at 3 ml/h.

424
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,640
Community 98, kilometer 29.9.

425
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,280
Acting on a typical day
with some news...

426
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:57,240
the word is that the sheriff's
office began an investigation...

427
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,840
early this morning in the
County Cemetery.

428
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,680
Opening crypts and muslins
where there was evidence of...

429
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,640
tampering, The Sheriff found
a reported dozen coffins were...

430
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,520
robbed a part of its contents.
According to the sheriff, Rhesus...

431
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,520
Maldonado, there are ones
from which only the head and...

432
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,280
extremities are removed,
and others

433
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,800
and others from which only a
hand or foot removed, with the...

434
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,040
remainder of the cadaver left
intact. Maldonado linked...

435
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,240
What are you doing?

436
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,440
- You will come with me...
- No!

437
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:06,840
- What do you want?
- There's no need to do that...

438
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,680
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

439
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,520
I had to lock up and
get the lights off.

440
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,840
Because electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

441
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,920
I hope you're not too
uncomfortable down there.

442
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,200
You got nothing to worry about.
Just take it easy.

443
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,920
We're gonna get there soon.

444
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,400
No, no, no.

445
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,720
There's no need to do that.

446
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,720
We always do our best.

447
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,320
Hang on.

448
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,040
No.

449
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,760
Half witch.

450
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,440
You little shit!

451
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,200
You knock-head idiot!

452
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,000
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

453
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,720
You damn fool!
You almost got caught.

454
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,840
No! They didn't see me.
They don't know nothing!

455
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,160
I told you to stay away
from that graveyard.

456
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,200
I told you...

457
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,360
I told you never to leave
your brother alone!

458
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,840
Get that girl out of the car!
Get her out!

459
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,800
I hope your brother didn't let any
of those kids get away.

460
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,280
Look at what your brother did
to that door!

461
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,760
You let her go!

462
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:00,400
You goddamn idiot!

463
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:26,480
I thought you were in a hurry.

464
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,040
Where are the kids?
Where are the children?

465
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,680
Did they get away?

466
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,160
Are you sure?

467
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,560
You...

468
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,320
You damn fool!
You ruined the door!

469
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,600
Hey, come here! Look!
See how nice she looks!

470
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,600
Get upstairs and get
your grandpa!

471
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:31,080
Take it easy there, huh?

472
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,880
You'll stay here for
a few minutes.

473
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,920
Get back in there!

474
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,480
To the chamber!

475
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,800
You just take it easy.

476
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,240
We'll have something
to eat right away.

477
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,920
Hey, you two!

478
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,240
Give me a hand
with grandpa!

479
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,760
Look, grandpa! Look!

480
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,640
Knock it off!

481
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,880
Quiet! You act like a pack
of hounds.

482
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:54,320
- We're just having fun!
- You think this is a party?

483
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:00,600
Please!
You can make them stop!

484
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:04,680
- No shit?
- Shut your mouth!

485
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Can't be helped, young lady.

486
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:13,000
Please! You can't let them
kill me!

487
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,360
He likes this face.

488
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:41,560
He's crazy!
You gotta make him stop!

489
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,360
Please...

490
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,880
- He's just a cook!
- Shut up, you bitch hog!

491
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,480
He always does all the work.

492
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,640
He don't like it. Is that right?
You're just a cook!

493
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,400
Shut your mouth!

494
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,680
You don't understand nothing.

495
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,160
I understand you ain't nothing!
We do all the work!

496
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,240
I just can take no
pleasure in killing.

497
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,680
It's just something we gotta do.
It don't mean you have to like it.

498
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,200
Please...

499
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,040
Please...

500
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,720
I'll do anything you want.

501
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,800
You don't need to torture the girl.

502
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,520
Please, shut up. Remember
you're just a cook.

503
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,200
Let me and him handle this.

504
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,160
I won't have this.

505
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:53,080
You ain't in no hurry.
And you ain't going no place.

506
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:57,640
You don't hear me?
I heard you told me much.

507
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,960
No sense in waiting.
I gotta go to my room.

508
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:10,360
I'll take her to grandpa.

509
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,160
Grandpa'll have some fun.

510
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,120
You always said he was the best.

511
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,280
He's the best all right.

512
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:21,200
Let's let him half leg.
Grandpa, we're gonna let you...

513
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,920
have this one!

514
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,880
Have this one!

515
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,960
He won't use you much.
He won't hurt none.

516
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:46,600
Our grandpa was the best killer
there ever was.

517
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,400
I never took all the guts to see.

518
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,800
I did in 6 in 5 minutes once.

519
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,280
I could've done more if the hook
pulled again could've gotten the...

520
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,080
beaves out of the way faster.

521
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:07,160
Now don't you cry. Grandpa is
the best. It won't hurt a bit.

522
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,200
No!

523
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,760
No!

524
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:30,400
Please! Don't!

525
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,760
Hit her!

526
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,040
Hit the bitch!

527
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,920
Go ahead!

528
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:42,440
Give me the hammer!

529
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,080
Give me the hammer!
I'll kill her!

530
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:40,120
Go! Go!
