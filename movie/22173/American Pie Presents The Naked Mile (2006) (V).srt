What? Why?

Because, if she would just give up
a little ass,

Nothing's wrong.

Because I do. What is it?

You're gonna think I'm an asshole.
Let's just forget about it.

Come on, Erik, you know you can talk to me
about anything.

All right.

140
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,073
It's the sex.

141
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,315
I mean,

142
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,472
we've been together for two years.
Two years, Trace.

143
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,835
I mean, when we were juniors,
it was one thing,

144
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,512
but we're seniors now,
and this whole virgin thing

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,989
is starting to have
some serious consequences.

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,991
I mean, people are dying.

147
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,838
I told you, I'm not ready yet.

148
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,876
I am so ready.

149
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,395
Can't I be ready enough for the both of us?

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,311
It doesn't work that way.

151
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,913
It should.

152
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,829
I'm sorry, Erik.
I know how patient you've been.

153
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,150
I know. It's just sometimes...

154
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,629
What?

155
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,629
Well, you're a girl.
It's a lot easier for you to be a virgin

156
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,518
because the longer you stay a virgin,
the more pure and innocent you seem.

157
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,919
The longer I stay a virgin,

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,436
the more I become the laughingstock
of the entire school.

159
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,677
I'm sorry, but... I mean...

160
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,512
I'm sorry I brought it up.

161
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,232
(BELL RINGING)

162
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,595
I gotta go. I'll see you after school.

163
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,715
Okay.

164
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,949
Bye.

165
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,678
I'm telling you, his dick was this big.

166
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,629
NATALIE: What about Erik?
I bet he's got a big one.

167
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,597
Well, Tracy wouldn't know.

168
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,669
Whatever.

169
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,319
Yeah, I guess it's pretty hard
to figure out dick size from dry humping.

170
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,674
Brooke, that's mean.

171
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,672
Just because I don't have a catalog
of the school's dick sizes like you,

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,716
doesn't mean I don't know a thing or two.

173
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,598
Okay, so how big is Erik's?

174
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,235
See? Told you.

175
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,639
Come on, Brooke.

176
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,153
It's not like that with us.

177
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,435
I mean, Erik's different.
He respects my boundaries.

178
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,476
Well, you better give that boy
a reason to stick around,

179
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,074
or he's gonna find a girl
with looser boundaries.

180
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,595
Erik would never do that.

181
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,238
Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.

182
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,676
He broke up with you over sex,
and that was sophomore year.

183
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,638
Yeah, this just isn't gonna
work without the sex.

184
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,034
God, Trent is cute,
and I heard he just broke up with Holly.

185
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,879
Look, Tracy, we love you, and we love Erik,
but let's get real.

186
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,709
He's a guy, and guys have certain needs.

187
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,475
They really do.
It's like a caveman thing or something.

188
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,950
Yeah, I can't believe
you've kept him tied up this long.

189
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,910
Hey, Erik, guess who I just talked to?

190
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,035
Who?

191
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,076
Your cousin Stifler up at Michigan.

192
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,513
Why are you talking to my cousin Dwight?

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,591
Oh, we talk all the time.

194
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,999
What? We have a lot in common.

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,832
What's that crazy bastard up to?

196
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,515
He's in some fraternity,
and all those guys do is drink and fuck.

197
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,239
And it just so happens that they're throwing
a monster party this weekend

198
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,355
for the Naked Mile.

199
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,509
What's the Naked Mile?

200
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,318
Oh, dude, it's this thing
where thousands of students

201
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,719
run naked through campus.

202
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,916
It's the way of blowing off
steam after exams.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,718
Thousands of naked chicks?

204
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,678
Stifler says that this party is gonna be epic.

205
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,830
Bottom line is, this place is played out.

206
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,194
High school's over for us.

207
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,157
It's time to plant our flag in a new land.

208
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,950
Porn, cumshot, dead grandmother,
grounded forever?

209
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,075
Don't worry.

210
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,311
Just tell your parents that, you know,
you're thinking about going to school there.

211
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,231
- I don't know, man.
- Oh, please.

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,834
Your mom cried when you told her
you were going to school in Boston.

213
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,514
She'll probably help you pack
if she thinks it'll keep you close to home.

214
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,794
I'll help you pack.

215
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,474
I'll make sandwiches.

216
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,635
Chicken salad?

217
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,755
Of course.

218
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,751
Are you gonna get a chance
to see your cousin?

219
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,593
Yeah. We might stop by and say hello.

220
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,433
Now, there's someone you
should definitely look up to.

221
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,795
I bet he doesn't have time
to blow his load on his family.

222
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,552
- Harry, please.
- HARRY: I don't understand.

223
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,712
When I was your age,
I was up to my neck in poontang.

224
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,156
I didn't have time to spank my monkey.

225
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,471
Thank you for that very
disturbing image, Dad.

226
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,269
I mean, Stiflers do not fake
being sick to stay home and pull dick.

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,429
We cut class to get ass.

228
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,795
Yes, I know.
That saying is on our family crest.

229
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,677
Oh, don't let me forget
to pack the Imodium AD.

230
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,034
You know, just in case you get diarrhea.

231
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,951
- Mom.
- I am so excited.

232
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,029
Aren't you excited, Harry?

233
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,758
I'm very excited.

234
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,272
Don't you get excited.

235
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,679
<i>ERIK: It worked
just like you said.</i>

236
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,593
She's helping me pack,
and she's even making us sandwiches.

237
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,079
<i>- Chicken salad?
- Yup.</i>

238
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,229
Sweet.

239
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,992
See, I told you. Never doubt me.

240

<i>RYAN: Man, this weekend is gonna be tits.
I can't wait to see Stifler.</i>

241
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
Hey, how come you never call me Stifler?

242
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,873
You're more of an Erik.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,069
(BEEPING)

244
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,354
Hold on.

245
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,439
That's Tracy. I'd better take it.

246
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,555
All right, later.

247
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,749
Hey, sweetie.
Listen, about today, I'm really...

248
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,876
Erik, I wanna have sex.

249
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,795
Excuse me?

250
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,430
<i>TRACY: I wanna have sex.</i>

251
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,589
Are you serious?

252
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,954
Absolutely.

253
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,513
Do you have me on a conference call?
Because if you do, that is so not cool.

254
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,192
Erik, this isn't a joke.

255
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,950
I want to have sex.

256
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,908
Yes! Yes, yes.

257
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,475
<i>TRACY: Tonight.</i>

258
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,595
What?

259
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,989
Tonight. I wanna have sex tonight.

260
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,993
How am I supposed to get out of my house?

261
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,433
<i>That's up to you.</i>

262
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,155
But at midnight, I'll be in my basement

263
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,798
waiting to be ravished.

264
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,434
I'll be there.

265
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,034
Hypocrite.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,673
So you get the beer and the weed,
and I'll handle the nitrous.

267
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,557
You got it. What's Erik bringing?

268
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,755
Sandwiches.

269
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,310
Nice. Chicken salad and college pussy.

270
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,958
My favorite combination.

271
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,758
Yeah, well, at least you'll get to taste
the chicken salad.

272
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>Ow.</i>

273
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,792
Hey, what do you think Erik's doing
right now?

274
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,996
Probably beating off to dumpster porn.

275
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,070
No more beating off to dumpster porn.
No more virgin jokes.

276
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,390
Tonight, Erik Stifler becomes a man.

277
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,712
- Hi.
- Come on in.

278
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,794
- All right, listen.
- No.

279
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,953
No talking.

Wait.

282
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,395
What?

283
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,833
Did you hear something?

284
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,435
No. Don't worry, my parents are passed out.

285
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,473
Are you sure?
You know how my stomach gets.

286
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,708
Here, I'll help you relax.

287
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,876
You brought something, right?

288
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,036
Oh, shit. I left it at home.

289
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,596
I can run back and get it.
I'll be back in like five...

290
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,114
No, no, don't worry. I've got one.

291
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,069
Do you wanna put it on or should I?

292
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,038
Let's put it on together.

293

Why don't you take an Alka-Seltzer?

301
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,792
Alka-Seltzer is for babies.

Sounds like you could use an Alka-Seltzer.

What was what?

313
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,909
I didn't hear anything.

314
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,558
There was a noise
coming from the laundry room.

I must be hearing things.

See, Daddy? I told you.

801
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,631
Come on, baby, let's dance.

802
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,111
That did not just happen.

803
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,593
Time for a Stifler blowjob!

804
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,990
Oh, get sexy, ladies, I love it.
Oh, I feel a stirring in my loins.

805
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,718
You've gotta meet my roommate.

806
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,675
I would love to.

807
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,793
Dude, the fucking midgets
just stole our women.

808
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,199
RYAN: Yeah, those fuckers are
out of hand.

809
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,831
I told you guys,
don't underestimate those little bastards.

810
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,876
That midget quarterback
stole my girlfriend last year.

811
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,115
Slut!

812
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,031
ROCK: Out of my goddamn way.

813
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:18,559
Holy shit!

814
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,796
I thought this place had a no-loser policy.
What are you assholes doing here?

815
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,233
Fuck off, Mighty Mouse.

816
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,869
Man, don't take it out on me
because your ladies like it short and thick,

817
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,996
rather than tall and skinny.

818
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,669
Rock, don't you know, baby?
This bar is like a roller coaster.

819
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,313
Yeah, it has a height requirement,

820
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,359
- and I'm afraid you just don't measure up!
- Motherfucker.

821
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,354
- Easy! Easy! Easy!
- Whoa!

822
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,668
This isn't over, Shitler.

823
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,557
Oh, you got that right!

824
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,913
Never get in my way, woman.

825
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,159
What's up?

826
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,195
Bitch.

827
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,875
BRANDY: That did not happen.

828
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,032
I swear to God, I was running
through the streets with nylons on my head

829
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,031
and the condom still on.

830
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,998
I can't believe I just told you that story.

831
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,399
I think it's great.

832
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,950
I mean, think of it this way,
you'll never forget your first time.

833
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,598
Well, it wasn't...

834
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:27,949
Technically...

835
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,473
Oh, no, wait.

836
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,916
- You mean you didn't even get to...
- He came down too fast.

837
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,631
Thank you.
Thank you for laughing at my misfortune.

838
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,195
I think you're a sweetheart.
And you're really cute.

839
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,639
This is me.

840
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,911
So, are you guys
running the Mile tomorrow?

841
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,390
I don't know. There's something about
running naked down the street

842
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,357
while you're still a virgin...

843
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,839
Didn't stop you before.

844
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,319
Touch.

845
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:58,234
You never know, that virgin thing,

846
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:01,912
it could totally change
by the end of the weekend.

847
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,878
Thanks for walking me home.

848
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,119
What the hell happened to you last night?

849
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:32,355
What's up, fellas?

850
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,589
What's up?

851
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,116
What's up is we got
cock-blocked by some midgets at the bar.

852
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,158
Cooze, never mind that.
Where the hell were you?

853
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,757
Well, Mother,
if you must know, I was with a girl.

854
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:49,998
Bullshit. What girl?

855
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,548
Her name is Brandy.
She's in a sorority and she's hot,

856
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,949
and I'm supposed to meet her
at the Mile tonight.

857
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,358
Dude, I don't get it.

858
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,638
We come to college,
we get blown off by chicks for midgets,

859
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,473
and you're hanging out with a sorority girl?

860
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,869
What the fuck is going on here?

861
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,515
So, what are you gonna do?

862
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,273
What do you mean?
He's gonna bang that chick.

863
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,108
Aren't you?

864
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,428
What?

865
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,869
Yeah.

866
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,669
Yeah, of course I will.
I'm on a guilt-free pass, why wouldn't I?

867
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,637
Why the hesitation, man?

868
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,558
- Oh, shit! You're not gonna do it.
- I said I'll do it.

869
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,189
Erik, you've been given a gift from above.
Don't fuck it up.

870
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,389
I won't.

871
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,549
Yes, you will.

872
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,629
No.

873
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,470
I... I gotta get out of here.

Calling to see how you're doing.

879
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,674
I'm fine,

880
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,796
<i>- I'm just studying.
- Okay.</i>

881
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,429
Cool.

882
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,671
So, did you guys decide
if you're gonna run in the Naked Mile?

883
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,716
No, not yet.
But you know me, I'll probably just wimp out.

884
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,513
I mean, you don't have to.

885
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,554
Yeah, I know.

886
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,595
Are you okay?
I mean, you sound a little weird.

887
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,348
I'm fine.

888
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,789
I'm fine. I just wanted to call and say hello.

889
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,351
Thanks, but you don't need to check in.
I mean, go, have fun.

890
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,715
That's what this weekend's all about.

891
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,234

894
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,869
- Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
- Hello, Erik, good to see you.

895
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,430
Yeah. Wow, I haven't seen you
since my parents' New Year's party, right?

896
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,149
Yes, well, your folks really,
really know how to ring in the new year.

897
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,949
Look, I'm sorry about my dad
giving you that wedgie in front of everybody.

898
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:15,191
Well, your dad's been doing
that to me since we were kids,

899
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,635
and strangely enough, I enjoy it.

900
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,035
So, what are you doing up here?

901
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,680
Oh, well, I went to school here

902
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,389
and, you know, I like to come
back every now and then

903
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,239
and check out the campus.

904
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,359
That's the only reason I'm here.
No other reason that I can think of.

905
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,113
And what about you?
What are you doing here?

906
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,591
Actually, it's kind of personal.

907
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,910
- Oh. Well, say no more.
- Okay.

908
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,115
Okay, listen, good seeing you.

909
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,872
Yeah, for sure.

910
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,590
Mr. Levenstein, you were a counselor

911
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:56,796
at Tall Oaks Band Camp
with my cousin, Matt, right?

912
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,190
Yes. Yes, I was. And your cousin Matt
needed some counseling...

913
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,909
- Yeah.
...I might add. I gave him some advice.

914
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,833
Advice. Do you think I could

915
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,151
confide something in you?

916
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,159
Well, sure. Yes, Erik, anything. Anything.

917
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:15,355
Okay.

918
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,189
I'm a virgin.

919
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,554
Okay, can I stop you there?

920
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:21,677
You're a Stifler and a virgin?

921
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,229
Yeah.

922
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:29,430
Well, so you're a virgin. What's the big deal?

923
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,517
Well, the other night, my girlfriend and I...
We tried to, you know...

924
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,916
Right. But her father
came down before we had the chance to.

925
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,230
So she changed her mind
completely about the sex,

926
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,278
but she gave me a guilt-free
pass for the weekend.

927
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,590
You got the guilt-free pass?

928
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,718
What do you mean?

929
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:55,715
Well, I mean,
you've got the old guilt-free pass dilemma.

930
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,512
- Yeah.
- It's a tough one.

931
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,716
I didn't think people your age
knew about that kind of stuff.

932
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,758
I believe I know more
about this than you think.

933
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,953
Good, because I just
don't know what to do here.

934
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,555
I mean, I've got
this smoking-hot sorority girl all over me.

935
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,637
Well, you know, my son Jim

936
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:16,836
went through kind of a similar dilemma.

937
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,717
He was going out with this very attractive

938
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,677
foreign-exchange student named Nadia.

939
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,036
Right, right, yeah. That's the one he blew his
load too early with, right?

940
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,189
- Yes.
- Twice.

941
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,554
- Yes.
- Over the Internet.

942
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,232
- Yes, that's the one.
- Yeah.

943
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,517
Well, blowing loads aside...

944
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,635
Yeah.

945
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,950
The next summer Nadia came
to visit Jim at the beach,

946
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,439
and he turned her down

947
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,751
because he had fallen in love with Michelle,

948
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:44,394
who he later married,
and is now the mother of my grandchild.

949
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:49,269
So you're saying
I shouldn't hook up with this sorority girl?

950
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,637
I'm saying I think
only you know the answer to that, Erik.

951
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,633
Well, gotta run.

952
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,075
Oh, Erik, I was sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

953
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,231
Last night was amazing.

954
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,716
Yeah, it was.

955
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:28,598
The three of us should
do it again sometime.

956
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,279

1428
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:50,952
Where are the girls?

1429
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:54,828
They all split this morning. Said they had to
drive to State for some big party.

1430
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,478
That must make you feel pretty special.

1431
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,835
"Special"? Who cares about special?

1432
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,956
All I care about is the sex.

1433
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:04,919
And, baby, I had plenty. Yeah.

1434
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,079
And just how out of hand
was this sex, Cooze?

1435
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:10,549
I don't wanna talk about it. Ever.

1436
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:17,316
Speaking of which,
did you seal the deal with that Brandy chick?

1437
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:20,948
No.

1438
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:22,917
I told you. Pay up.

1439
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,313
But I did have sex with Tracy last night.

1440
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:31,589
What are you talking about?

1441
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,079
Tracy.

1442
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,789
I drove home
in the middle of the night, I ran out of gas,

1443
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:38,952
stole a horse, rode over to Allison's party...

1444
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,110
- We had sex in the guest room.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1445
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:42,838
- You stole a horse?
- Yup.

1446
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:44,672
A real horse?
Like the kind you ride and shit?

1447
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,113
Yeah, a real horse.

1448
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,428
That's fucking fantastic.

1449
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,272
I didn't think you had the
balls for something like that.

1450
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,749
- Neither did I.
- Where did you find a horse?

1451
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,910
Are there horses in Great Falls?

1452
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,399
Proud of you,

1453
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,509
Stifler.

1454
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,958
Thanks, man. I appreciate it.
But call me Erik.

1455
01:33:12,440 --> 01:33:15,238
- RYAN: So, how do you feel?
- Best night of my entire life.

1456
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,629
COOZE: See you in a year,
college pussy!

1457
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,832
Mail call, bitches.

1458
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,475
Scooter.

1459
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:39,749
Scratchy.

1460
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,949
Tripod.

1461
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,115
What the hell?

1462
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,599
What is it, man?

1463
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,919
I don't know.

1464
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,311
<i>Smile for the camera, baby.</i>

1465
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:15,920
Oh, man. That is fucked up.

1466
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,153
Stifler!

1467
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,518
