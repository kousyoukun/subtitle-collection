46
0:04:21,520 -->0:04:23,080
奶奶
Grandma.Grandma.

47
0:04:24,980 -->0:04:26,470
奶奶
Grandma.

48
0:04:28,660 -->0:04:30,760
我奶奶就是那天去世的
And that's the day my grandmother died.

49
0:04:30,840 -->0:04:32,700
我的生活差不多就是这样
And it'spretty much thestory of my life.

50
0:04:32,700 -->0:04:34,100
不过让我从头讲起
But letme backthings up a little bit.

51
0:04:41,000 -->0:04:43,900
那就是我在派对中并不起眼
That's me. Not exactly the life of the party.

52
0:04:46,950 -->0:04:48,610
那是我朋友  麦克库斯曼
That's my buddy,Mike Coozeman.

53
0:04:48,680 -->0:04:52,160
大家都叫他库斯  因为他只喜欢把妹子
Everybody calls him Coozecause that's all he's ever interested in.

54
0:04:52,230 -->0:04:55,540
库斯自称风流倜傥以为自己把妹子很行
Cooze isa self-proclaimed ladies' man and a legend in his own mind.

55
0:04:55,720 -->0:04:58,480
但有时他的方法
sometimes his methods are...

56
0:04:58,480 -->0:04:59,910
让人不敢苟同
questionable.

57
0:05:01,480 -->0:05:03,000
好厉害
Very smooth.

58
0:05:03,400 -->0:05:05,600
拜托  那算是前戏
Oh, please. I consider that foreplay.

59
0:05:05,640 -->0:05:07,780
 -莱恩呢? -不知道
-Where'sRyan? -Idon't know.

60
0:05:07,780 -->0:05:12,220
刚刚才看到他在跟史黛西和雪莉跳舞
Last time I saw him, he was dancing with stacey and shelly.

61
0:05:13,730 -->0:05:16,280
那是我最好的朋友莱恩葛林
That's my best friend, Ryan Grimm.

62
0:05:17,120 -->0:05:19,200
我不知道他怎么办到的
I don'tknow howhe doesit.

63
0:05:21,440 -->0:05:24,190
我就说够让你们两个躺
see, I told you there wasenough for both of you.

64
0:05:24,260 -->0:05:25,630
他二年级时搬到附近来
He movedhere insecond grade.

65
0:05:25,700 -->0:05:29,340
你相信吗那时他还需要我教呢
Believeit or not, back then, I was the one showing him the ropes.

66
0:05:29,410 -->0:05:31,100
现在他是足球队的四分卫
Now he'sthe quarterbackof the football team,

67
0:05:31,170 -->0:05:33,310
也是全校最酷的男生
and thecoolest guy in school.

68
0:05:33,410 -->0:05:35,210
嘿  我拿了伏特加和葱汁汽水给你
Hey, I brought you a vodka and ginger ale

69
0:05:35,210 -->0:05:36,450
这样你才不会闹肚子
so it won't upsetyour stomach.

70
0:05:36,580 -->0:05:38,750
谢了
Oh, thanks.

71
0:05:38,760 -->0:05:41,630
那是我女朋友崔西

72
0:05:42,280 -->0:05:43,770
我们在高一生物课上认识的

73
0:05:43,840 -->0:05:46,710
现在对青蛙切下第一刀
Now makethe first incision into your frogs.

74
0:05:47,330 -->0:05:50,980
往腹部切下去  顺着骨盆方向直到胸
Cut along the ventral side, from the pelvic to the pectoral girdle.

75
0:05:52,550 -->0:05:54,040
噢!
Oh!

76
0:05:55,010 -->0:05:56,770
我不知道她喜欢我哪一点
I don'tknow whatshe sawin me,

77
0:05:56,840 -->0:06:00,890
不过当我鼓足勇气约她出去时她同意了
but whenI finally got upthe nerve to ask her out, she said yes.

78
0:06:01,540 -->0:06:02,490
没关系
No, it'sokay.

79
0:06:02,560 -->0:06:05,530
不知道为什么  她一直跟我在一起
And forsome reason, shekept going out with me.

80
0:06:06,630 -->0:06:08,770
好像她完全了解我
It's like she totally gets me.

81
0:06:10,560 -->0:06:12,640
我尽量试着去了解她
And I try my bestto gether.

82
0:06:18,880 -->0:06:21,340
来  试试低的那个很容易
Come on.Take thelow one. It's easy.

83
0:06:24,230 -->0:06:25,720

0:06:31,140 -->0:06:32,630

0:06:35,490 -->0:06:37,180
你没事吧?

86
0:06:37,830 -->0:06:40,960
不知道有没有人摔破屁股的?
I don'tknow. Isit possible to break your ass?

87
0:06:41,220 -->0:06:44,540
好  我保证不再叫你骑马了
Okay, Ipromise I'll never make you ride a horse again.

88
0:06:45,510 -->0:06:49,300
她好像很完美  对吧?  只有一个问题
Looks like she'sperfect,right? There's just one problem.

89
0:06:51,750 -->0:06:56,020
崔西还不想嘿咻  所以我也还是处男
Tracy'snot readyto havesex yet, so that makes me a virgin.

90
0:06:56,800 -->0:06:59,930
身为学校中仅有的处男之一已经够惨了
Now, being one ofthe only virgins in school is bad enough,

91
0:07:00,420 -->0:07:02,430
但还有更惨的呢
but it'seven worse for me.

92
0:07:03,680 -->0:07:04,670
对
Yup.

93
0:07:05,800 -->0:07:07,390
我是史提夫家的人
I'm a Stifler.

94
0:07:07,620 -->0:07:10,010
我的表哥表弟就是名扬四海的史提夫孩子
My cousins are the legendary Stifler boys.

95
0:07:10,120 -->0:07:12,210
史帝夫他的弟弟麦特
steve, his brother, Matt,

96
0:07:12,210 -->0:07:14,660
还有我们的另一个表哥杜埃特
and ourother cousin, Dwight.

97
0:07:15,810 -->0:07:18,020
因为我是这个家族的人  因此有一份责任
You see,with mylast name comes responsibility,

98
0:07:18,080 -->0:07:20,670
绝不能丢人现眼
a reputation thatI'm supposed to live up to.

99
0:07:20,800 -->0:07:24,280
不过我已经多次让家人失望
Unfortunately, I've let down the family name on more than one occasion.

100
0:07:24,360 -->0:07:25,630
搞屁啊艾瑞克?
What's your problem, Erik?

101
0:07:25,700 -->0:07:28,550
如果是你表哥  一定会帮我偷啤酒
Your cousin would've helped me steal this beer.

102
0:07:28,610 -->0:07:30,430
如果你真的是史提夫家的人
Dude, areal Stifler

103
0:07:30,430 -->0:07:32,090
一定会去干那头山羊
would have totally fuckedthat goat.

104
0:07:32,160 -->0:07:35,940
如果你真的是史提夫家的人你早就跟崔西上床了
lf you were really a Stifler, you would have nailed Tracy by now.

105
0:07:36,550 -->0:07:38,170
史提夫
Stifler.

106
0:07:38,470 -->0:07:42,110
我的姓我的家族渊源  我的诅咒
My name,my legacy, my curse.

107
0:07:46,240 -->0:07:49,110
我真不敢相信你居然因为自慰而让奶奶一命呜呼
I can'tbelieve you killed your grandmother from Jerking off.

108
0:07:49,280 -->0:07:50,880
验尸报告没有明确说明
The coroner's findings were inconclusive.

109
0:07:50,880 -->0:07:53,530
你干嘛还对着那  垃圾箱捡来的A片打枪?
Why areyou stillwhacking it to that dumpster porn?

110
0:07:53,700 -->0:07:56,550
对啊  你怎么不像正常人一样上网?
Yeah, why don't you Justgo on the lnternet like a normal person?

111
0:07:56,580 -->0:07:58,400
因为那天你一整晚在看
Well, because mymom puton that CyberNanny

112
0:07:58,470 -->0:08:01,320
德国恋物癖色情片所以我妈安装了网路分级装置
after you spent the entire night looking up German fetish porn.

113
0:08:01,320 -->0:08:03,520
你真可悲
Man, youare pathetic.

114
0:08:03,840 -->0:08:06,400
你知道我要怪谁?崔西
You knowwho I blame forthis? Tracy.

115
0:08:06,600 -->0:08:08,020
啊?  为什么?
What? Why?

116
0:08:08,070 -->0:08:10,500
因为如果她肯让你爽一下
Because,if she would Just give up a little ass,

117
0:08:10,500 -->0:08:14,660
那你就不会把你亲戚射死了
then maybe you wouldn't be killing your relatives with your money shot.

118
0:08:16,640 -->0:08:19,360
艾瑞克你不能以处男之身毕业
Erik, you cannotgraduatea virgin.

119
0:08:19,360 -->0:08:21,400
你还是史提夫家族的人呢
For Christ's sake, you're a Stifler.

120
0:08:28,680 -->0:08:30,680
甜心  你的数学课如何?

You're gonna think I'm anasshole. Let's Just forget about it.

132
0:08:59,970 -->0:09:03,480
拜托  艾瑞克  你知道我们是无话不谈的
Come on,Erik, you know you can talk to me about anything.

133
0:09:04,930 -->0:09:06,430

137
0:09:18,240 -->0:09:20,510
我们高一时还无所谓
I mean,when we were Juniors, it was one thing,

138
0:09:20,580 -->0:09:22,210
可是现在高三了  你还守身如玉

141
0:09:27,880 -->0:09:31,630
 -我说过我还没准备好  -我早已准备好了
 -I toldyou, I'mnot ready yet. -I am so ready.

142
0:09:31,940 -->0:09:34,180
我准备好不就表示两人都准备好了吗?
Can't Ibe readyenough for the both of us?

143
0:09:34,180 -->0:09:37,670
 -不应该这样说  -应该
 -It doesn't workthat way. -It should.

144
0:09:38,150 -->0:09:40,510
对不起艾瑞克  我知道你一直很有耐心
I'm sorry, Erik.I know how patient you've been.

145
0:09:40,580 -->0:09:42,850
我知道只是有时候...
I know.It's Justsometimes...

146
0:09:43,300 -->0:09:44,510
怎样?
What?

147
0:09:44,580 -->0:09:48,320
你是女孩你要做处女很容易
Well, you're a girl. It'sa lot easier for you to be a virgin

148
0:09:48,390 -->0:09:51,200
因为你做处女越久感觉就似乎越纯洁
becausethe longer you stay a virgin, the more pure and innocent you seem.

149
0:09:51,270 -->0:09:52,610
我做处男越久
The longer I staya virgin,

150
0:09:52,680 -->0:09:56,120
就越成为全校的笑柄
the moreI becomethe laughingstock of the entire school.

151
0:09:57,600 -->0:10:00,280
对不起可是...我是说...
I'm sorry, but...I mean...

152
0:10:00,280 -->0:10:01,300
很抱歉提到这个
I'm sorry I brought it up.

153
0:10:03,010 -->0:10:05,310
我得走了放学后见
I gottago. I'llsee youafter school.

154
0:10:07,360 -->0:10:08,790
好
Okay.

155
0:10:10,660 -->0:10:12,120
再见
Bye.

156
0:10:17,380 -->0:10:20,310
告诉你他的老二有这么大
I'm telling you,his dickwas this big.

157
0:10:21,960 -->0:10:24,290
艾瑞克呢?  他的一定很大吧
What about Erik?I bet he's got a big one.

158
0:10:24,360 -->0:10:26,240
崔西可不知道
Well, Tracy wouldn't know.

159
0:10:26,340 -->0:10:27,900
随便你
Whatever.

160
0:10:28,360 -->0:10:30,970
不真枪实弹来  我想也很难知道老二的尺寸吧
Yeah, Iguess it's prettyhard to figure out dick size from dry humping.

161
0:10:31,040 -->0:10:32,350
布鲁克你好毒
Brooke,that's mean.

162
0:10:32,480 -->0:10:35,390
我可不像你一样  有一本全校男生老二的目录
Just because I don't havea catalog of the school's dick sizes like you,

163
0:10:35,400 -->0:10:37,370
不过这不表示我一无所知
doesn'tmean I don't knowa thing or two.

164
0:10:37,440 -->0:10:40,260
好  那艾瑞克的有多大?
Okay, sohow bigis Erik's?

165
0:10:42,950 -->0:10:45,380
 -看吧?我就说  -拜托  布鲁克
 -see? Told you. -Come on,Brooke.

166
0:10:45,380 -->0:10:46,810
我们之间不是那样的
It's notlike that with us.

167
0:10:46,880 -->0:10:49,090
艾瑞克与众不同  他尊重我设下的界线
I mean,Erik's different.He respects my boundaries.

168
0:10:49,150 -->0:10:51,100
你最好让他有理由留在你身边
Well, you bettergive that boy a reason to stick around,

169
0:10:51,170 -->0:10:53,720
不然他会找个界线更宽松的女孩
or he'sgonna find a girlwith looser boundaries.

170
0:10:54,120 -->0:10:56,960
 -艾瑞克才不会那样 -你以前就是这样说川特的
 -Erik would neverdo that. -Yeah, that's what you said about Trent.

171
0:10:56,960 -->0:11:00,310
他因为嘿休的问题而跟你分手那时是高二
He brokeup withyou oversex, and that was sophomore year.

172
0:11:00,390 -->0:11:03,290
如果不上床  那我们就分手吧
Yeah, this Just isn't gonna work without the sex.

173
0:11:03,940 -->0:11:07,710
天哪  川特好帅  听说他刚刚跟哈莉分手
God, Trent is cute, and Iheard he Just broke up with Holly.

174
0:11:08,580 -->0:11:10,280
崔西  我们都喜欢你
Look, Tracy, we love you,

175
0:11:10,280 -->0:11:12,540
也喜欢艾瑞克  可是你要看清事实
and we love Erik,but let's get real.

176
0:11:13,000 -->0:11:15,380
他是男人男人有某种需要
He's a guy, and guys havecertain needs.

177
0:11:15,560 -->0:11:19,200
真的  就像原始人一样
They really do. It's likea caveman thing or something.

178
0:11:19,200 -->0:11:22,590
我真不敢相信你能把他绑在身边那么久
Yeah, Ican't believe you've kept him tied up this long.

179
0:11:23,560 -->0:11:26,760
 -嘿  艾瑞克  你猜我刚刚跟谁聊?  -谁?
-Hey, Erik, guesswho I Just talked to? -Who?

180
0:11:26,760 -->0:11:28,730
你在密西根的史提夫家表哥
Your cousin Stifler up atMichigan.

181
0:11:28,800 -->0:11:32,320
 -你为什么跟我表哥杜埃特聊?  -我们常常聊啊
 -Why Areyou talking to my cousin Dwight? -Oh, we talk all the time.

182
0:11:32,320 -->0:11:33,660
什么?  我们有很多相似处
What? Wehave a lot in common.

183
0:11:33,730 -->0:11:35,490
那个王八羔子想干嘛?
What's that crazybastardup to?

184
0:11:35,560 -->0:11:39,170
他是一个兄弟会的成员  这些人只会喝酒干炮
He's insome fraternity,and all those guys do is drink and fuck.

185
0:11:39,270 -->0:11:41,920
刚好这个周末他们要开个超级大派对

他们考完试要发泄一下
It's theway of blowing off steam after exams.

190
0:11:49,670 -->0:11:51,390
几千个裸女?

191
0:11:51,460 -->0:11:54,360
史提夫说这个派对将名留青史
Stiflersays thatthis party is gonna be epic.

192
0:11:54,430 -->0:11:56,470
反正  这个地方太无聊
Bottom line is, this place is played out.

193
0:11:56,550 -->0:11:57,860
高中我们已经玩腻了

194
0:11:57,920 -->0:11:59,870
应该另外找地方寻乐

195
0:12:00,190 -->0:12:03,680
A片  射精害死奶奶  永久禁足?
Porn, cumshot, dead grandmother, grounded for ever?

196
0:12:03,840 -->0:12:04,800
别担心
Don't worry.

197
0:12:04,800 -->0:12:06,160
告诉你爸妈说

0:12:12,640 -->0:12:14,160
如果她觉得让你离家比较近的话
She'll probably help youpack

202
0:12:14,160 -->0:12:15,240

不知道我如果检举你能不能拿赏金
Wonder if I get arewardfor turning you in.

310
0:20:31,360 -->0:20:32,810
如果查证属实
If the alleged improprieties are confirmed,

311
0:20:32,810 -->0:20:35,280
这对白宫将是严重的打击
it couldbe devastating for the white House.

312
0:20:35,280 -->0:20:36,990
与政府接近的消息来源

313
0:20:37,000 -->0:20:39,280
对于这项指控不予证实  也不否认

0:20:39,280 -->0:20:42,830
至于当地新闻  一名戴着面具的窃贼闯入民宅
And in local news, a masked burglar broke into an area residence,

315
0:20:42,870 -->0:20:45,090
在该户人家的干衣机里拉屎

316
0:20:45,090 -->0:20:46,990
然后向一名青少女暴露私处

317
0:20:47,060 -->0:20:48,490
警方仍在继续搜索中

318
0:20:48,560 -->0:20:51,340
不过该名嫌犯的下落与身份仍然不明

319
0:20:51,410 -->0:20:52,840
这人怎么这样?
What iswrong with thesepeople?

320
0:20:52,910 -->0:20:54,700
接下来请夏大雪为我们播报气象
And now,Dakota snow withthe weekend forecast.

321
0:20:54,770 -->0:20:56,230

 -你吓到我了  -对不起
 -You scared me. -sorry.

323
0:21:06,740 -->0:21:07,820
昨晚的事...
Listen,about last night...

324
0:21:07,890 -->0:21:11,310
我想还是不要提吧
Yeah, you know, I'd Justreally rather not talk about it.

325
0:21:11,510 -->0:21:13,480
我想应该提
I reallythink that we should.

326
0:21:14,320 -->0:21:17,190
艾瑞克你在我的干衣机里大便
Erik, you took acrap inmy dryer.

327
0:21:17,300 -->0:21:19,690
我被你爸吓到了
Your dadscared the shitout of me.

328
0:21:20,310 -->0:21:21,550
-等等  -我们不如...
-Wait. -You know,let's Just...

329
0:21:21,620 -->0:21:23,690
把这件事忘掉  好吧?
Let's forget about it, okay?

330
0:21:25,750 -->0:21:28,230
好  那另一件事呢?
Okay, but what about theother thing?

331
0:21:31,090 -->0:21:32,650
上床?
The sex?

332
0:21:33,110 -->0:21:35,530
我想昨晚的事是天意
I'm taking last night asa sign from above.

333
0:21:35,640 -->0:21:37,390
可是  如果你爸没有下来的话...
But maybe... I mean, if your dad didn't come down...

334
0:21:37,460 -->0:21:40,360
艾瑞克我爱你  不过
Erik, Ilove you.I'm Just...

335
0:21:40,880 -->0:21:42,770
我还没有准备好
I'm notready yet.

336
0:21:42,930 -->0:21:44,460
真的?
Really?

337
0:21:45,590 -->0:21:46,860
真的
Really.

338
0:21:46,900 -->0:21:50,100
但我知道你早已准备好
But I also reAllzed Justhow ready you are.

339
0:21:51,030 -->0:21:54,960
 -我不希望因为性而分手  -我想我们不需要
-I don'twanna break up over sex. -I don't think we have to.

340
0:21:55,830 -->0:21:56,890
我没有准备好
I'm notready.

341
0:21:56,890 -->0:22:00,080
而你准备好了  我把你绑住实在很自私
You are.It's selfish forme to keep you tied down.

342
0:22:01,910 -->0:22:04,300
所以我有个建议
So, thisis whatI'm proposing.

343
0:22:05,460 -->0:22:07,660
这个周末你去尽情狂欢
A guilt-free passfor this weekend.

344
0:22:07,730 -->0:22:10,760
那表示随便你要做什么都可以
That means you can do whatever you want up there

345
0:22:11,060 -->0:22:13,070
我绝不怪你
with noconsequences.

346
0:22:14,800 -->0:22:16,620
你是说真的?
You're sure aboutthis?

347
0:22:16,820 -->0:22:20,230
我觉得爱与性不一定要彼此牵制
I don'tthink love and sex have to be tied to each other, so

348
0:22:21,140 -->0:22:22,990
所以我没有关系
I'm okaywith this.

349
0:22:23,350 -->0:22:26,410
就一个周末  好好发泄一下
One weekend. Getit out of your system,

350
0:22:27,760 -->0:22:29,650
然后回到我身边

351
0:22:30,900 -->0:22:32,790
你想考验我吗?
Is thissome kindof a test?

352
0:22:33,910 -->0:22:35,530
完全不是
Not at all.

353
0:22:42,320 -->0:22:44,010
-...一箱啤酒  -好
-...andone of bomb beer. -Yes.

354
0:22:44,080 -->0:22:45,770
这真是完美
See, this is perfect.

355
0:22:46,130 -->0:22:47,820
都好了吗?
Hey, weall set?

356
0:22:47,950 -->0:22:49,330

我就说他孬种
I told you he'd puss out.

358
0:22:50,520 -->0:22:53,300
至少三明治带了吧
Tell meyou at least brought the sandwiches.

359
0:22:53,460 -->0:22:56,970
 -有问题吗?  -没问题
-What'sthe problem? -There is no problem.

360
0:22:57,140 -->0:22:59,440
崔西让我这个周末尽情狂欢
Tracy Just gave me a guilt-free pass for the weekend,

361
0:22:59,510 -->0:23:01,840
也就是说我可以为所欲为
which means I cando anything I want.

362
0:23:01,910 -->0:23:03,600
为所欲为?
Anything?

363
0:23:04,210 -->0:23:05,520
你是说...
You mean...

364
0:23:05,620 -->0:23:09,330
对  她说爱与性不一定要互相牵制
Yeah, she said that loveand sex don't have to be linked.

365
0:23:09,360 -->0:23:10,960
她要我好好发泄
she wants me to get it out of my system.

366
0:23:11,030 -->0:23:15,700
你的女朋友一下子从最差劲变成最劲爆
Dude, your girlfriend Just went from the lamest to the coolest in one shot.

367
0:23:16,560 -->0:23:18,600
你们觉得她是在考验我吗?
You guysthink itcould be, like, some sort of a test?

368
0:23:18,610 -->0:23:20,780
-不是  -不是
-No, no.-No, no.

369
0:23:20,880 -->0:23:22,290
崔西是个聪明的女孩
Tracy'sa smart girl.

370
0:23:22,320 -->0:23:23,980
她够成熟知道你是个男人...
she's mature enough to see that you're a man...

371
0:23:24,150 -->0:23:26,550
-对  -...而且你有某些需要
-Yeah. -...and you have certain needs.

372
0:23:26,550 -->0:23:29,010
 -你真的这样觉得? -当然
 -You think so? -Absolutely.

373
0:23:29,840 -->0:23:30,820
你开车
You're driving.

374
0:23:30,900 -->0:23:33,290
上车  我们随便找人就上
Now getin the car so wecan go get you some random pussy.

375
0:23:34,510 -->0:23:38,000
各位先生现在是星期五下午油箱加满了油
Gentlemen, it's Friday afternoon, we've got a full tank of gas,

376
0:23:38,000 -->0:23:40,240
有四分之一盎司的大麻  三箱啤酒
a quarter ounce of weed,three cases of beer,

377

And I amtoo drunk to drive.

379
0:23:46,160 -->0:23:47,660
走吧

380
0:24:07,890 -->0:24:09,960
你确定这东西安全吗?
You surethis shit's safe?

381
0:24:10,030 -->0:24:13,710
跟其他用来制作动物标本  的化学药品一样安全
It's assafe as any otherchemical used to freeze-dry animals.

382
0:24:16,790 -->0:24:19,890
 -你看那只鸡好大 -哪里?
 -Look atthe sizeof thatfucking chicken. -Where?

383
0:24:22,350 -->0:24:24,780
 -搞什么啊?  -哪里有鸡啊?
-Whoa, what the fuck? -What fucking chicken?

384
0:24:24,880 -->0:24:27,050
别担心他产生幻觉了
Relax, he's hallucinating.

385
0:24:28,210 -->0:24:30,120
你发疯了吗?
Are youout of your fucking mind?

386
0:24:30,190 -->0:24:32,940
对啊  崔西  你怎么能这样?
Yeah, Tracy. Whatwere you thinking?

387
0:24:33,010 -->0:24:35,600
你们不是说我应该给他一个留在我身边的理由
But youguys toldme I had to give him a reason to stick around.

388
0:24:35,670 -->0:24:37,450
对  你要给他理由
Yeah, you give him a reason,

389
0:24:37,520 -->0:24:39,910
不是摆明让他去疯狂一个周末
not givehim a free passto go have a weekend orgy.

390
0:24:39,990 -->0:24:41,260
你一定要阻止他
You've got to stop this.

391
0:24:41,330 -->0:24:43,250
如果他这个周末跟别人上床
lf he has sex this weekend,

392
0:24:43,250 -->0:24:44,630
你觉得接下来会怎样?
what doyou think's gonnahappen?

393
0:24:44,790 -->0:24:45,970
他就能发泄一下
That itwill getit out of his system.

394
0:24:45,970 -->0:24:47,690
这样就好了
Oh, yeah. That'show it works.

395
0:24:47,760 -->0:24:50,000
他会吃完大鱼大肉后回来吃小菜
He's gonna go from getting laid back to dry humping.

396
0:24:50,070 -->0:24:51,690
这很冒险崔西
It's pretty risky, Tracy.

397
0:24:51,760 -->0:24:55,060
冒险?  这根本就是打开潘朵拉的盒子
Risky? It's a fucking Pandora's box, literally.

398
0:24:55,790 -->0:24:59,980
他一旦玩过了盒子里面  柔嫩的粉红色天鹅绒
And oncehe's felt the soft pink velvet on the inside of the box,

399
0:25:00,050 -->0:25:03,660
他就不会再满足于用老二磨磨盒盖
he's notgonna goback torubbing his dick on the outside of the lid.

400
0:25:03,730 -->0:25:05,450
我可没这样想过
Never thought ofit likethat.

401
0:25:05,520 -->0:25:07,660
崔西  男人就像狗
Tracy, men are like dogs

402
0:25:07,730 -->0:25:10,320
什么东西都想干
that runaround and humpanything they see.

403
0:25:10,390 -->0:25:13,260
赶快去拿狗链把你的狗拴起来
Now go and get your dog back on its leash.

404
0:25:35,510 -->0:25:37,330
拜托  艾瑞克
Come on,Erik.

405
0:25:42,960 -->0:25:45,300
我就知道没这么好的事
I knew it was toogood tobe true.

406
0:25:50,580 -->0:25:53,330
抱歉  各位  这是为大家好
sorry, kids. It'sfor thebest.

407
0:26:19,120 -->0:26:20,680
崔西?

408
0:26:21,140 -->0:26:22,280

You're back for more yoga.

411
0:26:25,390 -->0:26:26,820
我太太迷上了
Well, mywife ishooked on it,

412
0:26:26,900 -->0:26:29,740
她觉得如果我灵活一点的话
and shethinks ifI can be a little more flexible,

413
0:26:29,740 -->0:26:31,690
我们就能尝试新的...
we can try some new...

414
0:26:33,230 -->0:26:36,910
你听过一本书叫《Kama  sutra》吗?
Have youever heard of abook called the Kama sutra?

415
0:26:38,640 -->0:26:40,020
没有
No.

416
0:26:40,080 -->0:26:41,900
我太太刚买的
Oh, well, my wifeJust got it,

417

里面有些动作需要大力伸展才做得到
and there's somestuff inthere that requires some serious stretching,

418
0:26:45,650 -->0:26:47,630
你知道我的意思吧

419
0:26:48,180 -->0:26:51,280
你还好吗?  你好像有点不高兴
Are youokay, honey? Youlook a little upset.

420
0:26:51,790 -->0:26:54,640
只是跟男友呕气
Oh, youknow, Just some boyfriend stuff.

421
0:26:54,800 -->0:26:56,940
噢  男朋友
Oh, boyfriend stuff.

422
0:26:57,390 -->0:26:59,780
希望我能帮得上忙
Well, ifthere'sanythingI can do.

423

836
0:56:28,260 -->0:56:31,570

Right. But her father came down before we had the chance to.

837
0:56:31,740 -->0:56:33,990
所以她对于性的看法完全改变
So she changed her mind completely about the sex,

838
0:56:33,990 -->0:56:36,950
但是她准许我这个周末尽情狂欢
but shegave me aguilt-free pass for the weekend.

839
0:56:37,020 -->0:56:39,290
你有尽情狂欢的许可证?

我不知道你们这样年纪的人知道这种事
I didn'tthink people your age knew about that kind of stuff.

845
0:56:51,490 -->0:56:54,460
你以为我不懂这种事
I believe I knowmore about this than you think.

846
0:56:56,000 -->0:56:58,680
好  因为我不知道该怎么办
Good, because I Just don't know what to do here.

847

1:05:06,860 -->1:05:10,920
我想我无法克制了它完全不听我的使唤
I don'tthink I can talkthis one down, man. It's got a mind of its own.

988
1:05:11,060 -->1:05:13,540
不要跑在我后面  好吗?
Hey, donot run behind me. Okay?

989
1:05:14,190 -->1:05:19,020
 -我们以为它是... -甜心不用道歉
-It's...It's Just that we thought that it was... -Honey, don't apologize.

990
1:05:19,020 -->1:05:21,030
你们跟我们一起跑
Yeah, you guys are running with us.

991
1:05:21,200 -->1:05:25,130
哇!  这将是有史以来  最棒的一英里裸奔!
Oh, man!This isgoing tobe the best Naked Mile ever!

992
1:05:25,460 -->1:05:27,020
晚安...
Good evening...

993
1:05:30,540 -->1:05:31,570
那是谁?
Who is that guy?

994
1:05:31,570 -->1:05:35,180
那是人见人怕的诺尔李文斯汀
That isbig, badNoah Levenstein.

995
1:05:36,080 -->1:05:39,980
这个校园所出过最疯狂的狗杂种
The craziest bastard thiscampus has ever known.

996
1:05:40,050 -->1:05:41,990
我的错我的错  欢迎参加一英里裸奔
My bad.My bad. welcome to the Naked Mile.

997
1:05:47,120 -->1:05:49,640
对  我在许久前开始举行这个比赛...
Yes, youknow, when I started this race many, many...

998
1:05:49,710 -->1:05:51,620
妈的  他在60年代就开始举行这个活动
Christ,he started this whole thing back in the 60's.

999
1:05:51,700 -->1:05:54,760
当时只是消极的抗议
...manyyears ago. It wasjust... Just a passive protest.

1000
1:05:54,990 -->1:05:58,950
可说只是向当局表达不满而已
Just a way to stick it to the man, so to speak.

1001
1:06:00,340 -->1:06:02,060
好  好
Right on. Right on.

1002
1:06:02,510 -->1:06:06,290
但是多年下来  政治意味变淡了
But overthe years, it'sbecome somewhat less political.

1003
1:06:06,450 -->1:06:09,610
到了现在
And now,it's just

1004
1:06:09,680 -->1:06:12,200
只变成罗马式的性狂欢
some sort of Roman orgy,

1005
1:06:12,460 -->1:06:15,150
我觉得也没什么不好
which I'm down with, by the way.

1006
1:06:15,540 -->1:06:17,670
但是请大家记得
But let's keep one thingin mind.

1007
1:06:17,970 -->1:06:22,190
这是向全世界展现你们的青春活力
This isabout showing theworld your youthfuI exuberance,

1008
1:06:22,450 -->1:06:25,710
以及你们对于高等教育  全心全意的承诺
and yourunabashed commitment to higher learning,

1009
1:06:25,840 -->1:06:28,170
并顺便享乐
and having fun while you're doing it,

1010
1:06:28,210 -->1:06:32,070
裸体的意义也就在于此
which iswhere the nakedpart comes in.

1011
1:06:32,140 -->1:06:33,700
好!
Yeah!

1012
1:06:37,520 -->1:06:40,460
当然  全裸
And being completely naked is, of course,

1013
1:06:40,530 -->1:06:42,500
是非常自然的
a perfectly natural thing.

1014
1:06:42,670 -->1:06:46,190
一个人对于身体各部位
There'snot one part of one's body

1015
1:06:46,260 -->1:06:48,390
都不应感到羞耻
one should be ashamed of,

1016
1:06:48,500 -->1:06:52,940
无论是阴部
be it one's pubicregion

1017
1:06:53,140 -->1:06:55,340
还是
or one'sbreasts,

1018
1:06:55,600 -->1:06:57,740
年轻女孩子  以及一两个
as in the case with you young ladies...

1019
1:07:02,100 -->1:07:05,360
男孩子的乳房  都是一样
...and acouple of you young men.

1020
1:07:07,760 -->1:07:10,920
但是你们都应该为了能展现自我
But youshould all just revel in the glory of being seen

1021
1:07:11,150 -->1:07:13,160
而感到欣喜
as the people youare.

1022
1:07:13,390 -->1:07:14,850
此外  如果任何人有...
Incidentally, ifanyone has anything...

1023
1:07:14,930 -->1:07:16,820
少废话开始吧!
Come on,let's fucking dothis!

1024
1:07:20,210 -->1:07:22,060
我附议年轻人

1:07:26,580 -->1:07:28,170

1031
1:08:22,400 -->1:08:26,590
我在一群咪咪中  我的G丸拖着地
I'm adrift in a sea of boobies, and my balls are scraping the pavement.

1032
1:08:26,660 -->1:08:28,150
小心
Oh, heads up.

1033
1:08:31,360 -->1:08:33,250
瞧瞧  是这群小男人们
Look, it's the boner guys!

1034

1037
1:09:21,440 -->1:09:23,540
嘿  裸体的人才可以!

1040
1:10:10,720 -->1:10:14,020
我站在终点线  这是个非常荣耀但怪异的传统
I'm standing at the finish line of a very proud, but strange tradition

1041
1:10:14,080 -->1:10:15,260
叫做一英里裸奔

1042
1:10:15,330 -->1:10:16,670
每年在考试过后
Ever year after exams

1043
1:10:16,740 -->1:10:19,040
数百名学生裸体
hundredsof students runa mile through campus

1044
1:10:19,100 -->1:10:21,050
奔跑一英里穿过校园
in nothing more than their birthday suits.

1045
1:10:25,150 -->1:10:28,090
这真是棒极了!

有人说这是猥亵的行为

1054
1:11:02,400 -->1:11:05,150
但是学生说这只是发泄紧张情绪的好方法

1:11:10,400 -->1:11:11,960
也可找到爱情
