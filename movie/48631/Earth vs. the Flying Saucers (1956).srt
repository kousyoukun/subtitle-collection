1
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:08,288
Since biblical times, man has seen
strange manifestations in the sky...

2
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:14,405
...and speculated on the possibilities
of visitors from another world.

3
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,603
Today, from the skies of California,
the fields of Kansas...

4
00:00:34,849 --> 00:00:39,479
...the rice paddies of the Orient,
the air lanes of the world...

5
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:44,399
...come persistent reports of UFOs,
Unidentified Flying Objects...

6
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:48,602
...which we have come to know
as flying saucers.

7
00:00:56,249 --> 00:01:01,482
In Dayton, Ohio, the Air Intelligence
gathers data from all over the globe.

8
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:06,683
97%of the objects prove to be
of natural origin, but 3%are unknown.

9
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:12,168
The Air Force is aware of the belief
that they could be flying saucers.

10
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:15,247
While the evidence isn't conclusive...

11
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:20,728
...the probing of information
about UFOs continues unceasingly.

12
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:28,769
As a result, the Hemispheric Defence
in Colorado Springs issued an order.:

13
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,642
All military installations
will fire...

14
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:34,966
...at any flying objects
not identifiable.

15
00:01:35,169 --> 00:01:39,720
But the military wondered if their
scientific know-how and weapons...

16
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:46,164
...would be effective in any battle
of the Earth vs. the flying saucers.

17
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:55,963
July 16. To Internal Security
Commission. Re: Sky Hook.

18
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,128
Progress report f rom project director
Dr. Russell A. Marvin...

19
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,880
And Mrs. Dr. Marvin, without
whose inspiration and criticism...

20
00:03:05,089 --> 00:03:07,364
...this report couldn't be written.

21
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,801
Married two hours and already
claiming community property.

22
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:18,967
We're married.
You needn't sneak up on me.

23
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:21,285
You have eyes behind your head.

24
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,162
- It's not safe when driving.
- But pretty.

25
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,486
Aren't intellectual giants
backwards and shy?

26
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:31,045
My third grade teacher
said I was a quick study.

27
00:03:31,249 --> 00:03:35,003
You're starting something
you won't be able to finish.

28
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:42,202
Today, I've got a hot date
with a three-stage rocket.

29
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,802
Now, please, no interruptions.

30
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:55,682
Because of recent
scientific advances...

31
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,245
...it is now possible to realize
an ancient dream:

32
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,441
The exploration of outer space.

33
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,648
To prepare for this stride forward,
we are assembling data...

34
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,559
...on conditions at atmospheric levels
beyond those hitherto explored.

35
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,559
To collect this data, unmanned
observation posts are being sent up...

36
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,002
...in multiple-stage rockets, hundreds
of miles above the Earth's surface.

37
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,003
There, swinging in endless orbits
around our planet...

38
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:30,804
...will be 12 tiny man-made
satellites, or moons.

39
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:35,167
They will report by radio
the primary information needed...

40
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:38,202
...to prepare for our ascent
into space.

41
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:42,482
The effects of gravitational loss,
showers of meteoric dust...

42
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,568
...the fierce heat of the sun,
the cosmic radiation.

43
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:49,806
All will be studied and analysed.

44
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,404
Presently, we have launched
10 artificial satellites...

45
00:04:54,609 --> 00:04:57,601
...or birds, as we call them. We...

46
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:04,197
- Do you hear something?
- Hear what?

47
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:07,004
- I don't hear any...
- Shh, listen.

48
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:24,523
Pull over.

49
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:58,398
Russ, it was a saucer?

50
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,005
A flying saucer?

51
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:04,804
Well, we saw what appeared
to be a flying saucer.

52
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:07,125
That's all we can say.

53
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:10,799
We saw it. We heard it, both of us.

54
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:13,318
What more do we need to know?

55
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:18,205
Well, we have to have time to think,
to evaluate this...

56
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:20,804
...before we sound off.

57
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,398
Let... Let me have a light.

58
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,287
Of course, it wasn't a saucer at all.

59
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:37,208
I just shake like this all the time.

60
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:08,882
Carol, I want you to transcribe
these notes for my report.

61
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:13,321
- Yes, boss.
- But there's one little thing first.

62
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:17,408
Now that you're married,
the first thing you must learn...

63
00:07:17,609 --> 00:07:21,682
...is no more passes at the
secretaries during business hours.

64
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:23,561
All right.

65
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,600
or birds, as we call them. We...

66
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,802
Russ.

67
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,203
The saucer sound.

68
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:44,400
It's on the tape.

69
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,803
You forgot to turn it off.

70
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,200
I remember now.
I turned it off afterwards.

71
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,758
Well, that's one piece
of concrete evidence.

72
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,803
Rocket number 11
will be launched in 20 minutes.

73
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,406
We'll leave it for now. We've just
got time to get to the bunker.

74
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:27,328
Gen. Hanley reporting.
Make it fast, I'm in a hurry.

75
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:30,282
Nobody allowed in.
A rocket's taking off.

76
00:08:30,489 --> 00:08:34,801
That's what I want to stop.
Let me speak to Dr. Russell Marvin.

77
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:41,244
West Gate to Bunker Number Two.

78
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:43,201
Dr. Marvin.

79
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:46,681
Marvin speaking.

80
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:50,086
This is the West Gate.
Gen. Hanley wants you.

81
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,247
Put him on. Carol, it's your father.

82
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,122
- Calling f rom Panama?
- No, right here.

83
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,206
- Hello, Russ?
- Hello.

84
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:01,287
Welcome home.
What's the news f rom Panama?

85
00:09:01,489 --> 00:09:05,721
It's bad. Listen to what I found
before you send another rocket.

86
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:07,408
Can you put it off?

87
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:11,284
I can't, we're tied to
a schedule of launchings.

88
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:14,401
Wait, there's something else
I wanted...

89
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:18,397
Just a minute. It's your privilege.

90
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,403
Hi, Dad.

91
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:23,407
- What is it?
- I wanted to hear your voice...

92
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,884
...and tell you we got married.

93
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,525
- Married?
- Forgive us for not letting you know.

94
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:36,361
I've gotta hang up.
Let's have dinner tonight. Can you?

95
00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:39,003
Don't forget. Bye.

96
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,923
Fourteen, thirteen, twelve...

97
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,920
...eleven, ten, nine,
eight, seven, six...

98
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:58,368
...five, four, three, two, one.

99
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:13,127
I know how the designer feels
hearing this...

100
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,800
...but Sky Hook hasn't worked
like the Defence Department had hoped.

101
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:20,648
How many birds have you
sent up so far?

102
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:22,646
Eleven, counting today's.

103
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:27,127
- How many are you in contact with now?
- Just one. Today's.

104
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,766
We haven't been able to track them
visually, but we'll fix that.

105
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:36,008
- Don't be too sure.
- We can find them if they're up there.

106
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:40,202
What I'm telling you is that
they're no longer up there.

107
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:42,604
A meteorite didn't hit Panama.

108
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,087
It was the burned remains of
Number Seven. I made sure myself.

109
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:51,168
- What?
- And Intelligence has reports...

110
00:10:51,369 --> 00:10:54,008
...that One and Three
fell over Af rica...

111
00:10:54,209 --> 00:10:59,124
...Number Five around the North Pole,
and Nine and Ten along the Andes.

112
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:03,686
The rest can be presumed
to have been lost someplace at sea.

113
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:07,723
- What happens to them?
- Apparently they blow up in space.

114
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:10,966
Why? There's nothing explosive
in them.

115
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:16,766
When a rocket's blasted off, it should
circle the Earth for a long time.

116
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,200
- That is, unless...
- Russ? Dad?

117
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:22,281
Unless what?

118
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:26,323
Unless something shoots them down
after we launch them.

119
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:31,922
- No gun in the world shoots that high.
- No, of course not.

120
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:34,802
Bring spoons for your coffee.

121
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,168
My special barbecue.

122
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,486
It's for not telling you
about our marriage.

123
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,728
- It was sudden for us too.
- What? I chased him for a year.

124
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:54,126
I don't need to tell you two
how pleased I am.

125
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,686
I'm glad of that. I wouldn't
like it very much if you weren't.

126
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,407
Thank you.

127
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,164
Russ, what were you
driving at back there...

128
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:12,408
...about something shooting down
one of the satellites?

129
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:16,558
General, we saw a strange thing
this afternoon.

130
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,728
We saw what appeared to be
a flying saucer.

131
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:24,080
- A flying saucer?
- It nearly ran into us.

132
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:26,041
Are you sure of it?

133
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:31,277
We felt the atmospheric disturbances
that may affect other observers...

134
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:35,084
...but there's a qualitative
difference for scientists.

135
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:39,760
We have one piece of evidence:
a recording of the sounds it made.

136
00:12:39,969 --> 00:12:43,882
The tape is in the lab.
I'd like you to hear it tomorrow.

137
00:12:44,089 --> 00:12:45,920
- You both saw this?
- Yes.

138
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,600
Ex cuse me.

139
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,642
From Captain Holoway, sir.
Will you sign here, please?

140
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:05,439
- Who's Holoway?
- He's on monitor duty this evening.

141
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:18,998
- They lost contact with Number Eleven.
- Russ, I'm sorry.

142
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:23,680
- Is it in range of our receivers?
- If it hasn't been knocked down.

143
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,208
Look.

144
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:30,598
- What are those lights?
- Pilots call them foo lights.

145
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:36,327
St. Elmo's Fire, in ancient times. The
superstitious regard them as omens.

146
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,204
All science knows is that
they're electric particles...

147
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:43,719
...agitated by moving air,
like the aurora borealis.

148
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:48,480
There have been so many near
the project, we take them for granted.

149
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:52,648
Eleven should be visible
on its second lap around the world.

150
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:54,680
Look, there it is.

151
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,644
- Was that it?
- Yes.

152
00:14:01,849 --> 00:14:05,080
Surely you won't launch
Number Twelve tomorrow?

153
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,642
- I have to.
- Why?

154
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:10,239
With a television pickup,
cameras and microphone.

155
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,408
This time I'll find out
what's happening up there and why.

156
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:16,804
Let's finish our dinner.

157
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,319
Checking TV pickup.
Getting a good image?

158
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,483
Fine.

159
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:41,809
- TV's okay. I'll be down soon.
- Tell them to hurry it up.

160
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:49,408
Do you notice anything different
since you were here last?

161
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,288
- Soundproofing?
- Right.

162
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:56,845
You can fire a cannon outside
and not hear it.

163
00:14:57,049 --> 00:14:59,244
Number Twelve okay for takeoff.

164
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:03,158
As an old rocket man,
I prefer watching f rom the ground.

165
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:05,803
Dr. Marvin. Dr. Marvin.

166
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,801
Marvin here.

167
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:14,167
You ready for a siege?

168
00:15:14,369 --> 00:15:18,760
Russ and I are monitoring this one.
For days, if necessary.

169
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:23,167
Soundproof privacy and the last word
in scientific solitude.

170
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,441
- Happy honeymoon, darling.
- Thanks, Dad.

171
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,402
Prepare rocket for launching.

172
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:37,804
Prepare rocket for launching.

173
00:15:41,849 --> 00:15:45,159
Rocket Number Twelve launching
in five minutes.

174
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,047
Four minutes to zero.

175
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,199
- Take it up at zero, Major Kimberly.
- Okay.

176
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,887
Stand by.

177
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:14,559
Observation Tower A, come in.

178
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:16,885
Evans, Radar to Tower A.

179
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:22,798
- Observation Tower A, Sergeant Nash.
- UFO due west, approaching fast.

180
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:27,480
- What does it look like?
- Can't tell. I'll call when I see it.

181
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:30,840
- Do that.
- As you were, sergeant.

182
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,804
Unidentified flying object reported
due west. Probably a buzzard.

183
00:16:36,849 --> 00:16:40,808
Sergeant Nash, Observation Tower A.
What?

184
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:45,325
Forget it, Walters,
this is no time for gags.

185
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:47,804
It's two minutes to zero.

186
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:52,524
Sentry at West Gate
has spotted a flying saucer.

187
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,600
Evans, Radar to Tower A.

188
00:16:56,169 --> 00:16:57,568
Tower A, Nash.

189
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,479
I got a better reading.
That UFO is over the west sentry post.

190
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,602
- It look like a flying saucer, Evans?
- Yes, it does.

191
00:17:10,649 --> 00:17:12,560
Sky Hook to approaching object.

192
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:16,807
What is it?

193
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:19,807
I wouldn't know.

194
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,126
Connect me to Dr. Marvin.

195
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:35,607
The line is dead.

196
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:46,601
It can't, general.

197
00:17:58,609 --> 00:17:59,962
It's landing.

198
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:37,885
Battery, prepare to fire.

199
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:41,922
Fire!

200
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:53,400
They've set up an electronic screen.
The artillery won't penetrate.

201
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:31,601
Lines are out.

202
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,598
Abandon all firing positions.

203
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:41,246
Mike's gone dead.

204
00:19:41,689 --> 00:19:43,407
Try the phone.

205
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:55,204
The operator doesn't answer.

206
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:57,808
Look.

207
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,999
- What's happening?
- I don't know. I...

208
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm scared, Russ.

209
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:08,207
They'll... They'll dig us out.

210
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:02,639
Where am I? What...?

211
00:22:02,849 --> 00:22:08,003
We are speaking to you through the
translating device above your head.

212
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:17,321
Can you understand us?

213
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:20,965
Yes, and I hope you can understand me.

214
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:27,963
Whoever, whatever you are, you'll
regret what you did at the project.

215
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:32,242
Perhaps you can explain why,
after contacting Dr. Marvin...

216
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,400
...we were met with violence.

217
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:39,399
- You've contacted Dr. Marvin?
- We spoke to him.

218
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:46,679
All he heard was meaningless sounds.
The same kind of sounds I just heard.

219
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:52,805
We had hoped the time differential
between us would have been adjusted.

220
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:56,647
I don't understand.

221
00:22:56,849 --> 00:23:01,559
Evidently, you do not realize you are
in an interstellar conveyance.

222
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:06,047
You are already outside
the atmosphere of your own planet.

223
00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:09,685
As a prisoner,
all I am required to tell you...

224
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,325
...is that I am General John Hanley
of the U. S. Army.

225
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:39,047
These are all the facts leading up to
the explosion at Operation Sky Hook.

226
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:44,649
To the best of our knowledge, my wife
and I are the only ones left alive...

227
00:23:44,849 --> 00:23:48,398
...since we have not seen
or heard anyone for hours.

228
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,408
The air is becoming toxic.

229
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,805
In the event of our death...

230
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,799
...this report, with the recording
of the saucer sounds on this tape...

231
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,399
...constitute all the data we have.

232
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:07,479
The batteries are failing. The
recorder is not running up to speed.

233
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:10,249
This is Dr. Russell A. Marvin.

234
00:24:24,209 --> 00:24:26,723
Russ? Where are you?

235
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:30,808
It's all right.
The gas generator stopped, that's all.

236
00:24:31,449 --> 00:24:34,998
Please come close.
I'm af raid of the darkness.

237
00:24:35,689 --> 00:24:40,399
- Dr. Russell Marvin.
- The tape.

238
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:45,683
It is very urgent that we meet.

239
00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:49,086
We will appear tomorrow...

240
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,725
...at Operation Sky Hook...

241
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:58,681
...when your sun is ex actly...

242
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:03,405
...over your local...

243
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,448
That's the sound of the saucer
on tape.

244
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:15,882
The message was sent at accelerated
speed so it sounded like gibberish.

245
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:21,209
When the batteries died, the tape
slowed down and the voice got clear.

246
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:27,607
If I'd only figured it out before...

247
00:25:28,089 --> 00:25:31,604
...maybe we wouldn't have been
trapped down here.

248
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:47,157
What had taken hundreds of lives and
levelled a facility worth millions?

249
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:49,929
The aroused public
demanded an answer.

250
00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:54,247
The government dedicated
all of its branches to finding it.

251
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,727
But when the Marvins were rescued,
the answer was to be found...

252
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:03,764
...in the experience of the only two
survivors and a tape recording...

253
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:07,598
...they carried to Washington, D. C.
and the Pentagon.

254
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,406
Operation Sky Hook.

255
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:28,921
The meaning is clear: they proposed
landing at the project...

256
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,007
...on the day of the disaster
for a meeting.

257
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,688
If I couldn't attend...

258
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:38,445
...a shortwave message was to be sent
on a specific wavelength.

259
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:43,803
- Does anyone want it played again?
- You've heard it a dozen times.

260
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:46,967
For three days,
my wife and I have answered...

261
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:52,163
...to every commission and committee
in D. C. It's time we did something.

262
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:58,285
This tape doesn't prove your so-called
"flying saucer" destroyed Sky Hook.

263
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,683
I grant you that.

264
00:26:59,889 --> 00:27:03,677
The voice and instructions
could have come f rom anywhere.

265
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,599
- Anyone have a better idea?
- I accept Dr. Marvin's conclusion...

266
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:13,200
- ...about the events being connected.
- All right, so do I.

267
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:18,200
Then let me contact them, meet them,
find out what this is about.

268
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:23,437
If faced with a hostile power, only
the cabinet can decide to meet them.

269
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:27,608
I hope that while we wait,
another disaster doesn't occur.

270
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:30,369
We're pressing
for the earliest action.

271
00:27:30,569 --> 00:27:34,687
The state and defence secretaries
are returning to the U. S.

272
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:39,405
If I met with them in the meantime,
the only risk would be to me.

273
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:43,443
I feel responsible for what happened.
I was in charge.

274
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:46,800
Hundreds of lives were lost,
my wife's father...

275
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:50,160
If I had the authority,
I'd grant it to you.

276
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:56,558
But I promise we'll recommend that you
be authorized to make radio contact...

277
00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:58,999
...and meet with whoever they are.

278
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:03,643
- Are we through for the night?
- Yes...

279
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,205
...but we're gonna ask you
to remain at your hotel.

280
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,161
- You mean I'm under detention?
- You may be needed at any time.

281
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:15,406
Major Huglin is assigned
as your liaison.

282
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,842
- Good night.
- Good night.

283
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:25,440
I don't like this watchdog routine
any better than you do.

284
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm under orders, I have a job to do.
We're both on the same side.

285
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:34,163
- I'm sorry. I'm just tired and worried.
- I know.

286
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:37,361
You heard both sides.
Who do you agree with?

287
00:28:37,569 --> 00:28:41,528
I agree with you about the urgency,
but they're right too.

288
00:28:41,729 --> 00:28:47,998
They have a chain of command, and this
is too big to allow for mistakes.

289
00:29:57,489 --> 00:30:03,883
Russell Marvin calling
on 225.6 megacycles. Over.

290
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:14,159
Dr. Russell Marvin calling on 225.6
megacycles as per instructions.

291
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:17,839
Are you listening?
If you hear me, please reply.

292
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:21,007
I am tuned in
on the same wavelength. Over.

293
00:30:21,209 --> 00:30:26,203
We hear you, Dr. Marvin, and we
understand you. Do you understand us?

294
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,402
Yes.

295
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,763
Who are you?

296
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:36,839
Listen.: it is now 9.:30 a. m.
Earth time, Greenwich Meridian Time.

297
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:42,203
We will be waiting at 11.:00 a. m.
at the shore of the Chesapeake Bay...

298
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:45,287
...where the North Beach Road
reaches the sea.

299
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:48,925
Do not raise an alarm
and keep this appointment.

300
00:30:49,409 --> 00:30:54,563
I can't keep the appointment. I'm under
orders. We can meet in a few days.

301
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,839
Do you hear me? Over.

302
00:30:57,049 --> 00:30:58,960
- Russ?
- Hello, hello.

303
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:02,605
Dr. Russell Marvin calling
on 225.6 megacycles.

304
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:06,199
Do you hear me?
Please come in. Over.

305
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:15,765
11:00 Greenwich time. It'll be
6:00 here. I can just make it.

306
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:18,403
You can't go. You're under orders.

307
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:21,919
I didn't arrange this.
I just asked them to wait.

308
00:31:22,129 --> 00:31:23,767
Who ordered that radio?

309
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,767
I did. I was hoping
they'd let me use it.

310
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,722
You can't go. I've already lost Dad.

311
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,605
- You shouldn't have called them.
- Maybe, or maybe not.

312
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,119
But it's started.
I've gotta go through with it.

313
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:43,084
But it's not your job alone.
Call someone! Call Major Huglin!

314
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,847
Room 312, Major Huglin.
Hurry, please.

315
00:31:57,169 --> 00:31:58,887
Hello?

316
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,643
Yes. Yes.

317
00:32:01,849 --> 00:32:03,282
Thanks.

318
00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:08,081
Well, call the garage.
Tell them not to give him a car.

319
00:32:08,289 --> 00:32:13,886
Tell them he's sick, out of his mind.
I'll be right down to take care of it.

320
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:22,285
- Sure thing, Mrs. Marvin.
- Frank, may I have my car please?

321
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:28,687
I can't. I was talking to your wife
on the phone and she said that I...

322
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:38,960
But, Dr. Marvin,
I can't let you have the car.

323
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:43,287
- Get out of my way.
- Please, I don't want to lose my job...

324
00:33:07,769 --> 00:33:11,603
There he is. See if you
can get him on the radio.

325
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:17,084
Hello, Russ. This is Carol.
Russ, come in.

326
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,680
He won't answer me.

327
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,641
Wait for us, Russ.

328
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:29,080
Major Huglin and I wanna talk to you.

329
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,883
Russ, please come back with us.

330
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:58,884
I'm sorry, but I have to do my job.
Let's go back.

331
00:34:59,089 --> 00:35:00,283
Please come in...

332
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,923
- Let's get out of here.
- No, wait.

333
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:06,280
...with your friends, Dr. Marvin.

334
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:25,887
- I'm coming with you.
- Please come in. All of you.

335
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:30,287
- I'm gonna phone headquarters.
- You'd better do as they say.

336
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:24,399
- We're thousands of miles f rom Earth.
- And in a matter of seconds.

337
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:30,878
You are many miles from your planets,
but not in a matter of seconds.

338
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,086
Listen to your watch, Dr. Marvin.

339
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:47,239
It's stopped.
It's supposed to be antimagnetic.

340
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:52,125
We generate a magnetic field stronger
than gravity on your Earth.

341
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:57,608
This is how we move through space.
We have adjusted the magnetic field...

342
00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:03,122
...to compensate for the normal loss
of gravity and atmospheric pressure.

343
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:08,483
But your watch hasn't stopped.
Feel your pulse.

344
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:13,086
I haven't any.

345
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:16,563
Neither have I.

346
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:21,965
We operate in a different time
reference. This is happening...

347
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:26,447
...between the ticks of your watch
or the beats of your heart.

348
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:31,200
That's why we couldn't decipher
your message until it was too late.

349
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:35,687
It made it necessary for us
to defend ourselves at Sky Hook.

350
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:39,564
Then you shot down
our 11 rockets. Why?

351
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:45,366
At that time, we did not know they
were only primitive observation posts.

352
00:37:45,569 --> 00:37:49,084
We thought they were weapons
directed against us.

353
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,167
Who are you? Where are you f rom?

354
00:37:52,529 --> 00:37:56,727
Because of your leadership
in exploring outer space...

355
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:59,204
...we felt you could
best understand...

356
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:03,561
...that we are the survivors
of a disintegrated solar system.

357
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:08,524
At this moment, the remainder
of our fleet is circling your globe.

358
00:38:24,129 --> 00:38:27,405
They await a signal
to tell them where to land.

359
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:29,327
What do you want with me?

360
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:33,761
Arrange for your world leaders
to confer with us in Washington.

361
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:36,437
They may not listen.
I'm a scientist.

362
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:40,881
We will show you how important it is
to convince your leaders.

363
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:43,882
In an instant of your time,
we travel...

364
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,082
...from beyond your moon
to the surface of your Earth.

365
00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:08,163
There were 300 men on that ship.

366
00:39:10,729 --> 00:39:14,768
Speed, maneuverability and force.

367
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:18,041
With a weapon like that,
why not take over?

368
00:39:18,249 --> 00:39:22,401
To do that would cause worldwide
panic. Despite our power...

369
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:28,161
...we few would be busy indefinitely,
suppressing a hostile population.

370
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:31,918
In the end, we'd be masters
of a wrecked planet.

371
00:39:32,129 --> 00:39:34,484
Think you'll win without a fight?

372
00:39:34,689 --> 00:39:38,477
We felt it best to meet with you
to avoid fighting.

373
00:39:38,729 --> 00:39:43,564
- We've made agreements on Earth before.
- How do you know so much of us?

374
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:47,125
We have the means
of accumulating information.

375
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:52,119
If you wish to convince yourself
of our detailed knowledge, test us.

376
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,081
Any question.

377
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:57,687
What's the size
of the U. S. Armed Forces?

378
00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:02,288
It is approximately 3.5 million men.

379
00:40:03,489 --> 00:40:07,368
What team has won
the most World Series?

380
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:10,882
The New York Yankees.

381
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:15,328
- Who was the first U. S. president?
- Washington.

382
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:17,201
I know that voice.

383
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:22,640
- Who are you?
- John Hanley.

384
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:28,082
My father.
What have you done to him?

385
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:33,563
You have been addressing General
Hanley's mind, not General Hanley.

386
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,361
Look behind you.

387
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:40,923
Dad.

388
00:40:41,129 --> 00:40:44,121
He won't recognize you.
He's been subjected...

389
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:48,447
...to a machine we call
an Infinitely Index ed Memory Bank.

390
00:40:48,649 --> 00:40:53,165
We have transferred all knowledge
from his brain to our machine.

391
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:59,319
Thus, we have available and readily
accessible his total experience.

392
00:40:59,529 --> 00:41:04,398
We can do this to as many as we like
and learn whatever we must know.

393
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:08,398
- Stop it, please, stop it.
- Put that gun away.

394
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:14,481
Don't look at that.

395
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:28,282
This is the start of the process
we use to read the brain...

396
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,447
...for the Infinitely
Index ed Memory Bank.

397
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:38,969
What have you done with my father?

398
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:44,038
We will return him to you eventually,
and the police officer too.

399
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:47,286
Will you arrange a conference for us?

400
00:41:47,489 --> 00:41:50,925
We'll tell the authorities.
That's all we can do.

401
00:41:51,129 --> 00:41:55,327
- You're helping these monsters?
- It may take months to set up.

402
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:59,442
You will have two lunar days,
or 56 days Earth time.

403
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:02,966
- Let them kill us and be done with it.
- Please.

404
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:06,320
If no one believes me,
I can't be responsible.

405
00:42:06,529 --> 00:42:08,997
When you tell
of the sunken destroyer...

406
00:42:09,209 --> 00:42:12,326
...refer to latitude
30 degrees, 20 minutes...

407
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:15,965
...longitude 45 degrees, 15 minutes.

408
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:18,285
They will believe you.

409
00:42:28,169 --> 00:42:33,118
Maybe we were hysterical or hypnotized
and never saw what they did...

410
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:39,040
...to General Hanley or the policeman.
How do you explain the destroyer?

411
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:42,719
The Atlantic fleet lost contact
with a vessel...

412
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:45,966
...but there is no confirmation
of a sinking.

413
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:50,208
Your contacting the saucer
violated our instructions.

414
00:42:50,409 --> 00:42:54,482
This itself may have placed
the entire country in jeopardy.

415
00:42:54,689 --> 00:42:57,601
Assuming your story is verified...

416
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:02,929
...are you proposing we meet with the
creatures and yield to their demands?

417
00:43:03,129 --> 00:43:08,522
Why Washington? If they want to parlay
with the whole world, why meet there?

418
00:43:08,729 --> 00:43:12,324
They're realists.
D. C. is a political power centre.

419
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:16,841
Would our atomic and hydrogen weapons
work against the saucers?

420
00:43:17,049 --> 00:43:19,517
I'd like to answer that question.

421
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,960
Atomics might work,
if we could deliver them.

422
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:27,321
But using nuclear power when they land
would destroy cities.

423
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:30,487
We don't know
if they're vulnerable or not.

424
00:43:32,489 --> 00:43:37,358
To answer you, Mr. Cassidy, I learned
a little of their operation.

425
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:42,802
And I've got an idea for a new weapon.
It's only a guess, of course.

426
00:43:43,009 --> 00:43:45,523
A new weapon in less than 56 days?

427
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:50,485
I have an idea for an ultrasonic gun.
With enough engineering help...

428
00:43:50,689 --> 00:43:55,001
...we could build a working model.
Maybe it will work, maybe not.

429
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:58,360
Meanwhile, you'll work
on every other defence.

430
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:02,084
We must use every conceivable
weapon if they land.

431
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:04,086
Gentlemen, please.

432
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:09,079
"The destroyer Franklin Edison
was sunk at latitude 30 degrees...

433
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:13,487
...20 minutes, longitude 45 degrees,
15 minutes at 0600."

434
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:20,601
We are expected at the White House
in an hour for a decision...

435
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:23,482
...that will involve the entire world.

436
00:44:23,689 --> 00:44:27,523
Whatever the decision,
you'll be given every assistance.

437
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,368
I suggest you start
to work right away.

438
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,447
Major Huglin will get
whatever you require.

439
00:44:33,649 --> 00:44:35,082
Thank you.

440
00:44:51,569 --> 00:44:53,525
- Hello.
- Hi.

441
00:44:53,729 --> 00:44:55,128
How's it going?

442
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:59,880
Rather than turn electric impulses
into ultrahigh f requency sounds...

443
00:45:00,089 --> 00:45:02,728
- ...we nearly burned the place up.
- What?

444
00:45:04,209 --> 00:45:06,962
Let's try it out on the cement block.

445
00:45:20,649 --> 00:45:22,480
All the way.

446
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:30,839
There goes your generator.

447
00:45:31,049 --> 00:45:34,359
- But it worked, right?
- We know what hit Sky Hook.

448
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:35,763
- What?
- Sound.

449
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:40,087
Having two sons, I know noise
doesn't do a man much good...

450
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:42,405
...but burn him up and his house?

451
00:45:42,609 --> 00:45:47,046
The sound I want is of a higher
f requency than we've ever made.

452
00:45:47,249 --> 00:45:51,561
- Then we've got the weapon?
- No, I'm af raid not.

453
00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:57,366
With the best circuits available, all
we've done is pulverize some cement.

454
00:45:57,569 --> 00:46:02,165
The theory is beautif ul. We don't have
the tools to make it work.

455
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:05,600
Maybe in 10 years, 5, even 2.

456
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:08,283
- How many days left?
-27.

457
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:12,562
Russ, remember that report
f rom Dr. Patek in New Delhi?

458
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:16,808
He suggested a different approach.
Instead of duplicating...

459
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:22,328
...their ultrasonic devices,
we interrupt their magnetic field...

460
00:46:22,569 --> 00:46:27,245
...with a highly intermittent induced
electrical field. Suppose we...

461
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:33,046
Right! Cut the ultrasonic wavelength
into the circuit and knock them down.

462
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:36,047
- Not so fast, Russ.
- It can work.

463
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:42,279
Major, we'll need the largest portable
generator that Schenectady makes.

464
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:45,720
From all parts of the globe...

465
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:50,639
...came every facility and scientific
help world governments could give.

466
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:55,206
Dr. Marvin and staff assembled
these materials in a secret lab...

467
00:46:55,409 --> 00:47:00,278
...where they translated a short
experience in an outer space craft...

468
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:03,242
...into a formula, then plans...

469
00:47:03,449 --> 00:47:06,885
...and, finally,
a functioning reality.

470
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:12,288
It's only a hollow steel ball, but
for our purposes it's a flying saucer.

471
00:47:13,529 --> 00:47:16,282
You can start up the generator now.

472
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:29,883
- The magnet does that?
- The magnetic attraction above...

473
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,683
...counteracts the pull
of gravity below.

474
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,324
- It was your idea. Try it first.
- My idea? Nonsense.

475
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:46,120
It's as much yours, Dr. Patek's
and many more scientists worldwide.

476
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:47,682
Come on.

477
00:48:01,009 --> 00:48:03,204
- It works.
- It works fine.

478
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:06,128
Russ, look.

479
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:47,523
What was it?

480
00:48:47,729 --> 00:48:51,085
The same thing that's watched us
since the start.

481
00:48:51,289 --> 00:48:54,565
- Watched who?
- Russ and the rocket program.

482
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:58,762
I thought it was St. Elmo's Fire,
but I changed my mind.

483
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:02,484
The saucers sent it down
to learn what we're doing.

484
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:07,240
We have TV. They may have a different
device with the same purpose.

485
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:10,327
We'd better go to D. C.
before they drop in.

486
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:13,441
Major, help him load
that gun on the truck.

487
00:49:13,649 --> 00:49:17,278
Forget the files, professor.
I'll take the diagrams.

488
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:22,363
We'll be in Washington in an hour.

489
00:49:26,449 --> 00:49:28,758
I hope they haven't spotted us.

490
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,688
Let's pull away f rom the lab. Come on.

491
00:49:59,169 --> 00:50:04,687
If that saucer stays in firing range,
we'll give the gun its first real test.

492
00:50:16,649 --> 00:50:21,723
Saucer landing near Belmont Lab.
Huglin calling for aerial protection.

493
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:30,286
They're sending a bomber.
Let's get those diagrams and hurry on.

494
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:33,287
- I'll get them f rom Russ.
- I'll go with you.

495
00:50:34,809 --> 00:50:38,882
Fire up the generator.
We're gonna see if this gun works.

496
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:49,683
- What's the matter?
- I can't get this thing started.

497
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:54,365
They're looking for us.

498
00:51:09,049 --> 00:51:12,678
Getting you to D. C.
is more important than all else.

499
00:51:12,889 --> 00:51:14,083
Right.

500
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:18,077
If this machine works.
If not, it makes no difference.

501
00:51:42,049 --> 00:51:45,564
It works. If we just had
a little more power.

502
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:58,278
Let's go, please.
Before it's too late.

503
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:58,201
Keep the gun circling overhead
and the saucer will stay away.

504
00:53:47,729 --> 00:53:49,685
Russ, be caref ul.

505
00:53:50,209 --> 00:53:52,279
I think it's dead.

506
00:53:57,169 --> 00:53:59,478
It's light as a feather.

507
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:14,799
Humanoid, and ancient.

508
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:18,883
These suits are an electronic
and mechanical outer skin...

509
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,877
...to take the place of their
atrophied flesh and muscles.

510
00:54:33,209 --> 00:54:35,677
I must get this to a lab.

511
00:56:20,329 --> 00:56:23,082
Don't go out there.
Don't go out there.

512
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:59,279
Here are Dr. and Mrs. Marvin now.

513
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:03,923
- We've been waiting for you.
- Thanks.

514
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:08,566
This is Dr. Alberts. You know
General Edmunds, Admiral Enright.

515
00:57:08,769 --> 00:57:09,963
Certainly.

516
00:57:10,169 --> 00:57:13,002
Mrs. Marvin
is General Hanley's daughter.

517
00:57:13,209 --> 00:57:16,360
- His death was a loss to us all.
- Thank you.

518
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:20,039
- I see you've been busy.
- We've done a little work.

519
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:24,561
Let me show you. It didn't take
too long to break this down.

520
00:57:24,769 --> 00:57:28,239
These helmets have
a translating device in them.

521
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:33,487
Mrs. Marvin, would you say something
into the microphone?

522
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:40,287
The quality of mercy is not strained

523
00:57:45,369 --> 00:57:48,486
It droppeth as the gentle rain
From heaven

524
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:52,325
Shakespeare wouldn't like it.

525
00:57:53,769 --> 00:57:57,523
Professor Alberts said reading
the dictionary into it...

526
00:57:57,729 --> 00:58:00,163
...would translate their language.

527
00:58:00,369 --> 00:58:04,078
By translating their communications,
we decoded them.

528
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:08,567
The professor got the translator
that his university developed...

529
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:14,162
- ...and the results were startling.
- We've taped many of their messages.

530
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:19,722
- One message was a plan of attack.
- The rest were operational routine.

531
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:22,727
- I'll show you how it worked.
- Over here.

532
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:09,084
"We can expect trouble when Mercury
is in perihelion." When is that?

533
00:59:09,289 --> 00:59:14,204
Twice every three months. The
information is too vague to be of use.

534
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:18,804
- "The sun in con Polaris"?
- It's an orbital relation...

535
00:59:19,049 --> 00:59:23,679
...between the star Polaris and
the sun. We haven't figured it out.

536
00:59:23,889 --> 00:59:29,168
- The blanks are how they compute time.
- But the messages do involve the sun?

537
00:59:29,369 --> 00:59:32,088
Our observatories
are watching closely.

538
00:59:32,289 --> 00:59:37,044
For now, we're creating a stronger
interference machine.

539
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:40,446
Have you determined
the weapon's usef ul range?

540
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:45,200
There's a weakness. Our instruments
indicate the potential effect...

541
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:47,963
...drops off sharply after 1500 yards.

542
00:59:48,169 --> 00:59:50,808
We'll have to hope that that's enough.

543
00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:55,878
Maybe we'll be ready when they come.
Has anyone tried that helmet on?

544
00:59:56,089 --> 01:00:00,480
Yes, we have.
I think you'd be interested. Try it.

545
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:05,529
It weighs only a few grams.

546
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:08,408
- What's it made of?
- We don't know.

547
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:13,364
Solidified Electricity is the name
the Bureau of Standards gave it.

548
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:19,405
It resists everything we used on it,
including extreme temperatures.

549
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:26,439
- It makes me Superman, for one thing.
- Yes, we know.

550
01:00:27,289 --> 01:00:30,281
I have a peculiar range of vision.

551
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:41,560
I can also hear a man outside that
window discussing advanced biology.

552
01:00:41,769 --> 01:00:44,283
Carol, would you see if I'm right?

553
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:49,285
...when I kissed her,
she slapped me. I said:

554
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:53,283
" I didn't slap you
when you ordered a $4 steak."

555
01:00:54,529 --> 01:00:57,327
Just as we need glasses
and hearing aids...

556
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:02,125
...they must amplify their senses,
especially sight and hearing.

557
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:06,766
- Does that suggest anything to you?
- They have their weaknesses.

558
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:09,927
- When will we be ready?
- A couple of weeks.

559
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:16,204
People of Earth, attention.
People of Earth, attention.

560
01:01:16,489 --> 01:01:21,609
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.

561
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,080
- This is a voice speaking to you...
- Stop that.

562
01:01:25,289 --> 01:01:28,167
...from thousands of miles
beyond your planet.

563
01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:31,441
Look to your sun for a warning.

564
01:01:31,649 --> 01:01:35,005
Look to your sun for a warning.

565
01:01:35,209 --> 01:01:39,202
Following eruptions on your sun,
there will be eight days...

566
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:42,924
- ...of meteorological convulsions...
- Turn it down.

567
01:01:43,129 --> 01:01:46,246
They're arrogant
to announce their schedule.

568
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:49,009
They definitely plan to take over.

569
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:53,248
They can move so fast and hit
so hard, they'll flatten us.

570
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:56,839
They expect to terrify us
with a display of power.

571
01:01:57,049 --> 01:01:59,688
They're contemptuous of our defences.

572
01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:07,085
They'll sail into Washington
in broad daylight...

573
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,281
...and expect us to capitulate
when they land.

574
01:02:12,569 --> 01:02:18,326
People of Earth, attention.
People of Earth, attention.

575
01:02:19,289 --> 01:02:24,966
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.

576
01:02:25,169 --> 01:02:31,119
This is a voice speaking to you from
thousands of miles beyond your planet.

577
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:33,803
Look to your sun for a warning.

578
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,080
It's coming over everywhere.

579
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:40,644
Following eruptions on your sun...

580
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:46,128
...there will be eight days
of meteorological convulsions.

581
01:02:46,369 --> 01:02:49,725
They'll panic and immobilize
the whole country.

582
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:51,203
The whole world.

583
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:55,641
Let all nations be represented
in Washington to confer with us...

584
01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:19,167
People of Earth, attention.

585
01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:24,648
Across the world, communications
devices were jammed with the message.

586
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:30,003
The warning was dinned into Earth's
people unceasingly for 12 hours.

587
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:33,679
And after the twelfth hour, silence.

588
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:39,887
Then, a tremendous explosion
on the surface of the sun.

589
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:46,000
" Nine days."

590
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:50,487
That must be what the missing
words meant. I get the picture.

591
01:03:50,689 --> 01:03:54,523
If I need more information,
I'll call you back. Goodbye.

592
01:03:55,529 --> 01:04:00,967
That was Meteorology. As we know,
sunspots directly affect our weather.

593
01:04:01,169 --> 01:04:04,366
We can expect storms,
tidal waves, hurricanes.

594
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:07,037
- When?
- Starting now, for eight days.

595
01:04:07,249 --> 01:04:10,719
Just when we most need
communication and transport.

596
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:15,081
- We'll be working under bad conditions.
- What's the schedule?

597
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:20,158
You install the interference units.
We're already evacuating the city.

598
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:22,439
It's been decided we'll fight?

599
01:04:22,649 --> 01:04:27,086
When a threatening power lands,
we don't meet them with cookies.

600
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:32,204
Production expediting awaits me.
Further discussion won't solve much.

601
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:36,766
Before we break up, I remind you
that we have nine days left.

602
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:39,722
One of those days
is already half gone.

603
01:04:57,529 --> 01:04:59,759
What a nice going away present.

604
01:04:59,969 --> 01:05:03,405
You might call it that.
Is my bag packed?

605
01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:06,521
Mine too. What time do we leave?

606
01:05:06,729 --> 01:05:11,200
I leave now. I'm going to
Aberdeen for the interference project.

607
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:15,482
So that wasn't a hello kiss at all.
It was goodbye.

608
01:05:15,689 --> 01:05:17,088
For a little while.

609
01:05:17,289 --> 01:05:21,123
You have to leave town.
They're evacuating Washington.

610
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,798
- Where am I going?
- Palm Springs.

611
01:05:25,009 --> 01:05:27,921
Remember the place I told you about?

612
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,648
- We were going there together.
- I know.

613
01:05:32,609 --> 01:05:34,918
Your plane leaves tonight.

614
01:05:35,409 --> 01:05:37,923
Let me stay. Maybe I can help.

615
01:05:38,129 --> 01:05:42,919
There's nothing more you can do.
Here's your ticket.

616
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:46,725
You'll arrive before
the bad weather sets in.

617
01:05:47,129 --> 01:05:49,085
And I'll be there soon.

618
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:12,680
The first vital
communications to suffer...

619
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:16,598
...were the shipping lanes
and airways.

620
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:21,639
Then transport by rail and highway
ground to a halt.

621
01:06:22,409 --> 01:06:24,798
When phones and telegraphs failed...

622
01:06:25,009 --> 01:06:29,127
...and the radio networks bore
the burden alone, they succumbed...

623
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:34,323
...to interference originating from
an increasing disturbance in the sun.

624
01:06:34,529 --> 01:06:37,407
The world, crippled by these events...

625
01:06:37,609 --> 01:06:43,161
...waited for the first sign
of an invasion from outer space.

626
01:06:43,369 --> 01:06:46,839
Due to violent weather,
it wasn't till the ninth day...

627
01:06:47,049 --> 01:06:50,598
...that an evacuation
of Washington could be attempted.

628
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:54,006
Although the military
worked miracles...

629
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:58,521
...on the 10th day, more than 60%
of Washington's citizens...

630
01:06:58,729 --> 01:07:01,527
...were still
in the metropolitan area.

631
01:07:02,209 --> 01:07:04,928
- Take these to CIC.
- Yes, sir.

632
01:07:06,129 --> 01:07:07,642
Mrs. Marvin.

633
01:07:09,169 --> 01:07:11,808
I thought you were in Palm Springs.

634
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:15,797
The flights were cancelled.
Have you heard f rom Russ?

635
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:20,127
Almost nothing f rom Aberdeen.
Wires are down, radio jammed.

636
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:22,923
But I'm expecting a courier soon.

637
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:28,363
A red alert.

638
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:13,758
Saucer heading in
over the Atlantic, coming in fast.

639
01:08:56,409 --> 01:09:00,641
They're breaking through our defences.
Ground all aircraft.

640
01:09:00,889 --> 01:09:04,723
They'll be overhead any minute.
Better get to shelter.

641
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:10,525
Wait a moment, Mrs. Marvin.

642
01:09:12,089 --> 01:09:14,523
Convoys f rom Arberdeen are here.

643
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:18,517
- Your husband's is near the Pentagon.
- Thanks.

644
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:17,723
Marvin calling GHQ.
Saucer hit and down in the Potomac.

645
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:38,402
Keep it in your field
so it can't hit us.

646
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:30,322
- Fire at the saucer until it crashes.
- Russ. Russ.

647
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,359
- I thought you'd gone...
- GHQ calling all HF units.

648
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:41,165
GHQ calling all HF units.
Saucer near White House and Capitol.

649
01:12:16,489 --> 01:12:20,323
Attention all units.
Saucer landing near White House.

650
01:12:20,529 --> 01:12:22,759
- Attention...
- They're jamming us.

651
01:16:35,729 --> 01:16:38,721
Dr. Marvin,
we've made contact with GHQ.

652
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:44,322
GHQ to all HF units. Saucer has
landed in front of Capitol building.

653
01:16:44,529 --> 01:16:48,568
All HF units attention.
GHQ to all HF units.

654
01:17:32,809 --> 01:17:34,447
Keep firing at saucers.

655
01:18:22,809 --> 01:18:27,564
The present danger is ended.
The present danger is ended.

656
01:18:37,449 --> 01:18:41,920
All units report to your commanders
for further orders.

657
01:18:44,009 --> 01:18:46,523
The present danger is ended.

658
01:18:52,609 --> 01:18:55,999
- Don't wiggle.
- Here's what it says:

659
01:18:56,209 --> 01:19:00,725
"The president ordered Sky Hook
and the space program continued...

660
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:04,166
...under the direction
of Dr. Russell A. Marvin.

661
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:09,397
The United Nations assembly voted
to award a gold medal to Dr. Marvin."

662
01:19:09,609 --> 01:19:13,443
And to Mrs. Marvin goes a gold medal
f rom Dr. Marvin...

663
01:19:13,649 --> 01:19:17,722
...for her love, courage, devotion,
et cetera, et cetera.

664
01:19:21,409 --> 01:19:27,325
Russ, do you think there are any more?
Will they come back again?

665
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,327
Not on such a nice day.

666
01:19:38,729 --> 01:19:40,924
And not to such a nice world.

667
01:19:41,129 --> 01:19:44,917
- I'm glad it's still here.
- And still ours.

668
01:19:53,209 --> 01:19:54,198
