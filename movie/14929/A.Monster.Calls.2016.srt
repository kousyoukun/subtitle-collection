金刚本可以把他们打得稀巴烂
King Kong could've just smashed them all...

44

我对故事一无所知

Stories of how I slew dragons.

139
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,440
让我跟你讲个故事 关于我何时会走动起来
Let me tell you a tale of when I came walking.

140
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,280
让我跟你讲讲邪恶女王的下场
Let me tell you of the end of a wicked queen...

141
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,700
以及我是如果确保让她不再出现的
and how I made sure she was never seen again.

142
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,670
说吧
Go on then.

143
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,080
很好
Good.

144
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,030
你看到了什么
What do you see?

145
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,450
什么也没有 路上就树叶
Nothing. There are leafs in the way.

146
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,120
发挥你的想象力 康纳・奥马利
Use your imagination, Conor O'Malley.

147
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,790
你看到了什么
Now, what do you see?

148
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,720
- 我看到了火花  - 还有呢
- I see a spark. - Yes. And?

149
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,400
不是 这是水 是水彩画
No, it's water. It is watercolor.

150
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,300
继续看
Keep looking.

151
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,910
- 哇哦 - 确实会让人惊叹
- Wow. - Wow, indeed.

152
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,960
很久以前 这是一座城市 有道路 火车 汽车
Long ago, before this was a town with roads and trains and cars...

153
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:06,270
- 这里是一个王国 - 这里?
- this was a kingdom. - Here?

154
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,980
我们这里连乐购都没
We don't even have a Tesco.

155
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,720
这是一个繁荣的王国 有着一个睿智的国王
It was a prosperous kingdom with a wise king...

156
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,980
为他的人民取得了和平
With one peace for his people...

157
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,400
但和平是用某种代价换来的
but peace had come at a price.

158
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,070
国王失去了他的三个儿子
The king had lost all three of his sons in battle...

159
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,170
一个对抗巨人而死
to giants

160
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,780
一个对抗恶龙而死
to dragons

161
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,170
一个对抗由大魔法师率领的军队而死
to armies of men led by great wizards.

162
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,250
这一切听起来像童话
This all sounds pretty fairytalish.

163
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,490
你要是听到被矛杀害的那个男子的惨叫就不会这么说了
You wouldn't say that if you heard the screams of a man through by a spear.

164
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:47,460
女王无法忍受丧子之痛
The queen wasn't able to bear the loss of all their three sons...

165
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,290
绝望而去 独留国王一人
Leaving the king alone in despair,

166
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,720
和他唯一剩下的继承人
with the company of his only remaining heir...

167
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,470
他的孤儿孙子
his orphaned grandson.

168
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,360
这孩子被抚养成了王子
The child was raised as a prince...

169
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,280
用他的勇敢和赤诚之心赢得了全国的爱戴
winning the love of the kingdom with his scaventry and good heart.

170
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,260
他的人民敬爱他
His people loved him.

171
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,100
我们未来的国王
Our future king.

172
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,950
他快成年时 他爷爷娶了新任妻子
He was nearly a man when his grandfather took a new wife.

173
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
可之后国王却病了 谣言开始蔓延
The king felt ill and rumor began to spread...

174
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,050
说她是一个邪恶的巫婆
that she was an evil witch...

175
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:44,640
说她给国王下了毒 想为她自己夺取王位
That she was bent on taking the throne by herself by poisoning the king.

176
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,990
几周后 国王死了
A few weeks later the king died.

177
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,090
而王子还年轻 不能登基为国王
The prince was too young to take the king's place...

178
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,180
因此根据法律 女王将统治一年
So, by law, the queen would rule for another year.

179
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,860
未来已成未知
The future was uncertain.

180
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,140
期间 王子有了心上人
The prince meanwhile had given away his heart.

181
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,650
她既漂亮又聪明 是一个农夫的独女
She was beautiful and smart, and though only a farmer's daughter...

182
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,030
全国都觉得他们很般配
the kingdom smiled on the match.

183
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,880
然而 女王更享受当女王的乐趣
The queen however, was rather enjoying being queen.

184
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:50,220
除了嫁给王子还有什么更好的办法保留王位呢
And what better way to remain so, than to marry the prince herself?

185
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,390
什么 这真恶心
What? That's disgusting.

186
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,060
- 她是他外婆 - 是他继任的外婆
- She was his grandmother. - Step grandmother...

187
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,820
但还是一个年轻 漂亮的女人 不要忘记这一点
and still a young, beautiful woman herself, don't forget.

188
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:01,830
王子可不喜欢这主意
The prince, however, didn't like the idea.

189
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,840
他带着农夫的女儿 骑马逃至夜深
He took the farmer's daughter, and they rode away into the night.

190
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,020
他们在紫杉树的树枝下停下休息
They stopped to rest under the branches of a yew tree.

191
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:19,690
那是你
That's you.

192
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,030
第二天早晨 王子醒来
The next morning the Prince awoke.

193
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,370
起来了 我的爱人 他说道
"Arise, my beloved" he said.

194
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,300
但农夫的女儿一动也不动
But the farmer's daughter did not steer...

195
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,710
而王子注意到了血
Which was when the prince noticed the blood.

196
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,930
血?
Blood?

197
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,310
有人在晚上杀了他的爱人
Someone had killed his beloved in the night.

198
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,480
什么
What?

199
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,820
女王 他哭泣道
"The Queen" he cried.

200
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,490
女王杀了我的新娘
"The queen has murdered my bride."

201
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,170
村民们满腔怒火 复仇心切 他们暴动了
The villagers, full of fury and vengeance, rose up at the crime.

202
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,420
我就在那时走动了起来
It was then that I came walking.

203
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,220
女王再也没有出现过
The queen was never seen again.

204
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,650
很好 她罪有应得
Good. She deserved it.

205
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:30,800
我外婆的事  我想你也帮不上忙
Now, I don't suppose you can help me with my grandma.

206
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,410
故事还没结束
The story is not yet finished.

207
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,990
我把女王带到了非常远的地方
I took the queen and carried her far enough away

208
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,070
人们永远不会再找到她
so that the townspeople would never find her...

209
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,980
在海边的一个村庄里  她开始了新的生活
to a village by the sea, where she began a new life.

210
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,390
但她杀了农夫的女儿
But she killed the farmer's daughter.

211
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,050
你怎么能救一个杀人犯
How can you save a murderer?

212
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,190
你真的是一个怪物
You really are a monster.

213
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,820
我从没说是她杀了农夫的女儿
I never said she killed farmer's daughter.

214
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:57,680
我只说过王子那么说的
I only said that the prince said it was so.

215
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,130
那晚王子一直没入睡
The prince never fell asleep that night...

216
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,630
却等着农夫的女儿沉眠于睡梦中
but waited for the farmer's daughter to be lost in her dreams...

217
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,100
然后展开了他真正的计划
and then began his real plan.

218
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,570
什么
What?

219
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:17,990
他知道她的死会引发完全毁灭女王的星星之火
He knew her death would start a fire that would consume the queen entire.

220
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,180
这是个糟糕的故事 是骗人的
That's a terrible story. And a cheat.

221
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,930
这是一个真实的故事
It's a true story.

222
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,650
很多真实的事物都像是骗人的
Many things that are true feel like a cheat.

223
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,290
王国得到了值得拥有的王子
Kingdoms get their princes they deserve.

224
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,820
农夫的女儿死于无辜
Farmers' daughters die for no reason.

225
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,950
而有时候女巫又应该被救
And sometimes witches merit saving.

226
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,570
你可能会惊讶 实际上 经常会这样
Quite often, actually. You'd be surprised.

227
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,890
所以好王子是一个杀人犯 而邪恶的女王到最后却不是女巫?
So the good prince was a murderer and the evil queen was no witch after all?

228
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,730
女王当然是女巫
No, the queen was most certainly a witch...

229
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:56,200
也可能制造更大的邪恶
and could well have been on her way to great evil.

230
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,870
谁知道呢
Who can say?

231
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,510
那你为什么要救她
Then why did you save her then?

232
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,500
因为她不是凶手
Because what she was not, was a murderer.

233
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,530
她没给国王下毒
She hadn't poisoned the king.

234
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,850
他只是年迈了
He had merely grown old.

235
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,860
王子有被抓起来吗
Did the prince ever get caught?

236
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,980
没有 他成了一个受人爱戴的国王
No. He became a much beloved king...

237
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,530
开心地统治着直到死去
who ruled happily until the end of his long days.

238
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,080
没错
Oh yes.

239
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,010
我不明白
I don't get it.

240
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,870
谁是好人呢
Who is the good guy here?

241
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:29,880
不会一直有好人 康纳・奥马利...
There is not always a good guy, Conor O'Malley...

242
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,010
也不会一直有坏人
nor is there always a bad one.

243
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,550
很多人都介于这两者之间
Most people are somewhere in between.

244
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,170
这些怎么从外婆那把我救出来
So how is this all meant to save me from grandma?

245
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,050
不是从她那把你救出来
It is not her you need saving from.

246
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,830
故事总有两面性
There are always two sides to a story.

247
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:08,360
你们有多少人知道一句俗话
Now, how many of you know the saying:

248
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,950
棍棒和石头可能会打断我的骨头 但言词永远伤害不了我
"Stick and stones may break my bones, but words can never touch me?"

249
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:17,430
这样的话 下次要有人对你们说了什么 只要记住...
That way the next time someone says something to you just remember...

250
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,570
很好 你到家了
Good, you're home.

251
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,890
你妈妈在楼上 她想和你谈谈
Your mum's upstairs. She wants to talk to you.

252
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,290
- 什么 - 你爸周日会坐飞机过来
- What? - Your father's flying in on Sunday.

253
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,910
爸爸要来了? 从美国过来?
Dad's coming? From America?

254
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,280
去吧
Go on.

255
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,160
她等着呢
She's waiting.

256
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,160
打包好你的东西
And pack your bag.

257
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,260
你要来和我住几天
You're coming to stay with me for a few days.

258
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,680
去吧
Go on.

259
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,830
那棵树很赞
That tree is amazing.

260
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,370
在这里矗立了数千年
It's been here for thousands of years.

261
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,550
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

262
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,410
我觉得外婆想把我变成蒂娜・特纳
I think Grandma is trying to turn me into Tina Turner.

263
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,330
她一定是她粉丝
She must be a fan.

264
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,280
我为什么要和外婆住
Why am I going to stay with grandma?

265
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,060
你要回医院吗
Are you going back to the hospital?

266
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,430
过来 康
Come here, Con.

267
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,190
上一次治疗没达到效果
This latest treatment is not doing what it's supposed to.

268
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,620
所以要调整下
So they're going to adjust it...

269
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,840
尝试别的
try something else.

270
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,390
-  就这样? - 就这样
- That's all? - That's all.

271
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,110
你确定吗
Are you sure?

272
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,770
确定
I'm sure.

273
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,940
因为...
Because...

274
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,320
你能跟我讲的
you can tell me, you know.

275
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,280
一切都会好起来 康纳
Everything will be fine, Conor.

276
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,550
你会看到的
You'll see.

277
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,280
等等我们 康纳 你要去哪
Wait for us, Conor. Where are you going?

278
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,080
- 不要碰他  - 不要碰他?
- Don't touch him. - "Don't touch him?"

279
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,310
- 我给他脸上来一下怎么了 - 我说了别碰他
- With a punch to the face? - I said don't touch him.

280
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,460
奥马利和我有共识
O'Malley and I have an understanding.

281
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,530
我是唯一能碰他的人
I'm the only one who touches him.

282
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,970
对吗
Isn't that right?

283
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,070
告诉我
Now tell me.

284
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,140
为什么每次我转过身 你就在那看着我
Why is it that every time I turn around, you're there looking at me?

285
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,270
你不觉得很怪吗
Getting a bit odd, don't you think?

286
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,030
抱歉 这有点残酷
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

287
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,120
今天 生活未能一路顺风
Life isn't really going your way today, are they?

288
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,160
因为你选错了地方
You picked the wrong spot.

289
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,640
我要带人去看房子
I have a house to show.

290
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,160
我相信你会一个人待在这里等你父亲
I trust you alone here till your father shows up.

291
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,180
我现在不是五岁
I'm not five years old.

292
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,790
这是正确的时间
This is the correct time.

293
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,160
你手机 电脑上都不对
Not the one on your phone or on the computer,

294
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,950
就连新闻上的也不对
not even on the news.

295
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:54,410
这是我母亲的 你曾外婆的
That was my mother's, your great grandmother's.

296
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,330
完美无误地走了一百多年
Perfect timekeeping for over a hundred years.

297
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,330
康纳 过来收拾好
Conor! Pack up your rucksack.

298
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,870
我不希望你父亲觉得我让你生活在猪圈里
I don't want your father to think that I'm keeping you in a pigsty.

299
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,450
- 真是没什么机会 - 是的
- Not much shots of that. - No.

300
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,450
等你去了医院
When you go to the hospital,

301
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,210
你父亲可能不会注意到你母亲会有多累
your father may not notice how tired you mother's becoming.

302
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,470
所以我们必须确保他不会待太久
So we have to make sure he does not overstay his welcome.

303
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:20,180
这跟以前的事无关
Not that that's been a historically problem.

304
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,890
不能吃鸡蛋 这周你已经吃过两次了
No eggs. You already had eggs twice this week.

305
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,600
如果你饿了
If you are getting hungry,

306
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,260
冰箱里有菠菜你可以蒸
there is spinach in the fridge you can steam.

307
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,330
当然
Yeah, sure.

308
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,880
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything.

309
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:37,890
我会尽最大努力什么都不碰的
I will do my very best not to.

310
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,560
找到了
Get it.

311
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,190
爸爸
Dad.

312
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,520
你怎么样 康 你看上去很累
How are you doing, Con? You look tired.

313
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,810
我挺好
I'm fine.

314
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,810
妈妈在用新药 会让她好转
Mum's on this new medicine. And it will make her better.

315
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,860
她每两个星期去次医院
She goes to the hospital every two weeks...

316
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,900
他们把药物打入她的血流
and they pump the medicine into her bloodstream.

317
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,830
她会发病几天 然后好转
She's sick for the next few days, but she's better again.

318
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:56,470
- 你妹妹最近挺好  - 同父异母的妹妹
- Your sister is doing better. - Half sister.

319
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,600
是的
Yeah.

320
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,690
我想让你和她见见
I'd still love you to meet her.

321
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,190
我跟你外婆谈过了 想把你带去洛杉矶
I've been talking with your grandmother about bringing you out to LA.

322
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,910
- 你想让我去洛杉矶? - 是的
- You want me to come to LA? - Yeah absolutely.

323
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,340
- 你想去的吧 - 是的
- You'd like that wouldn't you? - Yeah.

324
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,680
我们去那过圣诞
We were thinking over Christmas,

325
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,670
回来正好能上学
that way you can be back here in time for school.

326
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,500
你意思是去玩咯
So you mean just for a visit then?

327
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,350
对啊 会很棒
Yeah, but it would be great.

328
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,180
我不想和外婆住
I don't want to live with grandma.

329
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,050
那是个老女人的房子 里面全是老女人的东西
It's an old lady's house with old ladies' things.

330
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,960
你什么都不能碰 哪里都不能坐
Can't touch anything or sit anywhere.

331
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
连胡闹两秒钟都不行
Can't even leave a mess for two seconds.

332
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,230
康纳 我知道 但...
Conor, I know, but...

333
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,410
我想要自己房子的房间 自己的东西
I want to have my own room in my my own house with my own things.

334
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,790
你来美国住也不会有啊 康纳
Well, you wouldn't have that in America, Conor.

335
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,350
几乎没足够的空间给我们三个人
There is barely enough room for the three of us.

336
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,060
- 我不在乎  - 康纳 听着...
- I do not care. - Conor listen...

337
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,360
- 她太严厉了 - 你的家人 你的生活 你的朋友...
- She's so strict. - Your family, your life, your friends...

338
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,230
- 她家像个博物馆 - 你的学校 一切都在这里 好吗
- Her house is like a museum. - Your school, all of it is here, okay?

339
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,080
把你带离这里是不公平的
It would be unfair to take you out of here.

340
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,570
- 对谁不公平 - 康纳
- Unfair to whom? - Conor.

341
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,480
你外婆好像还没回家
Doesn't look like your grandmother's home yet.

342
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,640
她有时会在我睡觉后再回医院去
She sometimes goes back to the hospital after I go to bed.

343
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,310
护士让她睡在一张椅子上
The nurses let her sleep in a chair.

344
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,180
你外婆不喜欢我
Hey, just because your grandmother

345
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,630
不代表她是个坏人
doesn't like me, doesn't make her a bad person.

346
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,400
她说你总有始无终
She says you're all start and no finish.

347
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,900
她有权表达她自己的看法
Well, she entitled to her own opinion.

348
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,230
你会待多久
How long are you here for?

349
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,060
能多久就多久
As long as I can be.

350
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,900
什么意思
What does that mean?

351
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:34,690
我们钱不多 美国的假期也不多
We don't have a lot of money and Americans don't get a lot of holiday.

352
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,470
- 你不是美国人  - 没错 但我住那了
- You're not an American. - No, but I live there now.

353
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,200
必要时 我会回来
I'll come back whenever I need to.

354
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,980
到了圣诞 你就来洛杉矶
And you're going to come to LA for Christmas.

355
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,660
不行 你那狭小的房子没空间给我了
God no, not in your cramped house where there is no room for me.

356
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,620
康纳
Conor

357
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,920
你干嘛要来
Why did you come?

358
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,020
康纳 别走
Conor wait.

359
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,020
康纳 明天见 好吗
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

360
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,420
还有很多时间
There's still loads of time.

361
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,680
随着破坏的继续 那是相当可怜的
As destruction goes, that was remarkably pitiful.

362
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,360
现在 我要跟你讲第二个故事
Now, I've come to tell you the second tale.

363
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,560
和第一个一样糟糕吗
Is it as bad as the last one?

364
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,480
是一个合理的毁灭结局 如果你是这意思的话
It ends with proper destruction, if that's what you mean.

365
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,360
是关于一个只为自己考虑的男人
It's about a man who thought only of himself...

366
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,230
一个理应慷慨却不慷慨的男人
a man who wasn't as generous as he should have been.

367
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,230
一个受到惨痛惩罚的男人
A man who gets punished very badly indeed.

368
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,400
故事都不是真实的
Stories aren't real though.

369
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,900
它们毫无帮助
They don't help anything.

370
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,640
故事都是狂野的生物 康纳・奥马利
Stories are wild creatures, Conor O'Malley.

371
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:26,980
你松开它们
When you let them lose,

372
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,330
谁知道它们会造成怎样的浩劫
who knows what havoc they might reek?

373
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,810
没错
Oh yes.

374
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:35,020
好吧
Okay.

375
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,940
说吧
Go on then.

376
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,340
很好
Good.

377
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,770
150年前
150 years ago...

378
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,170
未来降临
The future came.

379
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:26,090
工厂如野草般生长
Factories grew like weeds.

380
00:46:27,770 --> 00:46:30,270
树木被砍 河水变黑
Trees fell, rivers blackened...

381
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,220
天空被烟灰弄得窒息
and the sky choked on smoke and ash.

382
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,670
但仍有绿色存在 如果你知道去哪看的话
But there was still green if you knew where to look.

383
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,710
在城市边缘住着一个固执的男人
On the edge of this town lived a stubborn man.

384
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:45,610
他拒绝改变
Who refused to change.

385
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,330
他仍遵循旧医学
He daunted on the old ways of medicine...

386
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:54,910
使用草药 树皮以及用树叶和浆果制成的混合物
herbs and barks and concoctions brewed from berries and leafs.

387
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,540
村民们称他为药医师
Villagers ever only called him the apothecary.

388
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,790
- 什么 - 药医师
- The what? - The apothecary.

389
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,060
药师的旧称
An old-fashioned name for 'pharmacist'.

390
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,320
你怎么不直接这么说
Why didn't you just say?

391
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,610
这村里还有个年轻牧师
There was also a young parson in this village,

392
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:15,810
很有见识 也很和善
an enlightened man and a kind one...

393
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,810
一心只想着教区
who just wanted the very best for his congregation.

394
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,950
他布道反对药医师的旧医学
He preached against the apothecary's use of the old ways...

395
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:27,110
而药医师的坏脾气和贪婪
and the apothecary's foul temper and greed...

396
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:31,140
让那些布道更为人所接受了
made certain some of these sermons fell on eager ears.

397
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,360
他想尽可能地帮助社区
Much as he tried to keep on helping the community...

398
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,360
但他的生意一落千丈 这让他愤愤不平
his business sank which only made him grow bitter

399
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,230
牧师的住所也有一棵紫杉树
On the parsonage's ground there also lived a yew tree.

400
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,270
那是你所在的地方
That's the hill where you live.

401
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:58,310
紫杉树是最重要的治愈之树
The yew tree is the most important of the healing trees.

402
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:58,920
为什么
Why?

403
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:03,610
它的果实和树皮 会弹奏 会燃烧 有着生命的悸动
Its berries, its bark, they brum and burn and twist with life.

404
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:06,730
能治愈几乎所有疾病
That can cure almost any ailment.

405
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,240
真的吗 什么都能?
Really? Anything?

406
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,480
什么都能 只要药医师混合得对
Anything that can be cured if mixed by the right apothecary.

407
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,210
药医师很想要这紫杉树
The apothecary wanted the yew tree very badly.

408
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:28,010
但要获得这些东西 他就必须砍了它
But in order to harvest these things, he would have to cut it down.

409
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:31,860
但这是牧师所不允许的
And this, the parson would not allow.

410
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,980
牧师有两个女儿  是他的生命之光
The parson had two daughters who were the light of his life.

411
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:46,440
他是一个充满关爱的父亲 为了她们会给予一切
He was a caring, loving father who would've done anything for their sake.

412
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:51,860
但有一天 两个小女孩都被可怕的疾病击溃了
But one day both little girls were struck by a terrible sickness...

413
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,850
而牧师做的一切都没帮助
and nothing the parson did helped.

414
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:59,590
现代医学没有治疗办法 祷告也没用 什么都没用
No cure from the more modern doctors, no prayer, nothing.

415
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,690
除了找药医师 别无选择
There was no choice but to approach the apothecary.

416
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:16,900
你愿帮助我的女儿们吗 牧师乞求道
"Will you not help my daughters?". The parson begged.

417
00:49:17,070 --> 00:49:20,660
你愿拯救两个无辜的女孩吗
"Will you not save two innocent girls?"

418
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,660
我为什么要救呢 药医师说
"Why should I?". Said the apothecary.

419
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,210
你的布道毁了我的事业
"You have driven away my business with your preachings...

420
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,440
你拒绝把紫杉树给我 那是最好的治愈之源
and you have refused me the yew tree, my best source of healing".

421
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,300
紫杉树你拿去吧 牧师说
"You may have the yew tree," said the parson.

422
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,190
你会宣讲有利于你的事
"I will preach sermons in your favour.

423
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:41,490
只要你救我女儿 我什么都愿意做
I will do anything only you will save my daughters."

424
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,690
你愿放弃你所信仰的一切吗 药医师说
"Would you give up everything you believe in?". Said the apothecary.

425
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,530
如果那样能救她们 我就愿意放弃一切
"If it would save them, I would give up everything."

426
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,530
那我没什么能帮你的了
"Then there's nothing I can do to help you."

427
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:21,790
第二天 牧师的两个女儿全都死了
The very next day both of the parson's daughters died.

428
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:25,790
- 什么  - 那天晚上我走动了起来
- What? - And that night I came walking.

429
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,070
很好 他理应受到惩罚
Good. He deserves all the punishment he gets.

430
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,970
确实  那时刚过午夜
Indeed. It was shortly after midnight...

431
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,660
牧师家被我从底部往上撕裂开来
That I tore the house of the parson from its very foundations.

432
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,690
牧师? 你在说什么
The parson? What are you talking about?

433
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
药医师才是坏人
The apothecary is the evil one.

434
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,610
他贪婪粗鲁 但他仍是个治疗者
He was greedy and rude, but he was still a healer.

435
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,940
而牧师 他是什么呢
The parson, what was he?

436
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,660
一个没有信仰的信徒
A man of faith without faith.

437
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,400
信念是半个救治方式
Belief is half of all healing.

438
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:06,000
相信治疗方式 相信等待着的未来
Belief in the cure, belief in the future that awaits.

439
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,850
信仰是宝贵的
Your belief is precious...

440
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:14,610
所以你应该留意你信仰什么 你信仰谁
so you must be careful where you put it and in whom.

441
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,480
告诉我 康纳・奥马利 下一个我要毁掉什么
Tell me, Conor O'Malley, what shall I destroy next?

442
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,520
- 什么 - 这很爽 我向你保证
- What? - It is most satisfying, I can assure you.

443
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,660
告诉我 我要毁掉什么
Tell me. What should I destroy?

444
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,790
打坏烟囱
Smack the chimney?

445
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:30,900
烟囱
The chimney.

446
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:33,910
下面呢
Next?

447
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:35,920
扔掉他们的床
Throw away their beds.

448
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,680
打破家具
Smash the furniture.

449
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,160
打破窗户
Break the windows.

450
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:54,940
窗户?
Windows.

451
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,360
你来亲自动手把
Break them yourself.

452
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:02,830
来吧
Come one.

453
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,300
用力  康纳・奥马利
Harder, Conor O'Malley.

454
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,120
用力
Come on. Harder.

455
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,370
就是这样
That's it.

456
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,960
没错
Yes.

457
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:24,530
感觉很棒
Feels good doesn't it?

458
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,920
很好
Yeah.

459
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,990
外婆
Grandma.

460
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,150
外婆
Grandma.

461
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:24,650
外婆 别这样
Grandma, please...

462
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,850
外婆
Grandma.

463
00:56:06,310 --> 00:56:08,410
我听说你喜欢吃煎蛋
I heard you like them sunny side up.

464
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,240
-  你在这里干嘛 - 你觉得呢
- What are you doing here? - What do you think?

465
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,710
你外婆今天一大早就打电话来了
Your grandmother called very early this morning.

466
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,940
她去医院看你妈妈了
She's gone to the hospital to see your mum.

467
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,970
你妈妈恶化了 康
Your mum's had a bad turn, Con.

468
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,070
我要见她
I need to see her.

469
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,910
我们到时候看今天的结果
We'll see what happens today, and maybe you can

470
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:33,900
也许你下午能去看她一会儿
visit for a little while this afternoon.

471
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:42,630
我知道你有多难过
I can see how upset you are.

472
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,940
我不是故意的 我不知道怎么回事
I didn't mean to. I don't know what happened.

473
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:53,230
- 在海上有更糟的事  - 什么意思
- Worse things happen at sea. - What do you mean?

474
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,260
你要惩罚我吗
Aren't you going to punish me?

475
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,680
这有什么意义
What could possibly be the point in that?

476
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,560
我必须说 这真的是令人惊讶
I got to say champ, this is really just amazingly thorough.

477
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,980
一个被掩埋的宝藏
Oh, a buried treasure.

478
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:21,160
这一定是我第一次搬走时
These must be those home movies that your mother

479
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,880
你妈寄我的家庭电影
used to send when I first moved away.

480
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:25,670
你为什么搬走
Why did you move away?

481
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,060
我们当时还年轻
We were young.

482
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,120
很年轻 我们有很大的梦想
Too young, you know? We had big dreams, and...

483
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,440
- 什么样的梦想 - 你妈妈想去艺术学校
- What kind of dreams? - Your mother wanted to go to art college.

484
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,750
- 是吗 - 没错 她没去 但她想去
- Really? - Yeah. She didn't go, but she wanted to.

485
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:46,120
发生了什么事
What happened?

486
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,070
因为妈妈怀了我
Because mum got pregnant with me.

487
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,290
你妈妈从没后悔有了你 你是唯一的好消息
Mum never regretted having you. You were only ever good news.

488
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:58,790
我很清楚 因为她后悔一件事 就是嫁给了我
And I know that for a fact, because the one thing she regretted was marrying me.

489
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:02,410
- 那她为什么要嫁给你 - 因为我帅
- Why did she marry you then? - Because I'm handsome.

490
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:12,380
你妈妈很棒 现在还是 当时我们恋爱了
Your mum was amazing. And she still is. And we were in love.

491
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,540
我还爱她 但你会知道...
I mean, I still love her. But you will see that...

492
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:22,900
爱是不够的 它没法带你度过一生
love isn't enough. It doesn't carry you through.

493
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,890
所以你后来就没有过上幸福过
So you didn't get happily ever after.

494
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,380
没错 但这就是生活
No, but that's life, you know?

495
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:36,180
后来只变得更糟糕了 但没关系
Most of it just get messier after. And that's alright.

496
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:43,260
我很高兴你变得像她
Even I'm happy you turned out like her.

497
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,420
别跟我说要做什么 ...
You're telling what to do now...

498
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,420
那你就可以把他从学校领出来...
You can take him out of school then...

499
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:55,020
谢谢
Thank you.

500
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:01,020
我想找点吃的 你呢 孩子
I'm looking for something to eat. You want something, kid?

501
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:02,520
别叫我孩子
Stop calling me 'kid'.

502
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:05,070
好的
Fair enough.

503
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:11,400
对不起 丽兹
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

504
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:20,410
穿西装的那男人是谁
Who was that man in a suit?

505
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,090
只是...
Just...

506
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,640
没什么
Nothing.

507
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,590
- 今天上午发生了什么  - 没什么
- What happened this morning? - Nothing.

508
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,980
没事的
It's fine.

509
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,450
我只是有点不好的反应
I had a bit of a bad reaction.

510
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,740
但他们还会做一个尝试
There's one more thing they're going to try,

511
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:48,040
那种药的效果真的很好
and it's a medicine that's had some really good results.

512
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,270
他们为什么不一开始就试呢
Why didn't they try it in the first place?

513
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:52,650
因为你用了别的东西
Because this is something you take when the other

514
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,220
然而效果不如他们所想的那么好
stuff hasn't worked the way they wanted it to.

515
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:59,160
意思太迟了吗
Does that mean it's too late?

516
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,480
当然不是太迟的意思
No of course it doesn't mean it's too late.

517
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,260
你确定吗
Are you sure?

518
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,190
我相信我说的每一个字
I believe every word I say.

519
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:13,100
信念是半个救治方式
Belief is half of all healing.

520
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:20,630
相信治疗方式 相信等待着的未来
Belief in the cure, belief in the future that awaits.

521
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,690
是啊
Yeah.

522
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,210
你还记得我一直说的那棵树吗
And you know that tree I'm always going on about?

523
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,670
记得
Yeah.

524
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:35,530
这药是拿那种树做的
Well, this drug is made from trees like that.

525
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,020
- 是吗 - 没错
- It is? - Yeah.

526
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,550
真的?
Seriously?

527
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:41,900
一直以来 我们本能出去砍掉它
All this time we could have gone out there and just chopped it down.

528
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,940
但那一棵不行
But not that one.

529
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,480
那一棵是我们的朋友
That one's our friend.

530
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,250
你在哪
Where are you?

531
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,620
我在这
I'm here.

532
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,800
你能让我妈妈好转吗
Can you do it? Can you make my mum better?

533
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:41,970
你母亲能被治愈的话 紫杉树会那么做
If your mother can be healed, the yew tree will do it.

534
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:49,140
- 所以是可以咯? - 你还是不知道你为什么召唤我
- So that's a yes? - You still don't know why you called me.

535
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,890
我没有召唤你 就算有也是为了我妈妈
I didn't call you. And even if I did, it was obviously for mum.

536
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:54,360
- 是吗 - 还能怎么样
- Was it? - What else?

537
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,870
那些蠢故事毫无意义
To listen to idiotic stories that make no sense.

538
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,930
现在还不是讲第三个故事的时候 但快了 在那之后
It is not yet time for the third tale. But soon. And after that...

539
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:04,730
你要告诉我你的故事 康纳・奥马利
you will tell me your story, Conor O'Malley.

540
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:07,170
不
No.

541
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:10,510
不 不是这个 这只是一场噩梦
No, not this. That's just a nightmare.

542
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,140
别这样
No, please.

543
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:19,690
那不是真的 那不过是一场噩梦
That's not my truth. That's just a nightmare.

544
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:23,030
然而这会在第三个故事之后发生
Nevertheless, this will happen after the third tale.

545
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,400
我想知道我妈妈会怎么样
I want to know what's going to happen with my mum.

546
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,350
别浪费你被给予的宝贵时间
Do not waste the precious time that is given you.

547
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:32,340
等等 你要去哪
Wait. Where are you going?

548
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:35,140
如果你是治愈之树 那我需要你去救治
If you are a tree of healing, then I need you to heal.

549
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,220
我会的
And so I shall.

550
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:14,610
康纳 我会回来的 我保证 你来洛杉矶过圣诞
Conor, I'll come back. I promise, alright. And you'll come to LA for Christmas.

551
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,180
我不想圣诞就留妈妈一个人
I wont leave mum alone for Christmas.

552
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:20,620
- 康纳你妈妈用的这个药... - 会让她好转
- Conor this medicine your mum's taking... - Is going to make her well.

553
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:22,680
康纳 很可能不会
No, Conor, it probably isn't.

554
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,880
- 会的 - 这是最后一博了 儿子
- Yes it is. - No, it's a last stage effort, son.

555
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,460
会治愈她的 我知道的
It will heal her. I know it.

556
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,740
这就是它来的原因 一定是的
It is the reason it came. It has to be.

557
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,490
- 什么来的原因 - 怪物
- Reason what came? - The monster.

558
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:35,580
- 康纳  什么  - 它总会12点07分出现
- Conor, what? - It comes to 12h07.

559
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:38,130
起初我以为这是一个梦 但它不是
At first I thought it was a dream, but there is always...

560
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,860
康纳 别说了 那是个梦
Stop. It is a dream.

561
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:42,350
只是个梦 我很抱歉你得面对这件事
That's all it is. I'm sorry you have to face this...

562
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,670
但你得勇敢起来
but you have to be brave.

563
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:48,120
明白吗
Do you understand?

564
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,760
来吧
Come on.

565
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:53,180
来吧
Come on.

566
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,570
我会尽快回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

567
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,670
如果不够快怎么办
What if it's not fast enough?

568
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,250
康纳 听着
Conor, listen...

569
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:18,720
- 没事的 - 什么没事的
- It's okay. - What is okay?

570
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,340
只是...
Just...

571
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:22,530
你不用尽快
You don't have to.

572
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,230
看到没
Look. Do you see it?

573
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,230
看到了吗 你能挥手吗
Do you see it? Can you wave?

574
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:38,240
你能看到他吗
Can you see him?

575
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,830
向外婆挥手
And then we wave to grandma.

576
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,080
嗨 外婆
Hello grandma.

577
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,500
康 向外婆和妈妈打招呼
Con, you can say hello to grandma and mum?

578
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,840
嗨 外婆
Hello Grandma.

579
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:55,260
这就对了
Here we go.

580
01:06:55,430 --> 01:06:58,270
妈妈已经听过这个很多次了
Mum has heard this many times.

581
01:06:58,330 --> 01:07:00,170
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

582
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:02,510
康 过来
Con, come sit here.

583
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:05,340
康 看啊
Con, look.

584
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:08,180
- 你好 外婆  - 妈妈...
- Hello grandma. - Mama...

585
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:10,350
妈妈
- one... - Mama.

586
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,800
很好
There we go.

587
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,440
外婆 我们在画画
We are doing your picture, grandma.

588
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,450
然后混在一起
And then mix it together.

589
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,120
这是什么颜色
What color is that?

590
01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:22,020
棕色
Brown.

591
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:26,460
- 好看又幸运的棕色 - 棕色
- It is a nice lodgy brown. - Brown.

592
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:29,470
- 但这里有棕色了 - 没错
- But we have brown here. - That's true.

593
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:32,930
看到了吗
What can you see?

594
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,100
那是什么 它们是什么
What is that? What are those?

595
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:38,270
你觉得这些是什么
What do you... What are these?

596
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,490
- 眼睛 - 眼睛 没错
- Eyes. - Eyes. That's it.

597
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:44,240
生活永远都在眼睛之中
Life is always in the eyes.

598
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,330
如果你懂的话
If you get that...

599
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,910
你会是个出色的艺术家
you will be a proper artist.

600
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,240
很好
Yes.

601
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:55,380
看啊
Look.

602
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:57,390
就是这么画眼睛
This is how we draw the eyes in...

603
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,630
这里是眼睛捕捉映像的地方
because this is where the eyes catch the reflection.

604
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:06,530
在眼睛里 我们能看到生活 看见没
There we see the life in the eyes. See that?

605
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:11,410
再来一次 这就是生活
Do it again. It's life.

606
01:08:14,410 --> 01:08:17,840
用铅笔吧
Maybe if we take a pencil...

607
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,680
然后在那里画
and you can draw on that...

608
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:24,100
想试试吗
Do you want to try it?

609
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,480
让我看看
Show me how you do it.

610
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:42,340
看 康
Look, Con.

611
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:47,510
那是他的头发 这是他的眉毛
That's his hair and this is his eyebrow.

612
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,640
这边是眼睛
There's the eyes.

613
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:54,560
看 这是他的嘴
Oh look, there's his mouth.

614
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:58,400
这是他的嘴 他非得愤怒
There's his mouth. He is very angry.

615
01:08:58,570 --> 01:09:00,740
看到了吗
Can you see?

616
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:03,490
看啊
Look at that.

617
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:08,280
然后我们画张脸
And then we start to make a face.

618
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:10,340
然后
And then...

619
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,760
这就是我们的怪物
there's our monster.

620
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,510
这就是怪物
There's the monster.

621
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:17,270
看这怪物
Look at the monster.

622
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:53,700
慢点
Very slowly.

623
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,290
就是这样
That's it.

624
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,210
没错 好的
That's it, okay.

625
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,740
今早是30分钟的考试
Okay, so 30 minutes exam this morning...

626
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,740
考的过去两周我们都做过的东西
and this is all the stuff we've been doing for the last two weeks.

627
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:25,380
复习过就不会有意外
So if you've done your revision, there will be no surprises.

628
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,190
你们马上就得合上书本
So in a moment I'm going to ask you to turn your pages over.

629
01:10:33,190 --> 01:10:39,270
下面30分钟都不准说话 要保持完全安静
There will be no talking for the next 30 minutes. I want total silence...

630
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:43,570
因为你们要用的是大脑而不是嘴
because you are going to use your brains, not your mouths.

631
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:45,990
30分钟...
So 30 minutes...

632
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,830
现在开始 祝你们好运
Starting now. Good luck.

633
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:19,030
在这么久之后
I think I've finally figures you out.

634
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:21,600
我想我总算搞懂你了
After all this time.

635
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:26,190
你只是想让人对你印象深刻
All you're looking for is someone kick your head in.

636
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,860
但你知道吗
But you know what?

637
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:31,030
我不再是那个家伙了
I'm not that guy anymore.

638
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,220
再见 奥马利
Goodbye, O'Malley.

639
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:42,010
我再也不会看见你
I no longer see you.

640
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:45,340
现在你对我来说是隐形的
Now you're invisible to me too.

641
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,700
希望你妈妈会好起来
I hope your mum gets better.

642
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,480
你怎么这么慢
What took you so long?

643
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:18,800
是时候讲第三个故事了
It's time for the third tale.

644
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,930
曾经有个隐形人
There was once an invisible man...

645
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:28,110
厌倦了不被人看见
who was grown tired of being unseen.

646
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:32,080
实际上 他不是隐形的
It was not that he was actually invisible.

647
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:37,540
只是人们习惯于无视他
It was just the people had become used to not seeing him.

648
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:42,550
有一天 隐形人再也受不了了
One day, the invisible man couldn't stand it anymore.

649
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:47,470
他好奇如果没人看见你
He kept wondering, if no one sees you...

650
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,140
那你真的存在吗
Are you really there at all?

651
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:54,150
隐形人做了什么
What did the invisible man do?

652
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,750
他召唤了怪物
He called for a monster.

653
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,910
我都不知道跟你说什么好 奥马利
I don't even know what to say to you, O'Malley.

654
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:25,020
你把他送进了医院
You sent him to hospital.

655
01:13:25,190 --> 01:13:27,940
他父母威胁要起诉
His parents are threatening to sue.

656
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:31,160
- 那不是我 - 什么
- It wasn't me. - What was that?

657
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:33,620
那不是我
Wasn't me.

658
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:40,090
我不是隐形的
I'm not invisible. I'm not invisible.

659
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,900
如果你想被人注意 奥马利 那可不是最好的办法
If you want to be seen, O'Malley, this is not the best way.

660
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:47,640
我不是隐形的 你听见了吗
I'm not invisible. Did you hear me? I'm not invisible.

661
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:52,490
根据学校规定 你会被立即开除
School rules dictate immediately exclusion.

662
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:58,900
但我是一名教师 我怎么可能做得到
But how could I do that and consider myself any kind of a teacher?

663
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,620
回去上课吧
Go back to class.

664
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,950
我们改日再谈 今天就不谈了
We will talk about this one day, but not today.

665
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:09,830
你不惩罚我?
You're not punishing me?

666
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,420
这有什么意义
What could possibly be the point?

667
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:28,780
我来给你举个健康情绪的例子
Well, let me give you an example of emotional wellness.

668
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:34,030
你知道有时说不是有多困难
You know how difficult it is sometimes to say no. And how good it feels...

669
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:38,710
而当你找到勇气说出口时 感觉会会很棒 这是为什么呢
When you finally find the courage to say it anyway. Why is that?

670
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:41,420
你有空吗
Do you have a moment?

671
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,260
怎么了
Hoi, wat is is?

672
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,930
我们刚接到医院电话
We just got a call from the hospital.

673
01:14:49,100 --> 01:14:54,140
恐怕康纳的母亲快不行了 他们想要他过去
I am afraid that Conor's mother is not going to make it. They want him to come there.

674
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,530
你不一起吗
Aren't you coming?

675
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,760
我就待在这
I'll be right here.

676
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,710
你的手怎么了
What did you do to your hands?

677
01:16:10,710 --> 01:16:13,540
是要谈话 对吗
It's the talk isn't it?

678
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:16,920
最近每个人都想谈话
Everybody wants to have a talk lately.

679
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,760
康
Con...

680
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,940
看着我
Look at me.

681
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,510
今早我跟医生谈过话
I spoke to the doctor this morning.

682
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:41,740
新的治疗方式没作用
The new treatment it's... it's not working.

683
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:45,670
紫杉树的那个?
The one from the yew tree?

684
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,650
是的
Yeah.

685
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:53,120
怎么会没作用
How can it not be working?

686
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:57,400
一切都发生太快 超出了他们的预想
Things just happen fast. Faster than they thought.

687
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:00,820
- 怎么会没作用呢 - 不知道
- How can it not be working? - I don't know.

688
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,110
它必须要有作用
It has to.

689
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:12,620
那现在怎么说 下一步怎么治疗
So what happens now? What's going to be the next treatment?

690
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:20,880
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

691
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:27,600
我一生中从没这么抱歉过
I've never been more sorry about anything in my life.

692
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,390
你生气的话 也没事 康
It's okay that you're angry, Con.

693
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,480
真的
It really is.

694
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,850
我也很气自己告诉你真相
I'm pretty angry too, to tell you the truth.

695
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,430
但是 康纳...
But Con...

696
01:17:57,170 --> 01:17:59,540
康纳 你在听吗
Con, are you listening?

697
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,050
有一天...
One day...

698
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:10,700
如果你回想这件事 为自己的生气而感到难过
if you look back and you feel bad for being so angry...

699
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:16,560
你甚至可以向我倾诉 但你必须清楚 这没关系
you couldn't even speak to me, you have to know that was okay...

700
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:25,810
我就知道你会难过
That I knew.

701
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:34,570
因为你要对我说的 不用你说出口 我就已经知道了
Because I know everything you need to tell me without you having to say it out loud.

702
01:18:38,990 --> 01:18:42,160
如果你要摔东西
And if you need to break things...

703
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,850
那就去摔吧
By God you break them.

704
01:18:47,380 --> 01:18:50,360
使劲摔
Break them good and hard.

705
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:53,760
我会伴你左右 康
And I'll be right there, Con.

706
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,140
我希望我能有100年
I wish I had a hundred years.

707
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:17,070
能照顾你的100年
A hundred years I could give to you.

708
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,470
醒醒
Wake up.

709
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:50,420
醒醒
Wake up.

710
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:56,020
醒醒
Wake up.

711
01:19:56,180 --> 01:20:01,120
我不管现在是几点 你个骗子 醒醒
I don't care what time it is. You lied. Wake up.

712
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:05,580
醒醒
Wake up.

713
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,860
现在我需要你
I need you now.

714
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:24,560
- 你再这样只会让自己更痛苦 - 没起作用
- You are doing yourself more pain. - It did not work.

715
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:27,680
你说紫杉树会让她好起来 但并没有
You said the yew tree would make her better, but it did not.

716
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,680
让她好起来
Make her better.

717
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:34,370
是你召唤我的 康纳・奥马利
You're the one who called me, Conor O'Malley.

718
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,910
如果是我召唤你的 那就是为了救她 为了治好她
If I called you, it was to save her. It was to heal her.

719
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,890
我不是来治愈她的 - 你是的
- I did not come to heal her. - Yes you did.

720
01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,540
我是来治愈你的
I came to heal you.

721
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:45,960
我?我不需要治愈
Me? I'm not the one who needs healing.

722
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,170
要我跟你说几遍啊
How many times do I have to tell you?

723
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,870
我妈妈才是...
My mum's the one who...

724
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:07,240
帮帮我
Help me.

725
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:16,980
是时候讲第四个故事了
It is time for the fourth tale.

726
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,650
不要 带我离开这里
No, no please. Get me out of here.

727
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:26,640
- 是时候展现你的噩梦了  - 我必须回到我妈妈身边
- It is time for your nightmare. - I need to get back to my mum.

728
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,890
她已经在这里了
She is already here.

729
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:34,830
不
No.

730
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:36,780
妈妈 离开那里
Mum, get out of there.

731
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:40,490
没事的 没什么好担心的
It is alright. There is nothing to worry about.

732
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:43,140
妈妈 快跑 求你了 快跑
Mum, run. Please, run.

733
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:46,180
妈妈
Mum.

734
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,430
妈妈
Mum.

735
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:01,600
康纳
Conor.

736
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:02,940
妈妈
Mum.

737
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:06,570
不
No.

738
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:08,580
康纳
Conor.

739
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:11,290
妈妈
Mum.

740
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:12,510
康纳
Conor.

741
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:13,660
妈妈
Mum.

742
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,620
- 别放手 - 不会的
- Don't let go. - I won't.

743
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:21,130
- 康纳  - 妈妈
- Conor. - Mama.

744
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:22,510
- 妈妈 - 康纳
- Mum. - Conor.

745
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:24,930
妈妈
Mum.

746
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:27,640
妈妈 不
Mum, no.

747
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:30,640
- 妈妈 不 -康纳
- Mum, no. - Conor.

748
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:34,060
妈妈
Mum.

749
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:38,410
妈妈
Mum.

750
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:42,450
不
No.

751
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:48,040
康纳
Conor.

752
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:50,760
- 这是第四个故事  - 快帮忙
- Here is the fourth tale. - Get help.

753
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,940
这是康纳・奥马利的真相
Here is the truth of Conor O'Malley.

754
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,180
- 妈妈 - 不
Mum. No.

755
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,890
- 康纳 - 这是你的噩梦
- Mum. - Here is your nightmare.

756
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:00,350
- 妈妈  - 康纳
- Mum. - Conor.

757
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,020
妈妈
Mum.

758
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:08,490
救我
Save me.

759
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:12,700
- 康纳  - 妈妈
- Conor. - Mama.

760
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:16,000
妈妈
Mama.

761
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,260
妈妈
Mama.

762
01:23:46,700 --> 01:23:49,060
这是我梦醒的时候
This is when I wake up.

763
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:53,090
我总是在这时醒来
This is when I always wake up.

764
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:56,010
故事还没讲出来
The tale is not yet told.

765
01:23:56,180 --> 01:23:58,320
让我离开这里 我得去见我妈妈
Get me out of here. I need to see my mum.

766
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,050
她再也不在这里了 康纳
She is no longer here, Conor.

767
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,500
她摔下去了 我没能拉住她
She fell. I could not hold onto her anymore.

768
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:04,230
康纳
Conor.

769
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,350
- 说出真心话  - 不
- Speak the truth. - No.

770
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,360
你要说出真心话 不然你永远没法离开这地方
You will speak the truth or you will never leave this place.

771
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:12,850
什么真心话 我不知道你什么意思
What truth? I do not know what you mean.

772
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,530
跟我讲第四个故事 康纳・奥马利
You must tell me the fourth tale, Conor O'Malley.

773
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:18,380
你必须跟我讲你的噩梦 以免太迟了
You must tell me your nightmare before it is too late.

774
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:21,690
告诉我 康纳 跟我说真心话
Yes. Tell me, Conor. Tell me the truth.

775
01:24:21,690 --> 01:24:25,890
- 我说的话 它会杀了我 - 你不说 它才会杀了你
- It will kill me if I do. - It will kill you if you do not.

776
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,300
说出真心话
Speak the truth.

777
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:29,260
- 不 - 真心话 康纳・奥马利
- No. - The truth, Conor O'Malley.

778
01:24:29,310 --> 01:24:31,270
- 跟我说真心话 孩子 - 不
- Tell me the truth, boy. - No.

779
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:36,340
- 说出真心话 - 不
- Speak the truth. - No.

780
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,550
说出真心话 孩子
Speak the truth, boy.

781
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:40,700
我希望这一切都结束
I want it to be over.

782
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,550
知道她快不行了 我承受不住啊
I can't stand knowing she will go.

783
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:00,890
我希望这一切都结束 我让她摔落了
I want it to be finished. I let her fall.

784
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,230
我让她死了
I let her die.

785
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:30,510
这样很勇敢 康纳
That was brave, Conor.

786
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:33,430
你终于说出来了
You finally said it.

787
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:36,920
为什么它没杀了我
Why didn't it kill me?

788
01:25:38,020 --> 01:25:40,310
我应该受到惩罚
I deserve punishment.

789
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:43,100
受到最重的惩罚
I deserve the worst.

790
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:45,530
是吗
Do you?

791
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:51,040
我一直都知道她会不行
I've known forever that she wasn't going to make it.

792
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:55,010
她总跟我说她会好转
She keep telling me she was getting better all the time...

793
01:25:56,220 --> 01:25:58,600
因为那是我想听的
because that's what I wanted to hear.

794
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:01,650
我相信了她
And I believed her.

795
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:05,170
而不是不相信
Except I didn't.

796
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:13,230
我开始思考我有多想要这一切都结束
And I started to think how much I wanted it to be over.

797
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,030
我没法...
I couldn't...

798
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:19,230
我没法承受这一切带给我的孤单
I couldn't stand how alone that would make me feel.

799
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:24,670
有一部分的你希望这一切都结束 即便这意味着失去她
Part of you wished it would end even if it meant losing her..

800
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:30,010
我放手了
I let her go.

801
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:33,180
我再也撑不住了
I couldn't hold on for longer...

802
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,690
但我总会对她放手
but I always let her go.

803
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:41,860
这就是你的真心话 康纳・奥马利
And that is your truth, Conor O'Malley.

804
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:47,100
不过我不想这样
I don't want it to be though.

805
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:49,360
现在这一切却成真了
Now it's for real.

806
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:52,080
现在她会死 而这是我的错
Now she's going to die and it's my fault.

807
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:55,600
这根本不是全部的真心话
Now, that is not the truth at all.

808
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,700
你只是希望结束痛苦 结束你自己的痛苦
You were merely wishing for an end of pain. Your own pain.

809
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:01,800
这是人类最原始的心愿
It is the most human wish there is.

810
01:27:01,900 --> 01:27:03,210
但我不是有意如此
I didn't mean it though.

811
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:06,280
你是的 但也不是
You did, but you also did not.

812
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,650
这两者怎么会同时存在
How can both be true?

813
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:15,620
王子怎么会既是杀人犯又受人爱戴呢
How can a prince be a murderer and beloved by his people?

814
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:19,660
药医师怎么会既有坏脾气又有合理的思想呢
How can an apothecary be evil tempted but right thinking?

815
01:27:19,730 --> 01:27:23,720
隐形人怎么会让自己被人看见却愈发孤单
How can invisible men make themselves lonelier by being seen?

816
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:27,130
不知道 对我来说 你的故事一点都说不通
I don't know. Your stories never made sense to me.

817
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:30,140
因为人类是复杂的动物
Because humans are complicated beasts.

818
01:27:30,310 --> 01:27:32,840
你清楚知道痛苦真相的同时 却又相信安慰人的谎言
You believe comforting lies, while knowing full well

819
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,570
这让谎言变得更为必要了
the painful truth that makes those lies necessary.

820
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:40,820
康纳 到头来重要的不是你想什么
In the end, Conor, it is not important what you think.

821
01:27:40,980 --> 01:27:44,870
重要是你做什么
It is only important what you do.

822
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:46,740
那我该做什么
So what do I do?

823
01:27:46,910 --> 01:27:50,080
做你刚才所做的 你说出了真心话
What you did just now. You speak the truth.

824
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,540
就这样?
That's all?

825
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,210
你觉得这很容易?
You think it's easy?

826
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:56,180
你宁愿死都不愿说
You were willing to die rather than speak it.

827
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:02,140
我好累 这一切让我好累
I'm so tired. So tired of all this.

828

睡吧 还有时间
Then sleep. There is time.

829
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,990
你确定吗 我得去见我妈妈
Are you sure? I need to see my mum.

830
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,030
- 今晚我们都会见到她 - 你也会在吗
- We will both see her tonight. - Will you be there?

831
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,110
没错
Yes.

832
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:16,890
那将是我的最终之行
It will be the final steps of my walking.

833
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,960
第四个故事会怎么结束
How does the fourth story end?

834
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,800

835
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:29,470

836

睡吧
Sleep.

837
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:09,280
谢天谢地 康纳 康纳
Thank God. Conor! Conor!

838
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:14,030
我找你快找疯了
I've been out of my mind trying to find you.

839
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:17,910
- 我还有些事得做 - 没时间了 现在必须走了
- There was something I had to do. - No time. We have to go now.

840
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,760
该死
Damn it.

841
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:49,100
外婆
Grandma.

842
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:52,580
抱歉
I'm sorry.

843
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:57,020
客厅和所有的事 我都很抱歉
About the living room and the everything.

844
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:01,140
没关系
It doesn't matter.

845
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:04,570
没关系
It doesn't matter.

846
01:30:18,310 --> 01:30:21,460
康纳 你和我...
You know, Conor. You and me...

847
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,730
我们很难相处 对吗
we're not the most natural fit, are we?

848
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,450
是的
No.

849
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,820
我觉得是很难
I guess not.

850
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:32,290
我也这么觉得
I guess not either.

851
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,990
但我们必须学会相处
But we're going to have to learn.

852
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,490
- 我知道 - 你真的知道 对吗
- I know. - You do know, don't you.

853
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:44,120
当然了
Of course you do.

854
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:51,660
不过我们有一个交集
But there is one thing we have in common.

855
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,720
你的妈妈
Your mum.

856
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:02,580
她是我们的交集
That's what we have in common.

857
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,860
没事
It's okay.

858
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:21,800
看来你找到他了

864
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,920
- 是吗 - 没错

865
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:52,980

Conor.

866
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,870
这里就是故事的结局

867

我好怕
I'm afraid.

868
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,140
你当然会怕
Of course you're afraid.

869
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:42,970
这很不容易 远远没那么容易
It will be hard. It will be more than hard.

870
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,720
但你会挺过去 康纳・奥马利
But you will make it through, Conor O'Malley.

871
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:50,330
你会待着吗
You'll stay?

872
01:33:51,170 --> 01:33:53,630
我就在这里
I will be right here.

873
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:03,760
我该做什么
What do I do?

874
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:09,850
现在剩下的就是说出最简单的真心话
Now all that is left is for you to speak the simplest truth of all.

875
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:33,300
我不希望你离开
I don't want you to go.

876

877
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:44,600
我不希望你离开
I don't want you to go.

878
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:52,750
第四个故事怎么结尾的
How does the fourth story end?

879

男孩紧紧地抱着他的母亲
It ends with a boy holding on tight to his mother.

880
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,900
这样子...
And by doing so...

881
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:03,060
他就终于能放手了
he can finally let her go.

882
01:36:45,340 --> 01:36:47,350
