00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,350
让我跟你讲个故事 关于我何时会走动起来
Let me tell you a tale of when I came walking.

139
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,190
让我跟你讲讲邪恶女王的结局
Let me tell you of the end of a wicked queen...

140
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,610
以及我是如果确保让她不再出现的
and how I made sure she was never seen again.

141
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,580
说吧
Go on then.

142
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,990
很好
Good.

143
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,940
你看到了什么
What do you see?

144
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,360
什么也没有 路上就树叶
Nothing. There are leafs in the way.

145
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,030
发挥你的想象力 康纳·奥马利
Use your imagination, Conor O'Malley.

146
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
你看到了什么
Now, what do you see?

147
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:47,630
- 我看到了火花  - 还有呢
- I see a spark. - Yes. And?

148
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,310
不是 这是水 是水彩画
No, it's water. It is watercolor.

149
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,210
继续看
Keep looking.

150
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,820
- 哇哦 - 确实会让人惊叹
- Wow. - Wow, indeed.

151
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,870
很久以前 这是一座城市 有道路 火车 汽车
Long ago, before this was a town with roads and trains and cars...

152
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,180
- 这里是一个王国 - 这里?
- this was a kingdom. - Here?

153
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,890
我们这里连乐购都没
We don't even have a Tesco.

154
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,630
这是一个繁荣的王国 有着一个睿智的国王
It was a prosperous kingdom with a wise king...

155
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,890
为他的人民取得了和平
With one peace for his people...

156
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,310
但和平是用某种代价换来的
but peace had come at a price.

157
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,980
国王失去了他全部的三个儿子
The king had lost all three of his sons in battle...

158
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,080
一个对战巨人而死
to giants

159
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,690
一个对战恶龙而死
to dragons

160
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,080
一个对战由大魔法师率领的军队而死
to armies of men led by great wizards.

161
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,160
这一切听起来像童话
This all sounds pretty fairytalish.

162
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,400
你要是听到一个男子被矛杀害时的惨叫就不会这么说了
You wouldn't say that if you heard the screams of a man through by a spear.

163
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,590
女王无法忍受丧子之痛
The queen wasn't able to bear the loss of all their three sons...

164
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:50,200
绝望而去 独留国王一人
Leaving the king alone in despair,

165
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,630
和他唯一剩下的继承人
with the company of his only remaining heir...

166
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,380
他的孤儿孙子
his orphaned grandson.

167
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,270
这孩子被抚养成了王子
The child was raised as a prince...

168
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,190
用他的勇敢和赤诚之心赢得了全国的爱戴
winning the love of the kingdom with his scaventry and good heart.

169
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,170
他的人民敬爱他
His people loved him.

170
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,010
我们未来的国王
Our future king.

171
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,860
他快成年时 他爷爷娶了新任妻子
He was nearly a man when his grandfather took a new wife.

172
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,870
可之后国王却病了 谣言开始蔓延
The king felt ill and rumor began to spread...

173
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,960
说她是一个邪恶的巫婆
that she was an evil witch...

174
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,550
说她给国王下了毒 想为她自己夺取王位
That she was bent on taking the throne by herself by poisoning the king.

175
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,900
几周后 国王死了
A few weeks later the king died.

176
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,000
而王子还年轻 不能登基为国王
The prince was too young to take the king's place...

177
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:06,090
因此根据法律 女王将统治一年
So, by law, the queen would rule for another year.

178
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,770
未来成了未知
The future was uncertain.

179
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,050
期间 王子有了心上人
The prince meanwhile had given away his heart.

180
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,560
她既漂亮又聪明 只是一个农夫的女儿
She was beautiful and smart, and though only a farmer's daughter...

181
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,940
全国都觉得他们很般配
the kingdom smiled on the match.

182
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,790
然而 女王更享受当女王的乐趣
The queen however, was rather enjoying being queen.

183
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,130
除了嫁给王子还有什么更好的办法保留王位呢
And what better way to remain so, than to marry the prince herself?

184
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
什么 这真恶心
What? That's disgusting.

185
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,970
- 她是他外婆 - 是他继任的外婆
- She was his grandmother. - Step grandmother...

186
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,730
但还是一个年轻漂亮的女人 可别忘了这点
and still a young, beautiful woman herself, don't forget.

187
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,740
王子可不喜欢这主意
The prince, however, didn't like the idea.

188
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,750
他带着农夫的女儿 骑马逃至夜深
He took the farmer's daughter, and they rode away into the night.

189
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,930
他们在紫杉树的树枝下停下休息
They stopped to rest under the branches of a yew tree.

190
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,610
那是你
That's you.

191
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,450
第二天早晨 王子醒来
The next morning the Prince awoke.

192
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:25,280
起来了 我的爱人 他说道
"Arise, my beloved" he said.

193
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,210
但农夫的女儿一动也不动
But the farmer's daughter did not steer...

194
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,620
而王子注意到了血
Which was when the prince noticed the blood.

195
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,590
血?
Blood?

196
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:37,220
有人在晚上杀了他的爱人
Someone had killed his beloved in the night.

197
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,390
什么
What?

198
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,730
女王 他哭泣道
"The Queen" he cried.

199
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,560
女王杀了我的新娘
"The queen has murdered my bride."

200
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:50,080
村民们满腔怒火 复仇心切 他们暴动了
The villagers, full of fury and vengeance, rose up at the crime.

201
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,330
我就在那时走动了起来
It was then that I came walking.

202
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,130
女王再也没有出现过
The queen was never seen again.

203
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,560
很好 她罪有应得
Good. She deserved it.

204
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,710
我外婆的事  我想你也帮不上忙
Now, I don't suppose you can help me with my grandma.

205
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,320
故事还没结束
The story is not yet finished.

206
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,190
我把女王带到了非常远的地方
I took the queen and carried her far enough away

207
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,980
人们永远不会找到她
so that the townspeople would never find her...

208
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,890
在海边的一个村庄里  她开始了新的生活
to a village by the sea, where she began a new life.

209
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,300
但她杀了农夫的女儿
But she killed the farmer's daughter.

210
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,960
你怎么能救一个杀人犯
How can you save a murderer?

211
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,200
你真的是一个怪物
You really are a monster.

212
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,730
我从没说是她杀了农夫的女儿
I never said she killed farmer's daughter.

213
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,590
我只说过王子那么说的
I only said that the prince said it was so.

214
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,040
那晚王子一直没入睡
The prince never fell asleep that night...

215
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,540
却等着农夫的女儿沉眠于睡梦中
but waited for the farmer's daughter to be lost in her dreams...

216
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,010
然后展开了他真正的计划
and then began his real plan.

217
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,180
什么
What?

218
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,900
他知道她的死会引发完全毁灭女王的星星之火
He knew her death would start a fire that would consume the queen entire.

219
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,320
这故事太糟糕了 是骗人的
That's a terrible story. And a cheat.

220
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,840
这是一个真实的故事
It's a true story.

221
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,560
很多真实的事物都像是骗人的
Many things that are true feel like a cheat.

222
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,200
王国得到了值得拥有的王子
Kingdoms get their princes they deserve.

223
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,730
农夫的女儿死于无辜
Farmers' daughters die for no reason.

224
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,860
而有时候女巫又应该被救
And sometimes witches merit saving.

225
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,480
你会觉得惊讶 实际上 经常有这种事
Quite often, actually. You'd be surprised.

226
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:47,800
所以好王子是一个杀人犯 而邪恶的女王到最后却不是女巫?
So the good prince was a murderer and the evil queen was no witch after all?

227
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,640
女王当然是女巫
No, the queen was most certainly a witch...

228
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,110
也可能制造更大的邪恶
and could well have been on her way to great evil.

229
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,780
谁知道呢
Who can say?

230
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,420
那你为什么要救她
Then why did you save her then?

231
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,410
因为她不是凶手
Because what she was not, was a murderer.

232
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,440
她没给国王下毒
She hadn't poisoned the king.

233
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,760
他只是年迈了
He had merely grown old.

234
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,770
王子有被抓起来吗
Did the prince ever get caught?

235
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,890
没有 他成了一个受人爱戴的国王
No. He became a much beloved king...

236
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,440
开心地统治着 直到死去
who ruled happily until the end of his long days.

237
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,990
没错
Oh yes.

238
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,920
我不明白
I don't get it.

239
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:25,780
谁是好人呢
Who is the good guy here?

240
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:28,790
不会一直有好人 康纳·奥马利...
There is not always a good guy, Conor O'Malley...

241
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,920
也不会一直有坏人
nor is there always a bad one.

242
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,460
很多人都介于这两者之间
Most people are somewhere in between.

243
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,080
这些怎么从外婆那把我救出来
So how is this all meant to save me from grandma?

244
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,960
不是从她那把你救出来
It is not her you need saving from.

245
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,740
故事总有两面性
There are always two sides to a story.

246
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,270
你们有多少人知道一句俗话
Now, how many of you know the saying:

247
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:12,860
棍棒和石头可能会打断我的骨头 但言词永远伤害不了我
"Stick and stones may break my bones, but words can never touch me?"

248
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:16,340
这样的话 下次要有人对你们说了什么 只要记住...
That way the next time someone says something to you just remember...

249
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,480
很好 你到家了
Good, you're home.

250
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,800
你妈妈在楼上 她想和你谈谈
Your mum's upstairs. She wants to talk to you.

251
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,200
- 什么 - 你爸周日会坐飞机过来
- What? - Your father's flying in on Sunday.

252
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,010
爸爸要来了? 从美国过来?
Dad's coming? From America?

253
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,600
去吧
Go on.

254
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,070
她等着呢
She's waiting.

255
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,070
打包好你的东西
And pack your bag.

256
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,170
你要来和我住几天
You're coming to stay with me for a few days.

257
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,520
去吧
Go on.

258
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
那棵树很赞
That tree is amazing.

259
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,280
在这里矗立了数千年
It's been here for thousands of years.

260
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,460
你觉得怎么样
What do you think?

261
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,320
我觉得外婆想把我变成蒂娜·特纳
I think Grandma is trying to turn me into Tina Turner.

262
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,240
她一定是她粉丝
She must be a fan.

263
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,190
我为什么要和外婆住
Why am I going to stay with grandma?

264
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,970
你要回医院吗
Are you going back to the hospital?

265
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,650
过来 康
Come here, Con.

266
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,000
上一次治疗没达到效果
This latest treatment is not doing what it's supposed to.

267
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,530
所以要调整下
So they're going to adjust it...

268
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,750
尝试别的
try something else.

269
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,300
-  就这样? - 就这样
- That's all? - That's all.

270
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,020
你确定吗
Are you sure?

271
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,680
确定
I'm sure.

272
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,850
因为...
Because...

273
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,230
你能跟我讲的
you can tell me, you know.

274
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,190
一切都会好的 康纳
Everything will be fine, Conor.

275
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,460
你会看到的
You'll see.

276
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,190
等等我们 康纳 你要去哪
Wait for us, Conor. Where are you going?

277
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,140
- 不要碰他  - 不要碰他?
- Don't touch him. - "Don't touch him?"

278
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,520
- 我给他脸上来一下怎么了 - 我说了别碰他
- With a punch to the face? - I said don't touch him.

279
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,370
奥马利和我有共识
O'Malley and I have an understanding.

280
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,440
我是唯一能碰他的人
I'm the only one who touches him.

281
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,880
对吗
Isn't that right?

282
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,980
告诉我
Now tell me.

283
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,050
为什么每次我转过身 你就在那看着我
Why is it that every time I turn around, you're there looking at me?

284
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,180
你不觉得很怪吗
Getting a bit odd, don't you think?

285
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,940
抱歉 这有点残酷
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

286
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,260
今天 生活没能如你所愿 对吧
Life isn't really going your way today, is it?

287
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,550
我要带人去看房子
I have a house to show.

288
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:39,070
我相信你会一个人待在这里等你父亲
I trust you alone here till your father shows up.

289
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,090
我现在不是五岁
I'm not five years old.

290
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,700
这是正确的时间
This is the correct time.

291
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:48,070
你手机 电脑上都不对
Not the one on your phone or on the computer,

292
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,860
就连新闻上的也不对
not even on the news.

293
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,320
这是我母亲的 你曾外婆的
That was my mother's, your great grandmother's.

294
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,240
完美无误地走了一百多年
Perfect timekeeping for over a hundred years.

295
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,240
康纳 过来收拾好
Conor! Pack up your rucksack.

296
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,780
我不希望你父亲觉得我让你生活在猪圈里
I don't want your father to think that I'm keeping you in a pigsty.

297
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,360
- 真是没什么机会 - 是的
- Not much shots of that. - No.

298
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,360
等你去了医院
When you go to the hospital,

299
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,120
你父亲可能不会注意到你母亲会有多累
your father may not notice how tired you mother's becoming.

300
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,380
所以我们必须确保他不会待太久
So we have to make sure he does not overstay his welcome.

301
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,090
这跟以前的事无关
Not that that's been a historically problem.

302
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,800
不能吃鸡蛋 这周你已经吃过两次了
No eggs. You already had eggs twice this week.

303
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,510
如果你饿了
If you are getting hungry,

304
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,170
冰箱里有菠菜你可以蒸
there is spinach in the fridge you can steam.

305
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,240
当然
Yeah, sure.

306
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,790
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything.

307
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,880
我会尽最大努力什么都不碰的
I will do my very best not to.

308
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,910
找到了
Get it.

309
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:46,550
爸爸
Dad.

310
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,430
你怎么样 康 你看上去很累
How are you doing, Con? You look tired.

311
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,720
我挺好
I'm fine.

312
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,720
妈妈在用新药 会让她好转
Mum's on this new medicine. And it will make her better.

313
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,770
她每两个星期去次医院
She goes to the hospital every two weeks...

314
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,810
他们把药物打入她的血流
and they pump the medicine into her bloodstream.

315
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,740
她会发病几天 然后好转
She's sick for the next few days, but she's better again.

316
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,380
- 你妹妹最近挺好  - 同父异母的妹妹
- Your sister is doing better. - Half sister.

317
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,510
是的
Yeah.

318
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,600
我想让你和她见见
I'd still love you to meet her.

319
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,100
我跟你外婆谈过了 想把你带去洛杉矶
I've been talking with your grandmother about bringing you out to LA.

320
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,820
- 你想让我去洛杉矶? - 是的
- You want me to come to LA? - Yeah absolutely.

321
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,250
- 你想去的吧 - 是的
- You'd like that wouldn't you? - Yeah.

322
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,590
我们去那过圣诞
We were thinking over Christmas,

323
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,580
回来正好能上学
that way you can be back here in time for school.

324
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,410
你意思是去玩咯
So you mean just for a visit then?

325
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,260
对啊 会很棒
Yeah, but it would be great.

326
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,090
我不想和外婆住
I don't want to live with grandma.

327
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,960
那是个老女人的房子 里面全是老女人的东西
It's an old lady's house with old ladies' things.

328
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,870
你什么都不能碰 哪里都不能坐
Can't touch anything or sit anywhere.

329
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,280
连胡闹两秒钟都不行
Can't even leave a mess for two seconds.

330
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,140
康纳 我知道 但...
Conor, I know, but...

331
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,320
我想要自己房子的房间 自己的东西
I want to have my own room in my my own house with my own things.

332
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,990
你来美国也不会有啊 康纳
Well, you wouldn't have that in America, Conor.

333
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,260
几乎没足够空间给我们三个了
There is barely enough room for the three of us.

334
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,970
- 我不管  - 康纳 听着...
- I do not care. - Conor listen...

335
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:40,270
- 她太严厉了 - 你的家人 你的生活 你的朋友...
- She's so strict. - Your family, your life, your friends...

336
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,140
- 她家像个博物馆 - 你的学校 一切都在这里 好吗
- Her house is like a museum. - Your school, all of it is here, okay?

337
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,990
把你带离这里是不公平的
It would be unfair to take you out of here.

338
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,920
- 对谁不公平 - 康纳
- Unfair to whom? - Conor.

339
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,390
你外婆好像还没回家
Doesn't look like your grandmother's home yet.

340
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,550
她有时会在我睡觉后再回医院去
She sometimes goes back to the hospital after I go to bed.

341
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,220
护士让她睡在一张椅子上
The nurses let her sleep in a chair.

342
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:12,090
你外婆不喜欢我
Hey, just because your grandmother

343
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,540
不代表她是个坏人
doesn't like me, doesn't make her a bad person.

344
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,310
她说你总有始无终
She says you're all start and no finish.

345
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,810
她有权表达她自己的看法
Well, she entitled to her own opinion.

346
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,140
你会待多久
How long are you here for?

347
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,970
能多久就多久
As long as I can be.

348
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,810
什么意思
What does that mean?

349
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:33,600
我们钱不多 美国的假期也不多
We don't have a lot of money and Americans don't get a lot of holiday.

350
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:36,380
- 你不是美国人  - 没错 但我住那了
- You're not an American. - No, but I live there now.

351
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:40,110
必要时 我会回来
I'll come back whenever I need to.

352
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:41,890
到了圣诞 你就来洛杉矶
And you're going to come to LA for Christmas.

353
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,570
不行 你那小房子没我空间了
God no, not in your cramped house where there is no room for me.

354
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,530
康纳
Conor

355
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,830
你干嘛要来
Why did you come?

356
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:58,930
康纳 别走
Conor wait.

357
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,930
康纳 明天见 好吗
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

358
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,330
还有很多时间
There's still loads of time.

359
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:59,590
这种破坏是相当值得同情的
As destruction goes, that was remarkably pitiful.

360
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,870
现在 我要跟你讲第二个故事
Now, I've come to tell you the second tale.

361
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,470
和上一个一样糟糕吗
Is it as bad as the last one?

362
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,390
是一个合理的毁灭结局 如果你是这意思的话
It ends with proper destruction, if that's what you mean.

363
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,750
是关于一个只为自己考虑的男人
It's about a man who thought only of himself...

364
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,460
一个理应慷慨却不慷慨的男人
a man who wasn't as generous as he should have been.

365
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,510
一个受到惨痛惩罚的男人
A man who gets punished very badly indeed.

366
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,510
故事都不是真实的
Stories aren't real though.

367
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,090
它们毫无帮助
They don't help anything.

368
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,550
故事都是狂野的生物 康纳·奥马利
Stories are wild creatures, Conor O'Malley.

369
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:26,430
你松开它们
When you let them lose,

370
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,560
谁知道它们会造成怎样的浩劫
who knows what havoc they might reek?

371
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,720
没错
Oh yes.

372
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,520
好吧
Okay.

373
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,820
说吧
Go on then.

374
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,240
很好
Good.

375
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:18,680
150年前
150 years ago...

376
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,080
未来降临
The future came.

377
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,000
工厂如野草般生长
Factories grew like weeds.

378
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,180
树木被砍 河水变黑
Trees fell, rivers blackened...

379
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:32,130
天空被烟灰弄得窒息
and the sky choked on smoke and ash.

380
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:37,580
但仍有绿色存在 如果你知道去哪看的话
But there was still green if you knew where to look.

381
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:41,620
在城市边缘住着一个固执的男人
On the edge of this town lived a stubborn man.

382
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,520
他拒绝改变
Who refused to change.

383
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,240
他仍遵循旧医学
He daunted on the old ways of medicine...

384
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:53,820
使用草药 树皮以及用树叶和浆果制成的混合物
herbs and barks and concoctions brewed from berries and leafs.

385
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,860
村民们称他为药医师
Villagers ever only called him the apothecary.

386
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,700
- 什么 - 药医师
- The what? - The apothecary.

387
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:01,970
药师的旧称
An old-fashioned name for 'pharmacist'.

388
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,610
你怎么不直接这么说
Why didn't you just say?

389
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,520
这村里还有个年轻牧师
There was also a young parson in this village,

390
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,170
很有见识 也很和善
an enlightened man and a kind one...

391
00:47:15,170 --> 00:47:18,720
一心只想着教区
who just wanted the very best for his congregation.

392
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:22,860
他布道反对药医师的旧医学
He preached against the apothecary's use of the old ways...

393
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:26,020
而药医师的坏脾气和贪婪
and the apothecary's foul temper and greed...

394
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:30,050
让那些布道更为人所接受了
made certain some of these sermons fell on eager ears.

395
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:38,770
他想尽可能地帮助社区
Much as he tried to keep on helping the community...

396
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:44,270
但他的生意一落千丈 这让他愤愤不平
his business sank which only made him grow bitter

397
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,140
牧师的住所也有一棵紫杉树
On the parsonage's ground there also lived a yew tree.

398
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,180
那是你所在的地方
That's the hill where you live.

399
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,220
紫杉树是最重要的治愈之树
The yew tree is the most important of the healing trees.

400
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,830
为什么
Why?

401
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:02,520
它的果实和树皮 会弹奏 会燃烧 有着生命的悸动
Its berries, its bark, they brum and burn and twist with life.

402
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,640
能治愈几乎所有疾病
That can cure almost any ailment.

403
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,150
真的吗 什么都能?
Really? Anything?

404
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:11,390
什么都能 只要药医师混合得对
Anything that can be cured if mixed by the right apothecary.

405
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:23,120
药医师很想要这紫杉树
The apothecary wanted the yew tree very badly.

406
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,150
但要想获得这些东西 就不得不砍倒它
But in order to harvest these things, he would have to cut it down.

407
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,770
这是牧师所不允许的
And this, the parson would not allow.

408
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,890
牧师有两个女儿  是他的生命之光
The parson had two daughters who were the light of his life.

409
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,350
他是一个充满关爱的父亲 为了她们会给予一切
He was a caring, loving father who would've done anything for their sake.

410
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,770
但有一天 两个小女孩都被可怕的疾病击溃了
But one day both little girls were struck by a terrible sickness...

411
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,760
而牧师做的一切都没帮助
and nothing the parson did helped.

412
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,500
现代医学没有治疗办法 祷告也没用 什么都没用
No cure from the more modern doctors, no prayer, nothing.

413
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,600
除了找药医师 别无选择
There was no choice but to approach the apothecary.

414
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,810
你愿帮助我的女儿们吗 牧师乞求道
"Will you not help my daughters?". The parson begged.

415
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,570
你愿拯救两个无辜的女孩吗
"Will you not save two innocent girls?"

416
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:23,570
我为什么要救呢 药医师说
"Why should I?". Said the apothecary.

417
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:27,120
你的布道毁了我的事业
"You have driven away my business with your preachings...

418
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,350
你拒绝把紫杉树给我 那是最好的治愈之源
and you have refused me the yew tree, my best source of healing".

419
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,210
紫杉树你拿去吧 牧师说
"You may have the yew tree," said the parson.

420
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,100
你会宣讲让你受益的事
"I will preach sermons in your favour.

421
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,400
只要你救我女儿 我什么都愿意做
I will do anything only you will save my daughters."

422
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,600
你愿放弃你所信仰的一切吗 药医师说
"Would you give up everything you believe in?". Said the apothecary.

423
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,440
如果那样能救她们 我就愿意放弃一切
"If it would save them, I would give up everything."

424
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:53,440
那我没什么能帮你的了
"Then there's nothing I can do to help you."

425
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,700
第二天 牧师的两个女儿都死了
The very next day both of the parson's daughters died.

426
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,700
- 什么  - 那天晚上我走动了起来
- What? - And that night I came walking.

427
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,980
很好 他理应受到惩罚
Good. He deserves all the punishment he gets.

428
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,880
没错  那时刚过午夜
Indeed. It was shortly after midnight...

429
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,570
牧师家被我从底部往上撕裂开来
That I tore the house of the parson from its very foundations.

430
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:37,600
牧师? 你在说什么
The parson? What are you talking about?

431
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:39,630
药医师才是坏人
The apothecary is the evil one.

432
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,520
他贪婪粗鲁 但他仍是个治疗者
He was greedy and rude, but he was still a healer.

433
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,850
而牧师 他是什么呢
The parson, what was he?

434
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,570
一个没有信仰的信徒
A man of faith without faith.

435
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,310
信念是半个救治方式
Belief is half of all healing.

436
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,910
相信治疗方式 相信等待着的未来
Belief in the cure, belief in the future that awaits.

437
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,760
信仰是宝贵的
Your belief is precious...

438
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,520
所以你应该留意你信仰什么 你信仰谁
so you must be careful where you put it and in whom.

439
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:18,240
告诉我 康纳·奥马利 下一个我要毁掉什么
Tell me, Conor O'Malley, what shall I destroy next?

440
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,700
- 什么 - 这很爽 我向你保证 快
- What? - It is most satisfying, I can assure you.Come on.

441
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,570
告诉我 我要毁掉什么
Tell me. What should I destroy?

442
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,700
打坏烟囱
Smack the chimney?

443
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:29,810
烟囱
The chimney.

444
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,820
下面呢
Next?

445
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,830
扔掉他们的床
Throw away their beds.

446
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:41,590
打破家具
Smash the furniture.

447
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,070
打破窗户
Break the windows.

448
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,850
窗户?
Windows.

449
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,270
你来亲自动手吧
Break them yourself.

450
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,740
来吧
Come one.

451
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,210
再用力些  康纳·奥马利
Harder, Conor O'Malley.

452
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:16,030
再用力些
Come on. Harder.

453
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,280
就是这样
That's it.

454
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,870
没错
Yes.

455
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:23,440
感觉很棒吧
Feels good doesn't it?

456
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:24,830
很好
Yeah.

457
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:17,900
外婆
Grandma.

458
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:20,060
外婆
Grandma.

459
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,560
外婆 别这样
Grandma, please...

460
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,970
外婆
Grandma.

461
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,320
我听说你喜欢吃煎蛋
I heard you like them sunny side up.

462
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:11,150
-  你在这里干嘛 - 你觉得呢
- What are you doing here? - What do you think?

463
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,620
你外婆今天一大早就打电话来了
Your grandmother called very early this morning.

464
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,850
她去医院看你妈妈了
She's gone to the hospital to see your mum.

465
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:23,880
你妈妈恶化了 康
Your mum's had a bad turn, Con.

466
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,980
我要见她
I need to see her.

467
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:30,820
我们到时候看今天的结果
We'll see what happens today, and maybe you can

468
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,810
也许你下午能去看她一会儿
visit for a little while this afternoon.

469
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,540
我知道你有多难过
I can see how upset you are.

470
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:47,850
我不是故意的 我不知道怎么回事
I didn't mean to. I don't know what happened.

471
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:52,140
- 在海上有更糟的事  - 什么意思
- Worse things happen at sea. - What do you mean?

472
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,170
你要惩罚我吗
Aren't you going to punish me?

473
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,590
这有什么意义
What could possibly be the point in that?

474
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:08,470
我必须说 这真的是令人惊讶
I got to say champ, this is really just amazingly thorough.

475
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,890
一个被掩埋的宝藏
Oh, a buried treasure.

476
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,070
这一定是我第一次搬走时
These must be those home movies that your mother

477
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,790
你妈寄我的家庭电影
used to send when I first moved away.

478
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,580
你为什么搬走
Why did you move away?

479
00:57:27,870 --> 00:57:29,970
我们当时还年轻
We were young.

480
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,030
很年轻 我们有很大的梦想
Too young, you know? We had big dreams, and...

481
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:36,350
- 什么样的梦想 - 你妈妈想去艺术学校
- What kind of dreams? - Your mother wanted to go to art college.

482
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:43,660
- 是吗 - 没错 她没去 但她想去
- Really? - Yeah. She didn't go, but she wanted to.

483
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,030
发生了什么事
What happened?

484
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,980
因为妈妈怀了我
Because mum got pregnant with me.

485
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,200
你妈妈从没后悔有了你 你是唯一的好消息
Mum never regretted having you. You were only ever good news.

486
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:57,700
我很清楚 因为她后悔一件事 就是嫁给了我
And I know that for a fact, because the one thing she regretted was marrying me.

487
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,320
- 那她为什么要嫁给你 - 因为我帅
- Why did she marry you then? - Because I'm handsome.

488
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:11,290
你妈妈很棒 现在还是 当时我们恋爱了
Your mum was amazing. And she still is. And we were in love.

489
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,450
我还爱她 但你会知道...
I mean, I still love her. But you will see that...

490
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,810
爱是不够的 它没法带你度过一生
love isn't enough. It doesn't carry you through.

491
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,800
所以你后来就没有幸福过
So you didn't get happily ever after.

492
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,290
没错 但这就是生活
No, but that's life, you know?

493
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:35,090
多数情况就是变得更糟了 但没关系
Most of it just get messier after. And that's alright.

494
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:42,170
我很高兴你变得像她
Even I'm happy you turned out like her.

495
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,390
钱德勒夫人
Mrs Chandler.

496
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,310
教育很重要
Education is really important!

497
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,910
我又不是不知道 我各方面都很节省了
You're telling me now what to do. I'm pulled in every direction.

498
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,330
那你是要让他不上学了吗
Are you going to take him out of school then?

499
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:53,930
谢谢
Thank you.

500
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,930
我想找点吃的 你呢 孩子
I'm looking for something to eat. You want something, kid?

501
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,430
别叫我孩子
Stop calling me 'kid'.

502
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,980
好的
Fair enough.

503
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,310
对不起 丽兹
I'm sorry, Lizzie.

504
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,320
穿西装的那男人是谁
Who was that man in a suit?

505
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:22,000
只是...
Just...

506
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,550
没什么
Nothing.

507
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,500
- 今天上午发生了什么  - 没什么
- What happened this morning? - Nothing.

508
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,890
没事的
It's fine.

509
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,360
我只是有点不好的反应
I had a bit of a bad reaction.

510
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,650
但他们还会做一个尝试
There's one more thing they're going to try,

511
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,950
那种药的效果真的很好
and it's a medicine that's had some really good results.

512
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:49,180
他们为什么不一开始就试呢
Why didn't they try it in the first place?

513
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,560
因为你用了别的东西
Because this is something you take when the other

514
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,130
然而效果不如他们所想的那么好
stuff hasn't worked the way they wanted it to.

515
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,070
意思太迟了吗
Does that mean it's too late?

516
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:00,390
当然不是太迟的意思
No of course it doesn't mean it's too late.

517
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,170
你确定吗
Are you sure?

518
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,100
我相信我说的每一个字
I believe every word I say.

519
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,010
信念是半个救治方式
Belief is half of all healing.

520
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,540
相信治疗方式 相信等待着的未来
Belief in the cure, belief in the future that awaits.

521
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,600
是啊
Yeah.

522
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:29,120
你还记得我一直说的那棵树吗
And you know that tree I'm always going on about?

523
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,580
记得
Yeah.

524
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,440
这药是拿那种树做的
Well, this drug is made from trees like that.

525
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:35,930
- 是吗 - 没错
- It is? - Yeah.

526
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:37,460
真的?
Seriously?

527
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,810
一直以来 我们本能出去砍掉它
All this time we could have gone out there and just chopped it down.

528
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,850
但那一棵不行
But not that one.

529
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,390
那一棵是我们的朋友
That one's our friend.

530
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,160
你在哪
Where are you?

531
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,530
我在这
I'm here.

532
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,710
你能让我妈妈好转吗
Can you do it? Can you make my mum better?

533
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,880
你母亲能被治愈的话 紫杉树会那么做
If your mother can be healed, the yew tree will do it.

534
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:48,050
- 所以是可以咯? - 你还是不知道你为什么召唤我
- So that's a yes? - You still don't know why you called me.

535
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,800
我没有召唤你 就算有也是为了我妈妈
I didn't call you. And even if I did, it was obviously for mum.

536
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,270
- 是吗 - 还能怎么样
- Was it? - What else?

537
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,780
那些蠢故事毫无意义
To listen to idiotic stories that make no sense.

538
01:02:55,790 --> 01:03:00,840
现在还不是讲第三个故事的时候 但快了 在那之后
It is not yet time for the third tale. But soon. And after that...

539
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,640
你要告诉我你的故事 康纳·奥马利
you will tell me your story, Conor O'Malley.

540
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,080
不
No.

541
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,420
不 不是这个 这只是一场噩梦
No, not this. That's just a nightmare.

542
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:12,050
别这样
No, please.

543
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,600
那不是真的 那不过是一场噩梦
That's not my truth. That's just a nightmare.

544
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:21,940
然而这会在第三个故事之后发生
Nevertheless, this will happen after the third tale.

545
01:03:22,110 --> 01:03:24,310
我想知道我妈妈会怎么样
I want to know what's going to happen with my mum.

546
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:28,260
别浪费你被给予的宝贵时间
Do not waste the precious time that is given you.

547
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:31,250
等等 你要去哪
Wait. Where are you going?

548
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:34,050
如果你是治愈之树 那我需要你去救治
If you are a tree of healing, then I need you to heal.

549
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,130
我会的
And so I shall.

550
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:13,520
康纳 我会回来的 我保证 你来洛杉矶过圣诞
Conor, I'll come back. I promise, alright. And you'll come to LA for Christmas.

551
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:16,090
我不想圣诞就留妈妈一个人
I wont leave mum alone for Christmas.

552
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:19,530
- 康纳你妈妈用的这个药... - 会让她好转
- Conor this medicine your mum's taking... - Is going to make her well.

553
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,590
康纳 很可能不会
No, Conor, it probably isn't.

554
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,790
- 会的 - 这是最后一博了 儿子
- Yes it is. - No, it's a last stage effort, son.

555
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:26,370
会治愈她的 我知道的
It will heal her. I know it.

556
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,650
这就是它来的原因 一定是的
It is the reason it came. It has to be.

557
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,400
- 什么来的原因 - 怪物
- Reason what came? - The monster.

558
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,490
- 康纳  什么  - 它总会12点07分出现
- Conor, what? - It comes to 12h07.

559
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,040
起初我以为这是一个梦 但它不是
At first I thought it was a dream, but there is always...

560
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,770
康纳 别说了 那是个梦
Stop. It is a dream.

561
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,260
只是个梦 我很抱歉你得面对这件事
That's all it is. I'm sorry you have to face this...

562
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:43,580
但你得勇敢起来
but you have to be brave.

563
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,030
明白吗
Do you understand?

564
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,670
来吧
Come on.

565
01:04:50,690 --> 01:04:52,090
来吧
Come on.

566
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,480
我会尽快回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

567
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:07,580
如果不够快怎么办
What if it's not fast enough?

568
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,160
康纳 听着
Conor, listen...

569
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:17,630
- 没事的 - 什么没事的
- It's okay. - What is okay?

570
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:19,250
只是...
Just...

571
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,440
你不用尽快
You don't have to.

572
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,140
看到没
Look. Do you see it?

573
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,140
看到了吗 你能挥手吗
Do you see it? Can you wave?

574
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:37,150
你能看到他吗
Can you see him?

575
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:41,740
向外婆挥手
And then we wave to grandma.

576
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,990
嗨 外婆
Hello grandma.

577
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,410
康 向外婆和妈妈打招呼
Con, you can say hello to grandma and mum?

578
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,750
嗨 外婆
Hello Grandma.

579
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,170
这就对了
Here we go.

580
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:57,180
妈妈已经听过这个很多次了
Mum has heard this many times.

581
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,080
你准备好了吗
Are you ready?

582
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,420
康 过来
Con, come sit here.

583
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,250
康 看啊
Con, look.

584
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,090
- 你好 外婆  - 妈妈...
- Hello grandma. - Mama...

585
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:09,260
妈妈
- one... - Mama.

586
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,710
很好
There we go.

587
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,350
外婆 我们在画画
We are doing your picture, grandma.

588
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:17,360
然后混在一起
And then mix it together.

589
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:19,030
这是什么颜色
What color is that?

590
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:20,930
棕色
Brown.

591
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,370
- 好看又幸运的棕色 - 棕色
- It is a nice lodgy brown. - Brown.

592
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,380
- 但这里有棕色了 - 没错
- But we have brown here. - That's true.

593
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,840
看到了吗
What can you see?

594
01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:35,010
那是什么 它们是什么
What is that? What are those?

595
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,180
你觉得这些是什么
What do you... What are these?

596
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:40,400
- 眼睛 - 眼睛 没错
- Eyes. - Eyes. That's it.

597
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:43,150
生活永远都在眼睛之中
Life is always in the eyes.

598
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,240
如果你懂的话
If you get that...

599
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,820
你会是个出色的艺术家
you will be a proper artist.

600
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,150
很好
Yes.

601
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:54,290
看啊
Look.

602
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,300
就是这么画眼睛
This is how we draw the eyes in...

603
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:00,540
这里是眼睛捕捉映像的地方
because this is where the eyes catch the reflection.

604
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:05,440
在眼睛里 我们能看到生活 看见没
There we see the life in the eyes. See that?

605
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:10,320
再来一次 这就是生活
Do it again. It's life.

606
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,750
用铅笔吧
Maybe if we take a pencil...

607
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:20,590
然后在那里画
and you can draw on that...

608
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:23,010
想试试吗
Do you want to try it?

609
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:25,390
让我看看
Show me how you do it.

610
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,250
看 康
Look, Con.

611
01:08:41,410 --> 01:08:46,420
那是他的头发 这是他的眉毛
That's his hair and this is his eyebrow.

612
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,550
这边是眼睛
There's the eyes.

613
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:53,470
看 这是他的嘴
Oh look, there's his mouth.

614
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,310
这是他的嘴 他非得愤怒
There's his mouth. He is very angry.

615
01:08:57,480 --> 01:08:59,650
看到了吗
Can you see?

616
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,400
看啊
Look at that.

617
01:09:02,970 --> 01:09:07,190
然后我们画张脸
And then we start to make a face.

618
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,250
然后
And then...

619
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,670
这就是我们的怪物
there's our monster.

620
01:09:11,830 --> 01:09:13,420
这就是怪物
There's the monster.

621
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:16,180
看这怪物
Look at the monster.

622
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,610
慢点
Very slowly.

623
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,200
就是这样
That's it.

624
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:02,120
没错 好的
That's it, okay.

625
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:15,650
今早是30分钟的考试
Okay, so 30 minutes exam this morning...

626
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:19,650
考的是过去两周我们都做过的东西
and this is all the stuff we've been doing for the last two weeks.

627
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:24,290
复习过就不会有意外
So if you've done your revision, there will be no surprises.

628
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,100
你们马上就得合上书本
So in a moment I'm going to ask you to turn your pages over.

629
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:38,180
下面30分钟都不准说话 要保持完全安静
There will be no talking for the next 30 minutes. I want total silence...

630
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,480
因为你们要用的是大脑而不是嘴
because you are going to use your brains, not your mouths.

631
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,900
30分钟...
So 30 minutes...

632
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:47,740
现在开始 祝你们好运
Starting now. Good luck.

633
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,940
在这么久之后
I think I've finally figures you out.

634
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,510
我想我总算搞懂你了
After all this time.

635
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,100
你只是想让人对你印象深刻
All you're looking for is someone kick your head in.

636
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:26,770
但你知道吗
But you know what?

637
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,940
我不再是那个家伙了
I'm not that guy anymore.

638
01:11:36,010 --> 01:11:38,130
再见 奥马利
Goodbye, O'Malley.

639
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,920
我再也不会看见你
I no longer see you.

640
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:44,250
现在你对我来说是隐形的
Now you're invisible to me too.

641
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,610
希望你妈妈会好起来
I hope your mum gets better.

642
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,390
你怎么这么慢
What took you so long?

643
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,710
是时候讲第三个故事了
It's time for the third tale.

644
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:23,840
曾经有个隐形人
There was once an invisible man...

645
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:27,020
厌倦了不被人看见
who was grown tired of being unseen.

646
01:12:27,190 --> 01:12:30,990
实际上 他不是隐形的
It was not that he was actually invisible.

647
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:36,450
只是人们习惯于无视他
It was just the people had become used to not seeing him.

648
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:41,460
有一天 隐形人再也受不了了
One day, the invisible man couldn't stand it anymore.

649
01:12:41,620 --> 01:12:46,380
他好奇如果没人看见你
He kept wondering, if no one sees you...

650
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:50,050
那你真的存在吗
Are you really there at all?

651
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,060
隐形人做了什么
What did the invisible man do?

652
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,660
他召唤了怪物
He called for a monster.

653
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:18,820
我都不知道跟你说什么好 奥马利
I don't even know what to say to you, O'Malley.

654
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:23,930
你把他送进了医院
You sent him to hospital.

655
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,850
他父母威胁要起诉
His parents are threatening to sue.

656
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:30,070
- 那不是我 - 什么
- It wasn't me. - What was that?

657
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:32,530
那不是我
Wasn't me.

658
01:13:35,530 --> 01:13:39,000
我不是隐形的
I'm not invisible. I'm not invisible.

659
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:41,810
如果你想被人注意 奥马利 那可不是最好的办法
If you want to be seen, O'Malley, this is not the best way.

660
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:46,550
我不是隐形的 你听见了吗
I'm not invisible. Did you hear me? I'm not invisible.

661
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:51,400
根据学校规定 你会被立即开除
School rules dictate immediately exclusion.

662
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:57,810
但我是一名教师 我怎么可能做得到
But how could I do that and consider myself any kind of a teacher?

663
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,530
回去上课吧
Go back to class.

664
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:04,860
我们改日再谈 今天就不谈了
We will talk about this one day, but not today.

665
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,740
你不惩罚我?
You're not punishing me?

666
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:12,330
这有什么意义
What could possibly be the point?

667
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:27,690
我来给你们举个健康情绪的例子
Well, let me give you an example of emotional wellness.

668
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:31,090
你们知道有时说不是有多困难 对吗
You know how difficult it is sometimes to say no. Right?

669
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:37,620
而当你们终于有勇气说出口时 感觉会很棒 这是为什么呢
And how good it feels when you finally find the courage to say it anyway. Why is that?

670
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,330
你有空吗
Do you have a moment?

671
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,170
怎么了
Hoi, wat is is?

672
01:14:45,330 --> 01:14:47,840
我们刚接到医院电话
We just got a call from the hospital.

673
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:53,050
恐怕康纳的母亲快不行了 他们想要他过去
I am afraid that Conor's mother is not going to make it. They want him to come there.

674
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,440
你不一起吗
Aren't you coming?

675
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:27,670
我就待在这
I'll be right here.

676
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:03,620
你的手怎么了
What did you do to your hands?

677
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,450
是要谈话 对吗
It's the talk isn't it?

678
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:15,830
最近每个人都想谈话
Everybody wants to have a talk lately.

679
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:21,670
康
Con...

680
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:23,910
看着我
Look at me.

681
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:31,420
今早我跟医生谈过话
I spoke to the doctor this morning.

682
01:16:37,470 --> 01:16:40,650
新的治疗方式没作用
The new treatment it's... it's not working.

683
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:44,580
紫杉树的那个?
The one from the yew tree?

684
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,560
是的
Yeah.

685
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:52,030
怎么会没作用
How can it not be working?

686
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:56,310
一切都发生太快 超出了他们的预想
Things just happen fast. Faster than they thought.

687
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:59,730
- 怎么会没作用呢 - 不知道
- How can it not be working? - I don't know.

688
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,020
它必须要有作用
It has to.

689
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,530
那现在怎么说 下一步怎么治疗
So what happens now? What's going to be the next treatment?

690
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:19,790
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

691
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:26,510
我一生中从没这么抱歉过
I've never been more sorry about anything in my life.

692
01:17:36,910 --> 01:17:39,300
你生气的话 也没事 康
It's okay that you're angry, Con.

693
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:42,390
真的
It really is.

694
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:47,760
我也很气自己告诉你真相
I'm pretty angry too, to tell you the truth.

695
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,340
但是 康纳...
But Con...

696
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,450
康纳 你在听吗
Con, are you listening?

697
01:18:01,770 --> 01:18:03,960
有一天...
One day...

698
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:09,610
如果你回想这件事 为自己的生气而感到难过
if you look back and you feel bad for being so angry...

699
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:15,470
你甚至可以向我倾诉 但你必须清楚 这没关系
you couldn't even speak to me, you have to know that was okay...

700
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,720
我就知道你会难过
That I knew.

701
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:33,480
因为你要对我说的 不用你说出口 我就已经知道了
Because I know everything you need to tell me without you having to say it out loud.

702
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,070
如果你要摔东西
And if you need to break things...

703
01:18:42,870 --> 01:18:45,760
那就去摔吧
By God you break them.

704
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:49,270
使劲摔
Break them good and hard.

705
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:52,670
我会伴你左右 康
And I'll be right there, Con.

706
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:07,050
我希望我能有100年
I wish I had a hundred years.

707
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,980
能照顾你的100年
A hundred years I could give to you.

708
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:45,380
醒醒
Wake up.

709
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:49,330
醒醒
Wake up.

710
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,930
醒醒
Wake up.

711
01:19:55,090 --> 01:20:00,030
我不管现在是几点 你个骗子 醒醒
I don't care what time it is. You lied. Wake up.

712
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,490
醒醒
Wake up.

713
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,770
现在我需要你
I need you now.

714
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:23,470
- 你再这样只会让自己更痛苦 - 没起作用
- You are doing yourself more pain. - It did not work.

715
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:26,590
你说紫杉树会让她好起来 但并没有
You said the yew tree would make her better, but it did not.

716
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,590
让她好起来
Make her better.

717
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,280
是你召唤我的 康纳·奥马利
You're the one who called me, Conor O'Malley.

718
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:36,820
如果是我召唤你的 那就是为了救她 为了治好她
If I called you, it was to save her. It was to heal her.

719
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:39,800
我不是来治愈她的 - 你是的
- I did not come to heal her. - Yes you did.

720
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:41,450
我是来治愈你的
I came to heal you.

721
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:44,870
我?我不需要治愈
Me? I'm not the one who needs healing.

722
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:48,080
要我跟你说几遍啊
How many times do I have to tell you?

723
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:50,780
我妈妈才是...
My mum's the one who...

724
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:06,150
帮帮我
Help me.

725
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:15,890
是时候讲第四个故事了
It is time for the fourth tale.

726
01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:21,560
不要 带我离开这里
No, no please. Get me out of here.

727
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:25,050
- 是时候展现你的噩梦了  - 我必须回到我妈妈身边
- It is time for your nightmare. - I need to get back to my mum.

728
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,920
她已经在这里了
She is already here.

729
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,560
不
No.

730
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,270
妈妈 离开那里
Mum, get out of there.

731
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:36,220
我没事
I'm fine!

732
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:39,100
没事的 没什么好担心的
It is alright. There is nothing to worry about.

733
01:21:39,170 --> 01:21:41,650
妈妈 快跑 求你了 快跑
Mum, run. Please, run.

734
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:44,690
妈妈
Mum.

735
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,940
妈妈
Mum.

736
01:21:58,410 --> 01:21:59,210
康纳
Conor.

737
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:01,450
妈妈
Mum.

738
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,080
不
No.

739
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,090
康纳
Conor.

740
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,260
妈妈
Mum.

741
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,220
康纳
Conor.

742
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:12,180
妈妈
Mum.

743
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,530
- 别放手 - 不会的
- Don't let go. - I won't.

744
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,730
- 康纳  - 妈妈
- Conor. - Mama.

745
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:22,600
妈妈
Mum.

746
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,690
妈妈 不
Mum, no.

747
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,860
妈妈 不
Mum, no.

748
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:30,570
康纳
Conor.

749
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:32,970
妈妈
Mum.

750
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,320
妈妈
Mum.

751
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:40,830
不
No.

752
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:46,670
康纳
Conor.

753
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,670
- 这是第四个故事  - 快帮忙
- Here is the fourth tale. - Get help.

754
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,850
这是康纳·奥马利的真相
Here is the truth of Conor O'Malley.

755
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,090
- 妈妈 - 不
Mum. No.

756
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,800
- 康纳 - 这是你的噩梦
- Mum. - Here is your nightmare.

757
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,970
- 妈妈  - 康纳
- Mum. - Conor.

758
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:09,530
妈妈
Mama.

759
01:23:10,280 --> 01:23:11,530
妈妈
Mama.

760
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:14,320
妈妈
Mama.

761
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:21,290
妈妈
Mama.

762
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,970
这是我梦醒的时候
This is when I wake up.

763
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:52,000
我总是在这时醒来
This is when I always wake up.

764
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,820
故事还没讲出来
The tale is not yet told.

765
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,830
让我离开这里 我得去见我妈妈
Get me out of here. I need to see my mum.

766
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,560
她再也不在这里了 康纳
She is no longer here, Conor.

767
01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:01,410
她摔下去了 我没能拉住她
She fell. I could not hold onto her anymore.

768
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,140
康纳
Conor.

769
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:06,260
- 说出真心话  - 不
- Speak the truth. - No.

770
01:24:06,270 --> 01:24:09,270
你要说出真心话 不然你永远没法离开这地方
You will speak the truth or you will never leave this place.

771
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,550
什么真心话 我不知道你什么意思
What truth? I do not know what you mean.

772
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:14,440
跟我讲第四个故事 康纳·奥马利
You must tell me the fourth tale, Conor O'Malley.

773
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,290
- 你必须跟我讲你的噩梦 以免太迟了 - 不行
- You must tell me your nightmare before it is too late. -No.

774
01:24:17,450 --> 01:24:20,600
告诉我 康纳 告诉我真心话
Yes. Tell me, Conor. Tell me the truth.

775
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,430
- 我说的话 它会杀了我 - 你不说 它才会杀了你
- It will kill me if I do. - It will kill you if you do not.

776
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,140
不行
NO.

777
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,810
说出真心话
Speak the truth.

778
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:28,170
- 不行 - 真心话 康纳·奥马利
- No. - The truth, Conor O'Malley.

779
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:30,180
- 告诉我真心话 孩子 - 不行
- Tell me the truth, boy. - No.

780
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:35,250
- 说出真心话 - 不行
- Speak the truth. - No.

781
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:37,460
说出真心话 孩子
Speak the truth, boy.

782
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:39,610
我希望这一切都结束
I want it to be over.

783
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:55,460
知道她快不行了 我承受不住啊
I can't stand knowing she will go.

784
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:59,800
我希望这一切都结束​​ 我让她摔落了
I want it to be finished. I let her fall.

785
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:02,140
我让她死了
I let her die.

786
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,420
这样很勇敢 康纳
That was brave, Conor.

787
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:32,340
你终于说出来了
You finally said it.

788
01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:35,830
为什么它没杀了我
Why didn't it kill me?

789
01:25:36,930 --> 01:25:39,220
我应该受到惩罚
I deserve punishment.

790
01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:42,010
受到最重的惩罚
I deserve the worst.

791
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:44,440
是吗
Do you?

792
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:49,950
我一直都知道她会不行
I've known forever that she wasn't going to make it.

793
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:53,920
她总跟我说她会好转
She keep telling me she was getting better all the time...

794
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:57,510
因为那是我想听的
because that's what I wanted to hear.

795
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,560
我相信了她
And I believed her.

796
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,080
而不是不相信
Except I didn't.

797
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:12,140
我开始思考我有多想要这一切都结束
And I started to think how much I wanted it to be over.

798
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,940
我没法...
I couldn't...

799
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:18,140
我没法承受这一切带给我的孤单
I couldn't stand how alone that would make me feel.

800
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,580
有一部分的你希望这一切都结束 即便这意味着失去她
Part of you wished it would end even if it meant losing her..

801
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:28,920
我放手了
I let her go.

802
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:32,090
我再也撑不住了
I couldn't hold on for longer...

803
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:35,600
但我总会对她放手
but I always let her go.

804
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:40,770
这就是你的真心话 康纳·奥马利
And that is your truth, Conor O'Malley.

805
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,010
不过我不想这样
I don't want it to be though.

806
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:48,270
现在这一切却成真了
Now it's for real.

807
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,990
现在她会死 而这是我的错
Now she's going to die and it's my fault.

808
01:26:51,410 --> 01:26:54,510
这根本不是全部的真心话
Now, that is not the truth at all.

809
01:26:54,670 --> 01:26:58,610
你只是希望结束痛苦 结束你自己的痛苦
You were merely wishing for an end of pain. Your own pain.

810
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,710
这是人类最原始的心愿
It is the most human wish there is.

811
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,120
但我不是有意如此
I didn't mean it though.

812
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:05,190
你是的 但也不是
You did, but you also did not.

813
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,560
这两者怎么会同时存在
How can both be true?

814
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:14,530
王子怎么会既是杀人犯又受人爱戴呢
How can a prince be a murderer and beloved by his people?

815
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:18,570
药医师怎么会既有坏脾气又有合理的思想呢
How can an apothecary be evil tempted but right thinking?

816
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:22,630
隐形人怎么会让自己被人看见却愈发孤单
How can invisible men make themselves lonelier by being seen?

817
01:27:22,640 --> 01:27:26,040
不知道 对我来说 你的故事一点都说不通
I don't know. Your stories never made sense to me.

818
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,830
因为人类是复杂的动物
Because humans are complicated beasts.

819
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,620
你清楚知道痛苦真相的同时 却又相信安慰人的谎言
You believe comforting lies, while knowing full well the painful truth

820
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:34,870
这让谎言变得更为必要了
that makes those lies necessary.

821
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,730
康纳 到头来 重要的不是你想什么
In the end, Conor, it is not important what you think.

822
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:43,780
重要的仅仅是你做什么
It is only important what you do.

823
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,650
那我该做什么
So what do I do?

824
01:27:45,820 --> 01:27:48,990
做你刚才所做的 你说出了真心话
What you did just now. You speak the truth.

825
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:50,140
就这样?
That's all?

826
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,350
你觉得这很容易?
You think it's easy?

827
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:54,790
你宁愿死都不愿说
You were willing to die rather than speak it.

828
01:27:56,850 --> 01:28:00,750
我好累 这一切让我好累
I'm so tired. So tired of all this.

睡吧 还有时间
Then sleep. There is time.

830
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,600
你确定吗 我得去见我妈妈
Are you sure? I need to see my mum.

831
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:10,640
- 今晚我们都会见到她 - 你也会在吗
- We will both see her tonight. - Will you be there?

832
01:28:10,810 --> 01:28:12,720
没错
Yes.

833
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:15,500
那将是我的最终之行
It will be the final steps of my walking.

834
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:21,570
第四个故事会怎么结束
How does the fourth story end?

835
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:25,410

睡吧
Sleep.

838

谢天谢地 康纳 康纳

839
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:12,640
我找你快找疯了
I've been out of my mind trying to find you.

840
01:29:13,310 --> 01:29:16,520
- 我还有些事得做 - 没时间了 现在必须走了
- There was something I had to do. - No time. We have to go now.

841
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:41,370
该死
Damn it.

842
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:47,710
外婆
Grandma.

843
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:51,190
抱歉
I'm sorry.

844
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:55,630
客厅和所有的事 我都很抱歉
About the living room and the everything.

845
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,750
没关系
It doesn't matter.

846
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:02,190
没关系
It doesn't matter.

847
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,070
康纳 你和我...
You know, Conor. You and me...

848
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:23,830
我们很难相处 对吗
we're not the most natural fit, are we?

849
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,060
是的
No.

850
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:28,430
我觉得是很难
I guess not.

851
01:30:28,490 --> 01:30:30,900
我也这么觉得
I guess not either.

852
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,600
但我们必须学会相处
But we're going to have to learn.

853
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:40,100
- 我知道 - 你真的知道 对吗
- I know. - You do know, don't you.

854
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:42,100
当然了
Of course you do.

855
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,270
不过我们有一个交集
But there is one thing we have in common.

856
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,330
你的妈妈
Your mum.

857
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:01,190
她就是我们的交集
That's what we have in common.

858
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:18,470
没事
It's okay.

859
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:20,410
看来你找到他了

康纳也在
Conor's here too.

865
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:43,530
- 是吗 - 没错

866
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,590

Conor.

867
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:30,480
这里就是故事的结局

868

我好怕
I'm afraid.

869
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:36,750
你当然会怕
Of course you're afraid.

870
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:41,580
这很不容易 远远没那么容易
It will be hard. It will be more than hard.

871
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:46,330
但你会挺过去 康纳·奥马利
But you will make it through, Conor O'Malley.

872
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,940
你会待着吗
You'll stay?

873
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:52,240
我就在这里
I will be right here.

874
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:02,370
我该做什么
What do I do?

875
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:08,460
现在剩下的就是说出最简单的真心话
Now all that is left is for you to speak the simplest truth of all.

876
01:34:30,070 --> 01:34:31,910
我不希望你离开
I don't want you to go.

877

878
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,210
我不希望你离开
I don't want you to go.

879
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,360
第四个故事怎么结尾的
How does the fourth story end?

880

男孩紧紧地抱着他的母亲
It ends with a boy holding on tight to his mother.

881
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:57,510
这样子...
And by doing so...

882
01:35:57,770 --> 01:36:01,670
他就终于能放手了
he can finally let her go.

883
01:36:43,950 --> 01:36:45,960
