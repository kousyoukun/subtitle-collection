1
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,360
Mum!

2
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,387
<i>How does this story begin?</i>

3
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,346
<i>It begins like so many stories.</i>

4
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,649
<i>With a boy.</i>

5
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,024
<i>Too old to be a kid.</i>

6
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,865
<i>Too young to be a man.</i>

7
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,406
<i>And a nightmare.</i>

8
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:49,272
A MONSTER CALLS

9
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,757
It's got two fundamental constants.

10
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,220
E, the base of the natural
logarithm system,

11
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,515
it's a number,

12
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,019
it's a number that emerges from asking:

13
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,522
What is the mathematical
function or thing

14
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:51,902
which describes things
where the rate at which they change...

15
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,074
Now, if you do that mathematically,

16
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,577
it will give you
this fundamental constant.

17
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:06,658
Conor?

18
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:09,954
Are you all right, Conor?

19
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:11,830
You look tired.

20
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,416
Are you getting enough rest?

21
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,674
Yeah, I'm fine.

22
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,464
'Cause if you ever wanted to talk...

23
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,802
I'm fine.

24
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:23,758
Okay-

25
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,689
Everyone, eyes front.

26
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:32,901
Pi is the ratio of the circumference,
and when you put it...

27
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,272
Careful there, O'Malley.
You might fall.

28
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,856
Are you drunk or something?

29
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,943
He'll have to get his slaphead mother
to kiss it for him.

30
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:47,582
You're always off
in your own little dream world.

31
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,082
What's there so interesting?

32
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,048
Get off!

33
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,421
You've been a good boy.

34
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,765
Remember, O'Malley,

35
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,967
good boys don't talk.

36
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:33,953
Hey, Con!

37
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,672
Hey, Mum.

38
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,301
What is that?

39
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,970
It's a surprise.

40
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,676
So, this is a VCR?

41
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,967
This is much better than a VCR.

42
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,682
It's your grandpa's
old film projector.

43
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,017
There we go.

44
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,523
- I wish you could have known him.
- Who?

45
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,272
Grandpa.

46
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,234
Even Grandma softened up around him.

47
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,024
Yeah, right.

48
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,317
Here we go.

49
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,342
What a bunch of assholes.

50
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,846
Why are they trying to kill King Kong?

51
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,013
People don't like
what they don't understand.

52
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,930
They get scared.

53
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,564
King Kong could just smash them all.

54
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,858
Break them into a million pieces.

55
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,361
Yeah.

56
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,352
Conor.

57
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,443
Mum?

58
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,945
I have come to get you,
Conor O'Malley.

59
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,990
Why don't you run, Conor O'Malley?

60
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,375
Why don't you run for your mother?

61
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,126
You leave her alone!
I'm not afraid of you!

62
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:53,435
I will visit you again
on further nights, Conor O'Malley.

63
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,945
And I will shake your walls
until you wake.

64
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,654
And then,
I will tell you three stories.

65
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:03,403
You're going to tell me stories?

66
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,117
lam.

67
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,282
I will tell you three stories,

68
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,827
and when I have finished my stories,

69
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,333
you will tell me a fourth.

70
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,043
I don't know anything about stories!

71
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,050
You will tell me a fourth,
and it will be the truth.

72
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,836
What are you talking about?

73
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:23,765
This truth that you hide.
The truth you dream.

74
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,184
- You will tell me your nightmare.
- No.

75
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,310
Yes. That will be your truth.

76
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,639
And if I don't?

77
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,385
Con, I was asleep.

78
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,724
You should be in your own bed, Con.

79
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,223
Just five minutes.

80
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,688
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

81
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,489
- Come on, Con.
- Just five minutes. I promise.

82
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,196
Five minutes.

83
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,207
Night, night.

84
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,834
I respect that. But the last thing
your father would want

85
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,496
would be for him
to be taken off to America

86
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,381
to live with some strange woman
and her strange child.

87
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,213
We have to discuss this now.

88
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,009
Hey, Con!

89
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,632
There's the little man.

90
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,297
Where did you say you got these?

91
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,761
From a very nice old people's home.

92
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,723
They're clearing it out to make flats,
and I'll be the agent.

93
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:17,180
Your mother needs a cup of tea.

94
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,940
Green, no sugar.
I take mine black.

95
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,980
What do you think, Con?

96
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,273
He loves it.

97
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:25,313
- Go on.
- Okay.

98
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,524
Go on, try something else.

99
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,031
Alright.

100
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:39,039
You can't just drift, Lizzy.
You have to make some decisions.

101
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,212
I am making all the decisions I can,

102
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,840
and I will decide
when I speak to Conor.

103
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:52,633
Go and help Conor with the tea
or I'll literally go insane.

104
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,519
You and I need to have a talk.

105
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,183
I'm making tea.

106
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:03,980
- Conor!
- I said, I'm making...

107
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,736
We have to...

108
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,857
I'm not the enemy.
I'm here to help your mother.

109
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,070
I know why you're here.

110
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,075
I'm here because 12-year-old boys

111
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,283
shouldn't be wiping down counters
without being asked to first.

112
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:16,413
You wanna do it?

113
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,290
Less of your cheek.

114
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,661
She's always sick
after the treatments.

115
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,080
She'll be better tomorrow.
And then you can go home.

116
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,465
She'll seem better tomorrow.

117
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,718
She needs to talk about this with you.

118
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:29,968
Talk to me about what?

119
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:36,183
- About you coming to live with me.
- I’m never coming to live...

120
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:39,346
- Listen to me. If your mother...
- There's no if!

121
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,732
She'll be better
and then you can go.

122
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,942
Lizzy?

123
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,562
Lizzy!

124
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:48,813
Oh my God!

125
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,073
Hold on, hold on.

126
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,404
Where's the medicine?

127
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,567
Conor!

128
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,277
Conor!

129
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,330
I'm here, darling.
Deep breath.

130
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:01,038
Conor, please!
Please give me the medicine.

131
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,452
Hurry, hurry.

132
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,704
It's coming.

133
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,547
It's coming.

134
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,380
Here we go.

135
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,678
Deep breath.

136
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,054
Deep breath.

137
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,059
Deep breath.

138
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,894
Deep breath.

139
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,978
It's okay.

140
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,582
Just don't touch anything.

141
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,003
Trust me,
I'll be doing my very best not to.

142
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,300
Our conversation isn't over,
young man.

143
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,680
Oh, yes, it is.

144
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,170
Mum!

145
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,780
What took you so long?

146
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,623
It is time for me
to tell you the first tale.

147
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,250
I don't need a tale.

148
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,418
I need a bus ticket for my grandma.

149
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,580
It is time for me to tell you the...

150
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,841
Where do you think you're going?
I will be listened to!

151
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,718
I am as old as this land and...

152
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,504
What do you know about anything?

153
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,924
I know everything about you,
Conor O'Malley.

154
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,433
No, you don't!

155
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,141
If you did, you'd know
I don't have time to listen

156
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,728
to stupid stories from a stupid tree
that is just a dream.

157
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,312
A dream?

158
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,943
What is a dream, Conor O'Malley?

159
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:18,481
And who is to say that it is not
everything else that is a dream?

160
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,484
Never mind.

161
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,904
I came to see you because I thought...

162
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,914
You thought I might have come
to topple your enemies.

163
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,666
Slay your dragons.

164
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,498
Or at least help me
with my grandmother.

165
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,913
But all you want to do
is tell me stories.

166
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,582
Stories of how I toppled my enemies.

167
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,798
Stories of how I slew dragons.

168
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,214
Let me tell you a tale
of when I came walking.

169
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:46,634
Let me tell you of the end
of a wicked queen

170
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,930
and how I made sure
she was never seen again.

171
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,770
Go on, then.

172
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,856
Good.

173
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,022
<i>What do you see?</i>

174
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,433
<i>Nothing.
There are leaves in the</i> way.

175
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,977
<i>Use your imagination,
Conor O'Malley.</i>

176
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,067
<i>What do you see?</i>

177
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,823
<i>- I see a spark.
- Yes.</i>

178
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,158
<i>And?</i>

179
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,118
<i>No, it's water.</i>

180
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,494
<i>It's watercolor.</i>

181
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,204
<i>Keep looking.</i>

182
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,790
<i>WOW!</i>

183
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,921
<i>Wow, indeed.</i>

184
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,299
<i>Long ago, before this was a town,</i>

185
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,801
<i>with roads and trains and cars,</i>

186
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,553
<i>this was a kingdom.</i>

187
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:07,340
<i>Here? We don't even have a Tesco.</i>

188
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,558
<i>It was a prosperous kingdom</i>

189
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,846
<i>with a wise king
who had won peace for his people,</i>

190
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,856
<i>but peace had come at a price.</i>

191
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:21,988
<i>The king had lost all three
of his sons in battle to giants.</i>

192
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,695
<i>To dragons.</i>

193
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,033
<i>To armies of men
led by great wizards.</i>

194
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,118
<i>This is all sounding
pretty fairytale-ish.</i>

195
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:36,752
<i>You wouldn't say that if you heard
the screams of a man killed by a spear.</i>

196
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:45,470
<i>The queen was unable to bear
the loss of all their three sons,</i>

197
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,215
<i>leaving the king alone in despair</i>

198
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,807
<i>with the company
of his only remaining heir,</i>

199
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,188
<i>his orphaned grandson.</i>

200
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,439
<i>The child was raised as a prince,</i>

201
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:08,617
<i>winning the love of the kingdom
with his gallantry and good heart.</i>

202
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,459
<i>His people loved him.</i>

203
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,120
Our future king!

204
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:28,262
<i>He was nearly a man
when his grandfather took a new wife.</i>

205
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,639
<i>The king felt ill</i>

206
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:38,022
<i>and rumour began to spread
that she was an evil witch,</i>

207
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,150
<i>that she was bent on taking
the throne for herself</i>

208
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,527
<i>by poisoning the king.</i>

209
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:51,194
<i>A few weeks later, the king died.</i>

210
00:26:56,907 --> 00:27:00,161
<i>The prince was too young
to take the king's place,</i>

211
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:05,299
<i>so, by law, the queen would rule
for another year.</i>

212
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,923
<i>The future was uncertain.</i>

213
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:28,568
<i>The prince, meanwhile,
had given away his heart.</i>

214
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,492
<i>She was beautiful and smart,</i>

215
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:36,163
<i>and though only a farmer's daughter,
the kingdom smiled on the match.</i>

216
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,497
<i>The queen, however,
she was rather enjoying being queen.</i>

217
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:49,051
<i>And what better way to remain so
than to marry the prince herself?</i>

218
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,177
<i>What? That's disgusting!</i>

219
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,964
<i>- She was his grandmother!
- Step-grandmother.</i>

220
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,726
<i>And still a young, beautiful
woman herself, don't forget.</i>

221
00:27:57,968 --> 00:28:01,393
<i>The prince, however,
didn't like the idea either.</i>

222
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:10,030
<i>He took the farmer's daughter
and they rode away into the night.</i>

223
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:16,366
<i>They stopped to rest
under the branches of a yew tree.</i>

224
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,745
<i>That's you!</i>

225
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,541
<i>The next morning, the prince awoke.</i>

226
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,208
<i>'Arise, my beloved', he said.</i>

227
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,499
<i>But the farmer's daughter
did not stir,</i>

228
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,550
<i>which was when the prince
noticed the blood.</i>

229
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:34,596
<i>Blood?</i>

230
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,224
<i>Someone had killed his beloved
in the night.</i>

231
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,383
<i>What?</i>

232
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,553
<i>'The queen!', he cried.</i>

233
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,390
<i>'The queen has murdered my bride!'</i>

234
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:49,816
<i>The villagers, full of fury
and vengeance, rose up at the crime.</i>

235
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,441
<i>It was then that I came walking.</i>

236
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:20,176
<i>The queen was never seen again.</i>

237
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,689
Good! She deserved it!

238
00:29:26,974 --> 00:29:29,898
Now, I don't suppose
you can help me with my grandma.

239
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,937
The story is not yet finished.

240
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,033
I took the queen
and carried her far enough away

241
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,411
so the town's people
would never find her.

242
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,449
To a village by the sea,
where she began a new life.

243
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,834
But she killed the farmer's daughter!

244
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,378
How can you save a murderer?

245
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,209
You really are a monster.

246
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,046
I never said
she killed the farmer's daughter.

247
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,553
I only said
that the prince said it was so.

248
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,557
The prince never fell asleep
that night,

249
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:05,138
<i>but waited for the farmer's daughter
to be lost in her dreams,</i>

250
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,228
<i>and then began his real plan.</i>

251
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,525
<i>What?</i>

252
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:17,067
<i>He knew her death would start a fire
that would consume the queen entire.</i>

253
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,951
That's a terrible story!
And a cheat!

254
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,116
It's a true story.

255
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:29,162
Many things that are true
feel like a cheat.

256
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,422
Kingdoms get the princes they deserve.

257
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,003
Farmers' daughters die for no reason.

258
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,090
And sometimes witches merit saving.

259
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,973
Quite often, actually.
You'd be surprised.

260
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,724
So, the good prince was a murderer

261
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,975
and the evil queen
wasn't a witch after all?

262
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:51,642
No, the queen most certainly
was a witch

263
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,438
and could well have been
on her way to great evil.

264
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:56,730
Who can say?

265
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,565
Then Why'd you save her then?

266
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:02,828
Because what she was not,
was a murderer.

267
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,782
<i>She hadn't poisoned the king.</i>

268
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,664
<i>He had merely grown old.</i>

269
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,047
<i>- Did the prince ever get caught?
- No.</i>

270
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,459
<i>He became a much beloved king</i>

271
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:20,380
<i>who ruled happily
until the end of his long days.</i>

272
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,922
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

273
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,307
I don't get it.

274
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,968
Who's the good guy here?

275
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,853
There is not always a good guy,
Conor O'Malley.

276
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,182
Nor is there always a bad one.

277
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,476
Most people are somewhere in between.

278
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:38,442
So how is all this
meant to save me from Grandma?

279
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,410
It is not her you need saving from.

280
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,424
There are always two sides to a story.

281
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,558
How many of you know the saying:

282
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,186
'Sticks and stones
may break your bones,

283
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,224
but words can never hurt you'?

284
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,894
Next time, when someone
says something to you...

285
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,803
Good, you're home.

286
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,886
Your mum's upstairs.
She wants to talk to you.

287
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,932
What?

288
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,719
Your father's flying in on Sunday.

289
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,763
Dad's coming? From America?

290
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,478
Go on. She is waiting.

291
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,898
And pack a bag.

292
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,730
You're coming to stay with me
for a few days.

293
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,815
Go on!

294
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:19,089
That tree is amazing.

295
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,965
It's been here for thousands of years.

296
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,798
What do you think?

297
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,844
I think Grandma is trying
to turn me into Tina Turner.

298
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,186
She must be a fan.

299
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,691
Why am I going to stay with Grandma?

300
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,484
Are you going back to hospital?

301
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,954
Come here, Con.

302
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,621
This latest treatment's not doing
what it's supposed to.

303
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:04,794
So they're going to adjust it,
try something else.

304
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,427
- That's all?
- That's all.

305
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,475
Are you sure?

306
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:16,597
I'm sure.

307
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,892
Because...

308
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,819
You could tell me, you know?

309
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:43,255
There.

310
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,585
Everything will be fine, Conor.

311
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,800
You'll see.

312
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,953
...and bang, right into his side.

313
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,307
Where are you going?

314
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:43,392
- Don't touch him.
- With such a punchable face?

315
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,935
I said don't touch him.

316
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,114
O'Malley and I have an understanding.

317
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,193
I am the only one who touches him.

318
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:54,907
Isn't that right?

319
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,448
Now tell me,

320
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:03,211
why is it every time that I turn around,
you're there looking at me?

321
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,749
Getting a bit odd, don't you think?

322
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,754
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

323
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,298
Life's not really going
your way today, is it?

324
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,993
I have a house to show.

325
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:39,531
I'm trusting you here alone
until your father shows up.

326
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,041
I'm not five years old.

327
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,128
This is the correct time.

328
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,921
Not the one on your phone,

329
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,129
or on the computer,
not even on the news.

330
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,671
It was my mother's,
your great-grandmother's.

331
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,841
Perfect time keeping
for over a hundred years.

332
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,468
Conor, pick up your rucksack!

333
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:05,273
I don't want your father to think
I'm keeping you in a pigsty.

334
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,684
Not much chance of that.

335
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,774
Now, when you go to the hospital,

336
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:13,190
your father may not notice
how tired your mum is getting.

337
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:16,447
So we have to make sure
that he doesn't overstay his welcome.

338
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,620
Not that that's
historically been a problem.

339
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,908
No eggs. You've already
had eggs twice this week.

340
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,999
If you get hungry, there's spinach
in the fridge which you can steam.

341
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:28,505
Yes, sure.

342
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,083
Don't touch anything.

343
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,762
I'll do my very best not to.

344
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,086
Get in!

345
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:46,676
Dad.

346
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,300
How you doing? You look tired.

347
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,760
I'm fine.

348
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,638
Mum's on this new medicine.
It'll make her better.

349
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,732
She goes into hospital
once every two weeks

350
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:39,738
and they pump the medicine
into her bloodstream.

351
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,824
She is sick for the next few days,
but she is better again.

352
00:40:50,907 --> 00:40:53,911
Your sister's doing better.

353
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:55,499
Half-sister.

354
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,337
Yeah.

355
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,382
I'd still love you to meet her.

356
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,011
I've been talking with your grandma
about bringing you out to LA.

357
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,631
You want me to come to LA?

358
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,141
Yeah, absolutely!

359
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,597
- You would you like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah.

360
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,515
We were thinking over Christmas.
You can be back here in time for school.

361
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,392
So you mean just for a visit, then?

362
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,568
Yeah, but it would be great.

363
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,526
I don't want to live with Grandma.

364
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,942
It's an old lady's house,
with old lady's things.

365
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,236
You can't touch anything
or sit anywhere.

366
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,279
You can't leave a mess
for two seconds.

367
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,537
Conor...

368
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,541
I want to have my own room
in my own house and my own things.

369
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,794
You wouldn't have that in America.
There's barely enough room for us.

370
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:37,795
- I don't care!
- Conor, listen.

371
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,207
- She is so strict.
- Your family, your life, your friends...

372
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:44,173
- Her house is like a museum!
- All of it is here.

373
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,088
-It'd be unfair to take you out of it.
- Unfair to who?

374
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:48,347
Conor.

375
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,236
Doesn't look
like your grandma's home yet.

376
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:06,824
She sometimes goes back
to the hospital after I go to bed.

377
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,281
The nurses let her sleep in a chair.

378
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,281
Just because she doesn't like me,
doesn't make her a bad person.

379
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:16,201
She says you're all start
and no finish.

380
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:20,838
Well, she is entitled
to her own opinion.

381
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,633
How long are you here for?

382
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,294
As long as I can be.

383
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,221
What does that mean?

384
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:33,643
We don't have a lot of money.
And Americans don't get a lot of holidays.

385
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,680
- You're not American.
- But I live there now.

386
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,191
I'll come back whenever I need to.

387
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,942
And you are gonna come to LA
for Christmas.

388
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,445
In your cramped house,
where there's no room for me.

389
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,646
Conor!

390
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:50,360
Why did you come?

391
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,451
Conor, wait!

392
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,003
Conor, I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

393
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,760
There's still loads of time!

394
00:44:56,152 --> 00:45:00,077
As destruction goes,
that was remarkably pitiful.

395
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,581
Now, I have come to tell you
the second tale.

396
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,165
Is this as bad as the last one?

397
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:10,175
It ends with proper destruction,
if that's what you mean.

398
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,802
It's about a man
who thought only of himself,

399
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,304
who wasn't as generous
as he should have been.

400
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,808
A man who gets punished
very badly indeed.

401
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,012
Stories aren't real, though.
They don't help anything.

402
00:45:22,178 --> 00:45:25,352
Stories are wild creatures,
Conor O'Malley.

403
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,688
When you let them loose, who knows
what havoc they might wreak?

404
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,852
Oh, yes!

405
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:33,689
Okay-

406
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,067
Go on, then.

407
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,703
Good.

408
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:21,154
<i>150 years ago, the future came.</i>

409
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,416
<i>Factories grew in the landscape
like weeds.</i>

410
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,920
<i>Trees fell, rivers blackened</i>

411
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:32,082
<i>and the sky choked on smoke and ash.</i>

412
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,800
<i>But there was still green
if you knew where to look.</i>

413
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,390
<i>On the edge of this town
lived a stubborn man</i>

414
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,643
<i>who refused to change.</i>

415
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,773
<i>He dealt in the old ways
of medicine,</i>

416
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:54,358
<i>herbs and barks and concoctions
brewed from berries and leaves.</i>

417
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,694
<i>Villagers only ever called him
the apothecary.</i>

418
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:58,608
<i>The what?</i>

419
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,278
<i>The apothecary.
An old fashion name for pharmacist.</i>

420
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,910
<i>Why didn't you just say?</i>

421
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,713
<i>There was also a young parson
in this village,</i>

422
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:15,045
<i>an enlightened man and a kind one</i>

423
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:18,962
<i>who just wanted the very best
for his congregation.</i>

424
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,182
<i>He preached against the apothecary's
use of the old ways,</i>

425
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,844
<i>and the apothecary's
foul temper and greed</i>

426
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:30,356
<i>made certain some of these sermons
fell on eager ears.</i>

427
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,944
<i>Much as he tried
to keep on helping the community,</i>

428
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,824
<i>his business sank,</i>

429
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,028
<i>which only made him grow bitter.</i>

430
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:51,160
<i>On the parsonage grounds
there also lived a yew tree.</i>

431
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,046
<i>That's the hill where you live.</i>

432
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:57,425
<i>The yew tree is the most important
of all the healing trees.</i>

433
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,711
<i>- Why?
- Its berries, its bark,</i>

434
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,926
<i>they thrum and burn
and twist with life.</i>

435
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,842
<i>It can cure almost any ailment.</i>

436
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,225
<i>Really? Anything?</i>

437
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:11,606
<i>Anything that can be cured,
if mixed by the right apothecary.</i>

438
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:23,280
<i>The apothecary wanted
the yew tree very badly.</i>

439
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:27,197
<i>But in order to harvest these things,
he would have to cut it down.</i>

440
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:30,742
<i>And this,
the parson would not allow.</i>

441
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,093
<i>The parson had two daughters
who were the light of his life.</i>

442
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,220
<i>He was a caring, loving father</i>

443
00:48:43,379 --> 00:48:45,723
<i>who'd have done anything
for their sake.</i>

444
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:50,478
<i>But one day, both little girls
were struck by a terrible sickness,</i>

445
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,973
<i>and nothing the parson did helped.</i>

446
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:58,646
<i>No cure from the more modern doctors,
no prayer, nothing.</i>

447
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:10,832
<i>There was no choice
but to approach the apothecary.</i>

448
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,420
<i>'Will you not help my daughters?',
the person begged.</i>

449
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:19,833
<i>'Will you not save
two innocent girls?'</i>

450
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,920
<i>'Why should I?',
said the apothecary.</i>

451
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,010
<i>'You have driven away my business
with your preachings</i>

452
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:31,474
<i>and you have refused me the yew tree,
my best source of healing.'</i>

453
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,977
<i>'You may have the yew tree',
said the parson.</i>

454
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,141
<i>'I will preach sermons
in your favor.'</i>

455
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:40,812
<i>'I will do anything if you
would only save my daughters.'</i>

456
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:45,988
<i>'You would give up everything
you believed in?', said the apothecary.</i>

457
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,495
<i>'If it would save them,
I would give up everything.'</i>

458
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,371
<i>'Then there is nothing
I can do to help you.'</i>

459
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:20,818
The very next day,
both of the parson's daughters died.

460
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,068
What?

461
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:25,107
That night, I came walking.

462
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,571
Good! He deserves
all the punishment he gets!

463
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,114
Indeed.

464
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:33,247
It was shortly after midnight
that I tore the parson's home

465
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,907
from its very foundations.

466
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,789
The parson?
What are you talking about?

467
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:39,704
The apothecary's the evil one.

468
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,625
He was greedy and rude,
but he was still a healer.

469
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,127
The parson? What was he?

470
00:50:48,921 --> 00:50:51,219
A man of faith without faith.

471
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,941
Belief is half of all healing.

472
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:04,771
Belief in the cure,
belief in the future that awaits.

473
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,527
Your belief is valuable,

474
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,660
so you must be careful
where you put it,

475
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,912
and in whom.

476
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:17,874
Tell me, Conor O'Malley.
What shall I destroy next?

477
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:18,784
What?

478
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:21,124
It is most satisfying,
I can assure you.

479
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:24,507
Come on! Tell me!
What should I destroy?

480
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,423
Snap the chimney?

481
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:29,929
The chimney!

482
00:51:31,547 --> 00:51:32,639
Next!

483
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,557
Throw away their beds!

484
00:51:39,972 --> 00:51:41,224
Smash the furniture!

485
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:51,650
Break the windows!

486
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,695
Windows.

487
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,285
Break them yourself.

488
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,373
<i>Q.“
m“.</i>

489
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,723
Harder, Conor O'Malley!
Come on!

490
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:15,849
Harder!

491
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:17,601
That's it, that's it!

492
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,428
Yes!

493
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,732
Feels good, doesn't it?

494
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,063
Yes!

495
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,882
Grandma.

496
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:17,796
Grandma.

497
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:19,923
Grandma.

498
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,477
Grandma, please...

499
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,052
Grandma.

500
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:06,951
How do you like them sunny side up?

501
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,158
What are you doing here?

502
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,084
What do you think?

503
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,336
Grandma called
very early this morning.

504
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,045
She's gone to the hospital
to see your mum.

505
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,306
She has had a bad turn.

506
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,560
I need to see her.

507
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,346
We'll see what happens today

508
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:33,808
and maybe you can visit
for a little while this afternoon.

509
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:41,607
I can see how upset you are.

510
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,453
I didn't mean to.

511
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,702
- I don't know what happened.
- Worse things happen at sea.

512
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:51,749
What does that mean?

513
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:54,211
Aren't you going to punish me?

514
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,542
What could possibly
be the point in that?

515
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:08,016
I gotta say, champ, this is
really just amazingly thorough.

516
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,391
Buried treasure!

517
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,319
These must be those...

518
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:22,610
The home movies your mum used
to send to me when I moved away.

519
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,774
Why did you move away?

520
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:29,784
We were young.

521
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,240
Too young.
We had big dreams, and...

522
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:33,746
What kind of dreams?

523
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:36,628
Well, your mum wanted to go
to Art college.

524
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,337
- Really?
- Yeah.

525
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,135
- She didn't go, but she wanted to.
- What happened?

526
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,675
- Because Mum got pregnant with me.
- Hey.

527
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:53,311
Mum never regretted having you.
You were only ever good news.

528
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,809
And I know that for a fact,

529
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,191
because the one thing
she regretted was marrying me.

530
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,022
Why did she marry you, then?

531
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,153
Because I'm handsome.

532
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,236
Your mum was amazing,
and she still is.

533
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:10,905
And we were in love.

534
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,909
I mean, I still love her.
But, you see, the...

535
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,918
Love isn't enough.

536
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:21,715
It doesn't carry you through.

537
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,378
So, you didn't get happily ever after.

538
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:28,304
No, but that's life, you know?

539
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,554
Most of us
just get messily ever after.

540
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,352
That's alright.

541
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,901
But I'm happy you turned out like her.

542
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,495
Mrs Chandler.

543
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,411
Education is really important!

544
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,543
You're telling me what to do.
I'm pulled in every direction.

545
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,091
Are you going
to take him out of school then?

546
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:53,723
Thank you.

547
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,475
I'm gonna go and find something to eat.
You want anything, kid?

548
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,898
I want you to stop calling me kid.

549
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:03,646
Fair enough.

550
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,232
I'm sorry, Lizzy.

551
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,410
Who was that man in the suit?

552
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:21,250
Just"

553
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,453
Nothing.

554
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,000
What happened this morning?

555
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:26,255
Nothing.

556
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,335
It's fine.

557
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,975
L just had a bit of a bad reaction.

558
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,516
But there's one more thing
they're going to try,

559
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:46,897
it's a medicine that's had
some really good results.

560
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,188
Why didn't they try it
in the first place?

561
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,027
Because this is something you take

562
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,033
when the other stuff hasn't worked
the way they want it to.

563
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,913
Does that mean it's too late?

564
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:00,199
No, of course it doesn't mean
it's too late.

565
01:01:00,699 --> 01:01:02,167
Are you sure?

566
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:06,125
I believe every word I say.

567
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,211
Belief is half of all healing.

568
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,798
Belief in the cure,

569
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,101
belief in the future that awaits.

570
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:22,391
Yeah.

571
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,815
You know that tree
that I'm always going on about?

572
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:29,944
Yeah.

573
01:01:30,103 --> 01:01:34,108
Well, this drug is made
from trees like that.

574
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:35,867
- It is?
- Yeah!

575
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:36,777
Seriously?

576
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:41,039
All this time, we could have gone
out there and just chopped it down.

577
01:01:42,157 --> 01:01:43,909
But not that one.

578
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,424
That one's our friend.

579
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,830
Where are you?

580
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,586
I'm here.

581
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,296
So can you do it?
Can you make my mum better?

582
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,466
If your mother can be healed,
the yew tree will do it.

583
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:44,886
So that's a yes?

584
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,685
You still don't know
why you called me.

585
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:48,981
I didn't call you.

586
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,438
And even if I did,
it was obviously for my mum.

587
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,978
- Was it?
- Why else?

588
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,397
To listen to idiotic stories
that make no sense?

589
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:59,568
It is not yet time for the third tale.
But soon.

590
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:03,197
And after that, you will tell me
your story, Conor O'Malley.

591
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,323
No!

592
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,621
No, not this!

593
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:09,582
That's just a nightmare!

594
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:11,292
No, please!

595
01:03:15,834 --> 01:03:18,508
That's not my truth!
That's just a nightmare!

596
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,890
Nevertheless, this is
what will happen after the third tale.

597
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:24,676
I want to know what's going
to happen with my mum.

598
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:28,351
You waste the precious time
that is given to you.

599
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,686
Wait! Where are you going?

600
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,317
You're a tree of healing.
I need you to heal!

601
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:38,023
And so I shall.

602
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,223
Conor, I'll come back.
I promise.

603
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:13,357
And you'll come
to LA for Christmas.

604
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,235
I don't want to leave Mum
on her own for Christmas.

605
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,030
- This medicine your mum's taking...
- It's going to make her well.

606
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:21,237
No, Conor. It probably isn't.

607
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:23,652
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's a last ditch effort.

608
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:25,991
It'll heal her, okay? I know it.

609
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:30,705
- It's the reason it came, it has to be.
- Reason what came?

610
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:32,035
The monster.

611
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:34,671
- Conor, what?
- It comes at 12.07.

612
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:36,797
At first I thought
it was a dream, but...

613
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,625
Conor, stop it. It's a dream.

614
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,090
I'm sorry you have to face this,

615
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:43,380
but you have to be brave.

616
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:45,765
Do you understand?

617
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:49,477
C'mon.

618
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:51,846
C'mon.

619
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,859
I'll be back as soon as I can.

620
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:07,404
What if it's not fast enough?

621
01:05:13,618 --> 01:05:15,495
- Conor, listen...
- It's okay.

622
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:17,255
What's okay?

623
01:05:17,664 --> 01:05:18,961
Just"

624
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,504
You don't have to.

625
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:32,952
<i>Look.
Can you see? Can you see?</i>

626
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,373
<i>Can you wave?</i>

627
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,125
<i>Can you see him?</i>

628
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:40,414
<i>Look, then we wave to Grandma.</i>

629
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,136
<i>Hello, Grandma!</i>

630
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,593
<i>Con, can you say hello
to Grandma and Mum?</i>

631
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:52,054
<i>Hello, Grandma!</i>

632
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:53,426
<i>There</i> we go.

633
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:56,388
<i>Mummy's heard this one a lot.</i>

634
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:58,724
<i>Okay, you ready?</i>

635
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,522
<i>Con, look, sit, come sit here.</i>

636
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,566
<i>Con, look.</i>

637
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:08,317
<i>- Hello, Grandma.
- Mummy and...</i>

638
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,194
<i>There</i> we go.

639
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:14,117
<i>We're doing you a picture, Grandma.</i>

640
01:07:15,532 --> 01:07:17,159
<i>And then mix it together.</i>

641
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,872
<i>What colour is that?</i>

642
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,875
- Brown.
- Yeah!

643
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,425
<i>It's a nice sludgy brown.</i>

644
01:07:25,583 --> 01:07:28,302
<i>- But we have brown here.
- That's true.</i>

645
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,556
<i>What can you see?</i>

646
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,846
<i>What's that? What are those?</i>

647
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,353
<i>What are these?</i>

648
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:40,436
<i>- The eyes.
- The eyes, that's it.</i>

649
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:42,901
<i>Life is always in the eyes.</i>

650
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:48,110
<i>If you get that,
you'll be a proper artist.</i>

651
01:07:49,691 --> 01:07:50,692
Yeah.

652
01:07:51,693 --> 01:07:52,785
<i>Look.</i>

653
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:56,414
<i>This is how we draw the eyes in.</i>

654
01:07:56,573 --> 01:08:00,294
<i>This is where the eyes
catch the reflection.</i>

655
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,915
<i>Then we see the life
in the eyes, see that?</i>

656
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:07,337
Do <i>it</i> again.

657
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,132
<i>It's life.</i>

658
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,850
<i>Maybe if we take a pencil,</i>

659
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,979
<i>and you can draw on there...</i>

660
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:22,640
<i>Do you want to try it?</i>

661
01:08:23,308 --> 01:08:25,151
<i>Show me how you do it.</i>

662
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:38,948
<i>Look, Con.</i>

663
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:43,416
<i>That's his hair.</i>

664
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,873
<i>And this is his eyebrow.</i>

665
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,964
<i>There's the eyes.</i>

666
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:53,471
<i>Oh, look, there's his mouth.</i>

667
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:57,346
<i>There's his mouth,
he's very angry.</i>

668
01:08:57,634 --> 01:08:59,181
<i>Can you see?</i>

669
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,388
<i>Look at that!</i>

670
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,730
<i>And then we start to make</i> a face.

671
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:08,857
And then...

672
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,405
<i>There's our monster.</i>

673
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,491
<i>There's the monster.</i>

674
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,326
<i>Look at the monster.</i>

675
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,312
Very slowly.

676
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:54,865
That's it.

677
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,545
It's a thirty-minute exam
this morning,

678
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:19,387
and this is all the stuff we've
been doing for the last two weeks.

679
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,770
So, if you've done your revision,
there won't be any surprises.

680
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:32,316
In a moment I'm going
to ask you to turn your pages over

681
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,357
and there will be no talking
for the next thirty minutes.

682
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:37,776
I want total silence in here,

683
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:41,697
because you're going to be using
your brains, not your mouths.

684
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:46,125
So, thirty minutes, starting now.

685
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,376
Good luck.

686
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:17,448
I think I've finally figured you out.

687
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,692
After all this time.

688
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,789
All that you are looking for
is someone to kick your head in.

689
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,827
But you know what?
I'm not that guy anymore.

690
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,839
Goodbye, O'Malley.

691
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:40,179
I no longer see you.

692
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,967
Now you are invisible to me too.

693
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,140
I hope your mum gets better.

694
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,330
What took you so long?

695
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,171
It is time for the third tale.

696
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,548
There was once an invisible man,

697
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:27,139
who had grown tired of being unseen.

698
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:30,722
It was not that he was
actually invisible.

699
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:36,315
It was just that people
had become used to not seeing him.

700
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:41,400
One day, the invisible man
couldn't stand it anymore.

701
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:44,152
He kept wondering:

702
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:46,912
if no one sees you,

703
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,494
are you really there at all?

704
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,044
What did the invisible man do?

705
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:57,669
He called for a monster.

706
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,979
I don't even know
what to say to you, O'Malley.

707
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,903
You sent him to hospital!

708
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,702
His parents are threatening to sue.

709
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:28,279
It wasn't me.

710
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,655
What was that?

711
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,623
It wasn't me.

712
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,832
I'm not invisible! I'm not invisible!

713
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:41,467
If you want to be seen,
this is not the best way.

714
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:42,752
I'm not invisible!

715
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:45,968
Did you hear me? I'm not invisible!

716
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:50,552
School rules dictate
immediate exclusion.

717
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,597
But how could I do that

718
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:57,691
and consider myself
any kind of teacher?

719
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:00,816
Go back to class.

720
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:04,524
We will talk about this one day,
but not today.

721
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,985
You're not punishing me?

722
01:14:09,904 --> 01:14:12,327
What could possibly be the point?

723
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:27,923
Let me give you an example
of emotional wellness.

724
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:31,517
You know how difficult it is
sometimes to say no, right?

725
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:35,021
How good it feels when you
finally find the courage to say it.

726
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,224
Why is that?

727
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,149
Aren't you coming?

728
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,277
I'll be right here.

729
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:03,268
What did you do to your hands?

730
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:12,072
This is the talk, isn't it?

731
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,154
Everybody wants
to have a talk lately.

732
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:21,160
Con.

733
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,334
Look at me.

734
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:31,421
I spoke to the doctor this morning.

735
01:16:37,468 --> 01:16:40,267
The new treatment,
it's not working.

736
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:43,899
The one from the yew tree?

737
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:48,437
Yeah.

738
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,699
How can it not be working?

739
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,485
Things have just moved really fast.

740
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:56,411
Faster than they thought.

741
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:59,995
- But how can it not be working?
- I don't know.

742
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:01,704
It has to.

743
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,546
So what happens now?

744
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,340
What's gonna be the next treatment?

745
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,302
I'm so sorry.

746
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,306
I've never been more sorry

747
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:26,646
about anything in my life.

748
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,205
It's okay that you're angry, Con.

749
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:42,367
It really is.

750
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:47,463
I'm pretty angry too,
to tell you the truth.

751
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,342
But, Con...

752
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:57,969
Con, are you listening?

753
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,680
One day,

754
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,604
if you look back and you feel bad

755
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:12,029
for being so angry
you couldn't even speak to me,

756
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:14,691
you have to know that that was okay,

757
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,582
that I knew.

758
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:30,047
Because I know everything
you need to tell me

759
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:33,176
without you having to say it
out loud.

760
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:41,050
And if you need to break things,

761
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,183
by God, you break them.

762
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,983
Break them, good and hard.

763
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:51,394
And I'll be right there, Con.

764
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,621
I wish I had a hundred years.

765
01:19:12,248 --> 01:19:15,092
A hundred years I could give to you.

766
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,201
Wake up!

767
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:48,659
Wake up!

768
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:51,961
Wake up!

769
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,379
Wake up!

770
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:54,915
Wake up!

771
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:56,713
I don't care what time it is!

772
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,299
You lied! Wake up!

773
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:02,472
Wake up!

774
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:04,049
Wake up!

775
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:07,181
I need you now!

776
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,530
You will do yourself harm
if you keep that up.

777
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:23,535
It didn't work!

778
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,538
You said the yew tree would
make her better, but it didn't!

779
01:20:26,697 --> 01:20:27,823
Fix her! Make her better!

780
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,825
Conor!

781
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,999
You were the one who called me,
Conor O'Malley.

782
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:35,256
If I called you, it was to save her!

783
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:36,461
It was to heal her!

784
01:20:36,623 --> 01:20:38,466
I did not come to heal her.

785
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,672
Yes, you did!

786
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,213
- I came to heal you.
- Me?

787
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,674
I'm not the one who needs healing!

788
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,185
How many times do I have to tell you?

789
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,687
My mum's the one who.

790
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:05,657
Help me.

791
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,079
It is time for the fourth tale.

792
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:19,583
No!

793
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,423
No, please! Get me out of here!

794
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:23,087
It is time for your nightmare.

795
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:24,880
I need to get back to my mum!

796
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:27,299
She is already here.

797
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:33,597
No!

798
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,186
Mum, get out of here!

799
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:36,726
I'm fine!

800
01:21:36,892 --> 01:21:39,111
It's all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

801
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,021
Mum, run! Please, run!

802
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,441
Mum!

803
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,617
Mum!

804
01:21:58,372 --> 01:21:59,715
Conor!

805
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,379
Mum!

806
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,465
Mum!

807
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:10,180
Mum!

808
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:11,093
Conor!

809
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,261
Mum!

810
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,271
- Don't let me go!
- I won't!

811
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,483
- Conor!
- Mum!

812
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:19,689
Conor!

813
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,104
Mum!

814
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:46,720
Conor!

815
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:49,302
- Here is the fourth tale.
- Help!

816
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,433
Here is the truth of Conor O'Malley.

817
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:56,438
Here is your nightmare.

818
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,068
Mum!

819
01:23:10,402 --> 01:23:11,403
Mum!

820
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,531
Mum!

821
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,163
Mum!

822
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,027
This is when I wake up.

823
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:51,610
This is when I always wake up.

824
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,537
The tale is not yet told.

825
01:23:54,696 --> 01:23:56,664
Get me out of here!
I need to see my mum!

826
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,917
She is no longer here, Conor.

827
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,915
I couldn't hold on to her any more.

828
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:03,038
Conor!

829
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,548
- Speak the truth!
- No!

830
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,965
Speak the truth
or you will never leave this place.

831
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:11,422
What truth?
I don't know what you mean!

832
01:24:11,588 --> 01:24:14,216
You must tell me the fourth tale,
Conor O'Malley.

833
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:17,557
You must tell me your nightmare
before it is too late.

834
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:20,472
Yes! Tell me, Conor!
Tell me the truth!

835
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,813
- It'll kill me if l do!
- It will kill you if you do not!

836
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,399
- Speak the truth!
- No!

837
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:29,406
The truth, Conor O'Malley!
Tell me the truth, boy!

838
01:24:29,565 --> 01:24:30,316
No!

839
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:35,659
- Speak the truth!
- No!

840
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:39,701
- Speak the truth, boy!
- I want it to be over!

841
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:54,389
I can't stand
knowing that she'll go.

842
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,059
I want it to be finished.

843
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,887
I let her fall.

844
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,472
I let her die.

845
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,081
That was brave, Conor.

846
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:31,710
You finally said it.

847
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,052
Why didn't it kill me?

848
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,759
I deserve punishment.

849
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,683
I deserve the worst.

850
01:25:42,763 --> 01:25:44,106
DO you?

851
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:50,028
I've known forever
that she wasn't going to make it.

852
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,775
She'd keep telling me
she was getting better all the time

853
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,486
because that's what I wanted to hear.

854
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:00,410
And I believed her.

855
01:26:02,282 --> 01:26:04,080
Except I didn't.

856
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:12,088
And I started to think
how much I wanted it to be over.

857
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:18,265
I couldn't stand how alone
it would make me feel.

858
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:23,763
A part of you wished it would end,
even if it meant losing her.

859
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,608
I let her go.

860
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,983
I could have held on for longer,

861
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,023
but I always let her go.

862
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:39,487
And that is your truth,
Conor O'Malley.

863
01:26:43,782 --> 01:26:45,910
I don't want it to be, though.

864
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:47,870
Now it's for real.

865
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:51,336
Now she's going to die
and it's my fault.

866
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,547
And that is not the truth at all.

867
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,431
You were merely wishing
for an end of pain. Your own pain.

868
01:26:58,588 --> 01:27:02,138
- It is the most human wish there is.
- I didn't mean it, though.

869
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,562
You did, but you also did not.

870
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:10,358
How can both be true?

871
01:27:10,517 --> 01:27:14,567
How can a prince be a murderer
and be loved by his people?

872
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,655
How can an apothecary
be evil-tempered but right-thinking?

873
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:22,572
How can invisible men make themselves
more lonely by being seen?

874
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:23,614
I don't know.

875
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,329
Your stories
never made any sense to me.

876
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:28,994
Because humans are complicated beasts.

877
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:30,708
You believe comforting lies

878
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:35,172
while knowing full well the painful truth
that makes those lies necessary.

879
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:39,255
In the end, Conor,
it is not important what you think.

880
01:27:40,422 --> 01:27:43,392
It is only important what you do.

881
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:45,219
So what do I do?

882
01:27:45,594 --> 01:27:48,768
What you did just now.
You speak the truth.

883
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:49,977
That's all?

884
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,733
You think it's easy?

885
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:54,896
You were willing to die
rather than speak it.

886
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,609
I'm so tired.
So tired of all of this.

887
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,444
Then sleep.

888
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:03,987
There's time.

889
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:06,824
Are you sure? I need to see my mum.

890
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,243
We will both see her tonight.

891
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:10,919
Will you be there?

892
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,294
Yes.

893
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:16,216
It will be the final steps
of my walking.

894
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,847
How does the fourth story end?

895
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:25,433
Sleep.

896
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:27,978
Sleep.

897
01:28:28,386 --> 01:28:30,263
Sleep.

898
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:05,841
Thank God!

899
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:07,008
Conor!

900
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:08,343
Conor!

901
01:29:10,679 --> 01:29:13,478
I've been out of my mind
trying to find you.

902
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,564
- There was something I had to.
- No time. We have to go now.

903
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,213
Damn it!

904
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:48,099
Grandma.

905
01:29:49,676 --> 01:29:51,303
I'm sorry.

906
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:53,722
About the sitting room and...

907
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:55,607
and everything.

908
01:29:58,101 --> 01:29:59,978
It doesn't matter.

909
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:02,564
It doesn't matter.

910
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:18,917
You know, Conor?

911
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,753
You and me...

912
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:24,094
We are not
the most natural fit, are we?

913
01:30:26,129 --> 01:30:28,177
No. I guess not.

914
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:30,934
I guess not either.

915
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:35,063
But we're going to have to learn.

916
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,141
I know.

917
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,026
You do know, don't you?

918
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:42,104
Of course you do.

919
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:50,529
But there is one thing
we have in common.

920
01:30:52,197 --> 01:30:53,323
Your mum.

921
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:00,964
That's what we have in common.

922
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:18,366
It's okay.

923
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:20,502
I see you found him.

924
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:23,500
Thank you.

925
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,172
Hello, my darling.

926
01:32:33,089 --> 01:32:35,091
- Ma?
- Yes, I'm here.

927
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:37,970
I'm here. Can you feel my hand?

928
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,812
- And Conor's here, too.
-ls he?

929
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:30,151
Here is the end of the tale.

930
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:34,158
I'm afraid.

931
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:36,286
Of course you are afraid.

932
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:39,448
It will be hard.

933
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,992
It will be more than hard.

934
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:46,462
But you will make it through,
Conor O'Malley.

935
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,002
You'll stay?

936
01:33:50,166 --> 01:33:52,464
I will be right here.

937
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:02,054
What do I do?

938
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:08,523
Now all that is left is for you
to speak the simplest truth of all.

939
01:34:30,415 --> 01:34:32,509
I don't want you to go.

940
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,886
I know, my love.

941
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:43,019
I don't want you to go.

942
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:51,914
<i>How does the fourth story end?</i>

943
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,835
<i>It ends with the boy
holding on tight to his mother.</i>

944
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,222
<i>And by doing so,
he can finally let her go.</i>

945
01:36:44,048 --> 01:36:45,140
Conor.

946
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:55,393
This is your room now.

947
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:58,021
I've been making it ready.

948
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:03,909
Thank you.

949
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:44,874
A MONSTER CALLS
