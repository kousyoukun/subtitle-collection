8
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,700
Hey, Ash. Where are we?

9
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,100
Well, we just crossed
the Tennessee border.

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,900
- Which would put us...
- Yeah?

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,000
Which would put us...

12
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,125
Right...

13
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:52,076
...Here!

14
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,473
Turn!

15
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,900
What the hell was that?
Are you trying to kill us?

16
00:02:02,902 --> 00:02:07,700
Don't blame me! It's your steering wheel!
Damn thing jerked right out of my hands.

17
00:02:07,705 --> 00:02:11,200
I don't understand it.
I had this thing in for a tune-up yesterday
and they said they'd go over everything.

18
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:16,300
Well you better take it back
because the damn thing don't work.
The one thing that does work is this lousy horn.

19
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,800
Go to hell!
I'm not honking at you!

20
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,210
Jesus Christ!

21
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,700
Hey Scotty!
What's this place like anyway?

22
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,500
Well, the guy that's renting it
says it's an old place.

23
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:36,500
Little run down,
but it's right up in the mountains.

24
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Yeah, and the best part
is that we get it so cheap.

25
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,800
Why are we getting it so cheap?

26
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:44,151
Well, I don't know.
Might be in real bad shape.

27
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,300
You mean, nobody's
seen this place yet?

28
00:02:47,308 --> 00:02:50,000
- Well, not yet.
- Well, it might not be that bad.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,000
- No.
- Actually, it might be kind of nice.

30
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,600
- Yeah.
- It's probably a real pit!

31
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,500
I think this is where we get off.

32
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,800
- This is the bridge we're going to cross?
- Jesus Christ! The whole thing's falling apart on us!

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Don't let the noise fool you girls,
this thing's solid as a rock.

34
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,700
It's supposed to be
one of these on here.

35
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,700
<i>Join Us!</i>

36
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,030
<i>Join Us!</i>

37
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,290
Dead bodies in the cellar.
Dead bodies in the cellar.

38
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,535
Will you stop it?

39
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,200
I would very much like to make
a toast for all this evening.

40
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,356
Ah, as a Greek friend of mine once said...

41
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,653
He said...

42
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,950
I...

43
00:09:45,935 --> 00:09:47,251
Ok, Ok, Ok...

44
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:48,951
Nis, nis...

45
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,610
...Tu, Tu, Tu...
Tu, Ta, Rim.

46
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,200
Which means?

47
00:09:55,205 --> 00:09:57,000
Party down!
Yeah!

48
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,600
What is this?

49
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,100
Whatever it is,
it's still down there.

50
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,400
I don't like cellars.
Let's just close it up.

51
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,100
It's probably just some animal.

52
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,962
An animal?
An animal?

53
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,800
That is the stupidest thing I
ever heard of. Jesus Christ!

54
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
There's something down there.

55
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,700
Maybe it is just some animal.

56
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah, you're probably right.
Probably just some animal.

57
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,100
Cheryl, why don't you go down
and check, make sure?

58
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,000
Scotty!
I'm not going down there!

59
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:59,300
Ok, Ok you cowards.
I'll go.

60
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,301
Be careful.

61
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,770
Back in a minute.

62
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,300
Hey Scotty!
You find anything?

63
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,400
Scotty!

64
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,500
Scotty?!

65
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,100
Scott!

66
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,600
He's just kidding around...

67
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,090
- Isn't he?
- Scotty!!

68
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:02,910
Scott!

69
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,000
Linda, get me a flashlight.

70
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,800
That's the only
one we brought up.

71
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:07,700
Then get the lantern.

72
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:28,505
Scotty?!

73
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:45,497
Boo!!

74
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
Hey! Come here,
I wanna show you something.

75
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,500
Look at all this stuff.

76
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,000
I bet this still shoots.

77
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:08,500
Probably does.

78
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,726
Oh!...God!

79
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,800
Oh God!

80
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,500
Look at this!

81
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,100
Look at this!

82
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,683
This kind of looks like
your old girlfriend.

83
00:15:59,178 --> 00:16:03,200
Come on. Let's take this stuff upstairs.
I'll grab the recorder...

84
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,900
...and you get everything else now.

85
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,700
This guy was a real turd...
everybody hated him...

86
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,000
Like...Like you, kind of.

87
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,212
Yeah, just like me.
I'm gonna break your face.

88
00:16:27,127 --> 00:16:30,400
...also invented this western stuff
He makes all this little models...

89
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:38,100
Ok, shush! Listen to this...
This is the tape I found downstairs.

90
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,500
<i>It has been a number of years since I began excavating
the ruins of Candar with a group of my colleges.</i>

91
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:52,200
<i>Now, my wife and I have retreated to a small cabin
in the solitude of these mountains.</i>

92
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,770
<i>Here I continued my research
undisturbed by the myriad</i>

93
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,600
<i>...distractions of modern civilization
and far from the groves of academe.</i>

94
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,500
<i>I believe I have made a significant find
in the Candarian Ruins.</i>

95
00:17:06,505 --> 00:17:12,000
<i>A Volume of Ancient Sumarian burial practices
and funerary incantations.</i>

96
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,200
<i>It is entitled "Naturon Demonto"</i>

97
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:18,300
<i>...roughly translated,
"Book of the Dead".</i>

98
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,600
<i>The book is bound in human flesh...</i>

99
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,960
<i>...and inked in human blood.</i>

100
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,000
<i>It deals with demons and
demon resurrection and those forces</i>

101
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,200
<i>...which roam the forest and
dark bowers of man's domain.</i>

102
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,000
<i>The first few pages warn that
these enduring creatures may lie...</i>

103
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,770
<i>...dormant but are never truly dead.
They may be recalled to active life</i>

104
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,469
<i>...through the incantations
presented in this book.</i>

105
00:17:45,475 --> 00:17:48,300
<i>It is through recitation
of these passages...</i>

106
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:52,000
<i>...that the demons are given license
to possess the living.</i>

107
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,200
What did you do that for?
It was just getting good!

108
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,558
I just don't want to hear it
anymore, that's all.

109
00:18:02,805 --> 00:18:05,000
Scotty, c'mon.
Leave her alone, man.

110
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,226
Hey, come on...
I just want to hear the rest of it.

111
00:18:08,271 --> 00:18:09,523

Oh my God!

122
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,300
Cheryl! Where're you going?

123
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:51,000
I can't believe this!

124
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:55,500
Scott, you knew not to play that!
I mean c'mon, you knew it was upsetting her.

125
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:57,800
You just don't know when you're
taking something too far.

126
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,100
Don't give me that!
You were playing it too.
You could've shut it off.

127
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,900
I mean... big deal!

128
00:19:03,214 --> 00:19:04,916
She's nuts!

129
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:07,970
I mean it's just a joke,
c'mon!

130
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,070
Jesus Christ. She acts like she's
three years old or something.

131
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,300
Listen. Why don't we stay up
for a while and listen to the storm?

132
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,500
All right, yeah.
Let me check on Cheryl first to see if she's Ok.

133
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,392
Stealing from the blind, eh?

134
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
It's for you.

135
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Ash, how sweet of you.

136
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,867
- Would you put it on?
- Oh, Sure.

137
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,300
I was going to give it to you
before we came up here, but...

138
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,600
...things got so hectic, this is really
the first chance we've had to be alone.

139
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,000
Take a look.

140
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,600
Oh, Ash! It's beautiful!
I really love it. I'll never take it off.

141
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,000
<i>Join Us!</i>

142
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,300
Is anybody out there?

143
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:15,731
I know someone's out there!

144
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,000
I heard you.
I heard you in the cellar.

145
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:06,287
<i>Join Us!</i>

146
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,850
Ashley!

147
00:29:07,785 --> 00:29:08,847
Help!

148
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,355
What the hell happened to you? Cheryl, what's the matter with you?
Did something in the woods do this to you?

149
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:43,750
No! It was the woods themselves! They're alive Ashley!
The trees! They're alive!

150
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,250
Ash. Why don't I take her in the
back room so she can lie down...

151
00:29:46,258 --> 00:29:49,550
I'm not lying down!
I want to get out of here.

152
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:53,050
I want to leave this place right now.
Right now, Ashley!

153
00:29:53,055 --> 00:29:54,050
Wait a minute!

154
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,250
I sure as hell am not
leaving any place tonight.

155
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,071
- Cheryl.
- Cheryl.

156
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,650
Cheryl, there's nothing out there.
Trees do not attack people.

157
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:02,850
Ashley! Will you drive me into town or not?

158
00:30:02,858 --> 00:30:08,350
Right now?! Look, sure, sure, I'll take you
into town, but just listen to what you're saying.

159
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:12,550
I don't care how it sounds.
I wanna get out of this place right now!

160
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,150
Ok, maybe you could stay
somewhere in town tonight.

161
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,850
I know it's not gonna start.
It's not gonna let us leave.

162
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,100
Why are you stopping?

163
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,200
Wait here a minute.

164
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,700
Do you see something?

165
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,700
Where're you going?

166
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,000
Ashley!

167
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,700
Ashley!

168
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,140
It's not going to let us go!
It's not going to let us go!

169
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:17,400
I told you! I told you! It's not going to let us go!
Why won't you listen to me?

170
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,200
<i>I know now that my wife has become
host to a Candarian demon.</i>

171
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,600
<i>I fear that the only way to stop
those possessed by the...</i>

172
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,500
<i>...spirits of the book is through the act
of...bodily dismemberment.</i>

173
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,900
<i>I believe now to avoid this horror,
but for myself, I have seen the dark
shadows moving...</i>

174
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:58,700
<i>...in the woods and I have no doubt
that whatever I have resurrected through
this book is sure to come calling...for me.</i>

175
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,700
Ok, ah, let me think.  Ummm...

176
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,600
It's a seven?

177
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Oh! What suit?

178
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,400
Ahh... diamonds. No wait! Ummm, hearts!

179
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:12,600
- Oh My! It's seven of hearts! You're right!
- Hey Ash! I guessed the card right!

180
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:14,200
Yeah... truly amazing, Linda.

181
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,600
I don't know, but I think it's really some
sort of extra sense or something...

182
00:35:17,647 --> 00:35:20,200
- ...you know, like ESP.
- Ok, try this one...

183
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Ok... It's a seven.

184
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:24,000
- I don't believe it!
- ...of Spades.

185
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,400
Queen of Spades.

186
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,200
Four of Hearts.

187
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,300
Eight of Spades.

188
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:40,500
Two of Spades. Jack of Diamonds.
Jack of Clubs!

189
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,488
Why have you disturbed our sleep?
Awakened us...

190
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:54,114
...from our ancient slumber?
You will die! Like the others before you.

191
00:35:54,395 --> 00:35:58,100
One by one we will take you.

192
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,200
What happened to her?

193
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,900
Did you see her eyes? Oh Ash, I'm scared.
What's wrong with her?

194
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,100
Cheryl! Stop it!

195
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:45,472
- Oh, Shit!
- Join Us! Join...

196
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,150
Ash. I think we ought to get out of here.

197
00:39:21,844 --> 00:39:23,001
Yeah.

198
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,500
We still have a few more hours before morning.

199
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:29,500
I don't think I can wait that long.

200
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,700
You have to.
We all have to!

201
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:39,300
And then in the morning, we'll get in
the car...and we'll take the bridge. And...

202
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,825
Why does she keep making
those horrible noises?!

203
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:46,251
I don't know!

204
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:49,300
And what about her eyes?

205
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:53,146
What about her eyes?

206
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:59,500
For God's Sake,
What happened to her eyes?!

207
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,000
Everything's going to be all right.

208
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,900
Scotty. I think there's
something out there.

209
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,300
Go to bed, and get some sleep. Ok?

210
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,100
Shelly?

211
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:59,900
Thank you, I don't know what I would have done
if I had remained on those hot coals...

212
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:06,379
...burning my pretty flesh. You have
pretty skin.

213
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,600
Give it to us!

214
00:44:23,537 --> 00:44:24,900
Join Us!

215
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:37,000
Join Us!

216
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Hit her!

217
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,900
Hit her!

218
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,300
Hit it!

219
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,900
Scott?

220
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,350
Yeah?

221
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,200
What is...
What are we going to do?

222
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,200
We're going to bury her.

223
00:48:26,347 --> 00:48:28,700
You...can't bury Shelly.

224
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:31,300
- She's a... she's a friend of ours, isn't she?
- Ash, she's dead.

225
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,400
Shelly's dead.

226
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,900
We gotta bury her now.

227
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,562
- Linda's still sleeping. I think once her leg...
- I'm getting out of here.

228
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,700
Scott, we can't take Linda
anywhere with a leg like that.

229
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,750
We don't even know if there is
any other way back besides the bridge.

230
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,400
Well, maybe there's a hiking trail, or an old
road or some other way around the cliff.

231
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,600
I mean there's gotta be another
way besides the bridge.

232
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:04,700
Listen to me. Linda cannot walk with
a leg like that. She can't even stand up.

233
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,702
Well, then we'll leave her here.
Until we can send somebody back.

234
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:12,408
- What are you, crazy?
- Look! I'm getting out!

235
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:17,900
I don't care what happens to her.
She's your girlfriend, you take care of her.

236
00:50:17,908 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm getting the hell out of here.
Right now!

237
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:44,090
Soon all of you will be like me.

238
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,100
And then who will lock you up in the cellar?

239
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:42,400
Ash! Ash!

240
00:51:42,408 --> 00:51:45,100
- Oh my God!
- Help me!

241
00:51:48,182 --> 00:51:49,870
Help me, Ash.

242
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:03,100
Scotty. You're going to be Ok.
You're going to be just fine. You'll see.

243
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,200
Ash. It's not going to let us leave.

244
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,200
Cheryl...Cheryl was right.

245
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,600
We're all going to die here!

246
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,200
No, we're not going to die.

247
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,700
We're all going to die.
All of us!

248
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,500
No, we're not going to die! We're not
going to die! We're gonna get out of here.

249
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,800
Now listen to me, Scotty.
Is there a way around the bridge?

250
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,100
Scotty! Listen to me, please. For God's sake!
Scott!

251
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:53,550
Ash...Ash, I don't wanna die. You're not going
to leave me are you, Ash? Are you?

252
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:59,700
I don't wanna die. You're not going
to leave me here are you? Are you, Ash?

253
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:08,400
Scotty! Now c'mon listen to me for God's sake!
Is there a way around the bridge?

254
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:17,091
There's a way. The trail.
But the trees, Ash. They know.

255
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,000
Don't you see, Ash? They're alive!

256
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:33,650
Shut up!

257
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:34,500
Shut up, Linda.

258
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,500
Shut up!

259
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,500
Kill her!

260
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:00,810
Kill her!

261
00:54:00,812 --> 00:54:05,200
Kill her if you can, loverboy.

262
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:13,520
God! Forgive me, Linda.

263
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,200
Oh, Ash. Help me, please!

264
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:52,000
Ash. Help me, please...Ash.

265
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,400
Oh, Ash. Please, don't let them
take me away again.

266
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,859
- Please.
- No, I won't. I won't. I promise.

267
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,800
Ashley. Ashley, help me.

268
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,500
Let me out of here.

269
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,200
Ashley? Ash, help me.

270
00:55:10,212 --> 00:55:13,129
Let me out of here.
I'm... I'm all right now.

271
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,634
I'm all right now, Ashley...
I'm all right.

272
00:55:19,627 --> 00:55:22,300
Unlock this chain and let me out.

273
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:30,700
Cheryl?

274
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,900
Cheryl?

275
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:18,000
I'm all right now, Ashley!
Come unlock the chain and let me out!

276
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:23,100
I'm all right now.
It's your sister Cheryl.

277
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,000
You bastards!

278
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:35,200
Why are you torturing me like this? Why?!

279
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,070
Shut up!

280
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:52,700
We're going to get you.
We're going to get you.

281
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:58,382
Not another peep.
Time to go to sleep.

282
00:56:58,789 --> 00:56:59,589
We're...

283
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:09,500
It's Useless!

284
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:11,000
Useless!

285
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,900
In time, it will come for him and
then it will come for you!

286
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:43,823
Here. Here.

287
00:57:44,788 --> 00:57:50,000
Now, the sun will be up in an hour or so
and we can all get out of here together.

288
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,100
You, me, Linda, Shelly.

289
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,900
Hmm...Well...Shelly...she...

290
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,800
We'll all be going home together.

291
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,048
Wouldn't you like to be going home?

292
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,300
I bet you'd like that, wouldn't you?

293
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,200
Scott?

294
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,220
Join Us!

295
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Join Us!

296
01:01:50,277 --> 01:01:51,497
Oh, Linda.

297
01:06:03,249 --> 01:06:05,628
Come to me.

298
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:15,998
The door.

299
01:08:38,694 --> 01:08:40,399
The back door.

300
01:08:48,361 --> 01:08:51,800
Shells.
Where did I see that box of shells?

301
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:35,350
<i>We're gonna get you!
We're gonna get you!</i>

302
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:36,702
Shut up, Linda.

303
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:39,403
- We're all gonna die.
- Shut up.

304
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,404
- All of us.
- Shut up!

305
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:47,820
<i>- How sweet of you....God! Forgive me, Linda.
- ...is through the act of...bodily dismemberment.</i>

306
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:52,700
Hit her. Hit her.
Hit it!

307
01:14:40,873 --> 01:14:45,000
Oh, Come on. Come on.
Why are you torturing me like this?

308
01:15:31,653 --> 01:15:33,408
Linda.

309
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:51,930
Join Us!

310
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:55,136
