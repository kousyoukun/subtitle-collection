1
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:59,470
This is MediaBreak. You give us three
minutes and we'll give you the world.

2
00:01:00,013 --> 00:01:02,724
Good morning. I'm Casey Wong.
with Jesse Perkins.

3
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:04,684
Top story: Pretoria.

4
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,605
The threat of nuclear confrontation
in South Africa escalated today

5
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,442
when the ruling white military
government of that city state

6
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,819
unveiled a French-made neutron bomb

7
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:20,611
and affirmed its willingness to use the
device as the city's last line of defence.

8
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:25,997
The president's first press conference
from the Star Wars Peace Platform

9
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:29,083
got off to a shaky start when power failed.

10
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:34,464
causing a brief period of weightlessness
for the visiting president and his staff.

11
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:36,674
We'll be back in a moment.

12
00:01:37,592 --> 00:01:39,636
Is it time for that big operation?

13
00:01:39,761 --> 00:01:43,056
This may be the most important
decision of your life.

14
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:46,935
So come down. And talk to
one of our qualified surgeons.

15
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,103
here at the Family Heart Center.

16
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,272
We feature the complete Jarvik line.

17
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:54,859
Series Seven Sports Heart by Jensen.
Yamaha.

18
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,444
You pick the heart.

19
00:01:56,569 --> 00:01:58,947
Extended warranties. Financing.

20
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:01,157
Qualifies for health-tax credit.

21
00:02:03,076 --> 00:02:05,912
And remember: we care.

22
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,916
Three dead police officers.
one critically injured.

23
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,545
Police union leaders blame
Omni Consumer Products. OCP.

24
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,714
a firm which has entered
into a contract with the city

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,593
to fund and run the Detroit
Metropolitan Police Department.

26
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:23,096
Dick Jones. Division president. OCP.

27
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:27,809
Every policeman knows there are
certain risks that come with the territory.

28
00:02:27,934 --> 00:02:31,563
Any cop'll tell you: "If you can't stand
the heat. Stay out of the kitchen. "

29
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:35,525
Although seriously wounded.
Officer Frank Frederickson escaped

30
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,694
and identified this man.

31
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:41,406
Clarence Boddicker. Unofficial
crime boss of Old Detroit.

32
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:44,993
now sought in connection with
the deaths of 31 police officers.

33
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:48,788
Today he's at large. While doctors
at Henry Ford Memorial Hospital

34
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:53,376
fight to save the life of Officer
Frank Frederickson. Good luck. Frank.

35
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:01,676
DETROIT
POLICE PRECINCT: METRO WEST

36
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:06,264
Attempted murder?
It's not like he killed someone.

37
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:08,892
This is a violation
of my client's civil rights.

38
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:12,437
Make it "aggravated assault"
and I can make bail, in cash, now.

39
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:16,357
Listen, pal. Your client's a scumbag.
You are a scumbag.

40
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:18,776
Scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning.

41
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:22,906
Now get out of my police station
and take laughing boy with you!

42
00:03:30,705 --> 00:03:32,207
Hi.

43
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:35,627
Murphy, transferring in from Metro South.

44
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:39,380
- Nice precinct.
- Yeah, pretty good.

45
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:44,928
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armour and suit up.

46
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:53,520
Not now. Get a cup of coffee.

47
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:57,607
- Stark, any word on Frederickson?
- They're still listing him as critical.

48
00:03:57,732 --> 00:03:59,901
His wife must be going out of her mind.

49
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:02,570
- Murphy, huh?
- Yeah, that's me. Hi.

50
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:05,073
- What brings you to this paradise?
- Beats me.

51
00:04:05,198 --> 00:04:07,367
I think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys here.

52
00:04:07,492 --> 00:04:09,619
Omni Consumer Products.

53
00:04:09,744 --> 00:04:11,788
What a bunch of morons.

54
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:16,334
They're gonna manage
this department right into the ground.

55
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,336
- Where are you from?
- Metro South.

56
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,504
Welcome to hell.

57
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:22,799
Murphy! They cut ten guys loose
over on the East Side.

58
00:04:22,924 --> 00:04:25,468
You try to get back up
when you're in a jam.

59
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:28,388
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

60
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:32,642
I'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em.

61
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,574
The funeral's tomorrow.

62
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:52,453
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

63
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:56,791
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil, as usual.

64
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:02,714
I don't wanna hear
any more talk about strike.

65
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:06,593
We're not plumbers.
We're police officers.

66
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,554
And police officers don't strike.

67
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:15,768
Murphy, front and centre.

68
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:35,747
Hello, tiger.

69
00:05:52,138 --> 00:05:57,519
Lewis! Come here when you've finished
fuckin' around with your suspect.

70
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:04,192
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

71
00:06:04,317 --> 00:06:06,861
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighbourhood.

72
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,448
- Glad to know you, Murphy.
- Pretty neat.

73
00:06:13,201 --> 00:06:16,120
I better drive until you know
your way around.

74
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:20,625
I usually drive when I'm
breaking in a new partner.

75
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:45,775
Do you really think the Old Man is gonna
be there? Why would they invite us?

76
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,113
All division heads are bringing
their support teams. It's big.

77
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:52,365
They must be green-lighting Delta City.

78
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,326
Are you kidding?
They never work ahead of schedule.

79
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:59,247
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series
on line and now he wants to show off.

80
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:01,833
- That's a tough break, Bob.
- What? What?

81
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:06,129
When ED-209 ran into serious delays
and cost overruns,

82
00:07:06,254 --> 00:07:08,923
the Old Man ordered a backup plan.

83
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:13,178
Probably just to light a fire
under Jones's ass.

84
00:07:13,303 --> 00:07:15,847
- Old Bob here gets the assignment.
- Yeah.

85
00:07:16,806 --> 00:07:19,601
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

86
00:07:19,726 --> 00:07:22,979
It's a better plan. Fuckin' Jones.
I'd go to the Old Man if I could.

87
00:07:23,104 --> 00:07:25,648
Don't mess with Jones.
He'll make sushi out of you.

88
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:30,236
- Be careful. I hear Jones is a real shark.
- Who asked you, twerp?

89
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:32,405
What about this police thing?

90
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,659
Their union's been bitching since
we took over. The usual nonsense.

91
00:07:36,784 --> 00:07:38,828
We'll turn things around.

92
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:41,623
Good. Very good. Let's get started.

93
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:50,215
My friends,

94
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,718
I've had this dream...

95
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:56,471
for more than a decade now.

96
00:07:56,596 --> 00:08:00,058
A dream which I've invited
you all to share with me.

97
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:05,313
In six months we begin construction...

98
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:07,482
of Delta City,

99
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:10,235
where Old Detroit now stands.

100
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,907
Old Detroit has a cancer.

101
00:08:16,783 --> 00:08:19,619
The cancer is crime,
and it must be cut out

102
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:23,790
before we employ the two million
workers that will revive this city.

103
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

104
00:08:29,546 --> 00:08:34,509
Shifts in the tax structure have created
an economy ideal for corporate growth.

105
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:40,098
But community services, in this case,
law enforcement, have suffered.

106
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,395
I think it's time we gave something back.

107
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:49,232
Dick.

108
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:02,787
Take a close look at
the track record of this company.

109
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,540
You'll see that we have
gambled in markets

110
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,459
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

111
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:13,715
Hospitals, prisons, space exploration.

112
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,051
I say good business is where you find it.

113
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:24,434
As you know, we have a contract with
the city to run local law enforcement.

114
00:09:25,602 --> 00:09:29,439
But at Security Concepts,
we believe an efficient police force

115
00:09:29,564 --> 00:09:31,733
is only part of the solution.

116
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,944
No. We need something more.

117
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:38,281
We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.

118
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:41,451
A cop who doesn't need to eat or sleep.

119
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:45,705
A cop with superior firepower,
and the reflexes to use it.

120
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:49,542
Fellow executives,

121
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:54,881
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

122
00:09:57,926 --> 00:10:00,094
ED-209.

123
00:10:36,464 --> 00:10:38,758
The Enforcement Droid, series 209,

124
00:10:38,883 --> 00:10:41,678
is a self-sufficient
law-enforcement robot.

125
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:46,808
209 is programmed for urban pacification,
but that is only the beginning.

126
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:49,602
After a successful
tour of duty in Old Detroit,

127
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,524
we can expect 209 to become the hot
military product for the next decade.

128
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,819
- Dr McNamara.
- We'll need an arrest subject.

129
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:01,573
- Mr Kinney, would you give us a hand?
- Yes, sir.

130
00:11:01,698 --> 00:11:06,619
Mr Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

131
00:11:06,744 --> 00:11:09,998
Mr Kinney, use your gun
in a threatening manner.

132
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,252
- Point it at ED-209.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:24,971
Please put down your weapon.

134
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:27,640
You have 20 seconds to comply.

135
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,228
I think you'd better do
what he says, Mr Kinney.

136
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,486
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

137
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:45,950
You are in direct violation
of Penal Code 113, section nine.

138
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:49,204
You now have five seconds to comply.

139
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,164
Four, three,

140
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,333
two, one.

141
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,711
I am now authorised
to use physical force.

142
00:12:23,099 --> 00:12:26,561
Somebody wanna call a goddamn
paramedic? Let's go, Johnson.

143
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,896
Did you pull the plug on this thing?

144
00:12:29,772 --> 00:12:33,526
Don't touch him. Don't touch him!

145
00:12:33,651 --> 00:12:36,946
- He didn't hear the gun drop.
- He didn't hear it?

146
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:41,701
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

147
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:46,205
I'm sure it's only a glitch.
A temporary setback.

148
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,583
You call this a glitch?

149
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:52,003
We begin construction in six months.

150
00:12:52,128 --> 00:12:56,049
Your "setback" could cost us
$50 million in interest payments alone.

151
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:59,469
Not necessarily. Perhaps you know
of the RoboCop programme,

152
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:03,723
developed by myself at Security Concepts
as a contingency against this?

153
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:07,685
- Thank you, Mr Morton. I'm sure this...
- Now wait a minute.

154
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,854
Dick!

155
00:13:11,481 --> 00:13:14,692
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

156
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:17,695
Tell me about your plan.
How long will it take?

157
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,658
We're ready to go. We've restructured the
police department with prime candidates.

158
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,370
I'm confident we can go
to prototype within 90 days.

159
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:31,209
Good. Get your staff together. I'll
expect a full presentation in 20 minutes.

160
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,378
Thank you, sir.

161
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:43,721
Yes! That's how it's done in the big
leagues. You see an opening and go for it.

162
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:47,892
Watch your back, Bob.
Jones is gonna come looking for you.

163
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:51,687
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and I was there to pick it up.

164
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:54,899
Too bad about Kinney, huh?

165
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,068
That's life in the big city.

166
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:02,990
- When do we start?
- As soon as some schmuck volunteers.

167
00:14:19,424 --> 00:14:21,467
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

168
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,471
Yeah, well, my son Jimmy
watches this cop show, TJ Lazer.

169
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:30,768
This Lazer does this when he takes down
a bad guy. So my kid thinks a good cop...

170
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:33,438
And you don't wanna disappoint him.

171
00:14:33,563 --> 00:14:37,233
Yeah, well, role models can
be very important to a boy.

172
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:46,325
OK, OK, I get a kick out of it.

173
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:48,494
All units. All units. Sector nine.

174
00:14:48,619 --> 00:14:50,580
Well, that's...

175
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,332
Why don't you drive?

176
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,170
Suspects are armed
and considered dangerous.

177
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:01,215
Shit!

178
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:06,596
I don't believe it!
You burnt the fuckin' money!

179
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,806
I had to blow the door!
What do you want?

180
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:13,227
It's as good as marked, you asshole!
You stupid, stupid asshole!

181
00:15:13,478 --> 00:15:16,022
- Clarence!
- What do you want?

182
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:18,191
We got a cop on our tail.

183
00:15:25,073 --> 00:15:27,116
- Come on, man. Speed it up.
- Move it!

184
00:15:27,241 --> 00:15:30,161
- Hey, this crate won't outrun a cop's!
- Slow down, then.

185
00:15:30,286 --> 00:15:34,624
- Are you crazy, man?
- Shut the fuck up and do it! Just do it!

186
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:39,253
Central, this is 154. We are in pursuit
of suspect. Request backup.

187
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:40,922
Roger. 154.

188
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:43,966
- Backup currently unavailable.
- Give me your piece.

189
00:15:44,092 --> 00:15:46,427
Backup ETA. 15 minutes.

190
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:50,932
- Bobby, get the door. Everybody load up.
- All right, let's go. Come on!

191
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:53,684
- OK.
- All right, here we go.

192
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,441
Now!

193
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,781
- What the fuck? Where did he go?
- Emil!

194
00:16:06,906 --> 00:16:09,367
Here! He's up here!

195
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:24,674
Get 'em!

196
00:16:32,473 --> 00:16:36,227
- Shit, Clarence. My leg.
- Leon, pick him up.

197
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:38,646
- Ready?
- No. Hang on.

198
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:40,815
Bobby.

199
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,402
- Can you fly, Bobby?
- Clarence, no.

200
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:46,571
Hit it!

201
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,907
No!

202
00:17:11,471 --> 00:17:15,099
This is unit 154. We located that van
by the Old Mill in sector 3D.

203
00:17:15,224 --> 00:17:18,061
- Where's that backup?
- Still unavailable.

204
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:21,064
- Oh, man!
- 20 minutes before units can arrive.

205
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:25,360
Well, you call it.

206
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,237
- Let's do it.
- OK.

207
00:17:34,911 --> 00:17:36,954
Go.

208
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,123
Stay in touch.

209
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:23,042
Freeze.

210
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:28,715
OK, let's see those hands. Nice and easy.

211
00:18:29,757 --> 00:18:32,009
Sure. Mind if I...

212
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,804
zip this up?

213
00:18:53,781 --> 00:18:57,702
- We rob banks but never keep the money.
- Takes money to make money.

214
00:18:57,827 --> 00:19:01,330
We steal money to buy coke, then sell
the coke to make even more money.

215
00:19:01,456 --> 00:19:05,293
- Capital investment.
- Why bother making it? Let's just steal it.

216
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:07,837
Best way to steal money
is free enterprise.

217
00:19:07,962 --> 00:19:10,965
- Smoke?
- No. You know, those things'll kill ya.

218
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,925
Yeah.

219
00:19:13,426 --> 00:19:15,553
Do you wanna live for ever?

220
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,318
Hey. Don't move.

221
00:19:34,364 --> 00:19:36,199
Go ahead and do it.

222
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:39,452
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

223
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,961
Lewis? Lewis!

224
00:19:50,547 --> 00:19:52,257
Lewis, I got a situation here.

225
00:19:52,382 --> 00:19:57,387
OK, tough guy, get up. Turn around.
Spread your legs. That's right.

226
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,182
Lewis. Where are you? You all right?

227
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,519
Put your hands on your head.

228
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:06,229
Lewis?

229
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:13,486
Why don't you let us
take over from here, Emil?

230
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,882
- Your ass is mine.
- No.

231
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,343
Not yet it ain't.

232
00:20:48,688 --> 00:20:50,899
Well, what have we here?

233
00:20:53,443 --> 00:20:55,904
You a good cop, hotshot?

234
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:00,200
Sure you are.

235
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:03,578
Why, you gotta be some kinda great cop.

236
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,747
Come in here all by yourself.

237
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:13,546
Where's your partner?
Where's your partner?

238
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:16,674
Well, guys. The other one was upstairs.

239
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,718
She was sweet.

240
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,097
I took her out.

241
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:29,062
I bet that really pisses you off.

242
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:39,114
You probably don't think
I'm a very nice guy. Do you?

243
00:21:39,739 --> 00:21:42,492
Buddy, I think you're slime.

244
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:48,164
See, I got this problem.

245
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:51,084
Cops don't like me.

246
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:53,545
So I don't like cops.

247
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,522
Well, give the man a hand.

248
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,068
He's all yours.

249
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:33,333
- All right, look out.
- Turn around, man.

250
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,127
Hey, brave boy! Hey, over here!

251
00:22:57,812 --> 00:22:59,855
- I'm outta ammo.
- Me too.

252
00:23:04,856 --> 00:23:06,056
Hey, Clarence, he's still alive.

253
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:10,900
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

254
00:23:17,532 --> 00:23:19,742
OK. Fun's over.

255
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:27,023
OK, let's get outta here.

256
00:23:28,942 --> 00:23:31,236
Good night, sweet prince.

257
00:23:32,404 --> 00:23:34,447
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

258
00:23:57,887 --> 00:23:59,514
Murphy.

259
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:23,397
Let's get him over here.

260
00:24:25,107 --> 00:24:28,235
- The ventilator. Get the mask.
- Get him into OR4.

261
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:35,576
Easy, easy.

262
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:39,872
Slow down now. Slow down.

263
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:41,874
OK, get the door.

264
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:48,589
- Let me get pressure.
- Good. Mask him.

265
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:51,842
Got a pressure of 60 Pel.

266
00:24:51,967 --> 00:24:54,470
We're gonna have to intubate this guy.

267
00:24:57,723 --> 00:25:00,601
OK. We got it in. Breath sounds?

268
00:25:01,477 --> 00:25:03,353
- You're in.
- Other side.

269
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:08,442
- OK. Let's get the MAST trousers out.
- Get the clothes off.

270
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:12,738
Prep him for a central line.
Let's get some blood drawn.

271
00:25:12,863 --> 00:25:14,865
Type and crossing, six units.

272
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:21,205
- His pressure's dropping.
- OK.

273
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,500
I've got a central line in.
Get the pressure back.

274
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,543
Can you do that, Dad?

275
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,590
I really have to tell you something.

276
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,802
I've got 40 Pel.

277
00:25:40,182 --> 00:25:42,518
- Michelle, we're flat here.
- V-fib.

278
00:25:42,643 --> 00:25:44,686
OK, we gotta shock him.

279
00:25:49,274 --> 00:25:52,069
Let's go ahead and
blow up the MAST trousers.

280
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:53,946
Stand clear.

281
00:25:56,907 --> 00:25:59,618
Coarse V-fib. Let's shock him again.

282
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:01,328
Clear.

283
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:06,166
- Flatline.
- Let's go. Intracardiac epinephrine.

284
00:26:07,376 --> 00:26:09,420
- Let's go.
- OK.

285
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:13,966
- All right, it's in.
- There's no pulse.

286
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,136
All right. Let's shock
the flatline, then let's quit.

287
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:19,513
Everybody, clear!

288
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:31,567
All right, I think that's all we can do.
Let's call it. What's the time?

289
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,171
- It's sharp.
- Yeah, it's startin' to roll.

290
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:56,091
Ah... shit!

291
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:04,516
Bring in the LED.

292
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:06,685
Lock it down.

293
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:15,319
- He's on.
- What's the story?

294
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:17,196
We were able to save the left arm.

295
00:27:17,321 --> 00:27:21,617
What? I thought we agreed on total
body prosthesis. Lose the arm, OK?

296
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,786
Jesus, Morton.

297
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,540
- Can he understand me?
- Doesn't matter. We'll blank his memory.

298
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:31,251
I think we should lose the arm.
What do you think?

299
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:34,963
He signed release forms when
he joined the force. He's legally dead.

300
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:37,383
We can do pretty much what we want to.

301
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,594
Lose the arm.

302
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:43,389
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

303
00:27:47,768 --> 00:27:50,104
The entire outer skin will be like this.

304
00:27:50,229 --> 00:27:52,481
It's titanium, laminated with Kevlar.

305
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,650
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

306
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:58,529
Do you come here often?

307
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:04,535
Ow! God! He's got a helluva grip.

308
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,664
It's 400 foot-pounds.
He could crush every bone in your hand.

309
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,417
All right, attach it to his shoulder.

310
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,585
I like that.

311
00:28:18,716 --> 00:28:21,176
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

312
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,937
Hey, look! Look! He's watching us!

313
00:28:32,062 --> 00:28:34,440
Hi! Happy New Year.

314
00:28:37,651 --> 00:28:39,695
This is for you.

315
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:44,324
Happy New Year.

316
00:28:49,621 --> 00:28:53,959
We get the best of both worlds. The
fastest reflexes technology has to offer.

317
00:28:54,084 --> 00:28:55,836
Computer-assisted memory.

318
00:28:55,961 --> 00:28:59,214
A lifetime of on-the-street
law-enforcement programming.

319
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:02,301
It is my great pleasure to present to you...

320
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:06,430
RoboCop.

321
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:11,685
Come on, come on.

322
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,479
It's for you.

323
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:15,647
Go, Robo.

324
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:35,626
I'm what you call a repeat offender.

325
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:40,547
I repeat, I will offend again.
I get my orders from a higher source.

326
00:29:40,672 --> 00:29:42,716
Shut up, asshole.

327
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:50,474
- Bring him in through the side door.
- A cell has been set up for us.

328
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,893
- What's goin' on here?
- Who is this guy?

329
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,978
- Sergeant Reed.
- What's this about?

330
00:29:55,104 --> 00:29:58,816
It's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

331
00:29:58,941 --> 00:30:02,319
- We've got four or five days...
- This is bullshit!

332
00:30:02,444 --> 00:30:04,696
I take my orders from...

333
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,173
What is this shit?

334
00:30:44,027 --> 00:30:46,363
When you are at rest,
you will sit in the chair.

335
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:48,407
Yes, I understand.

336
00:30:48,532 --> 00:30:52,870
- What about tracking?
- We check his location with one of these.

337
00:30:54,788 --> 00:30:57,875
- How does he eat?
- His digestive system is very simple.

338
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,504
This processor dispenses a rudimentary
paste that sustains his organic systems.

339
00:31:10,637 --> 00:31:12,681
Tastes like baby food.

340
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,185
Knock yourself out.

341
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:29,323
- OK, let's start with tracking.
- Give me a grid.

342
00:31:30,449 --> 00:31:32,326
Target.

343
00:31:32,451 --> 00:31:33,994
Target.

344
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,163
Now follow.

345
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:45,089
Voice-stress analyser.
One, two, three.

346
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:47,966
Record.

347
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:49,843
- Now play back.
- Bring it up 50%.

348
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:51,929
Now play back.

349
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:53,806
- He's ready.
- We got it.

350
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:55,974
Clear out.

351
00:31:57,518 --> 00:31:59,561
What are your prime directives?

352
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:03,857
Serve the public trust.
Protect the innocent. Uphold the law.

353
00:32:07,569 --> 00:32:10,114
That's good. That's very good.

354
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:20,999
I fuckin' love that guy.

355
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:01,999
- It's Supercop.
- Look at that fuckin' gun.

356
00:33:18,432 --> 00:33:19,641
Shit.

357
00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:23,103
- This guy is really good.
- He's not a guy, he's a machine.

358
00:33:23,228 --> 00:33:25,898
What are they gonna do? Replace us?

359
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,406
Come on.

360
00:33:39,411 --> 00:33:41,538
Reed! He needs a car.

361
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,251
Thank you.

362
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,796
Sure. Any time.

363
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:51,382
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy.

364
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,043
I'd buy that for a dollar.

365
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:45,853
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Empty the register. Put it in the bag.

366
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,479
Excuse me?

367
00:34:47,604 --> 00:34:51,108
Give me your money, all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

368
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,277
Now, move!

369
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:55,988
Open the safe, pops.

370
00:34:56,113 --> 00:34:59,199
- Open the goddamn safe!
- We don't have a safe.

371
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:03,245
Shit. There's your goddamn safe!
Open the son of a bitch!

372
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:08,375
I'll count to three and you better
open that son of a bitch. Come on!

373
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,711
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

374
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:14,381
- I'll open the safe.
- Good boy.

375
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:20,554
You better open that
on the count of three. One, two...

376
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:25,350
Fuck me.

377
00:35:25,893 --> 00:35:28,062
Drop the gun.
You are under arrest.

378
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:32,149
Fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!

379
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:39,406
Fuck me!

380
00:35:50,209 --> 00:35:53,003
Thank you for your cooperation.
Good night.

381
00:35:54,296 --> 00:35:56,757
I'll buy that for a dollar!

382
00:36:14,483 --> 00:36:16,860
Don't touch me!

383
00:36:16,985 --> 00:36:20,322
- We don't want your money!
- We want you!

384
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:25,160
Take it easy! We're not gonna hurt you!

385
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:29,373
- There's too much hair.
- I know. Give her a haircut.

386
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,380
Hey! There's more hair... down there!

387
00:36:40,092 --> 00:36:41,552
No!

388
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:55,065
Let the woman go.
You are under arrest.

389
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,525
Shit.

390
00:36:57,317 --> 00:37:00,863
You better back up, pal,
cos he's gonna kill her!

391
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:04,158
He's gonna kill her!

392
00:37:17,087 --> 00:37:19,798
Your move, creep.

393
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,010
It's OK!

394
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:29,099
Oh, God, I was so scared.

395
00:37:29,224 --> 00:37:31,268
Thank you! Thank you!

396
00:37:34,104 --> 00:37:36,774
Madam, you have suffered
an emotional shock.

397
00:37:36,899 --> 00:37:39,109
I will notify a rape crisis centre.

398
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,624
All units. Close intersection...

399
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,551
I don't care. Get those men
by the stairs now. Hit it!

400
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,140
Terrorism has never been a factor
in city politics before.

401
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:14,812
But today, former city councilman
Ron Miller entered city hall with a gun.

402
00:38:14,937 --> 00:38:18,899
He's now on the second floor, holding
Mayor Gibson and his staff hostage.

403
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:22,736
We do believe that Miller
has killed one of the hostages.

404
00:38:23,278 --> 00:38:27,157
- Lieutenant, what's next?
- We wait. Terrorism is a tricky business.

405
00:38:27,282 --> 00:38:31,328
Massive and immediate retaliation
is the best policy but...

406
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:33,789
- Excuse us.
- Where are you goin'?

407
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:46,260
Hey, let's have some crowd control.
Get these people back.

408
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:50,723
- Where do you think you're goin'?
- Keep him talking.

409
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:05,529
OK, Miller. Don't hurt the mayor.
We'll give you whatever you want.

410
00:39:05,821 --> 00:39:08,115
First, don't fuck with me.

411
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,284
I'm a desperate man.

412
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:12,786
And second,
I want some fresh coffee!

413
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:16,248
And third, I want a recount.

414
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,543
And no matter how it turns out,
I want my old job back.

415
00:39:19,668 --> 00:39:22,046
- OK.
- And I want a bigger office.

416
00:39:23,464 --> 00:39:27,259
And I want a new car.
And I want the city to pay for it all!

417
00:39:27,384 --> 00:39:29,386
What kind of car. Miller?

418
00:39:29,511 --> 00:39:34,475
Something with reclining leather seats
that goes fast and gets shitty gas mileage.

419
00:39:34,683 --> 00:39:37,686
How about the... 6000 SUX?

420
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,855
Yeah.

421
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,607
OK, sure.

422
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:45,611
What about cruise control?
Does it come with that?

423
00:39:46,028 --> 00:39:50,240
No problem, Miller. Let the mayor go,
we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

424
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,703
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

425
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,833
When people jerk me off, I kill 'em.
Do you wanna see?

426
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,258
Get up, Your Honour. Get up.
Your public wants to see you.

427
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:12,304
Nobody ever takes me seriously.

428
00:40:13,138 --> 00:40:16,892
Well, get serious now
and kiss the mayor's ass goodbye.

429
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:33,283
RoboCop. Who is he? What is he?
Where does he come from?

430
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:38,038
He is OCP's newest soldier
in their crime-management programme.

431
00:40:38,163 --> 00:40:40,666
OCP spokesmen claim
the fearless machine

432
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,876
has crooks on the run in Old Detroit.

433
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:46,797
Today. Kids at Lee lacocca
Elementary School got to meet in person

434
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:49,717
what their parents only
read about in comic books.

435
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:54,388
Robo. Excuse me. Any special message
for all the kids watching at home?

436
00:40:55,806 --> 00:40:57,474
Stay out of trouble.

437
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:03,313
More fighting in the Mexican crisis when
American troops participated in a raid

438
00:41:03,439 --> 00:41:08,068
with Mexican nationals against
rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.

439
00:41:08,193 --> 00:41:09,278
Now this.

440
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:12,990
Red alert. Red alert. Red alert.

441
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:17,870
- You crossed my line of death.
- Then dismantle your MX stockpile.

442
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:20,080
Pakistan is threatening my border.

443
00:41:20,205 --> 00:41:22,666
That's it. Buster.
No more military aid.

444
00:41:25,878 --> 00:41:28,756
"Nukem".
Get them before they get you.

445
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,056
Today labour leaders agreed to sanction
construction of OCP's Delta City.

446
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:40,059
creating an estimated
one million new jobs.

447
00:41:40,184 --> 00:41:44,146
despite questions about worker safety
in dangerous Old Detroit.

448
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:47,983
Robert Morton. Vice President.
Security Concepts. OCP.

449
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:49,860
I can't comment on Delta City.

450
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:52,404
It's not my division. But I will say this.

451
00:41:52,529 --> 00:41:57,701
At Security Concepts. We're projecting
the end of crime in Old Detroit in 40 days.

452
00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:00,746
There's a new guy in town.
His name's RoboCop.

453
00:42:03,791 --> 00:42:07,503
Hey, hey, Bobby boy.
Vice president. Congratulations.

454
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,964
- Handball Tuesday night?
- Bill, I'd love to, but I got a date.

455
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,133
Couple of models coming to my place.

456
00:42:13,258 --> 00:42:15,302
I'd buy that for a dollar.

457
00:42:19,098 --> 00:42:21,141
Welcome to the club, Bob.

458
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:28,649
You're making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with RoboCop.

459
00:42:28,774 --> 00:42:32,361
- We try.
- Let me in on the bottom line, pal.

460
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:34,571
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

461
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:38,325
He's got this killer rep,
but it's a smokescreen.

462
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:42,538
He's lost his teeth. The guy's a pussy.

463
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:44,873
Are we talkin' about
the same Dick Jones?

464
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:47,960
He's old, we're young.
And that's life.

465
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:02,933
I gotta go.
I got a meeting.

466
00:43:12,985 --> 00:43:15,404
Congratulations, Bob.

467
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:17,364
Thanks.

468
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:21,118
I remember when I was
a young executive for this company.

469
00:43:21,243 --> 00:43:23,954
I used to call the Old Man funny names.

470
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,123
"Iron butt."

471
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:28,292
"Boner."

472
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,711
Once I even called him...

473
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,464
"asshole".

474
00:43:38,093 --> 00:43:40,888
But there was always respect.

475
00:43:41,013 --> 00:43:43,474
I always knew where the line was drawn.

476
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:48,687
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

477
00:43:49,813 --> 00:43:55,444
You've insulted me, and you've insulted
this company with your bastard creation.

478
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:58,697
I had a guaranteed
military sale with ED-209.

479
00:43:58,822 --> 00:44:02,576
Renovation programme.
Spare parts for 25 years.

480
00:44:02,701 --> 00:44:05,245
Who cares if it worked or not?

481
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:10,084
The Old Man thought
it was pretty important... Dick.

482
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:20,803
You know,

483
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:22,971
he's a sweet old man.

484
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:27,559
And he means well.

485
00:44:28,894 --> 00:44:30,938
But he's not gonna live for ever.

486
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:35,317
And I'm number two around here.

487
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:38,946
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

488
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:43,492
You just...

489
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:46,870
fucked with the wrong guy.

490
00:44:47,204 --> 00:44:49,915
You're out of your fuckin' mind.

491
00:44:54,712 --> 00:45:00,509
You better pray that that unholy
monster of yours doesn't screw up.

492
00:45:20,279 --> 00:45:22,740
- You hungry?
- No, thanks.

493
00:46:11,705 --> 00:46:14,458
Goddamn rebels blew up
the airport in Acapulco.

494
00:46:14,583 --> 00:46:18,420
Great. We were going there next week.
Hey, what was that?

495
00:46:23,509 --> 00:46:26,261
Hey, look. Bucket boy's on line.

496
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:44,697
Hey. Hey, halt.

497
00:46:44,822 --> 00:46:46,865
Stop! Wait a minute!

498
00:46:47,282 --> 00:46:50,160
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know. He just left.

499
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:53,122
Just left?

500
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,332
Roosevelt!

501
00:46:55,457 --> 00:46:57,501
Rosie, we got a problem.

502
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,589
Out of the way.

503
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:04,758
Take a look at this.

504
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,013
Shit. Call Bob Morton.

505
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:22,234
Jerry, book him.
I'll catch up with you later.

506
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:31,118
Hello. I haven't really had
a chance to introduce myself.

507
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:33,829
I'm Anne Lewis.

508
00:47:34,997 --> 00:47:37,041
Do you have a name?

509
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:45,174
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

510
00:47:47,176 --> 00:47:49,219
That's not really what I meant.

511
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,680
Don't you have a name?

512
00:47:55,851 --> 00:47:59,021
Murphy. It's you.

513
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:07,196
- You really don't remember me, do you?
- Excuse me.

514
00:48:07,905 --> 00:48:11,992
I have to go. Somewhere
there is a crime happening.

515
00:48:12,117 --> 00:48:13,744
Stop!

516
00:48:14,953 --> 00:48:17,790
- What did you talk to him about?
- Nothing.

517
00:48:17,915 --> 00:48:19,708
- Shit.
- Shit.

518
00:48:23,045 --> 00:48:26,090
Stop! Hey, you there, stop!

519
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,139
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer.

520
00:48:34,264 --> 00:48:36,100
Come on.

521
00:48:36,725 --> 00:48:39,395
I was assured full cooperation
by this precinct.

522
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,648
If it gets screwed up by your grunts,
I'll have your job.

523
00:48:42,773 --> 00:48:45,317
- What's the update?
- It's hard to be 100%.

524
00:48:45,442 --> 00:48:48,278
This system wasn't designed
for a somatic response.

525
00:48:48,404 --> 00:48:50,531
He had a dream. A dream.

526
00:48:50,656 --> 00:48:53,826
- This cop saw fit to question him.
- I didn't question him.

527
00:48:53,951 --> 00:48:56,787
- I asked him his name. He didn't know.
- Oh, great.

528
00:48:56,912 --> 00:48:58,914
Let me make it real clear for you.

529
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,876
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program. He's product.

530
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:05,045
- Is that clear?
- Sure.

531
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,881
- I say pull him in, run a systems check.
- Take a week.

532
00:49:08,006 --> 00:49:12,094
You wanna take him off line because
he had a dream? Are you kidding?

533
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:14,263
Let's get out of here.

534
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:17,266
Listen, Reed. Try to keep
one thing in mind.

535
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:22,312
This project doesn't concern cops.
It's classified. It's OCP.

536
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:24,481
Got it, mister?

537
00:49:26,775 --> 00:49:29,695
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

538
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,409
Sorry, Sarge. I fucked up.

539
00:49:37,578 --> 00:49:41,915
Forget it, kid.
This guy's a serious asshole.

540
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:16,658
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or I blow your brains out.

541
00:50:22,164 --> 00:50:24,249
Now fill it up on number seven.

542
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:32,424
Don't do nothin' stupid, man.

543
00:50:34,718 --> 00:50:36,762
I'm a good shot.

544
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:41,100
I could hit you in the eye from here.

545
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,738
Hey, man? What you readin' in there?

546
00:51:00,786 --> 00:51:04,707
You a college boy or somethin'? Huh?

547
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:11,088
I bet you think you're pretty smart, huh?
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

548
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:13,757
What do you say we find out? Huh?

549
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:17,344
I'm talkin' to you!
What do you say? Huh? Huh?

550
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:19,304
I'm talkin' to you!

551
00:51:21,432 --> 00:51:23,475
Drop it.

552
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:29,273
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

553
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:35,779
I know you.

554
00:51:36,363 --> 00:51:39,616
You're dead.
We killed you.

555
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:43,912
We killed you!

556
00:51:45,622 --> 00:51:47,666
We killed you!

557
00:51:58,302 --> 00:52:01,555
You're dead. We killed you.

558
00:52:47,393 --> 00:52:49,728
Who are you?

559
00:52:51,772 --> 00:52:53,816
Who are you?

560
00:53:08,622 --> 00:53:11,583
- Can I help you, sir?
- No.

561
00:53:11,709 --> 00:53:14,169
What is it exactly that you want?

562
00:53:14,878 --> 00:53:17,756
Hey! You can't enter here.

563
00:53:18,215 --> 00:53:20,759
Wait a second. Hey, just a minute.

564
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:24,138
This is a restricted area.

565
00:54:32,456 --> 00:54:34,583
Murphy. It's you.

566
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:37,211
Murphy. It's you.

567
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:39,505
Murphy. It's you.

568
00:55:35,352 --> 00:55:39,273
Welcome. Shopper. Let's take
a stroll through your new home.

569
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:44,486
This is a one-family house. Situated
near schools and shopping centres.

570
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:47,781
This progressive development
has a growth factor of seven.

571
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:12,347
Wow!

572
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:15,601
Can you do that, Dad?

573
00:56:23,734 --> 00:56:26,528
It doesn't matter
who cooks in your family.

574
00:56:26,653 --> 00:56:30,741
because this kitchen by Food Concepts
makes everything...

575
00:56:51,303 --> 00:56:53,347
Dad.

576
00:56:57,059 --> 00:56:59,520
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

577
00:57:19,123 --> 00:57:21,542
I really have to tell you something.

578
00:57:25,379 --> 00:57:26,964
I love you.

579
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:42,604
Hey. Have you thought it all over?
Why not make me an offer?

580
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:18,307
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

581
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:25,856
OK.

582
00:58:33,072 --> 00:58:35,115
Let's talk.

583
00:58:38,827 --> 00:58:40,871
You son of a bitch.

584
00:58:45,209 --> 00:58:48,295
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

585
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:51,215
"Vice president."

586
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,384
It just turns me on.

587
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:58,347
God, you girls are so great.
I love to be with intelligent women.

588
00:58:58,472 --> 00:59:00,849
Smart is so sexy.

589
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:06,146
I know. Sometimes I could
just think of something,

590
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:09,692
and it could just get me so horny.

591
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:14,738
Yeah, well, a mind
is a terrible thing to waste.

592
00:59:16,532 --> 00:59:18,575
I get bored so easily.

593
00:59:19,827 --> 00:59:23,497
Yeah. And you need
lots of stimulation, Bobby.

594
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,668
Yes, I do.

595
00:59:27,793 --> 00:59:29,837
- Don't move.
- I won't.

596
00:59:32,423 --> 00:59:35,843
- Bob...
- What?

597
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:39,263
- Bob, save some for me.
- Don't worry.

598
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,519
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

599
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:53,944
How ya doin'?

600
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:57,740
Bitches, leave.

601
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:01,910
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

602
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:04,538
You gonna call me?

603
01:00:05,539 --> 01:00:07,583
What the fuck are you doing?

604
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:12,212
Do you know who I am? If you think
you're gonna get away with this...

605
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:16,925
Goddamn it!

606
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,723
Stop! I'll give you anything you want!

607
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:25,142
Just please don't kill me, all right?

608
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:33,275
Hello. Buddy boy. Dick Jones here.

609
01:00:33,984 --> 01:00:38,947
I guess you're on your knees about now.
begging for your life.

610
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:43,202
Pathetic. You don't feel
so cocky now. Do you. Bob?

611
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:46,288
Whatever he's payin' you,
I'll double it right now.

612
01:00:46,413 --> 01:00:49,458
You know what the tragedy is here. Bob?

613
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:52,753
We could have been friends.

614
01:00:53,212 --> 01:00:56,131
But you wouldn't go through
proper channels.

615
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:58,467
You went over my head.

616
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,470
That hurt.

617
01:01:01,595 --> 01:01:06,350
But life goes on. It's an old story.
the fight for love and glory. Huh. Bob?

618
01:01:08,519 --> 01:01:11,021
It helps if you think of it as a game. Bob.

619
01:01:11,939 --> 01:01:16,276
Every game has a winner... and a loser.

620
01:01:24,368 --> 01:01:27,955
I'm cashing you out. Bob.

621
01:01:49,601 --> 01:01:51,854
I don't wanna pay that, Sal.

622
01:01:53,272 --> 01:01:57,192
I don't give a shit what you wanna pay.
I set the prices here.

623
01:01:57,317 --> 01:02:01,822
Listen, pal. Maybe you haven't heard.
I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

624
01:02:01,947 --> 01:02:04,283
You want space in my marketplace?

625
01:02:04,408 --> 01:02:06,994
You're gonna have to give me
a volume discount.

626
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,496
I'm not into discounts.

627
01:02:09,621 --> 01:02:12,916
Joe, show the man what
we brought him for Christmas.

628
01:02:21,008 --> 01:02:24,636
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

629
01:02:31,226 --> 01:02:34,188
OK, let me try to
put this in perspective.

630
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:37,775
You killed a bunch of cops.

631
01:02:38,525 --> 01:02:42,446
The word is you've got a lot
of heavy connections downtown,

632
01:02:43,697 --> 01:02:46,575
and you make a lot of
my friends nervous.

633
01:02:49,578 --> 01:02:51,705
A lot of people

634
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:56,001
would love to see a guy like me
and a guy like you out of business.

635
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:59,505
I don't know. I don't know.

636
01:03:00,464 --> 01:03:03,175
Maybe I'm just not making myself clear.

637
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:07,930
I don't wanna fuck with you, Sal.

638
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:13,435
But I got the connections.
I got the sales organisation.

639
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:19,900
I got the muscle to shove enough of
this factory so far up your stupid wop ass

640
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,444
that you'll shit snow for a year.

641
01:03:22,569 --> 01:03:25,906
Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.

642
01:03:26,031 --> 01:03:29,118
Ooh, guns, guns, guns.

643
01:03:31,245 --> 01:03:35,207
Come on, Sal!
The Tigers are playin'... tonight.

644
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:39,753
I never miss a game.

645
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,844
Just kidding.

646
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,025
Go!

647
01:04:05,237 --> 01:04:06,780
Go.

648
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:27,092
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

649
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:30,637
Oh, fuck you.

650
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:10,070
Clarence Boddicker,
you are under arrest.

651
01:06:10,195 --> 01:06:12,906
You have the right to remain silent.

652
01:06:13,198 --> 01:06:14,908
Fuck you.

653
01:06:20,122 --> 01:06:22,416
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

654
01:06:22,833 --> 01:06:24,960
I'm protected.
I've got protection!

655
01:06:25,085 --> 01:06:28,088
- You have the right to an attorney.
- What is this shit?

656
01:06:33,093 --> 01:06:35,554
Goddamn it. Goddamn it!

657
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:38,515
Listen to me!
Listen to me, you fuck!

658
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:42,770
There's another guy.
He's OCP. He's the senior president.

659
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:46,607
Anything you say
may be used against you.

660
01:06:46,732 --> 01:06:48,734
It's Dick Jones!

661
01:06:53,238 --> 01:06:55,783
Don't you get it, you cocksucker?

662
01:06:56,575 --> 01:06:58,786
I work for Dick Jones!

663
01:06:58,911 --> 01:07:00,704
Dick Jones!

664
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:02,873
He's the number two guy at OCP.

665
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:05,042
OCP runs the cops.

666
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:08,754
You're a cop.

667
01:07:11,465 --> 01:07:12,966
Cop.

668
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:26,021
Yes, I am a cop.

669
01:07:30,109 --> 01:07:33,946
- I don't like it either, but listen...
- You listen to me, you asshole!

670
01:07:34,154 --> 01:07:38,075
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force!

671
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:41,453
Without cops, this city
would tear itself apart!

672
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:44,331
The union thinks you should know
we had a strike vote.

673
01:07:44,456 --> 01:07:47,918
- We lost five guys last week.
- We're gettin' creamed out there.

674
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,556
- Book him.
- What's the charge?

675
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:07,813
He's a cop killer.

676
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:14,695
Shit.

677
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:17,698
Just give me my fuckin' phone call.

678
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:28,125
I understand. The lawyers'll
have you out in 24 hours.

679
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,294
Just don't say anything else.

680
01:08:31,128 --> 01:08:33,172
Jesus, you really screwed up.

681
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:39,530
Don't you get it?
I work for Dick Jones!

682
01:09:39,655 --> 01:09:40,739
Dick Jones!

683
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:45,494
I work for Dick Jones!

684
01:09:45,619 --> 01:09:49,415
He runs OCP.
OCP runs the cops.

685
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:57,840
Come in, Officer. I don't usually
see anyone without an appointment.

686
01:09:57,965 --> 01:10:02,428
- In your case, I'll make an exception.
- You are under arrest.

687
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:05,723
- On what charge?
- Aiding and abetting a known felon.

688
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:09,435
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

689
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:13,772
- You'd better take me in.
- I will.

690
01:10:27,494 --> 01:10:29,538
What's the matter, Officer?

691
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:34,376
I'll tell you what's the matter.

692
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:37,880
It's a little insurance policy
called Directive 4.

693
01:10:38,172 --> 01:10:41,216
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

694
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:47,347
Any attempt to arrest a senior officer
of OCP results in shutdown.

695
01:10:50,934 --> 01:10:52,770
What did you think?

696
01:10:54,146 --> 01:10:56,857
That you were an ordinary police officer?

697
01:10:56,982 --> 01:11:01,987
You're our product. And we can't have
our products turning against us, can we?

698
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:09,036
Still a little fight left in you.

699
01:11:14,541 --> 01:11:17,836
Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.

700
01:11:23,384 --> 01:11:26,095
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

701
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,680
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

702
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:43,130
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower.

703
01:13:54,868 --> 01:13:57,454
Prepare to fire.

704
01:13:57,663 --> 01:14:00,040
- Wait a second!
- He's a cop, for God's sake!

705
01:14:00,165 --> 01:14:02,960
- You can't do that!
- We have orders to destroy it.

706
01:14:03,252 --> 01:14:05,713
- Aw, shit!
- You're maniacs!

707
01:14:05,838 --> 01:14:08,090
Fire at will!

708
01:14:25,733 --> 01:14:27,359
Move in!

709
01:15:24,541 --> 01:15:28,295
Murphy! Murphy, it's me.

710
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:32,966
Lewis.

711
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:50,567
Lieutenant, level three!
He's on level three!

712
01:15:50,693 --> 01:15:52,736
Open fire!

713
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:12,548
It's back.

714
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:15,050
Big is back. Because bigger is better.

715
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:22,099
Good evening. I'm Jesse Perkins.
with Casey Wong.

716
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:24,268
Top story: Santa Barbara.

717
01:16:24,393 --> 01:16:28,188
10.000 acres of wooded residential land
were scorched in an instant

718
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:32,026
when a laser cannon aboard
the Strategic Defense Peace Platform

719
01:16:32,151 --> 01:16:35,612
misfired today during
routine startup tests. Casey?

720
01:16:35,738 --> 01:16:40,409
It was a day of mourning for the families
of 113 people known dead at this hour.

721
01:16:40,534 --> 01:16:45,414
among them two former United States
presidents who had retired in the area.

722
01:16:45,539 --> 01:16:47,708
A day of mourning for a country.

723
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:51,670
Police union representatives and OCP
continue negotiations today

724
01:16:51,795 --> 01:16:55,049
in hopes of averting
a city-wide strike by police.

725
01:16:55,174 --> 01:16:57,926
scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.

726
01:16:58,052 --> 01:16:59,636
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

727
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:02,765
They're still on duty.
but what about tomorrow?

728
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:06,352
That's what we asked people in
the crime-plagued Lexington area.

729
01:17:06,477 --> 01:17:11,231
They're public servants. They got job
security. They're not supposed to strike.

730
01:17:11,357 --> 01:17:13,692
It's a free society.

731
01:17:13,817 --> 01:17:17,321
Except there ain't nothin' free.
because there's no guarantees.

732
01:17:17,446 --> 01:17:20,908
You're on your own.
It's the law of the jungle.

733
01:17:36,507 --> 01:17:38,550
Hiya... Barbara.

734
01:17:39,635 --> 01:17:41,845
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

735
01:17:42,679 --> 01:17:45,557
But when I'm done,
I've got some free time.

736
01:17:45,683 --> 01:17:49,103
Maybe you could... fit me in.

737
01:17:50,604 --> 01:17:52,648
He's expecting you, Mr Boddicker.

738
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:58,904
You can keep the gum.

739
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:08,205
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

740
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:12,209
- That thing is still alive.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

741
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:15,921
The officer who arrested you.
The one you spilled your guts to.

742
01:18:17,923 --> 01:18:21,176
Take a look at my face, Dick.

743
01:18:21,301 --> 01:18:23,345
He was trying to kill me.

744
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:25,514
He's a cyborg, you idiot!

745
01:18:26,807 --> 01:18:29,351
He recorded every word you said.

746
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:31,937
His memory is admissible as evidence.

747
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,940
You involved me.

748
01:18:36,442 --> 01:18:38,360
You're gonna have to kill it.

749
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:43,824
Well, listen, chief.

750
01:18:44,658 --> 01:18:47,953
Your company built the fucking thing.

751
01:18:48,078 --> 01:18:50,414
Now I gotta deal with it?

752
01:18:50,539 --> 01:18:52,833
I don't have time for this bullshit.

753
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:57,504
Suit yourself. But Delta City
begins construction in two months.

754
01:18:57,629 --> 01:19:00,174
That's two million workers
living in trailers.

755
01:19:00,299 --> 01:19:04,428
That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.

756
01:19:05,345 --> 01:19:09,767
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

757
01:19:09,892 --> 01:19:13,896
One man could control it all, Clarence.

758
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:18,567
Well, I guess we're gonna
be friends after all,

759
01:19:19,276 --> 01:19:21,320
Richard.

760
01:19:27,951 --> 01:19:29,995
Destroy it.

761
01:19:30,913 --> 01:19:33,415
We're gonna need some major fire power.

762
01:19:36,043 --> 01:19:39,463
You got access to military weaponry?

763
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:42,216
We practically are the military.

764
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:23,340
- Did you bring the gun?
- The precinct was deserted.

765
01:20:23,465 --> 01:20:25,843
Half the force didn't
show up for work today.

766
01:20:25,968 --> 01:20:29,638
Everyone else walks out at midnight.
I guess we're on strike.

767
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:31,807
I wasn't sure what you needed.

768
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:33,976
I sort of grabbed things.

769
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:38,105
Your gun.

770
01:20:38,856 --> 01:20:40,774
You asked for this.

771
01:20:44,653 --> 01:20:47,239
I brought you some food.

772
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:50,367
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

773
01:21:14,016 --> 01:21:16,894
You may not like what
you're going to see.

774
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,889
It's really good to see you again, Murphy.

775
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:02,398
Murphy had a wife and son.
What happened to them?

776
01:22:03,357 --> 01:22:07,111
Well, after the funeral, she moved away.

777
01:22:07,236 --> 01:22:09,279
Where did they go?

778
01:22:10,406 --> 01:22:12,491
She thought you were dead.

779
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:14,660
She started over again.

780
01:22:16,995 --> 01:22:19,039
I can feel them.

781
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,003
But I can't remember them.

782
01:22:30,884 --> 01:22:32,928
Leave me alone.

783
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:22,561
Happy birthday. Dave.
She's from me.

784
01:23:24,438 --> 01:23:26,857
Well. Hey. Can I have you both?

785
01:23:27,733 --> 01:23:30,652
Sure! We've had our shots.

786
01:23:32,696 --> 01:23:34,615
I'd buy that for a dollar.

787
01:23:40,454 --> 01:23:43,457
Hey, Emil. How's the "Grey Bar Hotel"?

788
01:23:43,582 --> 01:23:47,878
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.
And nobody popped my cherry.

789
01:23:48,003 --> 01:23:50,130
Emil, how you doin', man?
Good to see you.

790
01:23:50,255 --> 01:23:53,425
Hey, hey! First they
let me out of jail for free.

791
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:58,555
Then what do I find in the prison
parking lot but a brand new 6000 SUX?

792
01:23:58,681 --> 01:24:00,766
Still got the factory sticker on it.

793
01:24:00,891 --> 01:24:04,978
Hey, Clarence. Joey's got
a car just like yours, man.

794
01:24:05,979 --> 01:24:08,482
Yo, Clarence.
What do you think, buddy?

795
01:24:14,863 --> 01:24:17,658
What have you got there, Clarence, huh?

796
01:24:17,783 --> 01:24:21,745
Whoa, a new toy! Can I play?

797
01:24:24,581 --> 01:24:27,459
- Watch this.
- Wait a minute. Clarence. Clarence!

798
01:24:30,087 --> 01:24:32,339
Aw, shit!

799
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:36,635
- Fuck!
- Nice car, Joe.

800
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,679
Let me try that.

801
01:24:38,804 --> 01:24:41,974
The Cobra Assault Cannon.
State-of-the-art bang-bang.

802
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,567
I like it!

803
01:24:51,692 --> 01:24:54,445
- Give it up, faggot. Let a man do this.
- Get your own!

804
01:24:54,570 --> 01:24:56,613
Come on!

805
01:25:07,791 --> 01:25:10,252
Do it, Emil!

806
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,719
Heads up, you guys.

807
01:25:27,269 --> 01:25:29,480
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

808
01:25:29,605 --> 01:25:32,399
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're movin' out!

809
01:25:32,524 --> 01:25:36,779
- Come on, Emil. Get your ass in the van.
- Come on, lard-ass. Let's move it.

810
01:25:36,904 --> 01:25:38,947
I'll get you, faggot!

811
01:26:33,168 --> 01:26:35,212
What are you doing?

812
01:26:36,004 --> 01:26:38,465
My targeting system is a little messed up.

813
01:26:41,719 --> 01:26:43,887
Can I help you?

814
01:26:44,013 --> 01:26:46,056
Aim for me.

815
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,694
- Are you locked in now?
- Yes.

816
01:27:00,654 --> 01:27:02,823
A little more to the left.

817
01:27:02,948 --> 01:27:04,283
Here.

818
01:27:12,249 --> 01:27:14,960
- I figure that's dead on.
- Thank you.

819
01:27:34,104 --> 01:27:36,148
Come on, man, let's smoke 'em.

820
01:27:37,733 --> 01:27:41,195
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic motherfucker?

821
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,614
Zip it up, man.

822
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:45,699
Nothin' fancy. Just kill him.

823
01:27:45,824 --> 01:27:47,951
Emil! In the van.

824
01:27:51,038 --> 01:27:54,500
- You should get out of here now.
- Hey, we're partners.

825
01:27:55,626 --> 01:27:57,669
Get the car.

826
01:28:33,247 --> 01:28:35,791
- Damn it. Shit.
- Looking for me?

827
01:28:49,346 --> 01:28:52,725
Cut him off!
Go on, cut him off!

828
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:55,227
Go! Go!

829
01:29:26,133 --> 01:29:28,427
OK! Now I gotcha!

830
01:30:15,391 --> 01:30:17,434
Shit.

831
01:30:30,864 --> 01:30:34,201
- Help me.
- Don't touch me, man!

832
01:30:36,245 --> 01:30:37,871
Help me.

833
01:30:56,557 --> 01:30:57,975
Shit.

834
01:31:25,669 --> 01:31:28,547
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Clarence!

835
01:31:54,656 --> 01:31:57,618
OK. I give up.

836
01:31:57,910 --> 01:32:02,247
- I'm not arresting you any more.
- Hey, hey. Now wait a second.

837
01:32:09,213 --> 01:32:13,258
Wait a minute. You're taking this
kinda personal, aren't you?

838
01:32:13,384 --> 01:32:16,970
Come on, man.
You're making me nervous.

839
01:32:17,096 --> 01:32:19,264
You can't do this.

840
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:24,019
Don't mess around. Hey.
Come on, man, don't get cute.

841
01:32:29,191 --> 01:32:31,860
- Die, you bastard!
- Yeah!

842
01:32:31,985 --> 01:32:34,113
Yeah, all right!

843
01:32:35,781 --> 01:32:38,033
I got him, Clarence!

844
01:33:05,602 --> 01:33:08,063
Sayonara, RoboCop.

845
01:33:22,411 --> 01:33:24,455
Lewis!

846
01:33:25,330 --> 01:33:27,374
Lewis!

847
01:33:29,835 --> 01:33:32,671
Murphy, I'm a mess.

848
01:33:35,299 --> 01:33:37,634
They'll fix you.

849
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,887
They fix everything.

850
01:33:49,521 --> 01:33:51,482
The police strike could work for us.

851
01:33:51,607 --> 01:33:54,485
By the end of the week we can have
ED-209s in place in the city

852
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:56,904
and expect immediate public support.

853
01:33:57,029 --> 01:34:00,491
I've got one downstairs,
guarding the building now.

854
01:34:07,331 --> 01:34:10,376
You are illegally parked
on private property.

855
01:34:10,501 --> 01:34:13,796
You have 20 seconds
to move your vehicle.

856
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:53,877
Because this corporation will live up
to the guiding principles of its founder.

857
01:34:54,002 --> 01:34:57,589
Courage. Strength. Conviction.

858
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:05,347
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

859
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:19,278
- How can we help you, Officer?
- Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

860
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:24,116
This is absurd. That thing
is a violent mechanical psychopath.

861
01:35:24,241 --> 01:35:28,871
My program will not allow me to act
against an officer of this company.

862
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:32,166
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

863
01:35:42,634 --> 01:35:46,138
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

864
01:35:46,722 --> 01:35:49,683
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

865
01:35:50,684 --> 01:35:53,645
I had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

866
01:35:54,730 --> 01:35:57,191
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

867
01:35:59,777 --> 01:36:02,821
Get up! I want a chopper. Now!

868
01:36:04,198 --> 01:36:06,492
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

869
01:36:07,034 --> 01:36:10,537
I will board the chopper with my hostage.

870
01:36:12,039 --> 01:36:14,083
Anybody tries to stop me,

871
01:36:15,334 --> 01:36:16,960
the old geezer gets it.

872
01:36:20,089 --> 01:36:22,132
Dick, you're fired!

873
01:36:24,009 --> 01:36:25,511
Thank you.

874
01:36:50,411 --> 01:36:52,955
Nice shootin', son. What's your name?

875
01:36:55,749 --> 01:36:57,793
Murphy.
