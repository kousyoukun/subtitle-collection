1
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,640
This is Media Break.

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,190
You give us three minutes and we'll give you the world.

3
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,230
Good morning. I'm Casey Wong with Jesse Perkins.

4
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,110
Top story, Pretoria.

5
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,240
The threat of nuclear confrontation in South Africa escalated today

6
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,110
when the ruling white military government

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,240
of that besieged city-state unveiled a French-made neutron bomb

8
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,580
and affirmed its willingness to use the three megaton device

9
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,170
as the city's last line of defense.

10
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,500
And the President's first press conference from the Star Wars orbiting peace platform

11
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,260
got off to a shaky start,

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,390
when power failed causing a brief, but harmless, period of weightlessness

13
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,050
for the visiting President and his staff.

14
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,180
We'll be back in a moment.

15
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,020
Is it time for that big operation?

16
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,480
This may be the most important decision of your life.

17
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,480
So come down and talk to one of our qualified surgeons

18
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,610
here at the Family Heart Center.

19
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,370
We feature the complete Jarvik line, series 7 Sports Heart by Jensen, Yamaha.

20
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,120
You pick the heart.

21
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,450
Extended warranties, financing.

22
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,370
Qualifies for health tax credit.

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,790
And remember, we care.

24
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,510
Three dead police officers, one critically injured.

25
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,470
Police union leaders blame Omni Consumer Products, OCP,

26
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,720
the firm which recently entered into a contract with the city

27
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,230
to fund and run the Detroit Metropolitan Police Department.

28
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,730
Dick Jones, Division President, OCP.

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,770
Every policeman knows when he joins the force

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,020
that there are certain inherent risks that come with the territory.

31
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,570
Ask any cop, he'll tell you,

32
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,070
"if you can't stand the heat, you better stay out of the kitchen."

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,990
Although seriously wounded, Officer Frank Frederickson escaped

34
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,030
and identified this man.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,870
Clarence Boddicker, unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit.

36
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,420
Now sought in connection with the deaths of 31 police officers.

37
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,790
Today, he's at large,

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,460
while doctors at Henry Ford Memorial Hospital

39
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,670
fight to save the life of Officer Frank Frederickson.

40
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,920
Good luck, Frank.

41
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,850
Attempted murder? It's not like he killed someone.

42
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,270
This is a clear violation of my client's civil rights.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,190
Make it aggravated assault, and I can make bail, in cash, now.

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,030
Listen, pal, your client's a scumbag, you're a scumbag,

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,240
and scumbags see the judge on Monday morning!

46
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,290
Now get out of my police station, and take laughing boy with you!

47
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,660
Get over there!

48
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,130
You have the right to remain silent. Do you understand me?

49
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,290
Sure, sure.

50
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,090
- Priors?  - No.

51
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,250
Hi.

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,220
Uh, Murphy. Transferring in from Metro South.

53
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,800
Nice precinct.

54
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,890
Yeah, pretty good.

55
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,430
We work for a living down here, Murphy. Get your armor and suit up.

56
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,070
Please take me home!

57
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,900
Not now, E.J. Get a cup of coffee.

58
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,070
Oh, Sarge.

59
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,110
Stark, is there any word on Frederickson?

60
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,910
They're still listing him as critical.

61
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,320
His wife must be going out of her mind.

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,990
- Murphy, huh?  - Yeah, that's me.

63
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,240
- Manson.  - Hi.

64
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,080
What brings you to this little paradise?

65
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,830
Beats me, man. I think OCP's moving a lot of new guys up here.

66
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,840
Omni Consumer Products. What a bunch of morons.

67
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,630
They're gonna manage this department right into the ground!

68
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,760
- Where are you from?  - Metro South.

69
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,930
Welcome to hell.

70
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,350
- Murphy.  - Yo.

71
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,350
You cut 10 guys loose over on the east side.

72
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,980
You try to get backup when you're in a jam.

73
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,770
Yeah, try to get a medevac after you've been jammed.

74
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,770
I'll tell you what we should do. We should strike. Fuck 'em!

75
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,370
Oh, boy.

76
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,080
The funeral's tomorrow.

77
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,840
The department requests all officers not on duty to attend.

78
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,300
Any donations for the family may be given to Cecil as usual.

79
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,260
And I don't want to hear any more talk about strike!

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,020
We're not plumbers. We're police officers.

81
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,060
And police officers don't strike.

82
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,110
Murphy, front and center.

83
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,880
Hello, tiger.

84
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,480
Oh, yes!

85
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,110
Lewis, come here when you're finished fucking around with your suspect.

86
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,570
Get on your feet!

87
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,820
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

88
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,410
Murphy, meet Lewis. Show him the neighborhood.

89
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,450
Glad to know you, Murphy.

90
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,210
Pretty neat.

91
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,790
I better drive until you know your way around.

92
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,260
I usually drive when I'm breaking in a new partner.

93
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,740
You really think the old man is gonna be there?

94
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,410
Why would they invite us?

95
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:53,290
All division heads are bringing their support teams.

96
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,700
It's big.

97
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,750
I figure they're green-lighting Delta City.

98
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,830
What, are you kidding? They never do anything ahead of schedule.

99
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,460
It's Jones. He's got the 209 series online and now he wants to show off.

100
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,380
That's a tough break, Bob.

101
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,090
What? What?

102
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,680
Well, ED 209 ran into serious delays and cost overruns.

103
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,850
The old man ordered a backup plan.

104
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,810
95th floor. Have a nice day.

105
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,270
Probably just to light a fire under Jones' ass.

106
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,810
- Yeah?  - Old Bob here gets the assignment.

107
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,020
Yeah.

108
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,230
Nobody in Security Concepts takes it seriously.

109
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,610
It's a better plan. Fucking Jones! I'd go straight to the Old Man if I could.

110
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,950
Don't mess with Jones, man. He'll make sushi out of you.

111
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,070
Yeah, you better be careful, man. I heard Jones is a real shark.

112
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,870
- Who asked you, twerp?  - Bob.

113
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,000
What about this police thing, what's the problem?

114
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,120
Their union's been bitching ever since we took over.

115
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,250
You know, the usual nonsense.

116
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,460
We'll turn things around.

117
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,840
Mmm-hmm. Good, very good. Let's get started.

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
Now, friends,

119
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,730
I've had this dream for more than a decade now.

120
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,400
A dream which I've invited you all to share with me.

121
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,780
In six months, we begin construction of Delta City.

122
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,740
Where Old Detroit now stands.

123
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,410
Old Detroit has a cancer.

124
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,080
The cancer is crime.

125
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,170
And it must be cut out before we employ the 2 million workers

126
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,340
that will breathe life into this city again.

127
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,510
Yes.

128
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,970
Although shifts in the tax structure

129
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,310
have created an economy ideal for corporate growth,

130
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:42,600
community services, in this case law enforcement,

131
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,730
have suffered.

132
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,690
I think it's time we gave something back.

133
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,740
Dick.

134
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,040
Take a close look at the track record of this company.

135
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,130
And you'll see that we have gambled in markets

136
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,760
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

137
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,510
Hospitals, prisons, space exploration.

138
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,310
I say good business is where you find it.

139
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,270
As you know, we've entered into a contract with the city

140
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,570
to run local law enforcement.

141
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,900
But at Security Concepts,

142
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,030
we believe an efficient police force is only part of the solution.

143
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,990
No. We need something more.

144
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,370
We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.

145
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:45,620
A cop that doesn't need to eat or sleep.

146
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,170
A cop with superior firepower and the reflexes to use it.

147
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,090
Fellow executives,

148
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,850
it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to the future of law enforcement.

149
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,770
Ed 209.

150
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,680
The Enforcement Droid series 209 is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot.

151
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,980
209 is currently programmed for urban pacification,

152
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,810
but that is only the beginning.

153
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,980
After a successful tour of duty in Old Detroit,

154
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,860
we can expect 209 to become the hot military product for the next decade.

155
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,160
- Dr. McNamara.  - We'll need an arrest subject.

156
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,490
- Mr. Kinney.  - Yes, sir?

157
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,790
Would you come up and give us a hand, please?

158
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,160
Yes, sir.

159
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,080
Mr. Kinney is going to help us simulate a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

160
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,420
Mr. Kinney, use your gun in a threatening manner.

161
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,760
- Point it at Ed 209.  - Yes, sir.

162
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,110
Please put down your weapon. You have 20 seconds to comply.

163
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,780
I think you'd better do what he says, Mr. Kinney.

164
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,950
You now have 15 seconds to comply.

165
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,710
- You are in direct violation of Penal Code 113, Section 9.  - Cut the power! Pull the board!

166
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,170
You now have five seconds to comply.

167
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,380
Help! Help me!

168
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,050
Four, three, two, one.

169
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,550
I am now authorized to use physical force.

170
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,490
WOIt's horrible.

171
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,660
Somebody want to call a goddamn paramedic?

172
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,000
- Let's go, Johnson!  - You pull the plug on this thing!

173
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:36,340
All right, don't touch him.

174
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:38,250
Don't touch him!

175
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,510
He didn't hear the gun drop.

176
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,920
He didn't hear it?

177
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,260
Oh, God.

178
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,970
Dick, I'm very disappointed.

179
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,520
I'm sure it's only a glitch, a temporary setback.

180
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,520
You call this a glitch?

181
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,610
We're scheduled to begin construction in six months.

182
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,610
Your temporary setback could cost us $50 million in interest payments alone.

183
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:02,400
Not necessarily, sir.

184
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,280
Perhaps you're aware of the Robocop program

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,280
developed by myself at Security Concepts as a contingency against just this sort of thing.

186
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,910
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Morton.

187
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm sure this is something we can take up in my office...

188
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Now, wait a minute. Dick!

189
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,920
Get me out of here!

190
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,090
Maybe what we need here is a fresh perspective.

191
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,300
Tell me about your plan, Mr. Morton. How long will it take?

192
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,380
We're ready to go, sir.

193
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,300
We've restructured the police department and placed prime candidates according to risk factor.

194
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,810
I'm confident that we can go to prototype within 90 days.

195
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:32,520
Good, very good. Get your staff together, Mr. Morton.

196
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,230
I'll expect a full presentation in 20 minutes.

197
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,400
Thank you, sir.

198
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,910
Yes! Now, that's how it's done in the big leagues, Johnson.

199
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,450
You see an opening, you go for it.

200
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,750
You better watch your back, Bob. Jones is going to come looking for you.

201
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,750
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball and I was there to pick it up.

202
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,250
Too bad about Kinney.

203
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,630
That's life in the big city.

204
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,260
When do we start?

205
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,050
As soon as some poor schmuck volunteers.

206
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,020
Unit 3509, proceed to Hall and Grand. 411 involving indigents.

207
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,430
Roger, we're on our way.

208
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,280
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

209
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,780
Yeah, my son, Jimmy, watches this cop show, TJ Lazer,

210
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,830
and this Lazer guy does this every time he takes down a bad guy.

211
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,290
So naturally, my kid thinks every good cop should be...

212
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,290
And you don't want to disappoint him.

213
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,000
Yeah, well, role models can be very important to a boy.

214
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,890
Okay, okay, I get a kick out of it.

215
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,060
All units, all units, sector 9.

216
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,970
- That's for...  - 211 in progress.

217
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,140
Why don't you drive?

218
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:01,060
...the suspects are armed and considered dangerous.

219
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,860
Shit.

220
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,780
I don't believe it!

221
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,950
What?

222
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,240
You burned the fucking money!

223
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,370
I had to blow the door. What do you want?

224
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,450
It's as good as marked, you asshole!

225
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,910
You stupid, stupid asshole!

226
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,580
- Clarence!  - What? What do you want?

227
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,340
We got a cop on our tail.

228
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,430
Come on, man, speed it up! Move it!

229
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,680
This crate ain't gonna outrun a cop.

230
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,350
- Slow down, then.  - What, are you crazy, man?

231
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,350
Shut the fuck up and do it! Just do it!

232
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,310
Central, this is 154. We're in pursuit of 211 suspect.

233
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,560
Request backup.

234
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,530
Roger, 154.

235
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,190
- Backup currently unavailable.  - Give me your piece.

236
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,780
Backup E.T.A., 15 minutes.

237
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,450
Bobby, get the door!

238
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,780
Everybody load up!

239
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,620
All right, let's go. Come on!

240
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,250
- Okay.  - All right, here we go.

241
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,590
Now.

242
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,970
What the fuck? Where did he go?

243
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,180
Emil?

244
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,640
Here! He's up here!

245
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,140
He's on the side.

246
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,730
He's over here!

247
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,110
Get him!

248
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,040
Shit, Clarence, my leg!

249
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,370
Leon, pick him up.

250
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,500
- Ready?  - No, hang on.

251
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,630
Bobby.

252
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,500
- Can you fly, Bobby?  - Clarence, no!

253
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,090
Hit it!

254
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,720
No!

255
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,820
Central, this is unit 154.

256
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,490
We located that van by the old mill in Sector 3D.

257
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,910
- Now, where is that backup?  - Backup is still unavailable.

258
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,410
Oh, man!

259
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,250
We estimate 10 minutes before units can arrive.

260
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,750
Well, you call it.

261
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,260
- Let's do it.  - Okay.

262
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
Go.

263
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,600
Stay in touch.

264
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,560
Freeze.

265
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,940
Okay, let's see those hands.

266
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,150
Nice and easy.

267
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,110
Sure.

268
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,280
Mind if I zip this up?

269
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,430
We keep robbing banks, but we never get to keep the money.

270
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,930
Takes money to make money.

271
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,180
We steal money to buy coke,

272
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,470
then sell the coke to make even more money.

273
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,600
Capital investment, man.

274
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,350
Yeah, why bother making it when we can just steal it?

275
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,110
Ain't no better way to steal money than free enterprise.

276
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,610
- Smoke?  - No.

277
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:16,190
You know, those things will kill you.  - Yeah.

278
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,900
You want to live forever?

279
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,870
BiXby!

280
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,870
What a cake! Oh, boy!

281
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,210
Hey.

282
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,050
Don't move.

283
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,130
Go ahead and do it.

284
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,550
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

285
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,730
Lewis. Lewis!

286
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,780
Lewis, I got a situation here, girl.

287
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,240
Okay, tough guy, get up! Get up!

288
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,700
Turn around. Spread your legs. That's right.

289
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:05,240
Lewis, where are you? You all right?

290
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,660
Put your hands on your head. Lewis?

291
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,590
Why don't you let us take over from here, Emil?

292
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,860
- Your ass is mine.  - No.

293
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,360
Not yet it ain't.

294
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,290
Well, what have we here?

295
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,340
You a good cop, hotshot?

296
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,140
Sure you are.

297
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,180
Why, you got to be some kind of great cop to come in here all by yourself.

298
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:16,810
Where's your partner?

299
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,320
Where's your partner?

300
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,030
Well, guys, the other one was upstairs.

301
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,160
She was sweet, mmm, mmm, mmm.

302
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,700
I took her out.

303
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,460
I bet that really pisses you off.

304
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,090
You probably don't think I'm a very nice guy.

305
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,760
Do you?

306
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,840
Buddy, I think you're slime.

307
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,520
You see, I got this problem.

308
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,900
Cops don't like me, so I don't like cops.

309
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,370
Well, give the man a hand.

310
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,090
He's all yours.

311
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,350
- All right, look out.  - Turn around, man.

312
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,730
Pretty boy, over here.

313
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,170
Shit! I'm out of ammo.

314
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,460
Me, too.

315
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,010
Hey Clarence, he's still alive.

316
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,930
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

317
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,110
Okay, fun's over.

318
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,450
Okay, let's get out of here.

319
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,080
Good night, sweet prince.

320
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,580
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

321
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,400
Murphy-

322
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,300
Get him over. Lift!

323
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,920
Get the ventilator.

324
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,680
Put him in OR 4.

325
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,810
Easy, easy. Turn.

326
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,610
Slow it down now. Slow it down, slow it down.

327
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,320
Okay, hit the door.

328
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,200
Let me get pressure.

329
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,530
Mask him.

330
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,410
Got a pressure of 60 palp.

331
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,950
All right, we have to intubate this guy.

332
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,460
Apply cricoid pressure.

333
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,710
Okay. All right, I got it in. Breath sounds.

334
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,000
- You're in.  - Other side.

335
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,630
Okay, let's go ahead and get the MAST trousers up.

336
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,930
Let's get the clothes off.

337
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,010
Okay, clothes off. Let's prep him for a central line.

338
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,180
Let's get some blood drawn. Type and crossing, six units.

339
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,810
His pressure's dropping.

340
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,980
Okay, I've got a central line in.

341
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,770
I'm getting pressure back. Normal saline.

342
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,030
Can you do that, Dad?

343
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,610
I really have to tell you something.

344
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,950
- What's our blood pressure?  - I've got 40 palp.

345
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,370
All right.

346
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,460
Coarse V-Fib. Okay, we got to shock him.

347
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,210
Let's get the Ambu bag.

348
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,960
Clear the patches.

349
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,800
Put the Foley in.

350
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,010
Let's go ahead and blow his MAST trousers.

351
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,260
Stand clear.

352
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,260
Stand clear. Shock him.

353
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,680
All right.

354
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,640
Coarse V-Fib. Let's shock him again.

355
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,230
Clear.

356
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,110
All right.

357
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,980
Flatline. Let's go intracardiac epinephrine.

358
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,360
Let's go.

359
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,740
Okay.

360
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
All right, it's in.

361
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,530
There's no pulse.

362
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,580
All right, let's go ahead and shock a flat line, and let's quit.

363
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,790
Okay, everybody, clear!

364
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,910
Stand clear.

365
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,840
All right, I think that's all we can do.

366
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,130
Let's call it. What's the time?

367
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,800
6:15.

368
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,280
No, it's starting to roll.

369
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,120
Still rolling.

370
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,950
- Shit!  - Nope.

371
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,330
Let me see.

372
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,080
Bring in the L.E.D.

373
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,130
Let's lock it down.

374
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,800
- He's on.  - What's the story?

375
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,550
We were able to save the left arm.

376
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,520
What? I thought we agreed on total body prosthesis.

377
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,310
- Now, lose the arm, okay?  - Jesus, Morton.

378
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,560
Can he understand what I'm saying?

379
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,940
It doesn't matter. We're gonna blank his memory, anyway.

380
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,610
Well, I think we should lose the arm. What do you think, Johnson?

381
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,900
Well, he signed the release forms when he joined the force.

382
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:41,370
He's legally dead. We can do pretty much what we want to.

383
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,490
Lose the arm.

384
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,660
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

385
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:54,670
The entire outer skin will be like this.

386
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,880
It's titanium laminated with Kevlar.

387
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,010
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

388
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,010
Come here often? How you doing?

389
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,970
Oh, God!

390
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,980
He's got a hell of a grip.

391
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:13,110
It's 400 foot-pounds. He could crush every bone in your hand.

392
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,570
All right. Attach it to his shoulder.

393
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,190
I like that.

394
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,700
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

395
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,340
WOHey, look, look! He's watching us!

396
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,750
How you doing?

397
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,300
- Hi!  - Hi!

398
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,970
WOHappy new year!

399
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,300
This is for you.

400
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,970
Happy new year.

401
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,810
We get the best of both worlds.

402
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,400
The fastest reflexes modern technology has to offer,

403
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,240
on board computer-assisted memory,

404
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,490
and a lifetime of on-the-street law enforcement programming.

405
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,700
It is my great pleasure to present to you,

406
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,660
Robocop.

407
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,460
Come on, come on, come on.

408
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,590
Come on. That's for you. That's for you.

409
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:18,920
Go, Robe.

410
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,190
I am what you call a repeat offender.

411
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,610
I repeat, I will offend again.

412
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:44,950
I get my orders from a higher source.

413
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,280
Shut up, asshole.

414
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,030
Does your mother know you talk like that?

415
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,870
Bring him in through the side door.

416
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,750
This holding cell has been set up for observation.

417
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:55,830
Looks perfect.

418
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,580
- What is this all about?  - Who is this guy?

419
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,500
- Sergeant John Reed.  - What's this all about?

420
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,130
It's about official OCP business. So please, get lost.

421
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,840
I think we've got four or five days setup...

422
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,300
Hey, this is bullshit! I take my orders from...

423
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,410
What is this shit?

424
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,820
Yeah, good question.

425
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,580
- Hey, wait for me, partner.  - Let's go.

426
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,500
There they are.

427
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Go.

428
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,800
When you are at rest, you will sit in the chair.

429
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,600
Yes. I understand.

430
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:54,350
What about tracking?

431
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:57,020
We can check his exact location at all times with one of these.

432
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,190
How does he eat?

433
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:02,400
His digestive system is extremely simple.

434
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,530
This processor dispenses a rudimentary paste

435
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,900
that sustains his organic system.

436
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,790
Tastes like baby food.

437
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,040
Knock yourself out.

438
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,640
Okay, let's start with tracking.

439
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,810
- Give me a grid.  - Got it.

440
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,930
There.

441
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,060
- Target?  - Check.

442
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,480
- Target.  - Check.

443
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,900
Now follow.

444
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,230
Check.

445
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,820
Voice stress analyzer, one, two...

446
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,280
...three.

447
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
- Check.  - Record.

448
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,280
- Now playback.  - Bring it up 50%.

449
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,000
- Now playback.  - Bring it up 50%.

450
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,250
Give me a full frame.

451
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,080
- We got it.  - All right, clear out.

452
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,540
What are your prime directives?

453
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:08,260
Serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law.

454
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,260
That's good.

455
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,010
That's very good.

456
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,400
I fucking love that guy!

457
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,730
Hey, Lewis, it's Supercop.

458
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,770
Look at that fucking gun.

459
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,790
Shit!

460
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,590
- This guy's really good.  - He's not a guy. He's a machine.

461
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:29,590
What are they gonna do, replace us?

462
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,470
Come on.

463
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,150
- Reed.  - Yeah?

464
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,610
He needs a car.

465
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,730
Thank you.

466
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,860
Sure. Anytime.

467
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,740
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy!

468
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,030
I'd buy that for a dollar!

469
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,540
Will there be anything else, sir?

470
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,250
Yeah, empty the register and put the money in the bag.

471
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,670
Excuse me?

472
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,590
I said give me your money and all of it, and don't fuck with me!

473
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,930
Now move!

474
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,390
Open the safe, Pops.

475
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,260
Open the goddamn safe!

476
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,890
We don't have a safe.

477
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,810
Shit! There's your goddamn safe! Open that son of a bitch!

478
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,190
Quit stalling, man! I'm gonna count to three! You better open that son of a bitch.

479
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:12,730
Come on! Come on!

480
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,860
I'm gonna blow her brains out.

481
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,990
- I'll open the safe.  - Good boy.

482
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,320
Come on.

483
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,370
Well, you better open that on the count of three.

484
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,580
One, two...

485
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,670
Fuck me.

486
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,710
Drop the gun. You are under arrest.

487
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,380
Fuck me! Fuck me!

488
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,590
Fuck me! Fuck me!

489
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,930
Fuck me! Fuck me!

490
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,850
Fuck me!

491
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,780
Thank you for your cooperation. Good night.

492
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,160
I'll buy that for a dollar!

493
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,380
Don't touch me! Get away! Get away!

494
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,050
We don't want your bag!

495
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,600
We want you!

496
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,810
Take it easy! We don't want to hurt you!

497
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,940
That's too much hair.

498
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,350
I know, we'll give her a haircut!

499
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,440
- Hey, hey.  - What?

500
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,610
There's more hair down there!

501
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,120
No, don't!

502
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,210
Please!

503
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,210
No!

504
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,750
Help me!

505
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,380
Help me!

506
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,510
Let the woman go. You are under arrest.

507
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,720
Shit!

508
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,380
You better back up, pal!

509
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,390
'Cause, he's gonna kill her!

510
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,260
He's gonna kill her!

511
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,220
You fucking bitch!

512
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,140
He's gonna kill her, man!

513
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,100
He's gonna kill her!

514
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,110
Your move, creep.

515
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,360
Okay!

516
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:26,280
It's okay!

517
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,870
I was so scared. Thank you.

518
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,580
Thank you.

519
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,210
Madam, you have suffered an emotional shock.

520
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,840
I will notify a rape crisis center.

521
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,820
All units, Sector 6, please close intersections...

522
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,370
I don't care. Get those men by the stairs now!

523
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,700
Hit it!

524
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:14,540
Terrorism has never been a factor in city politics before.

525
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,500
But that changed today when former city councilman Ron Miller

526
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,250
entered City Hall with a gun.

527
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,710
He's now on the second floor

528
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,380
holding Mayor Gibson and his staff hostage.

529
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,300
We do believe that Miller has killed one of the hostages.

530
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,430
Lieutenant, what's next?

531
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,680
We wait. Terrorism is a very tricky business.

532
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,890
Maximum and immediate retaliation is the best policy.

533
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
But unfortunately...

534
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,190
Excuse us.

535
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,060
Where are you going?

536
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,820
Statement, please.

537
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,780
Let's have some crowd control! Come on, get these people back!

538
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,700
Where the hell do you think you're going?

539
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,540
Keep him talking.

540
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,500
Who made you?

541
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,960
Are you invincible?

542
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,930
Okay, Miller, don't hurt the Mayor. We'll give you whatever you want.

543
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,720
First, don't fuck with me! I'm a desperate man!

544
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,600
And second, I want some fresh coffee!

545
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,560
And third, I want a recount!

546
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,980
And no matter how it turns out, I want my old job back!

547
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,280
Okay-

548
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,450
And I want a bigger office!

549
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,700
And I want a new car!

550
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,620
And I want the City to pay for it all!

551
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,910
What kind of car, Miller?

552
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,950
Something with reclining leather seats,

553
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,960
that goes really fast and gets really shitty gas mileage!

554
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,040
How about the 6000 SUX?

555
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:45,380
Yeah! Okay, sure!

556
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,260
What about cruise control? Does it come with cruise control?

557
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:55,270
Hey, no problem, Miller. Let the Mayor go, we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.

558
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,310
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

559
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,310
When people jerk me off, I kill them!

560
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,020
You want to see?

561
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,990
Get up, Your Honor, get up. Get up!

562
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,660
Your public wants to see you!

563
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,660
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

564
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,290
We'll get serious now!

565
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:21,460
And kiss the Mayor's ass good-bye!

566
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:35,050
Robocop. Who is he?

567
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,600
What is he? Where does he come from?

568
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,020
He's OCP's newest soldier

569
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,560
in their revolutionary crime management program.

570
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,190
OCP Spokesmen claim that the fearless machine

571
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,360
has crooks on the run in Old Detroit.

572
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,280
Today, kids at Lee lacocca Elementary School got to meet in person

573
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,240
what their parents only read about in comic books.

574
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,700
Robe, excuse me, Robe. Any special message

575
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,790
for all the kids watching at home?

576
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,120
Stay out of trouble.

577
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,540
More fighting in the Mexican crisis today

578
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,300
when American troops participated in a joint raid with Mexican nationals

579
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,010
against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.

580
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,630
Now this.

581
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,260
Red alert. Red alert. Red alert.

582
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,970
You crossed my line of death.

583
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,390
You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.

584
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,520
Pakistan is threatening my border.

585
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,320
That's it, buster. No more military aid.

586
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,950
Nukem, get them before they get you.

587
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,570
Another quality home game from butler brothers.

588
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,910
Today, labor leaders agreed to sanction construction

589
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,540
of OCP's Delta City,

590
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,830
thereby creating an estimated one million much-needed new jobs,

591
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,670
despite questions about worker safety in dangerous Old Detroit.

592
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,380
Robert Morton, vice president, Security Concepts, OCP.

593
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,550
I'm afraid I can't comment on Delta City.

594
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,180
That's not my division. But I will tell you this.

595
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:59,350
At Security Concepts, we're projecting the end of crime

596
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,770
in Old Detroit within 40 days.

597
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,890
There's a new guy in town. His name's Robocop.

598
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,690
Hey, hey, hey. Bobby boy. Vice president. Congratulations.

599
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,990
Handball Tuesday night?

600
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,490
Bill, I'd love to. But I got a date.

601
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,780
Couple models coming over to my place. Know what I mean?

602
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,740
I'd buy that for a dollar.

603
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,000
Welcome to the club, Bob.

604
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,210
...and that's a true story.

605
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,840
Making a real name for yourself in Security Concepts with Robocop.

606
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,380
I try.

607
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,470
I'm in on the bottom line, pal.

608
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,100
I hear Jones was plenty pissed.

609
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,680
Oh, you know, he's got this killer rep, but it's a smokescreen.

610
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,810
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth. The guy's a pussy.

611
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,650
Are we talking about the same Dick Jones?

612
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,860
Hey, he's old, we're young, and that's life.

613
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,790
lgot to...

614
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,750
I got to go. I got a meeting.

615
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,680
Congratulations, Bob.

616
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,850
Thanks.

617
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,060
I remember when I was a young executive for this company.

618
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:27,940
I used to call the old man funny names.

619
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:29,560
Iron Butt,

620
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,690
Boner.

621
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,610
Once, I even called him asshole.

622
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,450
But there was always respect.

623
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,080
I always knew where the line was drawn.

624
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:52,840
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

625
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:58,010
You've insulted me, and you've insulted this company

626
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,590
with that bastard creation of yours!

627
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,050
I had a guaranteed military sale with Ed 209!

628
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,020
Renovation program. Spare parts for 25 years.

629
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,730
Who cares if it worked or not?

630
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,610
The old man thought it was pretty important,

631
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,820
Dick.

632
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,450
You know, he's a sweet old man.

633
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:31,330
And he means well.

634
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,590
But he's not going to live forever.

635
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,670
And I'm number two around here.

636
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,340
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

637
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,850
You just

638
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,520
fucked with the wrong guy.

639
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,900
You're out of your fucking mind.

640
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,820
You better pray

641
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,950
that that unholy monster of yours doesn't screw up.

642
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,970
- You hungry?  - No, thanks.

643
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,510
No.

644
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:18,860
Goddamn rebels blew up the airport in Acapulco yesterday.

645
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:21,820
Great. We were going there next week. Wait, what was that?

646
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,580
Hey, look! Bucket boy's online.

647
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,510
Halt. Stop! Wait a minute!

648
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,350
What the hell's going on?

649
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,940
- I don't know. He just left.  - Just left?

650
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:58,980
Roosevelt!

651
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:01,820
Rosie, we got a problem.

652
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,450
Out of the way!

653
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,610
Take a look at this.

654
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,490
Shit! Call Bob Morton!

655
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,630
Jerry, book him. I'll catch up with you later.

656
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,520
Hello. I haven't really had a chance to introduce myself.

657
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,600
I'm Lewis.

658
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,940
Do you have a name?

659
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,860
How can I help you, Officer Lewis?

660
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,040
That's not really what I meant. Don't you have a name?

661
00:47:55,410 --> 00:47:56,950
Hold it. Just sign right here, sir.

662
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,660
You don't understand. I'm OCP.

663
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:02,590
Murphy, it's you.

664
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,340
You really don't remember me, do you?

665
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,760
Excuse me.

666
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,640
I have to go.

667
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:16,470
Somewhere there is a crime happening.

668
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,640
Stop!

669
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,810
What did you talk to him about? What did you say?

670
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,310
- Nothing.  - Shit.

671
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,480
Shit.

672
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,490
Stop!

673
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:30,200
You there, stop!

674
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:39,370
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer! Come on!

675
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,830
I was assured full cooperation by this precinct, buddy,

676
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,800
and if it gets screwed up by one of your grunts,

677
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,960
I'm gonna have your job.

678
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,840
- What's the update?  - It's hard to be 100%.

679
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:49,970
We have a glitch or what?

680
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:52,840
This system was never designed to experience detailed somatic response.

681
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,800
He had a dream, a dream.

682
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,140
- This cop saw fit to question him.  - I didn't question him.

683
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:00,390
I asked him his name. He didn't know.

684
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,310
Great. Let me make it real clear for you.

685
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,770
He doesn't have a name. He's got a program.

686
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:08,070
He's product. Is that clear?

687
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:09,490
Sure.

688
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,400
I say we pull him in, run a systems check, the works.

689
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,700
Take a week. Maybe 10 days.

690
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,870
You want to take him offline because he had a dream?

691
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:16,200
What, are you kidding?

692
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,240
Let's get out of here.

693
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,750
- Listen, Reed.  - Yeah?

694
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:23,790
Try to keep one thing in mind. This project doesn't concern cops.

695
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,420
It's classified. It's OCP.

696
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,460
You got it, mister?

697
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:32,720
Yeah, I got it.

698
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:34,220
Good.

699
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,430
Right, we keep him on the street...

700
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:37,970
Sorry, Sarge.

701
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,100
I fucked up.

702
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:44,600
Forget it, kid. This guy's a serious asshole.

703
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,510
Give me all your money, bookworm, or I blow your brains out.

704
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,610
Now fill it up on number 7.

705
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,990
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

706
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,490
I'm a good shot.

707
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:44,910
I could hit you in the eye from here.

708
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,220
Hey, man, what you reading in there?

709
00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:08,230
You a college boy or something?

710
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,780
I bet you think you're pretty smart?

711
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,490
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

712
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,780
What do you say we find out?

713
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,370
I'm talking to you! What do you say?

714
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,740
I'm talking to you!

715
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,080
Drop it.

716
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,800
Dead or alive, you are coming with me.

717
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,300
I know you.

718
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:41,930
You're dead.

719
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:44,720
We killed you!

720
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,390
We killed you!

721
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,520
We killed you!

722
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,120
You're dead.

723
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,200
We killed you!

724
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,250
Who are you?

725
00:52:56,050 --> 00:52:58,380
Who are you?

726
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:12,770
Jerry, Jerry. Look who it is.

727
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,560
Can I help you, sir?

728
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,400
- No.  - What is it exactly that you want?

729
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,360
You can't enter here! Wait a second!

730
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,030
Just a minute!

731
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,450
This is a restricted area!

732
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,920
He's in.

733
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,690
Murphy, it's you.

734
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,860
Murphy, it's you.

735
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,360
Murphy, it's you.

736
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,940
Murphy, it's you.

737
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,000
Welcome, shopper.

738
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,670
Let's take a stroll through your new home.

739
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,970
This is a one-family house built by ZEM Industries.

740
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:49,260
Situated near schools and shopping centers,

741
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:52,760
this progressive development has a growth factor of 7.

742
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,870
Wow.

743
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,790
Can you do that, Dad?

744
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:30,930
...and, say, it doesn't matter who cooks in your family,

745
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:35,640
because this kitchen by Food Concepts makes everything a snap.

746
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,620
Dad.

747
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:01,500
Come on, get your hat on. Isn't he cute?

748
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,420
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

749
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,790
Get in the picture.

750
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,170
Come on, come on.

751
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,860
I really have to tell you something.

752
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,070
I love you.

753
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:38,120
That's the master bedroom.

754
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,410
A functional space with a touch of elegance.

755
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:44,790
Have you thought it all over?

756
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,090
Why not make me an offer?

757
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,250
Where is Clarence Boddicker?

758
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,670
Okay?

759
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,510
- Shit!  - Let's talk.

760
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,020
Son of a bitch!

761
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,980
There's just something about the way it sounds.

762
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,900
Vice president.

763
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,740
It just turns me on.

764
00:58:58,370 --> 00:58:59,870
God, you girls are so great.

765
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:02,660
I mean I just... I love to be with intelligent women.

766
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,290
Smart is so sexy.

767
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,170
I know.

768
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:09,790
Sometimes I could just think of something,

769
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,010
and it could just get me so horny.

770
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:19,180
Yeah, well, a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

771
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,640
Yeah.

772
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,510
I get bored so easily.

773
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:25,100
Yep.

774
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,310
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

775
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,280
- Yes, I do. Don't move.  - I won't.

776
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,900
Bob?

777
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:39,870
What?

778
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,450
- Bob, save some for me.  - Don't worry. I'll...

779
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,790
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

780
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,420
How you doing...

781
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,340
Bitches, leave.

782
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,060
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

783
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,560
- You gonna call me?  - Come on.

784
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,860
What the fuck are you doing?

785
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,650
Do you know who I am?

786
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,490
If you think you're gonna get away with this...

787
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:20,950
Goddamn it!

788
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:29,460
Stop! I'll give you anything you want! Just please, please don't kill me, all right?

789
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,920
Hello, buddy boy. Dick Jones here.

790
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:42,140
I guess you're on your knees about now, begging for your life.

791
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,970
Pathetic.

792
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,390
You don't feel so cocky now, do you, Bob?

793
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,480
Whatever he's paying you, I'll double it right now.

794
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,230
You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?

795
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:57,070
We could have been friends.

796
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:00,150
But you wouldn't go through proper channels.

797
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,110
You went over my head.

798
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:05,160
That hurt.

799
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:10,500
But life goes on. It's an old story, the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?

800
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,170
It helps if you think of it as a game, Bob.

801
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,840
Every game has a winner and a loser.

802
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:31,810
I'm cashing you out, Bob.

803
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:48,870
We need more tubing.

804
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,710
I don't think I want to pay you that, Sal.

805
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,630
I don't give a shit what you want to pay. I set the prices here.

806
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,760
Listen, pal, maybe you haven't heard. I'm the guy in Old Detroit.

807
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,310
You want space in my marketplace,

808
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:11,180
you're gonna have to give me a volume discount.

809
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:13,810
I'm not into discounts.

810
01:02:13,890 --> 01:02:17,230
Joe, show the man what we brought him for Christmas.

811
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,910
Think about it, chum. Good business is where you find it.

812
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:38,420
Okay, let me try to put this in perspective.

813
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,800
You killed a bunch of cops.

814
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:46,760
The word around is that you've got a lot of heavy connections downtown.

815
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,350
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

816
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:57,770
A lot of people would love to see a guy like me

817
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,650
put a guy like you out of business.

818
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,940
I don't know. I don't know.

819
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:07,070
Maybe I'm just not making myself clear.

820
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:12,450
I don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

821
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:18,040
But I got the connections. I got the sales organization.

822
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,670
I got the muscle to shove enough of this factory

823
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:26,800
so far up your stupid wop ass that you'll shit snow for a year.

824
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,640
Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.

825
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,970
Guns, guns, guns!

826
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,850
Come on, Sal!

827
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,520
The Tigers are playing tonight.

828
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,150
I never miss a game.

829
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,450
Just kidding.

830
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,500
Go!

831
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,340
Go.

832
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,570
Come quietly or there will be trouble.

833
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:34,780
FUCK you!

834
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,470
Clarence Boddicker, you are under arrest.

835
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,300
You have the right to remain silent.

836
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:18,680
FUCK you!

837
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:27,060
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

838
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:29,440
I'm protected, man. I've got protection!

839
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,070
You have the right to an attorney.

840
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:32,900
What is this shit?

841
01:06:37,370 --> 01:06:38,740
Goddamn it.

842
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,830
Goddamn it! Listen to me!

843
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,500
Listen to me, you fuck! There's another guy.

844
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:47,330
He's OCP. He's a senior president.

845
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,960
Anything you say may be used against you.

846
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,880
It's Dick Jones!

847
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,640
Don't you get it? You cocksucker!

848
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,350
I work for Dick Jones. Dick Jones!

849
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:09,110
He's the number two guy at OCP. OCP runs the cops!

850
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,360
You're a cop.

851
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,240
Cop.

852
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,210
Yes. I am a cop.

853
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:36,760
I don't like it any more than you do, Reed, but listen!

854
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,300
You listen to me, you asshole!

855
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:42,390
You're talking about shutting down a major metropolitan police force.

856
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:45,640
Without cops, this city would tear itself apart.

857
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:48,650
The Union thinks you should know there was a strike vote last night.

858
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:50,360
We lost five guys last week.

859
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,440
We're getting creamed out there, Reed.

860
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:03,120
Book him.

861
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:04,910
What's the charge?

862
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,540
He's a cop killer.

863
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:18,420
Shit!

864
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,390
Just give me my fucking phone call.

865
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:30,270
I understand.

866
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:32,400
Look, the lawyers will have you out in 24 hours.

867
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,360
Just don't say anything else.

868
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:37,610
Jesus, you really screwed up.

869
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:43,630
Don't you get it? I work for Dick Jones!

870
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,260
Dick Jones!

871
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,930
I work for Dick Jones!

872
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,310
He runs OCP. OCP runs the cops.

873
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,650
Come in, Officer.

874
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:02,280
You know, I don't usually see anyone without an appointment,

875
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,110
but in your case, I'll make an exception.

876
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,030
You are under arrest.

877
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:07,910
On what charge?

878
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,160
Aiding and abetting a known felon.

879
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,710
Sounds like I'm in a lot of trouble.

880
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:16,790
You better take me in.

881
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,170
I will.

882
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,390
What's the matter, Officer?

883
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,820
I'll tell you what's the matter.

884
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,440
It's a little insurance policy called Directive 4.

885
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,740
My little contribution to your psychological profile.

886
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:50,280
Any attempt to arrest a senior officer of OCP

887
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,200
results in shutdown.

888
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,080
What did you think?

889
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:01,170
That you were an ordinary police officer?

890
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:03,010
You're our product.

891
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,340
And we can't very well have our products turning against us, can we?

892
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:13,220
Still a little fight left in you.

893
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:21,480
Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.

894
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:30,580
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake.

895
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,200
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

896
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:47,530
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line. There's trouble in the tower!

897
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:00,390
Prepare to fire.

898
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,230
- Hey, wait a second!  - He's a cop, for God's sakes!

899
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:07,270
- Hedgecock! You can't do that!  - We have orders to destroy it.

900
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,730
- Oh, shit!  - You're maniacs!

901
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,440
Fire at will.

902
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,130
Move in.

903
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,060
Murphy!

904
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:32,360
Murphy, it's me.

905
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:36,860
Lewis.

906
01:15:47,670 --> 01:15:48,790
Move down!

907
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:50,460
On the next level.

908
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,590
Lieutenant! Level 3, level 3. He's on level 3!

909
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:55,130
Over here! Over here!

910
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:56,760
Open fire!

911
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,110
It's back.

912
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:19,450
Big is back, because bigger is better.

913
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:23,730
6000 SUX. An American tradition

914
01:16:23,740 --> 01:16:26,660
Good evening. I'm Jesse Perkins with Casey Wong.

915
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:28,750
Top story, Santa Barbara.

916
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,840
10,000 acres of wooded residential land were scorched in an instant

917
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,590
when a laser cannon aboard the strategic defense peace platform

918
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:39,180
misfired today during routine start-up tests.

919
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:40,220
Casey.

920
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:45,010
Yes, it was a day of mourning for the families of 113 people known dead at this hour,

921
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,350
among them, two former United States Presidents

922
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:49,890
who had retired in the Santa Barbara area.

923
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,980
A day of mourning for a country.

924
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:56,190
Police union representatives and OCP continue negotiations today

925
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:59,700
in hopes of averting a citywide strike by police,

926
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,360
scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.

927
01:17:02,450 --> 01:17:04,200
Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.

928
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:07,330
They're still on duty, but what about tomorrow?

929
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:10,750
That's the question we put to people in the crime-plagued Lexington area.

930
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:14,040
They're public servants. They got job security.

931
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,880
They're not supposed to strike.

932
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:16,960
It's a free society,

933
01:17:18,090 --> 01:17:19,760
except there ain't nothin' free

934
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:21,590
'cause there's no guarantees, you know?

935
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,510
You're on your own.

936
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:25,180
It's the law of the jungle.

937
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:30,680
Be very careful.

938
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:32,140
Excuse me, please.

939
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:35,940
They must be remodeling.

940
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,360
Hiya, Barbara.

941
01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:46,490
Listen, I'm here to see Dick Jones.

942
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:49,790
But when I'm done, I've got some free time.

943
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,960
Maybe you could fit me in.

944
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,420
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

945
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,340
You can keep the gum.

946
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,850
This looks good. Get a measurement on that.

947
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:07,930
Bring a hammer, too.

948
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:12,310
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

949
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:14,520
That thing is still alive.

950
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:16,610
I don't know what you're talking about.

951
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:20,030
The police officer who arrested you, the one you spilled your guts to.

952
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:24,700
Hey. Take a look at my face, Dick.

953
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,660
He was trying to kill me.

954
01:18:27,740 --> 01:18:29,740
He's a cyborg, you idiot.

955
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,540
He recorded every word you said.

956
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:36,330
His memory's admissible as evidence.

957
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:38,290
You involved me.

958
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,380
You're gonna have to kill it.

959
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,720
Listen, chief.

960
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:51,600
Your company built the fucking thing.

961
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:54,390
Now I got to deal with it?

962
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,350
I don't have time for this bullshit.

963
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,480
Suit yourself, Clarence.

964
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:01,980
But Delta City begins construction in two months.

965
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,240
That's 2 million workers living in trailers.

966
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:08,620
That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.

967
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:13,620
Virgin territory for the man who knows how to open up new markets.

968
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:16,540
One man could control it all,

969
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:18,540
Clarence.

970
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,460
I guess we're gonna be friends after all,

971
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,720
Richard.

972
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:33,270
Destroy it.

973
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:37,520
Gonna need some major firepower.

974
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:42,270
You got access to military weaponry?

975
01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:46,280
We practically are the military.

976
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,240
Did you bring the gun?

977
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,610
The precinct was deserted.

978
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,160
Half the force didn't show up for work today.

979
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:32,240
Everyone else walks out at midnight.

980
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,910
I guess we're on strike.

981
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:37,660
I wasn't sure what you needed. I sort of grabbed things.

982
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:41,630
Your gun.

983
01:20:43,130 --> 01:20:44,840
You asked for this?

984
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,590
I brought you some food.

985
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,760
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

986
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:21,120
You may not like what you're going to see.

987
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:58,410
It's really good to see you again, Murphy.

988
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:06,380
Murphy had a wife and son. What happened to them?

989
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:11,050
After the funeral, she moved away.

990
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,180
Where did they go?

991
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,140
She thought you were dead. She started over again.

992
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,940
I can feel them.

993
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,270
But I can't remember them.

994
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:36,620
Leave me alone.

995
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:26,830
Happy birthday, Dave. She's from me.

996
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,210
Well, can I have you both?

997
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:35,010
- Sure. We've had our shots.  - Sure. We've had our shots.

998
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,930
I'd buy that for a dollar!

999
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:46,270
Hey, Emil.

1000
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:48,230
How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

1001
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:50,650
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.

1002
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:52,110
Nobody popped my cherry.

1003
01:23:52,190 --> 01:23:54,360
Emil, how you doing, man? Good to see you.

1004
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,780
- Hey! Hey!  - Hey!

1005
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:57,780
First they let me out of jail for free,

1006
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:00,620
then what do I find in the prison parking lot

1007
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,120
but a brand new 6000 SUX.

1008
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,120
Still got the factory sticker on it!

1009
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:06,790
Clarence.

1010
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,080
Joey's got a carjust like yours, man.

1011
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,710
Yo, Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

1012
01:24:18,930 --> 01:24:20,470
What do you got there, Clarence?

1013
01:24:20,550 --> 01:24:22,050
Wait up for me!

1014
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:26,220
Whoa! A new toy! Can I play?

1015
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:30,270
Watch this.

1016
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:32,860
Wait... Wait a minute, Clarence, Clarence!

1017
01:24:34,270 --> 01:24:36,070
Shit!

1018
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:39,610
What the fuck?

1019
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,660
- Nice car, Joe.  - Fuck you, Clarence.

1020
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:42,780
Let me try that.

1021
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,790
Cobra Assault Cannon. State of the art. Bang!Bang!

1022
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:55,340
I like it!

1023
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:58,130
Give it up, faggot. Let a man...

1024
01:24:58,220 --> 01:24:59,550
No, butthole! Get your own!

1025
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:00,880
Come on!

1026
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,810
Get the other gun, Emil!

1027
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,900
No car is safe!

1028
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,150
Do it, Emil!

1029
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:21,990
Heads up, you guys.

1030
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:33,880
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

1031
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,710
All right, cut the horseshit! We're moving out.

1032
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,170
Come on, Emil! Get your ass in the van!

1033
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,970
Come on, lard ass, let's move it!

1034
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,140
I'll get you, faggot!

1035
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:38,610
What are you doing?

1036
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:42,740
My targeting system is a little messed up.

1037
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:47,320
Can I help you?

1038
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,700
Aim for me.

1039
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:02,380
Are you locked in now?

1040
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:03,550
Yes.

1041
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:06,300
A little more to the left.

1042
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:08,350
Here.

1043
01:27:16,650 --> 01:27:18,520
I figure that's dead-on.

1044
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:19,940
Thank you.

1045
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:40,500
- All right. Let's do it.  - Come on, man, let's smoke him!

1046
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:45,800
The wrecking crew is here! Where is that metallic mother?

1047
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:47,470
Zip it up, Emil!

1048
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:50,050
Nothing fancy. Just kill him. Emil!

1049
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,350
- What?  - In the van.

1050
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:57,140
You should get out of here now.

1051
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,900
Hey, we're partners.

1052
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:01,310
Get the car.

1053
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:39,140
Damn it! Shit!

1054
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,770
Looking for me?

1055
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,540
Cut him off! Come on!

1056
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,160
Go on, cut him off!

1057
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,660
Go, go!

1058
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,990
Okay! Now I got you!

1059
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:20,910
Shit!

1060
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,800
Help me.

1061
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,810
Don't touch me, man!

1062
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:41,930
Help me.

1063
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:45,980
God!

1064
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,120
Shit!

1065
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:31,360
Bye-bye, baby.

1066
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:32,940
Clarence!

1067
01:31:58,930 --> 01:31:59,970
Okay.

1068
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,010
L give up

1069
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,140
I'm not arresting you anymore.

1070
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:06,730
Now, wait a second.

1071
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:15,110
Wait a minute.

1072
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:17,360
You're taking this kind of personal, aren't you?

1073
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:20,910
Come on, man. Come on, now. You're making me nervous.

1074
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:22,620
Come on, you can't do this.

1075
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:24,700
Come on now! Don't mess around!

1076
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:26,870
Hey! Hey!

1077
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,830
Come on, man, now, don't get cute!

1078
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:35,210
Die, you bastard!

1079
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,300
Yeah!

1080
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:38,170
Yeah! All right!

1081
01:32:38,550 --> 01:32:40,010
All right!

1082
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:42,510
I got him, Clarence! I got him!

1083
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,670
Sayonara, Robocop!

1084
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:28,020
Lewis!

1085
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:30,940
Lewis!

1086
01:33:34,270 --> 01:33:36,570
Murphy, I'm a mess!

1087
01:33:39,690 --> 01:33:41,280
They'll fix you.

1088
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:43,990
They fix everything.

1089
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,000
The police strike could really work for us.

1090
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:59,380
By the end of the week, we can have Ed 209s in place all over the city

1091
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:01,550
and expect immediate public support.

1092
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:04,840
I've got one downstairs guarding the building now.

1093
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:14,770
You are illegally parked on private property.

1094
01:34:14,980 --> 01:34:17,860
You have 20 seconds to move your vehicle.

1095
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:55,100
...because whatever happens,

1096
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:58,440
this corporation will live up to the guiding principles of its founder.

1097
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,990
Courage, strength, conviction.

1098
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:09,870
We will meet each new challenge with the same aggressive attitude.

1099
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:13,500
What is it?

1100
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,420
I don't know.

1101
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:21,300
How can we help you, Officer?

1102
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:23,880
Dick Jones is wanted for murder.

1103
01:35:24,050 --> 01:35:28,760
This is absurd! That thing is a violent mechanical psychopath.

1104
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:33,180
My program will not allow me to act against an officer of this company.

1105
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:36,390
These are serious charges. What is your evidence?

1106
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:50,240
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake.

1107
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,870
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

1108
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:58,500
I had to kill Bob Morton because he made a mistake.

1109
01:35:59,330 --> 01:36:01,920
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

1110
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,550
He's got a gun!

1111
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:05,920
Get up!

1112
01:36:06,010 --> 01:36:07,800
I want a chopper. Now!

1113
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:11,220
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

1114
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,390
I will board the chopper with my hostage.

1115
01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,440
Anybody tries to stop me,

1116
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:21,610
the old geezer gets it.

1117
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:26,610
Dick, you're fired!

1118
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,490
Thank you.

1119
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:57,520
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?

1120
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:01,480
Murphy.
