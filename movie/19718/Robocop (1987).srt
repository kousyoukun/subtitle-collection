00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,139
This is Media Break.

00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:59,684
<i>You give us three minutes</i>
<i>and we'll give you the world.</i>

00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,770
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>I'm Casey Wong with Jesse Perkins.</i>

00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,647
<i>Top story, Pretoria.</i>

5
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>The threat of nuclear confrontation</i>
<i>in South Africa escalated today</i>

6
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,653
<i>when the ruling</i>
<i>white military government</i>

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,782
<i>of that besieged city-state</i>
<i>unveiled a French-made neutron bomb</i>

8
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:18,077
<i>and affirmed its willingness</i>
<i>to use the three megaton device</i>

9
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,663
<i>as the city's last line of defense.</i>

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,416
<i>And the President's first press conference</i>

11
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,002
<i>from the Star Wars</i>
<i>orbiting peace platform</i>

12
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,795
<i>got off to a shaky start,</i>

13
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>when power failed causing a brief,</i>
<i>but harmless, period of weightlessness</i>

14
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:34,552
<i>for the visiting President and his staff.</i>

15
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,679
<i>We'll be back in a moment.</i>

16
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,515
<i>ls it time for that big operation?</i>

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,977
<i>This may be</i>
<i>the most important decision of your life.</i>

18
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,023
So come down
<i>and talk to one of our qualified surgeons</i>

19
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,192
<i>here at the Family Heart Center.</i>

20

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,951
<i>Extended warranties, financing.</i>

<i>Qualifies for health tax credit.</i>

<i>And remember, we care.</i>

26
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,046
<i>Three dead police officers,</i>
<i>one critically injured.</i>

27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,008
<i>Police union leaders blame</i>
<i>Omni Consumer Products, OCP,</i>

28
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:17,220
<i>the firm which recently</i>
<i>entered into a contract with the city</i>

29
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:20,723
<i>to fund and run the</i>
<i>Detroit Metropolitan Police Department.</i>

30
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,226
<i>Dick Jones, Division President, OCP.</i>

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,269
<i>Every policeman knows</i>
<i>when he joins the force</i>

32
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,980
<i>that there are certain inherent risks</i>
<i>that come with the territory.</i>

33
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,065
<i>Ask any cop, he'll tell you,</i>

34
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,567
<i>"lf you can't stand the heat,</i>
<i>you better stay out of the kitchen."</i>

35
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,488
<i>Although seriously wounded,</i>
<i>Officer Frank Frederickson escaped</i>

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,532
<i>and identified this man.</i>

37
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:41,410
<i>Clarence Boddicker,</i>
<i>unofficial crime boss of Old Detroit.</i>

38
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,914
<i>Now sought in connection</i>
<i>with the deaths of 31 police officers.</i>

39
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,290
<i>Today, he's at large,</i>

40
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,960
<i>while doctors at</i>
<i>Henry Ford Memorial Hospital</i>

41
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,171
<i>fight to save the life</i>
<i>of Officer Frank Frederickson.</i>

42
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:53,422
<i>Good luck, Frank.</i>

43
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,394
Attempted murder?
lt's not like he killed someone.

44
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,771
This is a clear violation
of my client's civil rights.

45
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:12,692
Make it aggravated assault,
and l can make bail, in cash, now.

46
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,571
Listen, pal, your client's a scumbag,
you're a scumbag,

47
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,781
and scumbags see the judge
on Monday morning!

48
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:22,785
Now get out of my police station,
and take laughing boy with you!

49
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,161
Get over there!

50
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,874
You have the right to remain silent.
Do you understand me?

51
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,166
Sure, sure.

52
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,626
-Priors?
-No.

53
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,711
Hi.

54
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,756
Murphy. Transferring in from Metro South.

55
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,300
Nice precinct.

56
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,385
Yeah, pretty good.

57
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,931
We work for a living down here, Murphy.
Get your armor and suit up.

58
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,563
Please take me home!

59
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,398
Not now, E.J. Get a cup of coffee.

60
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,566
Sarge.

61
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,651
Stark, is there any word on Frederickson?

62
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,445
They're still listing him as critical.

63
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,822
His wife must be going out of her mind.

64
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,490
-Murphy?
-Yeah, that's me.

65
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,742
-Manson.
-Hi.

66
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,619
What brings you to this little paradise?

67
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,330
Beats me, man. l think OCP's moving
a lot of new guys up here.

68
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,334
Omni Consumer Products.
What a bunch of morons.

69
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,130
They're gonna manage this department
right into the ground!

70
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,299
-Where are you from?
-Metro South.

71
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,425
Welcome to hell.

72
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,843
-Murphy.
-Yo.

73
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,845
You cut 1 0 guys
loose over on the east side.

74
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,514
You try to get backup
when you're in a jam.

75
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,267
Yeah, try to get a medevac
after you've been jammed.

76
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,646
l'll tell you what we should do.
We should strike. Fuck 'em!

77
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,867
Oh, boy.

78
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:46,577
The funeral's tomorrow.

79
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:52,333
The department requests
all officers not on duty to attend.

80
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,796
Any donations for the family
may be given to Cecil as usual.

81
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,760
And l don't want to hear
any more talk about strike!

82
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,514
We're not plumbers. We're police officers.

83
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,558
And police officers don't strike.

84
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,606
Murphy, front and center.

85
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,334
Hello, tiger.

86
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,057
Yes!

87
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,604
Lewis, come here when you're finished
fucking around with your suspect.

88
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,023
Get on your feet!

89
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,280
This guy's gonna be your new partner.

90
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,866
Murphy, meet Lewis.
Show him the neighborhood.

91
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,909
Glad to know you, Murphy.

92
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,661
Pretty neat.

93
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,292
l better drive
until you know your way around.

94
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,713
l usually drive
when l'm breaking in a new partner.

95
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,236
You really think
the old man is gonna be there?

96
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,863
Why would they invite us?

97
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,783
All division heads
are bringing their support teams.

98
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,159
lt's big.

99
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,203
l figure they're green-lighting Delta City.

100
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:55,331
What, are you kidding?
They never do anything ahead of schedule.

101
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,001
lt's Jones. He's got the 209 series online
and now he wants to show off.

102
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,878
That's a tough break, Bob.

103
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,588
What? What?

104
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,175
Well, ED 209
ran into serious delays and cost overruns.

105
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,344
The old man ordered a backup plan.

106
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,346
<i>95th floor. Have a nice day.</i>

107
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,807
Probably just to
light a fire under Jones' ass.

108
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,351
-Yeah?
-Old Bob here gets the assignment.

109
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,519
Yeah.

110
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,730
Nobody in Security Concepts
takes it seriously.

111
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,150
lt's a better plan. Fucking Jones!
l'd go straight to the Old Man if l could.

112
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,486
Don't mess with Jones, man.
He'll make sushi out of you.

113
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,572
Yeah, you better be careful, man.
l heard Jones is a real shark.

114
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,366
-Who asked you, twerp?
-Bob.

115
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,535
What about this police thing,
what's the problem?

116
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,662
Their union's been bitching
ever since we took over.

117
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,789
You know, the usual nonsense.

118
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,874
We'll turn things around.

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,502
Good, very good. Let's get started.

120
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,844
Now, friends,

121
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,266
l've had this dream
for more than a decade now.

122
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,937
A dream which l've invited you all
to share with me.

123
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:06,318
ln six months, we begin construction
of Delta City.

124
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,239
Where Old Detroit now stands.

125
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,953
Old Detroit has a cancer.

126
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,622
The cancer is crime.

127
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,750
And it must be cut out
before we employ the 2 million workers

128
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,919
that will breathe life into this city again.

129
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,045
Yes.

130
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,510
Although shifts in the tax structure

131
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,847
have created an economy
ideal for corporate growth,

132
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:38,100
community services,
in this case law enforcement,

133
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,269
have suffered.

134
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,232
l think it's time we gave something back.

135
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,277
Dick.

136
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,666
Take a close look
at the track record of this company.

137
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,669
And you'll see that we have gambled
in markets

138
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,297
traditionally regarded as nonprofit.

139
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:13,052
Hospitals, prisons, space exploration.

140
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,847
l say good business is where you find it.

141
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,810
As you know,
we've entered into a contract with the city

142
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,104
to run local law enforcement.

143
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,441
But at Security Concepts,

144
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:31,570
we believe an efficient police force
is only part of the solution.

145
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,490
No. We need something more.

146
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,910
We need a 24-hour-a-day police officer.

147
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,163
A cop that doesn't need to eat or sleep.

148
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,709
A cop with superior firepower
and the reflexes to use it.

149
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,630
Fellow executives,

150
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:54,343
it gives me great pleasure to introduce
you to the future of law enforcement.

151
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,515
Ed 209.

152
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:41,223
The Enforcement Droid series 209
is a self-sufficient law enforcement robot.

153
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,518
209 is currently programmed
for urban pacification,

154
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,353
but that is only the beginning.

155
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,565
After a successful tour of duty
in Old Detroit,

156
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:54,403
we can expect 209 to become the
hot military product for the next decade.

157
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,740
-Dr. McNamara.
-We'll need an arrest subject.

158
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,074
-Mr. Kinney.
-Yes, sir?

159
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,326
Would you come up
and give us a hand, please?

160
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,702
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:06,623
Mr. Kinney is going to help us simulate
a typical arrest and disarming procedure.

162
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,960
Mr. Kinney,
use your gun in a threatening manner.

163
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,298
-Point it at Ed 209.
-Yes, sir.

164
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,644
<i>Please put down your weapon.</i>
<i>You have 20 seconds to comply.</i>

165
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:32,274
l think you'd better do what he says,
Mr. Kinney.

166
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,491
<i>You now have 1 5 seconds to comply.</i>

167
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,785
<i>-You are in direct violation...</i>
-Cut the power! Pull the board!

168
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,246
<i>...of Penal Code 1 13, Section 9.</i>

169
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,374
<i>You now have five seconds to comply.</i>

170
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,917
Help! Help me!

171
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,504
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

172
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,548
<i>l am now authorized to use physical force.</i>

173
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,033
lt's horrible.

174
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:25,202
Somebody want to call
a goddamn paramedic?

175
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,497
Let's go, Johnson!
You pull the plug on this thing!

176
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,834
All right, don't touch him.

177
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,794
Don't touch him!

178
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,045
He didn't hear the gun drop.

179
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,463
He didn't hear it?

180
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,799
Oh, God.

181
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:41,510
Dick, l'm very disappointed.

182
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,056
l'm sure it's only a glitch,
a temporary setback.

183
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:48,016
You call this a glitch?

184
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,146
We're scheduled to begin construction
in six months.

185
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,191
Your temporary setback could cost us
$50 million in interest payments alone.

186
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,943
Not necessarily, sir.

187
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,820
Perhaps you're aware
of the Robocop program

188
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,655
developed by myself at Security Concepts

189
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,824
as a contingency
against just this sort of thing.

190
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,451
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Morton.

191
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,494
l'm sure this is something
we can take up in my office...

192
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,579
Now, wait a minute. Dick!

193
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,456
Get me out of here!

194
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,626
Maybe what we need here
is a fresh perspective.

195
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,880
Tell me about your plan, Mr. Morton.
How long will it take?

196
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,922
We're ready to go, sir.

197
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:20,674
We've restructured the police department

198
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,885
and placed prime candidates
according to risk factor.

199
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,345
l'm confident that we can go to prototype
within 90 days.

200
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,056
Good, very good.
Get your staff together, Mr. Morton.

201
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,726
l'll expect a full presentation
in 20 minutes.

202
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,936
Thank you, sir.

203
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,445
Yes! Now, that's how it's done
in the big leagues, Johnson.

204
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,989
You see an opening, you go for it.

205
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,285
You better watch your back, Bob.
Jones is going to come looking for you.

206
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:52,247
Fuck Jones. He fumbled the ball
and l was there to pick it up.

207
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,750
Too bad about Kinney.

208
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,169
That's life in the big city.

209
00:13:58,213 --> 00:13:59,796
When do we start?

210
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,591
As soon as
some poor schmuck volunteers.

211
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:07,554
<i>Unit 3509, proceed to Hall and Grand.</i>
<i>41 1 involving indigents.</i>

212
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,932
<i>Roger, we're on our way.</i>

213
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,818
Pretty fancy moves, Murphy.

214
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,322
Yeah, my son, Jimmy,
watches this cop show, TJ Lazer,

215
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,367
and this Lazer guy does this
every time he takes down a bad guy.

216
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,827
So naturally,
my kid thinks every good cop should be...

217
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,788
And you don't want to disappoint him.

218
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:37,543
Yeah, well, role models
can be very important to a boy.

219
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,468
Okay, okay, l get a kick out of it.

220
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,637
<i>All units, all units, sector 9.</i>

221
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,514
-That's for...
<i>-21 1 in progress.</i>

222
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,641
Why don't you drive?

223
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,603
<i>...the suspects are armed</i>
<i>and considered dangerous.</i>

224
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,399
Shit.

225
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,318
l don't believe it!

226
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,486
What?

227
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,780
You burned the fucking money!

228
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,907
l had to blow the door. What do you want?

229
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,993
lt's as good as marked, you asshole!

230
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:13,495
You stupid, stupid asshole!

231
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,123
-Clarence!
-What? What do you want?

232
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,874
We got a cop on our tail.

233
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,009
Come on, man, speed it up! Move it!

234
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,219
This crate ain't gonna outrun a cop.

235
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,888
-Slow down, then.
-What, are you crazy, man?

236
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,891
Shut the fuck up and do it! Just do it!

237
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,853
Central, this is 1 54.
We're in pursuit of 21 1 suspect.

Bobby, get the door!

243
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,323
Everybody load up!

244
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,158
All right, let's go. Come on!

245
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,785
-Okay.
-All right, here we go.

246
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,125
Now.

247
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,505
What the fuck? Where did he go?

248
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,715
Emil?

249
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,175
Here! He's up here!

250
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,680
He's on the side.

251
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,265
He's over here!

252
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,857
Get him!

253
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,742
Shit, Clarence, my leg!

254
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,078
Leon, pick him up.

255
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,205
-Ready?
-No, hang on.

256
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,332
Bobby.

257
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,211
-Can you fly, Bobby?
-Clarence, no!

258
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:45,796
Hit it!

259

No!

260
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,531
Central, this is unit 1 54.

261
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,242
We located that van by the old mill
in Sector 3D.

262
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,619
-Now, where is that backup?
<i>-Backup is still unavailable.</i>

263

Oh, man!

264

<i>We estimate 10 minutes</i>
<i>before units can arrive.</i>

265
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,459
Well, you call it.

266
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,963
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

267
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:35,971
Go.

268
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,306
Stay in touch.

269
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,184
Freeze.

270
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,646
Okay, let's see those hands.

271
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,857
Nice and easy.

272
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:30,817
Sure.

273
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,987
Mind if l zip this up?

274
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,176
We keep robbing banks,
but we never get to keep the money.

275
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,636
Takes money to make money.

276
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,887
We steal money to buy coke,

277
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,223
then sell the coke
to make even more money.

278
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,349
Capital investment, man.

279
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,060
Yeah, why bother making it
when we can just steal it?

280
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,813
Ain't no better way to steal
money than free enterprise.

281
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,356
-Smoke?
-No.

282
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,900
-You know, those things will kill you.
-Yeah.

283
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,611
You want to live forever?

284

00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:27,916
Hey.

287
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,751
Don't move.

288
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,841
Go ahead and do it.

289
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,261
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

290

<i>Lewis. Lewis!</i>

291

Lewis, l got a situation here, girl.

292
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,943
Okay, tough guy, get up. Get up!

293
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,404
Turn around.
Spread your legs. That's right.

294
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,949
<i>Lewis, where are you? You all right?</i>

295
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,412
Put your hands on your head. Lewis?

296
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,294
Why don't you let us
take over from here, Emil?

297
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,565
-Your ass is mine.
-No.

298
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,068
Not yet it ain't.

299
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,999
Well, what have we here?

300
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:56,046
You a good cop, hotshot?

301
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,841
Sure you are.

302
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:05,847
Why, you got to be some kind of great cop
to come in here all by yourself.

303
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,022
Where's your partner?

304
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,691
Well, guys, the other one was upstairs.

305
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:19,069
She was sweet,

306
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,364
l took her out.

307
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,120
l bet that really pisses you off.

308
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,754
You probably don't think
l'm a very nice guy.

309
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,422
Do you?

310
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,549
Buddy, l think you're slime.

311
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,181
You see, l got this problem.

312
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:53,561
Cops don't like me, so l don't like cops.

313
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,038
Well, give the man a hand.

314
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,751
He's all yours.

315
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,060
-All right, look out.
-Turn around, man.

316
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,438
Pretty boy, over here.

317
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,834
Shit! l'm out of ammo.

318
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,127
Me, too.

319
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,676
Hey Clarence, he's still alive.

320
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,597
Does it hurt? Does it hurt?

321
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,814
Okay, fun's over.

322
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,113
Okay, let's get out of here.

323
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,742
Good night, sweet prince.

324
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,245
Hey, wait up, wait up, wait up.

325
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,229
Murphy.

326
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,836
Get him over. Lift!

327
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,506
Get the ventilator.

328
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,216
Put him in OR 4.

329
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:35,265
Easy, easy. Turn.

330
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:40,061
Slow it down now.
Slow it down, slow it down.

331
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,771
Okay, hit the door.

332
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,652
Let me get pressure.

333
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,987
Mask him.

334
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,865
Got a pressure of 60 palp.

335
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,741
All right, we have to intubate this guy.

336
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,911
Apply cricoid pressure.

337
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:01,166
Okay. All right, l got it in. Breath sounds.

338
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:03,459
-You're in.
-Other side.

339
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,088
Okay, let's go ahead
and get the MAST trousers up.

340
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:08,381
Let's get the clothes off.

341
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,467
Okay, clothes off.
Let's prep him for a central line.

342
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,596
Let's get some blood drawn.
Type and crossing, six units.

343
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,268
<i>His pressure's dropping.</i>

344
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,437
<i>Okay, l've got a central line in.</i>

345
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,230
<i>l'm getting pressure back. Normal saline.</i>

346
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:25,481
Can you do that, Dad?

347
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:31,070
l really have to tell you something.

348
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,448
<i>-What's our blood pressure?</i>
<i>-l've got 40 palp.</i>

349
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,824
<i>All right.</i>

350
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:43,958
Coarse V-Fib. Okay, we got to shock him.

351
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,668
Let's get the Ambu bag.

352
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,420
Clear the patches.

353
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,255
Put the Foley in.

354
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:51,466
Let's go ahead and blow
his MAST trousers.

355
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,717
Stand clear.

356
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,719
Stand clear. Shock him.

357
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,137
<i>All right.</i>

358
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:59,098
Coarse V-Fib. Let's shock him again.

359
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,683
Clear.

360
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,561
<i>All right.</i>

361
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,481
Flatline. Let's go intracardiac epinephrine.

362
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,815
Let's go.

363
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,192
Okay.

364
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,820
All right, it's in.

365
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:13,988
There's no pulse.

366
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,991
All right, let's go ahead
and shock a flat line, and let's quit.

367
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,243
Okay, everybody, clear!

368
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,327
Stand clear.

369
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,336
All right, l think that's all we can do.

370
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,588
Let's call it. What's the time?

371
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:33,258
6:1 5.

372
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,316
Sharp.

373
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,694
No, it's starting to roll.

374
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,571
Still rolling.

375
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,407
-Shit!
-Nope.

376
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,910
Let me see.

377
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,663
Bring in the L.E.D.

378
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,707
Let's lock it down.

379
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,383
-He's on.
-What's the story?

380
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,135
We were able to save the left arm.

381
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,096
What? l thought we agreed
on total body prosthesis.

382
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,890
-Now, lose the arm, okay?
-Jesus, Morton.

383
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,144
Can he understand what l'm saying?

384
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:28,563
lt doesn't matter.
We're gonna blank his memory, anyway.

385
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,232
Well, l think we should lose the arm.
What do you think, Johnson?

386
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,484
Well, he signed the release forms
when he joined the force.

387
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:36,946
He's legally dead.
We can do pretty much what we want to.

388
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,074
Lose the arm.

389
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,244
Shut him down. Prep him for surgery.

390
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,251
The entire outer skin will be like this.

391
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,462
lt's titanium laminated with Kevlar.

392
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,589
Go ahead. Shake his hand.

393
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,593
Come here often? How you doing?

394
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,554
Oh, God!

395
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,599
He's got a hell of a grip.

396
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,686
lt's 400 foot-pounds.
He could crush every bone in your hand.

397
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,147
All right. Attach it to his shoulder.

398
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,774
l like that.

399
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,282
You are gonna be a bad motherfucker.

400
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,958
Hey, look, look! He's watching us!

401
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,335
How you doing?

402
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,878
-Hi!
-Hi!

403
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,590
Happy new year!

404
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,175
This is for you.

405
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:43,554
Happy new year.

406
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,396
We get the best of both worlds.

407
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,981
The fastest reflexes
modern technology has to offer,

408
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,817
onboard computer-assisted memory,

409
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:59,112
and a lifetime of on the street
law enforcement programming.

410
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,281
lt is my great pleasure to present to you,

411
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,243
Robocop.

412
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:11,040
Come on, come on, come on.

413
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,167
Come on. That's for you. That's for you.

414
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,502
Go, Robo.

415
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,731
l am what you call a repeat offender.

416
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:38,192
l repeat, l will offend again.

417
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,528
l get my orders from a higher source.

418
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,863
Shut up, asshole.

419
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,574
Does your mother know you talk like that?

420
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,411
Bring him in through the side door.

421
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:50,329
This holding cell
has been set up for observation.

422
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,372
Looks perfect.

423
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:53,166
-What is this all about?
-Who is this guy?

424
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,042
-Sergeant John Reed.
-What's this all about?

425
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,671
lt's about official OCP business.
So please, get lost.

426
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,381
l think we've got four or five days setup...

427
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,676
Hey, this is bullshit!
l take my orders from...

428
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,945
What is this shit?

429
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,363
Yeah, good question.

430
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:28,117
-Hey, wait for me, partner.
-Let's go.

431
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:30,036
There they are.

432
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,579
Go.

433
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,385
When you are at rest,
you will sit in the chair.

434
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,137
<i>Yes. l understand.</i>

435
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:49,931
What about tracking?

436
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,600
We can check his exact location
at all times with one of these.

437
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,770
How does he eat?

438
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,939
His digestive system is extremely simple.

439
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,107
This processor dispenses
a rudimentary paste

440
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,485
that sustains his organic system.

441
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,328
Tastes like baby food.

442
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:15,623
Knock yourself out.

443
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,219
Okay, let's start with tracking.

444
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,387
-Give me a grid.
-Got it.

445
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,471
There.

446
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,597
-Target?
-Check.

447
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,016
-Target.
-Check.

448
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:35,476
Now follow.

449
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:39,730
Check.

450
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:43,317
Voice stress analyzer, one, two,

451
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,778
three.

452
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,821
-Check.
-Record.

453
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,782
-Now playback.
-Bring it up 50%.

454
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,493
<i>-Now playback.</i>
<i>-Bring it up 50%.</i>

455
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,744
<i>Give me a full frame.</i>

456
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:55,538
-We got it.
-All right, clear out.

457
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:59,000
What are your prime directives?

458
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:03,963
<i>Serve the public trust,</i>
<i>protect the innocent, uphold the law.</i>

459
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,759
That's good.

460
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,511
That's very good.

461
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,855
l fucking love that guy!

462
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,227
lt's Supercop.

463
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,271
Look at that fucking gun.

464
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,288
Shit!

465
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,084
-This guy's really good.
-He's not a guy. He's a machine.

466
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,086
What are they gonna do, replace us?

467
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:33,969
Come on.

468
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,685
-Reed.
-Yeah?

469
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,103
He needs a car.

470
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,272
<i>Thank you.</i>

471
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:48,401
Sure. Anytime.

472
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,278
Oh, yeah. Go get 'em, boy!

473
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,982
<i>l'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

474
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,080
Will there be anything else, sir?

475
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,791
Yeah, empty the register
and put the money in the bag.

476
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,168
Excuse me?

477
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:51,130
l said give me your money and all of it,
and don't fuck with me!

478
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:52,465
Now move!

479
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,884
Open the safe, Pops.

480
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,803
Open the goddamn safe!

481
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,388
We don't have a safe.

482
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,350
Shit! There's your goddamn safe!
Open that son of a bitch!

483
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,311
Quit stalling, man!
l'm gonna count to three!

484
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,729
You better open that son of a bitch.

485
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,272
Come on! Come on!

486
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,357
l'm gonna blow her brains out.

487
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,528
-l'll open the safe.
-Good boy.

488
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,863
Come on.

489
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,908
Well, you better open that
on the count of three.

490
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,076
One, two...

491
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,206
Fuck me.

492
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,209
<i>Drop the gun. You are under arrest.</i>

493
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:37,426
Fuck me! Fuck me!

494
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,386
Fuck me!

495
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,275
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.</i>
<i>Good night.</i>

496
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,654
<i>l'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

497
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,966
Don't touch me! Get away! Get away!

498
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,634
We don't want your bag!

499
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,094
We want you!

500
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:25,349
Take it easy! We don't want to hurt you!

501
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,475
That's too much hair.

502
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,894
l know, we'll give her a haircut!

503
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,899
-Hey.
-What?

504
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:37,027
There's more hair down there!

505
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,615
No, don't!

506
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:45,744
Please!

507
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,705
No!

508
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:51,876
Help me!

509
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,004
<i>Let the woman go. You are under arrest.</i>

510
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,213
Shit!

511
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,924
You better back up, pal!

512
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,926
'Cause, he's gonna kill her!

513
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,803
He's gonna kill her!

514
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,763
You fucking bitch!

515
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,640
He's gonna kill her, man!

516
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,642
He's gonna kill her!

517
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,652
<i>Your move, creep.</i>

518
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,862
Okay!

519
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,822
lt's okay!

520
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,372
l was so scared. Thank you.

521
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,082
Thank you.

522
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,754
<i>Madam, you have suffered</i>
<i>an emotional shock.</i>

523
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,340
<i>l will notify a rape crisis center.</i>

524
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,355
<i>All units, Sector 6,</i>
<i>please close intersections...</i>

525
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,905
l don't care.
Get those men by the stairs now!

526
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:04,198
Hit it!

527
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,079
Terrorism has never been
a factor in city politics before.

528
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:13,040
But that changed today
when former city councilman Ron Miller

529
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,792
entered City Hall with a gun.

530
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,210
He's now on the second floor

531
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,921
holding Mayor Gibson
and his staff hostage.

532
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,841
We do believe
that Miller has killed one of the hostages.

533
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:24,969
Lieutenant, what's next?

534
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,221
We wait.
Terrorism is a very tricky business.

535
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,723
Maximum and immediate retaliation
is the best policy.

536
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,433
But unfortunately...

537
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,726
Excuse us.

538
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,603
Where are you going?

539
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,357
Statement, please.

540
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,323
Let's have some crowd control!
Come on, get these people back!

541
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,242
Where the hell do you think you're going?

542
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,077
<i>Keep him talking.</i>

543
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,040
Who made you?

544
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,459
Are you invincible?

545
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:05,426
<i>Okay, Miller, don't hurt the Mayor.</i>
<i>We'll give you whatever you want.</i>

546
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,263
First, don't fuck with me!
l'm a desperate man!

547
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,100
And second, l want some fresh coffee!

548
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,103
And third, l want a recount!

549
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,523
And no matter how it turns out,
l want my old job back!

550
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,774
<i>Okay.</i>

551
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,943
And l want a bigger office!

552
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:25,237
And l want a new car!

553
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,114
And l want the City to pay for it all!

554
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,450
<i>What kind of car, Miller?</i>

555
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,452
Something with reclining leather seats,

556
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,455
that goes really fast and gets
really shitty gas mileage!

557
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,541
<i>How about the 6000 SUX?</i>

558
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,919
Yeah! Okay, sure!

559
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,799
What about cruise control?
Does it come with cruise control?

560
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:50,804
<i>Hey, no problem, Miller. Let the Mayor go,</i>
<i>we'll even throw in a Blaupunkt.</i>

561
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,808
Lieutenant, don't jerk me off!

562
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,853
When people jerk me off, l kill them!

563
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,521
You want to see?

564
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,487
Get up, Your Honor, get up. Get up!

565
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:08,155
Your public wants to see you!

566
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,159
Nobody ever takes me seriously!

567
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,828
We'll get serious now!

568
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,997
And kiss the Mayor's ass good-bye!

569
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,594
<i>Robocop. Who is he?</i>

570
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,097
<i>What is he? Where does he come from?</i>

571
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,516
<i>He's OCP's newest soldier</i>

<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

581

<i>More fighting in the Mexican crisis today</i>

582
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,669
<i>when American troops</i>
<i>participated in a joint raid</i>

<i>against rebel rocket positions in Acapulco.</i>

<i>Now this.</i>

<i>Red alert. Red alert. Red alert.</i>

587

<i>You crossed my line of death.</i>

588

<i>You haven't dismantled your MX stockpile.</i>

589
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,060
<i>Pakistan is threatening my border.</i>

590
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:22,855
<i>That's it, buster. No more military aid.</i>

<i>Nukem, get them before they get you.</i>

Handball Tuesday night?

604
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,028
Bill, l'd love to. But l got a date.

605
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:13,280
Couple models coming
over to my place. Know what l mean?

606
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,282
l'd buy that for a dollar.

607

Welcome to the club, Bob.

608
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,749
...and that's a true story.

609
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:28,378
Making a real name for yourself
in Security Concepts with Robocop.

610
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,880
l try.

611
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,965
l'm in on the bottom line, pal.

612
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,635
l hear Jones was plenty pissed.

613
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:38,180
Oh, you know, he's got this killer rep,
but it's a smokescreen.

614
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,309
Let's face it, he's lost his teeth.
The guy's a pussy.

615
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,144
Are we talking
about the same Dick Jones?

616
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:47,439
Hey, he's old, we're young, and that's life.

617
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,326
l got to...

618
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,246
l got to go. l got a meeting.

619
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,174
Congratulations, Bob.

620
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,343
Thanks.

621
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:20,555
l remember when l was
a young executive for this company.

622
00:43:21,182 --> 00:43:23,475
l used to call the old man funny names.

623
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,060
lron Butt,

624
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,187
Boner.

625
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:32,150
Once, l even called him asshole.

626
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,992
But there was always respect.

627
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,578
l always knew where the line was drawn.

628
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,375
And you just stepped over it, buddy boy.

629
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:53,547
You've insulted me,
and you've insulted this company

630
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,132
with that bastard creation of yours!

631
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,552
l had a guaranteed military sale
with Ed 209!

632
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,556
Renovation program.
Spare parts for 25 years.

633
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,225
Who cares if it worked or not?

634
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,104
The old man thought
it was pretty important,

635
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,355
Dick.

636
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,950
You know, he's a sweet old man.

637
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,872
And he means well.

638
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,084
But he's not going to live forever.

639
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,213
And l'm number two around here.

640
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,842
Pretty simple math, huh, Bob?

641
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,388
You just

642
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,059
fucked with the wrong guy.

643
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,436
You're out of your fucking mind.

644
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,318
You better pray

645
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,447
that that unholy monster of yours
doesn't screw up.

646
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,469
-You hungry?
-No, thanks.

647
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:06,012
No.

648
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,396
Goddamn rebels blew up the airport
in Acapulco yesterday.

649
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,357
Great. We were going there next week.
Wait, what was that?

650
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,074
Hey, look! Bucket boy's online.

651
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,053
Halt. Stop! Wait a minute!

652
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,889
What the hell's going on?

653
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,433
-l don't know. He just left.
-Just left?

654
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,519
Roosevelt!

655
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,355
Rosie, we got a problem.

656
00:46:59,984 --> 00:47:01,943
Out of the way!

657
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,112
Take a look at this.

658
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,034
Shit! Call Bob Morton!

659
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:22,130
Jerry, book him.
l'll catch up with you later.

660
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:31,014
Hello. l haven't really had a chance
to introduce myself.

661
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,099
l'm Anne Lewis.

662
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,436
Do you have a name?

663
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:45,403
<i>How can l help you, Officer Lewis?</i>

664
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:50,534
That's not really what l meant.
Don't you have a name?

665
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,494
Hold it. Just sign right here, sir.

666
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,162
You don't understand. l'm OCP.

667
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:58,124
Murphy, it's you.

668
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,882
You really don't remember me, do you?

669
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:07,300
<i>Excuse me.</i>

670
00:48:07,677 --> 00:48:09,135
<i>l have to go.</i>

671
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,972
<i>Somewhere there is a crime happening.</i>

672
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,139
Stop!

673
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,352
What did you talk to him about?
What did you say?

674
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,812
-Nothing.
-Shit.

675
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,980
Shit.

676
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,025
Stop!

677
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,694
You there, stop!

678
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:34,869
You're in a lot of trouble, Officer!
Come on!

679
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,332
l was assured full cooperation
by this precinct, buddy,

680
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,334
and if it gets screwed up
by one of your grunts,

681
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,502
l'm gonna have yourjob.

682
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:44,379
-What's the update?
-lt's hard to be 1 00%.

683
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,505
We have a glitch or what?

684
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:48,383
This system was never designed
to experience detailed somatic response.

685
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,343
He had a dream, a dream.

686
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:53,680
-This cop saw fit to question him.
-l didn't question him.

687
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,932
l asked him his name. He didn't know.

688
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,852
Great. Let me make it real clear for you.

689
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,313
He doesn't have a name.
He's got a program.

690
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,565
He's product. ls that clear?

691
00:49:03,983 --> 00:49:05,025
Sure.

692
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,943
l say we pull him in, run a systems check,
the works.

693
00:49:07,028 --> 00:49:08,236
Take a week. Maybe 1 0 days.

694
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,363
You want to take him offline
because he had a dream?

695
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:11,698
What, are you kidding?

696
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,742
Let's get out of here.

697
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,285
-Listen, Reed.
-Yeah?

698
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,331
Try to keep one thing in mind.
This project doesn't concern cops.

699
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,916
lt's classified. lt's OCP.

700
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,960
You got it, mister?

701
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,214
Yeah, l got it.

702
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,716
Good.

703
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,968
Right, we keep him on the street...

704
00:49:32,053 --> 00:49:33,511
Sorry, Sarge.

705
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,597
l fucked up.

706
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,101
Forget it, kid. This guy's a serious asshole.

707
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:15,970
Give me all your money, bookworm,
or l blow your brains out.

708
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,062
Now fill it up on number 7.

709
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,445
Don't do nothing stupid, man.

710
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:35,949
l'm a good shot.

711
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,370
l could hit you in the eye from here.

712
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,676
Hey, man, what you readin' in there?

713
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:03,643
You a college boy or something?

714
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,231
l bet you think you're pretty smart?

715
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,942
Think you could outsmart a bullet?

716
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:13,236
What do you say we find out?

717
00:51:13,821 --> 00:51:15,822
l'm talking to you! What do you say?

718
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,200
l'm talking to you!

719
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,579
<i>Drop it.</i>

720
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,294
<i>Dead or alive, you are coming with me.</i>

721
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,799
l know you.

722
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,343
You're dead.

723
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:47,020
We killed you!

724
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,574
<i>You're dead.</i>

725
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,701
<i>We killed you!</i>

726
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:53,878
<i>Who are you?</i>

727
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,351
Jerry, Jerry. Look who it is.

728
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,144
Can l help you, sir?

729
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,982
<i>-No.</i>
-What is it exactly that you want?

730
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,945
You can't enter here! Wait a second!

731
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,613
Just a minute!

732
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,033
This is a restricted area!

733
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,501
He's in.

734
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:39,525
<i>Murphy, it's you.</i>

735
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,541
<i>Welcome, shopper.</i>

736
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,210
<i>Let's take a stroll through your new home.</i>

737
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,505
<i>This is a one-family house</i>
<i>built by ZEM lndustries.</i>

738
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,757
<i>Situated near schools</i>
<i>and shopping centers,</i>

739
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:48,261
<i>this progressive development</i>
<i>has a growth factor of 7.</i>

740
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,409
Wow.

741
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:14,287
Can you do that, Dad?

742
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,466
<i>...and, say, it doesn't matter</i>
<i>who cooks in your family,</i>

743
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:31,137
<i>because this kitchen by Food Concepts</i>
<i>makes everything a snap.</i>

744
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,158
Dad.

745
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,956
Come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

746
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,333
Get in the picture.

747
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,667
Come on, come on.

748
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,354
l really have to tell you something.

749
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,567
l love you.

750
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,658
<i>That's the master bedroom.</i>

751
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,912
<i>A functional space</i>
<i>with a touch of elegance.</i>

752
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,331
<i>Have you thought it all over?</i>

753
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,583
<i>Why not make me an offer?</i>

754
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,869
<i>Where is Clarence Boddicker?</i>

755
00:58:24,084 --> 00:58:25,084
Okay?

756
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,968
-Shit!
<i>-Let's talk.</i>

757
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,474
Son of a bitch!

758
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:47,440
There's just something
about the way it sounds.

759
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,401
Vice president.

760
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:53,237
lt just turns me on.

761
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,364
God, you girls are so great.

762
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,159
l mean l just...
l love to be with intelligent women.

763
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,745
Smart is so sexy.

764
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,622
l know.

765
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:05,249
Sometimes l could
just think of something,

766
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,462
and it could just get me so horny.

767
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,634
Yeah, well,
a mind is a terrible thing to waste.

768
00:59:14,718 --> 00:59:16,093
Yeah.

769
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,970
l get bored so easily.

770
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,556
Yep.

771
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,768
And you need lots of stimulation, Bobby.

772
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,731
-Yes, l do. Don't move.
-l won't.

773
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,319
Bob?

774
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:35,279
What?

775
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:38,866
-Bob, save some for me.
-Don't worry. l'll...

776
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,331
Must be the champagne. Stay here.

777
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,130
How you doing...

778
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,842
Bitches, leave.

779
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:01,514
Gee, Bobby. Bye.

780
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,017
-You gonna call me?
-Come on.

781
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:07,353
What the fuck are you doing?

782
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:09,146
Do you know who l am?

783
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:12,775
lf you think you're gonna
get away with this...

784
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,529
Goddamn it!

785
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:24,912
Stop! l'll give you anything you want!
Just please, please don't kill me, all right?

786
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:32,378
<i>Hello, buddy boy. Dick Jones here.</i>

787
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:37,633
<i>l guess you're on your knees about now,</i>
<i>begging for your life.</i>

788
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:40,469
<i>Pathetic.</i>

789
01:00:40,721 --> 01:00:43,264
<i>You don't feel so cocky now, do you, Bob?</i>

790
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:46,017
Whatever he's paying you,
l'll double it right now.

791
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,728
<i>You know what the tragedy is here, Bob?</i>

792
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,565
<i>We could have been friends.</i>

793
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,651
<i>But you wouldn't go</i>
<i>through proper channels.</i>

794
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,570
<i>You went over my head.</i>

795
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,656
<i>That hurt.</i>

796
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:05,995
<i>But life goes on. lt's an old story,</i>
<i>the fight for love and glory, huh, Bob?</i>

797
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,666
<i>lt helps if you think of it as a game, Bob.</i>

798
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:15,296
<i>Every game has a winner and a loser.</i>

799
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:27,266
<i>l'm cashing you out, Bob.</i>

800
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,617
We need more tubing.

801
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,333
l don't think l want to pay you that, Sal.

802
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:57,254
l don't give a shit what you want to pay.
l set the prices here.

803
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:01,384
Listen, pal, maybe you haven't heard.
l'm the guy in Old Detroit.

804
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,928
You want space in my marketplace,

805
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,806
you're gonna have
to give me a volume discount.

806
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,433
l'm not into discounts.

807
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:12,853
Joe, show the man
what we brought him for Christmas.

808
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,490
Think about it, chum.
Good business is where you find it.

809
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:33,999
Okay, let me try to put this in perspective.

810
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:37,420
You killed a bunch of cops.

811
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:42,383
The word around is that you've got
a lot of heavy connections downtown.

812
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,970
You make a lot of my friends nervous.

813
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:53,394
A lot of people
would love to see a guy like me

814
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,272
put a guy like you out of business.

815
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,650
l don't know. l don't know.

816
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,695
Maybe l'm just not making myself clear.

817
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,033
l don't want to fuck with you, Sal.

818
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,664
But l got the connections.
l got the sales organization.

819
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,251
l got the muscle
to shove enough of this factory

820
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:22,381
so far up your stupid wop ass
that you'll shit snow for a year.

821
01:03:22,466 --> 01:03:25,217
Frankie, blow this cocksucker's head off.

822
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,554
Guns, guns, guns!

823
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,433
Come on, Sal!

824
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:35,060
The Tigers are playing tonight.

825
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,731
l never miss a game.

826
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,030
Just kidding.

827
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,085
Go!

828
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:05,925
Go.

829
01:04:23,443 --> 01:04:27,112
<i>Come quietly or there will be trouble.</i>

830
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,324
Fuck you!

831
01:06:06,004 --> 01:06:10,007
<i>Clarence Boddicker, you are under arrest.</i>

832
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:12,009
<i>You have the right to remain silent.</i>

833
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,219
Fuck you!

834
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,645
Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!

835
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:24,980
l'm protected, man. l've got protection!

836
01:06:25,065 --> 01:06:26,607
<i>You have the right to an attorney.</i>

837
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,442
What is this shit?

838
01:06:32,906 --> 01:06:34,323
Goddamn it.

839
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,367
Goddamn it! Listen to me!

840
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:40,037
Listen to me, you fuck!
There's another guy.

841
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,831
He's OCP. He's a senior president.

842
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:46,543
<i>Anything you say</i>
<i>may be used against you.</i>

843
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,420
lt's Dick Jones!

844
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:56,220
Don't you get it? You cocksucker!

845
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,932
l work for Dick Jones. Dick Jones!

846
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:04,645
He's the number two guy at OCP.
OCP runs the cops!

847
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,940
You're a cop.

848
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,778
Cop.

849
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,749
<i>Yes. l am a cop.</i>

850
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:32,339
l don't like it any more
than you do, Reed, but listen!

851
01:07:32,424 --> 01:07:33,882
You listen to me, you asshole!

852
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:37,970
You're talking about shutting down
a major metropolitan police force.

853
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:41,223
Without cops,
this city would tear itself apart.

854
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:44,226
The Union thinks you should know
there was a strike vote last night.

855
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,978
We lost five guys last week.

856
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,021
We're getting creamed out there, Reed.

857
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:58,699
<i>Book him.</i>

858
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,492
What's the charge?

859
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,123
<i>He's a cop killer.</i>

860
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,006
Shit!

861
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:16,967
Just give me my fucking phone call.

862
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:25,851
l understand.

863
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,020
Look, the lawyers will
have you out in 24 hours.

864
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,938
Just don't say anything else.

865
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:33,192
Jesus, you really screwed up.

866
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,258
<i>Don't you get it? l work for Dick Jones!</i>

867
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,884
<i>Dick Jones!</i>

868
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,597
<i>l work for Dick Jones!</i>

869
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,934
<i>He runs OCP. OCP runs the cops.</i>

870
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,274
Come in, Officer.

871
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,943
You know, l don't usually see
anyone without an appointment,

872
01:09:57,986 --> 01:09:59,736
but in your case, l'll make an exception.

873
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:01,655
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

874
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:03,532
On what charge?

875
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,784
<i>Aiding and abetting a known felon.</i>

876
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,288
Sounds like l'm in a lot of trouble.

877
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,457
You better take me in.

878
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,792
<i>l will.</i>

879
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,016
What's the matter, Officer?

880
01:10:32,103 --> 01:10:34,479
l'll tell you what's the matter.

881
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,900
lt's a little insurance policy
called Directive 4.

882
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:41,320
My little contribution
to your psychological profile.

883
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:45,866
Any attempt to arrest
a senior officer of OCP

884
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,784
results in shutdown.

885
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,664
What did you think?

886
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,835
That you were an ordinary police officer?

887
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:58,629
You're our product.

888
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:02,966
And we can't very well have our products
turning against us, can we?

889
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:08,847
Still a little fight left in you.

890
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:17,105
Maybe you'd like to meet a friend of mine.

891
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:26,198
l had to kill Bob Morton
because he made a mistake.

892
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,825
Now it's time to erase that mistake.

893
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,150
Put Lieutenant Hedgecock on the line.
There's trouble in the tower!

894
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:56,139
<i>Prepare to fire.</i>

895
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,851
-Hey, wait a second!
-He's a cop, for God's sakes!

896
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:02,896
-Hedgecock! You can't do that!
-We have orders to destroy it.

897
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,357
-Oh, shit!
-You're maniacs!

898
01:14:05,483 --> 01:14:07,067
<i>Fire at will.</i>

899
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,753
<i>Move in.</i>

900
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:25,687
Murphy!

901
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:27,981
Murphy, it's me.

902
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:32,485
Lewis.

903
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:44,456
Move down!

904
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:46,082
On the next level.

905
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,211
Lieutenant!
Level 3, level 3. He's on level 3!

906
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,795
Over here! Over here!

907
01:15:50,838 --> 01:15:52,380
<i>Open fire!</i>

908
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:11,691
<i>lt's back.</i>

909
01:16:12,318 --> 01:16:15,153
<i>Big is back, because bigger is better.</i>

910
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,327
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>l'm Jesse Perkins with Casey Wong.</i>

911
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:24,371
<i>Top story, Santa Barbara.</i>

912
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,458
<i>10,000 acres of wooded residential land</i>
<i>were scorched in an instant</i>

913
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:32,170
<i>when a laser cannon aboard</i>
<i>the strategic defense peace platform</i>

914
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,756
<i>misfired today</i>
<i>during routine start-up tests.</i>

915
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:35,840
<i>Casey.</i>

916
01:16:35,883 --> 01:16:37,300
<i>Yes, it was a day of mourning</i>

917
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,595
<i>for the families of 1 13 people</i>
<i>known dead at this hour,</i>

918
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,973
<i>among them,</i>
<i>two former United States Presidents</i>

919
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:45,517
<i>who had retired in the Santa Barbara area.</i>

920
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,560
<i>A day of mourning for a country.</i>

921
01:16:47,728 --> 01:16:51,815
<i>Police union representatives and OCP</i>
<i>continue negotiations today</i>

922
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:55,277
<i>in hopes of averting a citywide strike</i>
<i>by police,</i>

923
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,988
<i>scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.</i>

924
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,823
<i>Justin Ballard-Watkins has more.</i>

925
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:02,867
<i>They're still on duty,</i>
<i>but what about tomorrow?</i>

926
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,329
<i>That's the question we put to people</i>
<i>in the crime-plagued Lexington area.</i>

927
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:09,499
<i>They're public servants.</i>
<i>They got job security.</i>

928
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,418
<i>They're not supposed to strike.</i>

929
01:17:11,502 --> 01:17:12,544
<i>lt's a free society,</i>

930
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:15,380
<i>except there ain't nothin' free</i>

931
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,215
<i>'cause there's no guarantees, you know?</i>

932
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:19,134
<i>You're on your own.</i>

933
01:17:19,218 --> 01:17:21,303
<i>lt's the law of the jungle.</i>

934
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:26,308
Be very careful.

935
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:27,726
Excuse me, please.

936
01:17:29,103 --> 01:17:31,563
They must be remodeling.

937
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:37,986
Hiya, Barbara.

938
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:42,073
Listen, l'm here to see Dick Jones.

939
01:17:42,575 --> 01:17:45,410
But when l'm done,
l've got some free time.

940
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:48,580
Maybe you could fit me in.

941
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,043
He's expecting you, Mr. Boddicker.

942
01:17:56,547 --> 01:17:57,964
You can keep the gum.

943
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:02,427
-This looks good.
-Get a measurement on that.

944
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,511
Bring a hammer, too.

945
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:07,891
Hey, Dickie boy. How's tricks?

946
01:18:08,267 --> 01:18:10,060
That thing is still alive.

947
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,187
l don't know what you're talking about.

948
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:15,607
The police officer who arrested you,
the one you spilled your guts to.

949
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,236
Take a look at my face, Dick.

950
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,281
He was trying to kill me.

951
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,325
He's a cyborg, you idiot.

952
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:29,120
He recorded every word you said.

953
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,915
His memory's admissible as evidence.

954
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,875
You involved me.

955
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,962
You're gonna have to kill it.

956
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,259
Listen, chief.

957
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:47,180
Your company built the fucking thing.

958
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,974
Now l got to deal with it?

959
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,936
l don't have time for this bullshit.

960
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:55,063
Suit yourself, Clarence.

961
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,565
But Delta City begins construction
in two months.

962
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,818
That's 2 million workers living in trailers.

963
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:04,197
That means drugs, gambling, prostitution.

964
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:09,202
Virgin territory for the man
who knows how to open up new markets.

965
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:12,122
One man could control it all,

966
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:14,124
Clarence.

967
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:18,002
l guess we're gonna be friends after all,

968
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,255
Richard.

969
01:19:27,805 --> 01:19:28,847
Destroy it.

970
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:33,184
Gonna need some major firepower.

971
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:37,856
You got access to military weaponry?

972
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,860
We practically are the military.

973
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,816
<i>Did you bring the gun?</i>

974
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:23,234
The precinct was deserted.

975
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,737
Half the force
didn't show up for work today.

976
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,822
Everyone else walks out at midnight.

977
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:29,532
l guess we're on strike.

978
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:33,244
l wasn't sure what you needed.
l sort of grabbed things.

979
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,207
Your gun.

980
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,418
You asked for this?

981
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:46,174
l brought you some food.

982
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,345
<i>No, thank you. l'm not hungry.</i>

983
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,704
<i>You may not like what you're going to see.</i>

984
01:21:51,156 --> 01:21:53,992
lt's really good to see you again, Murphy.

985
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:01,958
<i>Murphy had a wife and son.</i>
<i>What happened to them?</i>

986
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:06,754
After the funeral, she moved away.

987
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,756
<i>Where did they go?</i>

988
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:13,720
She thought you were dead.
She started over again.

989
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,516
<i>l can feel them.</i>

990
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,856
<i>But l can't remember them.</i>

991
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,196
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

992
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:22,372
<i>Happy birthday, Dave. She's from me.</i>

993
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:26,751
<i>Well, can l have you both?</i>

994
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:30,505
<i>-Sure. We've had our shots.</i>
<i>-Sure. We've had our shots.</i>

995
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:34,425
<i>l'd buy that for a dollar!</i>

996
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:41,766
Hey, Emil.

997
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,768
How's the Gray Bar Hotel?

998
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:46,187
Not bad. They let me keep the shirt.

999
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:47,605
Nobody popped my cherry.

1000
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,899
Emil, how you doing, man?
Good to see you.

1001
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:51,317
-Hey! Hey!
-Hey!

1002
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,277
First they let me out ofjail for free,

1003
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,155
then what do l find
in the prison parking lot

1004
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,616
but a brand new 6000 SUX.

1005
01:23:58,701 --> 01:24:00,618
Still got the factory sticker on it!

1006
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,286
Clarence.

1007
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:04,622
Joey's got a carjust like yours, man.

1008
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,251
Yo, Clarence, what do you think, buddy?

1009
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,050
What do you got there, Clarence?

1010
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:17,635
Wait up for me!

1011
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:21,764
Whoa! A new toy! Can l play?

1012
01:24:24,351 --> 01:24:25,810
Watch this.

1013
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,396
Wait... Wait a minute, Clarence, Clarence!

1014
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:31,607
Shit!

1015
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,153
What the fuck?

1016
01:24:35,237 --> 01:24:37,238
-Nice car, Joe.
-Fuck you, Clarence.

1017
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:38,322
Let me try that.

1018
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:42,326
Cobra Assault Cannon. State of the art.
Bang! Bang!

1019
01:24:49,334 --> 01:24:50,877
l like it!

1020
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,671
Give it up, faggot. Let a man...

1021
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,131
No, butthole! Get your own!

1022
01:24:55,174 --> 01:24:56,424
Come on!

1023
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,348
Get the other gun, Emil!

1024
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:07,477
No car is safe!

1025
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:08,686
Do it, Emil!

1026
01:25:16,028 --> 01:25:17,528
Heads up, you guys.

1027
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,040
He's in the steel mill. Let's go.

1028
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:32,251
All right, cut the horseshit!
We're moving out.

1029
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:34,712
Come on, Emil! Get your ass in the van!

1030
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:36,506
Come on, lard ass, let's move it!

1031
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,633
l'll get you, faggot!

1032
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:34,105
What are you doing?

1033
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,234
<i>My targeting system is a little messed up.</i>

1034
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,780
Can l help you?

1035
01:26:43,824 --> 01:26:45,199
<i>Aim for me.</i>

1036
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,879
Are you locked in now?

1037
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,005
Yes.

1038
01:27:00,424 --> 01:27:01,799
A little more to the left.

1039
01:27:02,718 --> 01:27:03,801
Here.

1040
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:14,020
l figure that's dead-on.

1041
01:27:14,104 --> 01:27:15,438
<i>Thank you.</i>

1042
01:27:33,415 --> 01:27:36,000
-All right. Let's do it.
-Come on, man, let's smoke him!

1043
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:41,297
The wrecking crew is here!
Where is that metallic mother?

1044
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:42,965
Zip it up, Emil!

1045
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:45,509
Nothing fancy. Just kill him.

1046
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,845
Emil, in the van.

1047
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:52,642
<i>You should get out of here now.</i>

1048
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,352
Hey, we're partners.

1049
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:56,812
<i>Get the car.</i>

1050
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,642
Damn it! Shit!

1051
01:28:34,726 --> 01:28:36,268
<i>Looking for me?</i>

1052
01:28:49,074 --> 01:28:51,033
Cut him off! Come on!

1053
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:52,660
Go on, cut him off!

1054
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:54,120
Go, go!

1055
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:28,446
Okay! Now l got you!

1056
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,410
Shit!

1057
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:32,343
Help me.

1058
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,345
Don't touch me, man!

1059
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,473
Help me.

1060
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,519
God!

1061
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:57,618
Shit!

1062
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,897
Bye-bye, baby.

1063
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:28,440
<i>Clarence!</i>

1064
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:55,467
Okay.

1065
01:31:56,136 --> 01:31:57,553
l give up.

1066
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,638
<i>l'm not arresting you anymore.</i>

1067
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,266
Now, wait a second.

1068
01:32:09,107 --> 01:32:10,608
Wait a minute.

1069
01:32:10,692 --> 01:32:12,902
You're taking this kind of personal,
aren't you?

1070
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:16,447
Come on, man. Come on, now.
You're making me nervous.

1071
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,157
Come on, you can't do this.

1072
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:20,201
Come on now! Don't mess around!

1073
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:22,369
Hey! Hey!

1074
01:32:22,579 --> 01:32:24,330
Come on, man, now, don't get cute!

1075
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:30,711
Die, you bastard!

1076
01:32:30,795 --> 01:32:31,837
Yeah!

1077
01:32:31,922 --> 01:32:33,672
Yeah! All right!

1078
01:32:34,049 --> 01:32:35,507
All right!

1079
01:32:35,675 --> 01:32:38,010
l got him, Clarence! l got him!

1080
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,207
Sayonara, Robocop!

1081
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:26,433
<i>Lewis!</i>

1082
01:33:29,771 --> 01:33:32,022
Murphy, l'm a mess!

1083
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,777
<i>They'll fix you.</i>

1084
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,488
<i>They fix everything.</i>

1085
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:51,375
The police strike could really work for us.

1086
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:54,753
By the end of the week, we can have
Ed 209s in place all over the city

1087
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,964
and expect immediate public support.

1088
01:33:57,048 --> 01:34:00,217
l've got one downstairs
guarding the building now.

1089
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:10,144
<i>You are illegally parked</i>
<i>on private property.</i>

<i>You have 20 seconds</i>
<i>to move your vehicle.</i>

1091
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,559
...because whatever happens,

1092
01:34:50,602 --> 01:34:53,854
this corporation will live up
to the guiding principles of its founder.

1093
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:57,441
Courage, strength, conviction.

1094
01:35:00,403 --> 01:35:05,282
We will meet each new challenge
with the same aggressive attitude.

1095
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,952
What is it?

1096
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:11,830
l don't know.

1097
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:16,710
How can we help you, Officer?

1098
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:19,296
<i>Dick Jones is wanted for murder.</i>

1099
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:24,176
This is absurd! That thing
is a violent mechanical psychopath.

1100
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:28,597
<i>My program will not allow me to act</i>
<i>against an officer of this company.</i>

1101
01:35:29,099 --> 01:35:31,809
These are serious charges.
What is your evidence?

1102
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:45,656
<i>l had to kill Bob Morton</i>
<i>because he made a mistake.</i>

1103
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:49,451
<i>Now it's time to erase that mistake.</i>

1104
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:53,914
<i>l had to kill Bob Morton</i>
<i>because he made a mistake.</i>

He's got a gun!

1107
01:36:00,046 --> 01:36:01,338
Get up!

1108

l want a chopper. Now!

1109
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:06,635
We will walk to the roof very calmly.

1110
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:09,805
l will board the chopper with my hostage.

1111
01:36:11,850 --> 01:36:13,851
Anybody tries to stop me,

1112
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:17,020
the old geezer gets it.

1113
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:22,025
Dick, you're fired!

1114
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:24,987
<i>Thank you.</i>

1115
01:36:50,346 --> 01:36:52,931
Nice shooting, son. What's your name?
