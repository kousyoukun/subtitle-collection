The scroll has been scattered to every corner of the universe.

We'd refugees wherever we go, and still, we came into these negotiations in good faith.

I perhaps more than anyone understand what you and your people have been through.

After my predecessor was destroyed, heretics rose up to fill the void.

I hope we can rebuild together so much so that I'm willing to put our ancient animosities behind us.

103
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
And give you a chance to protect your people.

104
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
To stop running.

105
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The scroll will take their rightful place in the Kree Empire.

106
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
And I will aid in a relocation.

To create jury rigged up wormhole on MB418.

127
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You mean like a jump point?

128
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know, but I touched it and then I...

129
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Why'd you do that?

130
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Because it was glowing and mysterious.

131
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay, no room. No more touching shit. Especially glowy, mysterious shit.

132
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of negative energy for me and I don't like it. That's not the point.

133
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The point is that it was siphoning off the atmosphere and it entered.

134
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's Scylla's big paper.

135

I see that you finally found yourself a team.

It is unintentional.

I go by Miss Marvel and I hope that's okay.

342
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Like copyright wise, because honestly,

343
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
I never thought I'd ever get to meet even though it's happening.

You need to stop calling me that.

352
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I used to change your diapers.

353
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Oh, that was once, and then I was told you proceeded to vomit everywhere.

354
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
First of all, it's my ship, so I make the game plan.

355
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Sorry, when's the last time you let a team?

356
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
As early as last week.

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Goose doesn't count.

359
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000

No, no, no, no. We're not.

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
It's a lot of team.

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City,

363
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
am on a team with Captain Marvel and Captain Monica Rambo,

364
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
who from this point on, will now be known as

365
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Professor Marvel.

366
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Professor Marvel.

367
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
No, no, no, she will not.

368
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Thank you.

369
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Now that we've got that out of the way team,

370
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
I've been trying to tell you,

371
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think I know how she's making the weird jump points.

372
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
She is one of these.

373
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's my known as Bangal.

374
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
It started glowing really weirdly when

375
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Darvon opened that first jump point.

376
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Also, it once traveled me through space and times.

377
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's probably related.

378
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What you're describing is a quantum band.

379
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

380
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I just did not expect the other one to be in space.

381
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
They're a pair?

382
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
How do you have a quantum band?

383
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Okay, what is a quantum band?

384
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
A myth, or I thought it was a myth.

385
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
It's an ancient artifact.

386
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
So this is what Darvon found on MB418.

387
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And then her and her homologists happened to stumble into each other.

388
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
What are the chances?

389
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
What you seek is seeking you.

390
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's inscribed on the Bangal.

391
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
If the Kree legends are true,

392
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
the quantum bands were used to create every jump point in the universe.

393
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Teleportation network.

394
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Two quantum bands working in unison to connect the galaxy.

395
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Should that would explain our switchy and tangled in situation?

396
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Yeah, yeah, but Darvon only has one.

397
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
She must be overloading it with the energy from her space hammer thingy.

398
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
It's called the universal weapon.

399
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, really?

400
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
That's gonna call it Cosmobot.

401
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Either way, she's using it to force unstable jump points into the grid.

402
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We have got to get to her before she makes another one.

403
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
She had star charts and maps on the screens in her ship.

404
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Okay.

405
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
To where?

406
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
To the stars.

407
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Okay.

408
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
It's fine.

409
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
We've got a plan.

410
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We will use this as a scroll torture device.

411
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
We will put it on our hands.

412
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Yes, it's fine.

413
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You use it to access memories.

414
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I've been using it to bring in the memories that the Kree took from me.

415
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
So, yeah, but you know, it has a lot of other uses.

416
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's safe.

417
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
You might want to get comfortable.

418
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Wow.

419
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
This is weird.

420
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Wait, go back.

421
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Her band absorbs your energy and redirects it.

422
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's like, gave her power to lose against you.

423
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Come on.

424
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
What about this?

425
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
There.

426
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
That's coordinates.

427
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Can you read that?

428
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yes.

429
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
The Magellanic Galaxy.

430
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Okay.

431
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm gonna go back to the ship.

432
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,000
What about this?

433
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Okay.

434
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I'm gonna go back to the ship.

435
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I just want to come around.

436
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,000
The cancer's back.

437
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
So, I need you to take care of this.

438
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
No.

439
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
What do you mean no?

440
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
No, I mean you beat it once, you'll beat it again.

441
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Kill?

442
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm not taking the cat.

443
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
It's not a cat.

444
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
It should have been you that day.

445
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
That stupid race to the hangar.

446
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I never wanted to be kept a mole for you.

447
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You kept a mole so it's me who's just lying.

448
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,000
It isn't just a mole if it gets back.

449
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
She's a bit...

450
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Carol, I don't want to relive this.

451
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Stop now, please.

453
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Carol, I'm gonna go find a mole.

454
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

455
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

456
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

457
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

458
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

459
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

460
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

461
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

462
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

463
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

464
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

465
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I'm gonna go find a mole.

466
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
She died.

467
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
She died.

468
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
She died.

469
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
No.

470
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Never do that again.

471
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It wasn't on purpose.

473
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
It's your mom.

474
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Passed away while I was at work.

475
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
When I came back, no one was there.

476
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Okay.

477
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Okay.

478
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Thank you.

479
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
She seemed really cool.

480
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
She was.

482
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
She was the best.

483
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Well, we have to make do with what we know right now.

484
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Here is what we do now.

485
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
The Universal Neural Teleportation Network

486
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
is a system of wormholes through the space-time continuum,

487
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
aka jump points,

488
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
which allows us to hop between different planetary systems.

489
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Basically, it stretches and reconfigures space

490
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
without rupturing the continuum.

491
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Like fracking, the more holes you drill,

492
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the more destabilized the shell becomes,

493
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
and then earthic.

494
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Bottom line, if she keeps creating these jump points,

495
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
it's gonna get really bad really fast.

496
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The question is, what does she want?

497
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Cree,

498
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
so maybe the attack was a warning.

499
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
So she could be after another former colony.

500
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Is there a former Cree colony in the Magellanic?

501
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
At one point, the Cree colony is 25% of the Calyx.

502
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax,

503
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
why not bring in an armory of a bomb or something?

504
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Why a jump point?

505
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,000
You're right.

506
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Jump points aren't weapons.

507
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They're means of transportation.

508
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Every jump point has two sides,

509
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
so if Tarnax's atmosphere was siphoned away,

510
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
it had to go somewhere or...

511
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Hall of...

512
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The Cree Civil War basically bankrupted Hall of its natural resources.

513
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The air is barely breathable.

514
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
They're suffering from a drought.

515
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,000
A drought?

516
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
So she could be after water next.

517
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Okay, we're in the Magellanic.

518
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Can we find...

519
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Oh, bad, nah.

520
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

521
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What is the Cree specific step?

522
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
You've been there.

523
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Yeah.

524
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Is that really weird?

525
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, why have you been weird?

526
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Okay, consensus on Eladna.

527
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Aye.

528
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Yeah, I said we do it.

529
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Get to Eladna and separate Durbin from the Bengal.

530
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
We have already.

531
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Kamala, you are not going on any space adventures.

532
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Nicholas has told me how dangerous they can be.

533
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
It's just fury.

534
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
God.

535
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Wait, where are you guys?

536
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Raise up a...

537
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
(Speaking in foreign language)

538
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So that means on the delt?

539
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Really fury.

540
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
They insisted and your dad is not adjusting very well to space travel.

541
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Hey, Bags, I'm in this crazy space elevator and we're going up or...

542
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Maybe we're going down.

543
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Are there directions in space?

544
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Yes, there are, but no filming.

545
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh.

546
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
(Music)

547
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Come on.

548
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,000
(Music)

549
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Fury, everything okay?

550
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You've had another series.

551
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Reports are coming in and crossing the network.

552
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
It seems everyone's been affected.

553
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Well, we need to stop them from making another one and we can't risk intergalactic bodies while being in the meantime.

554
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm sorry, but your daughter will have to stay aboard my ship.

555
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Oh no.

556
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Until we get to the bottom of this.

557
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Tian.

558
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
You wouldn't have to go.

559
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Mrs. Khan, it is not that simple.

560
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
We need Kamala.

561
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I mean, we found out these other bangle nurses.

562
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Where they bangle, we're kind of terrifying women using the other one of her people and we have to stop her.

563
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You're telling me there's another bangle and they're going to use that bangle to hurt you.

564
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Myra, go take care of her.

565
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We will and we will make sure she gets back home in one piece.

566
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I promise.

567
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Stay the course. They will figure out how to close those jump points.

568
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Kamala, you listen to me.

569
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
If anything happens to you, may I ask you John Lelungi, you tell her that.

570
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I love you, Renta.

571
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Love you more.

572
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Wait, what did you just say?

573
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Nobody cares for the captive Marvel and nobody gets no grief for it.

574
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Trust me, Kamala is in good hands with Carol.

575
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
What's wrong with that cat?

576
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
It's acting very weird.

577
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Also, Mr. Fury, she's looking like a pudgy.

578
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I think you're over-seating her.

579
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Goals.

580
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Go.

581
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Firefly, nightlight, Countess Marvel,

582
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Mistress Marvel, Doctor Marvel, Doctor Bright.

583
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Doctor Bright, Professor Marvel, Nova, Supernova Girls,

584
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Spectrum Spectrum Vision, oh wait, no, sorry.

585
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
How many times do I have to tell you guys I do not want or need a code name?

586
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,000
Besides, none of it matters if we're not coordinated out there.

587
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Want to figure out what you think?

588
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,000
Power State activated after a switch. Good to know.

589
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Okay, everyone together on three.

590
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Ready? One, two, one, go.

591
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Now what would you say go?

592
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Go on down three, come on, where?

593
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:08,000
She's getting on.

594
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Now, can you hold on for a second?

595
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

596
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Now, go down three, seven, eight.

597
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And you go left.

598
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That's why you want to invest in index funds rather than in individual stocks.

599
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Of course, both the Roth IRA and 401K are important for tax purposes.

600
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
I know, I know that you're full of upland for a time.

601

Hey, it's never too late.

602
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
And it's never too early like I said.

603
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, late, eleven-six.

604
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Wow, same age.

605
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
What's that?

606
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
It's 401K.

607
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
It's 401K.

608
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Sweet Valtteri.

609
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Don't touch it.

610
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
What is it?

611
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
I have a foggiest idea.

612
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Have it again then.

613
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
I don't know.

614
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Who?

615
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Schubert-Holtfuhrer.

616
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Twenty seconds to the jump point.

617
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Do you guys realize how crazy this is right now?

618
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I'm in a spaceship with two superpowers.

619
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Also, it's too late to go to the bathroom because I feel like it's going to hit really soon.

620
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,000
No one would believe me.

621
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Like my Nokia, she would never believe me.

What the hell is that?

647
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:50,140
I should warn you that I'm kind of famous here.

Well, you do know you're famous everywhere, right?

This one's kind of different.

650
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,140
I helped the prince with the legal issue.

No matter what, follow my lead.

So that's what you meant when you said legal issue.

684
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,140
It is a marriage of convenience.

685
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,140
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

This will work, yeah.

Remember, we want to keep unintentional switching to a minimum.

00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,140
Entertainer as long as you possibly can.

I've come here to pardon you for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

Neil.

I will never, Neil.

One, two.

01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,140
Don't do this.

Supremar, did you get this me in the mail?

803
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,140
Get it to the corridor.

804
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,140
Right.

The space elevator's offline.

No, I can lose her.

And what about the other 20 ships?

833
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:49,140

We left Aladdin to fend for themselves.

01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:43,140
Darman was going to get my bangles, so I made a tough call like you did on Carter.

841
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:44,140
I tried to be like me.

842
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,140
I messed this whole thing up.

843
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:49,140
If we weren't entangled, if we weren't here, then you could have beat Darman.

844
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:50,140
And I'm sorry.

846
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,140
No, you don't understand.

847
01:07:55,140 --> 01:08:00,140
The Kree had been ruled by an AI for a millennia that led them into a war.

848
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:04,140
I thought the only way to stop it was to destroy it.

849
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:09,140
But I just made it worse.

850
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:12,140
I'm the reason why the civil war started in the first place.

851
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:15,140
I'm the reason why I couldn't breathe the air.

852
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,140
That's how I got the name Reniolator.

853
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:25,140
And I never wanted you to see that version of me.

854
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,140
Because how I never came back.

855
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:33,140
I thought if I fixed it, then I could come home.

856
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:36,140
Carol.

857
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:39,140
This is not how family works.

I never expected you to be the mighty Captain Marvel.

859
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,140
I just wanted you.

860
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,140
Not mine.

I hope that goes without saying.

And I am sorry for coming out too strong at the beginning.

867
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,140
I did not give you lots of space to be a real person.

869
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,140
I have to find her.

01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,140
She could be anywhere in hell.

871
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,140
Not anywhere.

872
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:35,140
She's targeting the people that I care about and stealing resources from every place I call home.

873
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:37,140
We have to walk here.

This is an emergency.

All state personnel must report to evacuation off in the area.

877
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:52,140
You only have one evacuation per hour left.

878
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,140
The crews always have left to evacuate 350 personnel on 15 escape routes.

879
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,140
We see 5, 10 increase speed. There's no one there enough.

880
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,140
Well fill the remaining ones as many people as you can.

881
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,140

We lost contact with her.

No, no, no! That's the plan.

That's the plan?

01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:04,140
It's much easier to transport a family of cats than hundreds of crew members.

01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,140
You think it's wise taking that bangle to the bad guy?

950
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:28,140
Yes, Mr. Erie.

951
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:29,140
So I give it to me.

952
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:30,140
I will take it home.

953
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:34,140
Darvins opened another jump point and we're going to need both bangles to close it.

954
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:38,140
I guess you better make that shoe or she doesn't get her hands on it.

955
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,140
Understood.

957
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,140
Mr. Erie, you are going in the wrong direction.

958
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:03,140
Mr. Erie, I know.

959
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:13,140
[music]

960
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,140
Are you worried?

961
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,140
No, stop.

962
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:17,140
We know that we can get it out of here.

963
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:22,140

964
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:23,140
It's a beauty.

There she is.

972
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,140
We are now in the house.

973
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,140
It's over, Darvins.

974
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,140
No, not yet.

975
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,140
I know that you would do anything to protect Hala.

976
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,140
This will be the end of the creed.

977
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:31,140
It will be the end of everything.

978
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:32,140
You took her in.

979
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:34,140
You simply were paying the favor.

980
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,140
Now, give me the band.

981
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:41,140
You're forgetting something.

982
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:42,140
What?

983
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,140
Me.

984
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:57,140
[music]

985
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,140
This is killing me so much.

986
01:17:59,140 --> 01:18:00,140
Oh, jeez you.

987
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:01,140
I don't know.

988
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:03,140
I like her words.

You're living up to your name again.

997
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,140
I didn't want this.

998
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,140
This seems to be the point.

999
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:38,140
[music]

1000
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:40,140
It doesn't have to end like this, Darvins.

1001
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:41,140
Please just give us the bangles.

1002
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:42,140
I want it!

1003
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:46,140
Hala's son died because of you.

1004
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:48,140
Why shouldn't you repay us?

1005
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:51,140
Maybe she should.

1006
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:56,140
The reaction in your son's core has slowed.

1007
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,140
It needs an incredible amount of energy to jump-start it,

1008
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:00,140
and that's what you have, Carol.

1009
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:04,140
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1010
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:07,140
I've never done anything like that before.

1011
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:08,140
In the last couple of days,

1012
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:11,140
I have done a lot of things I have never done before.

1013
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:13,140
Your parents.

1014
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:20,140
For Hala.

[music]

1016
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,140
If you're trying to kill my father, then you can live.

[music]

1018
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,140
You won't survive this, Darvins.

1019
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,140
You'll survive.

1020
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:42,140

1023
01:22:00,140 --> 01:22:01,140
Are you okay?

1024
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,140
Yeah.

1025
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:06,140
I didn't touch you.

1026
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:08,140
One, two, three.

1027
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:34,140
[music]

1028
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,140
It's so close. You're okay.

1029
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:39,140
You're going to the angles.

1030
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:42,140
You're going to need those.

1031
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:52,140
[music]

1032
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,140
So what are we looking at?

1033
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:57,140
Self-propagating singularity with negative mass

1034
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,140
and non-Newtonian topology.

1035
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:04,140
She tore a hole in space-time.

1036
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:10,140
That is a different reality, bleeding in towers.

1037
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,140
You can't even fix that in theory.

1038
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:16,140
You and Carol can reproduce the same amount of energy that was used to open it.

1039
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:19,140
I will absorb it and then release it, but from inside the tear.

1040
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,140
But what about the switching?

1041
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:24,140
Where power's not entangled anymore.

1042
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,140
Oh.

1043
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:29,140
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1044
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:34,140
But wait, you want us to blast you with the same amount of power

1045
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:37,140
that punched a hole in the fabric of space-time?

1046
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:41,140
If we want to un-punch it, yeah.

1047
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,140
I want to get back here.

1048
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,140
I even need this.

01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:56,140
How are you feeling, Carol?

1051
01:23:56,140 --> 01:24:00,140
These bangles probably take some time to find me.

1052
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,140
It's fine for this.

1053
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:10,140
It has to be there.

1054
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:15,140
Miss Moa.

Higher further faster.

It's closing, Monica. We gotta get out of here.

I can't leave, Carol.

01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:04,140
What do you mean?

01:26:04,140 --> 01:26:05,140
I can't leave.

1067
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,140
I have to finish the job.

1068
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,140
Monica, it's perfectly trapped.

Our base, the planets who respected the microphone recovery,

and the team of scientists who set the habit of trying out their people.

1098

That's what it meant.

1100
01:30:19,140 --> 01:30:23,140
This is kitchen, but there are all these hot sauce packets,

1101
01:30:23,140 --> 01:30:29,140
and then there's this very bizarre looking tray, which I will say is a very good quality though.

1102
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,140
You can keep it.

Oh no, no, Carol, you can't keep it.

1104

Oh yeah, yeah, of course you can.

1105
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:38,140
The vastness of it just gives you a whole new perspective on mind.

Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

Yeah.

Which got me thinking.

1138
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:19,140
Can I help you?

1139
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,140
Kate Bishop.

[music]

1141
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:27,140
Did you think you were the only kid superhero in the world?

1142
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:29,140
23.

1143
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:30,140
Oh, I know.

1144
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,140
I've been reading up on you.

1145
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:34,140
Where did you get that?

1146
01:32:34,140 --> 01:32:36,140
I thought I had my couch.

1147
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:37,140
Okay.

1148
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:40,140
You've just become part of a much larger universe.

1149
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:44,140
Which at the moment is just me, mostly.

1150
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:45,140
I do have feelings for them.

1151
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,140
Did you know Amit had a daughter?

1152
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,140
What do you want?

1153
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:49,140
I'm putting together a table.

1154
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,140
And I want you on it.

1156
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:59,140
Please.

1177
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:17,140
I missed you so much.

1178
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:19,140
I'm so sorry.

1179

[music]

1180
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:26,140
I was on a mysterious visitor.

1181
01:36:26,140 --> 01:36:29,140
She seemed a little disoriented.

1182
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:31,140
Where are we?

1183
01:36:31,140 --> 01:36:32,140
What happened?

1184
01:36:32,140 --> 01:36:35,140
We were hoping you could tell us.

1185
01:36:35,140 --> 01:36:37,140
All we know is that binary found.

1186
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:42,140
Matthew, you somehow crossed through the tear in space-time.

1187
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:45,140
You are now in reality parallel to your own.

1188
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:51,140
Which is, of course, impossible.

1189
01:36:51,140 --> 01:36:53,140
You think that may be a confusion happening?

1190
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:58,140
Confusion is but the first step on the journey to knowledge.

1191
01:36:58,140 --> 01:36:59,140
I'll take it from you.

1192
01:36:59,140 --> 01:37:02,140
Trials are asked for an update.

1193
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,140
I'll combine and check on you later.

1195
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:18,140
Who are you?

1196
01:37:18,140 --> 01:37:23,140
Oh, shit.

1198
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,140
Yo.
