1
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,700
It has to be back to the beginning.
Is that what he's doing?

2
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,020
Yes, yes.

3
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,620
Good.

4
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,340
One thing I have to
know before we start.

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,900
When did you meet him?

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,420
Back then?

7
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,700
In 1963 you're talking about.
What did you make of him?

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,820
We didn't. We didn't meet him.

9
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,140
He was in England,
we were in New Jersey.

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,980
Wait a minute…

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,340
We didn't even know he existed.
Did we know he existed?

12
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,380
We had no idea who he was,
Stephen Hawking. Who's he?

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,300
- Fifteen years ago Bob.
- Can you believe it?
- Time flies, huh...

14
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,900
There was no beginning of the universe.

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,660
Past, present, future, the universe has always existed,
and it always will.

16
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,900
- Stephen?
- It stays the same.

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,300
Stephen?!

18
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,540
What is it?

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,060
What is it??

20
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,500
OK wait, how long we got here?

21
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,100
I don't wanna be late, Arno Penzias was
late for his Nobel Prize? I don't think so.

22
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,300
- Are we filming now?
- Yes.

23
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:21,180
I swear to you, that this is the most profound thing
you will hear in your entire life.

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,420
The sound or the story?

25
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,220
The sound or the story?

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,940
What's the difference?

27
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,820
There you are. Your mother sent me to find you.

28
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:54,380
--a new matter, which is being created to replace old matter,
this process has always existed and will continue forever.

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,260
Nothing changes,
nothing has ever changed.

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,140
It's my theory.

31
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,620
And I've given it a name.

32
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,260
I've called it "steady state".

33
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,420
- Good night.
- Good night professor Hoyle.

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,900
That's  Hoyle?

35
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,100
That's  Hoyle.

36
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,180
- Hello.
- Hello. Who are you?

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,500
I'm Jane Wilde.

38
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,100
- We haven't, have we?
- No.

39
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm a friend of Stephen's.

40
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,500
We met at another party and
he invited me to this party.

41
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,620
Isobel!

42
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,740
Hello.

43
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,340
- How are you?
- Fine.

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,540
Good. You?

45
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,100
- I'm still fine, thanks!
- Sorry.

46
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,980
Your um….your...

47
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,900
Oh no, thanks. Thank you very much.

48
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,580
- Oh, they're a terrible fiddle, aren't they.
- Yes. Terrible.

49
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
Thanks.

50
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,220
Stephen!

51
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,220
It's a party. People might want to dance.
You can't dance to Wagner.

52
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,980
To Stephen!

53
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,700
Happy birthday.

54
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,300
- Should we go outside?
- What?

55
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,140
It makes me feel...small. Very small.

56
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,020
All that out there. Us, here.

57
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,180
Don't worry.  Galileo was wrong.
St. Albans is absolutely the centre of the universe.

58
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,700
- Galileo died, 321 years ago today.
- On your birthday?

59
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,020
Changed the way we
thought about everything.

60
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,700
People are frightened of change.

61
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,300
My father and I used to come out here
in the middle of the night to look at stars.

62
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,900
I actually saw a star die once.

63
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:07,300
Course it actually happened about 200 000 years ago,
but the news didn't reach St. Albans until 1956 - light's fast, but it isn't that fast.

64
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,060
Sorry. Physics.

65
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,180
They're all so far away.
But they don't seem it, I mean,

66
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,340
you feel like you might stretch and reach
and you might just touch them.

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,660
Better hurry up with your stretching and reaching
because they're getting further away.

68
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,700
What?

69
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,140
The galaxy is moving away from us.

70
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,100
The closer ones at about six million miles an hour
and the distant ones at about two hundred million miles an hour.

71
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,380
I believe in God.

72
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,980
- Oh sorry, I just wanted to say it, I don't know why.
- It's alright.

73
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,460
You said you felt small. Does God make you feel less small?

74
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,980
There's nothing wrong with feeling in science, feeling matters.
All the best ideas are felt and argued about later.

75
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,900
Einstein said he could feel in his little finger
if an idea was right.

76
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,180
- So you're in good company. And you like Wagner.
- Actually...

77
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,500
- No, I don't. I think he's ...
- What?

78
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,820
Pompous. And ridiculous.

79
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,940
- Who do you like then?
- Rachmaninoff.

80
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,620
- What?
- Nothing.

81
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,180
Brahms?

82
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,700
- Stephen?
- I didn't say anything.

83
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,900
- The Beatles.
- Who?

84
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,780
- Nevermind.
- Jane?

85
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,300
Yes?

86
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,260
- Please, please me.
- What?

87
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,700
Love me, do.

88
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
We should go in.

89
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,820
- I can't get up.
- Come on.

90
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,900
- I can't!
- Very funny!

91
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,460
I can't get up Jane!

92
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
I'll go and get help.

93
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,380
Hello? Jane? Hello? Can you hear me?

94
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,700
- What's wrong with you?
- I can't get up.

95
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Well, give me your hand.

96
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,220
- Will it hurt?
- The truth? Yes.

97
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,940
A little bit more.

98
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,900
That's good. Now hold, hold still.

99
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,700
This might be a little bit more uncomfortable.

100
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,020
- How old are you Stephen?
- I'm 21.

101
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,220
- How old are You?
- I'm older than you.

102
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,500
- How much older?
- I'm 33.

103
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,380
Same age as Marilyn Monroe in Some like it hot.

104
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,500
And what do you do?

105
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,100
Oh no, wait let me guess. Umm, insurance salesman?
Or banking maybe?

106
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
- I'm a…I'm a cosmologist.
- Oh, good for you!

107
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,380
Just started my PhD.

108
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,700
Or rather I've just started to think about
what my PhD might be.

109
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,220
Now this will take about five minutes.

110
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,540
Sometimes it helps to talk about something completely different.

111
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,300
To take your mind off all this.

112
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,700
And then your time suspended in space will pass more quickly.

113
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,180
- Time and space do not exist independently of each other.
- Is that so?

114
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,780
Or the universe.

115
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,780
Really?

116
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,700
Matter and energy in the universe warp and distort space-time.

117
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Space-time's curved.

118
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,700
Hello?

119
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,900
No. No, we don't know.

120
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,460
Lots of tests.

121
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,700
Yes he is. Goodbye.

122
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,340
- Who was it?
- The girl from the party.

123
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:35,220
The x-ray of your spine with the dye in shows
that you don't have anything pressing on your spinal cord.

124
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,220
- That's good isn't it?
- It's a process of elimination.

125
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,220
You were a team.

126
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,060
I mean you're both getting the Nobel Prize this evening.

127
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,900
I put him up for the job.

128
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,540
And they wouldn't let me in on an interview.

129
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,820
So I loitered around.

130
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,380
And when Bob and the interview committee came out
doing their handshakes

131
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,700
and thank you for coming and we'll let you know, I moved in.

132
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,780
You gave him the job, right?
You gave Bob the job, didn't you?

133
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,460
There was this kind of embarrassed pause,
so I told them straight.

134
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,820
Bob and I are gonna walk down the corridor right here
and right out that door right there.

135
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,420
And if you don't want Bob to have a job that he was born to do,
then you call it before we go through that door.

136
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,940
- Longest walk of my life.
- Sixty two paces.

137
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,740
And we never looked back.

138
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,700
- They won't tell me what they're thinking.
- Doctors don't.

139
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,100
- They don't know themselves yet.
- I'm a doctor, Isobel, I know what they're like.

140
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,260
- You're tropical disease expert, dad.
- I know doctors!

141
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,900
- What Isobel?
- Nothing.

142
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,300
I'll arrange for you to have a private room.

143
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,700
No.

144
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,020
I'll stay on the ward like everyone else.

145
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,940
So, have you applied for Oxford or Cambridge?

146
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,980
They don't want me.

147
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,100
I was thinking of Westfield.

148
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,180
It's an all ladies college.

149
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,020
On the Burton model, I suppose.

150
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,780
And..and it's quite…

151
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,660
Scrabble. Let's play scrabble.

152
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,020
Leukaemia.

153
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,300
He's twelve.

154
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,020
It was beautiful.

155
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,820
I came out of the woods and there it was.
A perfect piece of equipment.

156
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,060
The antenna.

157
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,500
A great big horn like a gramophone horn
lying on its side.

158
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,820
The size of a house.

159
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,580
In the middle of a field, on a hill,
20 miles out of New York City.

160
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,860
- Picking up the hiss.
- Pointing at the stars.

161
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,220
And picking up the hiss.

162
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,300
And at the first time I saw that horn,
you know what?

163
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,300
- Well, they flew right out of her.
- Who?

164
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,260
The pigeons.

165
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,460
The twenty foot horn had a couple of pigeons living inside it.

166
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,100
- Pigeons?
- Pigeons!

167
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,820
What was it for, the 20 foot horn?
Apart from pigeon nesting.

168
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,140
We wanted to measure noise
from the outer edges of the Milky Way.

169
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,860
- Arno built a cold load.
- What's that?

170
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,620
- Five imperial gallons of liquid helium.
- You know how much helium that is?

171
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,060
It's a hell of a quantity of helium.

172
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,460
Gives you an unbelievably accurate reference
against which you can measure the noise you receive.

173
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,700
Arno was very precise.
He makes these things better than anyone.

174
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,540
- Maybe it's the German in me.
- You're German?

175
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,420
First six years of my life and a big chunk
of my temperament.

176
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,580
Bob made a great switch.

177
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,260
To connect the receiver alternately to the antenna
and the cold load reference.

178
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,900
Were you born in Germany?

179
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,660
- When? The 1940's?
- No. 1930's.

180
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,500
Noise is heat.

181
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,180
The higher the heat the more intense the noise.

182
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,460
You may wanna ask, did we get noise?

183
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,420
We got a lot of noise. Which means a lot of heat.

184
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,420
Far more than a Milky Way should have given us.

185
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,500
That was our work from then on in.

186
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,020
Day after day, what's all this heat?
What the hell is this hiss?!

187
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,900
Died in the night, poor lamb.

188
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,020
What's happening to me?

189
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,540
- Usually, I would sit down with the patient and his family…
- Please.

190
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,900
Motor neurone disease.

191
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,700
What, what is it, what happens?

192
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,380
Motor neurones in the brain,
which signal movement, they are dying.

193
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,340
So?

194
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:54,900
The brain stops telling muscles to move, the signal's not sent,
the muscles are not used, so they waste away slowly.

195
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,460
- How slowly?
- Muscle wastage causes immobility.

196
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:05,100
- How slowly?
- It's gradual paralysis.

197
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,780
And then, then what?

198
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,580
The respiratory muscles unlike most other muscles,
work automatically.

199
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,700
- Breathing.
- Yes. They don't waste away so quickly.

200
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,180
- But they do, they do waste away.
- Yes.

201
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,180
So what, I won't be able to breathe properly?

202
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,940
Or I won't be able to breathe at all,
something like, um, drowning?

203
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,100
What about the brain, I mean the brain itself?

204
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,700
Untouched.

205
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,700
The brain is left untouched.

206
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,060
He's young, that'll work in his favour.

207
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,780
Frank?

208
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:07,660
I remember when he was about eight years old
and we were in the garden with a telescope.

209
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,500
And Stephen said to me:
where do stars come from?

210
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,180
I didn't know the answer.

211
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,220
And you called him into bed and...

212
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,820
...he wanted to know the answer to his question very badly.

213
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,340
And I said not to worry,
I'd find out for him.

214
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,820
I never did.

215
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:46,700
- You've never been a sentimental man, Frank.
- No.

216
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,700
- I don't think we can afford for you to start now.
- I looked it up.

217
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,820
The younger you are when you get motor neurone disease,
the quicker the deterioration.

218
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Being young is a…

219
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,780
...is a bad thing Isobel.

220
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,140
Two years probably, no more.

221
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,700
- Then we must support him.
- Yes.

222
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,860
You do it by carrying on!

223
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,100
You do it, by living and carrying on!

224
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,420
He's going back to Cambridge, to his life.

225
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,300
- Do you know what Hoyle says?
- What?

226
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,220
If you could drive the car straight upwards,
you'd reach space in half an hour.

227
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:42,340
How long to drive around the Milky Way?

228
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,820
You multiply the diameter of the galaxy
by the distance of one light year.

229
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,380
- Easy.
- The calculation?

230
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,860
The car. Just been to India and back, remember?

231
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,820
- How long does it take to complete a PhD?
- Depends on the subject.

232
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,340
- With the fair-wind?
- With the fair-wind and a good brain, two years.

233
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,860
- What's the name of your supervisor?
- Sciama. Dennis Sciama.

234
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:19,380
5 869 713,6 million miles - around the Milky Way.

235
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,980
The heat we were receiving from out there,
should have been two degrees colder than the cold load, the reference.

236
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,460
- But it was hotter, three degrees hotter.
- Hotter than the Milky Way could produce.

237
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,460
Hotter than the sum of all the galaxies beyond.
So we think..

238
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,300
It had to be something closer to home.

239
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,820
We had an idea. Was that you who had the idea?

240
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:43,700
I don't remember. Oh we had a whole laundry list of ideas.
Maybe it was me. Maybe it was you.

241
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,700
You were a team.

242
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:48,580
- Maybe it was me.
- What was the idea?

243
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,060
There was some high-altitude bomb testing back in the 50's.
Maybe it's the leftover radiation, maybe our hiss is fallout.

244
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,620
But it would've diminished over the time
and what we were getting…

245
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,540
- Totally constant. No diminishing.
- Back to the laundry list.

246
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,700
Sciama.

247
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,180
Dennis, yes.

248
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,900
I don't know. S-H-A-R-M-A?

249
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,540
Um, I think it's Italian.

250
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,700
Dennis Sciama?

251
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,180
- Yes?
- Frank Hawking.

252
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,700
Hello, young man.

253
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,900
- Do I know you?
- Stephen Hawking.

254
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,340
- I applied for you to supervise my PhD.
- Too busy was I?

255
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,900
Yes I think so.

256
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,100
- Brains, balls and cash.
- I'm sorry?

257
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,980
Physics, in this country, it's a battlefield and a bloody one.

258
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,380
You need brains, which ought to be enough, but it isn't cause you need cash
to fund whatever you're brain's working on,...

259
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,900
...and to get cash out of anyone in this country you need balls,
because they'll try and stop you.

260
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,260
You'll see.

261
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,700
You found a subject?

262
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,660
Any ideas?

263
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,700
- I don't know yet.
- Well when you do, remember this.

264
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,900
You'll have to fight for what you believe in
tooth and nail or the buggers will stop you.

265
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,300
Physics means everything to him.
I want him to be happy, Mr. Sciama.

266
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,580
- What can I do?
- I want you to set him a question that he can...finish.

267
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:19,700
Something easy enough for him to finish…before he dies.

268
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,220
Could you do that? Please?

269
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,180
My students and my science are everything to me.

270
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,220
I try to be true to both.

271
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,420
Which is why I can't do what you ask me Dr. Hawking.

272
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,740
I'm sorry.

273
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,340
Cosmology. The ghetto science.
All speculation and no proof.

274
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,500
The ghetto science?

275
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,540
How did we get here, where are we going,
what is time?

276
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,060
- It asks all the big questions.
- Stephen!

277
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,420
Have you got a subject?
Have you brought a big idea back with you?

278
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,060
- No.
- Plenty of time. Plenty of time.

279
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,940
The greatest achievement of physics
in the twentieth century -

280
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,660
Rutherford, Oppenheimer, what have they given us?
The atomic bomb?

281
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,100
What's the point in asking, how we got here
and where are we going,

282
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,620
if Einstein and your mob
have already got us ready for anything.

283
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,700
Blaming Einstein for that is like blaming Isaac Newton
for plane crashes because he discovered gravity.

284
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,940
Very clever, very smart.
But smartness isn't the real world, is it?

285
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,900
- Cosmologists aren't interested in the real world.
- You see that girl?

286
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,780
- What about her?
- Stephen's going to make her fall in love with him.

287
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,460
- Using only Einstein's theory of relativity.
- What???

288
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,340
- A pound says it can't be done.
- I really don't think this is a good idea.

289
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,700
The honour and  integrity of our entire subject
is at stake here.

290
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:03,700
Alright, alright, I'll do it.

291
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,460
One gin and tonic and I think that's -

292
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,860
Excuse me, have you got the time please?

293
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,700
I make it half past seven.
What time do you make it?

294
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,100
- You already know the time.
- I know my time.

295
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,100
Are you trying to be funny?

296
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,180
Time's not a universal quantity.

297
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,820
We used to think that it was, we used to think that it was just there,
marching on at the same pace for everyone everywhere,...

298
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,900
...like a railway track that stretched to infinity.

299
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,020
Time was eternal. Now we know that it isn't.

300
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,700
- Wow.
- You have to know this is incredibly important.

301
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,780
Time's not a background thing,
it's not an absolute, it can switch,

302
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,580
everything else is measured. It's dynamic.

303
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,740
- Dynamic?
- Active.

304
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,540
- Active?
- Wonderful.

305
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:54,420
If you were to travel East very very quickly -

306
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,980
- Out of sight, to the Far East?
- The Far far East.

307
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,900
Oh completely out of sight.

308
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:06,020
Yes, completely out of sight. And I stayed here
your time would slow down relative to mine.

309
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,820
- Like I'd get really really slow...
- If you went very very fast.

310
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,580
If I went very very fast,
I'd get really really slow.

311
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,300
Your time would, relative to mine.

312
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,820
Totally out of sight.

313
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,300
Time's very important.

314
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:47,300
- What star sign are you?
- What? I don't know.

315
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,060
- You alright?
- Fine.

316
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,660
- Beer?
- Yes please.

317
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,540
Did you want another?

318
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,900
Who is that?

319
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:13,300
Roger Penrose. Brilliant brain.
He'll be a professor within three years.

320
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,980
Sorry, could I?

321
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,380
The thing is just then, um...

322
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:19,305
I was thinking about
mathematics and not beer,

323
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,330
and sometimes when I'm thinking
in a number of different dimensions

324
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,540
I can't come back very
quickly to words and beer,

325
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,150
and whether I want more of it.

326
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,900
It's because of the
pictures in my head, uh...

327
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:29,625
I don't know how to make
the words come. You see...

328
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,220
- Pint or...?
- Yes, please.

329
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,940
Poor orchestration, overly romantic,
Wagner despised him.

330
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,260
The feeling was mutual.

331
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,020
- What?
- Brahms despised Wagner.

332
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,940
Well you can't get compare the two.
For one thing the...

333
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,660
- Stephen!
- Yes?

334
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,020
Hello.

335
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,140
Hello.

336
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,700
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

337
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,100
- Denmark's a prison.
- Then is the world one.

338
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,820
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons. Denmark being o' of the worst.

339
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,340
We think not so, my Lord.

340
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:50,500
Why then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so:

341
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,140
to me it is a prison.

342
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,740
Why then your ambition makes it one;
'tis too narrow for your mind.

343
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:04,740
Oh God, I cold be bounded in a nut shell,
and count myself a king of infinite space,

344
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,380
were it not that I have bad dreams.

345
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,580
What are you thinking?

346
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,700
- I was...thinking about Einstein and relativity.
- Oh!

347
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
- And stars.
- Oh.

348
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,180
It's possible for a perfect star to collapse into nothingness.

349
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,980
If it's a perfect sphere then it can collapse
and become infinitely dense,

350
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:34,020
so dense that everything is pulled down into nothing.
But the conditions have to be right.

351
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,700
What conditions?

352
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:48,740
If it is a perfect sphere, if the place be very moving,
if the evening's very beautiful, the conditions have to be ideal.

353
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,700
It's possible for the pull of gravity
to stop everything escaping.

354
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,660
Everything in nothing.

355
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,500
- Oh no!
- Wasn't that bad, was it?

356
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,100
My bag, I left it in the theatre.

357
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,500
Ah...

358
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,900
Shall we?

359
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,380
Oh we can see a star, look.
There, you see?

360
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,020
Found it!

361
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,820
Hamlet doesn't act. That's his fatal flaw,
if he acted, if he did something -

362
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,660
- It would be a shorter play.
- He'd save his life.

363
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,940
Everybody wants Fred.

364
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
I've been thinking about a subject for you.

365
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,900
- Faraday rotation.
- Boring.

366
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,300
- Mach's principle?
- Formulations I've seen are not well defined.

367
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,020
- They're my formulations.
- Action!

368
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,660
The universe expands.

369
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:15,140
As galaxies move apart, new galaxies are formed
to fill the gaps left behind.

370
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,700
The new replaces the old at just the right rate.

371
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,940
Nothing changes.

372
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:29,220
Wherever you are in the universe; Andromeda,
Mars or Scarborough, it always looks the same.

373
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,700
Because it is the same.

374
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,180
I want to do something significant.

375
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,820
The universe is a steady state universe.

376
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,340
- It is very attractive, steady state, right?
- Cut! Thank you.

377
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:45,700
- And reassuring.
- Yes.

378
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,500
Maybe it's attractive because its reassuring.

379
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,900
Emotionally its far harder to conceive of a universe that's started,
a universe that hasn't always been around.

380
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,500
- Einstein?
- Look what he did when his work looked
like it was predicting there was a beginning to the universe.

381
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,540
He ran away from the prospect to the beginning.

382
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,740
No because he saw that the beginning would mean
a breakdown of all the laws of science.

383
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:08,060
How can science explain something that isn't there?

384
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,340
That's the thing about the idea of a Big Bang.

385
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,180
The thing about the idea of a Big Bang
is that it's wrong. Irrational and wrong.

386
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,380
It's my term, Big Bang. I made it up.
Do you know why I called it that?

387
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,140
Because it sounds like a cartoon.
Big Bang theory is cartoon physics.

388
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,780
Dennis agrees, with me, don't you Dennis?
Lunch?

389
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,540
- The Pope was a Big Bang man.
- Because?

390
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,460
Because before the Big Bang, there was nothing!

391
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:37,820
No space, no time, no matter.

392
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:46,020
No science, no rules, which leaves room for guess who?
Lord God almighty.

393
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,740
Religion is the enemy of science, young man.

394
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,580
If Catholicism had its way, we would all still be living
on a flat Earth at the centre of the universe

395
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,460
with hell down below  and heaven just somewhere
to the left of the moon.

396
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,500
This is 1963. God is dead.

397
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,700
Stay away from Big Bangs,
cartoons are bad for you.

398
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,300
- White dielectric material.
- I'm sorry?

399
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,060
Lots of it. Inside the antenna horn.

400
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,220
It had to be it. It had to be the cause of the hiss.

401
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,660
- White dielectric material?
- Yes.

402
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,220
Pigeon shit. All over the horn.

403
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,220
- You know what we did?
- Unbelievable.

404
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,500
- What did you do?
- We posted them.

405
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,220
- The pigeons?
- We posted the pigeons.

406
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,500
The people we work for had internal mail
and offices all over America.

407
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,700
We posted the pigeons as far away
as we could send them.

408
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,300
- Did it work?
- They came home.

409
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,460
- They were homing pigeons.
- They weren't ready to leave.

410
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,700
So what did you do?

411
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,020
- He....he, um...
- We...had the pigeons shot.

412
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:47,420
- No, Bob had the pigeons shot.
- You killed the pigeons?

413
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,660
- A technician.
- A technician killed the pigeons.

414
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,860
And then we cleared out all the white
dielectric material from inside the horn.

415
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:57,460
On our hands and knees in our white lab coats,
inside the horn scraping away the white stuff.

416
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,700
- And?
- The pigeons were innocent.

417
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:06,980
The hiss was still there.
The pigeon shit was not the hiss.

418
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,940
Is that alright? Can I say that on television?

419
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,300
What am I doing wrong Dennis?

420
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,820
- Dennis?
- Yeah.

421
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:30,740
- Do you hink I could have some more paper?
- Dennis's study. You know where it is.

422
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,820
It's Stephen. I think they're gonna
like each other, you watch.

423
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:38,540
Another lunch of advanced theoretical physics.

424
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

425
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:48,060
Tomatoes. Could you? Thin slices.

426
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:59,420
- Hello. Roger Penrose.
- Yes, I know.

427
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,820
Have you two met?

428
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,580
Prosciutto. Help yourselves.

429
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:14,460
Mozart could go to sleep and wake up with whole symphonies
in his head and no idea how they got there.

430
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,060
A whole symphony in his head, complete.
How can that be?

431
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,380
Music is temporal. How can you pack a whole
symphony into just one moment?

432
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,860
Well maybe it's because music is a way of thinking
that is way beyond language.

433
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,580
Maybe that's what genius is.
Thinking without time.

434
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,620
All roads lead to physics.

435
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:36,140
I think thought, mathematical thought,
can exist completely without words.

436
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,060
I don't think thinking is verbal.
In fact, I think words come in the way.

437
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,380
I think you can do it without words.

438
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,060
Poets have always been obsessed with time.

439
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,060
- Shrinking it, controlling it, stopping it.
- T. S. Eliot?

440
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,620
"Time present and time past are both perhaps
present in time future,

441
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:10,740
and time future contained
in time past."

442
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,660
Rupert Brooke:
"Stands the church clock still at ten to three?"

443
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,740
Blake: "To see a world in grain of sand
and a heaven in a wild flower,

444
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,940
hold infinity in the palm of your hand,
and eternity in an hour."

445
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,100
- L. I. Merick.
- Who?

446
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,660
"There was a young lady named Bright,
whose speed was faster than light.

447
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,540
She set out one day in a relative way
and returned on the previous night."

448
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,580
- It's unstable.
- Sorry?

449
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,100
- Go on.
- It's unstable.

450
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,340
You need a negative energy field in order to create
the new matter, which makes it unstable.

451
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,700
- Hoyle's steady state?
- It's problem, isn't it?

452
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,020
Isn't it?

453
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:28,060
- You like Hawking very much, don't you?
- Hm.

454
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,220
- Will he have the time?
- What?

455
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,220
Does he have enough time left to get what he's after?

456
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,580
I hope so.

457
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,700
A time-symmetric new theory of gravity.
It's brilliant. Hoyle at his best.

458
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,780
- Did you start as his PhD student?
- Are you after my job?

459
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,900
- Did you?
- Are you?

460
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:12,700
- No.
- Yes. He's a great scientist.

461
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,260
His work on the production of uranium inside
stars is - what's the word...

462
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,700
Beautiful. And so is this.

463
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,460
I do the checking. It should be refereed by a committee
but Hoyle doesn't have time.

464
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,700
Can I see it?

465
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:49,940
- I have to go.
- Just give me a few more minutes.

466
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,140
- I have to go now.
- Leave it with me.

467
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,060
- OK, but don't -
- What? Eat it?

468
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,580
Just leave it on my desk.

469
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,220
Up early?

470
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,500
- Are you alright?
- Yes, fine.

471
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,300
You look like you've had a wild night.

472
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:53,220
Something like that.

473
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,300
So the Royal Society this afternoon?

474
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,300
- You're giving the paper today?
- Yes.

475
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,900
You remember Stephen Hawking?

476
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:26,740
The new theory we have formulated differs
in its global implications from the usual theory in that,

477
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:34,140
whereas in the usual theory the negative sign at the constant
of proportionality which appers in the field equations,

478
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,180
is chosen arbitrarily.

479
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,500
In the new theory, there's no such ambiguity.

480
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:49,980
The sign must be minus, and further the magnitude of g
follows on from a determination of the mean density of matter,

481
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:55,060
thereby enabling the cosmologist to know
how hard he'll hit the ground if he falls off a cliff.

482
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,900
Any questions?

483
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,300
You want to say something young man?

484
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,220
Your calculation is wrong.

485
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,100
The advanced field diverges.

486
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:30,900
- The advanced field does not diverge.
- I'm afraid it does. It's all wrong.

487
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,100
Would you like to tell us how you know this,
young man?

488
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,100
I worked it out.

489
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,580
- You worked it out during the lecture?
- No, I had a privileged early glimpse at the paper.

490
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:51,740
- Who put you up to that?
- What?

491
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:54,740
That stunt in there. Who put you up to it, eh?

492
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,340
- Somebody's put you up to sabotaging me.
- It's just wrong, that's all. I had to say it, didn't I?

493
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,180
The physics is wrong.

494
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,980
Why did you show him the paper?

495
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,860
I hate them being shown to any bugger.

496
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,580
- Science isn't theatre.
- It needed to be said.

497
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,700
In that way?

498
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,220
How long has it been, since you've started with me?

499
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,140
- You don't like the idea of me attacking steady state theory...
- You didn't answer my question.

500
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,460
- ...because you're a steady state man yourself.
- OK, I'll answer it for you. Twelve months.

501
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,940
- So the idea of me attacking the steady state theory...
-My father ran a cotton mill.

502
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,820
When I was twenty-one, I told him
I wanted to be a physicist. He hated the idea.

503
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,740
He wanted me to take over the business from him.

504
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:02,300
So he told me that I couldn't be a physicist,
unless I got a fellowship to pay for it.

505
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:06,700
He thought I wouldn't get it.
He thought I would buckle.

506
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,940
- And I worked like a dog...
- What does this have to do with me attacking steady state...

507
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,420
I know what it is like to have obstacles in your path.

508
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,460
I know what it's like to be told you can't do something.
That's why I became a teacher.

509
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:24,780
I would never, ever stop a student of mine from pursuing
something because I didn't agree with their opinion. Never.

510
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:28,860
I know you can do more than make
brilliant attacks on others.

511
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,780
Do something! All of your own.

512
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,180
Be original.

513
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,180
Look out!

514
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,700
Maybe it's New York!

515
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:19,220
- Maybe the hiss is New York we said.
- New York? How?

516
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:26,300
We figured, that if any city in the world can give you
three degress of hot radio noise, it must be the Big Apple.

517
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,540
My family alone could probably make this much hiss.

518
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:31,660
- We were struggling to think what else it could be.
- You were guessing?

519
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:37,380
How could we claim to be making very sensitive radio astronomy
measurements, with all that manmade stuff around.

520
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:43,540
We pointed the antenna at New York City,
all that energy spread out across the northern horizon;

521
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:51,580
arcing from subway rails, hum from power lines,
the radar amplifier at Kennedy Airport spewing out radio noise by the kilowatt.

522
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:59,820
And I'm thinking, just maybe, just maybe, this town,
this town of all towns might crank up three degrees of hiss.

523
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,780
You said you were from Germany.
When did you leave Germany?

524
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,180
Maybe we should stop filming?

525
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,180
I came to America when I was six years old.

526
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,140
We lived in a two room apartment in the garment district.

527
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,460
Me, my brother and my parents and
the cockroaches in the kitchen.

528
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,780
We were poor.

529
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:29,100
That's why I became a physicist. Not to get rich,
not to win the Nobel, to stop being poor.

530
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:34,180
New York wasn't it. We pointed the 20 foot horn
at the city and it gave us a reasonable amount but -

531
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,900
- Not enough heat.
- Not enough.

532
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,540
To win the Nobel Prize, you
have to find something. Am I right?

533
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:43,420
It's not about thinking,
or theory...

534
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:47,540
- It's about discovery.
- But do you have to be looking for the thing that you find?

535
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,820
Science can be slow work.

536
00:54:50,820 --> 00:55:01,020
It's hardly ever about Eureka moments in the bath.
You need precision, tenacity, dedication.

537
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:02,700
German talents.

538
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,100
Your visitor, Mr. Hawking.

539
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,580
He wouldn't let me out of sight, not once.
Scared that I might run amok, I think.

540
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,100
Rules, rules, rules.

541
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:26,580
Penrose lecture at London. Otherwise engaged?

542
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,420
Stephen?
You alright?

543
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,700
- Fine. Fine.
- Oh, your two favourite words.

544
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:42,020
- Is it alright for me to come?
- Fine.

545
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,900
No it's not your turn.

546
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,020
What are you doing?

547
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,580
It's in the rules, I've croqueted you
so I go again.

548
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:26,180
- Can you keep doing that?
- Of course I can!

549
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,140
It's what you're supposed to do, get your opponent's
ball as far away from yours as possible and then...

550
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:37,220
What? What, it's what you
do in croquet!

551
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,900
Go on. The Penrose lecture at London,
it's alright.

552
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,660
Go, now!
Work!

553
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,500
You all have big biceps.
You're right armed.

554
00:57:38,100 --> 00:57:43,860
Because you spend half of your lives scrawling
tonnes of chalk dust, across miles of blackboard.

555
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:45,340
I...

556
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,540
...don't do that.

557
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:59,060
I have something magic and wonderful
to tell you about.

558
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,700
It's fast, it's rigorous,
and you don't need big muscles.

559
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,860
It's called topology.

560
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,980
Pictures, not equations.

561
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:19,300
And nothing moves faster than light.
186 000 miles a second, light is the fastest.

562
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,740
Easily fast enought to overcome
the gravity pull of, say, the Sun,

563
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,420
or the Earth, and escape.

564
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:33,620
The speed is high enough to get away
from the gravity pulling it back.

565
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:43,020
What if the Sun were more concentrated?

566
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,220
What if the Sun were collapsing?

567
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:52,820
The density becomes huge,
the gravity pull enormous.

568
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:56,300
Now nothing can stop
gravity pulling everything in.

569
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,900
Even light.

570
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:00,980
A singularity forms.

571
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,500
What is a singularity?
A singularity is a place,

572
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:09,300
where matter, light, space,

573
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,700
- time -

574
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:20,780
- everything, fold in on themselves
and disappear.

575
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:25,700
It's profound and total nothingness.

576
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,700
Everything in nothing.

577
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,940
Up until now all of you people,
with your big biceps and your big equations

578
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:38,100
have always said: "Oh my big equation
is ending in a singularity, I must be wrong!"

579
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,060
It's what frightened Einstein.

580
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,940
Singularities can't exist because the laws
of science don't allow for them.

581
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:51,420
- Wrong. Singularities do exist.
- For perfect spheres, for idealised stars.

582
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,220
No. For real stars.

583
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:57,700
Real stars do it too;
singularities are out there.

584
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,460
There are places were science
and rules break down,

585
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:05,460
where there is no matter,
no space, nothing.

586
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,740
Where everything, including time,
does not exist.

587
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:18,380
And when a star collapses,
a singularity is inevitable.

588
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:40,260
Topology doesn't bother with the messy stuff,
abot particles, and how they move,

589
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,300
it's about how things connect.

590
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,660
- Big thinking.
- Big bold thinking.

591
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,580
It takes you into places
where the rules say you can't go.

592
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,620
And it's fast. You say that it's fast.

593
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,900
I've tried to be truthful with you.

594
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,900
I'm not going to stop now.

595
01:00:58,660 --> 01:01:02,860
There's nothing more we can do.
There's no treatment, Stephen.

596
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:07,620
I'm sorry.

597
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:13,220
They've washed their hands of him.

598
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,660
- We've got to carry on, Frank.
- Carry on? Carry on?!

599
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,860
We have to do a lot more
than carry on.

600
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:26,380
Vitamin B, hydroxycobalamin, steroids.

601
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:30,500
I haven't washed my hands of you,
they're wrong.

602
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,780
You understand? They're wrong,
the lot of them.

603
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,540
You don't ever talk about his illness.

604
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:37,820
He doesn't speak about it.
We respect that, it's simple, really.

605
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:43,740
And what do you think of me?
I mean, what do you think I should do?

606
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,100
Sorry, no that's not fair,
don't answer George.

607
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,820
You probably think I should take myself of back
to St. Albans and look for a nice husband.

608
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:00,140
I think it's terrific you don't talk about
his illness.

609
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,140
The blue lights are picking up the fluorescence
you get in washing powder,

610
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,700
that is why their shirts are illuminated.

611
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,620
- They're very strange!
- The dresses are new.

612
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,300
They haven't been washed,
so they're not fluorescent.

613
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,980
There you are, you see?
Great scientist.

614
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,300
I can tell you all about how
washing powders react under blue light.

615
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:50,860
One of the great questions of our time.
Whether Tide or Daz is under blue lights!

616
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,860
Do you want to dance?!

617
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,940
I don't know what you should do.

618
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,140
I know what you want.

619
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,900
- House, garden, children, work.
- A life together.

620
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:15,900
The impossible.

621
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:53,060
I've been thinking about Galileo and
what you said about him frightening people.

622
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:58,380
Imagine what if must have felt like
to be told that the Sun didn't go round the Earth.

623
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,460
Horrible! Or that the Earth isn't flat.

624
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:03,220
It is, isn't it?

625
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:06,820
Flat, Jane? Don't tell me it isn't flat.

626
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:14,300
Oh no, oh no! If you look me in the eye now
and tell me it isn't flat, I don't know what I do.

627
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:20,300
I'd be - inconsolable, totally desolate.

628
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:23,500
Stephen!

629
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,660
Did you have any idea what it might be?
Did you think you knew?

630
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,820
Or was it just guessing? Is that what you're
trying to say?

631
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:47,100
A Nobel Prize for guess work?
Is that the story you're after?

632
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,220
Let me tell you something.
Are we still filming?

633
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:50,420
Good.

634
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:56,980
In 1939, my mother and father put me on a train
filled with Jewish children heading to England.

635
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,140
Kinder transport.

636
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:00,140
Are you ok?

637
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:05,540
The Nazis were letting some children go.
Not the adults, just some children.

638
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:14,820
At the station my mother looked in to my face
and said to me to look out for my little brother,

639
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:18,420
not to let our suitcase out of my sight
and don't lose your name tag.

640
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,020
Arno Penzias, here.

641
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,300
You lose your name tag,
you lose your name and you lose everything.

642
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,500
- And she went.
- How old were you?

643
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:30,380
- I was six.
- Did you see her again?

644
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,220
I was six, my little brother was five.

645
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,100
She didn't cry.

646
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:43,740
She made like it was a normal thing,
and not crying was part of that.

647
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,620
Can you imagine how hard
it must have been not to cry?

648
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:50,660
To put your boys on a train like that
and not to cry?

649
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,300
I've hated suitcases ever since.

650
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:56,500
He likes to unpack.

651
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:01,340
My mother and my father got out.

652
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,860
Six months later we sailed for America together.

653
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:12,700
England saved my life.
America gave me a brand new one.

654
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,460
But I never, I never dreamed of this happening.

655
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,540
We discovered this.

656
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:29,780
We found this, we discovered this.

657
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:34,500
What is it?

658
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,900
This clock.

659
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:52,820
It was fine whe I got it. Then I went to America
and it started to run backwards.

660
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,700
Stops my student getting too
complacent about the nature of time.

661
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,860
- I don't know why I came here, I was just...
- The music.

662
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:17,060
- Bach didn't finish it.
- He died before he finished it.

663
01:08:17,060 --> 01:08:18,780
But it's so perfect.

664
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,580
Everything he's done before is so perfect.

665
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,300
It doesn't end.

666
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:28,500
You can hear it after it stops.

667
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,700
Listen.

668
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:42,740
Can you hear it?

669
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:47,500
Can you hear it?

670
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,460
I'll see you in Cambridge.

671
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:46,020
- I thought that was us.
- So did I.

672
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,220
- But it wasn't.
- No, it was them.

673
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:53,980
Backwards now.

674
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,140
We are having a time of it!

675
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:01,540
It's this platform, platform one.

676
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:05,820
It's never straightforward, you know.
You don't know what's going to happen next.

677
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,340
Sometimes I tell my husband about it,
but he doesn't listen.

678
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:11,380
He just says, it's platform one!

679
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:15,700
It's a Cambridge platform, of course strange
things are going to happen.

680
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,300
It's the platform for Cambridge.

681
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,100
Nobody else knows it's there
apart from...

682
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:23,540
- Cambridge types.
- Backwards. Backwards!

683
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,700
-Yes dear.
- You reverse time, of course!

684
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,100
- You reverse the direction of time.
- Yes.

685
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:36,260
- Are you a Cambridge type?
- Yes. And I love you deeply and forever.

686
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,780
Roger!

687
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:57,540
Roger Penrose!

688
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,620
Stop!

689
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,500
- You all right?
- What would it all look like?

690
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,060
- What?
- What if Einstein was right ?!

691
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,700
- About what?
- Pencil! And some paper!

692
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,220
Chalk.

693
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:25,740
- Time-space diagram. What comes first?
- Space. Time?

694
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:31,180
You have to think about reversing
the direction of time.

695
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,620
Time going the other way.

696
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,260
- What? What for?
- Go on, don't stop! Go on!

697
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:39,260
- Now, the present us.
- Here we are, looking back through time.

698
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:46,820
- Light, dense matter, in space.
- Warping space-time?

699
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,540
Causing the light rays, bending the light rays
towards the centre.

700
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,180
Look, the past is pear shaped.

701
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:55,860
What are you saying?

702
01:11:56,420 --> 01:12:01,220
What if the whole of the universe were trapped
in a region whose boundaries reached to zero.

703
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,700
A singularity, nothingness?

704
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:10,340
Your theory works for collapsing dying stars.
It proves that a singularity must exist.

705
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,820
What if it works for this? Could it work Roger?
What would it mean if it did?

706
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,500
- A collapse in reverse.
- Which is?

707
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:16,380
An explosion!

708
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,220
Bang!

709
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:54,020
- Trinity Hall.
- Sorry what?

710
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,180
- Trinity Hall!
- What are you saying?

711
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,700
Write it down.

712
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,580
Why don't you write it down?

713
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,500
- Trinity Hall!
- I'm sorry mate.

714
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:31,420
- Trinity Hall.
- Oh, right! What's the matter with him?

715
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:43,420
- Have you heard of Bishop Usher?
- Seventeenth century.

716
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:46,100
He calculated the date
of the start of the universe.

717
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:50,100
- How?
- By adding up all the ages of people in the Old Testament.

718
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:59,140
- And how old is the universe?
- It started at some point at the night
of 22nd October 4004 BC.

719
01:14:00,860 --> 01:14:03,020
- So old!
- So old.

720
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,620
There's something I want to ask you.

721
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,700
Where was I going when I saw you at the station?

722
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,500
No...

723
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:24,900
Stephen?

724
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:27,620
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

725
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,660
The thing is...

726
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:34,740
I was wondering...

727
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:38,620
...whether you consider marrying me.

728
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,900
- You probably want time to think about it.
- I love you.

729
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,900
Does that mean you're about to say no?

730
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:51,700
Time.

731
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,900
Time to think.

732
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:22,260
- Stephen.
- Not now, John.

733
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:18,300
Think about time going in the opposite direction.

734
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:19,900
What?

735
01:18:21,860 --> 01:18:23,620
Singularities.

736
01:18:24,660 --> 01:18:28,260
A collapse, everything into nothing, yes?

737
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:32,540
So reverse the time, so the collapse
is an explosion.

738
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:37,700
- Nothing into everything.
- You're talking stars.

739
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:39,940
No, no, I'm not talking about stars.

740
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:44,620
I'm talking about the beginning
of the universe.

741
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,100
That Roger Penrose.

742
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:52,140
Clever of me to find him.

743
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:56,700
- I told you you could help him.
- He helped himself I think.

744
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:59,220
- That's your other talent.
- What?

745
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,100
Preposterous modesty.

746
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,380
There you are. Where have you been?

747
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,340
Dennis Sciama wants to see you.

748
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:48,980
He semed very serious.

749
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,500
The first three chapters...

750
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:12,980
...nothing special.

751
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:15,620
The fourth...

752
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:18,900
Mozart.

753
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,140
Oh! Hello.

754
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:36,740
- Jane, women waren't allowed.
- No, not allowed. Against the rules!

755
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,860
I...I'll go.

756
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,500
Hello.

757
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:44,500
Goodbye.

758
01:20:45,980 --> 01:20:46,980
I, er...

759
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,700
I have to go and see the bursar at Caius.

760
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:54,820
They've given me a fellowship.

761
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,700
Are you coming?

762
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:18,060
It's the same rule for everyone at Caius.
No special treatment when it comes to housing.

763
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,660
- I'm not like all the rest.
- That's what they all say.

764
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:25,140
You listen to me. And listen very carefully.

765
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:27,740
This man cannot walk upstairs.

766
01:21:27,740 --> 01:21:30,300
His illness won't allow it
and his illness will get worse.

767
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:34,100
He needs housing with easy access
and you are going to find it for him,

768
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:37,420
because if you don't all the newspapers
will hear about how the bursar of this college

769
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:44,300
treats a man of huge courage, a brilliant mind
and a capacity to imagine faith like...

770
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,180
like a piece of nothing.
Do you understand me?

771
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:48,900
And he's going to be my husband.

772
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:02,140
What he's done is to make Einstein work.

773
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:04,180
He's made Einstein...

774
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:10,500
There's a word that physicists like to use
very occasionally.

775
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:11,900
"Beautiful."

776
01:22:13,460 --> 01:22:15,420
He's made Einstein beautiful.

777
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:17,220
Yes but what...

778
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,300
What has he done?

779
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:26,420
Your son has opened up something which I thought,
we all thought, was closed.

780
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:32,660
Einstein appeared to be predicting it
and then he turned away.

781
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,300
There could have been a beginning.

782
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,700
The universe...

783
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:42,980
... may not always have been here.

784
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:49,900
If you are right, which you are not,
there should be some left over radiation from the Big Bang

785
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,740
and somebody should have heard it.

786
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,980
But they haven't, have they?

787
01:22:54,620 --> 01:22:56,580
I wonder why that could be?

788
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,100
Could it be because it isn't there?

789
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,300
Where's the fossil, Hawking?

790
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,620
Where's the fossil?

791
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,300
We have to go.

792
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,300
It connects, do you understand?

793
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,900
It goes right through Dachau.

794
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:31,500
Right through childhood.

795
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:36,820
Right through cockroaches and suitcases
and right through America and the American dream,

796
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:38,500
which I have lived.

797
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:42,140
Do you understand me?

798
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:47,060
This noise...

799
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:49,700
...this goddamn beautiful hiss...

800
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,020
...it connects.

801
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:58,620
It's the sound of the beginning of time.

802
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:03,140
The leftover heat from the Big Bang.

803
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:07,460
The three degrees that hasn't cooled yet.

804
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,100
It's everywhere.

805
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,620
- It's all around us.
- It's fifteen billion years old.

806
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:21,460
- And we found it.
- That's our discovery.

807
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:29,180
We have to go get the prize, Arno.

808
01:24:46,580 --> 01:24:51,940
- What was there before the Big Bang?
- Whatever it was, it wasn't time, or space, or matter.

809
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:56,540
- There's room for God.
- Yes, in theory.

810
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,700
So what now?

811
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:05,500
I'm going to eat crème brulee
and a huge number of chocolate truffles.

812
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:13,060
And fight very hard to get you to see
how wonderful Wagner is, and how Brahms is not so wonderful.

813
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,700
I meant with work.

814
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:19,860
A theory of everything. I have been looking
at the very big,

815
01:25:19,860 --> 01:25:27,900
and now I want to look into very small,
and see how one may unify gravity and quantum mechanics.

816
01:25:27,900 --> 01:25:32,580
- And how long might this theory of everything take?
- Twenty years, no more than that.

817
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,740
- That fast?
- That fast.

818
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:39,860
I belive in the possible.

819
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:47,620
I believe, small though we are,
insignificant though we may be,

820
01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:51,060
we can reach a full understanding
of the universe.

821
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:57,780
You were right when you said
you felt small looking up at all that out there.

822
01:25:57,780 --> 01:26:06,060
We are very, very small,
but we are profoundly capable of very, very big things.

823
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:14,860
Where are you going?

824
01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:17,860
Things to do.

825
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,980
Can you hear me?

826
01:26:40,980 --> 01:26:42,660
Can you hear me?

827
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,740
Can you hear me?

828
01:27:41,740 --> 01:29:01,700
