subtitle by chagrin, well, kittyin,  Elwoobatch and Aoarashi

2
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:35,143
It has to be back to the beginning.

3
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:35,979
Is that what we're doing?

4
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,915
Yes.

5
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:47,912
One thing we have to know before we start,
when did you meet him?

6
00:00:47,913 --> 00:00:51,078
- Back then?
- In 1963 you're talking about?

7
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,805
Did you make of him?

8
00:00:52,906 --> 00:00:58,901
We didn't. We didn't meet him.
He was in England, we were in New Jersey.

9
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:01,062
Wait a minute.

10
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:04,407
We didn't even know he existed.
Did we know he existed?

11
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:07,415
Yes, we had no idea who he was,
Stephen Hawking, who is he?

12
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,459
It's fifteen years ago, Bob.
Can you believe it?

13
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,680
Time flies, ha?

14
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,885
"There was no beginning of the universe."

15
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:33,720
"Past, present, future.
The universe has always existed and it always will."

16
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,462
Stephen?

17
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,054
"It stays the same."

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:36,726
Stephen?

19
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:53,942
What is it?

20
00:01:54,867 --> 00:01:55,586
What is it?

21
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,425
Ok, wait, how long we've got here?

22
00:02:04,244 --> 00:02:06,997
I don't want be late.
Arno Penzias late for the Noble Prize?

23
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:07,998
I don't think so.

24
00:02:10,242 --> 00:02:11,276
Are we filming now?

25
00:02:11,277 --> 00:02:12,277
Yes.

26
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:21,158
I swear to you, that this is the most
profound thing you'll hear in your entire life.

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,248
The sound, or the story?

28
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:30,267
The sound, or the story?
What's the difference?

29
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:44,685
There you are.

30
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,494
Your mother sent me to find you.

31
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:50,086
"...New matter which has been created to replace all matter."

32
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:54,701
"This process has always existed and will continued forever."

33
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:58,745
"Nothing changes. Nothing has ever changed."

34
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:06,745
"It's my theory. I have given it a name."

35
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:10,751
"I've called it: steady state. "

36
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:16,171
"Goodnight."

37
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,769
Goodnight, professor Hoyle.

38
00:03:18,484 --> 00:03:20,000
That's Hoyle?

39
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,569
That's Hoyle.

40
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,000
- Hello.
- Hello?

41
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:28,910
Who are you?

42
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,287
I'm Jane Wilde.

43
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,411
- We haven't talked, have we?
- No.

44
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,476
I'm a friend of Stephen's.

45
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:41,519
We met at another party and he invited me.
To this party.

46
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,771
Isobel? Isobel!

47
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:54,497
Hello. How are you?

48
00:03:54,498 --> 00:03:55,498
Fine.

49
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:59,664
Good. You?

50
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:01,619
I'm still fine. Thanks.

51
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:02,687
Sorry.

52
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,012
You're, your-

53
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:08,096
Oh, no, thanks, thank you very much.

54
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:13,846
There're terrible thing, aren't they?

55
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:16,881
Yes. Terrible.

56
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,073
Thanks.

57
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,125
Stephen?

58
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:46,587
It's a party. People might want to dance.

59
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:47,587
Can't dance Wagner.

60
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,887
To Stephen.

61
00:05:14,422 --> 00:05:15,422
Happy birthday.

62
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,481
Shall we go outside?

63
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,019
What?

64
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:33,393
It makes me feel... small. Very small.

65
00:05:33,394 --> 00:05:36,337
All that out there, us here.

66
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:38,290
Don't worry. Galileo was wrong.

67
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:42,763
St Albans Is absolute the central of the universe.

68
00:05:42,764 --> 00:05:46,217
Galileo died. 321 years ago today.

69
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:47,447
On your birthday.

70
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:54,007
Changed the way we thought about everything,
people are frightened of change.

71
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:57,084
My father and I used to come out here in
the middle of the night, and looked at the stars,

72
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:59,280
actually saw star died once.

73
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:05,003
Of course it happened two hundred thousand ago
and its [?] reached open night in 56.

74
00:06:05,004 --> 00:06:08,035
Light is fast, but it isn't that fast.

75
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:10,646
Sorry. Physics.

76
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,712
They're all so far away.

77
00:06:13,713 --> 00:06:15,061
But they don't see me, I mean,

78
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:18,206
it makes me feel like I'm stretching
and reaching them and just touch them.

79
00:06:18,207 --> 00:06:20,598
You better hurry up,
with your stretching and reaching them,

80
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:21,845
because it's getting further away.

81
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:22,497
What?

82
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:26,478
Galaxy is moving away from us
because it once about 6 million miles

83
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,911
but it's about two hundreds million miles now.

84
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:31,152
I believe in God.

85
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:35,594
Oh, sorry. I just want to say, I don't know why.

86
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:36,595
It's all right.

87
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:42,277
You said you felt small, does God make you feel less small?

88
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,913
It's nothing wrong with feeling inside, it's feeling matters.

89
00:06:46,914 --> 00:06:48,802
All the best idea were felt and argued about later.

90
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:52,699
Einstein said he could feel his little finger if his idea was right.

91
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,869
See you have good company. And you like Wagner?

92
00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:01,667
Actually... no. I don't. I think he's...

93
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:02,563
What?

94
00:07:02,564 --> 00:07:05,673
Pompous, and ridiculous.

95
00:07:06,824 --> 00:07:08,388
Who do you like then?

96
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:11,457
Rachmaninov.

97
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:13,724
What?

98
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:14,725
Nothing.

99
00:07:15,014 --> 00:07:17,754
Brahms? Stephen?

100
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,305
I didn't say anything.

101
00:07:22,064 --> 00:07:23,587
The Beatles.

102
00:07:23,588 --> 00:07:24,468
Who?

103
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,156
Never mind.

104
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:27,157
Jane?

105
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:28,507
Yes.

106
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:29,675
Please please me.

107
00:07:30,157 --> 00:07:31,157
What?

108
00:07:32,193 --> 00:07:34,407
Love me do.

109
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:42,321
We should go in.

110
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,582
- I can't get up.
- Come on!

111
00:07:49,091 --> 00:07:50,091
I can't!

112
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:52,076
Very funny!

113
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:54,594
I can't get up, Jane!

114
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,077
I'll go in to get help.

115
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:05,352
Hello Jane! Hello? Can you hear me?

116
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:09,296
What's wrong with you?

117
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,350
I can't get up!

118
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,540
Well, give me your hands.

119
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:18,929
Will it hurt?

120
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:25,133
The truth? Yes. A little bit more.

121
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,546
That's good. Hold still.

122
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:49,501
That's might be a little bit more uncomfortable.

123
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:00,923
How old are you, Stephen?

124
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:03,050
I'm 21.

125
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,447
How old are you?

126
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,949
I'm older than you.

127
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,500
How much older?

128
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,689
I'm thirty-three.

129
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:17,709
The same interesting [?] so it might make it hard.

130
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:21,532
What did you do?
Oh no, wait, let me guess.

131
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:25,890
Um... insurance sales man? Or banking maybe?

132
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,281
I am a, I'm a cosmologist.

133
00:09:28,282 --> 00:09:29,539
Oh, good for you.

134
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:36,530
Just start my PhD,
or rather just start to think about what my Ph.D might be.

135
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:41,064
Now it'll take about five minutes.

136
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:47,606
Some time it helps, too, to talk about something completely different.

137
00:09:47,607 --> 00:09:54,866
To take your mind off all this,
and then your time suspend in space will pass more quickly.

138
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:00,563
Time and space don't exist independently of each other.

139
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:02,345
Isn't that so?

140
00:10:02,346 --> 00:10:04,107
Or the universe.

141
00:10:04,108 --> 00:10:05,753
Really?

142
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,770
Matter and energy in the universe.

143
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,316
Open or stop spacetime.

144
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,977
Spacetime is curved.

145
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:54,000
Hello?

146
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,713
No, no, We, we don't know.

147
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,733
Lots of tests. Yes, goodbye.

148
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:09,407
Who was it?

149
00:11:09,608 --> 00:11:11,904
The girl from the party.

150
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:34,891
The X-way of your spine with the dying shows
you don't have anything pressing on your spinal cord.

151
00:11:34,891 --> 00:11:36,532
That's good, isn't it?

152
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:39,506
It's a process of elimination.

153
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:51,363
You're a team.
I mean you both getting your Nobel Prize this evening.

154
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:55,774
I put him up to this job.

155
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,939
And they wouldn't even let me in on the interview.

156
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,288
So I [?] around. When Bob and the interview committee came out,

157
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:08,240
doing their hand shakes and
"thank you for coming and I will let you know", I moved in.

158
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:14,682
"You gave him the job, right?
You gave Bob the job, didn't you?"

159
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:17,897
It was this kind of embarrassed pause.

160
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,314
So I told them straight,

161
00:12:20,315 --> 00:12:27,004
"Bob and I are going to walk down the corridor right here,
and right out that door, right there."

162
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:33,893
"And if you don't want Bob to have the job that he was born to do,
then you call up before we go through that door."

163
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,113
Longest walk in my life.

164
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:37,775
62 paces.

165
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:39,823
And we never looked back.

166
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:05,589
They won't tell me what they're thinking.

167
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:06,590
Doctors don't.

168
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:08,211
They don't know themselves yet.

169
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:09,997
I'm a doctor, Isobel, I know what they are like.

170
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,839
You're a tropical disease expert, dad.

171
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,892
I know doctors.

172
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,463
What? Isobel?

173
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:17,714
Nothing.

174
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:20,349
I will arrange for you to have a private room.

175
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:23,903
No. I will stay in the ward like everyone else.

176
00:14:12,363 --> 00:14:16,241
So have you applied for Oxford or Cambridge?

177
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:21,973
They don't want me, I was thinking of Westfield.

178
00:14:21,974 --> 00:14:23,833
It's an old lady's college.

179
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:31,512
On the [?] model. I suppose, and, and, It's quite...

180
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,977
Scrabble. Let's play scrabble.

181
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:50,358
Leukemia.

182
00:14:52,463 --> 00:14:54,019
He's twelve.

183
00:15:07,856 --> 00:15:08,977
It was beautiful.

184
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:13,096
I came out of the woods and there was,
a perfect piece of equipment.

185
00:15:13,096 --> 00:15:14,303
The antenna.

186
00:15:14,303 --> 00:15:18,708
A great big horn like a [?] horn lying on the side.

187
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:26,906
The size of a house. In the middle of a field,
on a hill, 20 miles out New York City, picking up the hiss.

188
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:27,990
Pointing at the stars.

189
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:29,182
And picking up the hiss.

190
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:33,483
And then the first time I saw the horn, you know what?
They flew right out of her.

191
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:34,099
Who?

192
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,213
The pigeons.

193
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:38,656
The twenty-four horn, has a couple of pigeons living inside it.

194
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:39,644
- Pigeons?
- Pigeons!

195
00:15:39,862 --> 00:15:43,727
What is it for the twenty-four horn? Apart from pigeon nesting.

196
00:15:43,727 --> 00:15:47,002
We wanted to measure the noise, out of the range of the milky way.

197
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,915
Arno built a cold load.

198
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:49,744
What's that?

199
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:52,001
5 imperial gallons of the liquid helium.

200
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:53,781
You know how much helium that is?

201
00:15:53,781 --> 00:15:55,066
That's a hell of quantity helium.

202
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:59,361
Gives you unbelievable accurate reference against
which you can measure the noise you receive.

203
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:02,780
Arno was very precise. He make these things better than anyone.

204
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,266
Maybe it's a German in me.

205
00:16:04,266 --> 00:16:05,184
You're German?

206
00:16:05,184 --> 00:16:08,210
First six years in my life and a big chunk of my temper.

207
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:12,659
Bob made a great switch.

208
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,376
Two connected receiver alternatively to the antenna and cold load reference.

209
00:16:16,377 --> 00:16:20,998
Were you born in Germany? When? The 1940s?

210
00:16:20,998 --> 00:16:22,687
No. 1930s.

211
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:27,393
Noise is heat. The higher the heat, the more intense the noise.

212
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:34,401
You may want to ask that we get noise.
We got a lot noise, which means a lot of heat.

213
00:16:34,601 --> 00:16:37,137
Far more than the milky way should have given us.

214
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,367
That was our work. They get on in.

215
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:43,921
Day after day. What's all this heat, what the hell is this hiss.

216
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,593
Died in the night, poor lamb.

217
00:17:21,879 --> 00:17:23,845
Doctor, what's happened to me?

218
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:27,432
Usually I would sit down with the patient and his family.

219
00:17:27,432 --> 00:17:28,642
Please!

220
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:33,584
Motor neuron disease.

221
00:17:35,656 --> 00:17:37,321
What, what it is? What happens?

222
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:42,840
Motor neurons in the brain, which signal movements, they're dying.

223
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:44,648
So?

224
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:54,968
The brain stops telling muscles to move, the signal's not sent,
and muscles are not used, so they waste away, slowly.

225
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:56,416
How slowly?

226
00:17:56,416 --> 00:18:00,480
The muscle's wastage causes immobility.

227
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,658
How slowly?

228
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:04,213
It's gradual paralysis.

229
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,586
And then? Then what?

230
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:12,080
The respiratory muscles unlike most of the other muscles work automatically.

231
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,831
- Breathing.
- Yes.

232
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,916
They don't waste away so quickly.

233
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,242
But, but they do, they do, waste away.

234
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,242
Yes.

235
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:27,239
So what? I won't be able to breath properly,

236
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:31,710
And then I won't be able to breath at all.
So it's like, like drowning.

237
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:35,718
What about the brain? The brain itself?

238
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:41,556
Untouched. Brain is left untouched.

239
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:56,841
He is young. That will work in his favor. Frank?

240
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:07,446
Remember when he was about 8 years old,
and we were in the garden with telescope.

241
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:15,392
And Stephen said to me: "Where do stars come from?"
I didn't know the answer.

242
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:24,375
And you called him into bed and he wanted to know
the answer to his question very badly.

243
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:32,016
And I said: "Not to worry, I'll find out for you. "

244
00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:38,794
I never did.

245
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,303
You've never been a sentimental man, Frank.

246
00:20:45,304 --> 00:20:46,782
No.

247
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:49,625
I don't think we can afford for you to start now.

248
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,024
I looked it up.

249
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:57,417
The younger while you get motor neurone disease,
the quicker, the deterioration.

250
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,374
Being young, is a bad thing, Isobel.

251
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:09,876
Two years, probably no more.

252
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:15,928
Then we must support him.

253
00:21:15,928 --> 00:21:17,810
Yes.

254
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:28,251
You do it, by carrying on.
You do it, by living and carrying on.

255
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:33,061
He's going back to Cambridge, to his life.

256
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,286
Do you know what Holye says?

257
00:21:35,287 --> 00:21:36,326
What?

258
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:40,268
You could drive the car straight upwards.
You reach the space in half an hour.

259
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,465
How long to drive around the milky way?

260
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,417
You must apply the diameter of the galaxy by the distance of one light year.

261
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:47,851
Easy.

262
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,160
The calculation.

263
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,664
The car, just had been to India and back, you remember?

264
00:21:55,011 --> 00:21:57,497
How long dose it take to complete the PhD?

265
00:21:57,597 --> 00:21:58,906
It depends on the subject.

266
00:21:58,906 --> 00:21:59,882
With a fair wind?

267
00:21:59,882 --> 00:22:02,277
With a fair wind and a good brain, two years.

268
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:05,862
What's the name of your supervisor?

269
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,330
Sciama. Dinnes Sciama.

270
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:19,515
50,869,730.6 million miles, around the milky way.

271
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:25,904
The heat we were receiving from out there
should be 2 degrees colder than the cold load, the reference.

272
00:22:25,904 --> 00:22:27,442
But it was hotter, three degrees hotter.

273
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:29,283
Hotter than the milky way could produce.

274
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:32,544
Hotter than some of all the galaxies beyond. So we felt...

275
00:22:32,544 --> 00:22:34,399
It has to be something close to the home.

276
00:22:34,399 --> 00:22:37,305
We had an idea. Or was it you had an idea?

277
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:38,951
I don't remember.

278
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:43,215
Oh we had a whole laundry list of ideas.
Maybe it was me, maybe it was you.

279
00:22:43,586 --> 00:22:44,749
You're a team.

280
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:48,920
- Maybe was me.
- What, what's the idea?

281
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:52,036
There was some high altitude bomb testing back in the 50s.

282
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,703
Maybe it's leftover radiation, maybe are these hiss for them.

283
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:57,703
But it would diminish over time, and what we were getting?

284
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,822
Totally constant, no diminishing.

285
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:01,239
Back to the laundry list.

286
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:15,750
Sciama. Dinnes, yes.

287
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:22,368
Er, I don't know. S-H-A-R-M-A?

288
00:24:23,744 --> 00:24:25,835
I think he is Italian.

289
00:25:16,396 --> 00:25:17,770
Dinnes Sciama?

290
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:18,812
Yes.

291
00:25:18,942 --> 00:25:20,245
Frank Hawking.

292
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,324
Hello, young man.

293
00:26:04,238 --> 00:26:05,246
Do I know you?

294
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:11,697
Stephen Hawking.
I, I applied for you to supervise my Ph.D.

295
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,104
Too busy, was I?

296
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:14,716
Yes, I think so.

297
00:26:17,018 --> 00:26:19,547
Brains, balls, and cash.

298
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,790
I'm sorry?

299
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,726
Physics, in this country is a battle field and a bloody one.

300
00:26:23,727 --> 00:26:28,410
You need brains which you all have enough but it isn't,
because you need cash to fund whatever your brain is working on.

301
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:32,734
And to get cash no one has in this country,
and the balls because they'll try and stop you.

302
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,498
You will see. You found the subject?

303
00:26:38,024 --> 00:26:39,211
Any ideas?

304
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:43,045
I don't know yet.

305
00:26:43,742 --> 00:26:46,434
Well, when you do, remember this:

306
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:52,185
"You have to fight for what you believe in to the nail,
or the buggers will stop you."

307
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:06,022
Physics means everything to him.

308
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:08,088
I want him to be happy, Mr. Sciama.

309
00:27:08,088 --> 00:27:09,501
What can I do?

310
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:13,013
I want you to set him a question that he can... finish.

311
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:19,411
Something easy enough for him to finish, before he dies.

312
00:27:20,635 --> 00:27:23,059
Could you do that?

313
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,122
Please?

314
00:27:27,027 --> 00:27:31,900
My students and my science are everything to me.

315
00:27:33,088 --> 00:27:36,154
I try to be true to both,

316
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:40,767
which is why I can't do what you asked me, Dr. Hawking.

317
00:27:43,586 --> 00:27:45,184
I'm sorry.

318
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:02,116
Cosmology. The "get-told" science,
all speculation no proof...

319
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:03,456
..."Get -told" science?

320
00:28:03,457 --> 00:28:07,150
"How we got here, where we're going, what is time?"
ask us all sort of big questions.

321
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:07,849
Stephen!

322
00:28:09,084 --> 00:28:12,160
Have you got a subject?
You brought a big idea back with you?

323
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,870
No. Plenty of time, plenty of time.

324
00:28:14,871 --> 00:28:21,062
The greatest achievement to physics in the twentieth century,
Roosevelt, Oppenheimer, what have they given us?

325
00:28:21,063 --> 00:28:22,590
The atomic bomb.

326
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,209
What's the point in asking how we got here and where we are going, 

327
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:29,017
If Einstein and your mob've already got us all ready for...

328
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:31,590
Naming Einstein for it doesn't make Newton fool.

329
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,837
Plane crashes because he discovered gravity.

330
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:35,772
Very clever.

331
00:28:35,773 --> 00:28:41,206
Very smart. But those smart isn't real world, is it?
"Cosmologists sound interested in the real world."

332
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:44,468
- Do you see that girl?
- What about her?

333
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:47,754
Stephen is going to make her fall in love with him.

334
00:28:49,023 --> 00:28:51,725
Using only Einstein's theory of relativity.

335
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:52,929
George?

336
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,525
Tom says it can't be done.

337
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,035
I really don't think it is a good idea.

338
00:28:56,596 --> 00:29:00,871
The honor and integrity of our entire subject is at stake here.

339
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,806
All right. All right.

340
00:29:02,694 --> 00:29:03,673
Do it.

341
00:29:03,673 --> 00:29:05,205
One ginger tonic. And I think it's...

342
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:06,992
Excuse me, you got the time, please?

343
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:10,360
I make it half pass seven, what time do you make it?

344
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:12,647
You already know the time.

345
00:29:12,647 --> 00:29:14,084
I know my time.

346
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,118
Are you trying to be funny?

347
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:20,284
Time is not universal quantity.

348
00:29:20,285 --> 00:29:23,095
We used to think that it was, we used to think that it was just there,

349
00:29:23,234 --> 00:29:29,327
Marching on at the same pace for everyone,
everywhere like a railway track that stretches to infinity.

350
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:34,081
Time is eternal. Now we know it isn't.

351
00:29:35,828 --> 00:29:36,709
Wow.

352
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,916
You have to know this is incredibly important.

353
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:46,886
Time is not background thing, it is not absolute,
against which everything else is measured. It's dynamic.

354
00:29:46,887 --> 00:29:47,987
Dynamic?

355
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:49,576
Active.

356
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:51,047
Active?

357
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:54,292
Wonderful. If you were to travel east very very quickly...

358
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,639
Out of sight? The far east?

359
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,170
The far far east.

360
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,527
It's completely out of sight.

361
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:00,904
Yes, completely out of sight.

362
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:05,123
And I stay right here, your time will slow down relative to mine.

363
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:12,483
Like I get really really slow?

364
00:30:12,484 --> 00:30:14,720
If you went very very fast.

365
00:30:15,997 --> 00:30:20,278
If you went very very fast?

366
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:22,286
I get really really slow!

367
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:25,130
Your time would, relative to mine.

368
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:29,607
Hah...totally out of sight.

369
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:35,736
Time is very important.

370
00:30:40,915 --> 00:30:43,023
What starts I know you?

371
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,735
What? I don't know.

372
00:30:52,628 --> 00:30:53,821
Are you all right?

373
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:54,822
Fine.

374
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,855
Did you want another?

375
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:08,725
Who's that?

376
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:11,169
Roger Penrose. Brilliant brain.

377
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,305
He would be a professor within three years.

378
00:31:13,306 --> 00:31:14,733
Sorry, could I?

379
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,752
The thing is, er, just, I was thinking about
mathematics and not being around

380
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,442
And sometimes I was thinking of numbers in a different dimension

381
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:24,684
And I can't come back very quickly to words
and being whether I want it or not,

382
00:31:24,685 --> 00:31:29,781
Because of pictures in my head
and don't know how to make the words come. You see?

383
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,796
[?]

384
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:33,063
Yes, please.

385
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:29,371
(Dear Jane, I'm fine.)

386
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:50,504
Poor orchestration, overly romantic. Wagner despised him.

387
00:32:50,814 --> 00:32:52,207
The feeling was mutual.

388
00:32:52,207 --> 00:32:52,869
What?

389
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:54,417
Brahms despised Wagner.

390
00:32:54,417 --> 00:32:57,106
Well, you can't compare the two for one thing that...

391
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:57,945
Stephen!

392
00:32:57,946 --> 00:32:58,460
Yes.

393
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,717
Hello?

394
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:02,792
Hello.

395
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,375
Are you all right?

396
00:33:11,646 --> 00:33:14,037
I'm fine.

397
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:23,536
Fine. Fine.

398
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,428
(HAMLET) Denmark's a prison.

399
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:36,254
(ROSENCRANTZ) Then is the world one.

400
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:41,565
(HAMLET) A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.

401
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:43,558
(ROSENCRANTZ) We think not so, my lord.

402
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:50,483
(HAMLET) Why, then, 'tis none to you;
for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so:

403
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:51,848
To me it is a prison.

404
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:56,230
(ROSENCRANTZ) Why then, your ambition makes it one;
'tis too narrow for your mind.

405
00:33:57,609 --> 00:34:04,335
(HAMLET) O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell
and count myself a king of infinite space,

406
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:07,222
Were it not that I have bad dreams.

407
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:13,287
What are you thinking?

408
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:15,072
I was...er...

409
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:17,937
Thinking about Einstein and the relativity.

410
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:19,391
Oh.

411
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,757
And stars.

412
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:21,913
Oh.

413
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,836
It's possible for a perfect star to collapse into nothingness.

414
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:28,850
If it's a perfect sphere that it can collapse and become infinitely dense,

415
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:32,307
So dense that everything is pulled down into nothing.

416
00:34:32,308 --> 00:34:34,368
But the conditions have to be right.

417
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,715
What conditions?

418
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:45,444
Yeah, if it is a perfect sphere,
if a place has been very moving, if even it's very beautiful.

419
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:48,707
The condition has to be ideal,

420
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:54,833
And is possible for the pull of the gravity,
to stop everything escaping,

421
00:34:54,833 --> 00:34:56,534
Everything in nothing.

422
00:34:59,522 --> 00:35:01,757
Oh, no!

423
00:35:01,758 --> 00:35:03,424
Wasn't that bad, was it?

424
00:35:03,424 --> 00:35:05,381
My bag, I left it in the theatre.

425
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,212
Ah.

426
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,891
Shall we?

427
00:35:15,792 --> 00:35:18,339
Oh, can you see these stars?
Look, can you see?

428
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:22,441
Found it!

429
00:35:29,659 --> 00:35:31,637
Hamlet doesn't act.

430
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:34,552
That is his fate to avoid.
If he acted, if he did something...

431
00:35:34,553 --> 00:35:35,782
...Shorten the play.

432
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:37,390
It saves his life.

433
00:36:42,371 --> 00:36:43,971
Everybody wants fact.

434
00:36:45,598 --> 00:36:47,595
I've been thinking about the subject for you.

435
00:36:49,311 --> 00:36:50,797
Faraday rotation?

436
00:36:50,797 --> 00:36:52,717
Boring.

437
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:55,050
Mach's principle?

438
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:58,123
Formulations I've seen that. Not well defined.

439
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,455
They are my formulations.

440
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:15,004
The universe expands, as galaxies move apart,
new galaxies are formed to fill the gaps that behind.

441
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:19,306
The new replaces the old at just the right rate.

442
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:26,507
Nothing changes.
Wherever you are in the universes, Andromeda, Mars or Scarborough,

443
00:37:26,508 --> 00:37:31,200
It always looks the same, because it is the same.

444
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:34,422
I want to do something significant.

445
00:37:34,422 --> 00:37:39,226
The universe, is a steady state universe.

446
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,139
It's a very attractive steady state for me.

447
00:37:42,716 --> 00:37:44,166
And reassuring.

448
00:37:44,166 --> 00:37:45,525
Yes?

449
00:37:45,525 --> 00:37:47,981
Maybe it's attractive because it's really reassuring.

450
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:53,803
Emotionally it is far hard to conceive that the universe has started,
the universe hasn't always been around.

451
00:37:53,803 --> 00:37:54,596
Einstein?

452
00:37:54,596 --> 00:37:58,289
Nobody dig in his work.
Looks like he's predicting there's a beginning to the universe.

453
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:00,554
He ran away from the prospect from the beginning.

454
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:04,846
No, because he saw the beginning would mean
a breakdown of all the laws of science.

455
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:07,741
How can science explain something that isn't there?

456
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,124
That's the thing about the idea of a Big Bang.

457
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:12,869
The think about the idea of a Big Bang is that he's wrong.

458
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:14,237
Irrational, and wrong.

459
00:38:14,237 --> 00:38:16,861
It's my term, Big Bang, I made it up.

460
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:20,186
Do you know why I call it?
Because it sounds like a cartoon.

461
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:22,843
The Big Bang theory is cartoon physics.

462
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:26,428
Dennis agrees with this, don't you, Dennis? Lunch?

463
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:29,587
The pope is the Big Bang man.

464
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:30,514
Because?

465
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:33,833
Because before the Big Bang, there was nothing.

466
00:38:34,033 --> 00:38:37,648
No space, no time, no matter,

467
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:43,530
No science, no rules, which leaves room for?
Guess who?

468
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,597
Lord God Almighty.

469
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:49,189
Religion is the enemy of science, young man.

470
00:38:49,389 --> 00:38:52,553
If catholicism had its way, we all still live in a flatter,

471
00:38:52,554 --> 00:38:56,528
At the centre of the universe with the hell down below
and the heaven just so much on the left of the moon.

472
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,782
This is 1963, god is dead.

473
00:39:00,783 --> 00:39:04,285
Stay away from Big Bangs, cartoons are bad for you.

474
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:11,517
White dielectric material.

475
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:12,275
I'm sorry?

476
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:14,048
Lots of them. Inside antenna horn.

477
00:39:14,049 --> 00:39:16,048
Had to be it, had to be the cause of the hiss.

478
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:18,655
- White dielectric material?
- Yes.

479
00:39:18,655 --> 00:39:20,765
Pigeon shit, all over the horn.

480
00:39:20,865 --> 00:39:21,834
You know what we did?

481
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:22,835
Ar, unbelievable.

482
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:24,606
What did you do?

483
00:39:24,606 --> 00:39:25,513
We posted them.

484
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:26,090
The pigeons?

485
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:27,091
We posted the pigeons.

486
00:39:27,092 --> 00:39:30,732
The people we worked for had the internal mail and offices are all over American.

487
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,918
We posted the pigeons as far away as we can send them.

488
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:33,636
Did it work?

489
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:34,315
They came home.

490
00:39:34,315 --> 00:39:35,414
There was the homie pigeons.

491
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,271
They weren't ready to leave.

492
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:38,497
So what did you do?

493
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:41,304
He, he, er...

494
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:43,781
We, had the pigeons shot.

495
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,236
No, Bob had the pigeons shot.

496
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:47,335
You killed the pigeons?

497
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:48,336
A technician.

498
00:39:48,154 --> 00:39:49,573
A technician killed the pigeons.

499
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:52,796
And we cleared out all the dielectric material from inside the horn.

500
00:39:52,797 --> 00:39:57,367
On our hands and knees, in our white lab coats,
inside the horn scraping away the white stuff.

501
00:39:57,368 --> 00:39:58,147
And?

502
00:39:58,147 --> 00:39:59,555
The pigeons were innocent.

503
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:03,662
The hiss was still there.

504
00:40:05,377 --> 00:40:07,826
The pigeons' shit was not the hiss.

505
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:11,978
Is that all right? Can I say that in the television?

506
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:17,081
What was I doing wrong, Dennis?

507
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:23,293
Dennis?

508
00:40:23,293 --> 00:40:24,330
Yap.

509
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,747
Do you think I could get more papers?

510
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:30,383
Dennis's study. You know where it is.

511
00:40:32,407 --> 00:40:33,465
It's Stephen.

512
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:35,720
I think you'll like each other, you watch.

513
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,595
Another lunch of advanced dialectical physics.

514
00:40:38,596 --> 00:40:39,305
Hello.

515
00:40:39,305 --> 00:40:41,124
Hello.

516
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:47,708
Tomatoes. Could you? Thin slices.

517
00:40:55,196 --> 00:40:57,493
Hello. Roger Penrose.

518
00:40:57,493 --> 00:40:59,488
Yes, I know.

519
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:01,108
Have you two met?

520
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:06,897
[??] Help yourselves.

521
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,945
Mozart could go to sleep,

522
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:14,377
And wake up with whole symphony in his head
and no idea how they got there.

523
00:41:14,377 --> 00:41:16,865
Whole symphony in his head complete.
How can that be?

524
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:21,550
Music is temporal.
How can you pack a whole symphony into just one moment?

525
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,110
Or maybe it's because music is a way of thinking that goes way beyond language

526
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:26,897
May be that's what genius is.

527
00:41:27,098 --> 00:41:29,324
Thinking without time.

528
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,533
All the roads lead to physics.

529
00:41:31,534 --> 00:41:36,124
I think thought, mathematical thought can exist completely without words.

530
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:42,194
I don't think thinking involved in fact. I think words come in the way.
I think you can do without words.

531
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:58,874
Poets have always been obsessed with time.

532
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:03,099
Shrinking it, controlling it, stopping it.

533
00:42:03,099 --> 00:42:04,029
T.J. Eliot.

534
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:10,899
Time present and time past are both perhaps present in time future,
and time future contained in time past.

535
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:13,354
Rupert Brooke "Stands the Church clock at ten to three?"

536
00:42:13,354 --> 00:42:17,607
Blake. To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower,

537
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:21,671
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.

538
00:42:22,629 --> 00:42:24,268
And limerick.

539
00:42:24,268 --> 00:42:25,316
Who?

540
00:42:26,506 --> 00:42:30,459
There was a young lady named Bright,
Whose speed was much faster than light.

541
00:42:30,459 --> 00:42:34,781
She set out one day, In a relative way,
And returned on the previous night.

542
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:43,580
It's unstable.

543
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,459
Sorry?

544
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:45,337
Go on.

545
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:46,338
It's unstable!

546
00:42:47,005 --> 00:42:52,918
You need the negative energy field in order to
create the new matter which makes it unstable.

547
00:42:53,326 --> 00:42:54,426
Hoyle's steady state?

548
00:42:54,427 --> 00:42:58,689
It's a problem, isn't it? Isn't it?

549
00:43:23,602 --> 00:43:25,959
You like Hawking very much, don't you?

550
00:43:28,176 --> 00:43:29,143
Will he have the time?

551
00:43:29,144 --> 00:43:30,402
What?

552
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,159
Does he have enough time left to get what he's after?

553
00:43:35,318 --> 00:43:36,834
I hope so.

554
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,261
A time symmetric new theory of gravity.

555
00:44:01,262 --> 00:44:03,625
It's brilliant. Hoyle is the best.

556
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,585
Did you start as his Ph.D. student?

557
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:07,650
Are you after my job?

558
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:08,795
- Did you?
- Are you?

559
00:44:09,798 --> 00:44:10,798
No?

560
00:44:10,797 --> 00:44:12,874
Yes, he is a great scientist.

561
00:44:13,642 --> 00:44:18,206
You work on the deduction of the helium inside the stars.
It's...eh,what's the word...

562
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:20,732
Beautiful, and so is this.

563
00:44:21,348 --> 00:44:25,243
I do the checking. It should be referred
by the committee but Hoyle doesn't have the time.

564
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:26,637
Can I see it?

565
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,455
I have to go.

566
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:49,222
Just give me a few moment.

567
00:44:49,842 --> 00:44:51,109
I have to go now.

568
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,182
Leave it with me.

569
00:44:54,383 --> 00:44:55,478
OK, but don't...

570
00:44:55,479 --> 00:44:57,265
What? Eat it?

571
00:45:02,554 --> 00:45:04,670
Just leave it on my desk.

572
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:45,785
Up early? Are you all right?

573
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,746
Fine.

574
00:47:48,264 --> 00:47:50,532
You look like you have a wild night.

575
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:53,339
Something like that.

576
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,769
So the Royal Society this afternoon?

577
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:00,295
You are giving a paper today?

578
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:01,149
This.

579
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,159
You, remember Stephen Hawking?

580
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:26,381
The new theory we have formulated differs in
its global implications from the usual theory,

581
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:29,335
In that, whereas, in the usual theory,

582
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:35,917
The negative sign of the the constant proportionality
which appears in the field equations is chosen arbitrarily.

583
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:40,237
In the new theory, there's no such ambiguity.

584
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:44,669
The sign must be minus and further, that magnitude of G,

585
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,104
Follows on from a determination of the mean density of matter.

586
00:49:49,844 --> 00:49:56,699
Thereby enabling the cosmologist to know
how hard he'll hit the ground if he falls off a cliff.

587
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:00,502
Any questions?

588
00:50:12,544 --> 00:50:14,470
Did you want to say something, young man?

589
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:24,169
Your calculation is wrong. The advanced field diverges.

590
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:27,622
The advanced field does not diverge.

591
00:50:27,688 --> 00:50:31,274
No, I'm afraid it does. It's all wrong.

592
00:50:32,749 --> 00:50:35,587
Would you like to tell us how you know this, young man?

593
00:50:37,513 --> 00:50:39,313
I worked it out.

594
00:50:44,843 --> 00:50:46,729
You worked it out dunning the lecture?

595
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,727
No, I had it previously shown only a glimpse of the paper.

596
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,013
Who put you up to that?

597
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:51,742
What?

598
00:50:51,743 --> 00:50:56,848
That stance there. somebody's put you up to sabotaging me.

599
00:50:56,548 --> 00:50:59,184
It's just wrong, that's all, I did say it, didn't I?

600
00:51:00,653 --> 00:51:02,163
The physics is wrong!

601
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:06,409
Why did you show him the paper?

602
00:51:08,155 --> 00:51:10,950
I hate them being shown to any bugger.

603
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,548
Science isn't a theatre.

604
00:51:25,795 --> 00:51:27,559
It needed to be said.

605
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:28,668
In that way?

606
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,406
How long has it been since you started with me?

607
00:51:35,073 --> 00:51:38,925
- You don't like the idea of me attacking steady state theory.
- You didn't answer my question.

608
00:51:38,926 --> 00:51:40,993
Because you are a steady state man yourself.

609
00:51:40,994 --> 00:51:44,400
OK, I answer it for you. Twelve months.

610
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,517
So the idea of me attacking steady state...

611
00:51:47,517 --> 00:51:48,864
My father ran a cotton mill.

612
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:54,374
When I was 21, I told him I wanted be a physicist,
he hated the idea.

613
00:51:54,674 --> 00:51:57,464
He wanted me to take over the business from him.

614
00:51:57,465 --> 00:52:02,148
So he told me that I couldn't be a physicist
unless I got a fellowship to pay for it.

615
00:52:02,148 --> 00:52:07,397
He thought I wouldn't get it. He thought I wouldn't buck.
I worked like a dog...

616
00:52:07,398 --> 00:52:09,834
What is this to do with me attacking steady state?

617
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:12,075
I know what is it like to have obstacles in your path,

618
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:18,191
I know what is it like to be told you can't do something,
that's why I became a teacher.

619
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:21,097
I would never ever stop a student of mine
from pursuing something

620
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:23,862
because I didn't agree with their opinion.

621
00:52:23,863 --> 00:52:25,891
Never.

622
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,088
I know you can do more than make brilliant attacks on others.

623
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:33,437
Do something, all of your own.

624
00:52:34,586 --> 00:52:35,988
Be original.

625
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:40,449
Look out!

626
00:52:44,233 --> 00:52:45,233
Drunk?

627
00:53:13,072 --> 00:53:15,029
Maybe it's New York.

628
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:17,175
Maybe the hiss is New York with it.

629
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:19,229
New York? How?

630
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:26,359
We figure that if any city in the world could give you
three degrees of hot radio noise it must be the Big Apple.

631
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,497
My family alone could probably make the much of hiss.

632
00:53:28,498 --> 00:53:30,637
We were struggling the thing  what else it could be.

633
00:53:30,637 --> 00:53:31,433
You're guessing?

634
00:53:31,434 --> 00:53:34,965
How could we claim that we have been making
very sensitive radio astronomy measurements

635
00:53:34,966 --> 00:53:37,527
With that all man-made stuff around?

636
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:39,633
We pointed the antenna the New York City.

637
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:43,637
All that energy spread out across the northern horizon,

638
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:47,151
[?] from sub-rails, hammers from power lines,

639
00:53:47,151 --> 00:53:51,425
the radar amplifier at Kennedy airport
spilling out radio noises by the kilowatts.

640
00:53:51,425 --> 00:54:00,007
And I'm thinking, just maybe, just maybe, this town,
this town of all towns might crank up three degrees of hiss!

641
00:54:00,007 --> 00:54:04,473
You've said that you were from Germany. When did you leave Germany?

642
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:06,913
Maybe we should stop filming.

643
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,864
I came to American when I was six years old.

644
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:14,768
We lived in a 2-room apartment in the Garment District.

645
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:19,365
Me and my brother and my parents and cockroaches in the kitchen.

646
00:54:19,366 --> 00:54:23,989
We were poor. That's why I became a physicist,

647
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:29,034
not to get rich, not to win the Nobel, to stop being poor.

648
00:54:29,034 --> 00:54:30,360
New York, wasn't it?

649
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:33,989
We pointed 20 feet horn at the city.
It gave us a reasonable amount but-

650
00:54:33,989 --> 00:54:34,875
Not enough hiss.

651
00:54:34,876 --> 00:54:35,876
Not enough.

652
00:54:36,382 --> 00:54:39,448
To win the Nobel Prize you have to find something.

653
00:54:39,448 --> 00:54:43,270
Am I right? It's not about thinking or theory.

654
00:54:43,271 --> 00:54:45,031
It's about discovery.

655
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,717
But do you have to be looking for the thing that you find?

656
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:55,368
Science can be slow work.
It's hardly ever about eureka moments in the bath.

657
00:54:55,369 --> 00:55:00,799
You need precision, tenacity, dedication.

658
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,491
German talents.

659
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,292
Your visitor, Mr. Hawking.

660
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,363
He wouldn't let me out of sight, not once.

661
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:20,120
Scared me out of my mug, I think.

662
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,092
Oh, rules, rules, rules! 

663
00:55:23,408 --> 00:55:27,025
Penrose's lecture in London.
Otherwise engaged?

664
00:55:30,581 --> 00:55:32,733
Stephen? Are you all right?

665
00:55:33,511 --> 00:55:35,308
Fine, fine.

666
00:55:35,309 --> 00:55:36,787
Oh, your two favourite words.

667
00:55:38,381 --> 00:55:40,892
Is it all right for me to have come?

668
00:55:40,892 --> 00:55:42,618
Fine.

669
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:48,854
No, it's not your turn.

670
00:55:51,909 --> 00:55:53,288
What are you doing?

671
00:55:53,288 --> 00:55:56,054
It's in the rules, I've cricketed it and so I go again.

672
00:56:23,164 --> 00:56:24,882
Can you keep doing that?

673
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,368
Of course I can.

674
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:34,270
So what you are supposed to do is to
get your pair of balls as far away from its [?] and then.....

675
00:56:34,271 --> 00:56:37,245
What? What is your doing, cricking?

676
00:56:44,944 --> 00:56:48,375
Hold on. A Penrose lecture in London.

677
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:53,771
It's all right. Go, now! Work!

678
00:57:31,923 --> 00:57:36,620
You all have big biceps, the right terms.

679
00:57:37,529 --> 00:57:44,048
Because you spent half of your life scoring
tons of chalk dust, across miles of blackboard.

680
00:57:44,049 --> 00:57:45,409
I...

681
00:57:52,351 --> 00:57:53,708
Don't do that.

682
00:57:54,518 --> 00:57:58,546
I have something magic and wonderful to tell you about.

683
00:57:58,546 --> 00:58:05,518
It's fast, it's vigorous, and you don't need big muscles.
It's called topology.

684
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,275
Pictures, not equations.

685
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:16,228
And nothing moves faster than light.

686
00:58:16,228 --> 00:58:19,165
Under 186,000 miles per second, light is the fastest,

687
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:22,592
easily fast enough to overcome the gravity pull of,

688
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:24,337
say, the sun,

689
00:58:25,337 --> 00:58:28,706
or the Earth, and escape.

690
00:58:28,707 --> 00:58:33,686
The speed is high enough to get away
from the gravity pulling it back.

691
00:58:38,646 --> 00:58:44,145
What if the sun... were more concentrated?

692
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:47,231
What if the sun were collapsed?

693
00:58:48,089 --> 00:58:52,899
The density becomes huge, the gravity pull enormous.

694
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,965
And now nothing could stop gravity
pulling everything in - even light.

695
00:58:59,241 --> 00:59:00,590
Singularity forms.

696
00:59:01,637 --> 00:59:09,568
What is singularity?
A singularity is a place where matter, light, space...

697
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:12,501
Time.

698
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:14,692
Everything.

699
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:21,109
Fold in on themselves, and dissappear.

700
00:59:22,207 --> 00:59:26,402
It's profound, and total nothingness.

701
00:59:26,402 --> 00:59:28,237
Everything in nothing.

702
00:59:28,238 --> 00:59:30,435
And up until now, all of you people

703
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:34,337
with your big biceps and your big equations,
have always said,

704
00:59:34,338 --> 00:59:38,462
"Oh, my big equation is ending in a singularity, I must be wrong."

705
00:59:38,462 --> 00:59:40,291
That's what frightened Einstein.

706
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:44,095
Singularities can't exist
because the laws of science don't allow for them.

707
00:59:44,195 --> 00:59:47,919
Wrong. Singularities do exist.

708
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,775
For perfect sphere, for ideal light stars.

709
00:59:50,776 --> 00:59:53,476
No, for real stars.

710
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:57,870
Real stars do it, too. Singularities are out there.

711
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:06,044
There are places where science and rules break down
where there is no matter, no space, nothing,

712
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:11,410
where everything, including time, does not exist.

713
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:19,016
And when a star collapses, singularity is inevitable.

714
01:00:35,694 --> 01:00:39,977
Topology doesn't bother with the messy stuff
about particals and how they move,

715
01:00:39,978 --> 01:00:41,615
it's about how things connect.

716
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:42,310
Big thinking.

717
01:00:42,311 --> 01:00:46,906
Big bold thinking.
It takes you to places where the rules say you can't go.

718
01:00:46,906 --> 01:00:50,327
And it's fast. You say that it is fast.

719
01:00:52,763 --> 01:00:55,438
I've tried to be truthful with you.

720
01:00:55,438 --> 01:01:01,634
I'm not going to stop now.
There's nothing more we can do.

721
01:01:01,635 --> 01:01:03,582
There's no treatment to it.

722
01:01:06,648 --> 01:01:07,986
I'm sorry.

723
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:15,965
They have washed hands off him.
We got to carry on for him.

724
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:18,481
Carry on, carry on.

725
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:21,157
We have to do a lot more than carry on.

726
01:01:21,796 --> 01:01:26,590
Vitamin B? Hydroxocobalamin? And steriods?

727
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:30,185
I haven't washed my hands off you, they're wrong.

728
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:32,910
You understand that they're wrong?
A lot of them!

729
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:33,883
You don't ever talk about his illness.

730
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:37,938
He doesn't speak about it.
We respect that it's simple really.

731
01:02:38,975 --> 01:02:44,937
What do you think of me?
I mean, what do you think that I should do?

732
01:02:44,938 --> 01:02:47,326
Sorry, that's not fair, don't answer, George.

733
01:02:49,086 --> 01:02:53,816
You probably think I should take myself off
back to Albans and look for a nice husband.

734
01:02:57,282 --> 01:03:00,527
I think it's terrific you don't talk about his illness.

735
01:03:21,573 --> 01:03:26,196
Blue lights are picking up the fluorescence you get in washing powder.

736
01:03:26,196 --> 01:03:29,324
That's why their shirts are luminated.

737
01:03:29,703 --> 01:03:31,517
Very strange.

738
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:33,267
Dresses are new.

739
01:03:33,667 --> 01:03:37,032
They haven't been washed so they are not fluorescent.

740
01:03:39,188 --> 01:03:42,617
Here you see? Great scientist. 

741
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:46,916
I can tell you all about how washing powders react dye in the blue lights.

742
01:03:46,917 --> 01:03:52,298
One of the great questions about the time or the [?] in the blue lights. Do you want to dance?

743
01:04:03,287 --> 01:04:05,485
I don't know what you should do.

744
01:04:06,754 --> 01:04:08,681
I know what he wants.

745
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:13,255
- House, garden, children with...
- A life together.

746
01:04:14,574 --> 01:04:15,969
He, impossible.

747
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:53,152
I have been thinking about Galileo
and what you said about him frightening people.

748
01:04:54,697 --> 01:04:58,741
Imagine what it must have felt like to be told that the sun didn't go round the Earth.

749
01:04:59,141 --> 01:05:01,323
Horrible, or the earth isn't flat.

750
01:05:01,324 --> 01:05:02,534
It is, isn't it?

751
01:05:02,935 --> 01:05:07,175
Flat, Jane. Don't tell me it isn't flat.

752
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:09,062
Oh, no, oh, no,

753
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:14,278
You looked me in the eye now and told me that 
it isn't flat and I don't know what I will do,

754
01:05:14,279 --> 01:05:21,330
I'll be inconsolable, totally death of it.

755
01:05:22,497 --> 01:05:23,624
Stephen!

756
01:05:33,017 --> 01:05:36,747
Did you have any idea what it might be? Did you think you knew?

757
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:40,364
Or was it just guessing?

758
01:05:40,365 --> 01:05:41,662
Is that what you're trying to say?

759
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:47,124
A Nobel Prize for guesswork?
Is that story you're after?

760
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:49,440
Let me tell you something, are we still fiming?

761
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,276
Good, good.

762
01:05:51,277 --> 01:05:56,958
In 1939, my mother and father put me on the a train
filled with the Jewish childern headed to England.

763
01:05:56,959 --> 01:05:58,296
Kinder transport.

764
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,250
Are you OK?

765
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:06,055
The Nazis were, letting some children go,
not the adults, just some children.

766
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:14,481
At the station, my mother looked into my face,
and said for me to looked out for my little brother,

767
01:06:14,482 --> 01:06:20,413
Not to let our suitcase out of my sight 
and don't lose your name tag, Arno Penzias here.

768
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:24,361
You lose your name tag,
you lose your name and you lose everything.

769
01:06:24,362 --> 01:06:25,261
And she went.

770
01:06:25,261 --> 01:06:27,818
How old were you?

771
01:06:27,819 --> 01:06:28,777
I was six.

772
01:06:28,778 --> 01:06:30,077
Did you see her again?

773
01:06:30,277 --> 01:06:32,542
I was six, my little brother was five.

774
01:06:35,649 --> 01:06:44,899
She didn't cry. She made like it was a normal thing,
and not crying was part of that.

775
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,647
Can you image how hard it must have been not to cry?

776
01:06:47,648 --> 01:06:52,190
To push your boys on a train like that and not to cry.

777
01:06:52,591 --> 01:06:55,018
I've hated suitcases ever since.

778
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:56,406
He likes to unpack.

779
01:06:59,403 --> 01:07:02,001
My mother and my father got out.

780
01:07:02,002 --> 01:07:05,268
Six month later we sailed for American together.

781
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:11,907
England saved my life.
America gave me a brand-new one.

782
01:07:12,705 --> 01:07:16,500
But I never, I never dreamed of this happening.

783
01:07:25,193 --> 01:07:30,405
We discovered this. We found this, we discovered this.

784
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,620
What it is?

785
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:47,979
This clock...

786
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:53,922
It's fine when I got it, when I went to America, it started to run backwards.

787
01:07:53,923 --> 01:07:57,069
Stops my students getting too complacent about that nature of time.

788
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,740
- I don't know why I came here...
- Listen to this, music.

789
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:15,203
Bach didn't finish it.

790
01:08:15,503 --> 01:08:17,139
He died before he finished it.

791
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,087
But it's so perfect.

792
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:25,456
Everything is done before it's so perfect... it doesn't end.

793
01:08:26,723 --> 01:08:30,433
You can here it after it stops. Listen.

794
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:47,425
Can you hear?

795
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,821
I'll see you in Cambridge.

796
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:43,481
I thought that was us.

797
01:09:45,069 --> 01:09:46,645
So did I.

798
01:09:46,646 --> 01:09:49,030
It wasn't.

799
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:50,619
No, it's them.

800
01:09:52,917 --> 01:09:57,071
Backwards now, we are having a time of it.

801
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:02,036
It is the platform. Platform one.

802
01:10:02,436 --> 01:10:06,968
It's never straight forward here,
you don't know what's going to happen next.

803
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,676
Sometimes I told my husband about it but he doesn't listen,

804
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:13,348
He just says: "it's Platform one, it's the Cambridge platform,"

805
01:10:13,349 --> 01:10:17,537
"Of course strange things are going to happen, it's the platform for Cambridge."

806
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:21,978
Nobody else knows if it's their platform, Cambridge...

807
01:10:21,979 --> 01:10:23,978
Backwards, Backwards.

808
01:10:23,978 --> 01:10:25,045
Yes.

809
01:10:25,345 --> 01:10:29,131
It reversed. Oh, of course it reversed, the direction of time.

810
01:10:29,809 --> 01:10:32,734
Yes. Are you in Cambridge time?

811
01:10:32,735 --> 01:10:36,691
Yes, and I love you deeply and forever!

812
01:10:42,762 --> 01:10:45,550
Roger! Roger!

813
01:10:56,134 --> 01:11:00,618
Roger Penrose! Stop!

814
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:07,613
Are you right?

815
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:09,583
What?

816
01:11:09,883 --> 01:11:12,039
What if Einstein was right.

817
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,151
About what?

818
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,148
Pencil! And some paper!

819
01:11:18,003 --> 01:11:19,300
Chalk?

820
01:11:20,838 --> 01:11:22,960
Time space diagram, what comes first?

821
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,313
Space? Time?

822
01:11:27,307 --> 01:11:32,835
You have to think about reversing the direction of time.
Time coming in the other way.

823
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:33,852
What, what for?

824
01:11:33,853 --> 01:11:35,427
Go on, don't stop, go on!

825
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:36,728
Um... now, the present dust?

826
01:11:36,728 --> 01:11:45,610
Here we are, looking back through time, light, dense matter in space.

827
01:11:45,611 --> 01:11:46,832
Wobbling space time?

828
01:11:46,832 --> 01:11:50,776
Causing the matter rays, bending the matter rays towards each other.

829
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,450
Look! The past is patching.

830
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:55,977
What are you saying?

831
01:11:56,177 --> 01:12:01,087
What if the whole of the universe was trapped in a region with no boundary, strenghth, is zero.

832
01:12:01,087 --> 01:12:02,910
The singularity? Nothingness?

833
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:10,237
Your theory. Works for collapsing.
Einstein, he proves that singularity must have existed,

834
01:12:10,237 --> 01:12:13,858
What if it works for this, it could only work, Roger, 
what would it mean if it did?

835
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:15,686
A collapse and reverse.

836
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:16,632
An explosion.

837
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:19,050
Bang!

838
01:12:52,235 --> 01:12:54,222
Sorry, what?

839
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:59,379
What are you saying?

840
01:13:09,842 --> 01:13:14,915
Write it down. Why don't you write it down?

841
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:25,718
Sorry, mate.

842
01:13:25,718 --> 01:13:27,344
Trinity Hall.

843
01:13:27,345 --> 01:13:31,857
Oh, right. What's the matter with him?

844
01:13:39,425 --> 01:13:41,322
Have you heard of Bishop Usher?

845
01:13:41,322 --> 01:13:42,823
Seventeenth century.

846
01:13:43,223 --> 01:13:46,276
He calculated the date of the start of the universe.

847
01:13:46,277 --> 01:13:47,411
How?

848
01:13:47,412 --> 01:13:50,570
By adding up all the ages of people in the Old Testament.

849
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:53,533
And how old is his universe?

850
01:13:53,534 --> 01:13:59,358
It started at some point in the night of the 22nd of October, 4004BC.

851
01:14:00,907 --> 01:14:03,400
- So old.
- So old.

852
01:14:15,371 --> 01:14:16,998
Something I want to ask you.

853
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:20,396
Where was I going when I saw you at the station?

854
01:14:20,397 --> 01:14:22,064
No.

855
01:14:24,135 --> 01:14:26,891
Stephen? Are you all right?

856
01:14:26,892 --> 01:14:29,040
Fine.

857
01:14:30,051 --> 01:14:36,672
The thing is... I was wondering...

858
01:14:36,673 --> 01:14:39,325
Whether you consider marrying me?

859
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,533
You probably want time to think about it.

860
01:14:44,533 --> 01:14:45,879
I love you.

861
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,317
Does that mean you're about to say no?

862
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:53,996
Time. Time to think.

863
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:21,007
Stephen.

864
01:16:20,983 --> 01:16:22,621
Not now, George.

865
01:17:26,848 --> 01:17:30,882
(This dissertation is my original work. S.W.Hawking)

866
01:18:15,408 --> 01:18:18,809
I'm thinking about time going in the oppsite direction.

867
01:18:18,809 --> 01:18:19,677
What?

868
01:18:21,753 --> 01:18:27,823
Singularities. A collapse, everything into nothing, yes?

869
01:18:28,223 --> 01:18:33,415
So reverse the time so the collapse is an explosion.

870
01:18:34,274 --> 01:18:36,460
Nothing into everything!

871
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:37,453
You're talking about stars?

872
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:40,220
No! No, I'm not talking about stars!

873
01:18:41,358 --> 01:18:44,883
I'm talking about the beginning of the universe.

874
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:52,501
That Roger Penrose, clever of me to find him.

875
01:18:53,502 --> 01:18:55,557
I've told you that you could help him.

876
01:18:55,557 --> 01:18:56,813
He helped himself, I think.

877
01:18:56,814 --> 01:18:58,772
That's your lovely talent.

878
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,800
- What?
- Your preposterous modesty.

879
01:19:42,654 --> 01:19:45,058
Here you are. Where have you been?

880
01:19:45,059 --> 01:19:48,613
Dennis Sciama wants to see you. He seemed very serious!

881
01:20:08,873 --> 01:20:13,175
The first three chapters, nothing special.

882
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:17,679
The forth...

883
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,451
Mozart.

884
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,850
Oh, hello. 

885
01:20:32,851 --> 01:20:34,172
Jane, women are not allowed.

886
01:20:34,173 --> 01:20:36,708
No, not allowed, against the rules.

887
01:20:37,727 --> 01:20:40,728
Ah, I'll go.

888
01:20:43,835 --> 01:20:44,558
Good-bye.

889
01:20:45,903 --> 01:20:54,656
I, er, I have to go and see the bursar for the keys. 
They've given me a fellowship.

890
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:58,248
Are you coming?

891
01:21:14,003 --> 01:21:18,170
And the same rule for everyone are keys. 
No special treatment when it comes to housing.

892
01:21:18,171 --> 01:21:19,649
I am not like all the rest.

893
01:21:20,469 --> 01:21:21,854
That's what they all say.

894
01:21:21,855 --> 01:21:25,223
Please listen to me, and listen very carefully.

895
01:21:25,462 --> 01:21:29,976
This man cannot walk upstairs.
His illness will not allow it, his illness will get worse.

896
01:21:29,977 --> 01:21:34,836
He needs housing with easy access, and you are going to find it for him because if you don't,

897
01:21:34,837 --> 01:21:37,452
All the newspapers will hear about how the bursar of this college 

898
01:21:37,453 --> 01:21:44,906
Treats a man of huge courage, brilliant mind 
and capacity to imagine fates like a piece of nothing,

899
01:21:44,907 --> 01:21:46,655
You understand me?

900
01:21:47,187 --> 01:21:49,104
And he is going to be my husband.

901
01:21:57,981 --> 01:22:02,165
What he's done is to make Einstein work.

902
01:22:02,565 --> 01:22:03,754
He has made Einstein.

903
01:22:05,364 --> 01:22:11,964
There's a word that physicists like to use very occacionally - beautiful.

904
01:22:13,423 --> 01:22:15,730
He has made Einstein beautiful.

905
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:19,206
Yes, but what, what has he done?

906
01:22:20,122 --> 01:22:26,682
Your son has opened up something
which I thought, we all thought, was closed.

907
01:22:27,940 --> 01:22:33,522
Einstein appeared to be predicting and then, he turned away.

908
01:22:33,522 --> 01:22:35,919
That could be the beginning.

909
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:42,520
The universe, may not always has been here.

910
01:22:45,646 --> 01:22:47,678
If you're right, which you are not,

911
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:51,739
There should be left some radiation from
the Big Bang and somebody should have heard it.

912
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:54,085
But they haven't, have they?

913
01:22:54,812 --> 01:22:56,193
I wonder why that could be?

914
01:22:56,193 --> 01:22:58,661
Could it be because it isn't there?

915
01:23:00,218 --> 01:23:04,169
Where's the fossil, Hawking? Where's the fossil?

916
01:23:19,826 --> 01:23:21,011
We have to go on.

917
01:23:22,938 --> 01:23:26,494
It connects. Do you understand?

918
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:31,926
Because it goes right through dark hole, right through childhood,

919
01:23:31,927 --> 01:23:35,862
Right through cockroaches and suitcases and right through America

920
01:23:35,863 --> 01:23:38,717
And the Ameriacan dream which I have lived.

921
01:23:40,611 --> 01:23:44,416
You understand me?

922
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:45,945
This noise.

923
01:23:46,964 --> 01:23:50,070
This god damn beautiful hiss.

924
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:53,107
It connects.

925
01:23:55,921 --> 01:24:00,092
It's the sound of the beginning of the time.

926
01:24:00,093 --> 01:24:03,883
The left over heat from the Big Bang.

927
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:07,855
The three degrees that hasn't cooled yet.

928
01:24:12,151 --> 01:24:15,109
It's everywhere. It's all around us.

929
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:17,438
It's fiften billion years old.

930
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:19,367
And we found it.

931
01:24:19,367 --> 01:24:21,362
That's our discovery.

932
01:24:26,723 --> 01:24:29,511
We have to go to get the Prize, Arno.

933
01:24:46,553 --> 01:24:48,222
What was that before the Big Bang?

934
01:24:48,222 --> 01:24:52,690
We don't know what it was, it wasn't time, space or matter.

935
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:54,101
There's room for God.

936
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:56,646
Yes, in theory.

937
01:24:58,113 --> 01:25:00,588
So what now?

938
01:25:00,589 --> 01:25:05,453
I'm going to eat cranberry and a huge number of chocolate truffles.

939
01:25:05,454 --> 01:25:10,666
And find very hard to get used to see
how wonderful Wagner is, 

940
01:25:10,667 --> 01:25:12,846
And how Brahms is not so wonderful.

941
01:25:12,847 --> 01:25:14,655
I meant with work!

942
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:19,416
The theories of everything I have been looking at are big.

943
01:25:18,603 --> 01:25:22,455
And now I want to look at the very small,

944
01:25:22,456 --> 01:25:27,717
And see how I may unify gravity and quantum mechanics.

945
01:25:27,718 --> 01:25:30,674
How long might in theory everything take?

946
01:25:30,675 --> 01:25:32,440
Twenty years no more than that.

947
01:25:32,441 --> 01:25:33,658
That fast.

948
01:25:34,624 --> 01:25:36,842
That fast.

949
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:41,484
I believe in the possible.

950
01:25:41,485 --> 01:25:47,530
I believe small though we are, insignificant though we maybe,

951
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:51,456
We can reach full understanding of the universe.

952
01:25:52,704 --> 01:25:57,776
You're right when you said you felt small 
looking out the dome down there.

953
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:01,410
We're very very small.

954
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:06,335
But we are profoundly capable of very very big things.

955
01:26:13,224 --> 01:26:14,662
Where are you going?

956
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:20,173
Things to do.

957
01:26:35,258 --> 01:26:38,066
Can you hear me?

958
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:49,184
Can you hear me?
