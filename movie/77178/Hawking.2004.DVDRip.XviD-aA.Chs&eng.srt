00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,960
肌肉得不到  就逐u萎s了
the muscles are not used, so they waste away, slowly.

277
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,060
要多久呢？
How slowly?

278
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:00,480
肌肉功能衰退е滤不再有\拥哪芰α
The muscle's wastage causes immobility.

279
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,650
要多久
How slowly?

280
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,210
@逐uc
It's gradual paralysis.

281
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,170
然後呢？然後怎N了？
And then? Then what?

282
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,720
用砗粑的肌肉（平滑肌）c其他肌肉不同，是不受大X控制的
The respiratory muscles unlike most of the other muscles，work automatically.

283
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,080
平滑肌能蜷Lrg拉o和S持力。@N肌肉
不S意志收s，意味著神系y自涌刂扑

284
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,830
-你是指呼吸  -
- Breathing. - Yes.

285
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,910
所以呼吸肌萎s得更慢
They don't waste away so quickly.

286
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,240
但也萎s，最K都萎s
But, but they do, they do, waste away.

287
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
是的
Yes.

288
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,580
所以呢？  我⒑粑不常
So what? I won't be able to breath properly，

289
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,950
最K我窒息
And then I won't be able to breath at all.

290
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,710
就像  就像溺水
So it's like, like drowning.

What about the brain? The brain itself?

I didn't know the answer.

301

he wanted to know the answer to his question very badly.

And I said: "Not to worry, I'll find out for you."

304
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,390
但我食言了
I never did.

305
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,300
你牟皇多愁善感的男人
You've never been a sentimental man, Frank.

306

嗯
No.

307

You have to know this is incredibly important.

rg不能作⒄瘴铮它不是^Φ
Time is not background thing, it is not absolute,

It's possible for a perfect star to collapse into nothingness.

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,330
他交由委T硇Φ
It should be referred by the committee but

686
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:25,410
但霍伊]那工夫
Hoyle doesn't have the time.

687
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:26,630
我能看看
Can I see it?

688
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,260
我得走了
I have to go.

689
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,220

Just give me a few moment.

690
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,100
我F在急的要走
I have to go now.

那就留在我@
Leave it with me.

692
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,470
好吧  但e...
OK, but don't...

693
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,260
怎N？我能吃了它
What? Eat it?

694
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,670
看完放我桌上
Just leave it on my desk.

695
00:47:41,930 --> 00:47:42,850
起的真早
Up early

696
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:45,780
你]事吧
Are you all right?

697
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:47,740

Fine.

698
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,530
你看上去像是昨晚玩得很high
You look like you have a wild night.

699
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,330
差不多吧
Something like that.

700
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:56,760
呃，今天下午去皇家科W院作蟾妫
So the Royal Society this afternoon?

701
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:00,290
你今天就要l表文
You are giving the paper today?

702
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:01,140

Yes.

703
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,150
您得史蒂芬・霍金吧
You, remember Stephen Hawking?

704

敦  皇家W院
1964年夏

我x予@理一新的公式
The new theory we have formulated

706
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,380
c我熟知的理有所不同
differs in its global implications from the usual theory,

707
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,330
在我所熟知的理中
in that, whereas, in the usual theory,

龇匠瘫壤常档呢
the negative sign of the the constant proportionality

在新的定xe  不存在@拥牟淮_定
In the new theory, there's no such ambiguity.

符必樨值，而且值的大小必和G(重力加速度)相等
The sign must be minus and further, that magnitude of G,

712
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,100
是由物|的平均密度而Q定的
follows on from a determination of the mean density of matter.

713
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,390
因此，一宇宙W家就能知道
Thereby enabling the cosmologist to know

你的算出e了
Your calculation is wrong.

718

The advanced field diverges.

719

高霾l散
The advanced field does not diverge.

720
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,120
不，我想他是的。  你全e了
No, I'm afraid it does. It's all wrong.

721
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,580
你能ff你是怎N知道的  年p人
Would you like to tell us how you know this, young man?

722
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,310
我算出砹
I worked it out.

723
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,720
你是在演v^程中算出淼
You worked it out dunning the lecture?

724
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,720
不  我之前就稍微看了下你的文
No, I had a previously shown only a glimpse of the paper.

725

有人指使你斫o我vy
Somebody's put you up to sabotaging me.

It's just wrong, that's all, I did say it, didn't I?

@理是e的
The physics is wrong!

731

你致锇颜文o他看
Why did you show him the paper?

732
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:10,790
我不想我的文o任何混蛋看（bugger有`者的意思）
I hate them being shown to any bugger.

733
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,540
科W不是唱大
Science isn't a theatre.

734
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,550
有人指出e`的
It needed to be said.

735

In that way?

736
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:33,400
我做你博Ф嗑昧
How long has it been since you started with me?

737
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:36,750
你不喜g我攻
You don't like the idea of me attacking

738
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:38,920
-恒B理  -你]回答我的}
- steady state theory. - You didn't answer my question.

739
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,990
因槟阕约壕椭С趾惴B理
Because you are a steady state man yourself.

740
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:44,400
好吧  我替你回答  十二月了
OK, I'll answer it for you. Twelve months.

741
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,510
所以我攻艉惴B理的想法...
So the idea of me attacking steady state...

742
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,860
我父H是_棉S的
My father ran a cotton mill.

743

When I was 21, I told him

744
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,370
我要做物理W家  他O度反Α
I wanted be a physicist, he hated the idea.

他他希望他的事I能蛟谖业氖种鞒邢氯ァ
He wanted me to take over the business from him.

746
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,050
所以他f除非我用W金自理
So he told me that I couldn't be a physicist

747
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,140
否t就e想物理W家
unless I got a fellowship to pay for it.

748
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,070
他以槲易霾坏
He thought I wouldn't get it.

他以槲抑皇侨分岫取Ｎ蚁窆芬勇淦堑仄疵
He thought I would buck. I worked like a dog...

750
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,830
@跟我攻艉惴BWf有什NPS
What is this to do with me attacking steady state?

751
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:12,070
我理解人生的道路上受阻的感X
I know what is it like to have obstacles in your path,

752
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,150
我知道吃]T羹的感受
I know what is it like to be told you can't do something,

753
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,340
@就是我去老的原因
that's why I became a teacher.

754
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,490
我永h不因橐庖不合
I would never ever stop a student of mine from pursuing something

755
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:23,860
而去阻K我的W生去追逐他的粝
because I didn't agree with their opinion.

756
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,890
永h不
Never.

757
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,080
我知道你除了明地攻e人能做更多
I know you can do more than make brilliant attacks on others.

758

Maybe the hiss is New York with it.

764

~s ？ 怎N是那？
New York? How?

765
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,840
我在想.世界上哪座城市能蜥放出
We figure that if any city in the world

766
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:24,680
三彷射的噪音
could give you three degrees of hot radio noise

767
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,030
那必是~so疑（Big Apple是~s的eQ）
it must be the Big Apple.

768
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,490
我自己家就找得出
My family alone could probably make the much of hiss.

769
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,630
我在猜有什N可能性
We were struggling the thing what else it could be.

770
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,430
你的猜想是？
You're guessing?

771

精密的天文y量呢
with that all man-made stuff around?

774
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,630
我把天指向~s市
We pointed the antenna the New York City.

775
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,130
所有的能量都分言诒边的地平
All that energy spread out across the northern horizon,

776
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,150
地Fl出的火花  l出的蜂Q

And I'm thinking, just maybe, just maybe, this town,

780
00:53:55,410 --> 00:53:59,510
可能就是3高l噪音的源^
this town of all towns might crank up three degrees of hiss!
