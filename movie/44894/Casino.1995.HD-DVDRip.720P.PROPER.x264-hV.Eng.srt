For politicians,
like our State Senator up there...

00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:00,756
everything was on the house.

331
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,850
These guys won their comped life
when they got elected.

Why not take advantage of it?

Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa...

who plays $30, 000 a hand in baccarat.

That's the one you really gotta watch.

337
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:21,004
He plays fast and big.
He has the cash and the credit...

to turn out your lights.

339
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,016
A year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

340
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:29,143
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million...

00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:33,019
and upstairs he takes free soap,
shampoo and towels.

who loved his free rooms...

free private jets
and $2 million of our money.

But we got him back.

345
00:19:42,966 --> 00:19:45,560
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

connecting with Japan.

a whole floor of rooms to himself.

he played small.

356
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:23,762
He bet $1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.

357
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:30,312
But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa...

358
00:20:30,414 --> 00:20:32,848
was that they can't bet small for long.

359
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,418
He didn't think of it as winning $10, 000...

360
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,977
he thought of it as losing $90, 000.

361

So, he upped his bets.

Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up $1 million of his own cash.

-for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.
-Help me fold these.

he told the bookies to fuck off.

We had to make an example of these pricks

I'm just curious.

-So, you're a righty.
-Yeah.

That's a lot of money

It's a caring from one person to another.

And if we could set up
some kind of foundation...

00:40:59,108 --> 00:41:01,542
based on that mutual respect...

709
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:05,239
I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me...

710

that I could live with that.

then what happens to me?

I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.

-1 230. Right.
-...secretaries.

1075
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:26,166
-Mint condition coins.
-Mint condition? All right.

1076
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:28,070
SAM: They all got a piece of the score.

1077
01:01:28,141 --> 01:01:29,631
MAN: Car's coming.

1078
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:33,644
[Energetic rock music]

1079
01:01:34,113 --> 01:01:36,081
SAM: They were very careful.

1080
01:01:36,149 --> 01:01:39,380
They always bypassed the alarms,
or else, if not...

1081
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:43,946
they'd drill enough holes to knock through
the walls with a sledgehammer.

1082
01:01:44,624 --> 01:01:47,388
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

1083
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:50,588
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1084
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:54,664
For Nicky,
Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.

1085
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,860
I just got a shipment of diamonds
from Israel.

1086
01:01:56,936 --> 01:02:00,895
NICKY: What the fuck did they
expect from me? I had to earn, didn't I?

1087
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:04,409
-This diamond has flaws in it.
-There's no flaws in it.

1088
01:02:04,477 --> 01:02:07,139
Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 25 years.

1089
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:10,943
You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws in this diamond.

1090
01:02:11,017 --> 01:02:12,746
NICKY: When we got local merch...

1091
01:02:12,818 --> 01:02:15,810
we'd usually send it to Palm Springs,
or Arizona, L.A.

1092
01:02:16,022 --> 01:02:18,923
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.

1093
01:02:18,991 --> 01:02:21,551
Are you gonna have a meeting
or buy some diamonds?

1094
01:02:21,627 --> 01:02:23,754
I know his language. I'm talking with him.

1095
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:25,729
$40,000, you buy the whole package.

1096
01:02:25,798 --> 01:02:27,925
$20,000. That's my final offer.

1097
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,993
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.

1098
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:38,341
NICKY: I actually turned my bedroom into
a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

1099
01:02:40,012 --> 01:02:43,573
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush
in case we got raided by the cops...

1100
01:02:43,649 --> 01:02:45,514
or if my crew got cute.

1101
01:02:46,018 --> 01:02:48,452
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1102
01:02:48,521 --> 01:02:51,513
She fell asleep on the couch
watching TV every night.

1103
01:02:51,624 --> 01:02:55,321
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

1104
01:02:55,394 --> 01:02:58,557
Actually, I couldn't,
because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.

1105
01:02:58,631 --> 01:03:01,429
The bosses were making
so much money with the casinos...

1106
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,526
that they didn't want anybody
making any waves.

1107
01:03:05,538 --> 01:03:08,029
You've all given your crew a piece of that?

1108
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:09,767
I took care of everybody.

1109
01:03:09,842 --> 01:03:14,745
NICKY: That's why there was no real
organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.

1110
01:03:14,847 --> 01:03:17,509
But how much cash could I bury
in my closet, right?

1111
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:19,676
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

1112
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,481
that in a venture of this kind...

1113
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:24,250
you must be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1114
01:03:24,423 --> 01:03:28,826
NICKY: I put some money in legitimate
deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1115
01:03:29,328 --> 01:03:31,853
-You will try to push it through, won't you?
-Yes.

1116
01:03:31,931 --> 01:03:34,331
You got to understand,
I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

1117
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,200
NICKY: Then I put more money
in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1118
01:03:38,271 --> 01:03:40,171
DOMINICK: Is that the last one?
COOK: Yeah.

1119
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,037
NICKY: I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it.

1120
01:03:44,277 --> 01:03:45,574
Fuckers.

1121
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:51,949
DOMINICK: Here you go, guys.

1122
01:03:52,018 --> 01:03:54,578
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it. Have a good time.

1123
01:03:54,687 --> 01:03:56,484
-Choke on it, motherfucker.
-Hi, Dom.

1124
01:03:56,555 --> 01:03:57,852
How you doing?

1125
01:03:57,923 --> 01:04:01,757
SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1126
01:04:01,927 --> 01:04:04,555
And over the years,
he always made money with them.

1127
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:08,066
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1128
01:04:08,134 --> 01:04:12,264
He had politicians, showgirls
and movie stars hanging out all over.

1129
01:04:12,638 --> 01:04:14,970
That show at The Flamingo
gets better and better.

1130
01:04:15,041 --> 01:04:18,636
By the way, Sammy said whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1131
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:21,509
-Made you a messenger, too?
-I'll do anything for a buck.

1132
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:24,777
-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.

1133
01:04:24,884 --> 01:04:28,650
SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls.

1134
01:04:28,754 --> 01:04:30,881
To them, Nicky was the movie star.

1135
01:04:30,956 --> 01:04:33,789
-You walk past me?
-This is Shelly.

1136
01:04:33,893 --> 01:04:35,884
-Hi, Shelly. How are you?
-Hi.

1137
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:37,485
This is Stacy.

1138
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,790
-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on.
-All right.

1139
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,562
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1140
01:04:43,636 --> 01:04:47,037
NICKY: Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1141
01:04:47,139 --> 01:04:50,438
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1142
01:04:50,509 --> 01:04:54,343
You can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1143
01:04:54,413 --> 01:04:57,405
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1144
01:04:57,483 --> 01:05:00,975
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1145
01:05:01,587 --> 01:05:04,852
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.

1146
01:05:04,957 --> 01:05:08,324
NICKY: It'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1147
01:05:08,494 --> 01:05:11,520
AL: I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1148
01:05:11,597 --> 01:05:14,828
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1149
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:17,026
-That's what I did.
-Yeah?

1150
01:05:17,336 --> 01:05:19,167
You call yourself a man?

1151
01:05:19,271 --> 01:05:23,640
You know you're a lying lowlife,
motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?

1152
01:05:23,709 --> 01:05:26,405
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1153
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:28,709
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...

1154
01:05:28,781 --> 01:05:30,806
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1155
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:34,375
You know your wife called Frankie
and told him the fucking heat's off?

1156
01:05:34,453 --> 01:05:36,921
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?

1157
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:38,581
-No, you didn't?
-I didn't.

1158
01:05:38,657 --> 01:05:42,184
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.

1159
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:45,627
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?

1160
01:05:45,698 --> 01:05:50,397
Tell me you gambled the money and
I'll give you the money to put the heat on!

1161
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:52,130
Did you gamble?

1162
01:05:56,409 --> 01:05:58,502
Fucking degenerate, you.

1163
01:05:58,978 --> 01:06:00,843
Fucking kids at home.

1164
01:06:04,183 --> 01:06:06,549
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

1165
01:06:07,052 --> 01:06:08,781
AL: Thanks, Nick.
NICKY: Yeah, thanks.

1166
01:06:08,854 --> 01:06:12,085
If I find out you fucked up,
I'll leave you where I find you.

1167
01:06:12,558 --> 01:06:15,220
NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat?
NICKY JR.: Two.

1168
01:06:15,928 --> 01:06:18,920
SAM: At around 6:30 a.m.,
when he finished his day...

1169
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:21,124
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1170
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,567
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1171
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:26,768
NICKY: I know you like this.

1172
01:06:26,839 --> 01:06:30,240
NICKY: A little butter, right?
Not a lot. You know why, right?

1173
01:06:30,743 --> 01:06:33,678
NICKY: Why?
NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1174
01:06:33,746 --> 01:06:35,839
What a smart kid you are.

1175
01:06:36,749 --> 01:06:37,943
NICKY: Okay, eat.

1176
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:40,986
NICKY: Every couple of weeks,
I sent Marino back to the bosses...

1177
01:06:41,053 --> 01:06:45,046
BACK HOME
with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?

1178
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:49,218
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1179
01:06:49,295 --> 01:06:51,195
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

1180
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,858
where Remo and the guys
used to hang out and count their millions.

1181
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:58,532
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.

1182
01:06:58,604 --> 01:07:00,538
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1183
01:07:00,606 --> 01:07:02,540
NICKY: I knew how to keep
the bosses happy.

1184
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:06,044
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message...

1185
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,569
I would carry things out to a "T."

1186
01:07:09,882 --> 01:07:14,012
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1187
01:07:14,086 --> 01:07:16,247
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1188
01:07:20,759 --> 01:07:23,592
Here's a fucking guy
who kills two of Remo's guys...

1189
01:07:23,662 --> 01:07:27,928
and a poor fucking waitress
who was just working on her night off.

1190
01:07:30,569 --> 01:07:33,834
This guy's just begging
to be made an example of.

1191
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:37,474
I want the names of all the other people
he had with him.

1192
01:07:37,576 --> 01:07:41,239
I don't care what you have to do to them
to get them. You understand?

1193
01:07:41,313 --> 01:07:43,144
FRANK: I'll take care of it.

1194
01:07:43,482 --> 01:07:46,747
NICKY: To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this fucking guy.

1195
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:49,617
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

1196
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:52,020
This son of a bitch was tough.

1197
01:07:52,291 --> 01:07:55,488
For two days and two nights,
we beat the shit out of him.

1198
01:07:55,594 --> 01:07:57,721
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

1199
01:07:57,796 --> 01:08:00,788
NICKY: Hope he gives me a name,
or I'll give him yours, Frank.

1200
01:08:00,866 --> 01:08:01,958
FRANK: Thanks a lot.

1201
01:08:02,034 --> 01:08:03,126
NICKY: But he never talked.

1202
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:05,193
NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.

1203
01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:08,536
NICKY: In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vice.

1204
01:08:08,874 --> 01:08:10,535
NICKY: Can you hear me?

1205
01:08:10,809 --> 01:08:13,710
Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.

1206
01:08:13,812 --> 01:08:17,942
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit
if you don't give me a name.

1207
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:20,417
NICKY: Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.

1208
01:08:20,486 --> 01:08:22,647
Don't make me be a bad guy.

1209
01:08:24,356 --> 01:08:25,687
Fuck you.

1210
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:28,919
Motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.

1211
01:08:28,994 --> 01:08:31,986
Fuck me? You motherfucker!

1212
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:34,794
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?

1213
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:36,562
You motherfucker!

1214
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:41,033
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!

1215
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,505
Charlie M.

1216
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:45,174
-Charlie M.
-Charlie M?

1217
01:08:45,477 --> 01:08:48,173
You make me pop your eye out your head...

1218

but I never seen him act like that
with anybody else.

1370
01:17:55,293 --> 01:17:58,456
I think he's crazy about you.
He really loves you.

I'm gonna go into a situation like this...

A lot of jewelry.

A lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?

You want to steal it?

1380

No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...

1381
01:18:27,425 --> 01:18:29,893
how much he would put
into a thing like that.

1382
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:32,828
I'm told it's worth about $1 million,
maybe more.

$1 million in jewelry.

1385

Does that tell you he is crazy about you?

1386

I should have never married him.

He's a Gemini. Triple Gemini. Duality.

01:26:38,883 --> 01:26:41,545
and the suitcases kept coming and going.

1520
01:26:42,186 --> 01:26:46,122
And let me tell you,
the fucking bottom line here is cash.

1521
01:26:48,393 --> 01:26:50,657
The only problem was that after a while...

1522
01:26:50,728 --> 01:26:54,960
the bosses noticed that
the suitcases were getting a little light.

1523
01:26:55,366 --> 01:26:57,891
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1524
01:26:57,969 --> 01:27:00,631
that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

1525
01:27:00,738 --> 01:27:02,569
Somebody's robbing from us?

1526
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:06,201
We go through all this fucking trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1527
01:27:06,611 --> 01:27:10,604
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.

1528
01:27:10,782 --> 01:27:13,307
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1529
01:27:13,384 --> 01:27:16,182
NICKY: Even John Nance,
that's the guy who ran the scam...

1530
01:27:16,254 --> 01:27:18,688
he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.

1531
01:27:18,756 --> 01:27:21,054
You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal...

1532
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:23,355
even if you take care of him real well...

1533
01:27:23,428 --> 01:27:25,589
he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.

1534
01:27:25,663 --> 01:27:27,597
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1535
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:31,192
You go try and make these hard-headed
old greaseballs understand that.

1536
01:27:31,269 --> 01:27:33,760
What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

1537
01:27:33,838 --> 01:27:36,568
It defeats the whole purpose
of what we're doing.

1538
01:27:36,641 --> 01:27:40,839
They take this money because they're
my guys, so give them some leeway.

1539
01:27:41,245 --> 01:27:43,577
NICKY: But the bosses never believed
in leeway...

1540
01:27:43,648 --> 01:27:45,411
so listen to what they do.

1541
01:27:45,483 --> 01:27:48,384
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C...

1542
01:27:48,453 --> 01:27:51,889
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1543
01:27:51,956 --> 01:27:53,389
BOSS: What were you doing?

1544
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,584
I was with my cumari.

1545
01:27:54,659 --> 01:27:56,684
BOSS: What were you doing
with your cumari?

1546
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:57,921
I gave her a schiaffo.

1547
01:27:57,995 --> 01:28:00,589
NICKY: The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

1548
01:28:00,665 --> 01:28:02,792
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1549
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:05,961
BOSS: What you been doing?
ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

1550
01:28:06,037 --> 01:28:08,471
NICKY: Little did anybody know
where this would lead.

1551
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:12,100
If they did, they would've
been better off making fucking novenas.

1552
01:28:12,176 --> 01:28:14,440
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

1553
01:28:14,512 --> 01:28:17,538
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?

1554
01:28:17,615 --> 01:28:21,483
I'm laying money out of my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

1555
01:28:21,552 --> 01:28:23,281
You gotta go back out there.

1556
01:28:23,354 --> 01:28:25,948
From now on,
I'm gonna start keeping records.

1557
01:28:26,023 --> 01:28:29,117
What are you gonna do with records,
pay taxes?

1558
01:28:29,193 --> 01:28:32,685
I can't keep laying out
my own fucking dough for these trips.

1559
01:28:32,830 --> 01:28:34,923
What the hell are we doing over here?

1560
01:28:34,999 --> 01:28:37,900
You're going to Las Vegas and having
a good time at my expense.

1561
01:28:37,969 --> 01:28:39,834
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

1562
01:28:39,904 --> 01:28:42,065
SAM: No matter how many
novenas you could make...

1563
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:44,700
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next at the casino.

1564
01:28:44,776 --> 01:28:47,768
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA: We made a deal.

1565
01:28:47,845 --> 01:28:50,313
SAM: It turned out Phil Green,
"Mr. Integrity"...

1566
01:28:50,381 --> 01:28:52,474
had a partner nobody knew about...

1567
01:28:52,550 --> 01:28:55,747
and when she showed up
and demanded money from Tangiers...

1568
01:28:55,853 --> 01:28:58,447
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.

1569
01:28:58,523 --> 01:28:59,922
ANNA: I'm not.
PHILIP: You are.

1570
01:28:59,991 --> 01:29:01,185
No, I am not wrong.

1571
01:29:01,259 --> 01:29:03,159
...Green tried to stonewall her.

1572
01:29:03,227 --> 01:29:05,695
ANNA: I will see that
you don't get away with this.

1573
01:29:05,763 --> 01:29:07,731
So, she sued him in court.

1574
01:29:07,832 --> 01:29:10,426
The court will now hear the matter
of Anna Scott...

1575
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:13,766
against Tangiers Corporation
and its President, Philip Green.

1576
01:29:13,838 --> 01:29:17,934
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1577
01:29:18,075 --> 01:29:21,101
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON: Thank you.

1578
01:29:21,212 --> 01:29:24,340
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1579
01:29:24,415 --> 01:29:26,110
We got a problem.

1580
01:29:29,587 --> 01:29:30,713
It didn't go too well.

1581
01:29:30,788 --> 01:29:32,380
Green has to open up the books...

1582
01:29:32,456 --> 01:29:34,856
has to show how he got the financing.

1583
01:29:34,926 --> 01:29:36,757
That's not good.

1584
01:29:40,565 --> 01:29:42,863
NICKY: She was doing pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1585
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:45,300
But before she could start
counting her money...

1586
01:29:45,369 --> 01:29:48,304
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1587
01:29:48,372 --> 01:29:50,033
So they sent me.

1588
01:30:06,257 --> 01:30:08,316
REPORTER: Any comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1589
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:09,689
What are you talking about?

1590
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:11,990
REPORTER: She was found last night
shot in the head.

1591
01:30:12,063 --> 01:30:14,156
MAN: Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1592
01:30:14,232 --> 01:30:16,325
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

1593
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:20,166
We were involved
in minor real estate deals many years ago.

1594
01:30:20,271 --> 01:30:22,432
It was never a partnership.

1595
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,807
MAN: Did you ever hear
of the.22 caliber killer?

1596
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:28,845
SAM: Now, Instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1597
01:30:28,913 --> 01:30:30,938
they started looking at Green, too.

1598
01:30:31,015 --> 01:30:33,677
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1599
01:30:33,751 --> 01:30:37,016
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1600
01:30:37,088 --> 01:30:38,521
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1601
01:30:38,589 --> 01:30:41,149
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1602
01:30:44,028 --> 01:30:46,428
Green's here about two or three times
a month...

1603
01:30:46,497 --> 01:30:49,591
and he's busy
with other real estate deals, and things.

1604
01:30:50,268 --> 01:30:52,930
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1605
01:30:53,437 --> 01:30:56,497
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board.

1606
01:30:57,108 --> 01:31:00,839
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1607
01:31:01,345 --> 01:31:03,575
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1608
01:31:03,648 --> 01:31:07,516
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1609
01:31:07,785 --> 01:31:09,776
when Mr. Green is away.

1610
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:13,823
You could say that.

1611
01:31:15,226 --> 01:31:16,921
PAT: Have you read this?

1612
01:31:17,061 --> 01:31:18,892
About Mr. Rothstein.

1613
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:22,563
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1614
01:31:22,667 --> 01:31:27,001
"says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

1615
01:31:27,538 --> 01:31:30,302
PAT: Do you believe that?
OFFICIAL: Did he really say that?

1616
01:31:30,374 --> 01:31:33,468
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.

1617
01:31:34,045 --> 01:31:37,037
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

1618
01:31:37,315 --> 01:31:39,579
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1619
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:42,619
Without getting your shorts in a knot,
would you do that?

1620
01:31:42,687 --> 01:31:46,589
And check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1621
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:49,424
PAT: Thank you.

1622
01:31:51,028 --> 01:31:54,259
A Gaming Control Board investigation
of Tangiers executive...

1623
01:31:54,332 --> 01:31:57,426
Sam Rothstein's application
for a gaming license is underway.

1624
01:31:57,501 --> 01:32:01,904
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

1625
01:32:02,006 --> 01:32:04,736
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro...

1626
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:07,709
could lose his ability
to work in the casino....

1627
01:32:08,245 --> 01:32:09,769
[Phone rings]

1628
01:32:11,315 --> 01:32:12,339
Hello?

1629
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:16,785
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker
right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?

1630
01:32:16,854 --> 01:32:19,049
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

1631
01:32:19,123 --> 01:32:20,181
NICKY: No, it's okay.

1632
01:32:20,257 --> 01:32:24,250
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible. It's booked up,
and it's very difficult to get in.

1633
01:32:24,328 --> 01:32:27,889
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.

1634
01:32:27,965 --> 01:32:29,262
All right.

1635
01:32:31,102 --> 01:32:34,663
The battle between state gaming
officials and Tangiers casino boss...

1636
01:32:34,739 --> 01:32:37,139
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

1637
01:32:37,241 --> 01:32:41,439
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's
attempt to get state licensing...

1638
01:32:41,545 --> 01:32:45,811
despite law-enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1639
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:50,281
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship
with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro...

1640
01:32:50,388 --> 01:32:53,050
keep Rothstein
from running the Tangiers casino?

1641
01:32:53,124 --> 01:32:57,151
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1642
01:32:57,228 --> 01:33:00,095
SAM: Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff?

1643
01:33:01,232 --> 01:33:03,393
Come on. Let me help you down.

1644
01:33:03,467 --> 01:33:04,900
We're talking about some stuff.

1645
01:33:04,969 --> 01:33:07,096
NEWSCASTER: At 6:00,
will a boyhood friendship...

1646
01:33:07,171 --> 01:33:09,571
unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers casino boss?

1647
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,575
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

1648
01:33:14,445 --> 01:33:16,970
Go down. Just go downstairs.

1649
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:25,782
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.

1650
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:28,324
It's just a political witch hunt.

1651
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:37,362
SAM: Do you want something to drink?

1652
01:33:37,435 --> 01:33:39,903
-Charlie, you want a refill?
-Yeah, that would be great.

1653
01:33:39,970 --> 01:33:43,428
I don't want nothing. Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.

1654
01:33:43,507 --> 01:33:46,305
-You're tougher to get than the President.
-I've been busy.

1655
01:33:46,377 --> 01:33:49,039
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

1656
01:33:49,113 --> 01:33:52,014
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1657
01:33:52,683 --> 01:33:57,120
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

1658
01:33:58,789 --> 01:33:59,813
Yeah.

1659
01:34:00,858 --> 01:34:02,826
I think I want my money back.

1660
01:34:03,894 --> 01:34:06,624
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1661
01:34:07,731 --> 01:34:11,223
I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

1662
01:34:11,969 --> 01:34:13,834
I think, in all fairness...

1663
01:34:13,904 --> 01:34:17,396
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

1664
01:34:17,708 --> 01:34:21,906
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

1665
01:34:22,546 --> 01:34:26,004
and walk in and see,
and if you don't have my money for me...

1666
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:29,575
I'll crack your fucking head
wide open in front of everybody.

1667
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:33,382
And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail...

1668
01:34:33,657 --> 01:34:36,649
hopefully, you'll be coming
out of your coma.

1669
01:34:37,394 --> 01:34:40,989
And guess what? I'll split
your fucking head open again.

1670
01:34:41,365 --> 01:34:45,165
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1671
01:34:45,336 --> 01:34:47,930
That's my business. That's what I do.

1672
01:34:49,006 --> 01:34:50,439
We know what you do.

1673
01:34:50,508 --> 01:34:52,874
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

1674
01:34:52,943 --> 01:34:54,342
You can't talk to me like that.

1675
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:55,708
NICKY: You fat Irish prick!

1676
01:34:55,779 --> 01:34:59,271
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.

1677
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:01,318
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1678
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:04,821
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.

1679
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:10,052
-You think he got the point?
-What are you doing?

1680
01:35:10,127 --> 01:35:13,790
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.

1681
01:35:13,898 --> 01:35:16,594
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

1682
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,702
-You're trying to tell me what to do?
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

1683
01:35:20,771 --> 01:35:23,467
You're way out of line. Where's your head?

1684
01:35:23,574 --> 01:35:26,236
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?

1685
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:31,043
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.

1686
01:35:31,115 --> 01:35:33,743
If you're acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

1687
01:35:33,817 --> 01:35:36,843
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me...

1688
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:38,821
you're gonna have to go my way.

1689
01:35:38,889 --> 01:35:42,620
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1690
01:35:42,693 --> 01:35:45,218
SAM: I got $100 million a year
going through the place.

1691
01:35:45,296 --> 01:35:48,060
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1692
01:35:48,132 --> 01:35:51,966
Believe me, if it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1693
01:35:52,036 --> 01:35:53,697
Forget about your fucking license.

1694
01:35:53,771 --> 01:35:57,138
I plant my own flag out here,
you ain't gonna need a license.

1695
01:35:58,776 --> 01:36:01,802
I don't know what it is,
but the more I talk to you...

1696
01:36:01,912 --> 01:36:05,006
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

1697
01:36:05,082 --> 01:36:07,983
-No, I don't want to come along with you.
-All right.

1698
01:36:08,052 --> 01:36:11,419
I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

1699
01:36:11,488 --> 01:36:13,979
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

1700
01:36:14,058 --> 01:36:15,889
I want everything quiet. That's it!

1701
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:18,224
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1702
01:36:18,295 --> 01:36:20,354
It's taken out of context. I had no control.

1703
01:36:20,431 --> 01:36:22,899
Ronnie and Billy will tell you
exactly what happened.

1704
01:36:22,967 --> 01:36:24,935
Back home that looks bad.

1705
01:36:25,002 --> 01:36:29,837
Looks bad? Every time you're on television,
I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1706
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,771
What the fuck happened to you?

1707
01:36:31,842 --> 01:36:34,572
-What happened to you? You lost control?
-I lost control?

1708
01:36:34,645 --> 01:36:37,205
You're fucking walking around
like John Barrymore.

1709
01:36:37,281 --> 01:36:41,945
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?

1710
01:36:42,019 --> 01:36:46,956
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat
people with disrespect. Even your own wife.

1711
01:36:47,691 --> 01:36:50,091
My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

1712
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:55,029
She was upset about a lot of things,
especially that Lester Diamond incident.

1713
01:36:55,766 --> 01:36:59,600
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?

1714
01:36:59,670 --> 01:37:02,002
No, that's not the fucking point.

1715
01:37:02,106 --> 01:37:04,939
The point is, she's upset,
and you've got a problem.

1716
01:37:05,009 --> 01:37:07,773
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out
of my personal life.

1717
01:37:07,845 --> 01:37:10,643
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

1718
01:37:10,781 --> 01:37:13,614
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?

1719
01:37:13,684 --> 01:37:16,983
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.

1720
01:37:17,154 --> 01:37:22,114
A week ago it was. Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.

1721
01:37:22,326 --> 01:37:25,227
Right, the way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

1722
01:37:25,296 --> 01:37:28,231
I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you did with this guy.

1723
01:37:28,299 --> 01:37:30,062
This guy's gonna run to the FBl.

1724
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:33,069
NICKY: Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.

1725
01:37:33,137 --> 01:37:35,901
SAM: I knew what he wanted
and I didn't want any part of it.

1726
01:37:35,973 --> 01:37:37,235
He wanted to take over.

1727
01:37:37,308 --> 01:37:42,143
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

1728
01:37:42,212 --> 01:37:46,012
He also stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

1729
01:37:50,521 --> 01:37:54,821
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.

1730
01:37:55,659 --> 01:37:58,890
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

1731
01:37:58,996 --> 01:38:02,830
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks
of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

1732
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:04,231
A lawyer.

1733
01:38:07,071 --> 01:38:08,368
They questioned Nicky.

1734
01:38:08,439 --> 01:38:11,840
When some guys who didn't pay
their shylocks began disappearing...

1735
01:38:11,909 --> 01:38:14,742
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.

1736
01:38:14,845 --> 01:38:18,781
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

1737
01:38:18,849 --> 01:38:20,544
There were never any witnesses.

1738
01:38:20,617 --> 01:38:24,417
NICKY: The coppers blamed me
for everything that went wrong.

1739
01:38:24,521 --> 01:38:26,682
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.

1740
01:38:26,757 --> 01:38:31,023
NICKY: If a guy tripped over
a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1741
01:38:31,095 --> 01:38:32,687
Be nice.

1742
01:38:32,763 --> 01:38:34,697
NICKY: The bosses were no better.

1743
01:38:34,765 --> 01:38:36,892
They complained because things
don't run smooth.

1744
01:38:36,967 --> 01:38:40,368
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1745
01:38:40,437 --> 01:38:42,530
I'm dealing with degenerate
animals out here.

1746
01:38:42,606 --> 01:38:44,540
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?

1747
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:47,042
They're sitting on their asses
drinking anisette.

1748
01:38:47,111 --> 01:38:49,477
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

1749
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:53,072
Fucking bosses think it's
a fucking free lunch out here.

1750
01:38:53,951 --> 01:38:57,318
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

1751
01:38:58,589 --> 01:39:00,113
You know about that?

1752
01:39:00,457 --> 01:39:01,754
I heard.

1753
01:39:01,959 --> 01:39:06,328
Everybody's talking about it and making
a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1754
01:39:06,397 --> 01:39:08,058
What are you gonna do?

1755
01:39:08,165 --> 01:39:09,757
That's no good.

1756
01:39:10,734 --> 01:39:14,568
Tell him to take care of things a little better.

1757
01:39:15,839 --> 01:39:17,067
I'll tell him, Remo.

1758
01:39:17,141 --> 01:39:19,541
NICKY: Fucking bosses
smoking their Di Nobilis...

1759
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:22,841
and eating trip' and fucking soffrit',
fried pigs' guts...

1760
01:39:22,946 --> 01:39:26,382
while if I wanna talk private,
I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.

1761
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:30,819
-What do they care? Long as I send money.
-They're complaining.

1762
01:39:30,921 --> 01:39:34,755
Let them complain. I'm the one
who's here. I do all the work.

1763
01:39:34,825 --> 01:39:38,352
NICKY: Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
FRANK: It's up to you.

1764
01:39:39,263 --> 01:39:41,823
NICKY: They want a fucking war? I'm ready.

1765
01:39:41,965 --> 01:39:46,368
If I take care of five of those guys,
the rest will fall into place.

1766
01:39:47,471 --> 01:39:49,962
NICKY: Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.

1767
01:39:50,674 --> 01:39:52,471
I see you, you motherfuckers.

1768
01:39:52,543 --> 01:39:56,206
SAM: Nicky was not only bringing heat
on himself, but on me, too.

1769
01:39:56,313 --> 01:40:00,875
The FBI watched every move he made,
but he just didn't care.

1770
01:40:00,984 --> 01:40:03,953
NICKY: If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch them back.

1771
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:07,115
I spent a few bucks. Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?

1772
01:40:07,191 --> 01:40:11,628
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment
from the same places that sell to the CIA.

1773
01:40:11,695 --> 01:40:16,655
I had all the special police frequency radios,
FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....

1774
01:40:17,534 --> 01:40:22,494
So, the miserable sons of bitches never
caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.

1775
01:40:23,006 --> 01:40:26,442
SAM: I got my job on the line,
he's having the time of his life.

1776
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:30,310
He has every cop in the state watching him,
and he's out playing golf.

1777
01:40:30,714 --> 01:40:33,478
And at the worst possible time for me.

1778
01:40:33,884 --> 01:40:38,253
I had my license hearing coming up and
I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1779
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:41,854
If I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

1780
01:40:41,925 --> 01:40:45,554
You've been very open with us
with the books and papers.

1781
01:40:45,662 --> 01:40:48,187
That'll mean a lot
when you go before the commission.

1782
01:40:48,265 --> 01:40:52,258
-All I ask is a fair hearing.
-This honesty will guarantee it.

1783
01:40:52,369 --> 01:40:53,461
[Plane engine sputtering]

1784
01:40:53,537 --> 01:40:55,334
We'll move on to....

1785
01:40:56,673 --> 01:41:00,370
SAM: I want to hear about Kansas City.

1786
01:41:01,879 --> 01:41:03,779
What the fuck is this?

1787
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:08,851
Where's this fucking guy gonna land,
in the fairway?

1788
01:41:28,705 --> 01:41:31,401
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.

1789
01:41:33,076 --> 01:41:35,704
SAM: The Feds were watching
Nicky play golf for so long...

1790
01:41:35,779 --> 01:41:37,610
they ran out of gas.

1791
01:41:38,549 --> 01:41:42,212
Just what I needed,
right in front of the control board.

1792
01:41:46,490 --> 01:41:49,220
$100, whoever hits the plane.

1793
01:41:51,461 --> 01:41:53,656
SAM: If things weren't bad enough...

1794
01:41:53,764 --> 01:41:55,857
in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

1795
01:41:55,933 --> 01:41:59,494
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City
where they brought the suitcases.

1796
01:41:59,570 --> 01:42:02,664
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?

1797
01:42:02,739 --> 01:42:06,505
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1798
01:42:06,577 --> 01:42:08,408
SAM: He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1799
01:42:08,478 --> 01:42:12,676
but he mostly complained about his trips
to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.

1800
01:42:12,749 --> 01:42:16,116
You gotta lay down the law,
or they'll make a fool out of you.

1801
01:42:16,186 --> 01:42:19,781
I write it all down.
Every fucking nickel goes down.

1802
01:42:19,856 --> 01:42:23,758
-What's the matter with you?
-Everything's here.

1803
01:42:23,827 --> 01:42:25,920
-Since when do you talk like that?
-I'm sorry.

1804
01:42:25,996 --> 01:42:30,262
Nance gives me trouble, I'll
take the eyes out of his freaking head.

1805
01:42:30,334 --> 01:42:32,734
-Again.
-I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."

1806
01:42:32,803 --> 01:42:34,395
-That's enough.

you can't believe it.

1808

Who'd believe the FBI
had a wire in the place...

looking for information
about some old homicide...

1810
01:42:41,812 --> 01:42:45,407
about some guy who was whacked out
God knows when over God knows what?

1811
01:42:45,482 --> 01:42:48,542
What prevents him with the suitcases
from taking what he wants?

1812
01:42:48,619 --> 01:42:52,612
Nance brings back two suitcases from
the Tangiers. What about three or four?

1813
01:42:52,689 --> 01:42:55,624
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.

We can't even go into the count room
to watch our money.

He's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together.

1816
01:43:04,701 --> 01:43:07,932
I'll find out. If it's Green himself,
I'll bury that bastard.

1817
01:43:08,005 --> 01:43:10,473
I never trusted him.
I got eyes behind my head.

1818
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:12,405
They trust that scumbag. I don't.

1819

I'll hit the two of them
in the head with a shovel.

I know, but that's enough.

You know what they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.

they hear all this stuff...

01:43:31,828 --> 01:43:35,093
about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases...

of the Commission...

Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

1839

SAM: When the day finally came, I was ready.

1840
01:44:15,038 --> 01:44:18,701
I felt so confident that all I had
to do was present my case.

COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of
which is a report by retired FBl agents...

1842
01:44:23,447 --> 01:44:26,575
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

denying the Rothstein application.

Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

Do I have a vote on the motion?

-You have to be kidding.
-Adjourned? What do you mean?

1852
01:44:49,906 --> 01:44:54,400
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBl reports.

1853
01:44:54,578 --> 01:44:59,538
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?

1854
01:44:59,750 --> 01:45:03,345
SENATOR: I was never your guest.
SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?

1855
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:05,752
I don't comp you
at least three times a month?

1856
01:45:05,822 --> 01:45:08,086
I'd like to answer that at this time.

1857
01:45:08,291 --> 01:45:11,727
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

1858
01:45:11,795 --> 01:45:15,788
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.

1859
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:16,991
Was I at the dinner?

SENATOR: You were in the building.
SAM: I was in the building?

1863
01:45:24,975 --> 01:45:28,911
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.

1864
01:45:29,513 --> 01:45:31,640
Did you not?

1865
01:45:33,450 --> 01:45:36,749
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.

SAM: Give me that much at least!

A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

1869
01:45:48,465 --> 01:45:51,923
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1870
01:45:52,002 --> 01:45:54,994
accused top gaming officials of corruption.

1871
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:57,972
...promised me a fair hearing
when you were comped at my hotel?

1872
01:45:58,041 --> 01:46:01,602
And you asked for copies of your bill
to put on your expense account.

1873
01:46:01,678 --> 01:46:04,738
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming
license denial...

1874
01:46:04,815 --> 01:46:05,873
Bullshit!

1875
01:46:05,949 --> 01:46:07,143
...Rothstein followed several...

1876
01:46:07,217 --> 01:46:10,914
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

1877
01:46:10,987 --> 01:46:13,615
until his own lawyers and friends
urged him to leave.

1878
01:46:13,690 --> 01:46:17,683

of running Tangiers without a license...

if someone with Rothstein's history...

a top gaming post.

are friends of ours.

What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

1888
01:46:44,754 --> 01:46:47,086
Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

1889
01:46:47,157 --> 01:46:49,648
Won't be the best,
but what are we gonna do?

quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

You don't have to send me any questions.

taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

He's out of his fucking mind.

It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

through the nose. Such is life.

maybe it's time he should quit.

1930
01:49:36,726 --> 01:49:39,456
SAM: First, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

1931
01:49:39,529 --> 01:49:43,226
SAM: We're on the list to be heard before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

1932
01:49:43,333 --> 01:49:45,631
These guys don't care
about the Supreme Court.

1933
01:49:45,702 --> 01:49:48,728
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

1934
01:49:48,805 --> 01:49:53,765
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?

1935
01:49:53,943 --> 01:49:56,878
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1936
01:49:56,946 --> 01:49:59,779
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

1937
01:49:59,849 --> 01:50:02,716
Not only should you quit, you should run.

1938
01:50:02,786 --> 01:50:07,280
Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.

1939
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:09,221
How the fuck does that help?

1940
01:50:09,726 --> 01:50:12,217
The heat he brought down is murder.

1941
01:50:12,295 --> 01:50:14,593
The police department was cooperative.

1942
01:50:14,697 --> 01:50:17,029
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.

1943

What do you do about that?

1944
01:50:18,468 --> 01:50:21,528
-What are you proposing?
-I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1945
01:50:21,604 --> 01:50:24,505
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?

1946
01:50:24,574 --> 01:50:27,304
-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
-If he took a break...

1947
01:50:27,377 --> 01:50:29,368
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1948
01:50:29,446 --> 01:50:33,382
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

1950

I can't do that.

1951
01:50:39,823 --> 01:50:44,157
SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home,

to get around anymore.

02:19:20,297 --> 02:19:22,663
-Just do it.
-Fine.

SAM: Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2395
02:19:49,593 --> 02:19:52,653
All right. I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.

2396

Who were you with?

2397
02:20:02,606 --> 02:20:04,437
I was with somebody.

2398
02:20:04,842 --> 02:20:07,777
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?

2399
02:20:15,786 --> 02:20:19,278
I just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

2400
02:20:21,425 --> 02:20:23,518
I just hope it's not that.

2402
02:20:29,166 --> 02:20:32,761
Yeah, she did what she did,
and I did what I had to do, but...

2403
02:20:32,836 --> 02:20:36,328
Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing
she could have done.

2404
02:20:37,141 --> 02:20:38,836
What if he won't stop?

2405
02:20:38,943 --> 02:20:41,036
SAM: It could get us both killed.

2406
02:20:41,545 --> 02:20:43,342
I can back him off.

2407

SAM: She was very convincing
when she wanted to be.

2408
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:52,645

Hey, Ginger.

2411

Don't forget, if you're challenged...

2412
02:21:04,301 --> 02:21:06,701
if he asks anything, deny everything.

2413
02:21:06,804 --> 02:21:10,035
You understand? I don't want him
bringing beefs back home.

2414
02:21:10,240 --> 02:21:13,175
That could really cause a serious problem.

2415
02:21:13,243 --> 02:21:15,404
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?

2416

You hear what I'm saying, right?

2417

I know. You don't have to tell me that.

so fucked up on the streets...

2422
02:21:33,864 --> 02:21:38,096
that every time Marino went back home,
the packages got smaller and smaller.

2423
02:21:40,371 --> 02:21:42,805
It got to the point,
when he walked into the place...

2424
02:21:42,873 --> 02:21:45,637
he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.

REMO: Frankie, I want to ask you something.

2426

It's private.

2427
02:21:50,547 --> 02:21:52,742
But I want you to tell me the truth.

2428
02:21:52,883 --> 02:21:54,544
Of course, Remo.

2429
02:21:55,019 --> 02:21:57,510
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.

2430
02:21:58,956 --> 02:22:01,356
I always tell you the truth, Remo.

2431
02:22:01,925 --> 02:22:04,519
Frankie, the little guy...

2432
02:22:04,595 --> 02:22:06,893
he wouldn't be fucking
the Jew's wife, would he?

2433
02:22:06,964 --> 02:22:10,024
Because if he is, it's a problem.

2434
02:22:12,970 --> 02:22:14,528
FRANK: What could I say?

2435
02:22:14,605 --> 02:22:16,539
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...

2436
02:22:16,607 --> 02:22:20,805
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them
could have wound up getting killed.

2437
02:22:20,944 --> 02:22:23,606
Because there's one thing
about these old-timers.

2438
02:22:23,681 --> 02:22:26,775
They don't like any fucking around
with the other guys' wives.

2439
02:22:26,850 --> 02:22:28,442
It's bad for business.

2440
02:22:28,519 --> 02:22:32,148
So I lied, even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi...

2441
02:22:32,256 --> 02:22:34,781
I could wind up getting killed, too.

I know. That's why I'm asking.

You see, my main concern is Nicky.

2447
02:22:51,508 --> 02:22:55,000
I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

-He's good, he's fine.
-I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

-Do it for me.
-No problem.

2450

anything for our friends.

Frankie, you're a good boy.

2454
02:23:15,566 --> 02:23:16,897
Thanks, Remo.

SAM: By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.

2456
02:23:20,003 --> 02:23:22,028
Vegas really got to him.

2457

The booze, the coke, the broads.

2458
02:23:26,543 --> 02:23:28,477
I mean, he got sloppy.

2459
02:23:28,979 --> 02:23:30,970
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

2460

FRANK: You must've drank too much.
NICKY: Fuck yourself.

2461
02:23:33,584 --> 02:23:35,984
SAM: One night, he had to belt a guy
three times...

2462
02:23:36,053 --> 02:23:38,021
before the guy finally went down.

2463
02:23:38,088 --> 02:23:40,648
In the old days,
Nicky would've decked him with one shot.

You add this into the mix....

His crew followed him right over the edge.

2467
02:23:48,332 --> 02:23:51,199
They were all tuned up half the time
on coke.

2468
02:23:51,268 --> 02:23:54,237

-Police! Stay in the car!

to keep his mouth shut.

COP: Drop the gun!
BLUE: Fuck you!

2472

SAM: The cops shot Blue...

2473
02:24:08,852 --> 02:24:12,117
because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.

2474
02:24:12,222 --> 02:24:14,520
They could have been right,
but who knows?

2475

He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.

2476

and started shooting up the cops' houses.

2483
02:24:44,955 --> 02:24:48,584
It got to the point where they couldn't
talk in the Gold Rush anymore...

2484
02:24:48,659 --> 02:24:50,718
because the Feds put a wire in the wall.

2485
02:24:50,794 --> 02:24:53,786

they had to cover their mouths...

No matter what the Feds or the papers
said about my car bombing...

2835
02:46:23,352 --> 02:46:25,513
it was amateur night, you could tell.

2836
02:46:25,588 --> 02:46:29,285
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite
under the passenger side.

2837
02:46:29,391 --> 02:46:33,293
But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew...

2838
02:46:33,395 --> 02:46:38,196
was that, that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver's seat.

2839
02:46:38,601 --> 02:46:41,365
It's the only thing that saved my life.

2840
02:46:53,415 --> 02:46:57,647
The bombing was never authorized,
but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.

2841
02:46:59,121 --> 02:47:00,986
So did the powers that be.

But finally, my guys got out on bail.

2845
02:47:07,663 --> 02:47:11,224
The bosses wanted me to send
my brother Dominick out to Vegas.

2846
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:14,428
Always the fucking dollars.

2847
02:47:14,737 --> 02:47:18,298
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go
near Vegas.

2848
02:47:18,407 --> 02:47:21,171
So I set up a meeting
with the guys way out in the sticks.

They had enough.

made an example of him and his brother.
