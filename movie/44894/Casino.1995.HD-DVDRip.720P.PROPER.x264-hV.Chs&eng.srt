当你爱一个人，你必须相信他
SAM: [Voiceover] When you love someone,abcyou've gotta trust them.

别无它法
There's no other way.

00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,207
你得将掌管生命中一切的那把钥匙给他
You've got to give them the keyabcto everything that's yours.

00:01:00,341 --> 00:01:01,799
要不然有什么意义？
Otherwise, what's the point?

00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:08,380

00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,731
老实说，没人知道细节…
NICKY: [Voiceover] In fact,abcnobody knew all the details...

23
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,412
原本应该很完美的

原本应多完美
It should've been so sweet, too.

But at night, you couldn't seeabcthe desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

34
00:04:28,749 --> 00:04:32,118
但城里许多的问题却都是在沙漠里解决的
But it's in the desert where lotsabcof the town's problems are solved.

35
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:34,253
沙漠里的坑洞可多着呢
NICKY: Got a lot of holes in the desert...

36
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,753
里面埋藏了很多问题

只是程序要对
Except you gotta do it right.

38
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:40,927
你得先把洞挖好…
You gotta have the hole already dug...

39

再将货从汽车后车箱载来
before you show upabcwith a package in the trunk.

40
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,217

他不知道我们是好兄弟

他非常抱歉

尤其是当他在城里越来越出名后

罗斯坦先生就可以了

This is the only town in the countryabcwhere a bookie joint is legit.

947

为什么不加以利用呢？

所以他把签注从街上…

949
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,331
开到赌场内

你一定得去
You're gonna do it.

1518

[Ginger sobbing]

1520

我试
I'll try.

1521
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:15,356
我会的
GINGER: I will.

1522
01:26:16,495 --> 01:26:18,535
别生我气，好吗？
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1523
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:33,432
不管在计算室外有多少问题…
NICKY: No matter whatabcthe problems were outside the count room...

1524
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:35,642
都是值得的
it was all worth it.

1525
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:38,273
现金滚滚而来…
The cash kept rolling in...

1526
01:26:39,362 --> 01:26:41,401
皮箱也不停的进出
and the suitcases kept coming and going.

1527
01:26:42,574 --> 01:26:46,737
让我告诉你abc除了钱还是钱
And let me tell you,abcthe fucking bottom line here is cash.

1528
01:26:48,706 --> 01:26:50,912
唯一的问题是过了一阵子后…
The only problem was that after a while...

1529
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:54,576
老大们发觉皮箱越来越轻
the bosses noticed thatabcthe suitcases were getting a little light.

1530
01:26:55,838 --> 01:26:58,293
等一下，你是说…
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1531
01:26:58,383 --> 01:27:00,838
我们抢的钱被人抢？
that the money we're robbingabcis being robbed?

1532
01:27:01,052 --> 01:27:02,843
有人抢我们？
Somebody's robbing from us?

1533
01:27:03,054 --> 01:27:06,138
我们这么大费周章abc竟有人在抢我们？
We go through all this fucking troubleabcand somebody's robbing us?

1534
01:27:06,808 --> 01:27:11,019
如我所说，这就是这行的一部分abc就当做是遗漏的
Like I said, it's part of the business.abcIt's considered leakage.

1535
01:27:11,105 --> 01:27:13,477
遗漏，狗屁abc我要找到抢我们的人
Leakage, my balls.abcI want the guy who's robbing us.

1536
01:27:13,607 --> 01:27:16,276
就连约翰南斯abc主导这骗局的人…
NICKY: Even John Nance,abcthat's the guy who ran the scam...

1537
01:27:16,402 --> 01:27:18,441
都知道自己无能为力去阻止
he knew there wasn't muchabche could do about it.

1538
01:27:18,571 --> 01:27:20,859
你得知道一个肯帮你偷钱的人…
You gotta know thatabca guy who helps you steal...

1539
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:23,107
就算你把他照顾得好好的…
even if you take care of him real well...

1540
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,486
他还是为自己多偷一点
he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.

1541
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:27,737
很合理不是吗？
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1542
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:31,407
试着让这些固执的老头们了解吧
You go try and make these hard-headedabcold greaseballs understand that.

1543
01:27:31,585 --> 01:27:33,873
如果自己抽完还要被别人抽abc还有什么意义？
What's the point of skimmingabcif we're being skimmed?

1544
01:27:34,004 --> 01:27:36,577
这样我们根本就在做白工嘛
It defeats the whole purposeabcof what we're doing.

1545
01:27:36,966 --> 01:27:41,343
他们是我的手下才帮我们拿钱abc就睁只眼闭只眼吧
They take this money because they'reabcmy guys, so give them some leeway.

1546
01:27:41,471 --> 01:27:44,044
但老大们从来就不相信这理论…
NICKY: But the bosses never believedabcin leeway...

1547
01:27:44,182 --> 01:27:45,724
听听他们做了什么
so listen to what they do.

1548
01:27:45,851 --> 01:27:48,721
他们将艾题派斯康abc堪萨斯市的二佬…
They put Artie Piscano,abcthe underboss of K. C...

1549
01:27:48,812 --> 01:27:52,311
调来管理abc确定没有人抽头

1550
01:27:52,441 --> 01:27:54,896
-你那时在干嘛？abc-我与我马子一起
BOSS: What were you doing?

1551
01:27:53,458 --> 01:27:54,584
I was with my cumari.

1552
01:27:54,985 --> 01:27:58,188
-你跟你马子那时在干嘛？abc-我打她一巴掌
BOSS: What were you doingabcwith your cumari?

1553
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:57,921
I gave her a schiaffo.

1554
01:27:58,322 --> 01:28:00,860
问题是，派斯康是个麻烦
NICKY: The only trouble was,abcPiscano was a disaster.

1555
01:28:00,992 --> 01:28:03,068
这家伙连泡咖啡都可搞砸
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1556
01:28:03,203 --> 01:28:06,239
-你都在干嘛？abc-我在那儿的时间比在这儿多
BOSS: What you been doing?abcARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

1557
01:28:06,373 --> 01:28:08,745
当时没人想到abc后来会演变为何
NICKY: Little did anybody knowabcwhere this would lead.

1558
01:28:08,875 --> 01:28:12,291
若有人早知道abc去做念珠可能都还好些
If they did, they would'veabcbeen better off making fucking novenas.

1559
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:14,746
你得回去跟那家伙讲
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

1560
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,710
-我上次的花费都还没补给我abc-什么花费？
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.abc-What expenses?

1561
01:28:17,844 --> 01:28:21,758
我一直自掏腰包abc却什么都拿不回来
I'm laying money out of my own pocket,abcand I never get anything back.

1562
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:23,348
你得再回去
You gotta go back out there.

1563
01:28:23,433 --> 01:28:25,971
从今开始abc我得开始做记录了
From now on,abcI'm gonna start keeping records.

1564
01:28:26,353 --> 01:28:29,389
你要记录干嘛，缴税吗？
What are you gonna do with records,abcpay taxes?

1565
01:28:29,523 --> 01:28:32,974
我不能一直这样自己出钱abc跑来跑去
I can't keep laying outabcmy own fucking dough for these trips.

1566
01:28:33,152 --> 01:28:35,144
我们他妈的到底在那儿干嘛？
What the hell are we doing over here?

1567
01:28:35,279 --> 01:28:38,196
我花钱让你去赌城玩
You're going to Las Vegas and havingabca good time at my expense.

1568
01:28:38,324 --> 01:28:40,197
我靠，我是说…
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

1569
01:28:40,326 --> 01:28:42,318
不论你做了几符念珠…
SAM: No matter how manyabcnovenas you could make...

1570
01:28:42,412 --> 01:28:45,117
都无法阻止接下来abc在赌场发生的事
nothing was gonna stopabcwhat came up next at the casino.

1571
01:28:45,206 --> 01:28:47,661
-我不相信你会这样做abc-我们有协议
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this.abcANNA: We made a deal.

1572
01:28:48,335 --> 01:28:50,908
结果菲立浦葛林，   “老实先生”…
SAM: It turned out Phil Green,abc"Mr. Integrity"...

1573
01:28:51,004 --> 01:28:52,747
有个没人知道的搭挡…
had a partner nobody knew about...

1574
01:28:52,881 --> 01:28:56,047
当她出现并向坦吉乐要钱时…
and when she showed upabcand demanded money from Tangiers...

1575
01:28:56,177 --> 01:28:58,715
-你为什么这样对我？abc-因为你错了
-Why are you doing this to me?abc-Because you're wrong.

-我没错abc-你有
ANNA: I'm not.abcPHILIP: You are.

1577
01:29:00,348 --> 01:29:01,510
不，我没错
No, I am not wrong.

1578
01:29:01,599 --> 01:29:03,259
葛林试着搪塞她
...Green tried to stonewall her.

1579
01:29:03,434 --> 01:29:05,889
我不会这么轻易的放过你的
ANNA: I will see thatabcyou don't get away with this.

1580
01:29:06,104 --> 01:29:07,728
所以她一状告到法庭去
So, she sued him in court.

1581
01:29:07,856 --> 01:29:10,477
本庭现在将开始审理abc安娜史考特…

against Tangiers Corporationabcand its President, Philip Green.

1583

-葛林先生将由欧伯伦辩护abc-安娜史考特的律师则是罗根
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.abcLOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1584
01:29:18,409 --> 01:29:20,615
-欧伯伦先生，可以开始了abc-谢谢，大人
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.abcOBERON: Thank you.

1585

我觉得判决很公正abc而我也对判决非常满意
I believe he was fair,abcand I'm delighted with the decision.

1586
01:29:24,749 --> 01:29:26,077
有麻烦了
We got a problem.

1587
01:29:29,921 --> 01:29:32,672
官司结果不理想，葛林得呈交帐簿…
It didn't go too well.

1588
01:29:30,788 --> 01:29:32,380
Green has to open up the books...

1589
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:35,172
他得解释钱是怎么来的
has to show how he got the financing.

1590
01:29:35,261 --> 01:29:37,218
这可不好
That's not good.

1591
01:29:40,892 --> 01:29:43,015
她官司还打得不错
NICKY: She was doing pretty goodabcwith her lawsuit.

1592
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:45,183
但在钞票还未落入她口袋之前…
But before she could startabccounting her money...

1593
01:29:45,313 --> 01:29:48,516
老家的老头子们就已决定庭外和解
the boys back home decidedabcto settle the case out of court.

1594
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:49,848
因此他们派我
So they sent me.

1595
01:30:06,169 --> 01:30:08,541
你对安娜史考特的谋杀abc有什么想法吗？
REPORTER: Any comment onabcthe murder of Anna Scott?

1596

-你在说什么？abc-她昨晚被人发现中弹身亡
What are you talking about?

REPORTER: She was found last nightabcshot in the head.

1598
01:30:12,301 --> 01:30:14,127
只是有关房地产合伙问题吗？
MAN: Was this justabca real estate partnership?

1599
01:30:14,261 --> 01:30:16,052
她的律师说你们是搭挡
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

1600
01:30:16,764 --> 01:30:20,382
我们是在多年前abc在一些小房地产交易上合作过
We were involvedabcin minor real estate deals many years ago.

1601
01:30:20,476 --> 01:30:21,804
称不上是搭挡
It was never a partnership.

1602
01:30:23,271 --> 01:30:26,106
你听过.22口径杀手吗？
MAN: Did you ever hearabcof the.22 caliber killer?

1603
01:30:26,274 --> 01:30:28,895
现在条子不只是盯尼奇…
SAM: Now, Instead of the copsabconly looking at Nicky...

1604
01:30:28,985 --> 01:30:30,894
他们也开始盯葛林
they started looking at Green, too.

1605
01:30:31,029 --> 01:30:33,602
他本是我们的正派门面
And he was supposed to beabcour squeaky-clean front man.

1606
01:30:33,782 --> 01:30:36,866
我得接受访问abc让大家都知道…
I had to start giving interviewsabcto make sure everybody knew...

1607
01:30:36,952 --> 01:30:38,529
赌场没有牵涉到案子
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1608
01:30:38,662 --> 01:30:40,904
你多常帮他代班？
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1609
01:30:44,377 --> 01:30:46,749
葛林一个月大约来个两、三次…
Green's here about two or three timesabca month...

1610
01:30:46,838 --> 01:30:49,874

and he's busyabcwith other real estate deals, and things.

1611
01:30:50,634 --> 01:30:52,792
所以葛林不在时abc你就是老大罗？
So in Green's absence,abcthen, you're the boss?

1612

So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1615

可以这么说吧…
Well, in a sense, you could sayabcthat I am the boss...

我不知道，得查查

How you gonna get fittedabcfor 25 suits in three days?

2236
02:07:55,907 --> 02:07:57,946
怎么可能量得那么快？
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

2237
02:07:58,034 --> 02:08:00,607
我付两倍的钱都不可能那么快
I can't get fitted that fast,abcand I pay twice as much.

2238
02:08:01,204 --> 02:08:02,662
我还帮他买了只表
I bought him a watch, too.

2239
02:08:04,624 --> 02:08:08,372
就算是买了只好表abc一只他认为是好的表…
But even if you bought him a really niceabcwatch, one that he thought was nice...

2240
02:08:08,461 --> 02:08:10,667
他根本不知道好表长什么样子
he doesn't knowabcwhat the fuck a good watch is.

2241
02:08:10,797 --> 02:08:15,257
假设表价在五千abc最多一万二，对他来说也不可能
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000abcat the most, which is impossible for him.

2242
02:08:16,886 --> 02:08:21,298
加上三套一千一套的西装abc还剩多少？
Plus, at the most, three suits,abc$1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?

2243
02:08:21,891 --> 02:08:24,927
-差不多一万左右abc-山姆，可以停止吗？
-Around $10,000?abc-Would you knock it off, Sam?

2244
02:08:25,061 --> 02:08:28,227
-我只是想算清楚abc-没什么好算的
SAM: I'm just trying to figure it out.abcGINGER: There's nothing to figure out.

2245
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:33,519
我回家了，我们在协调
I'm home. We're working it out.

2246
02:08:33,737 --> 02:08:36,310
可是我以前也听过abc“我们在协调”
But I've been told before,abc"We're working it out."

2247
02:08:36,531 --> 02:08:38,073
你以为你回家…
You think that you're home...

2248
02:08:38,658 --> 02:08:42,358
在你对我与艾美所做的一切后abc算是给我面子吗？
after what you just put meabcthrough with Amy, is a favor to me?

2249
02:08:50,045 --> 02:08:54,920
加上表，假设你们这个周末abc花费了四千好了…
Counting the watch, let's sayabcanother $4,000 for expenses this weekend...

2250
02:08:56,092 --> 02:08:58,049
我相信你们一定过得很愉快
of which you must have had a good time.

2251
02:08:58,178 --> 02:08:59,969
至少我很确定他很愉快
I know he did. That's for sure.

2252
02:09:00,055 --> 02:09:03,755
我知道那狗杂种一定很快乐
I know that fucking pieceabcof shit had a good fucking time.

2253
02:09:05,685 --> 02:09:07,143
花我的钱
On my money.

2254
02:09:07,604 --> 02:09:10,723
你干脆就跟他上床算了abc你八成也这样做了
You might as well have fucked him,abcwhich you probably did anyway.

2255
02:09:12,317 --> 02:09:14,143
你看我的表情很奇怪
You're looking at me a certain way.

2256
02:09:15,779 --> 02:09:17,486
你热泪盈眶
You're teary-eyed.

2257
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:20,945
你很难过abc你真是个好演员
You're upset.abcYou're a good actress, you know that?

2258
02:09:21,702 --> 02:09:23,528
真他妈的演得好
Good fucking actress.

2259
02:09:24,871 --> 02:09:26,910
你可让任何人可怜你
SAM: You can fucking get pity out of people.

2260
02:09:27,082 --> 02:09:28,789
但我不是嫖客，好吗？
I'm not a john. You understand?

2261
02:09:29,251 --> 02:09:32,121
你一直以为我是abc但我不是，我也不是冤大头
You always thought I was,abcbut I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.

2262
02:09:34,047 --> 02:09:36,288
那可恶的拉皮条狗杂碎
That fucking pimp cocksucker.

2263
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:38,423
上次没杀了他是他命好
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

2264
02:09:38,594 --> 02:09:41,797
他活着是命好abc若你们带着艾美…
SAM: Lucky he's fucking living.abcIf you would have stayed with Amy...

2265
02:09:41,889 --> 02:09:43,928
然后走人的话abc他就死定了
and you had run away,abche would have been dead.

2266
02:09:44,058 --> 02:09:46,762
你们俩都死定了
Both of you. Dead.

2267

Dead.

2268
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:57,637
不，不公平
GINGER: No, it isn't fair.

2269
02:10:04,021 --> 02:10:06,808
他晚上根本不回家abc有什么了不起？
He doesn't come home at night.abcWhat is the big fucking deal?

2270
02:10:06,941 --> 02:10:09,478
我走，听着，我真的受不了
I go.... Listen, I just can't fucking take it.

2271
02:10:09,610 --> 02:10:12,314
我为什么要忍受？abc这不是我们的协议
Why should I fucking take it?abcThat wasn't the deal.

2272
02:10:13,114 --> 02:10:16,483
他一副好像就只有我有过去的样子
He acts like I'm the only oneabcaround here with a fucking past.

2273
02:10:16,659 --> 02:10:18,532
他永远都不让我忘记
He'll never let me live it down.

2274

是，我试过，我当然试过
Well, yes, I have tried. Of course I've tried.

2275

你以为我为什么回来？
What the fuck do you thinkabcI came back here for?

可以帮我把珠宝拿出来？

有很多钱在那儿

我愿意重赏任何可以帮助我的人
