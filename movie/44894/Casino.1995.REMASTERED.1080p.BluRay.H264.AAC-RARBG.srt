1
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,960
真实故事改编

2
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,220
1983年

3
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,240
当你爱一个人，你必须相信他
SAM: [Voiceover] When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.

4
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,610
别无它法
There's no other way.

5
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,200
你得将掌管生命中一切的那把钥匙给他
You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.

6
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,790
要不然有什么意义？
Otherwise, what's the point?

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,380
一直以来，我深信我拥有的是这样的爱
And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.

8
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
在我开赌场及被炸之前…
SAM: Before I ever ran a casino, or got blown up...

9
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,870
艾斯罗斯坦，可是最诺娜马预测者
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.

10
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
我告诉你
I can tell you that.

11
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,330
我旺到每次只要我下注，全国的赌盘赔率…
I was so good that whenever I bet, I'd change the odds...

12
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,120
都会随着改变
for every bookmaker in the country.

13
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,590
不盖你，我对赛马的研究精湛到…
I'm serious, I had it down so cold...

14
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,080
让我晋升人间天堂
that I was given paradise on Earth.

15
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,680
我被升为拉斯维加斯最大赌场之一《坦吉乐》的管理人…
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

16
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,050
唯有聘请我的那帮人才能如此大手笔
by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money.

17
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,060
六千两百七十万美元
$62, 700, 000.

18
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,020
我不知道细节
I don't know all the details.

19
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,730
老实说，没人知道细节…
NICKY: [Voiceover] In fact, nobody knew all the details...

20
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,410
原本应该很完美的
but it should've been perfect.

21
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,780
他有我这好友尼奇山多罗挺他…
He had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass...

22
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,660
他手中也揽着他爱的女人，金吉儿
and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.

23
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,870
到头来，我们全搞砸了
But in the end, we fucked it all up.

24
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,090
原本应多完美
It should've been so sweet, too.

25
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,750
结果，我们这样的小混混…
It turned out to be the last time that street guys like us...

26
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,550
在这次之后就再也无缘搞油水这么丰富的大生意了
were ever given anything that fucking valuable again.

27
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
那时的赌城，是蠢蛋们…
SAM: Vegas was a place where suckers...

28
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,730
一毛一毛存足了钱飞来…
flew in every year on their own nickel...

29
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,900
直到输光了家当才走人的地方
and left behind about a billion dollars.

30
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,240
在夜晚，你看不到包围拉斯维加斯的沙漠
But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

31
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,110
但城里许多的问题却都是在沙漠里解决的
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.

32
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,250
沙漠里的坑洞可多着呢
NICKY: Got a lot of holes in the desert...

33
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,750
里面埋藏了很多问题
and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.

34
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,160
只是程序要对
Except you gotta do it right.

35
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,920
你得先把洞挖好…
You gotta have the hole already dug...

36
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,260
再将货从汽车后车箱载来
before you show up with a package in the trunk.

37
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,210
要不然你就得在沙漠挖上个30到45分钟
Otherwise, you're talking about 30 or 45 minutes of digging.

38
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,970
谁又知道期间会有什么人出现？
Who knows who's gonna be coming along in that time?

39
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,940
不知不觉中，你又得多挖好几个洞
Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.

40
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,900
搞不好一整晚都得耗在那儿
You could be there all fucking night.

41
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,810
公爵

42
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,480
坦吉乐

43
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,670
精华地段-拉斯维加斯，十年前
THE STRIP - LAS VEGAS TEN YEARS EARLIER

44
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,490
谁抗拒的了？
SAM: Who could resist?

45
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,340
在别处，我只是个登记赛马的一个赌徒…
Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler...

46
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,750
老是得小心翼翼，成天被条子们骚扰
always looking over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.

47
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,800
但在这儿，我可是罗斯坦先生
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.

48
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,600
不但不偷鸡摸狗，还管间赌场
I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.

49
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,440
那就像是将梦想换为现金
And that's like selling people dreams for cash.

50
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,600
我聘任了赌场的一个老朋友 比利雪伯当经理，然后开始工作
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and went to work.

51
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,320
这是负责牌室的罗尼
And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.

52
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,950
像我们这种人 拉斯维加斯洗去了我们的罪孽
SAM: For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,070
像是道德洗车场一样
It's like a morality car wash.

54
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,660
它对我们的效用就像法国露德 对驼背和残障的人一样
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.

55
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,720
不但让我们重见天日…
SAM: And along with making us legit...

56
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,800
还带来了现金，数不尽的钱
comes cash, tons of it.

57
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,770
不然你以为我们没事 跑到这沙漠中央干嘛？
What do you think we're doing here in the middle of the desert?

58
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,400
就是为了这些钱
It's all this money.

59
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,320
这是所有炫目的灯光…
This is the end result of all the bright lights...

60
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,480
所有的招待、香槟、免费住宿…
and the comped trips, of all the champagne...

61
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,660
女人与喝不完的酒 最终所造成的结果
and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.

62
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,910
全都是为了 让我们弄走你的钱
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.

63
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,290
这就是赌城的真面目
That's the truth about Las Vegas.

64
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,800
我们是唯一的赢家
We're the only winners.

65
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,960
赌徒们一点机会都没有
The players don't stand a chance.

66
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,630
而他们的钱从赌桌上…
And their cash flows from the tables...

67
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,340
流入我们的收银柜再进入保险笼…
to our boxes through the cage...

68
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,340
最后流入全赌场最神圣的房间
and into the most sacred room in the casino.

69
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,470
他们计算钱的地方…
The place where they add up all the money...

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,140
注意-请勿进入 万物之首，计算室
the Holy of holies, the count room.

71
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,730
这儿可不是闲杂人等可进出的
Now, this place was off-limits.

72
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,780
连我都进不去
Even I couldn't get inside.

73
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,780
当然，但我的工作是让它保持 满满的状态
But it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure.

74
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,950
里头的钱多到…
NICKY: They had so much money in there...

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,650
可让你用百元大钞砌栋房子
you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills.

76
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,460
最棒的是…
And the best part was that upstairs...

77
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,540
上头董事会什么屁都不知道
the Board of Directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.

78
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,920
在他们看来一切都干净俐落 没人动手脚
To them everything looked on the up-and-up.

79
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,540
不是吗？当然不
Right? Wrong.

80
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
确认五千元
Verify $5,000.

81
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,680
在计算室的那些人…
NICKY: The guys in the counting room...

82
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,350
都是被派进去将里头吸干的
were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.

83
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,430
他们会少算钱，将计单弄掉
They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.

84
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,020
甚至直接从箱里拿走现款
They'd even take cash right out of the drop-boxes.

85
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,980
全是靠这家伙…
And it was up to this guy right here...

86
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,270
站在两百万元前的这位…
standing in front of $2 million...

87
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,610
在被国税局或任何人发现前…
to skim the cash off the top without anybody getting wise...

88
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,490
把钱摸走
the IRS or anybody.

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,160
在计算室里 好像都没人在看
Notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.

90
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,530
不知怎的，大家都视若无睹
Somehow, somebody's always looking the other way.

91
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,830
看看这些家伙 他们看来真忙，不是吗？
Look at these guys. They look busy, right?

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,380
他们在算钱，谁会吵他们呢？
They're counting money. Who wants to bother them?

93
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,800
我的意思是，天晓得他们会不会 犯了错而忘记偷钱
I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.

94
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,670
这期间，你可来去自如
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.

95
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,590
走过那些鸟事不干的警卫 每礼拜还多拿一百元…
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra $100 a week...

96
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,100
只为了看门
just to watch the door.

97
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,020
一如往常一样规律…
It's routine. Business as usual...

98
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,850
走进、走出、你好、再见
in, out, hello, goodbye.

99
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,360
就这么简单
That's all there is to it.

100
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,030
就只是个拎着皮箱 走出赌场的肥猪
Just another fat fuck walking out of a casino with a suitcase.

101
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,780
但那口箱子 会直接送往一个地方
Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place:

102
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,620
堪萨斯市，那里是…
right to Kansas City, which was as close...

103
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,990
中部的老大能离拉斯维加斯 最近的地方…
to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go...

104
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,000
而不用怕被逮捕
without getting themselves arrested.

105
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,250
堪萨斯市 老大们要的只是那口箱子
That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.

106
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,880
每个月都要
And they wanted it every month.

107
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,760
圣马利诺意大利超市

108
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,390
这个摩门教的混蛋…
Now this old Mormon fuck here...

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,860
他每个月都得拿着箱子飞来
he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.

110
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,770
-什么东西这么香？ -他们做了好料的
-Something smells good. -They made us something to eat.

111
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,780
老大们会从各地飞来…
NICKY: The bosses would come from all over:

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
底特律、克里夫兰、密尔瓦基…
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...

113
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,910
整个中西部…
all over the Midwest...

114
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,410
他们都会在这个位于 堪萨斯市的市场碰面
and they would meet in this produce market in Kansas City.

115
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,000
根本没人会知道
Nobody even knew it.

116
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,830
有一个让他妈做菜
One of the guys made his mother do the cooking.

117
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,000
你有看到杰瑞史塔瑞欧吗？
Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?

118
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,750
这些老头们看来可能不怎么样
NICKY: These old greaseballs might not look it...

119
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
但相信我…
but believe me...

120
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,140
他们才是赌城的秘密操纵者
these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.

121
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,810
妈妈，那男人又来了
WOMAN: Mama, that man's here again.

122
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,300
因为他们控制着 全美卡车司机工会
NICKY: Because they controlled the Teamsters Union.

123
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,770
而要开赌场非得到那儿去借钱
And that's where you had to go to borrow money to buy a casino.

124
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,770
-你要放虾吗？ -我会的
WOMAN 2: Would you put in shrimp? WOMAN: I would.

125
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,100
要是这些家伙们每月拿不到 这只小箱子…
NICKY: Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room...

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,520
那谁就都别想贷到款
knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.

127
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,320
像这从底特律来的老家伙
Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.

128
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,870
或尤其是像利蒙盖吉 这群人的首脑
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250
有大概数字吗？
You got a round figure on it?

130
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,500
绝对是这房里最重要的人物
NICKY: Definitely the most important guy in this room.

131
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,340
-十公斤，那就差不多七十万了 -很好
FRANK: About 20 pounds. Around $700,000. REMO: Good.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,380
虽说对拉斯维加斯还有点早…
STONE: It's a little early for Las Vegas...

133
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,220
但我想邀请赌博游乐业界的 先生与小姐们…
but I want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry....

134
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,390
就以世界所知…
SAM: As far as the world was concerned...

135
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,560
安迪史东卡车司机工会 退休基金会的负责人…
Andy Stone, head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

136
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,360
是个清白的人物
was a legitimate guy.

137
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,390
有权力的人
A powerful man.

138
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,030
他与总统一同打高尔夫
He played golf with the President.

139
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,410
代表卡车司机工会退休基金会…
ANDY: On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

140
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,240
-我很高兴将这… -但安迪也听命于人
I'm glad to present... SAM: But he also took orders.

141
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,620
当他被指示将基金贷款 贷给菲立浦葛林…
When he was told to give a pension-fund loan to Philip Green...

142
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,790
六千两百七十万的支票…
...this check for $62,700,000...

143
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,300
给全新的坦吉乐
for the new Tangiers.

144
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,420
他就会乖乖听话
...he did what he was told.

145
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,550
他可是最完美的傀儡
NICKY: Here was the perfect front man.

146
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,260
他还能干嘛呢？ 他什么都不知道
What the fuck else could he be? He didn't know too much.

147
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,840
也什么都不想知道…
He didn't want to know too much...

148
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,760
尤其是老大们让工会借钱给他
especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him money.

149
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,970
他想相信他们是因为 他的才智贷款给他
He wanted to believe they gave him the money because he was smart.

150
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,600
我了解这城市的竞争性有多大 才会说出此话
I say that knowing just how much competition we have in this city.

151
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,070
他们从哪儿找来葛林的？
NICKY: And where they got Green from?

152
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,740
谁知道啊？
Who the fuck knows?

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,780
我只知道他在亚利桑那州 是个房地产经纪…
All I know is that he was an Arizona real-estate hustler...

154
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,410
却连开来拿支票的油钱 都差点付不出来
who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his fucking check.

155
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,090
美国中部 卡车司机工会退休基金 是由老大的人…
And it was the bosses' man...

156
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,960
安迪史东下所有的命令
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.

157
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,460
并不是由董事会主席 菲立浦葛林
Not the Chairman of the Board, Philip Green.

158
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,470
我了解
I understand.

159
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,970
现在只缺…
NICKY: Now all they needed was...

160
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,180
一个可信任的人来管理赌场
someone they could trust to run the casino.

161
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,850
有谁比艾斯更适合？ 他已经在赌城混了几年…
And who better than Ace? He was already in Vegas a couple years...

162
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,860
他对这儿t若指掌
and he had the fucking place clocked.

163
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,280
艾斯的一贯作风 你给他个管理赌场的机会…
But typical Ace, give him a shot to run a casino...

164
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,860
他还推三阻四
and he tries to talk you out of it.

165
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,650
我不知道自己行不行
I don't know if I could do this.

166
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,030
赌博游乐委员会绝不会 发执照给我的
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,920
我最起码有两打以上 赌博与赛马被逮的前科
I have at least 24 gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

168
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,290
在赌场工作不需要执照
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.

169
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,590
你只需要去申请
All you gotta do is apply for one.

170
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,170
州法律允许你在申请期间…
The State law says that you can work in a casino...

171
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,840
在赌场做事
while they process your application.

172
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,890
他们文件进度现在落后十年
ANDY: They got a 10-year backlog.

173
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,640
若他们发现了怎么办？
What happens when they do find out?

174
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,390
他们为什么会想发现？
ANDY: Why would they want to find out?

175
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,500
我们在这儿投资了一亿
We're putting $100 million here.

176
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,100
他们何必赶我们走？
Why would they lock us out?

177
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,940
他们不会发现的
ANDY: They'll never find out.

178
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,270
你只需要一直改变职位头衔
All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.

179
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,900
像从赌场执行长改到 餐饮主席
Like, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.

180
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,570
然后他们又会将你的申请表 摆到最下面去
Then they put your application at the bottom of the pile.

181
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,250
我有大把的员工 已经工作三十年了还没执照
I know guys who've worked there for 30 years don't have a license.

182
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,290
这不是容易的决定，安迪
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

183
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,630
若我去做，得让我用我的方式
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,710
没问题
ANDY: You got it.

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,720
我说真的，不能有干涉
I'm serious. No interference.

186
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,420
没有人会干涉你管理赌场
Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.

187
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,140
我保证
I guarantee it.

188
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,260
艾斯就是这样接手的
NICKY: And that's how they got Ace to take over.

189
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,980
要艾斯是因为 他不管是吃喝拉撒睡时都在赌
They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.

190
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,490
他们还给了他个很可爱的头衔…
They worked out a real cute job title, too...

191
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,990
坦吉乐公关理事
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,830
但他只管赌场
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.

193
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,040
他从十五岁时第一次下注就没输过
He made his first bet when he was 15, and he always made money.

194
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,370
他不像你我那样赌
He didn't bet like you or me.

195
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,630
就为了他妈的好玩
Having some fun with it, shit like that.

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,430
你在哪儿学当庄家的？
Where did you learn how to deal?

197
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,250
他下注时就像是脑部外科医生一样
NICKY: He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.

198
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,310
筹码得摆对
SAM: Place the checks properly.

199
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,180
-像这样 -是的
-That's the way you do it. -Yes, sir.

200
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,050
他得洞悉一切
NICKY: He had to know everything.

201
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,720
他知道没人晓得的内幕…
He'd find out the inside stuff nobody else knew...

202
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,810
他会根据此下注
and that's what he'd put his money on.

203
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,650
在老家时 就连在老家时
BACK HOME YEARS AGO Even back home, years ago...

204
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,860
当我们刚认识的时候… 他都知道四分卫有没有吸可卡因
when we first hung out, he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...

205
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,570
我赌哥伦比亚两万
I'll take Columbia for $20,000.

206
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,540
或他的女友是否怀孕
...if his girlfriend was knocked up.

207
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,450
他会去测风速 只为了预测射门得分
He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.

208
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,250
他算出了篮球场上…
He even figured out the bounce you got off different kinds of wood...

209
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,460
不同木材质地板的弹性
on college basketball courts.

210
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,550
他从早到晚都在做这些
He'd be working on this day and night.

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
他对他要下注的赌局 t若指掌
He knew everything about a game he would bet on.

212
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,930
艾斯下了六千 我也跟下六千
Ace got down at $6,000. Get me down at $6,000.

213
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,590
一季又一季…
NICKY: Season after season...

214
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,190
那小子是我唯一认识的绝对赢家
the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.

215
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,900
但他那么认真下注…
But he was so serious about it all...

216
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,900
在我看来他从不放轻松享受享受
that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.

217
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,650
但那就是他
But that's just the way he was.

218
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,580
当时，老大们也不会在乎他享不享受
Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck whether he enjoyed himself or not.

219
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,160
对他们而言，他像是棵摇钱树
To them, he was a cash register.

220
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,290
他们只要摇一摇就可拿钱
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.

221
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,700
尤其利蒙…
Especially Remo...

222
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,870
他是个逢赌必输的衰客
who was a fucking degenerate gambler who always lost.

223
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,380
靠，这么多满贯
All those fucking sweeps.

224
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,930
-除非艾斯下注 -真是够了！
NICKY: Unless Ace made his bets. Enough now!

225
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,300
艾斯一个周末为他们赚的钱…
NICKY: Ace made more money for them on a weekend...

226
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,640
比我抢劫一个月的还多
than I could do heisting joints for a month.

227
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,360
艾斯将他听到的小道消息 都告诉了利蒙
Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.

228
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,820
内定的拳赛，下了药的马…
Fixed fights, doped horses...

229
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,150
买通的裁判，预定的分数
crooked fucking zebras, locked-in point spreads.

230
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,160
他什么屁都告诉了利蒙
He told fucking Remo everything.

231
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,530
说真的，我也不能怪他
And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.

232
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,830
用钱财让利蒙快乐…
Keeping Remo happy with money...

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,250
是世上最好的保险
was the greatest insurance policy in the world.

234
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,630
王八蛋！
Son of a bitch!

235
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,880
你怎么知道是 奥克拉荷马或密西根
How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

236
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,800
根本没人猜到奥克拉荷马 你是怎么办到的？
Nobody ever had Oklahoma.... How'd you do it?

237
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,470
所以他们才赔得高啊
That's why they paid so well.

238
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,880
你看吧？ 什么都不跟我说
REMO: You see? Never tells me nothing.

239
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,060
下礼拜的怎么样？
What do we got on for next week?

240
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,730
现在还太早了 我得要星期四才知道，可以吗？
It's a little too early. I'll know by Thursday. Is that all right?

241
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,070
-你会来家里吗？ -我会绕过来的
REMO: You'll come by the house? SAM: I'll come by.

242
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,390
七点
At 7:00.

243
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,400
做得好，小子 继续啊
REMO: Good job, my boy. Keep it up.

244
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,610
嘿，尼克
REMO: Hey, Nick.

245
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,780
我马上去
I'll be right out.

246
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,370
看到那家伙了吗？好好看着他
See that guy? Keep a good eye on him.

247
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,580
他为我们赚了很多钱
He's making a lot of money for us.

248
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,920
他会继续为我们赚钱 所以你得好好看着他
And he'll continue making money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

249
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,920
不像你外面那群没脑的政府关员
Not like the fucking Feds out there, without brains.

250
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,390
-好吗？ -没问题
REMO: Okay? NICKY: All right.

251
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,300
要我带走吗？
Want me to take this?

252
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,470
所以这么多事之外…
NICKY: Now, on top of everything else...

253
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,100
我还得担保 没人会动我们的大红人
I gotta make sure nobody fucks with the Golden Jew.

254
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,390
帮小姐们倒几杯酒
Couple of shooters for the ladies.

255
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,310
我们真是好搭挡
SAM: Yeah, we made a great pair.

256
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,360
我下注而尼奇负责收钱
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.

257
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,440
老头子们爱死我们了
The old men loved us, and why not?

258
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,450
他们全靠我们赚钱
They all made money with us.

259
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,580
尼奇怎么收钱？
How did Nicky collect?

260
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,950
别问
Don't ask.

261
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,580
钱他妈的在哪儿？ 我没见到
Then where the fuck is the money? I don't see it.

262
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,330
-你们好，玛莉莎，海蒂 -你好，山姆
-Hi, Melissa, Heidi. -Hi, Sam.

263
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,170
那是谁？
Who's this guy?

264
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,090
-去你的，我下九 -是八
MAN: Get the fuck out. I laid nine. NICKY: It was eight.

265
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,000
艾斯告诉他芝加哥小熊队的注
NICKY: Ace, tell him the line on the Bears game.

266
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,060
-八 -他要不知道，就没人知道了
-Eight. -If he don't know, nobody knows.

267
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,520
-是八 -那我怎么算成九？
NICKY: It was eight. MAN: How come I laid nine?

268
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,270
因为你是个蠢才
'Cause you're a jag-off.

269
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,230
-对不起？ -什么？
-Excuse me. -What?

270
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,980
-这是你的笔吗？ -是我的，怎样？
-Isthis your pen? -Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

271
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,360
很好看，我不知道是谁的
It's nice. I didn't know whose it was.

272
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,120
我不想它弄丢
I didn't want it to get lost.

273
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,620
谢谢 你为什么不拿那只笔…
Thank you. Why don't you take that fucking pen...

274
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,070
捅到你屁眼里去，你这蠢才
and shove it up your ass, you fucking jag-off?

275
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,210
-我只是… -王八蛋
-Well, I was just offering-- -Asshole.

276
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,880
小心，乔
MAN: Look out, Joe.

277
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,200
那是什么？ 你有没有听到女孩哭？
What's that? You hear a little girl?

278
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,110
是个小女孩吗？
Is that a little fucking girl?

279
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,740
刚叫我朋友捅什么的…
What happened to the tough guy...

280
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,200
那个硬汉呢？
who told my friend to stick it up his fucking ass?

281
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,290
尼奇，够了
Nicky, take it easy.

282
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,630
我还在想那人 为什么这么说时…
SAM: While I tried to figure out why the guy said what he said...

283
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,140
尼奇就动手了
Nicky just hit him.

284
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,590
不管一个人多大个子 尼奇都会跟他拼命
No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.

285
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,970
你拿拳头打他 他就会拿球棒回你
You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.

286
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,530
你拿刀捅他 他就会用枪射你
You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.

287
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,440
你若拿枪射他 那你最好是杀了他…
If you beat him with a gun, you'd better kill him...

288
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,280
因为他会一直不停的回来…
because he'll keep coming back and back...

289
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,990
直到你挂了为止
until one of you is dead.

290
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,630
由我保护艾斯…
NICKY: With me protecting Ace...

291
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,550
他为老大们狠狠赚了一票
he made a fortune for the bosses.

292
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,340
这就是他来赌城的原因
That's what got him to Vegas.

293
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,180
他根本就是印钞机
He was a money machine.

294
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,520
为这些家伙赚大钱
A tremendous earner for these guys.

295
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,690
他一来就把供金增加了一倍
As soon as he took over, he doubled the fucking drop.

296
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,400
艾斯来后，赌场从就没见过 那么多的钱
With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.

297
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,570
老大们当然是笑不拢嘴
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.

298
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,960
在赌城，我还得跟附近有关系的 一些牛仔找事做
SAM: In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

299
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,470
他们与老家伙们很熟
They were close to the good old boys.

300
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,360
要不是我们 那些家伙现在都还在铲驴粪
Without us, these guys would still be shoveling mule shit.

301
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,320
场子得保持干净
You've got to keep a cleaner station.

302
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,570
需要清洁工就呼叫他
If you need Mr. Clean, page him.

303
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,440
下次不会了，山姆
Won't happen again, Sam.

304
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,450
-罗斯坦先生 -下次不会了，罗斯坦先生
SAM: Mr. Rothstein. MAN: It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

305
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,530
这家伙又是一个蠢白人吗？
Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?

306
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,750
-你需要他 -弄不走是吗？
-You need this guy. -Can't get rid of him?

307
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,550
他有关系的 他是县辅导的表兄弟
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

308
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,540
我连清洁工都不会给他做
SAM: I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

309
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,210
别无选择，我必须照顾他们
I had no choice. I had to take care of them.

310
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,090
这些乡巴佬当权
These yokels ran the state.

311
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,330
多谢，议员
DEALER: Thanks, Senator.

312
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,010
-他们立法，又掌管法院 -我要开房间
SAM: They passed the laws, owned the courts. I need a room.

313
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,590
我每周都有十多个政客来访
SAM: I had dozens of politicians and state officials coming through weekly.

314
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,610
-他要什么都给他 -当然
SAM: Get him what he wants. BILLY: Certainly.

315
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,110
何不让他们快乐？
SAM: Why not make them happy?

316
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,160
对于政客 例如我们这位州议员…
For politicians, like our State Senator up there...

317
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,880
一切都是免费的
everything was on the house.

318
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,960
他们的招待生涯 在当选时就赢得了
These guys won their comped life when they got elected.

319
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,630
何不加以利用？
Why not take advantage of it?

320
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,430
政客还是小事，我们解决的了
Still, the politicians came cheap. We could handle them.

321
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,470
是像市川那种…
It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa...

322
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,840
百家乐一把下三万的豪赌客
who plays $30, 000 a hand in baccarat.

323
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,850
这种才该看紧
That's the one you really gotta watch.

324
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,430
他下注动作快，玩得大 他的资金雄厚…
He plays fast and big. He has the cash and the credit...

325
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,950
足可把你玩垮
to turn out your lights.

326
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,610
一年前他让开曼群岛上 好几家赌场洗底
A year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

327
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,370
他从赌场赢了我们两百万…
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million...

328
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,290
又从酒店套房拿了免费的 肥皂、洗发精与毛巾
and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.

329
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,910
又是一个 喜爱免费套房…
Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms...

330
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,170
免费私人飞机又赚得我们两百万 的亿万富翁小气鬼
free private jets and $2 million of our money.

331
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,010
我们也不好惹
But we got him back.

332
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,680
我让机师告诉他飞机故障
I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.

333
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,130
-发生什么事？ -非常抱歉
ICHlKAWA: What went wrong? BILLY: I'm awfully sorry.

334
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,850
是机械故障
These mechanical things happen.

335
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,270
在这儿总比在上面好
Better here than up there.

336
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,190
然后他赶不上回日本的飞机
SAM: Then he missed the flights connecting with Japan.

337
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,690
竟然没有空房
I can't believe there's no room.

338
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,950
我们给了他一整楼的房间
SAM: We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.

339
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,560
-真抱歉让你赶不上飞机
-Sorry you missed your plane.

340
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,040
-你想要赢回我的钱啊
-You'd like some of my money back.

341
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,960
不，不赌了
Oh, no. No gambling.

342
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,550
他回来后开始下小注
SAM: And once he was back, he played small.

343
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,880
一把只赌一千 而不是平常的三万一把
He bet $1,000 a hand, instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.

344
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,430
但我知道这些豪赌客的习性…
But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa...

345
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,020
他们不可能一直下小注的
was that they can't bet small for long.

346
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,480
他不觉得是赢一万…
He didn't think of it as winning $10, 000...

347
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,030
他会想成是输九万…
he thought of it as losing $90, 000.

348
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,740
所以他开始加码
So, he upped his bets.

349
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,920
直到他将赢得的输光 再加上自己一百万的现金
Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up $1 million of his own cash.

350
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,750
在赌场里，第一原则就是 让他们一直赌…
In a casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing...

351
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,260
也让他们一直回来
and keep them coming back.

352
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,930
赌得越多就输得越多
The longer they play, the more they lose.

353
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,100
最终钱就都是我们的
In the end, we get it all.

354
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,770
在赌城，每个人都得注意着别人
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.

355
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,490
玩家是来赢赌场钱的…
Since the players are looking to beat the casino...

356
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,290
庄家得看好玩家…
the dealers are watching the players...

357
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,500
收付赌注得看好庄家…
the boxmen are watching the dealers...

358
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,510
管场的注意着收付赌注的人…
the floormen are watching the boxmen...

359
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,670
赌区经理看着管场的…
the pit bosses are watching the floormen...

360
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,770
值班经理看着赌区经理…
the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses...

361
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,640
赌场经理看着值班经理…
the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...

362
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,930
我则看着赌场经理…
I'm watching the casino manager...

363
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,310
而监视照相机看着我们大家
and the eye in the sky is watching us all.

364
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,740
另外，还有十多个家伙…
Plus, we had a dozen guys...

365
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,040
大多以前都是老千 他们知道所有的骗术
most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.

366
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,100
好啊！
Yes!

367
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,530
-非常好 -我就跟你说我今天很旺
-Very nice. -I told you I was hot tonight.

368
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,620
好样的
Looking good.

369
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,080
来吧，为了金吉儿，快
MAN: Let's go. This is for Ginger.

370
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,200
一百赌你没老A
MAN: Let me have $100 on your hard 10.

371
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,340
谢谢
Thank you.

372
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,580
来吧
MAN: Here we go now.

373
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,900
-对不起 -骰子
-Oh, I'm sorry. -The dice.

374
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,700
多谢
Thank you very much.

375
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,030
多谢你
I appreciate that.

376
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,280
保重，史蒂夫 要冒险啊，开快车
Take care, Steve. Take chances, drive fast.

377
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,910
这一百给你，甜心 多谢你赏光
This $100 is for you, love. Thanks for your time.

378
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,370
-快点 -怎么了？
-Come on. -What's the matter?

379
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,090
我帮你赚了不少，我要我的份
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.

380
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,010
什么钱？我看到你偷钱
What money? I've seen you stealing.

381
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,510
“什么钱？” 你看看这堆筹码
"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.

382
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,850
-我要我的一半 -我观察你一夜了
GINGER: I want my half. GAMBLER: I've watched you.

383
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,310
-我要我的钱 -你皮包里全是熟筹码
-I want my money. -Your bag is full of chips.

384
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,890
-我才没偷你的东西 -滚吧！
GINGER: I didn't steal anything from you. GAMBLER: Get lost!

385
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,270
-滚吧？ -没错！
GINGER: Get lost? GAMBLER: Yes!

386
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,060
-这怎么样呢？ -别这样！
-Well, how about that? -Come on!

387
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,330
真酷，让我一见钟情
SAM: What a move. I fell in love right there.

388
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,000
但在赌城，像金吉儿这样的女孩 得花上大钱
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.

389
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,520
我去补个妆
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

390
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,910
-金吉儿的人生目标是钱 -马上回来
SAM: Ginger's mission in life was money. I'll be right back.

391
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,080
-待会见，金吉儿 -多谢你
DOORMAN: See you. GINGER: Thanks for asking.

392
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,870
她在赌场可是皇后
SAM: She was a queen around the casino.

393
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,420
她召来大赌客 并也帮他们花大钱
She brought in high rollers and helped them spend a lot of money.

394
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
-你好 -嘿，金吉儿，你好吗？
-Hello. -Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

395
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,800
好得很，一点小意思 你帮我搞定了吗？
GINGER: Great. You might have something for me. Got me covered?

396
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,140
-非常感谢 -自己保重喔
GINGER: Thank you. VALET: Take care of yourself.

397
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
我有些幸运丸给你，安迪
I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.

398
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,640
谁不想要金吉儿？ 她是城里名声最响亮…
SAM: Who didn't want her? She was one of the best known...

399
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,860
也是道上最受欢迎的江湖人物
best liked and most respected hustlers in town.

400
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,150
像她这么聪明的玩家 可以让男人…
Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake...

401
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,700
两三天不睡 然后再让他一文不名的…
for two or three days before sending him home broke...

402
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,910
回到老婆与银行审查主任身边
to the little woman and his bank examiners.

403
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,600
有找钱吗？
Any change?

404
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,270
我回来时小赌了几把
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.

405
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,690
那根本是胡扯 她把钱收起来了
SAM: But that was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.

406
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,450
-你今天好吗？ -不错啊
GINGER: How you doing tonight? CASHlER: Good.

407
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,120
-你呢？ -衰死了
CASHlER: How are you? GINGER: Beat.

408
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,110
-金吉儿洞悉玩家们的习性 -给你一百
SAM: Ginger had the hustlers' code. GINGER: Take one for you.

409
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,830
-多谢 -她懂得如何买通他人
CASHlER: Thank you. SAM: She knew how to take care of people.

410
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,030
这就是赌城的座右铭
That's what Vegas is all about.

411
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,620
-六千八百元 -谢啦
CASHlER: $6,800. GINGER: Thanks.

412
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,290
-这里是讲究回扣的城市 -晚安
SAM: It's kickback city. GINGER: Have a good night.

413
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,090
她罩庄家…
SAM: She took care of the dealers...

414
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,510
赌区经理，管场经理…
pit bosses, floor managers...

415
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,350
但尤其关照停车小弟…
but, mostly, the valet parkers...

416
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,730
他们能帮你找到任何东西 也能帮你解决任何事
the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.

417
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,570
金吉儿搞定了停车的…
Ginger took care of the parkers...

418
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,150
他们搞定警卫 而警卫会摆平警察…
who took care of the security guards, who took care of the cops...

419
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,660
-让她可继续开工 -我今晚需要那东西
who let her operate. I need that stuff tonight.

420
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
-没问题 -你真好
VALET: No problem. GINGER: You are a doll.

421
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,870
停车赚的钱多到…
SAM: The valet parking job was such a money-maker...

422
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,160
得买通酒店经理才能排上空缺
they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.

423
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,380
不过有一点我不懂…
But one thing I didn't understand...

424
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,970
她将一切都控制的好好的…
was that she had everything under control...

425
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,840
却被她那拉皮条的男友 莱丝特戴蒙德吃得死死的
except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

426
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,220
我得顾到其他人，我的搭挡们
I got other people in this. I got partners.

427
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,220
在这事上有我罩你，知道吗？
I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?

428
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,180
你将获你应得的 而且第一个拿到，好吗？
You'll get yours back, and you'll get it back first. Okay?

429
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,530
-好的 -你去哪儿了？
-All right. -Where you going?

430
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,570
你在哪儿？ 你又飘走了
Where are you? You're in that place.

431
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,570
-我在这儿 -不，你不在
-I'm here. -No, you're not.

432
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,740
你在哪？
Where are you?

433
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,380
我永远在你身边
I'm always here for you.

434
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,960
-真的 -是啊
-You are. -I am.

435
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,550
我所认识的金吉儿 根本不会多看这怪胎一眼
SAM: The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.

436
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,670
-祝你好运 -是啊
-Good luck. -Yeah.

437
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,720
他是个老千，专作假牌…
SAM: He was a moocher, a card cheat...

438
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,520
老在高尔夫俱乐部招摇撞骗 一个瘪三…
a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...

439
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,520
-为了几块钱追着牙医屁股跑 -小心点
-chasing dentists for a few bucks. -Careful.

440
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,020
他永远都没钱，永远都有藉口
SAM: He was always broke. He always had a story.

441
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,190
不知为何，她却拒绝不了他
Somehow, she could never turn him down.

442
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,820
在金吉儿眼里，他只是运气不好
The way Ginger saw it was that he was just an unlucky guy.

443
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,860
总得有人照顾他
Somebody had to take care of him.

444
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,530
在老家
BACK HOME

445
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,410
但尼奇可不需要人照顾
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

446
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,210
你找到现金的话 我们就跟你平分
You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.

447
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,500
他把自己照顾得太好了
SAM: He took care of himself only too well.

448
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,380
这也是为什么老家的条子 都想抓他到案
That's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.

449
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,130
我将这些都折得好好的 能不能放尊重点
I folded these things beautifully. I would appreciate a little respect.

450
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,590
别看我，兄弟 我还得跟她同床共枕
Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.

451
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,430
就连去渡个假 他们在机场时都不放过他
SAM: Even after a vacation, they hassled him at the airport.

452
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,270
法兰克玛雷诺在那儿等他 条子们也在
Frank Marino was there to meet him. So were the cops.

453
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,110
他们想逮他…
They wanted to pinch him...

454
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,730
-因为一宗在安特卫普的钻石窃案 -帮忙折吧
-for a diamond burglary in Antwerp. -Help me fold these.

455
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,850
他们随时愿意嫁祸于他 不管是在哪儿发生什么事
SAM: They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where.

456
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,700
他们通常是对的
They were usually right.

457
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,570
因为尼奇很喜欢混帮派
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.

458
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,030
他也不在乎有谁知道
And he didn't give a damn who knew it.

459
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,580
看看，美极了
GINGER: There we go. Look at that. Beautiful!

460
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,130
让我担心的是…
SAM: I mean that's what worried me...

461
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,290
尼奇似乎要被派来拉斯维加斯
'cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

462
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,460
-好了，就这样 -还有
JENNlFER: All right, we're clear. NICKY: There's more.

463
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,140
一定还有些卡在里面
NICKY: There's a couple stuck in there.

464
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,090
-我告诉你都拿出来了 -快
-I'm telling you, they're out! -Come on.

465
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,340
别急于辩护 可能还有些卡在你头发里
Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.

466
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,730
那是什么？
What's that?

467
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,600
没有了，谢谢
There's no more. Thanks.

468
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,610
我迫不及待想去拉斯维加斯
NICKY: I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.

469
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,490
但老大可不是送我去玩的
But the bosses didn't send me out to have a good time.

470
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,620
他们要我去确保 没人找艾斯的麻烦
They sent me out to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.

471
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,240
也确保没人干扰每月的抽头
And nobody interfered with the fucking skim.

472
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,040
-嘿 -你好吗？
-Hey. -Hey, how you doing?

473
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,500
嘿，山姆
Hey, Sammy.

474
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,500
-天呀，瞧瞧这地方 -不可思议
-Boy, look at this place. -Incredible.

475
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,760
欢迎来赌城
SAM: Welcome to Vegas.

476
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,420
-好样的，山姆 -不错吧
NICKY: Okay, Sammy. SAM: Something, huh?

477
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,010
金吉儿
Ginger.

478
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,810
靠，你都在这儿干嘛？
Holy shit. What've you been doing out here?

479
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
甜心，过来
SAM: Honey, come here.

480
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,480
这是珍妮佛与尼克 我的好朋友们
This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.

481
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,370
-你好，珍妮佛 -幸会
-Hi, Jennifer. -A pleasure.

482
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,120
好样的，山姆
Okay, Sammy.

483
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,120
晚餐后，我们让珍妮佛 与金吉儿一块儿…
SAM: After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger...

484
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,790
我们俩则出去谈话
and we took a ride to talk.

485
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,500
然后他对我丢了颗炸弹
And then, he hit me with it.

486
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,800
你觉得我也搬来如何？
What do you think about me moving out here?

487
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,140
有问题吗？
You got a problem with that?

488
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,500
当然没有
No, of course not.

489
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,270
你是说你允许罗？
You mean I have your permission?

490
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,560
当然罗 但我得告诉你…
Sure, you do. But I just gotta tell you...

491
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,600
在这儿可不能开玩笑
it's no joke out here.

492
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,770
你得保持低调
You gotta keep a low profile.

493
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,770
不像是在老家 这儿他们不喜欢我们
It's not like back home. They don't like guys like us.

494
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,860
警长是个不折不扣的牛仔
This sheriff's a real cowboy.

495
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,650
连巡警都不怕在沙漠里埋人
Even coppers aren't afraid to bury people in the desert.

496
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,620
我不在乎 我只想离开老家一阵子
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while.

497
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,790
我厌倦了那里
I'm tired of that shit back there.

498
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,660
看看这地方，简直是钱砌的
Look at this place. It's made of money.

499
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,210
知道最诺氖鞘裁矗
You know what the best part is?

500
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,290
没人知道我们在干嘛
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

501
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,420
没人看着我们，大家都在老家
There's nobody here to see us. Everybody's back home.

502
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,340
我无缘故被逮了两次
I got pinched twice for no reason.

503
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,050
我真得小心了
I really gotta be careful.

504
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,800
我管理的地方是有执照的 全是合法的
I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.

505
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,470
别担心，我什么都不会做的
Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything.

506
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,060
我尤其不会拖你下水
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.

507
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,400
艾斯看赌城的观点…
NICKY: Ace saw Vegas one way...

508
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,780
-你跟他说过我要来吗？ -当然
NICKY: Call and tell him I'm coming? JACK: Of course.

509
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,490
我的看法不同
...but I saw it another.

510
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,030
我视它为未开发的
I saw it as untouched.

511
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,080
多的是可勒索的赌马组头 皮条客与毒贩…
They had bookies, pimps, and drug dealers I could shake down.

512
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,130
他们能找谁靠？
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?

513
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,080
我开始一个一个下手
So I started getting everybody in line.

514
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,890
最诺氖牵我这辈子第一次…
Best of all, for the first time in my life...

515
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,340
发觉了稳赢的方法
I figured out a way not to lose.

516
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,300
他是有个稳赢之计
SAM: He had a foolproof scheme.

517
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,470
虽然不高明，但起码行得通
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.

518
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,890
他赢时就收钱
When he won, he collected.

519
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,550
输时就叫赌马组头去死
When he lost, he told the bookies to fuck off.

520
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,230
他们能怎样？逼迫尼奇？ 尼奇就是逼迫者
What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.

521
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,740
-你好吗？ -你好吗？
-Hey, how you doing? -How you doing?

522
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,820
-你有东西给我吗？ -什么东西？
-You got that thing for me? -What thing?

523
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,690
尼奇，我以为你是来下注的
Nicky, I thought you was laying.

524
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,990
下注？不，我来收钱
I was laying? No, I'm taking it.

525
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,950
-你确定？ -非常
-You sure? -I'm positive.

526
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,420
-我搞混了 -你搞混了？
-I'm a little confused. -You're a little confused?

527
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,880
或许在我把你的脸砸过这窗户后…
Maybe if I stick your fucking face through this window...

528
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,550
你就会清楚点
you'll get unconfused.

529
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,420
-把钱他妈的给我 -对不起
-Give me the fucking money. -I'm sorry.

530
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,920
我不是故意的
I didn't mean anything by it.

531
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,640
所以你连钱都准备好了 你他妈的以为我要下注
That's why you had it ready. You thought I was laying it.

532
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,350
-我的头 -放聪明点
-My fucking head. -Smarten up.

533
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,060
而现在尼可拉斯山多罗 要来跟我们说第一总统的故事了
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first President.

534
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,990
乔治华盛顿出生在…
George Washington was born--

535
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,700
但最起码还风平浪静了一阵子
SAM: But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.

536
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,400
我们带着尼奇与珍妮佛满街亮相…
We presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

537
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,410
像是明星似的
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

538
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,170
你棒挥得很好
COACH: You got a beautiful swing.

539
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,670
艾斯让我儿子，小尼奇 参加市区青少棒，真的很好
NICKY: Ace got Little Nicky involved with Little League. It was great.

540
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,260
结果其中的一位教练 是市立警察局情报单位的
Turned out that one of the other coaches was a metro intelligence cop.

541
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,880
不过无所谓，这纯粹是孩子的事
But it didn't matter. It was all about the kids.

542
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,470
他得明白不是每棒都能挥出全垒打
He's gotta realize everything can't be a home run.

543
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,430
我也是这样告诉他 不过那小子就是这样
That's exactly what I tell him, but that's the kind of kid he is.

544
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,560
尼奇就是尼奇 他总是引人注目
SAM: And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.

545
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,150
尤其是在他不工作的赌场
Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work...

546
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,700
大家都明白
people got the message.

547
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,570
就是我，这也是老大为何派我来
NICKY: Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.

548
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,370
我是来确定 没有其他人在拿这儿的钱
I was to make sure no other crews robbed the joint.

549
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,870
像在那边的那两个蠢才
Like these two fucking balloon heads over here.

550
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,840
想从我们这儿骗走二十万
They were gonna try to bang us out of $200, 000.

551
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,630
走着瞧
Yeah, right, I'm sure.

552
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,590
你好吗？你怎么会在这儿？
How are you? What are you doing here?

553
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
我到这儿来了
I'm over here now.

554
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,880
-到这儿来？ -是啊，跟他们一起
-You're over here? -Yeah, I'm over here with them.

555
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,730
我们在等卡尔曼
We're waiting on Carmine.

556
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,770
是啊，在等卡尔曼
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

557
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,020
他本来在这儿 拿了口箱子后来就走了
He was here before. He had a suitcase, and then he left.

558
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,480
卡尔曼走了？
Carmine left?

559
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,240
他走了吗？
He's gone?

560
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,410
他不在这儿？
He's not here?

561
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,420
他出去了？
Carmine's out?

562
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,210
他好像过了马路还是什么的
I think he went across the street or somewhere else or something.

563
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,350
是喔，听着，祝你在这儿好运
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.

564
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,640
-谢啦，艾迪 -非常好运
-Thanks, Eddy. -Lots of luck.

565
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,220
也祝你好运
Good luck to you, too.

566
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,140
他们忘了签名
CASHlER: They forgot to sign their papers.

567
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,900
他们不需要这个了
They don't need those anymore.

568
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,310
因为基本尊重 我只给别帮家伙一点警告
SAM: Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning.

569
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,520
其他的人可得小心了
Everybody else, watch out.

570
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,160
像这群乡巴佬…
Like these yokels here...

571
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,790
从没听过尼奇或他老家的老大们
who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.

572
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,240
这种王八蛋最麻烦了
They're the morons who give you the most trouble.

573
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,490
被我们抓到后又会溜回来…
We'd catch them and they'd try to sneak back...

574
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,160
戴着假胡子、假发、假鼻子
with beards and wigs and fake noses.

575
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,720
只要看这些王八蛋下注的方式 你就可辨认他们
You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.

576
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,420
像这家伙，以紫筹码下注…
Like this guy. He's betting lavender chips...

577
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
每次下五百，不过只有个小问题
at $500 each with only one little problem.

578
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,350
他每次都猜对
He's always guessed right.

579
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,310
要不是他这么贪心 可能还不会这么明显
If he wasn't so fucking greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.

580
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,320
不过到头来，他们每个都贪
But in the end, they're all greedy.

581
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,680
我看到庄家很弱 但他们并不是一伙的
I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.

582
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,050
他只是没保护好自己的牌
He just wasn't protecting his hand.

583
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,720
他把底牌掀得太高了
He was lifting his hole card way too high.

584
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,780
有个家伙在看庄家的底牌…
Here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card...

585
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,780
再对他坐在桌上的兄弟打手势
and signaling his buddy at this table.

586
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,090
这些在外混的就是这样
And that's just what these hustlers look for.

587
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,220
他们从一家赌场到另一家 找寻着弱庄家…
They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers...

588
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,920
像是狮子们找着弱小的羚羊
the way lions look for weak antelope.

589
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,230
接线生，这是罗先生
Operator, this is Mr. R.

590
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,930
立刻叫阿姆斯壮 与佛莱迪来二号赌台区
Get me Armstrong and Friday over to Pit 2 right away.

591
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,040
二十一点第十九桌 第二个位子的那个大胡子
BJ 19, second base, the beard.

592
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,260
接线生，来段生日快乐曲 要大声点
Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.

593
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,800
祝你生日快乐
WAlTRESSES: [Singing] Happy birthday to you

594
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,020
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

595
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,270
亲爱的杰夫 祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday, dear Jeff

596
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,150
祝你生日快乐
Happy birthday to you

597
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,330
有人倒下！
GUARD: Man down!

598
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,510
叫救护车，有人心脏病发
Go get medical. We got a cardiac arrest here.

599
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,640
他没事了，大家 麻烦给我们一点空间
He's fine, folks. Just give us some room, please.

600
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,990
他们根本搞不清状况
SAM: They never know what hit them.

601
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,900
若他们真的发现是被电击棒电到…
If and when they do find out they got zapped by a cattle prod...

602
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,320
他们会希望自己其实是心脏病发
they wish they really did have a heart attack.

603
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,810
结果发现这两个家伙
Turns out this guy and his fucking pals

604
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,540
已在这儿招摇撞骗好多年了
they were knocking this place dead for years.

605
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,580
-他身上有窃听器 -你在干嘛？
GUARD 1 : He's wired. HUSTLER: What are you doing?

606
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,380
在那儿，就是它了
GUARD 1 : There it is. That's it.

607
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,470
-老千的正法 -我的天！
GUARD 2: Cheater's justice. HUSTLER: Oh, God!

608
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,290
不！
No!

609
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,470
我要所有人知道这儿跟以往不同了
SAM: I wanted everybody to know that things were changed around here.

610
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,980
我们得用这些家伙来让大家知道 他们的好日子不长了
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.

611
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,100
我很好奇
I'm just curious.

612
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,730
我看到你用右手玩筹码
I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand.

613
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,820
-你两只手都可以这样吗？ -不
-Can you do that with both hands? -No.

614
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,410
-不能用两只手吗？ -不能
SAM: You can't do it with both hands? HUSTLER: No, sir.

615
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,910
-左手可以吗？ -我从没试过
-Can you do it with your left hand? -I never tried.

616
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,210
-所以你是右撇子 -是
-So, you're a righty. -Yeah.

617
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,970
那你现在得学习用左手罗
Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.

618
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,640
-十万，不，十一万吧 -是啊
-It's $100,000, $1 10,000 I think. -Yes, it is.

619
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,850
好的
Okay.

620
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,480
嗨
Hi.

621
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,030
在大庭广众数这么多钱
That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.

622
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,700
为何不让我拿到办公室确认？
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it?

623
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,870
多一点隐私
A little privacy.

624
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,530
顺便叫一瓶好香槟来
By the way, send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.

625
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,380
-没问题 -要很特别的
CASHlER: Sure will. BILLY: Real special.

626
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,340
对了，我是赌场经理 比利雪伯堤
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.

627
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,420
-还玩得愉快吗？ -是的
BILLY: Having a good time? HUSTLER 2: Yes.

628
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,540
你在较有隐私的地方算比较好
You want to count the money in privacy.

629
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,300
我得赶飞机去克里夫兰
HUSTLER 2: I have a plane to catch.

630
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,840
我可以领取我赢得的钱吗？
Can I get my winnings?

631
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,560
看他们对我的手做了什么
Look what they did to my hand, man.

632
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,680
我给你一个选择
SAM: I'm gonna give you a choice:

633
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,360
你可以拿钱然后被锤头砸 或者是从这儿走出去
You can have the money and the hammer, or you can walk out of here.

634
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,530
-你要哪个？ -我要走
-What do you want? -I wanna get out of here.

635
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,740
告诉你那群朋友，他们若来乱搞 会发生什么事
Tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.

636
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,780
-对不起，我犯了大错 -你真他妈的说对了
-I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake. -You're fucking right.

637
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,450
你们要是再敢回来 我会敲烂你们的头
SAM: If you come back, either one of you, we'll break your fucking heads.

638
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,120
你看到那锯子没？不是放着好看的 不要再出现在这里
You see that fucking saw? We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around here.

639
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,250
-懂吗？ -是
SAM: Got it? HUSTLER 2: Yes.

640
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,920
-给我滚 -谢谢你
-Get out of here. -Thank you.

641
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,180
把他丢到后街去 跟条子说他被车撞到了
Throw him out in the alley. Tell the cops he got hit by a car.

642
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,130
不到一会儿，一切就都搞定了
SAM: Within no time, everything was set in place.

643
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,510
我们弄走了那些老千 盈利上扬好多…
We got rid of the freelance scamsters, the pro was way up...

644
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,770
上头老大高兴极了
the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.

645
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,260
然后我决定将生活复杂化
And I decided to complicate my life.

646
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,980
对不爱冒险的我来说…
For a guy who likes sure things...

647
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:12,860
我用我的下半辈子 下了笔胜算不大的赌注
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.

648
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,650
我们也不年轻了
We're not getting any younger.

649
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,320
你不觉得是时候了？
Don't you think it's time?

650
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,400
你对这些不厌烦吗？ 这边睡、那边混？
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit? Banging around, hustling around?

651
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,700
-你想要妨碍我吗？ -我想给你更好的
-Are you trying to handicap me? -I'm gonna do you one better.

652
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,120
我想娶你进门
I'm trying to marry you.

653
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,910
你想嫁我吗？
SAM: You wanna marry me?

654
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,010
我说真的
SAM: I'm serious.

655
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,670
我想定下来，想有个家
I wanna settle down. I want a family.

656
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,380
你找错人了，山姆
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

657
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,060
我会是个好爸爸 你也将是个好妈妈
I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.

658
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,510
你不知道我
You don't know me.

659
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:46,180
你才认识我两、三个月 你了解什么？
You've known me two, three months. What do you know?

660
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,520
我已经43岁了，我不想再等了
I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

661
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,320
我对你的了解深到 令我自己知道我非常爱你
I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.

662
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,650
你是我心目中最理想的人
I can't think of anybody better to be with.

663
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,120
我不想再等了
I don't feel like waiting anymore.

664
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,700
你见过很多婚姻美满的人吗？ 我可没见过
You know a lot of happily married people? 'Cause I don't.

665
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,420
这我都懂
I know all that.

666
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,710
我在乎你
I care about you.

667
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,590
但我对你没有那种感觉
But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.

668
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,640
对不起，我并不爱你
I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

669
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:26,570
-好的 -懂吗？
SAM: All right. GINGER: Understand?

670
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,070
对不起
GINGER: I'm sorry.

671
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,020
不…
No....

672
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,000
那可以培养
That can grow.

673
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:41,250
只要互相尊重 感情是可以培养的
As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.

674
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,710
我很现实，我可以接受
I'm realistic. I can accept that.

675
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,470
爱到底是什么？
SAM: What is love anyway?

676
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:50,170
不就是互相尊重 不就是一心一意
SAM: It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.

677
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,140
是一个人在乎另一个人
It's a caring from one person to another.

678
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,350
若我们可以设立一个基础…
And if we could set up some kind of foundation...

679
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,890
以相互尊重为底…
based on that mutual respect...

680
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,980
我觉得迟早你会对我有情…
I feel that eventually you would care enough about me...

681
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:05,860
这样我能接受
that I could live with that.

682
00:41:08,450 --> 00:41:09,950
若行不通的话…
If it doesn't work out...

683
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:12,700
若行不通的话 那我怎么办？
if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?

684
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,000
我现在做得不错 往后会越来越好
I'm doing well now. I'm gonna do even better.

685
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,050
不论如何…
So whatever happens...

686
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:20,550
就算我们俩行不通…
if it doesn't work out between us...

687
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,250
我都会确保你下半辈子的生活
I'll make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.

688
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,500
尤其如果有了孩子…
If there are kids, especially...

689
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,260
我会给你今生最好的照料
I'll take care of you better than you'd imagine.

690
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,720
-你葫芦到底卖什么药？ -我都明讲了
GINGER: What are you pitching me? SAM: Just what I said.

691
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,390
你下半辈子都不用愁
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.

692
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,360
这我可保证
That I can promise you.

693
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:42,350
要不要试试？
Want to take a chance?

694
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,330
我娶金吉儿时就听过她的一切往事…
SAM: When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories...

695
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,130
但我不在乎 我是山姆罗斯坦
but I didn't give a fuck. I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.

696
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,340
我能改变她
I can change her.

697
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,430
这是典型的艾斯
NICKY: It was typical Ace.

698
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,810
他请了城里所有的大人物 他知道他们都会出席
He invited the biggest people in town. He knew they'd show.

699
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,310
他知道他们都有求于他
He knew they all wanted something from him.

700
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,640
艾斯绝对不可能不求回报 连金吉儿也不例外
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger.

701
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,600
一切还是依他行事
With her, he still covered his bets.

702
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,770
他们在结婚前得先有孩子
They had to have the baby first, before they could get married.

703
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:20,360
他甚至还托我们帮忙看艾美几天…
He even made us watch Amy for a few days...

704
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,950
好让他们去渡蜜月
when they went on their honeymoon.

705
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,750
无所谓啊 我们爱死那孩子
I didn't mind, we loved the kid.

706
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,840
你感到我的眼神？
LESTER: Can you feel my eyes on you?

707
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,500
你感到我看透你的心吗？
Can you feel me look into your heart?

708
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,090
你能感到我躺在你肚皮上吗？
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?

709
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,100
你能在体内感受我？
Can you feel me in you?

710
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,220
在心里？
In your heart?

711
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,690
别等我过去
Don't make me come there.

712
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:52,320
回答我
Answer me.

713
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,240
我爱你
GINGER: [Crying] I love you.

714
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:56,490
宝贝，你知道我也爱你吗？
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?

715
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,740
-不，莱斯特 -你知道吗？
GINGER: No, Lester. LESTER: Do you know that?

716
00:42:58,830 --> 00:42:59,940
知道
GINGER: Yes.

717
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,330
这是我目前能为自己做的 最好的事
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.

718
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,660
没错
That's right.

719
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,540
所以会没事的
So it's going to be okay.

720
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:07,870
你发誓？
Promise?

721
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,840
我希望你幸福
I wish you all the luck in the world.

722
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,710
-真的？ -是，我真的这么想
GINGER: You do? LESTER: Yeah, I do.

723
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,090
这是你目前能做的最好的事
It's the best thing you can do right now.

724
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:19,060
我说真的
I mean this.

725
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,270
你生活会很安稳
You have real security.

726
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,220
甜心，你将坐在赌城最有利的位子
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.

727
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,610
这对我们来说再好不过了
Come on. This is great for us.

728
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,820
我会一直都在你身边的 我哪儿都不会去
I'm always gonna be here for you. I ain't going no place.

729
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,580
我现在就在看着你
I'm looking at you right now.

730
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,670
仿佛生平第一次见到你似的
I'm seeing you for the very first time, right this minute.

731
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,160
我可听到我的心悸动
I'm saying I can feel my heart click.

732
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,840
我看到你十四岁时
I see you 14 years old.

733
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,090
我在见你的第一秒就看到你了
I see you the first second I ever saw you.

734
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,880
我看到你，像匹长腿的小马儿…
I see you, long-legged little colt...

735
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:52,130
还戴着蠢蠢的牙套
stupid braces on your teeth.

736
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,550
-好吧 -我每次见你时都看到这些
Okay, then. LESTER: Every time I see you, that's what I see.

737
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:58,640
再聊罗，再见
Talk to you later. Bye.

738
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,570
-你还好吗？ -嗯
-You all right? -Yeah.

739
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:10,990
为什么哭？
Why are you crying?

740
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,700
我没有哭
I'm not crying.

741
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,710
-别喝这么多了吧 -我没事
-Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. -I'm okay.

742
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:29,930
希望你能理解
You just have to understand.

743
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:33,610
我自小就跟莱斯特在一起
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

744
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,650
我只是想道别
I just wanted to say goodbye.

745
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,400
我只是…
I just....

746
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,740
我想我有权这样做
I think I have a right to do that.

747
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:49,490
好吗？
GINGER: Okay?

748
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:50,700
没关系
It's all right.

749
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,380
你那段人生已经完结了
That part of your life is over with.

750
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,960
-不是吗？ -是的
SAM: Right? GINGER: Yeah.

751
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,330
你现在跟我
You're with me now.

752
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:02,510
-是的 -不是吗？
-Yeah. -Right?

753
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:07,800
-你确定吗？ -是的
SAM: You're sure? GINGER: Yeah.

754
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:18,570
-要走了吗？我们回去吧 -好的
SAM: Want to go? Let's go back in. GINGER: Okay.

755
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,080
很好
GINGER: It's great.

756
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,340
都是我的东西，天呀
GINGER: It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

757
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,180
你把我的东西都带来了！
You brought all my stuff!

758
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:57,750
我不能…
I can't....

759
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,930
试试看，这是你的
Try it on. It's yours.

760
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,100
别开玩笑了
You're kidding.

761
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,510
我的天
My God.

762
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,860
-是什么毛？ -是龙猫
-What is it? -It's chinchilla.

763
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,990
好软喔
It's so soft.

764
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,860
很好喔？
Nice, isn't it?

765
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,450
从没有人对我这么好
No one's ever been so nice to me.

766
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,010
我的老天！
GINGER: Oh, my God!

767
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,420
我要是在同一天将它们全都戴上 会不会太过火啊？
Do you think it's too much if I wear these all on the same day?

768
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,550
你想怎样就怎样
You can do whatever you want.

769
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,340
我有没有实现我的诺言啊？
Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?

770
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,430
你太好了 这些珠宝也不错
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad either.

771
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,270
我们不应该把这些放在家里 应该摆到银行去
We shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in the bank.

772
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,570
我不能留一副在家吗？
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?

773
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,690
仔细听好
Pay attention to me.

774
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,480
我要告诉你一件重要的事
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

775
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,490
这全部都不算什么
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

776
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,990
钱财珠宝 如果没有信任就毫无意义
Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.

777
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,500
我得要信任你到可将生命交给你
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

778
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,210
洛杉矶

779
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,000
总价值超过一百万的现金与珠宝 锁在赌城的银行里…
SAM: With over $1 million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas...

780
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,300
全归她所有 金吉儿非常有安全感
only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.

781
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,680
她最爱那些
She loved that shit.

782
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,930
但在我这行里 手上得有许多流动的现金
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.

783
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,100
贪污的条子与绑匪 他们都不收支票
Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.

784
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,770
考林先生，需要帮忙吗？
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?

785
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,350
所以我在洛杉矶的银行里 也摆了两百万…
SAM: So I put $2 million cash in a Los Angeles bank...

786
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,280
用考林先生与夫人的名义
under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.

787
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,530
这纯粹是我个人的赎金与保金
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.

788
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,500
因为在我最需要这笔钱时 我不是蹲在牢里就是被关在衣柜…
Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money most...

789
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:59,300
所以我将这笔钱唯一的钥匙 给了金吉儿好让我能保命
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.

790
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,730
这是签名卡
This is just a signature card.

791
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,810
她签了之后就会是世上…
Once she signs, she'll be the only person...

792
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,150
唯一可以开保险箱的人 连我都开启不了？
to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?

793
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,810
是的，这是你的要求
BANKER: That's right. That's the way you wanted it.

794
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,620
山姆，我问你个问题
Sam, let me ask you a question.

795
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,490
你一定很信任你老婆
You must really trust your wife.

796
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,080
是啊，怎么啦？
Sure I do. Why?

797
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,410
很好啊，只是很少见
It's good. It's just unusual.

798
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,420
实不相瞒 我有很多客户都不信任
To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.

799
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,730
将金吉儿还有钱的事解决后 我安心多了
SAM: With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.

800
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,390
为了安全起见，我又将头衔…
To play it safe, I switched job titles again...

801
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,690
换成餐饮董事
and made myself Food and Beverage Director.

802
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,310
这样一来就没人可以 为执照的事找我麻烦
This way nobody would bother me about a license.

803
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,450
赌城对我来说像是个梦
Vegas was like a dream for me.

804
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,410
问题是尼奇也梦想着 他自己的赌城
Trouble was Nicky was dreaming of his own kind of Vegas.

805
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,750
我将钱放出，每天三分利
NICKY: I put money out on the street charging three points a week.

806
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,990
庄家高利贷
Juice to the dealers.

807
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,490
-别逼我们找上门 -你不会需要这样的
-Don't make us look for you. -You won't have to look for me.

808
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,460
多谢了，尼奇
I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

809
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:25,130
他们不是烂赌鬼就是烂毒鬼
NICKY: They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.

810
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,630
没多久，坦吉乐一半的庄家 都在我手掌心里
In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.

811
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,890
下一步，我开始出千骗大赌客的钱
Then, the next thing I did, I started busting out high-stakes poker players.

812
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,480
好明显
SAM: It was so obvious.

813
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,720
尼奇所有的小把戏 全都是靠手势
All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were signal-happy.

814
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,510
我下五百
I'm gonna open for $500.

815
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,140
互相打手势
SAM: Signaling back and forth.

816
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,150
尼奇以为没人注意到他 但是他错了
Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong.

817
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,900
我不想要那些探员在我的地盘
I didn't want any of those agents near my place.

818
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,490
-四条A -我不相信
-Four aces. -I can't believe this.

819
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,370
我唯一的运气好像就是手气背
GAMBLER 2: If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.

820
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,370
我真希望尼奇与他那票人 可以马上消失
SAM: I wished Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.

821
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,880
但我能怎样？ 回老家去挑起场战争？
What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war?

822
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,710
尼奇在帮里算是有头有脸的人物 我不能那么做
Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.

823
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,790
到处都是赌博游乐公会的探员
Gaming agents are all over the place.

824
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,220
这儿不允许手气旺的人吗？
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?

825
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,220
你已经旺了一个礼拜了 他们在找机会逮你
You've been lucky all week. They're looking to nail you.

826
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,260
艾斯太在意他的赌场…
NICKY: Ace was so worried about his casino...

827
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,150
他忘了我们当初为什么而来
he forgot what we were doing out here in the first place.

828
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,100
最少有一百万次 我都好想在他耳边大喊…
A million times, I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:

829
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,940
这儿是拉斯维加斯
"This is Las Vegas.

830
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,270
“我们本来就是来抢钱的 你这个蠢犹太人”
"We're supposed to be out here robbing, you dumb fucking hebe. "

831
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,870
我才不在乎他有什么关系
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.

832
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,830
叫他把脚从桌上拿下来
Tell him to take his feet off the table.

833
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,240
他以为这儿是什么廉价的地方？
Does he think this is a goddamn sawdust joint?

834
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,830
先生，麻烦你将脚放下…
Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table...

835
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,460
并将鞋穿上，好吗？
and put your shoes on, please?

836
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,040
是，是很麻烦 我今天已经够背了
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.

837
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,040
那王八蛋动都不动
Fucking asshole won't budge.

838
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,630
叫警卫
Call security.

839
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,520
你好吗？
How are you?

840
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,180
好，你呢？
Good. How are you?

841
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,930
给个面子，把你的脚放下去 然后把鞋穿上好吗？
Do me a favor. Want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes on?

842
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,350
去你的
Fuck you.

843
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,700
我要你把这家伙从赌场架着丢出去…
I want you to exit this guy off the premises, off his feet...

844
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,280
用他的头来开门
and use his head to open the fucking door.

845
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,530
先生，你得离开 麻烦你跟我们出去
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind coming with us outside?

846
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,490
妈的，我哪儿都不跟你去
Bullshit. I ain't going anywhere with you.

847
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,660
-妈的，你给我滚 -去你的！
GUARD: Bullshit. You're out of here. MAN: Fuck you!

848
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,130
你知道你在招惹谁吗？ 你知道吗？
MAN: You know who you're fucking with? Do you?

849
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,370
你他妈的王八蛋！ 你知道你招惹了谁吗？
You fucking faggot! Do you know who you're fucking with?

850
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,220
别碰我！
MAN: Leave me alone!

851
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,880
-喂！ -别闹了！
GUARD: Come on! MAN: You gotta be kidding me!

852
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,220
不出所料，我一小时后就接到电话
SAM: Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.

853
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,130
艾斯，那边怎么了？ 你知道那家伙是跟我的吗？
Ace, what happened over there? Did you know that guy was with me?

854
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,390
我不知道，你知道他做了什么吗？
I didn't know that. You know what he did?

855
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,940
我很有礼貌的走过去 他却叫我回家吃自已
I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.

856
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,020
-还骂我是臭玻璃 -什么？
SAM: Then he called me a faggot. NICKY: What?

857
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,400
-我把那王八蛋踢出去了 -过来
SAM: I threw that cocksucker out. NICKY: Come here.

858
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,780
你骂我的朋友臭玻璃 还叫他回家吃自己？
You called my friend a faggot? Told him to go fuck himself?

859
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,320
你这样说？ 叫他回家吃自己？
Is that what you did? Tell him to go fuck himself?

860
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,740
你这个死乡巴佬！
NICKY: [On phone] You fucking hick, you!

861
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,750
你给我过去道歉
NICKY: You go over there. You apologize.

862
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,700
你最好求他让你进去
NICKY: You better hope he lets you back in.

863
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,000
你要再敢没大没小 我会将你的头打到…
If you get out of line again, I'll smash your head so hard...

864
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,250
你连那牛仔帽都戴不上 死乡巴佬
you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. Fucking hick.

865
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,000
听着，这家伙压根就不知道 自己在跟谁说话
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.

866
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,680
他不知道我们是好兄弟
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

867
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,970
他非常抱歉
He's already very sorry.

868
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,930
但如果你可买我个面子 让他再进去…
But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...

869
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,480
我发誓他再也不会乱来
I swear he'll never get out of line again.

870
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,890
若他再敢乱来，就别想再踏进这儿
If he does it again, he's out for good.

871
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,150
我永远都不会再让他进门
I'll never let him in the place again.

872
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,820
真是对不起
NICKY: I'm sorry about this.

873
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,030
好吗，艾斯？ 谢了，兄弟
All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.

874
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,570
你把鞋都脱了？ 把脚放在桌上？
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table?

875
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,910
你这全身马粪骚的浑蛋！
You shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!

876
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,130
你要敢再去丢我的脸 我会在沙漠里将你埋了
You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.

877
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,790
-快给我去道歉 -尼奇，对不起
NICKY: Go over and apologize. MAN: Nicky, I'm sorry.

878
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,380
艾斯可是个很敏感的人
NICKY: Ace could be a very touchy guy.

879
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,720
尤其是当他在城里越来越出名后
Especially when he got bigger in town.

880
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,010
像他将强纳森与大卫 从凯撒宫挖角来时…
Like when he hired Jonathan and David away from the Palace...

881
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,510
他为他们盖了全新的舞台 还给了他们一人一辆劳斯莱斯
by building them a new stage and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.

882
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,560
但我得说 他真的知道怎么吸引群众
But, I tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.

883
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,730
他懂得一切门路
He knew all the fucking angles.

884
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,350
他将整个蛇蝎美人的秀 从巴黎搬来…
He brought the whole Femme Fatale show from Paris...

885
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,690
但他却忘记那些欧洲跳舞妹有多懒
but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.

886
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,870
他还得每周为她们秤体重 她们的身材才不至于像吹气球
He had to weigh them once a week so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.

887
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,620
你还是4公斤过重
You're still eight pounds over.

888
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,410
-为什么会这样？ -罗斯坦您…
-What's the reason for this? -Mr. Rothstein, sir--

889
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,740
别在那儿您了 她为什么会超重4公斤？
Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?

890
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,870
我只是尊重您
I'm trying to use respect.

891
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,330
罗斯坦先生就可以了
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

892
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,040
嗯，有时当你给她们 太多的压力…
Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them--

893
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,420
你只需要给我答案 给我正确答案就好
All you do is give me answers. Just give me the right answer.

894
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,560
我不知道，她害怕要是不减肥 她就会被解雇
I don't know why. She's frightened if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.

895
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,350
没错，她会被解雇 送她回巴黎…
That's right, she will get fired. Send her back to Paris--

896
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,520
-我们一贯的做法是… -停
-It's been our policy-- -Stop everything.

897
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,600
-她很出名 -这就是问题，她太懒散
AGENT: She's an institution. SAM: That's the problem. She's lazy.

898
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,850
我得佩服这家伙
NICKY: I gotta give the guy credit.

899
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,190
我的意思是 他做了最明显的事
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

900
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,570
这里是全国唯一可以合法签注的地方
This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.

901
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,770
为什么不加以利用呢？
So why not take advantage, right?

902
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,360
所以他把签注从街上…
So he took bookie joints off the street...

903
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,330
开到赌场内
and opened them up inside the casino.

904
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,080
没几年后…
Within a few years, he had...

905
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,960
精华地段的每家赌场都想抄袭他
every casino on The Strip trying to copy off of him.

906
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,790
我的创意…
SAM: Between my innovations...

907
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,840
加上尼奇对工作的投入…
and Nicky's dedication to his job...

908
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,960
我的赌场很快就成为 精华地段中最好的赌场
I soon had the best operation on The Strip.

909
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,350
小心点，你最近很引人注目
Watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you.

910
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,810
怎么，有人抱怨吗？
Why, somebody is complaining?

911
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,440
我从警卫那儿听来的 他们以前都曾是警察
I'm hearing things from security. They're all ex-cops.

912
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,150
警长已将你放入黑名单了
The sheriff wants to put you in the Black Book.

913
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,320
那黑名单根本就是个屁
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.

914
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,480
全国只有两个人的名字在里面
There's two names in it for the whole country...

915
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,360
教父艾尔卡邦就是其中之一
and one of them is still Al Capone.

916
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,240
你上了名单麻烦就大了
They put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.

917
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,830
你将进不了赌场
You won't be able to walk into a casino.

918
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,700
我只不过是在养家活口罢了
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.

919
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,700
我只是跟你讲一声 别说我没警告你
I'm just telling you. Don't say I didn't warn you.

920
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,760
罗斯坦夫人，请看前面 很好，谢谢你
PHOTOGRAPHER: Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead. Very nice. Thank you.

921
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,430
因他的努力与认真…
PHILIP: For his hard work and dedication...

922
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,810
与他为拉斯维加斯带来的新生命…
and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...

923
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,860
山姆将自己建立为赌博游乐业界…
Sam has established himself as an indispensable member...

924
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,020
不可缺乏的成员
of the gaming community.

925
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,730
以坦吉乐赌博游乐集团 董事长的名义…
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation...

926
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:35,240
我很容幸为你们介绍 山姆罗斯坦…
it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein...

927
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,070
维加斯谷乡村俱乐部新成员
to the Vegas Valley Country Club.

928
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,370
嘉许状

929
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,170
要是在老家，我所做的 早就让我蹲牢房去了
SAM: Back home, they'd put me in jail for what I'm doing.

930
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,490
但在这儿，他们却颁奖给我
But out here, they're giving me awards.

931
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,010
我很荣幸能获得…
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation...

932
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:56,630
拉斯维加斯慈善基金会 颁发的嘉许奖状
from the Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas.

933
00:55:57,970 --> 00:55:59,550
恭喜你，甜心
Congratulations, sweetheart.

934
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,220
山姆募得了有史来 最多的捐款
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.

935
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,590
但我最爱的还是看着我老婆 金吉儿周旋全场
SAM: But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife work the room.

936
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,360
他们爱死她了 但你又怎能不爱她？
They all loved her. How could you not love her?

937
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,810
她是世上最有魅力的女人
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.

938
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,490
人们都喜欢在她身边
People loved to be around her.

939
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,250
你一定得带艾美来参加 莎夏的生日派对
You've got to bring Amy to Sasha's birthday party.

940
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,090
星期六下午三点 我们很希望她能来
LADY: We'd love to have her there. 3:00, Saturday.

941
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,630
-好的 -太好了
-Yes, okay. -Great.

942
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:25,500
她让大家都开心
SAM: She made everybody feel good.

943
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:34,810
-恭喜你，山姆 -谢谢
-Congratulations, Sam. -Thanks.

944
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,520
嗨，罗斯坦夫人，你好吗？
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?

945
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,060
你是我见过最美丽的女人 罗斯坦先生，你真是个幸运的男人
You're one of the most gorgeous women I've seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.

946
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,200
多谢夸奖
Thanks for that compliment.

947
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,040
他是赌场里的小伙子 挺好又聪明的小子
SAM: He was a young kid from the casino. Nice kid. Bright boy.

948
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:57,330
这小子真他妈的带种 我第二天就炒了他
What balls on this fucking kid. The next day I fired him.

949
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,720
金吉儿对人就是有这种魅力 她甚至鼓励他们这样
Ginger had that effect on people. I think she even encouraged them.

950
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,550
你想看看这件吗？
GINGER: Do you wanna see this one?

951
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,350
爸爸帮我买了这么多珠宝 因为他好爱我
GINGER: Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.

952
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,600
但不管他们多爱她…
SAM: But as much as they loved her...

953
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,820
真美丽
GINGER: Fabulous.

954
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,820
他们都不知道什么让她感动
...they didn't know what really moved her.

955
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,230
看看这个
GINGER: Look at this.

956
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,980
爸爸给我的…
GINGER: Daddy gave me....

957
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,800
金吉儿快快乐乐的
SAM: With Ginger happy,

958
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,250
我才能专心去做我所专长的…
I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.

959
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,160
较松的机器都在后面
Loose machines are right back over there.

960
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,420
它们在那儿干嘛？ 看都看不到
What are they doing back there? You can't even see them.

961
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,750
好吧
Okay.

962
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,000
那最大累积奖金的那些呢？
What about the progressives with the high jackpots?

963
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,590
这些是我们最好的机子 都是靠它们
These are our best machines. They bring all the action.

964
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:40,680
难怪盈收变少了 重头戏都在前面
No wonder the drop is off. The action is in the front.

965
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,850
-摆到前面去 -好的，我会
-Bring them up front. -All right, I will.

966
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,100
听好了 在这有三种做事方法
Listen carefully. There are three ways of doing things here.

967
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,770
正确的、不正确的 和我的方法
The right way, the wrong way, and the way that I do it.

968
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,740
-懂了没？ -我懂了，马上去办
-Understand? -I do understand. I'll get right on it.

969
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,710
-谢谢 -别谢我，去做就是了
-Thank you. -Don't thank me. Just do it.

970
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,250
你是吃角子老虎机的经理 我不应该还需要告诉你这些
You're the slots manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.

971
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,410
唉，你说得真对 真是抱歉
Dang, you are right. I'm so sorry.

972
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,380
我一天得工作18个小时
SAM: So I ended up working 18-hour days.

973
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,920
金吉儿反倒是成为 真正享受赌城的人
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.

974
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,850
请跟我来，我带您去更好的桌
Come with me, please. I have a better table for you.

975
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,300
你到底跟那王八蛋说了些什么？
What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?

976
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,900
我跟她说我是罗斯坦夫人
I told him that I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

977
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,780
当然得加以利用罗
You might as well get something out of it.

978
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,740
不久后我所担心的事就发生了
SAM: It wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened.

979
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,410
尼奇把自己搞到成为 全赌城的拒绝往来户
Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Vegas.

980
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:36,490
从那时起，我在赌城完全不能 被人看见与他交谈
From then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in or near Vegas.

981
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,460
这他妈的是什么意思？
NICKY: What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

982
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,010
因对业者有害…
"...detrimental to gaming and...

983
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,630
“他将被禁止进入 拉斯维加斯中任何赌场”
"he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.

984
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,560
“违反此规的赌场 在他每次出现时…”
"And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000...

985
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,350
“都将被罚款逾十万元”
"every time he shows up."

986
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,530
-你相信吗？ -是啊，你被禁了
-You believe this shit? -Yeah, you got banned.

987
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,320
“因为众所周知的恶名昭彰”
"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation."

988
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,990
那些浑蛋
Motherfucker.

989
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,540
-有什么可摆平的方法吗？ -不，没办法
-Is there any way around this? -No, there's no way.

990
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,500
例如说…
Let's say, for instance...

991
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,710
我去了家刚好就附设赌场的餐厅…
I want to go into the restaurant, which happens to be in the casino...

992
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,500
为了想吃它的三明治呢？
to get one of those sandwiches I like?

993
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,390
别想了，你连停车场都踏不进去
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot.

994
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,180
就是这么严重
That's how serious it is.

995
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:26,440
-换句话说，我玩完了？ -换几句话都是这意思
-in other words, I'm fucked? -in so many words, yes.

996
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,320
他完全都没了解那黑名单的意义
SAM: It didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.

997
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,490
不能进赌场只是其一…
Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing...

998
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,410
这名单会将你的名字刻在 每一个联邦调查员的脑海里
but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.

999
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,870
你与芝加哥教父是一样的 但尼奇不在乎
You're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.

1000
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,260
我得想想办法 他们赶不走我的
I gotta do something. They ain't getting rid of me.

1001
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,010
他们赶不走我的 我要待在这儿，去他们的
They're not getting rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck them.

1002
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,020
所以他们一开始这鸟规矩…
NICKY: So once they pulled that shit...

1003
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,310
我就开始做自己突发奇想的事情
I started doing my own things in Vegas nobody had thought of doing.

1004
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,910
为了多点眼线 我将我弟弟与些恶汉从老家带来…
To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother and some desperados...

1005
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,700
开始抢劫一些赌场豪客、赌场老大…
from back home and started knocking over high rollers, casino bosses...

1006
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,040
下注组头等等，全部一网打尽
bookmakers, anybody right here in town.

1007
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,040
说真的，我这队人马还真是不错
I had a good fucking crew going for me, I'll tell you that.

1008
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,540
我有沙尔福斯寇 最擅长从二楼进屋偷东西
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.

1009
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,560
杰克哈迪在被关六年前 曾在保险箱制造公司工作
Jack Hardy worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.

1010
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,930
还有本尼布卢 这家伙不论什么警铃都能解除
Then there was Bernie Blue. This guy could bypass any alarm for me.

1011
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,930
就像以前一样
It was like old times.

1012
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,730
我也开了自己的珠宝店 叫做掏金热潮
I opened up my own jewelry store, too. The Gold Rush.

1013
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,690
有时我会为了刺激好玩 而参与偷窃
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1014
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:42,160
我不喜欢被我偷的人看着我…
I didn't like the people I was ripping off looking at me...

1015
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,500
所以我都将他们的照片转过去
so I turned their fucking pictures around.

1016
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,670
-为什么这么久？ -这东西真他妈的！
NICKY: What's taking so long? JACK: This is a motherfucker!

1017
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:52,080
-在动了 -学会怎么开就不用整个搬走了
It's working. NICKY: Learn to open these instead of taking them.

1018
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,380
这些宝石的瑕疵真多
NICKY: These stones got a lot of niggers in them.

1019
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,710
那该死的皮皮要是私下偷换钻石…
If that fucking Pepe's switching stones on us...

1020
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:00,220
他最好给我骑骆驼回奈及利亚
he better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.

1021
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,640
-他们在总统套房K -单独登记吗？
-They're in Penthouse "K." -Check in alone?

1022
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,570
-是的 -他们出去了吗？
-They checked in alone. -Are they out now?

1023
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,690
-是，别担心 -好的，谢啦
-Yes. Don't worry. -All right. Thanks.

1024
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,730
我们在整城里都有线民 从旅馆侍者…
SAM: He had tipsters all over town. Bellmen...

1025
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,950
-得快点 -好的
-You got to hurry. -Okay.

1026
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,490
-停车小弟… -他们正在登记
-...valet parkers... -They're just checking in now.

1027
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,170
-我会告诉他 -赌区经理…
-I'll tell him. -...pit bosses...

1028
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,500
在西洛可的1230房
Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1029
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,500
-1230房，收到 -还有秘书
-1 230. Right. -...secretaries.

1030
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,300
-完美状况的硬币 -完美状况吗？收到
-Mint condition coins. -Mint condition? All right.

1031
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,170
他们当然都有一份
SAM: They all got a piece of the score.

1032
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,760
车来了
MAN: Car's coming.

1033
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,890
他们都很谨慎
SAM: They were very careful.

1034
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,560
他们每次都先解除警铃 要不然…
They always bypassed the alarms, or else, if not...

1035
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,280
就在墙上打洞然后凿墙而入
they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1036
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,940
尼奇能偷的都偷了
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

1037
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,070
外头根本没有人想到 会有像他那样的人
Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.

1038
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,840
对尼奇来说 拉斯维加斯就像是蛮荒西部
For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.

1039
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,080
我才刚拿到一批从以色列来的钻石
I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.

1040
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,900
他们他妈的想要我怎样？
NICKY: What the fuck did they expect from me?

1041
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,210
我得赚钱，不是吗？
I had to earn, didn't I?

1042
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,390
-这些钻石有瑕疵 -没有瑕疵
-This diamond has flaws in it. -There's no flaws in it.

1043
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,390
别告诉我怎么做 我在这行已经25年了
Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 25 years.

1044
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,730
你的放大镜最好擦干净点 因为这批钻石没有瑕疵
You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws in this diamond.

1045
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,480
通常要是附近来的货…
NICKY: When we got local merch...

1046
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,850
我们都会送到棕榈泉市 或是亚利桑那州与洛杉矶
we'd usually send it to Palm Springs, or Arizona, L.A.

1047
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,030
我有几个熟识的中东佬 你知道，阿拉伯人
I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.

1048
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,700
你们是要开会还是要买钻石？
Are you gonna have a meeting or buy some diamonds?

1049
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,990
我懂他的语言，我跟他讲讲
I know his language. I'm talking with him.

1050
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,910
全部四万块
$40,000, you buy the whole package.

1051
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,080
两万，不要拉倒
$20,000. That's my final offer.

1052
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:31,200
他突然会说英文了 别玩游戏了，两万五
He suddenly talks English. Let's talk turkey. $25,000.

1053
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,340
我将我的房间改为保险箱 保留一些我特选的好东西
NICKY: I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

1054
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,770
因为警察可能会突然临检 所以不能将其留在店里…
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush in case we got raided by the cops...

1055
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,610
也防止我手下手痒
or if my crew got cute.

1056
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,320
我保有唯一的钥匙 珍妮佛才不在乎
I had the only key. Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1057
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,360
她每晚都在沙发上 看电影看到睡着
She fell asleep on the couch watching TV every night.

1058
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,480
这些全是我的东西 我一样也没送回老家
This stuff was all mine. I didn't send any of this back home.

1059
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,750
其实我也不行 因为我根本不应该做这些
Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.

1060
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:00,410
老大们光是赌场就赚饱了…
The bosses were making so much money with the casinos...

1061
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,830
他们不希望有人惹是非
that they didn't want anybody making any waves.

1062
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,170
你的人马每人都分到了吗？
You've all given your crew a piece of that?

1063
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,840
我大家都罩好了
I took care of everybody.

1064
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,010
这就是为什么在我来之前 拉斯维加斯并没有犯罪集团
NICKY: That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.

1065
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,730
但我家衣柜里又能藏多少钱呢？
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?

1066
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,900
你必须要了解 而我也相信你了解…
You have to understand, and I'm sure you do...

1067
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,690
做这种风险大的投资…
that in a venture of this kind...

1068
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,190
要有可能亏损的心理准备
you must be prepared to take some kind of loss.

1069
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:28,030
我将一些钱交给查理克拉克 艾斯的银行经理，做一些正当投资
NICKY: I put some money in legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1070
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,120
-你会尽力而为，不是吗？ -是的
-You will try to push it through, won't you? -Yes.

1071
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,410
你得了解我现在 给了你五万元现金
You got to understand, I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

1072
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,080
然后我将更多钱投入正当的投资 例如我开的餐馆
NICKY: Then I put more money in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1073
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,800
-剩这个了？ -是
DOMINICK: Is that the last one? COOK: Yeah.

1074
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,210
我让我小弟，多明尼可经营
NICKY: I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it.

1075
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,800
王八蛋
Fuckers.

1076
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,150
在这里
DOMINICK: Here you go, guys.

1077
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,480
-谢了 -慢慢享用
-Thanks a lot. -Enjoy it. Have a good time.

1078
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,690
-噎死你，王八蛋 -嗨，小多
-Choke on it, motherfucker. -Hi, Dom.

1079
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,020
你怎么样？
How you doing?

1080
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,980
是啊，尼奇很喜欢餐馆 他对开餐厅也很拿手
SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff.

1081
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,780
这么多年来，他逢开餐厅必赚
And over the years, he always made money with them.

1082
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,280
他在拉斯维加斯开了比萨斜塔 很受大家欢迎
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower. It was a very popular spot.

1083
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:11,500
常有政客、脱衣舞娘 还有电影明星光顾
He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over.

1084
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,170
佛罗明哥的那场秀越做越好罗
That show at The Flamingo gets better and better.

1085
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,550
对了，山姆说 请你有空时打个电话给他
By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call.

1086
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,550
-你也变传话的了啊？ -有钱我什么都做啊
-Made you a messenger, too? -I'll do anything for a buck.

1087
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,060
-他对每个人都这样，好好享用晚餐 -谢啦
-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner. -Thanks.

1088
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,890
尼奇最喜欢的 当然就是脱衣舞娘
SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.

1089
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,100
对她们来说，尼奇像是电影名星
To them, Nicky was the movie star.

1090
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,030
-你就这样走过？ -这是雪莉
-You walk past me? -This is Shelly.

1091
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,160
-嗨，雪莉，你好吗？ -嗨
-Hi, Shelly. How are you? -Hi.

1092
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,740
这是史黛希
This is Stacy.

1093
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,080
-这是尼克，想吃晚餐吗？一起吧 -好啊
-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on. -All right.

1094
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,700
我带你去厨房看看 失陪一下
Let's check the kitchen first. Excuse us one second.

1095
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,330
来吧，我带你去 我每天都空运新鲜的东西进来
NICKY: Come on, I'll show you. I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1096
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,680
我从老家运面包 从加州运鱼
I get bread from back home. I get fish from California.

1097
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:53,340
光从我们用奶喂食的小牛肉就看得出 我们绝对是好餐厅
You can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1098
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,310
这就是诀窍 奶喂小牛的肉是纯白色的
That's the secret. See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1099
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,480
其他餐馆都用那种粉红色的小牛肉 过去点，甜心
Out here, they got that pink veal. Slide over, honey.

1100
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,110
粉红色的那种小牛肉 你就算是追个两天两夜
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.

1101
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,780
它还是不会变嫩 你懂我的意思吗？
NICKY: It'll never ever get tender. You know what I mean?

1102
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:10,740
我从这儿拿钱离开时 在街上被抢了
AL: I left here with the money. Got muscled on the street.

1103
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,120
是几个我欠钱的家伙 所以我把钱给他们了
A couple guys, I owe them. So I gave them the money.

1104
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,290
-就是这样 -是吗？
-That's what I did. -Yeah?

1105
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,340
你还敢自称是男人吗？
You call yourself a man?

1106
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,800
你知道你是个撒谎的杂碎 他妈的烂赌的狗东西吗？
You know you're a lying lowlife, motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?

1107
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,550
你知道自己是什么东西吗？ 家里有两个小孩
You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home.

1108
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,680
我给你钱付房租…
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...

1109
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,800
买菜、开暖气
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1110
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:33,440
你知道你老婆打给法兰克 说家里连暖气都被停了吗？
You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fucking heat's off?

1111
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,980
你没拿钱去赌吗？ 你敢这样跟我说吗？
You didn't gamble that money? Can you tell me that?

1112
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,700
-你没有吗？ -没有
-No, you didn't? -I didn't.

1113
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,990
别耍我，艾尔！ 别把我当傻子
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me.

1114
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,200
你当我是傻子是吧？ 你没去赌？
You wanna make a fool out of me? You didn't gamble?

1115
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,870
告诉我你把钱拿去赌掉了 我就给你钱回去交电费！
Tell me you gambled the money and I'll give you the money to put the heat on!

1116
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,990
有没有赌？
Did you gamble?

1117
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,180
真是他妈的狗东西
Fucking degenerate, you.

1118
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,460
孩子在家里
Fucking kids at home.

1119
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,350
拿去，给我滚
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

1120
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,980
-谢了，尼克 -是啊，谢了
AL: Thanks, Nick. NICKY: Yeah, thanks.

1121
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,980
若被我知道是你搞砸的 我会把你扔在我找到你的地方
If I find out you fucked up, I'll leave you where I find you.

1122
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,160
-你要吃几个？ -两个
NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat? NICKY JR.: Two.

1123
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,830
但早上六点半，当他下班时…
SAM: At around 6:30 a.m., when he finished his day...

1124
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,120
不管他在那里或是在做什么…
no matter where he was or what he was doing...

1125
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:23,340
他都会回家为儿子，小尼奇做早餐
he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.

1126
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,000
我知道你喜欢
NICKY: I know you like this.

1127
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:29,140
一点点牛油，对不对？ 不要很多，你知道为什么，对不对？
NICKY: A little butter, right? Not a lot. You know why, right?

1128
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,010
-为什么？ -因为会堵塞心脏
NICKY: Why? NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1129
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:34,900
你真是聪明的孩子
What a smart kid you are.

1130
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,860
快吃吧
NICKY: Okay, eat.

1131
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:40,110
每隔几个礼拜我就会派玛雷诺 去老大那儿…
NICKY: Every couple of weeks, I sent Marino back to the bosses...

1132
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,500
也分他们一份
with a piece of what I made.

1133
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:44,120
当然不是很多，但他们哪知道？
Not a big piece, but what did they know?

1134
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:47,830
他们在2500里外，天高皇帝远
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.

1135
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:50,160
收货地点是个修车场…
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

1136
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,380
利蒙他们以前常在那儿数钱
where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.

1137
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:57,390
条子们也知道，但他们不在乎 他们早协议好了
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. They worked it out.

1138
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,390
尼奇向你们问好
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1139
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,520
我知道怎样让老大们服服帖帖
NICKY: I knew how to keep the bosses happy.

1140
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,590
每当他们有些小事需要我做
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,

1141
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:04,970
例如传个话之类的…
you know, to send a message...

1142
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:08,730
我一定做到完美
I would carry things out to a "T."

1143
01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:13,070
就像那次东尼道格 那个听说是城里的新硬汉…
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1144
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,910
在利蒙的一家酒吧乱开枪
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1145
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,660
这浑蛋打死了两个利蒙的手下…
Here's a fucking guy who kills two of Remo's guys...

1146
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,500
还有一个代班的倒霉女侍者
and a poor fucking waitress who was just working on her night off.

1147
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:32,840
这家伙根本就 等着被我们杀鸡儆猴
This guy's just begging to be made an example of.

1148
01:07:33,230 --> 01:07:36,600
我要知道当天有谁跟他一起动手
I want the names of all the other people he had with him.

1149
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:40,350
我要你不择手段去查 懂不懂？
I don't care what you have to do to them to get them. You understand?

1150
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,640
我搞定，利蒙
FRANK: I'll take care of it.

1151
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:45,820
说真的，我还蛮佩服这浑蛋的
NICKY: To be truthful with you, I had to admire this fucking guy.

1152
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:48,320
他真是我所遇过 最硬脖子的爱尔兰人
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.

1153
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,570
这家伙真是个硬汉
This son of a bitch was tough.

1154
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:54,540
我们痛殴了他两天两夜
For two days and two nights, we beat the shit out of him.

1155
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:56,670
还用冰锉刺他的G丸
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

1156
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,880
他最好快吐个名字出来 法兰克，要不然我就递你的上去
NICKY: Hope he gives me a name, or I'll give him yours, Frank.

1157
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,040
谢谢喔
FRANK: Thanks a lot.

1158
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,210
但他守口如瓶
NICKY: But he never talked.

1159
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,010
我知道你要供早就供了
NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.

1160
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,800
最后，我还得他妈的把他的头 摆在夹板里
NICKY: In the end, I had to put his fucking head in a vice.

1161
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,350
你听到了没？
NICKY: Can you hear me?

1162
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,810
听好，你的头在夹板里
Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.

1163
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:17,020
再不给我个名字 我就夹爆你的头
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.

1164
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,480
别逼我这么做，拜托你快说吧
NICKY: Don't make me do this. Please, come on.

1165
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,740
别逼我当坏人
Don't make me be a bad guy.

1166
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:24,780
去你的
Fuck you.

1167
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,990
王八蛋，你相信吗？ 他妈的两天两夜
Motherfucker. You believe this? Two fucking days and nights.

1168
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:31,080
去我的？你这个王八蛋！
Fuck me? You motherfucker!

1169
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,920
去我老母？ 你是这意思是吧？
Fuck my mother? Is that what you're telling me?

1170
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:35,670
你这浑蛋！
You motherfucker!

1171
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:40,140
天呀，给我一个名字！
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!

1172
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:41,640
查理
Charlie M.

1173
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,310
-查理 -查理？
-Charlie M. -Charlie M?

1174
01:08:44,650 --> 01:08:47,320
你逼我将你眼珠都爆出来…
You make me pop your eye out your head...

1175
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,230
就为了保护这狗屁名字？
to protect that piece of shit?

1176
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,280
王八蛋加蠢才！
You dumb motherfucker!

1177
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:54,070
杀了我啊，浑蛋！
Kill me, you fuck!

1178
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:56,360
你这王八蛋！
You motherfucker!

1179
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:59,110
法兰克，你帮帮他吧
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.

1180
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,870
镇上流传着…
SAM: Word got around that finally...

1181
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,090
说这儿终于出了个真的帮派份子
there was a real gangster in town.

1182
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:07,290
尼奇成了拉斯维加斯的新老大
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

1183
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:17,010
四个轮，一排七个 三个一万五的奖金
SAM: Four reels, sevens across. Three $15,000 jackpots.

1184
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:19,060
你知道这机率是多少吗？
You have any idea what the odds are?

1185
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:21,100
要好几百万，可能更多
It's gotta be in the millions. Maybe more.

1186
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,900
二十分钟内三个大奖？
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?

1187
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:25,600
你为什么没停机？ 为什么没通知我？
Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?

1188
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:28,370
发生得太快，一下就三个人赢 我还没机会
It happened quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance.

1189
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,410
你没看到出千吗？
You didn't see the scam?

1190
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,000
这无法确定
There's no way to determine that.

1191
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,240
有，绝对有 他们赢了就是最好的证据
Yes, there is. An infallible way. They won!

1192
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:37,050
这里是赌场，总会有人赢的
It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

1193
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,630
你气死我了 你在污辱我的智慧
You're pissing me off. You're insulting my intelligence.

1194
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,870
你认为我是白痴？
You think I'm an idiot?

1195
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:45,260
一定有人对转轮动了手脚
Somebody had to get into those machines and set the reels.

1196
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,180
一台机的机率是一百五十万比一
The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.

1197
01:09:48,270 --> 01:09:51,640
连续三台的机率是好几兆比一 这根本不可能
On three machines in a row, it's in the billions. It can't happen.

1198
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:53,430
你到底是怎么了？
SAM: What's the matter with you?

1199
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:56,820
你难道不知道你被骗了吗？
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?

1200
01:09:56,950 --> 01:10:00,200
-你没看到吗？ -我觉得你有些反应过度
-You didn't see that? -I think you're overreacting.

1201
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:02,030
听着，智障，我受够你了
Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.

1202
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,200
我从到这儿时就一直罩你
I've carried your ass ever since I got here.

1203
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:06,330
把东西收收走吧
Get your things and get out of here.

1204
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:09,870
-你开除我？ -我就开除你
-You're firing me? -I'm firing you.

1205
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,960
-你可能会后悔 -留你我一定后悔
-You might regret this. -I'll regret it if I keep you.

1206
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:16,630
-不应该这样对人 -若你不知道有人出千…
-This is not the way to treat people. -If you didn't know about the scam...

1207
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,520
你就蠢到不配在这儿工作 若你知道，你就是共犯
you're too dumb to work here. If you did, you were in on it.

1208
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,600
不管怎样，你都得走
Either way, you're out. Go on.

1209
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:26,310
在我看来那家伙已经被炒了
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.

1210
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:29,400
你不能开除他 他的姐夫是县辅导
You can't fire him. His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1211
01:10:29,530 --> 01:10:33,480
这里每个穿马靴的不是辅导 就是辅导的亲戚
Everyone out here with cowboy boots is a commissioner or related to one.

1212
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:34,990
我受够了
I'm sick of this.

1213
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,240
这是他的州，他的叔叔是大法官
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge.

1214
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,740
他的姐夫管理县委员会
His brother-in-law runs the County Commission.

1215
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,790
一定有方法让他回来
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.

1216
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,910
你是搞帐目的，在楼上 你看不到下面发生的事
You're in the finances, upstairs. You don't see what's going on.

1217
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:48,840
我有上千的赌客 却只有五百个庄家
I've got thousands of players. I got 500 dealers.

1218
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:51,680
他们每天24小时都在想着 怎么将我抢空
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1219
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:55,010
我必须要让他们知道 我随时都在注意每个细节
I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.

1220
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,770
我不会漏掉任何一样事情
That there is not one single thing I will not catch.

1221
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,690
看你的，看
SAM: Look at yours. Look at that.

1222
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:04,360
再看这个，什么都没有
SAM: Look at this. There's nothing.

1223
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:06,450
你看你的蓝莓那么多
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.

1224
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:09,280
-我一个都没有 -你在说什么？
-I have nothing. -What are you talking about?

1225
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:12,120
自己不动手做就弄不好
If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.

1226
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:13,530
你要去哪儿？
PHILIP: Where are you going?

1227
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:19,370
从现在开始 我要你全都放同份量的蓝莓
SAM: From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1228
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,510
你知道那多花时间吗？
Do you know how long that will take?

1229
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,380
我不管要多久 每个松饼的份量都要一致
I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1230
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,150
再吃一点，乖
Just a little. That a girl.

1231
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,860
-你要找妈妈？ -来妈妈这儿？
SAM: Wanna go to Mommy? GINGER: Wanna come to Mommy?

1232
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:42,780
好的，甜心
It's all right, sweetheart.

1233
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,200
我要跟你谈谈，我需要点钱
GINGER: I need to talk to you. I need some money.

1234
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:49,840
-你要什么？ -抱好了吗？
-What do you need? -Got her?

1235
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:54,370
我需要很多，比平时要多
I need a lot. I need more than usual.

1236
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:56,590
为什么不从你户头领呢？
Why don't you take it out of your account?

1237
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,760
我本想，只是…
I would, it's just that...

1238
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:03,180
我需要更多，我要两万五
I need more than that. I need $25,000.

1239
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:05,770
两万五千元？
$25,000?

1240
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,730
-你自己要？ -是啊
-For yourself? -Yeah.

1241
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:11,060
你为什么要那么多？
SAM: Why do you need that much?

1242
01:12:11,740 --> 01:12:13,900
有什么差别？我需要就是了
What's the difference? I just need it.

1243
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:17,910
我一定得问啊 那很多钱耶，又不只是一盒爆米花
I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. It's not a box of popcorn.

1244
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,620
我们不用将这变成件大事
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.

1245
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:22,380
我们不用吵架
We don't have to have a fight.

1246
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,380
只是对我很重要，算了 有些想做的事罢了
GINGER: It was important to me. Forget it. Something I wanted to do.

1247
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:30,180
谁在吵架？ 告诉我钱的用处
Who's fighting? Tell me what it's for.

1248
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:34,720
为什么不能告诉我？
Why can't you tell me what it's for?

1249
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:41,890
现在我要你告诉我
Now I want you to tell me.

1250
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:45,900
我老婆跑来问我要两万五 你想买大衣吗？
My wife comes to me and asks me for $25,000. Do you want a coat?

1251
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:48,400
-不 -如果想买大衣，就去买啊
GINGER: No. SAM: If you want a coat, you got it.

1252
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,110
不是钱的问题 只是，你为什么要？
It's not the money. It's just, why do you want it?

1253
01:12:51,290 --> 01:12:52,870
我无权过问吗？
Am I not entitled to ask that?

1254
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,530
我一辈子都很独立 我从不为任何事求人
I've been independent all my life. I never had to ask anybody for anything.

1255
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:58,540
现在你要我求你是吧
Now you're making me beg you for this.

1256
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:02,050
-你在说什么？ -好，你还羞辱我
-What are you talking about? -Okay? And you're embarrassing me.

1257
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,970
-为什么得让我如此难受？ -你问我要两万五
Why make me feel so bad? SAM: You're asking me for $25,000.

1258
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,470
我不是要让你难堪 我只是希望能信任你
I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you.

1259
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:10,180
是信任问题
It's about trust.

1260
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:13,970
我必须要连性命都能交托于你
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

1261
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,570
你懂吗？
Do you understand?

1262
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:18,150
我能信任你吗？
Can I trust you?

1263
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:28,410
我能吗？告诉我
Can I trust you? Answer me.

1264
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:32,290
你能
You can trust me.

1265
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:35,000
好，那你就可以告诉我 钱要拿来干嘛
Good. So then you can tell me what the money is for.

1266
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,620
她现在正离开银行
She's leaving the bank now.

1267
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,120
我跟着她
I'll follow her.

1268
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:04,170
那是什么？
LESTER: What is that?

1269
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,500
我知道那神情，那表情是什么意思？
I know that look. What does that look mean?

1270
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,090
意思是我有钱
GINGER: It means I got the money.

1271
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:29,610
你好吗？是莱斯特吧？
How are you doing? It's Lester, right?

1272
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:40,090
我记得你不是玩牌老手…
From my recollection, aren't you the card shark...

1273
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:44,710
高尔夫球骗子 比佛利山庄的皮条客吗？
the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1274
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:48,760
若记错了，请纠正我
SAM: If I'm wrong, correct me.

1275
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,760
我从不知道你也是个小偷
I never knew you to be a heist man.

1276
01:14:51,690 --> 01:14:53,400
不过如果是的话，这样吧
But if you are, you know what?

1277
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:55,940
我的也拿去吧
Here, take mine, too.

1278
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:59,100
拿吧，反正你已拿了她的
Take it. You already have hers.

1279
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:01,490
她是我老婆
She's my wife.

1280
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:03,900
看着我
SAM: Look at me.

1281
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,710
你知道吧？ 你知道她是我老婆吧？
You did know that, didn't you? You knew she's my wife?

1282
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,580
-看着我 -我知道
SAM: Look at me. LESTER: I know that.

1283
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:11,700
知道啊？
SAM: You do, yeah?

1284
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:16,720
你下次若再想回来…
If you ever come back again...

1285
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,890
拿她的钱，记得带枪
to take her money, next time bring a pistol.

1286
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,640
这样你才有机会
That way you got a chance.

1287
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:24,810
当个男人，别做皮条客
Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.

1288
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:29,560
现在，卖我个面子 快滚吧
Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here.

1289
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,370
我想跟我老婆独处 给我他妈的滚
I wanna be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.

1290
01:15:40,460 --> 01:15:42,080
浑蛋狗杂种
SAM: Fucking piece of shit.

1291
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,850
记得那晚你打电话跟他道别吗？
Remember when you called him that night and said goodbye to him?

1292
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,970
他并没说：   “别结婚，我马上来”
He didn't say, "Don't get married. I'll be right down."

1293
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:01,150
-他没这样说吧？ -不，没有
-He didn't say that, did he? -No, he didn't.

1294
01:16:01,230 --> 01:16:02,860
那他说了什么？
What did he say?

1295
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:08,820
“跟他睡，捞光他的钱”
"Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got."

1296
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,910
过来，我给你看样东西
Come here. I want to show you something.

1297
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,920
叫他们停！
GINGER: Make them stop it!

1298
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:36,100
不是他的错！是我的错！
It's not his fault! It's my fault!

1299
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,910
没用的狗杂种
THUG: Piece of shit.

1300
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,260
自己来吧，你这没胆的浑蛋！
LESTER: Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!

1301
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,770
他太可恶了
He's such a prick.

1302
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:08,260
他叫旅馆的人揍他
He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.

1303
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,980
他自己不想动手
He didn't want to do it himself.

1304
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,520
他不想将手弄脏
He didn't want to get his own hands dirty.

1305
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,830
他为什么要这样？
Why did he have to do that?

1306
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,650
告诉我
Tell me.

1307
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:23,280
-那不是件好事… -废话
NICKY: It wasn't a nice thing to do-- GINGER: No shit.

1308
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,300
你得了解，
You gotta understand it.

1309
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:27,000
他并不知道这人 是不是在骗你的钱
He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down.

1310
01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:32,170
我在结婚前就告诉过他这个人了
I told him all about this guy before we got married.

1311
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:35,340
-这并不是什么新鲜事 -是吗？我并不知道
-This is no fucking surprise. -You did? I didn't know that.

1312
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:39,220
他只是我的朋友 我想要帮他，有什么大不了？
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help. So what?

1313
01:17:41,150 --> 01:17:43,640
我第一次看到你们俩在一起时…
The first time I ever saw you guys together...

1314
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:46,110
我从未见他那么快乐过
I never saw him so happy.

1315
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:49,610
我知道他是个犹太疯子…
NICKY: I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything...

1316
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:53,450
但我从未见过他跟别人一起时这样
but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.

1317
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:57,580
他为你疯狂 他真的很爱你
I think he's crazy about you. He really loves you.

1318
01:17:57,670 --> 01:17:59,410
-他真的是 -拜托
NICKY: He does. GINGER: Come on.

1319
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,790
我是睁着双眼走进这关系的
I went into this with my eyes open.

1320
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:04,130
我知道随时都可能变卦
GINGER: I knew the bottom could drop out any time.

1321
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:08,050
我也混过，你真以为 我在没有保障的情况下…
I'm a working girl. You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this...

1322
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,430
会走这条路吗？
if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?

1323
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,390
是啊，我可以了解
Sure, I can see that.

1324
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:16,730
他买了好多珠宝给我 好多好多
So he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.

1325
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,860
很多贵重的珠宝？ 大概值多少？
A lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?

1326
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:21,950
你想偷吗？
You want to steal it?

1327
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:26,320
不，只是好奇 我是在想…
No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...

1328
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:29,160
他会在那种东西里 投入多少钱
how much he would put into a thing like that.

1329
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,090
他跟我说大约一百万 可能更多
I'm told it's worth about $1 million, maybe more.

1330
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:34,590
那就是罗 这说明了什么？
NICKY: There you go. What does that tell you?

1331
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,090
一百万的珠宝
$1 million in jewelry.

1332
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:38,960
这不说明了他爱你爱到疯了吗？
Does that tell you he is crazy about you?

1333
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,810
我根本就不该嫁给他的
I should have never married him.

1334
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,850
他是双子座的，双子加三级，两面人
He's a Gemini. Triple Gemini. Duality.

1335
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:48,690
双子座就像条蛇 你不能相信蛇
Gemini is the snake, you know. You can't trust a snake.

1336
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:52,350
我说真的
I mean it.

1337
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:54,690
我懂你的意思，金吉儿，听着
I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.

1338
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:59,490
这可能不是… 我也没有答案
This is probably not.... I don't have the answers anyway.

1339
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,330
-这可能不是你想听的 -我想
-This is probably not what you want to hear. -I do.

1340
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:04,700
你不高兴，我可以理解…
You're a little upset, and I understand that.

1341
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,470
但先撑着点吧 慢慢来，看看会发生什么事
But try to make the best of it now. Go slow. See what happens.

1342
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:11,970
他差点杀了他！
He could've killed him!

1343
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,770
他用不着打他 我又没跟他上床
He didn't have to hit him. I'm not sleeping with the guy.

1344
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,060
他让我得偷偷摸摸的 跟我的朋友见面
He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.

1345
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,970
这算什么呢？
What the fuck is that all about?

1346
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:24,890
我想是因为他太爱你了吧 他吃醋又担心
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worries.

1347
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:27,490
谁会在乎我做什么？
Who gives a fuck what I do?

1348
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,490
我会试着问问到底怎样
I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.

1349
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,740
-遇到他时我会跟他谈谈的 -好
-When I see him, I'll talk to him. -Okay.

1350
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:36,000
-可以吗？ -好
-All right? -Yeah.

1351
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,590
谢了…
Thanks...

1352
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,080
忍受我唠叨
for putting up with me.

1353
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,800
别喝这么凶吧 这只会让情况更糟
Take it easy with this shit. This can only make matters worse.

1354
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:46,840
你是个美女，别搞砸了
You're a beautiful girl. Don't ruin that.

1355
01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:49,810
我看过太多漂亮女孩 因这个变丑八怪
I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.

1356
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,060
你真好
You're so nice.

1357
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,190
好了啦 我不想见你不快乐
Come on, now. I don't wanna see you unhappy.

1358
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,600
谢了
Thanks.

1359
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,870
没事啦
It's all right.

1360
01:20:18,970 --> 01:20:21,930
县辅导派特委布来见你
County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.

1361
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:24,680
-等一下 -好的，请稍候
-Give me a minute. -Okay. Just a minute.

1362
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,330
你需要什么吗？
RECEPTIONIST: Can I get you anything?

1363
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,790
不，谢谢，小姐
No, thank you, little lady.

1364
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,340
让他进来，然后四分钟后打给我
Send him in and call me four minutes after.

1365
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:52,890
罗斯坦先生，我是派特委布
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.

1366
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,220
你好吗？
How do you do?

1367
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:56,350
-幸会 -我常听起你的事
-It is a pleasure. -I heard a lot about you.

1368
01:20:56,430 --> 01:20:59,350
过奖了，庄家最近还过得去
PAT: Thank you, sir. House is doing well.

1369
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:02,270
那么多钱滚滚而来
All that money is rolling in.

1370
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:05,400
我很感激你愿意见我这老公仆
I appreciate you taking the time to see a poor old civil servant.

1371
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:07,860
-不如坐下吧？ -谢谢您
SAM: Why don't you have a seat? PAT: Thank you, sir.

1372
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,240
我是来亲自化解…
PAT: I come here personally to smooth over...

1373
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:14,290
一些小误会的
any fracas about a certain matter.

1374
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,710
你可能不知道…
Maybe you didn't know it...

1375
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:19,910
但道恩华德在镇上挺受欢迎的
but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.

1376
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:24,540
他有许多朋友 他们家族及产业也很久了
He's got lots of friends. His family and their money go back many years.

1377
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:27,550
朋友是选民 家人与金钱都能助选
Friends vote, family and money votes.

1378
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,720
这对你我都很重要
That's important to me and you.

1379
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:35,850
若你从这个角度 来看我们这个小问题的话…
If you'll think about our little problem along them lines...

1380
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:38,770
很抱歉我得这么说…
and you'll forgive me for saying it...

1381
01:21:39,070 --> 01:21:41,230
但他可能不该被开除
maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

1382
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,440
他非常清楚我们…
He knew about our getting hit...

1383
01:21:44,620 --> 01:21:47,660
在一瞬间被赢了三个大奖 但他却袖手旁观
on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.

1384
01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,660
他要不是跟他们一伙 那很抱歉，他就是蠢到看不见
Either he was in on it or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.

1385
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,300
不论如何，我都无法让一个 这样的人在这儿工作
Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.

1386
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,580
在将过错都推给道恩前…
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don...

1387
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,050
我们得先确定有证据这样指控他
we better be sure we can prove them charges.

1388
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,390
相信我，要是有证据 他早就被逮捕了
Believe me, if I could prove it, he'd be under arrest.

1389
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:10,440
你确定要让赌博游乐委员会…
Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board...

1390
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:13,980
过目你与你的帮派朋友 尼奇的记录吗？
eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky?

1391
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,690
我觉得你这样跟我说 有点太过份了
I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.

1392
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:21,120
你所说的几乎是毁谤 你无权怀疑我的专业
What you're saying is libelous. You're in no position to challenge my expertise.

1393
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:24,660
我已尽我所能去 帮助并善待那孩子
I went way out of my way to be helpful and courteous to that kid.

1394
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,210
他太弱了也很无能 他使这地方濒于险境
He's weak. He's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place.

1395
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,380
我对他真的无能为力
There's not much more I can do for him.

1396
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:31,760
这倒是真的
You have got me there.

1397
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:36,600
道恩就像公猪身上的奶头一样无用
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.

1398
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:39,800
但他还是我的小舅子…
But he is my brother-in-law...

1399
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:43,230
我会当是我欠你的一个人情
and I would look on it as a personal favor...

1400
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,570
若你愿意考虑重新聘用他
if you'd think some more on hiring him back.

1401
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:47,690
我不能
I can't do that.

1402
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:51,270
我知道他是你的小舅子
I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law.

1403
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,650
我也想帮你更喜欢卖人情
I do want to help you and I like to do favors.

1404
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,030
我也知道你的地位 但我真的不能这么做
And I know who you are. But I cannot do that.

1405
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:01,420
日后是否会有其它较适合的…
Could there be any position...

1406
01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:03,840
职位呢？
farther down the trough?

1407
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,090
抱歉，并没有
I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

1408
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:11,340
他太无能了 最终还是他不能被信任
He's too incompetent. The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.

1409
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,140
好吧，谢谢
SAM: Okay, thanks a lot.

1410
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:20,940
抱歉
That's it. I'm sorry.

1411
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:25,150
罗斯坦先生 你们这帮人永远都不会懂…
Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand...

1412
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,360
这里的世界如何运作
the way it works out here.

1413
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,120
你们只不过来此地做客
You're all just our guests.

1414
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:32,840
但却喧宝夺主
But you act like you're at home.

1415
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,170
让我告诉你，老兄 这并不是你家
Let me tell you something, partner. You ain't home.

1416
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,260
家是我们州长生气时 送你们回的地方
But that's where we'll send you if it harelips the Governor.

1417
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:46,400
-多谢你空出时间见我 -没问题
-Thank you for your time. -No problem.

1418
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,400
-对不起 -当然
-Sorry. -You bet.

1419
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,070
我的药呢？
SAM: What happened to my pills?

1420
01:23:58,870 --> 01:24:02,070
你喝那么多酒还不够吗？ 你还要吃我的药？
Isn't it bad enough you drink too much? You're taking my pills, too?

1421
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:03,750
我没吃你的药
GINGER: I didn't take your pills.

1422
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,040
我因为胃溃疡，才吃半颗
For my ulcer, I take a half of one of these.

1423
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:09,590
而且是痛到无法忍时才吃
That's when I have extreme pain.

1424
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,420
我本来有三个月份的 你弄到哪里去了？
I had a three-month supply. What did you do with them?

1425
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:15,100
你用不着打他的
GINGER: [Crying] You didn't have to beat him up.

1426
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:16,760
什么？
SAM: What?

1427
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:19,430
我只是想帮他
GINGER: I was just trying to help him.

1428
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:23,230
好像我跟他上床似的
GINGER: Like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1429
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,820
是吗，我哪知道？
Yeah, how do I know?

1430
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:28,990
你不能让我完全不关心别人
GINGER: You can't make me stop caring about people.

1431
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:31,360
-什么？ -我说…
SAM: What? GINGER: I said...

1432
01:24:32,370 --> 01:24:36,290
你不能让我完全不关心别人
you can't make me stop caring about people.

1433
01:24:43,550 --> 01:24:44,830
听着…
SAM: Listen...

1434
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:49,720
我只想让一切比较好
I'm trying to make the best of everything here.

1435
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:51,970
老天啊，你是我老婆
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.

1436
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,560
镇上的人都很看重你
People look up to you in this town.

1437
01:24:55,650 --> 01:24:59,100
你知道吗，艾斯？ 那关我屁事
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit.

1438
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,740
我要离开
I'm getting out of here.

1439
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,330
你冷静一点
SAM: You gotta get a hold of yourself.

1440
01:25:10,540 --> 01:25:12,420
-好 -不为我，也为艾美
GINGER: Okay. SAM: If not for me, at least for Amy.

1441
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:16,170
懂吗，你酒喝得太过份了
SAM: Understand? Your drinking's getting way out of hand.

1442
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,460
我帮你安排去做治疗 这儿有很多好疗养所
I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.

1443
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:23,310
-我不需要 -你需要，那很隐密的
-I don't need one. -Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

1444
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,510
姓名也不会被公布
There's no names in the papers.

1445
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,190
你只在乎名誉
That's all you care about.

1446
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:30,770
你不在乎我
GINGER: You don't care about me.

1447
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:32,860
-我在乎 -不，你不在乎
SAM: Yes, I do. GINGER: No, you don't.

1448
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,190
你怎能这样说？
How could you say that?

1449
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,940
你是个美丽的女人 你在摧残自己
You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself.

1450
01:25:37,450 --> 01:25:40,740
你不需要那些 你现在芒刺在背
You don't need that stuff, that fucking leech living off you.

1451
01:25:40,910 --> 01:25:43,120
我比你还要了解你
I know you better than you know yourself.

1452
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:45,460
你像只老虎，你比我还坚强
You're a tiger. You're stronger than I am.

1453
01:25:45,630 --> 01:25:49,500
只要你下定决心的事 你就做得比任何人都要好
When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.

1454
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:55,590
你一定得去
You're gonna do it.

1455
01:25:56,430 --> 01:25:57,680
天啊
Oh, God.

1456
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:08,940
我试
I'll try.

1457
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:14,150
我会的
GINGER: I will.

1458
01:26:15,290 --> 01:26:17,330
别生我气，好吗？
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1459
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:32,230
不管在计算室外有多少问题…
NICKY: No matter what the problems were outside the count room...

1460
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:34,440
都是值得的
it was all worth it.

1461
01:26:35,030 --> 01:26:37,070
现金滚滚而来…
The cash kept rolling in...

1462
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,200
皮箱也不停的进出
and the suitcases kept coming and going.

1463
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:45,530
让我告诉你 除了钱还是钱
And let me tell you, the fucking bottom line here is cash.

1464
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,710
唯一的问题是过了一阵子后…
The only problem was that after a while...

1465
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,370
老大们发觉皮箱越来越轻
the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.

1466
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:57,090
等一下，你是说…
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1467
01:26:57,180 --> 01:26:59,630
我们抢的钱被人抢？
that the money we're robbing is being robbed?

1468
01:26:59,850 --> 01:27:01,640
有人抢我们？
Somebody's robbing from us?

1469
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:04,930
我们这么大费周章 竟有人在抢我们？
We go through all this fucking trouble and somebody's robbing us?

1470
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,810
如我所说，这就是这行的一部分 就当做是遗漏的
Like I said, it's part of the business. It's considered leakage.

1471
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,270
遗漏，狗屁 我要找到抢我们的人
Leakage, my balls. I want the guy who's robbing us.

1472
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:15,070
就连约翰南斯 主导这骗局的人…
NICKY: Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the scam...

1473
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,240
都知道自己无能为力去阻止
he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.

1474
01:27:17,370 --> 01:27:19,650
你得知道一个肯帮你偷钱的人…
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal...

1475
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,900
就算你把他照顾得好好的…
even if you take care of him real well...

1476
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,280
他还是为自己多偷一点
he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.

1477
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:26,530
很合理不是吗？
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1478
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:30,200
试着让这些固执的老头们了解吧
You go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that.

1479
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,670
如果自己抽完还要被别人抽 还有什么意义？
What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?

1480
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:35,370
这样我们根本就在做白工嘛
It defeats the whole purpose of what we're doing.

1481
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,540
他们是我的手下才帮我们拿钱
They take this money because they're my guys,

1482
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,140
就睁只眼闭只眼吧
so give them some leeway.

1483
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:42,840
但老大们从来就不相信这理论…
NICKY: But the bosses never believed in leeway...

1484
01:27:42,980 --> 01:27:44,520
听听他们做了什么
so listen to what they do.

1485
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,520
他们将艾题派斯康 堪萨斯市的二佬…
They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C...

1486
01:27:47,610 --> 01:27:51,110
调来管理 确定没有人抽头
in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.

1487
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:53,690
-你那时在干嘛？ -我与我马子一起
BOSS: What were you doing? I was with my cumari.

1488
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:56,980
-你跟你马子那时在干嘛？ -我打她一巴掌
BOSS: What were you doing with your cumari? I gave her a schiaffo.

1489
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,660
问题是，派斯康是个麻烦
NICKY: The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.

1490
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:01,860
这家伙连泡咖啡都可搞砸
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1491
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,030
-你都在干嘛？ -我在那儿的时间比在这儿多
BOSS: What you been doing? ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

1492
01:28:05,170 --> 01:28:07,540
当时没人想到 后来会演变为何
NICKY: Little did anybody know where this would lead.

1493
01:28:07,670 --> 01:28:11,090
若有人早知道 去做念珠可能都还好些
If they did, they would've been better off making fucking novenas.

1494
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,540
你得回去跟那家伙讲
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

1495
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,510
-我上次的花费都还没补给我 -什么花费？
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip. -What expenses?

1496
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:20,550
我一直自掏腰包 却什么都拿不回来
I'm laying money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back.

1497
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,140
你得再回去
You gotta go back out there.

1498
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:24,770
从今开始 我得开始做记录了
From now on, I'm gonna start keeping records.

1499
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:28,180
你要记录干嘛，缴税吗？
What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?

1500
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:31,770
我不能一直这样自己出钱 跑来跑去
I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.

1501
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:33,940
我们他妈的到底在那儿干嘛？
What the hell are we doing over here?

1502
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:36,990
我花钱让你去赌城玩
You're going to Las Vegas and having a good time at my expense.

1503
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,990
我靠，我是说…
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

1504
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,110
不论你做了几符念珠…
SAM: No matter how many novenas you could make...

1505
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:43,910
都无法阻止接下来 在赌场发生的事
nothing was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.

1506
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,460
-我不相信你会这样做 -我们有协议
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this. ANNA: We made a deal.

1507
01:28:47,130 --> 01:28:49,700
结果菲立浦葛林，   “老实先生”…
SAM: It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity"...

1508
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:51,540
有个没人知道的搭挡…
had a partner nobody knew about...

1509
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:54,840
当她出现并向坦吉乐要钱时…
and when she showed up and demanded money from Tangiers...

1510
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:57,510
-你为什么这样对我？ -因为你错了
-Why are you doing this to me? -Because you're wrong.

1511
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,970
-我没错 -你有
ANNA: I'm not. PHILIP: You are.

1512
01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:00,310
不，我没错
No, I am not wrong.

1513
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:02,050
葛林试着搪塞她
...Green tried to stonewall her.

1514
01:29:02,230 --> 01:29:04,680
我不会这么轻易的放过你的
ANNA: I will see that you don't get away with this.

1515
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,520
所以她一状告到法庭去
So, she sued him in court.

1516
01:29:06,650 --> 01:29:09,270
本庭现在将开始审理 安娜史考特…
The court will now hear the matter of Anna Scott...

1517
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,900
对坦吉乐集团与其总裁 菲立浦葛林
against Tangiers Corporation and its President, Philip Green.

1518
01:29:12,990 --> 01:29:14,920
-葛林先生将由欧伯伦辩护
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.

1519
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,860
-安娜史考特的律师则是罗根
LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1520
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,410
-欧伯伦先生，可以开始了 -谢谢，大人
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed. OBERON: Thank you.

1521
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:23,460
我觉得判决很公正 而我也对判决非常满意
I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.

1522
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,870
有麻烦了
We got a problem.

1523
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,470
官司结果不理想，葛林得呈交帐簿…
It didn't go too well. Green has to open up the books...

1524
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,970
他得解释钱是怎么来的
has to show how he got the financing.

1525
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,010
这可不好
That's not good.

1526
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:41,810
她官司还打得不错
NICKY: She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit.

1527
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:43,980
但在钞票还未落入她口袋之前…
But before she could start counting her money...

1528
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:47,310
老家的老头子们就已决定庭外和解
the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.

1529
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,640
因此他们派我
So they sent me.

1530
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:07,340
你对安娜史考特的谋杀 有什么想法吗？
REPORTER: Any comment on the murder of Anna Scott?

1531
01:30:07,550 --> 01:30:11,000
-你在说什么？ -她昨晚被人发现中弹身亡
What are you talking about? REPORTER: She was found last night shot in the head.

1532
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,920
只是有关房地产合伙问题吗？
MAN: Was this just a real estate partnership?

1533
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:14,850
她的律师说你们是搭挡
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

1534
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:19,180
我们是在多年前 在一些小房地产交易上合作过
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.

1535
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:20,600
称不上是搭挡
It was never a partnership.

1536
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:24,900
你听过.22口径杀手吗？
MAN: Did you ever hear of the.22 caliber killer?

1537
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:27,690
现在条子不只是盯尼奇…
SAM: Now, Instead of the cops only looking at Nicky...

1538
01:30:27,780 --> 01:30:29,690
他们也开始盯葛林
they started looking at Green, too.

1539
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:32,400
他本是我们的正派门面
And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.

1540
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:35,660
我得接受访问 让大家都知道…
I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew...

1541
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:37,320
赌场没有牵涉到案子
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1542
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:39,700
你多常帮他代班？
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1543
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:45,540
葛林一个月大约来个两、三次…
Green's here about two or three times a month...

1544
01:30:45,630 --> 01:30:48,670
他还有其他房地产交易 和别的事要忙
and he's busy with other real estate deals, and things.

1545
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:51,590
所以葛林不在时 你就是老大罗？
So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?

1546
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:55,270
我很荣幸能为董事会的主席服务
I serve at the pleasure of the Chairman of the Board.

1547
01:30:56,270 --> 01:31:00,100
我的责任是管理赌场的日常运作
My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.

1548
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,190
所以平常日子你就是老大？
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1549
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,810
可以这么说吧…
Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss...

1550
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,910
当葛林先生不在时
when Mr. Green is away.

1551
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:12,730
可以这么说
You could say that.

1552
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:13,570
山姆罗斯坦：   “我是老大！”

1553
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:15,620
你看了没？
PAT: Have you read this?

1554
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:17,670
关于罗斯坦先生
About Mr. Rothstein.

1555
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,660
上面说：   与黑道有关连的 中西部下注者…
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties...

1556
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:26,090
“说他才是价值一亿的坦吉乐赌场 真正的老板”
"says that he is the real boss of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

1557
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:29,350
-你相信吗？ -他真的这么说？
PAT: Do you believe that? OFFICIAL: Did he really say that?

1558
01:31:29,510 --> 01:31:32,010
他当然是这么说的 这儿不都写了吗
Why, of course he really said that. It's right here.

1559
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:36,350
这家伙申请执照了没？
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

1560
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,520
我不知道，得查查
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1561
01:31:38,610 --> 01:31:41,730
去查查看吧，用不着太激动
Without getting your shorts in a knot, would you do that?

1562
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:42,790
查仔细点，
And check closely,

1563
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:45,900
我们也许能 将这死犹太人踢出城了
'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1564
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,530
谢谢
PAT: Thank you.

1565
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:53,360

1570
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:11,600
喂？
Hello?

1571
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,610
我得见见清洁工 在小巴黎如何？
I gotta meet Clean Face right away. What about the Chez Paris?

1572
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:18,310
你得要订位，一定客满了
You gotta make a reservation. It's all booked up.

1573
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:19,400
不用，没关系
NICKY: No, it's okay.

1574
01:32:19,530 --> 01:32:23,520
不可能啦，绝对客满 而且很难进去
It's impossible. It's booked up, and it's very difficult to get in.

1575
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,110
没关系，我走后门 九点见
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance. I'll see you at nine.

1576
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,490
好
All right.

1577
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:33,950

Will Sam Rothstein's friendship with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro...

1582
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,430
是否会阻碍罗斯坦 管理坦吉乐赌场呢？
keep Rothstein from running the Tangiers casino?

1583
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,640
而州政府的赌博游乐法规 是否会因儿时友谊而受到威胁呢？
And can the integrity of state gaming laws be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1584
01:32:56,730 --> 01:32:58,810
你少喝点吧？
SAM: Why don't you take it easy on that stuff?

1585
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:02,490
来，我扶你下楼

1588
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,820
会让罗斯坦失去坦吉乐 老大的位子？
unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers casino boss?

1589
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:12,030
KBBO独家专题报导
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

1590
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:16,080
下楼去，到楼下去
Go down. Just go downstairs.

1591
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,880
你不能让这影响你，艾斯 别管这些了
You can't let this concern you, Ace. Don't worry about that stuff.

1592
01:33:25,010 --> 01:33:26,800
只是政治圈找替死鬼游戏
It's just a political witch hunt.

1593
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:36,440
你要喝什么吗？
SAM: Do you want something to drink?

1594
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:39,110
-查理，你还要吗？ -好啊
-Charlie, you want a refill? -Yeah, that would be great.

I don't want nothing. Hi, Mr. Clark. I've been trying to reach you.

-你比总统还难找 -最近比较忙
-You're tougher to get than the President. -I've been busy.

1597
01:33:45,540 --> 01:33:48,110
是吗？但你至少也该 回我个电话吧
Yeah? At least you could return my phone calls, though.

1598
01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:51,250
听着，尼奇，我们谈过这个
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1599
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,540
我也跟你解释过 你可能会有亏损
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.

1600
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:01,550
我想把钱拿回来
I think I want my money back.

1601
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:05,460
你是要威胁我吗？
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1602
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:09,930
我想你可能误解我了
I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.

1603
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,930
我觉得为公平起见…
I think, in all fairness...

1604
01:34:13,230 --> 01:34:15,810
我应该告诉你我打算怎么做
I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.

1605
01:34:16,990 --> 01:34:21,150
明天一大早我就会散步去银行…
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank...

1606
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:25,330
走进去看看 若还没把我的钱准备好的话…
and walk in and see, and if you don't have my money for me...

1607
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:28,910
我就会在众人面前爆开你的头
I'll crack your fucking head wide open in front of everybody.

1608
01:34:29,670 --> 01:34:32,290
而当我服完刑出狱时…
And just about the time that I'm coming out of jail...

1609
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:36,000
希望你也能从昏迷中苏醒
hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.

1610
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,300
知道吗？ 我会再爆开你的头
And guess what? I'll split your fucking head open again.

1611
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:43,930
因为我是个傻子 我完全不在乎坐牢
'Cause I'm fucking stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.

1612
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:47,260
这就是我的职业 我会做的事
That's my business. That's what I do.

1613
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:49,730
我们知道你的职业
We know what you do.

1614
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:52,140
你把人的钱骗走 然后大摇大摆的走开
You fuck people out of money and get away with it.

1615
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:54,720
-你不能这样对我说话 -你这只爱尔兰肥猪！
You can't talk to me like that. NICKY: You fat Irish prick!

1616
01:34:54,860 --> 01:34:58,030
你害我领不到我的钱 你最好把它弄出来，不然我要你好看
You put my money to sleep. Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.

1617
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,530
山姆别看，这是我们的事
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1618
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:03,410
我明天早上一定到 你试试看啊，肥猪
I'll be there in the morning. You can try me, fatso.

1619
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:09,080
-你觉得他懂了吗？ -你在干嘛？
-You think he got the point? -What are you doing?

1620
01:35:09,210 --> 01:35:13,080
他是个老实的生意人 他会去找联盟调查局的
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes. He's gonna run to the FBI.

1621
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:16,080
这浑蛋躲了我三个礼拜了
That prick's been dodging me for three weeks.

1622
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,450
-你在告诉我该怎么做吗？
-You're trying to tell me what to do?

1623
01:35:18,450 --> 01:35:20,220
-我没有要告诉你该怎么做
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

1624
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,630
你太过份了，你的脑哪里去了？
You're way out of line. Where's your head?

1625
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,850
我的脑？ 你的种又去了哪儿？
Where's my head? Where's your fucking balls?

1626
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:29,510
我有更大的计划 你知道我在说什么
I'm trying to put something big together. You know what I'm talking about.

1627
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,020
如果你现在就这个样 我还怎么指望你啊？
If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you?

1628
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:35,980
很多事都要改变了 你若要跟我一起…
A lot of things gonna change. If you wanna be there with me...

1629
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,030
你就得听我的
you're gonna have to go my way.

1630
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,690
你得体谅我的处境 我得对上千名员工负责
You got to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1631
01:35:41,830 --> 01:35:44,030
我每年都得经手一亿元
SAM: I got $100 million a year going through the place.

1632
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,330
我若拿不到执照就玩完了
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1633
01:35:47,420 --> 01:35:51,170
相信我，我若玩完了 很多人就会跟着完蛋
Believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1634
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:52,960
去他妈的什么烂执照
Forget about your fucking license.

1635
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:56,090
到时候我说的就是法律 你根本不需要什么执照
I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a license.

1636
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,100
我不知道为什么 但越和你说话…
I don't know what it is, but the more I talk to you...

1637
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:04,090
我越觉得你不会挺我
the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.

1638
01:36:04,230 --> 01:36:07,100
-不，我不打算和你一起 -好
-No, I don't want to come along with you. -All right.

1639
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:10,390
我不想涉入你所说的任何事，好吗？
I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?

1640
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,860
我只想好好经营赌场 我只要我的执照
I want to run a square joint. I just want my license.

1641
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:14,980
我只想一切都安静下来
I want everything quiet. That's it!

1642
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:17,320
这样叫安静？ “我是老大”这样叫安静？
Quiet like this? "I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1643
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:19,440
他们扭曲了意思 我根本控制不了
It's taken out of context. I had no control.

1644
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:22,030
罗尼与比利可以告诉你整个经过
Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.

1645
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,910
这在老家很难看
Back home that looks bad.

1646
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,720
难看？每次只要你上电视 就会提到我，
Looks bad? Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.

1647
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,750
这才叫难看
That looks bad.

1648
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:30,880
你到底怎么了？
What the fuck happened to you?

1649
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:33,680
-你怎么了？整个失控？ -我失控？
-What happened to you? You lost control? -I lost control?

1650
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,290
你他妈的像个电影明星似的走来走去
You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore.

1651
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:41,310
穿粉红色的浴袍还拿烟盒？ 是我失控？
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder? I lost control?

1652
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:46,270
我本来不想提的，但你不尊重人 连你老婆都不例外
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat people with disrespect. Even your own wife.

1653
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,400
我老婆？关她什么事？
My wife? What does she have to do with this?

1654
01:36:49,530 --> 01:36:54,350
她为了许多事不高兴 尤其是莱斯特戴蒙德那档
She was upset about a lot of things, especially that Lester Diamond incident.

1655
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,700
你是她哭诉的对象？ 你没告诉她那事你也有份？
You're the shoulder to cry on? Did you tell her about your role in that?

1656
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:01,120
没有，那不是重点
No, that's not the fucking point.

1657
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:04,200
重点是，她不快乐 你也有问题
The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.

1658
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:06,910
我希望你不要干涉 我的私生活
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life.

1659
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,040
若我这样你也会不爽吧
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

1660
01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:12,670
她来找我说话的 我该赶她出去吗？
She came to talk to me. Was I supposed to throw her out?

1661
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:16,130
离她远一点 不关你的事
Stay away from her. It's none of your business.

1662
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:21,130
一周前就是我的事，现在就不是 你需要我时，我就得到
A week ago it was. Now it's not. When you need me, you need me.

1663
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,350
是啊，就像你需要我 帮你做担保一样
Right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.

1664
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:27,310
我得去解决你刚刚对那人 所做的事情
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.

1665
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,150
他会去找联邦调查局的
This guy's gonna run to the FBl.

1666
01:37:29,280 --> 01:37:31,900
你的自尊比你的赌场还大 这就是你的问题
NICKY: Your head's bigger than your casino. That's your problem.

1667
01:37:32,030 --> 01:37:34,830
我知道他想做什么，但我不想参与
SAM: I knew what he wanted and I didn't want any part of it.

1668
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:36,410
尼奇想自个儿当老大
He wanted to take over.

1669
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:41,410
他想干掉盖吉 抽头，还有一切
He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.

1670
01:37:41,540 --> 01:37:45,080
他不再每件小事都要老家批准
He also stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.

1671
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:53,790
一位赌场大亨与他老婆被杀了 调查员侦问了尼奇
A casino boss and his wife were killed. The bulls questioned Nicky.

1672
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:58,010
一位西洛可的庄家 他们也询问尼奇
A dealer from the Scirocco. They questioned Nicky.

1673
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,800
几个线民死在自己的后车箱里
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.

1674
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:02,140
他们也追问尼奇
They questioned Nicky.

1675
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,390
一个律师
A lawyer.

1676
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,930
他们问尼奇
They questioned Nicky.

1677
01:38:08,110 --> 01:38:11,150
当一些拖欠高利贷的人 莫名的开始消失…
When some guys who didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...

1678
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,120
尼奇的名字布满每家报纸
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.

1679
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:18,080
尼奇因为一堆谋杀案调查被侦讯 但他们每次都放他走
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.

1680
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,490
从来没有目击者
There were never any witnesses.

1681
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:24,040
条子把所有的不顺 都归昝于我
NICKY: The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.

1682
01:38:24,170 --> 01:38:25,880
小心点 你会好看的
Watch yourself. You're gonna get runned over.

1683
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:29,800
若有个家伙踩到香蕉皮跌倒 可能都要带我回局里
NICKY: If a guy tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1684
01:38:30,590 --> 01:38:32,050
客气点
Be nice.

1685
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:36,300
老大们也没好到哪儿去 他们抱怨事情运作不顺
NICKY: The bosses were no better. They complained because things don't run smooth.

1686
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:39,640
不过在我这行 真抱歉，事情本来就不会顺
In my line of work, things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1687
01:38:39,770 --> 01:38:42,060
我每天对付的可是些三教九流之徒
I'm dealing with degenerate animals out here.

1688
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:44,190
老大们在乎个屁啊？
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?

1689
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,480
他们只会坐着喝酒
They're sitting on their asses drinking anisette.

1690
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:48,820
而这期间我得做牛做马
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

1691
01:38:48,950 --> 01:38:51,650
那些王八老大们 真以为天下的午餐都是免费的
Fucking bosses think it's a fucking free lunch out here.

1692
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:56,620
法兰克，他们在沙漠里 找到一个家伙的头
Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.

1693
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,450
你知道吗？
You know about that?

1694
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,080
听说了
I heard.

1695
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:05,630
大家都在讲，报纸里也有登
Everybody's talking about it and making a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1696
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,000
你要怎么办？
What are you gonna do?

1697
01:39:07,470 --> 01:39:09,010
这可不好
That's no good.

1698
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:13,670
叫他做事要小心点
Tell him to take care of things a little better.

1699
01:39:14,890 --> 01:39:16,010
我会的，利蒙
I'll tell him, Remo.

1700
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,890
王八老大们抽着雪茄
NICKY: Fucking bosses smoking their Di Nobilis...

1701
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:22,180
吃着他们的美食…
and eating trip' and fucking soffrit', fried pigs' guts...

1702
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:25,690
而我若想私下找人谈话 我还得坐在公车站
while if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.

1703
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:30,150
-他们在乎个屁？只要我拿钱回去 -他们在抱怨了
-What do they care? Long as I send money. -They're complaining.

1704
01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,320
让他们抱怨，是我在这儿 活都是我在做
Let them complain. I'm the one who's here. I do all the work.

1705
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,570
-有人不喜欢，就去他的 -你决定罗
NICKY: Somebody don't like it, fuck them. FRANK: It's up to you.

1706
01:39:38,630 --> 01:39:40,450
他们他妈的想打仗？ 我准备好了
NICKY: They want a fucking war? I'm ready.

1707
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:45,590
我只要干掉那五个 其他的自然会水到渠成
If I take care of five of those guys, the rest will fall into place.

1708
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,300
被我抓到了吧，这群王八羔子
NICKY: Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.

1709
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:51,800
我看到你们了，浑蛋
I see you, you motherfuckers.

1710
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:55,550
问题是，尼奇不只是 让自己更受注目，还连累到我
SAM: Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself, but on me, too.

1711
01:39:55,690 --> 01:40:00,230
联邦调查局盯着他的每一步 但他不在乎
The FBI watched every move he made, but he just didn't care.

1712
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:03,230
想要盯我，我就盯回去
NICKY: If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch them back.

1713
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:06,320
或许花了很多钱 但谁在乎？
I spent a few bucks. Top dollar. Who gives a shit?

1714
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:10,940
我买了最先进的反窃听装置 向卖给中央调查局的那家买的
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment from the same places that sell to the CIA.

1715
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:15,990
我有所有的警察特殊频道对讲机 FBI的解干扰器、夜光照相机…
I had all the special police frequency radios, FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....

1716
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,750
这些衰角从未抓到我任何把柄
So, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.

1717
01:40:22,380 --> 01:40:25,630
我工作都快丢了 但他却玩得不亦乐乎
SAM: I got my job on the line, he's having the time of his life.

1718
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,050
全州的警察都在盯他 他却在打高尔夫球
He has every cop in the state watching him, and he's out playing golf.

1719
01:40:29,850 --> 01:40:32,340
对我来说时期最坏不过
And at the worst possible time for me.

1720
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:37,220
我的执照听证会要到了 我不想有一点点失败的机率
I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1721
01:40:38,980 --> 01:40:41,190
若不能在赌城工作 那我要去哪儿？
If I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?

1722
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,900
你一直都很合作 从文件到帐簿
You've been very open with us with the books and papers.

1723
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:47,570
这对委员会是很重要的
That'll mean a lot when you go before the commission.

1724
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:51,530
-我只希望能有个公正的听证会 -你的诚实会为你赢的
-All I ask is a fair hearing. -This honesty will guarantee it.

1725
01:40:52,910 --> 01:40:54,370
接下来…
We'll move on to....

1726
01:40:56,040 --> 01:40:59,740
我想听听关于堪萨斯市
SAM: I want to hear about Kansas City.

1727
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:02,710
这他妈的是什么？
What the fuck is this?

1728
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,840
这家伙要停在哪里，球场上吗？
Where's this fucking guy gonna land, in the fairway?

1729
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:30,320
他们是探员，法兰克 来看看
They're fucking agents, Frankie. Look at this.

1730
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:35,000
他们盯尼奇打高尔夫盯到…
SAM: The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long...

1731
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:36,370
飞机没油
they ran out of gas.

1732
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:40,670
还真是我需要的 就在委员会面前
Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.

1733
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:47,710
赌一百看谁先打到飞机
$100, whoever hits the plane.

1734
01:41:50,850 --> 01:41:55,230
祸不单行，随后就看到派斯康 堪萨斯市的老二
SAM: If things weren't bad enough... in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.

1735
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,810
在堪萨斯市收皮箱的那家超市 就是他开的
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases.

1736
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:02,150
又在为皮箱的事吵了 你知道这代表什么吗？
Fighting over those suitcases again. You know what that means?

1737
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,820
我又得去拉斯维加斯了 又要花我好几千
I gotta take another trip to Vegas. It's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1738
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:07,450
他和他姐夫一起开店…
SAM: He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1739
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:11,910
但他大多都在跟他姐夫与岳母 抱怨他去赌城的事
but he mostly complained about his trips to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.

1740
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:15,160
你得表明态度 要不然他们当你是病猫
You gotta lay down the law, or they'll make a fool out of you.

1741
01:42:15,590 --> 01:42:19,120
我全记下来了，他妈的每一分一毛
I write it all down. Every fucking nickel goes down.

1742
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:22,920
-你是怎么了？ -全都在这儿
-What's the matter with you? -Everything's here.

1743
01:42:23,010 --> 01:42:25,000
-你何时开始这样讲话？ -抱歉
-Since when do you talk like that? -I'm sorry.

1744
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:29,640
南斯要是找我麻烦 我就将他的眼挖出来
Nance gives me trouble, I'll take the eyes out of his freaking head.

1745
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:32,050
-又来了 -我没骂粗话
-Again. -I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."

1746
01:42:32,190 --> 01:42:33,350
-够了 -抱歉
-That's enough. -I'm sorry.

1747
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,520
接下来发生的事 简直是出乎意料
SAM: What happens next, you can't believe it.

1748
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:38,560
谁会想到联邦调查局 会在里面装窃听器…
Who'd believe the FBI had a wire in the place...

1749
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,360
为了调查很久以前的一桩命案…
looking for information about some old homicide...

1750
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:44,780
为了一个不知在何时 也不知为何事被干掉的人
about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what?

1751
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:47,870
你怎么阻止拿皮箱的人 拿走他想要的？
What prevents him with the suitcases from taking what he wants?

1752
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,250
南斯从坦吉乐拿了两口箱子回来
Nance brings back two suitcases from the Tangiers.

1753
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,910
若其实有三箱或四箱呢？
What about three or four?

1754
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:54,910
我们没有人在计算室里看着 那是法律
We've got nobody in the room to watch. That's the law.

1755
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:58,660
我们甚至连计算室都进不去
We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.

1756
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:03,340
他有他的人在里面 他们搞不好根本是一伙的
He's got his people in there. They could all be in on it together.

1757
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:07,260
若我知道是葛林干的 我会埋了那王八蛋
I'll find out. If it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard.

1758
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:09,930
我从就不相信他 我后脑都有眼睛
I never trusted him. I got eyes behind my head.

1759
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,770
他们信任那浑蛋，我可不
They trust that scumbag. I don't.

1760
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:14,140
我该给他们一人一铲
I'll hit the two of them in the head with a shovel.

1761
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,310
冷静点
MA: Take it easy.

1762
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:18,190
妈，抱歉 但他们一直跟我玩阴的
Ma, I'm sorry. They're beating me left and right.

1763
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:20,650
-抱歉，我很生气 -我知道，可是够了
ARTIE: I'm sorry. I'm upset. I know, but that's enough.

1764
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:23,910
你也知道他们在对我做什么 我受不了了
You know what they're doing to me. I can't take this no more.

1765
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:27,650
-冷静，别心脏病发 -我知道，我太气了
MA: Take it easy. You'll get a heart attack. ARTIE: I know. I'm too upset.

1766
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:31,070
该死的是，他们听得一清二楚…
SAM: The damn thing is, they hear all this stuff...

1767
01:43:31,210 --> 01:43:34,460
关于拉斯维加斯，赌场还有皮箱…
about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases...

1768
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:36,080
玩完了
and that's it.

1769
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,470
全都是从我口袋里掏 我得付钱
ARTIE: Everything's coming out of my pocket. I gotta pay.

1770
01:43:45,890 --> 01:43:47,470
你相信有这么巧吗？
SAM: Would you believe this could happen?

1771
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,800
华府

1772
01:43:48,980 --> 01:43:50,850
我是来赚钱的，不是亏钱
ARTIE: I'm in this to make money, not lose it.

1773
01:43:50,980 --> 01:43:54,680
全国每个联邦调查局探员 都张大了耳朵
SAM: Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now.

1774
01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:58,100
要将事情办好就得靠自己
ARTIE: If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.

1775
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:02,700
派司康这家伙 几乎搞砸了所有人的生活
SAM: Piscano, this guy, basically sunk the whole world.

1776
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:06,150
有些好的就有些坏的
MA: There are some that are good and some that are bad.

1777
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:07,740
1980年

1778
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,700
主席先生 委员会的同仁…
COUNSELOR: Members of the Commission...

1779
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,710
今天罗斯坦先生很荣幸能在这儿
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

1780
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,210
当那天终于来时 我已准备好了
SAM: When the day finally came, I was ready.

1781
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:18,080
我自信满满的认为 我只需要呈上我的案件
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.

1782
01:44:18,220 --> 01:44:22,720
我们拥有文件，其中一份是由 一位退休的联邦探员写的…
COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBl agents...

1783
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:26,090
上头清楚的记载罗斯坦先生 并未触犯任何法律
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.

1784
01:44:26,230 --> 01:44:29,680
-律师，在你继续前… -我要将这呈为…
-Counselor, before you continue... -I want to have this marked....

1785
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,980
本委员会针对是否应 驳回罗斯坦的申请书在此动议
...this Commission acts on a motion denying the Rothstein application.

1786
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:36,560
-驳回？ -有人赞成驳回吗？
COUNSELOR: Denying? SENATOR: Do I hear a motion seconded?

1787
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,860
主席先生，我赞成
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

1788
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:40,620
还有赞同票吗？
Do I have a vote on the motion?

1789
01:44:40,740 --> 01:44:41,780
同意！
-Aye! -Aye!

1790
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:45,160
同意票获胜，听证会结束
The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.

1791
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:48,460
-开什么玩笑 -什么叫结束？
-You have to be kidding. -Adjourned? What do you mean?

1792
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:51,600
议员，你答应我一场听证会的
Senator, you promised me a hearing.

1793
01:44:51,610 --> 01:44:53,800
你连联邦调查局的报告都没看
You didn't even look at the FBl reports.

1794
01:44:54,050 --> 01:44:56,950
你来坦吉乐作客时
When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel,

1795
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,930
不是答应我会有公平的听证会？
didn't you promise me a fair hearing?

1796
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:00,720
-我从未是你的客人
SENATOR: I was never your guest.

1797
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,840
-不是我的客人？我没招待过你？
SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?

1798
01:45:02,980 --> 01:45:05,260
难道我一个月 没有最少招待你三次？
I don't comp you at least three times a month?

1799
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,680
我现在回答这个问题
I'd like to answer that at this time.

1800
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:11,100
罗斯坦先生的反应很常见 他在撒谎
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying.

1801
01:45:11,190 --> 01:45:15,110
我唯一一次去过坦吉乐 就是巴尼葛林斯坦那次晚宴
The only time I was at the Tangiers was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.

1802
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:17,910
-我当时在场吗？ -你四处周旋着
Was I at the dinner? SENATOR: You were wandering around.

1803
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:21,070
-我在场吗？ -你四处周旋
SAM: Was I at that dinner? SENATOR: You were wandering.

1804
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:24,160
-你在室内 -我在室内？
SENATOR: You were in the building. SAM: I was in the building?

1805
01:45:24,290 --> 01:45:26,010
你很清楚我在那儿
You know damn well I was there.

1806
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:28,500
你向我保证会有公正的听证会
You swore I would have a fair hearing.

1807
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:31,160
没有吗？
Did you not?

1808
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:36,130
至少承认说我那天在场 这总可以了吧
Tell me I was at least at the dinner. Allow me that much.

1809
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:39,340
-至少也得说我在场吧！ -是，你在
SAM: Give me that much at least! SENATOR: Yes, you were.

1810
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:42,140
多谢你没说我是骗子 你这个狗东西
Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.

1811
01:45:44,400 --> 01:45:47,770
一场例行的听证会 在昨晚成了一场闹剧…
A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday...

1812
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:51,600
当抢眼的坦吉乐高层 山姆“艾斯”罗斯坦…
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1813
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,570
指控赌博游乐委员会高官贪污
accused top gaming officials of corruption.

1814
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:57,530
你在我的旅馆接受招待 并答应我会有公平的听证会
...promised me a fair hearing when you were comped at my hotel?

1815
01:45:57,660 --> 01:46:00,860
你还要求将你的帐单挂公帐
And you asked for copies of your bill to put on your expense account.

1816
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,250
当赌博游乐执照被驳回时大吼大叫…
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...

1817
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,580
-狗屁！ -罗斯坦与好几名…
Bullshit! ...Rothstein followed several...

1818
01:46:06,710 --> 01:46:10,160
错愕的委员到走道 并持续着他的指控…
stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue...

1819
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:12,750
直到他的律师与朋友劝他离开
until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.

1820
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:17,050
你有过去，我也有过去 我的不见得比你的糟糕
You have a past. I have a past. My past is no worse than yours.

1821
01:46:17,140 --> 01:46:19,890
你们还自以为有权去判决别人！
You guys think you have the right to pass judgment!

1822
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:23,100
被怀疑长期无照管理坦吉乐…
NEWSREADER: Long suspected of running Tangiers without a license...

1823
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:27,690
昨天的听证会本是要决议 像罗斯坦如此背景的人…
yesterday's hearing was to determine if someone with Rothstein's history...

1824
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:30,650
是否有资格正式在赌博游乐界 担任如此高的职位
was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.

1825
01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,940
罗斯坦玩完了 王八伪君子！
REMO: Fucking hypocrites!

1826
01:46:33,530 --> 01:46:36,740
-他现在怎么办？ -我不知道
-What the hell's he gonna do now? -I don't know.

1827
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:38,490
他在干嘛？
What's he doing?

1828
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:41,710
他也知道他大吼大叫的那群人 都是我们的朋友
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.

1829
01:46:41,790 --> 01:46:44,000
他是怎么了，搞得一团糟？
What's the matter with him, making all this mess?

1830
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:46,500
他或许可以用另一个头衔管事
Maybe he could run things with another job title.

1831
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:49,090
这不是最好的 但我们又能如何呢？
Won't be the best, but what are we gonna do?

1832
01:46:49,340 --> 01:46:51,240
他不论管什么，都得安静点
REMO: However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.

1833
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,590
让他躲到楼上办公室去
Let him hide upstairs in the office.

1834
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,760
说他是工友，我不在乎
Say he's a janitor. I don't give a shit.

1835
01:46:55,970 --> 01:47:00,880
但拜托，不管他做什么 都得低调点
But please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.

1836
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:11,280
各位先生与女士…
ANNOUNCER: [On TV] Ladies and gentlemen...

1837

与山姆罗斯坦舞群！
and the Sam Rothstein dancers!

1844
01:47:35,180 --> 01:47:39,930
罗斯坦先生是位职业赌徒 也是全美最棒的美式足球下注者
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler and the best U.S. football handicapper.

1845
01:47:40,230 --> 01:47:44,770
一位能带领你进入 真正的拉斯维加斯的人
A man who will take you inside the real Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.

1846
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:49,610
现在让我们欢迎 坦吉乐赌场新的娱乐董事…
Now, the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...

1847
01:47:49,910 --> 01:47:51,610
山姆罗斯坦先生
Mr. Sam Rothstein.

1848
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,250
欢迎来到山姆罗斯坦秀 很高兴你们能参与
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein show. We're happy to have you here this evening.

1849
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:08,000
我左边的这位小姐是特茹蒂…
The young lady to my left is Trudy...

1850
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:11,630
她是我们巴黎秀新的首席舞者
who is a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.

1851
01:48:11,850 --> 01:48:14,140
我们今晚的第一位来宝…
Our first guest this evening...

1852
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:16,890
法兰克艾华伦
is Frankie Avalon.

1853
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:26,190
-看好他 -我有个大家庭
PAT: Keep an eye on him. FRANKIE: I've got a large family.

1854
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:30,660
-你有几个孩子？ -我很自豪的说，八个
SAM: How many kids do you have? I'm very proud to say, eight children.

1855
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,660
-太了不起了 -没什么，是我的荣幸
-That's amazing. -There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

1856
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:40,490
别这样
PHILIP: Ace, don't do it.

1857
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:46,670
天啊
Jesus.

1858
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:48,920
他在耍杂技！
He's juggling!

1859
01:48:49,180 --> 01:48:52,710
我们别对县辅导 派特委布太认真
SAM: Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.

1860
01:48:53,180 --> 01:48:56,770
我最近本想邀他在节目上辩论的 但是他拒绝了
I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.

1861
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:58,930
你在担心什么呢，派特？
What are you worried about, Pat?

1862
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:01,150
你不需要事先给我问题
You don't have to send me any questions.

1863
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:03,980
你什么都可以问我
You can ask me anything you want.

1864
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,360
他在电视上干嘛？
ANDY: What the hell is he doing on television?

1865
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:07,650
他整晚都在上面
He's on all night,

1866
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:11,910
喊着要将他的案子告上最高法院
screaming about taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

1867
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:15,700
他真是疯了 他想将这带到华府去？
He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?

1868
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,120
他简直是疯了
He's out of his fucking mind.

1869
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:21,990
世上有这样的伪君子真是可叹 他们爱做什么就做什么
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy. Some people do what they want.

1870
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,840
其他人却得承担后果 这就是人生
Other people have to pay through the nose. Such is life.

1871
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:30,170
安迪，去找他 告诉他辞职的时候到了
Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.

1872
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:39,020
第一点，他们的所做所为 完全的违反了宪法
SAM: First, what they did was totally unconstitutional.

1873
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:42,810
我们已在高等法院的等候单上了
SAM: We're on the list to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.

1874
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,150
这些家伙才不在乎高等法院
These guys don't care about the Supreme Court.

1875
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,710
他们要一切平息，要你别再搞了
They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away.

1876
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:48,610
别搞了？安迪，
Walk away? Andy,

1877
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:53,110
你不是说真的 你难道看不到这严重性吗？
you can't be serious. Don't you see what's at stake?

1878
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:56,200
老头说你的朋友或许该罢手了
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.

1879
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:59,170
当老头说“或许”时 就像是教皇发谕令一样
When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.

1880
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,050
你不但该罢手，还该跑路
Not only should you quit, you should run.

1881
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:06,590
他们每次在报上提到我的名字 就一定扯到尼奇
Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.

1882
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:08,470
这他妈的有什么帮助？
How the fuck does that help?

1883
01:50:09,350 --> 01:50:11,180
他带来的注目简直是谋杀
The heat he brought down is murder.

1884
01:50:11,640 --> 01:50:13,550
警察局本来很合作
The police department was cooperative.

1885
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:16,390
他将他们激怒到 现在大家都动不了
They're pissed off. Nobody can make a move anymore.

1886
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,730
你能怎样呢？
What do you do about that?

1887
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,860
-你想说什么？ -我不知道，他根本不听我的
-What are you proposing? -I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1888
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:23,860
或许他才该消失一阵子 这样会很糟吗？
Maybe he should get lost for a while. Would that be so bad?

1889
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:26,490
-他们不会调走尼奇的 -若他离开一阵…
-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere. -If he took a break...

1890
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:28,780
给大家移动布局的机会
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1891
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:32,820
别再搞布局的事 赶紧离开吧
I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.

1892
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:37,990
我不能
I can't do that.

1893
01:50:39,210 --> 01:50:43,460
当然，安迪一到家后 尼奇就听说我们的谈话
SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

1894
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:46,510
第二天一大早，我就接到电话
Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.

1895
01:50:47,470 --> 01:50:49,800
我得去买点东西，你要不要去？
I've got to do some shopping. Want to go?

1896
01:50:49,890 --> 01:50:52,430
连接尼奇的电话都不是件易事
SAM: Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.

1897
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,900
暗号都没有用了 我们得想新方法
Even the codes didn't work. So we figured out another act.

1898
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,540
若是电话被窃听
If a phone's tapped,

1899
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:59,940
他们只能听关于犯罪的谈话
the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

1900
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:03,570
例行通话时 他们必须在几分钟后挂断
On routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.

1901
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:05,610
我手肘好像扭到了
GINGER: I got a sprained fucking elbow.

1902
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:08,110
三点见
Meet me at 3:00.

1903
01:51:08,250 --> 01:51:10,780
-在凯撒宫吗？ -这条路下去再一百码处
-At Caesar's? -100 yards further down the road.

1904
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:13,660
-为什么？ -别问了，到那儿就是了
-Why? -Don't ask questions. Just be there.

1905
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:18,830
苏西克理姆有件一模一样的衣服
Suzy Cream Cheese has the same outfit.

1906
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:21,970
我看到个东西
GINGER: I saw something.

1907
01:51:22,090 --> 01:51:24,380
这东西好可爱
Something very cute.

1908
01:51:25,260 --> 01:51:28,880
他出门了，棕组
AGENT: Okay, he's out. It's the ant. Brown unit.

1909
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:32,060
他带着个替身，应该是法兰克
He's with the bogey. I think it's Frankie.

1910
01:51:32,190 --> 01:51:34,060
尼奇比我早出门…
SAM: Nicky started out before me...

1911
01:51:34,190 --> 01:51:37,030
因为他要出门越来越难了
because it wasn't that easy for him to get around anymore.

1912
01:51:38,650 --> 01:51:41,360
尼奇到那儿都最起码得…
Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars...

1913
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:44,280
换六次车才甩得掉跟踪他的人
at least six times before he could shake all his tails.

1914
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:47,700
因为有飞机 所以他得用地下停车场
Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.

1915
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:21,830
在沙漠中央会面总让我紧张
SAM: Meeting in the desert always made me nervous.

1916
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:23,400
那是个可怕的地方
It's a scary place.

1917
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:26,790
我当然也知道沙漠里的洞
I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.

1918
01:52:26,870 --> 01:52:29,360
我张望的每一处都可能是个洞
And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.

1919
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,450
通常我与尼奇会面 能活着回来…
Normally, my prospects of coming back alive...

1920
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:37,040
机率是百分之九十九
from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.

1921
01:52:39,140 --> 01:52:42,880
但这次，当我听他说 离道路几百码外…
But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...

1922
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:45,680
我想应该还有一半的机率吧
I gave myself 50-50.

1923
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:11,120
你他妈的跟别人 在背后捅我是什么意思？
Where the fuck you get off talking to people behind my back?

1924
01:53:11,210 --> 01:53:13,750
-跟什么人？ -你以为我不会发现吗？
-What people? -Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1925
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,170
我根本不知道你在说什么
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1926
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:21,210
你说我害你被盯？ 我得因为你被人家念？
You said I'm bringing heat on you? I gotta listen to people because of you?

1927
01:53:21,390 --> 01:53:24,430
你想搞走我？ 你最好准备好自己的军队？
You're ordering me out? You better get your own fucking army!

1928
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:26,300
我没有要搞走任何人
I didn't order you or anybody.

1929
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,100
我跟安迪说你被盯上了 这是个问题
I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.

1930
01:53:29,230 --> 01:53:31,310
你想要我离开我自己的地盘？
You want me to get out of my own fucking town?

1931
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,690
是啊，我说等风头过了 我才能好好经营赌场
Yeah, let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.

1932
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:37,860
赌场出了什么事我得负责，不是你
Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.

1933
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:42,940
你知道你之所以能管那狗屁赌场 都是因为我！
You know that you only have your fucking casino because I made that possible!

1934
01:53:43,500 --> 01:53:44,960
在这儿我才算数
I'm what counts out here.

1935
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:49,130
不是你他妈的什么俱乐部 也不是你那狗屁电视秀
Not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.

1936
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:51,740
你他妈的在电视上干嘛？
And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?

1937
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:55,310
我每天都得接老家的电话 他们都觉得你疯了！
I get calls from back home every day. They think you went batshit!

1938
01:53:55,450 --> 01:53:57,780
我上电视是因为 我必须待在赌场
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.

1939
01:53:57,880 --> 01:53:59,640
你应该知道的
You understand and you know that....

1940
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,220
你不上电视也可以拿那餐饮的头衔！
You could've had the food-and-beverage job without going on TV!

1941
01:54:03,310 --> 01:54:05,850
-是你想上电视吧 -对，我想上电视
-You wanted to go on TV. -Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.

1942
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:08,430
这样我才有擂台，我才可以反击 我要有知名度
That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me

1943
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:12,220
若我有知名度他们就不能 随随便便打发我
They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's why

1944
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,190
你将自己变成个笑话
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

1945
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,030
要不是你，我也不会落到这步田地
I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.

1946
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:18,700
你让我被盯上
You brought down so much heat on me.

1947
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:21,320
我每次遇见个人 他们都只想知道我认不认识你
Every time I meet somebody, they ask me if I know you.

1948
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:24,090
所以你现在要将你执照的那件事 怪到我的头上
Sure, now you wanna blame your fucking license on me.

1949
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:26,200
当你请示我你可不可以来这儿时…我是怎么说的？
When you asked me if you could come out here...what did I tell you?

1950
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:26,810
我意思你问我
I mean you asked me.

1951
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:30,880
我就知道 不管我说什么你都会来，记得吗？
I knew you'd come out no matter what I said. Do you remember?

1952
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,720
等一下，倒退一下
Back up a fucking minute here. One minute.

1953
01:54:33,970 --> 01:54:34,770
我请示你？
I asked you?

1954
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:38,300
我他妈的什么时候 请示过你我可不可以来这儿？
When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?

1955
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:42,770
搞清楚点，死犹太人！
NICKY: Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker!

1956
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:46,930
你是因我才在这儿！ 只因为这样！
You only exist out here because of me! That's the only reason!

1957
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:49,520
要没有我，你自己…
Without me, you personally....

1958
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:54,490
在这儿随便哪个还在混的 都可能宰了你！
Every fucking wise guy still around will take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!

1959
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:57,240
到时你怎么办？ 我警告你了
Then where you gonna go? You're fucking warned.

1960
01:54:57,330 --> 01:55:01,080
别想再踩在我头上 你这个王八蛋！
Don't go over my fucking head again, you motherfucker, you!

1961
01:55:30,700 --> 01:55:31,940
有客人
Well, we got company.

1962
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:46,960
看到了吗？
Did you see that?

1963
01:55:47,340 --> 01:55:48,210
蠢犹太人，
Dumb Jew motherfucker.

1964
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:51,000
我们一起长大的 他竟装作不认识我
Grew up together, and he acts like he doesn't know me.

1965
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:53,920
我知道我们应该避免碰面
I know we're supposed to avoid each other,

1966
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:56,220
不过应该有其他办法吧
but there's ways to do things.

1967
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:57,890
去他的
Fuck him.

1968
01:55:58,020 --> 01:55:59,730
敬林肯总统
To Abraham Lincoln.

1969
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:02,590
算了，别让这烦你
Forget about it. Don't let it bother you.

1970
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:05,940
我看来很烦躁吗？ 我为什么要在乎？
Does it look like it's bothering me? Why do I give a fuck?

1971
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,850
奥斯卡也是的 我给了他那么多钱，浑蛋
Oscar, too. All the money I gave him, that prick.

1972
01:56:09,990 --> 01:56:12,560
他连看都不看这边 他到底是什么毛病？
He didn't even look over. What's his fucking problem?

1973
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:15,000
-死犹太人都是一伙的，不是吗？
-Fucking Jews stick together, don't they?

1974
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:17,240
-他们好像玩得很快乐
-yeah. but they're having a good time.

1975
01:56:18,250 --> 01:56:19,580
我们也是啊
So are we.

1976
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,330
喂？
Yeah?

1977
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:28,590
-山姆，有麻烦 -怎么了？
-Sam, we got a problem. -What is it?

1978
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:32,500
那矮子，没人跟他说 他被禁止进入赌场
BILLY: The little guy. Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.

1979
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,670
我们只要都假装不认识他
We turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was.

1980
01:56:36,020 --> 01:56:39,300
他现在在21点桌大剌剌的豪赌
He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.

1981
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:43,640
他从他那份抽头里拿钱 已经输了一万了
He took money out of his own kick. His nose is open for about $10,000.

1982
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,810
现在他很生气
Now he's really pissed.

1983
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:50,810
-他要五万的筹码 -给他一万就好了
-He wants a $50,000 marker. -Just give him $10,000.

1984
01:56:50,950 --> 01:56:52,490
就这样，我马上来
That's it. I'll be right down.

1985
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:55,070
就如你所要求 他会去拿一万
He's gonna come up with $10,000 just the way you want.

1986
01:56:55,160 --> 01:56:57,700
不，我他妈的说五万！
No, I said fucking $50,000!

1987
01:56:57,830 --> 01:57:00,410
给我去拿 我不在乎你用什么方法
Go get it. I don't give a fuck where you get it.

1988
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:03,000
王八蛋 只会拿钱却不还来
Fuckers. They take it but don't wanna give it back.

1989
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:08,960
你还笑得出来？
How the fuck can you grin?

1990
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:14,640
你知道我输多少了吗？ 你在乎吗？
You know how much I'm stuck? Do you give a fuck?

1991
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:22,230
给自己点掌声吧 顺便加一巴掌
Give yourself a hand, right across your fucking mouth.

1992
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:24,520
看看现在上来的这个怪胎
Look at this beaut they put in now.

1993
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:26,650
雪伯提派你来抢我的吗？
NICKY: Sherbert send you in here to rob me now?

1994
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:30,870
你今晚帕撕芫昧税桑坑很多喔？
Been fucking knocking everybody's dick in all night? Been beating the customers?

1995
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:33,820
再来一张
Jag-off. Hit me.

1996
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:40,200
将这张牌从你后面塞进去
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass.

1997
01:57:40,330 --> 01:57:41,790
再来一张
Hit me again.

1998
01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:50,460
这张捅你姐姐后面去，再来一张
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass. Hit me again.

1999
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:52,310
一直看他干嘛，
Keep looking at him. you fucking dammy

2000
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:55,640
你要还有良心 你就宁可去当小偷
If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.

2001
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:59,090
再给我一张 你他妈的一直看他干嘛？
Hit me again! What the fuck you keep looking at him for?

2002
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:03,010
你这，你看看 连二十张公，再来一张
You fucking.... Look at this, 20 points in a row. Hit me again.

2003
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,110
你给钱应该跟拿钱一样快吧
NICKY: You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.

2004
01:58:15,160 --> 01:58:19,030
-你得走了 -叫那王八蛋付筹码
-You gotta get out of here. -Tell this motherfucker to pay that marker.

2005
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:22,660
你没在听，我是来帮你的 你会将我们俩都毁了
You're not listening. I'm here to help you. You're gonna bury us both.

2006
01:58:23,040 --> 01:58:27,370
-把钱给我 -我只批准一万，就这样
-Just give me the money. -I'm gonna okay you $10,000, that's it.

2007
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:30,160
然后你得在条子找到你之前给我走
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.

2008
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:32,010
就一万
$10,000 and that's it.

2009
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:40,380
你在看什么？ 你这秃头的死犹太人
What are you staring at, you bald-headed Jew prick?

2010
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:48,560
-快，我们快走 -告我啊，死犹太人！
-Come on. Let's get out of here. -Sue me, you Jew fuck!

2011
01:58:48,990 --> 01:58:52,520
走？ 我有筹码要来耶，发牌
NICKY: Get out of here? I got a marker coming. Deal.

2012
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,910
我知道，但现在情况不同了 你要求的是离婚
I know, but everything's changed now. You're talking about a divorce.

2013
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:59,280
你要求你与孩子的赡养费 现在又要孩子的监护权
You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.

2014
01:58:59,370 --> 01:59:01,450
我只要任何一个离婚女人想要的
I just want what any divorced woman would get.

2015
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:03,780
她一天不过清醒两个小时
She's only sober about two hours a day.

2016
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:06,200
通常是早上十一点到下午一点
It's usually from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

2017
01:59:06,340 --> 01:59:08,610
我要是给她钱与珠宝
If I gave her her money and her jewels,

2018
01:59:08,610 --> 01:59:10,880
她一年内就会浪费光了
she's gonna piss it all away in a year.

2019
01:59:11,300 --> 01:59:15,000
到时你怎么办？ 还不是又回来找我…
Where would you be then? Coming right back to me...

2020
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:17,300
或找什么其他的理由回来…
or finding some other excuse to come....

2021
01:59:18,180 --> 01:59:20,890
我们有协议，记得吗？
We had a deal. Remember that?

2022
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:22,760
他说过
He said

2023
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:26,140
若我们之间走不下去 我可以拿我的东西走
if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things and leave.

2024
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,510
看着我
Look in my eyes.

2025
01:59:33,240 --> 01:59:34,400
你知道我
SAM: You know me.

2026
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:38,160
你看到任何迹象 让你觉得…
Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let...

2027
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,820
以你现在的状况 我会将我的孩子交给你？
someone in your condition take my child away from me?

2028
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,110
有吗？
Do you?

2029
01:59:47,460 --> 01:59:48,920
你知道这不可能
You know that won't happen.

2030
01:59:54,010 --> 01:59:55,800
过了这么久…
SAM: And after all this time...

2031
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:59,140
不管我多么努力，多么想…
and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...

2032
01:59:59,350 --> 02:00:01,060
我始终触碰不到她
I could never reach her.

2033
02:00:01,350 --> 02:00:03,310
我无法让她爱我
I could never make her love me.

2034
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,890
我总觉得她会爱我 那么多的钱…
I always felt she should have gone for all that money...

2035
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:11,230
第一次在生命中成为一个重要的人 一个家、孩子
being somebody for the first time in her life, a home, a kid.

2036
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:14,190
但事实并非如此 那样做却行不通
That's not what happened. It didn't work out that way.

2037
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:15,800
-都好吗？ -我们能怎么办？
Everything all right? SAM: What could we do?

2038
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:18,300
过一阵子后，我们开始放对方的假
After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.

2039
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,190
短期的不见面
you know about little separations.

2040
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:23,950
那时，我记得金吉儿 带着艾美去比佛利山庄
At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.

2041
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,950
她要去逛一个礼拜的街
She was gonna spend a week shopping.

2042
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:29,330
-是的，罗斯坦先生 -比佛利大饭店
OPERATOR: Yes, Mr. Rothstein. The Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills.

2043
02:00:29,750 --> 02:00:32,290
-你好，比佛利大饭店 -请找山姆罗斯坦夫人
RECEPTIONIST: Hello, Beverly Hotel. SAM: Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

2044
02:00:32,460 --> 02:00:35,300
很抱歉，罗斯坦先生与夫人 已经退房了
RECEPTIONIST: Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein have checked out already.

2045
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:38,220
罗斯坦先生与夫人？
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?

2046
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:44,220
-是的，他们俩都退房了 -谢谢
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, they both checked out. SAM: Thank you.

2047
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:51,390
喂
Hello.

2048
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:55,270
我老婆跟她一个老朋友在洛杉矶
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.

2049
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,610
一个叫莱斯特戴蒙德的败类
Some lowlife named Lester Diamond.

2050
02:00:57,740 --> 02:01:00,530
我女儿跟他们在一起 他们会试着绑架她
My daughter's with them. They're gonna try and kidnap her.

2051
02:01:00,660 --> 02:01:03,410
-你那边有人吗？ -我们会帮你搞定
SAM: Is there anybody you can send? MAN: We'll take care of it.

2052
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:11,080
查到电话号码与住址了
We got a number and an address.

2053
02:01:11,170 --> 02:01:14,790
喂，是莱斯特吗？
SAM: Hello. Is this Lester?

2054
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:16,840
哪位？
Who's calling?

2055
02:01:16,930 --> 02:01:20,090
我是山姆罗斯坦 我要跟金吉儿讲话
This is Sam Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger.

2056
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,050
她不在这儿，山姆
She's not here, Sam.

2057
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:24,750
你给我听好 我要跟金吉儿说话
Listen to me very carefully. I want to talk to Ginger.

2058
02:01:25,270 --> 02:01:28,970
我要我的孩子 我要她马上搭下班飞机回来
I want my kid back. I want her put on a plane immediately.

2059
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:31,940
-我知道她在，别玩把戏 -山姆，我没有
SAM: I know she's there. Don't fuck around. LESTER: I wouldn't.

2060
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:34,820
你不应这么做
You shouldn't do this.

2061
02:01:34,940 --> 02:01:37,270
你懂不懂？叫她听电话
SAM: You understand? Put her on the fucking phone.

2062
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:39,730
山姆，我不知道她在哪儿
Sam, I don't know where she is.

2063
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:43,400
听着，我可以待会儿打给你吗？
LESTER: So, listen, can I call you back in a few minutes?

2064
02:01:48,210 --> 02:01:49,950
-我马上回你 -马上
LESTER: I'll call back. SAM: Right away.

2065
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,580
-马上 -好的
-Right back. -You got it.

2066
02:01:52,630 --> 02:01:56,000
白痴，好了 我多拖了一些时间
Schmuck. All right, I just bought us a few minutes.

2067
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:58,250
你想报复吗？
LESTER: You want to get back at this prick?

2068
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:01,460
那保险箱里有两百万对吧？
LESTER: You got what, $2 million in that box?

2069
02:02:02,390 --> 02:02:05,840
喂，耽误你一下？ 他保险箱里有两百万对吧？
You got a minute? He's got $2 million in the box, right?

2070
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:08,470
珠宝就留给他，我们拿走现金…
You let him keep your jewels. We take the cash...

2071
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:11,270
与他唯一在乎的另一件东西 他的小公主
and the only other thing he cares about. Her majesty.

2072
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:13,640
我们去欧洲，你把头发染了
We go to Europe. You dye your hair.

2073
02:02:13,980 --> 02:02:17,900
我不要去欧洲 我要去看TheEIephantMan
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.

2074
02:02:18,030 --> 02:02:21,730
我们要去欧洲，让大人讲话 你去染头发
We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.

2075
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:24,110
像我们所说的去整容
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.

2076
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:26,910
你觉得他会愿意付多少赎金？
How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?

2077
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,710
-我不要去欧洲 -你给我闭嘴
AMY: I don't want to go to Europe. LESTER: Shut your mouth.

2078
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:31,870
-你才闭嘴 -你要我过来？
AMY: You shut up. LESTER: Want me to come over?

2079
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,240
我一巴掌打死你，别找我麻烦！
LESTER: I'll smack your face. Don't give me your shit!

2080
02:02:34,550 --> 02:02:37,000
这本来是个梦 但现在要实现了
This has always been a dream, but now we're going.

2081
02:02:37,090 --> 02:02:40,790
-莱斯特，他打到这儿来 -他刚在电话上
-Lester, he called you here. -Right. Ace was on the phone.

2082
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:43,130
-我刚跟他讲完 -所以他知道你在哪儿
-I just talked to him. -So he knows where you are.

2083
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,510
这表示他现在就派人过来了
That means he's sending some guys over here now.

2084
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:48,390
这表示他在电话旁像个蠢蛋…
It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell....

2085
02:02:48,850 --> 02:02:52,430
对，他就像是蠢蛋坐在电话旁 等你打给他！
GINGER: Yeah, he's sitting by the phone waiting for you to call him back!

2086
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:56,430
我们该怎么办？他可能 已经派人在门外守着了！
What are we gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fucking house!

2087
02:02:56,570 --> 02:02:59,850
-又是你在那儿鬼扯！ -快拿行李，快走！
-It's this fucking bullshit of yours! -Get your bag! Let's go!

2088
02:03:00,780 --> 02:03:04,650
-什么鬼扯？你想现在讨论这吗？ -你唠叨完了没？
-What bullshit? You want to talk it over? -Are you done yakking?

2089
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:06,570
快！快上车！
Go! Get in the car!

2090
02:03:07,330 --> 02:03:09,650
冷静点，没人要被杀
Just relax. Nobody's killing anybody.

2091
02:03:09,790 --> 02:03:11,530
-他一定会杀了我 -冷静点
GINGER: I think he's gonna kill me. NICKY: Relax.

2092
02:03:11,670 --> 02:03:15,530
一个小时后打这支电话给我 我想想办法
Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone. I'll see what I can do.

2093
02:03:16,170 --> 02:03:18,710
我一个小时后打给你…
I'll call you back in an hour at this number...

2094
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:20,670
-你会接对不对？ -我会在
-and you'll be there, right? -I'll be here.

2095
02:03:20,800 --> 02:03:24,220
听着，别再做什么蠢事了 你还好吗？
Listen, don't do anything else crazy. You all right?

2096
02:03:24,640 --> 02:03:25,920
好，再见
Okay, bye.

2097
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:29,180
-停止 -是她开始的
GINGER: Knock it off. LESTER: She started it.

2098
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:30,770
都是她开始的
She started the whole thing.

2099
02:03:30,890 --> 02:03:33,390
-你别想开车 -我来开
-Don't even think you're gonna drive. -I'm gonna drive.

2100
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:36,480
-我可不想坐疯婆子开的车 -你快把我搞疯了！
LESTER: I'm not gonna drive with a crazy woman. You're driving me nuts!

2101
02:03:36,610 --> 02:03:39,730
滚到旁边去！ 我要将这小鬼装箱寄到玻利维亚去！
Get on the passenger side! I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!

2102
02:03:56,840 --> 02:03:58,170
我们能不能…
Can we....

2103
02:04:16,190 --> 02:04:17,470
金吉儿打给我
Ginger called me.

2104
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:25,740
-我说她打给我 -她想怎样？
NICKY: I just told you she called me. SAM: What'd she want?

2105
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:29,660
她不敢打给你
She was afraid to call you.

2106
02:04:30,580 --> 02:04:33,410
她又跟那败类在一起了 艾美在他们手上
She's with that cocksucker again. They got Amy.

2107
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:37,460
她想回来，可是她害怕你会杀了她
She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.

2108
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:39,830
他们想绑架我的孩子 你觉得我会怎样？
They're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?

2109
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:44,800
我知道，你怎么不来找我？ 这是家务事，不是公事
I know. Why didn't you come to me? This is family. It ain't business.

2110
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,550
你却打电话回老家 这样让我们很难看
Meanwhile, you made calls back home. It makes us look bad out here.

2111
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,720
这样来来回回
Back and forth, this one and that one.

2112
02:04:51,810 --> 02:04:54,510
在这期间她也一样会跑了 不是吗？
In the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?

2113
02:04:56,230 --> 02:04:58,270
我该拿这女人怎么办？
What am I going to do with this woman?

2114
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:03,570
-快把我搞疯了 -我觉得你…
SAM: Driving me fucking crazy. NICKY: I think if you...

2115
02:05:03,700 --> 02:05:07,480
应该保证不会动她，她才会回来
assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.

2116
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:10,780
简直被她搞疯了
Driving me fucking crazy.

2117
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:13,030
她回来后你再从长计议
NICKY: Once you get her here, think about it.

2118
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:15,610
最起码先把孩子弄回来 她也想回来
Wait till you get the kid back. She wants to come back.

2119
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:17,870
这才是重点
That's the main thing here.

2120
02:05:18,710 --> 02:05:20,340
你要孩子不是吗？
You want your kid, don't you?

2121
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:26,550
喂
SAM: Hello.

2122
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:31,220
是我，你迫不及待 想跟我讲话吧？
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?

2123
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:34,270
听着，我不会问你人在哪儿
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.

2124
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:38,720
只是请你将艾美马上 送上飞机回来
Just, please, put Amy on a plane to get her here right away.

2125
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:41,480
-我别无所求 -你…
SAM: That's all I'm asking. GINGER: Do you....

2126
02:05:41,780 --> 02:05:44,810
我是说，我不觉得 她应该一个人回去
I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.

2127
02:05:46,910 --> 02:05:48,070
你这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

2128
02:05:48,780 --> 02:05:50,060
我是说…
What I mean is--

2129
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:54,200
如果我回去…
Do you think if I came back....

2130
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,120
你可以原谅我吗？
Do you think you could forgive me?

2131
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:01,710
老实说，我不知道
I gotta tell you, I don't know.

2132
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:03,670
我了解
I understand that.

2133
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:06,720
我知道我搞砸了
I know I fucked up.

2134
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:11,140
-那钱呢？盒子呢？ -老实说…
-What about the money? Where's the box? -I gotta tell you...

2135
02:06:12,390 --> 02:06:14,960
我做错事了 我花了一些钱
I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.

2136
02:06:15,100 --> 02:06:18,020
-少很多吗？ -蛮多的
SAM: What's it under? GINGER: Pretty serious.

2137
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:22,640
-多少 -两万五以下
SAM: How serious? GINGER: It's under $25,000.

2138
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:24,820
-两万五以下？ -对
SAM: It's under $25,000? GINGER: Yeah.

2139
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:27,900
-剩下的两百万还在吗？ -在，其他的都还在
SAM: The $2 million is still there? GINGER: Yeah, I got the rest.

2140
02:06:28,490 --> 02:06:30,200
好吧，没关系
Okay, no big deal. That's okay.

2141
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:32,820
他拿了两万五
He got his $25,000.

2142
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,120
我可以接受，再多就不行了
That I'll live with. Any more, I couldn't.

2143
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:37,240
好
Okay.

2144
02:06:37,330 --> 02:06:40,950
好啦，你在哪里？ 我马上派飞机去接你
All right, all right. Where are you? I'll send a plane for you right away.

2145
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:46,130
嗨，山姆
Hi, Sam.

2146
02:06:57,770 --> 02:06:59,260
你拿去干嘛了？
So what'd you do with it?

2147
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:00,850
什么？
With what?

2148
02:07:02,820 --> 02:07:04,360
钱啊
With the money.

2149
02:07:05,650 --> 02:07:07,360
他需要些衣服
He needed some clothes.

2150
02:07:08,700 --> 02:07:10,490
两万五买衣服？
$25,000 for clothes?

2151
02:07:12,330 --> 02:07:14,200
他还要了只表
He wanted a watch, too.

2152
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:18,960
两万五买衣服和表？
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?

2153
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:24,740
晚安夫人，这边请
GINO: Good evening, signora. This way.

2154
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:27,080
好事是艾美回来了
SAM: The good part was I had Amy back.

2155
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:31,430
我们回家，请管家来过夜 然后送孩子上床
So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.

2156
02:07:31,800 --> 02:07:33,930
我逼自己冷静 然后我们出门吃饭
I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.

2157
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:36,550
我试着让一切缓和…
I tried to keep things nice and civil...

2158
02:07:36,680 --> 02:07:40,680
但是两万五买三套西装？
but $25, 000 for three suits?

2159
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,140
这不太合理
That doesn't make much sense.

2160
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:46,180
第一点，他不可能穿 一千元一套的西装
First of all, he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.

2161
02:07:47,740 --> 02:07:49,560
就算假设他穿，虽然他不会
Let's say he did, which he won't.

2162
02:07:49,820 --> 02:07:52,310
三天内怎么可能 量身订做25套西装？
How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?

2163
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:56,740
怎么可能量得那么快？
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

2164
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:59,400
我付两倍的钱都不可能那么快
I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.

2165
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,460
我还帮他买了只表
I bought him a watch, too.

2166
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:07,170
就算是买了只好表 一只他认为是好的表…
But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice...

2167
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,460
他根本不知道好表长什么样子
he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.

2168
02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:14,050
假设表价在五千 最多一万二，对他来说也不可能
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000 at the most, which is impossible for him.

2169
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:20,090
加上三套一千一套的西装 还剩多少？
Plus, at the most, three suits, $1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?

2170
02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:23,720
-差不多一万左右 -山姆，可以停止吗？
-Around $10,000? -Would you knock it off, Sam?

2171
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:27,020
-我只是想算清楚 -没什么好算的
SAM: I'm just trying to figure it out. GINGER: There's nothing to figure out.

2172
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:32,310
我回家了，我们在协调
I'm home. We're working it out.

2173
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:35,110
可是我以前也听过 “我们在协调”
But I've been told before, "We're working it out."

2174
02:08:35,330 --> 02:08:36,870
你以为你回家…
You think that you're home...

2175
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:41,150
在你对我与艾美所做的一切后 算是给我面子吗？
after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?

2176
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:49,760
加上表，
Counting the watch,

2177
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:53,720
假设你们这个周末 花费了四千好了…
let's say another $4,000 for expenses this weekend...

2178
02:08:54,890 --> 02:08:56,840
我相信你们一定过得很愉快
of which you must have had a good time.

2179
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:58,760
至少我很确定他很愉快
I know he did. That's for sure.

2180
02:08:58,850 --> 02:09:02,550
我知道那狗杂种一定很快乐
I know that fucking piece of shit had a good fucking time.

2181
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,940
花我的钱
On my money.

2182
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:09,520
你干脆就跟他上床算了 你八成也这样做了
You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.

2183
02:09:11,110 --> 02:09:12,940
你看我的表情很奇怪
You're looking at me a certain way.

2184
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:16,280
你热泪盈眶
You're teary-eyed.

2185
02:09:17,290 --> 02:09:19,740
你很难过 你真是个好演员
You're upset. You're a good actress, you know that?

2186
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,320
真他妈的演得好
Good fucking actress.

2187
02:09:23,670 --> 02:09:25,710
你可让任何人可怜你
SAM: You can fucking get pity out of people.

2188
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,580
但我不是嫖客，好吗？
I'm not a john. You understand?

2189
02:09:28,050 --> 02:09:30,920
你一直以为我是 但我不是，我也不是冤大头
You always thought I was, but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.

2190
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:35,080
那可恶的拉皮条狗杂碎
That fucking pimp cocksucker.

2191
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:37,220
上次没杀了他是他命好
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

2192
02:09:37,390 --> 02:09:40,590
他活着是命好 若你们带着艾美…
SAM: Lucky he's fucking living. If you would have stayed with Amy...

2193
02:09:40,680 --> 02:09:42,720
然后走人的话 他就死定了
and you had run away, he would have been dead.

2194
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:45,560
你们俩都死定了
Both of you. Dead. Dead.

2195
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,430
不，不公平
GINGER: No, it isn't fair.

2196
02:10:02,820 --> 02:10:05,600
他晚上根本不回家 有什么了不起？
He doesn't come home at night. What is the big fucking deal?

2197
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:08,270
我走，听着，我真的受不了
I go.... Listen, I just can't fucking take it.

2198
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:11,110
我为什么要忍受？ 这不是我们的协议
Why should I fucking take it? That wasn't the deal.

2199
02:10:11,910 --> 02:10:15,280
他一副好像就只有我有过去的样子
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fucking past.

2200
02:10:15,450 --> 02:10:17,330
他永远都不让我忘记
He'll never let me live it down.

2201
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:20,620
是，我试过，我当然试过
Well, yes, I have tried. Of course I've tried.

2202
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:23,120
你以为我为什么回来？
What the fuck do you think I came back here for?

2203
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,040
不，我不，我想杀了他
No, I'm not. I want to have him killed.

2204
02:10:26,590 --> 02:10:28,750
对，我要杀了他 我受够了
GINGER: I want him killed. I've had it.

2205
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:31,010
你要帮我吗？
So are you with me on this?

2206
02:10:32,680 --> 02:10:35,250
你想干掉我？我就在这儿
You want to get rid of me? Here I am.

2207
02:10:35,770 --> 02:10:37,310
来啊，干掉我啊
Go ahead. Get rid of me.

2208
02:10:38,350 --> 02:10:41,220
-喂 -是的！
SAM: Hello. GINGER: Yes, I do!

2209
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:45,980
我恨死你了！我受不了了！
GINGER: I fucking hate you! I can't take it anymore!

2210
02:10:46,190 --> 02:10:48,980
是，我要杀了你！ 我恨死你了！
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fucking guts!

2211
02:10:49,110 --> 02:10:52,070
你恨死我了？ 我要你现在就给我过来！
SAM: You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now!

2212
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:58,620
我要你滚！
SAM: I want you out of here!

2213
02:11:04,710 --> 02:11:06,540
拿好行李给我滚！
Take your fucking bag and get out of here!

2214
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:08,750
我会走，但我现在就要我的钱！
I'll go, but I want my money right now!

2215
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:11,750
-你会拿到钱的！别担心 -协议结束了
-You'll get your money! Don't worry. -The arrangement is over.

2216
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:14,420
-废话！ -我还是拿得到钱
SAM: No kidding! GINGER: And I still get my money.

2217
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:17,630
我现在就要一些现金 你不能就这样把我赶出街！
I need some cash now! You can't just put me in the street!

2218
02:11:17,770 --> 02:11:20,300
你从一认识我就没诚实过！
You've never been straight with me ever since I met you!

2219
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,550
你从一开始就没爱过我！
You never even loved me in the first place!

2220
02:11:22,650 --> 02:11:25,350
跟你这婊子一起 我连脑后都得长眼睛！
I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you bitch!

2221
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:28,690
我怎么爱你？ 你对我像对条狗一样！
How could I love you? You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!

2222
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:32,490
-你连狗都不如！ -去你的！
SAM: You're lower than a dog! GINGER: Fuck you!

2223
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:34,320
拿去！够了没？
Here! Is this enough money?

2224
02:11:34,450 --> 02:11:36,990
可以活两天吗？拿去！
Will it last you two fucking days? Take it!

2225
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:40,360
-贪得无厌的婊子，钱拿去 -我要去银行…
-Greedy bitch. Take the fucking money. -I'm going to the bank...

2226
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,910
-我还要去拿我的珠宝！ -早上9点开，去拿啊
-and I'm getting my jewelry, too! -It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.

2227
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:47,040
别叫你的人去阻止我！ 我说真的！
Don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it!

2228
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:49,080
我向你保证我绝对不会阻止你
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.

2229
02:11:49,220 --> 02:11:51,890
你别想以一口箱子就打发我！
You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!

2230
02:11:52,010 --> 02:11:55,090
剩下的明天再回来拿吧 给我滚
Come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.

2231
02:11:55,390 --> 02:11:57,100
-我要带艾美走 -不行
GINGER: I'm taking Amy. SAM: You're not.

2232
02:11:57,220 --> 02:11:58,680
我要，我现在去叫她
I am. I'm waking her up right now.

2233
02:11:58,810 --> 02:12:00,930
你w药了，你这个毒虫 给我滚
SAM: You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.

2234
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:02,850
我不是！她也是我女儿！
I am not! She's my daughter, too!

2235
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:05,680
写信给我的律师吧，去你的！
SAM: Send my lawyers a letter, god-fucking-damn you!

2236
02:12:06,230 --> 02:12:10,280
你跑不掉的！ 你别想不遵守你的诺言！
GINGER: You're not getting away with this! You're not gonna cut me out of my end!

2237
02:12:11,530 --> 02:12:12,910
王八蛋！
GINGER: Fucker!

2238
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:08,450
好笑的是，经过这么多事 我还是不想让她走
SAM: The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.

2239
02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:11,210
她是我孩子的妈，我爱她
She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.

2240
02:13:11,920 --> 02:13:12,430
后来，
Later,

2241
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:15,870
我发现我并不想 将钱给她，因为我若给了…
I realized I didn't want to give her the money because if I did...

2242
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:19,170
我知道将再也见不到她
I knew I'd never see her again.

2243
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:33,730
在学校要开开心心的喔
Have a good day at school, okay?

2244
02:13:33,950 --> 02:13:35,410
好的，天使
Okay, angel.

2245
02:13:40,330 --> 02:13:43,530
从现在起，我随时都得知道 你与艾美在哪儿
From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.

2246
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:47,320
这是呼叫器
SAM: Here's a beeper.

2247
02:13:48,590 --> 02:13:50,130
我要你拿着
I want you to keep it on you.

2248
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:51,960
很轻
It's very light.

2249
02:13:52,550 --> 02:13:54,420
让我可以随时打给你
SAM: So I can call you whenever I have to.

2250
02:13:58,680 --> 02:13:59,790
好吗？
Okay?

2251
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:12,310
你能怎么做？ 你想怎么做呢？
NICKY: What are you supposed to do? What do you wanna do?

2252
02:14:12,490 --> 02:14:15,320
你想就像现在这样吗？ 你也不能啊
You want to stay the way you are? You can't do that.

2253
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:18,360
两个人若合不来 总要有人出来说…
Two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it....

2254
02:14:18,490 --> 02:14:21,450
这不关我的事 但我觉得你应该这样做
It's not my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.

2255
02:14:21,580 --> 02:14:23,290
你说得对，我知道
You're right. I know.

2256
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:25,320
-我只是… -什么？
-I was just-- -What?

2257
02:14:27,210 --> 02:14:28,870
-没什么 -你想说什么？
-Nothing. -What were you gonna say?

2258
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,210
-我不… -告诉我你本来想说什么
-I don't-- -Tell me what you were gonna say.

2259
02:14:31,300 --> 02:14:32,410
真的？
Yeah?

2260
02:14:33,340 --> 02:14:36,710
我在想说你有没有认识 银行的人…
I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank...

2261
02:14:37,340 --> 02:14:39,380
可以帮我把珠宝拿出来？
who could help me get my jewelry out?

2262
02:14:39,930 --> 02:14:41,590
有很多钱在那儿
There's a lot of money in there.

2263
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:45,470
我愿意重赏任何可以帮助我的人
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.

2264
02:14:47,020 --> 02:14:48,680
我想想办法
Let me think about that.

2265
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:53,020
我看看能找谁 一定得是可以信得过的人
Let me see who I got. Gotta get somebody I can trust.

2266
02:14:53,530 --> 02:14:55,690
你也知道他是不会把珠宝给我的
You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.

2267
02:14:57,110 --> 02:15:00,450
他把那把钥匙抓得很紧 我看就差没藏到屁眼里去了
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.

2268
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:04,240
说得好，真像是山姆
You're right. That's Sammy.

2269
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:06,500
搞不好真的就在那儿
And he's probably got it there, too.

2270
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:11,790
他真是命大，我本可以埋了他
He's so fucking lucky. I could have buried him.

2271
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:15,260
我本可以去欧洲并把孩子带走
I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.

2272
02:15:16,630 --> 02:15:19,340
那他可能就会找到我 并把我杀了
Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.

2273
02:15:19,680 --> 02:15:22,220
不，他不会，但我会
No, he wouldn't. I would have.

2274
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:25,680
-不过他是没错 -别闹了
-He'd have been right, too. Seriously. -Come on.

2275
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:28,510
你不能就这样把他的孩子带走
You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.

2276
02:15:28,600 --> 02:15:30,380
我没有，我本来有
I didn't. I did,

2277
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:32,770
但后来我照你所说的回家了
but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.

2278
02:15:32,900 --> 02:15:35,770
你是，你照做了，很好
You did. You're right. I like that.

2279
02:15:36,490 --> 02:15:40,620
-我喜欢这样，你做对了 -我听了你的话
-That's what I like, you did the right thing. -I did what you told me to.

2280
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:44,110
-是的 -你总会告诉我正确的做法
-Yes, you did. -You always tell me the right thing to do.

2281
02:15:50,590 --> 02:15:53,370
他真的在这儿把自己搞砸了 不是吗？
He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?

2282
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:56,460
-是啊 -这一切改变了他的想法
-He sure did. -Everything went to his head.

2283
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:00,290
改变了
Changed.

2284
02:16:00,430 --> 02:16:02,880
-他变了，他已不是同一个人了 -不，他不是
-He did. He ain't the same person. -No, he's not.

2285
02:16:04,770 --> 02:16:07,470
-他真的觉得自己多了不起 -的确
-He really thinks who the fuck he is. -Exactly.

2286
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:12,900
他恨我
He hates me.

2287
02:16:12,980 --> 02:16:14,940
他好恨我
He hates my fucking guts.

2288
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,280
别这样，你最坚强了 这不算什么
Come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.

2289
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:25,950
-别哭 -我没你想像的坚强
NICKY: Don't cry. GINGER: I'm not as tough as you think I am.

2290
02:16:26,160 --> 02:16:27,620
你有
Yes, you are.

2291
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:30,160
我没有，我好怕他
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.

2292
02:16:30,290 --> 02:16:32,750
-我永远都不知道他下步要干嘛 -别这样
-I never know what he's gonna do. -Come on.

2293
02:16:33,710 --> 02:16:36,710
-别怕 -我需要帮助
-Don't be scared. -I need some help.

2294
02:16:38,840 --> 02:16:40,500
我需要帮助
I need some help.

2295
02:16:42,300 --> 02:16:43,680
你得帮我
You gotta help me.

2296
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:46,600
我需要个新靠山
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2297
02:16:47,600 --> 02:16:49,470
真的，我需要个新的靠山
I do. I need a new sponsor.

2298
02:16:49,560 --> 02:16:51,390
-这是你想要的？ -是啊
-Is that what you want? -Yeah.

2299
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:53,310
-靠山？ -是的
-A sponsor? -Yeah.

2300
02:16:55,570 --> 02:17:00,480
好，别担心 没人敢动你的
Okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody will fuck with you anymore.

2301
02:17:01,450 --> 02:17:03,320
我会照顾你的
I'll take care of you.

2302
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:06,700
-谢谢你 -这是你想要的，不是吗？
GINGER: Thank you. NICKY: It's what you want, isn't it?

2303
02:17:30,350 --> 02:17:31,600
艾斯的老婆
MAN: That's Ace's wife.

2304
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:45,030
这给老板看太好了
MAN 2: This is great for the boss.

2305
02:18:14,770 --> 02:18:15,970
-嗨 -嗨
GINGER: Hi. SAM: Hi.

2306
02:18:19,820 --> 02:18:22,390
-你没回呼叫器 -我丢了
SAM: You didn't answer your beeper. GINGER: I threw it away.

2307
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:24,820
你丢了
You threw it away?

2308
02:18:24,910 --> 02:18:27,360
我试着带着 我知道你希望我带着…
I tried to do it. I know that you want me to, but....

2309
02:18:27,450 --> 02:18:30,240
可是我开在高速公路上时 它也在响
I'm driving down the freeway and the fucking thing beeps.

2310
02:18:30,580 --> 02:18:32,700
在餐馆也是，很丢脸
GINGER: I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.

2311
02:18:32,790 --> 02:18:35,710
我不要再带了，艾美呢？
I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy?

2312
02:18:37,380 --> 02:18:40,300
-她睡了 -我买了你要的烟
SAM: I put her to bed. GINGER: I got your cigarettes.

2313
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:44,930
奥斯卡要你跟他连络
GINGER: Oscar wants you to call him.

2314
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:49,680
-你跟谁吃的午餐？ -珍妮佛
SAM: So who'd you go to lunch with? GINGER: Jennifer.

2315
02:18:49,810 --> 02:18:52,180
-去哪儿吃？ -欧华赌场
SAM: Where'd you go? GINGER: To the Riviera.

2316
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:55,220
吃什么？
What'd you have?

2317
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:58,930
-我叫沙拉 -珍妮佛呢？
GINGER: I had a salad. SAM: What did Jennifer have?

2318
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:03,020
她也一样
She had the same.

2319
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:05,270
好
Okay.

2320
02:19:06,780 --> 02:19:08,820
我要你打给珍妮佛…
I want you to call Jennifer...

2321
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:12,160
我要你叫她告诉你 你午餐吃了什么
and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.

2322
02:19:12,290 --> 02:19:14,200
我从另一线听
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.

2323
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:17,960
-你干嘛这样？ -你知道为什么
-Why do you want to do that? -You know why I want to do it.

2324
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:20,790
-照做就是了 -好啦
-Just do it. -Fine.

2325
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:23,590
我只是需要拿个碗装这个
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.

2326
02:19:32,310 --> 02:19:33,510
忙线中
The line's busy.

2327
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:34,840
没人在
There's nobody there.

2328
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:44,610
-喂 -喂，珍妮佛，是山姆
JENNlFER: Hello? SAM: Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2329
02:19:47,950 --> 02:19:50,620
好啦，我没跟珍妮佛吃饭
All right. I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.

2330
02:19:58,290 --> 02:19:59,410
那你跟谁？
Who were you with?

2331
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:02,160
一个人
I was with somebody.

2332
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:05,460
我知道你有伴 是谁？
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?

2333
02:20:14,140 --> 02:20:16,680
我只希望不是我想的那个人
I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.

2334
02:20:19,730 --> 02:20:21,810
我只希望不是他
I just hope it's not that.

2335
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:27,070
我知道她在外面乱来
SAM: I knew she fucked around.

2336
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:30,150
她做她做的 我也做我要做的…
Yeah, she did what she did, and I did what I had to do, but...

2337
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:34,040
可是，天啊 尼奇是她所能做出最糟糕的事
Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.

2338
02:20:35,370 --> 02:20:36,700
若他不愿停呢？
What if he won't stop?

2339
02:20:37,080 --> 02:20:39,120
我们两个可能都会没命
SAM: It could get us both killed.

2340
02:20:39,710 --> 02:20:40,910
我可以让他停
I can back him off.

2341
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:47,710
她在必要时可以很有说服力
SAM: She was very convincing when she wanted to be.

2342
02:20:48,430 --> 02:20:50,800
她是这样让他停的
And this is how she backed him off.

2343
02:20:57,980 --> 02:20:59,010
嗨，金吉儿
Hey, Ginger.

2344
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:02,220
别忘了，要是他追问你
Don't forget, if you're challenged...

2345
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:04,730
不管他问你什么，你都不要承认
if he asks anything, deny everything.

2346
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:07,900
懂不懂？ 我不想他跟老家那头抱怨
You understand? I don't want him bringing beefs back home.

2347
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:10,570
这样麻烦就大了
That could really cause a serious problem.

2348
02:21:11,490 --> 02:21:13,570
得小心点 他也不是蠢蛋，懂吗？
Got to be careful. He's not dumb, you know?

2349
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,250
你懂我的意思吧？
You hear what I'm saying, right?

2350
02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:17,410
我知道，你不用告诉我
I know. You don't have to tell me that.

2351
02:21:17,670 --> 02:21:19,040
你当我白痴吗？
Do you think I'm stupid?

2352
02:21:20,790 --> 02:21:22,670
我当你白痴？不
Do I think you're stupid? No.

2353
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:26,090
我当你是美女，但我得走了
I think you're beautiful. But I gotta go.

2354
02:21:29,090 --> 02:21:31,930
这时候，尼奇在外的事已经乱到…
SAM: By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets...

2355
02:21:32,060 --> 02:21:35,590
每次玛雷诺回老家时 皮箱都越来越小
that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.

2356
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,930
后来甚至严重到 他每走入一个地方…
It got to the point, when he walked into the place...

2357
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:43,730
他都不确定会被亲还是被杀
he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.

2358
02:21:43,820 --> 02:21:45,770
法兰克，我有事问你
REMO: Frankie, I want to ask you something.

2359
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:48,100
私人的事
It's private.

2360
02:21:48,490 --> 02:21:50,360
我要你说实话
But I want you to tell me the truth.

2361
02:21:51,240 --> 02:21:52,870
当然，利蒙
Of course, Remo.

2362
02:21:53,290 --> 02:21:55,660
我要你说真话
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.

2363
02:21:57,290 --> 02:21:59,030
我对你一直都很诚实，利蒙
I always tell you the truth, Remo.

2364
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:02,830
法兰克，小矮个…
Frankie, the little guy...

2365
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:05,000
他不是在搞犹太人的老婆吧？
he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?

2366
02:22:05,130 --> 02:22:08,130
因为若他有，就是个问题
Because if he is, it's a problem.

2367
02:22:11,300 --> 02:22:12,500
我能说什么？
FRANK: What could I say?

2368
02:22:12,760 --> 02:22:14,550
我知道若我答错了…
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...

2369
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:18,890
尼奇、金吉儿与艾斯全部 都可能被干掉
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up getting killed.

2370
02:22:19,230 --> 02:22:21,720
因为这些老家伙们有个禁忌
Because there's one thing about these old-timers.

2371
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:24,930
就是他们不能忍受搞别人老婆
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.

2372
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:26,530
那很难看
It's bad for business.

2373
02:22:26,610 --> 02:22:30,190
所以我撒谎 虽然我知道对盖吉撒谎…
So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...

2374
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:32,320
可能会害我也被干掉
I could wind up getting killed, too.

2375
02:22:33,240 --> 02:22:37,110
-不，我没见到这种事 -你确定？
-No, I ain't seen anything like that. -Are you sure?

2376
02:22:38,500 --> 02:22:39,780
我很确定
I'm positive.

2377
02:22:40,580 --> 02:22:44,500
利蒙，那边现在可是一团糟
Remo, things are very fucked up down there.

2378
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:46,540
我知道，所以我才问你
I know. That's why I'm asking.

2379
02:22:46,670 --> 02:22:48,710
我最担心的是尼奇
You see, my main concern is Nicky.

2380
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:53,290
我想知道他最近如何 过得好不好
I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.

2381
02:22:54,100 --> 02:22:58,970
-他很好 -我要你看好尼奇
-He's good, he's fine. -I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

2382
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:01,220
-为了我 -没问题
-Do it for me. -No problem.

2383
02:23:01,650 --> 02:23:06,520
你知道，我不想得罪我们的朋友
You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.

2384
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:08,220
你懂吗？
You understand?

2385
02:23:08,360 --> 02:23:10,400
-我懂了 -好
-I understand. -Okay.

2386
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:13,360
法兰克，你是个好孩子
Frankie, you're a good boy.

2387
02:23:13,910 --> 02:23:15,150
谢了，利蒙
Thanks, Remo.

2388
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:18,120
这时，尼奇与他那帮人 已经跌到谷底了
SAM: By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.

2389
02:23:18,250 --> 02:23:20,070
赌城真的改变了他
Vegas really got to him.

2390
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,410
酒精、可卡因、女人
The booze, the coke, the broads.

2391
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,340
我是说，他开始大意
I mean, he got sloppy.

2392
02:23:27,300 --> 02:23:29,250
他再也不是以前那个尼奇了
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

2393
02:23:29,380 --> 02:23:31,840
-你喝太多了 -去你的
FRANK: You must've drank too much. NICKY: Fuck yourself.

2394
02:23:31,930 --> 02:23:33,970
有晚他对个家伙开了三枪…
SAM: One night, he had to belt a guy three times...

2395
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:35,840
才将他打死
before the guy finally went down.

2396
02:23:35,970 --> 02:23:38,680
要是以前，尼奇只要一枪就够了
In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot.

2397
02:23:38,890 --> 02:23:40,430
加上这些成份…
You add this into the mix....

2398
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:43,680
可能赌城改变了我们全部
Maybe Vegas got to all of us.

2399
02:23:44,150 --> 02:23:46,350
他那帮人随着他一起堕落
His crew followed him right over the edge.

2400
02:23:46,690 --> 02:23:49,150
他们每天一半的时间 都在吸毒中渡过
They were all tuned up half the time on coke.

2401
02:23:49,450 --> 02:23:52,400
他们开始做些蠢事 尤其是布鲁
They started doing stupid things. The worst was Blue.

2402
02:23:52,530 --> 02:23:55,280
-你们要干嘛？ -警察！别下车！
-What do you guys want? -Police! Stay in the car!

2403
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:57,450
他从不知道何时该闭嘴
SAM: He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.

2404
02:23:57,580 --> 02:23:59,950
-放下枪！ -去你的！
COP: Drop the gun! BLUE: Fuck you!

2405
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:07,080
条子朝布鲁开枪…
SAM: The cops shot Blue...

2406
02:24:07,210 --> 02:24:09,670
因为他们以为 他手上拿的潜艇堡是手枪
because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.

2407
02:24:10,380 --> 02:24:12,670
他们也许是对的 但谁知道？
They could have been right, but who knows?

2408
02:24:12,760 --> 02:24:16,630
天啊，什么枪？ 他手上拿的是潜艇堡
COP: Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.

2409
02:24:16,810 --> 02:24:19,010
不然能怎样？这儿这么黑
COP 2: What do you want? It's pitch black.

2410
02:24:19,100 --> 02:24:21,640
-是锡箔纸，看来像枪！ -你这智障！
COP 2: It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun! COP: You moron!

2411
02:24:21,770 --> 02:24:24,520
-我得办两个月的公文！ -该怎么办？
COP: I'll be doing paperwork for two months! COP 2: What'll we do?

2412
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:26,150
-抱歉！ -白痴！
COP 2: Sorry! COP: You jerk-off!

2413
02:24:26,400 --> 02:24:28,080
更糟的是，为了报仇
SAM: To make matters worse... to get even,

2414
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,770
尼奇那帮人有天晚上…
Nicky's crew got stoned one night...

2415
02:24:29,940 --> 02:24:32,190
吸毒后跑去扫射警察的家
and started shooting up the cops' houses.

2416
02:24:43,290 --> 02:24:46,870
后来严重到连在掏金热潮里 都不方便讲话…
It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore...

2417
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,910
因为联邦调查局在窃听
because the Feds put a wire in the wall.

2418
02:24:49,050 --> 02:24:52,050
他们连在外面讲话时 都得捂住嘴
Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...

2419
02:24:52,130 --> 02:24:54,290
因为联邦调查局请来了 读唇语的专家
because the Feds brought in lip readers.

2420
02:24:54,470 --> 02:24:57,260
尼奇是从一个欠他钱的 银行职员那听说的
Nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money.

2421
02:24:58,140 --> 02:25:00,510
他又问我你跟犹太人老婆的事
FRANK: He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

2422
02:25:01,140 --> 02:25:03,510
走、走、走 你说什么？
NICKY: Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

2423
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:06,470
他又问我你跟犹太人老婆的事
FRANK: He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.

2424
02:25:06,980 --> 02:25:08,140
你怎么说？
NICKY: What'd you tell him?

2425
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:11,190
我说我不知道
FRANK: I told him I didn't know nothing.

2426
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:14,770
杰葛与东尼国理拉说 你要是有做什么就完了
FRANK: Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.

2427
02:25:15,990 --> 02:25:18,660
你想他是不是背着我回老家 跟他们抱怨？
NICKY: You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?

2428
02:25:19,490 --> 02:25:21,870
不，若有的话 你应该早听到风声
FRANK: No, you would have heard something.

2429
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,450
-有什么阻止他这么做？ -是啊
NICKY: What's to stop him? FRANK: I know.

2430
02:25:27,710 --> 02:25:30,580
我不相信他了 但老大们不会答应我干掉他的
NICKY: I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.

2431
02:25:31,670 --> 02:25:33,380
但他们一直在问
FRANK: But they keep asking about it.

2432
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:36,720
当然会问罗 他们靠他赚钱
NICKY: Sure they're asking. They earn with the prick.

2433
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:41,520
我有种感觉 他好像想引发战争
NICKY: I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a war or something.

2434
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:46,720
我还不确定 但你知道我要你干嘛吗？
NICKY: I'm not sure yet. But you know what I want you to do?

2435
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:48,050
这是谁？
NICKY: Who's this guy?

2436
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:51,100
谁都不是
FRANK: That ain't nobody.

2437
02:25:51,650 --> 02:25:53,310
你知道我要你干嘛吗？
NICKY: You know what I want you to do?

2438
02:25:53,900 --> 02:25:57,320
找个人在沙漠挖个洞 要他告诉你在哪儿
NICKY: Get some guys to dig a hole in the desert and show you where it's at.

2439
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:01,450
-安基罗与本斯特 -我还不确定
FRANK: Angelo and Buster. NICKY: I'm not sure yet.

2440
02:26:01,870 --> 02:26:04,620
-他们肯干的 -我准备好时会跟你说…
FRANK: They'll do it. NICKY: When I'm ready, I'll say the words:

2441
02:26:04,750 --> 02:26:08,450
“去找犹太人” 然后你就让他消失，懂不懂？
"Go see the Jew." And you make it disappear. Know what I mean?

2442
02:26:08,710 --> 02:26:10,290
让我知道，但你得准备好
FRANK: Let me know. But you gotta be ready.

2443
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:12,210
你懂我的意思吗？
FRANK: You know what I'm talking about?

2444
02:26:13,670 --> 02:26:15,050
我有叫你行动吗？
NICKY: Did I say to do anything yet?

2445
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:16,600
我说了我不确定，我会让你知道
NICKY: I said I'm not sure. I'll let you know.

2446
02:26:16,750 --> 02:26:18,220
我得再想想
I want to think about it.

2447
02:26:18,720 --> 02:26:21,510
那些浑蛋呢？ 在旅馆里吗？
NICKY: Where are these pricks at? They're in the motel?

2448
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:24,840
那里或是银行 我也不知道，到处都是
FRANK: There or in the fucking bank. I don't know. All over the joint.

2449
02:26:49,790 --> 02:26:50,960
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

2450
02:26:53,800 --> 02:26:56,500
有我的电话就转给雪伯提先生
Any calls for me, give them to Mr. Sherbert.

2451
02:26:56,630 --> 02:26:59,840
-好的，罗斯坦先生 -我回家一会儿
-Sure, Mr. Rothstein. -I'm going home for a few seconds.

2452
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:10,050
他要回家了
He's on his way home.

2453
02:27:11,730 --> 02:27:13,940
好的
Okay.

2454
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:25,740
喂？金吉儿？
Hello? Ginger?

2455
02:27:26,120 --> 02:27:28,610
-爸爸，救命！ -艾美！
AMY: Help, Daddy! SAM: Amy!

2456
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:31,830
-艾美，开门！ -我不能，我被绑起来了！
SAM: Amy, open the door! AMY: I can't! I'm tied!

2457
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:38,590
-爸爸！ -发生什么事！
AMY: Dad! SAM: What happened?

2458
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,920
-是谁？ -是妈妈
SAM: Who did this to you? AMY: Mommy.

2459
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:43,210
我去拿刀把绳子切断
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose.

2460
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:46,510
-不要走！ -没关系，我马上回来
AMY: No, please! SAM: Okay, I'm gonna be right back.

2461
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:49,600
-什么时候的事，甜心？ -我不知道
SAM: When did this happen, honey? AMY: I don't know.

2462
02:27:49,810 --> 02:27:52,430
你妈什么时候做的？ 她什么时候走的？
What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?

2463
02:27:52,650 --> 02:27:54,110
我不知道
AMY: I don't know.

2464
02:28:01,660 --> 02:28:03,150
-喂？ -山姆
SAM: Hello? NICKY: Sammy.

2465
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:05,410
-你是谁？ -是我
SAM: Yeah. Who's this? NICKY: Me.

2466
02:28:05,700 --> 02:28:08,080
-你还好吗？ -我不好
NICKY: You okay? SAM: No, I'm not okay.

2467
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:10,920
-你怎么知道我在？ -我只想跟你谈谈
-How'd you know I was here? -I just wanted to talk to you.

2468
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,840
金吉儿不见了 她将艾美绑在房间并上锁
Ginger's missing. She tied Amy up and locked her in her room.

2469
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:15,500
我不知道她在哪儿
I don't know where she is.

2470
02:28:15,590 --> 02:28:18,630
听着，金吉儿在比萨斜塔 跟我一起
Well, listen, Ginger's here at the Leaning Tower with me.

2471
02:28:19,010 --> 02:28:20,880
她在你那儿？
She's there with you?

2472
02:28:21,010 --> 02:28:22,970
-是，在这儿 -我马上来
NICKY: Yeah, she's here. SAM: I'll be right over.

2473
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,010
好的
All right.

2474
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:29,480
-过来了 -非常好
-Coming over. -Great.

2475
02:28:35,900 --> 02:28:38,020
别闹事，好吗？
Don't make a scene, all right?

2476
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:41,200
我要跟那爱尔兰婊子说话
I want to talk to that Irish bitch.

2477
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:43,200
她想要挽救你们的婚姻
She's trying to save your marriage.

2478
02:28:43,330 --> 02:28:46,030
尼奇，我要见那婊子
Nicky, I want to talk to that fucking bitch.

2479
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,690
客气点，冷静
Be fucking nice. Calm.

2480
02:28:49,750 --> 02:28:53,450
客气点，别搞砸了
Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.

2481
02:29:03,390 --> 02:29:05,380
-嗨，山姆 -你疯了吗？
GINGER: Hi. SAM: Are you out of your mind?

2482
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,560
你把我们的孩子绑起来还锁门？ 你疯了吗？
You tie up our kid and lock the door? Are you out of your mind?

2483
02:29:09,940 --> 02:29:12,010
那是我们的孩子 你他妈的疯了吗？
That's our child. Are you out of your mind?

2484
02:29:12,150 --> 02:29:15,180
只是一下下而已 褓姆刚好不在
It was just for a little while. The baby-sitter wasn't there.

2485
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:17,980
我真该送你去疯人院 你下次再试试看…
I ought to have you committed. You do that again and I'll--

2486
02:29:18,110 --> 02:29:21,280
我只是出去一会儿
I was just gonna be out for a little while.

2487
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:24,440
-她睡了，我一会就要回去的… -听着
She was asleep. I was gonna be back... SAM: Listen.

2488
02:29:24,580 --> 02:29:27,250
-在她醒来前 -听着，你这贱货…
-...before she even woke up. -Listen, you fucking cunt...

2489
02:29:27,370 --> 02:29:29,080
让我告诉你
let me tell you something.

2490
02:29:29,330 --> 02:29:31,320
听我说，听清楚
Listen to me. Listen carefully.

2491
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:34,450
你别想再动她一根汗毛…
You ever touch her again or do anything like that again...

2492
02:29:34,630 --> 02:29:36,330
我会杀了你，就这么简单
I'll fucking kill you, pure and simple.

2493
02:29:36,460 --> 02:29:38,290
你听到没？就这么简单
SAM: You hear me? Pure and simple.

2494
02:29:38,420 --> 02:29:40,460
-你为何不让我走？ -我会杀了你
GINGER: Why don't you let me go? SAM: I'll kill you.

2495
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:43,300
-你这个婊子 -你要我签什么都行
SAM: You fucking whore. I'll sign anything you want me to sign.

2496
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:46,260
我只要珠宝的钥匙 还有让我走
I just want the key to my jewelry, and you to let me go.

2497
02:29:46,350 --> 02:29:48,340
-你想要珠宝？ -放我走
SAM: Want your jewelry? GINGER: Let me go.

2498
02:29:48,430 --> 02:29:50,590
然后让你丢我的脸，你这只猪？
And let you disgrace me, you pig?

2499
02:29:50,730 --> 02:29:52,680
你给我起来当个母亲
SAM: Get up and be a mother.

2500
02:29:52,810 --> 02:29:54,440
立刻上车回家

-Get up. -I wouldn't do that if I were you.

2503
02:30:01,110 --> 02:30:03,400
-我要是你就… -起来！
-I wouldn't do that-- -Get up!

2504
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:05,740
你在威胁我吗？
Are you threatening me?

2505
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:08,400
我现在就可宰了你 起来回家
I'll fucking kill you in this place. Get up and go home.

2506
02:30:08,540 --> 02:30:09,870
我要走了！
I'm going!

2507
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,880
你现在要他批准才能回家？
Now you need approval from him to go home?

2508
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:22,380
那又怎样？你从停车场进来前 又是谁在帮你吹喇叭？
So what? Who blew you in the parking lot before you came in?

2509
02:30:22,510 --> 02:30:24,630
你让我作呕
You make me sick, you fuck.

2510
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:27,550
-一日为娼，终生为娼 -去你的！
-Once a hooker, always a hooker. -Oh, fuck you!

2511

找比利雪伯提
Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.

2513
02:30:40,150 --> 02:30:42,480
-谁啊？ -听好，我待会再解释
BILLY: Who's this? SAM: Listen, I'll explain later.

2514
02:30:42,610 --> 02:30:45,280
你家里有枪吗？ 马上带过来

就留着吧！
Leave it where it is!

2517
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:58,960
他在哪儿？我要杀了那犹太王八蛋！
Where is he? I want that Jew bastard killed!

2518
02:30:59,130 --> 02:31:01,000
把她的车藏到后面去
Hide her car in the back.

2519
02:31:01,130 --> 02:31:03,920
不需要藏我的车！ 他早就知道了！
GINGER: There's no reason to hide my car! He already knows!

2520
02:31:05,010 --> 02:31:07,880
他要是回去告状怎么办？
Supposing he goes back home and makes a fucking beef?

2521
02:31:08,010 --> 02:31:12,180
-我得知道你到底跟他说了什么 -我？我说…
-I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me. -Me? Nothing. I said....

2522
02:31:12,270 --> 02:31:15,350
我说没有，不管他说什么 我都说没有
I said, no. Everything he said, I just kept saying no.

2523
02:31:15,480 --> 02:31:17,440
我早跟你说这很危险
I told you this was fucking dangerous.

2524
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,310
我说：   “金吉儿，状况很危险 你一定要小心”
I said, "Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful."

2525
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:24,310
若真这么危险，你为何不杀了他？
If it's so fucking dangerous, why don't you kill him?

2526
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:26,650
我不会杀他，闭上你的嘴
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up.

2527
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:30,620
-杀了他，做个了断！ -别自做聪明！
-Have him killed, and get it over with! -Don't be such a fucking smart-ass!

2528
02:31:30,750 --> 02:31:34,200
我跟他35年的交情 我会为了你干他？
I know the guy 35 years, I'm gonna whack him for you?

2529
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:36,830
王八蛋
NICKY: Motherfucker.

2530
02:31:37,710 --> 02:31:41,040
-我就知道 -那我的钱呢？
-I knew it. -What about my money?

2531
02:31:42,090 --> 02:31:44,630
我现在怎么帮你拿钱？
How the fuck am I gonna get your money now?

2532
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:47,510
你还以为他会给你钱吗？ 你疯了吗？
You think he'll give you money? Are you out of your mind?

2533
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:49,460
-看看你怎么对他的 -什么？
-Look what you did to this guy. -What?

2534
02:31:49,560 --> 02:31:51,800
你只要闭上你的嘴
If you'd just kept your fucking mouth shut.

2535
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:54,640
现在有个屁用！ 我真不该淌混水的…
What's the use! I should have never got involved--

2536
02:31:58,730 --> 02:32:00,110
喂！你这浑蛋！

GINGER: No! NICKY: Get down there! Take it easy!

2540
02:32:10,080 --> 02:32:12,610
我根本不该管这疯子的！
NICKY: I shouldn't have gotten involved with this nut!

2541
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:14,870
你会杀了她，冷静点
FRANK: You'll kill her. Take it easy.

FRANK: Let's go.

2544
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:27,120
我不需要你！ 我自己会拿到我的钱！
I don't need you! I'll get my own fucking money!

2545
02:32:28,430 --> 02:32:31,130
我要去找联邦调查局！ 我不怕你了！
I'm going to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!

2546
02:32:31,260 --> 02:32:34,800
-好，自己小心 -这是你最后一次玩我！
NICKY: All right. Be careful. GINGER: You've fucked with me for the last time!

2547
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:36,480
好，好
Okay. Yeah.

2548
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:39,390

02:32:39,650 --> 02:32:41,140
走吧，进去
Come on. Get inside.

2550
02:32:42,650 --> 02:32:44,360
你瞧瞧，他妈的
Look at this. Motherfucker.

2551
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:51,480
我错了，法兰克 我这次真的搞砸了
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time.

2552
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:54,530
我真不该跟那荡妇搞的
I should never have started with this fucking broad.

2553
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:58,110
冷静点，你能怎样呢？
Take it easy. What could you do?

2554
02:32:58,250 --> 02:33:00,290
是她自己送上门的，不是吗？
FRANK: I mean, she threw herself at you, right?

2555
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:06,670
我现在身处困境了 你知道吗？
I'm in a bad fucking spot here. You know that?

2556
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:10,510
里外不是人
A bad fucking spot.

2557
02:33:26,820 --> 02:33:28,400
我将孩子给邻居托管

Put this in the hotel safe and I want you to come back.

-You'll be sorry if you don't stop. -Don't you threaten me!

2572

你无法再威胁我了！
GINGER: You're not threatening me anymore!

2573
02:34:52,740 --> 02:34:56,190
王八蛋！我受够你了！

GINGER: I don't have to take your shit anymore!

2579
02:35:11,930 --> 02:35:14,460
我要去找联邦调查局！ 我要去找警察！

他不让我进去！
GINGER: He won't let me inside!

罗斯坦先生，我们接到很多 关于噪音的抱怨
Mr. Rothstein, we've been getting some complaints about the noise.

谁知道你进去会干嘛

气死我了！别管它！
GINGER: That pisses me off! Don't worry.

2620
02:37:22,890 --> 02:37:23,890
若能…
It would be great...

2621
02:37:24,020 --> 02:37:25,600
跟我一起出去最好…
if you could follow me out of here...

2622
02:37:25,730 --> 02:37:27,470
因为他在威胁我！
because he's been threatening me!

2623
02:37:27,730 --> 02:37:29,560
保重，谢谢
Take care. Thank you.

2624
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:51,120
我真不敢相信
[Crying] I can't believe this.

2625
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:05,720
我只是需要领一些现金 你可以陪我来吗？
GINGER: I just need to pick up a little cash. Could you come with me?

2626
02:38:12,190 --> 02:38:15,400
-你得阻止她 -抱歉，山姆
SAM: You've got to stop her. CHARLIE: I'm sorry, Sam.

2627
02:38:15,610 --> 02:38:18,650
-我无能为力 -她是个毒虫，根本就疯了！
CHARLIE: What can I do? SAM: She's a junkie. She's out of her mind!

2628
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:21,070
她有钥匙，而且你们两人名字 都在户头上
She has the keys. It's still in both your names.

2629
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:23,910
我无能为力，我想要帮忙…
There's nothing I can do. I'd like to help...

2630
02:38:24,120 --> 02:38:26,080
-但我不能 -严格说，她不能拿
-but I can't. -Legally, she can't take it.

2631
02:38:26,210 --> 02:38:28,780
-她不能，一半是我的 -听我说
SAM: She can't. Half of it is mine. CHARLIE: Listen to me.

2632
02:38:28,960 --> 02:38:31,830
-我爱莫能助 -我马上到
CHARLIE: There's nothing I can do. SAM: I'm coming down.

2633
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:46,560
妈的！靠！
Shit! God damn it!

2634
02:38:48,060 --> 02:38:51,850
我需要个袋子 你可以帮我要个袋子吗？
I'll need a bag. Could you ask the guy for the big bag?

2635
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:54,020
-拿个袋吧 -拿去
COP: Go get a bag, man. GINGER: Here.

2636
02:38:54,320 --> 02:38:57,520
-小姐，我不能拿 -你可以，你对我好好
-Lady, I can't take it. -You can. You've been so nice to me.

2637
02:38:58,990 --> 02:39:02,360
好，帮我打开，好吗？ 这样我就可以…
GINGER: Yes, just hold the top open. All right? And I can....

2638
02:39:06,210 --> 02:39:08,880
天啊，是他！ 你们得阻止他
Oh, God! It's him. You have to stop him.

2639
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:10,830
因为他说他会杀了我
'Cause he said he was gonna kill me.

2640
02:39:12,670 --> 02:39:14,910
罗斯坦先生，等一下
COP: Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.

2641
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:17,460
请等一下
COP: Hold on a second.

2642
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:20,960
-她开走了 -我们不能做什么
SAM: She's driving away. COP: There's nothing we can do.

2643
02:39:21,180 --> 02:39:23,470
-我们不能做什么 -你瞧瞧
-There's nothing we can do. -Look, look.

2644
02:39:23,770 --> 02:39:26,800
你们不能抓她超速吗？ 看看她开多快
You can't stop her for speeding? Look what she's doing.

2645
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:30,970
-我们不能做什么，她有钥匙 -她的名字在户头上
COP: Nothing we can do. She had the key. COP 2: She's on the account.

2646
02:39:31,110 --> 02:39:34,230
-我们在加油站拦她 -好的，就这么办
-Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station. -Okay. Let's do it.

2647
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:48,660
-我们必须逮捕你 -为了什么？
-We're placing you under arrest. -For what?

2648
02:39:48,790 --> 02:39:51,750
-为了协助犯罪… -为了什么？
-For aiding and abetting-- -For what?

2649
02:39:52,040 --> 02:39:55,330
-为了协助犯罪… -我只是要离开
-For aiding and abetting-- -I'm just trying to leave.

2650
02:39:55,590 --> 02:39:57,550
在这么多威胁之后…
SAM: After all the threats and bullshit...

2651
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,710
金吉儿什么都没告诉他们
it turned out Ginger didn't tell them anything.

2652
02:39:59,800 --> 02:40:02,840
但那时，他们也不需要她了
But, by then, the Feds didn't need her anyway.

2653
02:40:03,430 --> 02:40:06,390
-他们已有足够的证据 -但我什么都没做
They had all the pieces they needed. But I didn't do anything.

2654
02:40:06,520 --> 02:40:11,310
-大家就像牌九一样跟着倒 -联邦调查局！我们有拘捕令！
SAM: Everyone began to tumble, like dominoes. FBI! We have a warrant!

2655
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:14,270
不管是窃听器上派斯康的抱怨…
SAM: Between Piscano complaining on the wire...

2656
02:40:14,400 --> 02:40:17,440
还是尼奇、我与我的执照…
between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...

2657
02:40:17,740 --> 02:40:21,440
天堂就这样被我们搞砸了
paradise. We managed to really fuck it up.

2658
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:24,820
-妈 -门口他妈的有人
NICKY JR.: Mom. JENNIFER: Someone's at the door now.

2659
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:27,110
联邦调查局，我们有搜查令
FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

2660
02:40:27,250 --> 02:40:30,280
我马上知道苗头不对 所以我跑路了
NICKY: I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.

2661
02:40:30,420 --> 02:40:32,330
谁要待在那儿找麻烦啊？
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?

2662
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:34,580
-我是马克凯斯伯，FBI -是吗？
-I'm Mark Casper, FBI. -Yeah?

2663
02:40:34,750 --> 02:40:36,300
我可以打个电话吗？
Can I make a fucking phone call?

2664
02:40:36,420 --> 02:40:38,910
可以，但你不用这样对我们讲话
Yes, but you don't have to talk to us like that.

2665
02:40:39,010 --> 02:40:42,010
大家都出去 往警铃的方向走
FBI AGENT: Everybody, out of the room. Over to the alarm.

2666
02:40:42,100 --> 02:40:45,550
-其他人似乎都被抓了 -这地方被查封了！
NICKY: They got almost everybody else. FBI AGENT: This area is seized!

2667
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:49,470
-去拿总户头单 -我要查封所有的文件
-Get the master account list. -I want all those papers seized.

2668
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:55,560
将每个箱子都放到桌上
FBI AGENT: Put every box on the table.

2669
02:41:02,490 --> 02:41:05,530
好，在这儿，所有的数字
Yes. Here we are. Little craps figures.

2670
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:07,790
葛林？别提了
SAM: Green? Don't even ask.

2671
02:41:07,870 --> 02:41:10,620
-你的三万元 -不，所以不成立
-...$30,000 of yours. -No. That's why it wasn't valid.

2672
02:41:10,750 --> 02:41:13,950
我是被敲诈的 你们想知道什么就问我
I was being extorted. I'll tell you what you want to know.

2673
02:41:14,090 --> 02:41:16,120
-我不需要隐藏 -最经典的是
PHlLlP: I've got nothing to hide. NICKY: Now for the best.

2674
02:41:16,210 --> 02:41:20,590
我不敢相信派斯康的花费记录 竟然成了关键
I couldn't believe this shit. Piscano's expense reports took the cake.

2675
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:24,090
-这太好了 -他干脆就把蓝图给他们算了
Oh, this is good. NICKY: He might as well give them a blueprint.

2676
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:27,380
所有人的名字、地址、日期 一切都在上面
Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.

2677
02:41:27,810 --> 02:41:31,180
真是多谢你了，派斯康先生 你真是体帖
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano. How considerate of you.

2678
02:41:31,310 --> 02:41:34,060
-那是我妈的账目 -你被逮捕了
-Those are my mother's books. -You're under arrest.

2679
02:41:34,150 --> 02:41:36,640
-真是个蠢才 -你在干嘛？
NICKY: What a fucking balloon head. ARTIE: What are you doing?

2680
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:38,900
-冷静点 -等一下！
AGENT: Take it easy. WIFE: Wait!

2681
02:41:39,110 --> 02:41:40,980
-等一下，他有病！ -走开
WIFE: Wait! He's sick! COP: Move back.

2682
02:41:41,240 --> 02:41:43,360
-是心脏，还呼吸吗？ -快人工呼吸！
WIFE: It's his heart! Is he breathing? COP 2: CPR now!

2683
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:45,690
艾提被搞到心脏病发…
SAM: Artie got so upset he had a heart attack...

2684
02:41:45,830 --> 02:41:47,900
当他老婆的面就挂了
and dropped dead right in front of his wife.

2685
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:50,120
-冷静点！ -我无法冷静！
-Calm down! -No, I won't calm down!

2686
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:52,410
-他是我丈夫，艾提！ -我们也不能…
-He's my husband! Artie! -We can't help him if--

2687
02:41:56,380 --> 02:41:57,710
最后…
SAM: At the end of the day...

2688
02:41:57,840 --> 02:42:00,290
他们终于拿照片来给我看
they finally came to see me with the pictures.

2689
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:02,960
为什么要保护一个背叛你的朋友？
FBI AGENT: Why protect a friend who betrayed you?

2690
02:42:03,090 --> 02:42:04,970
但我并不想看它们…
SAM: But I didn't want to look at them...

2691
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:06,550
或是拿照片来的人
or the guys who brought them.

2692
02:42:10,270 --> 02:42:11,510
大人，你可看见，
COUNSELOR: Your Honor, as you can see,

2693
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:13,680
我的客户们 都年事已大并生病
my clients are elderly and infirm.

2694
02:42:13,850 --> 02:42:16,940
任何的刑责都将会 严重威胁到他们的健康
COUNSELOR: Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.

2695
02:42:17,110 --> 02:42:19,310
当老大们被逮时 有些简直老到…
NICKY: When they were arrested, some were so old...

2696
02:42:19,440 --> 02:42:21,230
罪状认否程序时都需要医师
they needed doctors at their arraignment.

2697
02:42:21,360 --> 02:42:24,450
预审时建议将保释金额 维持现额
COUNSELOR: Pre-trial services recommends that bail remain as set.

2698
02:42:24,530 --> 02:42:27,150
-现在休庭 -当情况看来他们似乎…
JUDGE: Take recess. NICKY: When it looked like they'd get...

2699
02:42:27,330 --> 02:42:30,280
得为了抽头而关上25年时…
25 years to life in prison just for skimming a casino...

2700
02:42:30,370 --> 02:42:33,570
不管有病没病 总有人要倒霉
sick or no fucking sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.

2701
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,320
所以在罪状认否程序那天
So the day of the arraignment,

2702
02:42:36,620 --> 02:42:39,130
他们在法庭后头开会
they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse.

2703
02:42:39,340 --> 02:42:41,380
当类似的事发生时
When something like this happens,

2704
02:42:41,380 --> 02:42:43,420
你已知道事情会怎样
you know how things are gonna work out.

2705
02:42:43,550 --> 02:42:47,840
最好是不要有目击者 那安迪呢？
It's always better with no witnesses. So what about Andy?

2706
02:42:47,930 --> 02:42:50,770
他不会说的，史东是好家伙
He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

2707
02:42:51,060 --> 02:42:53,020
跟他老爸一样带种
Stand-up guy just like his old man.

2708
02:42:53,480 --> 02:42:54,970
我是这么想的
That's the way I see it.

2709
02:42:55,230 --> 02:42:58,600
我同意，他很强悍
I agree. He's solid. He's a fucking Marine.

2710
02:42:59,360 --> 02:43:03,310
他没问题，一直都是 你说呢？
He's okay. He always was. What do you think?

2711
02:43:05,160 --> 02:43:08,900
为什么要冒险呢？
Look, why take a chance?

2712
02:43:11,290 --> 02:43:13,330
我是这么想的啦
At least that's the way I feel about it.

2713
02:43:14,250 --> 02:43:17,450
打给艾提，告诉他不管怎样…
ANDY: Call Artie. Tell him I don't care what...

2714
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:19,620
他星期四都得来我办公室
he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning.

2715
02:43:19,750 --> 02:43:20,750
决定了
It's done.

2716
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:23,830
非常重要 我一定得跟他谈谈
It's terribly important. I gotta have a conversation with him.

2717
02:43:32,140 --> 02:43:34,810
不管他们多喜欢他 他还不是家族一员
NICKY: As much as they liked him, he wasn't one of us.

2718
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:38,190
他不是意大利人 对他们来说，他随时可能供出来
He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew, he could have talked.

2719
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:40,560
要不然他可能还活着
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

2720
02:43:41,610 --> 02:43:44,400
哥斯大黎加

2721
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:47,440
第一个翘头的就是约翰南斯
The first one to skip was John Nance.

2722
02:43:47,570 --> 02:43:50,610
他在哥斯大黎加 找了个又好又隐密的地方
He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.

2723
02:43:50,830 --> 02:43:52,900
他以为没人找得到他
He thought nobody would find him there.

2724
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:17,100
但他孩子随后因犯毒 被联邦调查局逮了
NICKY: But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.

2725
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:20,310
老大们当然怕他会出现…
So naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding...

2726
02:44:20,440 --> 02:44:22,650
为了救孩子而把大家供出来
just to save his kid and give them all up.

2727
02:44:23,570 --> 02:44:24,680
所以…
So....

2728
02:44:27,570 --> 02:44:29,230
你想去哪里？
Where you going, jag-off?

2729
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:33,440
但大家都得跟着
NICKY: But, anyway, they all had to follow.

2730
02:44:33,540 --> 02:44:35,000
大家都完了
Everybody went down.

2731
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:36,360
去你的
Fuck you.

2732
02:44:42,050 --> 02:44:43,240
不知不觉…
NICKY: Before you knew it...

2733
02:44:43,340 --> 02:44:45,790
任何知道一点小事的人 都被干掉了
anybody who knew anything wound up getting whacked.

2734
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:56,100
不！不！
GINGER: Oh, no! No!

2735
02:45:02,070 --> 02:45:04,600
金吉儿走后 她对任何人都没什么用
SAM: After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.

2736
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:08,440
她在洛杉矶结识了一些 皮条客、败类、毒虫与飞车党
She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies, and bikers in L.A.

2737
02:45:08,740 --> 02:45:11,690
几个月内，他们就把 所有的钱跟珠宝花光了
In a few months, they went through all the money and jewels.

2738
02:45:38,140 --> 02:45:39,720
当他们找到遗体时…
After they found her body...

2739
02:45:40,560 --> 02:45:42,850
我私下请了个医生验尸
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.

2740
02:45:46,610 --> 02:45:48,980
他说他们给她打了过量的毒品
He said they gave her a hot dose.

2741
02:45:49,490 --> 02:45:54,400
最终，她身上只剩下 价值三千六百元的全新硬币
In the end, all she had left was $3, 600 in mint condition coins.

2742
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:19,760
不管条子与文件 对我的汽车炸弹有什么评论…
No matter what the Feds or the papers said about my car bombing...

2743
02:46:21,690 --> 02:46:23,730
一看就知道是新手干的
it was amateur night, you could tell.

2744
02:46:23,940 --> 02:46:27,610
不管是谁，他们将炸弹装在 副驾驶座下面
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.

2745
02:46:27,740 --> 02:46:31,350
他们不知道的是 除了车厂外没人知道的是…
But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew...

2746
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:35,870
那台车的驾驶座下 多加了一块铁板
was that, that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.

2747
02:46:36,870 --> 02:46:38,990
全靠了它救我一命
It's the only thing that saved my life.

2748
02:46:51,760 --> 02:46:55,970
那炸弹从没被批准 但我想我知道是谁干的
The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.

2749
02:46:57,390 --> 02:46:59,220
老大们也知道吧
So did the powers that be.

2750
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:01,140
-你好吗？ -你好吗？
NICKY: How are you? BOSS: How you doing?

2751
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:03,300
好几个月后一切才平息
NICKY: It took months for everything to calm down.

2752
02:47:03,560 --> 02:47:05,890
但我的人终于保释出来了
But finally, my guys got out on bail.

2753
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:09,520
老大们要我将我小弟 多明尼送回赌城
The bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.

2754
02:47:09,650 --> 02:47:12,690
永远都是为了钱
Always the fucking dollars.

2755
02:47:13,070 --> 02:47:16,610
我是说，我连赌城都不能踏入
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go near Vegas.

2756
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:19,370
所以我在个鸟不生蛋的地方 安排大家碰面
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.

2757
02:47:19,500 --> 02:47:22,700
我不想害我小弟 对的就是对的
I didn't want my brother to get fucked around. What's right is right.

2758
02:47:22,830 --> 02:47:24,460
他们才不在乎…
They don't give a fuck about--

2759
02:47:26,050 --> 02:47:27,670
去你妈的…
THUG: Holy fucking....

2760
02:47:28,510 --> 02:47:29,790
搞什么…
NICKY: What the fuck....

2761
02:47:29,920 --> 02:47:31,800
来啊，王八蛋！
Come on, motherfucker!

2762
02:47:32,970 --> 02:47:35,970
不是很猛吗？你跟你哥！
Tough guys! You and your fucking brother!

2763
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:39,350
你们两个浑蛋！够了！
You fucking scumbags! No more!

2764
02:47:42,310 --> 02:47:45,930
-法兰克！ -够了！你看着！
-Frankie! -No more! You see? Watch!

2765
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:52,600
-法兰克！你这王八蛋！ -去你的！
NICKY: Frankie! You piece of shit! FRANK: Fuck you!

2766
02:47:53,490 --> 02:47:56,910
王八羔子！狗杂种！
NICKY: Fucking punk! Piece of shit!

2767
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:01,580
不！
No!

2768
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:03,870
把这浑蛋拖走！
Take this motherfucker out!

2769
02:48:11,550 --> 02:48:14,250
别搞他了，他还活着

2770
02:48:14,640 --> 02:48:17,760
他还在呼吸 别搞他了，法兰克
He's still breathing. Leave him alone. Frankie.

2771
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:24,890
好了，脱他衣服
FRANK: All right. Strip him.

2772
02:48:25,690 --> 02:48:28,560
没种，你真他妈的没种
NICKY: No balls. You got no fucking balls.

2773
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:30,780
多明尼！
Oh, Dominick!

2774
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:39,830
多明尼
NICKY: Dominick.

2775
02:49:03,640 --> 02:49:04,890
来吧
FRANK: Come on.

2776
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:09,770
-埋了他们？ -埋
THUG: Bury them? FRANK: Bury them.

2777
02:49:13,400 --> 02:49:14,440
话放出去了
SAM: The word was out.

2778
02:49:14,530 --> 02:49:17,150
老大们受够了尼奇 受够了
The bosses had enough of Nicky. They had enough.

2779
02:49:17,450 --> 02:49:22,030
他们还能忍受多久呢？ 所以拿他们兄弟俩杀鸡儆猴
How much were they gonna take? So they made an example of him and his brother.

2780
02:49:23,160 --> 02:49:25,540
他们俩被活埋
They buried them while they were still breathing.

2781
02:49:43,180 --> 02:49:45,220
你还好吗？小心！
MAN: You all right? Watch out!

2782
02:49:50,860 --> 02:49:53,100
-先生，你没事吧？ -没事
MAN: Mister, you all right? SAM: Yeah.

2783
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:56,560
他们有别的事给我做
SAM: They had other ideas for me.

2784
02:50:06,620 --> 02:50:08,500
我们这儿需要帮忙！
MEDIC: We need some help over here!

2785
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:11,700
你真是幸运
MEDIC 2: You sure are lucky, mister.

2786
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:32,430
这城市再也不一样了
SAM: The town will never be the same.

2787
02:50:33,150 --> 02:50:36,900
在坦吉乐之后，大集团全权掌管
After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.

2788
02:50:37,820 --> 02:50:39,450
今日的赌城像是迪斯奈乐园
Today it looks like Disneyland.

2789
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:49,710
孩子们玩着海盗游戏时…
While the kids play cardboard pirates...

2790
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:53,200
爸爸与妈妈将房贷与大学学费…
Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and junior's college money...

2791
02:50:53,340 --> 02:50:55,080
浪费在吃角子老虎机
on the poker slots.

2792
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:02,960
想当年，庄家知道你的名字 喝什么酒，玩什么牌
In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.

2793
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:05,100
今天就像是在机场登记一般
Today, it's like checking into an airport.

2794
02:51:05,270 --> 02:51:08,470
你要是叫客房送餐 星期四给你送到就了不起了
If you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.

2795
02:51:09,810 --> 02:51:13,180
都没了，一个人拎着 装着四百万的皮箱…
Today it's all gone. A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase...

2796
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:17,650
就有个25岁的旅游系大学毕业生 想要他的身份字号
and some 25-year-old hotel school kid will want his Social Security number.

2797
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:21,900
全美卡车司机工会离开后…
After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box...

2798
02:51:21,990 --> 02:51:25,410
大集团几乎将所有的旧赌场都拆了
the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.

2799
02:51:26,330 --> 02:51:29,200
而盖新金字塔的钱是从哪来的呢？
And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids?

2800
02:51:30,250 --> 02:51:31,750
垃圾债券
Junk bonds.

2801
02:51:33,210 --> 02:51:35,790
圣地牙哥

2802
02:51:37,220 --> 02:51:38,760
还不确定？
SAM: Still not sure?

2803
02:51:39,430 --> 02:51:41,300
有可能，有些质疑
SAM: Probable. Maybe questionable.

2804
02:51:41,390 --> 02:51:43,880
好吧，知道后立即通知我
SAM: All right, let me know as soon as you can find out.

2805
02:51:45,270 --> 02:51:48,390
最后，我又回到了起点
SAM: In the end, I wound up right back where I started.

2806
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:50,270
我还是会选赢家…
I could still pick winners...

2807
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:53,680
也还是可以为老家 各式各样的人赚钱
and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.

2808
02:51:53,860 --> 02:51:55,480
何必搞砸好事呢？
And why mess up a good thing?

2809
02:51:56,950 --> 02:51:58,570
就是这样！
And that's that!
