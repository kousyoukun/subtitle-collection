152
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,300
All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler...

153
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,200
who barely had
enough gas money...

154
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,400
to come and pick up
his own fuckin` check.

155
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,300
And of course it was
the bosses` man...

156
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,200
Andy Stone,
who gave all the orders.

157
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Not the chairman
of the fuckin` board, Philip Green.

158
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,700
I understand.
I understand.

159
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
Now all they needed was...

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,900
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

161
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,200
And who better than Ace? I mean, he was
already in Vegas a couple years...

162
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
and he had
the fuckin` place clocked.

163
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,700
But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin` a casino...

164
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,100
and he tries
to talk you out of it.

165
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,400
I don`t know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

166
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,100
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

167
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

168
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,200
You don`t have to have a license
to work in a casino.

169
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,200
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

170
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
The state law says that
you can work in a casino...

171
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
while they`re processing
your application.

172
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,400
They got a ten-year backlog.

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,300
What happens when
they do find out?

174
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,300
Why would they
want to find out?

175
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,200
We`re puttin` a hundred million
into this desert.
Why would they want to lock us out?

176
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,100
They`ll never find out. All you gotta do
is keep changing your job title.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,600
Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

178
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,600
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

179
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,700
I know guys been workin` there
for 30 years, don`t have a license.

180
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,000
It`s a tough proposition, Andy.

181
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
You know if I did it,
I`d have to run it my way.

182
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,600
You got it.

183
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,200
I`m serious, no interference.

184
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,500
Nobody`s gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

185
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,700
I guarantee it.

186
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,100
[ Nicky ] And that`s how
they got Ace to take over.

187
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,900
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

188
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,700
They worked out
a real cute job title too...

189
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,600
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

190
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,900
But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

191
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,300
He made his first bet when he was
15 years old, and he always made money.

192
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,700
But he didn`t bet
like you or me.

193
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,400
You know, havin` some fun
with it, shit like that.

194
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,400
Where the hell
did you learn how to deal?

195
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,100
He bet like a fuckin`
brain surgeon.

196
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,300
Place the checks properly.

197
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,100
- That`s the way you do it.
- Yes, sir.

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
He had to know everything,
this guy.

199
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,100
He`d find out the kind
of inside stuff nobody else knew...

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,800
and that`s what he`d put
his money on.

201
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,600
Even back home, years ago...

202
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,500
when we were first hangin` out...

203
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,100
he`d know if the quarterback
was on coke...

204
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,800
I`ll take Columbia for 20.

205
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,900
- if his girlfriend was knocked up.
- Twenty dimes on Columbia.

206
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,200
He`d get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

207
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
He even figured out
the different bounce...

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,900
you got off the different kinds
of wood they used...

209
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,800
on college basketball courts,
you know?

210
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
He`d be workin`
on this shit day and night.

211
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,000
There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn`t know.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,400
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

213
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,100
Season after season...

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,700
the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

215
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
But he was so serious
about it all...

216
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,900
that I don`t think
he ever enjoyed himself.

217
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
But that`s just the way he was.

218
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,600
But back then, the bosses
didn`t give a fuck...

219
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,700
about whether
he enjoyed himself or not.

220
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,600
To them, he was
a cash register.

221
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,200
All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

222
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,900
Especially Remo...

223
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,300
who was a fuckin` degenerate
gambler who always lost...

224
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,200
Cazzo!
[ Mumbles in Italian ]

225
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,700
All those fuckin` sweeps.

226
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,700
- unless Ace made his bets.
- Enough now!

227
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

228
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,700
than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

229
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,100
Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

230
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,800
I mean, fixed fights,
doped horses...

231
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,000
crooked fuckin` zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

232
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
He told fuckin` Remo everything.

233
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,000
And to tell you the truth,
I don`t blame him.

234
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,100
- Hey!
- Keepin` Remo happy with money...

235
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,300
was the greatest insurance
policy in the world.

236
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Son of a bitch!

237
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
How the hell did you get
Oklahoma-Michigan?

238
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,500
Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi--
How the hell`d you do it?

239
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,400
Well, that`s why
they paid so well.

240
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
You see?
Never tells me nothin`.

241
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,600
What do we got on
for next week?

242
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Well, it`s a little too early.
I`d say Thursday would be good.
ls that all right?

243
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,300
- Okay, you`ll come by the house?
- I`ll come by.

244
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,300
7:00. Good job, my boy.
Keep it up? Okay, Ace?

245
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,400
Hey, Nick. Vien acca.

246
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,600
- I`ll be right out.
- T`aggia parla.

247
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,500
He`s makin`
a lot of money for us.

249
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,700
And he`s gonna continue makin` a lot of
money for us, so keep a good eye on him.

250
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,400
Not like your fuckin` friends
out there that-- without brains.

251
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,600
- Okay?
- All right.

252
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,500
- Mi raccomando.
- Yeah. Want me to take this for you?

253
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
[ Nicky ] So now,
on top of everything else...

254
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,100
I gotta make sure nobody fucks around
with the golden Jew.

255
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,700
Chase, couple of shooters
for the ladies.

256

[ Ace ]
Yeah, we made a great pair.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,600
I made book and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

258
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,700
The old men loved us,
and why not?

259
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
- They all made money with us.
- They payin`?

260
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,900
- How did Nicky collect?
- They pay every week,
like they`re supposed to.

261
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,300
- Don`t ask.
- And where the fuck is the money?
I don`t see any money.

262
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,600
- Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
- Hi, Sam.

Who`s this guy?

264
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
- Get the fuck out of here.
It was nine. I laid nine.
- It was eight.

265
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Ace, tell him the line
on the Bear game.

266
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,400
- Eight.
- lf he don`t know, nobody knows.

267
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,200
- Told you it was eight.
- How come I laid nine?

268
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
`Cause you`re a jag-off.

- ls this yours? Your pen?
- Yeah, that`s my pen. Why?

271
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,500
No, it`s a nice pen.
I just didn`t know whose it was.

272
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,500
I thought it was yours.
I didn`t want it to get lost.

273
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,900
Well, thank you.
Why don`t you take that fuckin` pen...

274
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,400
and shove it up your ass,
you fuckin` jag-off.

What`s that?
You hear a little girl, Frankie?

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Hear a little girl, Ace?
ls that a little fuckin` girl?

281
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,900
What happened
to the fuckin` tough guy...

282
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,000
- told my friend to stick it
up his fuckin` ass?

284
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,500
[ Ace ] While I was trying
to figure out why the guy was saying...

285
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,200
what he was saying,
Nicky just hit him.

286
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,500
No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

287
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

288
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,300
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

289
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,700
And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him...

290
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,500
because he`ll keep coming
back and back...

291
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,800
until one of you is dead.

292
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,000
[ Nicky ] Listen,
with me protectin` Ace...

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,800
he made a fortune
for the bosses.

294
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,900
I mean, that`s
what got him to Vegas.

295
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,800
He was a money machine.

296
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,500
A tremendous earner
for these guys.

297
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fuckin` drop.

298
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,100
With Ace, the casino
never saw so much money.

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And the bosses,
they couldn`t be happier.

00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
÷ I got $700 ÷

301
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,800
÷ Don`t you mess with me ÷

302
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,800
÷ But you know I`m down ÷

303
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,500
÷ Everybody knows I`m down ÷÷

304
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,000
[ Ace ] In Vegas, I had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

305
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

306
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,200
I mean, without us, these guys,
they`d still be shoveling mule shit.

307
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,000
Ward, you`ve got to keep
a cleaner space.

308
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,200
lf you need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

309
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,100
Won`t happen again, Sam.

310
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,600
- Mr. Rothstein.
- Mr. Rothstein. Won`t
happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

311
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
ls this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what? What`s the story?

312
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,900
- You need this guy.
- Can`t get rid of him?

313
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,400
He`s juiced in.
He`s the County Commissioner`s cousin.

314
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I wouldn`t give the bum
a mop job.

315
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,900
But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

316
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
These yokels ran the state.

317
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
Thank you very much,
Senator.

318
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
- They passed the laws,
they owned the courts.
- Hi, Ace. Hey, I need a room.

319
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,100
- I had dozens of politicians
and state officials...
- The Cedar Room.

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
coming through that place
every week.

321
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,900
- Help the Senator,
get him whatever he wants.
- Certainly.

322
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Why not make him happy?

323
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,900
...the Presidential Suite.

324
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,000
For politicians like our State Senator
up there, everything was on the house.

325
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,600
These guys won their comp life
when they got elected...

326
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,900
so, hey, why not
take advantage of it.

327
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,400
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

328
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,700
It`s a whale
like K.K. Ichikawa...

329
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,500
who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat...

330
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
that`s the one
you really gotta watch.

331
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,900
He plays fast and big
and he has the cash and the credit...

332
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,800
to turn out your lights.

333
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,700
About a year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman lslands.

334
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Downstairs he takes us
for two million...

335
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,800
and upstairs he takes free
soap, shampoo and towels.

336
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,400
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

337
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,400
free private jets and
two million of our money.

338
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,700
But we got him back.

339
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,200
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

340
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,300
I don`t know what the hell went wrong.
I`m awfully sorry.

341
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,400
I can`t understand it. These mechanical
things, you know they happen.

342
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,000
Hey, but better here than
up there, you know what I mean.

343
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,400
Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

344
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
I can`t believe that there`s
a convention; there`s no room.

345
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,600
We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

346
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,600
- I`m sorry you missed your plane.
- Glad to get to know you.

347
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,800
Oh, no. No gambling.

348
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,300
And once he was back,
he played small.

349
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,100
He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

350
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
...to the bank
with a natural lead over a five.

351
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,100
But I knew the trick
with whales like lchikawa...

352
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,900
was that they can`t bet
small for long.

353
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,800
He didn`t think of it
as winning 10,000...

354
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,100
he thought of it
as losing 90,000.

355
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,000
So, he upped his bets.

356
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up a million of his own cash.

357
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,000
In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

358
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,100
and keep them coming back.

359
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,400
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

360
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,700
In the end, we get it all.

361
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,600
÷ Goddamn it
Trying to make it real ÷

362
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
÷ Compared to what ÷

363
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
÷ Sock it to me ÷

364
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,300
In Vegas, everybody`s
gotta watch everybody else.

365
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,500
Six. All right,
who`s gonna give me that?

366
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,400
Since the players are looking
to beat the casino...

367
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,100
Each and every roll,
all right.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
- the dealers are watching
the players...
- Six.

369
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,600
- Fake a six.
- the boxmen are watching the dealers.

370
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,400
the floormen are watching
the boxmen...

371
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,100
the pit bosses are watching
the floormen...

372
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,900
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

373
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,700
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

374
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
I`m watching the casino manager...

375
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,000
and the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

376
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,100
Plus, we had
a dozen guys up there...

377
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,500
most of them ex-cheats, who knew
every trick in the house.

378
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,500
÷ Tryin` to make it real
compared to what ÷

379
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,700
Yes!

380
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,600
- Very nice.
- I told you I was hot tonight.

381
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Lookin` good.
Lookin` good.

382
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Let`s go.
This is for Ginger. Come on.

383
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Let me have a hundred
on your hard ten.

384
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Hundred on your hard ten.
Thank you.

385
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,200
Here we go now.
Yeeeow!

386
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,300
- Oh, I`m sorry.
- The dice--

387
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,200
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

388
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,600
- Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.
- You were great.

389
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Thanks. Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

390
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,800
This hundred is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

391
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,400
- Come on.
- What`s the matter?

392
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,000
What do you mean? I made a lot
of money for you, I want my cut.

393
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,000
What money? I`ve seen
you stealing from me.

394
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,900
What money?
Look at the stack of chips.

395
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,100
- I want my half.
- I`ve been watching you all night.

396
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,500
- I want my money.
- Your bag is full of fucking chips.

397
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,200
- I didn`t steal anything from you.
- Get lost!

398
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,800
Get lost? Get lost?
Yes! Yes!

399
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,400
- Well, how about that?
- Come on!

400
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,600
÷ Slippin` and a-slidin` ÷
Changin` and a-hidin` ÷

401
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,900

÷ You`re the one ÷

407
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,900
[ Ace ] What a move.

408
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,800
I fell in love right there.

409
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,900
But in Vegas, for a girl
like Ginger, love costs money.

410
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,700
÷ What`s different about him ÷

411
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,300
÷ I don`t really know ÷

412
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300

÷ No matter how I try ÷

414
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,900
÷ I just can`t make him cry ÷

415
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,700
- [ Ace ] Ginger`s mission
in life was money.
- I`ll be right back.

416
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,500
- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

417
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,200
She was a queen
around the casino.

418
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,000
She brought in high rollers...

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,100
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

420
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,200
- Hello.
- Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

421
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
Great, and I have something for you.
You got me covered?

422
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,400
- And you do. Thank you very much.
- Take care of yourself.

423
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,000
- I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.
- Oh, yeah.

424
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,400
Who didn`t want Ginger?
She was one of the best known...

425
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,600
best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

426
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,800
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

427
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,900
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

428
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,000
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

429
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,700
÷ You only make me glad ÷

430
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,700
÷ Better listen, little girl ÷

431
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,300
÷ You`re goin` walkin`
down the street ÷

432
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,900
÷ I ain`t got no love ÷

433
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,400
Any change?

434
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,200
Oh, I hit a few games
on the way back.

435
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,800
But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

436
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,200
÷ This heart of stone ÷

437
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
- How you doin` tonight?
- Good.

438
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,700
- How are you?
- Uh, beat.

439
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,200
- [ Ace ] Ginger had the hustlers code.
- Take one for you.

440
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,200
- Thank you.
- She knew how to take care of people.

441
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,700
And that`s what Vegas
is all about.

442
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,500
- Sixty-eight hundred.
- Thanks.

443
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,900
- It`s kickback city.
- Have a good night.

444
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,700
Thank you. You too.

445
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
- She took care of the dealers...
- Hey, Mitch.

446
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,400
pit bosses, floor managers...

447
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,300
but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers...

448
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,800
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

449
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,500
Ginger took care of the parkers...

450
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,600
because they took care
of the security guards...

451
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,200
- who took care of the metro cops,
who let her operate.
- I need that stuff tonight.

452
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,400
- No problem.
- You are a doll.

453
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,200
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

454
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,900
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

455
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,500
But one thing
I just could never understand...

456
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,900
was that she could have
everything under control...

457
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,000
except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

458
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,000
Gin, you know I got other people
in this, they got partners.

459
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,000
I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you...

460
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,900
in this thing, okay?

461
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,200
You`re gonna get yours back,
and you`re gonna get back first, okay?

462
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,500
- All right, yeah.
- Where you going?

463
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,700
Where are you? You`re
in that place. Where are you?

464
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
- I`m here.
- No, you`re not.

465
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,100
Where are you?
Where are you?

466
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,700
I`m always here for you.

467
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,600
- You`re my woman.
- I know.

468
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,500
[ Ace ] The Ginger I knew wouldn`t
even look at this creep.

469
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

470
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,300
He was a moocher,
a card cheat...

471
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,000
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag.

472
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,600
- Chasing dentists for a few bucks.
- Careful.

473
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,000
The guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

474
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,500
And somehow she could never
turn him down.

475
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,300
The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

476
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,300
Somebody had
to take care of him.

477
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,400
But nobody
had to take care of Nicky.

478
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,100
lf you find any cash in there,
we`ll whack it up with you.

479
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,000
I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

480
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,700
- That`s why every badge...
- I folded these things beautifully.

481
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
- back home wanted to nail him.
- I would appreciate a little respect.

482
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,500
- Look at me, pal,
I gotta live with her.
- Jesus Christ.

483
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,400
÷ Volare ÷

484
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,300
Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

485
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,900
I mean, Frank Marino was there
to meet him, but so were the cops.

486
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,100
This time they wanted
to pinch him...

487
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,200
- for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
- Will you help me fold these?

488
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,300
They were ready to blame him for
anything, no matter where it happened.

489
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,500
- Put your things away.
- And they were usually right.

490
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,100
- Hold it, hold it. Here.
- Because Nicky enjoyed
being a gangster.

491
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,200
- And he didn`t give a damn who knew it.
- Come on, there we go.

492
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,800
Look at this. Beautiful!

493
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,000
I mean, that`s what worried me.
`Cause it turns out,
Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

494
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,800
- All right, we`re clear.
- There`s more.

495
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,900
There`s a couple stuck in there.
I know there`s more.

496
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:36,000
- I`m telling you, they`re out!
- Come on.

497
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,500
Don`t get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

498
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,500
What`s that?
Huh, what`s that?

499
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,100
There`s no more.
Thanks, hon.

500
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,000
[ Nicky ] I couldn`t wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

501
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,200
But the bosses didn`t send me
out there to have a good time.

502
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,600
They sent me out there to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

503
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,500
And nobody interfered
with the fuckin` skim.

504
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,400
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin`?

505
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,300
Hey, Sammy.

506
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,500
- Boy, look at this place, huh?
- lncredible.

507
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,600
Welcome to Vegas.

508
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
- Okay, Sammy.
- Something, huh?

509
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,800
Ginger.

510
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,100
Holy shit. What`ve you
been doing out here?

511
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,800
Honey, come here.

512
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
This is Jennifer and Nick,
they`re dear friends of mine.

513
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,100
- Hi, Jennifer.
- A pleasure.

514
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Okay, Sammy.

515
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,900
[ Ace ] After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone...

516
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,100
and we took a ride to talk.

517
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,100
And then, he hit me with it.

518
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,800
What do you think about me
moving out here?

519
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,100
What`s the matter?
You got a problem with that?

520
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,200
- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

521
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,900
Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you...

522
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,700
it`s no joke out here,
it`s no joke.

523
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,900
You gotta keep a low profile.

524
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,700
It`s not like back home. Right off
the bat, they don`t like guys like us.

525
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,000
And this sheriff`s
a real cowboy.

526
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Even the coppers aren`t afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

527
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,400
I don`t care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

528
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,300
I`m tired of that shit
back there.

529
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
Look at this place.
It`s made of money.

530
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,700
You know what the best part is?
Nobody`s gonna know what we`re doing.

531
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,500
There`s nobody here to see us.
Everybody`s back home.

532
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,600
Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

533
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
I really gotta be careful.

534
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,600
I`m running a licensed place,
everything`s legit.

535
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,300
Don`t worry about it.
I`m not gonna do anything.

536
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,400
I`m especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

537
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,000
[ Nicky ]
Ace saw Vegas one way...

538
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,100
- You call this guy
and tell him I`m comin`?
- Of course.

539
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,900
but I saw it another.

540
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,100
I saw it as untouched.

541
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,000
I mean, they had bookies, pimps...

542
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,200
and drug dealers
I could shake down.

543
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
Who the fuck
were they gonna run to?

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,900
So I started gettin`
everybody in line.

545
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,600
Best of all,
for the first time in my life...

546
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,100
I figured out a way
not to lose.

547
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,300
[ Ace ] Yeah, he had
a foolproof scheme, all right.

548
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
It wasn`t very scientific,
but it worked.

549
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
When he won, he collected;

550
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,700
when he lost, he told the bookies
to go fuck themselves.

551
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,100
What were they gonna do,
muscle Nicky?

552
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,600
- Hey, how you doin`?
- How you doin`?

553
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,800
- You got that thing for me?
- What thing?

554
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,900
Oh, Nicky. I thought
you was layin`.

555
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,600
No, no, I`m takin`.
I was takin`.

556
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,600
- You sure?
- I`m positive.

557
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,400
- I`m a little confused.
- You`re a little confused?

558
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,800
Maybe if I stick your fuckin`
face through this window...

559
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,800
you`ll get unconfused.

560
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,700
- Gimme the fuckin` money.
- I`m sorry, Nick.

561
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,600
I didn`t mean anything by it.

562
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,300
That`s why you had it ready.
You thought I was fuckin` layin` it?

563
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,800
- My fuckin` head.
- Smarten up.

564
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,500
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first president.

565
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,100
George Washington was born--

566
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,900
[ Ace ] But still,
it was nice and quiet for a while.

567
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,400
Ginger and I presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town...

568
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,700
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

569
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,500
Beautiful, you got
a beautiful swing.

570
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
[ Nicky ] Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

571
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,800
Turned out to be one
of the other coaches...

572
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,900
was a fuckin`
metro intelligence cop.

573
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,900
But it didn`t matter.
It was all about the kids.

574
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,200
He`s gotta realize that everything
can`t be a home run that he does.

575
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:07,300
That`s exactly what
I keep tellin` him...

576
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,700
but that`s the kind of kid he is.

577
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,700
[ Ace ] And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

578
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,200
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work...

579
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,400
people got the message.

580
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,400
[ Nicky ] Me, that`s why
the bosses sent me out here.

581
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,900
They wanted me to make sure none
of the other crews robbed the joint.

582
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,500
Like these two fuckin`
balloon heads over here.

583
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,200
They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 fuckin` grand...

584
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,000
- yeah, right, I`m sure.
- Hey! How are you?

585
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,000
How are you?
What are you doing here?

586
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I`m over here now.

587
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,400
- You`re over here?
- Yeah, I`m over here with them.

588
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,700
We`re waiting on Carmine.

589
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,600
Yeah, we`re looking
for Carmine.

590
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,100
He was here before. He had
a suitcase and then he left.

591
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,300
- Carmine left?
- Carmine left?

592
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,100
He`s gone?

593
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,100
He`s not here?

594
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,400
Carmine`s out?

595
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,600
I think maybe he went
across the street...

596
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,800
or somewhere else
or somethin`.

597
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,300

[ Lester ]
Can you feel my eyes on you?

Can you feel me
look into your heart?

Can you feel me

I love you.

- No, Lester.
- Do you know that?

This is the best thing I can do

You just have to understand.

I`ve been with Lester

So wonderful. The jewelry`s
not so bad either.

is very important.
- Okay.

Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

No, I didn`t know that.
But you know what he did?

918
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,700
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

- Then he called me a faggot.
- What?

- Hey, come here.

This guy obviously doesn`t know
who he was talking to.

He doesn`t know that
we`re dear friends.

931
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,800
I mean, he`s already
very sorry.

932
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,500
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

933
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,700
I swear he`ll never
get out of line again.

he`s out for good.

[ Nicky ] You know,
Ace could be a very touchy guy.

945
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,900
Especially when
he got bigger in town.

946
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,000
Like when he hired
that Jonathan and David
and their tigers away from the Palace...

947
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,700
by building them a new stage
and giving them a Rolls-Royce.

948
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,300
But I`ll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

949
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:07,400
He knew all
the fuckin` angles.

950
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,300
He brought over the whole
"Femme Fatale" show from Paris...

951
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,300
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

952
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,600
He had to weigh `em in
once a week to make sure
they didn`t blow up like balloons.

953

- What`s the reason for this?
- Mr. Rothstein, sir.

00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,700
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

956
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,700
I`m trying to use respect.

Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

958
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,900
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

959
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,800
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

960
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,600
I guess she`s frightened. lf she doesn`t
lose weight she may get fired.

961
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,700
That`s right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--

- It`s been our policy--
- Just stop everything!

I gotta give the guy credit.

I mean, he does
the most obvious thing.

966
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,300
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

967
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,500
So why not take advantage, right?

968
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,100
So, he took bookie joints
off the street...

969
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,800
and then opened them up
inside the casino.

970
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,900
Within a few years
by doing all of this...

971

trying to copy off of him.

1050
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,800
[ Ace ]
Well, it wasn`t long...

1051
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,300
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

1052
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:09,200
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Las Vegas.

1053
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,000
And from then on,
I couldn`t be seen talking
to him anywhere in Vegas or near it.

1054
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,900
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

1055
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,700
"He will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

1056
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:23,900
And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

1057
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,200
every time he shows up."

1058
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,400
- You believe this shit?
- Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

1059
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,900
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation--"

1060
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,400
Motherfucker!

1061
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,000
ls there any way
around this?

1062
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,800
No, there`s no way.

1063
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,800
Let`s say, for instance...

1064
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:47,300
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

1065
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,100
to get one of those
sandwiches I like?

1066
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,800
Forget it. You can`t even
set foot in the parking lot.

1067
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,200
That`s how serious it is.

1068
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,500
In other words,
I`m fucked?

1069
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,700
In so many words, yes.

1070
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:04,800
It just didn`t sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

1071
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,700
Not being able to go
into a casino is one thing...

1072
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,200
but being in this book
etched your name into the brains
of every cop and FBl agent.

1073
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:15,800
I mean, you`re listed in there
with Al Capone. But Nicky didn`t care.

1074
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,400
I gotta do something.
They ain`t gettin` rid of me.

1075
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,000
They`re not gettin` rid of me.
I`m stayin` here.

1076
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,400
Fuck `em. Fuck `em.

1077
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,900
[ Nicky ]
So, once they pulled that shit...

1078
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,000
I started doin` my own things
nobody ever thought of doin`.

1079
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:38,900
To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my kid brother,
Dominick, and some desperados...

1080
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,700
and started knockin` over
high-rollers, casino bosses...

1081
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:44,500
bookmakers--
anybody right here in town.

1082
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,100
I had a good fuckin` crew goin`
for me, I`ll tell you that.

1083
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,600
I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1084
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:55,500
Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

1085
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,200
And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

1086
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,600
It was like old times.

1087
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:07,200
And I opened up my own jewelry
store too, the "Gold Rush."

1088
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,500
Sometimes I used to go along
on a heist, just for the fun of it.

1089
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,300
But I didn`t like the people
I was rippin` off looking at me...

1090
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,100
so I used to turn
their fuckin` pictures around.

1091
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
- What`s takin` so long?
- This is a motherfucker!

1092
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,100
- It`s working.
- Learn how to open these things
so you don`t have to take `em.

1093
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,800
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1094
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,300
Tell Pepe if he`s
switching stones on us,
he better take a camel back to Nigeria.

1095
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,500
- [ Phone Rings ]
- Yeah?

1096
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,700
- They`re in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

1097
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,900
- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

1098
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,700
- Yes. Don`t worry.
- All right. Thanks.

1099
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,300
[ Ace ] He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

1100
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,900
- But you got to hurry.
- Yeah, okay.

1101
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,100
- Valet parkers.
- They`re just checking in now.

1102
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,900
Okay, I`ll tell him.

1103
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,900
- Pit bosses.
- Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1104
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,900
- 1230. Right.
- Secretaries.

1105
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,100
- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

1106
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,300
And they all got
a piece of the score.

1107
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:59,200
Car`s coming.

1108
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,100
÷÷ [ Hard Rock ]

1109
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:04,200
They were very careful.

1110
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,800
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else...

1111
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:11,100
if not, they`d drill
enough holes to knock
through the walls with a sledgehammer.

1112
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,300
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1113
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,000
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1114
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,900
For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the fucking wild west.

1115
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,300
I just got a shipment
of diamonds from lsrael.

1116
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:28,200
[ Nicky ] What the fuck they expect
from me? I had to earn, didn`t I?

1117
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,500
You know, this diamond
has flaws in it.

1118
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,900
- There`s no flaws.
- I`m doing this for 25 years.

1119
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,200
You better clean your loupe,
because there`s no flaws.

1120
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,600
[ Nicky ]
Whenever we got local merch...

1121
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,600
we`d usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1122
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,200
I had a couple of sand niggers
out there. You know, Arabs.

1123
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,700
What, are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1124
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,800
I know his language.

1125
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,800
Forty thousand dollars.
The whole package.

1126
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,500
Twenty thousand.
That`s my final offer.

1127
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,100
He suddenly talks English. Let`s talk
Turkey here. Twenty-five thousand.

1128
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
[ Nicky ] I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vauIt...

1129
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,300
where I kept
the choice stuff.

1130
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,700
I couldn`t leave it
at the Gold Rush...

1131
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,900
in case we got raided
by the cops...

1132
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,800
or if my crew got cute.

1133
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,700
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn`t give a fuck.

1134
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,700
She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching TV.

1135
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,300
This stuff was all mine.
I didn`t send any of this back home.

1136
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,400
Actually, I couldn`t, because I wasn`t
even supposed to be doin` it.

1137
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,300
The bosses were making so much
fucking money with the casinos...

1138
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,400
that they didn`t want anybody
makin` any waves for them.

1139
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:32,000
You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

1140
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,900
- I took care of everybody.
- Yeah?

1141
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:38,300
That`s why there was
no real organized street stuff
in Vegas before I came here.

1142
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:41,100
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1143
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,500
You have to understand,
and I`m sure you do...

1144
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,600
that in a venture
of this kind...

1145
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,000
you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1146
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,000
So I put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with Charlie Clark, Ace`s banker.

1147
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:55,600
You will try to push it through,
won`t you, Mr. Clark?

1148
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,200
- Yes.
- I`m giving you 50,000 cash.

1149
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,600
Then I put some more money into
legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1150
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,400
- ls that the last one?
- Yeah.

1151
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,900
I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

1152
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,800
Fuckers.

1153
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,400
- Here you go, guys.
- All right.

1154
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,700
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

1155
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:18,700
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1156
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,700
- Hey, Dom.
- How ya doin`?

1157
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:24,300
[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1158
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,200
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1159
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,400
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1160
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,500
He had politicians, showgirls and movie
stars hanging out all over the place.

1161
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,700
That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

1162
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:40,200
By the way, Sammy said, whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1163
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,200
- Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
- Anything for a buck.

1164
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,000
- He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.
- Thanks.

1165
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,600
[ Ace ]
But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls, naturally.

1166
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,300
I mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1167
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,500
- You walk past me?
- Hey, this is Shelly.

1168
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,400
- Hey, Shelly. How are you?
- Hi.

1169
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,500
- And this is Stacy.
- Stacy.

1170
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:01,000
- This is Nick. Wanna have dinner?
- Pleasure.

1171
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Let`s check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1172
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,200
Come on. I`ll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1173
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,100
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1174
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:14,300
And you can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1175
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,200
That`s the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1176
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:20,700
Out here they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1177
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:24,400
Now, pink veal, you can pound
that shit for two days.

1178
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,800
It`ll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1179
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,700
I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1180
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:33,800
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1181
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,800
- That`s what I did.
- Yeah?

1182
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,100
- Yeah.
- You call yourself a man?

1183
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,800
You know you`re a lyin` lowlife,
motherfuckin` gamblin` degenerate prick?

1184
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,000
You know that`s what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1185
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,200
I gave you money to pay
the fuckin` rent...

1186
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,400
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1187
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,700
Your wife called Frankie and
told him the fuckin` heat`s off.

1188
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:54,900
And you didn`t gamble
that fuckin` money?

1189
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,800
- No? You didn`t?
- I didn`t--

1190
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,000
Don`t fuck with me, Al!
Don`t make a fuck outta me.

1191
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,500
You wanna embarrass me and make
a fool outta me? You didn`t gamble?

1192
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,700
Tell me you gambled
the fuckin` money...

1193
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,500
I`ll give you the fuckin` money
to put the fuckin` heat on!

1194
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,800
Did you gamble? Huh?

1195
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:16,000
Fuckin` degenerate.

1196
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,800
Fuckin` kids at home.

1197
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:24,100
Here. Get the fuck outta here.

1198
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
- Thanks, Nick.
- Yeah, thanks.

1199
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,900
Let me find out you fucked up.
I`ll leave you where I find you.

1200
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,900
How many of these
you gonna eat?

1201
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,900
- Two.
- Two?

1202
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,900
[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day...

1203
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,200
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1204
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:41,200
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1205
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,000
I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

1206
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,700
- Not a lot. You know why, right?
- Yeah.

1207
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:49,600
- Why?
- `Cause it clogs up your heart.

1208
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:53,700
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1209
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,400
[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks,
I used to send Marino...

1210
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,100
back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1211
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,400
Not a bit piece,
but what did they know?

1212
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:04,500
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don`t
know anybody who can see that far.

1213
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,500
Their drop was
a truck stop garage...

1214
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,400
where Remo and the guys used
to hang out and count their millions.

1215
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,300
- Remo.
- Hey, Frankie.

1216
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,000
The cops knew,
but they didn`t give a fuck.

1217
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,000
Nicky sends
his warmest regards.

1218
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,600
I knew how
to keep the bosses happy.

1219
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,900
Whenever they gave me
little jobs to do...

1220
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,100
I would carry things out
to a "T."

1221
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:28,300
Like the time Tony Dogs,
who`s supposed to be
the new maniac tough guy in town...

1222
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,600
shot up one of Remo`s bars.

1223
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:37,800
Here`s a fuckin` guy
kills two of Remo`s guys...

1224
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:42,200
and a poor fuckin` waitress who was just
workin` on her night off, of all things.

1225
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,400
I mean, this guy`s just beggin`
to be made an example of.

1226
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,000
Frankie, I want the names
of all the other people he had with him.

1227
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,300
And I don`t care what you have
to do to `em to get `em, understand?

1228
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,400
- I`ll take care of it, Remo.
- And mow `em down.

1229
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,600
[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1230
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,500
He was one of the toughest
lrishmen I ever met.

1231
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,800
- [ Chattering ]
- This son of a bitch was tough.

1232
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:08,300
For two days and two fuckin` nights
we beat the shit outta this guy.

1233
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,600
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1234
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,300
- Better give me a name soon,
or I`m gonna give him yours, Frank.
- Thanks a lot.

1235
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,300
- But he never talked.
- I know you would`ve ratted by now.

1236
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,900
In the end, I had to put
his fuckin` head in a vise.

1237
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:22,600
Dogs, Dogs,
can you hear me, Dogs?

1238
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,500
Listen to me, Anthony.
I got your head in a vise.

1239
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:29,700
I`ll squash your fuckin` head like a
grapefruit if you don`t give me a name.

1240
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,800
Don`t make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

1241
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,900
Don`t make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1242
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,300
[ Straining ]
Fuck you!

1243
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,400
This motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fuckin` days and nights.

1244
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,900
Fuck me? Fuck me?
You motherfucker!

1245
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:45,700
Fuck my mother?
ls that what you`re tellin` me?

1246
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,600
- [ Skull Crunching ]
- You motherfucker, you! Huh?

1247
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:51,900
- Oh, God!
- Give me the fuckin` name!

1248
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,700
[ Straining ]
Charlie M.

1249
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,600
- Charlie M.?
- Charlie M.

1250
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,600
You make me pop your
fuckin` eye outta your head...

1251
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,400
to protect that piece of shit,
Charlie M.?

1252
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
You dumb motherfucker!

1253
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,500
Kill me, you fuck!
Kill me!

1254
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,800
You motherfucker, you!

1255
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,100
Frankie, do him
a fuckin` favor.

1256
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,600
[ Ace ] The word got around
that finally...

1257
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,500
there was a real
gangster in town.

1258
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,600
Nicky was the new boss
of Las Vegas.

1259
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,500
Charlie M.

1260
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,400
[ Bells Ringing ]

1261
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,600
Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots.

1262
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,900
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

1263
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:31,300
It`s gotta be
in the millions, maybe more.

1264
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,600
Three fuckin` jackpots in 20 minutes!
Why didn`t you call me?

1265
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:38,100
It happened so quick. Three guys won.
I didn`t have a chance.

1266
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:41,800
- You didn`t see the scam?
- There`s no way to determine that.

1267
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:43,900
Yes, there is.
They won!

1268
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,000
It`s a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1269
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,400
Ward, you`re pissing me off.
Now you`re insuIting my intelligence.

1270
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:54,600
You know goddamn well somebody had
to get into those machines
and set those fuckin` reels.

1271
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,400
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1272
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,000
On three machines in a row,
it`s in the billions.

1273
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,100
What`s the matter with you?

1274
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:06,900
Didn`t you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1275
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,100
I think you`re overreacting.

1276
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:12,400
Listen, you fuckin` yokel. I`ve been
carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1277
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:15,800
- Get your ass outta here.
- You`re firing me?

1278
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,100
I`m firing you.
No, I`m not firing--

1279
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,400
- You might regret this.
- I`ll regret it if I keep you.

1280
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,700
This is not the way
to treat people.

1281
01:07:23,700 --> 01:07:25,800
lf you didn`t know,
you`re too fuckin` dumb.

1282
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,100
lf you did know,
you were in on it.

1283
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,600
Either way, you`re out.
Get out. Come on. Let`s go.

1284
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:33,500
The guy`s history
as far as I`m concerned.

1285
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,000
But you can`t fire him. His
brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1286
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:42,100
Everybody with cowboy boots is
a fuckin` county commissioner
or related to a commissioner.

1287
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,200
This is his state.
His uncle`s chief judge.

1288
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,600
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

1289
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,500
You`re in the finances,
you`re upstairs.

1290
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,300
But you are not on the floor.
You don`t see what`s going on.

1291
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,100
I`ve got thousands of players.
I`ve got 500 dealers.

1292
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:57,800
They`re all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1293
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,300
I have to let them know I`m watching
all the details all the time.

1294
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:04,900
There is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1295
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:07,600
- Look at yours. Look at that.
- Huh?

1296
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,300
Look at this.
There`s nothing.

1297
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,700
Look how many blueberries
your muffin has.

1298
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:15,100
What are you talking about?

1299
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:17,500
lf you don`t do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1300
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:21,000
- Where are you going?
- ÷ How long can this go on ÷

1301
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,200
From now on, I want you to put an equal
amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1302
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,900
An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

1303
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,500
Do you know how long
that`s going to take?

1304
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,200
I don`t care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1305
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,700
Just a little.
That a girl.

1306
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:44,100
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?

1307
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,100
Wanna come to Mommy?
It`s all right, sweetheart.

1308
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,900
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1309
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,300
- What do you need?
- Got her?

1310
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,000
Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.

1311
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,200
Why don`t you take it
out of your account?

1312
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,400
I would, you know, Sam,
it`s just that--

1313
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,200
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

1314
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,400
Twenty-five thousand?
For yourself?

1315
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,400
- Yeah.
- Why do you need that much?

1316
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,300
What`s the difference?
I just need it.

1317
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,300
Well, I gotta ask you.
That`s a lot of money.

1318
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:20,300
You`re not asking
for a box of popcorn.

1319
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,900
We don`t have to turn this
into a big deal.

1320
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,500
Okay? We don`t have
to have a fight.

1321
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,300
It`s important to me.
Just something I wanted to do.

1322
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,300
Who`s fighting?
I mean, tell me what it`s for.

1323
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:38,900
Why can`t you tell me
what it`s for? Huh?

1324
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

1325
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,100
My wife comes to me and asks me
for 25,000. What do you want, a coat?

1326
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,700
- No.
- lf you want a coat, you got it.

1327
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:54,000
It`s not the money.
It`s just, why do you want it?
Am I not entitled to ask that?

1328
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:58,100
Sam, I`ve been independent
my whole life. I never had
to ask anybody for anything.

1329
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,000
- Now you`re making me beg.
- What are you talking about?

1330
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:04,500
And you`re embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

1331
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,400
You`re asking me for 25,000.
I`m not out to make you feel bad.

1332
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,400
I want to just
be able to trust you.

1333
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,300
You know,

[ Nicky ] She was doin` pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1627
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,500
But before she could start
countin` her money...

1628
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,200
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1629
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,300
So they sent me.

1630
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,600
Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1631
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:30,200
- What are you talking about?
- She was found
last night shot in the head.

1632
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,100
Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1633
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,200
Her lawyer said
you were partners.

1634
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:37,900
We were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

1635
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,500
lt was never a partnership.

1636

Did you ever hear
of the .22 Caliber Killer?

1637
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,200
[ Ace ] Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1638
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:48,400
they started looking
at Green too.

1639
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,200
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1640
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:54,000
l had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1641
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,300
the casino
was on the up-and-up.

1642
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:58,800
So how often do you
really fill in for him?

1643
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,500
Green`s here about
two or three times a month...

1644
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:06,000
and he`s busy
with real estate deals.

1645
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,000
So in Green`s absence,
then, you`re the boss?

1646
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,000
l serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board.

My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1648
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,400
So day-to-day, then,
you`re the boss?

1649
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:23,100
Well, in a sense, you could say
that l am the boss...

1650
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,700
when Mr. Green is away.

1651
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,400
You could say that.

1652

Why, of course he said that.
lt`s right here.

Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

1660
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,800
l don`t know.
We have to check the files.

1661
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:57,300
Without gettin` your shorts
in a knot, would you do that?
