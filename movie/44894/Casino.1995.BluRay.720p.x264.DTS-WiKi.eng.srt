1
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:53,040
SAM: [Voiceover] When you love someone,
you've gotta trust them.

2
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:54,416
There's no other way.

3
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,007
You've got to give them the key
to everything that's yours.

4
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,599
Otherwise, what's the point?

5
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,180
And, for a while,
I believed that's the kind of love I had.

6
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:17,007
SAM: Before I ever ran a casino,
or got blown up...

7
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:19,672
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.

8
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:20,960
I can tell you that.

9
00:03:21,181 --> 00:03:24,135
I was so good that whenever I bet,
I'd change the odds...

10
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:25,928
for every bookmaker in the country.

11
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,392
I'm serious, I had it down so cold...

12
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:30,889
that I was given paradise on Earth.

13
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:35,486
I was given one of the biggest casinos
in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

14
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,858
by the only kind of guys that can actually
get you that kind of money.

15
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:42,865
$62, 700, 000.

16
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,820
I don't know all the details.

17
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,531
NICKY: [Voiceover] In fact,
nobody knew all the details...

18
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,212
but it should've been perfect.

19
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:53,585
He had me, Nicky Santoro,
his best friend, watching his ass...

20
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:57,463
and he had Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.

21
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,678
But in the end, we fucked it all up.

22
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:02,892
It should've been so sweet, too.

23
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:06,556
It turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us...

24
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,355
were ever given anything
that fucking valuable again.

25
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,525
SAM: Vegas was a place where suckers...

26
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:18,536
flew in every year on their own nickel...

27
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,703
and left behind about a billion dollars.

28
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:25,041
But at night, you couldn't see
the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

29
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:30,918
But it's in the desert where lots
of the town's problems are solved.

30
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,053
NICKY: Got a lot of holes in the desert...

31
00:04:33,181 --> 00:04:35,553
and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes.

32
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,969
Except you gotta do it right.

33
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,727
You gotta have the hole already dug...

34
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:42,061
before you show up
with a package in the trunk.

35
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:46,017
Otherwise, you're talking about
30 or 45 minutes of digging.

36
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,775
Who knows who's gonna be coming along
in that time?

37
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:51,742
Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

38
00:04:51,827 --> 00:04:53,701
You could be there all fucking night.

39
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:08,470
THE STRIP - LAS VEGAS
TEN YEARS EARLIER

40
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:12,297
SAM: Who could resist?

41
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,140
Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler...

42
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:18,557
always looking over my shoulder,
hassled by cops, day and night.

43
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,601
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.

44
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,405
I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino.

45
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,241
And that's like selling people
dreams for cash.

46
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,408
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert,
as my manager, and went to work.

47
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:35,123
And this is Ronnie,
who takes care of the card room.

48
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,751
SAM: For guys like me,
Las Vegas washes away your sins.

49
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:42,876
It's like a morality car wash.

50
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:46,463
It does for us what Lourdes does
for humpbacks and cripples.

51
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,522
SAM: And along with making us legit...

52
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:58,600
comes cash, tons of it.

53
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:01,573
What do you think we're doing
here in the middle of the desert?

54
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:03,200
It's all this money.

55
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,122
This is the end result
of all the bright lights...

56
00:06:07,248 --> 00:06:10,284
and the comped trips,
of all the champagne...

57
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:14,463
and free hotel suites,
and all the broads and all the booze.

58
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:18,718
It's all been arranged
just for us to get your money.

59
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:22,096
That's the truth about Las Vegas.

60
00:06:24,143 --> 00:06:25,601
We're the only winners.

61
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,762
The players don't stand a chance.

62
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:30,437
And their cash flows from the tables...

63
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,140
to our boxes through the cage...

64
00:06:33,278 --> 00:06:36,149
and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

65
00:06:37,032 --> 00:06:39,274
The place where they add up all the money...

66
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:41,942
the Holy of holies, the count room.

67
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,534
Now, this place was off-limits.

68
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,586
Even I couldn't get inside.

69
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:51,588
But it was my job to keep it filled
with cash. That's for sure.

70
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:53,755
NICKY: They had so much money in there...

71
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,458
you could build a house out
of stacks of $100 bills.

72
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,263
And the best part was that upstairs...

73
00:06:58,391 --> 00:07:01,345
the Board of Directors didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

74
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:03,725
To them everything looked
on the up-and-up.

75
00:07:03,855 --> 00:07:05,349
Right? Wrong.

76
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:06,680
Verify $5,000.

77
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,483
NICKY: The guys in the counting room...

78
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,153
were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

79
00:07:12,657 --> 00:07:15,230
They'd do short counts,
they'd lose fill slips.

80
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,824
They'd even take cash
right out of the drop-boxes.

81
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,782
And it was up to this guy right here...

82
00:07:19,915 --> 00:07:22,073
standing in front of $2 million...

83
00:07:22,168 --> 00:07:25,418
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody getting wise...

84
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,290
the IRS or anybody.

85
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:30,961
Notice how in the count room
nobody ever seems to see anything.

86
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:33,337
Somehow, somebody's always looking
the other way.

87
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:35,637
Look at these guys. They look busy, right?

88
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:38,181
They're counting money.
Who wants to bother them?

89
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:41,604
I mean, God forbid they should make
a mistake and forget to steal.

90
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:44,479
Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.

91
00:07:45,612 --> 00:07:48,399
Past the jag-off guard
who gets an extra $100 a week...

92
00:07:48,532 --> 00:07:49,907
just to watch the door.

93
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:52,822
It's routine. Business as usual...

94
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:55,659
in, out, hello, goodbye.

95
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,165
That's all there is to it.

96
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,833
Just another fat fuck walking out
of a casino with a suitcase.

97
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,586
Now, that suitcase was going
straight to one place:

98
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,422
right to Kansas City, which was as close...

99
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:09,796
to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses
could go...

100
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:11,806
without getting themselves arrested.

101
00:08:12,768 --> 00:08:16,054
That suitcase was all
the bosses ever wanted.

102
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:18,685
And they wanted it every month.

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,197
Now this old Mormon fuck here...

104
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:29,660
he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy.

105
00:08:29,997 --> 00:08:32,570
-Something smells good.
-They made us something to eat.

106
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,582
NICKY: The bosses
would come from all over:

107
00:08:35,002 --> 00:08:37,208
Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...

108
00:08:37,338 --> 00:08:38,713
all over the Midwest...

109
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:42,212
and they would meet in this produce market
in Kansas City.

110
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:43,802
Nobody even knew it.

111
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:46,636
One of the guys made
his mother do the cooking.

112
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,805
Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?

113
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:51,551
NICKY: These old greaseballs
might not look it...

114
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:52,886
but believe me...

115
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,940
these are the guys
who secretly controlled Las Vegas.

116
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,611
WOMAN: Mama, that man's here again.

117
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,104
NICKY: Because they controlled
the Teamsters Union.

118
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,574
And that's where you had to go
to borrow money to buy a casino.

119
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,576
WOMAN 2: Would you put in shrimp?
WOMAN: I would.

120
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:09,906
NICKY: Nobody got a Teamsters'
loan unless the guys in this room...

121
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:12,326
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.

122
00:09:13,631 --> 00:09:16,122
Guys like this antique over here,
out of Detroit.

123
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:21,670
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit's top boss.

124
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:23,052
You got a round figure on it?

125
00:09:23,183 --> 00:09:25,306
NICKY: Definitely the most
important guy in this room.

126
00:09:25,394 --> 00:09:29,143
FRANK: About 20 pounds.
Around $700,000.
REMO: Good.

127
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:32,180
STONE: It's a little early for Las Vegas...

128
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,027
but I want to welcome the ladies
and gentlemen of the gaming industry....

129
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:39,199
SAM: As far as the world was concerned...

130
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,363
Andy Stone,
head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

131
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:44,164
was a legitimate guy.

132
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,197
A powerful man.

133
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,830
He played golf with the President.

134
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,211
ANDY: On behalf
of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...

135
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,046
I'm glad to present...
SAM: But he also took orders.

136
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:57,428
When he was told to give
a pension-fund loan to Philip Green...

137
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,592
...this check for $62,700,000...

138
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:02,102
for the new Tangiers.

139
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,229
...he did what he was told.

140
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:06,356
NICKY: Here was the perfect front man.

141
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:09,063
What the fuck else could he be?
He didn't know too much.

142
00:10:09,153 --> 00:10:10,647
He didn't want to know too much...

143
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,567
especially that the bosses
made the Teamsters lend him money.

144
00:10:13,658 --> 00:10:16,778
He wanted to believe they gave him
the money because he was smart.

145
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,407
I say that knowing just how much
competition we have in this city.

146
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:25,878
NICKY: And where they got Green from?

147
00:10:26,215 --> 00:10:27,543
Who the fuck knows?

148
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,587
All I know is that he was
an Arizona real-estate hustler...

149
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:34,213
who barely had enough gas money
to come and pick up his fucking check.

150
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:36,890
And it was the bosses' man...

151
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:38,768
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.

152
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:41,268
Not the Chairman of the Board,
Philip Green.

153
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,273
I understand.

154
00:10:47,573 --> 00:10:48,771
NICKY: Now all they needed was...

155
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:50,989
someone they could trust to run the casino.

156
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,659
And who better than Ace?
He was already in Vegas a couple years...

157
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:56,663
and he had the fucking place clocked.

158
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:00,086
But typical Ace,
give him a shot to run a casino...

159
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:01,665
and he tries to talk you out of it.

160
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,457
I don't know if I could do this.

161
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:05,838
The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

162
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,721
I have at least 24 gambling
and bookmaking pinches on me.

163
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:12,098
You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

164
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:14,392
All you gotta do is apply for one.

165
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:16,970
The State law says that
you can work in a casino...

166
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:18,649
while they process your application.

167
00:11:18,817 --> 00:11:20,691
ANDY: They got a 10-year backlog.

168
00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:22,443
What happens when they do find out?

169
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,190
ANDY: Why would they want to find out?

170
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:27,900
We're putting $100 million here.
Why would they lock us out?

171
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:32,071
ANDY: They'll never find out. All you
gotta do is keep changing your job title.

172
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,707
Like, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

173
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,378
Then they put your application
at the bottom of the pile.

174
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,051
I know guys who've worked there
for 30 years don't have a license.

175
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,095
It's a tough proposition, Andy.

176
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,431
If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

177
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,510
ANDY: You got it.

178
00:11:50,729 --> 00:11:52,520
I'm serious. No interference.

179
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:56,227
Nobody's gonna interfere
with your running the casino.

180
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:57,944
I guarantee it.

181
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:03,066
NICKY: And that's how they got Ace
to take over.

182
00:12:03,744 --> 00:12:07,789
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

183
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:13,291
They worked out a real cute job title, too...

184
00:12:13,422 --> 00:12:15,794
Tangiers Public Relations Director.

185
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,630
But the only thing he ever directed
was the casino.

186
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,843
He made his first bet when he was 15,
and he always made money.

187
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:26,178
He didn't bet like you or me.

188
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,434
Having some fun with it, shit like that.

189
00:12:28,523 --> 00:12:30,231
Where did you learn how to deal?

190
00:12:30,901 --> 00:12:33,059
NICKY: He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.

191
00:12:33,654 --> 00:12:35,112
SAM: Place the checks properly.

192
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,989
-That's the way you do it.
-Yes, sir.

193
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,859
NICKY: He had to know everything.

194
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:41,525
He'd find out the inside stuff
nobody else knew...

195
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,614
and that's what he'd put his money on.

196
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:48,456
BACK HOME YEARS AGO
Even back home, years ago...

197
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,667
when we first hung out,
he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...

198
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,378
I'll take Columbia for $20,000.

199
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:55,342
...if his girlfriend was knocked up.

200
00:12:56,138 --> 00:12:59,258
He'd get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

201
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:03,058
He even figured out the bounce
you got off different kinds of wood...

202
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:05,264
on college basketball courts.

203
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,356
He'd be working on this day and night.

204
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,727
He knew everything about a game
he would bet on.

205
00:13:09,862 --> 00:13:12,733
Ace got down at $6,000.
Get me down at $6,000.

206
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,399
NICKY: Season after season...

207
00:13:15,536 --> 00:13:17,991
the prick was the only guaranteed winner
I ever knew.

208
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,704
But he was so serious about it all...

209
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,706
that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.

210
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,459
But that's just the way he was.

211
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:29,384
Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck
whether he enjoyed himself or not.

212
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,965
To them, he was a cash register.

213
00:13:32,055 --> 00:13:35,091
All they had to do was ring the bell
and take money.

214
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:36,505
Especially Remo...

215
00:13:36,643 --> 00:13:39,679
who was a fucking degenerate gambler
who always lost.

216
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:43,186
All those fucking sweeps.

217
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:45,731
NICKY: Unless Ace made his bets.
Enough now!

218
00:13:47,197 --> 00:13:49,106
NICKY: Ace made more money
for them on a weekend...

219
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,447
than I could do heisting joints for a month.

220
00:13:52,412 --> 00:13:55,164
Whatever Ace picked up on the street,
he told Remo.

221
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,622
Fixed fights, doped horses...

222
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:01,955
crooked fucking zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

223
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,964
He told fucking Remo everything.

224
00:14:04,092 --> 00:14:06,334
And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.

225
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,631
Keeping Remo happy with money...

226
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,054
was the greatest insurance policy
in the world.

227
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,436
Son of a bitch!

228
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,685
How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

229
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:19,603
Nobody ever had Oklahoma....
How'd you do it?

230
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,277
That's why they paid so well.

231
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,688
REMO: You see? Never tells me nothing.

232
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:25,862
What do we got on for next week?

233
00:14:25,951 --> 00:14:29,534
It's a little too early. I'll know
by Thursday. Is that all right?

234
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:31,870
REMO: You'll come by the house?
SAM: I'll come by.

235
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:33,197
At 7:00.

236
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,202
REMO: Good job, my boy. Keep it up.

237
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,416
REMO: Hey, Nick.

238
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,581
I'll be right out.

239
00:14:42,136 --> 00:14:45,172
See that guy? Keep a good eye on him.

240
00:14:45,598 --> 00:14:47,389
He's making a lot of money for us.

241
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,720
And he'll continue making money for us,
so keep a good eye on him.

242
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,725
Not like the fucking Feds out there,
without brains.

243
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,191
REMO: Okay?
NICKY: All right.

244
00:14:56,945 --> 00:14:58,107
Want me to take this?

245
00:14:58,238 --> 00:15:00,277
NICKY: Now, on top of everything else...

246
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:02,903
I gotta make sure nobody fucks
with the Golden Jew.

247
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:05,195
Couple of shooters for the ladies.

248
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,115
SAM: Yeah, we made a great pair.

249
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,162
I made book and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

250
00:15:12,504 --> 00:15:14,247
The old men loved us, and why not?

251
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,257
They all made money with us.

252
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:18,384
How did Nicky collect?

253
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,751
Don't ask.

254
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:22,384
Then where the fuck is the money?
I don't see it.

255
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:25,134
-Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
-Hi, Sam.

256
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:26,974
Who's this guy?

257
00:15:27,105 --> 00:15:29,892
MAN: Get the fuck out. I laid nine.
NICKY: It was eight.

258
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,809
NICKY: Ace, tell him the line
on the Bears game.

259
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,864
-Eight.
-If he don't know, nobody knows.

260
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,322
NICKY: It was eight.
MAN: How come I laid nine?

261
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,075
'Cause you're a jag-off.

262
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,037
-Excuse me.
-What?

263
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:45,782
-Isthis your pen?
-Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

264
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,166
It's nice. I didn't know whose it was.

265
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,920
I didn't want it to get lost.

266
00:15:50,048 --> 00:15:52,420
Thank you.
Why don't you take that fucking pen...

267
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,876
and shove it up your ass,
you fucking jag-off?

268
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,014
-Well, I was just offering--
-Asshole.

269
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,684
MAN: Look out, Joe.

270
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:24,000
What's that? You hear a little girl?

271
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:26,918
Is that a little fucking girl?

272
00:16:27,091 --> 00:16:28,549
What happened to the tough guy...

273
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,001
who told my friend to stick it
up his fucking ass?

274
00:16:31,304 --> 00:16:33,095
Nicky, take it easy.

275
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:44,435
SAM: While I tried to figure out
why the guy said what he said...

276
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:45,944
Nicky just hit him.

277
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:49,398
No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

278
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:52,778
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

279
00:16:53,163 --> 00:16:56,330
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

280
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:59,247
If you beat him with a gun,
you'd better kill him...

281
00:16:59,337 --> 00:17:02,089
because he'll keep coming back and back...

282
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,792
until one of you is dead.

283
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:15,431
NICKY: With me protecting Ace...

284
00:17:15,564 --> 00:17:17,355
he made a fortune for the bosses.

285
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,143
That's what got him to Vegas.

286
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,988
He was a money machine.

287
00:17:25,283 --> 00:17:27,322
A tremendous earner for these guys.

288
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:30,491
As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fucking drop.

289
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,205
With Ace, the casino never saw
so much money.

290
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:37,370
And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.

291
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:58,769
SAM: In Vegas, I had to keep
a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

292
00:17:58,906 --> 00:18:01,278
They were close to the good old boys.

293
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,160
Without us, these guys
would still be shoveling mule shit.

294
00:18:05,246 --> 00:18:07,120
You've got to keep a cleaner station.

295
00:18:07,249 --> 00:18:09,372
If you need Mr. Clean, page him.

296
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:11,244
Won't happen again, Sam.

297
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:15,251
SAM: Mr. Rothstein.
MAN: It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.

298
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:18,337
Is this guy just another dumb fucking
white man, or what?

299
00:18:18,512 --> 00:18:20,551
-You need this guy.
-Can't get rid of him?

300
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:23,350
He's juiced in.
He's the County Commissioner's cousin.

301
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:25,344
SAM: I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

302
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:28,016
I had no choice. I had to take care of them.

303
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,891
These yokels ran the state.

304
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,139
DEALER: Thanks, Senator.

305
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,811
SAM: They passed the laws,
owned the courts.
I need a room.

306
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,398
SAM: I had dozens of politicians
and state officials coming through weekly.

307
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,410
SAM: Get him what he wants.
BILLY: Certainly.

308
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:42,913
SAM: Why not make them happy?

309
00:18:55,096 --> 00:18:57,967
For politicians,
like our State Senator up there...

310
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,682
everything was on the house.

311
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,769
These guys won their comped life
when they got elected.

312
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:04,438
Why not take advantage of it?

313
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:09,231
Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

314
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:12,276
It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa...

315
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,649
who plays $30, 000 a hand in baccarat.

316
00:19:14,743 --> 00:19:16,652
That's the one you really gotta watch.

317
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:20,238
He plays fast and big.
He has the cash and the credit...

318
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,750
to turn out your lights.

319
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:25,412
A year ago he cleaned out a couple
of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

320
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:28,171
Downstairs he takes us for $2 million...

321
00:19:28,342 --> 00:19:32,091
and upstairs he takes free soap,
shampoo and towels.

322
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,717
Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms...

323
00:19:35,851 --> 00:19:38,971
free private jets
and $2 million of our money.

324
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:41,810
But we got him back.

325
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,480
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

326
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,936
ICHlKAWA: What went wrong?
BILLY: I'm awfully sorry.

327
00:19:47,782 --> 00:19:49,656
These mechanical things happen.

328
00:19:49,784 --> 00:19:52,073
Better here than up there.

329
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:54,992
SAM: Then he missed the flights
connecting with Japan.

330
00:19:55,123 --> 00:19:57,495
I can't believe there's no room.

331
00:20:02,382 --> 00:20:05,751
SAM: We got him back with
a whole floor of rooms to himself.

332
00:20:05,886 --> 00:20:08,840
-Sorry you missed your plane.
-You'd like some of my money back.

333
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:10,764
Oh, no. No gambling.

334
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:16,356
SAM: And once he was back,
he played small.

335
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:22,687
He bet $1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.

336
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:29,239
But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa...

337
00:20:29,371 --> 00:20:31,826
was that they can't bet small for long.

338
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,288
He didn't think of it as winning $10, 000...

339
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,832
he thought of it as losing $90, 000.

340
00:20:37,673 --> 00:20:39,547
So, he upped his bets.

341
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,725
Until he dropped his winnings back
and gave up $1 million of his own cash.

342
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:53,559
In a casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing...

343
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:55,066
and keep them coming back.

344
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:57,731
The longer they play, the more they lose.

345
00:20:57,863 --> 00:20:59,902
In the end, we get it all.

346
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:12,579
In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch
everybody else.

347
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,296
Since the players
are looking to beat the casino...

348
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,093
the dealers are watching the players...

349
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,302
the boxmen are watching the dealers...

350
00:21:26,938 --> 00:21:29,310
the floormen are watching the boxmen...

351
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,473
the pit bosses are watching the floormen...

352
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:35,572
the shift bosses are watching
the pit bosses...

353
00:21:35,657 --> 00:21:38,444
the casino manager is watching
the shift bosses...

354
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,735
I'm watching the casino manager...

355
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:44,116
and the eye in the sky is watching us all.

356
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,544
Plus, we had a dozen guys...

357
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:53,841
most of them ex-cheats,
who knew every trick in the house.

358
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:15,906
Yes!

359
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:19,331
-Very nice.
-I told you I was hot tonight.

360
00:22:30,971 --> 00:22:32,429
Looking good.

361
00:22:33,015 --> 00:22:34,889
MAN: Let's go. This is for Ginger.

362
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:37,009
MAN: Let me have $100 on your hard 10.

363
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:39,141
Thank you.

364
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,388
MAN: Here we go now.

365
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:54,701
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-The dice.

366
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,500
Thank you very much.

367
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,838
I appreciate that.

368
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:05,087
Take care, Steve. Take chances, drive fast.

369
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:08,717
This $100 is for you, love.
Thanks for your time.

370
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,177
-Come on.
-What's the matter?

371
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,891
I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.

372
00:23:16,023 --> 00:23:17,814
What money? I've seen you stealing.

373
00:23:17,942 --> 00:23:20,314
"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.

374
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:22,651
GINGER: I want my half.
GAMBLER: I've watched you.

375
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:25,111
-I want my money.
-Your bag is full of chips.

376
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:27,697
GINGER: I didn't steal anything from you.
GAMBLER: Get lost!

377
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:30,079
GINGER: Get lost?
GAMBLER: Yes!

378
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,865
-Well, how about that?
-Come on!

379
00:24:24,018 --> 00:24:27,138
SAM: What a move. I fell in love right there.

380
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:30,807
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger,
love costs money.

381
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:38,324
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

382
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:52,715
SAM: Ginger's mission in life was money.
I'll be right back.

383
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:54,882
DOORMAN: See you.
GINGER: Thanks for asking.

384
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,679
SAM: She was a queen around the casino.

385
00:24:56,806 --> 00:25:00,222
She brought in high rollers
and helped them spend a lot of money.

386
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:02,808
-Hello.
-Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

387
00:25:02,897 --> 00:25:05,602
GINGER: Great. You might have
something for me. Got me covered?

388
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,940
GINGER: Thank you.
VALET: Take care of yourself.

389
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,105
I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.

390
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,445
SAM: Who didn't want her?
She was one of the best known...

391
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:17,661
best liked and most respected hustlers
in town.

392
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:23,957
Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake...

393
00:25:24,046 --> 00:25:26,501
for two or three days
before sending him home broke...

394
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,714
to the little woman and his bank examiners.

395
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:45,403
Any change?

396
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:50,071
Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.

397
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:54,495
SAM: But that was all bullshit.
She just pocketed the cash.

398
00:25:57,376 --> 00:25:59,250
GINGER: How you doing tonight?
CASHlER: Good.

399
00:25:59,379 --> 00:26:00,921
CASHlER: How are you?
GINGER: Beat.

400
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:03,918
SAM: Ginger had the hustlers' code.
GINGER: Take one for you.

401
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,631
CASHlER: Thank you.
SAM: She knew how to take care of people.

402
00:26:07,763 --> 00:26:09,839
That's what Vegas is all about.

403
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:12,429
CASHlER: $6,800.
GINGER: Thanks.

404
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:15,099
SAM: It's kickback city.
GINGER: Have a good night.

405
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:22,896
SAM: She took care of the dealers...

406
00:26:23,073 --> 00:26:25,315
pit bosses, floor managers...

407
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:28,156
but, mostly, the valet parkers...

408
00:26:28,245 --> 00:26:31,531
the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

409
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:33,374
Ginger took care of the parkers...

410
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:36,953
who took care of the security guards,
who took care of the cops...

411
00:26:37,089 --> 00:26:39,461
who let her operate.
I need that stuff tonight.

412
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,043
VALET: No problem.
GINGER: You are a doll.

413
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:44,671
SAM: The valet parking job
was such a money-maker...

414
00:26:44,765 --> 00:26:47,968
they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

415
00:26:49,979 --> 00:26:52,185
But one thing I didn't understand...

416
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:54,770
was that she had everything under control...

417
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:57,648
except for her old pimp boyfriend,
Lester Diamond.

418
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,022
I got other people in this. I got partners.

419
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:05,026
I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?

420
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:08,989
You'll get yours back,
and you'll get it back first. Okay?

421
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:11,332
-All right.
-Where you going?

422
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,373
Where are you? You're in that place.

423
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,375
-I'm here.
-No, you're not.

424
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,541
Where are you?

425
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,180
I'm always here for you.

426
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,764
-You are.
-I am.

427
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,350
SAM: The Ginger I knew
wouldn't even look at this creep.

428
00:27:29,817 --> 00:27:31,477
-Good luck.
-Yeah.

429
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,527
SAM: He was a moocher, a card cheat...

430
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:36,324
a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...

431
00:27:36,783 --> 00:27:39,321
-chasing dentists for a few bucks.
-Careful.

432
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,820
SAM: He was always broke.
He always had a story.

433
00:27:41,956 --> 00:27:43,995
Somehow, she could never turn him down.

434
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,620
The way Ginger saw it
was that he was just an unlucky guy.

435
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:49,665
Somebody had to take care of him.

436
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:51,330
BACK HOME

437
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:53,216
But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

438
00:27:53,344 --> 00:27:56,013
You find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

439
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,303
SAM: He took care of himself only too well.

440
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,180
That's why every badge back home
wanted to nail him.

441
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,930
I folded these things beautifully.
I would appreciate a little respect.

442
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:07,397
Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.

443
00:28:08,528 --> 00:28:11,233
SAM: Even after a vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

444
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:14,070
Frank Marino was there to meet him.
So were the cops.

445
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:15,910
They wanted to pinch him...

446
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:18,533
-for a diamond burglary in Antwerp.
-Help me fold these.

447
00:28:18,623 --> 00:28:21,659
SAM: They were ready to blame him
for anything, no matter where.

448
00:28:22,127 --> 00:28:23,502
They were usually right.

449
00:28:24,547 --> 00:28:26,374
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.

450
00:28:26,507 --> 00:28:28,832
And he didn't give a damn who knew it.

451
00:28:28,927 --> 00:28:31,382
GINGER: There we go. Look at that.
Beautiful!

452
00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,931
SAM: I mean that's what worried me...

453
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:37,094
'cause it turns out,
Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.

454
00:28:37,228 --> 00:28:39,267
JENNlFER: All right, we're clear.
NICKY: There's more.

455
00:28:41,066 --> 00:28:42,940
NICKY: There's a couple stuck in there.

456
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:44,895
-I'm telling you, they're out!
-Come on.

457
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:48,149
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

458
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:51,534
What's that?

459
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:54,404
There's no more. Thanks.

460
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:57,417
NICKY: I couldn't wait
to get my hands on Vegas.

461
00:28:57,627 --> 00:29:00,296
But the bosses didn't send me out
to have a good time.

462
00:29:00,422 --> 00:29:03,423
They sent me out to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace.

463
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,047
And nobody interfered
with the fucking skim.

464
00:29:08,473 --> 00:29:09,848
-Hey.
-Hey, how you doing?

465
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:12,309
Hey, Sammy.

466
00:29:13,604 --> 00:29:16,309
-Boy, look at this place.
-Incredible.

467
00:29:17,108 --> 00:29:18,566
SAM: Welcome to Vegas.

468
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,228
NICKY: Okay, Sammy.
SAM: Something, huh?

469
00:29:21,613 --> 00:29:22,811
Ginger.

470
00:29:27,453 --> 00:29:29,611
Holy shit. What've you been doing out here?

471
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:31,368
SAM: Honey, come here.

472
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:36,285
This is Jennifer and Nick.
They're dear friends of mine.

473
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,171
-Hi, Jennifer.
-A pleasure.

474
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:41,926
Okay, Sammy.

475
00:29:42,304 --> 00:29:44,925
SAM: After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger...

476
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:46,592
and we took a ride to talk.

477
00:29:46,934 --> 00:29:49,306
And then, he hit me with it.

478
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:51,601
What do you think
about me moving out here?

479
00:29:54,317 --> 00:29:55,941
You got a problem with that?

480
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:57,308
No, of course not.

481
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,072
You mean I have your permission?

482
00:30:00,324 --> 00:30:02,363
Sure, you do. But I just gotta tell you...

483
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:04,403
it's no joke out here.

484
00:30:04,538 --> 00:30:06,577
You gotta keep a low profile.

485
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:09,578
It's not like back home.
They don't like guys like us.

486
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,667
This sheriff's a real cowboy.

487
00:30:11,838 --> 00:30:14,459
Even coppers aren't afraid
to bury people in the desert.

488
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:17,420
I don't care. I want to get away
from back home for a while.

489
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,594
I'm tired of that shit back there.

490
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:21,465
Look at this place. It's made of money.

491
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:23,016
You know what the best part is?

492
00:30:23,184 --> 00:30:25,093
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

493
00:30:25,187 --> 00:30:28,223
There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

494
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:30,148
I got pinched twice for no reason.

495
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:31,853
I really gotta be careful.

496
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,608
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.

497
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:37,271
Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.

498
00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:39,864
I'm especially not gonna involve you
in anything.

499
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,207
NICKY: Ace saw Vegas one way...

500
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:47,583
NICKY: Call and tell him I'm coming?
JACK: Of course.

501
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,290
...but I saw it another.

502
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:51,836
I saw it as untouched.

503
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,885
They had bookies, pimps,
and drug dealers I could shake down.

504
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,932
Who the fuck were they gonna run to?

505
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,887
So I started getting everybody in line.

506
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:04,690
Best of all, for the first time in my life...

507
00:31:04,774 --> 00:31:07,146
I figured out a way not to lose.

508
00:31:07,277 --> 00:31:09,104
SAM: He had a foolproof scheme.

509
00:31:09,238 --> 00:31:11,277
It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.

510
00:31:11,448 --> 00:31:12,693
When he won, he collected.

511
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,358
When he lost,
he told the bookies to fuck off.

512
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:19,036
What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?
Nicky was the muscle.

513
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,541
-Hey, how you doing?
-How you doing?

514
00:31:22,586 --> 00:31:24,625
-You got that thing for me?
-What thing?

515
00:31:24,756 --> 00:31:26,499
Nicky, I thought you was laying.

516
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:28,799
I was laying? No, I'm taking it.

517
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,753
-You sure?
-I'm positive.

518
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,220
-I'm a little confused.
-You're a little confused?

519
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,682
Maybe if I stick your fucking face
through this window...

520
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,355
you'll get unconfused.

521
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,225
-Give me the fucking money.
-I'm sorry.

522
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,729
I didn't mean anything by it.

523
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,440
That's why you had it ready.
You thought I was laying it.

524
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:49,152
-My fucking head.
-Smarten up.

525
00:31:50,285 --> 00:31:53,868
And now Nicholas Santoro will come up
and tell us about our first President.

526
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:00,796
George Washington was born--

527
00:32:00,797 --> 00:32:03,502
SAM: But still, it was nice
and quiet for a while.

528
00:32:03,634 --> 00:32:06,207
We presented Nicky and Jennifer
all over town...

529
00:32:06,345 --> 00:32:08,219
like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

530
00:32:09,516 --> 00:32:10,974
COACH: You got a beautiful swing.

531
00:32:11,101 --> 00:32:14,470
NICKY: Ace got Little Nicky
involved with Little League. It was great.

532
00:32:14,647 --> 00:32:18,063
Turned out that one of the other coaches
was a metro intelligence cop.

533
00:32:18,151 --> 00:32:20,689
But it didn't matter. It was all about the kids.

534
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,275
He's gotta realize
everything can't be a home run.

535
00:32:23,365 --> 00:32:27,233
That's exactly what I tell him,
but that's the kind of kid he is.

536
00:32:28,997 --> 00:32:32,366
SAM: And Nicky being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

537
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:35,952
Especially at the casino
where he definitely did not work...

538
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:37,505
people got the message.

539
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:40,378
NICKY: Me, that's why
the bosses sent me out here.

540
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,179
I was to make sure no other crews
robbed the joint.

541
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,677
Like these two fucking balloon heads
over here.

542
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:48,643
They were gonna try to bang us
out of $200, 000.

543
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:50,436
Yeah, right, I'm sure.

544
00:32:50,563 --> 00:32:52,390
How are you? What are you doing here?

545
00:32:52,524 --> 00:32:53,722
I'm over here now.

546
00:32:53,817 --> 00:32:56,688
-You're over here?
-Yeah, I'm over here with them.

547
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:02,533
We're waiting on Carmine.

548
00:33:02,702 --> 00:33:04,576
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

549
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:07,825
He was here before.
He had a suitcase, and then he left.

550
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,289
Carmine left?

551
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:14,042
He's gone?

552
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:16,210
He's not here?

553
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,222
Carmine's out?

554
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:25,016
I think he went across the street
or somewhere else or something.

555
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:31,150
Well, listen, good luck with the joint.

556
00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:33,441
-Thanks, Eddy.
-Lots of luck.

557
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:35,029
Good luck to you, too.

558
00:33:35,157 --> 00:33:36,948
CASHlER: They forgot to sign their papers.

559
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,702
They don't need those anymore.

560
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:44,116
SAM: Out of respect, guys
from other crews got away with a warning.

561
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,326
Everybody else, watch out.

562
00:33:47,588 --> 00:33:48,963
Like these yokels here...

563
00:33:49,089 --> 00:33:51,591
who never heard of Nicky
or the bosses back home.

564
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:54,047
They're the morons
who give you the most trouble.

565
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,296
We'd catch them
and they'd try to sneak back...

566
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:58,969
with beards and wigs and fake noses.

567
00:34:00,686 --> 00:34:03,521
You can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet.

568
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:06,227
Like this guy. He's betting lavender chips...

569
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,607
at $500 each with only one little problem.

570
00:34:08,779 --> 00:34:10,154
He's always guessed right.

571
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:17,116
If he wasn't so fucking greedy,
he'd have been tougher to spot.

572
00:34:17,247 --> 00:34:19,121
But in the end, they're all greedy.

573
00:34:36,811 --> 00:34:39,480
I saw that the dealer was weak,
but he wasn't in on it.

574
00:34:40,023 --> 00:34:41,850
He just wasn't protecting his hand.

575
00:34:42,151 --> 00:34:44,523
He was lifting his hole card way too high.

576
00:34:57,335 --> 00:35:00,585
Here's this guy
reading the dealer's hole card...

577
00:35:00,714 --> 00:35:03,585
and signaling his buddy at this table.

578
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:13,891
And that's just what these hustlers look for.

579
00:35:14,021 --> 00:35:17,022
They cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers...

580
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,723
the way lions look for weak antelope.

581
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:25,031
Operator, this is Mr. R.

582
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,732
Get me Armstrong and Friday
over to Pit 2 right away.

583
00:35:45,558 --> 00:35:47,847
BJ 19, second base, the beard.

584
00:35:49,229 --> 00:35:52,064
Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.

585
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:56,601
WAlTRESSES: [Singing] Happy birthday
to you

586
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,821
Happy birthday to you

587
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,073
Happy birthday, dear Jeff

588
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,955
Happy birthday to you

589
00:36:29,859 --> 00:36:31,139
GUARD: Man down!

590
00:36:32,278 --> 00:36:35,314
Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.

591
00:36:35,908 --> 00:36:38,446
He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.

592
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:43,790
SAM: They never know what hit them.

593
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:47,707
If and when they do find out
they got zapped by a cattle prod...

594
00:36:47,796 --> 00:36:50,121
they wish they really did have a heart attack.

595
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:59,348
Turns out this guy and his fucking pals
were knocking this place dead for years.

596
00:36:59,477 --> 00:37:01,386
GUARD 1 : He's wired.
HUSTLER: What are you doing?

597
00:37:01,479 --> 00:37:03,187
GUARD 1 : There it is. That's it.

598
00:37:03,314 --> 00:37:05,271
GUARD 2: Cheater's justice.
HUSTLER: Oh, God!

599
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:08,099
No!

600
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:13,276
SAM: I wanted everybody to
know that things were changed around here.

601
00:37:14,452 --> 00:37:17,786
We had to make an example of these pricks
that the party was over.

602
00:37:18,707 --> 00:37:19,905
I'm just curious.

603
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,538
I saw you shuffling your checks
with your right hand.

604
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,625
-Can you do that with both hands?
-No.

605
00:37:26,091 --> 00:37:28,214
SAM: You can't do it with both hands?
HUSTLER: No, sir.

606
00:37:28,844 --> 00:37:31,715
-Can you do it with your left hand?
-I never tried.

607
00:37:32,348 --> 00:37:35,017
-So, you're a righty.
-Yeah.

608
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:46,774
Now you're gonna have to learn
with your left hand.

609
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:50,444
-It's $100,000, $1 10,000 I think.
-Yes, it is.

610
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:51,650
Okay.

611
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,285
Hi.

612
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:58,831
That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

613
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:02,505
Why don't I take him
over to the office and verify it?

614
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:03,670
A little privacy.

615
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:07,336
By the way, send over
a nice bottle of champagne on ice.

616
00:38:07,472 --> 00:38:09,180
CASHlER: Sure will.
BILLY: Real special.

617
00:38:09,307 --> 00:38:12,142
By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert,
casino manager.

618
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,227
BILLY: Having a good time?
HUSTLER 2: Yes.

619
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:16,347
You want to count the money in privacy.

620
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:19,645
HUSTLER 2: I have a plane to catch.
Can I get my winnings?

621
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,362
Look what they did to my hand, man.

622
00:38:27,912 --> 00:38:29,489
SAM: I'm gonna give you a choice:

623
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,164
You can have the money and the hammer,
or you can walk out of here.

624
00:38:33,294 --> 00:38:35,333
-What do you want?
-I wanna get out of here.

625
00:38:35,546 --> 00:38:38,547
Tell your friends what happens
if they fuck around here.

626
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,585
-I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake.
-You're fucking right.

627
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:46,256
SAM: If you come back, either one
of you, we'll break your fucking heads.

628
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:49,927
You see that fucking saw? We're gonna
use it. We don't fuck around here.

629
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,052
SAM: Got it?
HUSTLER 2: Yes.

630
00:38:51,231 --> 00:38:52,725
-Get out of here.
-Thank you.

631
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:56,980
Throw him out in the alley.
Tell the cops he got hit by a car.

632
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,238
SAM: Within no time,
everything was set in place.

633
00:38:59,407 --> 00:39:02,610
We got rid of the freelance scamsters,
the pro was way up...

634
00:39:02,786 --> 00:39:05,870
the gods were happy,
or as happy as the gods can ever be.

635
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,365
And I decided to complicate my life.

636
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:10,083
For a guy who likes sure things...

637
00:39:10,211 --> 00:39:12,963
I was about to bet the rest of my life
on a real long shot.

638
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,750
We're not getting any younger.

639
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:16,425
Don't you think it's time?

640
00:39:16,969 --> 00:39:20,504
Aren't you getting tired of all this shit?
Banging around, hustling around?

641
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,807
-Are you trying to handicap me?
-I'm gonna do you one better.

642
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:26,228
I'm trying to marry you.

643
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,013
SAM: You wanna marry me?

644
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:32,110
SAM: I'm serious.

645
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,779
I wanna settle down. I want a family.

646
00:39:36,951 --> 00:39:39,489
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

647
00:39:39,954 --> 00:39:42,160
I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

648
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:43,618
You don't know me.

649
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,288
You've known me two, three months.
What do you know?

650
00:39:46,587 --> 00:39:48,626
I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

651
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,424
I know you well enough
to know that I really love you very much.

652
00:39:53,595 --> 00:39:55,753
I can't think of anybody better to be with.

653
00:39:56,431 --> 00:39:58,222
I don't feel like waiting anymore.

654
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:03,809
You know a lot of happily married people?
'Cause I don't.

655
00:40:05,442 --> 00:40:06,521
I know all that.

656
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:12,813
I care about you.

657
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,698
But I just don't have
those kind of feelings for you.

658
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,742
I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

659
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,671
SAM: All right.
GINGER: Understand?

660
00:40:28,844 --> 00:40:30,172
GINGER: I'm sorry.

661
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,127
No....

662
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,103
That can grow.

663
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,350
As long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

664
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:44,814
I'm realistic. I can accept that.

665
00:40:45,864 --> 00:40:47,572
SAM: What is love anyway?

666
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:50,278
SAM: It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.

667
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:53,246
It's a caring from one person to another.

668
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,457
And if we could set up
some kind of foundation...

669
00:40:58,253 --> 00:40:59,996
based on that mutual respect...

670
00:41:01,382 --> 00:41:04,087
I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me...

671
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,968
that I could live with that.

672
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,051
If it doesn't work out...

673
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,806
if it doesn't play out,
then what happens to me?

674
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,106
I'm doing well now.
I'm gonna do even better.

675
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,150
So whatever happens...

676
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,651
if it doesn't work out between us...

677
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:23,352
I'll make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

678
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:25,608
If there are kids, especially...

679
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:28,362
I'll take care of you better
than you'd imagine.

680
00:41:28,496 --> 00:41:30,821
GINGER: What are you pitching me?
SAM: Just what I said.

681
00:41:32,167 --> 00:41:34,492
You'll be set up for the rest of your life.

682
00:41:35,087 --> 00:41:36,462
That I can promise you.

683
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:42,458
Want to take a chance?

684
00:41:52,566 --> 00:41:55,437
SAM: When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories...

685
00:41:55,569 --> 00:41:58,238
but I didn't give a fuck.
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.

686
00:41:58,364 --> 00:41:59,443
I can change her.

687
00:42:02,077 --> 00:42:03,535
NICKY: It was typical Ace.

688
00:42:03,662 --> 00:42:06,912
He invited the biggest people in town.
He knew they'd show.

689
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:09,413
He knew they all wanted
something from him.

690
00:42:09,544 --> 00:42:12,747
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride.
Even Ginger.

691
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,708
With her, he still covered his bets.

692
00:42:14,842 --> 00:42:17,878
They had to have the baby first,
before they could get married.

693
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:20,461
He even made us watch Amy
for a few days...

694
00:42:20,598 --> 00:42:22,056
when they went on their honeymoon.

695
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:23,850
I didn't mind, we loved the kid.

696
00:42:28,483 --> 00:42:29,941
LESTER: Can you feel my eyes on you?

697
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:33,604
Can you feel me look into your heart?

698
00:42:35,032 --> 00:42:37,190
Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?

699
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:42,205
Can you feel me in you?

700
00:42:44,293 --> 00:42:45,324
In your heart?

701
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:49,797
Don't make me come there.

702
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,425
Answer me.

703
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:54,344
GINGER: [Crying] I love you.

704
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:56,593
Baby, do you know that I love you, too?

705
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,841
GINGER: No, Lester.
LESTER: Do you know that?

706
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:00,049
GINGER: Yes.

707
00:43:00,395 --> 00:43:03,431
This is the best thing I can do
for my life right now.

708
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,763
That's right.

709
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,643
So it's going to be okay.

710
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:07,975
Promise?

711
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:10,943
I wish you all the luck in the world.

712
00:43:11,741 --> 00:43:13,817
GINGER: You do?
LESTER: Yeah, I do.

713
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:17,198
It's the best thing you can do right now.

714
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:19,165
I mean this.

715
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:21,374
You have real security.

716
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:25,328
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated
just right in Vegas.

717
00:43:25,424 --> 00:43:27,713
Come on. This is great for us.

718
00:43:28,218 --> 00:43:30,923
I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.

719
00:43:33,141 --> 00:43:34,683
I'm looking at you right now.

720
00:43:35,936 --> 00:43:38,771
I'm seeing you for the very first time,
right this minute.

721
00:43:39,356 --> 00:43:41,265
I'm saying I can feel my heart click.

722
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:43,944
I see you 14 years old.

723
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:46,193
I see you the first second I ever saw you.

724
00:43:47,532 --> 00:43:49,987
I see you, long-legged little colt...

725
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:52,235
stupid braces on your teeth.

726
00:43:52,371 --> 00:43:55,657
Okay, then.
LESTER: Every time I see you,
that's what I see.

727
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:58,748
Talk to you later. Bye.

728
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:07,671
-You all right?
-Yeah.

729
00:44:09,892 --> 00:44:11,090
Why are you crying?

730
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:14,802
I'm not crying.

731
00:44:20,529 --> 00:44:23,815
-Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
-I'm okay.

732
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:30,039
You just have to understand.

733
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,710
I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

734
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,754
I just wanted to say goodbye.

735
00:44:39,342 --> 00:44:40,504
I just....

736
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,846
I think I have a right to do that.

737
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:49,592
GINGER: Okay?

738
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:50,808
It's all right.

739
00:44:52,608 --> 00:44:54,482
That part of your life is over with.

740
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:57,069
SAM: Right?
GINGER: Yeah.

741
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,437
You're with me now.

742
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,617
-Yeah.
-Right?

743
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:07,907
SAM: You're sure?
GINGER: Yeah.

744
00:45:15,635 --> 00:45:18,671
SAM: Want to go? Let's go back in.
GINGER: Okay.

745
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:39,886
GINGER: It's great.

746
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,146
GINGER: It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

747
00:45:53,942 --> 00:45:55,981
You brought all my stuff!

748
00:45:56,278 --> 00:45:57,558
I can't....

749
00:45:59,197 --> 00:46:00,739
Try it on. It's yours.

750
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,902
You're kidding.

751
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,318
My God.

752
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:09,660
-What is it?
-It's chinchilla.

753
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:11,791
It's so soft.

754
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:14,669
Nice, isn't it?

755
00:46:19,509 --> 00:46:21,252
No one's ever been so nice to me.

756
00:46:33,439 --> 00:46:34,814
GINGER: Oh, my God!

757
00:46:36,942 --> 00:46:40,227
Do you think it's too much
if I wear these all on the same day?

758
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,359
You can do whatever you want.

759
00:46:42,656 --> 00:46:45,146
Do I keep my promises
or do I keep my promises?

760
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:48,237
You're so wonderful.
The jewelry's not so bad either.

761
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:52,070
We shouldn't keep this in the house.
We gotta put it in the bank.

762
00:46:52,249 --> 00:46:54,371
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?

763
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:56,495
Pay attention to me.

764
00:46:58,129 --> 00:47:00,287
What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

765
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:03,296
All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

766
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:05,798
Money, this, doesn't
mean anything without trust.

767
00:47:06,095 --> 00:47:08,301
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

768
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:22,808
SAM: With over $1 million in
cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas...

769
00:47:22,903 --> 00:47:25,109
only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.

770
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,483
She loved that shit.

771
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:30,734
But a guy in my line of work
has to have a lot of payoff cash around.

772
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,907
Crooked cops and kidnappers,
they don't take checks.

773
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:36,578
Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?

774
00:47:36,667 --> 00:47:39,157
SAM: So I put $2 million cash
in a Los Angeles bank...

775
00:47:39,294 --> 00:47:42,081
under the name
of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.

776
00:47:42,547 --> 00:47:45,334
This was strictly
my shakedown and kidnapping money.

777
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:54,306
Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet
when I needed the money most...

778
00:47:54,475 --> 00:47:59,101
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash
that could get me back alive.

779
00:48:11,742 --> 00:48:13,533
This is just a signature card.

780
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:17,612
Once she signs, she'll be the only person...

781
00:48:17,748 --> 00:48:20,951
to have total access to the box,
no one else, including myself?

782
00:48:21,293 --> 00:48:23,618
BANKER: That's right. That's the way
you wanted it.

783
00:48:24,796 --> 00:48:26,420
Sam, let me ask you a question.

784
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:29,298
You must really trust your wife.

785
00:48:32,345 --> 00:48:33,887
Sure I do. Why?

786
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:37,219
It's good. It's just unusual.

787
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,221
To tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

788
00:48:55,827 --> 00:48:58,531
SAM: With Ginger and the money
in place, I felt covered.

789
00:48:58,704 --> 00:49:01,194
To play it safe, I switched job titles again...

790
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:04,493
and made myself
Food and Beverage Director.

791
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:07,117
This way nobody would bother me
about a license.

792
00:49:07,296 --> 00:49:09,253
Vegas was like a dream for me.

793
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:12,216
Trouble was Nicky was dreaming
of his own kind of Vegas.

794
00:49:12,301 --> 00:49:15,551
NICKY: I put money out on the street
charging three points a week.

795
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:16,793
Juice to the dealers.

796
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:20,298
-Don't make us look for you.
-You won't have to look for me.

797
00:49:20,392 --> 00:49:22,265
I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

798
00:49:22,394 --> 00:49:24,931
NICKY: They were degenerate
gamblers, coke freaks.

799
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:28,431
In no time, I had half the dealers
in the Tangiers in my pocket.

800
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,692
Then, the next thing I did, I started
busting out high-stakes poker players.

801
00:49:33,822 --> 00:49:35,280
SAM: It was so obvious.

802
00:49:35,407 --> 00:49:38,526
All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics,
they were signal-happy.

803
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:40,319
I'm gonna open for $500.

804
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:41,947
SAM: Signaling back and forth.

805
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,954
Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.

806
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,707
I didn't want any of those agents
near my place.

807
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:54,294
-Four aces.
-I can't believe this.

808
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:58,171
GAMBLER 2: If I didn't have bad luck,
I wouldn't have any luck.

809
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:03,175
SAM: I wished Nicky and his whole crew
would just get lost.

810
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:05,681
What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?

811
00:50:05,811 --> 00:50:08,515
Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.
I can't do that.

812
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:10,597
Gaming agents are all over the place.

813
00:50:10,732 --> 00:50:13,020
I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?

814
00:50:13,151 --> 00:50:16,021
You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.

815
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:20,064
NICKY: Ace was so worried
about his casino...

816
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:22,951
he forgot what we were doing out here
in the first place.

817
00:50:23,536 --> 00:50:25,908
A million times,
I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:

818
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:27,740
"This is Las Vegas.

819
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:31,077
"We're supposed to be out here robbing,
you dumb fucking hebe. "

820
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:38,672
I don't give a shit who he's connected to.

821
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,633
Tell him to take his feet off the table.

822
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,045
Does he think
this is a goddamn sawdust joint?

823
00:50:44,098 --> 00:50:46,635
Sir, would you mind
taking your feet off the table...

824
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,268
and put your shoes on, please?

825
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:50,844
Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.

826
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,849
Fucking asshole won't budge.

827
00:50:55,943 --> 00:50:57,437
Call security.

828
00:51:00,864 --> 00:51:02,322
How are you?

829
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:03,981
Good. How are you?

830
00:51:04,117 --> 00:51:07,735
Do me a favor. Want to take your feet off
the table and put your shoes on?

831
00:51:07,871 --> 00:51:09,151
Fuck you.

832
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:15,501
I want you to exit this guy
off the premises, off his feet...

833
00:51:15,629 --> 00:51:18,084
and use his head to open the fucking door.

834
00:51:18,214 --> 00:51:21,333
Sir, you're gonna have to leave.
You mind coming with us outside?

835
00:51:22,302 --> 00:51:24,294
Bullshit. I ain't going anywhere with you.

836
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:26,468
GUARD: Bullshit. You're out of here.
MAN: Fuck you!

837
00:51:27,098 --> 00:51:29,933
MAN: You know who you're fucking with?
Do you?

838
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:33,179
You fucking faggot!
Do you know who you're fucking with?

839
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:35,021
MAN: Leave me alone!

840
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:37,682
GUARD: Come on!
MAN: You gotta be kidding me!

841
00:51:38,651 --> 00:51:41,023
SAM: Sure enough, an hour later,
I get the call.

842
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:44,936
Ace, what happened over there?
Did you know that guy was with me?

843
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:47,196
I didn't know that. You know what he did?

844
00:51:47,326 --> 00:51:50,741
I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to fuck myself.

845
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:52,828
SAM: Then he called me a faggot.
NICKY: What?

846
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:55,204
SAM: I threw that cocksucker out.
NICKY: Come here.

847
00:51:55,876 --> 00:51:58,580
You called my friend a faggot?
Told him to go fuck himself?

848
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,125
Is that what you did?
Tell him to go fuck himself?

849
00:52:02,007 --> 00:52:03,549
NICKY: [On phone] You fucking hick, you!

850
00:52:06,678 --> 00:52:08,551
NICKY: You go over there. You apologize.

851
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,506
NICKY: You better hope he lets you back in.

852
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,806
If you get out of line again,
I'll smash your head so hard...

853
00:52:13,893 --> 00:52:17,059
you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on. Fucking hick.

854
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:21,807
Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

855
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:24,480
He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

856
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,778
He's already very sorry.

857
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:29,734
But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in...

858
00:52:29,825 --> 00:52:32,280
I swear he'll never get out of line again.

859
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:34,695
If he does it again, he's out for good.

860
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,952
I'll never let him in the place again.

861
00:52:37,082 --> 00:52:38,624
NICKY: I'm sorry about this.

862
00:52:39,126 --> 00:52:41,830
All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.

863
00:52:43,005 --> 00:52:46,373
You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

864
00:52:46,508 --> 00:52:50,719
You shit-kicking, stinky,
horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!

865
00:52:50,846 --> 00:52:53,930
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.

866
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:56,594
NICKY: Go over and apologize.
MAN: Nicky, I'm sorry.

867
00:53:00,939 --> 00:53:03,180
NICKY: Ace could be a very touchy guy.

868
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:05,522
Especially when he got bigger in town.

869
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,813
Like when he hired Jonathan and David
away from the Palace...

870
00:53:08,947 --> 00:53:12,315
by building them a new stage
and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.

871
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:15,362
But, I tell you,
he knew how to bring in the crowds.

872
00:53:15,495 --> 00:53:17,534
He knew all the fucking angles.

873
00:53:17,663 --> 00:53:20,153
He brought the whole Femme Fatale show
from Paris...

874
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:23,494
but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

875
00:53:23,627 --> 00:53:27,671
He had to weigh them once a week
so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.

876
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:29,422
You're still eight pounds over.

877
00:53:29,758 --> 00:53:32,213
-What's the reason for this?
-Mr. Rothstein, sir--

878
00:53:32,344 --> 00:53:35,547
Never mind the "sir."
Why is she eight pounds over?

879
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:37,678
I'm trying to use respect.

880
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:40,133
Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

881
00:53:40,227 --> 00:53:43,845
Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

882
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:47,225
All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

883
00:53:47,317 --> 00:53:51,361
I don't know why. She's frightened
if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.

884
00:53:51,446 --> 00:53:54,150
That's right, she will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--

885
00:53:54,282 --> 00:53:56,321
-It's been our policy--
-Stop everything.

886
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:59,404
AGENT: She's an institution.
SAM: That's the problem. She's lazy.

887
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:01,655
NICKY: I gotta give the guy credit.

888
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:03,995
I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

889
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:07,375
This is the only town in the country
where a bookie joint is legit.

890
00:54:07,503 --> 00:54:09,578
So why not take advantage, right?

891
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:12,169
So he took bookie joints off the street...

892
00:54:12,258 --> 00:54:14,131
and opened them up inside the casino.

893
00:54:14,677 --> 00:54:16,883
Within a few years, he had...

894
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:19,763
every casino on The Strip
trying to copy off of him.

895
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,597
SAM: Between my innovations...

896
00:54:25,104 --> 00:54:27,641
and Nicky's dedication to his job...

897
00:54:30,192 --> 00:54:32,765
I soon had the best operation on The Strip.

898
00:54:36,365 --> 00:54:39,152
Watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you.

899
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,617
Why, somebody is complaining?

900
00:54:41,703 --> 00:54:44,240
I'm hearing things from security.
They're all ex-cops.

901
00:54:44,331 --> 00:54:46,952
The sheriff wants to put you
in the Black Book.

902
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:49,122
That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.

903
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:51,285
There's two names in it
for the whole country...

904
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,164
and one of them is still Al Capone.

905
00:54:53,298 --> 00:54:56,049
They put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

906
00:54:56,175 --> 00:54:58,630
You won't be able to walk into a casino.

907
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:01,508
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.

908
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,509
I'm just telling you.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

909
00:55:11,023 --> 00:55:13,560
PHOTOGRAPHER: Mrs. Rothstein,
straight ahead. Very nice. Thank you.

910
00:55:19,156 --> 00:55:21,231
PHILIP: For his hard work and dedication...

911
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:24,611
and the new life blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas...

912
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:27,662
Sam has established himself
as an indispensable member...

913
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:29,828
of the gaming community.

914
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,538
As the head of
the Tangiers Gaming Corporation...

915
00:55:32,669 --> 00:55:35,041
it's my pleasure to welcome
Sam Rothstein...

916
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:36,878
to the Vegas Valley Country Club.

917
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:46,974
SAM: Back home, they'd put me in jail
for what I'm doing.

918
00:55:47,058 --> 00:55:49,299
But out here, they're giving me awards.

919
00:55:49,435 --> 00:55:53,812
It is with great pleasure that I accept
this certificate of appreciation...

920
00:55:53,898 --> 00:55:56,435
from the Charitable Foundations
of Greater Las Vegas.

921
00:55:57,777 --> 00:55:59,354
Congratulations, sweetheart.

922
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,024
Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

923
00:56:03,532 --> 00:56:07,399
SAM: But my greatest pleasure
was watching my wife work the room.

924
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:11,163
They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

925
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,615
She could be the most charming woman
you ever saw.

926
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:15,293
People loved to be around her.

927
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:18,051
You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

928
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,892
LADY: We'd love to have her there.
3:00, Saturday.

929
00:56:21,728 --> 00:56:23,436
-Yes, okay.
-Great.

930
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:25,309
SAM: She made everybody feel good.

931
00:56:31,615 --> 00:56:34,616
-Congratulations, Sam.
-Thanks.

932
00:56:35,245 --> 00:56:37,321
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?

933
00:56:40,001 --> 00:56:43,869
You're one of the most gorgeous women
I've seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.

934
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:49,005
Thanks for that compliment.

935
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:53,847
SAM: He was a young kid
from the casino. Nice kid. Bright boy.

936
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:57,139
What balls on this fucking kid.
The next day I fired him.

937
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:02,524
Ginger had that effect on people.
I think she even encouraged them.

938
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:04,355
GINGER: Do you wanna see this one?

939
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:10,159
GINGER: Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

940
00:57:10,831 --> 00:57:12,409
SAM: But as much as they loved her...

941
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:13,620
GINGER: Fabulous.

942
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:15,625
...they didn't know what really moved her.

943
00:57:15,712 --> 00:57:18,037
GINGER: Look at this.

944
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:19,787
GINGER: Daddy gave me....

945
00:57:19,925 --> 00:57:24,054
SAM: With Ginger happy, I was
able to concentrate on what I knew best.

946
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:26,964
Loose machines are right back over there.

947
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:30,226
What are they doing back there?
You can't even see them.

948
00:57:30,605 --> 00:57:31,554
Okay.

949
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,806
What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

950
00:57:33,943 --> 00:57:37,395
These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.

951
00:57:37,531 --> 00:57:40,485
No wonder the drop is off.
The action is in the front.

952
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:42,658
-Bring them up front.
-All right, I will.

953
00:57:42,787 --> 00:57:45,907
Listen carefully.
There are three ways of doing things here.

954
00:57:46,041 --> 00:57:49,576
The right way, the wrong way,
and the way that I do it.

955
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:52,548
-Understand?
-I do understand. I'll get right on it.

956
00:57:52,675 --> 00:57:55,510
-Thank you.
-Don't thank me. Just do it.

957
00:57:55,637 --> 00:57:59,053
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

958
00:57:59,224 --> 00:58:01,217
Dang, you are right. I'm so sorry.

959
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:06,186
SAM: So I ended up working 18-hour days.

960
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,728
Ginger was the one who wound up
enjoying the best of Vegas.

961
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:12,650
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.

962
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:15,108
What did you say
to that fucking jerk, anyway?

963
00:58:15,411 --> 00:58:17,700
I told him that I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

964
00:58:19,375 --> 00:58:21,581
You might as well get something out of it.

965
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:28,541
SAM: It wasn't long before what I was afraid
was gonna happen, happened.

966
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:32,219
Nicky managed to get himself banned
from every casino in Vegas.

967
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:36,299
From then on, I couldn't be seen talking
to him anywhere in or near Vegas.

968
00:58:36,437 --> 00:58:38,264
NICKY: What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

969
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,815
"...detrimental to gaming and...

970
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,435
"he will be ejected from
any casino in Las Vegas.

971
00:58:43,905 --> 00:58:48,366
"And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000...

972
00:58:48,494 --> 00:58:50,154
"every time he shows up."

973
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:53,331
-You believe this shit?
-Yeah, you got banned.

974
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:57,121
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation."

975
00:58:57,338 --> 00:58:58,797
Motherfucker.

976
00:59:01,469 --> 00:59:04,340
-Is there any way around this?
-No, there's no way.

977
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:08,305
Let's say, for instance...

978
00:59:08,894 --> 00:59:12,513
I want to go into the restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino...

979
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:14,309
to get one of those sandwiches I like?

980
00:59:14,443 --> 00:59:17,195
Forget it. You can't even
set foot in the parking lot.

981
00:59:18,365 --> 00:59:19,989
That's how serious it is.

982
00:59:23,371 --> 00:59:26,242
-in other words, I'm fucked?
-in so many words, yes.

983
00:59:26,625 --> 00:59:30,125
SAM: It didn't sink into his head
about the Black Book and what it meant.

984
00:59:30,254 --> 00:59:33,291
Not being able to go into a casino
is just one thing...

985
00:59:33,383 --> 00:59:38,211
but being in this book etched your name
into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.

986
00:59:38,306 --> 00:59:41,675
You're listed in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.

987
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,060
I gotta do something.
They ain't getting rid of me.

988
00:59:45,857 --> 00:59:48,811
They're not getting rid of me.
I'm staying here. Fuck them.

989
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:57,825
NICKY: So once they pulled that shit...

990
00:59:57,914 --> 01:00:01,117
I started doing my own things in Vegas
nobody had thought of doing.

991
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:05,712
To keep an eye on things, I brought in
my kid brother and some desperados...

992
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,506
from back home and started knocking over
high rollers, casino bosses...

993
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:11,843
bookmakers, anybody right here in town.

994
01:00:11,931 --> 01:00:14,849
I had a good fucking crew going for me,
I'll tell you that.

995
01:00:15,144 --> 01:00:18,347
I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.

996
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:23,361
Jack Hardy worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

997
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:27,736
Then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy could bypass any alarm for me.

998
01:00:29,245 --> 01:00:30,739
It was like old times.

999
01:00:31,414 --> 01:00:34,534
I opened up my own jewelry store, too.
The Gold Rush.

1000
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:38,498
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist,
just for the fun of it.

1001
01:00:39,257 --> 01:00:41,962
I didn't like the people
I was ripping off looking at me...

1002
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:44,300
so I turned their fucking pictures around.

1003
01:00:45,098 --> 01:00:47,470
NICKY: What's taking so long?
JACK: This is a motherfucker!

1004
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:51,889
It's working.
NICKY: Learn to open these
instead of taking them.

1005
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,181
NICKY: These stones got
a lot of niggers in them.

1006
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:56,518
If that fucking Pepe's
switching stones on us...

1007
01:00:56,654 --> 01:01:00,023
he better take a fucking camel
back to Nigeria.

1008
01:01:01,368 --> 01:01:03,444
-They're in Penthouse "K."
-Check in alone?

1009
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:05,370
-They checked in alone.
-Are they out now?

1010
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:07,491
-Yes. Don't worry.
-All right. Thanks.

1011
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:10,539
SAM: He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen...

1012
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:13,754
-You got to hurry.
-Okay.

1013
01:01:13,842 --> 01:01:16,298
-...valet parkers...
-They're just checking in now.

1014
01:01:16,428 --> 01:01:17,970
-I'll tell him.
-...pit bosses...

1015
01:01:18,097 --> 01:01:20,303
Room 1230 at the Scirocco.

1016
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:22,307
-1 230. Right.
-...secretaries.

1017
01:01:22,436 --> 01:01:25,105
-Mint condition coins.
-Mint condition? All right.

1018
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:26,974
SAM: They all got a piece of the score.

1019
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:28,567
MAN: Car's coming.

1020
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:34,699
SAM: They were very careful.

1021
01:01:35,202 --> 01:01:38,369
They always bypassed the alarms,
or else, if not...

1022
01:01:38,497 --> 01:01:42,080
they'd drill enough holes to knock through
the walls with a sledgehammer.

1023
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:45,747
Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

1024
01:01:46,507 --> 01:01:48,879
Nobody out there was expecting
a guy like him.

1025
01:01:50,888 --> 01:01:53,640
For Nicky,
Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.

1026
01:01:53,766 --> 01:01:55,889
I just got a shipment of diamonds
from Israel.

1027
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:59,015
NICKY: What the fuck did they
expect from me? I had to earn, didn't I?

1028
01:02:00,024 --> 01:02:03,191
-This diamond has flaws in it.
-There's no flaws in it.

1029
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:06,191
Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 25 years.

1030
01:02:06,282 --> 01:02:09,532
You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws in this diamond.

1031
01:02:09,661 --> 01:02:11,285
NICKY: When we got local merch...

1032
01:02:11,372 --> 01:02:14,658
we'd usually send it to Palm Springs,
or Arizona, L.A.

1033
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:17,837
I had a couple of sand niggers out there.
You know, Arabs.

1034
01:02:17,963 --> 01:02:20,501
Are you gonna have a meeting
or buy some diamonds?

1035
01:02:20,592 --> 01:02:22,798
I know his language. I'm talking with him.

1036
01:02:22,886 --> 01:02:24,713
$40,000, you buy the whole package.

1037
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:26,887
$20,000. That's my final offer.

1038
01:02:27,058 --> 01:02:31,008
He suddenly talks English.
Let's talk turkey. $25,000.

1039
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:36,142
NICKY: I actually turned my bedroom into
a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.

1040
01:02:39,073 --> 01:02:42,573
I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush
in case we got raided by the cops...

1041
01:02:42,702 --> 01:02:44,410
or if my crew got cute.

1042
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,120
I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1043
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:50,162
She fell asleep on the couch
watching TV every night.

1044
01:02:50,587 --> 01:02:54,288
This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

1045
01:02:54,467 --> 01:02:57,552
Actually, I couldn't,
because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.

1046
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:00,217
The bosses were making
so much money with the casinos...

1047
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:02,638
that they didn't want anybody
making any waves.

1048
01:03:04,855 --> 01:03:06,978
You've all given your crew a piece of that?

1049
01:03:07,066 --> 01:03:08,644
I took care of everybody.

1050
01:03:08,902 --> 01:03:12,817
NICKY: That's why there was no real
organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.

1051
01:03:13,908 --> 01:03:16,530
But how much cash could I bury
in my closet, right?

1052
01:03:16,661 --> 01:03:18,701
You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do...

1053
01:03:18,831 --> 01:03:20,491
that in a venture of this kind...

1054
01:03:20,625 --> 01:03:22,997
you must be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

1055
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:27,833
NICKY: I put some money in legitimate
deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.

1056
01:03:28,384 --> 01:03:30,922
-You will try to push it through, won't you?
-Yes.

1057
01:03:31,013 --> 01:03:33,219
You got to understand,
I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

1058
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:36,884
NICKY: Then I put more money
in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.

1059
01:03:37,145 --> 01:03:38,604
DOMINICK: Is that the last one?
COOK: Yeah.

1060
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:41,019
NICKY: I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it.

1061
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:44,606
Fuckers.

1062
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:50,952
DOMINICK: Here you go, guys.

1063
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:53,285
-Thanks a lot.
-Enjoy it. Have a good time.

1064
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:55,492
-Choke on it, motherfucker.
-Hi, Dom.

1065
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:56,825
How you doing?

1066
01:03:57,003 --> 01:04:00,787
SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

1067
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,582
And over the years,
he always made money with them.

1068
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,089
In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

1069
01:04:07,224 --> 01:04:11,305
He had politicians, showgirls
and movie stars hanging out all over.

1070
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,972
That show at The Flamingo
gets better and better.

1071
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:17,353
By the way, Sammy said whenever
you have a minute, give him a call.

1072
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:20,359
-Made you a messenger, too?
-I'll do anything for a buck.

1073
01:04:20,491 --> 01:04:23,860
-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner.
-Thanks.

1074
01:04:23,995 --> 01:04:27,696
SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky
liked most was the showgirls.

1075
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:29,909
To them, Nicky was the movie star.

1076
01:04:30,044 --> 01:04:32,831
-You walk past me?
-This is Shelly.

1077
01:04:33,006 --> 01:04:34,963
-Hi, Shelly. How are you?
-Hi.

1078
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:36,545
This is Stacy.

1079
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:39,882
-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on.
-All right.

1080
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:42,506
Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

1081
01:04:42,602 --> 01:04:46,137
NICKY: Come on, I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

1082
01:04:46,231 --> 01:04:49,481
I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

1083
01:04:49,610 --> 01:04:53,145
You can always tell a great kitchen
like ours because of the milk-fed veal.

1084
01:04:53,407 --> 01:04:56,112
That's the secret.
See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

1085
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:59,282
Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

1086
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:03,911
Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.

1087
01:05:04,045 --> 01:05:06,583
NICKY: It'll never ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

1088
01:05:07,591 --> 01:05:10,545
AL: I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

1089
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,923
A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.

1090
01:05:14,058 --> 01:05:16,098
-That's what I did.
-Yeah?

1091
01:05:16,435 --> 01:05:18,143
You call yourself a man?

1092
01:05:18,271 --> 01:05:22,601
You know you're a lying lowlife,
motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?

1093
01:05:22,735 --> 01:05:25,357
You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

1094
01:05:25,572 --> 01:05:27,481
I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...

1095
01:05:27,616 --> 01:05:29,609
and buy groceries, put the heat on.

1096
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:33,245
You know your wife called Frankie
and told him the fucking heat's off?

1097
01:05:33,415 --> 01:05:35,787
You didn't gamble that money?
Can you tell me that?

1098
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,502
-No, you didn't?
-I didn't.

1099
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:40,790
Don't fuck with me, Al!
Don't make a fuck out of me.

1100
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:44,005
You wanna make a fool out of me?
You didn't gamble?

1101
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:48,677
Tell me you gambled the money and
I'll give you the money to put the heat on!

1102
01:05:49,518 --> 01:05:50,798
Did you gamble?

1103
01:05:55,526 --> 01:05:56,985
Fucking degenerate, you.

1104
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,267
Fucking kids at home.

1105
01:06:03,285 --> 01:06:05,159
Here. Get the fuck out of here.

1106
01:06:06,164 --> 01:06:07,788
AL: Thanks, Nick.
NICKY: Yeah, thanks.

1107
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:10,787
If I find out you fucked up,
I'll leave you where I find you.

1108
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:14,162
NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat?
NICKY JR.: Two.

1109
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:17,837
SAM: At around 6:30 a.m.,
when he finished his day...

1110
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:20,128
no matter where he was
or what he was doing...

1111
01:06:20,223 --> 01:06:23,343
he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

1112
01:06:23,811 --> 01:06:25,009
NICKY: I know you like this.

1113
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:29,147
NICKY: A little butter, right?
Not a lot. You know why, right?

1114
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,019
NICKY: Why?
NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

1115
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,904
What a smart kid you are.

1116
01:06:35,868 --> 01:06:36,864
NICKY: Okay, eat.

1117
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:40,115
NICKY: Every couple of weeks,
I sent Marino back to the bosses...

1118
01:06:40,206 --> 01:06:44,121
BACK HOME
with a piece of what I made.
Not a big piece, but what did they know?

1119
01:06:44,337 --> 01:06:47,837
They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't
know anybody who can see that far.

1120
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:50,168
Their drop was a truck stop garage...

1121
01:06:50,302 --> 01:06:53,387
where Remo and the guys
used to hang out and count their millions.

1122
01:06:54,391 --> 01:06:57,392
The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck.
They worked it out.

1123
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,394
Nicky sends his warmest regards.

1124
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,520
NICKY: I knew how to keep
the bosses happy.

1125
01:07:01,608 --> 01:07:04,977
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message...

1126
01:07:05,112 --> 01:07:08,731
I would carry things out to a "T."

1127
01:07:09,034 --> 01:07:13,079
Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed
to be the new maniac tough guy in town...

1128
01:07:13,206 --> 01:07:14,914
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1129
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:22,668
Here's a fucking guy
who kills two of Remo's guys...

1130
01:07:22,801 --> 01:07:26,502
and a poor fucking waitress
who was just working on her night off.

1131
01:07:29,643 --> 01:07:32,846
This guy's just begging
to be made an example of.

1132
01:07:33,231 --> 01:07:36,600
I want the names of all the other people
he had with him.

1133
01:07:36,735 --> 01:07:40,354
I don't care what you have to do to them
to get them. You understand?

1134
01:07:40,448 --> 01:07:41,646
FRANK: I'll take care of it.

1135
01:07:42,618 --> 01:07:45,821
NICKY: To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this fucking guy.

1136
01:07:45,955 --> 01:07:48,327
He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

1137
01:07:48,834 --> 01:07:50,577
This son of a bitch was tough.

1138
01:07:51,378 --> 01:07:54,545
For two days and two nights,
we beat the shit out of him.

1139
01:07:54,632 --> 01:07:56,672
We even stuck ice picks in his balls.

1140
01:07:56,927 --> 01:07:59,881
NICKY: Hope he gives me a name,
or I'll give him yours, Frank.

1141
01:08:00,014 --> 01:08:01,045
FRANK: Thanks a lot.

1142
01:08:01,182 --> 01:08:02,213
NICKY: But he never talked.

1143
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:04,017
NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.

1144
01:08:04,103 --> 01:08:06,808
NICKY: In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vice.

1145
01:08:08,024 --> 01:08:09,352
NICKY: Can you hear me?

1146
01:08:09,943 --> 01:08:12,814
Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.

1147
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:17,028
I'll squash your head like a grapefruit
if you don't give me a name.

1148
01:08:17,161 --> 01:08:19,486
NICKY: Don't make me do this.
Please, come on.

1149
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:21,745
Don't make me be a bad guy.

1150
01:08:23,502 --> 01:08:24,782
Fuck you.

1151
01:08:24,962 --> 01:08:27,999
Motherfucker. You believe this?
Two fucking days and nights.

1152
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:31,087
Fuck me? You motherfucker!

1153
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,925
Fuck my mother?
Is that what you're telling me?

1154
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:35,675
You motherfucker!

1155
01:08:37,477 --> 01:08:40,146
Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!

1156
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:41,642
Charlie M.

1157
01:08:42,484 --> 01:08:44,311
-Charlie M.
-Charlie M?

1158
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,322
You make me pop your eye out your head...

1159
01:08:47,407 --> 01:08:49,234
to protect that piece of shit?

1160
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,284
You dumb motherfucker!

1161
01:08:52,371 --> 01:08:54,079
Kill me, you fuck!

1162
01:08:54,707 --> 01:08:56,367
You motherfucker!

1163
01:08:56,877 --> 01:08:59,119
Frankie, do him a fucking favor.

1164
01:08:59,505 --> 01:09:01,877
SAM: Word got around that finally...

1165
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:04,090
there was a real gangster in town.

1166
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:07,296
Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

1167
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:17,017
SAM: Four reels, sevens across.
Three $15,000 jackpots.

1168
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,068
You have any idea what the odds are?

1169
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:21,105
It's gotta be in the millions. Maybe more.

1170
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,907
Three jackpots in 20 minutes?

1171
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,608
Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?

1172
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:28,373
It happened quick. Three guys won.
I didn't have a chance.

1173
01:09:28,541 --> 01:09:30,415
You didn't see the scam?

1174
01:09:30,544 --> 01:09:32,003
There's no way to determine that.

1175
01:09:32,087 --> 01:09:34,245
Yes, there is. An infallible way. They won!

1176
01:09:34,382 --> 01:09:37,051
It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.

1177
01:09:37,719 --> 01:09:40,637
You're pissing me off.
You're insulting my intelligence.

1178
01:09:40,765 --> 01:09:41,879
You think I'm an idiot?

1179
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:45,261
Somebody had to get into those machines
and set the reels.

1180
01:09:45,395 --> 01:09:48,182
The probability on one machine
is a million and a half to one.

1181
01:09:48,274 --> 01:09:51,643
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions. It can't happen.

1182
01:09:51,778 --> 01:09:53,438
SAM: What's the matter with you?

1183
01:09:53,572 --> 01:09:56,822
Didn't you see you were being set up
on the second win?

1184
01:09:56,951 --> 01:10:00,201
-You didn't see that?
-I think you're overreacting.

1185
01:10:00,331 --> 01:10:02,039
Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.

1186
01:10:02,166 --> 01:10:04,206
I've carried your ass ever since I got here.

1187
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:06,335
Get your things and get out of here.

1188
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:09,879
-You're firing me?
-I'm firing you.

1189
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:12,964
-You might regret this.
-I'll regret it if I keep you.

1190
01:10:13,097 --> 01:10:16,632
-This is not the way to treat people.
-If you didn't know about the scam...

1191
01:10:16,768 --> 01:10:19,520
you're too dumb to work here.
If you did, you were in on it.

1192
01:10:19,646 --> 01:10:21,603
Either way, you're out. Go on.

1193
01:10:23,777 --> 01:10:26,315
The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.

1194
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:29,401
You can't fire him.
His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.

1195
01:10:29,534 --> 01:10:33,484
Everyone out here with cowboy boots
is a commissioner or related to one.

1196
01:10:33,622 --> 01:10:34,997
I'm sick of this.

1197
01:10:35,124 --> 01:10:37,247
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge.

1198
01:10:37,377 --> 01:10:39,749
His brother-in-law runs
the County Commission.

1199
01:10:39,838 --> 01:10:41,795
There's gotta be a way to work him back in.

1200
01:10:41,966 --> 01:10:45,916
You're in the finances, upstairs.
You don't see what's going on.

1201
01:10:46,013 --> 01:10:48,848
I've got thousands of players.
I got 500 dealers.

1202
01:10:48,975 --> 01:10:51,680
They're all looking to rob me blind
24 hours a day.

1203
01:10:51,811 --> 01:10:55,014
I have to let them know I'm watching
all the details all the time.

1204
01:10:55,149 --> 01:10:57,771
That there is not one single thing
I will not catch.

1205
01:10:59,404 --> 01:11:01,693
SAM: Look at yours. Look at that.

1206
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,365
SAM: Look at this. There's nothing.

1207
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,451
Look how many blueberries your muffin has.

1208
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:09,285
-I have nothing.
-What are you talking about?

1209
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:12,127
If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1210
01:11:12,337 --> 01:11:13,535
PHILIP: Where are you going?

1211
01:11:15,508 --> 01:11:19,376
SAM: From now on, I want you to put an
equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1212
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:25,518
Do you know how long that will take?

1213
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:29,388
I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

1214
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,152
Just a little. That a girl.

1215
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,863
SAM: Wanna go to Mommy?
GINGER: Wanna come to Mommy?

1216
01:11:40,998 --> 01:11:42,789
It's all right, sweetheart.

1217
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,203
GINGER: I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1218
01:11:48,132 --> 01:11:49,840
-What do you need?
-Got her?

1219
01:11:52,053 --> 01:11:54,378
I need a lot. I need more than usual.

1220
01:11:54,473 --> 01:11:56,596
Why don't you take it out of your account?

1221
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:59,763
I would, it's just that...

1222
01:12:00,731 --> 01:12:03,187
I need more than that. I need $25,000.

1223
01:12:04,318 --> 01:12:05,777
$25,000?

1224
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,738
-For yourself?
-Yeah.

1225
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,069
SAM: Why do you need that much?

1226
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,902
What's the difference? I just need it.

1227
01:12:14,414 --> 01:12:17,914
I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money.
It's not a box of popcorn.

1228
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:20,625
We don't have to turn this into a big deal.

1229
01:12:20,756 --> 01:12:22,380
We don't have to have a fight.

1230
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,383
GINGER: It was important to me. Forget it.
Something I wanted to do.

1231
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:30,182
Who's fighting? Tell me what it's for.

1232
01:12:32,854 --> 01:12:34,728
Why can't you tell me what it's for?

1233
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:41,897
Now I want you to tell me.

1234
01:12:42,032 --> 01:12:45,900
My wife comes to me and asks me
for $25,000. Do you want a coat?

1235
01:12:46,037 --> 01:12:48,409
GINGER: No.
SAM: If you want a coat, you got it.

1236
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,114
It's not the money.
It's just, why do you want it?

1237
01:12:51,294 --> 01:12:52,872
Am I not entitled to ask that?

1238
01:12:53,004 --> 01:12:56,539
I've been independent all my life.
I never had to ask anybody for anything.

1239
01:12:56,634 --> 01:12:58,543
Now you're making me beg you for this.

1240
01:12:59,137 --> 01:13:02,055
-What are you talking about?
-Okay? And you're embarrassing me.

1241
01:13:02,140 --> 01:13:04,975
Why make me feel so bad?
SAM: You're asking me for $25,000.

1242
01:13:05,102 --> 01:13:08,471
I'm not out to make you feel bad.
I want to just be able to trust you.

1243
01:13:08,982 --> 01:13:10,180
It's about trust.

1244
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:13,977
I have to be able to trust you with my life.

1245
01:13:14,197 --> 01:13:15,572
Do you understand?

1246
01:13:17,076 --> 01:13:18,155
Can I trust you?

1247
01:13:26,212 --> 01:13:28,418
Can I trust you? Answer me.

1248
01:13:31,218 --> 01:13:32,297
You can trust me.

1249
01:13:32,428 --> 01:13:35,002
Good. So then you can tell me
what the money is for.

1250
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:58,620
She's leaving the bank now.

1251
01:13:59,962 --> 01:14:01,124
I'll follow her.

1252
01:14:02,466 --> 01:14:04,174
LESTER: What is that?

1253
01:14:04,593 --> 01:14:06,502
I know that look. What does that look mean?

1254
01:14:06,637 --> 01:14:08,096
GINGER: It means I got the money.

1255
01:14:27,413 --> 01:14:29,619
How are you doing? It's Lester, right?

1256
01:14:37,634 --> 01:14:40,090
From my recollection,
aren't you the card shark...

1257
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:44,718
the golf hustler,
the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1258
01:14:47,271 --> 01:14:48,765
SAM: If I'm wrong, correct me.

1259
01:14:48,857 --> 01:14:50,766
I never knew you to be a heist man.

1260
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:53,401
But if you are, you know what?

1261
01:14:54,614 --> 01:14:55,942
Here, take mine, too.

1262
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:59,108
Take it. You already have hers.

1263
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:01,492
She's my wife.

1264
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:03,905
SAM: Look at me.

1265
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:06,711
You did know that, didn't you?
You knew she's my wife?

1266
01:15:08,047 --> 01:15:10,585
SAM: Look at me.
LESTER: I know that.

1267
01:15:10,675 --> 01:15:11,706
SAM: You do, yeah?

1268
01:15:15,014 --> 01:15:16,722
If you ever come back again...

1269
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,895
to take her money, next time bring a pistol.

1270
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:22,646
That way you got a chance.

1271
01:15:22,941 --> 01:15:24,815
Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.

1272
01:15:26,278 --> 01:15:29,564
Now, you want to do me a favor?
Get out of here.

1273
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,370
I wanna be alone with my wife.
Get the fuck up and get out of here.

1274
01:15:40,463 --> 01:15:42,087
SAM: Fucking piece of shit.

1275
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,855
Remember when you called him that night
and said goodbye to him?

1276
01:15:56,190 --> 01:15:58,977
He didn't say, "Don't get married.
I'll be right down."

1277
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:01,151
-He didn't say that, did he?
-No, he didn't.

1278
01:16:01,238 --> 01:16:02,862
What did he say?

1279
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:08,824
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."

1280
01:16:09,874 --> 01:16:11,914
Come here. I want to show you something.

1281
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,925
GINGER: Make them stop it!

1282
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:36,107
It's not his fault! It's my fault!

1283
01:16:50,425 --> 01:16:51,919
THUG: Piece of shit.

1284
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:02,262
LESTER: Do it yourself,
you chickenshit cocksucker!

1285
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,774
He's such a prick.

1286
01:17:06,111 --> 01:17:08,269
He had some guy from the hotel
beat him up.

1287
01:17:09,156 --> 01:17:10,983
He didn't want to do it himself.

1288
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:13,525
He didn't want to get his own hands dirty.

1289
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,832
Why did he have to do that?

1290
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:19,658
Tell me.

1291
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:23,287
NICKY: It wasn't a nice thing to do--
GINGER: No shit.

1292
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:27,001
You gotta understand it. He doesn't know
if this guy is shaking you down.

1293
01:17:29,473 --> 01:17:32,178
I told him all about this guy
before we got married.

1294
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:35,347
-This is no fucking surprise.
-You did? I didn't know that.

1295
01:17:36,023 --> 01:17:39,226
He's just a friend of mine
I was trying to help. So what?

1296
01:17:41,154 --> 01:17:43,645
The first time I ever saw you guys together...

1297
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:46,116
I never saw him so happy.

1298
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:49,617
NICKY: I know he's a crazy Jew fuck
and everything...

1299
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:53,451
but I never seen him act like that
with anybody else.

1300
01:17:54,588 --> 01:17:57,589
I think he's crazy about you.
He really loves you.

1301
01:17:57,675 --> 01:17:59,418
NICKY: He does.
GINGER: Come on.

1302
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:01,795
I went into this with my eyes open.

1303
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:04,136
GINGER: I knew the bottom
could drop out any time.

1304
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:08,051
I'm a working girl. You don't think
I'm gonna go into a situation like this...

1305
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:10,430
if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?

1306
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:12,393
Sure, I can see that.

1307
01:18:13,695 --> 01:18:16,732
So he put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.

1308
01:18:17,408 --> 01:18:19,864
A lot of expensive jewelry?
About how much?

1309
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:21,954
You want to steal it?

1310
01:18:22,456 --> 01:18:26,324
No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...

1311
01:18:26,711 --> 01:18:29,167
how much he would put
into a thing like that.

1312
01:18:29,256 --> 01:18:32,091
I'm told it's worth about $1 million,
maybe more.

1313
01:18:32,385 --> 01:18:34,591
NICKY: There you go.
What does that tell you?

1314
01:18:34,721 --> 01:18:36,096
$1 million in jewelry.

1315
01:18:36,891 --> 01:18:38,967
Does that tell you he is crazy about you?

1316
01:18:39,102 --> 01:18:40,810
I should have never married him.

1317
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:44,850
He's a Gemini. Triple Gemini. Duality.

1318
01:18:46,027 --> 01:18:48,696
Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.

1319
01:18:51,158 --> 01:18:52,356
I mean it.

1320
01:18:52,493 --> 01:18:54,699
I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.

1321
01:18:56,290 --> 01:18:59,493
This is probably not....
I don't have the answers anyway.

1322
01:19:00,128 --> 01:19:02,334
-This is probably not what you want to hear.
-I do.

1323
01:19:02,464 --> 01:19:04,706
You're a little upset, and I understand that.

1324
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:10,472
But try to make the best of it now.
Go slow. See what happens.

1325
01:19:10,599 --> 01:19:11,974
He could've killed him!

1326
01:19:13,603 --> 01:19:16,770
He didn't have to hit him.
I'm not sleeping with the guy.

1327
01:19:16,857 --> 01:19:19,063
He makes me sneak around
to see my own friends.

1328
01:19:19,152 --> 01:19:20,979
What the fuck is that all about?

1329
01:19:21,613 --> 01:19:24,899
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much,
he's jealous and worries.

1330
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:27,491
Who gives a fuck what I do?

1331
01:19:29,206 --> 01:19:31,495
I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.

1332
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:33,748
-When I see him, I'll talk to him.
-Okay.

1333
01:19:34,295 --> 01:19:36,003
-All right?
-Yeah.

1334
01:19:37,216 --> 01:19:38,591
Thanks...

1335
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:41,088
for putting up with me.

1336
01:19:41,221 --> 01:19:44,804
Take it easy with this shit.
This can only make matters worse.

1337
01:19:44,934 --> 01:19:46,843
You're a beautiful girl. Don't ruin that.

1338
01:19:46,978 --> 01:19:49,813
I've seen a lot of girls
get shot to hell from this stuff.

1339
01:19:50,983 --> 01:19:52,062
You're so nice.

1340
01:19:52,985 --> 01:19:55,191
Come on, now.
I don't wanna see you unhappy.

1341
01:19:58,409 --> 01:19:59,607
Thanks.

1342
01:20:04,333 --> 01:20:05,875
It's all right.

1343
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:21,930
County Commissioner Pat Webb
is here to see you.

1344
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:24,681
-Give me a minute.
-Okay. Just a minute.

1345
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:44,337
RECEPTIONIST: Can I get you anything?

1346
01:20:44,967 --> 01:20:46,794
No, thank you, little lady.

1347
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,343
Send him in and call me four minutes after.

1348
01:20:49,889 --> 01:20:52,890
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.

1349
01:20:53,227 --> 01:20:54,223
How do you do?

1350
01:20:54,312 --> 01:20:56,352
-It is a pleasure.
-I heard a lot about you.

1351
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:59,357
PAT: Thank you, sir. House is doing well.

1352
01:21:00,069 --> 01:21:02,275
All that money is rolling in.

1353
01:21:02,405 --> 01:21:05,406
I appreciate you taking the time
to see a poor old civil servant.

1354
01:21:05,492 --> 01:21:07,864
SAM: Why don't you have a seat?
PAT: Thank you, sir.

1355
01:21:09,038 --> 01:21:12,241
PAT: I come here personally
to smooth over...

1356
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,291
any fracas about a certain matter.

1357
01:21:14,921 --> 01:21:16,712
Maybe you didn't know it...

1358
01:21:16,798 --> 01:21:19,918
but Don Ward is a very well-liked man
in this town.

1359
01:21:20,052 --> 01:21:24,549
He's got lots of friends. His family
and their money go back many years.

1360
01:21:24,641 --> 01:21:27,559
Friends vote, family and money votes.

1361
01:21:28,271 --> 01:21:30,727
That's important to me and you.

1362
01:21:31,274 --> 01:21:35,853
If you'll think about our little problem
along them lines...

1363
01:21:36,865 --> 01:21:38,774
and you'll forgive me for saying it...

1364
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:41,234
maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

1365
01:21:42,622 --> 01:21:44,449
He knew about our getting hit...

1366
01:21:44,624 --> 01:21:47,661
on three big machines in a row,
and he did nothing about it.

1367
01:21:47,795 --> 01:21:51,663
Either he was in on it
or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.

1368
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,303
Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

1369
01:21:54,303 --> 01:21:57,589
Before we point the dirty end
of the stick at old Don...

1370
01:21:57,849 --> 01:22:00,055
we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

1371
01:22:00,561 --> 01:22:03,396
Believe me, if I could prove it,
he'd be under arrest.

1372
01:22:06,693 --> 01:22:10,442
Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board...

1373
01:22:10,573 --> 01:22:13,989
eyeballing your record
and your gangster pals like Nicky?

1374
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:16,699
I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1375
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:21,125
What you're saying is libelous. You're
in no position to challenge my expertise.

1376
01:22:21,378 --> 01:22:24,664
I went way out of my way
to be helpful and courteous to that kid.

1377
01:22:24,841 --> 01:22:28,210
He's weak. He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.

1378
01:22:28,345 --> 01:22:30,385
There's not much more I can do for him.

1379
01:22:30,515 --> 01:22:31,760
You have got me there.

1380
01:22:33,352 --> 01:22:36,602
Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.

1381
01:22:37,899 --> 01:22:39,808
But he is my brother-in-law...

1382
01:22:40,611 --> 01:22:43,233
and I would look on it
as a personal favor...

1383
01:22:43,364 --> 01:22:45,570
if you'd think some more
on hiring him back.

1384
01:22:46,535 --> 01:22:47,697
I can't do that.

1385
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,278
I appreciate the fact
that he's your brother-in-law.

1386
01:22:51,416 --> 01:22:53,658
I do want to help you
and I like to do favors.

1387
01:22:53,794 --> 01:22:56,036
And I know who you are.
But I cannot do that.

1388
01:22:58,425 --> 01:23:01,426
Could there be any position...

1389
01:23:02,471 --> 01:23:03,846
farther down the trough?

1390
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,090
I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

1391
01:23:08,228 --> 01:23:11,348
He's too incompetent.
The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.

1392
01:23:14,945 --> 01:23:16,143
SAM: Okay, thanks a lot.

1393
01:23:19,701 --> 01:23:20,946
That's it. I'm sorry.

1394
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:25,158
Mr. Rothstein,
your people never will understand...

1395
01:23:25,291 --> 01:23:27,367
the way it works out here.

1396
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,128
You're all just our guests.

1397
01:23:31,132 --> 01:23:32,840
But you act like you're at home.

1398
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:36,172
Let me tell you something, partner.
You ain't home.

1399
01:23:37,306 --> 01:23:40,260
But that's where we'll send you
if it harelips the Governor.

1400
01:23:43,648 --> 01:23:46,400
-Thank you for your time.
-No problem.

1401
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:49,401
-Sorry.
-You bet.

1402
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,079
SAM: What happened to my pills?

1403
01:23:58,875 --> 01:24:02,078
Isn't it bad enough you drink too much?
You're taking my pills, too?

1404
01:24:02,296 --> 01:24:03,755
GINGER: I didn't take your pills.

1405
01:24:03,923 --> 01:24:07,043
For my ulcer, I take a half of one of these.

1406
01:24:07,135 --> 01:24:09,591
That's when I have extreme pain.

1407
01:24:09,722 --> 01:24:12,427
I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with them?

1408
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:15,100
GINGER: [Crying] You didn't have to
beat him up.

1409
01:24:15,646 --> 01:24:16,760
SAM: What?

1410
01:24:17,565 --> 01:24:19,439
GINGER: I was just trying to help him.

1411
01:24:21,027 --> 01:24:23,233
GINGER: Like I'm sleeping with the guy.

1412
01:24:23,364 --> 01:24:24,823
Yeah, how do I know?

1413
01:24:25,825 --> 01:24:28,992
GINGER: You can't make me stop
caring about people.

1414
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:31,369
SAM: What?
GINGER: I said...

1415
01:24:32,375 --> 01:24:36,290
you can't make me
stop caring about people.

1416
01:24:43,555 --> 01:24:44,835
SAM: Listen...

1417
01:24:47,519 --> 01:24:49,725
I'm trying to make the best
of everything here.

1418
01:24:49,813 --> 01:24:51,971
I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.

1419
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,568
People look up to you in this town.

1420
01:24:55,654 --> 01:24:59,106
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit.

1421
01:24:59,367 --> 01:25:00,742
I'm getting out of here.

1422
01:25:08,587 --> 01:25:10,330
SAM: You gotta get a hold of yourself.

1423
01:25:10,547 --> 01:25:12,421
GINGER: Okay.
SAM: If not for me, at least for Amy.

1424
01:25:13,551 --> 01:25:16,173
SAM: Understand? Your drinking's
getting way out of hand.

1425
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,467
I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.

1426
01:25:20,226 --> 01:25:23,311
-I don't need one.
-Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

1427
01:25:23,438 --> 01:25:25,514
There's no names in the papers.

1428
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,192
That's all you care about.

1429
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:30,779
GINGER: You don't care about me.

1430
01:25:30,906 --> 01:25:32,863
SAM: Yes, I do.
GINGER: No, you don't.

1431
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,195
How could you say that?

1432
01:25:34,327 --> 01:25:36,949
You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.

1433
01:25:37,456 --> 01:25:40,742
You don't need that stuff,
that fucking leech living off you.

1434
01:25:40,919 --> 01:25:43,125
I know you better than you know yourself.

1435
01:25:43,255 --> 01:25:45,461
You're a tiger. You're stronger than I am.

1436
01:25:45,633 --> 01:25:49,501
When you set your mind on doing
something, you do it better than anybody.

1437
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:55,590
You're gonna do it.

1438
01:25:56,438 --> 01:25:57,683
Oh, God.

1439
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:08,942
I'll try.

1440
01:26:12,958 --> 01:26:14,156
GINGER: I will.

1441
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,335
Don't be mad at me, okay?

1442
01:26:29,278 --> 01:26:32,232
NICKY: No matter what
the problems were outside the count room...

1443
01:26:32,948 --> 01:26:34,442
it was all worth it.

1444
01:26:35,034 --> 01:26:37,073
The cash kept rolling in...

1445
01:26:38,162 --> 01:26:40,201
and the suitcases kept coming and going.

1446
01:26:41,374 --> 01:26:45,537
And let me tell you,
the fucking bottom line here is cash.

1447
01:26:47,506 --> 01:26:49,712
The only problem was that after a while...

1448
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:53,376
the bosses noticed that
the suitcases were getting a little light.

1449
01:26:54,638 --> 01:26:57,093
Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...

1450
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:59,638
that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

1451
01:26:59,852 --> 01:27:01,643
Somebody's robbing from us?

1452
01:27:01,854 --> 01:27:04,938
We go through all this fucking trouble
and somebody's robbing us?

1453
01:27:05,608 --> 01:27:09,819
Like I said, it's part of the business.
It's considered leakage.

1454
01:27:09,905 --> 01:27:12,277
Leakage, my balls.
I want the guy who's robbing us.

1455
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:15,076
NICKY: Even John Nance,
that's the guy who ran the scam...

1456
01:27:15,202 --> 01:27:17,241
he knew there wasn't much
he could do about it.

1457
01:27:17,371 --> 01:27:19,659
You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal...

1458
01:27:19,749 --> 01:27:21,907
even if you take care of him real well...

1459
01:27:22,210 --> 01:27:24,286
he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.

1460
01:27:24,379 --> 01:27:26,537
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1461
01:27:26,756 --> 01:27:30,207
You go try and make these hard-headed
old greaseballs understand that.

1462
01:27:30,385 --> 01:27:32,673
What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

1463
01:27:32,804 --> 01:27:35,377
It defeats the whole purpose
of what we're doing.

1464
01:27:35,766 --> 01:27:40,143
They take this money because they're
my guys, so give them some leeway.

1465
01:27:40,271 --> 01:27:42,844
NICKY: But the bosses never believed
in leeway...

1466
01:27:42,982 --> 01:27:44,524
so listen to what they do.

1467
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:47,521
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C...

1468
01:27:47,612 --> 01:27:51,111
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1469
01:27:51,241 --> 01:27:53,696
BOSS: What were you doing?
I was with my cumari.

1470
01:27:53,785 --> 01:27:56,988
BOSS: What were you doing
with your cumari?
I gave her a schiaffo.

1471
01:27:57,122 --> 01:27:59,660
NICKY: The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

1472
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:01,868
This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.

1473
01:28:02,003 --> 01:28:05,039
BOSS: What you been doing?
ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.

1474
01:28:05,173 --> 01:28:07,545
NICKY: Little did anybody know
where this would lead.

1475
01:28:07,675 --> 01:28:11,091
If they did, they would've
been better off making fucking novenas.

1476
01:28:11,221 --> 01:28:13,546
You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.

1477
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,510
-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip.
-What expenses?

1478
01:28:16,644 --> 01:28:20,558
I'm laying money out of my own pocket,
and I never get anything back.

1479
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,148
You gotta go back out there.

1480
01:28:22,233 --> 01:28:24,771
From now on,
I'm gonna start keeping records.

1481
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:28,189
What are you gonna do with records,
pay taxes?

1482
01:28:28,323 --> 01:28:31,774
I can't keep laying out
my own fucking dough for these trips.

1483
01:28:31,952 --> 01:28:33,944
What the hell are we doing over here?

1484
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:36,996
You're going to Las Vegas and having
a good time at my expense.

1485
01:28:37,124 --> 01:28:38,997
What the fuck? I mean, after all....

1486
01:28:39,126 --> 01:28:41,118
SAM: No matter how many
novenas you could make...

1487
01:28:41,212 --> 01:28:43,917
nothing was gonna stop
what came up next at the casino.

1488
01:28:44,006 --> 01:28:46,461
PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this.
ANNA: We made a deal.

1489
01:28:47,135 --> 01:28:49,708
SAM: It turned out Phil Green,
"Mr. Integrity"...

1490
01:28:49,804 --> 01:28:51,547
had a partner nobody knew about...

1491
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:54,847
and when she showed up
and demanded money from Tangiers...

1492
01:28:54,977 --> 01:28:57,515
-Why are you doing this to me?
-Because you're wrong.

1493
01:28:57,646 --> 01:28:58,974
ANNA: I'm not.
PHILIP: You are.

1494
01:28:59,148 --> 01:29:00,310
No, I am not wrong.

1495
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:02,059
...Green tried to stonewall her.

1496
01:29:02,234 --> 01:29:04,689
ANNA: I will see that
you don't get away with this.

1497
01:29:04,904 --> 01:29:06,528
So, she sued him in court.

1498
01:29:06,656 --> 01:29:09,277
The court will now hear the matter
of Anna Scott...

1499
01:29:09,367 --> 01:29:12,902
against Tangiers Corporation
and its President, Philip Green.

1500
01:29:12,996 --> 01:29:16,863
OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.
LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

1501
01:29:17,209 --> 01:29:19,415
JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed.
OBERON: Thank you.

1502
01:29:20,129 --> 01:29:23,462
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1503
01:29:23,549 --> 01:29:24,877
We got a problem.

1504
01:29:28,721 --> 01:29:31,472
It didn't go too well.
Green has to open up the books...

1505
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,972
has to show how he got the financing.

1506
01:29:34,061 --> 01:29:36,018
That's not good.

1507
01:29:39,692 --> 01:29:41,815
NICKY: She was doing pretty good
with her lawsuit.

1508
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:43,983
But before she could start
counting her money...

1509
01:29:44,113 --> 01:29:47,316
the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court.

1510
01:29:47,450 --> 01:29:48,648
So they sent me.

1511
01:30:04,969 --> 01:30:07,341
REPORTER: Any comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

1512
01:30:07,555 --> 01:30:11,006
What are you talking about?
REPORTER: She was found last night
shot in the head.

1513
01:30:11,101 --> 01:30:12,927
MAN: Was this just
a real estate partnership?

1514
01:30:13,061 --> 01:30:14,852
MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.

1515
01:30:15,564 --> 01:30:19,182
We were involved
in minor real estate deals many years ago.

1516
01:30:19,276 --> 01:30:20,604
It was never a partnership.

1517
01:30:22,071 --> 01:30:24,906
MAN: Did you ever hear
of the.22 caliber killer?

1518
01:30:25,074 --> 01:30:27,695
SAM: Now, Instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky...

1519
01:30:27,785 --> 01:30:29,694
they started looking at Green, too.

1520
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:32,402
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1521
01:30:32,582 --> 01:30:35,666
I had to start giving interviews
to make sure everybody knew...

1522
01:30:35,752 --> 01:30:37,329
the casino was on the up-and-up.

1523
01:30:37,462 --> 01:30:39,704
So how often do you really fill in for him?

1524
01:30:43,177 --> 01:30:45,549
Green's here about two or three times
a month...

1525
01:30:45,638 --> 01:30:48,674
and he's busy
with other real estate deals, and things.

1526
01:30:49,434 --> 01:30:51,592
So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

1527
01:30:52,604 --> 01:30:55,273
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board.

1528
01:30:56,274 --> 01:31:00,106
My responsibilities are
to run the day-to-day operations.

1529
01:31:00,487 --> 01:31:02,195
So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

1530
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:06,819
Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss...

1531
01:31:06,953 --> 01:31:08,910
when Mr. Green is away.

1532
01:31:11,541 --> 01:31:12,739
You could say that.

1533
01:31:14,377 --> 01:31:15,622
PAT: Have you read this?

1534
01:31:16,213 --> 01:31:17,671
About Mr. Rothstein.

1535
01:31:18,382 --> 01:31:21,667
It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties...

1536
01:31:21,802 --> 01:31:26,096
"says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million Tangiers casino empire."

1537
01:31:26,682 --> 01:31:29,351
PAT: Do you believe that?
OFFICIAL: Did he really say that?

1538
01:31:29,519 --> 01:31:32,010
Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.

1539
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:36,355
Has that man even filed for his license yet?

1540
01:31:36,484 --> 01:31:38,523
I don't know. We have to check the files.

1541
01:31:38,612 --> 01:31:41,732
Without getting your shorts in a knot,
would you do that?

1542
01:31:41,824 --> 01:31:45,904
And check closely, 'cause we may
have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1543
01:31:47,204 --> 01:31:48,532
PAT: Thank you.

1544
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:53,369
A Gaming Control Board investigation
of Tangiers executive...

1545
01:31:53,461 --> 01:31:56,497
Sam Rothstein's application
for a gaming license is underway.

1546
01:31:56,631 --> 01:32:01,507
Rothstein, who heads the Tangiers casino
operation and is a boyhood friend...

1547
01:32:01,637 --> 01:32:04,128
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro...

1548
01:32:04,348 --> 01:32:06,720
could lose his ability
to work in the casino....

1549
01:32:10,605 --> 01:32:11,600
Hello?

1550
01:32:11,689 --> 01:32:16,018
I gotta meet Charlie the Banker
right away at your house, okay?
I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?

1551
01:32:16,152 --> 01:32:18,310
You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

1552
01:32:18,405 --> 01:32:19,400
NICKY: No, it's okay.

1553
01:32:19,531 --> 01:32:23,529
I don't want a meeting at my house.
It's impossible. It's booked up,
and it's very difficult to get in.

1554
01:32:23,744 --> 01:32:27,113
I'll come in from the golf course side.
See you at six.
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at nine.

1555
01:32:27,248 --> 01:32:28,493
All right.

1556
01:32:30,251 --> 01:32:33,951
The battle between state gaming
officials and Tangiers casino boss...

1557
01:32:34,088 --> 01:32:36,460
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

1558
01:32:36,675 --> 01:32:40,886
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's
attempt to get state licensing...

1559
01:32:40,971 --> 01:32:45,015
despite law-enforcement allegations of
Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1560
01:32:45,225 --> 01:32:49,602
Will Sam Rothstein's friendship
with organized crime figure, Nicky Santoro...

1561
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,435
keep Rothstein
from running the Tangiers casino?

1562
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:56,647
And can the integrity of state gaming laws
be jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

1563
01:32:56,738 --> 01:32:58,814
SAM: Why don't you take it easy
on that stuff?

1564
01:33:00,367 --> 01:33:02,490
Come on. Let me help you down.

1565
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:03,899
We're talking about some stuff.

1566
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:06,029
NEWSCASTER: At 6:00,
will a boyhood friendship...

1567
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:08,828
unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers casino boss?

1568
01:33:09,168 --> 01:33:12,038
Exclusive on the KBBO special news report.

1569
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:16,080
Go down. Just go downstairs.

1570
01:33:21,264 --> 01:33:24,882
You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.

1571
01:33:25,018 --> 01:33:26,809
It's just a political witch hunt.

1572
01:33:34,737 --> 01:33:36,445
SAM: Do you want something to drink?

1573
01:33:36,573 --> 01:33:39,111
-Charlie, you want a refill?
-Yeah, that would be great.

1574
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:42,569
I don't want nothing. Hi, Mr. Clark.
I've been trying to reach you.

1575
01:33:42,663 --> 01:33:45,414
-You're tougher to get than the President.
-I've been busy.

1576
01:33:45,541 --> 01:33:48,114
Yeah? At least you could return
my phone calls, though.

1577
01:33:48,252 --> 01:33:51,253
Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

1578
01:33:52,006 --> 01:33:56,549
And I explained to you that you might
have to take some kind of loss.

1579
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:01,557
I think I want my money back.

1580
01:34:03,477 --> 01:34:05,469
What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?

1581
01:34:07,064 --> 01:34:09,934
I think you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

1582
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:12,937
I think, in all fairness...

1583
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:15,810
I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

1584
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:21,154
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice
and early, take a walk to the bank...

1585
01:34:21,997 --> 01:34:25,330
and walk in and see,
and if you don't have my money for me...

1586
01:34:25,459 --> 01:34:28,910
I'll crack your fucking head
wide open in front of everybody.

1587
01:34:29,672 --> 01:34:32,293
And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail...

1588
01:34:33,050 --> 01:34:36,004
hopefully, you'll be coming
out of your coma.

1589
01:34:36,804 --> 01:34:40,303
And guess what? I'll split
your fucking head open again.

1590
01:34:40,767 --> 01:34:43,933
'Cause I'm fucking stupid.
I don't give a fuck about jail.

1591
01:34:44,688 --> 01:34:47,261
That's my business. That's what I do.

1592
01:34:48,358 --> 01:34:49,733
We know what you do.

1593
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:52,148
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

1594
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:54,729
You can't talk to me like that.
NICKY: You fat Irish prick!

1595
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:58,032
You put my money to sleep.
Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.

1596
01:34:58,244 --> 01:35:00,532
Never mind Sam. This is personal.

1597
01:35:00,663 --> 01:35:03,414
I'll be there in the morning.
You can try me, fatso.

1598
01:35:06,712 --> 01:35:09,084
-You think he got the point?
-What are you doing?

1599
01:35:09,214 --> 01:35:13,081
He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes.
He's gonna run to the FBI.

1600
01:35:13,219 --> 01:35:16,089
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

1601
01:35:16,556 --> 01:35:20,221
-You're trying to tell me what to do?
-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

1602
01:35:20,310 --> 01:35:22,635
You're way out of line. Where's your head?

1603
01:35:22,729 --> 01:35:24,852
Where's my head?
Where's your fucking balls?

1604
01:35:25,816 --> 01:35:29,516
I'm trying to put something big together.
You know what I'm talking about.

1605
01:35:29,903 --> 01:35:33,023
If you're acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

1606
01:35:33,115 --> 01:35:35,985
A lot of things gonna change.
If you wanna be there with me...

1607
01:35:36,077 --> 01:35:38,034
you're gonna have to go my way.

1608
01:35:38,162 --> 01:35:41,697
You got to understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1609
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:44,039
SAM: I got $100 million a year
going through the place.

1610
01:35:44,127 --> 01:35:47,330
It's all over if I don't get that license.

1611
01:35:47,422 --> 01:35:51,170
Believe me, if it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1612
01:35:51,302 --> 01:35:52,962
Forget about your fucking license.

1613
01:35:53,095 --> 01:35:56,096
I plant my own flag out here,
you ain't gonna need a license.

1614
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:01,102
I don't know what it is,
but the more I talk to you...

1615
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:04,099
the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

1616
01:36:04,232 --> 01:36:07,102
-No, I don't want to come along with you.
-All right.

1617
01:36:07,194 --> 01:36:10,397
I don't want to be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

1618
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:12,861
I want to run a square joint.
I just want my license.

1619
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:14,989
I want everything quiet. That's it!

1620
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,325
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

1621
01:36:17,455 --> 01:36:19,447
It's taken out of context. I had no control.

1622
01:36:19,582 --> 01:36:22,037
Ronnie and Billy will tell you
exactly what happened.

1623
01:36:22,126 --> 01:36:23,917
Back home that looks bad.

1624
01:36:24,045 --> 01:36:28,754
Looks bad? Every time you're on television,
I get mentioned. That looks bad.

1625
01:36:29,092 --> 01:36:30,883
What the fuck happened to you?

1626
01:36:31,011 --> 01:36:33,680
-What happened to you? You lost control?
-I lost control?

1627
01:36:33,806 --> 01:36:36,297
You're fucking walking around
like John Barrymore.

1628
01:36:36,434 --> 01:36:41,310
A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder?
I lost control?

1629
01:36:41,397 --> 01:36:46,273
I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat
people with disrespect. Even your own wife.

1630
01:36:47,028 --> 01:36:49,400
My wife? What does she have
to do with this?

1631
01:36:49,531 --> 01:36:54,359
She was upset about a lot of things,
especially that Lester Diamond incident.

1632
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,703
You're the shoulder to cry on?
Did you tell her about your role in that?

1633
01:36:58,833 --> 01:37:01,121
No, that's not the fucking point.

1634
01:37:01,252 --> 01:37:04,206
The point is, she's upset,
and you've got a problem.

1635
01:37:04,339 --> 01:37:06,912
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out
of my personal life.

1636
01:37:07,008 --> 01:37:09,047
You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

1637
01:37:09,177 --> 01:37:12,676
She came to talk to me.
Was I supposed to throw her out?

1638
01:37:12,765 --> 01:37:16,134
Stay away from her.
It's none of your business.

1639
01:37:16,227 --> 01:37:21,138
A week ago it was. Now it's not.
When you need me, you need me.

1640
01:37:21,482 --> 01:37:24,352
Right, the way you need me
to vouch for you as a citizen.

1641
01:37:24,444 --> 01:37:27,314
I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you did with this guy.

1642
01:37:27,447 --> 01:37:29,155
This guy's gonna run to the FBl.

1643
01:37:29,282 --> 01:37:31,903
NICKY: Your head's bigger than your casino.
That's your problem.

1644
01:37:32,035 --> 01:37:36,412
SAM: I knew what he wanted
and I didn't want any part of it.
He wanted to take over.

1645
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:41,416
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

1646
01:37:41,546 --> 01:37:45,081
He also stopped asking permission
from back home for every little thing.

1647
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:53,797
A casino boss and his wife were killed.
The bulls questioned Nicky.

1648
01:37:54,810 --> 01:37:58,013
A dealer from the Scirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

1649
01:37:58,147 --> 01:38:02,145
Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks
of their cars. They questioned Nicky.

1650
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:03,391
A lawyer.

1651
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,938
They questioned Nicky.

1652
01:38:08,116 --> 01:38:11,152
When some guys who didn't pay
their shylocks began disappearing...

1653
01:38:11,286 --> 01:38:14,121
Nicky's name was in every newspaper.

1654
01:38:14,248 --> 01:38:18,080
Nicky was questioned in two dozen
murders, but they always had to let him go.

1655
01:38:18,169 --> 01:38:19,497
There were never any witnesses.

1656
01:38:19,587 --> 01:38:24,048
NICKY: The coppers blamed me
for everything that went wrong.

1657
01:38:24,175 --> 01:38:25,883
Watch yourself.
You're gonna get runned over.

1658
01:38:25,969 --> 01:38:29,801
NICKY: If a guy tripped over
a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.

1659
01:38:30,599 --> 01:38:32,057
Be nice.

1660
01:38:32,142 --> 01:38:36,305
NICKY: The bosses were no better.
They complained because things
don't run smooth.

1661
01:38:36,438 --> 01:38:39,641
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

1662
01:38:39,775 --> 01:38:42,063
I'm dealing with degenerate
animals out here.

1663
01:38:42,153 --> 01:38:44,192
The bosses, what do they give a fuck?

1664
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:46,486
They're sitting on their asses
drinking anisette.

1665
01:38:46,616 --> 01:38:48,822
Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

1666
01:38:48,952 --> 01:38:51,657
Fucking bosses think it's
a fucking free lunch out here.

1667
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:56,623
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

1668
01:38:57,962 --> 01:38:59,456
You know about that?

1669
01:38:59,839 --> 01:39:01,084
I heard.

1670
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:05,634
Everybody's talking about it and making
a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.

1671
01:39:05,762 --> 01:39:07,007
What are you gonna do?

1672
01:39:07,472 --> 01:39:09,014
That's no good.

1673
01:39:09,891 --> 01:39:13,675
Tell him to take care of things a little better.

1674
01:39:14,897 --> 01:39:16,011
I'll tell him, Remo.

1675
01:39:16,148 --> 01:39:18,899
NICKY: Fucking bosses
smoking their Di Nobilis...

1676
01:39:18,984 --> 01:39:22,187
and eating trip' and fucking soffrit',
fried pigs' guts...

1677
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:25,690
while if I wanna talk private,
I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.

1678
01:39:25,825 --> 01:39:30,154
-What do they care? Long as I send money.
-They're complaining.

1679
01:39:30,288 --> 01:39:33,324
Let them complain. I'm the one
who's here. I do all the work.

1680
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:37,578
NICKY: Somebody don't like it, fuck them.
FRANK: It's up to you.

1681
01:39:38,631 --> 01:39:40,457
NICKY: They want a fucking war? I'm ready.

1682
01:39:41,217 --> 01:39:45,594
If I take care of five of those guys,
the rest will fall into place.

1683
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:49,303
NICKY: Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.

1684
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:51,803
I see you, you motherfuckers.

1685
01:39:51,937 --> 01:39:55,555
SAM: Nicky was not only bringing heat
on himself, but on me, too.

1686
01:39:55,691 --> 01:40:00,234
The FBI watched every move he made,
but he just didn't care.

1687
01:40:00,362 --> 01:40:03,232
NICKY: If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch them back.

1688
01:40:03,407 --> 01:40:06,324
I spent a few bucks. Top dollar.
Who gives a shit?

1689
01:40:06,452 --> 01:40:10,948
I got the latest anti-bugging equipment
from the same places that sell to the CIA.

1690
01:40:11,082 --> 01:40:15,993
I had all the special police frequency radios,
FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....

1691
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,756
So, the miserable sons of bitches never
caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.

1692
01:40:22,386 --> 01:40:25,636
SAM: I got my job on the line,
he's having the time of his life.

1693
01:40:25,765 --> 01:40:29,050
He has every cop in the state watching him,
and he's out playing golf.

1694
01:40:29,853 --> 01:40:32,344
And at the worst possible time for me.

1695
01:40:33,231 --> 01:40:37,229
I had my license hearing coming up and
I didn't want to leave anything to chance.

1696
01:40:38,987 --> 01:40:41,193
If I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

1697
01:40:41,323 --> 01:40:44,906
You've been very open with us
with the books and papers.

1698
01:40:45,036 --> 01:40:47,574
That'll mean a lot
when you go before the commission.

1699
01:40:47,663 --> 01:40:51,530
-All I ask is a fair hearing.
-This honesty will guarantee it.

1700
01:40:52,919 --> 01:40:54,377
We'll move on to....

1701
01:40:56,048 --> 01:40:59,748
SAM: I want to hear about Kansas City.

1702
01:41:01,261 --> 01:41:02,719
What the fuck is this?

1703
01:41:05,308 --> 01:41:07,846
Where's this fucking guy gonna land,
in the fairway?

1704
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:30,324
They're fucking agents, Frankie.
Look at this.

1705
01:41:32,462 --> 01:41:35,000
SAM: The Feds were watching
Nicky play golf for so long...

1706
01:41:35,173 --> 01:41:36,371
they ran out of gas.

1707
01:41:37,926 --> 01:41:40,677
Just what I needed,
right in front of the control board.

1708
01:41:45,893 --> 01:41:47,719
$100, whoever hits the plane.

1709
01:41:50,857 --> 01:41:55,234
SAM: If things weren't bad enough...
in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

1710
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,819
He ran the grocery store in Kansas City
where they brought the suitcases.

1711
01:41:58,949 --> 01:42:02,152
Fighting over those suitcases again.
You know what that means?

1712
01:42:02,286 --> 01:42:05,821
I gotta take another trip to Vegas.
It's gonna cost me another couple grand.

1713
01:42:05,956 --> 01:42:07,450
SAM: He ran it with his brother-in-law...

1714
01:42:07,541 --> 01:42:11,918
but he mostly complained about his trips
to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.

1715
01:42:12,046 --> 01:42:15,166
You gotta lay down the law,
or they'll make a fool out of you.

1716
01:42:15,592 --> 01:42:19,127
I write it all down.
Every fucking nickel goes down.

1717
01:42:19,262 --> 01:42:22,927
-What's the matter with you?
-Everything's here.

1718
01:42:23,016 --> 01:42:25,008
-Since when do you talk like that?
-I'm sorry.

1719
01:42:25,144 --> 01:42:29,640
Nance gives me trouble, I'll
take the eyes out of his freaking head.

1720
01:42:29,732 --> 01:42:32,057
-Again.
-I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."

1721
01:42:32,193 --> 01:42:33,355
-That's enough.
-I'm sorry.

1722
01:42:33,486 --> 01:42:35,525
SAM: What happens next,
you can't believe it.

1723
01:42:35,780 --> 01:42:38,567
Who'd believe the FBI
had a wire in the place...

1724
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:41,369
looking for information
about some old homicide...

1725
01:42:41,453 --> 01:42:44,786
about some guy who was whacked out
God knows when over God knows what?

1726
01:42:44,873 --> 01:42:47,874
What prevents him with the suitcases
from taking what he wants?

1727
01:42:48,002 --> 01:42:51,916
Nance brings back two suitcases from
the Tangiers. What about three or four?

1728
01:42:52,048 --> 01:42:54,918
We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.

1729
01:42:55,051 --> 01:42:58,669
We can't even go into the count room
to watch our money.

1730
01:42:58,763 --> 01:43:03,341
He's got his people in there.
They could all be in on it together.

1731
01:43:04,103 --> 01:43:07,269
I'll find out. If it's Green himself,
I'll bury that bastard.

1732
01:43:07,398 --> 01:43:09,936
I never trusted him.
I got eyes behind my head.

1733
01:43:10,067 --> 01:43:11,775
They trust that scumbag. I don't.

1734
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:14,149
I'll hit the two of them
in the head with a shovel.

1735
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,311
MA: Take it easy.

1736
01:43:15,448 --> 01:43:18,199
Ma, I'm sorry.
They're beating me left and right.

1737
01:43:18,326 --> 01:43:20,651
ARTIE: I'm sorry. I'm upset.
I know, but that's enough.

1738
01:43:20,746 --> 01:43:23,912
You know what they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.

1739
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:27,659
MA: Take it easy. You'll get a heart attack.
ARTIE: I know. I'm too upset.

1740
01:43:28,921 --> 01:43:31,079
SAM: The damn thing is,
they hear all this stuff...

1741
01:43:31,215 --> 01:43:34,465
about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases...

1742
01:43:34,594 --> 01:43:36,088
and that's it.

1743
01:43:41,727 --> 01:43:44,478
ARTIE: Everything's coming out
of my pocket. I gotta pay.

1744
01:43:45,898 --> 01:43:47,475
SAM: Would you believe this could happen?

1745
01:43:48,984 --> 01:43:50,857
ARTIE: I'm in this to make money, not lose it.

1746
01:43:50,987 --> 01:43:54,687
SAM: Every FBI man
across the country had their ears open now.

1747
01:43:54,824 --> 01:43:58,109
ARTIE: If you want something done right
you gotta do it yourself.

1748
01:43:58,870 --> 01:44:02,702
SAM: Piscano, this guy,
basically sunk the whole world.

1749
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:06,159
MA: There are some that are good
and some that are bad.

1750
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,706
COUNSELOR: Members
of the Commission...

1751
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,713
Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

1752
01:44:11,842 --> 01:44:14,214
SAM: When the day finally came, I was ready.

1753
01:44:14,303 --> 01:44:18,087
I felt so confident that all I had
to do was present my case.

1754
01:44:18,224 --> 01:44:22,720
COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of
which is a report by retired FBl agents...

1755
01:44:22,813 --> 01:44:26,098
which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

1756
01:44:26,233 --> 01:44:29,684
-Counselor, before you continue...
-I want to have this marked....

1757
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:33,983
...this Commission acts on a motion
denying the Rothstein application.

1758
01:44:34,075 --> 01:44:36,566
COUNSELOR: Denying?
SENATOR: Do I hear a motion seconded?

1759
01:44:37,203 --> 01:44:38,863
Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

1760
01:44:38,997 --> 01:44:40,621
Do I have a vote on the motion?

1761
01:44:40,749 --> 01:44:41,780
-Aye!
-Aye!

1762
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:45,167
The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.

1763
01:44:45,295 --> 01:44:48,461
-You have to be kidding.
-Adjourned? What do you mean?

1764
01:44:49,258 --> 01:44:53,801
Senator, you promised me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBl reports.

1765
01:44:54,055 --> 01:44:58,931
When you were my guest at the Tangiers
Hotel, didn't you promise me a fair hearing?

1766
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:02,845
SENATOR: I was never your guest.
SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?

1767
01:45:02,981 --> 01:45:05,269
I don't comp you
at least three times a month?

1768
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:07,688
I'd like to answer that at this time.

1769
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:11,105
Mr. Rothstein is being very typical
to this point. He's lying.

1770
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:15,112
The only time I was at the Tangiers
was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.

1771
01:45:15,244 --> 01:45:17,913
Was I at the dinner?
SENATOR: You were wandering around.

1772
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:21,075
SAM: Was I at that dinner?
SENATOR: You were wandering.

1773
01:45:21,167 --> 01:45:24,168
SENATOR: You were in the building.
SAM: I was in the building?

1774
01:45:24,296 --> 01:45:28,507
You know damn well I was there.
You swore I would have a fair hearing.

1775
01:45:29,093 --> 01:45:31,169
Did you not?

1776
01:45:32,888 --> 01:45:36,138
Tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.

1777
01:45:36,851 --> 01:45:39,342
SAM: Give me that much at least!
SENATOR: Yes, you were.

1778
01:45:39,437 --> 01:45:42,142
Thanks for not calling me a liar,
you son of a bitch.

1779
01:45:44,401 --> 01:45:47,770
A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday...

1780
01:45:47,905 --> 01:45:51,605
when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino
executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...

1781
01:45:51,700 --> 01:45:54,570
accused top gaming officials of corruption.

1782
01:45:54,662 --> 01:45:57,532
...promised me a fair hearing
when you were comped at my hotel?

1783
01:45:57,665 --> 01:46:00,868
And you asked for copies of your bill
to put on your expense account.

1784
01:46:01,002 --> 01:46:04,252
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming
license denial...

1785
01:46:04,381 --> 01:46:06,587
Bullshit!
...Rothstein followed several...

1786
01:46:06,717 --> 01:46:10,168
stunned commissioners into the hallway
where he continued his harangue...

1787
01:46:10,262 --> 01:46:12,753
until his own lawyers and friends
urged him to leave.

1788
01:46:12,890 --> 01:46:17,053
You have a past. I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.

1789
01:46:17,144 --> 01:46:19,895
You guys think you have
the right to pass judgment!

1790
01:46:20,023 --> 01:46:23,107
NEWSREADER: Long suspected
of running Tangiers without a license...

1791
01:46:23,234 --> 01:46:27,695
yesterday's hearing was to determine
if someone with Rothstein's history...

1792
01:46:27,823 --> 01:46:30,658
was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post.

1793
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,942
REMO: Fucking hypocrites!

1794
01:46:33,537 --> 01:46:36,740
-What the hell's he gonna do now?
-I don't know.

1795
01:46:37,124 --> 01:46:38,499
What's he doing?

1796
01:46:38,876 --> 01:46:41,711
He knows all those guys he yelled at
are friends of ours.

1797
01:46:41,796 --> 01:46:44,002
What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

1798
01:46:44,132 --> 01:46:46,504
Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

1799
01:46:46,635 --> 01:46:49,090
Won't be the best,
but what are we gonna do?

1800
01:46:49,346 --> 01:46:53,593
REMO: However he runs things, it's gotta be
quiet. Let him hide upstairs in the office.

1801
01:46:53,726 --> 01:46:55,765
Say he's a janitor. I don't give a shit.

1802
01:46:55,978 --> 01:47:00,889
But please, whatever job he takes,
make sure it's something quiet.

1803
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:11,285
ANNOUNCER: [On TV]
Ladies and gentlemen...

1804
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:14,205
the Tangiers Hotel
proudly presents the all-new...

1805
01:47:14,331 --> 01:47:17,082
Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.

1806
01:47:20,963 --> 01:47:23,833
Tonight, taped live
from the all-new sports book...

1807
01:47:23,925 --> 01:47:26,630
we present the premiere showing
of Aces High...

1808
01:47:27,053 --> 01:47:29,508
with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...

1809
01:47:30,849 --> 01:47:33,304
and the Sam Rothstein dancers!

1810
01:47:35,187 --> 01:47:39,932
Mr. Rothstein is a professional gambler
and the best U.S. football handicapper.

1811
01:47:40,234 --> 01:47:44,777
A man who will take you inside the real
Las Vegas as no one has ever done before.

1812
01:47:45,365 --> 01:47:49,612
Now, the new entertainment director
of the Tangiers Hotel Casino...

1813
01:47:49,911 --> 01:47:51,619
Mr. Sam Rothstein.

1814
01:48:01,007 --> 01:48:05,254
Welcome to the Sam Rothstein show.
We're happy to have you here this evening.

1815
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:08,003
The young lady to my left is Trudy...

1816
01:48:08,473 --> 01:48:11,639
who is a lead new dancer
in our fabulous show from Paris.

1817
01:48:11,852 --> 01:48:14,140
Our first guest this evening...

1818
01:48:15,564 --> 01:48:16,892
is Frankie Avalon.

1819
01:48:22,822 --> 01:48:26,191
PAT: Keep an eye on him.
FRANKIE: I've got a large family.

1820
01:48:26,284 --> 01:48:30,661
SAM: How many kids do you have?
I'm very proud to say, eight children.

1821
01:48:34,001 --> 01:48:37,666
-That's amazing.
-There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.

1822
01:48:39,382 --> 01:48:40,496
PHILIP: Ace, don't do it.

1823
01:48:45,513 --> 01:48:46,675
Jesus.

1824
01:48:47,432 --> 01:48:48,926
He's juggling!

1825
01:48:49,184 --> 01:48:52,719
SAM: Let's not take County Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously.

1826
01:48:53,188 --> 01:48:56,771
I recently challenged him to a debate
on this program, and he declined.

1827
01:48:56,942 --> 01:49:01,153
What are you worried about, Pat?
You don't have to send me any questions.

1828
01:49:02,198 --> 01:49:03,989
You can ask me anything you want.

1829
01:49:04,325 --> 01:49:06,364
ANDY: What the hell is he doing
on television?

1830
01:49:07,203 --> 01:49:11,912
He's on all night, screaming about
taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.

1831
01:49:12,584 --> 01:49:15,704
He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

1832
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:18,124
He's out of his fucking mind.

1833
01:49:18,215 --> 01:49:21,999
It's a pity we have such hypocrisy.
Some people do what they want.

1834
01:49:22,136 --> 01:49:24,841
Other people have to pay
through the nose. Such is life.

1835
01:49:25,264 --> 01:49:30,175
Andy, go see him. Tell him
maybe it's time he should quit.

1836
01:49:36,276 --> 01:49:39,027
SAM: First, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

1837
01:49:39,154 --> 01:49:42,819
SAM: We're on the list to be heard before
the U.S. Supreme Court.

1838
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:45,151
These guys don't care
about the Supreme Court.

1839
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:48,115
They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

1840
01:49:48,206 --> 01:49:53,117
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.
Don't you see what's at stake?

1841
01:49:53,336 --> 01:49:56,206
The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

1842
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:59,175
When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

1843
01:49:59,301 --> 01:50:02,052
Not only should you quit, you should run.

1844
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:06,592
Every time they mention my name
in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.

1845
01:50:06,684 --> 01:50:08,475
How the fuck does that help?

1846
01:50:09,354 --> 01:50:11,180
The heat he brought down is murder.

1847
01:50:11,648 --> 01:50:13,557
The police department was cooperative.

1848
01:50:13,692 --> 01:50:16,397
They're pissed off.
Nobody can make a move anymore.

1849
01:50:16,486 --> 01:50:17,731
What do you do about that?

1850
01:50:17,863 --> 01:50:20,864
-What are you proposing?
-I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

1851
01:50:21,158 --> 01:50:23,863
Maybe he should get lost for a while.
Would that be so bad?

1852
01:50:23,953 --> 01:50:26,491
-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.
-If he took a break...

1853
01:50:26,622 --> 01:50:28,780
it would give everybody time to maneuver.

1854
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:32,825
I would forget about the maneuver.
I would just get out.

1855
01:50:36,884 --> 01:50:37,998
I can't do that.

1856
01:50:39,219 --> 01:50:43,466
SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

1857
01:50:43,641 --> 01:50:46,511
Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

1858
01:50:47,478 --> 01:50:49,803
I've got to do some shopping. Want to go?

1859
01:50:49,898 --> 01:50:52,436
SAM: Getting a call from Nicky
wasn't easy anymore.

1860
01:50:52,567 --> 01:50:55,402
Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

1861
01:50:55,487 --> 01:50:59,948
If a phone's tapped, the Feds can only
listen in on the stuff involving crimes.

1862
01:51:00,075 --> 01:51:03,574
On routine calls, they have
to click off after a few minutes.

1863
01:51:03,662 --> 01:51:05,619
GINGER: I got a sprained fucking elbow.

1864
01:51:06,874 --> 01:51:08,119
Meet me at 3:00.

1865
01:51:08,251 --> 01:51:10,789
-At Caesar's?
-100 yards further down the road.

1866
01:51:11,588 --> 01:51:13,664
-Why?
-Don't ask questions. Just be there.

1867
01:51:16,134 --> 01:51:18,839
Suzy Cream Cheese has the same outfit.

1868
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:21,972
GINGER: I saw something.

1869
01:51:22,099 --> 01:51:24,387
Something very cute.

1870
01:51:25,269 --> 01:51:28,887
AGENT: Okay, he's out. It's the ant.
Brown unit.

1871
01:51:29,273 --> 01:51:32,060
He's with the bogey. I think it's Frankie.

1872
01:51:32,193 --> 01:51:34,066
SAM: Nicky started out before me...

1873
01:51:34,195 --> 01:51:37,030
because it wasn't that easy for him
to get around anymore.

1874
01:51:38,659 --> 01:51:41,364
Nicky couldn't even go
for a ride without changing cars...

1875
01:51:41,495 --> 01:51:44,282
at least six times
before he could shake all his tails.

1876
01:51:44,457 --> 01:51:47,707
Because of the planes,
he had to use underground garages.

1877
01:52:19,161 --> 01:52:21,830
SAM: Meeting in the desert
always made me nervous.

1878
01:52:21,914 --> 01:52:23,408
It's a scary place.

1879
01:52:24,667 --> 01:52:26,790
I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course.

1880
01:52:26,877 --> 01:52:29,368
And everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

1881
01:52:32,300 --> 01:52:34,458
Normally, my prospects
of coming back alive...

1882
01:52:34,552 --> 01:52:37,043
from a meeting with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

1883
01:52:39,141 --> 01:52:42,889
But this time, when I heard him say a
couple of hundred yards down the road...

1884
01:52:43,896 --> 01:52:45,687
I gave myself 50-50.

1885
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:11,127
Where the fuck you get off
talking to people behind my back?

1886
01:53:11,217 --> 01:53:13,755
-What people?
-Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1887
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:16,176
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1888
01:53:16,306 --> 01:53:21,217
You said I'm bringing heat on you?
I gotta listen to people because of you?

1889
01:53:21,395 --> 01:53:24,431
You're ordering me out? You better get
your own fucking army!

1890
01:53:24,565 --> 01:53:26,308
I didn't order you or anybody.

1891
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,105
I told Andy Stone that you had heat,
and that was a problem.

1892
01:53:29,236 --> 01:53:31,312
You want me to get out
of my own fucking town?

1893
01:53:31,447 --> 01:53:34,697
Yeah, let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

1894
01:53:34,826 --> 01:53:37,862
Anything goes wrong
with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.

1895
01:53:38,038 --> 01:53:42,949
You know that you only have your fucking
casino because I made that possible!

1896
01:53:43,502 --> 01:53:44,960
I'm what counts out here.

1897
01:53:45,087 --> 01:53:49,131
Not your fucking country clubs
or your fucking TV shows.

1898
01:53:49,258 --> 01:53:51,749
And what the fuck
are you doing on TV anyhow?

1899
01:53:51,969 --> 01:53:55,919
I get calls from back home every day.
They think you went batshit!

1900
01:53:56,057 --> 01:53:59,640
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able
to hang around the casino. You don't understand that....

1901
01:53:59,769 --> 01:54:03,220
You could've had the food-and-beverage
job without going on TV!

1902
01:54:03,315 --> 01:54:05,853
-You wanted to go on TV.
-Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.

1903
01:54:05,984 --> 01:54:08,439
That way I have a forum. I can fight back.
I'm known. People see me

1904
01:54:08,529 --> 01:54:12,229
They know they can't fuck around with
me like they could if I was an unknown.
That's why

1905
01:54:12,325 --> 01:54:14,198
You're making a spectacle of yourself.

1906
01:54:14,327 --> 01:54:17,032
I wouldn't even be in this situation
if it wasn't for you.

1907
01:54:17,163 --> 01:54:18,705
You brought down so much heat on me.

1908
01:54:18,832 --> 01:54:21,323
Every time I meet somebody,
they ask me if I know you.

1909
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:24,496
Sure, now you wanna blame
your fucking license on me.

1910
01:54:24,630 --> 01:54:26,706
When you asked me
if you could come out here...

1911
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:30,884
what did I tell you? I knew you'd come out
no matter what I said. Do you remember?

1912
01:54:30,970 --> 01:54:33,721
Back up a fucking minute here. One minute.

1913
01:54:33,973 --> 01:54:38,302
I asked you? When the fuck
did I ever ask you if I could come out here?

1914
01:54:38,394 --> 01:54:42,771
NICKY: Get this through your head,
you Jew motherfucker!

1915
01:54:42,858 --> 01:54:46,938
You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason!

1916
01:54:47,071 --> 01:54:49,526
Without me, you personally....

1917
01:54:49,615 --> 01:54:54,491
Every fucking wise guy still around will
take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!

1918
01:54:54,704 --> 01:54:57,242
Then where you gonna go?
You're fucking warned.

1919
01:54:57,332 --> 01:55:01,080
Don't go over my fucking head again,
you motherfucker, you!

1920
01:55:30,701 --> 01:55:31,946
Well, we got company.

1921
01:55:45,592 --> 01:55:46,967
Did you see that?

1922
01:55:47,344 --> 01:55:51,009
Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together,
and he acts like he doesn't know me.

1923
01:55:52,725 --> 01:55:56,224
I know we're supposed to avoid each
other, but there's ways to do things.

1924
01:55:56,646 --> 01:55:57,891
Fuck him.

1925
01:55:58,022 --> 01:55:59,730
To Abraham Lincoln.

1926
01:56:00,441 --> 01:56:02,599
Forget about it. Don't let it bother you.

1927
01:56:03,111 --> 01:56:05,946
Does it look like it's bothering me?
Why do I give a fuck?

1928
01:56:07,282 --> 01:56:09,855
Oscar, too.
All the money I gave him, that prick.

1929
01:56:09,993 --> 01:56:12,566
He didn't even look over.
What's his fucking problem?

1930
01:56:13,581 --> 01:56:17,246
-Fucking Jews stick together, don't they?
-They're having a good time.

1931
01:56:18,252 --> 01:56:19,580
So are we.

1932
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,339
Yeah?

1933
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:28,593
-Sam, we got a problem.
-What is it?

1934
01:56:28,722 --> 01:56:32,506
BILLY: The little guy. Nobody told him
he was eighty-sixed from the joint.

1935
01:56:32,643 --> 01:56:35,679
We turned our heads and made out
like we didn't know who he was.

1936
01:56:36,022 --> 01:56:39,307
He's over at the 21 table
with his nose wide open.

1937
01:56:40,109 --> 01:56:43,644
He took money out of his own kick.
His nose is open for about $10,000.

1938
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:45,817
Now he's really pissed.

1939
01:56:47,284 --> 01:56:50,819
-He wants a $50,000 marker.
-Just give him $10,000.

1940
01:56:50,954 --> 01:56:52,496
That's it. I'll be right down.

1941
01:56:52,623 --> 01:56:55,078
He's gonna come up with $10,000
just the way you want.

1942
01:56:55,167 --> 01:56:57,705
No, I said fucking $50,000!

1943
01:56:57,837 --> 01:57:00,410
Go get it. I don't give a fuck
where you get it.

1944
01:57:00,548 --> 01:57:03,003
Fuckers. They take it
but don't wanna give it back.

1945
01:57:07,472 --> 01:57:08,966
How the fuck can you grin?

1946
01:57:11,810 --> 01:57:14,645
You know how much I'm stuck?
Do you give a fuck?

1947
01:57:19,110 --> 01:57:22,230
Give yourself a hand,
right across your fucking mouth.

1948
01:57:22,363 --> 01:57:24,521
Look at this beaut they put in now.

1949
01:57:24,658 --> 01:57:26,650
NICKY: Sherbert send you in here
to rob me now?

1950
01:57:26,743 --> 01:57:30,871
Been fucking knocking everybody's dick
in all night? Been beating the customers?

1951
01:57:31,912 --> 01:57:33,821
Jag-off. Hit me.

1952
01:57:36,500 --> 01:57:40,200
Take this stiff and pound it
up your fucking ass.

1953
01:57:40,338 --> 01:57:41,796
Hit me again.

1954
01:57:46,135 --> 01:57:50,464
Take this one and stick it
up your sister's ass. Hit me again.

1955
01:57:50,765 --> 01:57:55,640
Keep looking at him. If you had any heart
at all, you'd be stealing for a living.

1956
01:57:55,895 --> 01:57:59,098
Hit me again! What the fuck
you keep looking at him for?

1957
01:57:59,232 --> 01:58:03,016
You fucking.... Look at this,
20 points in a row. Hit me again.

1958
01:58:08,407 --> 01:58:11,111
NICKY: You should pay as fast
as you collect, you know.

1959
01:58:15,164 --> 01:58:19,031
-You gotta get out of here.
-Tell this motherfucker to pay that marker.

1960
01:58:19,168 --> 01:58:22,667
You're not listening. I'm here to help you.
You're gonna bury us both.

1961
01:58:23,047 --> 01:58:27,376
-Just give me the money.
-I'm gonna okay you $10,000, that's it.

1962
01:58:27,593 --> 01:58:30,166
Then you gotta get out
before the cops are all over you.

1963
01:58:30,305 --> 01:58:32,012
$10,000 and that's it.

1964
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:40,389
What are you staring at,
you bald-headed Jew prick?

1965
01:58:45,028 --> 01:58:48,562
-Come on. Let's get out of here.
-Sue me, you Jew fuck!

1966
01:58:48,990 --> 01:58:52,524
NICKY: Get out of here?
I got a marker coming. Deal.

1967
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,910
I know, but everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.

1968
01:58:56,039 --> 01:58:59,289
You're asking for alimony payments
and child support, and now custody.

1969
01:58:59,376 --> 01:59:01,452
I just want what any
divorced woman would get.

1970
01:59:01,628 --> 01:59:03,786
She's only sober about two hours a day.

1971
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:06,205
It's usually from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.

1972
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:10,884
If I gave her her money and her jewels,
she's gonna piss it all away in a year.

1973
01:59:11,304 --> 01:59:15,004
Where would you be then?
Coming right back to me...

1974
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:17,306
or finding some other excuse to come....

1975
01:59:18,186 --> 01:59:20,890
We had a deal. Remember that?

1976
01:59:22,232 --> 01:59:26,146
He said if it didn't work out between us,
I could get my things and leave.

1977
01:59:28,405 --> 01:59:29,519
Look in my eyes.

1978
01:59:33,243 --> 01:59:34,405
SAM: You know me.

1979
01:59:34,995 --> 01:59:38,161
Do you see anything that makes
you think I would ever let...

1980
01:59:38,248 --> 01:59:40,821
someone in your condition
take my child away from me?

1981
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,118
Do you?

1982
01:59:47,466 --> 01:59:48,924
You know that won't happen.

1983
01:59:54,014 --> 01:59:55,805
SAM: And after all this time...

1984
01:59:56,058 --> 01:59:59,142
and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...

1985
01:59:59,353 --> 02:00:01,060
I could never reach her.

1986
02:00:01,355 --> 02:00:03,312
I could never make her love me.

1987
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,891
I always felt she should have gone
for all that money...

1988
02:00:07,069 --> 02:00:11,232
being somebody for the first time
in her life, a home, a kid.

1989
02:00:11,657 --> 02:00:14,194
That's not what happened.
It didn't work out that way.

1990
02:00:14,326 --> 02:00:16,532
Everything all right?
SAM: What could we do?

1991
02:00:16,662 --> 02:00:20,196
After a while, we'd just take breathers
from each other. Little separations.

1992
02:00:20,374 --> 02:00:23,956
At that time, I remember Ginger
took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.

1993
02:00:24,128 --> 02:00:25,954
She was gonna spend a week shopping.

1994
02:00:26,046 --> 02:00:29,331
OPERATOR: Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
The Beverly Hotel in Beverly Hills.

1995
02:00:29,758 --> 02:00:32,295
RECEPTIONIST: Hello, Beverly Hotel.
SAM: Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

1996
02:00:32,469 --> 02:00:35,304
RECEPTIONIST: Sorry, Mr. and Mrs.
Rothstein have checked out already.

1997
02:00:36,265 --> 02:00:38,222
Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?

1998
02:00:40,769 --> 02:00:44,220
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, they both checked out.
SAM: Thank you.

1999
02:00:50,237 --> 02:00:51,399
Hello.

2000
02:00:51,906 --> 02:00:55,275
My wife is with an old friend of hers in L.A.

2001
02:00:55,409 --> 02:00:57,615
Some lowlife named Lester Diamond.

2002
02:00:57,745 --> 02:01:00,532
My daughter's with them.
They're gonna try and kidnap her.

2003
02:01:00,664 --> 02:01:03,415
SAM: Is there anybody you can send?
MAN: We'll take care of it.

2004
02:01:09,465 --> 02:01:11,089
We got a number and an address.

2005
02:01:11,175 --> 02:01:14,793
SAM: Hello. Is this Lester?

2006
02:01:15,680 --> 02:01:16,842
Who's calling?

2007
02:01:16,931 --> 02:01:20,097
This is Sam Rothstein.
I want to talk to Ginger.

2008
02:01:20,476 --> 02:01:22,053
She's not here, Sam.

2009
02:01:22,186 --> 02:01:24,759
Listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.

2010
02:01:25,273 --> 02:01:28,973
I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.

2011
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:31,945
SAM: I know she's there. Don't fuck around.
LESTER: I wouldn't.

2012
02:01:32,947 --> 02:01:34,820
You shouldn't do this.

2013
02:01:34,949 --> 02:01:37,274
SAM: You understand?
Put her on the fucking phone.

2014
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:39,735
Sam, I don't know where she is.

2015
02:01:40,288 --> 02:01:43,407
LESTER: So, listen,
can I call you back in a few minutes?

2016
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:47,073
702-472-1862

2017
02:01:48,212 --> 02:01:49,955
LESTER: I'll call back.
SAM: Right away.

2018
02:01:50,089 --> 02:01:51,583
-Right back.
-You got it.

2019
02:01:52,633 --> 02:01:56,002
Schmuck. All right,
I just bought us a few minutes.

2020
02:01:56,429 --> 02:01:58,255
LESTER: You want to get back at this prick?

2021
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:01,466
LESTER: You got what, $2 million
in that box?

2022
02:02:02,393 --> 02:02:05,844
You got a minute?
He's got $2 million in the box, right?

2023
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:08,471
You let him keep your jewels.
We take the cash...

2024
02:02:08,566 --> 02:02:11,270
and the only other thing he cares about.
Her majesty.

2025
02:02:11,402 --> 02:02:13,643
We go to Europe. You dye your hair.

2026
02:02:13,988 --> 02:02:17,902
I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see The Elephant Man.

2027
02:02:18,034 --> 02:02:21,734
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.

2028
02:02:21,871 --> 02:02:24,112
You get plastic surgery like we talked about.

2029
02:02:24,374 --> 02:02:26,911
How much you think he'll pay
to get this kid back?

2030
02:02:27,043 --> 02:02:29,712
AMY: I don't want to go to Europe.
LESTER: Shut your mouth.

2031
02:02:29,838 --> 02:02:31,877
AMY: You shut up.
LESTER: Want me to come over?

2032
02:02:32,007 --> 02:02:34,248
LESTER: I'll smack your face.
Don't give me your shit!

2033
02:02:34,551 --> 02:02:37,006
This has always been a dream,
but now we're going.

2034
02:02:37,095 --> 02:02:40,795
-Lester, he called you here.
-Right. Ace was on the phone.

2035
02:02:40,932 --> 02:02:43,138
-I just talked to him.
-So he knows where you are.

2036
02:02:43,226 --> 02:02:45,514
That means he's sending some
guys over here now.

2037
02:02:45,604 --> 02:02:48,391
It means he's sitting
by the phone, like a dumbbell....

2038
02:02:48,857 --> 02:02:52,439
GINGER: Yeah, he's sitting by the phone
waiting for you to call him back!

2039
02:02:52,569 --> 02:02:56,436
What are we gonna do? He's probably
got guys outside the fucking house!

2040
02:02:56,573 --> 02:02:59,858
-It's this fucking bullshit of yours!
-Get your bag! Let's go!

2041
02:03:00,786 --> 02:03:04,653
-What bullshit? You want to talk it over?
-Are you done yakking?

2042
02:03:04,831 --> 02:03:06,574
Go! Get in the car!

2043
02:03:07,334 --> 02:03:09,659
Just relax. Nobody's killing anybody.

2044
02:03:09,795 --> 02:03:11,538
GINGER: I think he's gonna kill me.
NICKY: Relax.

2045
02:03:11,671 --> 02:03:15,538
Call me back here in exactly an hour
on this phone. I'll see what I can do.

2046
02:03:16,176 --> 02:03:18,713
I'll call you back in an hour at this number...

2047
02:03:18,845 --> 02:03:20,671
-and you'll be there, right?
-I'll be here.

2048
02:03:20,806 --> 02:03:24,221
Listen, don't do anything else crazy.
You all right?

2049
02:03:24,643 --> 02:03:25,923
Okay, bye.

2050
02:03:27,271 --> 02:03:29,180
GINGER: Knock it off.
LESTER: She started it.

2051
02:03:29,314 --> 02:03:30,772
She started the whole thing.

2052
02:03:30,899 --> 02:03:33,390
-Don't even think you're gonna drive.
-I'm gonna drive.

2053
02:03:33,485 --> 02:03:36,485
LESTER: I'm not gonna drive
with a crazy woman.
You're driving me nuts!

2054
02:03:36,613 --> 02:03:39,732
Get on the passenger side!
I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!

2055
02:03:56,842 --> 02:03:58,170
Can we....

2056
02:04:16,195 --> 02:04:17,475
Ginger called me.

2057
02:04:23,285 --> 02:04:25,740
NICKY: I just told you she called me.
SAM: What'd she want?

2058
02:04:28,207 --> 02:04:29,665
She was afraid to call you.

2059
02:04:30,584 --> 02:04:33,419
She's with that cocksucker again.
They got Amy.

2060
02:04:34,046 --> 02:04:37,461
She wants to come back, but she's afraid
you're gonna whack her out.

2061
02:04:37,591 --> 02:04:39,832
They're gonna kidnap my kid.
What do you want?

2062
02:04:40,261 --> 02:04:44,804
I know. Why didn't you come to me?
This is family. It ain't business.

2063
02:04:45,766 --> 02:04:49,550
Meanwhile, you made calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.

2064
02:04:49,687 --> 02:04:51,726
Back and forth, this one and that one.

2065
02:04:51,814 --> 02:04:54,518
In the meantime, she's gone anyway.
Am I right?

2066
02:04:56,235 --> 02:04:58,274
What am I going to do with this woman?

2067
02:04:59,822 --> 02:05:03,570
SAM: Driving me fucking crazy.
NICKY: I think if you...

2068
02:05:03,701 --> 02:05:07,485
assure her that she's gonna be
all right, she'll come back.

2069
02:05:08,873 --> 02:05:10,782
Driving me fucking crazy.

2070
02:05:10,917 --> 02:05:13,039
NICKY: Once you get her here, think about it.

2071
02:05:13,127 --> 02:05:15,618
Wait till you get the kid back.
She wants to come back.

2072
02:05:15,755 --> 02:05:17,877
That's the main thing here.

2073
02:05:18,716 --> 02:05:20,340
You want your kid, don't you?

2074
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:26,552
SAM: Hello.

2075
02:05:26,933 --> 02:05:31,226
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted
to talk to, right?

2076
02:05:31,354 --> 02:05:34,271
Listen, I'm not gonna
ask you where you are.

2077
02:05:34,399 --> 02:05:38,728
Just, please, put Amy on a plane
to get her here right away.

2078
02:05:39,112 --> 02:05:41,484
SAM: That's all I'm asking.
GINGER: Do you....

2079
02:05:41,781 --> 02:05:44,817
I mean, I don't think
she should go by herself.

2080
02:05:46,911 --> 02:05:48,073
What do you mean?

2081
02:05:48,788 --> 02:05:50,068
What I mean is--

2082
02:05:50,457 --> 02:05:54,205
Do you think if I came back....

2083
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:58,126
Do you think you could forgive me?

2084
02:06:00,008 --> 02:06:01,715
I gotta tell you, I don't know.

2085
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:03,674
I understand that.

2086
02:06:05,263 --> 02:06:06,721
I know I fucked up.

2087
02:06:07,807 --> 02:06:11,140
-What about the money? Where's the box?
-I gotta tell you...

2088
02:06:12,395 --> 02:06:14,968
I made some mistakes,
and I spent some money.

2089
02:06:15,106 --> 02:06:18,023
SAM: What's it under?
GINGER: Pretty serious.

2090
02:06:18,652 --> 02:06:22,649
SAM: How serious?
GINGER: It's under $25,000.

2091
02:06:22,948 --> 02:06:24,821
SAM: It's under $25,000?
GINGER: Yeah.

2092
02:06:24,908 --> 02:06:27,908
SAM: The $2 million is still there?
GINGER: Yeah, I got the rest.

2093
02:06:28,495 --> 02:06:30,202
Okay, no big deal. That's okay.

2094
02:06:31,498 --> 02:06:32,826
He got his $25,000.

2095
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,122
That I'll live with. Any more, I couldn't.

2096
02:06:36,253 --> 02:06:37,248
Okay.

2097
02:06:37,337 --> 02:06:40,955
All right, all right. Where are you?
I'll send a plane for you right away.

2098
02:06:44,886 --> 02:06:46,131
Hi, Sam.

2099
02:06:57,774 --> 02:06:59,268
So what'd you do with it?

2100
02:06:59,526 --> 02:07:00,854
With what?

2101
02:07:02,821 --> 02:07:04,363
With the money.

2102
02:07:05,657 --> 02:07:07,364
He needed some clothes.

2103
02:07:08,702 --> 02:07:10,493
$25,000 for clothes?

2104
02:07:12,331 --> 02:07:14,204
He wanted a watch, too.

2105
02:07:17,169 --> 02:07:18,960
$25,000 for clothes and a watch?

2106
02:07:22,257 --> 02:07:24,748
GINO: Good evening, signora. This way.

2107
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:27,086
SAM: The good part was I had Amy back.

2108
02:07:27,221 --> 02:07:31,432
So we went home, had the housekeeper
stay over, put the kid to bed.

2109
02:07:31,809 --> 02:07:33,931
I calmed myself down,
and we went to dinner.

2110
02:07:34,562 --> 02:07:36,554
I tried to keep things nice and civil...

2111
02:07:36,689 --> 02:07:40,686
but $25, 000 for three suits?

2112
02:07:41,569 --> 02:07:43,146
That doesn't make much sense.

2113
02:07:43,696 --> 02:07:46,187
First of all, he's not gonna wear
$1,000 suits.

2114
02:07:47,741 --> 02:07:49,567
Let's say he did, which he won't.

2115
02:07:49,827 --> 02:07:52,318
How you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

2116
02:07:54,707 --> 02:07:56,746
I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

2117
02:07:56,834 --> 02:07:59,407
I can't get fitted that fast,
and I pay twice as much.

2118
02:08:00,004 --> 02:08:01,462
I bought him a watch, too.

2119
02:08:03,424 --> 02:08:07,172
But even if you bought him a really nice
watch, one that he thought was nice...

2120
02:08:07,261 --> 02:08:09,467
he doesn't know
what the fuck a good watch is.

2121
02:08:09,597 --> 02:08:14,057
Say you go $5,000 to $12,000
at the most, which is impossible for him.

2122
02:08:15,686 --> 02:08:20,098
Plus, at the most, three suits,
$1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?

2123
02:08:20,691 --> 02:08:23,727
-Around $10,000?
-Would you knock it off, Sam?

2124
02:08:23,861 --> 02:08:27,027
SAM: I'm just trying to figure it out.
GINGER: There's nothing to figure out.

2125
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:32,319
I'm home. We're working it out.

2126
02:08:32,537 --> 02:08:35,110
But I've been told before,
"We're working it out."

2127
02:08:35,331 --> 02:08:36,873
You think that you're home...

2128
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:41,158
after what you just put me
through with Amy, is a favor to me?

2129
02:08:48,845 --> 02:08:53,720
Counting the watch, let's say
another $4,000 for expenses this weekend...

2130
02:08:54,892 --> 02:08:56,849
of which you must have had a good time.

2131
02:08:56,978 --> 02:08:58,769
I know he did. That's for sure.

2132
02:08:58,855 --> 02:09:02,555
I know that fucking piece
of shit had a good fucking time.

2133
02:09:04,485 --> 02:09:05,943
On my money.

2134
02:09:06,404 --> 02:09:09,523
You might as well have fucked him,
which you probably did anyway.

2135
02:09:11,117 --> 02:09:12,943
You're looking at me a certain way.

2136
02:09:14,579 --> 02:09:16,286
You're teary-eyed.

2137
02:09:17,290 --> 02:09:19,745
You're upset.
You're a good actress, you know that?

2138
02:09:20,502 --> 02:09:22,328
Good fucking actress.

2139
02:09:23,671 --> 02:09:25,710
SAM: You can fucking get pity out of people.

2140
02:09:25,882 --> 02:09:27,589
I'm not a john. You understand?

2141
02:09:28,051 --> 02:09:30,921
You always thought I was,
but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.

2142
02:09:32,847 --> 02:09:35,088
That fucking pimp cocksucker.

2143
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:37,223
He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

2144
02:09:37,394 --> 02:09:40,597
SAM: Lucky he's fucking living.
If you would have stayed with Amy...

2145
02:09:40,689 --> 02:09:42,728
and you had run away,
he would have been dead.

2146
02:09:42,858 --> 02:09:45,562
Both of you. Dead.
Dead.

2147
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:56,437
GINGER: No, it isn't fair.

2148
02:10:02,821 --> 02:10:05,608
He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big fucking deal?

2149
02:10:05,741 --> 02:10:08,278
I go.... Listen, I just can't fucking take it.

2150
02:10:08,410 --> 02:10:11,114
Why should I fucking take it?
That wasn't the deal.

2151
02:10:11,914 --> 02:10:15,283
He acts like I'm the only one
around here with a fucking past.

2152
02:10:15,459 --> 02:10:17,332
He'll never let me live it down.

2153
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:20,624
Well, yes, I have tried. Of course I've tried.

2154
02:10:20,756 --> 02:10:23,128
What the fuck do you think
I came back here for?

2155
02:10:24,009 --> 02:10:26,048
No, I'm not. I want to have him killed.

2156
02:10:26,595 --> 02:10:28,753
GINGER: I want him killed. I've had it.

2157
02:10:28,889 --> 02:10:31,011
So are you with me on this?

2158
02:10:32,685 --> 02:10:35,258
You want to get rid of me? Here I am.

2159
02:10:35,771 --> 02:10:37,313
Go ahead. Get rid of me.

2160
02:10:38,357 --> 02:10:41,227
SAM: Hello.
GINGER: Yes, I do!

2161
02:10:41,402 --> 02:10:45,980
GINGER: I fucking hate you!
I can't take it anymore!

2162
02:10:46,198 --> 02:10:48,985
Yes, I want to kill you!
I hate your fucking guts!

2163
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:52,072
SAM: You hate my guts?
I want you to come with me now!

2164
02:10:57,293 --> 02:10:58,621
SAM: I want you out of here!

2165
02:11:04,717 --> 02:11:06,543
Take your fucking bag and get out of here!

2166
02:11:06,677 --> 02:11:08,753
I'll go, but I want my money right now!

2167
02:11:08,888 --> 02:11:11,758
-You'll get your money! Don't worry.
-The arrangement is over.

2168
02:11:11,849 --> 02:11:14,422
SAM: No kidding!
GINGER: And I still get my money.

2169
02:11:14,602 --> 02:11:17,638
I need some cash now!
You can't just put me in the street!

2170
02:11:17,772 --> 02:11:20,309
You've never been straight with me
ever since I met you!

2171
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,558
You never even loved me in the first place!

2172
02:11:22,652 --> 02:11:25,356
I need eyes in the back
of my head with you, you bitch!

2173
02:11:25,488 --> 02:11:28,691
How could I love you?
You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!

2174
02:11:28,825 --> 02:11:32,490
SAM: You're lower than a dog!
GINGER: Fuck you!

2175
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:34,327
Here! Is this enough money?

2176
02:11:34,456 --> 02:11:36,993
Will it last you two fucking days? Take it!

2177
02:11:37,333 --> 02:11:40,369
-Greedy bitch. Take the fucking money.
-I'm going to the bank...

2178
02:11:40,503 --> 02:11:43,918
-and I'm getting my jewelry, too!
-It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.

2179
02:11:44,007 --> 02:11:47,043
Don't send your guys down there
to stop me! I mean it!

2180
02:11:47,177 --> 02:11:49,086
I guarantee you, I will not stop you.

2181
02:11:49,221 --> 02:11:51,890
You're not getting rid of me
with one fucking suitcase!

2182
02:11:52,015 --> 02:11:55,099
Come back tomorrow and get the rest.
Just get out of here.

2183
02:11:55,393 --> 02:11:57,100
GINGER: I'm taking Amy.
SAM: You're not.

2184
02:11:57,229 --> 02:11:58,687
I am. I'm waking her up right now.

2185
02:11:58,814 --> 02:12:00,936
SAM: You're stoned. You're a junkie.
Get out of here.

2186
02:12:01,024 --> 02:12:02,850
I am not! She's my daughter, too!

2187
02:12:02,984 --> 02:12:05,688
SAM: Send my lawyers a letter,
god-fucking-damn you!

2188
02:12:06,238 --> 02:12:10,282
GINGER: You're not getting away with this!
You're not gonna cut me out of my end!

2189
02:12:11,535 --> 02:12:12,910
GINGER: Fucker!

2190
02:13:05,089 --> 02:13:08,458
SAM: The funny thing was,
after all that, I didn't want her to go.

2191
02:13:09,093 --> 02:13:11,215
She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.

2192
02:13:11,929 --> 02:13:15,878
Later, I realized I didn't want
to give her the money because if I did...

2193
02:13:17,518 --> 02:13:19,178
I knew I'd never see her again.

2194
02:13:31,366 --> 02:13:33,738
Have a good day at school, okay?

2195
02:13:33,952 --> 02:13:35,410
Okay, angel.

2196
02:13:40,333 --> 02:13:43,536
From now on, I have to know
where you and Amy are at all times.

2197
02:13:46,297 --> 02:13:47,328
SAM: Here's a beeper.

2198
02:13:48,591 --> 02:13:50,133
I want you to keep it on you.

2199
02:13:50,885 --> 02:13:51,964
It's very light.

2200
02:13:52,554 --> 02:13:54,427
SAM: So I can call you whenever I have to.

2201
02:13:58,685 --> 02:13:59,799
Okay?

2202
02:14:10,489 --> 02:14:12,315
NICKY: What are you supposed to do?
What do you wanna do?

2203
02:14:12,491 --> 02:14:15,326
You want to stay the way you are?
You can't do that.

2204
02:14:15,410 --> 02:14:18,364
Two people don't get along,
at some point you gotta call it....

2205
02:14:18,497 --> 02:14:21,451
It's not my business,
but I think that's what you gotta do.

2206
02:14:21,583 --> 02:14:23,290
You're right. I know.

2207
02:14:23,585 --> 02:14:25,328
-I was just--
-What?

2208
02:14:27,214 --> 02:14:28,874
-Nothing.
-What were you gonna say?

2209
02:14:29,007 --> 02:14:31,213
-I don't--
-Tell me what you were gonna say.

2210
02:14:31,301 --> 02:14:32,415
Yeah?

2211
02:14:33,345 --> 02:14:36,714
I was thinking maybe
you know somebody at the bank...

2212
02:14:37,349 --> 02:14:39,388
who could help me get my jewelry out?

2213
02:14:39,935 --> 02:14:41,595
There's a lot of money in there.

2214
02:14:42,187 --> 02:14:45,472
I'd be willing to take care
of anybody who helped me out.

2215
02:14:47,026 --> 02:14:48,686
Let me think about that.

2216
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:53,023
Let me see who I got.
Gotta get somebody I can trust.

2217
02:14:53,532 --> 02:14:55,690
You know he's never gonna
give me my jewelry.

2218
02:14:57,119 --> 02:15:00,452
He holds that key so tight,
he's probably got it stuck up his ass.

2219
02:15:02,124 --> 02:15:04,246
You're right. That's Sammy.

2220
02:15:04,627 --> 02:15:06,500
And he's probably got it there, too.

2221
02:15:08,672 --> 02:15:11,791
He's so fucking lucky.
I could have buried him.

2222
02:15:12,426 --> 02:15:15,261
I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

2223
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:19,343
Then he'd have tracked me down,
and he'd have killed me.

2224
02:15:19,684 --> 02:15:22,221
No, he wouldn't. I would have.

2225
02:15:22,770 --> 02:15:25,687
-He'd have been right, too. Seriously.
-Come on.

2226
02:15:25,815 --> 02:15:28,519
You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.

2227
02:15:28,609 --> 02:15:32,772
I didn't. I did, but then I did exactly
what you told me to do, and I came back.

2228
02:15:32,905 --> 02:15:35,775
You did. You're right. I like that.

2229
02:15:36,492 --> 02:15:40,620
-That's what I like, you did the right thing.
-I did what you told me to.

2230
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:44,115
-Yes, you did.
-You always tell me the right thing to do.

2231
02:15:50,590 --> 02:15:53,377
He really fucked himself up
out here, didn't he?

2232
02:15:53,927 --> 02:15:56,464
-He sure did.
-Everything went to his head.

2233
02:15:59,098 --> 02:16:00,296
Changed.

2234
02:16:00,433 --> 02:16:02,888
-He did. He ain't the same person.
-No, he's not.

2235
02:16:04,771 --> 02:16:07,475
-He really thinks who the fuck he is.
-Exactly.

2236
02:16:11,444 --> 02:16:12,902
He hates me.

2237
02:16:12,988 --> 02:16:14,945
He hates my fucking guts.

2238
02:16:15,365 --> 02:16:18,282
Come on, you're a toughie.
You can take this.

2239
02:16:22,789 --> 02:16:25,955
NICKY: Don't cry.
GINGER: I'm not as tough as you think I am.

2240
02:16:26,168 --> 02:16:27,626
Yes, you are.

2241
02:16:27,961 --> 02:16:30,167
I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.

2242
02:16:30,297 --> 02:16:32,752
-I never know what he's gonna do.
-Come on.

2243
02:16:33,717 --> 02:16:36,717
-Don't be scared.
-I need some help.

2244
02:16:38,847 --> 02:16:40,507
I need some help.

2245
02:16:42,309 --> 02:16:43,684
You gotta help me.

2246
02:16:44,561 --> 02:16:46,600
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2247
02:16:47,606 --> 02:16:49,479
I do. I need a new sponsor.

2248
02:16:49,566 --> 02:16:51,392
-Is that what you want?
-Yeah.

2249
02:16:51,652 --> 02:16:53,312
-A sponsor?
-Yeah.

2250
02:16:55,572 --> 02:17:00,483
Okay. Don't worry about it.
Nobody will fuck with you anymore.

2251
02:17:01,453 --> 02:17:03,326
I'll take care of you.

2252
02:17:03,831 --> 02:17:06,701
GINGER: Thank you.
NICKY: It's what you want, isn't it?

2253
02:17:30,358 --> 02:17:31,603
MAN: That's Ace's wife.

2254
02:17:43,371 --> 02:17:45,031
MAN 2: This is great for the boss.

2255
02:18:14,777 --> 02:18:15,975
GINGER: Hi.
SAM: Hi.

2256
02:18:19,824 --> 02:18:22,397
SAM: You didn't answer your beeper.
GINGER: I threw it away.

2257
02:18:23,203 --> 02:18:24,827
You threw it away?

2258
02:18:24,913 --> 02:18:27,368
I tried to do it.
I know that you want me to, but....

2259
02:18:27,457 --> 02:18:30,244
I'm driving down the freeway
and the fucking thing beeps.

2260
02:18:30,585 --> 02:18:32,707
GINGER: I'm in a restaurant,
it's embarrassing.

2261
02:18:32,796 --> 02:18:35,713
I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy?

2262
02:18:37,384 --> 02:18:40,301
SAM: I put her to bed.
GINGER: I got your cigarettes.

2263
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:44,932
GINGER: Oscar wants you to call him.

2264
02:18:47,144 --> 02:18:49,681
SAM: So who'd you go to lunch with?
GINGER: Jennifer.

2265
02:18:49,813 --> 02:18:52,185
SAM: Where'd you go?
GINGER: To the Riviera.

2266
02:18:54,067 --> 02:18:55,229
What'd you have?

2267
02:18:56,862 --> 02:18:58,938
GINGER: I had a salad.
SAM: What did Jennifer have?

2268
02:19:01,366 --> 02:19:03,026
She had the same.

2269
02:19:04,161 --> 02:19:05,275
Okay.

2270
02:19:06,788 --> 02:19:08,827
I want you to call Jennifer...

2271
02:19:08,957 --> 02:19:12,160
and I want you to tell her
to tell you what you had for lunch.

2272
02:19:12,294 --> 02:19:14,203
I'm gonna listen in on the other line.

2273
02:19:15,130 --> 02:19:17,965
-Why do you want to do that?
-You know why I want to do it.

2274
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:20,791
-Just do it.
-Fine.

2275
02:19:21,387 --> 02:19:23,593
I just need to get the bowl for my thing.

2276
02:19:32,314 --> 02:19:33,512
The line's busy.

2277
02:19:33,649 --> 02:19:34,847
There's nobody there.

2278
02:19:42,658 --> 02:19:44,615
JENNlFER: Hello?
SAM: Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2279
02:19:47,955 --> 02:19:50,624
All right. I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.

2280
02:19:58,299 --> 02:19:59,413
Who were you with?

2281
02:20:00,968 --> 02:20:02,166
I was with somebody.

2282
02:20:03,179 --> 02:20:05,467
I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?

2283
02:20:14,148 --> 02:20:16,685
I just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

2284
02:20:19,737 --> 02:20:21,813
I just hope it's not that.

2285
02:20:25,493 --> 02:20:27,070
SAM: I knew she fucked around.

2286
02:20:27,203 --> 02:20:30,157
Yeah, she did what she did,
and I did what I had to do, but...

2287
02:20:31,207 --> 02:20:34,042
Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing
she could have done.

2288
02:20:35,378 --> 02:20:36,706
What if he won't stop?

2289
02:20:37,088 --> 02:20:39,127
SAM: It could get us both killed.

2290
02:20:39,716 --> 02:20:40,914
I can back him off.

2291
02:20:45,347 --> 02:20:47,719
SAM: She was very convincing
when she wanted to be.

2292
02:20:48,433 --> 02:20:50,805
And this is how she backed him off.

2293
02:20:57,984 --> 02:20:59,015
Hey, Ginger.

2294
02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:02,228
Don't forget, if you're challenged...

2295
02:21:02,364 --> 02:21:04,736
if he asks anything, deny everything.

2296
02:21:04,908 --> 02:21:07,908
You understand? I don't want him
bringing beefs back home.

2297
02:21:08,453 --> 02:21:10,575
That could really cause a serious problem.

2298
02:21:11,498 --> 02:21:13,574
Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?

2299
02:21:13,709 --> 02:21:15,251
You hear what I'm saying, right?

2300
02:21:15,377 --> 02:21:17,416
I know. You don't have to tell me that.

2301
02:21:17,671 --> 02:21:19,046
Do you think I'm stupid?

2302
02:21:20,799 --> 02:21:22,672
Do I think you're stupid? No.

2303
02:21:22,926 --> 02:21:26,092
I think you're beautiful. But I gotta go.

2304
02:21:29,099 --> 02:21:31,934
SAM: By this time, Nicky had things
so fucked up on the streets...

2305
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:35,595
that every time Marino went back home,
the packages got smaller and smaller.

2306
02:21:38,567 --> 02:21:40,939
It got to the point,
when he walked into the place...

2307
02:21:41,028 --> 02:21:43,732
he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.

2308
02:21:43,822 --> 02:21:45,779
REMO: Frankie, I want to ask you something.

2309
02:21:46,909 --> 02:21:48,107
It's private.

2310
02:21:48,494 --> 02:21:50,367
But I want you to tell me the truth.

2311
02:21:51,247 --> 02:21:52,871
Of course, Remo.

2312
02:21:53,290 --> 02:21:55,662
I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.

2313
02:21:57,294 --> 02:21:59,037
I always tell you the truth, Remo.

2314
02:22:00,297 --> 02:22:02,834
Frankie, the little guy...

2315
02:22:02,967 --> 02:22:05,006
he wouldn't be fucking
the Jew's wife, would he?

2316
02:22:05,136 --> 02:22:08,136
Because if he is, it's a problem.

2317
02:22:11,309 --> 02:22:12,507
FRANK: What could I say?

2318
02:22:12,768 --> 02:22:14,559
I knew if I gave the wrong answer...

2319
02:22:14,645 --> 02:22:18,892
Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them
could have wound up getting killed.

2320
02:22:19,233 --> 02:22:21,724
Because there's one thing
about these old-timers.

2321
02:22:21,903 --> 02:22:24,939
They don't like any fucking around
with the other guys' wives.

2322
02:22:25,073 --> 02:22:26,531
It's bad for business.

2323
02:22:26,616 --> 02:22:30,198
So I lied, even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi...

2324
02:22:30,453 --> 02:22:32,326
I could wind up getting killed, too.

2325
02:22:33,247 --> 02:22:37,114
-No, I ain't seen anything like that.
-Are you sure?

2326
02:22:38,503 --> 02:22:39,783
I'm positive.

2327
02:22:40,588 --> 02:22:44,502
Remo, things are very
fucked up down there.

2328
02:22:44,676 --> 02:22:46,549
I know. That's why I'm asking.

2329
02:22:46,678 --> 02:22:48,717
You see, my main concern is Nicky.

2330
02:22:49,681 --> 02:22:53,299
I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

2331
02:22:54,102 --> 02:22:58,977
-He's good, he's fine.
-I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.

2332
02:22:59,190 --> 02:23:01,229
-Do it for me.
-No problem.

2333
02:23:01,651 --> 02:23:06,526
You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing
anything for our friends.

2334
02:23:07,198 --> 02:23:08,229
You understand?

2335
02:23:08,366 --> 02:23:10,405
-I understand.
-Okay.

2336
02:23:11,703 --> 02:23:13,363
Frankie, you're a good boy.

2337
02:23:13,914 --> 02:23:15,159
Thanks, Remo.

2338
02:23:15,290 --> 02:23:18,125
SAM: By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.

2339
02:23:18,251 --> 02:23:20,077
Vegas really got to him.

2340
02:23:21,046 --> 02:23:23,418
The booze, the coke, the broads.

2341
02:23:24,800 --> 02:23:26,342
I mean, he got sloppy.

2342
02:23:27,302 --> 02:23:29,259
He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

2343
02:23:29,388 --> 02:23:31,843
FRANK: You must've drank too much.
NICKY: Fuck yourself.

2344
02:23:31,932 --> 02:23:33,971
SAM: One night, he had to belt a guy
three times...

2345
02:23:34,101 --> 02:23:35,844
before the guy finally went down.

2346
02:23:35,978 --> 02:23:38,682
In the old days,
Nicky would've decked him with one shot.

2347
02:23:38,897 --> 02:23:40,439
You add this into the mix....

2348
02:23:41,441 --> 02:23:43,682
Maybe Vegas got to all of us.

2349
02:23:44,153 --> 02:23:46,359
His crew followed him right over the edge.

2350
02:23:46,697 --> 02:23:49,152
They were all tuned up half the time
on coke.

2351
02:23:49,450 --> 02:23:52,404
They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.

2352
02:23:52,536 --> 02:23:55,287
-What do you guys want?
-Police! Stay in the car!

2353
02:23:55,414 --> 02:23:57,453
SAM: He never knew when
to keep his mouth shut.

2354
02:23:57,583 --> 02:23:59,955
COP: Drop the gun!
BLUE: Fuck you!

2355
02:24:05,049 --> 02:24:07,088
SAM: The cops shot Blue...

2356
02:24:07,218 --> 02:24:09,673
because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.

2357
02:24:10,387 --> 02:24:12,675
They could have been right,
but who knows?

2358
02:24:12,765 --> 02:24:16,632
COP: Jesus Christ! What gun?
He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.

2359
02:24:16,811 --> 02:24:19,017
COP 2: What do you want? It's pitch black.

2360
02:24:19,105 --> 02:24:21,642
COP 2: It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!
COP: You moron!

2361
02:24:21,774 --> 02:24:24,525
COP: I'll be doing paperwork for two months!
COP 2: What'll we do?

2362
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:26,152
COP 2: Sorry!
COP: You jerk-off!

2363
02:24:26,404 --> 02:24:29,773
SAM: To make matters worse...
to get even,
Nicky's crew got stoned one night...

2364
02:24:29,949 --> 02:24:32,190
and started shooting up the cops' houses.

2365
02:24:43,296 --> 02:24:46,878
It got to the point where they couldn't
talk in the Gold Rush anymore...

2366
02:24:47,008 --> 02:24:48,917
because the Feds put a wire in the wall.

2367
02:24:49,052 --> 02:24:52,052
Even when they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths...

2368
02:24:52,138 --> 02:24:54,296
because the Feds brought in lip readers.

2369
02:24:54,474 --> 02:24:57,261
Nicky found out about it from a teller
who owed him money.

2370
02:24:58,144 --> 02:25:00,516
FRANK: He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

2371
02:25:01,147 --> 02:25:03,519
NICKY: Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

2372
02:25:04,150 --> 02:25:06,475
FRANK: He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

2373
02:25:06,986 --> 02:25:08,148
NICKY: What'd you tell him?

2374
02:25:09,489 --> 02:25:11,196
FRANK: I told him I didn't know nothing.

2375
02:25:11,324 --> 02:25:14,775
FRANK: Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said
if you did anything, you're fucked up.

2376
02:25:15,996 --> 02:25:18,665
NICKY: You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

2377
02:25:19,499 --> 02:25:21,871
FRANK: No, you would have
heard something.

2378
02:25:23,003 --> 02:25:25,458
NICKY: What's to stop him?
FRANK: I know.

2379
02:25:27,716 --> 02:25:30,586
NICKY: I don't trust him anymore,
but they'd never okay anything.

2380
02:25:31,678 --> 02:25:33,385
FRANK: But they keep asking about it.

2381
02:25:34,514 --> 02:25:36,720
NICKY: Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.

2382
02:25:38,685 --> 02:25:41,520
NICKY: I got a funny feeling he's gonna start
a war or something.

2383
02:25:43,690 --> 02:25:46,726
NICKY: I'm not sure yet.
But you know what I want you to do?

2384
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:48,058
NICKY: Who's this guy?

2385
02:25:49,863 --> 02:25:51,108
FRANK: That ain't nobody.

2386
02:25:51,657 --> 02:25:53,317
NICKY: You know what I want you to do?

2387
02:25:53,909 --> 02:25:57,324
NICKY: Get some guys to dig a hole
in the desert and show you where it's at.

2388
02:25:58,622 --> 02:26:01,457
FRANK: Angelo and Buster.
NICKY: I'm not sure yet.

2389
02:26:01,875 --> 02:26:04,626
FRANK: They'll do it.
NICKY: When I'm ready, I'll say the words:

2390
02:26:04,753 --> 02:26:08,453
"Go see the Jew." And you make
it disappear. Know what I mean?

2391
02:26:08,716 --> 02:26:10,293
FRANK: Let me know.
But you gotta be ready.

2392
02:26:10,426 --> 02:26:12,217
FRANK: You know what I'm talking about?

2393
02:26:13,679 --> 02:26:15,054
NICKY: Did I say to do anything yet?

2394
02:26:15,139 --> 02:26:18,223
NICKY: I said I'm not sure. I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.

2395
02:26:18,726 --> 02:26:21,513
NICKY: Where are these pricks at?
They're in the motel?

2396
02:26:21,645 --> 02:26:24,848
FRANK: There or in the fucking bank.
I don't know. All over the joint.

2397
02:26:49,799 --> 02:26:50,961
I'll be right back.

2398
02:26:53,803 --> 02:26:56,507
Any calls for me, give them to Mr. Sherbert.

2399
02:26:56,639 --> 02:26:59,842
-Sure, Mr. Rothstein.
-I'm going home for a few seconds.

2400
02:27:08,776 --> 02:27:10,056
He's on his way home.

2401
02:27:11,738 --> 02:27:13,944
Okay.

2402
02:27:22,957 --> 02:27:25,744
Hello? Ginger?

2403
02:27:26,127 --> 02:27:28,618
AMY: Help, Daddy!
SAM: Amy!

2404
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:31,834
SAM: Amy, open the door!
AMY: I can't! I'm tied!

2405
02:27:36,805 --> 02:27:38,596
AMY: Dad!
SAM: What happened?

2406
02:27:38,723 --> 02:27:40,929
SAM: Who did this to you?
AMY: Mommy.

2407
02:27:41,309 --> 02:27:43,218
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose.

2408
02:27:43,395 --> 02:27:46,514
AMY: No, please!
SAM: Okay, I'm gonna be right back.

2409
02:27:46,648 --> 02:27:49,602
SAM: When did this happen, honey?
AMY: I don't know.

2410
02:27:49,818 --> 02:27:52,439
What time did your mother do this?
When did she leave?

2411
02:27:52,654 --> 02:27:54,112
AMY: I don't know.

2412
02:28:01,663 --> 02:28:03,157
SAM: Hello?
NICKY: Sammy.

2413
02:28:03,373 --> 02:28:05,412
SAM: Yeah. Who's this?
NICKY: Me.

2414
02:28:05,709 --> 02:28:08,081
NICKY: You okay?
SAM: No, I'm not okay.

2415
02:28:08,253 --> 02:28:10,922
-How'd you know I was here?
-I just wanted to talk to you.

2416
02:28:11,006 --> 02:28:13,841
Ginger's missing. She tied Amy up
and locked her in her room.

2417
02:28:14,009 --> 02:28:15,503
I don't know where she is.

2418
02:28:15,594 --> 02:28:18,630
Well, listen, Ginger's here
at the Leaning Tower with me.

2419
02:28:19,014 --> 02:28:20,887
She's there with you?

2420
02:28:21,016 --> 02:28:22,973
NICKY: Yeah, she's here.
SAM: I'll be right over.

2421
02:28:23,686 --> 02:28:25,014
All right.

2422
02:28:27,690 --> 02:28:29,481
-Coming over.
-Great.

2423
02:28:35,906 --> 02:28:38,028
Don't make a scene, all right?

2424
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:41,200
I want to talk to that Irish bitch.

2425
02:28:41,328 --> 02:28:43,201
She's trying to save your marriage.

2426
02:28:43,330 --> 02:28:46,034
Nicky, I want to talk to that fucking bitch.

2427
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:48,699
Be fucking nice. Calm.

2428
02:28:49,754 --> 02:28:53,454
Be nice. Don't fuck up in here.

2429
02:29:03,392 --> 02:29:05,384
GINGER: Hi.
SAM: Are you out of your mind?

2430
02:29:05,520 --> 02:29:09,564
You tie up our kid and lock the door?
Are you out of your mind?

2431
02:29:09,941 --> 02:29:12,017
That's our child. Are you out of your mind?

2432
02:29:12,151 --> 02:29:15,187
It was just for a little while.
The baby-sitter wasn't there.

2433
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:17,983
I ought to have you committed.
You do that again and I'll--

2434
02:29:18,116 --> 02:29:21,282
I was just gonna be out for a little while.

2435
02:29:21,411 --> 02:29:24,447
She was asleep. I was gonna be back...
SAM: Listen.

2436
02:29:24,581 --> 02:29:27,250
-...before she even woke up.
-Listen, you fucking cunt...

2437
02:29:27,375 --> 02:29:29,082
let me tell you something.

2438
02:29:29,335 --> 02:29:31,327
Listen to me. Listen carefully.

2439
02:29:31,504 --> 02:29:34,458
You ever touch her again
or do anything like that again...

2440
02:29:34,632 --> 02:29:36,339
I'll fucking kill you, pure and simple.

2441
02:29:36,468 --> 02:29:38,294
SAM: You hear me? Pure and simple.

2442
02:29:38,428 --> 02:29:40,467
GINGER: Why don't you let me go?
SAM: I'll kill you.

2443
02:29:40,555 --> 02:29:43,306
SAM: You fucking whore.
I'll sign anything you want me to sign.

2444
02:29:43,433 --> 02:29:46,268
I just want the key to my jewelry,
and you to let me go.

2445
02:29:46,353 --> 02:29:48,345
SAM: Want your jewelry?
GINGER: Let me go.

2446
02:29:48,438 --> 02:29:50,596
And let you disgrace me, you pig?

2447
02:29:50,732 --> 02:29:52,689
SAM: Get up and be a mother.

2448
02:29:52,817 --> 02:29:54,441
Get in the car and go home right now.

2449
02:29:54,569 --> 02:29:55,767
Get up and get in....

2450
02:29:57,781 --> 02:30:00,984
-Get up.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.

2451
02:30:01,117 --> 02:30:03,405
-I wouldn't do that--
-Get up!

2452
02:30:03,537 --> 02:30:05,743
Are you threatening me?

2453
02:30:05,831 --> 02:30:08,404
I'll fucking kill you in this place.
Get up and go home.

2454
02:30:08,542 --> 02:30:09,870
I'm going!

2455
02:30:17,009 --> 02:30:18,882
Now you need approval
from him to go home?

2456
02:30:18,969 --> 02:30:22,384
So what? Who blew you in the parking lot
before you came in?

2457
02:30:22,514 --> 02:30:24,636
You make me sick, you fuck.

2458
02:30:25,017 --> 02:30:27,554
-Once a hooker, always a hooker.
-Oh, fuck you!

2459
02:30:27,686 --> 02:30:29,559
Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!

2460
02:30:38,072 --> 02:30:40,064
Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.

2461
02:30:40,157 --> 02:30:42,482
BILLY: Who's this?
SAM: Listen, I'll explain later.

2462
02:30:42,618 --> 02:30:45,287
You got a gun at home?
Bring it over right away.

2463
02:30:45,371 --> 02:30:47,410
-Take it easy. I'll do it.
-Okay.

2464
02:30:52,294 --> 02:30:53,669
Leave it where it is!

2465
02:30:56,340 --> 02:30:58,961
Where is he? I want that Jew bastard killed!

2466
02:30:59,135 --> 02:31:01,008
Hide her car in the back.

2467
02:31:01,137 --> 02:31:03,924
GINGER: There's no reason to hide my car!
He already knows!

2468
02:31:05,016 --> 02:31:07,886
Supposing he goes back home
and makes a fucking beef?

2469
02:31:08,019 --> 02:31:12,182
-I gotta know exactly what you said. Tell me.
-Me? Nothing. I said....

2470
02:31:12,273 --> 02:31:15,357
I said, no. Everything he said,
I just kept saying no.

2471
02:31:15,484 --> 02:31:17,441
I told you this was fucking dangerous.

2472
02:31:17,528 --> 02:31:21,312
I said, "Ginger, this is
a dangerous situation. Be very careful."

2473
02:31:21,449 --> 02:31:24,319
If it's so fucking dangerous,
why don't you kill him?

2474
02:31:24,410 --> 02:31:26,651
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up.

2475
02:31:26,788 --> 02:31:30,620
-Have him killed, and get it over with!
-Don't be such a fucking smart-ass!

2476
02:31:30,750 --> 02:31:34,201
I know the guy 35 years,
I'm gonna whack him for you?

2477
02:31:35,380 --> 02:31:36,838
NICKY: Motherfucker.

2478
02:31:37,715 --> 02:31:41,048
-I knew it.
-What about my money?

2479
02:31:42,095 --> 02:31:44,632
How the fuck am I gonna
get your money now?

2480
02:31:44,764 --> 02:31:47,515
You think he'll give you money?
Are you out of your mind?

2481
02:31:47,642 --> 02:31:49,468
-Look what you did to this guy.
-What?

2482
02:31:49,561 --> 02:31:51,802
If you'd just kept your fucking mouth shut.

2483
02:31:51,938 --> 02:31:54,642
What's the use!
I should have never got involved--

2484
02:31:58,737 --> 02:32:00,112
Hey! You motherfucker, you!

2485
02:32:00,238 --> 02:32:02,729
GINGER: You fucker!
NICKY: Get the fuck out!

2486
02:32:04,451 --> 02:32:06,028
NICKY: Get the fuck out!

2487
02:32:07,871 --> 02:32:09,993
GINGER: No!
NICKY: Get down there! Take it easy!

2488
02:32:10,081 --> 02:32:12,618
NICKY: I shouldn't have gotten involved
with this nut!

2489
02:32:12,751 --> 02:32:14,873
FRANK: You'll kill her. Take it easy.

2490
02:32:15,045 --> 02:32:17,203
NICKY: Get her out of here.

2491
02:32:17,714 --> 02:32:18,994
FRANK: Let's go.

2492
02:32:23,261 --> 02:32:27,128
I don't need you!
I'll get my own fucking money!

2493
02:32:28,433 --> 02:32:31,137
I'm going to the FBI!
I'm not scared anymore!

2494
02:32:31,269 --> 02:32:34,803
NICKY: All right. Be careful.
GINGER: You've fucked with me
for the last time!

2495
02:32:35,107 --> 02:32:36,482
Okay. Yeah.

2496
02:32:38,110 --> 02:32:39,390
NICKY: Careful.

2497
02:32:39,653 --> 02:32:41,147
Come on. Get inside.

2498
02:32:42,656 --> 02:32:44,363
Look at this. Motherfucker.

2499
02:32:48,120 --> 02:32:51,489
I fucked up, Frankie.
I fucked up good this time.

2500
02:32:52,082 --> 02:32:54,537
I should never have started
with this fucking broad.

2501
02:32:55,544 --> 02:32:58,117
Take it easy. What could you do?

2502
02:32:58,255 --> 02:33:00,294
FRANK: I mean, she threw herself
at you, right?

2503
02:33:03,552 --> 02:33:06,671
I'm in a bad fucking spot here.
You know that?

2504
02:33:09,350 --> 02:33:10,512
A bad fucking spot.

2505
02:33:26,826 --> 02:33:28,403
SAM: I left the kid with neighbors.

2506
02:33:28,536 --> 02:33:30,243
I had $1 million in cash and jewels...

2507
02:33:30,329 --> 02:33:32,487
that I gave to Sherbert
to lock up in the hotel.

2508
02:33:32,832 --> 02:33:35,369
Put this in the hotel safe
and I want you to come back.

2509
02:34:07,867 --> 02:34:10,239
She's alone. Take the gun
and go into Amy's....

2510
02:34:10,370 --> 02:34:13,620
SAM: Just wait there for me.
GINGER: Get down here and talk to me!

2511
02:34:15,125 --> 02:34:18,328
You can't fucking ignore me,
you motherfucker!

2512
02:34:18,628 --> 02:34:23,503
GINGER: I mean it! Come down here
right now!

2513
02:34:23,633 --> 02:34:26,468
GINGER: Get down here and talk to me,
God damn it!

2514
02:34:27,053 --> 02:34:29,757
GINGER: Fuck you! Goddamn you,
come out here!

2515
02:34:29,890 --> 02:34:33,305
GINGER: I'm going to drive this fucking car
through the living room!

2516
02:34:34,311 --> 02:34:38,260
GINGER: You fucking coward!
You motherfucker!

2517
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:42,389
GINGER: Come out here and talk to me.
SAM: Will you stop it?

2518
02:34:42,527 --> 02:34:44,318
SAM: You're drunk. You're on drugs.
GINGER: I am not!

2519
02:34:44,404 --> 02:34:48,900
-You'll be sorry if you don't stop.
-Don't you threaten me!

2520
02:34:49,952 --> 02:34:52,573
GINGER: You're not threatening me anymore!

2521
02:34:52,746 --> 02:34:56,197
You fuck! I'm sick of you!

2522
02:34:56,291 --> 02:35:00,668
I am fucking Nicky Santoro!
He's my new sponsor!

2523
02:35:00,921 --> 02:35:03,246
How about that, you fuckhead!

2524
02:35:03,424 --> 02:35:05,546
What are you looking at? Fuck off!

2525
02:35:05,634 --> 02:35:09,133
Go back inside!
This is none of your business!

2526
02:35:09,346 --> 02:35:11,837
GINGER: I don't have to take
your shit anymore!

2527
02:35:11,932 --> 02:35:14,469
I'm going to the FBI! I'll go to the police!

2528
02:35:14,601 --> 02:35:17,934
-I am not protecting you anymore!
-Mrs. Rothstein--

2529
02:35:18,272 --> 02:35:20,430
GINGER: He won't let me inside!

2530
02:35:21,483 --> 02:35:25,860
Mr. Rothstein, we've been getting
some complaints about the noise.

2531
02:35:25,946 --> 02:35:28,781
I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in.

2532
02:35:28,908 --> 02:35:30,947
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy.

2533
02:35:31,243 --> 02:35:33,816
I won't, the way she's behaving.
GINGER: Won't let me in?

2534
02:35:33,954 --> 02:35:35,578
SAM: Who knows what you'll do there.

2535
02:35:35,664 --> 02:35:37,537
I've been in the same clothes for two days!

2536
02:35:37,667 --> 02:35:39,873
-I want to get my things! Big deal!
-Okay.

2537
02:35:39,961 --> 02:35:43,080
Let her in to get a few things.
That way she'll leave.

2538
02:35:43,214 --> 02:35:45,123
COP: This is half her house.
SAM: I'm afraid.

2539
02:35:45,258 --> 02:35:47,583
GINGER: You aren't afraid!
SAM: She'll destroy stuff.

2540
02:35:47,802 --> 02:35:49,759
-Let me in the house!
-Hey!

2541
02:35:50,638 --> 02:35:53,211
-Fucker!
-Hold on! Please!

2542
02:35:53,349 --> 02:35:55,222
GINGER: You should be afraid,
the way you treat me!

2543
02:35:55,351 --> 02:35:57,260
It'll make it easier on everybody.

2544
02:35:57,395 --> 02:35:59,932
COP: If we let her get her things,
we'll be out of your hair.

2545
02:36:00,064 --> 02:36:02,103
If she calms down, I'll let her in.

2546
02:36:02,191 --> 02:36:04,563
GINGER: I am calm!
SAM: If she calms down...

2547
02:36:05,695 --> 02:36:07,652
I will let her in for five minutes...

2548
02:36:07,822 --> 02:36:11,606
if you gentlemen will escort her out
if she won't leave.

2549
02:36:11,784 --> 02:36:13,776
-Can I go in?
-That's not a problem.

2550
02:36:13,912 --> 02:36:17,245
-Jeff, would you go in with her?
-Yes. Fine! Fuck you!

2551
02:36:20,335 --> 02:36:24,035
GINGER: You wouldn't believe how mean
he is. He's locked up my papers.

2552
02:36:24,172 --> 02:36:26,627
I have to get them.
Don't let him come up here...

2553
02:36:26,716 --> 02:36:29,633
because I know they're in here
in the desk. Fuck.

2554
02:36:32,847 --> 02:36:35,420
GINGER: Pay attention.
He could come up here at anytime.

2555
02:36:39,521 --> 02:36:41,560
Are you watching for him?

2556
02:36:43,859 --> 02:36:45,057
GINGER: Got them.

2557
02:36:46,194 --> 02:36:48,767
I don't want her in there
more than a few more minutes.

2558
02:36:48,905 --> 02:36:51,905
It'll just be a couple minutes.
We got other things to do, too.

2559
02:36:54,578 --> 02:36:56,285
He'll hurry her up.

2560
02:36:56,872 --> 02:36:59,113
-How's everything else?
-Fine.

2561
02:36:59,333 --> 02:37:03,413
-How's your family?
-Not bad. In fact, my wife's pregnant again.

2562
02:37:04,546 --> 02:37:06,585
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

2563
02:37:07,883 --> 02:37:09,377
We're happy about that.

2564
02:37:09,468 --> 02:37:12,587
I just have to get this one more thing,
then we can go.

2565
02:37:13,305 --> 02:37:15,262
GINGER: Shit! Fuck!

2566
02:37:16,225 --> 02:37:17,553
GINGER: Shit! God!

2567
02:37:18,227 --> 02:37:20,682
GINGER: That pisses me off! Don't worry.

2568
02:37:22,898 --> 02:37:23,893
It would be great...

2569
02:37:24,024 --> 02:37:25,601
if you could follow me out of here...

2570
02:37:25,734 --> 02:37:27,477
because he's been threatening me!

2571
02:37:27,736 --> 02:37:29,562
Take care. Thank you.

2572
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:51,126
[Crying] I can't believe this.

2573
02:38:02,271 --> 02:38:05,722
GINGER: I just need to pick up a little cash.
Could you come with me?

2574
02:38:12,198 --> 02:38:15,401
SAM: You've got to stop her.
CHARLIE: I'm sorry, Sam.

2575
02:38:15,618 --> 02:38:18,654
CHARLIE: What can I do?
SAM: She's a junkie. She's out of her mind!

2576
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:21,071
She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.

2577
02:38:21,207 --> 02:38:23,911
There's nothing I can do. I'd like to help...

2578
02:38:24,127 --> 02:38:26,084
-but I can't.
-Legally, she can't take it.

2579
02:38:26,212 --> 02:38:28,785
SAM: She can't. Half of it is mine.
CHARLIE: Listen to me.

2580
02:38:28,965 --> 02:38:31,835
CHARLIE: There's nothing I can do.
SAM: I'm coming down.

2581
02:38:44,689 --> 02:38:46,562
Shit! God damn it!

2582
02:38:48,068 --> 02:38:51,852
I'll need a bag. Could you
ask the guy for the big bag?

2583
02:38:51,988 --> 02:38:54,027
COP: Go get a bag, man.
GINGER: Here.

2584
02:38:54,324 --> 02:38:57,527
-Lady, I can't take it.
-You can. You've been so nice to me.

2585
02:38:58,995 --> 02:39:02,364
GINGER: Yes, just hold the top open.
All right? And I can....

2586
02:39:06,211 --> 02:39:08,880
Oh, God! It's him. You have to stop him.

2587
02:39:09,005 --> 02:39:10,831
'Cause he said he was gonna kill me.

2588
02:39:12,676 --> 02:39:14,917
COP: Mr. Rothstein, wait a minute.

2589
02:39:15,762 --> 02:39:17,469
COP: Hold on a second.

2590
02:39:17,764 --> 02:39:20,967
SAM: She's driving away.
COP: There's nothing we can do.

2591
02:39:21,184 --> 02:39:23,472
-There's nothing we can do.
-Look, look.

2592
02:39:23,770 --> 02:39:26,806
You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.

2593
02:39:27,274 --> 02:39:30,974
COP: Nothing we can do. She had the key.
COP 2: She's on the account.

2594
02:39:31,111 --> 02:39:34,230
-Let's pull her over at that Citgo Station.
-Okay. Let's do it.

2595
02:39:45,876 --> 02:39:48,663
-We're placing you under arrest.
-For what?

2596
02:39:48,796 --> 02:39:51,750
-For aiding and abetting--
-For what?

2597
02:39:52,049 --> 02:39:55,334
-For aiding and abetting--
-I'm just trying to leave.

2598
02:39:55,594 --> 02:39:57,551
SAM: After all the threats and bullshit...

2599
02:39:57,680 --> 02:39:59,719
it turned out
Ginger didn't tell them anything.

2600
02:39:59,807 --> 02:40:02,843
But, by then,
the Feds didn't need her anyway.

2601
02:40:03,436 --> 02:40:06,390
They had all the pieces they needed.
But I didn't do anything.

2602
02:40:06,522 --> 02:40:11,314
SAM: Everyone began to tumble,
like dominoes.
FBI! We have a warrant!

2603
02:40:11,902 --> 02:40:14,274
SAM: Between Piscano complaining
on the wire...

2604
02:40:14,405 --> 02:40:17,441
between Nicky, Ginger, me and my license...

2605
02:40:17,742 --> 02:40:21,442
paradise. We managed to really fuck it up.

2606
02:40:21,579 --> 02:40:24,829
NICKY JR.: Mom.
JENNIFER: Someone's at the door now.

2607
02:40:24,957 --> 02:40:27,115
FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

2608
02:40:27,251 --> 02:40:30,287
NICKY: I got wind of the pinches
coming down, so I took off.

2609
02:40:30,421 --> 02:40:32,330
Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?

2610
02:40:32,465 --> 02:40:34,587
-I'm Mark Casper, FBI.
-Yeah?

2611
02:40:34,759 --> 02:40:36,301
Can I make a fucking phone call?

2612
02:40:36,427 --> 02:40:38,918
Yes, but you don't have to talk to us
like that.

2613
02:40:39,013 --> 02:40:42,013
FBI AGENT: Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.

2614
02:40:42,100 --> 02:40:45,551
NICKY: They got almost everybody else.
FBI AGENT: This area is seized!

2615
02:40:45,937 --> 02:40:49,471
-Get the master account list.
-I want all those papers seized.

2616
02:40:53,445 --> 02:40:55,567
FBI AGENT: Put every box on the table.

2617
02:41:02,495 --> 02:41:05,531
Yes. Here we are. Little craps figures.

2618
02:41:06,249 --> 02:41:07,791
SAM: Green? Don't even ask.

2619
02:41:07,876 --> 02:41:10,627
-...$30,000 of yours.
-No. That's why it wasn't valid.

2620
02:41:10,754 --> 02:41:13,957
I was being extorted.
I'll tell you what you want to know.

2621
02:41:14,090 --> 02:41:16,129
PHlLlP: I've got nothing to hide.
NICKY: Now for the best.

2622
02:41:16,218 --> 02:41:20,595
I couldn't believe this shit.
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.

2623
02:41:20,722 --> 02:41:24,091
Oh, this is good.
NICKY: He might as well give them
a blueprint.

2624
02:41:24,184 --> 02:41:27,387
Everybody's names, addresses,
dates, everything.

2625
02:41:27,813 --> 02:41:31,182
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.

2626
02:41:31,316 --> 02:41:34,067
-Those are my mother's books.
-You're under arrest.

2627
02:41:34,152 --> 02:41:36,643
NICKY: What a fucking balloon head.
ARTIE: What are you doing?

2628
02:41:36,780 --> 02:41:38,902
AGENT: Take it easy.
WIFE: Wait!

2629
02:41:39,116 --> 02:41:40,989
WIFE: Wait! He's sick!
COP: Move back.

2630
02:41:41,243 --> 02:41:43,365
WIFE: It's his heart! Is he breathing?
COP 2: CPR now!

2631
02:41:43,704 --> 02:41:45,696
SAM: Artie got so upset
he had a heart attack...

2632
02:41:45,831 --> 02:41:47,907
and dropped dead right in front of his wife.

2633
02:41:48,250 --> 02:41:50,123
-Calm down!
-No, I won't calm down!

2634
02:41:50,210 --> 02:41:52,416
-He's my husband! Artie!
-We can't help him if--

2635
02:41:56,383 --> 02:41:57,711
SAM: At the end of the day...

2636
02:41:57,843 --> 02:42:00,298
they finally came to see me
with the pictures.

2637
02:42:00,429 --> 02:42:02,966
FBI AGENT: Why protect a friend
who betrayed you?

2638
02:42:03,098 --> 02:42:04,971
SAM: But I didn't want to look at them...

2639
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:06,558
or the guys who brought them.

2640
02:42:10,272 --> 02:42:13,687
COUNSELOR: Your Honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

2641
02:42:13,859 --> 02:42:16,943
COUNSELOR: Any incarceration could pose
a serious health risk.

2642
02:42:17,113 --> 02:42:19,319
NICKY: When they were arrested,
some were so old...

2643
02:42:19,448 --> 02:42:21,239
they needed doctors at their arraignment.

2644
02:42:21,367 --> 02:42:24,451
COUNSELOR: Pre-trial services
recommends that bail remain as set.

2645
02:42:24,537 --> 02:42:27,158
JUDGE: Take recess.
NICKY: When it looked like they'd get...

2646
02:42:27,331 --> 02:42:30,285
25 years to life in prison
just for skimming a casino...

2647
02:42:30,376 --> 02:42:33,579
sick or no fucking sick, you knew
people were going to get clipped.

2648
02:42:34,922 --> 02:42:39,133
So the day of the arraignment, they had
this meeting in the back of the courthouse.

2649
02:42:39,343 --> 02:42:43,423
When something like this happens,
you know how things are gonna work out.

2650
02:42:43,556 --> 02:42:47,849
It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?

2651
02:42:47,935 --> 02:42:50,770
He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

2652
02:42:51,064 --> 02:42:53,021
Stand-up guy just like his old man.

2653
02:42:53,483 --> 02:42:54,977
That's the way I see it.

2654
02:42:55,234 --> 02:42:58,603
I agree. He's solid. He's a fucking Marine.

2655
02:42:59,364 --> 02:43:03,313
He's okay. He always was.
What do you think?

2656
02:43:05,161 --> 02:43:08,909
Look, why take a chance?

2657
02:43:11,292 --> 02:43:13,331
At least that's the way I feel about it.

2658
02:43:14,254 --> 02:43:17,457
ANDY: Call Artie. Tell him I don't care what...

2659
02:43:17,590 --> 02:43:19,629
he's gotta be in my office
Thursday morning.

2660
02:43:19,759 --> 02:43:20,754
It's done.

2661
02:43:20,885 --> 02:43:23,839
It's terribly important. I gotta
have a conversation with him.

2662
02:43:32,147 --> 02:43:34,816
NICKY: As much as they liked him,
he wasn't one of us.

2663
02:43:34,941 --> 02:43:38,191
He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew,
he could have talked.

2664
02:43:38,320 --> 02:43:40,561
Otherwise, he'd still be alive.

2665
02:43:45,160 --> 02:43:47,448
The first one to skip was John Nance.

2666
02:43:47,579 --> 02:43:50,615
He found a nice,
warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.

2667
02:43:50,832 --> 02:43:52,908
He thought nobody would find him there.

2668
02:44:14,189 --> 02:44:17,106
NICKY: But then his kid got nabbed
by the Feds for drugs.

2669
02:44:17,234 --> 02:44:20,318
So naturally, the bosses were afraid
he'd come out of hiding...

2670
02:44:20,446 --> 02:44:22,652
just to save his kid and give them all up.

2671
02:44:23,574 --> 02:44:24,688
So....

2672
02:44:27,578 --> 02:44:29,238
Where you going, jag-off?

2673
02:44:31,290 --> 02:44:33,448
NICKY: But, anyway, they all had to follow.

2674
02:44:33,542 --> 02:44:35,000
Everybody went down.

2675
02:44:35,086 --> 02:44:36,366
Fuck you.

2676
02:44:42,051 --> 02:44:43,249
NICKY: Before you knew it...

2677
02:44:43,344 --> 02:44:45,799
anybody who knew anything
wound up getting whacked.

2678
02:44:54,730 --> 02:44:56,105
GINGER: Oh, no! No!

2679
02:45:02,071 --> 02:45:04,608
SAM: After Ginger took off,
she wasn't much help to anybody.

2680
02:45:04,741 --> 02:45:08,441
She found some pimps, lowlifes,
druggies, and bikers in L.A.

2681
02:45:08,745 --> 02:45:11,699
In a few months, they went through
all the money and jewels.

2682
02:45:38,149 --> 02:45:39,726
After they found her body...

2683
02:45:40,568 --> 02:45:42,856
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.

2684
02:45:46,616 --> 02:45:48,988
He said they gave her a hot dose.

2685
02:45:49,494 --> 02:45:54,405
In the end, all she had left was $3, 600
in mint condition coins.

2686
02:46:16,104 --> 02:46:19,769
No matter what the Feds or the papers
said about my car bombing...

2687
02:46:21,693 --> 02:46:23,732
it was amateur night, you could tell.

2688
02:46:23,946 --> 02:46:27,611
Whoever it was, they put the dynamite
under the passenger side.

2689
02:46:27,741 --> 02:46:31,359
But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew...

2690
02:46:31,662 --> 02:46:35,873
was that, that model car was made with
a metal plate under the driver's seat.

2691
02:46:36,875 --> 02:46:38,997
It's the only thing that saved my life.

2692
02:46:51,766 --> 02:46:55,977
The bombing was never authorized,
but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.

2693
02:46:57,396 --> 02:46:59,222
So did the powers that be.

2694
02:46:59,440 --> 02:47:01,147
NICKY: How are you?
BOSS: How you doing?

2695
02:47:01,233 --> 02:47:03,309
NICKY: It took months for everything
to calm down.

2696
02:47:03,569 --> 02:47:05,894
But finally, my guys got out on bail.

2697
02:47:06,030 --> 02:47:09,529
The bosses wanted me to send
my brother Dominick out to Vegas.

2698
02:47:09,659 --> 02:47:12,695
Always the fucking dollars.

2699
02:47:13,079 --> 02:47:16,613
I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go
near Vegas.

2700
02:47:16,749 --> 02:47:19,370
So I set up a meeting
with the guys way out in the sticks.

2701
02:47:19,502 --> 02:47:22,705
I didn't want my brother to get
fucked around. What's right is right.

2702
02:47:22,839 --> 02:47:24,463
They don't give a fuck about--

2703
02:47:26,050 --> 02:47:27,674
THUG: Holy fucking....

2704
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:29,791
NICKY: What the fuck....

2705
02:47:29,929 --> 02:47:31,802
Come on, motherfucker!

2706
02:47:32,974 --> 02:47:35,974
Tough guys! You and your fucking brother!

2707
02:47:36,269 --> 02:47:39,353
You fucking scumbags! No more!

2708
02:47:42,317 --> 02:47:45,935
-Frankie!
-No more! You see? Watch!

2709
02:47:48,907 --> 02:47:52,607
NICKY: Frankie! You piece of shit!
FRANK: Fuck you!

2710
02:47:53,495 --> 02:47:56,910
NICKY: Fucking punk! Piece of shit!

2711
02:48:00,043 --> 02:48:01,585
No!

2712
02:48:01,878 --> 02:48:03,870
Take this motherfucker out!

2713
02:48:14,641 --> 02:48:17,760
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone. Frankie.

2714
02:48:22,524 --> 02:48:24,896
FRANK: All right. Strip him.

2715
02:48:25,694 --> 02:48:28,564
NICKY: No balls. You got no fucking balls.

2716
02:48:29,323 --> 02:48:30,781
Oh, Dominick!

2717
02:48:38,457 --> 02:48:39,832
NICKY: Dominick.

2718
02:49:03,649 --> 02:49:04,894
FRANK: Come on.

2719
02:49:08,320 --> 02:49:09,778
THUG: Bury them?
FRANK: Bury them.

2720
02:49:13,409 --> 02:49:14,440
SAM: The word was out.

2721
02:49:14,535 --> 02:49:17,156
The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.

2722
02:49:17,455 --> 02:49:22,033
How much were they gonna take? So they
made an example of him and his brother.

2723
02:49:23,169 --> 02:49:25,541
They buried them while they were
still breathing.

2724
02:49:43,189 --> 02:49:45,228
MAN: You all right? Watch out!

2725
02:49:50,864 --> 02:49:53,105
MAN: Mister, you all right?
SAM: Yeah.

2726
02:49:54,909 --> 02:49:56,569
SAM: They had other ideas for me.

2727
02:50:06,629 --> 02:50:08,502
MEDIC: We need some help over here!

2728
02:50:10,508 --> 02:50:11,706
MEDIC 2: You sure are lucky, mister.

2729
02:50:30,445 --> 02:50:32,437
SAM: The town will never be the same.

2730
02:50:33,156 --> 02:50:36,904
After the Tangiers,
the big corporations took it all over.

2731
02:50:37,828 --> 02:50:39,452
Today it looks like Disneyland.

2732
02:50:47,671 --> 02:50:49,710
While the kids play cardboard pirates...

2733
02:50:49,840 --> 02:50:53,209
Mommy and Daddy drop the house
payments and junior's college money...

2734
02:50:53,343 --> 02:50:55,086
on the poker slots.

2735
02:50:59,433 --> 02:51:02,967
In the old days, dealers knew your name,
what you drank, what you played.

2736
02:51:03,062 --> 02:51:05,101
Today, it's like checking into an airport.

2737
02:51:05,272 --> 02:51:08,475
If you order room service,
you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.

2738
02:51:09,818 --> 02:51:13,187
Today it's all gone. A whale shows up
with $4 million in a suitcase...

2739
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:17,657
and some 25-year-old hotel school kid
will want his Social Security number.

2740
02:51:19,745 --> 02:51:21,903
After the Teamsters got knocked out
of the box...

2741
02:51:21,997 --> 02:51:25,412
the corporations tore down practically
every one of the old casinos.

2742
02:51:26,335 --> 02:51:29,205
And where did the money come from
to rebuild the pyramids?

2743
02:51:30,256 --> 02:51:31,750
Junk bonds.

2744
02:51:37,221 --> 02:51:38,763
SAM: Still not sure?

2745
02:51:39,432 --> 02:51:41,305
SAM: Probable. Maybe questionable.

2746
02:51:41,392 --> 02:51:43,883
SAM: All right, let me know as soon
as you can find out.

2747
02:51:45,271 --> 02:51:48,390
SAM: In the end, I wound up
right back where I started.

2748
02:51:48,483 --> 02:51:50,274
I could still pick winners...

2749
02:51:50,401 --> 02:51:53,686
and I could still make money
for all kinds of people back home.

2750
02:51:53,863 --> 02:51:55,487
And why mess up a good thing?

2751
02:51:56,950 --> 02:51:58,574
And that's that!
