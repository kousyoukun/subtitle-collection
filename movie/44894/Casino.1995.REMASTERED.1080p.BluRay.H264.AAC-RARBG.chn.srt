1
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,960
真實故事改編

2
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,220
1983年

3
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,240
當你愛一個人，你必須相信他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: [Voiceover] When you love someone, you've gotta trust them.{\r}

4
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,610
別無它法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's no other way.{\r}

5
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,200
你得將掌管生命中一切的那把鑰匙給他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.{\r}

6
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,790
要不然有什么意義？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Otherwise, what's the point?{\r}

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,380
一直以來，我深信我擁有的是這樣的愛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And, for a while, I believed that's the kind of love I had.{\r}

8
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,200
在我開賭場及被炸之前…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Before I ever ran a casino, or got blown up...{\r}

9
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,870
艾斯羅斯坦，可是最屌的賽馬預測者
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper.{\r}

10
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,160
我告訴你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can tell you that.{\r}

11
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,330
我旺到每次只要我下注，全國的賭盤賠率…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was so good that whenever I bet, I'd change the odds...{\r}

12
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,120
都會隨著改變
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}for every bookmaker in the country.{\r}

13
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,590
不蓋你，我對賽馬的研究精湛到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm serious, I had it down so cold...{\r}

14
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,080
讓我晉升人間天堂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that I was given paradise on Earth.{\r}

15
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,680
我被升為拉斯維加斯最大賭場之一《坦吉樂》的管理人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...{\r}

16
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,050
唯有聘請我的那幫人才能如此大手筆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money.{\r}

17
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,060
六千兩百七十萬美元
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$62, 700, 000.{\r}

18
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,020
我不知道細節
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know all the details.{\r}

19
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,730
老實說，沒人知道細節…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: [Voiceover] In fact, nobody knew all the details...{\r}

20
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,410
原本應該很完美的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but it should've been perfect.{\r}

21
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,780
他有我這好友尼奇山多羅挺他…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass...{\r}

22
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,660
他手中也攬著他愛的女人，金吉兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.{\r}

23
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,870
到頭來，我們全搞砸了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But in the end, we fucked it all up.{\r}

24
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,090
原本應多完美
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It should've been so sweet, too.{\r}

25
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,750
結果，我們這樣的小混混…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It turned out to be the last time that street guys like us...{\r}

26
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,550
在這次之后就再也無緣搞油水這么豐富的大生意了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}were ever given anything that fucking valuable again.{\r}

27
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
那時的賭城，是蠢蛋們…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Vegas was a place where suckers...{\r}

28
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,730
一毛一毛存足了錢飛來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}flew in every year on their own nickel...{\r}

29
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,900
直到輸光了家當才走人的地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and left behind about a billion dollars.{\r}

30
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,240
在夜晚，你看不到包圍拉斯維加斯的沙漠
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.{\r}

31
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,110
但城里許多的問題卻都是在沙漠里解決的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.{\r}

32
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,250
沙漠里的坑洞可多著呢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Got a lot of holes in the desert...{\r}

33
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,750
里面埋藏了很多問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.{\r}

34
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,160
只是程序要對
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Except you gotta do it right.{\r}

35
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,920
你得先把洞挖好…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta have the hole already dug...{\r}

36
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,260
再將貨從汽車后車箱載來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}before you show up with a package in the trunk.{\r}

37
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,210
要不然你就得在沙漠挖上個30到45分鐘
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Otherwise, you're talking about 30 or 45 minutes of digging.{\r}

38
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,970
誰又知道期間會有什么人出現？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who knows who's gonna be coming along in that time?{\r}

39
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,940
不知不覺中，你又得多挖好幾個洞
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes.{\r}

40
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,900
搞不好一整晚都得耗在那兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You could be there all fucking night.{\r}

41
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,810
公爵

42
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,480
坦吉樂

43
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,670
精華地段-拉斯維加斯，十年前
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}THE STRIP - LAS VEGAS TEN YEARS EARLIER{\r}

44
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,490
誰抗拒的了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Who could resist?{\r}

45
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,340
在別處，我只是個登記賽馬的一個賭徒…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Anywhere else, I was a bookie, a gambler...{\r}

46
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,750
老是得小心翼翼，成天被條子們騷擾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}always looking over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night.{\r}

47
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,800
但在這兒，我可是羅斯坦先生
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.{\r}

48
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,600
不但不偷雞摸狗，還管間賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino.{\r}

49
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,440
那就像是將夢想換為現金
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And that's like selling people dreams for cash.{\r}

50
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,600
我聘任了賭場的一個老朋友 比利雪伯當經理，然后開始工作
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager, and went to work.{\r}

51
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,320
這是負責牌室的羅尼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room.{\r}

52
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,950
像我們這種人 拉斯維加斯洗去了我們的罪孽
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins.{\r}

53
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,070
像是道德洗車場一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's like a morality car wash.{\r}

54
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,660
它對我們的效用就像法國露德 對駝背和殘障的人一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.{\r}

55
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,720
不但讓我們重見天日…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: And along with making us legit...{\r}

56
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,800
還帶來了現金，數不盡的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}comes cash, tons of it.{\r}

57
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,770
不然你以為我們沒事 跑到這沙漠中央干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What do you think we're doing here in the middle of the desert?{\r}

58
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,400
就是為了這些錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's all this money.{\r}

59
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,320
這是所有炫目的燈光…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is the end result of all the bright lights...{\r}

60
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,480
所有的招待、香檳、免費住宿…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and the comped trips, of all the champagne...{\r}

61
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:14,660
女人與喝不完的酒 最終所造成的結果
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze.{\r}

62
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,910
全都是為了 讓我們弄走你的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.{\r}

63
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,290
這就是賭城的真面目
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's the truth about Las Vegas.{\r}

64
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,800
我們是唯一的贏家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We're the only winners.{\r}

65
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,960
賭徒們一點機會都沒有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The players don't stand a chance.{\r}

66
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,630
而他們的錢從賭桌上…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And their cash flows from the tables...{\r}

67
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,340
流入我們的收銀柜再進入保險籠…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to our boxes through the cage...{\r}

68
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,340
最后流入全賭場最神圣的房間
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and into the most sacred room in the casino.{\r}

69
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,470
他們計算錢的地方…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The place where they add up all the money...{\r}

70
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,140
注意-請勿進入 萬物之首，計算室
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the Holy of holies, the count room.{\r}

71
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,730
這兒可不是閑雜人等可進出的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now, this place was off-limits.{\r}

72
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,780
連我都進不去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Even I couldn't get inside.{\r}

73
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,780
當然，但我的工作是讓它保持 滿滿的狀態
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure.{\r}

74
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,950
里頭的錢多到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: They had so much money in there...{\r}

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,650
可讓你用百元大鈔砌棟房子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills.{\r}

76
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,460
最棒的是…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And the best part was that upstairs...{\r}

77
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,540
上頭董事會什么屁都不知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the Board of Directors didn't know what the fuck was going on.{\r}

78
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,920
在他們看來一切都干凈俐落 沒人動手腳
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To them everything looked on the up-and-up.{\r}

79
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,540
不是嗎？當然不
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Right? Wrong.{\r}

80
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
確認五千元
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Verify $5,000.{\r}

81
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,680
在計算室的那些人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: The guys in the counting room...{\r}

82
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,350
都是被派進去將里頭吸干的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.{\r}

83
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,430
他們會少算錢，將計單弄掉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.{\r}

84
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,020
甚至直接從箱里拿走現款
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They'd even take cash right out of the drop-boxes.{\r}

85
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,980
全是靠這家伙…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And it was up to this guy right here...{\r}

86
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,270
站在兩百萬元前的這位…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}standing in front of $2 million...{\r}

87
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,610
在被國稅局或任何人發現前…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to skim the cash off the top without anybody getting wise...{\r}

88
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,490
把錢摸走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the IRS or anybody.{\r}

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,160
在計算室里 好像都沒人在看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.{\r}

90
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,530
不知怎的，大家都視若無睹
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Somehow, somebody's always looking the other way.{\r}

91
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,830
看看這些家伙 他們看來真忙，不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look at these guys. They look busy, right?{\r}

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,380
他們在算錢，誰會吵他們呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're counting money. Who wants to bother them?{\r}

93
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,800
我的意思是，天曉得他們會不會 犯了錯而忘記偷錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal.{\r}

94
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,670
這期間，你可來去自如
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.{\r}

95
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,590
走過那些鳥事不干的警衛 每禮拜還多拿一百元…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra $100 a week...{\r}

96
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,100
只為了看門
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}just to watch the door.{\r}

97
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,020
一如往常一樣規律…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's routine. Business as usual...{\r}

98
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,850
走進、走出、你好、再見
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}in, out, hello, goodbye.{\r}

99
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,360
就這么簡單
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's all there is to it.{\r}

100
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,030
就只是個拎著皮箱 走出賭場的肥豬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Just another fat fuck walking out of a casino with a suitcase.{\r}

101
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,780
但那口箱子 會直接送往一個地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place:{\r}

102
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,620
堪薩斯市，那里是…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}right to Kansas City, which was as close...{\r}

103
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,990
中部的老大能離拉斯維加斯 最近的地方…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go...{\r}

104
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,000
而不用怕被逮捕
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}without getting themselves arrested.{\r}

105
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,250
堪薩斯市 老大們要的只是那口箱子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted.{\r}

106
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,880
每個月都要
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And they wanted it every month.{\r}

107
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,760
圣馬利諾意大利超市

108
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,390
這個摩門教的混蛋…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now this old Mormon fuck here...{\r}

109
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,860
他每個月都得拿著箱子飛來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy.{\r}

110
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,770
-什么東西這么香？ -他們做了好料的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Something smells good. -They made us something to eat.{\r}

111
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,780
老大們會從各地飛來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: The bosses would come from all over:{\r}

112
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,400
底特律、克里夫蘭、密爾瓦基…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee...{\r}

113
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,910
整個中西部…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}all over the Midwest...{\r}

114
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,410
他們都會在這個位于 堪薩斯市的市場碰面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and they would meet in this produce market in Kansas City.{\r}

115
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,000
根本沒人會知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody even knew it.{\r}

116
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,830
有一個讓他媽做菜
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}One of the guys made his mother do the cooking.{\r}

117
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,000
你有看到杰瑞史塔瑞歐嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?{\r}

118
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,750
這些老頭們看來可能不怎么樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: These old greaseballs might not look it...{\r}

119
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,080
但相信我…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but believe me...{\r}

120
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,140
他們才是賭城的秘密操縱者
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas.{\r}

121
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,810
媽媽，那男人又來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}WOMAN: Mama, that man's here again.{\r}

122
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,300
因為他們控制著 全美卡車司機工會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Because they controlled the Teamsters Union.{\r}

123
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,770
而要開賭場非得到那兒去借錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And that's where you had to go to borrow money to buy a casino.{\r}

124
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,770
-你要放蝦嗎？ -我會的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}WOMAN 2: Would you put in shrimp? WOMAN: I would.{\r}

125
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,100
要是這些家伙們每月拿不到 這只小箱子…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Nobody got a Teamsters' loan unless the guys in this room...{\r}

126
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,520
那誰就都別想貸到款
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}knew they were gonna get their little suitcases.{\r}

127
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,320
像這從底特律來的老家伙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Guys like this antique over here, out of Detroit.{\r}

128
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,870
或尤其是像利蒙蓋吉 這群人的首腦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top boss.{\r}

129
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250
有大概數字嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You got a round figure on it?{\r}

130
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,500
絕對是這房里最重要的人物
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Definitely the most important guy in this room.{\r}

131
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,340
-十公斤，那就差不多七十萬了 -很好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: About 20 pounds. Around $700,000. REMO: Good.{\r}

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,380
雖說對拉斯維加斯還有點早…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}STONE: It's a little early for Las Vegas...{\r}

133
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:37,220
但我想邀請賭博游樂業界的 先生與小姐們…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but I want to welcome the ladies and gentlemen of the gaming industry....{\r}

134
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,390
就以世界所知…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: As far as the world was concerned...{\r}

135
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,560
安迪史東卡車司機工會 退休基金會的負責人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Andy Stone, head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...{\r}

136
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,360
是個清白的人物
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}was a legitimate guy.{\r}

137
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,390
有權力的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A powerful man.{\r}

138
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,030
他與總統一同打高爾夫
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He played golf with the President.{\r}

139
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,410
代表卡車司機工會退休基金會…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund...{\r}

140
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,240
-我很高興將這… -但安迪也聽命于人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm glad to present... SAM: But he also took orders.{\r}

141
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,620
當他被指示將基金貸款 貸給菲立浦葛林…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When he was told to give a pension-fund loan to Philip Green...{\r}

142
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,790
六千兩百七十萬的支票…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...this check for $62,700,000...{\r}

143
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,300
給全新的坦吉樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}for the new Tangiers.{\r}

144
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,420
他就會乖乖聽話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...he did what he was told.{\r}

145
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,550
他可是最完美的傀儡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Here was the perfect front man.{\r}

146
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,260
他還能干嘛呢？ 他什么都不知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck else could he be? He didn't know too much.{\r}

147
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,840
也什么都不想知道…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't want to know too much...{\r}

148
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,760
尤其是老大們讓工會借錢給他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him money.{\r}

149
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,970
他想相信他們是因為 他的才智貸款給他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He wanted to believe they gave him the money because he was smart.{\r}

150
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,600
我了解這城市的競爭性有多大 才會說出此話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I say that knowing just how much competition we have in this city.{\r}

151
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,070
他們從哪兒找來葛林的？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: And where they got Green from?{\r}

152
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,740
誰知道啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who the fuck knows?{\r}

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,780
我只知道他在亞利桑那州 是個房地產經紀…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All I know is that he was an Arizona real-estate hustler...{\r}

154
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,410
卻連開來拿支票的油錢 都差點付不出來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who barely had enough gas money to come and pick up his fucking check.{\r}

155
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,090
美國中部 卡車司機工會退休基金 是由老大的人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And it was the bosses' man...{\r}

156
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,960
安迪史東下所有的命令
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.{\r}

157
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,460
并不是由董事會主席 菲立浦葛林
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Not the Chairman of the Board, Philip Green.{\r}

158
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,470
我了解
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I understand.{\r}

159
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,970
現在只缺…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Now all they needed was...{\r}

160
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,180
一個可信任的人來管理賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}someone they could trust to run the casino.{\r}

161
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,850
有誰比艾斯更適合？ 他已經在賭城混了幾年…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And who better than Ace? He was already in Vegas a couple years...{\r}

162
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,860
他對這兒瞭若指掌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and he had the fucking place clocked.{\r}

163
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,280
艾斯的一貫作風 你給他個管理賭場的機會…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But typical Ace, give him a shot to run a casino...{\r}

164
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,860
他還推三阻四
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and he tries to talk you out of it.{\r}

165
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,650
我不知道自己行不行
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know if I could do this.{\r}

166
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,030
賭博游樂委員會絕不會 發執照給我的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.{\r}

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,920
我最起碼有兩打以上 賭博與賽馬被逮的前科
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I have at least 24 gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.{\r}

168
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,290
在賭場工作不需要執照
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.{\r}

169
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,590
你只需要去申請
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All you gotta do is apply for one.{\r}

170
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,170
州法律允許你在申請期間…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The State law says that you can work in a casino...{\r}

171
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,840
在賭場做事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}while they process your application.{\r}

172
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,890
他們文件進度現在落后十年
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: They got a 10-year backlog.{\r}

173
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,640
若他們發現了怎么辦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What happens when they do find out?{\r}

174
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,390
他們為什么會想發現？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: Why would they want to find out?{\r}

175
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,500
我們在這兒投資了一億
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We're putting $100 million here.{\r}

176
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,100
他們何必趕我們走？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why would they lock us out?{\r}

177
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,940
他們不會發現的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: They'll never find out.{\r}

178
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,270
你只需要一直改變職位頭銜
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All you gotta do is keep changing your job title.{\r}

179
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,900
像從賭場執行長改到 餐飲主席
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.{\r}

180
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,570
然后他們又會將你的申請表 擺到最下面去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then they put your application at the bottom of the pile.{\r}

181
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,250
我有大把的員工 已經工作三十年了還沒執照
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know guys who've worked there for 30 years don't have a license.{\r}

182
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,290
這不是容易的決定，安迪
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a tough proposition, Andy.{\r}

183
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,630
若我去做，得讓我用我的方式
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If I did it, I'd have to run it my way.{\r}

184
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,710
沒問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: You got it.{\r}

185
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,720
我說真的，不能有干涉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm serious. No interference.{\r}

186
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,420
沒有人會干涉你管理賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody's gonna interfere with your running the casino.{\r}

187
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,140
我保證
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I guarantee it.{\r}

188
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,260
艾斯就是這樣接手的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: And that's how they got Ace to take over.{\r}

189
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,980
要艾斯是因為 他不管是吃喝拉撒睡時都在賭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They wanted him because Ace ate, slept and breathed gambling.{\r}

190
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,490
他們還給了他個很可愛的頭銜…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They worked out a real cute job title, too...{\r}

191
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,990
坦吉樂公關理事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tangiers Public Relations Director.{\r}

192
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,830
但他只管賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.{\r}

193
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,040
他從十五歲時第一次下注就沒輸過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He made his first bet when he was 15, and he always made money.{\r}

194
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,370
他不像你我那樣賭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't bet like you or me.{\r}

195
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,630
就為了他媽的好玩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Having some fun with it, shit like that.{\r}

196
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,430
你在哪兒學當莊家的？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where did you learn how to deal?{\r}

197
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,250
他下注時就像是腦部外科醫生一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: He bet like a fucking brain surgeon.{\r}

198
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,310
籌碼得擺對
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Place the checks properly.{\r}

199
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,180
-像這樣 -是的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-That's the way you do it. -Yes, sir.{\r}

200
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,050
他得洞悉一切
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: He had to know everything.{\r}

201
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,720
他知道沒人曉得的內幕…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He'd find out the inside stuff nobody else knew...{\r}

202
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,810
他會根據此下注
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and that's what he'd put his money on.{\r}

203
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,650
在老家時 就連在老家時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BACK HOME YEARS AGO Even back home, years ago...{\r}

204
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,860
當我們剛認識的時候… 他都知道四分衛有沒有吸可卡因
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}when we first hung out, he'd know if the quarterback was on coke...{\r}

205
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,570
我賭哥倫比亞兩萬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll take Columbia for $20,000.{\r}

206
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,540
或他的女友是否懷孕
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...if his girlfriend was knocked up.{\r}

207
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,450
他會去測風速 只為了預測射門得分
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He'd get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals.{\r}

208
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,250
他算出了籃球場上…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He even figured out the bounce you got off different kinds of wood...{\r}

209
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,460
不同木材質地板的彈性
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}on college basketball courts.{\r}

210
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,550
他從早到晚都在做這些
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He'd be working on this day and night.{\r}

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,920
他對他要下注的賭局 瞭若指掌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He knew everything about a game he would bet on.{\r}

212
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,930
艾斯下了六千 我也跟下六千
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ace got down at $6,000. Get me down at $6,000.{\r}

213
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,590
一季又一季…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Season after season...{\r}

214
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,190
那小子是我唯一認識的絕對贏家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the prick was the only guaranteed winner I ever knew.{\r}

215
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,900
但他那么認真下注…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But he was so serious about it all...{\r}

216
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,900
在我看來他從不放輕松享受享受
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that I don't think he ever enjoyed himself.{\r}

217
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,650
但那就是他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But that's just the way he was.{\r}

218
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,580
當時，老大們也不會在乎他享不享受
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Back then, the bosses didn't give a fuck whether he enjoyed himself or not.{\r}

219
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,160
對他們而言，他像是棵搖錢樹
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To them, he was a cash register.{\r}

220
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,290
他們只要搖一搖就可拿錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.{\r}

221
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,700
尤其利蒙…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Especially Remo...{\r}

222
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,870
他是個逢賭必輸的衰客
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who was a fucking degenerate gambler who always lost.{\r}

223
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,380
靠，這么多滿貫
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All those fucking sweeps.{\r}

224
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,930
-除非艾斯下注 -真是夠了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Unless Ace made his bets. Enough now!{\r}

225
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,300
艾斯一個周末為他們賺的錢…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Ace made more money for them on a weekend...{\r}

226
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,640
比我搶劫一個月的還多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}than I could do heisting joints for a month.{\r}

227
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:55,360
艾斯將他聽到的小道消息 都告訴了利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Whatever Ace picked up on the street, he told Remo.{\r}

228
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,820
內定的拳賽，下了藥的馬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fixed fights, doped horses...{\r}

229
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,150
買通的裁判，預定的分數
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}crooked fucking zebras, locked-in point spreads.{\r}

230
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,160
他什么屁都告訴了利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He told fucking Remo everything.{\r}

231
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,530
說真的，我也不能怪他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And, to tell you the truth, I don't blame him.{\r}

232
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,830
用錢財讓利蒙快樂…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Keeping Remo happy with money...{\r}

233
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,250
是世上最好的保險
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}was the greatest insurance policy in the world.{\r}

234
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,630
王八蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Son of a bitch!{\r}

235
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,880
你怎么知道是 奧克拉荷馬或密西根
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?{\r}

236
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,800
根本沒人猜到奧克拉荷馬 你是怎么辦到的？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody ever had Oklahoma.... How'd you do it?{\r}

237
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,470
所以他們才賠得高啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's why they paid so well.{\r}

238
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,880
你看吧？ 什么都不跟我說
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: You see? Never tells me nothing.{\r}

239
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,060
下禮拜的怎么樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What do we got on for next week?{\r}

240
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,730
現在還太早了 我得要星期四才知道，可以嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a little too early. I'll know by Thursday. Is that all right?{\r}

241
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,070
-你會來家里嗎？ -我會繞過來的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: You'll come by the house? SAM: I'll come by.{\r}

242
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,390
七點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}At 7:00.{\r}

243
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,400
做得好，小子 繼續啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: Good job, my boy. Keep it up.{\r}

244
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,610
嘿，尼克
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: Hey, Nick.{\r}

245
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,780
我馬上去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll be right out.{\r}

246
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,370
看到那家伙了嗎？好好看著他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}See that guy? Keep a good eye on him.{\r}

247
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,580
他為我們賺了很多錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's making a lot of money for us.{\r}

248
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,920
他會繼續為我們賺錢 所以你得好好看著他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And he'll continue making money for us, so keep a good eye on him.{\r}

249
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,920
不像你外面那群沒腦的政府關員
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Not like the fucking Feds out there, without brains.{\r}

250
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,390
-好嗎？ -沒問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: Okay? NICKY: All right.{\r}

251
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,300
要我帶走嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Want me to take this?{\r}

252
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,470
所以這么多事之外…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Now, on top of everything else...{\r}

253
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,100
我還得擔保 沒人會動我們的大紅人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta make sure nobody fucks with the Golden Jew.{\r}

254
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,390
幫小姐們倒幾杯酒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Couple of shooters for the ladies.{\r}

255
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,310
我們真是好搭擋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Yeah, we made a great pair.{\r}

256
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:12,360
我下注而尼奇負責收錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.{\r}

257
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,440
老頭子們愛死我們了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The old men loved us, and why not?{\r}

258
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,450
他們全靠我們賺錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They all made money with us.{\r}

259
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,580
尼奇怎么收錢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How did Nicky collect?{\r}

260
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,950
別問
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't ask.{\r}

261
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,580
錢他媽的在哪兒？ 我沒見到
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then where the fuck is the money? I don't see it.{\r}

262
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,330
-你們好，瑪莉莎，海蒂 -你好，山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Hi, Melissa, Heidi. -Hi, Sam.{\r}

263
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,170
那是誰？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who's this guy?{\r}

264
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,090
-去你的，我下九 -是八
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Get the fuck out. I laid nine. NICKY: It was eight.{\r}

265
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,000
艾斯告訴他芝加哥小熊隊的注
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Ace, tell him the line on the Bears game.{\r}

266
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,060
-八 -他要不知道，就沒人知道了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Eight. -If he don't know, nobody knows.{\r}

267
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,520
-是八 -那我怎么算成九？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: It was eight. MAN: How come I laid nine?{\r}

268
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,270
因為你是個蠢才
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}'Cause you're a jag-off.{\r}

269
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,230
-對不起？ -什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Excuse me. -What?{\r}

270
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,980
-這是你的筆嗎？ -是我的，怎樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Isthis your pen? -Yeah, that's my pen. Why?{\r}

271
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,360
很好看，我不知道是誰的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's nice. I didn't know whose it was.{\r}

272
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,120
我不想它弄丟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't want it to get lost.{\r}

273
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,620
謝謝 你為什么不拿那只筆…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you. Why don't you take that fucking pen...{\r}

274
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,070
捅到你屁眼里去，你這蠢才
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and shove it up your ass, you fucking jag-off?{\r}

275
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,210
-我只是… -王八蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Well, I was just offering-- -Asshole.{\r}

276
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,880
小心，喬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Look out, Joe.{\r}

277
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,200
那是什么？ 你有沒有聽到女孩哭？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What's that? You hear a little girl?{\r}

278
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,110
是個小女孩嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Is that a little fucking girl?{\r}

279
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,740
剛叫我朋友捅什么的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What happened to the tough guy...{\r}

280
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,200
那個硬漢呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who told my friend to stick it up his fucking ass?{\r}

281
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,290
尼奇，夠了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky, take it easy.{\r}

282
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,630
我還在想那人 為什么這么說時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: While I tried to figure out why the guy said what he said...{\r}

283
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,140
尼奇就動手了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky just hit him.{\r}

284
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,590
不管一個人多大個子 尼奇都會跟他拼命
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No matter how big a guy might be, Nicky would take him on.{\r}

285
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,970
你拿拳頭打他 他就會拿球棒回你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You beat Nicky with fists, he comes back with a bat.{\r}

286
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,530
你拿刀捅他 他就會用槍射你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You beat him with a knife, he comes back with a gun.{\r}

287
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,440
你若拿槍射他 那你最好是殺了他…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you beat him with a gun, you'd better kill him...{\r}

288
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,280
因為他會一直不停的回來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}because he'll keep coming back and back...{\r}

289
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,990
直到你掛了為止
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}until one of you is dead.{\r}

290
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,630
由我保護艾斯…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: With me protecting Ace...{\r}

291
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,550
他為老大們狠狠賺了一票
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he made a fortune for the bosses.{\r}

292
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,340
這就是他來賭城的原因
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's what got him to Vegas.{\r}

293
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,180
他根本就是印鈔機
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He was a money machine.{\r}

294
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,520
為這些家伙賺大錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A tremendous earner for these guys.{\r}

295
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,690
他一來就把供金增加了一倍
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}As soon as he took over, he doubled the fucking drop.{\r}

296
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,400
艾斯來后，賭場從就沒見過 那么多的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}With Ace, the casino never saw so much money.{\r}

297
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,570
老大們當然是笑不攏嘴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And the bosses, they couldn't be happier.{\r}

298
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,960
在賭城，我還得跟附近有關系的 一些牛仔找事做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.{\r}

299
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,470
他們與老家伙們很熟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They were close to the good old boys.{\r}

300
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,360
要不是我們 那些家伙現在都還在鏟驢糞
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Without us, these guys would still be shoveling mule shit.{\r}

301
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,320
場子得保持干凈
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've got to keep a cleaner station.{\r}

302
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,570
需要清潔工就呼叫他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you need Mr. Clean, page him.{\r}

303
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,440
下次不會了，山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Won't happen again, Sam.{\r}

304
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,450
-羅斯坦先生 -下次不會了，羅斯坦先生
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Mr. Rothstein. MAN: It won't happen again, Mr. Rothstein.{\r}

305
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,530
這家伙又是一個蠢白人嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Is this guy just another dumb fucking white man, or what?{\r}

306
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,750
-你需要他 -弄不走是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You need this guy. -Can't get rid of him?{\r}

307
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,550
他有關系的 他是縣輔導的表兄弟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.{\r}

308
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,540
我連清潔工都不會給他做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.{\r}

309
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,210
別無選擇，我必須照顧他們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had no choice. I had to take care of them.{\r}

310
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,090
這些鄉巴佬當權
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}These yokels ran the state.{\r}

311
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,330
多謝，議員
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}DEALER: Thanks, Senator.{\r}

312
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,010
-他們立法，又掌管法院 -我要開房間
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: They passed the laws, owned the courts. I need a room.{\r}

313
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,590
我每周都有十多個政客來訪
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I had dozens of politicians and state officials coming through weekly.{\r}

314
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,610
-他要什么都給他 -當然
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Get him what he wants. BILLY: Certainly.{\r}

315
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,110
何不讓他們快樂？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Why not make them happy?{\r}

316
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,160
對于政客 例如我們這位州議員…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}For politicians, like our State Senator up there...{\r}

317
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,880
一切都是免費的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}everything was on the house.{\r}

318
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,960
他們的招待生涯 在當選時就贏得了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}These guys won their comped life when they got elected.{\r}

319
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,630
何不加以利用？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why not take advantage of it?{\r}

320
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,430
政客還是小事，我們解決的了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Still, the politicians came cheap. We could handle them.{\r}

321
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,470
是像市川那種…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a whale, like K.K. Ichikawa...{\r}

322
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,840
百家樂一把下三萬的豪賭客
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who plays $30, 000 a hand in baccarat.{\r}

323
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,850
這種才該看緊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's the one you really gotta watch.{\r}

324
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,430
他下注動作快，玩得大 他的資金雄厚…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He plays fast and big. He has the cash and the credit...{\r}

325
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,950
足可把你玩垮
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to turn out your lights.{\r}

326
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,610
一年前他讓開曼群島上 好幾家賭場洗底
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A year ago he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.{\r}

327
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,370
他從賭場贏了我們兩百萬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Downstairs he takes us for $2 million...{\r}

328
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,290
又從酒店套房拿了免費的 肥皂、洗發精與毛巾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and upstairs he takes free soap, shampoo and towels.{\r}

329
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,910
又是一個 喜愛免費套房…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Another billionaire cheapskate who loved his free rooms...{\r}

330
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,170
免費私人飛機又賺得我們兩百萬 的億萬富翁小氣鬼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}free private jets and $2 million of our money.{\r}

331
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,010
我們也不好惹
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But we got him back.{\r}

332
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,680
我讓機師告訴他飛機故障
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had our pilot tell him the plane was on the fritz.{\r}

333
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,130
-發生什么事？ -非常抱歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ICHlKAWA: What went wrong? BILLY: I'm awfully sorry.{\r}

334
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,850
是機械故障
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}These mechanical things happen.{\r}

335
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,270
在這兒總比在上面好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Better here than up there.{\r}

336
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,190
然后他趕不上回日本的飛機
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Then he missed the flights connecting with Japan.{\r}

337
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,690
竟然沒有空房
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't believe there's no room.{\r}

338
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,950
我們給了他一整樓的房間
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.{\r}

339
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,560
-真抱歉讓你趕不上飛機
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Sorry you missed your plane.{\r}

340
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,040
-你想要贏回我的錢啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You'd like some of my money back.{\r}

341
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,960
不，不賭了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, no. No gambling.{\r}

342
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,550
他回來后開始下小注
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: And once he was back, he played small.{\r}

343
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,880
一把只賭一千 而不是平常的三萬一把
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He bet $1,000 a hand, instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.{\r}

344
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,430
但我知道這些豪賭客的習性…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But I knew the trick with whales like Ichikawa...{\r}

345
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,020
他們不可能一直下小注的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}was that they can't bet small for long.{\r}

346
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,480
他不覺得是贏一萬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't think of it as winning $10, 000...{\r}

347
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,030
他會想成是輸九萬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he thought of it as losing $90, 000.{\r}

348
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,740
所以他開始加碼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So, he upped his bets.{\r}

349
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,920
直到他將贏得的輸光 再加上自己一百萬的現金
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Until he dropped his winnings back and gave up $1 million of his own cash.{\r}

350
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,750
在賭場里，第一原則就是 讓他們一直賭…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In a casino, the cardinal rule is to keep them playing...{\r}

351
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,260
也讓他們一直回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and keep them coming back.{\r}

352
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,930
賭得越多就輸得越多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The longer they play, the more they lose.{\r}

353
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,100
最終錢就都是我們的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In the end, we get it all.{\r}

354
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,770
在賭城，每個人都得注意著別人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch everybody else.{\r}

355
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,490
玩家是來贏賭場錢的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Since the players are looking to beat the casino...{\r}

356
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,290
莊家得看好玩家…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the dealers are watching the players...{\r}

357
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,500
收付賭注得看好莊家…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the boxmen are watching the dealers...{\r}

358
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,510
管場的注意著收付賭注的人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the floormen are watching the boxmen...{\r}

359
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,670
賭區經理看著管場的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the pit bosses are watching the floormen...{\r}

360
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,770
值班經理看著賭區經理…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the shift bosses are watching the pit bosses...{\r}

361
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,640
賭場經理看著值班經理…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the casino manager is watching the shift bosses...{\r}

362
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,930
我則看著賭場經理…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm watching the casino manager...{\r}

363
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,310
而監視照相機看著我們大家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and the eye in the sky is watching us all.{\r}

364
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,740
另外，還有十多個家伙…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Plus, we had a dozen guys...{\r}

365
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,040
大多以前都是老千 他們知道所有的騙術
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house.{\r}

366
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,100
好啊！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yes!{\r}

367
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,530
-非常好 -我就跟你說我今天很旺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Very nice. -I told you I was hot tonight.{\r}

368
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,620
好樣的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Looking good.{\r}

369
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:35,080
來吧，為了金吉兒，快
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Let's go. This is for Ginger.{\r}

370
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,200
一百賭你沒老A
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Let me have $100 on your hard 10.{\r}

371
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,340
謝謝
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you.{\r}

372
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:41,580
來吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Here we go now.{\r}

373
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,900
-對不起 -骰子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Oh, I'm sorry. -The dice.{\r}

374
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,700
多謝
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you very much.{\r}

375
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,030
多謝你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I appreciate that.{\r}

376
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,280
保重，史蒂夫 要冒險啊，開快車
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Take care, Steve. Take chances, drive fast.{\r}

377
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,910
這一百給你，甜心 多謝你賞光
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This $100 is for you, love. Thanks for your time.{\r}

378
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:12,370
-快點 -怎么了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Come on. -What's the matter?{\r}

379
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,090
我幫你賺了不少，我要我的份
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I made a lot of money for you, I want my cut.{\r}

380
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,010
什么錢？我看到你偷錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What money? I've seen you stealing.{\r}

381
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,510
“什么錢？” 你看看這堆籌碼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"What money?" Look at the stack of chips.{\r}

382
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,850
-我要我的一半 -我觀察你一夜了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I want my half. GAMBLER: I've watched you.{\r}

383
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,310
-我要我的錢 -你皮包里全是熟籌碼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I want my money. -Your bag is full of chips.{\r}

384
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,890
-我才沒偷你的東西 -滾吧！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I didn't steal anything from you. GAMBLER: Get lost!{\r}

385
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,270
-滾吧？ -沒錯！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Get lost? GAMBLER: Yes!{\r}

386
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,060
-這怎么樣呢？ -別這樣！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Well, how about that? -Come on!{\r}

387
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,330
真酷，讓我一見鐘情
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What a move. I fell in love right there.{\r}

388
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,000
但在賭城，像金吉兒這樣的女孩 得花上大錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.{\r}

389
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,520
我去補個妝
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna go powder my nose.{\r}

390
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,910
-金吉兒的人生目標是錢 -馬上回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Ginger's mission in life was money. I'll be right back.{\r}

391
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,080
-待會見，金吉兒 -多謝你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}DOORMAN: See you. GINGER: Thanks for asking.{\r}

392
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,870
她在賭場可是皇后
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: She was a queen around the casino.{\r}

393
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,420
她召來大賭客 并也幫他們花大錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She brought in high rollers and helped them spend a lot of money.{\r}

394
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,000
-你好 -嘿，金吉兒，你好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Hello. -Hey, Ginger. How you doing?{\r}

395
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,800
好得很，一點小意思 你幫我搞定了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Great. You might have something for me. Got me covered?{\r}

396
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:09,140
-非常感謝 -自己保重喔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Thank you. VALET: Take care of yourself.{\r}

397
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,300
我有些幸運丸給你，安迪
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I got some lucky pills for you, Andy.{\r}

398
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,640
誰不想要金吉兒？ 她是城里名聲最響亮…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Who didn't want her? She was one of the best known...{\r}

399
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,860
也是道上最受歡迎的江湖人物
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}best liked and most respected hustlers in town.{\r}

400
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,150
像她這么聰明的玩家 可以讓男人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake...{\r}

401
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,700
兩三天不睡 然后再讓他一文不名的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}for two or three days before sending him home broke...{\r}

402
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,910
回到老婆與銀行審查主任身邊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to the little woman and his bank examiners.{\r}

403
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,600
有找錢嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Any change?{\r}

404
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,270
我回來時小賭了幾把
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, I hit a few games on the way back.{\r}

405
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,690
那根本是胡扯 她把錢收起來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: But that was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.{\r}

406
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,450
-你今天好嗎？ -不錯啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: How you doing tonight? CASHlER: Good.{\r}

407
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,120
-你呢？ -衰死了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}CASHlER: How are you? GINGER: Beat.{\r}

408
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,110
-金吉兒洞悉玩家們的習性 -給你一百
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Ginger had the hustlers' code. GINGER: Take one for you.{\r}

409
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,830
-多謝 -她懂得如何買通他人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}CASHlER: Thank you. SAM: She knew how to take care of people.{\r}

410
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,030
這就是賭城的座右銘
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's what Vegas is all about.{\r}

411
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,620
-六千八百元 -謝啦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}CASHlER: $6,800. GINGER: Thanks.{\r}

412
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,290
-這里是講究回扣的城市 -晚安
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It's kickback city. GINGER: Have a good night.{\r}

413
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,090
她罩莊家…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: She took care of the dealers...{\r}

414
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,510
賭區經理，管場經理…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}pit bosses, floor managers...{\r}

415
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,350
但尤其關照停車小弟…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but, mostly, the valet parkers...{\r}

416
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,730
他們能幫你找到任何東西 也能幫你解決任何事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.{\r}

417
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,570
金吉兒搞定了停車的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ginger took care of the parkers...{\r}

418
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,150
他們搞定警衛 而警衛會擺平警察…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who took care of the security guards, who took care of the cops...{\r}

419
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,660
-讓她可繼續開工 -我今晚需要那東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who let her operate. I need that stuff tonight.{\r}

420
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
-沒問題 -你真好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}VALET: No problem. GINGER: You are a doll.{\r}

421
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,870
停車賺的錢多到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The valet parking job was such a money-maker...{\r}

422
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,160
得買通酒店經理才能排上空缺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.{\r}

423
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,380
不過有一點我不懂…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But one thing I didn't understand...{\r}

424
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,970
她將一切都控制的好好的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}was that she had everything under control...{\r}

425
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,840
卻被她那拉皮條的男友 萊絲特戴蒙德吃得死死的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}except for her old pimp boyfriend, Lester Diamond.{\r}

426
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,220
我得顧到其他人，我的搭擋們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I got other people in this. I got partners.{\r}

427
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,220
在這事上有我罩你，知道嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm looking out for you in this thing, okay?{\r}

428
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,180
你將獲你應得的 而且第一個拿到，好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You'll get yours back, and you'll get it back first. Okay?{\r}

429
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,530
-好的 -你去哪兒了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-All right. -Where you going?{\r}

430
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,570
你在哪兒？ 你又飄走了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where are you? You're in that place.{\r}

431
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,570
-我在這兒 -不，你不在
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'm here. -No, you're not.{\r}

432
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,740
你在哪？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where are you?{\r}

433
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,380
我永遠在你身邊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm always here for you.{\r}

434
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,960
-真的 -是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You are. -I am.{\r}

435
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,550
我所認識的金吉兒 根本不會多看這怪胎一眼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look at this creep.{\r}

436
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,670
-祝你好運 -是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Good luck. -Yeah.{\r}

437
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,720
他是個老千，專作假牌…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He was a moocher, a card cheat...{\r}

438
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,520
老在高爾夫俱樂部招搖撞騙 一個癟三…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}a country club golf hustler, a scumbag...{\r}

439
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,520
-為了幾塊錢追著牙醫屁股跑 -小心點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-chasing dentists for a few bucks. -Careful.{\r}

440
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:42,020
他永遠都沒錢，永遠都有藉口
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He was always broke. He always had a story.{\r}

441
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,190
不知為何，她卻拒絕不了他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Somehow, she could never turn him down.{\r}

442
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,820
在金吉兒眼里，他只是運氣不好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The way Ginger saw it was that he was just an unlucky guy.{\r}

443
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,860
總得有人照顧他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Somebody had to take care of him.{\r}

444
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,530
在老家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BACK HOME{\r}

445
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,410
但尼奇可不需要人照顧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But nobody had to take care of Nicky.{\r}

446
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,210
你找到現金的話 我們就跟你平分
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You find any cash in there, we'll whack it up with you.{\r}

447
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,500
他把自己照顧得太好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He took care of himself only too well.{\r}

448
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,380
這也是為什么老家的條子 都想抓他到案
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.{\r}

449
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:05,130
我將這些都折得好好的 能不能放尊重點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I folded these things beautifully. I would appreciate a little respect.{\r}

450
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,590
別看我，兄弟 我還得跟她同床共枕
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't look at me, pal, I gotta live with her.{\r}

451
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,430
就連去渡個假 他們在機場時都不放過他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Even after a vacation, they hassled him at the airport.{\r}

452
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,270
法蘭克瑪雷諾在那兒等他 條子們也在
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Frank Marino was there to meet him. So were the cops.{\r}

453
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,110
他們想逮他…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They wanted to pinch him...{\r}

454
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,730
-因為一宗在安特衛普的鉆石竊案 -幫忙折吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-for a diamond burglary in Antwerp. -Help me fold these.{\r}

455
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,850
他們隨時愿意嫁禍于他 不管是在哪兒發生什么事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where.{\r}

456
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,700
他們通常是對的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They were usually right.{\r}

457
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,570
因為尼奇很喜歡混幫派
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.{\r}

458
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,030
他也不在乎有誰知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And he didn't give a damn who knew it.{\r}

459
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,580
看看，美極了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: There we go. Look at that. Beautiful!{\r}

460
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,130
讓我擔心的是…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I mean that's what worried me...{\r}

461
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,290
尼奇似乎要被派來拉斯維加斯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}'cause it turns out, Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.{\r}

462
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,460
-好了，就這樣 -還有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}JENNlFER: All right, we're clear. NICKY: There's more.{\r}

463
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,140
一定還有些卡在里面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: There's a couple stuck in there.{\r}

464
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,090
-我告訴你都拿出來了 -快
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'm telling you, they're out! -Come on.{\r}

465
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,340
別急于辯護 可能還有些卡在你頭發里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't get so defensive, it could be stuck in your hair.{\r}

466
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,730
那是什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What's that?{\r}

467
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:54,600
沒有了，謝謝
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's no more. Thanks.{\r}

468
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,610
我迫不及待想去拉斯維加斯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I couldn't wait to get my hands on Vegas.{\r}

469
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,490
但老大可不是送我去玩的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But the bosses didn't send me out to have a good time.{\r}

470
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,620
他們要我去確保 沒人找艾斯的麻煩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They sent me out to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace.{\r}

471
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,240
也確保沒人干擾每月的抽頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And nobody interfered with the fucking skim.{\r}

472
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:10,040
-嘿 -你好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Hey. -Hey, how you doing?{\r}

473
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,500
嘿，山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Sammy.{\r}

474
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,500
-天呀，瞧瞧這地方 -不可思議
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Boy, look at this place. -Incredible.{\r}

475
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,760
歡迎來賭城
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Welcome to Vegas.{\r}

476
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,420
-好樣的，山姆 -不錯吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Okay, Sammy. SAM: Something, huh?{\r}

477
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,010
金吉兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ginger.{\r}

478
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,810
靠，你都在這兒干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Holy shit. What've you been doing out here?{\r}

479
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
甜心，過來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Honey, come here.{\r}

480
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,480
這是珍妮佛與尼克 我的好朋友們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine.{\r}

481
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,370
-你好，珍妮佛 -幸會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Hi, Jennifer. -A pleasure.{\r}

482
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,120
好樣的，山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, Sammy.{\r}

483
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:45,120
晚餐后，我們讓珍妮佛 與金吉兒一塊兒…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger...{\r}

484
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,790
我們倆則出去談話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and we took a ride to talk.{\r}

485
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,500
然后他對我丟了顆炸彈
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And then, he hit me with it.{\r}

486
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,800
你覺得我也搬來如何？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What do you think about me moving out here?{\r}

487
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,140
有問題嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You got a problem with that?{\r}

488
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,500
當然沒有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, of course not.{\r}

489
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,270
你是說你允許羅？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You mean I have your permission?{\r}

490
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,560
當然羅 但我得告訴你…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sure, you do. But I just gotta tell you...{\r}

491
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,600
在這兒可不能開玩笑
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}it's no joke out here.{\r}

492
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,770
你得保持低調
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta keep a low profile.{\r}

493
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,770
不像是在老家 這兒他們不喜歡我們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's not like back home. They don't like guys like us.{\r}

494
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,860
警長是個不折不扣的牛仔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This sheriff's a real cowboy.{\r}

495
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,650
連巡警都不怕在沙漠里埋人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Even coppers aren't afraid to bury people in the desert.{\r}

496
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,620
我不在乎 我只想離開老家一陣子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while.{\r}

497
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,790
我厭倦了那里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm tired of that shit back there.{\r}

498
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,660
看看這地方，簡直是錢砌的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look at this place. It's made of money.{\r}

499
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,210
知道最屌的是什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know what the best part is?{\r}

500
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,290
沒人知道我們在干嘛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.{\r}

501
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,420
沒人看著我們，大家都在老家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's nobody here to see us. Everybody's back home.{\r}

502
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,340
我無緣故被逮了兩次
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I got pinched twice for no reason.{\r}

503
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,050
我真得小心了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I really gotta be careful.{\r}

504
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,800
我管理的地方是有執照的 全是合法的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.{\r}

505
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,470
別擔心，我什么都不會做的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything.{\r}

506
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,060
我尤其不會拖你下水
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.{\r}

507
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,400
艾斯看賭城的觀點…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Ace saw Vegas one way...{\r}

508
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,780
-你跟他說過我要來嗎？ -當然
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Call and tell him I'm coming? JACK: Of course.{\r}

509
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,490
我的看法不同
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...but I saw it another.{\r}

510
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,030
我視它為未開發的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I saw it as untouched.{\r}

511
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,080
多的是可勒索的賭馬組頭 皮條客與毒販…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They had bookies, pimps, and drug dealers I could shake down.{\r}

512
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,130
他們能找誰靠？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who the fuck were they gonna run to?{\r}

513
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,080
我開始一個一個下手
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So I started getting everybody in line.{\r}

514
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,890
最屌的是，我這輩子第一次…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Best of all, for the first time in my life...{\r}

515
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,340
發覺了穩贏的方法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I figured out a way not to lose.{\r}

516
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:09,300
他是有個穩贏之計
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He had a foolproof scheme.{\r}

517
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,470
雖然不高明，但起碼行得通
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.{\r}

518
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,890
他贏時就收錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When he won, he collected.{\r}

519
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,550
輸時就叫賭馬組頭去死
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When he lost, he told the bookies to fuck off.{\r}

520
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:19,230
他們能怎樣？逼迫尼奇？ 尼奇就是逼迫者
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? Nicky was the muscle.{\r}

521
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,740
-你好嗎？ -你好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Hey, how you doing? -How you doing?{\r}

522
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,820
-你有東西給我嗎？ -什么東西？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You got that thing for me? -What thing?{\r}

523
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,690
尼奇，我以為你是來下注的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky, I thought you was laying.{\r}

524
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,990
下注？不，我來收錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was laying? No, I'm taking it.{\r}

525
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,950
-你確定？ -非常
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You sure? -I'm positive.{\r}

526
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,420
-我搞混了 -你搞混了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'm a little confused. -You're a little confused?{\r}

527
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,880
或許在我把你的臉砸過這窗戶后…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe if I stick your fucking face through this window...{\r}

528
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,550
你就會清楚點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you'll get unconfused.{\r}

529
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,420
-把錢他媽的給我 -對不起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Give me the fucking money. -I'm sorry.{\r}

530
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,920
我不是故意的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't mean anything by it.{\r}

531
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,640
所以你連錢都準備好了 你他媽的以為我要下注
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's why you had it ready. You thought I was laying it.{\r}

532
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,350
-我的頭 -放聰明點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-My fucking head. -Smarten up.{\r}

533
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,060
而現在尼可拉斯山多羅 要來跟我們說第一總統的故事了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And now Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first President.{\r}

534
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,990
喬治華盛頓出生在…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}George Washington was born--{\r}

535
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,700
但最起碼還風平浪靜了一陣子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: But still, it was nice and quiet for a while.{\r}

536
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,400
我們帶著尼奇與珍妮佛滿街亮相…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town...{\r}

537
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,410
像是明星似的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}like regular Ozzie and Harriets.{\r}

538
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,170
你棒揮得很好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COACH: You got a beautiful swing.{\r}

539
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,670
艾斯讓我兒子，小尼奇 參加市區青少棒，真的很好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Ace got Little Nicky involved with Little League. It was great.{\r}

540
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:18,260
結果其中的一位教練 是市立警察局情報單位的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Turned out that one of the other coaches was a metro intelligence cop.{\r}

541
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,880
不過無所謂，這純粹是孩子的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But it didn't matter. It was all about the kids.{\r}

542
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,470
他得明白不是每棒都能揮出全壘打
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's gotta realize everything can't be a home run.{\r}

543
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,430
我也是這樣告訴他 不過那小子就是這樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's exactly what I tell him, but that's the kind of kid he is.{\r}

544
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,560
尼奇就是尼奇 他總是引人注目
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: And Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known.{\r}

545
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,150
尤其是在他不工作的賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Especially at the casino where he definitely did not work...{\r}

546
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,700
大家都明白
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}people got the message.{\r}

547
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:40,570
就是我，這也是老大為何派我來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Me, that's why the bosses sent me out here.{\r}

548
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,370
我是來確定 沒有其他人在拿這兒的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was to make sure no other crews robbed the joint.{\r}

549
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,870
像在那邊的那兩個蠢才
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like these two fucking balloon heads over here.{\r}

550
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,840
想從我們這兒騙走二十萬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They were gonna try to bang us out of $200, 000.{\r}

551
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,630
走著瞧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, right, I'm sure.{\r}

552
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,590
你好嗎？你怎么會在這兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How are you? What are you doing here?{\r}

553
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
我到這兒來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm over here now.{\r}

554
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,880
-到這兒來？ -是啊，跟他們一起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You're over here? -Yeah, I'm over here with them.{\r}

555
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,730
我們在等卡爾曼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We're waiting on Carmine.{\r}

556
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,770
是啊，在等卡爾曼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.{\r}

557
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,020
他本來在這兒 拿了口箱子后來就走了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He was here before. He had a suitcase, and then he left.{\r}

558
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,480
卡爾曼走了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Carmine left?{\r}

559
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,240
他走了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's gone?{\r}

560
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,410
他不在這兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's not here?{\r}

561
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,420
他出去了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Carmine's out?{\r}

562
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,210
他好像過了馬路還是什么的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think he went across the street or somewhere else or something.{\r}

563
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,350
是喔，聽著，祝你在這兒好運
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Well, listen, good luck with the joint.{\r}

564
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,640
-謝啦，艾迪 -非常好運
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Thanks, Eddy. -Lots of luck.{\r}

565
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,220
也祝你好運
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Good luck to you, too.{\r}

566
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,140
他們忘了簽名
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}CASHlER: They forgot to sign their papers.{\r}

567
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,900
他們不需要這個了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They don't need those anymore.{\r}

568
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,310
因為基本尊重 我只給別幫家伙一點警告
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Out of respect, guys from other crews got away with a warning.{\r}

569
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,520
其他的人可得小心了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Everybody else, watch out.{\r}

570
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,160
像這群鄉巴佬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like these yokels here...{\r}

571
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,790
從沒聽過尼奇或他老家的老大們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who never heard of Nicky or the bosses back home.{\r}

572
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,240
這種王八蛋最麻煩了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're the morons who give you the most trouble.{\r}

573
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,490
被我們抓到后又會溜回來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We'd catch them and they'd try to sneak back...{\r}

574
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,160
戴著假胡子、假發、假鼻子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}with beards and wigs and fake noses.{\r}

575
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,720
只要看這些王八蛋下注的方式 你就可辨認他們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can spot these assholes by watching the way they bet.{\r}

576
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,420
像這家伙，以紫籌碼下注…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like this guy. He's betting lavender chips...{\r}

577
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,800
每次下五百，不過只有個小問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}at $500 each with only one little problem.{\r}

578
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,350
他每次都猜對
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's always guessed right.{\r}

579
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,310
要不是他這么貪心 可能還不會這么明顯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If he wasn't so fucking greedy, he'd have been tougher to spot.{\r}

580
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,320
不過到頭來，他們每個都貪
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But in the end, they're all greedy.{\r}

581
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,680
我看到莊家很弱 但他們并不是一伙的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I saw that the dealer was weak, but he wasn't in on it.{\r}

582
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,050
他只是沒保護好自己的牌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He just wasn't protecting his hand.{\r}

583
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,720
他把底牌掀得太高了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He was lifting his hole card way too high.{\r}

584
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,780
有個家伙在看莊家的底牌…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Here's this guy reading the dealer's hole card...{\r}

585
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:03,780
再對他坐在桌上的兄弟打手勢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and signaling his buddy at this table.{\r}

586
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,090
這些在外混的就是這樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And that's just what these hustlers look for.{\r}

587
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,220
他們從一家賭場到另一家 找尋著弱莊家…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They cruise from casino to casino looking for weak dealers...{\r}

588
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,920
像是獅子們找著弱小的羚羊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the way lions look for weak antelope.{\r}

589
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,230
接線生，這是羅先生
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Operator, this is Mr. R.{\r}

590
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:27,930
立刻叫阿姆斯壯 與佛萊迪來二號賭臺區
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Get me Armstrong and Friday over to Pit 2 right away.{\r}

591
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,040
二十一點第十九桌 第二個位子的那個大胡子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BJ 19, second base, the beard.{\r}

592
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,260
接線生，來段生日快樂曲 要大聲點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Operator, I need Mr. Happy. Loud.{\r}

593
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,800
祝你生日快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}WAlTRESSES: [Singing] Happy birthday to you{\r}

594
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,020
祝你生日快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Happy birthday to you{\r}

595
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,270
親愛的杰夫 祝你生日快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Happy birthday, dear Jeff{\r}

596
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,150
祝你生日快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Happy birthday to you{\r}

597
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,330
有人倒下！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GUARD: Man down!{\r}

598
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,510
叫救護車，有人心臟病發
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Go get medical. We got a cardiac arrest here.{\r}

599
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,640
他沒事了，大家 麻煩給我們一點空間
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's fine, folks. Just give us some room, please.{\r}

600
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,990
他們根本搞不清狀況
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: They never know what hit them.{\r}

601
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:47,900
若他們真的發現是被電擊棒電到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If and when they do find out they got zapped by a cattle prod...{\r}

602
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,320
他們會希望自己其實是心臟病發
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they wish they really did have a heart attack.{\r}

603
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,810
結果發現這兩個家伙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Turns out this guy and his fucking pals{\r}

604
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,540
已在這兒招搖撞騙好多年了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they were knocking this place dead for years.{\r}

605
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,580
-他身上有竊聽器 -你在干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GUARD 1 : He's wired. HUSTLER: What are you doing?{\r}

606
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,380
在那兒，就是它了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GUARD 1 : There it is. That's it.{\r}

607
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:05,470
-老千的正法 -我的天！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GUARD 2: Cheater's justice. HUSTLER: Oh, God!{\r}

608
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,290
不！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No!{\r}

609
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:13,470
我要所有人知道這兒跟以往不同了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I wanted everybody to know that things were changed around here.{\r}

610
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,980
我們得用這些家伙來讓大家知道 他們的好日子不長了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.{\r}

611
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,100
我很好奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just curious.{\r}

612
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,730
我看到你用右手玩籌碼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand.{\r}

613
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,820
-你兩只手都可以這樣嗎？ -不
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Can you do that with both hands? -No.{\r}

614
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,410
-不能用兩只手嗎？ -不能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You can't do it with both hands? HUSTLER: No, sir.{\r}

615
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,910
-左手可以嗎？ -我從沒試過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Can you do it with your left hand? -I never tried.{\r}

616
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:35,210
-所以你是右撇子 -是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-So, you're a righty. -Yeah.{\r}

617
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,970
那你現在得學習用左手羅
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.{\r}

618
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:50,640
-十萬，不，十一萬吧 -是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-It's $100,000, $1 10,000 I think. -Yes, it is.{\r}

619
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,850
好的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.{\r}

620
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:55,480
嗨
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Hi.{\r}

621
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,030
在大庭廣眾數這么多錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's a lot of money to be counting out in public.{\r}

622
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,700
為何不讓我拿到辦公室確認？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it?{\r}

623
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,870
多一點隱私
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A little privacy.{\r}

624
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,530
順便叫一瓶好香檳來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}By the way, send over a nice bottle of champagne on ice.{\r}

625
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,380
-沒問題 -要很特別的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}CASHlER: Sure will. BILLY: Real special.{\r}

626
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,340
對了，我是賭場經理 比利雪伯堤
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.{\r}

627
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:14,420
-還玩得愉快嗎？ -是的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BILLY: Having a good time? HUSTLER 2: Yes.{\r}

628
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,540
你在較有隱私的地方算比較好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You want to count the money in privacy.{\r}

629
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,300
我得趕飛機去克里夫蘭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}HUSTLER 2: I have a plane to catch.{\r}

630
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,840
我可以領取我贏得的錢嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can I get my winnings?{\r}

631
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:24,560
看他們對我的手做了什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look what they did to my hand, man.{\r}

632
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,680
我給你一個選擇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I'm gonna give you a choice:{\r}

633
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,360
你可以拿錢然后被錘頭砸 或者是從這兒走出去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can have the money and the hammer, or you can walk out of here.{\r}

634
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,530
-你要哪個？ -我要走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What do you want? -I wanna get out of here.{\r}

635
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,740
告訴你那群朋友，他們若來亂搞 會發生什么事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.{\r}

636
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,780
-對不起，我犯了大錯 -你真他媽的說對了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'm sorry, I made a bad mistake. -You're fucking right.{\r}

637
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,450
你們要是再敢回來 我會敲爛你們的頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: If you come back, either one of you, we'll break your fucking heads.{\r}

638
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:50,120
你看到那鋸子沒？不是放著好看的 不要再出現在這里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You see that fucking saw? We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around here.{\r}

639
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,250
-懂嗎？ -是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Got it? HUSTLER 2: Yes.{\r}

640
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,920
-給我滾 -謝謝你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Get out of here. -Thank you.{\r}

641
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,180
把他丟到后街去 跟條子說他被車撞到了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Throw him out in the alley. Tell the cops he got hit by a car.{\r}

642
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,430
不到一會兒，一切就都搞定了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Within no time, everything was set in place.{\r}

643
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,810
我們弄走了那些老千 盈利上揚好多…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We got rid of the freelance scamsters, the pro was way up...{\r}

644
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,070
上頭老大高興極了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.{\r}

645
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,560
然后我決定將生活復雜化
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And I decided to complicate my life.{\r}

646
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,280
對不愛冒險的我來說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}For a guy who likes sure things...{\r}

647
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,160
我用我的下半輩子 下了筆勝算不大的賭注
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real long shot.{\r}

648
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:14,950
我們也不年輕了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We're not getting any younger.{\r}

649
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,620
你不覺得是時候了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't you think it's time?{\r}

650
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,700
你對這些不厭煩嗎？ 這邊睡、那邊混？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Aren't you getting tired of all this shit? Banging around, hustling around?{\r}

651
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,000
-你想要妨礙我嗎？ -我想給你更好的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Are you trying to handicap me? -I'm gonna do you one better.{\r}

652
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,420
我想娶你進門
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying to marry you.{\r}

653
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:29,210
你想嫁我嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You wanna marry me?{\r}

654
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,310
我說真的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I'm serious.{\r}

655
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,970
我想定下來，想有個家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I wanna settle down. I want a family.{\r}

656
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,680
你找錯人了，山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You got the wrong girl, Sam.{\r}

657
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,360
我會是個好爸爸 你也將是個好媽媽
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'd be a good father, you'd be a good mother.{\r}

658
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,810
你不知道我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You don't know me.{\r}

659
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,480
你才認識我兩、三個月 你了解什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've known me two, three months. What do you know?{\r}

660
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,820
我已經43歲了，我不想再等了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.{\r}

661
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,620
我對你的了解深到 令我自己知道我非常愛你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.{\r}

662
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,950
你是我心目中最理想的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't think of anybody better to be with.{\r}

663
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,420
我不想再等了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't feel like waiting anymore.{\r}

664
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,000
你見過很多婚姻美滿的人嗎？ 我可沒見過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know a lot of happily married people? 'Cause I don't.{\r}

665
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,720
這我都懂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know all that.{\r}

666
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,010
我在乎你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I care about you.{\r}

667
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,890
但我對你沒有那種感覺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.{\r}

668
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,940
對不起，我并不愛你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.{\r}

669
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:26,870
-好的 -懂嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: All right. GINGER: Understand?{\r}

670
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,370
對不起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I'm sorry.{\r}

671
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,320
不…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No....{\r}

672
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,300
那可以培養
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That can grow.{\r}

673
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,550
只要互相尊重 感情是可以培養的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}As long as there's a mutual respect, that kind of thing can grow.{\r}

674
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,010
我很現實，我可以接受
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm realistic. I can accept that.{\r}

675
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,770
愛到底是什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What is love anyway?{\r}

676
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:50,470
不就是互相尊重 不就是一心一意
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.{\r}

677
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,440
是一個人在乎另一個人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a caring from one person to another.{\r}

678
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,650
若我們可以設立一個基礎…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And if we could set up some kind of foundation...{\r}

679
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,190
以相互尊重為底…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}based on that mutual respect...{\r}

680
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,280
我覺得遲早你會對我有情…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I feel that eventually you would care enough about me...{\r}

681
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,160
這樣我能接受
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that I could live with that.{\r}

682
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,250
若行不通的話…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If it doesn't work out...{\r}

683
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,000
若行不通的話 那我怎么辦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?{\r}

684
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,300
我現在做得不錯 往后會越來越好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm doing well now. I'm gonna do even better.{\r}

685
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,350
不論如何…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So whatever happens...{\r}

686
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,850
就算我們倆行不通…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}if it doesn't work out between us...{\r}

687
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,550
我都會確保你下半輩子的生活
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll make sure you're okay for the rest of your life.{\r}

688
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,800
尤其如果有了孩子…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If there are kids, especially...{\r}

689
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,560
我會給你今生最好的照料
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll take care of you better than you'd imagine.{\r}

690
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,020
-你葫蘆到底賣什么藥？ -我都明講了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: What are you pitching me? SAM: Just what I said.{\r}

691
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,690
你下半輩子都不用愁
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You'll be set up for the rest of your life.{\r}

692
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,660
這我可保證
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That I can promise you.{\r}

693
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,650
要不要試試？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Want to take a chance?{\r}

694
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,630
我娶金吉兒時就聽過她的一切往事…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: When I married Ginger, I knew all the stories...{\r}

695
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,430
但我不在乎 我是山姆羅斯坦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but I didn't give a fuck. I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.{\r}

696
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,640
我能改變她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can change her.{\r}

697
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,730
這是典型的艾斯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: It was typical Ace.{\r}

698
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,110
他請了城里所有的大人物 他知道他們都會出席
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He invited the biggest people in town. He knew they'd show.{\r}

699
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,610
他知道他們都有求于他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He knew they all wanted something from him.{\r}

700
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,940
艾斯絕對不可能不求回報 連金吉兒也不例外
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger.{\r}

701
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,900
一切還是依他行事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}With her, he still covered his bets.{\r}

702
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,070
他們在結婚前得先有孩子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They had to have the baby first, before they could get married.{\r}

703
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,660
他甚至還托我們幫忙看艾美幾天…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He even made us watch Amy for a few days...{\r}

704
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,250
好讓他們去渡蜜月
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}when they went on their honeymoon.{\r}

705
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,050
無所謂啊 我們愛死那孩子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't mind, we loved the kid.{\r}

706
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,140
你感到我的眼神？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: Can you feel my eyes on you?{\r}

707
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,800
你感到我看透你的心嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can you feel me look into your heart?{\r}

708
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,390
你能感到我躺在你肚皮上嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach?{\r}

709
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,400
你能在體內感受我？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can you feel me in you?{\r}

710
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,520
在心里？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In your heart?{\r}

711
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,990
別等我過去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't make me come there.{\r}

712
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,620
回答我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Answer me.{\r}

713
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,540
我愛你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: [Crying] I love you.{\r}

714
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,790
寶貝，你知道我也愛你嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Baby, do you know that I love you, too?{\r}

715
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,040
-不，萊斯特 -你知道嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: No, Lester. LESTER: Do you know that?{\r}

716
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,240
知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Yes.{\r}

717
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,630
這是我目前能為自己做的 最好的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.{\r}

718
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,960
沒錯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's right.{\r}

719
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,840
所以會沒事的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So it's going to be okay.{\r}

720
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,170
你發誓？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Promise?{\r}

721
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,140
我希望你幸福
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I wish you all the luck in the world.{\r}

722
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,010
-真的？ -是，我真的這么想
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: You do? LESTER: Yeah, I do.{\r}

723
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,390
這是你目前能做的最好的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's the best thing you can do right now.{\r}

724
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,360
我說真的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean this.{\r}

725
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,570
你生活會很安穩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You have real security.{\r}

726
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:25,520
甜心，你將坐在賭城最有利的位子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.{\r}

727
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,910
這對我們來說再好不過了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come on. This is great for us.{\r}

728
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:31,120
我會一直都在你身邊的 我哪兒都不會去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm always gonna be here for you. I ain't going no place.{\r}

729
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,880
我現在就在看著你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm looking at you right now.{\r}

730
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:38,970
仿佛生平第一次見到你似的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm seeing you for the very first time, right this minute.{\r}

731
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,460
我可聽到我的心悸動
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm saying I can feel my heart click.{\r}

732
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,140
我看到你十四歲時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I see you 14 years old.{\r}

733
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,390
我在見你的第一秒就看到你了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I see you the first second I ever saw you.{\r}

734
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:50,180
我看到你，像匹長腿的小馬兒…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I see you, long-legged little colt...{\r}

735
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,430
還戴著蠢蠢的牙套
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}stupid braces on your teeth.{\r}

736
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,850
-好吧 -我每次見你時都看到這些
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, then. LESTER: Every time I see you, that's what I see.{\r}

737
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,940
再聊羅，再見
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Talk to you later. Bye.{\r}

738
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:07,870
-你還好嗎？ -嗯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You all right? -Yeah.{\r}

739
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:11,290
為什么哭？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why are you crying?{\r}

740
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,000
我沒有哭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not crying.{\r}

741
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,010
-別喝這么多了吧 -我沒事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Maybe you shouldn't drink so much. -I'm okay.{\r}

742
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,230
希望你能理解
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You just have to understand.{\r}

743
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:33,910
我自小就跟萊斯特在一起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I've been with Lester since I was a kid.{\r}

744
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,950
我只是想道別
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just wanted to say goodbye.{\r}

745
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,700
我只是…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just....{\r}

746
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,040
我想我有權這樣做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think I have a right to do that.{\r}

747
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,790
好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Okay?{\r}

748
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,000
沒關系
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's all right.{\r}

749
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,680
你那段人生已經完結了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That part of your life is over with.{\r}

750
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:57,260
-不是嗎？ -是的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Right? GINGER: Yeah.{\r}

751
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,630
你現在跟我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're with me now.{\r}

752
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:02,810
-是的 -不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Yeah. -Right?{\r}

753
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:08,100
-你確定嗎？ -是的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You're sure? GINGER: Yeah.{\r}

754
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:18,870
-要走了嗎？我們回去吧 -好的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Want to go? Let's go back in. GINGER: Okay.{\r}

755
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,080
很好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: It's great.{\r}

756
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:53,340
都是我的東西，天呀
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.{\r}

757
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,180
你把我的東西都帶來了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You brought all my stuff!{\r}

758
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:57,750
我不能…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't....{\r}

759
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,930
試試看，這是你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Try it on. It's yours.{\r}

760
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,100
別開玩笑了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're kidding.{\r}

761
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:06,510
我的天
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}My God.{\r}

762
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,860
-是什么毛？ -是龍貓
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What is it? -It's chinchilla.{\r}

763
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:11,990
好軟喔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's so soft.{\r}

764
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,860
很好喔？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nice, isn't it?{\r}

765
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,450
從沒有人對我這么好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No one's ever been so nice to me.{\r}

766
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,010
我的老天！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Oh, my God!{\r}

767
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,420
我要是在同一天將它們全都戴上 會不會太過火啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you think it's too much if I wear these all on the same day?{\r}

768
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,550
你想怎樣就怎樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can do whatever you want.{\r}

769
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:45,340
我有沒有實現我的諾言啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do I keep my promises or do I keep my promises?{\r}

770
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,430
你太好了 這些珠寶也不錯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad either.{\r}

771
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:52,270
我們不應該把這些放在家里 應該擺到銀行去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in the bank.{\r}

772
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,570
我不能留一副在家嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?{\r}

773
00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:56,690
仔細聽好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Pay attention to me.{\r}

774
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,480
我要告訴你一件重要的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What I'm gonna tell you is very important.{\r}

775
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,490
這全部都不算什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All this stuff doesn't mean anything.{\r}

776
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,990
錢財珠寶 如果沒有信任就毫無意義
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust.{\r}

777
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,500
我得要信任你到可將生命交給你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I have to be able to trust you with my life.{\r}

778
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:14,210
洛杉磯

779
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:23,000
總價值超過一百萬的現金與珠寶 鎖在賭城的銀行里…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: With over $1 million in cash and jewels tucked in a bank in Vegas...{\r}

780
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,300
全歸她所有 金吉兒非常有安全感
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}only for Ginger, she was secure and happy.{\r}

781
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:26,680
她最愛那些
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She loved that shit.{\r}

782
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,930
但在我這行里 手上得有許多流動的現金
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.{\r}

783
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,100
貪污的條子與綁匪 他們都不收支票
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Crooked cops and kidnappers, they don't take checks.{\r}

784
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,770
考林先生，需要幫忙嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Need any help with that, Mr. Collins?{\r}

785
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,350
所以我在洛杉磯的銀行里 也擺了兩百萬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: So I put $2 million cash in a Los Angeles bank...{\r}

786
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,280
用考林先生與夫人的名義
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}under the name of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.{\r}

787
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,530
這純粹是我個人的贖金與保金
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.{\r}

788
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,500
因為在我最需要這筆錢時 我不是蹲在牢里就是被關在衣柜…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Since I'd be in jail or locked in a closet when I needed the money most...{\r}

789
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:59,300
所以我將這筆錢唯一的鑰匙 給了金吉兒好讓我能保命
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.{\r}

790
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,730
這是簽名卡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is just a signature card.{\r}

791
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,810
她簽了之后就會是世上…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Once she signs, she'll be the only person...{\r}

792
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:21,150
唯一可以開保險箱的人 連我都開啟不了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to have total access to the box, no one else, including myself?{\r}

793
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:23,810
是的，這是你的要求
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BANKER: That's right. That's the way you wanted it.{\r}

794
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,620
山姆，我問你個問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sam, let me ask you a question.{\r}

795
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,490
你一定很信任你老婆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You must really trust your wife.{\r}

796
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,080
是啊，怎么啦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sure I do. Why?{\r}

797
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:37,410
很好啊，只是很少見
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's good. It's just unusual.{\r}

798
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,420
實不相瞞 我有很多客戶都不信任
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.{\r}

799
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,730
將金吉兒還有錢的事解決后 我安心多了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: With Ginger and the money in place, I felt covered.{\r}

800
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,390
為了安全起見，我又將頭銜…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To play it safe, I switched job titles again...{\r}

801
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,690
換成餐飲董事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and made myself Food and Beverage Director.{\r}

802
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:07,310
這樣一來就沒人可以 為執照的事找我麻煩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This way nobody would bother me about a license.{\r}

803
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,450
賭城對我來說像是個夢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Vegas was like a dream for me.{\r}

804
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,410
問題是尼奇也夢想著 他自己的賭城
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Trouble was Nicky was dreaming of his own kind of Vegas.{\r}

805
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,750
我將錢放出，每天三分利
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I put money out on the street charging three points a week.{\r}

806
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,990
莊家高利貸
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Juice to the dealers.{\r}

807
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:20,490
-別逼我們找上門 -你不會需要這樣的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Don't make us look for you. -You won't have to look for me.{\r}

808
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,460
多謝了，尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.{\r}

809
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:25,130
他們不是爛賭鬼就是爛毒鬼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: They were degenerate gamblers, coke freaks.{\r}

810
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,630
沒多久，坦吉樂一半的莊家 都在我手掌心里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In no time, I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.{\r}

811
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:33,890
下一步，我開始出千騙大賭客的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then, the next thing I did, I started busting out high-stakes poker players.{\r}

812
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,480
好明顯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It was so obvious.{\r}

813
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,720
尼奇所有的小把戲 全都是靠手勢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were signal-happy.{\r}

814
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,510
我下五百
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna open for $500.{\r}

815
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:42,140
互相打手勢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Signaling back and forth.{\r}

816
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:49,150
尼奇以為沒人注意到他 但是他錯了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky thought nobody was watching him. But he was wrong.{\r}

817
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,900
我不想要那些探員在我的地盤
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't want any of those agents near my place.{\r}

818
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,490
-四條A -我不相信
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Four aces. -I can't believe this.{\r}

819
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:58,370
我唯一的運氣好像就是手氣背
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GAMBLER 2: If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck.{\r}

820
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:03,370
我真希望尼奇與他那票人 可以馬上消失
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I wished Nicky and his whole crew would just get lost.{\r}

821
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,880
但我能怎樣？ 回老家去挑起場戰爭？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What am I gonna do? Go back home and start a war?{\r}

822
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,710
尼奇在幫里算是有頭有臉的人物 我不能那么做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.{\r}

823
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,790
到處都是賭博游樂公會的探員
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Gaming agents are all over the place.{\r}

824
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,220
這兒不允許手氣旺的人嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?{\r}

825
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,220
你已經旺了一個禮拜了 他們在找機會逮你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've been lucky all week. They're looking to nail you.{\r}

826
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,260
艾斯太在意他的賭場…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Ace was so worried about his casino...{\r}

827
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,150
他忘了我們當初為什么而來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he forgot what we were doing out here in the first place.{\r}

828
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,100
最少有一百萬次 我都好想在他耳邊大喊…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A million times, I wanted to yell in his fucking ear:{\r}

829
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,940
這兒是拉斯維加斯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"This is Las Vegas.{\r}

830
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,270
“我們本來就是來搶錢的 你這個蠢猶太人”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"We're supposed to be out here robbing, you dumb fucking hebe. "{\r}

831
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:38,870
我才不在乎他有什么關系
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't give a shit who he's connected to.{\r}

832
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,830
叫他把腳從桌上拿下來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tell him to take his feet off the table.{\r}

833
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,240
他以為這兒是什么廉價的地方？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Does he think this is a goddamn sawdust joint?{\r}

834
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:46,830
先生，麻煩你將腳放下…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sir, would you mind taking your feet off the table...{\r}

835
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,460
并將鞋穿上，好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and put your shoes on, please?{\r}

836
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,040
是，是很麻煩 我今天已經夠背了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, I would mind. I'm having a bad night.{\r}

837
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,040
那王八蛋動都不動
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fucking asshole won't budge.{\r}

838
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,630
叫警衛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Call security.{\r}

839
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:02,520
你好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How are you?{\r}

840
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,180
好，你呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Good. How are you?{\r}

841
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:07,930
給個面子，把你的腳放下去 然后把鞋穿上好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do me a favor. Want to take your feet off the table and put your shoes on?{\r}

842
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,350
去你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck you.{\r}

843
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,700
我要你把這家伙從賭場架著丟出去…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want you to exit this guy off the premises, off his feet...{\r}

844
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:18,280
用他的頭來開門
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and use his head to open the fucking door.{\r}

845
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,530
先生，你得離開 麻煩你跟我們出去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind coming with us outside?{\r}

846
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,490
媽的，我哪兒都不跟你去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Bullshit. I ain't going anywhere with you.{\r}

847
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,660
-媽的，你給我滾 -去你的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GUARD: Bullshit. You're out of here. MAN: Fuck you!{\r}

848
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:30,130
你知道你在招惹誰嗎？ 你知道嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: You know who you're fucking with? Do you?{\r}

849
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,370
你他媽的王八蛋！ 你知道你招惹了誰嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You fucking faggot! Do you know who you're fucking with?{\r}

850
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:35,220
別碰我！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Leave me alone!{\r}

851
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,880
-喂！ -別鬧了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GUARD: Come on! MAN: You gotta be kidding me!{\r}

852
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:41,220
不出所料，我一小時后就接到電話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Sure enough, an hour later, I get the call.{\r}

853
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,130
艾斯，那邊怎么了？ 你知道那家伙是跟我的嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ace, what happened over there? Did you know that guy was with me?{\r}

854
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,390
我不知道，你知道他做了什么嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't know that. You know what he did?{\r}

855
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,940
我很有禮貌的走過去 他卻叫我回家吃自已
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I walked over to him politely, and he tells me to fuck myself.{\r}

856
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,020
-還罵我是臭玻璃 -什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Then he called me a faggot. NICKY: What?{\r}

857
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,400
-我把那王八蛋踢出去了 -過來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I threw that cocksucker out. NICKY: Come here.{\r}

858
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:58,780
你罵我的朋友臭玻璃 還叫他回家吃自己？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You called my friend a faggot? Told him to go fuck himself?{\r}

859
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:01,320
你這樣說？ 叫他回家吃自己？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Is that what you did? Tell him to go fuck himself?{\r}

860
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,740
你這個死鄉巴佬！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: [On phone] You fucking hick, you!{\r}

861
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,750
你給我過去道歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: You go over there. You apologize.{\r}

862
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,700
你最好求他讓你進去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: You better hope he lets you back in.{\r}

863
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,000
你要再敢沒大沒小 我會將你的頭打到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you get out of line again, I'll smash your head so hard...{\r}

864
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:17,250
你連那牛仔帽都戴不上 死鄉巴佬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you won't be able to get that cowboy hat on. Fucking hick.{\r}

865
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,000
聽著，這家伙壓根就不知道 自己在跟誰說話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Listen, this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.{\r}

866
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,680
他不知道我們是好兄弟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He doesn't know that we're dear friends.{\r}

867
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,970
他非常抱歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's already very sorry.{\r}

868
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,930
但如果你可買我個面子 讓他再進去…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But if you could do me a favor and let him back in...{\r}

869
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,480
我發誓他再也不會亂來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I swear he'll never get out of line again.{\r}

870
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,890
若他再敢亂來，就別想再踏進這兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If he does it again, he's out for good.{\r}

871
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,150
我永遠都不會再讓他進門
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll never let him in the place again.{\r}

872
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,820
真是對不起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I'm sorry about this.{\r}

873
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,030
好嗎，艾斯？ 謝了，兄弟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.{\r}

874
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,570
你把鞋都脫了？ 把腳放在桌上？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table?{\r}

875
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,910
你這全身馬糞騷的渾蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You shit-kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!{\r}

876
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,130
你要敢再去丟我的臉 我會在沙漠里將你埋了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the desert.{\r}

877
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,790
-快給我去道歉 -尼奇，對不起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Go over and apologize. MAN: Nicky, I'm sorry.{\r}

878
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:03,380
艾斯可是個很敏感的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Ace could be a very touchy guy.{\r}

879
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:05,720
尤其是當他在城里越來越出名后
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Especially when he got bigger in town.{\r}

880
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:09,010
像他將強納森與大衛 從凱撒宮挖角來時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like when he hired Jonathan and David away from the Palace...{\r}

881
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,510
他為他們蓋了全新的舞臺 還給了他們一人一輛勞斯萊斯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}by building them a new stage and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.{\r}

882
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,560
但我得說 他真的知道怎么吸引群眾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But, I tell you, he knew how to bring in the crowds.{\r}

883
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:17,730
他懂得一切門路
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He knew all the fucking angles.{\r}

884
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,350
他將整個蛇蝎美人的秀 從巴黎搬來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He brought the whole Femme Fatale show from Paris...{\r}

885
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:23,690
但他卻忘記那些歐洲跳舞妹有多懶
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but he forgot how lazy them European dancing broads can get.{\r}

886
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,870
他還得每周為她們秤體重 她們的身材才不至于像吹氣球
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He had to weigh them once a week so they wouldn't blow up like balloons.{\r}

887
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,620
你還是4公斤過重
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're still eight pounds over.{\r}

888
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:32,410
-為什么會這樣？ -羅斯坦您…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What's the reason for this? -Mr. Rothstein, sir--{\r}

889
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,740
別在那兒您了 她為什么會超重4公斤？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Never mind the "sir." Why is she eight pounds over?{\r}

890
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,870
我只是尊重您
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying to use respect.{\r}

891
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,330
羅斯坦先生就可以了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.{\r}

892
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,040
嗯，有時當你給她們 太多的壓力…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Well, sometimes when you put that pressure point on them--{\r}

893
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:47,420
你只需要給我答案 給我正確答案就好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All you do is give me answers. Just give me the right answer.{\r}

894
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,560
我不知道，她害怕要是不減肥 她就會被解雇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know why. She's frightened if she doesn't lose weight she'll get fired.{\r}

895
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,350
沒錯，她會被解雇 送她回巴黎…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's right, she will get fired. Send her back to Paris--{\r}

896
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,520
-我們一貫的做法是… -停
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-It's been our policy-- -Stop everything.{\r}

897
00:53:56,730 --> 00:53:59,600
-她很出名 -這就是問題，她太懶散
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AGENT: She's an institution. SAM: That's the problem. She's lazy.{\r}

898
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,850
我得佩服這家伙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I gotta give the guy credit.{\r}

899
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,190
我的意思是 他做了最明顯的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, he does the most obvious thing.{\r}

900
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,570
這里是全國唯一可以合法簽注的地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit.{\r}

901
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,770
為什么不加以利用呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So why not take advantage, right?{\r}

902
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,360
所以他把簽注從街上…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So he took bookie joints off the street...{\r}

903
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:14,330
開到賭場內
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and opened them up inside the casino.{\r}

904
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:17,080
沒幾年后…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Within a few years, he had...{\r}

905
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,960
精華地段的每家賭場都想抄襲他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}every casino on The Strip trying to copy off of him.{\r}

906
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,790
我的創意…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Between my innovations...{\r}

907
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,840
加上尼奇對工作的投入…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and Nicky's dedication to his job...{\r}

908
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,960
我的賭場很快就成為 精華地段中最好的賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I soon had the best operation on The Strip.{\r}

909
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,350
小心點，你最近很引人注目
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you.{\r}

910
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,810
怎么，有人抱怨嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why, somebody is complaining?{\r}

911
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,440
我從警衛那兒聽來的 他們以前都曾是警察
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm hearing things from security. They're all ex-cops.{\r}

912
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:47,150
警長已將你放入黑名單了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The sheriff wants to put you in the Black Book.{\r}

913
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,320
那黑名單根本就是個屁
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That Black Book is a bunch of bullshit.{\r}

914
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,480
全國只有兩個人的名字在里面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's two names in it for the whole country...{\r}

915
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,360
教父艾爾卡邦就是其中之一
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and one of them is still Al Capone.{\r}

916
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,240
你上了名單麻煩就大了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They put you in that book, you're gonna be in trouble.{\r}

917
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:58,830
你將進不了賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You won't be able to walk into a casino.{\r}

918
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,700
我只不過是在養家活口罷了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying to make a living, that's all.{\r}

919
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:04,700
我只是跟你講一聲 別說我沒警告你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm just telling you. Don't say I didn't warn you.{\r}

920
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,760
羅斯坦夫人，請看前面 很好，謝謝你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PHOTOGRAPHER: Mrs. Rothstein, straight ahead. Very nice. Thank you.{\r}

921
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,430

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PHILIP: For his hard work and dedication...{\r}

922
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,810
與他為拉斯維加斯帶來的新生命…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and the new life blood he has instilled in Las Vegas...{\r}

923
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,860
山姆將自己建立為賭博游樂業界…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sam has established himself as an indispensable member...{\r}

924
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:30,020
不可缺乏的成員
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}of the gaming community.{\r}

925
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:32,730

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}it's my pleasure to welcome Sam Rothstein...{\r}

要是在老家，我所做的 早就讓我蹲牢房去了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Back home, they'd put me in jail for what I'm doing.{\r}

930
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,490
但在這兒，他們卻頒獎給我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But out here, they're giving me awards.{\r}

931
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,010
我很榮幸能獲得…

恭喜你，甜心
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Congratulations, sweetheart.{\r}

934
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,220
山姆募得了有史來 最多的捐款
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.{\r}

935
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,590
但我最愛的還是看著我老婆 金吉兒周旋全場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: But my greatest pleasure was watching my wife work the room.{\r}

936
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,360
他們愛死她了 但你又怎能不愛她？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They all loved her. How could you not love her?{\r}

937
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,810
她是世上最有魅力的女人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.{\r}

938
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,490
人們都喜歡在她身邊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}People loved to be around her.{\r}

939
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:18,250

945
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,060
你是我見過最美麗的女人 羅斯坦先生，你真是個幸運的男人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're one of the most gorgeous women I've seen. You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.{\r}

946
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,200
多謝夸獎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks for that compliment.{\r}

947
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:54,040
他是賭場里的小伙子 挺好又聰明的小子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He was a young kid from the casino. Nice kid. Bright boy.{\r}

948
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:57,330
這小子真他媽的帶種 我第二天就炒了他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What balls on this fucking kid. The next day I fired him.{\r}

949
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:02,720
金吉兒對人就是有這種魅力 她甚至鼓勵他們這樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ginger had that effect on people. I think she even encouraged them.{\r}

950
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,550
你想看看這件嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Do you wanna see this one?{\r}

951
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,350
爸爸幫我買了這么多珠寶 因為他好愛我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.{\r}

952
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:12,600
但不管他們多愛她…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: But as much as they loved her...{\r}

953
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,820
真美麗
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Fabulous.{\r}

954
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,820
他們都不知道什么讓她感動
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...they didn't know what really moved her.{\r}

955
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,230
看看這個
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Look at this.{\r}

956
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,980
爸爸給我的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Daddy gave me....{\r}

957
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:21,800
金吉兒快快樂樂的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: With Ginger happy,{\r}

958
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,250
我才能專心去做我所專長的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was able to concentrate on what I knew best.{\r}

959
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,160
較松的機器都在后面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Loose machines are right back over there.{\r}

960
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:30,420
它們在那兒干嘛？ 看都看不到
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are they doing back there? You can't even see them.{\r}

961
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,750
好吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.{\r}

962
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:34,000
那最大累積獎金的那些呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What about the progressives with the high jackpots?{\r}

963
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,590
這些是我們最好的機子 都是靠它們
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}These are our best machines. They bring all the action.{\r}

964
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:40,680
難怪盈收變少了 重頭戲都在前面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No wonder the drop is off. The action is in the front.{\r}

965
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:42,850
-擺到前面去 -好的，我會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Bring them up front. -All right, I will.{\r}

966
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,100
聽好了 在這有三種做事方法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Listen carefully. There are three ways of doing things here.{\r}

967
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,770
正確的、不正確的 和我的方法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The right way, the wrong way, and the way that I do it.{\r}

968
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,740
-懂了沒？ -我懂了，馬上去辦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Understand? -I do understand. I'll get right on it.{\r}

969
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:55,710
-謝謝 -別謝我，去做就是了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Thank you. -Don't thank me. Just do it.{\r}

970
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,250
你是吃角子老虎機的經理 我不應該還需要告訴你這些
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're the slots manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.{\r}

971
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,410
唉，你說得真對 真是抱歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Dang, you are right. I'm so sorry.{\r}

972
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,380
我一天得工作18個小時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: So I ended up working 18-hour days.{\r}

973
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,920
金吉兒反倒是成為 真正享受賭城的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.{\r}

974
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:12,850
請跟我來，我帶您去更好的桌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come with me, please. I have a better table for you.{\r}

975
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,300
你到底跟那王八蛋說了些什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What did you say to that fucking jerk, anyway?{\r}

976
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:17,900
我跟她說我是羅斯坦夫人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I told him that I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.{\r}

977
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:21,780
當然得加以利用羅
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You might as well get something out of it.{\r}

978
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,740
不久后我所擔心的事就發生了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened.{\r}

979
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,410
尼奇把自己搞到成為 全賭城的拒絕往來戶
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Vegas.{\r}

980
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:36,490
從那時起，我在賭城完全不能 被人看見與他交談
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}From then on, I couldn't be seen talking to him anywhere in or near Vegas.{\r}

981
00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:38,460
這他媽的是什么意思？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What the fuck is that supposed to mean?{\r}

982
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,010
因對業者有害…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"...detrimental to gaming and...{\r}

983
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,630
“他將被禁止進入 拉斯維加斯中任何賭場”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.{\r}

984
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:48,560
“違反此規的賭場 在他每次出現時…”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"And the casinos can be fined as much as $100,000...{\r}

985
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:50,350
“都將被罰款逾十萬元”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"every time he shows up."{\r}

986
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,530
-你相信嗎？ -是啊，你被禁了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You believe this shit? -Yeah, you got banned.{\r}

987
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:57,320
“因為眾所周知的惡名昭彰”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"Because of notorious and unsavory reputation."{\r}

988
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:58,990
那些渾蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Motherfucker.{\r}

989
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:04,540
-有什么可擺平的方法嗎？ -不，沒辦法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Is there any way around this? -No, there's no way.{\r}

990
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,500
例如說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let's say, for instance...{\r}

991
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:12,710
我去了家剛好就附設賭場的餐廳…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want to go into the restaurant, which happens to be in the casino...{\r}

992
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,500
為了想吃它的三明治呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to get one of those sandwiches I like?{\r}

993
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,390
別想了，你連停車場都踏不進去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot.{\r}

994
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,180
就是這么嚴重
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's how serious it is.{\r}

995
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:26,440
-換句話說，我玩完了？ -換幾句話都是這意思
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-in other words, I'm fucked? -in so many words, yes.{\r}

996
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:30,320
他完全都沒了解那黑名單的意義
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant.{\r}

997
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,490
不能進賭場只是其一…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing...{\r}

998
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:38,410
這名單會將你的名字刻在 每一個聯邦調查員的腦海里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent.{\r}

999
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,870
你與芝加哥教父是一樣的 但尼奇不在乎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.{\r}

1000
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:45,260
我得想想辦法 他們趕不走我的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta do something. They ain't getting rid of me.{\r}

1001
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,010
他們趕不走我的 我要待在這兒，去他們的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're not getting rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck them.{\r}

1002
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,020
所以他們一開始這鳥規矩…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: So once they pulled that shit...{\r}

1003
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,310
我就開始做自己突發奇想的事情
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I started doing my own things in Vegas nobody had thought of doing.{\r}

1004
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,910
為了多點眼線 我將我弟弟與些惡漢從老家帶來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother and some desperados...{\r}

1005
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:09,700
開始搶劫一些賭場豪客、賭場老大…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}from back home and started knocking over high rollers, casino bosses...{\r}

1006
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:12,040
下注組頭等等，全部一網打盡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}bookmakers, anybody right here in town.{\r}

1007
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:15,040
說真的，我這隊人馬還真是不錯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had a good fucking crew going for me, I'll tell you that.{\r}

1008
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,540
我有沙爾福斯寇 最擅長從二樓進屋偷東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy.{\r}

1009
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:23,560
杰克哈迪在被關六年前 曾在保險箱制造公司工作
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Jack Hardy worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.{\r}

1010
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,930
還有本尼布盧 這家伙不論什么警鈴都能解除
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then there was Bernie Blue. This guy could bypass any alarm for me.{\r}

1011
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,930
就像以前一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It was like old times.{\r}

1012
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:34,730
我也開了自己的珠寶店 叫做掏金熱潮
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I opened up my own jewelry store, too. The Gold Rush.{\r}

1013
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,690
有時我會為了刺激好玩 而參與偷竊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sometimes I used to go along on a heist, just for the fun of it.{\r}

1014
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:42,160
我不喜歡被我偷的人看著我…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't like the people I was ripping off looking at me...{\r}

1015
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:44,500
所以我都將他們的照片轉過去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}so I turned their fucking pictures around.{\r}

1016
01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:47,670
-為什么這么久？ -這東西真他媽的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What's taking so long? JACK: This is a motherfucker!{\r}

1017
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:52,080
-在動了 -學會怎么開就不用整個搬走了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's working. NICKY: Learn to open these instead of taking them.{\r}

1018
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,380
這些寶石的瑕疵真多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: These stones got a lot of niggers in them.{\r}

1019
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:56,710
那該死的皮皮要是私下偷換鉆石…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If that fucking Pepe's switching stones on us...{\r}

1020
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:00,220
他最好給我騎駱駝回奈及利亞
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he better take a fucking camel back to Nigeria.{\r}

1021
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,640
-他們在總統套房K -單獨登記嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-They're in Penthouse "K." -Check in alone?{\r}

1022
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:05,570
-是的 -他們出去了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-They checked in alone. -Are they out now?{\r}

1023
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,690
-是，別擔心 -好的，謝啦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Yes. Don't worry. -All right. Thanks.{\r}

1024
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,730
我們在整城里都有線民 從旅館侍者…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He had tipsters all over town. Bellmen...{\r}

1025
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,950
-得快點 -好的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You got to hurry. -Okay.{\r}

1026
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,490
-停車小弟… -他們正在登記
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-...valet parkers... -They're just checking in now.{\r}

1027
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:18,170
-我會告訴他 -賭區經理…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'll tell him. -...pit bosses...{\r}

1028
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,500
在西洛可的1230房
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Room 1230 at the Scirocco.{\r}

1029
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:22,500
-1230房，收到 -還有秘書
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-1 230. Right. -...secretaries.{\r}

1030
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:25,300
-完美狀況的硬幣 -完美狀況嗎？收到
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Mint condition coins. -Mint condition? All right.{\r}

1031
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,170
他們當然都有一份
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: They all got a piece of the score.{\r}

1032
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,760
車來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Car's coming.{\r}

1033
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:34,890
他們都很謹慎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: They were very careful.{\r}

1034
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,560
他們每次都先解除警鈴 要不然…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They always bypassed the alarms, or else, if not...{\r}

1035
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:42,280
就在墻上打洞然后鑿墻而入
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they'd drill enough holes to knock through the walls with a sledgehammer.{\r}

1036
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,940
尼奇能偷的都偷了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky was grabbing everything he could.{\r}

1037
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,070
外頭根本沒有人想到 會有像他那樣的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nobody out there was expecting a guy like him.{\r}

1038
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,840
對尼奇來說 拉斯維加斯就像是蠻荒西部
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.{\r}

1039
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,080
我才剛拿到一批從以色列來的鉆石
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.{\r}

1040
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,900
他們他媽的想要我怎樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What the fuck did they expect from me?{\r}

1041
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,210
我得賺錢，不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had to earn, didn't I?{\r}

1042
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:03,390
-這些鉆石有瑕疵 -沒有瑕疵
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-This diamond has flaws in it. -There's no flaws in it.{\r}

1043
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,390
別告訴我怎么做 我在這行已經25年了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 25 years.{\r}

1044
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,730
你的放大鏡最好擦干凈點 因為這批鉆石沒有瑕疵
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You better clean your loupe, because there's no flaws in this diamond.{\r}

1045
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,480
通常要是附近來的貨…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: When we got local merch...{\r}

1046
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,850
我們都會送到棕櫚泉市 或是亞利桑那州與洛杉磯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}we'd usually send it to Palm Springs, or Arizona, L.A.{\r}

1047
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,030
我有幾個熟識的中東佬 你知道，阿拉伯人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.{\r}

1048
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,700
你們是要開會還是要買鉆石？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Are you gonna have a meeting or buy some diamonds?{\r}

1049
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,990
我懂他的語言，我跟他講講
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know his language. I'm talking with him.{\r}

1050
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,910
全部四萬塊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$40,000, you buy the whole package.{\r}

1051
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:27,080
兩萬，不要拉倒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$20,000. That's my final offer.{\r}

1052
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:31,200
他突然會說英文了 別玩游戲了，兩萬五
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He suddenly talks English. Let's talk turkey. $25,000.{\r}

1053
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:36,340
我將我的房間改為保險箱 保留一些我特選的好東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.{\r}

1054
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:42,770
因為警察可能會突然臨檢 所以不能將其留在店里…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush in case we got raided by the cops...{\r}

1055
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,610
也防止我手下手癢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}or if my crew got cute.{\r}

1056
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:47,320
我保有唯一的鑰匙 珍妮佛才不在乎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had the only key. Jennifer didn't give a fuck.{\r}

1057
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,360
她每晚都在沙發上 看電影看到睡著
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She fell asleep on the couch watching TV every night.{\r}

1058
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:54,480
這些全是我的東西 我一樣也沒送回老家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This stuff was all mine. I didn't send any of this back home.{\r}

1059
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,750
其實我也不行 因為我根本不應該做這些
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Actually, I couldn't, because I wasn't supposed to be doing it.{\r}

1060
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:00,410
老大們光是賭場就賺飽了…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The bosses were making so much money with the casinos...{\r}

1061
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,830
他們不希望有人惹是非
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that they didn't want anybody making any waves.{\r}

1062
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:07,170
你的人馬每人都分到了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've all given your crew a piece of that?{\r}

1063
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,840
我大家都罩好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I took care of everybody.{\r}

1064
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,010
這就是為什么在我來之前 拉斯維加斯并沒有犯罪集團
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: That's why there was no real organized street stuff in Vegas before I came.{\r}

1065
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,730
但我家衣柜里又能藏多少錢呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?{\r}

1066
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,900
你必須要了解 而我也相信你了解…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You have to understand, and I'm sure you do...{\r}

1067
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:20,690
做這種風險大的投資…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that in a venture of this kind...{\r}

1068
01:03:20,820 --> 01:03:23,190
要有可能虧損的心理準備
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you must be prepared to take some kind of loss.{\r}

1069
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:28,030
我將一些錢交給查理克拉克 艾斯的銀行經理，做一些正當投資
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I put some money in legitimate deals with Charlie Clark, Ace's banker.{\r}

1070
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:31,120
-你會盡力而為，不是嗎？ -是的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You will try to push it through, won't you? -Yes.{\r}

1071
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:33,410
你得了解我現在 給了你五萬元現金
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You got to understand, I'm giving you $50,000 cash.{\r}

1072
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:37,080
然后我將更多錢投入正當的投資 例如我開的餐館
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Then I put more money in some legitimate places, like my restaurant.{\r}

1073
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,800
-剩這個了？ -是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}DOMINICK: Is that the last one? COOK: Yeah.{\r}

1074
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:41,210
我讓我小弟，多明尼可經營
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it.{\r}

1075
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:44,800
王八蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuckers.{\r}

1076
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,150
在這里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}DOMINICK: Here you go, guys.{\r}

1077
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:53,480
-謝了 -慢慢享用
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Thanks a lot. -Enjoy it. Have a good time.{\r}

1078
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,690
-噎死你，王八蛋 -嗨，小多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Choke on it, motherfucker. -Hi, Dom.{\r}

1079
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,020
你怎么樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How you doing?{\r}

1080
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,980
是啊，尼奇很喜歡餐館 他對開餐廳也很拿手
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff.{\r}

1081
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,780
這么多年來，他逢開餐廳必賺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And over the years, he always made money with them.{\r}

1082
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,280
他在拉斯維加斯開了比薩斜塔 很受大家歡迎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower. It was a very popular spot.{\r}

1083
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:11,500
常有政客、脫衣舞娘 還有電影明星光顧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He had politicians, showgirls and movie stars hanging out all over.{\r}

1084
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,170
佛羅明哥的那場秀越做越好羅
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That show at The Flamingo gets better and better.{\r}

1085
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,550
對了，山姆說 請你有空時打個電話給他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call.{\r}

1086
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,550
-你也變傳話的了啊？ -有錢我什么都做啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Made you a messenger, too? -I'll do anything for a buck.{\r}

1087
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,060
-他對每個人都這樣，好好享用晚餐 -謝啦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner. -Thanks.{\r}

1088
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:27,890
尼奇最喜歡的 當然就是脫衣舞娘
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I got to tell you, the thing Nicky liked most was the showgirls.{\r}

1089
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,100
對她們來說，尼奇像是電影名星
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To them, Nicky was the movie star.{\r}

1090
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,030
-你就這樣走過？ -這是雪莉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You walk past me? -This is Shelly.{\r}

1091
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,160
-嗨，雪莉，你好嗎？ -嗨
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Hi, Shelly. How are you? -Hi.{\r}

1092
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:36,740
這是史黛希
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is Stacy.{\r}

1093
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,080
-這是尼克，想吃晚餐嗎？一起吧 -好啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-This is Nick. Wanna have dinner? Come on. -All right.{\r}

1094
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:42,700
我帶你去廚房看看 失陪一下
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let's check the kitchen first. Excuse us one second.{\r}

1095
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:46,330
來吧，我帶你去 我每天都空運新鮮的東西進來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Come on, I'll show you. I fly stuff in fresh every day.{\r}

1096
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,680
我從老家運面包 從加州運魚
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I get bread from back home. I get fish from California.{\r}

1097
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:53,340
光從我們用奶喂食的小牛肉就看得出 我們絕對是好餐廳
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal.{\r}

1098
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,310
這就是訣竅 奶喂小牛的肉是純白色的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's the secret. See, milk-fed veal is pure white.{\r}

1099
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:59,480
其他餐館都用那種粉紅色的小牛肉 過去點，甜心
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Out here, they got that pink veal. Slide over, honey.{\r}

1100
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:04,110
粉紅色的那種小牛肉 你就算是追個兩天兩夜
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now, pink veal you can pound for two days.{\r}

1101
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:06,780
它還是不會變嫩 你懂我的意思嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: It'll never ever get tender. You know what I mean?{\r}

1102
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:10,740
我從這兒拿錢離開時 在街上被搶了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AL: I left here with the money. Got muscled on the street.{\r}

1103
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,120
是幾個我欠錢的家伙 所以我把錢給他們了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A couple guys, I owe them. So I gave them the money.{\r}

1104
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,290
-就是這樣 -是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-That's what I did. -Yeah?{\r}

1105
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,340
你還敢自稱是男人嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You call yourself a man?{\r}

1106
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,800
你知道你是個撒謊的雜碎 他媽的爛賭的狗東西嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know you're a lying lowlife, motherfucking gambling degenerate prick?{\r}

1107
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,550
你知道自己是什么東西嗎？ 家里有兩個小孩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home.{\r}

1108
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,680
我給你錢付房租…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gave you money to pay the fucking rent...{\r}

1109
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:29,800
買菜、開暖氣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and buy groceries, put the heat on.{\r}

1110
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:33,440
你知道你老婆打給法蘭克 說家里連暖氣都被停了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fucking heat's off?{\r}

1111
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,980
你沒拿錢去賭嗎？ 你敢這樣跟我說嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You didn't gamble that money? Can you tell me that?{\r}

1112
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,700
-你沒有嗎？ -沒有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-No, you didn't? -I didn't.{\r}

1113
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:40,990
別耍我，艾爾！ 別把我當傻子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me.{\r}

1114
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,200
你當我是傻子是吧？ 你沒去賭？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You wanna make a fool out of me? You didn't gamble?{\r}

1115
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:48,870
告訴我你把錢拿去賭掉了 我就給你錢回去交電費！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tell me you gambled the money and I'll give you the money to put the heat on!{\r}

1116
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,990
有沒有賭？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Did you gamble?{\r}

1117
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,180
真是他媽的狗東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fucking degenerate, you.{\r}

1118
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,460
孩子在家里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fucking kids at home.{\r}

1119
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,350
拿去，給我滾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Here. Get the fuck out of here.{\r}

1120
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,980
-謝了，尼克 -是啊，謝了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AL: Thanks, Nick. NICKY: Yeah, thanks.{\r}

1121
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,980
若被我知道是你搞砸的 我會把你扔在我找到你的地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If I find out you fucked up, I'll leave you where I find you.{\r}

1122
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:14,360
-你要吃幾個？ -兩個
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: How many of these you gonna eat? NICKY JR.: Two.{\r}

1123
01:06:15,250 --> 01:06:18,030
但早上六點半，當他下班時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: At around 6:30 a.m., when he finished his day...{\r}

1124
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:20,320
不管他在那里或是在做什么…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}no matter where he was or what he was doing...{\r}

1125
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,540
他都會回家為兒子，小尼奇做早餐
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he always went home to make breakfast for his son, Nicky boy.{\r}

1126
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:25,200
我知道你喜歡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I know you like this.{\r}

1127
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:29,340
一點點牛油，對不對？ 不要很多，你知道為什么，對不對？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: A little butter, right? Not a lot. You know why, right?{\r}

1128
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:32,210
-為什么？ -因為會堵塞心臟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Why? NICKY JR.: 'Cause it clogs up your heart.{\r}

1129
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:35,100
你真是聰明的孩子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What a smart kid you are.{\r}

1130
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:37,060
快吃吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Okay, eat.{\r}

1131
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,310
每隔幾個禮拜我就會派瑪雷諾 去老大那兒…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Every couple of weeks, I sent Marino back to the bosses...{\r}

1132
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,700
也分他們一份
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}with a piece of what I made.{\r}

1133
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,320
當然不是很多，但他們哪知道？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Not a big piece, but what did they know?{\r}

1134
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:48,030
他們在2500里外，天高皇帝遠
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They were 1,500 miles away, and I don't know anybody who can see that far.{\r}

1135
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:50,360
收貨地點是個修車場…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Their drop was a truck stop garage...{\r}

1136
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,580
利蒙他們以前常在那兒數錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}where Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.{\r}

1137
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:57,590
條子們也知道，但他們不在乎 他們早協議好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The cops knew, but they didn't give a fuck. They worked it out.{\r}

1138
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,590
尼奇向你們問好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky sends his warmest regards.{\r}

1139
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:01,720
我知道怎樣讓老大們服服帖帖
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I knew how to keep the bosses happy.{\r}

1140
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,790
每當他們有些小事需要我做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,{\r}

1141
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:05,170
例如傳個話之類的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you know, to send a message...{\r}

1142
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:08,930
我一定做到完美
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I would carry things out to a "T."{\r}

1143
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:13,270
就像那次東尼道格 那個聽說是城里的新硬漢…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like the time Tony Dogs, who was supposed to be the new maniac tough guy in town...{\r}

1144
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,110
在利蒙的一家酒吧亂開槍
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}shot up one of Remo's bars.{\r}

1145
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,860
這渾蛋打死了兩個利蒙的手下…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Here's a fucking guy who kills two of Remo's guys...{\r}

1146
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,700
還有一個代班的倒霉女侍者
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and a poor fucking waitress who was just working on her night off.{\r}

1147
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,040
這家伙根本就 等著被我們殺雞儆猴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This guy's just begging to be made an example of.{\r}

1148
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:36,800
我要知道當天有誰跟他一起動手
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want the names of all the other people he had with him.{\r}

1149
01:07:36,930 --> 01:07:40,550
我要你不擇手段去查 懂不懂？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't care what you have to do to them to get them. You understand?{\r}

1150
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,840
我搞定，利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: I'll take care of it.{\r}

1151
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:46,020
說真的，我還蠻佩服這渾蛋的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: To be truthful with you, I had to admire this fucking guy.{\r}

1152
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:48,520
他真是我所遇過 最硬脖子的愛爾蘭人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.{\r}

1153
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:50,770
這家伙真是個硬漢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This son of a bitch was tough.{\r}

1154
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:54,740
我們痛毆了他兩天兩夜
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}For two days and two nights, we beat the shit out of him.{\r}

1155
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,870
還用冰銼刺他的睪丸
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We even stuck ice picks in his balls.{\r}

1156
01:07:57,120 --> 01:08:00,080
他最好快吐個名字出來 法蘭克，要不然我就遞你的上去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Hope he gives me a name, or I'll give him yours, Frank.{\r}

1157
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,240
謝謝喔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: Thanks a lot.{\r}

1158
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:02,410
但他守口如瓶
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: But he never talked.{\r}

1159
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:04,210
我知道你要供早就供了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I know you would've ratted by now.{\r}

1160
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:07,000
最后，我還得他媽的把他的頭 擺在夾板里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: In the end, I had to put his fucking head in a vice.{\r}

1161
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,550
你聽到了沒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Can you hear me?{\r}

1162
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:13,010
聽好，你的頭在夾板里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Listen to me. I got your head in a vice.{\r}

1163
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:17,220
再不給我個名字 我就夾爆你的頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll squash your head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name.{\r}

1164
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,680
別逼我這么做，拜托你快說吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Don't make me do this. Please, come on.{\r}

1165
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:21,940
別逼我當壞人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't make me be a bad guy.{\r}

1166
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,980
去你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck you.{\r}

1167
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,190
王八蛋，你相信嗎？ 他媽的兩天兩夜
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Motherfucker. You believe this? Two fucking days and nights.{\r}

1168
01:08:28,330 --> 01:08:31,280
去我的？你這個王八蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck me? You motherfucker!{\r}

1169
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,120
去我老母？ 你是這意思是吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck my mother? Is that what you're telling me?{\r}

1170
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:35,870
你這渾蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You motherfucker!{\r}

1171
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,340
天呀，給我一個名字！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, God. Give me the fucking name!{\r}

1172
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,840
查理
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Charlie M.{\r}

1173
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:44,510
-查理 -查理？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Charlie M. -Charlie M?{\r}

1174
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:47,520
你逼我將你眼珠都爆出來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You make me pop your eye out your head...{\r}

1175
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,430
就為了保護這狗屁名字？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to protect that piece of shit?{\r}

1176
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:52,480
王八蛋加蠢才！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You dumb motherfucker!{\r}

1177
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,270
殺了我啊，渾蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Kill me, you fuck!{\r}

1178
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,560
你這王八蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You motherfucker!{\r}

1179
01:08:57,070 --> 01:08:59,310
法蘭克，你幫幫他吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Frankie, do him a fucking favor.{\r}

1180
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,070
鎮上流傳著…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Word got around that finally...{\r}

1181
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:04,290
說這兒終于出了個真的幫派份子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}there was a real gangster in town.{\r}

1182
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,490
尼奇成了拉斯維加斯的新老大
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.{\r}

1183
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:17,210
四個輪，一排七個 三個一萬五的獎金
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Four reels, sevens across. Three $15,000 jackpots.{\r}

1184
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:19,260
你知道這機率是多少嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You have any idea what the odds are?{\r}

1185
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,300
要好幾百萬，可能更多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's gotta be in the millions. Maybe more.{\r}

1186
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,100
二十分鐘內三個大獎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Three jackpots in 20 minutes?{\r}

1187
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:25,800
你為什么沒停機？ 為什么沒通知我？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?{\r}

1188
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,570
發生得太快，一下就三個人贏 我還沒機會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It happened quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance.{\r}

1189
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:30,610
你沒看到出千嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You didn't see the scam?{\r}

1190
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,200
這無法確定
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's no way to determine that.{\r}

1191
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,440
有，絕對有 他們贏了就是最好的證據
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, there is. An infallible way. They won!{\r}

1192
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:37,250
這里是賭場，總會有人贏的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.{\r}

1193
01:09:37,910 --> 01:09:40,830
你氣死我了 你在污辱我的智慧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're pissing me off. You're insulting my intelligence.{\r}

1194
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,070
你認為我是白癡？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You think I'm an idiot?{\r}

1195
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:45,460
一定有人對轉輪動了手腳
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Somebody had to get into those machines and set the reels.{\r}

1196
01:09:45,590 --> 01:09:48,380
一臺機的機率是一百五十萬比一
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The probability on one machine is a million and a half to one.{\r}

1197
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:51,840
連續三臺的機率是好幾兆比一 這根本不可能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}On three machines in a row, it's in the billions. It can't happen.{\r}

1198
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,630
你到底是怎么了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What's the matter with you?{\r}

1199
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:57,020
你難道不知道你被騙了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?{\r}

1200
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,400
-你沒看到嗎？ -我覺得你有些反應過度
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You didn't see that? -I think you're overreacting.{\r}

1201
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,230
聽著，智障，我受夠你了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Listen, you yokel, I've had it with you.{\r}

1202
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:04,400
我從到這兒時就一直罩你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I've carried your ass ever since I got here.{\r}

1203
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:06,530
把東西收收走吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Get your things and get out of here.{\r}

1204
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,070
-你開除我？ -我就開除你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You're firing me? -I'm firing you.{\r}

1205
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:13,160
-你可能會后悔 -留你我一定后悔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You might regret this. -I'll regret it if I keep you.{\r}

1206
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:16,830
-不應該這樣對人 -若你不知道有人出千…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-This is not the way to treat people. -If you didn't know about the scam...{\r}

1207
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,720
你就蠢到不配在這兒工作 若你知道，你就是共犯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you're too dumb to work here. If you did, you were in on it.{\r}

1208
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,800
不管怎樣，你都得走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Either way, you're out. Go on.{\r}

1209
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,510
在我看來那家伙已經被炒了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The guy is history as far as I'm concerned.{\r}

1210
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,600
你不能開除他 他的姐夫是縣輔導
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can't fire him. His brother-in-law is County Commissioner.{\r}

1211
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:33,680
這里每個穿馬靴的不是輔導 就是輔導的親戚
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Everyone out here with cowboy boots is a commissioner or related to one.{\r}

1212
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,190
我受夠了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sick of this.{\r}

1213
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,440
這是他的州，他的叔叔是大法官
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge.{\r}

1214
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:39,940
他的姐夫管理縣委員會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}His brother-in-law runs the County Commission.{\r}

1215
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,990
一定有方法讓他回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's gotta be a way to work him back in.{\r}

1216
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,110
你是搞帳目的，在樓上 你看不到下面發生的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're in the finances, upstairs. You don't see what's going on.{\r}

1217
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:49,040
我有上千的賭客 卻只有五百個莊家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I've got thousands of players. I got 500 dealers.{\r}

1218
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:51,880
他們每天24小時都在想著 怎么將我搶空
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.{\r}

1219
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:55,210
我必須要讓他們知道 我隨時都在注意每個細節
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.{\r}

1220
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,970
我不會漏掉任何一樣事情
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That there is not one single thing I will not catch.{\r}

1221
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,890
看你的，看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Look at yours. Look at that.{\r}

1222
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:04,560
再看這個，什么都沒有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Look at this. There's nothing.{\r}

1223
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:06,650
你看你的藍莓那么多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look how many blueberries your muffin has.{\r}

1224
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:09,480
-我一個都沒有 -你在說什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I have nothing. -What are you talking about?{\r}

1225
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,320
自己不動手做就弄不好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you don't do it yourself, it never gets done.{\r}

1226
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:13,730
你要去哪兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PHILIP: Where are you going?{\r}

1227
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:19,570
從現在開始 我要你全都放同份量的藍莓
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: From now on, I want you to put an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.{\r}

1228
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,710
你知道那多花時間嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you know how long that will take?{\r}

1229
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,580
我不管要多久 每個松餅的份量都要一致
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't care how long it takes. Put an equal amount in each muffin.{\r}

1230
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:36,350
再吃一點，乖
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Just a little. That a girl.{\r}

1231
01:11:39,070 --> 01:11:41,060
-你要找媽媽？ -來媽媽這兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Wanna go to Mommy? GINGER: Wanna come to Mommy?{\r}

1232
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,980
好的，甜心
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's all right, sweetheart.{\r}

1233
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,400
我要跟你談談，我需要點錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I need to talk to you. I need some money.{\r}

1234
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:50,040
-你要什么？ -抱好了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What do you need? -Got her?{\r}

1235
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:54,570
我需要很多，比平時要多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I need a lot. I need more than usual.{\r}

1236
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,790
為什么不從你戶頭領呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why don't you take it out of your account?{\r}

1237
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,960
我本想，只是…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I would, it's just that...{\r}

1238
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,380
我需要更多，我要兩萬五
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I need more than that. I need $25,000.{\r}

1239
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,970
兩萬五千元？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$25,000?{\r}

1240
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,930
-你自己要？ -是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-For yourself? -Yeah.{\r}

1241
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:11,260
你為什么要那么多？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Why do you need that much?{\r}

1242
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,100
有什么差別？我需要就是了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What's the difference? I just need it.{\r}

1243
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:18,110
我一定得問啊 那很多錢耶，又不只是一盒爆米花
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. It's not a box of popcorn.{\r}

1244
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:20,820
我們不用將這變成件大事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We don't have to turn this into a big deal.{\r}

1245
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,580
我們不用吵架
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We don't have to have a fight.{\r}

1246
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,580
只是對我很重要，算了 有些想做的事罷了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: It was important to me. Forget it. Something I wanted to do.{\r}

1247
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:30,380
誰在吵架？ 告訴我錢的用處
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who's fighting? Tell me what it's for.{\r}

1248
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:34,920
為什么不能告訴我？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why can't you tell me what it's for?{\r}

1249
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:42,090
現在我要你告訴我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now I want you to tell me.{\r}

1250
01:12:42,230 --> 01:12:46,100
我老婆跑來問我要兩萬五 你想買大衣嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}My wife comes to me and asks me for $25,000. Do you want a coat?{\r}

1251
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:48,600
-不 -如果想買大衣，就去買啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: No. SAM: If you want a coat, you got it.{\r}

1252
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,310
不是錢的問題 只是，你為什么要？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's not the money. It's just, why do you want it?{\r}

1253
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:53,070
我無權過問嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Am I not entitled to ask that?{\r}

1254
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:56,730
我一輩子都很獨立 我從不為任何事求人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I've been independent all my life. I never had to ask anybody for anything.{\r}

1255
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,740
現在你要我求你是吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now you're making me beg you for this.{\r}

1256
01:12:59,330 --> 01:13:02,250
-你在說什么？ -好，你還羞辱我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What are you talking about? -Okay? And you're embarrassing me.{\r}

1257
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:05,170
-為什么得讓我如此難受？ -你問我要兩萬五
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why make me feel so bad? SAM: You're asking me for $25,000.{\r}

1258
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:08,670
我不是要讓你難堪 我只是希望能信任你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you.{\r}

1259
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,380
是信任問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's about trust.{\r}

1260
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:14,170
我必須要連性命都能交托于你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I have to be able to trust you with my life.{\r}

1261
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,770
你懂嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you understand?{\r}

1262
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,350
我能信任你嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can I trust you?{\r}

1263
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,610
我能嗎？告訴我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can I trust you? Answer me.{\r}

1264
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,490
你能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can trust me.{\r}

1265
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,200
好，那你就可以告訴我 錢要拿來干嘛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Good. So then you can tell me what the money is for.{\r}

1266
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,820
她現在正離開銀行
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She's leaving the bank now.{\r}

1267
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,320
我跟著她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll follow her.{\r}

1268
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,370
那是什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: What is that?{\r}

1269
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,700
我知道那神情，那表情是什么意思？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know that look. What does that look mean?{\r}

1270
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,290
意思是我有錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: It means I got the money.{\r}

1271
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,810
你好嗎？是萊斯特吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How are you doing? It's Lester, right?{\r}

1272
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:40,290
我記得你不是玩牌老手…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}From my recollection, aren't you the card shark...{\r}

1273
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,910
高爾夫球騙子 比佛利山莊的皮條客嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the golf hustler, the pimp from Beverly Hills?{\r}

1274
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:48,960
若記錯了，請糾正我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: If I'm wrong, correct me.{\r}

1275
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,960
我從不知道你也是個小偷
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I never knew you to be a heist man.{\r}

1276
01:14:51,890 --> 01:14:53,600
不過如果是的話，這樣吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But if you are, you know what?{\r}

1277
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:56,140
我的也拿去吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Here, take mine, too.{\r}

1278
01:14:56,980 --> 01:14:59,300
拿吧，反正你已拿了她的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Take it. You already have hers.{\r}

1279
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:01,690
她是我老婆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She's my wife.{\r}

1280
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,100
看著我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Look at me.{\r}

1281
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:06,910
你知道吧？ 你知道她是我老婆吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You did know that, didn't you? You knew she's my wife?{\r}

1282
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:10,780
-看著我 -我知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Look at me. LESTER: I know that.{\r}

1283
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:11,900
知道啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You do, yeah?{\r}

1284
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:16,920
你下次若再想回來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you ever come back again...{\r}

1285
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:21,090
拿她的錢，記得帶槍
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}to take her money, next time bring a pistol.{\r}

1286
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,840
這樣你才有機會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That way you got a chance.{\r}

1287
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,010
當個男人，別做皮條客
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Be a man, don't be a fucking pimp.{\r}

1288
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:29,760
現在，賣我個面子 快滾吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here.{\r}

1289
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:34,570
我想跟我老婆獨處 給我他媽的滾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I wanna be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.{\r}

1290
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:42,280
渾蛋狗雜種
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Fucking piece of shit.{\r}

1291
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:56,050
記得那晚你打電話跟他道別嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Remember when you called him that night and said goodbye to him?{\r}

1292
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:59,170
他并沒說：   “別結婚，我馬上來”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't say, "Don't get married. I'll be right down."{\r}

1293
01:15:59,310 --> 01:16:01,350
-他沒這樣說吧？ -不，沒有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He didn't say that, did he? -No, he didn't.{\r}

1294
01:16:01,430 --> 01:16:03,060
那他說了什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What did he say?{\r}

1295
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:09,020
“跟他睡，撈光他的錢”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got."{\r}

1296
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,110
過來，我給你看樣東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come here. I want to show you something.{\r}

1297
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,120
叫他們停！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Make them stop it!{\r}

1298
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:36,300
不是他的錯！是我的錯！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's not his fault! It's my fault!{\r}

1299
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,110
沒用的狗雜種
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}THUG: Piece of shit.{\r}

1300
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:02,460
自己來吧，你這沒膽的渾蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: Do it yourself, you chickenshit cocksucker!{\r}

1301
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:05,970
他太可惡了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's such a prick.{\r}

1302
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:08,460
他叫旅館的人揍他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He had some guy from the hotel beat him up.{\r}

1303
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:11,180
他自己不想動手
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't want to do it himself.{\r}

1304
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,720
他不想將手弄臟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't want to get his own hands dirty.{\r}

1305
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:18,030
他為什么要這樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why did he have to do that?{\r}

1306
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:19,850
告訴我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tell me.{\r}

1307
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:23,480
-那不是件好事… -廢話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: It wasn't a nice thing to do-- GINGER: No shit.{\r}

1308
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,500
你得了解，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta understand it.{\r}

1309
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:27,200
他并不知道這人 是不是在騙你的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down.{\r}

1310
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:32,370
我在結婚前就告訴過他這個人了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I told him all about this guy before we got married.{\r}

1311
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:35,540
-這并不是什么新鮮事 -是嗎？我并不知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-This is no fucking surprise. -You did? I didn't know that.{\r}

1312
01:17:36,220 --> 01:17:39,420
他只是我的朋友 我想要幫他，有什么大不了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help. So what?{\r}

1313
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:43,840
我第一次看到你們倆在一起時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The first time I ever saw you guys together...{\r}

1314
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:46,310
我從未見他那么快樂過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I never saw him so happy.{\r}

1315
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,810
我知道他是個猶太瘋子…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything...{\r}

1316
01:17:50,190 --> 01:17:53,650
但我從未見過他跟別人一起時這樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but I never seen him act like that with anybody else.{\r}

1317
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,780
他為你瘋狂 他真的很愛你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think he's crazy about you. He really loves you.{\r}

1318
01:17:57,870 --> 01:17:59,610
-他真的是 -拜托
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: He does. GINGER: Come on.{\r}

1319
01:17:59,910 --> 01:18:01,990
我是睜著雙眼走進這關系的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I went into this with my eyes open.{\r}

1320
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:04,330
我知道隨時都可能變卦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I knew the bottom could drop out any time.{\r}

1321
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:08,250
我也混過，你真以為 我在沒有保障的情況下…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm a working girl. You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this...{\r}

1322
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,630
會走這條路嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}if I don't think I'm covered on the back end?{\r}

1323
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,590
是啊，我可以了解
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sure, I can see that.{\r}

1324
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:16,930
他買了好多珠寶給我 好多好多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.{\r}

1325
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,060
很多貴重的珠寶？ 大概值多少？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?{\r}

1326
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:22,150
你想偷嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You want to steal it?{\r}

1327
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:26,520
不，只是好奇 我是在想…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No. I'm just curious. I was wondering...{\r}

1328
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:29,360
他會在那種東西里 投入多少錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}how much he would put into a thing like that.{\r}

1329
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:32,290
他跟我說大約一百萬 可能更多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm told it's worth about $1 million, maybe more.{\r}

1330
01:18:32,580 --> 01:18:34,790
那就是羅 這說明了什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: There you go. What does that tell you?{\r}

1331
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:36,290
一百萬的珠寶
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$1 million in jewelry.{\r}

1332
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:39,160
這不說明了他愛你愛到瘋了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Does that tell you he is crazy about you?{\r}

1333
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,010
我根本就不該嫁給他的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I should have never married him.{\r}

1334
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:45,050
他是雙子座的，雙子加三級，兩面人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's a Gemini. Triple Gemini. Duality.{\r}

1335
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,890
雙子座就像條蛇 你不能相信蛇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Gemini is the snake, you know. You can't trust a snake.{\r}

1336
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:52,550
我說真的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean it.{\r}

1337
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,890
我懂你的意思，金吉兒，聽著
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.{\r}

1338
01:18:56,490 --> 01:18:59,690
這可能不是… 我也沒有答案
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This is probably not.... I don't have the answers anyway.{\r}

1339
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,530
-這可能不是你想聽的 -我想
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-This is probably not what you want to hear. -I do.{\r}

1340
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:04,900
你不高興，我可以理解…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're a little upset, and I understand that.{\r}

1341
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:10,670
但先撐著點吧 慢慢來，看看會發生什么事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But try to make the best of it now. Go slow. See what happens.{\r}

1342
01:19:10,790 --> 01:19:12,170
他差點殺了他！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He could've killed him!{\r}

1343
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,970
他用不著打他 我又沒跟他上床
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't have to hit him. I'm not sleeping with the guy.{\r}

1344
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:19,260
他讓我得偷偷摸摸的 跟我的朋友見面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He makes me sneak around to see my own friends.{\r}

1345
01:19:19,350 --> 01:19:21,170
這算什么呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck is that all about?{\r}

1346
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:25,090
我想是因為他太愛你了吧 他吃醋又擔心
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much, he's jealous and worries.{\r}

1347
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:27,690
誰會在乎我做什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who gives a fuck what I do?{\r}

1348
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,690
我會試著問問到底怎樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll try to find out what the hell is going on.{\r}

1349
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,940
-遇到他時我會跟他談談的 -好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-When I see him, I'll talk to him. -Okay.{\r}

1350
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:36,200
-可以嗎？ -好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-All right? -Yeah.{\r}

1351
01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:38,790
謝了…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks...{\r}

1352
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:41,280
忍受我嘮叨
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}for putting up with me.{\r}

1353
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:45,000
別喝這么兇吧 這只會讓情況更糟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Take it easy with this shit. This can only make matters worse.{\r}

1354
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:47,040
你是個美女，別搞砸了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're a beautiful girl. Don't ruin that.{\r}

1355
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:50,010
我看過太多漂亮女孩 因這個變丑八怪
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.{\r}

1356
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:52,260
你真好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're so nice.{\r}

1357
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,390
好了啦 我不想見你不快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, now. I don't wanna see you unhappy.{\r}

1358
01:19:58,600 --> 01:19:59,800
謝了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks.{\r}

1359
01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:06,070
沒事啦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's all right.{\r}

1360
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:22,130
縣輔導派特委布來見你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.{\r}

1361
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:24,880
-等一下 -好的，請稍候
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Give me a minute. -Okay. Just a minute.{\r}

1362
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:44,530
你需要什么嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}RECEPTIONIST: Can I get you anything?{\r}

1363
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,990
不，謝謝，小姐
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, thank you, little lady.{\r}

1364
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:49,540
讓他進來，然后四分鐘后打給我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Send him in and call me four minutes after.{\r}

1365
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,090
羅斯坦先生，我是派特委布
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.{\r}

1366
01:20:53,420 --> 01:20:54,420
你好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How do you do?{\r}

1367
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,550
-幸會 -我常聽起你的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-It is a pleasure. -I heard a lot about you.{\r}

1368
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:59,550
過獎了，莊家最近還過得去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PAT: Thank you, sir. House is doing well.{\r}

1369
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:02,470
那么多錢滾滾而來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All that money is rolling in.{\r}

1370
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,600
我很感激你愿意見我這老公仆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I appreciate you taking the time to see a poor old civil servant.{\r}

1371
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:08,060
-不如坐下吧？ -謝謝您
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Why don't you have a seat? PAT: Thank you, sir.{\r}

1372
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:12,440
我是來親自化解…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PAT: I come here personally to smooth over...{\r}

1373
01:21:12,530 --> 01:21:14,490
一些小誤會的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}any fracas about a certain matter.{\r}

1374
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,910
你可能不知道…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe you didn't know it...{\r}

1375
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:20,110
但道恩華德在鎮上挺受歡迎的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town.{\r}

1376
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:24,740
他有許多朋友 他們家族及產業也很久了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's got lots of friends. His family and their money go back many years.{\r}

1377
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,750
朋友是選民 家人與金錢都能助選
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Friends vote, family and money votes.{\r}

1378
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,920
這對你我都很重要
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's important to me and you.{\r}

1379
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:36,050
若你從這個角度 來看我們這個小問題的話…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you'll think about our little problem along them lines...{\r}

1380
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,970
很抱歉我得這么說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and you'll forgive me for saying it...{\r}

1381
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:41,430
但他可能不該被開除
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}maybe he did not deserve to be fired.{\r}

1382
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,640
他非常清楚我們…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He knew about our getting hit...{\r}

1383
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:47,860
在一瞬間被贏了三個大獎 但他卻袖手旁觀
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}on three big machines in a row, and he did nothing about it.{\r}

1384
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:51,860
他要不是跟他們一伙 那很抱歉，他就是蠢到看不見
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Either he was in on it or, forgive me, he was too dumb to see it.{\r}

1385
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,500
不論如何，我都無法讓一個 這樣的人在這兒工作
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Either way, I cannot have a man like that working here.{\r}

1386
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:57,780
在將過錯都推給道恩前…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Before we point the dirty end of the stick at old Don...{\r}

1387
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,250
我們得先確定有證據這樣指控他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}we better be sure we can prove them charges.{\r}

1388
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,590
相信我，要是有證據 他早就被逮捕了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Believe me, if I could prove it, he'd be under arrest.{\r}

1389
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:10,640
你確定要讓賭博游樂委員會…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Are we certain that you want the Gaming Control Board...{\r}

1390
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:14,180
過目你與你的幫派朋友 尼奇的記錄嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky?{\r}

1391
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,890
我覺得你這樣跟我說 有點太過份了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think you're way out of line talking to me like that.{\r}

1392
01:22:17,030 --> 01:22:21,320
你所說的幾乎是毀謗 你無權懷疑我的專業
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What you're saying is libelous. You're in no position to challenge my expertise.{\r}

1393
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,860
我已盡我所能去 幫助并善待那孩子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I went way out of my way to be helpful and courteous to that kid.{\r}

1394
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,410
他太弱了也很無能 他使這地方瀕于險境
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's weak. He's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place.{\r}

1395
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:30,580
我對他真的無能為力
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's not much more I can do for him.{\r}

1396
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:31,960
這倒是真的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You have got me there.{\r}

1397
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:36,800
道恩就像公豬身上的奶頭一樣無用
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.{\r}

1398
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:40,000
但他還是我的小舅子…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But he is my brother-in-law...{\r}

1399
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:43,430
我會當是我欠你的一個人情
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and I would look on it as a personal favor...{\r}

1400
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,770
若你愿意考慮重新聘用他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}if you'd think some more on hiring him back.{\r}

1401
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:47,890
我不能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't do that.{\r}

1402
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:51,470
我知道他是你的小舅子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in-law.{\r}

1403
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,850
我也想幫你更喜歡賣人情
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I do want to help you and I like to do favors.{\r}

1404
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,230
我也知道你的地位 但我真的不能這么做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And I know who you are. But I cannot do that.{\r}

1405
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,620
日后是否會有其它較適合的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Could there be any position...{\r}

1406
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,040
職位呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}farther down the trough?{\r}

1407
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:08,290
抱歉，并沒有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm sorry. I can't do anything.{\r}

1408
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:11,540
他太無能了 最終還是他不能被信任
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's too incompetent. The bottom line is he cannot be trusted.{\r}

1409
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:16,340
好吧，謝謝
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Okay, thanks a lot.{\r}

1410
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,140
抱歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's it. I'm sorry.{\r}

1411
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,350
羅斯坦先生 你們這幫人永遠都不會懂…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Rothstein, your people never will understand...{\r}

1412
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:27,560
這里的世界如何運作
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the way it works out here.{\r}

1413
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,320
你們只不過來此地做客
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're all just our guests.{\r}

1414
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:33,040
但卻喧寶奪主
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But you act like you're at home.{\r}

1415
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:36,370
讓我告訴你，老兄 這并不是你家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let me tell you something, partner. You ain't home.{\r}

1416
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,460
家是我們州長生氣時 送你們回的地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But that's where we'll send you if it harelips the Governor.{\r}

1417
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,600
-多謝你空出時間見我 -沒問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Thank you for your time. -No problem.{\r}

1418
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,600
-對不起 -當然
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Sorry. -You bet.{\r}

1419
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:56,270
我的藥呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What happened to my pills?{\r}

1420
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:02,270
你喝那么多酒還不夠嗎？ 你還要吃我的藥？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Isn't it bad enough you drink too much? You're taking my pills, too?{\r}

1421
01:24:02,490 --> 01:24:03,950
我沒吃你的藥
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I didn't take your pills.{\r}

1422
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,240
我因為胃潰瘍，才吃半顆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}For my ulcer, I take a half of one of these.{\r}

1423
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:09,790
而且是痛到無法忍時才吃
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's when I have extreme pain.{\r}

1424
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,620
我本來有三個月份的 你弄到哪里去了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had a three-month supply. What did you do with them?{\r}

1425
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,300
你用不著打他的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: [Crying] You didn't have to beat him up.{\r}

1426
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:16,960
什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What?{\r}

1427
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,630
我只是想幫他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I was just trying to help him.{\r}

1428
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,430
好像我跟他上床似的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Like I'm sleeping with the guy.{\r}

1429
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,020
是嗎，我哪知道？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, how do I know?{\r}

1430
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:29,190
你不能讓我完全不關心別人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: You can't make me stop caring about people.{\r}

1431
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,560
-什么？ -我說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What? GINGER: I said...{\r}

1432
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:36,490
你不能讓我完全不關心別人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you can't make me stop caring about people.{\r}

1433
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,030
聽著…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Listen...{\r}

1434
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:49,920
我只想讓一切比較好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying to make the best of everything here.{\r}

1435
01:24:50,010 --> 01:24:52,170
老天啊，你是我老婆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, you're my wife, for Christ's sakes.{\r}

1436
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,760
鎮上的人都很看重你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}People look up to you in this town.{\r}

1437
01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:59,300
你知道嗎，艾斯？ 那關我屁事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit.{\r}

1438
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,940
我要離開
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm getting out of here.{\r}

1439
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,530
你冷靜一點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You gotta get a hold of yourself.{\r}

1440
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:12,620
-好 -不為我，也為艾美
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Okay. SAM: If not for me, at least for Amy.{\r}

1441
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:16,370
懂嗎，你酒喝得太過份了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Understand? Your drinking's getting way out of hand.{\r}

1442
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:19,660
我幫你安排去做治療 這兒有很多好療養所
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.{\r}

1443
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:23,510
-我不需要 -你需要，那很隱密的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I don't need one. -Yes, you do. It's very discreet.{\r}

1444
01:25:23,630 --> 01:25:25,710
姓名也不會被公布
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's no names in the papers.{\r}

1445
01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:27,390
你只在乎名譽
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's all you care about.{\r}

1446
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:30,970
你不在乎我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: You don't care about me.{\r}

1447
01:25:31,100 --> 01:25:33,060
-我在乎 -不，你不在乎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Yes, I do. GINGER: No, you don't.{\r}

1448
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:34,390
你怎能這樣說？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How could you say that?{\r}

1449
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:37,140
你是個美麗的女人 你在摧殘自己
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself.{\r}

1450
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:40,940
你不需要那些 你現在芒刺在背
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You don't need that stuff, that fucking leech living off you.{\r}

1451
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:43,320
我比你還要了解你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know you better than you know yourself.{\r}

1452
01:25:43,450 --> 01:25:45,660
你像只老虎，你比我還堅強
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're a tiger. You're stronger than I am.{\r}

1453
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:49,700
只要你下定決心的事 你就做得比任何人都要好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.{\r}

1454
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:55,790
你一定得去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're gonna do it.{\r}

1455
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:57,880
天啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, God.{\r}

1456
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,140
我試
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll try.{\r}

1457
01:26:13,150 --> 01:26:14,350
我會的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I will.{\r}

1458
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,530
別生我氣，好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't be mad at me, okay?{\r}

1459
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:32,430
不管在計算室外有多少問題…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: No matter what the problems were outside the count room...{\r}

1460
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:34,640
都是值得的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}it was all worth it.{\r}

1461
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:37,270
現金滾滾而來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The cash kept rolling in...{\r}

1462
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,400
皮箱也不停的進出
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and the suitcases kept coming and going.{\r}

1463
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:45,730
讓我告訴你 除了錢還是錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And let me tell you, the fucking bottom line here is cash.{\r}

1464
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:49,910
唯一的問題是過了一陣子后…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The only problem was that after a while...{\r}

1465
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:53,570
老大們發覺皮箱越來越輕
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.{\r}

1466
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:57,290
等一下，你是說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Wait a minute. You mean to tell me...{\r}

1467
01:26:57,380 --> 01:26:59,830
我們搶的錢被人搶？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that the money we're robbing is being robbed?{\r}

1468
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,840
有人搶我們？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Somebody's robbing from us?{\r}

1469
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,130
我們這么大費周章 竟有人在搶我們？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We go through all this fucking trouble and somebody's robbing us?{\r}

1470
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,010
如我所說，這就是這行的一部分 就當做是遺漏的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Like I said, it's part of the business. It's considered leakage.{\r}

1471
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,470
遺漏，狗屁 我要找到搶我們的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Leakage, my balls. I want the guy who's robbing us.{\r}

1472
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,270
就連約翰南斯 主導這騙局的人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the scam...{\r}

1473
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,440
都知道自己無能為力去阻止
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he knew there wasn't much he could do about it.{\r}

1474
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:19,850
你得知道一個肯幫你偷錢的人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal...{\r}

1475
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:22,100
就算你把他照顧得好好的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}even if you take care of him real well...{\r}

1476
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:24,480
他還是為自己多偷一點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he's gonna steal a little extra for himself.{\r}

1477
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:26,730
很合理不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Makes sense, don't it? Right?{\r}

1478
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,400
試著讓這些固執的老頭們了解吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that.{\r}

1479
01:27:30,580 --> 01:27:32,870
如果自己抽完還要被別人抽 還有什么意義？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed?{\r}

1480
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,570
這樣我們根本就在做白工嘛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It defeats the whole purpose of what we're doing.{\r}

1481
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:38,740
他們是我的手下才幫我們拿錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They take this money because they're my guys,{\r}

1482
01:27:38,740 --> 01:27:40,340
就睜只眼閉只眼吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}so give them some leeway.{\r}

1483
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:43,040
但老大們從來就不相信這理論…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: But the bosses never believed in leeway...{\r}

1484
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:44,720
聽聽他們做了什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}so listen to what they do.{\r}

1485
01:27:44,850 --> 01:27:47,720
他們將艾題派斯康 堪薩斯市的二佬…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They put Artie Piscano, the underboss of K. C...{\r}

1486
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:51,310
調來管理 確定沒有人抽頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim.{\r}

1487
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:53,890
-你那時在干嘛？ -我與我馬子一起
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BOSS: What were you doing? I was with my cumari.{\r}

1488
01:27:53,980 --> 01:27:57,180
-你跟你馬子那時在干嘛？ -我打她一巴掌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BOSS: What were you doing with your cumari? I gave her a schiaffo.{\r}

1489
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,860
問題是，派斯康是個麻煩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster.{\r}

1490
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,060
這家伙連泡咖啡都可搞砸
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee.{\r}

1491
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,230
-你都在干嘛？ -我在那兒的時間比在這兒多
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BOSS: What you been doing? ARTIE: I'm out there more than I'm here.{\r}

1492
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,740
當時沒人想到 后來會演變為何
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Little did anybody know where this would lead.{\r}

1493
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:11,290
若有人早知道 去做念珠可能都還好些
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If they did, they would've been better off making fucking novenas.{\r}

1494
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,740
你得回去跟那家伙講
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta go back there and talk to that guy.{\r}

1495
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,710
-我上次的花費都還沒補給我 -什么花費？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-My expenses weren't paid for the last trip. -What expenses?{\r}

1496
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,750
我一直自掏腰包 卻什么都拿不回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm laying money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back.{\r}

1497
01:28:20,890 --> 01:28:22,340
你得再回去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta go back out there.{\r}

1498
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,970
從今開始 我得開始做記錄了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}From now on, I'm gonna start keeping records.{\r}

1499
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:28,380
你要記錄干嘛，繳稅嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are you gonna do with records, pay taxes?{\r}

1500
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,970
我不能一直這樣自己出錢 跑來跑去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.{\r}

1501
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:34,140
我們他媽的到底在那兒干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the hell are we doing over here?{\r}

1502
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:37,190
我花錢讓你去賭城玩
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're going to Las Vegas and having a good time at my expense.{\r}

1503
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,190
我靠，我是說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck? I mean, after all....{\r}

1504
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,310
不論你做了幾符念珠…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: No matter how many novenas you could make...{\r}

1505
01:28:41,410 --> 01:28:44,110
都無法阻止接下來 在賭場發生的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}nothing was gonna stop what came up next at the casino.{\r}

1506
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:46,660
-我不相信你會這樣做 -我們有協議
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PHILIP: I can't believe you're doing this. ANNA: We made a deal.{\r}

1507
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:49,900
結果菲立浦葛林，   “老實先生”…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It turned out Phil Green, "Mr. Integrity"...{\r}

1508
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,740
有個沒人知道的搭擋…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}had a partner nobody knew about...{\r}

1509
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:55,040
當她出現并向坦吉樂要錢時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and when she showed up and demanded money from Tangiers...{\r}

1510
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:57,710
-你為什么這樣對我？ -因為你錯了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Why are you doing this to me? -Because you're wrong.{\r}

1511
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,170
-我沒錯 -你有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANNA: I'm not. PHILIP: You are.{\r}

1512
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,510
不，我沒錯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, I am not wrong.{\r}

1513
01:29:00,590 --> 01:29:02,250
葛林試著搪塞她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...Green tried to stonewall her.{\r}

1514
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:04,880
我不會這么輕易的放過你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANNA: I will see that you don't get away with this.{\r}

1515
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,720
所以她一狀告到法庭去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So, she sued him in court.{\r}

1516
01:29:06,850 --> 01:29:09,470
本庭現在將開始審理 安娜史考特…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The court will now hear the matter of Anna Scott...{\r}

1517
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:13,100
對坦吉樂集團與其總裁 菲立浦葛林
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}against Tangiers Corporation and its President, Philip Green.{\r}

1518
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:15,120
-葛林先生將由歐伯倫辯護
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}OBERON: Oberon on behalf of Mr. Green.{\r}

1519
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,060
-安娜史考特的律師則是羅根
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LOGAN: Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.{\r}

1520
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,610
-歐伯倫先生，可以開始了 -謝謝，大人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}JUDGE: Mr. Oberon, you can proceed. OBERON: Thank you.{\r}

1521
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:23,660
我覺得判決很公正 而我也對判決非常滿意
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I believe he was fair, and I'm delighted with the decision.{\r}

1522
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,070
有麻煩了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We got a problem.{\r}

1523
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,670
官司結果不理想，葛林得呈交帳簿…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It didn't go too well. Green has to open up the books...{\r}

1524
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,170
他得解釋錢是怎么來的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}has to show how he got the financing.{\r}

1525
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:36,210
這可不好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's not good.{\r}

1526
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:42,010
她官司還打得不錯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: She was doing pretty good with her lawsuit.{\r}

1527
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:44,180
但在鈔票還未落入她口袋之前…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But before she could start counting her money...{\r}

1528
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:47,510
老家的老頭子們就已決定庭外和解
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.{\r}

1529
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:48,840
因此他們派我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So they sent me.{\r}

1530
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:07,540
你對安娜史考特的謀殺 有什么想法嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REPORTER: Any comment on the murder of Anna Scott?{\r}

1531
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:11,200
-你在說什么？ -她昨晚被人發現中彈身亡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are you talking about? REPORTER: She was found last night shot in the head.{\r}

1532
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,120
只是有關房地產合伙問題嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Was this just a real estate partnership?{\r}

1533
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:15,050
她的律師說你們是搭擋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN 2: Her lawyer said you were partners.{\r}

1534
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,380
我們是在多年前 在一些小房地產交易上合作過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.{\r}

1535
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,800
稱不上是搭擋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It was never a partnership.{\r}

1536
01:30:22,270 --> 01:30:25,100
你聽過.22口徑殺手嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Did you ever hear of the.22 caliber killer?{\r}

1537
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:27,890
現在條子不只是盯尼奇…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Now, Instead of the cops only looking at Nicky...{\r}

1538
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,890
他們也開始盯葛林
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they started looking at Green, too.{\r}

1539
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:32,600
他本是我們的正派門面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And he was supposed to be our squeaky-clean front man.{\r}

1540
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:35,860
我得接受訪問 讓大家都知道…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had to start giving interviews to make sure everybody knew...{\r}

1541
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:37,520
賭場沒有牽涉到案子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the casino was on the up-and-up.{\r}

1542
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:39,900
你多常幫他代班？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So how often do you really fill in for him?{\r}

1543
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:45,740
葛林一個月大約來個兩、三次…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Green's here about two or three times a month...{\r}

1544
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,870
他還有其他房地產交易 和別的事要忙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and he's busy with other real estate deals, and things.{\r}

1545
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:51,790
所以葛林不在時 你就是老大羅？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So in Green's absence, then, you're the boss?{\r}

1546
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,470
我很榮幸能為董事會的主席服務
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I serve at the pleasure of the Chairman of the Board.{\r}

1547
01:30:56,470 --> 01:31:00,300
我的責任是管理賭場的日常運作
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}My responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.{\r}

1548
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,390
所以平常日子你就是老大？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?{\r}

1549
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,010
可以這么說吧…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Well, in a sense, you could say that I am the boss...{\r}

1550
01:31:07,150 --> 01:31:09,110
當葛林先生不在時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}when Mr. Green is away.{\r}

1551
01:31:11,740 --> 01:31:12,930
可以這么說
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You could say that.{\r}

1552
01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:13,770
山姆羅斯坦：   “我是老大！”

1553

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think I want my money back.{\r}

1601
01:34:03,670 --> 01:34:05,660

1602
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:10,130
我想你可能誤解我了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think you've gotten the wrong impression about me.{\r}

1603
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:13,130
我覺得為公平起見…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think, in all fairness...{\r}

1604
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:16,010
我應該告訴你我打算怎么做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I should explain to you exactly what it is that I do.{\r}

1605
01:34:17,190 --> 01:34:21,350
明天一大早我就會散步去銀行…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk to the bank...{\r}

1606
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:25,530
走進去看看 若還沒把我的錢準備好的話…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and walk in and see, and if you don't have my money for me...{\r}

1607
01:34:25,650 --> 01:34:29,110
我就會在眾人面前爆開你的頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll crack your fucking head wide open in front of everybody.{\r}

1608
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,490
而當我服完刑出獄時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And just about the time that I'm coming out of jail...{\r}

1609
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,200
希望你也能從昏迷中蘇醒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.{\r}

1610
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,500
知道嗎？ 我會再爆開你的頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And guess what? I'll split your fucking head open again.{\r}

1611
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,130

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}'Cause I'm fucking stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.{\r}

1612

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We know what you do.{\r}

1614
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:52,340
你把人的錢騙走 然后大搖大擺的走開
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You fuck people out of money and get away with it.{\r}

1615
01:34:52,430 --> 01:34:54,920
-你不能這樣對我說話 -你這只愛爾蘭肥豬！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can't talk to me like that. NICKY: You fat Irish prick!{\r}

1616
01:34:55,060 --> 01:34:58,230
你害我領不到我的錢 你最好把它弄出來，不然我要你好看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You put my money to sleep. Get it, or I'll put your brain to sleep.{\r}

1617
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,730
山姆別看，這是我們的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Never mind Sam. This is personal.{\r}

1618
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,610

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll be there in the morning. You can try me, fatso.{\r}

1619
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:09,280

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You think he got the point? -What are you doing?{\r}

1620
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:13,280
他是個老實的生意人 他會去找聯盟調查局的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's a square guy, for Christ's sakes. He's gonna run to the FBI.{\r}

1621
01:35:13,410 --> 01:35:16,280
這渾蛋躲了我三個禮拜了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That prick's been dodging me for three weeks.{\r}

1622
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,650
-你在告訴我該怎么做嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You're trying to tell me what to do?{\r}

1623
01:35:18,650 --> 01:35:20,420
-我沒有要告訴你該怎么做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'm not trying to tell you what to do.{\r}

1624
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:22,830
你太過份了，你的腦哪里去了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're way out of line. Where's your head?{\r}

1625
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:25,050
我的腦？ 你的種又去了哪兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where's my head? Where's your fucking balls?{\r}

1626
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:29,710
我有更大的計劃 你知道我在說什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm trying to put something big together. You know what I'm talking about.{\r}

1627
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:33,220
如果你現在就這個樣 我還怎么指望你啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you're acting like this now, how can I depend on you?{\r}

1628
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:36,180
很多事都要改變了 你若要跟我一起…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A lot of things gonna change. If you wanna be there with me...{\r}

1629
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:38,230
你就得聽我的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you're gonna have to go my way.{\r}

1630
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,890
你得體諒我的處境 我得對上千名員工負責
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You got to understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people.{\r}

1631
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:44,230
我每年都得經手一億元
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I got $100 million a year going through the place.{\r}

1632
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:47,530
我若拿不到執照就玩完了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's all over if I don't get that license.{\r}

1633
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:51,370
相信我，我若玩完了 很多人就會跟著完蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.{\r}

1634
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,160
去他媽的什么爛執照
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Forget about your fucking license.{\r}

1635
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:56,290
到時候我說的就是法律 你根本不需要什么執照
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I plant my own flag out here, you ain't gonna need a license.{\r}

1636
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,300
我不知道為什么 但越和你說話…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't know what it is, but the more I talk to you...{\r}

1637
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:04,290
我越覺得你不會挺我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the more I feel like you just don't want to go along with me.{\r}

1638
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:07,300
-不，我不打算和你一起 -好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-No, I don't want to come along with you. -All right.{\r}

1639
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:10,590
我不想涉入你所說的任何事，好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't want to be involved in anything you're talking about, okay?{\r}

1640
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,060
我只想好好經營賭場 我只要我的執照
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want to run a square joint. I just want my license.{\r}

1641
01:36:13,150 --> 01:36:15,180
我只想一切都安靜下來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want everything quiet. That's it!{\r}

1642
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:17,520
這樣叫安靜？ “我是老大”這樣叫安靜？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Quiet like this? "I'm the boss"? That's quiet?{\r}

1643
01:36:17,650 --> 01:36:19,640
他們扭曲了意思 我根本控制不了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's taken out of context. I had no control.{\r}

1644
01:36:19,780 --> 01:36:22,230
羅尼與比利可以告訴你整個經過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ronnie and Billy will tell you exactly what happened.{\r}

1645
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,110
這在老家很難看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Back home that looks bad.{\r}

1646
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,920
難看？每次只要你上電視 就會提到我，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Looks bad? Every time you're on television, I get mentioned.{\r}

1647
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:28,950
這才叫難看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That looks bad.{\r}

1648
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:31,080
你到底怎么了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck happened to you?{\r}

1649
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,880
-你怎么了？整個失控？ -我失控？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What happened to you? You lost control? -I lost control?{\r}

1650
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,490
你他媽的像個電影明星似的走來走去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're fucking walking around like John Barrymore.{\r}

1651
01:36:36,630 --> 01:36:41,510
穿粉紅色的浴袍還拿煙盒？ 是我失控？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A pink robe and a fucking cigarette holder? I lost control?{\r}

1652
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:46,470
我本來不想提的，但你不尊重人 連你老婆都不例外
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't wanna bring this up, but you treat people with disrespect. Even your own wife.{\r}

1653
01:36:47,220 --> 01:36:49,600
我老婆？關她什么事？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}My wife? What does she have to do with this?{\r}

1654
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:54,550
她為了許多事不高興 尤其是萊斯特戴蒙德那檔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She was upset about a lot of things, especially that Lester Diamond incident.{\r}

1655
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:58,900
你是她哭訴的對象？ 你沒告訴她那事你也有份？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're the shoulder to cry on? Did you tell her about your role in that?{\r}

1656
01:36:59,030 --> 01:37:01,320
沒有，那不是重點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, that's not the fucking point.{\r}

1657
01:37:01,450 --> 01:37:04,400
重點是，她不快樂 你也有問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The point is, she's upset, and you've got a problem.{\r}

1658
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:07,110
我希望你不要干涉 我的私生活
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life.{\r}

1659
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:09,240
若我這樣你也會不爽吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.{\r}

1660
01:37:09,370 --> 01:37:12,870
她來找我說話的 我該趕她出去嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She came to talk to me. Was I supposed to throw her out?{\r}

1661
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,330
離她遠一點 不關你的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Stay away from her. It's none of your business.{\r}

1662
01:37:16,420 --> 01:37:21,330
一周前就是我的事，現在就不是 你需要我時，我就得到
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A week ago it was. Now it's not. When you need me, you need me.{\r}

1663
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:24,550
是啊，就像你需要我 幫你做擔保一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.{\r}

1664
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:27,510
我得去解決你剛剛對那人 所做的事情
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did with this guy.{\r}

1665
01:37:27,640 --> 01:37:29,350
他會去找聯邦調查局的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This guy's gonna run to the FBl.{\r}

1666
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:32,100
你的自尊比你的賭場還大 這就是你的問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Your head's bigger than your casino. That's your problem.{\r}

1667
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:35,030
我知道他想做什么，但我不想參與
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I knew what he wanted and I didn't want any part of it.{\r}

1668
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:36,610
尼奇想自個兒當老大
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He wanted to take over.{\r}

1669
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:41,610
他想干掉蓋吉 抽頭，還有一切
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He wanted to go after Gaggi, the skim, everything and everybody.{\r}

1670
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:45,280
他不再每件小事都要老家批準
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He also stopped asking permission from back home for every little thing.{\r}

1671
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:53,990
一位賭場大亨與他老婆被殺了 調查員偵問了尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A casino boss and his wife were killed. The bulls questioned Nicky.{\r}

1672
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:58,210
一位西洛可的莊家 他們也詢問尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A dealer from the Scirocco. They questioned Nicky.{\r}

1673
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:01,000
幾個線民死在自己的后車箱里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Stool pigeons wound up in the trunks of their cars.{\r}

1674
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:02,340
他們也追問尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They questioned Nicky.{\r}

1675
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:03,590
一個律師
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A lawyer.{\r}

1676
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:08,130
他們問尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They questioned Nicky.{\r}

1677
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:11,350
當一些拖欠高利貸的人 莫名的開始消失…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When some guys who didn't pay their shylocks began disappearing...{\r}

1678
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:14,320
尼奇的名字布滿每家報紙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky's name was in every newspaper.{\r}

1679
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:18,280
尼奇因為一堆謀殺案調查被偵訊 但他們每次都放他走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go.{\r}

1680
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:19,690
從來沒有目擊者
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There were never any witnesses.{\r}

1681
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:24,240
條子把所有的不順 都歸昝于我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong.{\r}

1682
01:38:24,370 --> 01:38:26,080
小心點 你會好看的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Watch yourself. You're gonna get runned over.{\r}

1683
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:30,000
若有個家伙踩到香蕉皮跌倒 可能都要帶我回局里
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: If a guy tripped over a banana peel, they'd bring me in for it.{\r}

1684
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:32,250
客氣點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Be nice.{\r}

1685
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:36,500
老大們也沒好到哪兒去 他們抱怨事情運作不順
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: The bosses were no better. They complained because things don't run smooth.{\r}

1686
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:39,840
不過在我這行 真抱歉，事情本來就不會順
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In my line of work, things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.{\r}

1687
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:42,260
我每天對付的可是些三教九流之徒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm dealing with degenerate animals out here.{\r}

1688
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:44,390
老大們在乎個屁啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The bosses, what do they give a fuck?{\r}

1689
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:46,680
他們只會坐著喝酒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're sitting on their asses drinking anisette.{\r}

1690
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:49,020
而這期間我得做牛做馬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.{\r}

1691
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:51,850
那些王八老大們 真以為天下的午餐都是免費的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fucking bosses think it's a fucking free lunch out here.{\r}

1692
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:56,820
法蘭克，他們在沙漠里 找到一個家伙的頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Frankie, they found a guy's head in the desert.{\r}

1693
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:59,650
你知道嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know about that?{\r}

1694
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:01,280
聽說了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I heard.{\r}

1695
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:05,830
大家都在講，報紙里也有登
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Everybody's talking about it and making a big deal out of it. It's in all the papers.{\r}

1696
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:07,200
你要怎么辦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are you gonna do?{\r}

1697
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:09,210
這可不好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's no good.{\r}

1698
01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:13,870
叫他做事要小心點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tell him to take care of things a little better.{\r}

1699
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,210
我會的，利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll tell him, Remo.{\r}

1700
01:39:16,340 --> 01:39:19,090
王八老大們抽著雪茄
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Fucking bosses smoking their Di Nobilis...{\r}

1701
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:22,380
吃著他們的美食…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and eating trip' and fucking soffrit', fried pigs' guts...{\r}

1702
01:39:22,520 --> 01:39:25,890
而我若想私下找人談話 我還得坐在公車站
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}while if I wanna talk private, I gotta go to a fucking bus stop.{\r}

1703
01:39:26,020 --> 01:39:30,350
-他們在乎個屁？只要我拿錢回去 -他們在抱怨了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What do they care? Long as I send money. -They're complaining.{\r}

1704
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,520
讓他們抱怨，是我在這兒 活都是我在做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let them complain. I'm the one who's here. I do all the work.{\r}

1705
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,770
-有人不喜歡，就去他的 -你決定羅
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Somebody don't like it, fuck them. FRANK: It's up to you.{\r}

1706
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:40,650
他們他媽的想打仗？ 我準備好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: They want a fucking war? I'm ready.{\r}

1707
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:45,790
我只要干掉那五個 其他的自然會水到渠成
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If I take care of five of those guys, the rest will fall into place.{\r}

1708
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:49,500
被我抓到了吧，這群王八羔子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.{\r}

1709
01:39:50,260 --> 01:39:52,000
我看到你們了，渾蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I see you, you motherfuckers.{\r}

1710
01:39:52,130 --> 01:39:55,750
問題是，尼奇不只是 讓自己更受注目，還連累到我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself, but on me, too.{\r}

1711
01:39:55,890 --> 01:40:00,430
聯邦調查局盯著他的每一步 但他不在乎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The FBI watched every move he made, but he just didn't care.{\r}

1712
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:03,430
想要盯我，我就盯回去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: If they're gonna watch me, I'm gonna watch them back.{\r}

1713
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,520
或許花了很多錢 但誰在乎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I spent a few bucks. Top dollar. Who gives a shit?{\r}

1714
01:40:06,650 --> 01:40:11,140
我買了最先進的反竊聽裝置 向賣給中央調查局的那家買的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I got the latest anti-bugging equipment from the same places that sell to the CIA.{\r}

1715
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:16,190
我有所有的警察特殊頻道對講機 FBI的解干擾器、夜光照相機…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had all the special police frequency radios, FBI de-scramblers, night-vision cameras....{\r}

1716
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:21,950
這些衰角從未抓到我任何把柄
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So, the miserable sons of bitches never caught me doing anything I couldn't handle.{\r}

1717
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:25,830
我工作都快丟了 但他卻玩得不亦樂乎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I got my job on the line, he's having the time of his life.{\r}

1718
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,250
全州的警察都在盯他 他卻在打高爾夫球
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He has every cop in the state watching him, and he's out playing golf.{\r}

1719
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:32,540
對我來說時期最壞不過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And at the worst possible time for me.{\r}

1720
01:40:33,430 --> 01:40:37,420
我的執照聽證會要到了 我不想有一點點失敗的機率
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had my license hearing coming up and I didn't want to leave anything to chance.{\r}

1721
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:41,390
若不能在賭城工作 那我要去哪兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?{\r}

1722
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:45,100
你一直都很合作 從文件到帳簿
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've been very open with us with the books and papers.{\r}

1723
01:40:45,230 --> 01:40:47,770
這對委員會是很重要的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That'll mean a lot when you go before the commission.{\r}

1724
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:51,730
-我只希望能有個公正的聽證會 -你的誠實會為你贏的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-All I ask is a fair hearing. -This honesty will guarantee it.{\r}

1725
01:40:53,110 --> 01:40:54,570
接下來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We'll move on to....{\r}

1726
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:59,940
我想聽聽關于堪薩斯市
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I want to hear about Kansas City.{\r}

1727
01:41:01,460 --> 01:41:02,910
這他媽的是什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck is this?{\r}

1728
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:08,040
這家伙要停在哪里，球場上嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where's this fucking guy gonna land, in the fairway?{\r}

1729
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:30,520
他們是探員，法蘭克 來看看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're fucking agents, Frankie. Look at this.{\r}

1730
01:41:32,660 --> 01:41:35,200
他們盯尼奇打高爾夫盯到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The Feds were watching Nicky play golf for so long...{\r}

1731
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,570
飛機沒油
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they ran out of gas.{\r}

1732
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,870
還真是我需要的 就在委員會面前
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Just what I needed, right in front of the control board.{\r}

1733
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:47,910
賭一百看誰先打到飛機
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$100, whoever hits the plane.{\r}

1734
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:55,430
禍不單行，隨后就看到派斯康 堪薩斯市的老二
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: If things weren't bad enough... in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss.{\r}

1735
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:59,010
在堪薩斯市收皮箱的那家超市 就是他開的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He ran the grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases.{\r}

1736
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:02,350
又在為皮箱的事吵了 你知道這代表什么嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fighting over those suitcases again. You know what that means?{\r}

1737
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:06,020
我又得去拉斯維加斯了 又要花我好幾千
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta take another trip to Vegas. It's gonna cost me another couple grand.{\r}

1738
01:42:06,150 --> 01:42:07,650
他和他姐夫一起開店…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He ran it with his brother-in-law...{\r}

1739
01:42:07,740 --> 01:42:12,110
但他大多都在跟他姐夫與岳母 抱怨他去賭城的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but he mostly complained about his trips to Vegas to his brother-in-law and mother.{\r}

1740
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,360
你得表明態度 要不然他們當你是病貓
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta lay down the law, or they'll make a fool out of you.{\r}

1741
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:19,320
我全記下來了，他媽的每一分一毛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I write it all down. Every fucking nickel goes down.{\r}

1742
01:42:19,460 --> 01:42:23,120
-你是怎么了？ -全都在這兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What's the matter with you? -Everything's here.{\r}

1743
01:42:23,210 --> 01:42:25,200
-你何時開始這樣講話？ -抱歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Since when do you talk like that? -I'm sorry.{\r}

1744
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:29,840
南斯要是找我麻煩 我就將他的眼挖出來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nance gives me trouble, I'll take the eyes out of his freaking head.{\r}

1745
01:42:29,930 --> 01:42:32,250
-又來了 -我沒罵粗話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Again. -I didn't curse, I said, "freaking head."{\r}

1746
01:42:32,390 --> 01:42:33,550
-夠了 -抱歉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-That's enough. -I'm sorry.{\r}

1747
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:35,720
接下來發生的事 簡直是出乎意料
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What happens next, you can't believe it.{\r}

1748
01:42:35,980 --> 01:42:38,760
誰會想到聯邦調查局 會在里面裝竊聽器…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who'd believe the FBI had a wire in the place...{\r}

1749
01:42:38,900 --> 01:42:41,560
為了調查很久以前的一樁命案…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}looking for information about some old homicide...{\r}

1750
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:44,980
為了一個不知在何時 也不知為何事被干掉的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}about some guy who was whacked out God knows when over God knows what?{\r}

1751
01:42:45,070 --> 01:42:48,070
你怎么阻止拿皮箱的人 拿走他想要的？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What prevents him with the suitcases from taking what he wants?{\r}

1752
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,450
南斯從坦吉樂拿了兩口箱子回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nance brings back two suitcases from the Tangiers.{\r}

1753
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:52,110
若其實有三箱或四箱呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What about three or four?{\r}

1754
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:55,110
我們沒有人在計算室里看著 那是法律
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We've got nobody in the room to watch. That's the law.{\r}

1755
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:58,860
我們甚至連計算室都進不去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.{\r}

1756
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,540
他有他的人在里面 他們搞不好根本是一伙的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's got his people in there. They could all be in on it together.{\r}

1757
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:07,460
若我知道是葛林干的 我會埋了那王八蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll find out. If it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard.{\r}

1758
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:10,130
我從就不相信他 我后腦都有眼睛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I never trusted him. I got eyes behind my head.{\r}

1759
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,970
他們信任那渾蛋，我可不
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They trust that scumbag. I don't.{\r}

1760
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:14,340
我該給他們一人一鏟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll hit the two of them in the head with a shovel.{\r}

1761
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:15,510
冷靜點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MA: Take it easy.{\r}

1762
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:18,390
媽，抱歉 但他們一直跟我玩陰的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ma, I'm sorry. They're beating me left and right.{\r}

1763
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:20,850
-抱歉，我很生氣 -我知道，可是夠了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ARTIE: I'm sorry. I'm upset. I know, but that's enough.{\r}

1764
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:24,110
你也知道他們在對我做什么 我受不了了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know what they're doing to me. I can't take this no more.{\r}

1765
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:27,850
-冷靜，別心臟病發 -我知道，我太氣了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MA: Take it easy. You'll get a heart attack. ARTIE: I know. I'm too upset.{\r}

1766
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:31,270
該死的是，他們聽得一清二楚…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The damn thing is, they hear all this stuff...{\r}

1767
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:34,660
關于拉斯維加斯，賭場還有皮箱…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}about Las Vegas, casinos, and suitcases...{\r}

1768
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:36,280
玩完了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and that's it.{\r}

1769
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,670
全都是從我口袋里掏 我得付錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ARTIE: Everything's coming out of my pocket. I gotta pay.{\r}

1770
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:47,670
你相信有這么巧嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Would you believe this could happen?{\r}

1771
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,000
華府

1772
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,050
我是來賺錢的，不是虧錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ARTIE: I'm in this to make money, not lose it.{\r}

1773
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:54,880
全國每個聯邦調查局探員 都張大了耳朵
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now.{\r}

1774
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:58,300
要將事情辦好就得靠自己
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ARTIE: If you want something done right you gotta do it yourself.{\r}

1775
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:02,900
派司康這家伙 幾乎搞砸了所有人的生活
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Piscano, this guy, basically sunk the whole world.{\r}

1776
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:06,350
有些好的就有些壞的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MA: There are some that are good and some that are bad.{\r}

1777
01:44:06,990 --> 01:44:07,940
1980年

1778
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,900
主席先生 委員會的同仁…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COUNSELOR: Members of the Commission...{\r}

1779
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:11,910
今天羅斯坦先生很榮幸能在這兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.{\r}

1780
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,410
當那天終于來時 我已準備好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: When the day finally came, I was ready.{\r}

1781
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:18,280
我自信滿滿的認為 我只需要呈上我的案件
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.{\r}

1782
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:22,920
我們擁有文件，其中一份是由 一位退休的聯邦探員寫的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COUNSELOR: We have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBl agents...{\r}

1783
01:44:23,010 --> 01:44:26,290
上頭清楚的記載羅斯坦先生 并未觸犯任何法律
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein from any wrongdoing.{\r}

1784
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:29,880
-律師，在你繼續前… -我要將這呈為…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Counselor, before you continue... -I want to have this marked....{\r}

1785
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:34,180
本委員會針對是否應 駁回羅斯坦的申請書在此動議
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...this Commission acts on a motion denying the Rothstein application.{\r}

1786
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,760
-駁回？ -有人贊成駁回嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COUNSELOR: Denying? SENATOR: Do I hear a motion seconded?{\r}

1787
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,060
主席先生，我贊成
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.{\r}

1788
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,820
還有贊同票嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do I have a vote on the motion?{\r}

1789
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:41,980
同意！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Aye! -Aye!{\r}

1790
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,360
同意票獲勝，聽證會結束
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The ayes have it. This hearing is adjourned.{\r}

1791
01:44:45,490 --> 01:44:48,660
-開什么玩笑 -什么叫結束？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You have to be kidding. -Adjourned? What do you mean?{\r}

1792
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:51,800
議員，你答應我一場聽證會的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Senator, you promised me a hearing.{\r}

1793
01:44:51,810 --> 01:44:54,000
你連聯邦調查局的報告都沒看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You didn't even look at the FBl reports.{\r}

1794
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:57,150
你來坦吉樂作客時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When you were my guest at the Tangiers Hotel,{\r}

1795
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:59,130
不是答應我會有公平的聽證會？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}didn't you promise me a fair hearing?{\r}

1796
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:00,920
-我從未是你的客人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SENATOR: I was never your guest.{\r}

1797
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,040
-不是我的客人？我沒招待過你？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Never my guest? I never comped you?{\r}

1798
01:45:03,180 --> 01:45:05,460
難道我一個月 沒有最少招待你三次？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't comp you at least three times a month?{\r}

1799
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:07,880
我現在回答這個問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'd like to answer that at this time.{\r}

1800
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:11,300
羅斯坦先生的反應很常見 他在撒謊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mr. Rothstein is being very typical to this point. He's lying.{\r}

1801
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:15,310
我唯一一次去過坦吉樂 就是巴尼葛林斯坦那次晚宴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The only time I was at the Tangiers was a dinner with Barney Greenstein.{\r}

1802
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:18,110
-我當時在場嗎？ -你四處周旋著
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Was I at the dinner? SENATOR: You were wandering around.{\r}

1803
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:21,270
-我在場嗎？ -你四處周旋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Was I at that dinner? SENATOR: You were wandering.{\r}

1804
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,360
-你在室內 -我在室內？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SENATOR: You were in the building. SAM: I was in the building?{\r}

1805
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:26,210
你很清楚我在那兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know damn well I was there.{\r}

1806
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:28,700
你向我保證會有公正的聽證會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You swore I would have a fair hearing.{\r}

1807
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:31,360
沒有嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Did you not?{\r}

1808
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,330
至少承認說我那天在場 這總可以了吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tell me I was at least at the dinner. Allow me that much.{\r}

1809
01:45:37,050 --> 01:45:39,540
-至少也得說我在場吧！ -是，你在
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Give me that much at least! SENATOR: Yes, you were.{\r}

1810
01:45:39,630 --> 01:45:42,340
多謝你沒說我是騙子 你這個狗東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks for not calling me a liar, you son of a bitch.{\r}

1811
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:47,970
一場例行的聽證會 在昨晚成了一場鬧劇…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}A routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday...{\r}

1812
01:45:48,100 --> 01:45:51,800
當搶眼的坦吉樂高層 山姆“艾斯”羅斯坦…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam "Ace" Rothstein...{\r}

1813
01:45:51,900 --> 01:45:54,770
指控賭博游樂委員會高官貪污
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}accused top gaming officials of corruption.{\r}

1814
01:45:54,860 --> 01:45:57,730
你在我的旅館接受招待 并答應我會有公平的聽證會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}...promised me a fair hearing when you were comped at my hotel?{\r}

1815
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:01,060
你還要求將你的帳單掛公帳
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And you asked for copies of your bill to put on your expense account.{\r}

1816
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:04,450
當賭博游樂執照被駁回時大吼大叫…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial...{\r}

1817
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:06,780
-狗屁！ -羅斯坦與好幾名…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Bullshit! ...Rothstein followed several...{\r}

1818
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:10,360
錯愕的委員到走道 并持續著他的指控…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}stunned commissioners into the hallway where he continued his harangue...{\r}

1819
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,950
直到他的律師與朋友勸他離開
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.{\r}

1820
01:46:13,090 --> 01:46:17,250
你有過去，我也有過去 我的不見得比你的糟糕
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You have a past. I have a past. My past is no worse than yours.{\r}

1821
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:20,090
你們還自以為有權去判決別人！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You guys think you have the right to pass judgment!{\r}

1822
01:46:20,220 --> 01:46:23,300
被懷疑長期無照管理坦吉樂…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NEWSREADER: Long suspected of running Tangiers without a license...{\r}

1823
01:46:23,430 --> 01:46:27,890
昨天的聽證會本是要決議 像羅斯坦如此背景的人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}yesterday's hearing was to determine if someone with Rothstein's history...{\r}

1824
01:46:28,020 --> 01:46:30,850
是否有資格正式在賭博游樂界 擔任如此高的職位
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.{\r}

1825
01:46:30,980 --> 01:46:33,140
羅斯坦玩完了 王八偽君子！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: Fucking hypocrites!{\r}

1826
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:36,940
-他現在怎么辦？ -我不知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What the hell's he gonna do now? -I don't know.{\r}

1827
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,690
他在干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What's he doing?{\r}

1828
01:46:39,070 --> 01:46:41,910
他也知道他大吼大叫的那群人 都是我們的朋友
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.{\r}

1829
01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:44,200
他是怎么了，搞得一團糟？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What's the matter with him, making all this mess?{\r}

1830
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:46,700
他或許可以用另一個頭銜管事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe he could run things with another job title.{\r}

1831
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:49,290
這不是最好的 但我們又能如何呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Won't be the best, but what are we gonna do?{\r}

1832
01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:51,440
他不論管什么，都得安靜點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: However he runs things, it's gotta be quiet.{\r}

1833
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:53,790
讓他躲到樓上辦公室去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let him hide upstairs in the office.{\r}

1834
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:55,960
說他是工友，我不在乎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Say he's a janitor. I don't give a shit.{\r}

1835
01:46:56,170 --> 01:47:01,080
但拜托，不管他做什么 都得低調點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But please, whatever job he takes, make sure it's something quiet.{\r}

1836
01:47:10,110 --> 01:47:11,480

01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:08,200
我左邊的這位小姐是特茹蒂…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The young lady to my left is Trudy...{\r}

1850
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:11,830
她是我們巴黎秀新的首席舞者
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who is a lead new dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.{\r}

1851
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:14,340
我們今晚的第一位來寶…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Our first guest this evening...{\r}

1852
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,090
法蘭克艾華倫
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}is Frankie Avalon.{\r}

1853
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:26,390
-看好他 -我有個大家庭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PAT: Keep an eye on him. FRANKIE: I've got a large family.{\r}

1854
01:48:26,480 --> 01:48:30,860
-你有幾個孩子？ -我很自豪的說，八個
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: How many kids do you have? I'm very proud to say, eight children.{\r}

1855
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,860
-太了不起了 -沒什么，是我的榮幸
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-That's amazing. -There's nothing to it. It was my pleasure.{\r}

1856
01:48:39,580 --> 01:48:40,690
別這樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PHILIP: Ace, don't do it.{\r}

1857
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:46,870
天啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Jesus.{\r}

1858
01:48:47,630 --> 01:48:49,120
他在耍雜技！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's juggling!{\r}

1859
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,910
我們別對縣輔導 派特委布太認真
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.{\r}

1860
01:48:53,380 --> 01:48:56,970
我最近本想邀他在節目上辯論的 但是他拒絕了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I recently challenged him to a debate on this program, and he declined.{\r}

1861
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:59,130
你在擔心什么呢，派特？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are you worried about, Pat?{\r}

1862
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:01,350
你不需要事先給我問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You don't have to send me any questions.{\r}

1863
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:04,180
你什么都可以問我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You can ask me anything you want.{\r}

1864
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:06,560
他在電視上干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: What the hell is he doing on television?{\r}

1865
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:07,850
他整晚都在上面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's on all night,{\r}

1866
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:12,110
喊著要將他的案子告上最高法院
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}screaming about taking his lawsuit to the Supreme Court.{\r}

1867
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:15,900
他真是瘋了 他想將這帶到華府去？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?{\r}

1868
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:18,320
他簡直是瘋了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's out of his fucking mind.{\r}

1869
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:22,190
世上有這樣的偽君子真是可嘆 他們愛做什么就做什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a pity we have such hypocrisy. Some people do what they want.{\r}

1870
01:49:22,330 --> 01:49:25,040
其他人卻得承擔后果 這就是人生
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Other people have to pay through the nose. Such is life.{\r}

1871
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:30,370
安迪，去找他 告訴他辭職的時候到了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.{\r}

1872
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:39,220
第一點，他們的所做所為 完全的違反了憲法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: First, what they did was totally unconstitutional.{\r}

1873
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:43,010
我們已在高等法院的等候單上了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: We're on the list to be heard before the U.S. Supreme Court.{\r}

1874
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:45,350
這些家伙才不在乎高等法院
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}These guys don't care about the Supreme Court.{\r}

1875
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:47,910
他們要一切平息，要你別再搞了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away.{\r}

1876
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:48,810
別搞了？安迪，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Walk away? Andy,{\r}

1877
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:53,310
你不是說真的 你難道看不到這嚴重性嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you can't be serious. Don't you see what's at stake?{\r}

1878
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:56,400
老頭說你的朋友或許該罷手了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The old man said maybe your friend should give in.{\r}

1879
01:49:56,540 --> 01:49:59,370
當老頭說“或許”時 就像是教皇發諭令一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When the old man says "maybe," that's like a papal bull.{\r}

1880
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:02,250
你不但該罷手，還該跑路
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Not only should you quit, you should run.{\r}

1881
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:06,790
他們每次在報上提到我的名字 就一定扯到尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Every time they mention my name in the papers, they mention Nicky, too.{\r}

1882
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,670
這他媽的有什么幫助？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How the fuck does that help?{\r}

1883
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:11,380
他帶來的注目簡直是謀殺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The heat he brought down is murder.{\r}

1884
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,750
警察局本來很合作
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The police department was cooperative.{\r}

1885
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:16,590
他將他們激怒到 現在大家都動不了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're pissed off. Nobody can make a move anymore.{\r}

1886
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:17,930
你能怎樣呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What do you do about that?{\r}

1887
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:21,060
-你想說什么？ -我不知道，他根本不聽我的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What are you proposing? -I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.{\r}

1888
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:24,060
或許他才該消失一陣子 這樣會很糟嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe he should get lost for a while. Would that be so bad?{\r}

1889
01:50:24,150 --> 01:50:26,690
-他們不會調走尼奇的 -若他離開一陣…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-They ain't sending Nicky nowhere. -If he took a break...{\r}

1890
01:50:26,820 --> 01:50:28,980
給大家移動布局的機會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}it would give everybody time to maneuver.{\r}

1891
01:50:29,070 --> 01:50:33,020
別再搞布局的事 趕緊離開吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out.{\r}

1892
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:38,190
我不能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't do that.{\r}

1893
01:50:39,410 --> 01:50:43,660
當然，安迪一到家后 尼奇就聽說我們的談話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Of course, as soon as Andy got home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.{\r}

1894
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,710
第二天一大早，我就接到電話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Next morning, bright and early, I get the call.{\r}

1895
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:50,000
我得去買點東西，你要不要去？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I've got to do some shopping. Want to go?{\r}

1896
01:50:50,090 --> 01:50:52,630
連接尼奇的電話都不是件易事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.{\r}

1897
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:55,100
暗號都沒有用了 我們得想新方法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Even the codes didn't work. So we figured out another act.{\r}

1898
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,740
若是電話被竊聽
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If a phone's tapped,{\r}

1899
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:00,140
他們只能聽關于犯罪的談話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the Feds can only listen in on the stuff involving crimes.{\r}

1900
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:03,770
例行通話時 他們必須在幾分鐘后掛斷
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}On routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.{\r}

1901
01:51:03,860 --> 01:51:05,810
我手肘好像扭到了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I got a sprained fucking elbow.{\r}

1902
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:08,310
三點見
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Meet me at 3:00.{\r}

1903
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:10,980
-在凱撒宮嗎？ -這條路下去再一百碼處
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-At Caesar's? -100 yards further down the road.{\r}

1904
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:13,860
-為什么？ -別問了，到那兒就是了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Why? -Don't ask questions. Just be there.{\r}

1905
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:19,030
蘇西克理姆有件一模一樣的衣服
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Suzy Cream Cheese has the same outfit.{\r}

1906
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:22,170
我看到個東西
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I saw something.{\r}

1907
01:51:22,290 --> 01:51:24,580
這東西好可愛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Something very cute.{\r}

1908
01:51:25,460 --> 01:51:29,080
他出門了，棕組
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AGENT: Okay, he's out. It's the ant. Brown unit.{\r}

1909
01:51:29,470 --> 01:51:32,260
他帶著個替身，應該是法蘭克
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's with the bogey. I think it's Frankie.{\r}

1910
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:34,260
尼奇比我早出門…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Nicky started out before me...{\r}

1911
01:51:34,390 --> 01:51:37,230
因為他要出門越來越難了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}because it wasn't that easy for him to get around anymore.{\r}

1912
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:41,560
尼奇到那兒都最起碼得…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky couldn't even go for a ride without changing cars...{\r}

1913
01:51:41,690 --> 01:51:44,480
換六次車才甩得掉跟蹤他的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}at least six times before he could shake all his tails.{\r}

1914
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:47,900
因為有飛機 所以他得用地下停車場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Because of the planes, he had to use underground garages.{\r}

1915
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:22,030
在沙漠中央會面總讓我緊張
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Meeting in the desert always made me nervous.{\r}

1916
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:23,600
那是個可怕的地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's a scary place.{\r}

1917
01:52:24,860 --> 01:52:26,990
我當然也知道沙漠里的洞
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I knew about the holes in the desert, of course.{\r}

1918
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:29,560
我張望的每一處都可能是個洞
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And everywhere I looked, there could have been a hole.{\r}

1919
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:34,650
通常我與尼奇會面 能活著回來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Normally, my prospects of coming back alive...{\r}

1920
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:37,240
機率是百分之九十九
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.{\r}

1921
01:52:39,340 --> 01:52:43,080
但這次，當我聽他說 離道路幾百碼外…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But this time, when I heard him say a couple of hundred yards down the road...{\r}

1922
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:45,880
我想應該還有一半的機率吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gave myself 50-50.{\r}

1923
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:11,320
你他媽的跟別人 在背后捅我是什么意思？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where the fuck you get off talking to people behind my back?{\r}

1924
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:13,950
-跟什么人？ -你以為我不會發現嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What people? -Did you think I wouldn't find out?{\r}

1925
01:53:14,170 --> 01:53:16,370
我根本不知道你在說什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't even know what you're talking about.{\r}

1926
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:21,410
你說我害你被盯？ 我得因為你被人家念？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You said I'm bringing heat on you? I gotta listen to people because of you?{\r}

1927
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:24,630
你想搞走我？ 你最好準備好自己的軍隊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're ordering me out? You better get your own fucking army!{\r}

1928
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,500
我沒有要搞走任何人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't order you or anybody.{\r}

1929
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,300
我跟安迪說你被盯上了 這是個問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I told Andy Stone that you had heat, and that was a problem.{\r}

1930
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:31,510
你想要我離開我自己的地盤？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You want me to get out of my own fucking town?{\r}

1931
01:53:31,640 --> 01:53:34,890
是啊，我說等風頭過了 我才能好好經營賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, let the bullshit blow over so I can run the casino.{\r}

1932
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:38,060
賭場出了什么事我得負責，不是你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass, not yours.{\r}

1933
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:43,140
你知道你之所以能管那狗屁賭場 都是因為我！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know that you only have your fucking casino because I made that possible!{\r}

1934
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:45,160
在這兒我才算數
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm what counts out here.{\r}

1935
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:49,330
不是你他媽的什么俱樂部 也不是你那狗屁電視秀
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.{\r}

1936
01:53:49,450 --> 01:53:51,940
你他媽的在電視上干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And what the fuck are you doing on TV anyhow?{\r}

1937
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,510
我每天都得接老家的電話 他們都覺得你瘋了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I get calls from back home every day. They think you went batshit!{\r}

1938
01:53:55,650 --> 01:53:57,980
我上電視是因為 我必須待在賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.{\r}

1939
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,840
你應該知道的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You understand and you know that....{\r}

1940
01:53:59,960 --> 01:54:03,420
你不上電視也可以拿那餐飲的頭銜！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You could've had the food-and-beverage job without going on TV!{\r}

1941
01:54:03,510 --> 01:54:06,050
-是你想上電視吧 -對，我想上電視
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You wanted to go on TV. -Yeah, I wanted to go on TV.{\r}

1942
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,630
這樣我才有擂臺，我才可以反擊 我要有知名度
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me{\r}

1943
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:12,420
若我有知名度他們就不能 隨隨便便打發我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's why{\r}

1944
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,390
你將自己變成個笑話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're making a spectacle of yourself.{\r}

1945
01:54:14,520 --> 01:54:17,230
要不是你，我也不會落到這步田地
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.{\r}

1946
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,900
你讓我被盯上
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You brought down so much heat on me.{\r}

1947
01:54:19,030 --> 01:54:21,520
我每次遇見個人 他們都只想知道我認不認識你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Every time I meet somebody, they ask me if I know you.{\r}

1948
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:24,290
所以你現在要將你執照的那件事 怪到我的頭上
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Sure, now you wanna blame your fucking license on me.{\r}

1949
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:26,400
當你請示我你可不可以來這兒時…我是怎么說的？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When you asked me if you could come out here...what did I tell you?{\r}

1950
01:54:26,540 --> 01:54:27,010
我意思你問我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean you asked me.{\r}

1951
01:54:27,110 --> 01:54:31,080
我就知道 不管我說什么你都會來，記得嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I knew you'd come out no matter what I said. Do you remember?{\r}

1952
01:54:31,170 --> 01:54:33,920
等一下，倒退一下
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Back up a fucking minute here. One minute.{\r}

1953
01:54:34,170 --> 01:54:34,970
我請示你？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I asked you?{\r}

1954
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:38,500
我他媽的什么時候 請示過你我可不可以來這兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When the fuck did I ever ask you if I could come out here?{\r}

1955
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:42,970
搞清楚點，死猶太人！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker!{\r}

1956
01:54:43,050 --> 01:54:47,130
你是因我才在這兒！ 只因為這樣！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You only exist out here because of me! That's the only reason!{\r}

1957
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:49,720
要沒有我，你自己…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Without me, you personally....{\r}

1958
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:54,690
在這兒隨便哪個還在混的 都可能宰了你！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Every fucking wise guy still around will take a piece of your fucking Jew ass!{\r}

1959
01:54:54,900 --> 01:54:57,440
到時你怎么辦？ 我警告你了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then where you gonna go? You're fucking warned.{\r}

1960
01:54:57,530 --> 01:55:01,280
別想再踩在我頭上 你這個王八蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't go over my fucking head again, you motherfucker, you!{\r}

1961
01:55:30,900 --> 01:55:32,140
有客人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Well, we got company.{\r}

1962
01:55:45,790 --> 01:55:47,160
看到了嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Did you see that?{\r}

1963
01:55:47,540 --> 01:55:48,410
蠢猶太人，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Dumb Jew motherfucker.{\r}

1964
01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:51,200
我們一起長大的 他竟裝作不認識我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Grew up together, and he acts like he doesn't know me.{\r}

1965
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:54,120
我知道我們應該避免碰面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know we're supposed to avoid each other,{\r}

1966
01:55:54,230 --> 01:55:56,420
不過應該有其他辦法吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but there's ways to do things.{\r}

1967
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:58,090
去他的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck him.{\r}

1968

敬林肯總統
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}To Abraham Lincoln.{\r}

1969
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,790
算了，別讓這煩你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Forget about it. Don't let it bother you.{\r}

1970
01:56:03,310 --> 01:56:06,140
我看來很煩躁嗎？ 我為什么要在乎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Does it look like it's bothering me? Why do I give a fuck?{\r}

1971
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:10,050
奧斯卡也是的 我給了他那么多錢，渾蛋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oscar, too. All the money I gave him, that prick.{\r}

1972
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:12,760
他連看都不看這邊 他到底是什么毛病？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He didn't even look over. What's his fucking problem?{\r}

1973
01:56:13,780 --> 01:56:15,200
-死猶太人都是一伙的，不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Fucking Jews stick together, don't they?{\r}

1974
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:17,440
-他們好像玩得很快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-yeah. but they're having a good time.{\r}

1975
01:56:18,450 --> 01:56:19,780
我們也是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So are we.{\r}

1976
01:56:25,460 --> 01:56:26,530
喂？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah?{\r}

1977
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:28,790
-山姆，有麻煩 -怎么了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Sam, we got a problem. -What is it?{\r}

1978
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,700
那矮子，沒人跟他說 他被禁止進入賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}BILLY: The little guy. Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint.{\r}

1979
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,870
我們只要都假裝不認識他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We turned our heads and made out like we didn't know who he was.{\r}

1980
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:39,500
他現在在21點桌大剌剌的豪賭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's over at the 21 table with his nose wide open.{\r}

1981
01:56:40,300 --> 01:56:43,840
他從他那份抽頭里拿錢 已經輸了一萬了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He took money out of his own kick. His nose is open for about $10,000.{\r}

1982
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:46,010
現在他很生氣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Now he's really pissed.{\r}

1983
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:51,010
-他要五萬的籌碼 -給他一萬就好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He wants a $50,000 marker. -Just give him $10,000.{\r}

1984
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:52,690
就這樣，我馬上來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's it. I'll be right down.{\r}

1985
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:55,270
就如你所要求 他會去拿一萬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's gonna come up with $10,000 just the way you want.{\r}

1986
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,900
不，我他媽的說五萬！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, I said fucking $50,000!{\r}

1987
01:56:58,030 --> 01:57:00,610
給我去拿 我不在乎你用什么方法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Go get it. I don't give a fuck where you get it.{\r}

1988
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:03,200
王八蛋 只會拿錢卻不還來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuckers. They take it but don't wanna give it back.{\r}

1989
01:57:07,670 --> 01:57:09,160
你還笑得出來？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How the fuck can you grin?{\r}

1990
01:57:12,010 --> 01:57:14,840
你知道我輸多少了嗎？ 你在乎嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know how much I'm stuck? Do you give a fuck?{\r}

1991
01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:22,430
給自己點掌聲吧 順便加一巴掌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Give yourself a hand, right across your fucking mouth.{\r}

1992
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,720
看看現在上來的這個怪胎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look at this beaut they put in now.{\r}

1993
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:26,850
雪伯提派你來搶我的嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Sherbert send you in here to rob me now?{\r}

1994
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:31,070
你今晚屌了很久了吧？贏很多喔？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Been fucking knocking everybody's dick in all night? Been beating the customers?{\r}

1995
01:57:32,110 --> 01:57:34,020
再來一張
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Jag-off. Hit me.{\r}

1996
01:57:36,700 --> 01:57:40,400

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Keep looking at him. you fucking dammy{\r}

2000
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:55,840
你要還有良心 你就寧可去當小偷
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you had any heart at all, you'd be stealing for a living.{\r}

你給錢應該跟拿錢一樣快吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: You should pay as fast as you collect, you know.{\r}

2004
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:19,230
-你得走了 -叫那王八蛋付籌碼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You gotta get out of here. -Tell this motherfucker to pay that marker.{\r}

2005
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:22,860
你沒在聽，我是來幫你的 你會將我們倆都毀了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're not listening. I'm here to help you. You're gonna bury us both.{\r}

2006

然后你得在條子找到你之前給我走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.{\r}

2008
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,210
就一萬
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$10,000 and that's it.{\r}

2009
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:40,580
你在看什么？ 你這禿頭的死猶太人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are you staring at, you bald-headed Jew prick?{\r}

2010
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:48,760

2012
01:58:52,860 --> 01:58:56,110
我知道，但現在情況不同了 你要求的是離婚
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know, but everything's changed now. You're talking about a divorce.{\r}

2013
01:58:56,230 --> 01:58:59,480
你要求你與孩子的贍養費 現在又要孩子的監護權
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're asking for alimony payments and child support, and now custody.{\r}

2014
01:58:59,570 --> 01:59:01,650
我只要任何一個離婚女人想要的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just want what any divorced woman would get.{\r}

2015
01:59:01,820 --> 01:59:03,980
她一天不過清醒兩個小時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She's only sober about two hours a day.{\r}

2016
01:59:04,080 --> 01:59:06,400
通常是早上十一點到下午一點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's usually from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.{\r}

2017
01:59:06,540 --> 01:59:08,810
我要是給她錢與珠寶
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If I gave her her money and her jewels,{\r}

2018
01:59:08,810 --> 01:59:11,080
她一年內就會浪費光了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}she's gonna piss it all away in a year.{\r}

2019
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:15,200
到時你怎么辦？ 還不是又回來找我…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where would you be then? Coming right back to me...{\r}

2020
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:17,500
或找什么其他的理由回來…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}or finding some other excuse to come....{\r}

2021
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:21,090
我們有協議，記得嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We had a deal. Remember that?{\r}

2022
01:59:22,430 --> 01:59:22,960
他說過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He said{\r}

2023
01:59:22,960 --> 01:59:26,340
若我們之間走不下去 我可以拿我的東西走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}if it didn't work out between us, I could get my things and leave.{\r}

2024
01:59:28,600 --> 01:59:29,710
看著我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look in my eyes.{\r}

2025
01:59:33,440 --> 01:59:34,600
你知道我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You know me.{\r}

2026
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:38,360
你看到任何跡象 讓你覺得…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you see anything that makes you think I would ever let...{\r}

2027
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,020
以你現在的狀況 我會將我的孩子交給你？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}someone in your condition take my child away from me?{\r}

2028
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,310
有嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you?{\r}

2029
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,120
你知道這不可能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know that won't happen.{\r}

2030
01:59:54,210 --> 01:59:56,000
過了這么久…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: And after all this time...{\r}

2031
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:59,340
不管我多么努力，多么想…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted...{\r}

2032
01:59:59,550 --> 02:00:01,260
我始終觸碰不到她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I could never reach her.{\r}

2033
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:03,510
我無法讓她愛我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I could never make her love me.{\r}

2034
02:00:03,640 --> 02:00:07,090
我總覺得她會愛我 那么多的錢…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I always felt she should have gone for all that money...{\r}

2035
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:11,430
第一次在生命中成為一個重要的人 一個家、孩子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}being somebody for the first time in her life, a home, a kid.{\r}

2036
02:00:11,850 --> 02:00:14,390
但事實并非如此 那樣做卻行不通
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's not what happened. It didn't work out that way.{\r}

2037
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:16,000
-都好嗎？ -我們能怎么辦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Everything all right? SAM: What could we do?{\r}

2038
02:00:16,160 --> 02:00:18,500
過一陣子后，我們開始放對方的假
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other.{\r}

2039
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:20,390
短期的不見面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you know about little separations.{\r}

2040
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:24,150
那時，我記得金吉兒 帶著艾美去比佛利山莊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.{\r}

2041
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:26,150
她要去逛一個禮拜的街
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She was gonna spend a week shopping.{\r}

2067
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:58,450
你想報復嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: You want to get back at this prick?{\r}

2068
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:01,660
那保險箱里有兩百萬對吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: You got what, $2 million in that box?{\r}

2069
02:02:02,590 --> 02:02:06,040
喂，耽誤你一下？ 他保險箱里有兩百萬對吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You got a minute? He's got $2 million in the box, right?{\r}

2070
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:08,670
珠寶就留給他，我們拿走現金…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You let him keep your jewels. We take the cash...{\r}

2071
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:11,470
與他唯一在乎的另一件東西 他的小公主
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and the only other thing he cares about. Her majesty.{\r}

2072
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,840
我們去歐洲，你把頭發染了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We go to Europe. You dye your hair.{\r}

2073
02:02:14,180 --> 02:02:18,100
我不要去歐洲 我要去看TheEIephantMan
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.{\r}

2074
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:21,930
我們要去歐洲，讓大人講話 你去染頭發
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}We're going to Europe. Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.{\r}

2075
02:02:22,070 --> 02:02:24,310
像我們所說的去整容
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You get plastic surgery like we talked about.{\r}

2076
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:27,110
你覺得他會愿意付多少贖金？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How much you think he'll pay to get this kid back?{\r}

2077
02:02:27,240 --> 02:02:29,910
-我不要去歐洲 -你給我閉嘴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AMY: I don't want to go to Europe. LESTER: Shut your mouth.{\r}

2078
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:32,070
-你才閉嘴 -你要我過來？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AMY: You shut up. LESTER: Want me to come over?{\r}

2079
02:02:32,200 --> 02:02:34,440
我一巴掌打死你，別找我麻煩！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: I'll smack your face. Don't give me your shit!{\r}

2080
02:02:34,750 --> 02:02:37,200
這本來是個夢 但現在要實現了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}This has always been a dream, but now we're going.{\r}

2081
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:40,990
-萊斯特，他打到這兒來 -他剛在電話上
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Lester, he called you here. -Right. Ace was on the phone.{\r}

2082
02:02:41,130 --> 02:02:43,330
-我剛跟他講完 -所以他知道你在哪兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I just talked to him. -So he knows where you are.{\r}

2083
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:45,710
這表示他現在就派人過來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That means he's sending some guys over here now.{\r}

2084
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,590
這表示他在電話旁像個蠢蛋…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It means he's sitting by the phone, like a dumbbell....{\r}

2085
02:02:49,050 --> 02:02:52,630
對，他就像是蠢蛋坐在電話旁 等你打給他！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Yeah, he's sitting by the phone waiting for you to call him back!{\r}

2086
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:56,630
我們該怎么辦？他可能 已經派人在門外守著了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What are we gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fucking house!{\r}

2087
02:02:56,770 --> 02:03:00,050
-又是你在那兒鬼扯！ -快拿行李，快走！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-It's this fucking bullshit of yours! -Get your bag! Let's go!{\r}

2088
02:03:00,980 --> 02:03:04,850
-什么鬼扯？你想現在討論這嗎？ -你嘮叨完了沒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What bullshit? You want to talk it over? -Are you done yakking?{\r}

2089
02:03:05,030 --> 02:03:06,770
快！快上車！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Go! Get in the car!{\r}

2090
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:09,850
冷靜點，沒人要被殺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Just relax. Nobody's killing anybody.{\r}

2091
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:11,730
-他一定會殺了我 -冷靜點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I think he's gonna kill me. NICKY: Relax.{\r}

2092
02:03:11,870 --> 02:03:15,730
一個小時后打這支電話給我 我想想辦法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Call me back here in exactly an hour on this phone. I'll see what I can do.{\r}

2093
02:03:16,370 --> 02:03:18,910
我一個小時后打給你…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll call you back in an hour at this number...{\r}

2094
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,870
-你會接對不對？ -我會在
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-and you'll be there, right? -I'll be here.{\r}

2095
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,420
聽著，別再做什么蠢事了 你還好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Listen, don't do anything else crazy. You all right?{\r}

2096
02:03:24,840 --> 02:03:26,120
好，再見
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, bye.{\r}

2097
02:03:27,470 --> 02:03:29,380
-停止 -是她開始的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Knock it off. LESTER: She started it.{\r}

2098
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:30,970
都是她開始的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She started the whole thing.{\r}

2099
02:03:31,090 --> 02:03:33,590
-你別想開車 -我來開
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Don't even think you're gonna drive. -I'm gonna drive.{\r}

2100
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:36,680
-我可不想坐瘋婆子開的車 -你快把我搞瘋了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}LESTER: I'm not gonna drive with a crazy woman. You're driving me nuts!{\r}

2101
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:39,930
滾到旁邊去！ 我要將這小鬼裝箱寄到玻利維亞去！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Get on the passenger side! I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a box!{\r}

2102
02:03:57,040 --> 02:03:58,370
我們能不能…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can we....{\r}

2103
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:17,670
金吉兒打給我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Ginger called me.{\r}

2104
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:25,940
-我說她打給我 -她想怎樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I just told you she called me. SAM: What'd she want?{\r}

2105
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,860
她不敢打給你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She was afraid to call you.{\r}

2106
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:33,610
她又跟那敗類在一起了 艾美在他們手上
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She's with that cocksucker again. They got Amy.{\r}

2107
02:04:34,240 --> 02:04:37,660
她想回來，可是她害怕你會殺了她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.{\r}

2108
02:04:37,790 --> 02:04:40,030
他們想綁架我的孩子 你覺得我會怎樣？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?{\r}

2109
02:04:40,460 --> 02:04:45,000
我知道，你怎么不來找我？ 這是家務事，不是公事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know. Why didn't you come to me? This is family. It ain't business.{\r}

2110
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:49,750
你卻打電話回老家 這樣讓我們很難看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Meanwhile, you made calls back home. It makes us look bad out here.{\r}

2111
02:04:49,880 --> 02:04:51,920
這樣來來回回
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Back and forth, this one and that one.{\r}

2112
02:04:52,010 --> 02:04:54,710
在這期間她也一樣會跑了 不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?{\r}

2113
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:58,470
我該拿這女人怎么辦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What am I going to do with this woman?{\r}

2114
02:05:00,020 --> 02:05:03,770
-快把我搞瘋了 -我覺得你…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Driving me fucking crazy. NICKY: I think if you...{\r}

2115
02:05:03,900 --> 02:05:07,680
應該保證不會動她，她才會回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.{\r}

2116
02:05:09,070 --> 02:05:10,980
簡直被她搞瘋了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Driving me fucking crazy.{\r}

2117
02:05:11,110 --> 02:05:13,230
她回來后你再從長計議
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Once you get her here, think about it.{\r}

2118
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:15,810
最起碼先把孩子弄回來 她也想回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Wait till you get the kid back. She wants to come back.{\r}

2119
02:05:15,950 --> 02:05:18,070
這才是重點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's the main thing here.{\r}

2120
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:20,540
你要孩子不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You want your kid, don't you?{\r}

2121
02:05:25,590 --> 02:05:26,750
喂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Hello.{\r}

2122
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:31,420
是我，你迫不及待 想跟我講話吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?{\r}

2123
02:05:31,550 --> 02:05:34,470
聽著，我不會問你人在哪兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Listen, I'm not gonna ask you where you are.{\r}

2124
02:05:34,590 --> 02:05:38,920
只是請你將艾美馬上 送上飛機回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Just, please, put Amy on a plane to get her here right away.{\r}

2125
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:41,680
-我別無所求 -你…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: That's all I'm asking. GINGER: Do you....{\r}

2126
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:45,010
我是說，我不覺得 她應該一個人回去
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, I don't think she should go by herself.{\r}

2127
02:05:47,110 --> 02:05:48,270
你這是什么意思？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What do you mean?{\r}

2128
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:50,260
我是說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What I mean is--{\r}

2129
02:05:50,650 --> 02:05:54,400
如果我回去…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you think if I came back....{\r}

2130
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:58,320
你可以原諒我嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you think you could forgive me?{\r}

2131
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,910
老實說，我不知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I gotta tell you, I don't know.{\r}

2132
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,870
我了解
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I understand that.{\r}

2133
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:06,920
我知道我搞砸了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know I fucked up.{\r}

2134
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:11,340
-那錢呢？盒子呢？ -老實說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What about the money? Where's the box? -I gotta tell you...{\r}

2135
02:06:12,590 --> 02:06:15,160
我做錯事了 我花了一些錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I made some mistakes, and I spent some money.{\r}

2136
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:18,220
-少很多嗎？ -蠻多的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: What's it under? GINGER: Pretty serious.{\r}

2137
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:22,840
-多少 -兩萬五以下
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: How serious? GINGER: It's under $25,000.{\r}

2138
02:06:23,140 --> 02:06:25,020
-兩萬五以下？ -對
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It's under $25,000? GINGER: Yeah.{\r}

2139
02:06:25,100 --> 02:06:28,100
-剩下的兩百萬還在嗎？ -在，其他的都還在
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The $2 million is still there? GINGER: Yeah, I got the rest.{\r}

2140
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:30,400
好吧，沒關系
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, no big deal. That's okay.{\r}

2141
02:06:31,690 --> 02:06:33,020
他拿了兩萬五
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He got his $25,000.{\r}

2142
02:06:34,200 --> 02:06:36,320
我可以接受，再多就不行了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That I'll live with. Any more, I couldn't.{\r}

2143
02:06:36,450 --> 02:06:37,440
好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.{\r}

2144
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:41,150
好啦，你在哪里？ 我馬上派飛機去接你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All right, all right. Where are you? I'll send a plane for you right away.{\r}

2145
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:46,330
嗨，山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Hi, Sam.{\r}

2146
02:06:57,970 --> 02:06:59,460
你拿去干嘛了？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So what'd you do with it?{\r}

2147
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:01,050
什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}With what?{\r}

2148
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:04,560
錢啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}With the money.{\r}

2149
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:07,560
他需要些衣服
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He needed some clothes.{\r}

2150
02:07:08,900 --> 02:07:10,690
兩萬五買衣服？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$25,000 for clothes?{\r}

2151
02:07:12,530 --> 02:07:14,400
他還要了只表
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He wanted a watch, too.{\r}

2152
02:07:17,360 --> 02:07:19,160
兩萬五買衣服和表？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}$25,000 for clothes and a watch?{\r}

2153
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:24,940
晚安夫人，這邊請
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINO: Good evening, signora. This way.{\r}

2154
02:07:25,210 --> 02:07:27,280
好事是艾美回來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The good part was I had Amy back.{\r}

2155
02:07:27,420 --> 02:07:31,630
我們回家，請管家來過夜 然后送孩子上床
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed.{\r}

2156
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,130
我逼自己冷靜 然后我們出門吃飯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I calmed myself down, and we went to dinner.{\r}

2157
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:36,750
我試著讓一切緩和…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I tried to keep things nice and civil...{\r}

2158
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:40,880
但是兩萬五買三套西裝？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but $25, 000 for three suits?{\r}

2159
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:43,340
這不太合理
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That doesn't make much sense.{\r}

2160
02:07:43,890 --> 02:07:46,380
第一點，他不可能穿 一千元一套的西裝
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}First of all, he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.{\r}

2161
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:49,760
就算假設他穿，雖然他不會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let's say he did, which he won't.{\r}

2162
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:52,510
三天內怎么可能 量身訂做25套西裝？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How you gonna get fitted for 25 suits in three days?{\r}

2163
02:07:54,900 --> 02:07:56,940
怎么可能量得那么快？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?{\r}

2164
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:59,600
我付兩倍的錢都不可能那么快
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much.{\r}

2165
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:01,660
我還幫他買了只表
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I bought him a watch, too.{\r}

2166
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:07,370
就算是買了只好表 一只他認為是好的表…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But even if you bought him a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice...{\r}

2167
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:09,660
他根本不知道好表長什么樣子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.{\r}

2168
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:14,250
假設表價在五千 最多一萬二，對他來說也不可能
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Say you go $5,000 to $12,000 at the most, which is impossible for him.{\r}

2169
02:08:15,880 --> 02:08:20,290
加上三套一千一套的西裝 還剩多少？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Plus, at the most, three suits, $1,000 apiece. That still leaves what?{\r}

2170
02:08:20,890 --> 02:08:23,920
-差不多一萬左右 -山姆，可以停止嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Around $10,000? -Would you knock it off, Sam?{\r}

2171
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:27,220
-我只是想算清楚 -沒什么好算的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I'm just trying to figure it out. GINGER: There's nothing to figure out.{\r}

2172
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,510
我回家了，我們在協調
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm home. We're working it out.{\r}

2173
02:08:32,730 --> 02:08:35,310
可是我以前也聽過 “我們在協調”
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But I've been told before, "We're working it out."{\r}

2174
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:37,070
你以為你回家…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You think that you're home...{\r}

2175
02:08:37,650 --> 02:08:41,350
在你對我與艾美所做的一切后 算是給我面子嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}after what you just put me through with Amy, is a favor to me?{\r}

2176
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:49,960
加上表，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Counting the watch,{\r}

2177
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:53,920
假設你們這個周末 花費了四千好了…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}let's say another $4,000 for expenses this weekend...{\r}

2178
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:57,040
我相信你們一定過得很愉快
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}of which you must have had a good time.{\r}

2179
02:08:57,170 --> 02:08:58,960
至少我很確定他很愉快
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know he did. That's for sure.{\r}

2180
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:02,750
我知道那狗雜種一定很快樂
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know that fucking piece of shit had a good fucking time.{\r}

2181
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:06,140
花我的錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}On my money.{\r}

2182
02:09:06,600 --> 02:09:09,720
你干脆就跟他上床算了 你八成也這樣做了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You might as well have fucked him, which you probably did anyway.{\r}

2183
02:09:11,310 --> 02:09:13,140
你看我的表情很奇怪
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're looking at me a certain way.{\r}

2184
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:16,480
你熱淚盈眶
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're teary-eyed.{\r}

2185
02:09:17,490 --> 02:09:19,940
你很難過 你真是個好演員
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're upset. You're a good actress, you know that?{\r}

2186
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,520
真他媽的演得好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Good fucking actress.{\r}

2187
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:25,910
你可讓任何人可憐你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You can fucking get pity out of people.{\r}

2188
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:27,780
但我不是嫖客，好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not a john. You understand?{\r}

2189
02:09:28,250 --> 02:09:31,120
你一直以為我是 但我不是，我也不是冤大頭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You always thought I was, but I'm not. And I'm not a sucker.{\r}

2190
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:35,280
那可惡的拉皮條狗雜碎
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That fucking pimp cocksucker.{\r}

2191
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:37,420
上次沒殺了他是他命好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.{\r}

2192
02:09:37,590 --> 02:09:40,790
他活著是命好 若你們帶著艾美…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Lucky he's fucking living. If you would have stayed with Amy...{\r}

2193
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:42,920
然后走人的話 他就死定了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and you had run away, he would have been dead.{\r}

2194
02:09:43,050 --> 02:09:45,760
你們倆都死定了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Both of you. Dead. Dead.{\r}

2195
02:09:54,930 --> 02:09:56,630
不，不公平
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: No, it isn't fair.{\r}

2196
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:05,800
他晚上根本不回家 有什么了不起？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He doesn't come home at night. What is the big fucking deal?{\r}

2197
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:08,470
我走，聽著，我真的受不了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I go.... Listen, I just can't fucking take it.{\r}

2198
02:10:08,610 --> 02:10:11,310
我為什么要忍受？ 這不是我們的協議
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Why should I fucking take it? That wasn't the deal.{\r}

2199
02:10:12,110 --> 02:10:15,480
他一副好像就只有我有過去的樣子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fucking past.{\r}

2200
02:10:15,650 --> 02:10:17,530
他永遠都不讓我忘記
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He'll never let me live it down.{\r}

2201
02:10:17,870 --> 02:10:20,820
是，我試過，我當然試過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Well, yes, I have tried. Of course I've tried.{\r}

2202
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:23,320
你以為我為什么回來？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What the fuck do you think I came back here for?{\r}

2203
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:26,240
不，我不，我想殺了他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, I'm not. I want to have him killed.{\r}

2204
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:28,950
對，我要殺了他 我受夠了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I want him killed. I've had it.{\r}

2205
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:31,210
你要幫我嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So are you with me on this?{\r}

2206
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:35,450
你想干掉我？我就在這兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You want to get rid of me? Here I am.{\r}

2207
02:10:35,970 --> 02:10:37,510
來啊，干掉我啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Go ahead. Get rid of me.{\r}

2208
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:41,420
-喂 -是的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Hello. GINGER: Yes, I do!{\r}

2209
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:46,180
我恨死你了！我受不了了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I fucking hate you! I can't take it anymore!{\r}

2210
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:49,180
是，我要殺了你！ 我恨死你了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fucking guts!{\r}

2211
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:52,270
你恨死我了？ 我要你現在就給我過來！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now!{\r}

2212
02:10:57,490 --> 02:10:58,820
我要你滾！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I want you out of here!{\r}

2213
02:11:04,910 --> 02:11:06,740
拿好行李給我滾！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Take your fucking bag and get out of here!{\r}

2214
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:08,950
我會走，但我現在就要我的錢！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll go, but I want my money right now!{\r}

2215
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:11,950
-你會拿到錢的！別擔心 -協議結束了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-You'll get your money! Don't worry. -The arrangement is over.{\r}

2216
02:11:12,040 --> 02:11:14,620
-廢話！ -我還是拿得到錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: No kidding! GINGER: And I still get my money.{\r}

2217
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:17,830
我現在就要一些現金 你不能就這樣把我趕出街！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I need some cash now! You can't just put me in the street!{\r}

2218
02:11:17,970 --> 02:11:20,500
你從一認識我就沒誠實過！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You've never been straight with me ever since I met you!{\r}

2219
02:11:20,600 --> 02:11:22,750
你從一開始就沒愛過我！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You never even loved me in the first place!{\r}

2220
02:11:22,850 --> 02:11:25,550
跟你這婊子一起 我連腦后都得長眼睛！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I need eyes in the back of my head with you, you bitch!{\r}

2221
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:28,890
我怎么愛你？ 你對我像對條狗一樣！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How could I love you? You treat me like I'm your fucking dog!{\r}

2222
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:32,690
-你連狗都不如！ -去你的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You're lower than a dog! GINGER: Fuck you!{\r}

2223
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:34,520
拿去！夠了沒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Here! Is this enough money?{\r}

2224
02:11:34,650 --> 02:11:37,190
可以活兩天嗎？拿去！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Will it last you two fucking days? Take it!{\r}

2225
02:11:37,530 --> 02:11:40,560
-貪得無厭的婊子，錢拿去 -我要去銀行…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Greedy bitch. Take the fucking money. -I'm going to the bank...{\r}

2226
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:44,110
-我還要去拿我的珠寶！ -早上9點開，去拿啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-and I'm getting my jewelry, too! -It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there.{\r}

2227
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:47,240
別叫你的人去阻止我！ 我說真的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it!{\r}

2228
02:11:47,370 --> 02:11:49,280
我向你保證我絕對不會阻止你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I guarantee you, I will not stop you.{\r}

2229
02:11:49,420 --> 02:11:52,090
你別想以一口箱子就打發我！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're not getting rid of me with one fucking suitcase!{\r}

2230
02:11:52,210 --> 02:11:55,290
剩下的明天再回來拿吧 給我滾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.{\r}

2231
02:11:55,590 --> 02:11:57,300
-我要帶艾美走 -不行
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I'm taking Amy. SAM: You're not.{\r}

2232
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:58,880
我要，我現在去叫她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I am. I'm waking her up right now.{\r}

2233
02:11:59,010 --> 02:12:01,130
你剋藥了，你這個毒蟲 給我滾
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get out of here.{\r}

2234
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:03,050
我不是！她也是我女兒！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I am not! She's my daughter, too!{\r}

2235
02:12:03,180 --> 02:12:05,880
寫信給我的律師吧，去你的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Send my lawyers a letter, god-fucking-damn you!{\r}

2236
02:12:06,430 --> 02:12:10,480
你跑不掉的！ 你別想不遵守你的諾言！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: You're not getting away with this! You're not gonna cut me out of my end!{\r}

2237
02:12:11,730 --> 02:12:13,110
王八蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Fucker!{\r}

2238
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:08,650
好笑的是，經過這么多事 我還是不想讓她走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The funny thing was, after all that, I didn't want her to go.{\r}

2239
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:11,410
她是我孩子的媽，我愛她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.{\r}

2240
02:13:12,120 --> 02:13:12,630
后來，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Later,{\r}

2241
02:13:12,630 --> 02:13:16,070
我發現我并不想 將錢給她，因為我若給了…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I realized I didn't want to give her the money because if I did...{\r}

2242
02:13:17,710 --> 02:13:19,370
我知道將再也見不到她
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I knew I'd never see her again.{\r}

2243
02:13:31,560 --> 02:13:33,930
在學校要開開心心的喔
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Have a good day at school, okay?{\r}

2244
02:13:34,150 --> 02:13:35,610
好的，天使
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay, angel.{\r}

2245
02:13:40,530 --> 02:13:43,730
從現在起，我隨時都得知道 你與艾美在哪兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}From now on, I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.{\r}

2246
02:13:46,490 --> 02:13:47,520
這是呼叫器
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Here's a beeper.{\r}

2247
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:50,330
我要你拿著
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want you to keep it on you.{\r}

2248
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:52,160
很輕
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's very light.{\r}

2249
02:13:52,750 --> 02:13:54,620
讓我可以隨時打給你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: So I can call you whenever I have to.{\r}

2250
02:13:58,880 --> 02:13:59,990
好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay?{\r}

2251
02:14:10,680 --> 02:14:12,510
你能怎么做？ 你想怎么做呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What are you supposed to do? What do you wanna do?{\r}

2252
02:14:12,690 --> 02:14:15,520
你想就像現在這樣嗎？ 你也不能啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You want to stay the way you are? You can't do that.{\r}

2253
02:14:15,610 --> 02:14:18,560
兩個人若合不來 總要有人出來說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it....{\r}

2254
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:21,650
這不關我的事 但我覺得你應該這樣做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's not my business, but I think that's what you gotta do.{\r}

2255
02:14:21,780 --> 02:14:23,490
你說得對，我知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're right. I know.{\r}

2256
02:14:23,780 --> 02:14:25,520
-我只是… -什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I was just-- -What?{\r}

2257
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:29,070
-沒什么 -你想說什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Nothing. -What were you gonna say?{\r}

2258
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:31,410
-我不… -告訴我你本來想說什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I don't-- -Tell me what you were gonna say.{\r}

2259
02:14:31,500 --> 02:14:32,610
真的？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah?{\r}

2260
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:36,910
我在想說你有沒有認識 銀行的人…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was thinking maybe you know somebody at the bank...{\r}

2261
02:14:37,540 --> 02:14:39,580
可以幫我把珠寶拿出來？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}who could help me get my jewelry out?{\r}

2262
02:14:40,130 --> 02:14:41,790
有很多錢在那兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's a lot of money in there.{\r}

2263
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:45,670
我愿意重賞任何可以幫助我的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.{\r}

2264
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:48,880
我想想辦法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let me think about that.{\r}

2265
02:14:50,020 --> 02:14:53,220
我看看能找誰 一定得是可以信得過的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Let me see who I got. Gotta get somebody I can trust.{\r}

2266
02:14:53,730 --> 02:14:55,890
你也知道他是不會把珠寶給我的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You know he's never gonna give me my jewelry.{\r}

2267
02:14:57,310 --> 02:15:00,650
他把那把鑰匙抓得很緊 我看就差沒藏到屁眼里去了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.{\r}

2268
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:04,440
說得好，真像是山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You're right. That's Sammy.{\r}

2269
02:15:04,820 --> 02:15:06,700
搞不好真的就在那兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And he's probably got it there, too.{\r}

2270
02:15:08,870 --> 02:15:11,990
他真是命大，我本可以埋了他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's so fucking lucky. I could have buried him.{\r}

2271
02:15:12,620 --> 02:15:15,460
我本可以去歐洲并把孩子帶走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby.{\r}

2272
02:15:16,830 --> 02:15:19,540
那他可能就會找到我 并把我殺了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Then he'd have tracked me down, and he'd have killed me.{\r}

2273
02:15:19,880 --> 02:15:22,420
不，他不會，但我會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No, he wouldn't. I would have.{\r}

2274
02:15:22,970 --> 02:15:25,880
-不過他是沒錯 -別鬧了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He'd have been right, too. Seriously. -Come on.{\r}

2275
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:28,710
你不能就這樣把他的孩子帶走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You don't take a guy's kid and then take off.{\r}

2276
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,580
我沒有，我本來有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't. I did,{\r}

2277
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,970
但后來我照你所說的回家了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came back.{\r}

2278
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:35,970
你是，你照做了，很好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You did. You're right. I like that.{\r}

2279
02:15:36,690 --> 02:15:40,820
-我喜歡這樣，你做對了 -我聽了你的話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-That's what I like, you did the right thing. -I did what you told me to.{\r}

2280
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:44,310
-是的 -你總會告訴我正確的做法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Yes, you did. -You always tell me the right thing to do.{\r}

2281
02:15:50,790 --> 02:15:53,570
他真的在這兒把自己搞砸了 不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He really fucked himself up out here, didn't he?{\r}

2282
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:56,660
-是啊 -這一切改變了他的想法
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He sure did. -Everything went to his head.{\r}

2283
02:15:59,290 --> 02:16:00,490
改變了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Changed.{\r}

2284
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:03,080
-他變了，他已不是同一個人了 -不，他不是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He did. He ain't the same person. -No, he's not.{\r}

2285
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:07,670
-他真的覺得自己多了不起 -的確
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He really thinks who the fuck he is. -Exactly.{\r}

2286
02:16:11,640 --> 02:16:13,100
他恨我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He hates me.{\r}

2287
02:16:13,180 --> 02:16:15,140
他好恨我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He hates my fucking guts.{\r}

2288
02:16:15,560 --> 02:16:18,480
別這樣，你最堅強了 這不算什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.{\r}

2289
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:26,150
-別哭 -我沒你想像的堅強
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Don't cry. GINGER: I'm not as tough as you think I am.{\r}

2290
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:27,820
你有
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, you are.{\r}

2291
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:30,360
我沒有，我好怕他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm not, and he scares the shit out of me.{\r}

2292
02:16:30,490 --> 02:16:32,950
-我永遠都不知道他下步要干嘛 -別這樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I never know what he's gonna do. -Come on.{\r}

2293
02:16:33,910 --> 02:16:36,910
-別怕 -我需要幫助
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Don't be scared. -I need some help.{\r}

2294
02:16:39,040 --> 02:16:40,700
我需要幫助
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I need some help.{\r}

2295
02:16:42,500 --> 02:16:43,880
你得幫我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You gotta help me.{\r}

2296
02:16:44,760 --> 02:16:46,800
我需要個新靠山
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I need a new sponsor, Nicky.{\r}

2297
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,670
真的，我需要個新的靠山
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I do. I need a new sponsor.{\r}

2298
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:51,590
-這是你想要的？ -是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Is that what you want? -Yeah.{\r}

2299
02:16:51,850 --> 02:16:53,510
-靠山？ -是的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-A sponsor? -Yeah.{\r}

2300
02:16:55,770 --> 02:17:00,680
好，別擔心 沒人敢動你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody will fuck with you anymore.{\r}

2301
02:17:01,650 --> 02:17:03,520
我會照顧你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll take care of you.{\r}

2302
02:17:04,030 --> 02:17:06,900
-謝謝你 -這是你想要的，不是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Thank you. NICKY: It's what you want, isn't it?{\r}

2303
02:17:30,550 --> 02:17:31,800
艾斯的老婆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: That's Ace's wife.{\r}

2304
02:17:43,570 --> 02:17:45,230
這給老板看太好了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN 2: This is great for the boss.{\r}

2305
02:18:14,970 --> 02:18:16,170
-嗨 -嗨
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Hi. SAM: Hi.{\r}

2306
02:18:20,020 --> 02:18:22,590
-你沒回呼叫器 -我丟了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: You didn't answer your beeper. GINGER: I threw it away.{\r}

2307
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:25,020
你丟了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You threw it away?{\r}

2308
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:27,560
我試著帶著 我知道你希望我帶著…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I tried to do it. I know that you want me to, but....{\r}

2309
02:18:27,650 --> 02:18:30,440
可是我開在高速公路上時 它也在響
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm driving down the freeway and the fucking thing beeps.{\r}

2310
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:32,900
在餐館也是，很丟臉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I'm in a restaurant, it's embarrassing.{\r}

2311
02:18:32,990 --> 02:18:35,910
我不要再帶了，艾美呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy?{\r}

2312
02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:40,500
-她睡了 -我買了你要的煙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I put her to bed. GINGER: I got your cigarettes.{\r}

2313
02:18:43,590 --> 02:18:45,130
奧斯卡要你跟他連絡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Oscar wants you to call him.{\r}

2314
02:18:47,340 --> 02:18:49,880
-你跟誰吃的午餐？ -珍妮佛
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: So who'd you go to lunch with? GINGER: Jennifer.{\r}

2315
02:18:50,010 --> 02:18:52,380
-去哪兒吃？ -歐華賭場
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Where'd you go? GINGER: To the Riviera.{\r}

2316
02:18:54,260 --> 02:18:55,420
吃什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What'd you have?{\r}

2317
02:18:57,060 --> 02:18:59,130
-我叫沙拉 -珍妮佛呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: I had a salad. SAM: What did Jennifer have?{\r}

2318
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:03,220
她也一樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She had the same.{\r}

2319
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:05,470
好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.{\r}

2320
02:19:06,980 --> 02:19:09,020
我要你打給珍妮佛…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want you to call Jennifer...{\r}

2321
02:19:09,150 --> 02:19:12,360
我要你叫她告訴你 你午餐吃了什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and I want you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.{\r}

2322
02:19:12,490 --> 02:19:14,400
我從另一線聽
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm gonna listen in on the other line.{\r}

2323
02:19:15,330 --> 02:19:18,160
-你干嘛這樣？ -你知道為什么
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Why do you want to do that? -You know why I want to do it.{\r}

2324
02:19:18,750 --> 02:19:20,990
-照做就是了 -好啦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Just do it. -Fine.{\r}

2325
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:23,790
我只是需要拿個碗裝這個
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just need to get the bowl for my thing.{\r}

2326
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:33,710
忙線中
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The line's busy.{\r}

2327
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:35,040
沒人在
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}There's nobody there.{\r}

2328
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:44,810
-喂 -喂，珍妮佛，是山姆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}JENNlFER: Hello? SAM: Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.{\r}

2329
02:19:48,150 --> 02:19:50,820
好啦，我沒跟珍妮佛吃飯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}All right. I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.{\r}

2330
02:19:58,490 --> 02:19:59,610
那你跟誰？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who were you with?{\r}

2331
02:20:01,160 --> 02:20:02,360
一個人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was with somebody.{\r}

2332
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:05,660
我知道你有伴 是誰？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know you were with somebody. Who was it?{\r}

2333
02:20:14,340 --> 02:20:16,880
我只希望不是我想的那個人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.{\r}

2334
02:20:19,930 --> 02:20:22,010
我只希望不是他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I just hope it's not that.{\r}

2335
02:20:25,690 --> 02:20:27,270
我知道她在外面亂來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: I knew she fucked around.{\r}

2336
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:30,350
她做她做的 我也做我要做的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yeah, she did what she did, and I did what I had to do, but...{\r}

2337
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:34,240
可是，天啊 尼奇是她所能做出最糟糕的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.{\r}

2338
02:20:35,570 --> 02:20:36,900
若他不愿停呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}What if he won't stop?{\r}

2339
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:39,320
我們兩個可能都會沒命
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: It could get us both killed.{\r}

2340
02:20:39,910 --> 02:20:41,110
我可以讓他停
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I can back him off.{\r}

2341
02:20:45,540 --> 02:20:47,910
她在必要時可以很有說服力
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: She was very convincing when she wanted to be.{\r}

2342
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:51,000
她是這樣讓他停的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And this is how she backed him off.{\r}

2343
02:20:58,180 --> 02:20:59,210
嗨，金吉兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Hey, Ginger.{\r}

2344
02:21:00,270 --> 02:21:02,420
別忘了，要是他追問你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Don't forget, if you're challenged...{\r}

2345
02:21:02,560 --> 02:21:04,930
不管他問你什么，你都不要承認
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}if he asks anything, deny everything.{\r}

2346
02:21:05,100 --> 02:21:08,100
懂不懂？ 我不想他跟老家那頭抱怨
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You understand? I don't want him bringing beefs back home.{\r}

2347
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:10,770
這樣麻煩就大了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That could really cause a serious problem.{\r}

2348
02:21:11,690 --> 02:21:13,770
得小心點 他也不是蠢蛋，懂嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Got to be careful. He's not dumb, you know?{\r}

2349
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:15,450
你懂我的意思吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You hear what I'm saying, right?{\r}

2350
02:21:15,570 --> 02:21:17,610
我知道，你不用告訴我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know. You don't have to tell me that.{\r}

2351
02:21:17,870 --> 02:21:19,240
你當我白癡嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do you think I'm stupid?{\r}

2352
02:21:20,990 --> 02:21:22,870
我當你白癡？不
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Do I think you're stupid? No.{\r}

2353
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:26,290
我當你是美女，但我得走了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I think you're beautiful. But I gotta go.{\r}

2354
02:21:29,290 --> 02:21:32,130
這時候，尼奇在外的事已經亂到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: By this time, Nicky had things so fucked up on the streets...{\r}

2355
02:21:32,260 --> 02:21:35,790
每次瑪雷諾回老家時 皮箱都越來越小
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}that every time Marino went back home, the packages got smaller and smaller.{\r}

2356
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:41,130
后來甚至嚴重到 他每走入一個地方…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It got to the point, when he walked into the place...{\r}

2357
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:43,930
他都不確定會被親還是被殺
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he didn't know whether he was going to be kissed or killed.{\r}

2358
02:21:44,020 --> 02:21:45,970
法蘭克，我有事問你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}REMO: Frankie, I want to ask you something.{\r}

2359
02:21:47,100 --> 02:21:48,300
私人的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's private.{\r}

2360
02:21:48,690 --> 02:21:50,560
我要你說實話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But I want you to tell me the truth.{\r}

2361
02:21:51,440 --> 02:21:53,070
當然，利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Of course, Remo.{\r}

2362
02:21:53,490 --> 02:21:55,860
我要你說真話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.{\r}

2363
02:21:57,490 --> 02:21:59,230
我對你一直都很誠實，利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I always tell you the truth, Remo.{\r}

2364
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:03,030
法蘭克，小矮個…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Frankie, the little guy...{\r}

2365
02:22:03,160 --> 02:22:05,200
他不是在搞猶太人的老婆吧？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he wouldn't be fucking the Jew's wife, would he?{\r}

2366
02:22:05,330 --> 02:22:08,330
因為若他有，就是個問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Because if he is, it's a problem.{\r}

2367
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:12,700
我能說什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: What could I say?{\r}

2368
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:14,750
我知道若我答錯了…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I knew if I gave the wrong answer...{\r}

2369
02:22:14,840 --> 02:22:19,090
尼奇、金吉兒與艾斯全部 都可能被干掉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of them could have wound up getting killed.{\r}

2370
02:22:19,430 --> 02:22:21,920
因為這些老家伙們有個禁忌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Because there's one thing about these old-timers.{\r}

2371
02:22:22,100 --> 02:22:25,130
就是他們不能忍受搞別人老婆
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.{\r}

2372
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:26,730
那很難看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's bad for business.{\r}

2373
02:22:26,810 --> 02:22:30,390
所以我撒謊 雖然我知道對蓋吉撒謊…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So I lied, even though I knew that by lying to Gaggi...{\r}

2374
02:22:30,650 --> 02:22:32,520
可能會害我也被干掉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I could wind up getting killed, too.{\r}

2375
02:22:33,440 --> 02:22:37,310
-不，我沒見到這種事 -你確定？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-No, I ain't seen anything like that. -Are you sure?{\r}

2376
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:39,980
我很確定
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'm positive.{\r}

2377
02:22:40,780 --> 02:22:44,700
利蒙，那邊現在可是一團糟
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Remo, things are very fucked up down there.{\r}

2378
02:22:44,870 --> 02:22:46,740
我知道，所以我才問你
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I know. That's why I'm asking.{\r}

2379
02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:48,910
我最擔心的是尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You see, my main concern is Nicky.{\r}

2380
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:53,490
我想知道他最近如何 過得好不好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want to know if he's doing all right, if he's okay.{\r}

2381
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:59,170
-他很好 -我要你看好尼奇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He's good, he's fine. -I'm asking you to keep an eye on Nicky.{\r}

2382
02:22:59,390 --> 02:23:01,420
-為了我 -沒問題
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Do it for me. -No problem.{\r}

2383
02:23:01,850 --> 02:23:06,720
你知道，我不想得罪我們的朋友
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You see, I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for our friends.{\r}

2384
02:23:07,390 --> 02:23:08,420
你懂嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You understand?{\r}

2385
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:10,600
-我懂了 -好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I understand. -Okay.{\r}

2386
02:23:11,900 --> 02:23:13,560
法蘭克，你是個好孩子
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Frankie, you're a good boy.{\r}

2387
02:23:14,110 --> 02:23:15,350
謝了，利蒙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thanks, Remo.{\r}

2388
02:23:15,490 --> 02:23:18,320
這時，尼奇與他那幫人 已經跌到谷底了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: By now, Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.{\r}

2389
02:23:18,450 --> 02:23:20,270
賭城真的改變了他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Vegas really got to him.{\r}

2390
02:23:21,240 --> 02:23:23,610
酒精、可卡因、女人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The booze, the coke, the broads.{\r}

2391
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,540
我是說，他開始大意
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, he got sloppy.{\r}

2392
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:29,450
他再也不是以前那個尼奇了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.{\r}

2393
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:32,040
-你喝太多了 -去你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: You must've drank too much. NICKY: Fuck yourself.{\r}

2394
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:34,170
有晚他對個家伙開了三槍…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: One night, he had to belt a guy three times...{\r}

2395
02:23:34,300 --> 02:23:36,040
才將他打死
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}before the guy finally went down.{\r}

2396
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:38,880
要是以前，尼奇只要一槍就夠了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In the old days, Nicky would've decked him with one shot.{\r}

2397
02:23:39,090 --> 02:23:40,630
加上這些成份…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You add this into the mix....{\r}

2398
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:43,880
可能賭城改變了我們全部
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Maybe Vegas got to all of us.{\r}

2399
02:23:44,350 --> 02:23:46,550
他那幫人隨著他一起墮落
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}His crew followed him right over the edge.{\r}

2400
02:23:46,890 --> 02:23:49,350
他們每天一半的時間 都在吸毒中渡過
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They were all tuned up half the time on coke.{\r}

2401
02:23:49,650 --> 02:23:52,600
他們開始做些蠢事 尤其是布魯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They started doing stupid things. The worst was Blue.{\r}

2402
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:55,480
-你們要干嘛？ -警察！別下車！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-What do you guys want? -Police! Stay in the car!{\r}

2403
02:23:55,610 --> 02:23:57,650
他從不知道何時該閉嘴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: He never knew when to keep his mouth shut.{\r}

2404
02:23:57,780 --> 02:24:00,150
-放下槍！ -去你的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COP: Drop the gun! BLUE: Fuck you!{\r}

2405
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:07,280
條子朝布魯開槍…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The cops shot Blue...{\r}

2406
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:09,870
因為他們以為 他手上拿的潛艇堡是手槍
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.{\r}

2407
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:12,870
他們也許是對的 但誰知道？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They could have been right, but who knows?{\r}

2408
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:16,830
天啊，什么槍？ 他手上拿的是潛艇堡
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COP: Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a fucking hero sandwich here.{\r}

2409
02:24:17,010 --> 02:24:19,210
不然能怎樣？這兒這么黑
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COP 2: What do you want? It's pitch black.{\r}

2410
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:21,840
-是錫箔紙，看來像槍！ -你這智障！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COP 2: It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun! COP: You moron!{\r}

2411
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:24,720
-我得辦兩個月的公文！ -該怎么辦？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COP: I'll be doing paperwork for two months! COP 2: What'll we do?{\r}

2412
02:24:24,810 --> 02:24:26,350
-抱歉！ -白癡！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COP 2: Sorry! COP: You jerk-off!{\r}

2413
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:28,280
更糟的是，為了報仇
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: To make matters worse... to get even,{\r}

2414
02:24:28,280 --> 02:24:29,970
尼奇那幫人有天晚上…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky's crew got stoned one night...{\r}

2415
02:24:30,140 --> 02:24:32,390
吸毒后跑去掃射警察的家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and started shooting up the cops' houses.{\r}

2416
02:24:43,490 --> 02:24:47,070
后來嚴重到連在掏金熱潮里 都不方便講話…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It got to the point where they couldn't talk in the Gold Rush anymore...{\r}

2417
02:24:47,200 --> 02:24:49,110
因為聯邦調查局在竊聽
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}because the Feds put a wire in the wall.{\r}

2418
02:24:49,250 --> 02:24:52,250
他們連在外面講話時 都得捂住嘴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Even when they talked outside, they had to cover their mouths...{\r}

2419
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:54,490
因為聯邦調查局請來了 讀唇語的專家
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}because the Feds brought in lip readers.{\r}

2420
02:24:54,670 --> 02:24:57,460
尼奇是從一個欠他錢的 銀行職員那聽說的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Nicky found out about it from a teller who owed him money.{\r}

2421
02:24:58,340 --> 02:25:00,710
他又問我你跟猶太人老婆的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.{\r}

2422
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:03,710
走、走、走 你說什么？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?{\r}

2423
02:25:04,350 --> 02:25:06,670
他又問我你跟猶太人老婆的事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.{\r}

2424
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:08,340
你怎么說？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What'd you tell him?{\r}

2425
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:11,390
我說我不知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: I told him I didn't know nothing.{\r}

2426
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:14,970
杰葛與東尼國理拉說 你要是有做什么就完了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything, you're fucked up.{\r}

2427
02:25:16,190 --> 02:25:18,860
你想他是不是背著我回老家 跟他們抱怨？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?{\r}

2428
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:22,070
不，若有的話 你應該早聽到風聲
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: No, you would have heard something.{\r}

2429
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:25,650
-有什么阻止他這么做？ -是啊
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What's to stop him? FRANK: I know.{\r}

2430
02:25:27,910 --> 02:25:30,780
我不相信他了 但老大們不會答應我干掉他的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I don't trust him anymore, but they'd never okay anything.{\r}

2431
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:33,580
但他們一直在問
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: But they keep asking about it.{\r}

2432
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:36,920
當然會問羅 他們靠他賺錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Sure they're asking. They earn with the prick.{\r}

2433
02:25:38,880 --> 02:25:41,720
我有種感覺 他好像想引發戰爭
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I got a funny feeling he's gonna start a war or something.{\r}

2434
02:25:43,890 --> 02:25:46,920
我還不確定 但你知道我要你干嘛嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I'm not sure yet. But you know what I want you to do?{\r}

2435
02:25:47,060 --> 02:25:48,250
這是誰？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Who's this guy?{\r}

2436
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:51,300
誰都不是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: That ain't nobody.{\r}

2437
02:25:51,850 --> 02:25:53,510
你知道我要你干嘛嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: You know what I want you to do?{\r}

2438
02:25:54,100 --> 02:25:57,520
找個人在沙漠挖個洞 要他告訴你在哪兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Get some guys to dig a hole in the desert and show you where it's at.{\r}

2439
02:25:58,820 --> 02:26:01,650
-安基羅與本斯特 -我還不確定
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: Angelo and Buster. NICKY: I'm not sure yet.{\r}

2440
02:26:02,070 --> 02:26:04,820
-他們肯干的 -我準備好時會跟你說…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: They'll do it. NICKY: When I'm ready, I'll say the words:{\r}

2441
02:26:04,950 --> 02:26:08,650
“去找猶太人” 然后你就讓他消失，懂不懂？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}"Go see the Jew." And you make it disappear. Know what I mean?{\r}

2442
02:26:08,910 --> 02:26:10,490
讓我知道，但你得準備好
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: Let me know. But you gotta be ready.{\r}

2443
02:26:10,620 --> 02:26:12,410
你懂我的意思嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: You know what I'm talking about?{\r}

2444
02:26:13,870 --> 02:26:15,250
我有叫你行動嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Did I say to do anything yet?{\r}

2445
02:26:15,330 --> 02:26:16,800
我說了我不確定，我會讓你知道
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I said I'm not sure. I'll let you know.{\r}

2446
02:26:16,950 --> 02:26:18,420
我得再想想
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I want to think about it.{\r}

2447
02:26:18,920 --> 02:26:21,710
那些渾蛋呢？ 在旅館里嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Where are these pricks at? They're in the motel?{\r}

2448
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:25,040
那里或是銀行 我也不知道，到處都是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: There or in the fucking bank. I don't know. All over the joint.{\r}

2449
02:26:49,990 --> 02:26:51,160
我馬上回來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I'll be right back.{\r}

2450
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,700
有我的電話就轉給雪伯提先生
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Any calls for me, give them to Mr. Sherbert.{\r}

2451
02:26:56,830 --> 02:27:00,040
-好的，羅斯坦先生 -我回家一會兒
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Sure, Mr. Rothstein. -I'm going home for a few seconds.{\r}

2452
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:10,250
他要回家了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's on his way home.{\r}

2453
02:27:11,930 --> 02:27:14,140
好的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Okay.{\r}

2454
02:27:23,150 --> 02:27:25,940
喂？金吉兒？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Hello? Ginger?{\r}

2455
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:28,810
-爸爸，救命！ -艾美！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AMY: Help, Daddy! SAM: Amy!{\r}

2456

{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}paradise. We managed to really fuck it up.{\r}

2658
02:40:21,770 --> 02:40:25,020
-媽 -門口他媽的有人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY JR.: Mom. JENNIFER: Someone's at the door now.{\r}

2659
02:40:25,150 --> 02:40:27,310
聯邦調查局，我們有搜查令
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FBI. We have a federal search warrant.{\r}

2660
02:40:27,450 --> 02:40:30,480
我馬上知道苗頭不對 所以我跑路了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: I got wind of the pinches coming down, so I took off.{\r}

2661
02:40:30,620 --> 02:40:32,530
誰要待在那兒找麻煩啊？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Who needs to hang around for that bullshit?{\r}

2662
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:34,780
-我是馬克凱斯伯，FBI -是嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-I'm Mark Casper, FBI. -Yeah?{\r}

2663
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:36,500
我可以打個電話嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Can I make a fucking phone call?{\r}

2664
02:40:36,620 --> 02:40:39,110
可以，但你不用這樣對我們講話
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yes, but you don't have to talk to us like that.{\r}

2665
02:40:39,210 --> 02:40:42,210
大家都出去 往警鈴的方向走
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FBI AGENT: Everybody, out of the room. Over to the alarm.{\r}

2666
02:40:42,300 --> 02:40:45,750
-其他人似乎都被抓了 -這地方被查封了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: They got almost everybody else. FBI AGENT: This area is seized!{\r}

2667
02:40:46,130 --> 02:40:49,670
-去拿總戶頭單 -我要查封所有的文件
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Get the master account list. -I want all those papers seized.{\r}

2668
02:40:53,640 --> 02:40:55,760
將每個箱子都放到桌上
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FBI AGENT: Put every box on the table.{\r}

2669
02:41:02,690 --> 02:41:05,730
好，在這兒，所有的數字
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Yes. Here we are. Little craps figures.{\r}

2670
02:41:06,440 --> 02:41:07,990
葛林？別提了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Green? Don't even ask.{\r}

2671
02:41:08,070 --> 02:41:10,820
-你的三萬元 -不，所以不成立
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-...$30,000 of yours. -No. That's why it wasn't valid.{\r}

2672
02:41:10,950 --> 02:41:14,150
我是被敲詐的 你們想知道什么就問我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I was being extorted. I'll tell you what you want to know.{\r}

2673
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:16,320
-我不需要隱藏 -最經典的是
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}PHlLlP: I've got nothing to hide. NICKY: Now for the best.{\r}

2674
02:41:16,410 --> 02:41:20,790
我不敢相信派斯康的花費記錄 竟然成了關鍵
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I couldn't believe this shit. Piscano's expense reports took the cake.{\r}

2675
02:41:20,920 --> 02:41:24,290
-這太好了 -他干脆就把藍圖給他們算了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, this is good. NICKY: He might as well give them a blueprint.{\r}

2676
02:41:24,380 --> 02:41:27,580
所有人的名字、地址、日期 一切都在上面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Everybody's names, addresses, dates, everything.{\r}

2677
02:41:28,010 --> 02:41:31,380
真是多謝你了，派斯康先生 你真是體帖
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano. How considerate of you.{\r}

2678
02:41:31,510 --> 02:41:34,260
-那是我媽的賬目 -你被逮捕了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Those are my mother's books. -You're under arrest.{\r}

2679
02:41:34,350 --> 02:41:36,840
-真是個蠢才 -你在干嘛？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What a fucking balloon head. ARTIE: What are you doing?{\r}

2680
02:41:36,980 --> 02:41:39,100
-冷靜點 -等一下！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}AGENT: Take it easy. WIFE: Wait!{\r}

2681
02:41:39,310 --> 02:41:41,180
-等一下，他有病！ -走開
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}WIFE: Wait! He's sick! COP: Move back.{\r}

2682
02:41:41,440 --> 02:41:43,560
-是心臟，還呼吸嗎？ -快人工呼吸！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}WIFE: It's his heart! Is he breathing? COP 2: CPR now!{\r}

2683
02:41:43,900 --> 02:41:45,890
艾提被搞到心臟病發…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Artie got so upset he had a heart attack...{\r}

2684
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:48,100
當他老婆的面就掛了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and dropped dead right in front of his wife.{\r}

2685
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:50,320
-冷靜點！ -我無法冷靜！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Calm down! -No, I won't calm down!{\r}

2686
02:41:50,410 --> 02:41:52,610
-他是我丈夫，艾提！ -我們也不能…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-He's my husband! Artie! -We can't help him if--{\r}

2687
02:41:56,580 --> 02:41:57,910
最后…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: At the end of the day...{\r}

2688
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:00,490
他們終于拿照片來給我看
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they finally came to see me with the pictures.{\r}

2689
02:42:00,620 --> 02:42:03,160
為什么要保護一個背叛你的朋友？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FBI AGENT: Why protect a friend who betrayed you?{\r}

2690
02:42:03,290 --> 02:42:05,170
但我并不想看它們…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: But I didn't want to look at them...{\r}

2691
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:06,750
或是拿照片來的人
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}or the guys who brought them.{\r}

2692
02:42:10,470 --> 02:42:11,710
大人，你可看見，
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COUNSELOR: Your Honor, as you can see,{\r}

2693
02:42:11,710 --> 02:42:13,880
我的客戶們 都年事已大并生病
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}my clients are elderly and infirm.{\r}

2694
02:42:14,050 --> 02:42:17,140
任何的刑責都將會 嚴重威脅到他們的健康
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COUNSELOR: Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.{\r}

2695
02:42:17,310 --> 02:42:19,510
當老大們被逮時 有些簡直老到…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: When they were arrested, some were so old...{\r}

2696
02:42:19,640 --> 02:42:21,430
罪狀認否程序時都需要醫師
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they needed doctors at their arraignment.{\r}

2697
02:42:21,560 --> 02:42:24,650
預審時建議將保釋金額 維持現額
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}COUNSELOR: Pre-trial services recommends that bail remain as set.{\r}

2698
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:27,350
-現在休庭 -當情況看來他們似乎…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}JUDGE: Take recess. NICKY: When it looked like they'd get...{\r}

2699
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:30,480
得為了抽頭而關上25年時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}25 years to life in prison just for skimming a casino...{\r}

2700
02:42:30,570 --> 02:42:33,770
不管有病沒病 總有人要倒霉
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}sick or no fucking sick, you knew people were going to get clipped.{\r}

2701
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:36,520
所以在罪狀認否程序那天
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So the day of the arraignment,{\r}

2702
02:42:36,820 --> 02:42:39,330
他們在法庭后頭開會
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse.{\r}

2703
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:41,580
當類似的事發生時
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}When something like this happens,{\r}

2704
02:42:41,580 --> 02:42:43,620
你已知道事情會怎樣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}you know how things are gonna work out.{\r}

2705
02:42:43,750 --> 02:42:48,040
最好是不要有目擊者 那安迪呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's always better with no witnesses. So what about Andy?{\r}

2706
02:42:48,130 --> 02:42:50,970
他不會說的，史東是好家伙
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.{\r}

2707
02:42:51,260 --> 02:42:53,220
跟他老爸一樣帶種
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Stand-up guy just like his old man.{\r}

2708
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:55,170
我是這么想的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}That's the way I see it.{\r}

2709
02:42:55,430 --> 02:42:58,800
我同意，他很強悍
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I agree. He's solid. He's a fucking Marine.{\r}

2710
02:42:59,560 --> 02:43:03,510
他沒問題，一直都是 你說呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's okay. He always was. What do you think?{\r}

2711
02:43:05,360 --> 02:43:09,100
為什么要冒險呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Look, why take a chance?{\r}

2712
02:43:11,490 --> 02:43:13,530
我是這么想的啦
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}At least that's the way I feel about it.{\r}

2713
02:43:14,450 --> 02:43:17,650
打給艾提，告訴他不管怎樣…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}ANDY: Call Artie. Tell him I don't care what...{\r}

2714
02:43:17,790 --> 02:43:19,820
他星期四都得來我辦公室
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning.{\r}

2715
02:43:19,950 --> 02:43:20,950
決定了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's done.{\r}

2716
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:24,030
非常重要 我一定得跟他談談
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's terribly important. I gotta have a conversation with him.{\r}

2717
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:35,010
不管他們多喜歡他 他還不是家族一員
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: As much as they liked him, he wasn't one of us.{\r}

2718
02:43:35,140 --> 02:43:38,390
他不是意大利人 對他們來說，他隨時可能供出來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew, he could have talked.{\r}

2719
02:43:38,520 --> 02:43:40,760
要不然他可能還活著
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Otherwise, he'd still be alive.{\r}

2720
02:43:41,810 --> 02:43:44,600
哥斯大黎加

2721
02:43:45,360 --> 02:43:47,640
第一個翹頭的就是約翰南斯
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The first one to skip was John Nance.{\r}

2722
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:50,810
他在哥斯大黎加 找了個又好又隱密的地方
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He found a nice, warm, secluded place in Costa Rica.{\r}

2723
02:43:51,030 --> 02:43:53,100
他以為沒人找得到他
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He thought nobody would find him there.{\r}

2724
02:44:14,380 --> 02:44:17,300
但他孩子隨后因犯毒 被聯邦調查局逮了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.{\r}

2725
02:44:17,430 --> 02:44:20,510
老大們當然怕他會出現…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding...{\r}

2726
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:22,850
為了救孩子而把大家供出來
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}just to save his kid and give them all up.{\r}

2727
02:44:23,770 --> 02:44:24,880
所以…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So....{\r}

2728
02:44:27,770 --> 02:44:29,430
你想去哪里？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Where you going, jag-off?{\r}

2729
02:44:31,490 --> 02:44:33,640
但大家都得跟著
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: But, anyway, they all had to follow.{\r}

2730
02:44:33,740 --> 02:44:35,200
大家都完了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Everybody went down.{\r}

2731
02:44:35,280 --> 02:44:36,560
去你的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Fuck you.{\r}

2732
02:44:42,250 --> 02:44:43,440
不知不覺…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Before you knew it...{\r}

2733
02:44:43,540 --> 02:44:45,990
任何知道一點小事的人 都被干掉了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}anybody who knew anything wound up getting whacked.{\r}

2734
02:44:54,930 --> 02:44:56,300
不！不！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}GINGER: Oh, no! No!{\r}

2735
02:45:02,270 --> 02:45:04,800
金吉兒走后 她對任何人都沒什么用
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody.{\r}

2736
02:45:04,940 --> 02:45:08,640
她在洛杉磯結識了一些 皮條客、敗類、毒蟲與飛車黨
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}She found some pimps, lowlifes, druggies, and bikers in L.A.{\r}

2737
02:45:08,940 --> 02:45:11,890
幾個月內，他們就把 所有的錢跟珠寶花光了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In a few months, they went through all the money and jewels.{\r}

2738
02:45:38,340 --> 02:45:39,920
當他們找到遺體時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}After they found her body...{\r}

2739
02:45:40,760 --> 02:45:43,050
我私下請了個醫生驗尸
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I had a private doctor do another autopsy.{\r}

2740
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:49,180
他說他們給她打了過量的毒品
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He said they gave her a hot dose.{\r}

2741
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:54,600
最終，她身上只剩下 價值三千六百元的全新硬幣
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In the end, all she had left was $3, 600 in mint condition coins.{\r}

2742
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:19,960
不管條子與文件 對我的汽車炸彈有什么評論…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No matter what the Feds or the papers said about my car bombing...{\r}

2743
02:46:21,890 --> 02:46:23,930
一看就知道是新手干的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}it was amateur night, you could tell.{\r}

2744
02:46:24,140 --> 02:46:27,810
不管是誰，他們將炸彈裝在 副駕駛座下面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side.{\r}

2745
02:46:27,940 --> 02:46:31,550
他們不知道的是 除了車廠外沒人知道的是…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew...{\r}

2746
02:46:31,860 --> 02:46:36,070
那臺車的駕駛座下 多加了一塊鐵板
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}was that, that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat.{\r}

2747
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:39,190
全靠了它救我一命
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}It's the only thing that saved my life.{\r}

2748
02:46:51,960 --> 02:46:56,170
那炸彈從沒被批準 但我想我知道是誰干的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.{\r}

2749
02:46:57,590 --> 02:46:59,420
老大們也知道吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So did the powers that be.{\r}

2750
02:46:59,640 --> 02:47:01,340
-你好嗎？ -你好嗎？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: How are you? BOSS: How you doing?{\r}

2751
02:47:01,430 --> 02:47:03,500
好幾個月后一切才平息
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: It took months for everything to calm down.{\r}

2752
02:47:03,760 --> 02:47:06,090
但我的人終于保釋出來了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}But finally, my guys got out on bail.{\r}

2753
02:47:06,230 --> 02:47:09,720
老大們要我將我小弟 多明尼送回賭城
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.{\r}

2754
02:47:09,850 --> 02:47:12,890
永遠都是為了錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Always the fucking dollars.{\r}

2755
02:47:13,270 --> 02:47:16,810
我是說，我連賭城都不能踏入
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I mean, it was still too hot for me to even go near Vegas.{\r}

2756
02:47:16,940 --> 02:47:19,570
所以我在個鳥不生蛋的地方 安排大家碰面
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.{\r}

2757
02:47:19,700 --> 02:47:22,900
我不想害我小弟 對的就是對的
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I didn't want my brother to get fucked around. What's right is right.{\r}

2758
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:24,660
他們才不在乎…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They don't give a fuck about--{\r}

2759
02:47:26,250 --> 02:47:27,870
去你媽的…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}THUG: Holy fucking....{\r}

2760
02:47:28,710 --> 02:47:29,990
搞什么…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: What the fuck....{\r}

2761
02:47:30,120 --> 02:47:32,000
來啊，王八蛋！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Come on, motherfucker!{\r}

2762
02:47:33,170 --> 02:47:36,170
不是很猛嗎？你跟你哥！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Tough guys! You and your fucking brother!{\r}

2763
02:47:36,460 --> 02:47:39,550
你們兩個渾蛋！夠了！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}You fucking scumbags! No more!{\r}

2764
02:47:42,510 --> 02:47:46,130
-法蘭克！ -夠了！你看著！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}-Frankie! -No more! You see? Watch!{\r}

2765
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:52,800
-法蘭克！你這王八蛋！ -去你的！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Frankie! You piece of shit! FRANK: Fuck you!{\r}

2766
02:47:53,690 --> 02:47:57,110
王八羔子！狗雜種！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Fucking punk! Piece of shit!{\r}

2767
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:01,780
不！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}No!{\r}

2768
02:48:02,070 --> 02:48:04,070
把這渾蛋拖走！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Take this motherfucker out!{\r}

2769
02:48:11,750 --> 02:48:14,450
別搞他了，他還活著

2770
02:48:14,840 --> 02:48:17,960
他還在呼吸 別搞他了，法蘭克
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}He's still breathing. Leave him alone. Frankie.{\r}

2771
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:25,090
好了，脫他衣服
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: All right. Strip him.{\r}

2772
02:48:25,890 --> 02:48:28,760
沒種，你真他媽的沒種
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: No balls. You got no fucking balls.{\r}

2773
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:30,980
多明尼！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Oh, Dominick!{\r}

2774
02:48:38,650 --> 02:48:40,030
多明尼
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}NICKY: Dominick.{\r}

2775
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:05,090
來吧
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}FRANK: Come on.{\r}

2776
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:09,970
-埋了他們？ -埋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}THUG: Bury them? FRANK: Bury them.{\r}

2777
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:14,640
話放出去了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The word was out.{\r}

2778
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:17,350
老大們受夠了尼奇 受夠了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}The bosses had enough of Nicky. They had enough.{\r}

2779
02:49:17,650 --> 02:49:22,230
他們還能忍受多久呢？ 所以拿他們兄弟倆殺雞儆猴
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}How much were they gonna take? So they made an example of him and his brother.{\r}

2780
02:49:23,360 --> 02:49:25,740
他們倆被活埋
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}They buried them while they were still breathing.{\r}

2781
02:49:43,380 --> 02:49:45,420
你還好嗎？小心！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: You all right? Watch out!{\r}

2782
02:49:51,060 --> 02:49:53,300
-先生，你沒事吧？ -沒事
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MAN: Mister, you all right? SAM: Yeah.{\r}

2783
02:49:55,100 --> 02:49:56,760
他們有別的事給我做
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: They had other ideas for me.{\r}

2784
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:08,700
我們這兒需要幫忙！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MEDIC: We need some help over here!{\r}

2785
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:11,900
你真是幸運
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}MEDIC 2: You sure are lucky, mister.{\r}

2786
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:32,630
這城市再也不一樣了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: The town will never be the same.{\r}

2787
02:50:33,350 --> 02:50:37,100
在坦吉樂之后，大集團全權掌管
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}After the Tangiers, the big corporations took it all over.{\r}

2788
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:39,650
今日的賭城像是迪斯奈樂園
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Today it looks like Disneyland.{\r}

2789
02:50:47,870 --> 02:50:49,910
孩子們玩著海盜游戲時…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}While the kids play cardboard pirates...{\r}

2790
02:50:50,040 --> 02:50:53,400
爸爸與媽媽將房貸與大學學費…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments and junior's college money...{\r}

2791
02:50:53,540 --> 02:50:55,280
浪費在吃角子老虎機
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}on the poker slots.{\r}

2792
02:50:59,630 --> 02:51:03,160
想當年，莊家知道你的名字 喝什么酒，玩什么牌
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}In the old days, dealers knew your name, what you drank, what you played.{\r}

2793
02:51:03,260 --> 02:51:05,300
今天就像是在機場登記一般
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Today, it's like checking into an airport.{\r}

2794
02:51:05,470 --> 02:51:08,670
你要是叫客房送餐 星期四給你送到就了不起了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}If you order room service, you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.{\r}

2795
02:51:10,010 --> 02:51:13,380
都沒了，一個人拎著 裝著四百萬的皮箱…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Today it's all gone. A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase...{\r}

2796
02:51:13,480 --> 02:51:17,850
就有個25歲的旅游系大學畢業生 想要他的身份字號
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and some 25-year-old hotel school kid will want his Social Security number.{\r}

2797
02:51:19,940 --> 02:51:22,100
全美卡車司機工會離開后…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}After the Teamsters got knocked out of the box...{\r}

2798
02:51:22,190 --> 02:51:25,610
大集團幾乎將所有的舊賭場都拆了
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}the corporations tore down practically every one of the old casinos.{\r}

2799
02:51:26,530 --> 02:51:29,400
而蓋新金字塔的錢是從哪來的呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids?{\r}

2800
02:51:30,450 --> 02:51:31,950
垃圾債券
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}Junk bonds.{\r}

2801
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:35,990
圣地牙哥

2802
02:51:37,420 --> 02:51:38,960
還不確定？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Still not sure?{\r}

2803
02:51:39,630 --> 02:51:41,500
有可能，有些質疑
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: Probable. Maybe questionable.{\r}

2804
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:44,080
好吧，知道后立即通知我
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: All right, let me know as soon as you can find out.{\r}

2805
02:51:45,470 --> 02:51:48,590
最后，我又回到了起點
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}SAM: In the end, I wound up right back where I started.{\r}

2806
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:50,470
我還是會選贏家…
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}I could still pick winners...{\r}

2807
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:53,880
也還是可以為老家 各式各樣的人賺錢
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.{\r}

2808
02:51:54,060 --> 02:51:55,680
何必搞砸好事呢？
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And why mess up a good thing?{\r}

2809
02:51:57,150 --> 02:51:58,770
就是這樣！
{\fn微軟雅黑}{\fs14}And that's that!{\r}
