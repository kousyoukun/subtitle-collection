- Yeah, hi.

311

I actually couldn't find
a lot about you online.

Although, I do know
you were an orphan and

313
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,402
you were in and out of foster
care your entire childhood,

314
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,737
and that you didn't know
the meaning of family

315
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,405

with these two.

and subway stop in the city.

was advanced. Good dexterity.

617
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,357
People just believe she did.

618
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,826
Really?
That's kind of interesting.

619
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,427
So it was not the mob
that killed her,

620
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,662
and it was
not the guillotine,

621
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,463
it was a... a story.

622

I must not know
my own guest list.

Are you
in the diamond business?

(CHUCKLES) No, no, I'm in the

626

diamonds were worthless

627
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,943
until some very smart,
very rich people

628
00:25:43,976 --> 00:25:46,178
like Veronika here,
told us that, not only

629
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,514
are these little shards
of glass rare,

630
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,216
but that
no self-respecting couple

631
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,584
could possibly get married
without one.

632
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,820
No, now, that one is
a good magic trick.

(CHUCKLES)

634
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,488
The problem
with the trick is, um...

635
00:25:56,522 --> 00:25:59,091
(QUIETLY) All the good ones
have a little twist in the tale.

Is what me?

638
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,800
- Of course not.
- No, no.

639
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:09,736
I mean, you wouldn't have let
me in had I not demonstrated

640

the finest moral fiber, like
some of your other guests.

641

the arms dealer over there.

monopolizing her state media.

Perhaps you'd care
to reveal yourself.

but I don't think that
that should stop me

from having an opinion
about what we do next.

No, it shouldn't, Atlas.

expose Vanessa.

No, no! It is too dangerous!
