1
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,372
骑士们！骑士们！
Horsemen! Horsemen!

2
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:41,275
骑士们！骑士们！
Horsemen! Horsemen!

3
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,114
骑士们！骑士们！骑士们！骑士们！
Horsemen! Horsemen! Horsemen! Horsemen!

4
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,217
你是否以为我们抛弃了你？
Did you think we abandoned you?

5
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,324
还是说我们的魔法会用尽？
Or that we'd run out of magic?

6
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:01,329
各位女士先生们，请再想一想，因为你们即将见证令人惊叹的一幕。
Well, think again, ladies and gentlemen, because you are about to be amazed.

7
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:08,236
如果你现在身处此地，那么你已经循着线索破解了密码。
If you're here right now, then you have followed the clues and cracked the code.

8
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,039
祝贺你，欢迎你的到来。
Congratulations, and welcome.

9
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:20,114
四骑士已经 10 年未露面了，但如今我们回归了！
It's been 10 years since the horseman last appeared, but we are back!

10
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:27,221
好，那么，靠过来，再近些。
Okay, so, come in close. Mm, closer.

11
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:32,926
因为你们以为看到的越多，就越容易给旧把戏换个包装，当成新花样来愚弄你们。
Because the more you think you see, the easier it will be to dress up old tricks and fool you that they are new.

12
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:43,937
我是 J·丹尼尔·阿特拉斯，请允许我像往常一样，为那些不那么有魅力的同伴们说句...呼！能回归真是太棒了！
So, my name is J. Daniel Atlas, and allow me to speak as I often do for my less charismatic colleagues when I say... Whoo! It is very good to be back!

13
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:54,081
对，对。我们消失了一段时间，但在魔术的世界里，一切消失的东西都会重新出现。
Yes. Yes. We vanished for a while, but in the world of magic, everything that disappears, reappears.

14
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,049
至少，如果魔术表演得完美的话。
Well, at least if the trick is done right.

15
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,956
我是梅里特·麦金尼。
I'm Merritt McKinney.

16
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:10,398
与我这，呃，这里的好朋友丹尼不同，今晚在场的各位大多数都把自我留在了门外。
Unlike my, uh, very good buddy here, Danny, most of you checked your egos at the door tonight.

17
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:16,304
你找到这个小型的秘密聚会，不就是因为你想被愚弄一番吗。
You found this little underground soiree because you wanted to get fooled.

18
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:18,206
大家好，我是杰克·怀尔德。
Hey, everyone. I'm Jack Wilder.

19
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,913
战争、流行病、气候变化、人工智能。
Wars, pandemics, climate change, AI.

20
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:28,916
我们得承认，现在比以往任何时候，我们都更需要魔法。
Let's face it, we all need magic more than ever.

21
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:33,421
所以我希望你全神贯注地倾听。
So I want you to pay very close attention.

22
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:35,623
接下来的这个戏法你绝对不想错过。
You are not gonna want to miss this next trick.

23
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,730
亨丽·里夫斯，现在的亨丽·里夫斯·斯坦利。
Henley Reeves, now Henley Reeves Stanley.

24
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:45,799
三个孩子，两条狗，还有一个硕士学位。
Three kids, two dogs and a master's degree.

25
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,134
好久不见。
It's been a while.

26
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,336
想我们了吗？
Did you miss us?

27
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,841
当年那些家伙可厉害了。
Those guys were great back in the day.

28
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,776
我曾经想当个魔术师。
I used to want to be a magician.

29
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,246
而后我年满十二。
And then I turned 12.

30
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:00,781
小心点，他们可能在监听。
Careful, they might be listening.

31
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,416
哎哟，吓得我连全身毛孔都在颤抖。
Ooh, I'm shaking in my AllSaints.

32
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,652
他们还能怎样？
What are they gonna do?

33
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,354
那是真金吗？
Is that real gold?

34
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,489
- 什么？ - 那是真金吗？
- What? - Is that real gold?

35
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,758
是的，我发财了。
Yeah, I'm rich.

36
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,926
老兄，这是魔术表演。
This is a magic show, dude.

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,196
这里每一个蠢货都是扒手，或是扒手的棋子。
Every fool here is a pickpocket, or a pickpocket's fool.

38
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,001
- 那是一首俳句吗？ - 刚才那是什么？
- Was that a haiku? - What was that?

39
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,636
各位刚刚都收到了一张扑克牌。
Each of you just received a playing card.

40
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,539
如果你们不介意，呃，能否把它抽出来？
If you wouldn't mind, uh, pulling it out?

41
00:03:25,573 --> 00:03:31,812
好的。现在，我们来洗牌，所以每个人找身边随机的人交换卡片。
Right. Now, we're gonna shuffle the deck, so everybody find a random person near them and switch cards with them.

42
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:36,049
完成之后，再找另一个人交换卡片。
And then when you've done that, find somebody else and switch with them.

43
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,820
好极了。嗯，现在……嗯，duh-duh-duh-duh-duh... 你那儿，下面的那位。
Okay, great. Uh, now... Uh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh... You there, down there.

44
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,522
- 我吗？- 是的。你手上的牌是什么？
- Me? - Yeah. What is your card?

45
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,024
- 方块 A。 - 方块 A。好的。
- Ace of diamonds. - Ace of diamonds. Okay.

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,859
让我们把情况弄得稍微复杂一点。
Let's make things a little more complicated here.

47
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,962
这里有其他人拿到方块 A 了吗？
Does anybody else here have the ace of diamonds?

48
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,831
等等，是我。方块 A！
Wait, it's me. Ace of diamonds!

49
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,901
哦！
Ooh!

50
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,237
看来我们有了第五位骑士，而且不是卢拉。
Looks like we have a Fifth Horseman not named Lula.

51
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,007
上台来，你将担任我们的助手。
Come up on stage, you're gonna be our helper.

52
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,413
- 快去！ - 对，上去！
- Do it! - Yeah, go!

53
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:16,590
现在，呃，看着我的眼睛……睡吧。
Now, uh, look into my eyes and... sleep.

54
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,360
宝刀未老。
Still got it.

55
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:28,268
现在，在你看来这可能只是个普通孩子，但今晚，他会像被附身一般，施展出非凡的魔法。
Now, this might look like an ordinary kid to you, but tonight, he is going to do extraordinary magic like a man possessed.

56
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,603
是真的被附身了。
Literally.

57
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,605
- 亨利。 - 在，梅里特。
- Henley. - Yes, Merritt.

58
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,108
你愿意附身到他体内吗？
Would you mind stepping inside his body?

59
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,581
好的。杰克，呃，要不你也一块儿进来？
Yep. And, Jack, uh, why don't you throw yourself on in there, too?

60
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,282
这可是我的拿手好戏。
What I do best.

61
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:45,686
而且...噢，天呐，上帝保佑你吧。
And... Oh, God help you.

62
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:48,656
阿特拉斯，你何不也悄悄溜进去呢？
Atlas, why don't you slither on inside, as well?

63
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,395
要不，我索性也把自己塞进去好了。
And I might as well wedge myself in there, too.

64
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:57,030
创造魔法，需要众人的力量。
It takes a village to make magic.

65
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,772
- 噢！ - 哇哦！
- Oh! - Whoa!

66
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,540
J·丹尼尔·阿特拉斯在此登场。
J. Daniel Atlas in the house.

67
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,476
那么，谁想欣赏一场魔术表演呢？
So, who wants to see a magic trick?

68
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,648
交给你了，梅里特。
Take it away, Merritt.

69
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,787
你好，各位靓丽的伙伴。
Hello, you beautiful people.

70
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,090
大家都知道，梅里特·麦金尼拥有读心术。
Now, everyone knows that Merritt McKinney reads minds.

71
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:27,260
那么，现在，我成了他。或者说他成了我。谁知道呢？
Well, now, I'm him. Or he's me. Who knows?

72
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:36,303
呃，我感应到今晚有人来此并非为了欣赏魔术，而是为了将其拆穿。
Uh, I'm sensing someone came here tonight not to enjoy magic, but to tear it down.

73
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:40,641
现场有布雷特·芬尼根在吗？
Is there a Brett Finnegan in the house?

74
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,610
什么事？
What up?

75
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:51,284
现在，你和你的朋友们在这里设立了霍巴特营加密交易所。
Now, you and your friends here set up the Camp Hobart Crypto Exchange.

76
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:52,953
- 确实如此。没错。是的。- 这正是我们所做的。
- Fact. Yep. Yeah. - It's what we're about.

77
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:57,625
吞下了纽约百姓养老金和福利基金里一半的现金。
Took the good people of New York's employee pension and welfare fund half its cash.

78
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,862
你在夸大其词，而且风险都说得明明白白。
Uh, you're rounding up, and also, the risks were laid out very clearly.

79
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,764
大家心里都清楚自己在干什么，老兄。
Everybody knew what they were getting into, dude.

80
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:05,999
你把利润藏到海外去了吗？
Did you hide the profits offshore?

81
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:13,040
尾号为 53297 的账户？
Account ending in 53297?

82
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,243
你不可能知道这个，除非通过我的...
You couldn't know that without my, uh...

83
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:20,313
哦，这真的是黄金吗？
Oh, is this real gold?

84
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,652
布雷特，伙计，你对自己的东西应该更小心点。
Brett, you ought to be more careful with your things, man.

85
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:27,955
梅瑞特能心灵感应，而我杰克，更擅长近景魔术。
Merritt's a psychic, but me, Jack, I'm into sleight of hand.

86
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,322
问问你的朋友们。
Ask your friends.

87
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,692
他们刚刚为缩小贫富差距出了自己的一份力。
They've just done their part to close the wealth gap.

88
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:36,564
什么？搞什么……现在，来一点重新分配。
What? What the... Now, here's a little redistribution.

89
00:06:36,597 --> 00:06:38,131
喂！喂，喂！
Hey! Hey, hey!

90
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,037
多谢。多谢。
Thank you. Thank you.

91
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,372
等着瞧吧，小子！我揍扁你！
Lawyer up, dude! I'll kick your ass!

92
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,974
啊哦！
Uh-oh!

93
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:49,577
有人忘了亨利会飞。
Someone forgot Henley can fly.

94
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:06,527
这里可以交给我们了，但让我们为舞台上最棒的骑士鼓掌。
We can take it from here, but a round of applause for the best Horseman on stage.

95
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,196
哇！太棒了。
Whoo! Wow.

96
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,631
嘿，嘿，嘿。嘿，嘿。
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

97
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:16,504
太棒了。那么，各位，请大家拿起你们的饮料，把它倒在你们的卡片上。
Fantastic. So, everybody, I want you to take your drink, and I want you to pour it onto the face of your card.

98
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,872
能做到吗？
Can you do that?

99
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:24,044
每张卡片上的 12 个独特词汇构成了你们新加密钱包的密码。
Those 12 unique words on each of your cards form the password to your new crypto wallet.

100
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:29,617
- 哦！ - 登录后，你们会发现布雷特窃取的数百万资产已...公平地重新分配。
- Oh! - Log on and you'll find Brett's stolen millions more... fairly redistributed.

101
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,120
天啊，五万……五万块钱！
Oh, my God. Fifty... 50,000 bucks!

102
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,588
五万！
50,000!

103
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,392
你完蛋了，伙计！
You're freaking done, dude!

104
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:44,064
哇，哇！冷静点，姜饼人，因为我有个预感。
Whoa, whoa! Cool your head, gingerbread, 'cause I am having a vision.

105
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:48,135
呃，说不定警察会破门而入呢！
Eh, maybe cops are gonna come bursting through that door!

106
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:53,707
所以不如变个你自己的魔术，三、二、一，消失吧。
So perform a magic trick of your own and disappear in three, two, one.

107
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:12,225
现在靠近点。嗯，再近些。
Now come in close. Mm, closer.

108
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,229
因为你看到的越多，就越容易——把老把戏乔装打扮……- 什么？
Because the more you think you see, the easier it will be - to dress up old tricks... - What?

109
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,798
……并让你误以为它们是全新的。
...and fool you that they are new.

110
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,934
哦，天哪，不行。
Oh, my God, no.

111
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,736
不行！
No!

112
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,605
不行！
No!

113
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:43,356
我认为，你做得很出色。
Look, in my opinion, I think you did a great job.

114
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,192
我觉得我的阿特拉斯表现得不错。
Uh, I think my Atlas was good.

115
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,526
我的梅里特可能需要改进。
My Merritt could probably use some work.

116
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,463
- 嗯。- 就像圣地亚哥的瘾君子和虾船船长生了个孩子。
- Mm. - It's like a San Diego stoner and a shrimp boat captain had a baby.

117
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,965
没问题。
Sure.

118
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:53,967
不，说真的，波斯可，我真不知道你是怎么做到的。
No, seriously, Bosco, I don't know how you do it.

119
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,136
出色的模仿不只是单纯的模仿。
A good impersonation isn't just about the mimicry.

120
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,773
关键在于对细节、性格和微妙之处的把握。
It's about attention to detail, personality and nuance.

121
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,441
好的。好的。让我试试，让我来试试。
Okay. Okay. Let me try, let me try.

122
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,977
- 嗯……- 我是 J·丹尼尔·阿特拉斯。
- Um... - I'm J. Daniel Atlas.

123
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:06,947
看得越近，反而越视而不见。
The closer you look, the less you see.

124
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,048
多少是有点收获的。
It was something.

125
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,516
是的。嗯，你来处理吧。
Yep. Uh, you'll work on it.

126
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,718
- 我表现得还不错。- 这算是个好的开端。
- I wasn't bad. - It was a good start.

127
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,586
- 不过还有改进空间。- 好的，没问题。
- But it could use some work. - Okay, sure.

128
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,387
- 你一直盯着看什么呢？- 没什么，没什么，没什么。
- What do you keep looking at? - Nothing, nothing, nothing.

129
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:17,357
兄弟，打起精神来。伙计们，加把劲！看看我们！
Dude, cheer up. Guys, come on! Look at us!

130
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,794
看看我们走到了哪一步。今晚我们大获全胜。
Look at how far we've come. We totally scored tonight.

131
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:22,730
好的，下次换你戴那个粉红色假发，好不好？
All right, next time, you wear the pink wig, okay?

132
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,497
才不要。
No.

133
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,067
- 兄弟，又锁上了。- 好吧，我来撬锁。
- Dude, it's locked again. - Okay, I'll pick it.

134
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,736
等等，等等，等等，等一下。做那个动作。
Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Do the thing.

135
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,903
- 不要。- 请做那个动作。
- No. - Please do the thing.

136
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,138
- 这完全没必要。- 这超酷的。
- It's so unnecessary. - It's so cool.

137
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,539
- 我来帮你拿包吧。- 这也太客气了。
- I'll hold your bag. - It's so unnecessary.

138
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,107
- 来嘛，多有意思。- 好吧。
- Come on, it's fun. - Okay.

139
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:42,883
你可以的。
You got this.

140
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:49,256
- 她就像个小马里奥。- 她确实很像马里奥。
- She's like a little Mario. - She is like Mario.

141
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,091
- 当心，当心。 - 千万别死。
- Careful, careful. - Please don't die.

142
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,793
- 你还好吗？ - 还好。
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

143
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,564
如果能做到，我定会只做这件事。
If I could do that, I would only do that.

144
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,399
- 太酷了。 - 简直疯狂。
- It's so cool. - It's insane.

145
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,701
高兴吗？
Happy?

146
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,035
- 是的，那真是太棒了。- 是的。
- Yeah, that was awesome. - Yeah.

147
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,104
请让我们进去。好冷啊。
Please let us in. It's cold.

148
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:06,039
哇。
Whoo.

149
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,908
整座城市里最好的公寓。
Best apartment in the whole city.

150
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,343
没错，而且只有我们能独享这份美景。
Yep, and no one will ever see it but us.

151
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,015
*所有人……*
* Everybody... *

152
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:16,249
这实在是太可惜了。
It's such a shame.

153
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,688
* 但穿上这身盔甲我才算个真正的男人... *
* But in my armor I am a man... *

154
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,922
靠近点。
Come in close.

155
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,556
再近些。
Closer.

156
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,060
那家伙这下可惨了。
That guy is so screwed.

157
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,297
谁才是现在的有钱人？
Who's rich now?

158
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,332
查理，能把那个关掉吗，拜托？
Charlie, can you turn that thing off, please?

159
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,801
我觉得今晚的阿特拉斯部分看得够多了。
I think I've had enough Atlas for one night.

160
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,902
好的，我这就关掉。
Yeah, I got you.

161
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,603
...时隐时现。
...disappears, reappears.

162
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,538
至少如果手法得当的话。
At least if the trick is done right.

163
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,741
博斯科，你能查看一下披萨好了吗？我太饿了。
Bosco, can you check for pizza? I'm so hungry.

164
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:42,109
呃，我也是。
Ugh, me, too.

165
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,543
我们是天启四骑士！
We are the Four Horsemen!

166
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,946
虽然没有披萨，但有啤酒。
No pizza, but we got beer.

167
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:49,349
- 而且真的就只有啤酒。  
- 更接近了，因为——你以为你看到得越多……  
- 有人想来一杯吗？
- And, no, literally just beer. - Closer. Because - the more you think you see... - Any takers?

168
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,351
好的，给我来一杯。
Yeah, I'll have one.

169
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,786
老兄，认真点，把那玩意儿关掉。
Dude, seriously, turn that thing off.

170
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,487
我关了。
I did.

171
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,490
好吧。真好笑，伙计们。另一个投影仪在哪？
Okay. Real funny, guys. Where's the other projector?

172
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,591
我不是全息影像。
I'm not a hologram.

173
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,593
"我不是全息影像。"没错，是的。
"I'm not a hologram." Right. Yes.

174
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,462
恰恰是全息影像会说的话。
Exactly what a hologram would say.

175
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,833
- 天啊，你是真人。- 别再碰我的脸了。
- Oh, my God, you're real. - Never touch my face again.

176
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,334
真是抱歉。我还以为你是全息投影呢。
I'm so sorry. I thought that you were a hologram.

177
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,169
我绝对不会那样做的。我可是你的超级粉丝。
I would never do that. I'm a huge fan of yours.

178
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,470
你好吗？
How are you?

179
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,840
你怎么找到我们的？
How did you find us?

180
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,674
不知道，我大概用了 30 秒。
I don't know. Took me about 30 seconds.

181
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:17,945
既然我能这么轻松地找到你们，警察又会费多大劲呢？
And if it was this easy for me to find you, how hard would it be for the police?

182
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,247
- 哇，等等，警察？- 对，警察。
- Whoa, hold on, the police? - Yeah, the police.

183
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,149
警察为什么要找我们？
Why would the police be looking for us?

184
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,617
呃，我不知道，你刚才搞的那点小把戏怎么说？
Uh, I don't know, what about that little heist you just pulled?

185
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:29,689
还有你擅自住进这个地方，或者你的电是从角落那个配电箱接的？
Or the fact that you're squatting in this place or that your electricity comes from the circuit box in the corner?

186
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,825
我不知道，可能什么原因都有。我说得对吗，小丑？
I don't know, it could be anything. Am I right, Bozo?

187
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,360
是博斯科。
Bosco.

188
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,762
- 嗯。 - 博斯科·勒罗伊。
- Hmm. - Bosco Leroy.

189
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:37,164
哦，对，没错，博斯科·勒罗伊。
Ah, that's right, yeah, Bosco Leroy.

190
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,333
怎么，你是不是在 ChatGPT 里输入了“虚构魔术师名字”？
What, did you type, uh, "fictional magician name" into ChatGPT?

191
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,002
不，那其实是我的真名，阿特拉斯。
No, that's actually my real name, Atlas.

192
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,136
嗯。
Hmm.

193
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,437
怎么，你妈是不是跟地图搞上了？
What, did your mom have sex with a map?

194
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,776
- 这一点也不好笑。 - 嗯。
- That's not funny. - Hmm.

195
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,043
老兄，你对我们一无所知。
You don't know anything about us, dude.

196
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,711
-我对你的一切都了如指掌。 -哦。
- I know everything about you. - Oh.

197
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:57,951
这位名字值得商榷的博斯科·勒罗伊，原本大有前途的演艺事业被沉重的学生贷款彻底摧毁。
The dubiously named Bosco Leroy, a promising acting career cut short by crippling student loans.

198
00:11:57,985 --> 00:12:02,222
很遗憾你不得不从茱莉亚学院辍学，但你从未停止表演。
It's a bummer you had to drop out of Juilliard, but you never stopped performing.

199
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:06,359
嗯，如果我没记错的话，你的上一份有酬工作，我想是在时代广场扮演艾摩吧？
Uh, if memory serves, your last paid gig, I think, was dressing as Elmo in Times Square?

200
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,195
好吧，首先，我从来就不是埃尔莫。
Okay, first of all, I was never Elmo.

201
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,329
是那个红色的天线宝宝。
It's the red Teletubby.

202
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,198
Po！
Po!

203
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,800
- 什么？ - 那个红色的天线宝宝。
- What? - The red Teletubby.

204
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,034
- 她叫 Po。 - 哦，Po！
- Her name is Po. - Oh, Po!

205
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,168
这是我最喜欢的一个。
She's my favorite one.

206
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,236
对吧？
Right?

207
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:18,538
- 她叫小波。- 真可爱。
- Her name is Po. - Cute.

208
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,541
还有你，琼·鲁克莱尔。
And you, June Rouclere.

209
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,744
被你父母逼着上的每一所寄宿学校都把你踢了出去。
Kicked out of every boarding school your parents forced you to attend.

210
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,446
我猜你不太喜欢权威吧。
Not a big fan of authority, I take it.

211
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,815
嗯，让我猜猜。
Uh, let me guess.

212
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:32,019
你是不是觉得"老一辈"把地球搞砸了，现在你们这代人有责任来收拾他们的烂摊子。
Uh, you think the "olds" broke the planet and it's your generation's duty to clean up their mess.

213
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,854
- 我说对了吗？- 还是说错了？
- Am I right? - Am I wrong?

214
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:35,989
才不要。
No.

215
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:42,062
于是，你离家出走，来到纽约，在坦宁魔法商店遇见了这个人，查理·盖伊斯。
And so, you ran away from home, made your way to New York, where you ran into this guy at Tannin's Magic Shop, Charlie Gayes.

216
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,197
- 是的，嗨。- 是的，嗨。
- Yeah, hi. - Yeah, hi.

217
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,732
实际上，我在网上没能找到太多关于你的信息。
I actually couldn't find a lot about you online.

218
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:52,405
尽管我知道你是个孤儿，整个童年都在寄养家庭进进出出，直到遇见他俩才懂得家庭的意义。
Although, I do know you were an orphan and you were in and out of foster care your entire childhood, and that you didn't know the meaning of family until you hooked up with these two.

219
00:12:52,439 --> 00:13:01,614
所以，你们三个这些年一直在行侠仗义，试图以小骗术改变世界，最终导致了迄今为止最大胆的盗窃——那就是我的身份。
And so, the three of you have been working your little Robin Hood act for years now, trying to change the world one trick at a time, all leading to your riskiest theft to date, my identity.

220
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:02,715
你当时在场？
You were there?

221
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,886
你把我们的脸贴满了城里的每个脚手架和地铁站。
You had our faces plastered on every scaffolding and subway stop in the city.

222
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,254
这属于版权侵权，顺便说一句。
That's copyright infringement, by the way.

223
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:08,288
我当然在那儿。
Of course I was there.

224
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:10,323
那么，你觉得怎么样？
So, what'd you think?

225
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:12,725
我觉得你的梅里特需要改进。
I think your Merritt needs work.

226
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,027
- 我就知道。 - 这话题有点敏感。
- I knew it. - That's a sensitive topic.

227
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:15,462
- 你根本不明白。 - 不，他在说谎。
- You don't even get it. - No. He's lying.

228
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,864
但整体设计令人印象深刻。
But overall design was impressive.

229
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,899
我猜这是你吧，那个安静的家伙？
And that's you, I assume, the quiet guy?

230
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,969
- 教科书级别，幕后操作。- 是啊，嗯，- 亚历山大·赫尔曼……- 天哪。
- Textbook, behind the scenes. - Yeah, well, - Alexander Herrmann... - Oh, boy.

231
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:25,205
……他说设计这些戏法的人才是真正的天才。
...he said that the people who designed his tricks were the real geniuses.

232
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:29,542
你竟然清楚知道那个男人的名字，“幕后黑手”的身份。
The fact that you know that man's name, "behind the scenes" clearly.

233
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,778
而你，你的手法也很高明。动作非常敏捷。
And you, your sleight of hand was advanced. Good dexterity.

234
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,881
你的身手快速而灵活。真的，令我印象深刻。
You're quick and nimble on your feet. Really, I was impressed.

235
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,648
- 谢谢。- 不客气。
- Thanks. - You're welcome.

236
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,117
看来我们还挺厉害的。
Sounds like we're pretty great.

237
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,585
你还差得远呢。
You're far from it.

238
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:42,555
不过嘛，稍微调教一下的话，说不定能成。
But, uh, maybe with a little fine tuning, you could be.

239
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,058
是啊...我大概能明白为啥天眼要派我来你这边了。
Yeah, I could... I could see why The Eye sent me to you.

240
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:46,559
- 抱歉。 - 等等，你刚才是说"魔眼"吗？
- I'm sorry. - Wait, did you say "The Eye"?

241
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,660
对，魔眼。
Yeah, The Eye.

242
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,031
好的，听我说。
All right, listen.

243
00:13:51,064 --> 00:14:01,174
三周前，这张卡片寄到了我的公寓，里面夹着四张机票，内衬里还藏着一些指示，说是一个前所未见、规模更大、更精彩的大型魔术。
This card arrived at my apartment three weeks ago, along with four plane tickets and instructions hidden in the lining for a trick bigger and better than anything you have ever seen.

244
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,577
而这个把戏，出于某种原因，把你们三个也包括在内了。
A trick that, for some reason, includes the three of you.

245
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,913
- 我们？嗯，是的。
- Us? Mm-hmm.

246
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:08,916
- 为何不是其他几位骑士？ - 不， - 其他几位骑士都已经不在了。 - 什么？
- Why not the other Horsemen? - No, - the other horsemen are dead. - What?

247
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,783
在我看来，他们已经离世。别再打断我了。
To me, they're dead to me. Stop interrupting.

248
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:13,353
不，当时情况有些失控。大家都退出了。
No, things got emotional. Everyone quit.

249
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:15,422
后来我去澳大利亚做了一次长途旅行。说来话长。
I took a walkabout in Australia. It's a long story.

250
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,125
现在轮到你们需要我们了？
And now you need us?

251
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:19,559
按那张卡片来看，是的。
According to that card, yes.

252
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,496
好吧，我们不需要你们，所以……博斯科。
Well, we don't need you, so... Bosco.

253
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,198
什么？我们要这家伙做什么？我们正势如破竹。
What? What do we need this guy for? We're crushing it.

254
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:27,968
你已经成功了？你在从那些加密货币兄弟那儿偷点小钱。
You're crushing it? You're stealing a little money from some crypto bro.

255
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,170
我说的是大鱼，兄弟。
I'm talking about big fish here, man.

256
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,040
我说的是那种能真正改变局势的东西。
I'm talking about something that will make a real difference.

257
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,241
我以为这正是你们年轻人追求的。
I thought that's what you kids are all about.

258
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:35,342
是的，正是如此。
It is. No, exactly.

259
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,543
是的，我们是。
Yes, we are.

260
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:39,179
没错，但我想我们自己也能捕鱼。
Yeah, but I think we can catch our own fish.

261
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,781
- 你们行吗？- 不，不，他... - 那就祝你们好运了。- 什么？不行。
- You can? - No, no, he... - Good luck with that. - What? No.

262
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,383
能不能等一下？
Can you just wait one second?

263
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,517
你在干嘛？发生了什么...到底什么情况？
What are you doing? What's... what's going on?

264
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,852
你疯了吗？
Are you out of your mind?

265
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,989
- 这是 J.丹尼尔·阿特拉斯。 - 对，我知道他是谁。
- This is J. Daniel Atlas. - Yeah, I know who he is.

266
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,323
他简直是个传奇人物。
He's a freaking legend.

267
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,359
他曾经是传奇。现在却像是个混蛋。
He was a legend. Now he's just kind of a dick.

268
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,726
-你能... -好的，没问题。
- Can you... - Yeah, sure.

269
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,663
博斯科，他虽然有点混蛋，但确实是天启四骑士之一。
Bosco, he's kind of a dick, but he is a Horseman.

270
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,967
拜托了，就信我们这一次吧。
I mean, come on, just trust us on this, please.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,502
好吧，该做决定了，孩子们。你们打算怎么办？
Okay. Decision time, kids. What's it gonna be?

272
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:05,738
你们加入……还是不加入？
Are you in... ...or are you out?

273
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,347
是什么把戏？
What's the trick?

274
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:29,429
尊敬的社区成员、尊贵的媒体朋友、朋友们和同事们，欢迎大家。
Welcome, esteemed community members, valued press, friends and colleagues.

275
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:41,341
今晚我们齐聚一堂，共同庆祝范登伯格最新、最伟大的矿场——C3 号矿，我们亲切地称她为"Amahle"，在祖鲁语中意为"美丽的那一个"。
We are gathered here tonight to celebrate Vanderberg's latest and greatest mine, C3, or as we like to call her, "Amahle," Zulu for "The Beautiful One."

276
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:44,777
因为在母亲眼中，每个孩子都是美丽的。
Because every child is beautiful in the eyes of its mother.

277
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:54,754
我们的客户可以放心，当他们购买这世上最伟大的爱的象征时，它所蕴含的唯有纯粹的爱意。
Our customer can rest assured that when they buy the world's greatest symbol of love that it was produced with nothing but.

278
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,425
致阿玛勒，以及你们所有人。
To Amahle, and to all of you.

279
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,796
好的，非常感谢大家专程前来。
Well, thank you all so much for making the trip out here.

280
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:07,400
那么，我想你们对阿玛勒都印象深刻吧。
Now, I take it you were all impressed by Amahle.

281
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,102
抱歉，C3。
Sorry, C3.

282
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,571
- 哇，场面真激烈。- 是啊，太精彩了。
- Oh, it's quite dramatic. - Yeah, it's amazing.

283
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:19,312
不过我明白，你特意挑选今天这个好日子来提及这些顾虑，对此我不仅不怪你，反而出乎你的意料。
But I also understand that you have chosen this fine day to broach some concerns, which, contrary to your expectations, I don't begrudge.

284
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,748
尽管说吧。
Fire away.

285
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:28,788
好的。呃，董事会认为预测或许过于乐观了……嗯。
Right. Well, um, the board feels that projections might be optimistic... Mm.

286
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:33,860
...面对实验室培育钻石日益激烈的竞争，以及借贷利率暴跌的情况……威廉。威廉。
...with increasing competition from lab grown and, in the event borrowing rates plum... William. William.

287
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:38,265
我父亲很爱你，但他叫你乌云是有原因的。
My father loved you, but there was a reason he called you his dark cloud.

288
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:40,433
噢，真遗憾。
Aw, shame.

289
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,103
范德伯格家族从不认输。
The Vanderberg family does not lose.

290
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:48,875
如你所知，我们赛车团队刚刚第七次赢得了摩纳哥锦标赛冠军。
As you're well aware, our motorsports team just won the Monaco Championship for the seventh time.

291
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,878
该矿山将投入生产。
The mine will produce.

292
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:53,713
接下来呢？
Next?

293
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,116
没错。
Right.

294
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,851
定价。你们设定的最低价...你能配合我一下吗，威廉？
Pricing. The minimums that you've set for... Will you humor me, William?

295
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:01,788
在一场关于现实的演示中？
In a demonstration about reality?

296
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:06,526
这颗钻石大概有 55 克拉吧？
This diamond is say, what, 55 carats?

297
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,663
世界钻石理事会会给出 300 万美元的估价。
The AWDC would price it at 3,000,000 US dollars.

298
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,735
威廉，你张开口伸出舌头来好吗？
William, will you open your mouth and stick out your tongue?

299
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,140
现在。
Now.

300
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,877
- 真的吗？- 真的。
- Really? - Really.

301
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:40,527
那么，如果威廉吞下这颗钻石，这同一颗钻石会划破他的喉咙。
Now, if William here were to swallow it, that selfsame diamond would tear his throat to shreds.

302
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,496
他会在救护车到达前流血致死。
He would bleed to death before paramedics arrived.

303
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:49,336
所以，对 AWDC 来说，它是三百万美元，但对威廉来说，它是无价的。
So, to the AWDC, it's 3,000,000, but to William, priceless.

304
00:17:50,770 --> 00:18:02,048
告诉我，作为全球最后一批大型钻石矿的首席执行官，我是应该削减我们的利润，还是应该选择我们独特的客户会支付的价格？
Tell me then, as the CEO responsible for the world's last great diamond mines, should I undercut our profits, or should I choose prices that I know our unique clients will pay?

305
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,421
果然不出我所料。
As I thought.

306
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:22,735
那么……如果没有其他顾虑的话，我想带着价目表前往安特卫普，展示我们的宝石。
Now... ... unless there are more concerns, I would like to head to Antwerp with my price list and show off our stones.

307
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,010
哦，呃，你知道吗，你或许可以先提免费欧洲游的事？
Oh, uh, you know, you probably could have led with a free trip to Europe?

308
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:35,215
你知道吗，关于安特卫普有个鲜为人知的事实是……哦，太好了，又是魔法小知识。这真有趣。
You know, a little known fact about Antwerp is that... Oh, great, more magic trivia. This is fun.

309
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:37,684
不，我正要说呢，他们的饼干做得可好了。
No, I was just gonna say that they make great biscuits.

310
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,186
噢，真的吗？我们真的能来点吗？
Oh, do they? Can we actually get some, please?

311
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,620
- 在 Atlas 星球上，当然了。- 不行。
- On Atlas, obviously. - No.

312
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,255
不行，不行，我可不会给你买饼干。
No, no, I'm not getting you biscuits.

313
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,357
我刚给你买了巧克力，好吗？
I just got you chocolates, okay?

314
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,125
好吧，听着，这可不是度假，明白吗？
All right, listen, this is not a vacation, okay?

315
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:51,731
我们只有三天时间来准备一个效果，好让你那勉强过关的"幽灵舞者"戏法看起来像洞穴壁画一样原始。
We have three days to prepare an effect that'll make your barely passable Pepper's Ghost trick look like a cave painting.

316
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,000
好吧，过来这边。
All right, come here.

317
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:02,509
"心形钻石"，史上最珍贵的宝石，亦是范德伯格矿业公司的根基所在。
The Heart Diamond, the most valuable jewel in history and the foundation of the Vanderberg Mining Corporation.

318
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:11,584
多年来，这个家族一直将这块巨大的宝石藏匿于他们地下七十层的秘密金库之中。
Now, for years, the family's kept this big rock hidden inside their secret vault, 70 stories underground.

319
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:15,288
这并非寻常之地，而是位于阿拉伯沙漠。
And not just any ground. The Arabian Desert.

320
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,602
除了他们最信任的团队之外，无人踏足此地。
No one beyond their most trusted team has been inside.

321
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:38,778
仅可通过一部电梯进入，全程由武装警卫严密监视……身份已确认。
Access through a single elevator, constantly monitored by armed guards... Identity verified.

322
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:41,681
……并且需要穿过一套多层级生物识别安全系统。
...and behind a multi-level biometric security system.

323
00:19:50,290 --> 00:20:03,035
但全世界都将见证这一时刻，因为这是半个世纪以来，这颗钻石首次被运送至安特卫普，旨在建立信誉并推动一场私人拍卖会的竞价
But the world will be watching, because for the first time in half a century, that diamond is being traveled here to Antwerp, to establish credibility and to spur bidding at a private auction

324
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,638
这场拍卖会将在三天后为该公司的最新发现举行。
for the company's latest finds in three days' time.

325
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,939
好吧，显然，我没意见去偷。
Okay, obviously, I'm down for stealing.

326
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,675
但这颗钻石为何如此特别？
But what makes this diamond so special?

327
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,444
嗯，因为魔法塔罗牌告诉我们要这么做，对吧，琼？
Well, because the magical tarot card told us to, June, right?

328
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:13,513
对，这很可爱。不过，能让我把话说完吗？
Yeah, okay, that's very cute. But can I please finish?

329
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,348
你还没说完？老天，你都说了很久了。
You're not finished? Jeez, you've been talking forever.

330
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,516
没错，而且我正准备继续说下去。
Yes, and I'm about to talk more.

331
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,150
所以，请认真听着。
So, please, pay attention.

332
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:26,726
几十年来，先是彼得·范德伯格，现在是他女儿维罗妮卡，一直在以虚高的价格向全球的军火商、走私犯、军阀出售这些钻石。
For decades, first, Peter Vanderberg, now his daughter, Veronika, have been selling these diamonds at inflated prices to arms dealers, traffickers, warlords the world over,

333
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,661
来协助洗钱。
to, like, help launder their money.

334
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,229
我是说，这笔钱是赃款。
So, I mean, the cash is dirty.

335
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:32,465
在某些情况下，上面甚至沾满了鲜血。
I mean, in some cases, it's, like, literally blood-soaked.

336
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:35,735
但接着，瞧……这些赃款被用来交换这些宝石，从而洗白了。
But then, voila... ...it's cleaned in exchange for these precious stones.

337
00:20:35,768 --> 00:20:38,805
是她让世间所有最坏的人都变得可能。
She makes all the world's worst people possible.

338
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:43,910
因此，寄出那张塔罗牌的人……正是这世间所剩无几的真正高尚之人。
So, whoever sent that tarot card... Are the few truly honorable people left in this world.

339
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,845
他们是仍关心正义的仅存之人。
The only people that still care about justice.

340
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,347
他们是我长久未联系的人。
They're people I haven't spoken to in a long time.

341
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,349
他们自称"天眼"
They call themselves "The Eye,"

342
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,851
希望我们做到四骑士未能完成的事
and they want us to do something that the Horsemen never could.

343
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:57,156
伙计 这可是将恶魔女王置于死地的良机
This, man, this is a chance to drive a stake through the heart of the devil herself.

344
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,425
我们开始行动吧
Let's do it.

345
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,564
今晚拍卖会上，所有人的目光都会聚焦在我和“心之守护”上。
All eyes will be on me and the Heart tonight at the auction.

346
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:06,333
我必须光彩照人。
I have to look dazzling.

347
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,100
你们有“小猫之吻”那个颜色吗？
Do you have that Kitten Kiss color?

348
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,705
蕾塔博。
Lethabo.

349
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,207
- 有事吗？- 吸管。
- Yes? - Straw.

350
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,578
《名利场》那位英国摄影师是谁来着？
Who's that British photographer from Vanity Fair?

351
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:22,382
呃，他叫什么名字来着？马克……马克·斯克里布？
Uh, what's his name again? Marc... Marc Scriber?

352
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,083
- 施赖伯，我的天啊。- 施赖伯。
- Schreiber, good God. - Schreiber.

353
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,118
选定他，取消其他人。
Confirm him, cancel the others.

354
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:29,288
去年我们铺得太广了，今年要专攻。
We went wide last year. This year, exclusivity.

355
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:31,290
- 好的。- 我们保持开放、透明。
- All right. - We're open, transparent.

356
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,759
我们没有什么可隐瞒的。
We have nothing to hide.

357
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,061
- 好的，完美无缺。- 我这就去完成。
- Okay, perfect. - I'll have it done.

358
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,464
这位是维罗妮卡。
This is Veronika.

359
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:39,399
* 小宝贝，别出声 *
* Hush little baby *

360
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,933
* 什么都别说 *
* Don't say a word *

361
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:42,735
此人是谁？
Who is this?

362
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,804
* 爸爸会为你买一只反舌鸟 *
* Papa's gonna buy you a mocking bird *

363
00:21:44,837 --> 00:21:46,238
* 倘若那反舌鸟 *
* And if that mocking bird *

364
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:47,474
撤离。
Vacate.

365
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:48,608
* 不许唱 *
* Don't sing *

366
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,942
你是从哪里得到这个号码的？
How did you get this number?

367
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:53,112
* 爸爸要给你买一只钻石戒指 *
* Papa's gonna buy you a diamond ring *

368
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,783
这是一条私人线路，而且刚才那声问候真是有点不识趣。
This is a private line, and that was a bit tone deaf.

369
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,619
我问你是谁。
I asked who you are.

370
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,154
啊，维罗妮卡。
Ah, Veronika.

371
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,223
你左手边的储物柜。
The storage unit to your left.

372
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,335
看着眼熟吗？
Look familiar?

373
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:21,307
那是 15 年前去世的那个男孩的。
It belonged to that boy who died 15 years ago.

374
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,811
这对我或任何人都毫无意义。
This means nothing to me or anyone.

375
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:25,978
真的吗？
Really?

376
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,114
你我都清楚你做过的事。
You and I both know what you did.

377
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,854
既然你有实锤证据想弄死我，何不直接拿出来用？
Look, if you have real evidence and you're out to get me, why not just use it?

378
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,427
十五年前，你夺走了你父亲的最爱。
Fifteen years ago, you took what your father loved most.

379
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,630
现在我要对你如法炮制。
Now I'm going to do the same to you.

380
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:46,265
我要"心之钻"。
I want the Heart Diamond.

381
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,835
你会把东西给我的。
You're going to give it to me.

382
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:54,507
否则我就会让全世界透过镜子看清你的真面目。
Or I'm going to hold up a looking glass for the whole world to see you as you are.

383
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,478
来吧，我没什么可隐瞒的。
Go ahead. I have nothing to hide.

384
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:17,196
- 天哪。 - 嘿。
- Oh, my God. - Hey.

385
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,297
我对此非常抱歉。
I'm so sorry about that.

386
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:20,933
你好。你能帮我找一下这个吗？
Hi. Can you help me find this?

387
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,234
我已经找了快一个小时了。
I've been looking literally for an hour.

388
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:24,170
是的，女士，就在那边。
Yes. It's gonna be right over there, ma'am.

389
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,853
马克·施莱伯、詹姆斯·温、范德伯格公关。
Marc Schreiber, James Winn, Vanderberg PR.

390
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,024
久仰您的大名。
Huge admirer of your work.

391
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,759
詹姆斯？丹妮怎么了？
James? What happened to Dani?

392
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,328
哦，丹妮。唉，说来遗憾，我们不得不解雇了她。
Oh, Dani. Yeah, sadly, we had to let her go.

393
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,197
结果发现她是个种族主义者。
Turns out she was racist.

394
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:58,270
而且，她给你订的是丽笙布鲁酒店——还是个部分海景双人间。- 真受不了。
And also, she booked you into the Radisson Blu - in a partial view, double. - Ugh.

395
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:01,140
幸好我自作主张把你换到了弗朗克酒店。
Thankfully, I took the liberty of moving you to the FRANQ.

396
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,443
我确实很喜欢弗朗克酒店。
I do love the FRANQ.

397
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:11,283
是的，总统套房确实适合总统以及像您这样才华横溢的摄影师。
Yes, the presidential suite is befitting of, well, presidents and talented photographers like yourself.

398
00:24:11,317 --> 00:24:13,553
呃，您的晚宴邀请函已被重新定向。
Uh, your gala invitation has been rerouted.

399
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,254
能否查看一下您的确认函？
If I could just check your confirmation?

400
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,291
谢谢。
Thank you.

401
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,393
我也把你的拍摄时间从晚上 7 点调整到了 9 点。
I also bumped your shoot from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.

402
00:24:21,427 --> 00:24:23,763
好让你有足够的时间施展魔法。
to give you proper time to make your magic.

403
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,099
- 有人理解我。- 是的。
- Someone gets it. - Yeah.

404
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:34,473
* 我像一颗超新星般闪耀 *
* I'm shinin' like a supernova *

405
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,910
* 我高举双手 敞开心扉... *
* With my hands up high And my heart wide open... *

406
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:44,016
* 我闪耀得更加璀璨 犹如一颗钻石 *
* I shine even more bright Like a diamond *

407
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,286
* 将恐惧从肩头拂去... *
* Brush that fear right off my shoulder... *

408
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,489
比如实验室培育的钻石。
Take, for instance, diamonds created in laboratories.

409
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:54,426
它们声称具有价值，但既不天然也非稀有。
They purport to have value, but they're neither natural nor rare.

410
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,329
哪位诚实的女性会想在手指上戴上虚假之物呢？
What honest woman wants a falsehood on her finger?

411
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:58,531
我同意。
I agree.

412
00:24:58,565 --> 00:25:02,569
留下的伟大真理之一是天然宝石背后的力量。
One of the great truths left is the power behind a natural gem.

413
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:06,639
真正的钻石总能激发人们的热情，几个世纪以来皆是如此。
Real diamonds fill people with passion, as they have for centuries.

414
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:14,647
没错。事实上，玛丽·安托瓦内特曾佩戴希望钻石仅一天时间，一个月后...她就被人拖上了断头台，那些正如你所说，被热情冲昏头脑的人们。
That's right. In fact, Marie-Antoinette, wore the Hope Diamond for a single day, and a month later... ...was dragged to the guillotine by some very, well, as you say, passionate folks.

415
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,017
玛丽·安托瓦内特的死并非因钻石而起。
Marie-Antoinette didn't die because of a diamond.

416
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,352
她的死源于一种可怕的缺乏同理心。
She died because of a monstrous lack of empathy.

417
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:23,956
好吧……而真相是，她从未佩戴过“希望”宝石。
Well... And truth is, she never even wore the Hope.

418
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,357
人们只是相信她戴过。
People just believe she did.

419
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,826
真的吗？这有点意思。
Really? That's kind of interesting.

420
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,463
所以她不是死于暴民之手，也不是断头台，而是一个……一个故事。
So it was not the mob that killed her, and it was not the guillotine, it was a... a story.

421
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,366
我大概认不全自己请的客人。
I must not know my own guest list.

422
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,968
你从事钻石行业吗？
Are you in the diamond business?

423
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:38,437
不，我和您一样，经营的是幻象生意。
No, no, I'm in the illusion business, like you.

424
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:48,514
你看，几个世纪以来钻石本无价值，直到像维罗妮卡这样精明的富人们告诉我们，这些玻璃碎片不仅稀有
See, for centuries, diamonds were worthless until some very smart, very rich people like Veronika here, told us that, not only are these little shards of glass rare,

425
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,584
但没有一对有自尊心的情侣会不要魔杖就结婚。
but that no self-respecting couple could possibly get married without one.

426
00:25:51,618 --> 00:25:53,820
不，现在这个魔术变的不错。
No, now, that one is a good magic trick.

427
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:59,091
问题在于，呃……所有好的魔术在故事里都有个小转折。
The problem with the trick is, um... All the good ones have a little twist in the tale.

428
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,061
是你吗？
Is it you?

429
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,096
是在说我吗？
Is what me?

430
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:07,800
- 当然不是。 - 不，不。
- Of course not. - No, no.

431
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:12,571
我的意思是，如果不是因为我表现出最高的道德水准，你也不会让我进来，就像你的其他一些客人一样。
I mean, you wouldn't have let me in had I not demonstrated the finest moral fiber, like some of your other guests.

432
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:15,708
我注意到那边的军火商路易斯·布里塞尼奥。
I notice Luis Briseño, the arms dealer over there.

433
00:26:15,742 --> 00:26:17,009
你好，先生。
Hello, sir.

434
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:21,380
当然，还有玛利亚·博特尼克，当她被明星光环吸引时，是如何在与国有媒体独家的同时又能游刃有余地周旋。
And of course, Maria Bortnick, when starstruck, how she manages to mingle while monopolizing her state media.

435
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,716
或许你愿意揭示自己的真面目。
Perhaps you'd care to reveal yourself.

436
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,218
然后我们就可以对你进行同样的审视。
Then we can apply the same scrutiny to you.

437
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,887
嗯。
Hmm.

438
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,089
还不行。
Not just yet.

439
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,523
抱歉打断一下。
I'm sorry for interrupting.

440
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:37,029
不必了。
That won't be necessary.

441
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,298
让他吃蛋糕吧。
Let him eat cake.

442
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,070
马克·施赖伯。
Marc Schreiber.

443
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,438
维罗妮卡·范登伯格。
Veronika Vanderberg.

444
00:26:48,908 --> 00:26:50,376
我们速战速决吧？
Let's make this quick, shall we?

445
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,078
拍卖即将开始。
Our auction begins shortly.

446
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:54,113
我相信你能做到，不辜负我和心之所向。
I trust you can do me and the Heart justice.

447
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,717
是的，我只有一个规则，必须听从我的安排。
Yes. I only have one rule. What I say goes.

448
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:01,320
好吧，我想我应该能找到自己顺从的一面。
Well, I'm sure I can find my submissive side.

449
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:05,624
如果不行的话，我会帮你找到它的。
Well, if not, I'll find it for you.

450
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,460
噢，我很中意你。
Ooh. I like you.

451
00:27:09,896 --> 00:27:10,963
亲爱的，这边请。
Right this way, darling.

452
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,372
- 我不想妆感太重。 - 当然，当然，没问题。
- I don't want to be too matte. - Sure. Sure, sure.

453
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:22,241
还有，我鼻翼两侧可别泛油光。
And I don't like the sides of my nose shining.

454
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,275
好的。
Okay.

455
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:24,877
- 给我看看。- 嗯。
- Show me. - Mm-hmm.

456
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,750
打扰一下，我镜头里的小果蝇能不能请走开，走开，走开？
Excuse me, can the little fruit fly in my shot please shoo, shoo, shoo?

457
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,284
谢谢。
Thank you.

458
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,821
比那颗钻石更珍贵的，只有我的时间。
The only thing more valuable than that diamond is my time.

459
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,757
我对你做了一番调查。
I did my research on you.

460
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,828
你的行业和我的行业一样，都深陷于制造商编织的神话之中。
Your industry, like mine, is besieged by manufacturer lore.

461
00:27:41,861 --> 00:27:46,098
但你，你为我们呈现的是真实的美。
But you, you bring us beauty as it is.

462
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:48,600
这一点上我们很相似。
We're alike in that regard.

463
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:52,604
我们不卖设计，只卖真实。
We don't sell contrivance, we sell reality.

464
00:27:52,638 --> 00:27:54,974
要我说，我们根本就不卖东西。
Well, I would argue that we don't sell at all.

465
00:27:55,875 --> 00:27:57,009
是别人主动来买。
Others buy.

466
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:58,177
嗯。
Hmm.

467
00:28:01,748 --> 00:28:07,186
让我看看...呃...那颗钻石，把它拿出来。
Let's see... Uh... The diamond, take it out.

468
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:08,988
不，孩子。
Nah, boy.

469
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:11,123
绝对不行。
Absolutely not.

470
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:13,926
玻璃上的反光会毁了照片。
The glare in the glass will mar the photos.

471
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,561
我不容忍任何瑕疵。
I don't tolerate imperfections.

472
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:18,664
我也不认为范德伯格女士如此出众的人会愿意容忍。
I don't imagine someone as ravishing as Ms. Vanderberg does either.

473
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:22,935
所以，要么把它拿开，要么就另请高明吧。
So, take it out or find yourself a new photographer.

474
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,026
事实上，我正盼着你问呢。
In truth, I was hoping you'd ask.

475
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,761
我可没说要问。
I don't remember asking.

476
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:57,169
找到了。
There it is.

477
00:28:57,203 --> 00:29:00,039
漂亮。继续。太棒了。
Beautiful. Work it. Fabulous.

478
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,342
- 太棒了。- 太棒了。
- Fabulous. - Fabulous.

479
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,643
美丽极了。
Beautiful.

480
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,414
是的。微笑着，我们玩得很开心。
Yes. Smiling, we're having fun.

481
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,482
这正是我们此行的目的。
This is what we came for.

482
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,453
坚持住，坚持住。
Hold it, hold it.

483
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,123
这个角度棒极了。
That's the money shot.

484
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:18,925
保持住。
Hold it.

485
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:22,428
而您，女士，已经离得够远了。
And you, ma'am, are far enough.

486
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,896
- 我只是想…… - 我想帮帮忙。
- I'm just trying... - I'm trying to help.

487
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,898
她的额头比钻石还闪亮。
Her forehead is shinier than the diamond.

488
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:27,867
实际上，我在履行我的职责。我不听命于你。
Actually, I'm doing my job. I don't take orders from you.

489
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,401
但凡涉及"心"这个字，你得听我的。
When it comes to the Heart, you listen to me.

490
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,903
- 出去吧。- 我... 我自己能走。
- Get out. - I... I can walk myself.

491
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:32,038
- 谢谢。- 好的。
- Thank you. - Right.

492
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:36,208
施赖伯先生。
Mr. Schreiber.

493
00:29:36,242 --> 00:29:39,879
如果你真是你所宣称的那种人，你应该已经得到了你需要的东西。
If you're all you purport to be, you should already have what you need.

494
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,649
- 绰绰有余。谢谢。 - 太棒了。
- More than enough. Thank you. - Excellent.

495
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,324
好的，真是荣幸，不过我还有买家在等着。
Well, it's been a pleasure, but I have buyers waiting.

496
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:54,060
我受够这种胡闹了。
I've had enough of this of this nonsense.

497
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,127
务必把它保管好。
Make sure it's secured.

498
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:56,996
是的，莱萨博。
Yes, Lethabo.

499
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:02,068
- 搞什么鬼，怎么回事？ - 我不知道，我真不知道。
- What the hell, what happened? - I don't know. I don't know.

500
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:03,802
时间紧迫，我们快走吧。
Time's ticking. Let's go.

501
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:21,153
终于，我们翘首期盼的拍卖会就要开场了。
At last, the auction we've all been waiting for.

502
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:24,623
此刻在座的各位想必都自诩见多识广。
Now, if you're here tonight, you probably think you've seen everything.

503
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:29,795
但我想请问诸位…当真如此吗？
So it is to you that I ask... Everything?

504
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:37,269
这件藏品已有二十五年未曾现世。
It's not been seen in person for a quarter of a century.

505
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:40,606
迄今为止发现的最大钻石，心之钻。
Still the largest diamond ever discovered, the Heart.

506
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:51,350
恭喜你们所有人，并且逍遥法外这么久。
Congratulations to all of you and for getting away with it for so long.

507
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,585
那么，猜猜看？
Well, guess what?

508
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:57,256
气候变化也不相信你们。
Climate change doesn't believe in you, either.

509
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:04,596
你们从我们大地之母手中夺走了财富，乘坐私人飞机将她的天空点燃…… - 好了，她明白了。 - 对，对，对。
You tore your fortunes from our Mother Earth, set fire to her skies in your private jets... - Okay, she gets it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:14,040
用你们贪得无厌的欲望榨干了她……年轻人，我们这里都想拯救世界，但时间也很宝贵，你正在浪费我的时间。
Bled her dry with your insatiable... Young man, we all want to save the world here, but time is also precious and you're wasting mine.

511
00:31:14,073 --> 00:31:16,909
闭嘴吧，小闪亮。
Zip it, sparkles.

512
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:20,879
你不如别再用塑料吸管了，来试试这个吧！
Why don't you stop sucking on plastic straws, and suck on this!

513
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,790
尊敬的各位来宾。我是丹尼尔·阿特拉斯。
Honored guests. My name is J. Daniel Atlas.

514
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:35,794
或许您还记得我是最受喜爱的四位魔术奇才之一。
You may remember me as your personal favorite of the Four Horsemen of magic.

515
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:40,566
现在请仔细观看，我将在掌心变出举世闻名的"心灵钻石"。
Now watch closely as I make the famous Heart Diamond appear on my palm.

516
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:44,136
哇，看来这位表演者像绿色和平组织一样渴望被关注呢。
Gee-whiz, he must be as starved for attention as Greenpeace here.

517
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,507
请放心，这枚钻石绝对安全。
Rest assured that the diamond is completely safe.

518
00:31:49,175 --> 00:31:50,576
是吗？
Is it?

519
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:57,216
记得有位智者曾告诉我，实际上，是在镜子里，呃，永远不要假设自己是房间里最聪明的人，要证明自己。
Now, a wise man once told me, in the mirror, in fact, uh, never assume you're the smartest person in the room, prove it.

520
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,418
请便。
Be my guest.

521
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,720
好吧，那我们试试看能不能把这个箱子打开。
All right, well, let's see if we can get that case open.

522
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,355
呃……阿布拉卡达布拉。
Uh... Abracadabra.

523
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:06,058
嗯，不行。呃……阿啦卡乍姆。
Huh. Nope. Uh... Alakazam.

524
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,893
等一下。
Wait.

525
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,362
芝麻开门。
Open sesame.

526
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:14,566
啊。
Ah.

527
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:19,271
和我在一起还是很安全的。
Still safe with me.

528
00:32:20,973 --> 00:32:23,442
不。放轻松。嗯，放松，韦罗妮卡。
No. Relax. Mm, relax, Veronika.

529
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:27,546
如今，正如你们的广告乐于提醒我们的那样，钻石恒久远。
Now, as your ads like to remind us, diamonds are forever.

530
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:30,549
- 带她安全离开。现在！- 你阻止他！拦住他！
- Get her to safety. Now! - You stop him! Stop him!

531
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:31,650
拦住他！
Stop him!

532
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,621
- 杰克。- 嘿。
- Jack. - Hey.

533
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:38,024
- 你来这干嘛？- 来救你的。
- What are you doing here? - Saving your ass.

534
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,391
- 啊。- 不客气。
- Ah. - You're welcome.

535
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,693
你也中招了。哼。
You got one, too. Huh.

536
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,095
- 你好，我是琼。- 嗯，我知道。
- Hi. I'm June. - Yeah.

537
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,696
- 她是谁？- 抱歉，她和我们一起的。
- Who's she? - Sorry, she's with us.

538
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,802
钻石在哪里？
Where is the diamond?

539
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,843
什么？
What?

540
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,810
我猜你们这些人根本不在乎环境吧。
I guess you guys don't care about the environment.

541
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,112
你比看上去要坚强得多。
You're stronger than you look.

542
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,281
喂！
Hey!

543
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,450
快跑。
Run away.

544
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,520
嘿！喂，喂！
Hey! Hey, hey!

545
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:43,922
站住！别让他们跑了！
Stop! Don't let them get away!

546
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,391
好的，现在怎么办？
Okay, what now?

547
00:33:45,424 --> 00:33:47,526
我的卡片上只说要把你救出来。我不知道该怎么办。
My card just said to get you out of there. I don't know.

548
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,498
亨利·里夫斯？
Henley Reeves?

549
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,333
我有很多你的海报。
I have so many posters of you.

550
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,867
- 你是我童年时的... - 好的，追星族以后再说。
- You're my childhood... - All right, fanboy later.

551
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:58,370
不过确实... 你知道，能见到你真的很开心。
But it does, uh... You know, it is really nice to see you.

552
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:01,207
追星族以后再说。我们得赶快上楼了。
Fanboy later. We got to go up.

553
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,183
举起手来，别动！
Put your hands up and don't move!

554
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:13,119
这简直是胡说八道。
This is some bullshit.

555
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,856
发生什么事了？
What is happening?

556
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,891
贝多芬的 D 大调协奏曲。
Beethoven's Concerto in D major.

557
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,561
废话，全是废话！
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

558
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,698
哇，梅里特？那……那到底是什么东西？
Whoa. Merritt? What... What the hell was that?

559
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:30,702
阿特拉斯，我想看你催眠三个比利时人。
Atlas, I would like to see you hypnotize three dudes in Belgian.

560
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:31,770
你指的是讲弗拉芒语的人吧。
You mean Flemish.

561
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,072
好的，这就说得通了。
Okay, that explains it.

562
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,841
温馨的重逢。我们得走了。
Lovely reunion. We have to go.

563
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,710
亨利·里夫斯！
Henley Reeves!

564
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,646
- 欢迎回来！ - 谢谢。
- Welcome back! - Thanks.

565
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,383
能允许我说一句，你真是... - 好啦，快走吧！ - 是是是，这就走！
And may I say, you are... - Okay, come on, let's go! - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

566
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:48,053
我刚才是在恭维她，因为我看到她——就只有她一个人，让我感觉很愉快。
I was paying her a compliment because it was nice to see her, and only her.

567
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,688
- 我刚才只是在... - 我们都懂啦！
- I was... - We get it!

568
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,394
就在上面。
Up there.

569
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,867
哇！哇！哇！这是给我们的吗？
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Is that for us?

570
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,403
你还看到其他人在试图逃跑吗？
Do you see any other people trying to escape?

571
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:06,272
- 快一点，快一点。- 走，走！
- Come on, come on. - Go, go!

572
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,279
快一点，快一点。
Come on, come on.

573
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:56,588
呃，它一直在我手里。从未...他们没有掉包钻石。
Uh, it was in my hand the whole time. It never... They didn't swap the diamond.

574
00:35:57,689 --> 00:35:59,124
他们掉包了盒子。
They swapped the case.

575
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,228
而您，女士，到此为止了。
And you, ma'am, are far enough.

576
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,372
别再吸塑料吸管了，来吸这个吧！
Why don't you stop sucking on plastic straws, and suck on this!

577
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:35,361
尊贵的客人们... 芝麻开门。
Honored guests... Open sesame.

578
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,200
和我在一起还是很安全的。
Still safe with me.

579
00:36:44,403 --> 00:36:46,572
钻石恒久远。
Diamonds are forever.

580
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:51,443
- 蕾塔波。 - 是的，夫人？
- Lethabo. - Yes, ma'am?

581
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:53,412
我们会让他们后悔的。
We're going to make them regret this.

582
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:55,814
而且不止一点点。
And then some.

583
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,884
马克·施赖伯，《名利场》杂志。
Marc Schreiber, Vanity Fair.

584
00:37:00,419 --> 00:37:02,354
我错过了什么？
What did I miss?

585
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,632
你懂的，我还以为会更闪亮呢。
You know, I thought it'd be shinier.

586
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,734
- 好吧。- 行了，还给我。
- Okay. - All right, give it back.

587
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,636
- 你在干什么？- 哦。抱歉。它太滑了。
- What are you doing? - Oh. Sorry. It's so slippery.

588
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:18,670
- 嘿。嘿。- 小心点。
- Hey. Hey. - Heads up.

589
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:20,005
好的，别再这样做了。
Okay, don't do that again.

590
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:23,409
嘿，我能跟那个，呃，房间里的婴儿说句话吗？
Hey, can I address the, uh, infant in the room?

591
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,511
呃...这些人是谁？
Uh... Who are these guys?

592
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,246
这些就是深度伪造了我们节目的出色孩子们。
These are the wonderful kids that deepfaked our show.

593
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,948
- 什么？ - 是的。
- What? - Yeah.

594
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,883
你让警察来我家了？
You had the cops sent to my house?

595
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,585
- 你吓到我的孩子们了。 - 嗯，抱歉。
- You freaked out my kids. - Yeah, sorry.

596
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:34,920
- 对此表示抱歉。 - 对此感到抱歉。
- Sorry about that. - Sorry about that.

597
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,422
孩子们都好吧？
How are the kids, though?

598
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,156
你为那种无聊的郊区生活抛弃了我们，现在过得如何？
How is the whole boring suburban life you left us for?

599
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,725
嘿，放轻松，伙计。你那一枪打空了。
Hey, relax, man. You missed your shot.

600
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,527
- 嗯。- 看到那块石头有多大了吗？
- Hmm. - See the size of that rock?

601
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,994
不，让我瞧瞧。
No, let me see that.

602
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,663
哇，虽比不上“心之钻”，但也够让人惊叹了。
Ooh, it's no Heart Diamond, but it's impressive.

603
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:49,568
丹尼，我已经跟你说过，那时我怀着六个月的身孕，尝试倒吊在拘束衣里脱身实在太危险了。
I already told you, Danny. I didn't feel safe trying to escape from a straitjacket hanging upside down.

604
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,069
- 所以没敢尝试。 - 得了吧。
- I was six months pregnant. - Come on.

605
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,738
本来最后会让你翻过来的。
We would have flipped you right side up at the end.

606
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:53,905
你不会有事的。
You'd have been fine.

607
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,273
- 得了吧。- 你们压根就没想我。
- Come on. - You guys didn't even miss me.

608
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:58,043
你们花了多久找到替代者？一下午吗？
How long did it take you to replace me? An afternoon?

609
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:00,312
嗯，花了差不多一整个晚上的时间。
Um, and the better part of an evening.

610
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:02,881
嘿，说到这个，卢拉怎么样了？
Hey, speaking of, how is Lula?

611
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,517
- 你们俩还在一起吗，呃... - 没在一起了。
- Are you guys still, uh... - No.

612
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:06,952
她，呃...她搬到巴黎去了。
She, uh... she moved to Paris.

613
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,254
哦，不。她甩了伟大的 J·怀尔德。我的天啊。
Oh, no. She dumped the great J. Wilder. My God.

614
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,422
对不起。抱歉。
I'm sorry. My apologies.

615
00:38:10,456 --> 00:38:12,791
你不是应该在某艘游轮上自取其辱吗？
Don't you need to be on some, like, cruise ship somewhere humiliating yourself?

616
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:14,426
- 自取其辱？ - 没错。
- Humiliating myself? - Yeah.

617
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,728
我每次巡游能赚五位数的收入，外加额外福利。
I make five figures per cruise, plus perks.

618
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,364
“外加福利。”他说，“外加福利。”
"Plus perks." He said, "plus perks."

619
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:21,066
我还以为梅里特在墨西哥酗酒至死已经够令人沮丧的了。哦。
And I thought Merritt drinking himself to death in Mexico was depressing. Ooh.

620
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,034
说到这个，我得回去工作了。
Speaking of, I got to get back to it.

621
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:25,571
这肝脏不会自我毁灭。
This liver's not gonna destroy itself.

622
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,607
我们能把它干船坞化吗？
Uh, can we dry dock this thing?

623
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,041
等等，等等，等等。你要走了？
Wait, wait, wait. You're leaving?

624
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:32,310
嗯，是的，我是说，聊得很愉快。
Well, yeah, I mean, great catching up.

625
00:38:32,344 --> 00:38:35,614
嗯，我不知道，什么，十年后再见？
Um, I don't know, what, see you in another ten?

626
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,783
很高兴认识你们，小蝌蚪们。
Nice to meet you, little tadpoles.

627
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,284
再见。
Adios.

628
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,286
是的，你知道吗？我也要走了。
Yeah, you know what? I'm out of here, too.

629
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,388
我有个演出要去。
I have a gig to get to.

630
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,489
是吗？他们给你报销优步吗？
Really? They're covering your Uber?

631
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,457
签了保密协议。一个字都不能说。
Signed an NDA. Can't say a word.

632
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,526
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

633
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,628
六个人都试过了，没一个能打开。
Six handles and none of them open it.

634
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,497
你以为你在跟谁说话？闪开。
Who do you think you're talking to? Move.

635
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,566
抱歉，我实在不太清楚你们之间是怎么回事。
I'm sorry, but I don't really know what's going on with you guys.

636
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,836
我感觉这里面有很多奇怪的历史，气氛有点尴尬。
I'm getting the feeling there's a lot of weird history here, and things are a little awkward.

637
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,006
是的，你们，你们曾经就是天启四骑士。
Yeah, you guys, you used to be the Horsemen.

638
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,142
我不明白。你们为什么解散了？
I don't get it. Why did you break up?

639
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,611
问他们。问问他们为什么我们解散了。
Ask them. Ask them why we broke up.

640
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,112
如果由我来决定，我们是不会解散的。
If it was up to me, we wouldn't have.

641
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,518
- 天眼希望我们... - 不，不对。
- The Eye wanted us to... - No, no.

642
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,020
...揭发一个俄罗斯军火商。
...expose a Russian arms dealer.

643
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,955
我们非得再经历一次吗？
Do we really have to live through this again?

644
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:21,760
我们犯了些大错，变得... - 粗心大意。 - 目中无人。
We made some huge mistakes, we got... - Sloppy. - Cocky.

645
00:39:21,793 --> 00:39:25,296
由于我们的努力，迪伦·施赖克将永远无法踏出俄罗斯监狱之外。
Because of us, Dylan Shrike will never see the outside of a Russian prison again.

646
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,499
- 谁？ - 迪伦·施赖克。明白吗？
- Who? - Dylan Shrike. Okay?

647
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,668
他是“四骑士”之一。拜托，你做点功课啊，伙计。
He's a Horseman. Come on. Do your homework, man.

648
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,871
实在抱歉。各位，我事先完全不知情。
I'm so sorry. Guys, I had no idea.

649
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,272
什么，他要永远困在里面了？
What, he's stuck in there forever?

650
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,942
这显然是个悲剧，而我永远都不会原谅自己。
Which is obviously a tragedy and something I'll never forgive myself for.

651
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,009
- 我也不会。 - 好的，老兄。
- Nor will I. - Yeah, fine, man.

652
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,077
但这并不意味着你就得放弃。
But it didn't mean you have to quit.

653
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:43,982
天呐，真是...太让人扫兴了，各位。真的很抱歉。
Man, that is, uh... It's really a bummer, guys. Sorry about that.

654
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,085
"扫兴"？
"A bummer"?

655
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:53,058
我...我...真佩服你们这代人能把事情总结得这么生动形象。
I... I... I love the way your generation sums things up so eloquently.

656
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:57,496
我想说，谁能给我解释下为什么这些青春期前的孩子会出现在这儿。
I mean, someone explain to me why these pre-pubes are even here.

657
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:59,164
和你一样的原因，哥们。
Same reason you are, man.

658
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,266
天眼组织想要他们。
The Eye wanted 'em.

659
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,535
嗯，我们拿到了心脏。
Well, we got the Heart.

660
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:05,203
天眼组织接下来要我们做什么？
What does The Eye want us to do next?

661
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,338
- 不知道。- 我只知道一件事。
- No idea. - I know one thing.

662
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:10,642
你手上拿着颗价值五亿美元的钻石。
You've got a half a billion dollar diamond in your hands.

663
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,711
- 他们会联系的。- 对，很可能。
- They're gonna get in touch. - Yeah, probably.

664
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,046
哇，等等，等等。阿特拉斯，我能看看你的卡片吗？
Whoa, wait, wait. Atlas, can I see your card?

665
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,648
是啊。
Yeah.

666
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,755
嗯
Hmm.

667
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,056
- 哇哦。- 这是一张地图。
- Whoa. - It's a map.

668
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:32,764
- 嘿，阿特拉斯，是你爸爸。- 不，这是……这是一张只有在"四骑士"齐聚时才会显现的地图。
- Hey, Atlas, it's your dad. - No, it's... It's a map that only reveals itself when the Horsemen are together.

669
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,067
- 想得美。- 真的假的，伙计？
- Fat chance. - Really, dude?

670
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:40,205
拜托，《天眼》显然希望你们接手这事。
I mean, come on, The Eye obviously wants you guys to do this.

671
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,474
你们是四骑士。拿出点样子来。
You're the Horsemen. Start acting like it.

672
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:48,514
好吧。
All right.

673
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:51,282
我想罗萨里托可以等几天。
I suppose Rosarito can wait a couple days.

674
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:56,254
我…我可以试着调整一下这个演出时间。
I... I can try to reschedule this gig.

675
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,624
虽然不容易，但我会想办法解决的。
It's not gonna be easy, but I'll figure it out.

676
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:03,328
说真的，我其实还挺怀念跟你们一起逃命、跳屋顶的日子。
I mean, I have kind of missed running for my life and jumping off roofs with you guys.

677
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,397
- 很高兴你回来了。 - 谢了。
- It's good to have you back. - Thanks.

678
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:08,333
好的，那这地方是哪儿？
Okay, so where is this place?

679
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,979
我们在这儿应该做什么？
What are we supposed to be doing here?

680
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,748
灵眼会让我们知道的。
The Eye will let us know.

681
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,250
- 好吧，拍照时间。 - 你在做什么？
- All right, picture time. - What are you doing?

682
00:41:25,283 --> 00:41:26,618
拍张合影。这是情侣现在都会做的事。
Taking a photo. That's what couples do now.

683
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,820
请不要发布照片 - 关于这个绝密地点。 - 别吃醋。
Please don't post photos - of the top secret location. - Don't be jealous.

684
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:29,988
我知道你想一起合影。
I know you want to be in it.

685
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:31,389
- 对。 - 我可不想一起合影。
- Yeah. - I don't want to be in it.

686
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,958
-  因为它能用来…… - 保存记忆。
- Because it can be used for... - For memories.

687
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,325
-  不，不是记忆。 - 当作证据。
- No, not memories. - Evidence.

688
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,632
哈。我从未见过这样的门。
Huh. I've never seen a door like this.

689
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,336
好吧，我打不开它。
Okay, I can't open it.

690
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,638
你能行吗，杰克？
You got this, Jack?

691
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,774
等等。你不是说"六月"吗？
Wait. Don't you mean "June"?

692
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:51,610
- 杰克是我们开锁的。 - 哇哦。
- Jack's our lockpick. - Whoa.

693
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:54,279
看起来是场有益的小较量。
Looks like a little healthy competish.

694
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,681
拜托，这也太不公平了。
Come on, this isn't fair.

695
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:57,315
我干这行的时候她还没出生呢。
I've been picking locks since before she was born.

696
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,786
让我来找到锁眼。
Let me find the keyhole.

697
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:02,520
- 或许在另一面。- 没错，它在下面。
- Maybe the other side. - Yeah, it's underneath.

698
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:06,091
你现在可没法给人信心，杰克。
You're not inspiring confidence right now, Jack.

699
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,626
- 他领会了。- 嗯。
- He's got it. - Hmm.

700
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,160
- 他领会了。- 感觉生疏了？
- He's got it. - Feeling rusty?

701
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,195
别催我。
Don't rush me.

702
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,599
他什么时候开始撬锁？
When does he start the lock picking?

703
00:42:13,632 --> 00:42:16,802
嘿，杰克，我觉得这锁不能用撬的。
Hey, Jack, I don't think this is a lock you pick.

704
00:42:16,835 --> 00:42:19,137
这锁得用解谜的方式来开。那么……
I think it's a lock you solve. So...

705
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,943
给他示范一下怎么做。
Show him how it's done.

706
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,344
哇哦。
Whoa.

707
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,079
你介意我快速摸索一下吗？
Do you mind if I just figure this out real quickly?

708
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,950
好的。
Okay.

709
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:41,760
如果你曾体验过密室逃脱，就会知道其中包含各式各样的谜题。
If you've ever done an escape room, you'd know there are all kinds of different puzzles.

710
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:45,230
这并非只是关于锁和钥匙那么简单。
It's not just about locks and keys.

711
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:46,632
- 哇。 - 嗯。
- Whoa. - Huh.

712
00:42:46,665 --> 00:42:48,333
你或许该升级一下游戏内容了，杰克。
You might want to update your game, Jack.

713
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:49,367
哇。
Whoa.

714
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,270
不过，请务必带路。
But, by all means, lead the way.

715
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,608
我认为他最终给她松开了。
I think he loosened it for her, ultimately.

716
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,844
- 哦。- 哦。
- Huh. - Ooh.

717
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,212
- 哇塞。- 我的天。
- Whoa. - Wow.

718
00:43:01,246 --> 00:43:02,781
嗯，这是哪儿？
Uh, what is this place?

719
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:04,415
奇幻书呆子的天堂。
Magic nerd heaven.

720
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,051
P.T. 塞尔比特的棺材？
P.T. Selbit's coffin?

721
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,054
看到了吗？
See?

722
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,089
伙计们，这可是霍迪尼的约束衣啊。
Guys, Houdini's straitjacket.

723
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,390
没错，就是它。
Yes, it is.

724
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,592
嘿，看在旧时光的份上，我能把你放进去吗？
Hey, can I put you in here for old time's sake?

725
00:43:14,626 --> 00:43:16,161
- 不 - 不想？
- No. - No?

726
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,228
我觉得挺好笑的。
I thought it was funny.

727
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:18,463
多谢了。你要进来吗？
Thanks a lot. You wanna come in?

728
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,166
- 不了 - 好吧。
- No. - Right.

729
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,537
查理，快来看看这个，兄弟。
Charlie, check this out, dude.

730
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:27,572
这是什么？
What is it?

731
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,240
子弹捕捉术。
Bullet catch.

732
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,441
不会吧！
No way!

733
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:33,244
哟！
Yo!

734
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,095
- 死路一条？ - 没错，死路一条。
- Dead end? - Yeah, dead end.

735
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,463
嘿，伙计们，死路一条。
Hey, guys, dead end.

736
00:43:52,497 --> 00:43:54,432
- 或者说，真是如此吗？ - 嗯。
- Or, is it? - Hmm.

737
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,837
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

738
00:44:01,206 --> 00:44:02,373
没错，就是这样。
Yeah, it is.

739
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,278
嗯，这有点奇怪。
Hmm, that's weird.

740
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:14,219
骰子应该在这里，球应该在这里。
The die should be here and the ball should be here.

741
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,893
- 哇。 - 干得漂亮。
- Whoa. - Well played.

742
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:22,928
这没什么。
It's nothing.

743
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,095
四行。
Four rows.

744
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:27,565
一、五、八、四？这是个密码吗？
One, five, eight, four? Is it a code?

745
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,768
- 一，一，五，六，18……减四。
- One, one, five, six, 18... - Minus four.

746
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,102
- 一，八，九？十五，八十四。
- One, eight, nine? - Fifteen, eighty-four.

747
00:44:31,136 --> 00:44:34,272
- 1584 年。- 这是……《巫术揭秘》。
- 1584. - Wha... The Discoverie of Witchcraft.

748
00:44:34,305 --> 00:44:35,573
这是第一部关于舞台魔术的书籍。
It's the first book on stage magic.

749
00:44:35,606 --> 00:44:36,641
就在这本书出版的时候。
It's when it was published.

750
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,176
天啊，他怎么知道的？
God, how does he know that?

751
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:40,478
呃，他基本上就是个装满无用信息的电脑。
Uh, he's basically a computer full of useless information.

752
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,947
哼。
Huh.

753
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,859
“没用”？
"Useless"?

754
00:44:58,363 --> 00:44:59,564
这太酷了。
This is cool.

755
00:45:03,001 --> 00:45:05,403
- 不可思议。 - 干得漂亮。
- Unreal. - Nice.

756
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,984
嘿，朋友们，这是这座城堡的平面图。
Hey, guys, it's the floor plan of the chateau.

757
00:45:19,818 --> 00:45:21,820
但总感觉有哪里不一样。
But it's different somehow.

758
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:25,523
上变成了下。
Up is down.

759
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,726
左变成了右。
Left is right.

760
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,397
连房间都在耍花招。
Even the rooms are tricks.

761
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,667
我的骑士们。
My Horsemen.

762
00:45:36,701 --> 00:45:38,436
撒迪厄斯！
Thaddeus!

763
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,907
- 真高兴见到你。
- 我也很高兴见到你，亲爱的。
- So good to see you. - So good to see you, darling.

764
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,642
你完全可以看门铃摄像头的，直接给我们开门就行了。
You could've just checked the Ring camera and buzzed us in.

765
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,711
这样还有什么乐趣可言？
Now, where's the fun in that?

766
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,746
先生。你好，我是查理。
Sir. Hi, I'm Charlie.

767
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:51,482
- 我是您的忠实粉丝。- 你好，查理。
- I'm such a big fan of yours. - Hi, Charlie.

768
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:54,986
呃……我从未亲眼见过这么大的卢博尔透镜。
Um... I've never seen a Lubor Lens this big in person.

769
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,688
真的吗？那你可还没见识过呢。
Really? Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.

770
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,726
所以塔罗牌是你寄的吗？
So you sent the tarot cards?

771
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,994
不是。
No.

772
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:07,833
不，我早就放弃了这种愚蠢行为，以及你们集体的失能。
No, I've long since given up such foolishness, and your collective dysfunction.

773
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,637
不，现在我仅有的魔法是逗孙辈开心。
No, the only magic I do nowadays is for my grandchildren.

774
00:46:14,372 --> 00:46:28,086
然而几周前，一张卡片悄然出现在我家门阶上，警告我需为七位即将成为法外之徒的访客准备这座城堡。
Some weeks ago, however, a card did appear on my doorstep, warning me to prepare this chateau for the arrival of seven soon-to-be fugitives from the law.

775
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,587
- 这样说得通。- 没错。
- That tracks. - Yeah.

776
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,389
等等，那么为什么目力会希望我们来这里呢？
Wait, so why does The Eye want us here?

777
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:37,929
我只能猜测，无论他们想要你下一步做什么，都隐藏在这些墙壁的某个地方。
Well, I can only assume that whatever it is they want you to do next is hidden somewhere in these walls.

778
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:44,702
你看，这座鲁西永城堡，曾经是他们的家。
See, this chateau, Chateau Roussillon, used to be their home.

779
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:51,642
1943 年，盟军需要从各种渠道获得军事奇迹。
In 1943, the Allies needed military miracles from every source.

780
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:58,649
他们招揽了当时一些最有才华的魔术师来协助。
They enlisted the aid of some of the most talented magicians of the time.

781
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:08,393
他们利用泥土、纸板、灯光以及成千上万个充气橡胶坦克建造了一座完整的城市，以误导德军。
They built a whole city using mud, cardboard, lights, thousands of inflatable rubber tanks to misdirect the Germans.

782
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,295
贾斯珀·马斯基林的天才之作。
The genius of Jasper Maskelyne.

783
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:13,498
有人了解他的历史。
Somebody knows his history.

784
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:16,167
等等，那么纳粹与这颗钻石有什么关系呢？
Wait, so, what do the Nazis have to do with the diamond?

785
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,237
那个，我不知道。
That, I do not know.

786
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,873
但答案就在这里某个地方。
But the answer is here somewhere.

787
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:25,110
我们只需开始寻找。
We just have to start looking.

788
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,480
- 范登伯格女士。
- 范登伯格女士。
- Ms. Vanderberg. - Ms. Vanderberg.

789
00:47:29,514 --> 00:47:33,118
对于有关贵公司只是洗钱幌子的传闻，你们作何回应？
How do you respond to the rumors that your company is nothing but a front for money laundering?

790
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:40,525
这些所谓的"骑士"不过是伪装成反资本主义表演者的窃贼，他们毫无道理地针对我和我的优秀企业。
The Horsemen are thieves posing as anti-capitalist entertainers, and they have unfairly targeted me and my good company.

791
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:45,696
我挑战任何诽谤我们的人，请仔细审查我们的运营状况和账目记录。
I challenge anyone who maligns us to look closely at our operations and our books.

792
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:50,668
同时我要求警方将这些变戏法之徒送回应有的归宿——历史的尘埃中去。
And I challenge police to put those magicians back where they belong, in the past.

793
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,338
好吧，没有更多问题了。
All right, no more questions.

794
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,540
请不要再提问了！谢谢！
No more questions, please! Thank you!

795
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:13,124
国际刑警组织称此为内部人员所为。
Interpol said it was an inside job.

796
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:15,326
窃贼非常清楚盲点的位置。
Thieves knew exactly where the blind spots were.

797
00:48:20,265 --> 00:48:22,300
-  怎么样？- 让我猜猜。
- How was it? - Let me guess.

798
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:25,736
你是那些骑士和他们的小马夫背后的主谋。
You're the one behind these Horsemen and their little stable hands.

799
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:28,273
不。我为什么要先索要钻石，然后试图去偷它呢？
No. Why would I ask for the diamond and then try to steal it?

800
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,011
如果我是你，我会想方设法尽快把它拿回来。
If I were you, I'd figure out a way to get it back, and fast.

801
00:48:34,212 --> 00:48:37,682
我得知你和你的车队将于本周晚些时候抵达阿布扎比。
I understand that you and your race team will be in Abu Dhabi later this week.

802
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,650
一个绝佳的中立地带。
A perfect neutral ground.

803
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:40,918
我会带上我的证据。
I'll bring my evidence.

804
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:43,654
你带上你的良心，假如你有的话。
You bring your Heart, if you have one.

805
00:48:43,688 --> 00:48:45,256
我……
I...

806
00:48:47,292 --> 00:48:49,927
-你们找到他们了吗？-我们已经掌握了一些线索。
- Have you found them yet? - We do have a few leads.

807
00:48:49,961 --> 00:48:52,497
有人看到他们往南离开了比利时。
They were seen headed south out of Belgium.

808
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,401
有消息称一小时前，四骑士在法国被目击到了。
Now they're saying the Horsemen have been seen in France one hour ago.

809
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,236
法国警察的头儿欠我人情。
The head of the French police owes me.

810
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:02,240
直接打电话给他，就说我要这几位骑士的人头摆在盘子里端上来。
Just call him and say that I want these Horsemen's heads served up on a platter.

811
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,443
宪兵队会找到他们的，我对此深信不疑。
The gendarme will find them. I'm sure of it.

812
00:49:07,045 --> 00:49:08,579
撒迪厄斯吩咐我们寻找某样东西。
Thaddeus told us to look for something.

813
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:09,947
你认为这是什么？
What do you think it is?

814
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:14,819
哇，太酷了。
Oh, wow. This is cool.

815
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:18,423
你不喜欢多说话。
You are not a big talker.

816
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:20,625
噢，抱歉。
Oh. Sorry.

817
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:22,727
但你可真够能道歉的。
But you are a big apologizer.

818
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,030
- 对不起。 - 我又来了。
- Sorry. - I just did it again.

819
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:27,065
对不起。我的意思是...我只是太紧张了。
Sorry. I mean... I'm just nervous.

820
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,899
我是你们的忠实粉丝。
I'm a big fan of you guys.

821
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:34,472
结果把警察都招来了，我真是...我真是...我不想说了。
And I got the cops called in, and I'm really... I'm really... I'm not gonna say it.

822
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:36,741
原谅你了。
You're forgiven.

823
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:39,244
而且你们让四骑士大放异彩。
And you guys made the Horsemen look good.

824
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:42,247
但我没见到你。你怎么没参加？
But I didn't see you. Why weren't you in it?

825
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,516
我只是...更喜欢在幕后工作，你懂的。
Oh, I just... I prefer to be behind the scenes, you know.

826
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:47,985
所有的戏法都是我设计的。
I design all of our tricks.

827
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,787
呃，我们要去哪里？我感觉我们迷路了。
Um, where are we going? I feel like we're lost.

828
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,158
你当真喜欢这样，还是说这不过是你用来逃避的借口？
Do you really prefer that, or is that just something you hide behind?

829
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,693
呃，你这话是什么意思？
Uh, what do you mean?

830
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,563
嗯，我...哇哦。
Well, I... Whoa.

831
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:05,103
这么多年来，我一直告诉自己我想当个助理，不介意被阿特拉斯抢了风头，因为他太出色了。
For years, I told myself I wanted to be an assistant, that I didn't mind being upstaged by Atlas, 'cause he's so brilliant.

832
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:08,005
但说真的，我只是...我只是害怕。
But really, I just... I was afraid.

833
00:50:09,207 --> 00:50:12,177
我害怕成为众人瞩目的焦点。
I was afraid to take the spotlight.

834
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:19,217
噢，撒迪厄斯说得没错，上即是下。
Ooh. Thaddeus was right. Up is down.

835
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,530
倒置的房间，真酷。
Upside down room. Cool.

836
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:34,965
酷吗？
Cool?

837
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,834
对你来说没什么能打动你的吗？
Is nothing impressive to you?

838
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,769
所以我才说"真酷"。
That's why I said "cool."

839
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:40,538
你不知道"酷"是什么意思吗？
Do you not know what cool means?

840
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:43,474
好吧，咱们先试着搞清楚这房间怎么运作，好吗？
All right, let's just try to figure out how this room works, okay?

841
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:44,842
对
Yeah.

842
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:51,682
搞清楚了。
Figured it out.

843
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:53,318
当然。没错。你已经什么都知道了。
Of course. That's right. You know everything already.

844
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:55,386
那我这次又是哪里做错了？
So what did I do wrong this time?

845
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,755
啊，没事。我向你道歉。
Ah, nothing. My apologies.

846
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,690
你太了不起了。能看你表演是我的荣幸。
You're amazing. It's an honor to watch you.

847
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:03,060
有没有人说过你是个控制狂？
Has anyone ever told you that you're a control freak?

848
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,262
有啊。很多次都有人这么说过。
Yep. Many times.

849
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,502
哇！嘿！
Whoa! Hey!

850
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,040
我还真搞明白了。
I did figure it out.

851
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:25,550
哇哦，厉害。
Whoa. Wow.

852
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,730
软糖起效了。
Gummies kicked in.

853
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,371
我很好奇我们在找什么。
I wonder what we're looking for.

854
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:48,072
任何奇怪的东西。
Anything weird.

855
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,040
- 这一切都很诡异。- 天啊。
- This is all weird. - Jesus.

856
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,143
看看这个。
Look at this.

857
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:59,083
你知道 我一直都很钦佩你
You know, I have always looked up to you.

858
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,418
是吗
Oh, yeah?

859
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,887
在你成为游轮魔术师之前就是
Yeah, before you became a cruise ship magician.

860
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,622
嘿 我也承办企业活动啊
Hey, I also do corporate events.

861
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:06,291
哦，怎么可能。我都没看出来。
Oh, no way. I couldn't tell.

862
00:52:08,092 --> 00:52:10,428
那完全是浪费时间。现在怎么办？
So that was a total waste. What now?

863
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,864
一个小把戏。懂吗？没有魅力，没有口若悬河的才华。就一个小把戏。
One trick. Okay? No charm, no gifts of gabs. Just one trick.

864
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:16,033
老兄，我没必要向你证明自己。
Dude, I do not have to prove myself to you.

865
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,202
我的意思是，你差不多就是这么做了。
I mean, you kind of do.

866
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,603
让我看看为何你被选中了。
Show me why The Eye picked you.

867
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,406
你知道吗？
You know what?

868
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:23,474
向我证明你不需要看护。
Prove to me that you don't need a babysitter.

869
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,878
哦，怎么，现在不表演了？
Oh, what, now you stop performing?

870
00:52:27,912 --> 00:52:30,114
你那帮格格不入的朋友不在，你就不显摆了？
You're done showing off 'cause your misfit friends aren't here?

871
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,082
- 他们是我的家人。- 嗯哼。
- They're my family. - Mm-hmm.

872
00:52:32,116 --> 00:52:33,818
你少来。我才不需要给他们留下好印象。
Don't you dare. I don't have to impress them.

873
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:35,052
好吧，算了，就这样吧。
All right, fine. Forget it.

874
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:40,191
我只是想看看，当你不是为了博取廉价的掌声而努力时，能做到什么程度，但看来答案是——什么都做不了。
I just wanted to see what you were capable of when you weren't trying to win cheap applause, but I guess the answer is nothing.

875
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:46,297
行。你想看个魔术吗？
All right. You wanna see a magic trick?

876
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:50,835
你看，你的问题就在于，阿特拉斯，你总喜欢把事情搞得过于复杂，伙计。
See, the problem with you, Atlas, is that you just like to overcomplicate things, man.

877
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:55,172
找钻石可比你想的容易得多。
It is a lot easier to find a diamond than you think.

878
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:59,076
- 噢。——然后让它......消失。
- Ooh. - And to make it... ...disappear.

879
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,578
- 漂亮。——看看你口袋。
- Nice. - Check your pocket.

880
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:01,646
- 真的吗？——是的。
- Really? - Yeah.

881
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,314
嗯。
Hmm.

882
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:06,251
哦，不错嘛。把卡片变到不可思议的地方去了。
Ooh, not bad. Card to impossible location.

883
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:09,920
但你可别在棋盘上下跳棋，因为我早已领先你五步之遥。
But don't play checkers on a chessboard because I'm already five steps ahead of you.

884
00:53:09,954 --> 00:53:10,988
看看你的口袋。
Check your pocket.

885
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,924
你好。
Hey.

886
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,627
- 这些都是价值连城的古董。
- 没错。
- Those are priceless antiques. - Yeah.

887
00:53:16,661 --> 00:53:20,197
这个房间是古老遗物归于永眠的场所。
This room is where old relics go to their final resting place.

888
00:53:20,231 --> 00:53:23,868
是的，你...你说得对，撒迪厄斯。
Yep. You are, uh... You're probably right, Thaddeus.

889
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:27,838
但是，在追逐荣耀之前，他们还有最后一次机会。
But, uh, not before they have one last shot at glory.

890
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:31,175
- 这到底是怎么回事？ - 做得还不错，但你应该试着把事情做得稍微慢一点。
- What's going on here? - Pretty good, but you should try to do things a little more slow.

891
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,310
真的吗？
Really?

892
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:34,712
让你的观众享受真正的魔力吧。
Let your audience enjoy the real magic.

893
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:37,047
- 好的，- 还不错。还行。- 哇。
Okay, - not bad. Not bad. - Wow.

894
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:38,283
干得漂亮，博斯科。
Nice one, Bosco.

895
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:44,221
我玩扑克牌从来不在行，但方块能赢过红心吗？
I've never been great at poker, but is a diamond trumped by a heart?

896
00:53:45,356 --> 00:53:47,525
- 噢，这下好了。- 呼。
- Ooh. There it is. - Whoo.

897
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:51,529
很棒的误导，但是，别忘了——这到底是怎么回事。- 我还没说完。
Nice misdirection, but, let's not forget - what this is really about. - I wasn't done.

898
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,465
- 给他们看看，查理。- 让一颗宝石消失。
- Show 'em, Charlie. - Making a jewel disappear.

899
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:55,766
- 来看看这个。- 好的。
- Let's see this one. - All right.

900
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,968
紧盯目标。
Keep your eye on the prize.

901
00:53:58,002 --> 00:54:01,806
他们转啊转啊，没人知道他们会停在哪里。
Round and round they go, where they stop, nobody knows.

902
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:04,141
- 和消失了一样。 - 噢。
- Good as gone. - Ooh.

903
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,044
黑魔法，桌子被动了手脚，我进来时就看到了。
Black art, table's rigged, saw it when I came in.

904
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,314
- 是时候干净利落地逃走了。 - 哦，是的。
- Time for a clean escape. - Oh, yeah.

905
00:54:09,347 --> 00:54:11,516
- 他去哪儿了？ - 我知道他在干什么。
- Where is he going? - I know what he's doing.

906
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,386
整人玩具盒？那是把戏？
Jack in the box? That's a trick?

907
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,823
啊，老把戏了。
Ah, it's old stuff.

908
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:21,258
早知道他那么好对付。
If I had known he was that easy to get rid of.

909
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,927
- 没那么容易。- 没错，杰克。
- Not that easy. - Yeah, Jack.

910
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,031
哦！好吧，暖场表演到此结束，现在是主角登场的时间了。
Ohh! Okay, enough of the warm-up act, time for the headliner.

911
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:34,339
我要你从这些牌里选一张，但别选你觉得我想让你选的那张。
I want you to think of one of these cards, but don't think of the one you think I want you to think of.

912
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:35,873
- 选好了吗？- 是的，我选好了。
- Got one? - Yeah, I got one.

913
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:39,610
- 你刚才出的什么牌？ - 红桃四。
- What was your card? - Four of hearts.

914
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:42,246
哈哈。
Ha-ha.

915
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:45,215
干得漂亮啊，教授。我服了。真服了。
Nice one, professor. I'm impressed. I'm impressed.

916
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,552
喂。喂。喂。那威士忌比你年纪都大。
Hey. Hey. Hey. That whiskey is older than you.

917
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:49,454
老板，对不起。真的很抱歉。
Sorry, boss. So sorry.

918
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:51,121
听着，伙计们，我不骗你们。
Look, you guys, I'm not gonna lie.

919
00:54:51,155 --> 00:54:52,523
这真的很棒。
This has been really cool.

920
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:54,058
- 真的非常棒。- 去秀给他们看。
- Really, really cool. - Go show 'em.

921
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:57,462
不过，嗯，我觉得得让它变得更酷一点。
But, uh, I think I just want to make it a little cooler.

922
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,963
- 来吧，对！- 嘿。
- Come on now, yeah! - Hey.

923
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:00,898
- 她过去了。- 是的！中国的暴风雪。
- There she goes. - Yes! Snow storm in China.

924
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,469
- 我们到了。- 太美了。
- There we are. - Beautiful.

925
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:07,738
在冬天我总是穿白色衣服，各位。
I always wear white in winter, guys.

926
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:13,978
法国这一带很少下雪，但是结冰呢？那简直不可能。
Snow is rare in this part of France, but, ice, that is just impossible.

927
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:17,948
- 经典。 - 漂亮。
- Classic. - Nice.

928
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:19,484
你是怎么把消失魔术做得这么好的？
How do you do a vanish so good?

929
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,352
- 魔术师的秘密绝不透露。- 嗯？
- Oh, a magician never tells. - Hmm?

930
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,521
- 哦，嗯。- 将军。
- Ooh. Hmm. - Check.

931
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,456
将死了？
Mate?

932
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:26,457
糟糕。
Shit.

933
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:27,958
接受现实吧，博斯科。
Face it, Bosco.

934
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:31,128
智慧与技艺总能战胜年轻气盛与自大轻狂。
Wisdom and skill overcome youth and arrogance every time.

935
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,663
谢谢。
Thank you.

936
00:55:32,697 --> 00:55:34,765
永远不要自以为房间里最聪明，用行动证明它。
Never assume you're the smartest guy in the room. Prove it.

937
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,934
得了吧，老兄。你根本什么都没证明。
Give me a break, man. You didn't prove anything.

938
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:41,606
各位容我提醒一句，咱们还没搞明白为什么会困在这二战遗迹里呢？
Hey, can I just remind everyone we still haven't figured out why we're even in this World War II relic?

939
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:42,940
等等！
Wait!

940
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:47,378
贾斯珀·马斯基林，那个...那个击溃纳粹的魔术师。
Jasper Maskelyne, the... the magician who vanquished the Nazis.

941
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:50,915
他建造了假城市，假坦克。
He built fake cities, fake tanks.

942
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:52,917
我是说...我想知道...
I mean... I wonder...

943
00:56:05,162 --> 00:56:06,431
- 哇哦。- 哦。
- Whoa. - Oh.

944
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:07,565
哦，天哪。
Oh, wow.

945
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,471
哦，我的天呐，我猜对了吗？
Oh, my God, I was right?

946
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,941
嘿，魔术入门课第一条，当把戏真奏效时，可别表现得很惊讶。
Hey, Magic 101, man, never act surprised when the trick actually works.

947
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:18,308
哦，抱歉。
Oh, sorry.

948
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,817
- 哦，我的老天。- 这些都是什么？
- Oh, my goodness. - What is all that?

949
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,886
纳粹战犯名录。
Encyclopedia of Nazi war criminals.

950
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:32,222
呃，显然维罗妮卡的父亲也在其中。
Uh, which apparently includes Veronika's dad.

951
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:35,025
二战结束后，幸存的纳粹分子逃往世界各地。
After World War II, surviving Nazis fled around the world.

952
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:39,363
我不是会计，但看起来彼得·范德伯格靠清洗他们的黑钱发了财。
I'm not an accountant, but looks like Peter Vanderberg got rich cleaning their dirty money.

953
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:43,233
是的，而且维罗妮卡显然继承了他的犯罪网络，在他中断的地方继续发展。
Yeah, and apparently Veronika took over right where he left off using his criminal network.

954
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:44,635
但是……但是我不明白。
But... But I don't understand.

955
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:46,537
神眼组织想让我们用这个做什么？
What does The Eye want us to do with this?

956
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:58,649
嗯，如果我没猜错的话，神眼组织想让我们揭露范德堡家族，一举扳倒两代罪犯。
Well, if I'm not mistaken, The Eye wants us to unmask the Vanderbergs, bring down two generations of criminals with a single sleight of hand.

957
00:56:58,683 --> 00:57:02,186
我在网上看到一些关于范德伯格家有趣的传闻。
I've read some interesting rumors about the Vanderbergs online.

958
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:08,025
据说十五年前，韦罗妮卡的妈妈自杀身亡，一周后他们家的女佣刹车失灵。
Looks like 15 years ago, Veronika's mom killed herself, and a week later, their housekeeper's brakes failed.

959
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:11,195
她的车撞毁了，她和儿子都因此丧生。
Her car crashed, she and her son died.

960
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:15,232
当时有些涉嫌作案的怀疑，但始终没有证据。
There was some suspicion of foul play, but nothing was ever proven.

961
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,601
嗯。
Hmm.

962
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,402
- 哇哦。- 哦，见鬼。
- Whoa. - Oh, shit.

963
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:27,678
警察！
Police!

964
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:29,847
等等，等等，等等。
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

965
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,049
仔细听着，分散行动。
Listen closely. Split up.

966
00:57:32,082 --> 00:57:34,018
- 找出逃生路线，快走，快走。- 好的，来吧，我们走。
- Find a way out. Go. Go. - Okay. Come on, let's go.

967
00:57:34,051 --> 00:57:35,419
- 他说得对。- 大家都分散开。
- He's right. - Everybody split up.

968
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,854
好，我们走。
Okay, let's go.

969
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:58,208
这边，这边！
This way, this way!

970
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,513
停下！
Stop!

971
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,787
- 转身。 - 转过身来。
- Turn around. - Turn around.

972
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,925
- 你听到他说的了，博斯科。 - 转过去。
- You heard him, Bosco. - Turn around.

973
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,469
他们来了！
Here they come!

974
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:53,030
再会了，朋友。
Adios, mon ami.

975
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,688
对不起！
Sorry!

976
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:23,393
您好，先生。您好。
Bonjour, monsieur. Bonjour.

977
00:59:23,427 --> 00:59:26,997
你知道的，通常我会为新来的客人好好介绍一下这里。
You know, normally, I like to give a proper tour to new guests.

978
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:33,170
我猜你已经发现这栋房子藏着不少秘密。
I suspect you've discovered that this house holds many secrets.

979
00:59:33,203 --> 00:59:34,238
撒迪厄斯！
Thaddeus!

980
00:59:41,011 --> 00:59:42,079
撒迪厄斯！
Thaddeus!

981
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:46,550
要不要看看魔术把戏？
Would you like to see a magic trick?

982
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:53,323
让我自己……消失怎么样？
How about if I make myself... disappear?

983
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:54,558
别动！
Don't move!

984
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,095
撒迪厄斯！
Thaddeus!

985
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,645
撒迪厄斯！
Thaddeus!

986
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,789
快！这边！
Hurry! This way!

987
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,224
萨德乌斯？
Thaddeus?

988
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,259
哦，感谢上帝。
Oh, thank God.

989
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:30,828
嘿，这边最快的出口在哪儿？
Hey, which is the fastest way out of here?

990
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,231
- 绕过这个弯...  - 行。
- Around this bend... - Yeah.

991
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:37,401
...就能看到一条通道。
...there's a passageway.

992
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:40,470
顺着林间的小溪一直走就行。
Just follow the creek through the forest.

993
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,040
- 哇哦。- 啊！
- Whoa. - Oh!

994
01:00:43,073 --> 01:00:45,442
噢，天哪。噢，别这样，别这样，别这样，千万别这样。不不不。
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.

995
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,477
这不可能发生。快点，萨迪厄斯，站起来。
This can't be happening. Come on, Thaddeus, stand up.

996
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:48,578
我们现在就走。
We're gonna go now.

997
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:50,414
你需要得到帮助。
We need to get you help.

998
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,917
请站起来。
Please, stand up.

999
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,754
你必须阻止维罗妮卡·范德伯格。
You have to stop Veronika Vanderberg.

1000
01:00:56,787 --> 01:00:59,623
不，没有你我们做不到，撒迪厄斯。
No, we can't do it without you, Thaddeus.

1001
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:02,760
你不需要我。
You don't need me.

1002
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:06,296
但你们彼此需要。
But you do need each other.

1003
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:09,767
永远别忘记这一点。
Never forget that.

1004
01:01:14,038 --> 01:01:21,545
当我来到此处时，我就知道，这恐怕...是我的最后一招了。
I knew when I came here, this was... probably my final trick.

1005
01:01:24,782 --> 01:01:28,352
现在，别让我白白牺牲。
Now, don't let me die in vain.

1006
01:01:31,388 --> 01:01:33,290
还有任务需要完成。
There's work to be done.

1007
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:41,231
快走。赶紧走，快走。求你了。
Go. Go now, go. Please.

1008
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:47,237
趁着……还来得及。
Before it's... too late.

1009
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,988
我们走。我们得走了。
Let's go. We gotta go.

1010
01:02:08,525 --> 01:02:09,593
阿特拉斯！
Atlas!

1011
01:02:36,821 --> 01:02:38,688
警察把琼恩拘留了起来。
The police took June into custody.

1012
01:02:38,722 --> 01:02:40,424
那杰克和梅里特呢？
Well, what about Jack and Merritt?

1013
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,526
- 他们也一样。- 好吧，那我们把他们救出来。
- Them, too. - Okay, so we break them out.

1014
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,028
哇，呃，不。我们先谈谈这事儿。
Whoa, uh-uh. Let's just talk about this for a second.

1015
01:02:44,061 --> 01:02:45,095
谈些什么？
Talk about what?

1016
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:46,263
听我说，我们需要保持理智。
Listen to me. We need to be smart.

1017
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,065
不行，我必须把我的朋友从监狱里救出来。
No. We gotta get my friend out of jail.

1018
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:51,735
- 博斯科... - 听着，当你调查我们的时候，你知道有什么信息没被查出来吗？
- Bosco... - Look, when you were researching all that stuff about us, you know what didn't come up?

1019
01:02:53,037 --> 01:02:54,538
查理和琼是我唯一的朋友。
Charlie and June are my only friends.

1020
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,007
你知道我最喜欢他们哪一点吗？
You know what I really love about them?

1021
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:58,708
他们没让我觉得像个混蛋。
They don't make me feel like an asshole.

1022
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:01,745
- 我要去找琼恩。 - 博斯科，等等... - 听我说。嘿。 - 等一下，老兄。
- I'm getting June. - Bosco, wait... - Listen to me. Hey. - Just one second, dude.

1023
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,847
- 听我说。 - 你不能。
- Listen to me. - You can't.

1024
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:03,881
为什么？告诉我原因。
Why? Tell me.

1025
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,182
他们正在找你，博斯科。
They're looking for you, Bosco.

1026
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,550
他们在追捕我们所有人。
They're looking for all of us.

1027
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,418
是的。是的，你也会被捕的。
Yes. Yes, you're gonna get arrested, too.

1028
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:09,419
没错。
Yes.

1029
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,720
- 妈的。- 没错。
- Shit. - Exactly.

1030
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:15,625
要是还有别的疯子，一穷二白毫无防护，却想搞越狱就好了。
If only there was somebody else crazy enough to stage a jailbreak with no resources, no protection.

1031
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:16,994
- 阿特拉斯。- 嗯？
- Atlas. - Yeah?

1032
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,097
也许真有一个。
Maybe there is.

1033
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:44,754
塔迪乌斯·马库斯·布拉德利，以防你想知道你刚才杀了谁。
Thaddeus Marcus Bradley, in case you're interested in the name of the man you just murdered.

1034
01:03:45,689 --> 01:03:47,524
哦，是的。
Ah, yes.

1035
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:50,027
那可真是遗憾。
That was unfortunate.

1036
01:03:51,528 --> 01:04:03,773
你知道吗，当这一切开始时，我根本不在乎你和你的钻石，但你却把事情变得极其私人和不可饶恕。
You know, when this whole thing started, I didn't give a shit about you or your diamond, but you just went and made it deeply personal.

1037
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:08,478
而现在，我真的迫不及待想要带你下去。
And now, I am really looking forward to taking you down.

1038
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:11,515
我父亲一定会很喜欢你。
My father would have loved you.

1039
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:13,417
他非常喜欢魔术。
He was quite fond of magic.

1040
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:19,990
在我五六岁的时候，在为数不多能和他独处的时刻里，他教了我一个魔术。
When I was five or six, in one of the few moments that I had him to myself, he taught me a trick.

1041
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:24,328
他会让一条红丝巾消失，然后又从嘴里变出来。
He would make a red silk handkerchief disappear and then come back out of his mouth.

1042
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:26,263
我简直太喜欢了！
I loved it!

1043
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:28,832
那表演的风度把握得恰到好处。
It had just the right amount of flair.

1044
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,936
为此我苦练那个戏法数月之久。
And I practiced that trick for months.

1045
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:38,976
我原以为只要做到恰到好处，就能获得更多…更多的他。
I thought that if I could do it just right, I would earn more of... of him.

1046
01:04:39,910 --> 01:04:41,611
但那只是幻象。
But that was the illusion.

1047
01:04:41,645 --> 01:04:44,548
自那以后我便痛恨魔法。
I've hated magic ever since.

1048
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:50,921
营地，奶酪，更不用提像你这种靠心灵魔术招摇撞骗的江湖术士。
The camp, the cheese, not to say anything of con artists like you with your mentalism.

1049
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:57,127
我们两个谁都没有超能力，麦金尼先生。
Neither one of us has psychic powers, Mr. McKinney.

1050
01:04:57,161 --> 01:05:00,364
但你没有必要有。你知道我的心在哪里。
But you don't have to. You know where my Heart is.

1051
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,600
而我也没有必要，因为你准备告诉我。
And I don't have to, because you're going to tell me.

1052
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:10,574
我认为你足够聪明，会明白我不会告诉你任何东西，就像我们在得克萨斯说的那样。
I think you're smart enough to know that I ain't telling you shit, as we say in Texas.

1053
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,977
你对心灵论的理解有误。
And, you're wrong about mentalism.

1054
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:17,914
人们的面容上镌刻着完整的生平经历。
People wear their entire life story on their face.

1055
01:05:17,948 --> 01:05:20,417
关键在于学会解读其中的信息。
You just have to know how to read it.

1056
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,286
以你为例，你的面容就是这样。
Take yours, for example.

1057
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,922
- 可以吗？ - 乐意之至。
- May I? - With pleasure.

1058
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,993
这会很有趣的。
This is gonna be fun.

1059
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:38,935
嗯，你已经用极度详尽的细节分享了你的父亲问题，但对你妈妈很好奇。
Well, you've already shared, in excruciating detail, your daddy issues, but I'm curious about your mom.

1060
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,440
她为什么自杀？
Why did she commit suicide?

1061
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:50,247
她是否像你一样渴望得到你父亲的关注？
Was she as desperate for your father's attention as you were?

1062
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,351
噢……是的。
Ooh... She was.

1063
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:57,054
为什么会这样呢？
And why was that?

1064
01:05:57,087 --> 01:06:01,258
你父亲的注意力是否给了别人？
Did your father give his attention to someone else?

1065
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:06,330
当你把头发撩到耳后，那是一种暗示。
When you tuck your hair behind your ear, that's a tell.

1066
01:06:07,564 --> 01:06:08,732
他确实如此。
He was.

1067
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:13,570
那么，他是不是和他的秘书有一腿？
So, was he banging his secretary?

1068
01:06:13,603 --> 01:06:16,206
不，那太老套了。
No, that's too cliche.

1069
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:23,813
但那必须是你妈妈亲近的人，她才会......是好朋友吗？还是美发师？
But it had to be someone close to your mom for her to... A good friend? Hairdresser?

1070
01:06:26,183 --> 01:06:28,252
该不会是管家吧？
It wasn't the housekeeper, was it?

1071
01:06:29,386 --> 01:06:32,289
不，不是管家。
No, not the housekeeper.

1072
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,391
我没时间处理这个。
I don't have time for this.

1073
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:37,227
大家通常都会这么问我，当我感到热的时候。
And that's what people usually say when I'm getting hot.

1074
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:40,330
要不我们开空调吧，或者开窗？
Should we crank up the AC, maybe open a window?

1075
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:54,611
如果是我爸爸和保姆出轨，我妈妈发现后自杀了，我大概也不会去剪断保姆车上的刹车线。
Now, if my dad was having sex with my housekeeper and my mom found out and committed suicide, I probably wouldn't cut the brakes on my housekeeper's car.

1076
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:58,715
话说回来，我又不是个疯子。
But then again, I'm not a psychopath.

1077
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:02,986
你真是个可悲又可怜的男人。
You are a sad and pathetic man.

1078
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:05,822
我明白你为什么想结束了。
I can see why you want to end it.

1079
01:07:07,324 --> 01:07:14,064
呃，嘿，呃，维罗妮卡...你知道，转身离开也是暴露内心的表现。
Uh, hey, uh, Veronika... You know, walking away is also a tell.

1080
01:07:40,857 --> 01:07:42,025
哦啦啦。
Ooh-la-la.

1081
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:57,207
先生，先生，先生。
Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur.

1082
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,292
她在哪里？那个女孩在哪里？
Where is she? Where's the girl?

1083
01:08:48,325 --> 01:08:50,126
该死的！
Shit!

1084
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:51,461
她逃走了。
She escaped.

1085
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,208
晚上好。
Bonsoir.

1086
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:14,618
这实在太恶心了，连你都这么觉得。
That's pretty disgusting, even for you.

1087
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:20,123
我可能有点喝多了。
I think I may have overdone it on the wine.

1088
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,658
嗨，鲁拉。
Hi, Lula.

1089
01:09:21,691 --> 01:09:23,460
顺便说一句，你看起来棒极了。
You look great, by the way.

1090
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:28,565
好吧，首先...我没想到会再见到你。
Okay, one... I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

1091
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,999
你怎么找到我们的？
How did you find us?

1092
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,437
有只小鸟告诉我的。
A little birdie told me.

1093
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:35,605
真让我惊讶。
Imagine my surprise.

1094
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,141
你们所有人都背着我聚在一起了。
You guys all got back together without me.

1095
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,477
什么？不，不是那样的。你不明白。
What? No, it's not like that. You don't understand.

1096
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:42,011
不是这样？不是吗？
It wasn't? No?

1097
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:43,347
你自由了。迪克。
You're free. Dick.

1098
01:09:47,284 --> 01:09:49,185
援兵来了。
The cavalry.

1099
01:09:50,954 --> 01:09:52,922
- 想我吗？ - 当然，想死了。
- Miss me? - Oh, a lot.

1100
01:09:52,956 --> 01:09:57,427
哦，你好啊。是我，露拉...露露！露拉！
Oh, hello there. It's me, Lula... Teeth! Lula!

1101
01:09:57,461 --> 01:09:59,128
记得吗？我也曾是四骑士之一。
Remember? I too was once a Horseman.

1102
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:01,531
是的，我问过你的事。我是唯一这么做的。
Yeah, I asked about you. I was the only one.

1103
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,368
哦，原来你是……他是唯一一个问的？真的吗？
Oh, you were the... He was the only one. Really?

1104
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:11,375
天哪。好吧。
Shit. Okay.

1105
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:16,713
我们得赶去碰面地点。好的，计划是这样的。
We have to get to the meet-up. Okay, here's the plan.

1106
01:10:16,746 --> 01:10:18,982
我弄来了逃跑的车，随时可以出发。
I have the getaway car. It's all ready to go.

1107
01:10:19,015 --> 01:10:20,417
现在只需要杰克去接线启动。
I just need Jack to hotwire it.

1108
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,118
等等，你的计划是让我去偷车？
Wait, your plan is for me to steal a car?

1109
01:10:22,151 --> 01:10:23,320
嗯哼！
Uh-huh!

1110
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:25,054
好的，我来接驳汽车线路。你去带六月。
Okay, I'll hotwire the car. You get June.

1111
01:10:25,088 --> 01:10:26,222
没带上她千万别离开，明白吗？
Do not leave without her, all right?

1112
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:27,991
- 到外面跟我们汇合。- 是是是，知道了。
- Meet us outside. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

1113
01:10:28,024 --> 01:10:30,560
哦！呃，小心闪灯！
Oh! Uh, watch for flashing lights!

1114
01:10:30,594 --> 01:10:32,829
好吧。其实我可以搭线启动……
Okay. You know, I can hotwire the...

1115
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:58,755
- 你现在可以放开我了。 - 好的。抱歉。
- You can let go of me now. - Right. Sorry.

1116
01:11:25,715 --> 01:11:27,150
哇！
Whoa!

1117
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:31,655
* 法兰西万岁 *
* Viva la France *

1118
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,557
*我喜欢这里的薯条和吐司*
* I love the fries and the toast *

1119
01:11:42,732 --> 01:11:43,933
来这里。
Come here.

1120
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:45,769
钻石在哪里？
Where is the diamond?

1121
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:48,271
梅里特，谢谢你。
Merritt, thank you.

1122
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:50,239
我罩着你，孩子。
Got your back, kiddo.

1123
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:52,609
可是谁来罩着你呢？
But who's got yours?

1124
01:11:53,777 --> 01:11:54,778
警灯闪烁。
Flashing lights.

1125
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:57,246
快跑！
Run!

1126
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:08,257
看着我的眼睛，看着，并疑惑为何我轻声低语削弱你的意志，然后沉睡。
Look into my eyes, watch and wonder why I whisper words that weaken your will, and sleep.

1127
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:13,563
不是所有人都容易受到影响。
Not everyone's susceptible.

1128
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:21,337
我说："睡吧！"
I said, "Sleep!"

1129
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,483
请放轻松，拜托了。
Easy does it s'il vous plait.

1130
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:37,621
看啊！
Ta-da!

1131
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:52,569
喂？
Hello?

1132
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,138
杰克？
Jack?

1133
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,106
你本可以告诉我们你是坐警车来的。
You could have told us you were coming in a police car.

1134
01:12:57,140 --> 01:12:58,642
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

1135
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:00,510
看，我们让第五骑士重现了。
And, look, we made the Fifth Horseman reappear.

1136
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,045
- 你好，卢拉。 - 嗨。
- Hello, Lula. - Hi.

1137
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:03,312
好。
Okay.

1138
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:06,215
- 你还好吗？ - 嗯。不，我没事。我没事。
- Are you okay? - Yeah. No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

1139
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:09,553
- 但是梅里特被他们抓住了。 - 该死。
- But they have Merritt. - Shit.

1140
01:13:09,586 --> 01:13:11,655
- 是的，我逃出来了，但他没跑掉。 - 嗯，嗯。
- Yeah, I escaped, he couldn't. - Yeah, yeah.

1141
01:13:11,688 --> 01:13:13,557
在场每个人此刻都深感悲恸。
Very emotional time for everybody here.

1142
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,058
显然发生了许多变故。
Clearly a lot going on.

1143
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:18,394
我真心尝试不将任何事视为针对个人。
And I'm really trying not to take any of this personally.

1144
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:22,632
但恳请您告知，是否为"天眼"组织直接与您联络？
But, please, can you tell me, did The Eye contact you directly?

1145
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:23,667
对呀。
Yeah.

1146
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,968
- 你也是吗？- 是的。
- You, too? - Yes.

1147
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,936
- 你怎么没早点打电话给我？- 非常抱歉。
- Why didn't you call me sooner? - I'm so sorry.

1148
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:28,472
- 我得找个保姆。- 快点啊！
- I had to find a babysitter. - Come on!

1149
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:29,806
一切就是这样发生的。
Everything happened like that.

1150
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:31,307
- 等等，抱歉。 - 你们俩认识？
- Wait, sorry. - You two know each other?

1151
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:35,378
- 对。 - 是的，我们认识……你觉得世界上有多少女魔术师？
- Yeah. - Yeah, we know... How many female magicians do you think there are in the world?

1152
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:36,913
此刻我们三个就在这个房间里。
The fact there are three of us in the room right now.

1153
01:13:36,946 --> 01:13:38,214
震惊。太震惊了。
Shocking. Shocking.

1154
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:39,716
- 这简直是颠覆认知。 - 没错。
- It's, like, mind blown. - That's true.

1155
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:41,551
我惊讶于宇宙居然没有自我折叠。
I'm surprised the universe isn't folding in on itself.

1156
01:13:41,585 --> 01:13:43,119
- 正是如此。 - 阿布扎比！
- Exactly. - Abu Dhabi!

1157
01:13:44,287 --> 01:13:46,089
- 他就这样做的？嗯。
- Does he just do that? Mm-hmm.

1158
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:48,424
抱歉，我只是……顺便说一句，我是您的忠实粉丝。
Sorry, I just... I'm a big fan of yours, by the way.

1159
01:13:48,458 --> 01:13:51,160
我正在试图弄清楚维罗妮卡接下来会在哪里。
I was trying to figure out where Veronika was gonna be next.

1160
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:55,665
而且，显然，范登博格国际集团拥有一个赛车运动团队。
And, apparently, Vanderberg Global has a motorsports team.

1161
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:58,935
本周末他们将在阿布扎比推出一款新车。
They're introducing a new car this weekend in Abu Dhabi.

1162
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,070
这样我们就能让梅里特回来并揭穿她。
So we can get Merritt back and expose her.

1163
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,138
没错，没错。
Yeah. Yeah.

1164
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,339
不，不，不。我不会揭穿她的。
No, no, no. I am not exposing her.

1165
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:04,541
我没有要揭发任何人，好吗？
I am not exposing anyone, okay?

1166
01:14:04,574 --> 01:14:06,175
我不在乎天眼想要什么。不行。
I don't care what The Eye wants. No.

1167
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:08,011
我们是为了换回梅里特才做这些，之后我们就两清了。
We are swapping this for Merritt, and then we are done.

1168
01:14:08,044 --> 01:14:09,513
我们是在救朋友，不是在拯救世界。
We're saving our friend, we're not saving the world.

1169
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:10,880
- 然后呢？ - 什么？
- And then what? - What?

1170
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:12,415
我们就这么回归平常生活，放任她离开吗？
We just go back to our lives and let her walk away?

1171
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,952
俄罗斯之后，你说过，"魔术师是娱乐家，- "不是超级英雄。" - 哦，天呐。又来了。
After Russia, you said, "Magicians are entertainers, - "not superheroes." - Oh, my God. Here we go.

1172
01:14:15,985 --> 01:14:17,353
我渐渐觉得你说得对。
And I'm starting to think that you were right.

1173
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,055
她不只是像她父亲那样洗钱。
She doesn't just launder money like her father.

1174
01:14:19,088 --> 01:14:20,857
你们都看到塞迪斯的下场了。
You saw what happened to Thaddeus.

1175
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:23,226
显然，我在这儿是有点在赶进度，对吧？
Obviously, I'm playing a bit of catch-up here, right?

1176
01:14:23,259 --> 01:14:28,698
我不是所有情况都了解，但这并不妨碍我对我们接下来该做什么发表看法。
I don't have all of the information, but I don't think that that should stop me from having an opinion about what we do next.

1177
01:14:28,732 --> 01:14:29,866
- 当然应该这样做。- 没错。
- Of course it should. - Exactly.

1178
01:14:29,899 --> 01:14:30,967
不，不应该这样做，阿特拉斯。
No, it shouldn't, Atlas.

1179
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,036
而且我认为我们应该曝光瓦内萨。
And I think we should expose Vanessa.

1180
01:14:33,069 --> 01:14:34,103
- 维罗妮卡。- 维罗妮卡。
- Veronika. - Veronika.

1181
01:14:34,137 --> 01:14:36,405
因为谋杀和…… - 另一项罪名是什么？ - 洗钱。
For murder and... - What is the other thing? - Money laundering.

1182
01:14:36,439 --> 01:14:37,473
还有洗钱。
And for money laundering.

1183
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,142
因为谋杀和洗钱。
For murder and for money laundering.

1184
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:42,612
- 是的，是的。 - 我们应该把她绑起来……不，不！这太危险了！
- Yeah. Yeah. - We should tie her up... No, no! It is too dangerous!

1185
01:14:42,646 --> 01:14:43,913
- 阿特拉斯说得对。- 什么？
- And Atlas is right. - What?

1186
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:44,981
我们已经受够了自我牺牲。
We are done sacrificing ourselves.

1187
01:14:45,014 --> 01:14:46,149
- 是的。- 对不起，这根本不值得。
- Yeah. - I'm sorry. It's not worth it.

1188
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:47,617
简直是胡说八道！
That's bullshit!

1189
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,052
- 什么？- 你错了。
- What? - You're wrong.

1190
01:14:49,085 --> 01:14:51,054
- 我吗？- 抱歉。
- Am I? - Sorry.

1191
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:53,022
不，不用道歉。说出来。
No. Don't be sorry. Say it.

1192
01:14:54,223 --> 01:15:02,231
你是错的。只是... 在我发现四骑士之前，我对什么都不在乎。
You are. You're wrong. It's just... Before I discovered the Horsemen, I didn't give a shit about anything.

1193
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:04,300
我……我的家人抛弃了我。
I... My family gave me up.

1194
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:06,469
我曾憎恨整个世界。
I hated the whole world.

1195
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:18,281
然后，我看到了你们的一段视频，你们正努力让世界变得更少腐败、不再那么糟糕。
And then, I saw a video of you guys, and you were trying to make the world less corrupt, less terrible.

1196
01:15:19,683 --> 01:15:23,620
这让我重燃了在乎的心。
And that made me give a shit.

1197
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,028
那么诀窍是什么？
So what's the trick?

1198
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,500
我保证这招管用。
I promise this is gonna work.

1199
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,135
但这足够误导对方吗？
But is that enough misdirection?

1200
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:42,338
只要她在这里，不在那里就行。
As long as she's here and not there.

1201
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:43,673
我们能处理好的。
We can take care of that.

1202
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:47,777
就算你迟到五分钟... -五分钟？我会说是一分钟。 -迟到一分钟。
If you're even just five minutes late... - Five? I'd say one. - One minute late.

1203
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:49,846
我们怎么知道会有足够多的人来参加？
How do we know enough people are gonna show up?

1204
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,547
各位，它已经在网上病毒式传播了。
You guys, it's already viral.

1205
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:53,482
我保证现场会有一大堆人。
I guarantee there'll be a crowd.

1206
01:15:53,516 --> 01:15:54,718
这太疯狂了。变数太多了。
This is nuts. There's too many variables.

1207
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,954
嘿，我们会一直跟你保持联系——要是出了什么差错……——嘿，嘿，嘿。
Hey, we'll be in constant contact with you - if something goes awry... - Hey, hey, hey.

1208
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:00,857
这里根本没有犯错的空间，老兄。明白吗？完全没有。
There's, like, no margin for error here, man. Okay? Zero.

1209
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:07,831
我们要想在这短得离谱的时间内完成这项牵涉环节众多的冒险任务，就必须做到万无一失。
We're going to have to be absolutely flawless if we're gonna pull something this risky off with this many moving parts in this ridiculously short amount of time, okay?

1210
01:16:07,864 --> 01:16:09,032
- 没错。- 是的。
- Yes. - Yeah.

1211
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:13,703
至少就我而言，我觉得我们七个成功的几率比大多数人都要高。
But speaking for myself, at least, I think the seven of us have a better chance than most.

1212
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:15,238
哦。
Oh.

1213
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,040
你看看这个？
Would you look at this?

1214
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,575
伟大的博斯科·勒罗伊何时变得心软了？
When did the great Bosco Leroy go soft?

1215
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:23,012
好吧，伙计们，我们干还是不干？
Okay, guys, are we doing this or what?

1216
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,115
这是一次千万分之一的机会。
It is a ten million to one shot.

1217
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:28,351
这些是我的风格赌局。
Those are my kind of odds.

1218
01:16:39,195 --> 01:16:42,699
女士们先生们，时刻终于来临。
Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come.

1219
01:16:42,732 --> 01:16:44,734
今晚，仅此一夜。
Tonight, for one night only.

1220
01:16:46,069 --> 01:16:49,172
- 靠近些 - 再近点
- Come in close. - Closer.

1221
01:16:49,205 --> 01:16:53,677
因为你看得越清楚... 就越容易被蒙蔽。
'Cause the more you think you see... The easier it will be to fool you.

1222
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:55,178
倒计时开始。
The countdown begins.

1223
01:16:55,211 --> 01:17:01,450
仅剩两个小时，四骑士将时隔十年再次同台演出。
In only two hours, the Four Horsemen will be on stage together for the first time in ten years.

1224
01:17:02,418 --> 01:17:04,220
J·丹尼尔·阿特拉斯。
J. Daniel Atlas.

1225
01:17:09,425 --> 01:17:10,660
亨利·里夫斯。
Henley Reeves.

1226
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,566
杰克·怀尔德。
Jack Wilder.

1227
01:17:22,772 --> 01:17:24,407
还有卢拉·梅。
And Lula May.

1228
01:17:28,444 --> 01:17:31,948
女士们先生们，"天启四骑士"。
Ladies and gentlemen, the Four Horsemen.

1229
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,418
没错，骑士们今夜再度出击。
That's right, the Horsemen are back for one night only.

1230
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:43,960
上周，我们偷走了心形钻石，而在今晚的两个小时内，我们将把它物归原主，归还给你们所有人。
Now, last week, we stole the Heart Diamond, and tonight, in two hours' time, we're going to return it to its rightful owner, all of you.

1231
01:17:46,763 --> 01:17:48,231
你觉得这能引起她的注意吗？
Do you think that got her attention?

1232
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:49,598
如果这都不行，我真不知道什么能行了。
If that didn't, I don't know what will.

1233
01:17:49,632 --> 01:17:54,503
好了听我说，既然你都知道事情能糟糕到什么地步了，能不能就这一次求个稳妥？
All right, listen, now that you know how bad things can actually get, can you please just try playing it safe this one time?

1234
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,173
-不行。-好吧。
- No. - Okay.

1235
01:17:57,206 --> 01:17:59,008
噢。
Oh.

1236
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:00,643
她来了。刚刚好赶上。
Here she is. Right on time.

1237
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,011
你觉得表演怎么样？
You enjoying the show?

1238
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:04,513
嗯，对我来说有点俗气。
Eh, it's a little tacky for my taste.

1239
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:08,852
我猜你是根据离我住处近这一点选择了场地。
I assume you chose your venue for its proximity to my own.

1240
01:18:08,885 --> 01:18:10,286
好吧，对你来说好消息。
Well, good news for you.

1241
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,289
已为您登记在嘉宾名单上。
I've placed you on our guest list.

1242
01:18:13,322 --> 01:18:16,760
把我的心带来，我们来做个交换。
Bring me my Heart. We'll make an exchange.

1243
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:18,795
麦金尼先生为钻石而来。
Mr. McKinney for the diamond.

1244
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:24,500
嗯哼。- 在外面，在灯光下，却不见丝毫魔法的痕迹。
Mm-hmm. - Outside, under the lights, and not the first hint of magic.

1245
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:31,875
一只兔子从帽子里钻出，一张牌从袖子里滑落，而你的朋友就这么消失无踪。
One rabbit comes out of a hat, one ace slides out of a sleeve, and your friend goes poof.

1246
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,378
我只是想用你能理解的话来说。
Just trying to use parlance you'd understand.

1247
01:18:38,314 --> 01:18:40,516
* 咒语念起，爱情魔咒降临 *
* Abracadabra, amor-oo-na-na *

1248
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,520
* 咒语念起，死亡魔咒降临 *
* Abracadabra Morta-oo-ga-ga *

1249
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:48,124
* 咒语念起，阿布-唔-呐-呐 *
* Abracadabra, abra-oo-na-na *

1250
01:18:48,157 --> 01:18:50,493
* 她用她的语言说道 *
* In her tongue she said *

1251
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:54,330
* "今夜，生死或爱恋" *
* "Death or love tonight" *

1252
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:57,566
* 咒语念起，阿布卡达布拉 *
* Abracadabra, abracadabra *

1253
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,171
* 阿布拉卡达布拉 阿布拉卡达布拉... *
* Abracadabra Abracadabra... *

1254
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,408
欢迎来到亚斯岛。
Welcome to the W Yas Island.

1255
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:07,210
中东地区的奥兰多。
The Orlando of the Middle East.

1256
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:08,377
哈。
Ha.

1257
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:17,753
现在，最后，感谢亚斯岛主办了一场无愧于赛车运动中最快团队的活动。
Now, finally, thank you to Yas Island for hosting an event worthy of the fastest team in motorsport.

1258
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:28,064
这条赛道是精英之选，但很快，它就会让我们的对手见识到赛场上最常见的景象——我们赛车的尾翼。
This track is elite, but it will soon provide our competitors with the most common view in racing, the rear wings of our cars.

1259
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,034
谢谢大家。
Thank you.

1260
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:33,769
我的天。那是韦罗妮卡？
Holy shit. That's Veronika?

1261
01:19:34,938 --> 01:19:37,573
她气质非凡，气场强大。
She has a very commanding presence.

1262
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,209
我们那些魔法朋友们到了。
Our magical friends have arrived.

1263
01:19:40,243 --> 01:19:41,744
你为什么不去迎接他们呢？
Why don't you go and greet them?

1264
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:44,413
非常感谢你们的到来。希望你们能享受这场比赛。
Thank you so much for coming. I hope you enjoy the race.

1265
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:46,582
好的，阿特拉斯说要制造些混乱。
Okay, Atlas said to create a distraction.

1266
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,184
我们要怎么实现这个计划？
How are we gonna pull this off?

1267
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:49,853
到处都是安保人员。
There is security everywhere.

1268
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,721
好了，伙计们，冷静点。我来处理。
Okay, you guys, calm down. I got this.

1269
01:19:53,656 --> 01:19:55,124
你好。嗨。
Hello. Hi.

1270
01:19:55,158 --> 01:19:57,293
呃，大卫。好的。我是媒体关系部门的。
Uh, David. Cool. I'm from media relations.

1271
01:19:57,326 --> 01:19:58,895
我只是来看看情况。
I was just checking in.

1272
01:19:58,928 --> 01:20:01,564
你们能不能把摄像机换个位置？
Do you think you guys could do a different camera placement?

1273
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:02,966
好的，谢谢。继续。
Okay, thanks. Continue.

1274
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,267
那是谁？
Who is that?

1275
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:05,601
轮到你了。
Your turn.

1276
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:07,770
开始吧。
Let's do this.

1277
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:11,908
请务必确认这颗钻石的真伪。
Make sure you confirm the authenticity of the diamond.

1278
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:14,010
这些人非常狡猾。
These people are very tricky.

1279
01:20:15,278 --> 01:20:16,812
我很高兴你来了。
I'm so glad you came.

1280
01:20:16,846 --> 01:20:18,814
我们冰释前嫌如何？
What do you say we bury the hatchet?

1281
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:20,950
- 彼此脖颈相依？- 哈！他挺幽默的。
- In each other's necks? - Ha! He's funny.

1282
01:20:20,984 --> 01:20:24,320
我们各自拥有对对方有益之物。
We each possess something beneficial to the other.

1283
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:25,989
这是开展合作的绝佳理由。
Perfect reason to do business.

1284
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:27,456
不过，有个条件需要说明。
Only, there's one caveat.

1285
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,759
我热切希望我们之间的交往到此为止。
I fervently hope our mutual dealings are at a close.

1286
01:20:30,793 --> 01:20:32,461
- 她真镇定自若。- 现在不是时候。
- She's so poised. - Not now.

1287
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:34,197
- 我讨厌她...呃。- 露拉，嘘。
- I hate her... Ugh. - Lula. Shh.

1288
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:37,000
- 进展如何？- 兄弟，需要帮忙吗？
- How's it going? - Bro, can I help you?

1289
01:20:37,033 --> 01:20:38,634
没错，我们是来拍这辆车的。
Yeah, we're here to shoot the car.

1290
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,937
- 身份证明？- 哦，对，当然带了。
- ID? - Oh, right. Of course.

1291
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,471
显而易见。给你。
Obviously. There you are.

1292
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:46,142
- 那你呢？- 呃，对，应该在我外套口袋里。
- And you? - Uh, yeah, it's in my jacket somewhere.

1293
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,079
就在那里。
There it is.

1294
01:20:50,113 --> 01:20:51,347
我们是纪录片系列《方格旗》的摄制组。
We're with Checkered Flags, the doc series.

1295
01:20:51,380 --> 01:20:52,781
下个赛季将聚焦范德堡赛车运动。
Next season's on Vanderberg Motorsports.

1296
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:54,417
他们真的一点消息都没透露给你们吗？
They seriously didn't give you guys a heads-up?

1297
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,085
典型的。
Typical.

1298
01:20:56,119 --> 01:21:01,024
我们只需要拍一些插播镜头，可能再加一些备用素材，还有一些派对人士对这款美车垂涎的画面。
We're just gonna get some inserts, maybe some B-roll and some party people gawking at this beauty.

1299
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:02,992
- 好的，等你准备好... - 嘿，别碰那辆车。
- All right, whenever you're... - Oi, don't touch the car.

1300
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:04,627
- 我们需要拍摄内饰部分。 - 没问题。
- We got to shoot the interior. - Yeah.

1301
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:06,295
我其实可以帮你在这部作品里争取一个客串角色。
I can actually get you a cameo in this thing.

1302
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:09,465
- 省省吧。我接到了命令。
- 是的，我们也是。
- Save it. I've got my orders. - Yeah, and so do we.

1303
01:21:10,499 --> 01:21:11,968
晚上好，范登伯格女士。
Good evening, Ms. Vanderberg.

1304
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:17,040
是的。我们正在努力获取您要求的视频片段，但遇到了一点小麻烦。
Yeah. We're trying to get that footage you asked for, but we ran into a little bit of a problem.

1305
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:19,142
- 你会有麻烦的。- 她想和你谈谈。
- You're gonna be in trouble. - She wants to talk to you.

1306
01:21:19,175 --> 01:21:22,211
这可不太妙，老兄。嗯嗯，确实不妙。
That's not good, my guy. Mm-mm. Not good.

1307
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:23,779
你好。
Hello.

1308
01:21:23,812 --> 01:21:28,817
听着，我父亲常说，没人会不看实物就买钻石。
Listen, my father always said no one buys a diamond sight unseen.

1309
01:21:28,851 --> 01:21:32,188
此刻，我的车就是那颗钻石。
And at this very moment, my car is the diamond.

1310
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:36,692
所以，你可以让他们做他们的工作，或者给自己找个新的。
So, you can either let them do their job, or you can find yourself a new one.

1311
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:38,861
女士，抱歉耽误了。
Sorry for the hold-up, ma'am.

1312
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:43,699
- 没事。 - 你是最棒的。
- You're good. - You're the best.

1313
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:45,801
你能不能帮我往后退一点？
If you could just back up for me really quick?

1314
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,570
只是调整一下光线。谢了，兄弟。
Just for the light. Thanks, man.

1315
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:52,208
那么，我们可以开始了吗？
Well, shall we get on with it?

1316
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:53,276
请吧。
Please.

1317
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,280
哦。你当然带了个打手。原谅我。
Oh. Of course, you have a goon. Forgive me.

1318
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:01,084
啊，拜托，你还不信任我们吗？
Ah, come on, you don't trust us?

1319
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:02,918
我们经历了这么多？
After all we've been through?

1320
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,992
有什么问题吗？
Is there a problem?

1321
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:10,193
不确定时请仔细核对。
Double check if you're not certain.

1322
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,195
- 这是心脏。- 是的，当然是心脏。
- It's the Heart. - Yes, of course it is.

1323
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:14,063
现在，请你帮我们把朋友带过来好吗？
Now, please, can you get our friend?

1324
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:17,033
拜托了。
Come on.

1325
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:23,606
他在那儿。好的。
There he is. Okay.

1326
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:25,341
- 啊！ - 嘿。
- Ah! - Hey.

1327
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:27,676
- 呼。 - 你还好吗？
- Whew. - You okay?

1328
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,878
好吧，既然我知道自己值五亿美元了。
Well, now that I know I'm worth half a billion dollars.

1329
01:22:29,912 --> 01:22:31,580
我还是觉得我们被坑了，不过见到你真好。
I still think we got ripped off, but it's good to see you.

1330
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:33,416
签名，盖章，已送达。
Signed, sealed, delivered.

1331
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,718
瞧，我是个言出必行的女人。
See, I'm a woman of my word.

1332
01:22:35,751 --> 01:22:37,886
想留下就留下吧，好好享受派对。
Stick around if you want, enjoy the party.

1333
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,288
嘿！嘿！
Hey! Hey!

1334
01:22:39,322 --> 01:22:41,424
老天爷啊，这到底是怎么回事？
What in God's name?

1335
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:47,363
- 该死！- 闪开！
- Shit! - Step aside!

1336
01:22:47,396 --> 01:22:48,931
快点，这东西怎么启动啊？
Come on, how do you make this thing go?

1337
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:52,368
你一嚷嚷，我就没法集中注意力！
I can't concentrate with you yelling at me!

1338
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:54,037
别让他跑了！
Don't let him get away!

1339
01:22:55,771 --> 01:22:57,406
对不起！
Excuse me!

1340
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:00,643
快报警！
Call the police!

1341
01:23:00,676 --> 01:23:02,245
你看着好戏呢？
You enjoying the show?

1342
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:04,780
你就打算站在那里傻看，还是去把我的车开回来？
You just gonna stand there gawking or get my car back?

1343
01:23:07,216 --> 01:23:08,317
这都是你干的好事。
You did this.

1344
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:14,423
好了，我们上吧。
Okay, here we go.

1345
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:18,461
好吧，阿特拉斯，你想要分散注意力，现在你如愿以偿了。
Okay, Atlas, you wanted a distraction, you got a distraction.

1346
01:23:21,630 --> 01:23:23,266
哥们儿，这车太容易甩尾了。
Man, this thing is tail happy.

1347
01:23:29,938 --> 01:23:31,840
哇靠，什么情况？
Oh, man, what the hell?

1348
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,843
我们掉进陷阱门之类的东西里了。
We fell through a trapdoor or something.

1349
01:23:34,877 --> 01:23:36,079
大家都还好吗？
Is everybody okay?

1350
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:37,546
- 我们在哪？ - 不行。
- Where are we? - No.

1351
01:23:39,382 --> 01:23:43,686
今天早上醒来时，我最想要的除了我的钻石外就只有一件事。
When I woke up this morning, there was only one thing I wanted more than my diamond.

1352
01:23:43,719 --> 01:23:46,122
我麾下的骑士被严密看管。
My Horsemen under lock and key.

1353
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:51,694
而现在两者皆得，我得承认，我都有点飘飘然了。
And now that I have both, I must admit, I'm feeling a little bit spoiled.

1354
01:23:51,727 --> 01:23:56,132
当你在准备你的小表演时，我也策划了自己的戏法。
While you were prepping your little performance, I curated a trick of my own.

1355
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:58,967
五位骑士受困，无处可逃。
Five Horsemen trapped, no escape.

1356
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:03,306
你们五个或许是国宝，但我们这里也有国宝。
You five may be national treasures, but we have those here, too.

1357
01:24:03,339 --> 01:24:07,810
只不过它们很难被发现，因为它们深埋在沙中。
Only they're hard to find, because they're buried in sand.

1358
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:15,984
世人会认为你是在一场失败的逃生表演中丧生的。
To the world, it will appear you died in a failed escape act.

1359
01:24:16,018 --> 01:24:19,588
现在，来见证一些魔术吧。
Now, let's see some magic.

1360
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:24,160
去他的魔术！快呼叫增援！
Fuck magic! Somebody call for backup!

1361
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,329
- 杰克，给琼打电话。 - 谁有信号吗？
- Jack, call June. - Anyone have service?

1362
01:24:26,362 --> 01:24:28,063
天哪，她肯定干扰了手机信号。
God, she must have scrambled the cell signal.

1363
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:29,365
她把所有情况都考虑到了！
She thought of everything!

1364
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,066
露拉，你到底站在哪一边？
Lula, whose side are you on?

1365
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,369
我当然站在我们这边，但她也确实考虑到了所有情况。
I'm on our side, obviously, but she also thought of everything.

1366
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:34,870
两件事情可以同时成立。
Both things can be true at one time.

1367
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,905
沙子在增高，沙子在扩大。
The sand is getting higher. The sand is getting bigger.

1368
01:24:36,939 --> 01:24:38,474
沙子越来越多，体积也越来越大。
There's more sand and it's getting larger.

1369
01:24:38,507 --> 01:24:40,476
亨莉，亨莉，呃，逃跑的首要原则是。
Henley, Henley, uh, first principle of escape.

1370
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:42,678
那个，大概能撑多久？嗯。
Uh, how long is it survivable? Right.

1371
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:47,316
好，好极了。按照水流的速度和盒子的容量来看... - 嗯，是啊，咱们要完蛋了。 - 啊，妙啊。
Right. Great. Judging from the rate of the flow, the volume of the box... - Uh, yeah, we're screwed. - Oh, amazing.

1372
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:49,485
好吧，那逃跑的第二条原则是什么？
Okay, how about the second principle of escape then?

1373
01:24:49,518 --> 01:24:50,986
好，那指的是盒子本身。
Okay, so that's the box itself.

1374
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:52,221
有什么瑕疵吗？有什么缺陷吗？
Is there a flaw? Is there a weakness?

1375
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,322
有没有后门？
Is there a back door?

1376
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:55,158
每个人只需检查一下！
Everybody just needs to check!

1377
01:24:55,191 --> 01:24:56,359
这一面已经密封了。
This side's sealed.

1378
01:24:56,392 --> 01:24:58,327
该死。不，它是密封的，密封的，密封的。
Shit. No, it's sealed, sealed, sealed.

1379
01:25:00,363 --> 01:25:02,131
一切都密封着。
Everything's sealed.

1380
01:25:06,469 --> 01:25:08,237
有没有可能存在第三条原则？
Any chance there's a third principle?

1381
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:17,213
你要找的东西在我这儿。
I have what you're after.

1382
01:25:17,246 --> 01:25:18,447
完美。
Perfect.

1383
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:20,383
我会在内心所在之处与你会面。
I will meet you where the Heart resides.

1384
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:23,085
我迫不及待。
I can hardly wait.

1385
01:25:28,257 --> 01:25:29,625
直接前往宝库。
Straight to the vault.

1386
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:34,563
不，不，不，不！好极了！
No, no, no, no! Yes!

1387
01:25:36,332 --> 01:25:38,767
救救我，瑞奇·博比！救救我！
Help me, Ricky Bobby! Help me!

1388
01:25:43,272 --> 01:25:44,640
真的要在此刻发生吗？
Is this really gonna happen right now?

1389
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:47,243
我们就这样死在这个盒子里了？真的吗？
We're just gonna die here in this box? Really?

1390
01:25:47,276 --> 01:25:55,284
真有趣。一周前，我还想寻死，然后…然后我找回了活下去的理由，可现在，我们却真的要死了。
It's funny. A week ago, I wanted to die, and then... then I get my reason to live back, and now, we're actually gonna die.

1391
01:25:55,318 --> 01:25:57,453
这有什么好笑的？
How is that funny?

1392
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,488
唉，我是说，在我脑子里听上去更好笑。
Well, I mean, it was funnier in my head.

1393
01:25:59,522 --> 01:26:00,789
这…你知道，这是种奇怪的幽默感。
It's... You know, it's peculiar funny.

1394
01:26:00,823 --> 01:26:02,658
不。嗯哼。不行。
No. Uh-uh. No.

1395
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,227
我们已经没有选择了。
We're out of options.

1396
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:09,198
天哪，我不该对你的网站、你的服装还有那个标志那么刻薄的。
God, I never should have been that horrible about your website and your costumes and the logo.

1397
01:26:09,232 --> 01:26:12,901
- 好吧。- “怀尔德”里的字母“I”是个小魔法棒这一点，其实并不尴尬。
- Okay. - It's not embarrassing that the "I" in "Wilder" is a little magic wand.

1398
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:14,102
- 我懂了。那... - 其实不是。
- I got it. That's... - It's not.

1399
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:15,838
- 谢谢你。- 它又可爱又迷人。
- Thank you. - It's cute and it's charming.

1400
01:26:15,871 --> 01:26:18,241
- 这就够了。- 而且我...我想念你。
- That's enough. - And I... I missed you.

1401
01:26:18,274 --> 01:26:22,578
听着，我知道我并不总是表露出来，但是，呃……我真的把你们都看得很重要。
Listen, I know I don't always show it, but, um... I really do think the world of all of you.

1402
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,350
我简直不敢相信我们会被活埋。
I cannot believe we're getting buried alive.

1403
01:26:27,383 --> 01:26:29,818
- 我是说，这简直就像西部片里的情节。- 等等，等等。被活埋。
- I mean, it's like a Western. - Wait, wait. Buried alive.

1404
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,354
这可是那种古老的魔术传统。
That's, like, an old magic tradition.

1405
01:26:31,387 --> 01:26:33,188
对不起，我们知道是谁干的吗？
Sorry, who do we know who did that?

1406
01:26:33,222 --> 01:26:35,958
比尔·舍克差点因此丧命，记得吗？
Bill Shirk nearly died doing that. Remember?

1407
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:38,861
他躺进一口有机玻璃棺材，然后被人用沙子盖住。
He got into a Plexiglas coffin and had it covered in sand.

1408
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:41,497
但有机玻璃不是碎了吗？
But didn't the Plexiglas break?

1409
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:43,299
- 沙子湿了。- 沙子湿了。
- The sand got wet. - The sand got wet.

1410
01:26:43,332 --> 01:26:45,701
我想起来了，前一天晚上下过雨。
I remember now. It rained the night before.

1411
01:26:45,734 --> 01:26:47,970
对，湿沙子比干沙子重，所以压碎了玻璃箱。
Okay, wet sand is heavier than dry. It broke the glass.

1412
01:26:48,003 --> 01:26:54,176
等等，等等，等等。如果我们弄坏了那根水管，水就会浸湿沙子，然后……它就会压坏玻璃箱，对吗？
Wait, wait, wait, wait. If we broke that pipe, then it would wet the sand, and then it'll... it'll break the box, right?

1413
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,480
如果我能……如果我能用什么东西缠住它，或许就能借力扳动了。
If I could... If I could wrap something around it, I might be able to get some leverage.

1414
01:26:57,513 --> 01:26:58,647
好的。
Okay.

1415
01:26:58,681 --> 01:27:00,215
梅里特，把你的皮带给我。
Merritt, give me your belt.

1416
01:27:00,249 --> 01:27:02,150
- 好。 - 好的，成功了。你成功了。
- Okay. - Okay, you got it. You got it.

1417
01:27:02,184 --> 01:27:03,386
- 是的，好的，好了。 - 快。
- Yep, okay, okay. - Come on.

1418
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:04,787
- 好，好，好。 - 你行的。
- Good, good, good. - You got this.

1419
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,989
- 你行的。 - 加油。加油。
- You got this. - Come on. Come on.

1420
01:27:07,022 --> 01:27:09,392
- 好！好！ - 好！
- Yes! Yes! - Yes!

1421
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,128
帮帮我！帮帮我！把我拉下来！
Help me! Help me! Pull me down!

1422
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:15,498
- 好吧，好吧。是的，是的，是的。- 它是由金属构成的。
- Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's made up of metal.

1423
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:23,672
很好，很好，很好，好的。
Nice, nice, nice, okay.

1424
01:27:26,174 --> 01:27:28,811
- 靠边停车。- 你已被包围了。
- Pull over. - You have been surrounded.

1425
01:27:28,844 --> 01:27:32,381
我很想靠边停车，但我终于找到诀窍了。
I'd love to pull over, but I'm finally getting the hang of this.

1426
01:27:36,619 --> 01:27:38,754
我是世界上最棒的司机！
I'm the greatest driver in the world!

1427
01:27:52,301 --> 01:27:53,569
不不不不。
No, no, no, no.

1428
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,072
当心！
Watch out!

1429
01:27:58,974 --> 01:28:00,576
该死！
Damn it!

1430
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,244
关闭发动机并离开车辆。
Turn off the engine and exit the vehicle.

1431
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,146
你已经被我们包围了。
We've got you surrounded.

1432
01:28:04,179 --> 01:28:05,748
举起手来，不许动！
Put your hands up and don't move!

1433
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:08,417
抱歉。我是不是忘了打转向灯？
I'm sorry. Did I forget to use my blinker?

1434
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:09,652
你被捕了。
You're under arrest.

1435
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:14,089
谢谢诸位。干得漂亮。
Thank you, gentlemen. Excellent work.

1436
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,925
我们已对一位名叫博斯科·勒罗伊的人发布红色通缉令。
We've had a red notice for one Bosco Leroy.

1437
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:18,594
- 谢谢。- 不客气。
- Thank you. - No problem.

1438
01:28:19,662 --> 01:28:21,497
没错，阿特拉斯非宰了我不可。
Yep, Atlas is gonna kill me.

1439
01:28:23,165 --> 01:28:25,934
- 水涌得太快了。- 玻璃也打不破。
- Water's coming in too fast. - And the glass won't break.

1440
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:28,937
- 就为了一颗钻石搞成这样。- 现在正好能用上。
- All this for a diamond. - We could use that now.

1441
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,606
没有什么比钻石更能切割玻璃了。
Nothing cuts glass like a diamond.

1442
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:33,876
等等，哇，哇。等等，亨莉。亨莉。
Wait, whoa, whoa. Wait, Henley. Henley.

1443
01:28:33,909 --> 01:28:36,912
没错！我能在水下屏息八分钟之久。
Yes! I can hold my breath for eight minutes.

1444
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:39,114
要说谁能带我们脱身，非我们莫属。
If anyone can get us out of this, we can.

1445
01:29:01,404 --> 01:29:03,238
长官，我们正在穿越沙漠区。
We're crossing into the desert, ma'am.

1446
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:04,940
沙尘暴正愈演愈烈。
The dust storm is getting worse.

1447
01:29:12,781 --> 01:29:14,282
他来这里做什么？
What's he doing here?

1448
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:17,653
你和你的朋友们偷走的范登伯格女士的钻石？
Ms. Vanderberg's diamond that you and your friends stole?

1449
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,005
丢了什么东西吗？
Lost something?

1450
01:29:54,923 --> 01:29:56,158
刚才真好玩。
That was fun.

1451
01:30:03,666 --> 01:30:05,701
- 起作用了！- 起作用了。
- It's working! - It's working.

1452
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:06,869
大家快来帮忙！
Everybody help!

1453
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,904
- 大家快来帮忙！- 我们一起上！加油！
- Everybody help! - Let's do it! Come on!

1454
01:30:29,324 --> 01:30:30,593
加油。
Come on.

1455
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,101
亨莉，干得好！
Henley, way to go!

1456
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,603
- 天啊！- 真棒！
- Oh, my God! - Nice job!

1457
01:30:40,636 --> 01:30:42,738
好了，我们得赶去看演出。
All right, we got a show to catch.

1458
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,372
希望我们不会太晚。
I hope we're not too late.

1459
01:30:44,406 --> 01:30:45,808
- 你没事吧？- 没事。
- You all right? - Yeah.

1460
01:31:02,224 --> 01:31:03,325
身份已验证。
Identity verified.

1461
01:31:24,246 --> 01:31:25,480
你成功了。
You made it.

1462
01:31:26,915 --> 01:31:28,283
我要的东西带来了吗？
Do you have what I want?

1463
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:31,319
如果你有我想要的。
If you have what I want.

1464
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:36,091
证据在哪？
Where's the evidence?

1465
01:31:43,498 --> 01:31:44,633
就在这里。
Right here.

1466
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:47,269
我就是证据。
I'm the evidence.

1467
01:31:47,302 --> 01:31:49,304
没有。
No.

1468
01:31:50,673 --> 01:31:56,044
查理，我...我不...你明明已经死了。
Charlie, I... I don't... You're dead.

1469
01:31:58,046 --> 01:31:59,214
现在你看见我了。
Now you see me.

1470
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:13,395
人们为了让某样东西或某个人...消失而做的事情，实在令人着迷。
It's quite fascinating the things people do to make something or someone... disappear.

1471
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:19,401
啊。
Ah.

1472
01:32:27,142 --> 01:32:28,711
这招是我教你的。
I taught you that trick.

1473
01:32:28,744 --> 01:32:31,346
就像父亲教我们的那样。
Just like our father taught you.

1474
01:32:32,514 --> 01:32:35,818
而现在，十五年后，你……你想毁了我？
And now, after 15 years, you're... you're trying to ruin me?

1475
01:32:35,851 --> 01:32:36,885
不用。
No.

1476
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,922
整整十五年。
All 15 years.

1477
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:43,325
我不知道你会在那辆车里。
I didn't know you'd be in that car.

1478
01:32:43,358 --> 01:32:46,729
但你听说我在那里时，想必松了一口气。
But you must have been relieved to hear I was.

1479
01:32:47,763 --> 01:32:52,668
坠水之后，我解不开安全带。
When we hit the water, I couldn't unbuckle my seat belt.

1480
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:55,704
妈妈用尽最后一丝力气救了我。
Mom freed me with her dying breath.

1481
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:59,074
查利，我心中对你只有爱意。
I had nothing but fondness for you, Charlie.

1482
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,979
让我终于能像对待兄弟一般对待你。
Let me finally treat you like a brother.

1483
01:33:04,012 --> 01:33:05,347
我是你哥哥！
I am your brother!

1484
01:33:08,550 --> 01:33:15,123
父亲的血液流淌在我们两人身上，虽然他从不承认我身上也流着他的血。
Father's blood is in both of us, though he'd never acknowledge mine.

1485
01:33:15,891 --> 01:33:17,259
天知道母亲曾经苦苦哀求。
God knows Mother begged.

1486
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:19,695
而这份耻辱将我母亲逼入了坟墓。
And the shame drove my mother to her grave.

1487
01:33:19,728 --> 01:33:22,197
然后你把我那条发给她的了！
Then you sent mine to hers!

1488
01:33:24,733 --> 01:33:26,034
好吧。
Fine.

1489
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:27,435
你说得对。
You're right.

1490
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,040
那应该是你的。
It should be yours.

1491
01:33:33,575 --> 01:33:34,743
就在这儿。
Here.

1492
01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:38,080
拿去吧。
Take it.

1493
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,809
子弹戏法。
Bullet catch.

1494
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:11,113
- 这不可能。
- 不，只是魔术而已。
- That's impossible. - No. Just magic.

1495
01:34:14,316 --> 01:34:15,517
呃。
Ah.

1496
01:34:16,018 --> 01:34:17,119
嗯。
Hmm.

1497
01:34:26,194 --> 01:34:28,330
大家好。
Hello, everyone.

1498
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:29,531
谢谢。
Thank you.

1499
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,801
好的，谢谢。
All right, thank you.

1500
01:34:32,835 --> 01:34:37,873
今晚早些时候，J·丹尼尔·阿特拉斯承诺会将“心灵钻石”归还给其合法所有者。
Earlier tonight, J. Daniel Atlas promised to return the Heart Diamond to its rightful owner.

1501
01:34:39,607 --> 01:34:43,278
但在我们开始之前，先做一些介绍。
But before we do that, some introductions are in order.

1502
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:50,886
首先，让我们向这位自然界的凶猛之力、非凡的琼·鲁克莱尔问好！
First, let's say hello to the fierce force of nature, the extraordinary June Rouclere!

1503
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,023
对，六月！
Yeah, June!

1504
01:34:55,057 --> 01:34:57,425
哇。大家好，谢谢各位。
Wow. Hello, everyone. Thank you.

1505
01:34:58,693 --> 01:35:00,929
非常感谢你们，谢谢。
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1506
01:35:00,963 --> 01:35:06,802
也让我们为不屈不挠的波斯寇·勒鲁瓦欢呼！
And give it up for the indomitable Bosco Leroy!

1507
01:35:07,903 --> 01:35:10,005
这是我们的荣幸。
The pleasure is ours.

1508
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,140
你好，美女。
Hello, gorgeous.

1509
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:23,485
当然，我们首先要感谢世界上最伟大的魔术师们，没有他们的帮助，这一切都无法实现。
And, of course, we could not have done any of this in the first place without the help of the world's greatest magicians.

1510
01:35:23,518 --> 01:35:27,589
四骑士……抱歉，是五骑士！
The Four... Sorry, make that Five Horsemen!

1511
01:35:40,836 --> 01:35:41,904
感谢大家。
Thank you, everyone.

1512
01:35:41,937 --> 01:35:53,348
哇哦。呃……要知道，我们曾给全球各地的观众带来娱乐，或者说让他们眼花缭乱，但我们从未参与过像这样的戏法。
Wow. Uh... You know, we have entertained, well, dazzled audiences all over the world, but we have never been part of a trick like this.

1513
01:35:53,381 --> 01:35:57,185
你可能在想：“他们是怎么做到的？”
And you may be asking yourself, "How did they pull this off?"

1514
01:35:57,219 --> 01:36:00,856
好吧，每个魔术师都需要一个助手。维罗妮卡？
Okay, well, every magician needs an assistant. Veronika?

1515
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:10,132
你或许认为，作为彼得·范登伯格唯一的继承人，维罗妮卡才是这颗钻石的合法拥有者。
You may think Veronika here, as Peter Vanderberg's sole heir, is the rightful owner of this diamond.

1516
01:36:10,165 --> 01:36:12,367
但是，事情有了转折。
But, here's the twist.

1517
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,937
彼得不止一个孩子。他有两个。
Peter didn't have one child. He had two.

1518
01:36:14,970 --> 01:36:16,338
没错。
That's right.

1519
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:18,941
而那个孩子从死亡边缘逃出生天。
And that other child cheated death.

1520
01:36:18,974 --> 01:36:20,943
最终来到了纽约市。
And landed in New York City.

1521
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:26,748
在那里，复仇成为他毕生的使命。
Where vengeance became his life's work.

1522
01:36:28,884 --> 01:36:30,552
但他将需要一些帮助。
But he would need help.

1523
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:33,388
哦。找到苏格兰威士忌了。多谢。
Oh. Found the scotch. Thanks.

1524
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:35,723
于是他去招募了。
So he recruited.

1525
01:36:35,757 --> 01:36:36,791
... 到什么时候停止，告诉我时间点。
...when to stop, tell me when.

1526
01:36:36,825 --> 01:36:37,893
停止。
Stop.

1527
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:39,027
- 那是你的牌吗？ - 是的。
- Is that your card? - Yes.

1528
01:36:39,061 --> 01:36:40,762
是吗？你想知道我是怎么做到的吗？
Yeah? You want to know how I did it?

1529
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:41,830
被诱惑...
Enticed...

1530
01:36:43,899 --> 01:36:53,075
并召集了一些他所能找到的最聪明的人才，为一场前所未有的魔术表演奠定了基础。
and lured some of the most brilliant minds he could assemble, laying the groundwork for a trick unlike any other.

1531
01:36:55,243 --> 01:36:57,913
这就引向了今晚。
Which brings us to tonight.

1532
01:36:57,946 --> 01:37:01,216
为这一切背后的策划者欢呼吧。
Make some noise for the mastermind behind all of this.

1533
01:37:01,249 --> 01:37:02,784
我们最好的朋友。
Our best friend.

1534
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,787
- 一个幽灵… - 直到此刻。
- A ghost... - Until this very moment.

1535
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,755
查理·范德伯格！
Charlie Vanderberg!

1536
01:37:11,093 --> 01:37:12,928
- 哇。 - 呜呼！
- Wow. - Whoo!

1537
01:37:16,264 --> 01:37:20,202
我知道我说过我会很享受把你击倒，但这比我想象的更有趣。
I know I said I'd enjoy taking you down, but this is more fun than I anticipated.

1538
01:37:20,235 --> 01:37:22,938
你仍然是个可悲而可怜的人。
You are still a sad and pathetic man.

1539
01:37:22,971 --> 01:37:24,239
而你什么都不是。
And you are nothing.

1540
01:37:24,272 --> 01:37:26,108
哦，等一下，各位。马上就好。
Oh, hold on, everyone. One sec.

1541
01:37:26,141 --> 01:37:27,575
- 而你永远也不会是。 - 那是什么意思？
- And you never will be. - What's that?

1542
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:28,944
我不明白你是怎么做到的。
I don't understand how you pulled this off.

1543
01:37:28,977 --> 01:37:30,112
不明白吗？
You don't understand?

1544
01:37:30,145 --> 01:37:34,516
维罗妮卡似乎也不理解自己为何会落到这般田地。
Veronika doesn't seem to understand how she found herself in this position.

1545
01:37:34,549 --> 01:37:36,751
好吧，我们来解释给她听。
Well, let's explain it to her.

1546
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:42,257
要知道，最精妙的魔法往往利用人们的惯常想法。
You see, the finest magic preys on assumptions.

1547
01:37:42,290 --> 01:37:45,460
比如，你会理所当然地认为等待你的车就是之前送你来的那一辆。
That the car waiting for you was the same one that dropped you off.

1548
01:37:45,493 --> 01:37:46,528
我们走。
Let's go.

1549
01:37:50,298 --> 01:37:53,701
那大自然的力量绝非儿戏。
That an act of Mother Nature is nothing but.

1550
01:38:05,347 --> 01:38:08,850
而沙漠中的地库也不仅仅是障眼法。
And that a vault in the desert isn't just smoke and mirrors.

1551
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:16,691
那支枪里装填的并非空包弹。
That a gun isn't filled with blanks.

1552
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:22,164
而电梯也只是简单地向地下沉降而已。
And that an elevator is just simply descending into earth.

1553
01:38:22,197 --> 01:38:28,003
想要欺骗欺诈大师，就必须操控她的现实。
If you want to trick the master of deception, you have to manipulate her reality.

1554
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:32,740
而作为我们最后的魔术，何不让维罗妮卡消失呢？
And for our last trick, why don't we make Veronika disappear?

1555
01:38:34,676 --> 01:38:35,843
不。
No.

1556
01:38:35,877 --> 01:38:37,312
你赢不了。
You don't win.

1557
01:38:37,345 --> 01:38:39,814
- 我是范德伯格家族的人！- 她就在那里。
- I'm the Vanderberg family! - There she is.

1558
01:38:39,847 --> 01:38:41,083
已经开始想你了。
Miss you already.

1559
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:43,151
- 终极揭露！- 你听见我说话了吗？
- Final reveal! - Do you hear me?

1560
01:38:43,185 --> 01:38:44,652
真正的维罗妮卡·范德伯格。
The real Veronika Vanderberg.

1561
01:38:44,686 --> 01:38:46,821
范德堡家族从未失败！
The Vanderbergs do not lose!

1562
01:38:46,854 --> 01:38:49,191
这个世界充满了假象。
The world is full of illusions.

1563
01:38:49,224 --> 01:38:54,162
最大的假象之一便是，这枚钻石根本不属于范德堡家族。
One of the biggest is that this diamond belongs to the Vanderbergs at all.

1564
01:38:54,196 --> 01:39:03,038
作为父亲唯一未被监禁的直系亲属，我将确保每一位非法买家都受到法律的追究。
As my father's only un-incarcerated next of kin, I'll make sure every one of our illicit buyers faces legal repercussions.

1565
01:39:03,071 --> 01:39:14,182
然后，我会把我们所有的资产，包括"心灵之石"，赠予它们所来源的南非社区，同时还会留下一些额外的款项分给在座各位。
And then I'll gift all our assets, including the Heart, to the South African communities they came from with a few extra dollars left for all of you.

1566
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:18,953
马术表演团队的观众们总是能带着满满的荷包离开。
Horsemen crowds always leave with deeper pockets.

1567
01:39:18,987 --> 01:39:21,189
- 好把戏。 - 我是从最棒的人那里学来的。
- Nice trick. - I learned from the best.

1568
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,259
谢谢你。
Thank you.

1569
01:39:25,293 --> 01:39:26,361
谢谢。
Thank you.

1570
01:39:26,394 --> 01:39:29,864
感谢你们加入我们，我们所有人。
Thank you for joining us, all of us.

1571
01:39:31,166 --> 01:39:38,640
请记住，无论命运给你怎样的牌局，你都必须学会创造属于自己的魔法。
And please remember, no matter what cards life deals you, you have to learn to make your own magic.

1572
01:39:39,441 --> 01:39:43,411
女士们先生们……——我们是四骑士。——晚安。
Ladies and gentlemen... - We are the Horsemen. - Good night.

1573
01:40:19,381 --> 01:40:22,284
* 阿里拿下了一分*
* Ali made a score *

1574
01:40:22,317 --> 01:40:24,586
* 赚了一百万 还想要更多...*
* Made a milli Wanted more... *

1575
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:28,890
好吧，你想要什么，石榴还是波森莓味？
All right, what do you want, pomegranate or boysenberry?

1576
01:40:28,923 --> 01:40:30,958
老兄，我说过我想要杯饮料。
Dude, I said I wanted a drink.

1577
01:40:30,992 --> 01:40:32,627
不妨一试。
Just give it a try.

1578
01:40:34,696 --> 01:40:36,398
现在的孩子啊。
Kids today.

1579
01:40:41,169 --> 01:40:42,504
- 嗯！- 当然了。
- Mm! - Of course.

1580
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,705
这挺不错的。
That's pretty good.

1581
01:40:43,738 --> 01:40:45,006
- 你想试试吗？ - 不。
- You wanna try? - No.

1582
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:46,808
我想这个是你掉的。
I think you dropped this.

1583
01:40:47,809 --> 01:40:49,211
哦。我的旧卡片。
Oh. My old card.

1584
01:40:49,244 --> 01:40:50,645
万一你想裱起来呢。
Just in case you wanna frame it.

1585
01:40:50,678 --> 01:40:52,814
谢谢。我可能会的。
Thanks. I might.

1586
01:40:52,847 --> 01:40:55,150
你知道吗，我还是不敢相信你是范登堡家族的人。
You know, I still cannot believe you're a Vanderberg.

1587
01:40:55,183 --> 01:40:56,551
她当初也不敢相信。
Neither could she.

1588
01:40:56,584 --> 01:40:59,487
我在想，我觉得我们应该成立我们自己的团体，伙计们。
I was thinking I feel like we should start our own group, you guys.

1589
01:40:59,521 --> 01:41:01,055
- 女孩们的魔法团体？ - 对，对，对。
- A girls magic group? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1590
01:41:01,089 --> 01:41:03,758
- 没错。 - 马...马术女孩。
- Yes. - The Hor... Horsegirls.

1591
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:06,394
- 不对。不是这个。 - 等等，女骑士们。
- No. Not that. - Wait, Horsewomen.

1592
01:41:06,428 --> 01:41:07,729
- 也不是这个。 - 马背上的淑女们。
- Not that. - Ladies of the Horse.

1593
01:41:07,762 --> 01:41:08,963
- 不会是这样的。 - 小马！
- It wouldn't be that. - Ponies!

1594
01:41:08,996 --> 01:41:10,031
- 那真的很糟糕。 - 是吗？
- That's really bad. - Yeah?

1595
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,466
我能和你简单聊一下吗？
Can I talk to you real quick?

1596
01:41:11,499 --> 01:41:12,900
噢！
Ooh!

1597
01:41:12,934 --> 01:41:14,902
我没想混进四骑士之中。
I'm not trying to infiltrate the Horsewomen.

1598
01:41:14,936 --> 01:41:16,504
怎么了... 发生什么事了？
What... what's up?

1599
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:20,908
呃... - 就是... - 说。
Um... - It's just... - Speak.

1600
01:41:20,942 --> 01:41:22,410
你这是怎么回事？哪里不对劲了？
What is the matter with you? What's wrong?

1601
01:41:22,444 --> 01:41:26,248
这很困难，因为我不... 我不知道你是什么感受。
It's hard because I don't... I don't know how you feel.

1602
01:41:26,281 --> 01:41:29,351
所以... 嘿，呃，大家。
And so... Hey, uh, everybody.

1603
01:41:29,384 --> 01:41:31,919
大家都过来这边，拜托了。
Everybody, come on over here, please.

1604
01:41:31,953 --> 01:41:33,988
好吗？来这边，各位。
Yeah? Come on, guys.

1605
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:37,759
嘿，博斯科，你能再拿些那些美味的东西过来吗？
Hey, can you grab some more of those delicious things, Bosco?

1606
01:41:37,792 --> 01:41:41,563
你会爱上这玩意儿的，简直绝了。
You are gonna love this stuff. It is slap.

1607
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:43,665
- 不，梅里特，拜托了。- 超赞的。
- No, Merritt, please. - It slaps.

1608
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:45,200
我的意思是说这东西很好吃。
What I meant to say is it's good.

1609
01:41:45,233 --> 01:41:46,268
是的，没错。
Yeah. Right.

1610
01:41:46,301 --> 01:41:48,570
没错，这话就让我来说吧。
Yes, and I will be the one to say it.

1611
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,104
我会想念大家的。
I'm going to miss you guys.

1612
01:41:51,406 --> 01:41:52,740
我刚才也在想同样的事。
I was just thinking the same thing.

1613
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:53,875
是啊。我也是。
Yeah. Me, too.

1614
01:41:54,776 --> 01:41:56,278
该死，我爱死你们了。
Damn it, I love you guys.

1615
01:41:56,311 --> 01:41:57,879
- 噢。 - 我们也爱你。
- Aw. - We love you, too.

1616
01:41:57,912 --> 01:41:59,747
我们爱你。
We love you.

1617
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:01,949
- 真可爱。- 我也是。
- Adorable. - Me, too.

1618
01:42:01,983 --> 01:42:03,351
- 非常贴心。- 连我也是吗？
- Very sweet. - Even me?

1619
01:42:03,385 --> 01:42:05,353
真的吗？你一定是喝醉了。
Really? You must be very drunk.

1620
01:42:05,387 --> 01:42:06,721
哇哦。
Whoa.

1621
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:09,090
- 哦，天哪。- 换个话题聊聊吧。
- Oh, my God. - Just talk about something else.

1622
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:10,792
回到我们曾经……我们都深爱着彼此。
Go back to what... We all love each other.

1623
01:42:10,825 --> 01:42:12,394
- 你爱他，他爱她。- 碰个拳。碰个拳。
- You love him, he loves her. - Fist bump. Fist bump.

1624
01:42:12,427 --> 01:42:13,761
你们之间的爱更深。
You guys love each other more.

1625
01:42:13,795 --> 01:42:15,129
噢。
Oh.

1626
01:42:15,163 --> 01:42:17,365
你们在等人吗？
You guys expecting someone?

1627
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:18,933
没有人该知道我们在哪。
No one's supposed to know where we are.

1628
01:42:36,651 --> 01:42:38,720
- 谁寄来的？ - 没说。
- Who's it from? - Doesn't say.

1629
01:42:38,753 --> 01:42:40,121
打开看看。
Open it.

1630
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:41,423
你把它打开。
You open it.

1631
01:42:41,456 --> 01:42:42,490
好的。
Okay.

1632
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:51,433
哦，那就是……那门上的东西。
Oh, that's the... that's the thing from the door.

1633
01:42:51,466 --> 01:42:52,834
- 对，来自城堡。- 哦，没错！
- Yeah, from the chateau. - Oh, yeah!

1634
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:55,237
那个，呃……你介意我再试一次吗？
Do you, uh... You mind if I take another crack at it?

1635
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:56,671
- 好啊，好啊，你试试看。 - 真的吗？
- Yeah, yeah, go for it. - Yeah?

1636
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,476
我觉得这次我能搞定。
I think I can handle it this time.

1637
01:43:15,557 --> 01:43:16,824
你们好，骑士们。
Hello, Horsemen.

1638
01:43:17,992 --> 01:43:19,193
你想我了吗？
Did you miss me?

1639
01:43:19,227 --> 01:43:20,628
迪伦。
Dylan.

1640
01:43:20,662 --> 01:43:23,097
但他应该还在监狱里才对。
But he's supposed to be in prison.

1641
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:26,133
我知道你在想什么。“他对我们撒谎了。”
I know what you're thinking. "He lied to us."

1642
01:43:26,167 --> 01:43:27,535
但我……我没有骗你。
But I... I didn't lie to you.

1643
01:43:27,569 --> 01:43:30,037
我只是引导你相信了并非事实的事。
I just led you to believe something that wasn't true.

1644
01:43:30,071 --> 01:43:33,140
但这都是为了你好，相信我。
But it was for your own good, trust me.

1645
01:43:33,174 --> 01:43:35,277
这个谜团远比你意识到的要复杂。
There's more to this mystery than you realize.

1646
01:43:35,310 --> 01:43:38,680
最终的结果是四骑士再度聚首。
And the end result is that the Horsemen are back together again.

1647
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:39,914
这让我倍感欣慰。
It warms my heart.

1648
01:43:41,749 --> 01:43:49,291
至于你们这三个冒牌货，竟敢厚颜无耻地伪装成我们绝密组织的一员？
Now, for you three imposters, brazenly pretending like you're part of our top secret organization?

1649
01:43:49,324 --> 01:43:54,762
你们以为能就此全身而退，毫无后果或报应吗？
You think you're gonna get away with it with no consequences or repercussions?

1650
01:43:55,663 --> 01:43:58,800
好吧...你猜得没错。
Well... you thought right.

1651
01:43:58,833 --> 01:44:00,735
- 嘿！- 欢迎光临。
- Hey! - Welcome.

1652
01:44:01,436 --> 01:44:02,937
欢迎来到眼睛酒店。
Welcome to The Eye.

1653
01:44:04,906 --> 01:44:09,577
至于你们其他人，是不是以为你们的活儿都干完了。
As for the rest of you, you thought your work was done.

1654
01:44:10,945 --> 01:44:12,246
再考虑一下吧，团队。
Think again, team.

1655
01:44:13,348 --> 01:44:15,182
你们才刚刚开始。
You're just getting started.

1656
01:44:18,420 --> 01:44:20,254
是什么把戏？
What's the trick?

1657
01:44:32,867 --> 01:44:34,636
* 快点 *
* Hurry up *

1658
01:44:34,669 --> 01:44:37,539
* 我发誓我已经没耐心了 *
* I swear to God I'm out of patience *

1659
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:41,576
* 我驱车抵达 *
* I pull up *

1660
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:44,312
* 无论是否受到邀请 *
* With or without an invitation *

1661
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:49,751
* 因为我如此酷炫 而且我如此富有 *
* 'Cause I'm so fly And I'm so money *

1662
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:53,955
* 宝贝，你可以欣赏但别动手动脚 *
* Baby, you can look But don't get touchy *

1663
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:57,258
* 我车速飞快，宝贝，我行事果决 *
* I go fast baby, I go hard *

1664
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:00,828
* 即使我撞车也不留下丝毫刮痕 *
* But don't leave a scratch when I crash my car *

1665
01:45:00,862 --> 01:45:04,599
* 在星光大道上漫步于星河之间 *
* Steppin' on stars on the boulevard *

1666
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:06,300
* 我觉得这有点好笑 *
* I find it kinda funny *

1667
01:45:06,334 --> 01:45:08,403
* 我变得如此啦啦啦幸运 *
* I get so la-la-la lucky *

1668
01:45:08,436 --> 01:45:09,904
* 好吧，随心所欲 *
* Okay, got my way *

1669
01:45:09,937 --> 01:45:11,739
* 我简直就像蕾妮一样 *
* It's almost like I'm Renee *

1670
01:45:11,773 --> 01:45:13,240
*哦不，我躲到哪里去了*
* Oh no, where'd I go? *

1671
01:45:13,274 --> 01:45:15,309
* 此刻你能看见我 转瞬又不见踪影 *
* Now you see me Now you don't *

1672
01:45:15,343 --> 01:45:16,811
* 好吧，找到我的办法了 *
* Okay, got my way *

1673
01:45:16,844 --> 01:45:18,746
* 这感觉几乎像是我成了蕾妮 *
* It's almost like I'm Renee *

1674
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:20,281
* 噢不，我去哪儿了 *
* Oh no, where'd I go *

1675
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,216
* 此刻你看见我 此刻你消失 *
* Now you see me Now you don't *

1676
01:45:22,249 --> 01:45:25,487
* 我疾驰如风宝贝，我全力以赴 *
* I go fast baby, I go hard *

1677
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,090
* 但当我撞毁座驾时 不会留下半点刮痕 *
* But don't leave a scratch when I crash my car *

1678
01:45:29,123 --> 01:45:32,760
* 漫步星光大道 *
* Steppin' on stars on the boulevard *

1679
01:45:32,794 --> 01:45:34,596
* 这情景颇有几分奇妙 *
* I find it kinda funny *

1680
01:45:34,629 --> 01:45:36,464
* 我竟如此幸运 *
* I get so la-la-la lucky *

1681
01:45:38,433 --> 01:45:40,368

1688
01:45:57,619 --> 01:45:59,286
* 听我说 *
* Hear me out *

1689
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:02,156
* 我向来不太擅长倾听 *
* I've never been too good at listenin' *

1690
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:06,461
* 我擅长获取我想要的一切 *
* I'm good at getting what I want *

1691
01:46:06,494 --> 01:46:08,896
* 既不需要宽恕也无需许可 *
* Don't need forgiveness or permission *

1692
01:46:11,132 --> 01:46:14,636
* 因为我如此耀眼 我如此富足 *
* 'Cause I'm so fly And I'm so money *
