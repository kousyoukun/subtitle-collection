十环的传说
The legend of the ten rings

24
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,110
已经流传了上千年
has been told for thousands of years.

25
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:56,690
不论这个故事如何演变
Every generation, the story grows.

26
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,370
它的主人公永远都是同一个人
But at its centre there is always one man.

27
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:18,220
有人说他的十环是火山口里捡来的 还有人说是墓穴里盗来的
Some say he found the rings in a crater or stole them from a tomb.

28
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,850
它们给了他神一般的力量
They gave him the strength of a god,

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,650
也赋予了他长生不老的魔法
and the gift of eternal life.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,610
他本可借着十环之力来惩恶扬善
He could have used them for good.

31
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,280
但他想要的
But all he wanted...

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,610
只有征服
was power.

33
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,400
他打造了一支十环军团
He called his army The Ten Rings

34
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:38,500
千百年来 他们扫荡了世界的每个角落
Over the centuries, they spread into every corner of the world.

35
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,180
他们潜伏于暗处
They moved in the shadows...

36
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,370
颠覆各方政权
Toppled governments...

37
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,190
也改写了历史
And changed the course of history.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,460
凭借着十环之力 他早已称霸千年
He chased money and power for a thousand years.

39
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,740
但他却还不满足
But he still wanted more.

40
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,100
听过塔罗的传说吗
Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,140
一个隐世的村庄 在那里神奇的功法代代相传
A hidden village with mythical creatures and ancient magic.

42
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,400
传说中的神兽和古老的法术还都存在
Where people practise a martial arts style from the gods.

43
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,320
我要找到这个地方
I want to find it.

44
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,950
明白 我这就派侦察队去一探究竟
Of course. I'll send a scout to explore the area,

45
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,790
然后有消息立马跟您汇报
and come back with more information.

46
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,070
我们现在就去
I want to go now.

47
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,030
竹林在
The forest...

48
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,160
正在动
...is moving

49
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,540
这世上再也没有可以让他征服的地方了
He had nothing left on Earth to conquer.

50
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,430
于是他找上了我的家乡
That's when he came for my home.

51
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,700
塔罗的入口在哪
Where's the entrance to Ta Lo?

52
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,580
我们村庄不欢迎你
You're not welcome in our village.

53
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,290
你好像不知道我是谁
You don't know who you're talking to.

54
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,670
我不管你是谁
I don't care who you are.

55
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,820
走吧 不要自找麻烦
Turn around now, and I won't have to hurt you.

56
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,570
就这点本事
Is that all?

57
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,450
那是我第一次见到你的父亲
That was the first time I met your father.

58
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:11,880
我从没想过自己会为他动心
He was the last person I thought I'd fall for.

59
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,160
但爱总是自有安排
But love had other plans.

60
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,710
尚气
Shang-Chi,

61
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,810
十环的传说啊 讲都讲不完
there's much more to know about the legend of the rings,

62
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,270
等你长大了 自然就会了解的
but you'll learn about that when you're older.

63
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:35,190
可爸爸的十环那么厉害 你是怎么打败他的
If Dad's rings were so powerful, how did you beat him?

64
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:43,560
妈妈的故乡塔罗 有一个神龙 它是我们的保护神 它将魔法赋予在了我们每个人的身上
Where I'm from, we are empowered by the magic of the Great Protector.

65
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,500
当你领悟了神龙之心
When you have the heart of our dragon,

66
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,130
你就可以做很多了不起的事情
you can do some amazing things.

67
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,060
那你现在还有魔法吗
Can you still do those things?

68
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,260
妈妈离开的时候啊 把魔法还给了神龙
I left those powers in Ta Lo with our dragon,

69
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,810
但是妈妈得到的更宝贵
but what I got in return is so much better

70
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,970
这个给你
I want you to have this.

71
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,150
如果有一天你迷路了
Whenever you feel lost,

72
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,950
它会帮你找到回家的路
this will help you find your way home.

73
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,840
记住了吗
Can you remember that?

74
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,760
呃
Okay.

75
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,870
先生您好
Hello, sir,

76
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,700
欢迎光临费尔蒙特...
welcome to the Fairmont...

77
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,870
我来开车
I'm driving.

78
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,500
不行 凯蒂
No, you're not... Katy.

79
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,460
嘿 嘿 回来
Hey, hey, get back here.

80
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,570
钥匙给我
Give me the key.

81
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,420
请开门
Please open the door

82
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,260
听听这引擎
My God

83
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,180
- 下车  - 你上车
-Get out. -You get in!

84
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,300
听着 要是出了什么问题
Look, if happens to this thing,

85
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,470
我们都得失业
we're gonna be jobless

86
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,800
而且下半辈子都得还债了
and in debt for the rest of our lives.

87
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,060
拜托 不会有事的
Come on. Nothing's gonna happen to this car.

88
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,640
我是亚洲杰夫·戈登
I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.

89
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,980
我不认识这个人
I don't know who that is.

90
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,940
全美改装车竞赛历史上获奖最多的人
Most career wins in all of NASCAR history?

91
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,900
请你下车
Please get out of the car.

92
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
尚恩
Shaun,

93
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,270
我们已经是10年老朋友了 好吗
we've been friends for 10 years, okay?

94
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,780
你也清楚 我又不笨
You know I'm not an idiot.

95
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,740
上车吧 我会慢慢开的
Please, get in. I'll go slow.

96
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,740
凯蒂 小心...
Katy, watch the...

97
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,630
高中时第一次见到凯蒂
I knew Katy was trouble

98
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,170
我就知道她是一个惹事精
the first day we met in high school.

99
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,290
当时我总被人欺负...
I was getting picked on a lot,.

100
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,710
我们都总会因为各种原因被人欺负
-for all the reasons we all get picked on a lot

101
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,170
况且我才到美国
Plus, I had just moved to the US,

102
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
英语也不好
so I was struggling with my English,

103
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,970
记得有一天我在去吃午饭的路上
and I was on my way to lunch one day

104
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,890
有个体型比我大一圈的人
when this guy who was like twice my size

105
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,970
在走廊另一头大喊
yells at me from down the hall,

106
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,010
"哟 江南Style"
"What's up, Gangnam Style?"

107
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,980
然后我喊回去 "白痴 我不是韩国人"
So I yelled back, "I'm not Korean, idiot."

108
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,060
我站在角落
And I turn the corner,

109
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,850
看到那男的把书包一放
and I see this guy drop his backpack,

110
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,270
满脸怒气
he's getting all up in his face...

111
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,230
准备给我来上一拳 就在这时
And right before he was about to throw the first punch,

112
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,230
凯蒂不知道从哪儿冒出来
Katy comes out of nowhere,

113
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,570
站在我们中间 然后开始大喊
steps right between us and starts screaming the lyrics

114
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,150
加州旅馆的歌词
to Hotel California.

115
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,220
什么?
What?

116
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,580
这就是混淆视听的艺术 对笨蛋非常有效
It's the art of confusion. Works great on stupid people.

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,780
我们就是这样认识的
And that's how we met.

118
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:12,370
然后我把他拉到停车场
Then I pulled him into the parking lot...

119
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,580
凯蒂告诉我
At which point she revealed.

120
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,040
她把那男的野马车钥匙顺走了
that she had also swiped the keys to the guy's Mustang

121
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,210
于是 我们就在附近游车河
Yeah, we went on a little joyride around the block.

122
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,840
当时你妻子也在车里
And your wife was in the car, too.

123
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,550
-真的 你当时在  -什么?
-That's true. You were. -What?

124
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,050
我只是坐在后排而已
I was just in the back seat.

125
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,130
那也是车的一部分
That's a part of the car.

126
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,300
仍然是坐在车里
That's still a part of the car.

127
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,090
你怎么从没说过这件事
How have you never told me this story?

128
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,340
你知道的 你老婆在做律师之前
You know, before she was a lawyer,

129
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,850
可是很狂野的
your girl was pretty wild.

130
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,220
发生什么了
What happened?

131
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,590
我长大了
I grew up.

132
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,310
这话是什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

133
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,390
这话是什么意思
Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?

134
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,150
意思是也许到了某个时候
That maybe there's a point

135
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,270
你就该停止四处兜风享乐
where you're supposed to stop going on joyrides

136
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,860
并开始考虑发挥自己的潜能
and start thinking about living up to your potential.

137
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,530
你是在开玩笑吧 苏
Please tell me you're kidding, Soo.

138
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,740
听着
Look,

139
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,860
我们现在生活着的这个世界
we're now living in a world.

140
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,950
一半的人口
where at any moment.

141
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,450
随时可能消失
half the population can just disappear.

142
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,870
生命如此短暂 如此脆弱
Life's too short and too fragile.

143
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,540
凯蒂 你是个有伯克利荣誉学位的
Katy, you're a valet driver

144
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,160
泊车员
with an honours degree from Berkeley,

145
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,580
尚恩能说四种语言
and Shaun can speak, like, four languages.

146
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,670
你们是我认识的人里最有才华的
You've always been the most talented people I know.

147
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,840
我只是不明白为什么你们害怕
I just don't get why you're scared

148
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,420
把才华用在正事上
to actually use it for something serious.

149
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,490
哇哦
Wow.

150
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,180
你说话像我妈 你打扮得...
You sound like my mom. You also...

151
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,600
也有点像她
dress like her a little bit, too.

152
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,720
你从哪里买的这件衣服 塔尔伯茨（女性服饰品牌）吗
Where's this from, Talbots?

153
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,810
我们才不是在逃避成年呢
We're not running from adulthood.

154
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,270
做自己喜欢的工作怎么就算逃避了
How is it running to have jobs that you actually like?

155
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,850
是啊 这根本说不通
Yeah, that doesn't even make any sense.

156
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,400
难道代客泊车很容易吗
Did you think valet parking is easy?

157
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,400
这大概是史上最具挑战性的工作了
It's like the most challenging job ever.

158
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,860
你得有人际交往能力 驾驶技术
You need people skills, driving skills...

159
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,450
苏连侧方位停车都不会呢
Soo can't even parallel park

160
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,290
现在都快十二点了 我们还要上早班呢
Well, it's almost midnight. We got the early shift.

161
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,040
我们应该负起责任来 该睡觉了
Should probably be responsible, go to sleep.

162
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,920
是啊 我们应该负起责任来 该睡了
Yeah, we can be responsible. We can do that.

163
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,980
或者
Or...

164
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,420
♪由一场魔毯之旅 看尽路旁与地下的奇景♪

169
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,960
早上好 陈太太
Morning, Mrs Chen.

170
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,260
她还没好呢
She's not ready yet.

171
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,590
先进来吃点粥等等吧
Come have some joe while you wait.

172
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,720
凯蒂 尚恩来啦
Katy, Shaun's here.

173
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,560
好啦 妈 我一会儿就来
Yeah, Mom, be there in a minute.

174
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,640
瑞华
Ruihua,.

175
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,310
你怎么还没去帮你爸给店里进货
you're supposed to be helping your dad stock the shop

176
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,650
妈妈 我饿着肚子怎么干活 一会儿腿该抽筋了
Mom, I can't work on an empty stomach, my legs get crampy.

177
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,110
怎么不叫尚恩去
Maybe Shaun can help him

178
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,480
他天天都来这里蹭饭吃
instead of just showing up every day to eat our food.

179
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,860
我很乐意帮忙
I'm happy to help.

180
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,240
不用 瑞华该干的活儿 让他自个儿去
No, it's Ruihua's job, let him do it.

181
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,310
外婆
Waipo.

182
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,700
这是外公的座位
That seat's for Waigong.

183
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,330
对不起
Sorry.

184
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,920
今年清明节 我准备给他 他最喜欢的东西
He's getting all his favourite things this year for the Day of the Dead.

185
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,590
您确定外公
Are you sure that Waigong's allowed to take

186
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,670
能在下面享用这些
Funyuns and cigarettes

187
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,960
洋葱圈和香烟吗
back to the afterlife?

188
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,880
他什么都可以吃
He can take anything.

189
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:15,260
去年我在他的坟前放了一瓶白酒
Last year I put a bottle of whisky on his grave...

190
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:17,220
第二天 没啦
And it was gone the next morning.

191
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:21,640
我知道你们觉得我很傻
I know you kids think it's silly.

192
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,060
我们没觉得您傻 外婆
We don't think it's silly, Waipo.

193
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,190
只是知道外公他在天之灵肯定也希望您走出悲伤
We just know Waigong would've wanted you to move on

194
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,360
享受生活
and enjoy your life.

195
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,730
"走出悲伤"是美国人的观念
"Moving on" is an American idea.

196
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,490
你可是个美国妈妈 别忘了
You're American, Mom! Don't forget.

197
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,650
尚恩
Shaun,

198
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,990
我女儿这周有没有"跳槽"的打算呀
did my daughter apply to any new jobs this week?

199
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,910
她很喜欢现在这份工作
She really likes her job.

200
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,080
我俩都是
We both do.

201
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,120
当初外公从湖南大老远过来
Waigong didn't move here from Hunan

202
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,630
可不是为了让你在这儿给人泊车讨生活的
so you could park cars for a living.

203
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,790
这话倒提醒了我
Well, on that note,

204
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,340
咱们再不走就赶不上公交了
I think we're gonna miss our bus.

205
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,380
对不起 我找了个不体面的工作
I'm sorry for my unacceptable job.

206
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,760
昨晚还熬夜通宵
And for staying out late last night,

207
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,760
享受人生
trying to enjoy my life.

208
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,800
但总有一天 你会为我感到骄傲的 我保证
But one day, I'll make you proud, I promise.

209
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,350
我为你骄傲 姐
I'm proud of you, sis.

210
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,020
泊车 超难的
Parking cars is super hard.

211
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,100
谢了老弟
Thanks, bro.

212
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,430
等你考到了驾照
Maybe one day you'll pass your driver's test,

213
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,600
就能跟我一样实现梦想了
live the dream like me.

214
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,400
-尚恩 我们走吧 -走了 外婆
Come on, Shaun, let's go.

215
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,110
你们什么时候结婚
When are you two going to get married?

216
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,490
外婆 我们只是朋友
Waipo, we're just friends.

217
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,460
好吧 走走走
All right. Go, go, go.

218
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,250
瞧瞧那个女生
Look. Look at that. Look at that girl.

219
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,670
她居然在公交车上写论文
She's writing a research paper on a bus.

220
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,750
所以呢
So?

221
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,250
我妈一度幻想从她的阴道里
That is exactly the daughter

222
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,670
能爬出来这种完美女儿
my mom wishes came out of her vagina.

223
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,310
对不起 她人就这样
I'm sorry about her.

224
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,280
怎么了?
How's it goin'?

225
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,810
项链给我
Give me the pendant,

226
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,570
就没有人会受伤
and no one gets hurt.

227
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,570
你认识这家伙?
Do you know this guy?

228
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,780
我听不懂你在说啥 哥们
I don't know what you're talking about, dude.

229
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,660
-嘿 怎么回事 离我远点 -唔喔
- Hey! Get off of me! - Whoa.

230
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,280
你们他妈的有什么毛病?
What is wrong with you, asshole?

231
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,450
我不想惹麻烦
I don't want any trouble.

232
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,450
那就把项链交出来
Then give us the pendant!

233
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,290
你找错人了
You have the wrong guy!

234
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,620
他看起来很能打吗
Does he look like he can fight?

235
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,330
别闹了 大哥
Come on, bro!

236
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,710
你还好吗
You okay?

237
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,240
大家好 这里是克里夫
Yo, what up, y'all? It's your boy Klev,

238
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,070
在公交上为您实时直播
comin' at you live on the bus.

239
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,450
我年轻的时候
I actually did take

240
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,490
练过一点武术
a little bit of martial arts as a youth,

241
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,550
所以我现在试试解说一下这场打斗
so I'm gonna try and grade this fight as we're goin'.

242
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,460
我靠
Holy shit.

243
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,430
你是谁?
Who are you?

244
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,360
兄弟 你可以的
You got this, bro!

245
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,180
额 当我没说
My bad.

246
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,060
不 不 不
No, no, no!

247
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,820
对不起
Sorry.

248
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,360
这他妈到底什么情况
What the hell's going on?

249
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,520
你非得现在问吗
You really wanna talk about this now?

250
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,330
司机不行了
Bus driver is down.

251
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,660
我不会去接盘的
I'm not gonna handle this.

252
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,250
我一开车就被人骂
Every time I've tried to drive a bus, I get yelled at.

253
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,870
滚开 怪人
Go, you freak!

254
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,420
开门 求你
Open the door, please!

255
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,410
后面那节车厢快掉了
The back is about to go.

256
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,620
等我信号 你就向右急转
On my signal, make a hard right.

257
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,210
啥信号?
What signal?

258
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,900
所有人快去前车厢
Everybody to the front now!

259
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,110
走走走走
Go! Go, go, go.

260
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,740
你好啊 你好啊 你也好啊
What's up, y'all? What's up, y'all? What's up, y'all?

261
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,960
你和你妹妹罪有应得
You and your sister deserve what's coming.

262
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,450
大家扶稳了
Hold on, everybody!

263
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,520
我的天
God.

264
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,210
救命
My God!

265
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,710
抱歉
Sorry. Heh.

266
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,520
合作愉快
We make a good team.

267
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,050
尚恩 喂
Shaun. Hey.

268
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,930
告诉我刚才到底什么情况
You need to tell me what the hell's going on.

269
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,680
你在干嘛 你要去哪
What are you doing? Where are you going?

270
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,430
-澳门  -澳门?
-Macau. -Macau?

271
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,810
那些家伙要去找我妹妹
Those guys are going after my sister next,

272
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,640
我要在他们之前找到她
and I have to get to her first.

273
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,190
你还有个妹妹?
You have a sister?

274
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,270
我知道你现在很懵
Look, I know this is confusing.

275
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,600
我保证 回来之后会跟你解释的
I'll explain it when I get back, I promise.

276
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,670
不 不
No, no.

277
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,940
得了吧
Hell no, dude.

278
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,270
别给我在这扯蛋
This is bullshit!

279
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,780
我认识你小半辈子了
I have been by your side for half your life.

280
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,860
我明白有些事你不想说
I get there are things you never wanted to talk about,

281
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,820
我也从来不会去问
and I never wanted to push.

282
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,660
但是刚才一个胳膊上装着大砍刀的男的
But a guy with a freaking machete for an arm

283
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,740
把我们坐的巴士砍成了两半 尚恩
just chopped our bus in half, Shaun!

284
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,790
你到底是什么来头?
Who the hell are you?

285
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,300
我妹妹几个月前寄了这个给我
My sister sent me this a few months ago.

286
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,140
这上面的地址应就是她住的地方
I think it's the address of where she's staying.

287
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,390
刚才那些家伙是我父亲派来的
Those guys back there were sent by my dad.

288
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,460
什么
What?

289
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,980
要是他们再去伤害她...
If they hurt her...

290
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:51,320
抱歉 我得走了
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

291
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,260
好吧
Fine.

292
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,950
你可以在飞机上跟我解释
You can explain on the plane.

293
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:58,450
什么 不 凯蒂你别...
What? No, Katy, you can't just...

294
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,300
你可以在飞机上跟我解释清楚 尚恩
You can explain on the plane, Shaun!

295
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,730
妈妈去世后
After my mom died...

296
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,270
我爸爸就开始训练我
my dad started my training.

297
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,330
日复一日 日出到日落
From sunup to sundown,

298
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,840
我学尽各种杀人的方法
I was taught every possible way to kill a man.

299
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,970
14岁时
By the time I was 14,

300
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,050
我已经记不清
I could barely remember

301
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,100
妈妈还在时的生活是什么样了
what life was like before she died.

302
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,230
也就是那一年
That's how old I was

303
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:51,610
他派我去执行了第一个任务
when he sent me on my first assignment.

304
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,730
我原本愿意为他做任何事
I was willing to do anything he wanted.

305
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,070
就算他叫我把这个世界焚烧殆尽
If he asked me to burn the world down,

306
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,150
我也...
I would've asked him...

307
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,780
牛肉还是素食
Beef or vegetarian?

308
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,870
我们的鸡肉餐发完了
We're all out of the chicken,

309
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:04,660
所以只剩牛肉或者素食了
so I can only offer you beef or vegetarian?

310
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:05,870
唔...
Um...

311
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,370
-素食吧  -我也一样
-Vegetarian would be great. -Yeah, same.

312
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,670
好的 谢谢
- Okay. - Thank you.

313
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:11,730
所以...
So...

314
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,800
我们素食也没有了
We're out of the vegetarian too.

315
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,090
现在只有牛肉了
Now we only have beef.

316
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:19,260
那就牛肉 我们也没得选了不是吗
Beef. 'Cause that's all you have, right?

317
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,550
-好的 你要牛肉...  -嗯
-Okay, you'll have the beef. -Yes.

318
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,640
-那么...-牛肉
-And... -Beef.

319
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:25,180
-我也要牛肉  -好的 两份牛肉
-And the beef. -Two beefs.

320
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,190
那你执行完任务了吗?
Did you go through with it?

321
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,990
我知道我不能再回到他身边了 所以我只能...
I knew that I couldn't go back to him, so I just...

322
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,060
‪逃跑‬
ran.

323
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,800
我知道这些对你来说很难消化
I know this is a lot to dump on you.

324
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,200
你妈妈的事我很遗憾
I'm sorry about your mom.

325
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,050
还有一件事要告诉你
I should also probably mention

326
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,310
其实我的本名不是尚恩
that my name's not technically Shaun.

327
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,380
什么
What?

328
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,810
那你的名字是什么
What is it?

329
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,040

It's Shang-Chi.

330
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,030
双气
Shaun-Chi.

331
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,820

00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,720

337
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,190
尚?

338
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,730
对
Yeah.

339
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,210
你把尚改成了尚恩
You changed your name from Shang to Shaun?

340
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,250
对 我不...
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

341
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,920
怪不得你爸能找到你
I wonder how your father found you.

342
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:39,420
我改名的时候才15岁 好吗
Okay, I was 15 years old. All right?

343
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,470

344
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,760

-对  -然后把自己的名字迈克尔

347
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,390
不 不是这么回事儿
That's not what happened.

348
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,640
就好像 嗨 我叫吉娜
It's like, "Hi, my name's Gina.

349
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,770
我要隐姓埋名了 我的新名字是洁娜
"I'm gonna go into hiding. My new name's Gina."

Usually, you gotta fight your way to centre ring,

381

391
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,540
你要打的人 在上面

- Really? What's our cut? - It's huge.

407
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,890
没所谓的好吗
It doesn't matter.

408
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,350
非常有所谓
It matters.

409
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,930
老兄 我看到你和五个杀手
Dude, I saw you fight five assassins

410

and a giant Romanian with a razor for an arm

411
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,520
在行驶的车上搏斗
on a moving bus.

412
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,900
现在只要打一个人就行了
This is just one guy.

413

上吧 这样我们都能拿到钱了
Just do it. Then we all get paid,

然后我来帮你找你要找的人
and then I'll help you find whoever you're looking for.

415
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,200

你得像练习的时候那样
Maybe you'll start controlling those punches

421
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,090
控制出拳
like we practised?

422
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,070
那个人真不错
Love that guy.

423
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,060
现在 把衣服脱了
Now take your shirt off.

424
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,060
女士们 先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

425
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,850
我们期待已久的对决即将开始
the fight we've all been waiting for.

426
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,440
轰动全网的
The incredible viral sensation,

427
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:11,820
从美国旧金山远道而来的
all the way from San Francisco, USA,

428
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,540
公车男孩
it's Bus Boy!

429
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,950
你衣服呢
What happened to your shirt?

430
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,250
而他今晚的对手
And his opponent for tonight,

431
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,970
正是我们澳门令人闻风丧胆的杀手
it's Macau's own fearsome killer...

432
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,050
徐夏灵
Xu Xialing!

433
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,270
灵灵
Sister.

434
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,710
等等 等一下
Wait, wait!

435
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,150
你怎么了你
What are you doing?

436
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,870
我知道你在生我的气
I know you're upset.

437
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,020
但是我有急事跟你...
But can you hear me out?

438
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,050
没有时间打了
We don't have time for this.

439
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:21,440
喔 肯定很疼
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

440
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:29,450
你能不能不打我
Can you please stop hitting me?

441
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,700
住手 我是来帮你的
Stop it! I'm trying to help you!

442
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,460
爸要来找你
Dad's coming for you.

443
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,710
我不会再跟你打了
I'm not fighting you.

444
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,510
你不应该回来的
You shouldn't have come back.

445
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:01,760
有的时候 我在练功
Sometimes when I'm doing my forms...

446
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,870
我闭上我的眼睛
I close my eyes,

447
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,740
就可以感觉 她就在我身后
and it's like I can feel her.

448
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,270
你有这个感觉吗
Do you ever feel like that?

449
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,090
没有
No.

450
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,160
我知道你为什么要去那儿
I know what you're going there to do.

451
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,160
我不知道他跟你说了什么 但是妈妈...
I don't know what he's telling you, but Mom...

452
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,620
妈妈已经死了
Mom's dead.

453
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,010
不要把我扔在这
Please don't leave me here.

454
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,270
灵灵 我三天以后就回来
I'll be back in three days.

455
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,170
徐夏灵 太精彩了
Xu Xialing, you're amazing!

456
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,380
我们爱你 徐夏灵
We love you, Xu Xialing! Whoo!

457
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,230
这地方归你管?
You run this place?

458
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,430
这地方归我
I own it.

459
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,120
你这些钱是哪里来的
Where'd you get all that money?

460
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,330
你押我输?
Did you bet against me?

461
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,390
没有啊
No.

462
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,410
徐夏灵 我是凯蒂
Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy.

463
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,750
你真是酷毙了
You're, like, such a badass.

464
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:54,170
每个动作都堪称经典
Everything that you do is, like, so cool.

465
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,960
太酷了
That was really cool.

466
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,130
你的裤子很好看
I like your pants.

467
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,280
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

468
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,050
你来干什么
What do you want?

469
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,470
十环帮在旧金山伏击了我们
The Ten Rings ambushed us in San Francisco.

470
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,800
我看到视频了
I saw the video.

471
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:08,350
他们拿走了我的项链
They took my pendant.

472
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,680
他们的下一个目标就是你
They're gonna come for yours next.

473
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,190
我摸不准他现在到底想干吗
I don't know what he wants with them,

474
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,770
但肯定不是什么好事
but we both know it can't be good.

475
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,990
你知道他临走前跟我说什么吗?
You know what he said to me when he left?

476
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:26,790
三天后我就会回来
"I'll be back in three days."

477
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,990
三天后
And after three days,

478
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,700
我去妈妈的祠堂等他
I went to our mom's shrine and waited.

479
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,210
三天变成一星期
Three days turned into a week,

480
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,830
一星期变成一个月
a week turned to a month,

481
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,160
一个月变成六年
and a month turned to six years.

482
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,090
我才渐渐意识到
That's how long it took me to realise

483
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,640
我不再需要他了
I didn't need him any more.

484
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,140
我凭一己之力打造了这个地方
I built this place on my own.

485
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:58,770
那个时候我不需要你 现在就更不需要了
I didn't need you then, and I don't need you now.

486
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,150
那你为什么给我寄那张明信片
Then why would you send me the postcard?

487
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,170
什么明信片
What postcard?

488
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,680
这个不是我寄的
I didn't send you this.

489
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,380
这里有后门吗
Is there a back exit?

490
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,450
尚恩
Shaun.

491
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,930
嘿 嘿 嘿 开门
Hey. Hey! Hey, open up!

492
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,970
她已经跑了 兄弟
She's gone, dude.

493
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,950
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

494
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,700
我们该怎么办
What do we do?

495
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,940
快点
Come on!

496
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,510
不会吧 去你的 我绝对不会干这档事的
Hell no. Screw you! I'm not doing this.

497
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,590
如果我们能到电梯那
If we make it to the elevator,

498
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,890
就能接着跳进下一层
we can hop in on the next floor.

499
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:16,060
没有别的办法了 凯蒂 现在就得下去
Katy, we're out of options. We have to go now.

500
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,170
一 二 三
One, two, three.

501
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,060
唔喔
Whoa.

502
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,530
往电梯跑 别回头
Just head straight for that elevator.

503
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,250
你可以的
You got this.

504
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,420
我给你争取点时间 你继续走
I'll buy you some time. Just keep going.

505
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,340
♪ 夜色下的沙漠公路上 ♪
On a dark desert highway

506
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,980
♪ 寒风拂过我的发梢 ♪
Cool wind in my hair

507
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,300
尚恩
Shaun!

508
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,950
尚恩 尚恩
Shaun! Shaun!

509
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,360
我的天
My God!

510
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,760
我来了
I'm coming!

511
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,760
尚恩
Shaun!

512
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,720
坚持住
Hang on.

513
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,760
拉住你了
Gotcha.

514
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:17,830
尚恩
Shaun!

515
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,580
凯蒂
Katy!

516
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:48,790
把我丢在这说走就走
You left us for dead!

517
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,210
现在你知道什么滋味儿了
Now you know how it feels.

518
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,860
他要这个项链做什么?
What does he want with the pendant...

519
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,330
在美国呆了几年 胆儿也变小了?
Did America make you soft?

520
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,510
项链在他手上
He has the pendant!

521
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,430
我跟我手下说过
I told my men

522
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:05,010
你要是动起真格来就杀不了你 他们不相信
they wouldn't be able to kill you if they tried.

523
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,250
还好我是对的
Glad I was right.

524
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:17,120
我很想你 我的儿子
I've missed you, my son.

525
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,570
咱们回家吧
Let's go home.

526
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,280
我的儿子回家了
My son is home.

527
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:29,070
把姑娘们带去她们的房间
Take the girls to their room.

528
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,190
我这周经历了许多心惊胆战的事
I've seen some really scary stuff this week,

529
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,910
但跟你爸相比 真是小巫见大巫
but your dad's on, like, a whole 'nother level.

530
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:47,540
他会杀了我们吗?
Is he gonna kill us?

531
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:52,080
只要言听计从 不多说话 他会忘记你的存在
Just nod. Don't talk. He'll forget you're there.

532
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,970
这便是我的生存之道
That's how I survived.

533
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,880
他一直都这么对你吗?
He always treat you like that?

534
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,900
从我母亲去世后开始
Only after my mom died.

535
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:09,010
他说他无法直视我 因为看着我总会想起母亲
He said he couldn't look at me because I reminded him of her.

536
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,520
他不允许我与男孩子一起训练
I wasn't allowed to train with the boys.

537
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,350
但我看过他们所有的训练内容
But I watched everything they did

538
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,730
我要求自己做得比他们更好
and taught myself to do it better.

539
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,270
那你什么时候离开的?
When did you leave?

540
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,940
我16岁的时候逃离了这里
I ran away when I was 16.

541
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,490
当我知道我哥不会再回来的时候
As soon as I knew my brother wasn't coming back.

542
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:30,120
所以你16岁的时候
You started an underground fight ring in Macau

543
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,330
就在澳门开了家地下竞技场?
when you were 16 years old?

544
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:36,370
如果父亲不让我染指他的帝国
If my dad won't let me into his empire,

545
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,130
我就建一个自己的帝国
I'm gonna build my own.

546
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,450
你太牛了
Hell yeah.

547
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:08,800
尚气
Shang-Chi.

548
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:14,040
可以了
That's enough.

549
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:23,170
你最近有在练习英语吗?
Have you been practicing your English?

550
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,240
练了
Yes.

551
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,490
你一定要在强健身体的同时磨练自己的心智
You have to strengthen your mind along with your body.

552
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,060
如果你想拥有它们
If you want them to be yours one day,

553
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:47,390
就必须向我证明你足够强大
you have to show me you're strong enough to carry them.

554
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:03,880
你是怎么找到我的?
How did you find me?

555
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:07,090
我一直知道我的孩子在哪里
I always know where my children are.

556
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,010
我给了你十年时间让你去过自己的生活
I gave you 10 years to live your life,

557
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,010
你收获了什么呢?
and where did it get you?

558
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:18,390
是时候回到我身边了
Now it's time for you to take your place by my side.

559
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,550
不可能
That's not gonna happen.

560
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,020
美国妞
American girl.

561
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:28,270
她叫凯蒂
Her name is Katy.

562
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,860
那你的中文名字叫什么?
What is your Chinese name?

563
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,180
瑞文
Ruiwen.

564
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,790
名字是很神圣的 瑞文
Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

565
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:40,870
它联结的不仅是我们自身
They connect us not only to ourselves,

566
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,130
还有我们的先人
but to everyone who came before.

567
00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:45,960
有个很有趣的故事
A funny story.

568
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:48,510
几年前 一个美国的恐怖分子
Some years ago, a terrorist from America

569
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:50,090
需要一个坏蛋
needed a boogeyman

570
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,890
来摧毁你们的国家
to bring your country to its knees.

571
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,640
所以他盗用了十环这个名字
So, he appropriated The Ten Rings.

572
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,720
我的十环
My Ten Rings.

573
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,310
但是他不知道我的真名 就自己起了一个
But because he didn't know my actual name,

574
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,310
就自己起了一个
he invented a new one.

575
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:05,110
你们知道他最后起了个什么名字吗
Do you know the name he chose?

576
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,820
满大人（有"柑橘"义）
The Mandarin.

577
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,190
他给他的名号起了个水果名
He gave his figurehead the name of a chicken dish.

578
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,780
居然还很管用
And it worked.

579
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,450
整个美国都陷入恐慌
America was terrified.

580
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:16,170
只是因为一只"橘子"
Of an orange.

581
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,290
其实我这一生
The truth is,

582
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,870
有过很多名字
I've had many names throughout my life.

583
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,380
战王 可汗大师
The Warrior King, Master Khan,

584
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,840
地球上最危险的人
the most dangerous man on Earth.

585
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:34,720
有很长一段时间 我以为这就是我人生的意义
For years, I thought that was all I was meant to be.

586
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,350
但自从我遇到了他们的妈妈以后
But when I met their mother,

587
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,850
一切都变了
everything changed.

588
00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:00,740
她让我发现了新的自己
She showed me a part of myself I didn't know was there.

589
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,710
让我重新认识了这个世界
It was like I was seeing the world for the first time.

590
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:20,080
为了和我在一起 她抛下了一切
She gave up everything so we could be together.

591
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,320
而我也是一样
And so did I.

592
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,160
这是谁呀
You know who's in there?

593
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:42,830
你说 你好 妹妹
Say, "Hello, little sister!"

594
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,000
过了这么多年
After all those years,

595
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,750
我终于找到了
I finally found something

596
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,650
值得我为其变老的东西
worth growing old for.

597
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,280
我的真名叫文武
My real name is Wenwu.

598
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,850
她是唯一一个这么叫我的人
She was the only one who called me that.

599
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,480
在她离世以后
And when she died...

600
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,270
我迷失了很久
I was lost for many years.

601
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,320
但现在不会了
But I'm not lost any more.

602
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,910
当时你们两个离家出走
When you children ran away,

603
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,620
我迫切需要你们母亲灵魂的指引
I was so desperate to connect with your mother,

604
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,420
我全身心地投入到对她家乡的研究中
I threw myself back into the studies of her village.

605
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,050
传说中的塔罗
The legendary Ta Lo.

606
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,670
我没能找到
I wasn't able

607
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,090
通往村子入口的秘密路线
to find the secret path to the village entrance,

608
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,180
但我发现了他们到底在隐藏的东西
but I did find what they are hiding.

609
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,390
在那座大山的深处有一道门
There's a gate deep in their mountains.

610
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:49,240
你们的母亲就在那里等着我们
Your mother is waiting for us there.

611
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,860
我知道这很难接受
I know this is a lot.

612
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,530
如果不是她亲口告诉我 我也不敢相信
I might not have believed it if she didn't tell me herself.

613
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,650
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

614
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,160
当时我坐在这张椅子上
I was sitting right here in this seat,

615
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:04,050
全神贯注地做着研究
deep in my research...

616
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,040
然后她和我说话了
and she spoke to me.

617
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,000
就好像她真的在这个房间里一样
It was like she was standing in this room.

618
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,920
我能感受到她的呼吸拂过我的脸颊
I could feel her breath on my cheek

619
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,070
手掌抚在我的背上
and her hand on my back.

620
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:20,360
她告诉我 她需要我的帮助
She told me she needs my help.

621
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,880
怎么帮?
To do what?

622
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,100
从她族人的手中救出她
To save her from her people.

623
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,890
我们坠入爱河之后
After we fell in love,

624
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,770
你母亲希望我们定居塔罗
your mother wanted us to live in Ta Lo.

625
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,860
她请求长老们的允准
She asked permission from the elders,

626
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,190
长者们却拒绝了
and they refused.

627
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,610
他们说我不配
They said I wasn't worthy.

628
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,610
如果没有被拒绝
She would still be with us.

629
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,030
她就不会死 我们就会一起在那里生活
We would all be living there together.

630
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,800
是塔罗害了我们
Ta Lo did this to us.

631
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:54,820
他们把她关在那扇大门后面 以示惩罚
They locked her behind that gate to punish her.

632
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,440
你还没看出来吗
Don't you see?

633
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,050
她给我们留下了线索
She's leaving clues for us.

634
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,680
她希望我们找到她
She wants us to find her

635
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:05,300
带她回家 一家团圆
and bring her home, so we can be a family again.

636
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,410
爸 妈已经走了
Dad, Mom's gone.

637
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:11,350
她并没有在大门后和你对话
She's not talking to you from behind a gate,

638
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:16,590
她也没有给我们留下任何线索
and she's not leaving any clues for us.

639
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,620
那这些是什么?
Then what are these?

640
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,200
去塔罗的通道被移动的迷宫守卫着
The passage to Ta Lo is guarded by a moving maze.

641
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,420
但是森林中有一条直达的路径
But there's a direct path through the forest

642
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,670
一年仅开放一次
that only opens once a year

643
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,780
在清明节的时候
on Qingming Jie.

644
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:23,170
要想通过 只有知道路线
To get through, you need to know the route

645
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,850
和开放的具体时间
and the exact time it opens.

646
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,080
现在我都知道了
Now I know both.

647
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,570
三天之后
Three days from now,

648
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,030
我们会救出我的夫人
we will rescue my wife from her prison

649
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,320
带她回家
and bring her home.

650
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,500
这就是你来这里的理由
This is why you're here.

651
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,670
帮我把她带回我们身边
To help me bring her back to us.

652
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:04,590
如果他们不让你打开大门怎么办?
And what happens if they don't let you open the gate?

653
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,570
那我们就把村子夷为平地
We'll burn the village to the ground.

654
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,120
什么?
What?

655
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,140
你不能就这样带兵攻打母亲的村庄
You can't just march into our mom's village

656
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,980
这太荒唐了
with this bullshit.

657
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,860
你知不知道这有多疯狂...
I mean, do you have any idea how insane...

658
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,840
嘿
Hey!

659
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,810
你们要带我去哪儿?
Where are you taking me?

660
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:37,580
你还要装多久
When will you stop pretending?

661
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,000
把他们关起来
Lock them up.

662
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:03,240
没关系
It's okay, my dear.

663
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:13,330
咱们一家人很快就能在一起了
We're all going to be together soon.

664
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,210
所以说 咱就是说 有点迷惑了
So, um, pretty confused right now,

665
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,970
因为我一开始觉得
because, initially I thought your dad should

666
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,090
你爸有妄想症必须去看心理医生
definitely see a therapist for his delusions,

667
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,430
但之后那个龙头 像施了法一样 喷出来一幅水做的地图
but then that dragon vomited a magical water map,

668
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:41,150
所以我现在都不知道什么才是真的了
and now I have no idea what's real.

669
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,730
关于你母亲家乡的那些话是真的吗?
Is what he said about your mom's village true?

670
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:48,780
我们小的时候
She used to tell us stories about Ta Lo

671
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,820
她曾经讲过塔罗的故事
when we were kids.

672
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:55,120
那是处于另一个空间的村庄 到处都是奇幻生物
A village in another dimension full of magical creatures.

673
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,080
我之前只当作神话故事
I thought it was just a fairy tale.

674
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,710
但如果爸说的是真的呢?
What if Dad's right?

675
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,130
你是说如果妈真的
About Mom being locked behind a gate

676
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,250
被自己的族人关起来了?
by her own people?

677
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:09,720
比这更疯狂的事情都已经发生了
Crazier things have turned out to be true.

678
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,050
听我说 我不知道这一切都他妈是怎么回事
Look, I don't know what the hell is going on,

679
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,640
但如果我们不杀出去并在他之前找到塔罗
but if we don't find a way to get to Ta Lo before him,

680
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:19,350
他会把咱们家仅剩的都毁掉的
he's gonna destroy everything that's left of our family.

681
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:23,650
这个家很久之前就已经被毁了
This family was destroyed a long time ago.

682
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,280
什么鬼
The hell was that?

683
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,110
你们真的要朝那个声音的方向去?
You're going toward that noise?

684
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,760
「麦克白」"敲醒邓肯吧
"Wake Duncan with thy knocking.

685
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,890
但愿你能够如此
"I would'st though could'st.

686
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,560
不想我所为 我最好忘掉（自己）"
"My deed 'twere best not..."

687
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,680
你们好啊 小可爱们
Hello, loves.

688
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,630
现在是哪一年了?
What year is it?

689
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:11,030
你是谁?
Who are you?

690
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:13,270
特雷弗?斯莱特里?
Trevor? Slattery?

691
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:16,600
来自利物浦的演员?
The actor from Liverpool?

692
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,720
等等
Wait.

693
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:20,040
你们是那位掌权者的孩子吗?
Are you the governor's kids?

694
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,750
我一直在为你们的接风宴
I've been preparing a monologue

695
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,580
准备一场独白话剧
for your homecoming dinner.

696
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,620
她要去哪
Where's she going?

697
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,960
你为什么在这下面?
Why are you down here?

698
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,000
是这样 很久之前
Well, some time ago,

699
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,750
我接到一个恐怖分子的角色
I was offered the role of a terrorist.

700
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,170
我知道 这个剧情老套又无聊 我也这么觉得
I know, facile, trite, I couldn't agree more.

701
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,260
但是机不可失 失不再来 你知道吗
But times were lean, you know what I mean?

702
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,180
总之就是 制作人说他是BBC的
Anyway, the producer told me he worked for the BBC.

703
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,720
但是 讽刺的转折来了
But, ironic twist,

704
00:57:39,750 --> 00:57:42,470
结果 其实 他真的是个恐怖分子
it turns out he, in fact, was a terrorist,

705
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,140
我当时根本不是在扮演一个角色
and I wasn't playing a character at all,

706
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:45,520
我知道我说的话
but what I now recognise to be

707
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:47,900
你会觉得我在说你爸坏话
a rather unflattering portrait of your father.

708
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,820
我们都罪有应得
We all got our just deserts.

709
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,780
那个制片人被钢铁侠炸飞了
The producer got blown up by Iron Man,

710
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,610
我也在联邦监狱服了刑
and I served time in federal prison,

711
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,530
不过对我来说反而是个好事
which turned out to be the best thing for me.

712
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,120
我戒了毒 重拾了我热爱的表演
I got clean, I rediscovered my passion.

713
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:01,870
-然后我爸把你救出来了? -没错
-Then my dad broke you out? -Exactly.

714
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:04,710
-为了杀你 -没错
-To kill you. -Exactly.

715
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,120
但是 在他的手下
But just as his men

716
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,920
即将把我绑起来处死时
were tying me up for my execution,

717
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,880
我表演了一段《麦克白》
I launched into a performance of my Macbeth.

718
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,590
「麦克白」"哪来的敲门声?敲醒邓肯吧!
"Whence is that knocking? Wake Duncan

719
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,170
"但愿你能够如此!"
"with thy knocking. I would'st though could'st..."

720
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,510
他们简直百看不厌
They couldn't get enough of it.

721
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,090
从那以后 我就一直为他们表演
I've been doing weekly gigs for the lads ever since.

722
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,140
所以你是他的小丑?
So you're like his jester?

723
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,890
你想看的话 我给你模仿一下
I can give you a quick preview if you like.

724
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,310
"叔叔 叔叔 叔叔..."
"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..."

725
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,810
谢谢你 特雷弗 我觉得可以了
Thank you, Trevor. I think we're okay.

726
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,730
现在我们只想找到出去的路
Right now, we really just need to find a way to...

727
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,230
什么情况?
What the hell?

728
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:31,440
什么...
What the...!

729
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,570
-唔喔  -那是个什么玩意?
-Whoa! -What is that?

730
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,360
那是个什么玩意?
What's what?

731
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,490
-那个 那是个什么玩意?  -那个 那个 那个
-That! What is that? -That! That! That!

732
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,990
你们能看到莫里斯?
You can see Morris?

733
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,080
莫里斯?
Morris?

734
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,710
莫里斯
Morris!

735
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,410
他们看得到你 你真的存在
They can see you! You're real!

736
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,630
这么长时间以来 我以为他是我臆想出来的
All this time I thought I was hallucinating him.

737
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,210
真是太好了
This is such fab news.

738
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,300
他的脸在哪里?
Where's his face?

739
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:58,630
他对这个话题有点敏感
He's a bit sensitive about that.

740
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,970
哦 是么?
Really?

741
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,310
莫里斯说他知道你是谁
Morris says he knows who you are.

742
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:05,720
他...他会跟你说话?
It talks... It talks to you?

743
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,350
如果不是他和我说话
If he didn't talk to me,

744
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:10,560
我早就疯了
I'd have gone mad yonks ago.

745
00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:12,110
他是怎么认识我的?
How would he know me?

746
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:15,820
他说 在塔罗的时候 他和你母亲一起长大
He says he grew up with your mum. In Ta Lo.

747
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,070
你爸爸寻找入口的时候
Apparently, your father picked him up in some magic forest

748
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,870
在奇幻森林里捡到了他
on one of his expeditions to find the entrance.

749
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,120
他希望你能带他回家
He wants you to take him home.

750
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:32,380
相信我 朋友 如果我知道该怎么做 我一定会的
Believe me, buddy, I would if I knew how.

751
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,460
我爸说
According to my dad,

752
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:35,300
这条路一年只打开一次
the path there only opens once a year.

753
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,850
莫里斯说他现在就可以带你去
Morris says he can guide you there right now.

754
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,140
不用等那条路打开
You can get through the maze

755
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:47,890
他就能带你穿过迷宫
without waiting for the path to open.

756
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,060
但是 有一个很大的"但是"
But, and it's a big "but,"

757
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,270
此行非常危险
it's very dangerous.

758
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:53,440
有多危险?
How dangerous?

759
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,520
没有人能活着从那里面出来
No one's ever made it out alive.

760
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,490
但是莫里斯百分之九十确定
But Morris is 90% confident

761
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,320
他能够带我们安全地通过
he can guide us through safely.

762
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:03,020
百分之十九
19%.

763
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,620
我做过比这更蠢 风险更高的事情
Look, I've done dumber things with worse odds.

764
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:10,410
但是即使那个长得像鸡的猪说的是真的...
But even if that chicken-pig is right...

765
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,580
...我们仍然困在这里...
...we're still locked in your...

766
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:24,260
你是怎么...
How did you...

767
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,850
爸爸在整个院子下面造了隧道系统
Dad has a tunnel system under the whole compound.

768
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,770
我上一次就是这么逃跑的
That's how I escaped last time.

769
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,940
这里直接通向车库
This will take us straight to the garage.

770
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,620
哦我的天
My God.

771
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,280
这车真不错
I kinda like this guy.

772
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,290
下斜坡直走到大门
Just head up that ramp and through the front gate.

773
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:50,500
直接就到了
Should be a straight shot.

774
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:52,370
我们大概有三十秒的时间
Figure we got about 30 seconds until he...

775
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,540
介意我坐前排吗
Do you mind?

776
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,580
我坐后排会有点晕 晕车
I get sick in the back. Carsick.

777
01:00:58,740 --> 01:00:59,960
那是我的车啊
That's my car!

778
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:06,640
该死
God damn it.

779
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,700
抓紧了
Hold on.

780
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,390
还有其他出口吗
Is there another exit?

781
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:11,810
在车库的另一头
The other end of the garage.

782
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:16,790
但是是指纹解锁开门的
But we need a fingerprint to open it.

783
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:21,310
小心
Incoming!

784
01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,280
靠
Shit!

785
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,640
后面怎么样
What's happening back there?

786
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,850
我在尽力
Doing my best.

787
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:51,720
请扫描掌纹解锁开门
Scan hand print for gate access.

788
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:56,310
-快点  -我正在
- Hurry up! - I'm trying!

789
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,520
请扫描掌纹解锁开门
Scan hand print for gate access.

790
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,590
尚恩
Shaun!

791
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,800
已解锁
Access approved.

792
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:24,260
只要我带她回家 他们肯定会回来
They will come back once I bring her home.

793
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,010
准备人手 随时应战
Prepare the men for war.

794
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,210
是 长官
Yes, sir.

795
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,940
我第一次看到纯粹的艺术
The first time I witnessed pure artistry.

796
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,220
是在1968年看《人猿星球》的时候
1968. Planet of the Apes.

797
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,940
我和母亲坐在电影院里
I was sitting in the cinema next to my mum,

798
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:44,570
聚精会神地
watching mastery

799
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,610
观看那部杰作
unfold before my very eyes.

800
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,910
看完之后 我问她
After the film, I asked her,

801
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:51,490
他们是怎么让猴子做这些事的
"How did they get those monkeys to do those things?"

802
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:54,450
她拍了拍我的头 说
And she patted me on the head and she said,

803
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,500
那都是假的 只是表演而已
"It's not real, pet. It's just acting."

804
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,000
从那时起我就觉得
That's when I knew.

805
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:01,790
如果他们可以教那些猴子
If they can teach those monkeys

806
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,380
表演得出神入化
to act that brilliantly,

807
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,220
这么想想 我可以为这个世界带来什么
just imagine what I could bring to the world.

808
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,510
所以你成为了一名演员
So you became an actor

809
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:11,600
因为你以为那些猴子真的
because you thought the monkeys were actually...

810
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,430
我以为它们真的在骑马 是的
Riding horses? I did. Yes.

811
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,100
但实际上
When, in fact,

812
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,350
它们只是在表演而已 演得好像它们真的在骑马一样
they were simply acting as if they were riding horses.

813
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,610
不过说实话我到现在都没整明白是怎么做到的
I still can't get my head round it, to be honest.

814
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:24,940
真有你的 兄弟
Good for you, dude.

815
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:28,570
你找到了你的热爱所在
You found your passion and went for it,

816
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,740
为它付出
and eventually used it

817
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,950
并凭一己之力削弱了美国政府 但不管怎样
to cripple the US government, but whatever.

818
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:33,990
啊 是的 谢谢啊
Yeah. No, yeah, thanks.

819
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:36,080
真不错
Um, this is really cool and all,

820
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:37,700
但我们还要在这里坐多久
but how long do we have to sit here?

821
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,750
莫里斯非常清楚
Morris is very clear.

822
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:42,130
万事俱备 只欠东风
The way through is all about timing.

823
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:44,000
好的 但我们还要在这聊多久
Okay, but how long are we talking?

824
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,880
几个小时?还是几天?
Like, hours? Days?

825
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,590
朋友们 我只是个临时容器而已
Friends, I am but a transitory vessel

826
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:50,180
用来承载生命无穷的智慧
for the infinite wisdom of a creature

827
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,050
这无穷智慧远比我们可以理解的先进得多
far more advanced than we'll ever truly understand.

828
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,760
他在这个广袤未知的宇宙里
What he sees, what he feels

829
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,640
看到的 感受到的东西
of this vast, unknown universe

830
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,640
是我们简单的头脑无法容纳的
is beyond anything our simple brains can...

831
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:00,480
可以动身了
You can go.

832
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:01,550
什么
What?

833
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:05,410
出发 它说你们可以出发了
Go. You can go. He says "go."

834
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,760
你应该开快点
You should speed up.

835
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:30,080
啊 为什么
What? Why?

836
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:33,220
凯蒂 快 开快点 快
Katy, go, go, go!

837
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,310
莫里斯说
Morris says,

838
01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:40,350
-三秒钟后方向盘向右打死  -啥
-"Hard right on three." -What?

839
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,440
二
Two...

840
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:42,520
哪里开始右转啊
Hard right where?

841
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,280
现在
Now.

842
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,530
然后左转
And left.

843
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:58,620
这一切都是为了留在口袋里
It's all about staying in the pocket.

844
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,450
-什么口袋  -我们现在就在这里面
-What pocket? -We're in it now.

845
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,290
要是我们没留在这里会怎么样
What happens if we don't stay in the pocket?

846
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:03,460
那样森林就会吃了我们
The forest eats us.

847
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,080
吃了我们 什么意思
Eats us? What does that mean?

848
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:08,890
它说的就是森林会吃了我们 左转
He says it eats us. Go left.

849
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:17,050
-小心后面  -待在口袋里
- Watch your back! - Stay in the pocket.

850
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,810
-还有多远?  -五米
- How close is it? - Five metres.

851
01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:20,720
-待在口袋里  -五米是多少尺
- Stay in the pocket. - What is that in feet?

852
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:21,890
超他妈近了
Really fricking close.

853
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,060
待在口袋里
Stay in the pocket.

854
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,690
你能不能别说待在口袋里了
Will you just stop saying, "Stay in the pocket"?

855
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:33,900
最后一次转向 马上就要结束了
One last right, then straight on to the end.

856
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,870
你最好快一点
You might wanna hurry up.

857
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,330
不然你以为我在逛街吗
What do you think I'm doing?

858
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:49,490
要来不及了
We're not gonna make it.

859
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,210
我马上回"家"见你 妈妈
I'm coming home, Mummy.

860
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,810
莫里斯说 "干得漂亮 各位"
Morris says, "Great job, everyone."

861
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,860
现在我们只要穿过瀑布
Now, all we have to do is go through that waterfall,

862
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,990
就到了
and we're pretty much there.

863
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:05,200
妈的
Bloody hell.

864
01:07:05,230 --> 01:07:07,040
这些鸟是着火了吧
I think those birds are on fire.

865
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,710
真的诶
Really?.

866
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:12,090
莫里斯说这很正常
Morris says it's normal.

867
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:14,510
他们是他旧时的伙伴
They're old mates of his.

868
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,090
这马长的真别致
That's a weird horse.

869
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,430
它为什么看着我?
What's it looking at me for?

870
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,400
大家好
Hi there!

871
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,770
我是徐尚气
I am Xu Shang-Chi.

872
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:04,910
这是我妹妹 徐夏灵
This is my sister, Xu Xialing.

873
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:08,190
我们是映丽的孩子
We're Ying Li's children.

874
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,000
这是我的朋友凯蒂
This is my friend, Katy.

875
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:16,670
上车 哪来的回哪去
Get in your car and go home!

876
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,920
你误会了 请听我们说
Please. You don't understand.

877
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,720
唔喔
Whoa.

878
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,920
光伯
Guang Bo!

879
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,020
这是在干什么?
What are you doing?

880
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:34,200
放下你们的武器
Put down your weapons!

881
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,770
尚气
Shang-Chi.

882
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:39,630
夏灵
Xialing.

883
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,360
我是你们的小姨 映南
I'm your aunty Nan.

884
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:49,060
终于见到你了
I've waited so long to meet you.

885
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,660
像你妈妈
You look like your mother.

886
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:08,050
你好 我是凯蒂
Hi, I'm Katy.

887
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,510
欢迎来到塔罗 凯蒂
Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

888
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,360
谢谢
Thank you.

889
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,070
看看谁回来了
Look who has found his way home!

890
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:21,480
我人畜无害
I'm not a threat.

891
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:23,780
就是个杂耍的
Just an entertainer.

892
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,930
莫里斯可以替我担保
Morris can vouch for me.

893
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,160
我们没多少时间了
We don't have much time.

894
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,580
父亲就要来了
Our father is coming.

895
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:41,710
我们已经在这里待了四千年
Our people have been here for over 4,000 years,

896
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:44,670
来准备应对一些我们永远不希望发生的事情
preparing for something we hope will never happen.

897
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:47,380
我们是黑暗之门的守卫者
We are the keepers of the Dark Gate,

898
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:49,850
誓死保卫这片土地和你们的家园
sworn to protect this realm and yours

899
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:53,270
不受到困在门后的恶魔的伤害
from the evil that's locked behind it.

900
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,020
我们的父亲就是来打开那扇门的
Our dad is coming here to open that gate.

901
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,310
他认为你们把我们的妈妈关在那里
He thinks you're holding our mom there.

902
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,980
他怎么会这么想
Why would he think that?

903
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:02,360
妈妈告诉他的
She told him.

904
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:06,820
他说他能听到妈妈在向他求救
He says he can hear her asking for help.

905
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:08,990
他一直戴着十环吗
Is he wearing the rings?

906
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:13,040
自从妈妈死后他从来没有取下来过
He hasn't taken them off since she died.

907
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:18,140
十环和这一切有什么关系
What do they have to do with all this?

908
01:11:18,610 --> 01:11:20,750
塔罗的领土一直延伸到
The realm of Ta Lo stretches far beyond

909
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,790
我们小村庄的海岸线之外
the shores of our small village.

910
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:26,630
我们的城市胜过你们宇宙中的任何一座城市
We have cities that surpass any in your universe,

911
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,510
孕育着非常丰富的文化和历史
rich with culture and history.

912
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:31,680
几千年前
Thousands of years ago,

913
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:36,020
所有族人都过着和平繁荣的日子
all of our people lived in peace and prosperity,

914
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:39,770
直到遭受黑暗居民的袭击
until the attack of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

915
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,270
他带领他的军队
He came with his army,

916
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:44,480
吞噬了他们沿途经过的每一个灵魂
devouring every soul in their path,

917
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:48,820
每一次杀戮都使他们更为强大
and with each kill, they grew stronger.

918
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:51,530
在摧毁我们最大的城市之后
After decimating our largest cities,

919
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:55,120
他们又进军到你们的宇宙再次进行屠杀
they were headed to your universe to do the same.

920
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,660
塔罗的领袖派出了最强大的一批战士
The leaders of Ta Lo sent their strongest warriors here

921
01:11:58,690 --> 01:12:02,460
去阻止他们到达通往你们世界的传送门
to stop them from reaching the portal to your world.

922
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:06,710
但是我们的祖先不是他们的对手
But our ancestors were no match for them.

923
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:09,840
直到守护者加入了这场战争
Until The Great Protector

924
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:14,100
并且扭转了局势
joined their fight and turned the tide.

925
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:17,180
他们共同奋力将黑暗居民军队
Together, they pushed the Dweller and his army

926
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:18,560
打进了黑暗之门
into the Dark Gate

927
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:21,970
并且将他们锁在了里面
and locked it behind them.

928
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,570
从那之后我们的族人就一直守卫着这道门
Our people have guarded that gate ever since,

929
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:30,200
守护者的魔力赋予了我们力量
empowered by the magic of The Great Protector

930
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:34,130
以及她送给我们的礼物
and the gift that she gave us.

931
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:45,290
龙鳞
Dragon scales.

932
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,320
能够做出上成盔甲
Makes very good armour.

933
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,220
在你父亲之前有很多人来到这
Your father isn't the first to come here

934
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:53,050
想要打开黑暗之门
to open the Dark Gate.

935
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:55,470
几个世纪以来这些人不断尝试又不断失败
Many have tried and failed over the centuries,

936
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,970
他们都有一个共同点
and they all had one thing in common.

937
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,060
他们都被另一个世界的
They were lured here

938
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:01,980
某种声音吸引着
by the voice of something on the other side.

939
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,320
一种承诺满足他们最强欲望的声音
A voice that promised them their greatest desires.

940
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:12,280
所以你认为是噬魂者在和我们的父亲交谈?
So you think soul eaters are talking to our dad?

941
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:18,870
他们知道十环有能力让他们重获自由
They know The Ten Rings have the power to break them free.

942
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,170
给你
Here you go.

943
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:29,590
去射箭场
To the range.

944
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:32,380
啥? 好吧
What? Okay.

945
01:13:32,410 --> 01:13:35,260
呃 看来我要送些龙箭过去了
Um, looks like I'm gonna go deliver some dragon arrows.

946
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:36,760
你要送这些龙箭过去?
You're gonna deliver some dragon arrows?

947
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,220
嗯 我也得干点事
Yeah. Make myself useful, you know.

948
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:39,550
谢谢
Thank you.

949
01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:44,550
去看看你母亲吧
Let's go see your mother.

950
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,450
好羡慕你们知道自己想要做什么
I just love how you guys know exactly what you wanna do,

951
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,410
然后用一生的时间来精通它
and you spend your whole life getting really good at it.

952
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,170
我希望也能和你们一样
I wish I was more like that.

953
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,420
但是好像每次我稍微擅长一些事情
It's like every time I get moderately good at something,

954
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,840
我就会半途而废 然后尝试新的事物
I just quit and start something new.

955
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:11,920
我知道自己的极限
But I just know my own limits,

956
01:14:11,950 --> 01:14:14,630
所以我不会浪费时间去追求一些
and I'm not gonna waste my time chasing something

957
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,550
最终会让我失望的事情
that will ultimately be a disappointment for me.

958
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,680
那不是我
That's not me.

959
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,880
光伯
Guang Bo.

960
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:22,240
让她试试
Let her shoot.

961
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:30,340
如果你心中没有靶子 就是无的放矢
If you aim at nothing, you hit nothing.

962
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,550
你们曾经是她的一切
You were everything to her.

963
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:58,180
她知道你们总有一天会到这里来找她
She knew that one day you would find your way here

964
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:04,980
所以她让我为你们的到来做了准备
and asked me to prepare something for your arrival.

965
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,500
失去她这样优秀的人之后
After losing someone like her,

966
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:28,790
很容易会觉得活着很孤独
it's easy to feel alone in this world.

967
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:30,630
但你们没有
But you're not.

968
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:33,460
你们是这个家的子女
You are children of this family,

969
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:36,490
我欢迎你们回家
and I welcome you home.

970
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:07,040
这里不是你父亲家
You're not in your father's house any more.

971
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:10,840
在塔罗 每个人都可以练武
In Ta Lo, we train as equals.

972
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:19,460
是时候从影子里走出来了 孩子
You've been in the shadows long enough, my child.

973
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,150
光伯 你看到了吗
Guang Bo, you saw that?

974
01:16:38,180 --> 01:16:40,130
我射得相当不错吧
That was tight!

975
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,380
我母亲是唯一一个可以打败我父亲的人
My mother was the only one who could beat him.

976
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,400
告诉我她是如何做到的
Show me how she did it.

977
01:17:05,450 --> 01:17:07,100
不 停一下
No, sorry.

978
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,250
抱歉 越位了 越位了
Sorry. Offside, offside.

979
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:12,370
你妈妈知道她自己是谁
Your mother knew who she was.

980
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,440
你知道自己是谁吗
Do you?

981
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:23,570
你是所有前人的产物
You are a product of all who came before you.

982
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:28,200
你是家族的遗产 无论好的坏的
The legacy of your family, the good and the bad,

983
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:32,080
都是构成你的一部分
it is all a part of who you are.

984
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,540
别再逃避了 外甥
Stop hiding, nephew.

985
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:41,250
这样只会让你沉湎于痛苦
It only prolongs the pain.

986
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:17,820
我们很快就能团聚了
We'll be together soon.

987
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,960
先生
Sir.

988
01:20:24,990 --> 01:20:27,330
人手准备好了
The men are ready.

989
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:30,260
通道将在黎明时打开
The passage will open at dawn.

990
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:35,370
我会准备好车
I'll prepare the vehicles.

991
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,450
以心行气
Lead with your breath.

992
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,220
以气运身
Look into your heart,

993
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:04,600
要先掌握阴阳的转换
the light and the dark.

994
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:07,330
你才能找到内心的平衡
To know yourself,

995
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,490
从而真正认识自己
you must face them both.

996
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:30,860
你丈夫想灭了我了我的门
Your husband tried to destroy us.

997
01:21:30,890 --> 01:21:34,160
我们今天是来回礼的
The Iron Gang is here to repay that debt.

998
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:36,870
他已经不是以前的那个人了
My husband is not the man he used to be.

999
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:39,490
那我不管
It doesn't matter.

1000
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:45,670
你们之间的事情跟我的孩子们无关
Your business with him has nothing to do with my children.

1001
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:47,260
放了他们可以
They can go,

1002
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:50,730
但这个礼 必须得有人来接吧
but someone has to pay.

1003
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,180
灵灵 尚气
Xialing. Shang-Chi.

1004
01:21:58,210 --> 01:21:59,310
进屋去
Go inside.

1005
01:21:59,330 --> 01:22:03,500
我跟客人有话要说
I'm going to talk to our guests.

1006
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:12,170
可你现在没有魔法了呀
But you don't have your powers.

1007
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:18,370
尚气 别怕
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

1008
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:40,840
妈妈
Mama.

1009
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:42,850
Mama.

1010
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,540
爸爸
Papa.

1011
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:15,520
她说我是可以改变的
She told me I could change.

1012
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:19,860
我也可以放下以前
That I could leave my past behind.

1013
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:24,570
可是她错了
But she was wrong.

1014
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:31,460
如果我当初没有把它们摘下来
If I hadn't taken them off,

1015
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:36,960
那些混蛋根本就不敢动手
those men wouldn't have dared to do this.

1016
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:40,720
我要他们付出代价
And now they will pay for it.

1017
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:36,570
你老板呢
Where's your boss?

1018
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:37,980
我不知道
I don't know!

1019
01:25:38,010 --> 01:25:39,940
我真的不知道
I swear I don't!

1020
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:42,220
那好
Okay.

1021
01:25:56,110 --> 01:26:01,060
血债必须要血偿
A blood debt has to be paid by blood.

1022
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,910
你愿意帮爸爸吗
Will you help me?

1023
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,710
我们找到
We found the man

1024
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:38,000
害死你母亲的人了
responsible for killing your mother.

1025
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:42,210
你有权为我们两个人了结这件事
It is your right to finish this for both of us.

1026
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,010
你回来以后
And when you return,

1027
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:50,680
他们会像以前一样对十环卑躬屈膝
we will rebuild The Ten Rings to what it once was.

1028
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,230
我到处找你
Been looking everywhere for ya.

1029
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:19,780
你还好吗
You okay?

1030
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,720
我和你所想象的不一样
I'm not who you think I am.

1031
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,720
你已经道过歉了
You already apologised for that. We're good...

1032
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:33,970
我不是在说那个
That's not what I'm talking about.

1033
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,040
好
Okay.

1034
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:39,270
你...想说什么
What... What is it?

1035
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:51,610
当时我爸爸让我去找杀害我妈妈的人
When my dad sent me to find the man who killed my mom...

1036
01:27:51,730 --> 01:27:57,200
我之前说我下不了手
I told you I couldn't go through with it.

1037
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:00,030
我撒谎了
I lied.

1038
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,170
我以为我可以改名
I thought that I could change my name,

1039
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,260
然后开始新的生活 假装那些事都没发生过
start a new life, pretend like it never happened.

1040
01:28:10,290 --> 01:28:11,330
但...
But...

1041
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:23,500
她一定会讨厌现在的我
She would hate the person I've become.

1042
01:28:27,390 --> 01:28:29,660
你七岁的时候
Your dad trained you to be an assassin

1043
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,290
你爸就开始训练你成为一名杀手
when you were seven.

1044
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,870
你十四岁的时候 他让你去杀人
He sent you on a hit at 14.

1045
01:28:37,900 --> 01:28:43,370
你也知道这很荒谬 对吧
You realise how messed up that is, right?

1046
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:47,810
我妈妈被害死 都是因为他
My mom is dead because of him.

1047
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:54,710
现在他还要毁了她的家乡
And now he's coming to destroy her home.

1048
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:07,650
血债必须要血偿
A blood debt has to be paid by blood.

1049
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:12,110
你在说什么
What are you saying?

1050
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:18,060
我要用他教我的本领
I'm gonna do what he trained me to do.

1051
01:29:21,190 --> 01:29:22,790
亲手杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

1052
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:11,500
他来了
He's here.

1053
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:24,590
不行
No!

1054
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:26,020
你还没准备好
You're not ready.

1055
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:28,000
她留下
She stays here.

1056
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,450
你居然要帮
Are you here to help the people

1057
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:26,330
监禁你母亲的人
holding your own mother captive?

1058
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,290
她不在那
She isn't back there.

1059
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,380
那个怪物在骗你
You're being lied to

1060
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:33,010
它想毁灭我们所有人
by a creature who wants to destroy us all.

1061
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:35,670
他们是这么跟你说的吗
Is that what they told you?

1062
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:38,510
我清楚我妻子的声音
I know my wife's voice.

1063
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:41,220
她是我姐姐 我和你一样想念她
I miss my sister as much as you do,

1064
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:43,970
但用这种方式来纪念她 是不对的
but this is not the way to honour her memory.

1065
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,850
你们纪念她的方式
Did you honour her when you turned her away

1066
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:46,980
就是把她关在那扇门后面吗?
from your gate?

1067
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,650
混账 我们拒绝的人是你
You fool. We turned you away.

1068
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,520
你过去所造的孽 会毁了这个地方
The sins of your past would have destroyed this place.

1069
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:57,240
小子 跟我讲话礼貌点
Be careful how you speak to me, young man.

1070
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:01,560
我吃的盐比你吃的饭还要多
I've lived ten of your lifetimes.

1071
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,540
让我过去
Let me pass.

1072
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:06,910
不行
We cannot do that.

1073
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,280
把这儿烧了
Burn it down.

1074
01:33:30,690 --> 01:33:31,860
拦住他!
Stop him!

1075
01:34:07,430 --> 01:34:13,300
你难道打算仅凭一己之力阻止我?
Are you planning to stop me all by yourself?

1076
01:34:14,780 --> 01:34:17,640
我不怕你
I'm not afraid of you.

1077
01:34:23,490 --> 01:34:25,190
不 你怕得很
Yes, you are.

1078
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:33,890
你这一生都在恐惧中度过
You've spent your entire life afraid.

1079
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:35,870
抱头逃窜
Always running,

1080
01:34:36,130 --> 01:34:37,950
东躲西藏
always hiding.

1081
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:54,960
他们找上她的时候 你就在旁边
You were there when they came for her,

1082
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:57,590
但你什么都没做
and you did nothing.

1083
01:34:57,730 --> 01:35:03,340
光站在窗边 眼睁睁看着她死
You stood at a window and watched her die!

1084
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:38,330
妈妈不在了 我们需要你
She was gone and we needed you.

1085
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,630
但是你眼里只有那破臂环
But you chose those damn rings over us.

1086
01:35:45,660 --> 01:35:48,340
把自己的儿子训练成了杀手
You trained your son to be a killer.

1087
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:49,970
你满意了吗?
Is this what you wanted?

1088
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:10,320
就算你能带她回来
Even if you could bring her back,

1089
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:16,040
你凭什么觉得 她还愿意和你扯上关系?
what makes you think she'd want anything to do with you?

1090
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:41,270
来救我
Save me.

1091
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,510
快来救我
Save me, my dear.

1092
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:04,490
救我
Save me.

1093
01:37:05,780 --> 01:37:08,390
我们回家了
I'm coming, my love.

1094
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:54,340
他在破坏门
He breached the gate!

1095
01:37:55,450 --> 01:37:56,720
不合作的话
Those things are gonna kill us all

1096
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:58,470
我们都会命丧食魂怪之手
if we don't work together.

1097
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,680
你难道我会信你的鬼话?
You think I'm going to fall for that?

1098
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:03,310
你们的武器对付不了它们
Your weapons are useless against them.

1099
01:38:03,340 --> 01:38:05,480
我们不需要你们的帮助
We don't need your help.

1100
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:07,820
我们可是无所不能的十环帮
We are the mighty Ten Rings,

1101
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,270
才不需要...
and any...

1102
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,680
我们...还是合作吧
We... We should work together.

1103
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,400
放了他们
Release them.

1104
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:40,610
都解开
Release them!

1105
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,860
他们在做什么?
What are they doing?

1106
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,440
把吸取的灵魂带回给门后还没出来的家伙
Stealing souls to feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.

1107
01:38:50,470 --> 01:38:51,900
等他积攒够了力量
If it grows strong enough,

1108
01:38:51,930 --> 01:38:53,490
就会直接冲破大门
it will break right through the gate.

1109
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:55,530
那还只是开始
That was just the beginning.

1110
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:59,830
太危险了
It's too dangerous.

1111
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:05,070
我要帮我的朋友
I have to help my friends.

1112
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:08,460
活着回来
Don't die.

1113
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:11,300
所有人马上到湖边集合 快
Everyone to the water now!

1114
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:12,590
到湖边 快走
To the lake! Let's go!

1115
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:13,790
快走
Let's go!

1116
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:18,140
嘿 你哥哥在哪
Hey, where's your brother?

1117
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:21,030
我还指望你知道
I was hoping you knew.

1118
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:30,020
救我
Save me.

1119
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,360
齐天共战 誓死如归
Aim at the sky, to win or die!

1120
01:40:10,010 --> 01:40:11,570
深吸一口气
Deep breath.

1121
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:31,040
尚气 别怕
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

1122
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:34,000
你有神龙之心
You have the heart of our dragon.

1123
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:37,970
你是妈妈是血脉 也是爸爸的
I will always be a part of you. And your dad will too.

1124
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:42,180
你要把我们给你的一切化成你自己的力量
Take everything we've given you and make it your own.

1125
01:40:59,390 --> 01:41:01,990
你是妈妈的骄傲
I'm so proud of you.

1126
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,720
我们的家需要你
Our family needs you.

1127
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:10,860
去吧
Go.

1128
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,000
开弓
Draw.

1129
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:11,710
放箭
Fire!

1130
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,380
你得阻止你父亲
You have to stop your father!

1131
01:43:12,440 --> 01:43:15,830
她不在那里 爸爸
She's not back there, Dad.

1132
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:19,020
别碍事 孩子
Get out of my way, boy.

1133
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:22,160
不
No.

1134
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:27,320
哥们 冷静
Calm down, mate.

1135
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:28,950
我没死 是装的
I'm not dead, it's just a performance.

1136
01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:31,530
配合一下
Now get down here and play along.

1137
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,450
我得救她
I have to save her.

1138
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:20,040
她在呼唤我
She's calling to me.

1139
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:25,680
我也希望是真的
I wish that were true.

1140
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:29,090
爸爸 求求你
Dad, please.

1141
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:34,310
你的家人需要你
Your family needs you.

1142
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:44,520
放我出去
Let me out!

1143
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,340
靠
Shit.

1144
01:49:58,340 --> 01:49:59,700
它朝着村子去了
It's headed for the village!

1145
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:51,770
如果神龙的灵魂被吞掉了
If it gets our dragon's soul,

1146
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:53,980
就什么都阻止不了他了
it will be unstoppable!

1147
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:59,440
对准它的喉咙
Aim for the throat!

1148
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,670
放手吧
You have to let me go.

1149
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:56,900
放手
Let go!

1150
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:04,530
我不会再离开你
I'm not leaving you again.

1151
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:20,640
妈的牛逼
Holy shit.

1152
01:53:52,790 --> 01:53:55,000
去吧
Go.

1153
01:56:02,710 --> 01:56:03,890
今晚
Tonight,

1154
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:05,730
我们缅怀那些为了我们
we honour those who gave their lives

1155
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:09,060
而牺牲自己的人们
so we might see another day.

1156
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:11,860
他们不仅是战士
They were more than warriors.

1157
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:15,450
他们也曾为人父母
They were our mothers and fathers,

1158
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:18,730
是我们的兄弟姐妹
our sisters and brothers.

1159
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:24,290
我们会永远记得他们
And though we will always hold on to their memories,

1160
01:56:24,310 --> 01:56:28,920
今晚 他们要和祖先重聚了
tonight we release them to rest with our ancestors.

1161
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:38,340
爸 走好
Farewell, Dad.

1162
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:42,020
妈妈 放心吧
Mum, we'll be okay.

1163
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:44,600
千年以前
A thousand years ago,

1164
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:47,690
千年以后
and a thousand years from now,

1165
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:51,230
他们会永远在一起
we will always be together.

1166
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,730
我真的以为我们会死
I seriously thought we were going to die.

1167
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:36,190
我才刚学会射箭
And I'd only learned how to shoot a bow,

1168
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:37,610
不到一天
like, a day earlier,

1169
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:38,820
现在我和尚恩的小姨一起
now I'm on a battlefield,

1170
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:41,280
在战场上杀吸灵魂的怪物
killing all these Soul Suckers with Shaun's aunty,

1171
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:43,660
肖恩的小姨简直就是狂霸酷炫的功夫女神
who's this awesome, magical kung fu goddess.

1172
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:45,160
我当时正跟守护者
And I'm hanging on to The Great Protector

1173
01:57:45,190 --> 01:57:46,250
和我妹妹一起
with my sister at this point,

1174
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:48,410
奋力抵抗巨大的噬魂者
trying not to get eaten by the Mega Soul Sucker.

1175
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,870
那玩意儿真不是个东西
The Mega Soul Sucker was such a nasty bitch.

1176
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:52,460
就是 它还想吸了我们神龙的魂
Yeah. It was trying to eat our dragon's soul.

1177
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:53,540
一旦被它吸走
Which would have allowed it

1178
01:57:53,570 --> 01:57:54,670
得到的力量就足以毁灭整个世界
to destroy the entire universe.

1179
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:55,750
是啊
Yeah.

1180
01:57:55,780 --> 01:57:57,010
我当时只剩一支箭了
I only had one arrow left,

1181
01:57:57,030 --> 01:57:59,050
我只能听到脑海里
and all I could hear in the back of my mind

1182
01:57:59,070 --> 01:58:00,680
我妈妈的声音响起
was my mom's voice saying,

1183
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:03,050
"给我一箭中的 妈妈的小机灵鬼"
"Just take the shot, you little mooch!"

1184
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:05,640
我就直接瞄准噬魂者的喉咙
And so, I aimed right for the Sucker's throat

1185
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,890
-让龙箭飞  -她真的一箭中的
-and I let her fly. -She hit it dead on.

1186
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:09,310
接着尚恩用十环
And then Shaun used the Ten Rings

1187
01:58:09,330 --> 01:58:12,060
搞出一个像龟派气功一样的大火球
to do this crazy Kamehameha fireball

1188
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:13,690
把那玩意儿炸了
that exploded the thing...

1189
01:58:13,710 --> 01:58:16,940
于是他就拯救了世界
...and he saved the world.

1190
01:58:16,970 --> 01:58:21,950
唉 好多人牺牲了
Yeah, we, lost some good people that day...

1191
01:58:21,970 --> 01:58:23,780
但是我们成功了
but we made it.

1192
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:25,240
没错 我们做到了
We made it.

1193
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:28,540
你们有完没完 还要嘲讽我到什么时候
Are you done mocking me?

1194
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,540
啊 没有啊 我们可没嘲讽你
No. We're not mocking you.

1195
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,080
所以你那个妹妹 哪去了
So where is this sister of yours?

1196
01:58:32,110 --> 01:58:34,080
回我爸爸的帮派了
She's back at my dad's compound,

1197
01:58:34,110 --> 01:58:35,420
她要彻底解散那里
shutting down his operations.

1198
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:37,090
对啊 他爸爸是
Yeah, his dad was the head of The Ten Rings

1199
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:40,130
存在了几千年的十环帮的首领
for the past thousand years.

1200
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:42,340
两周之前 你们还在靠停车赚小费
Two weeks ago, you were parking cars for tips,

1201
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:44,800
现在你想让我相信 你打败了噬魂兽
and you want me to believe you're now saving the world

1202
01:58:44,830 --> 01:58:47,260
拯救了世界?
from soul-sucking monsters?

1203
01:58:47,290 --> 01:58:48,600
我懂了 你们是想为上回的事找补
I know, you're trying to get me back

1204
01:58:48,620 --> 01:58:50,350
但我并不打算为我的言论道歉
for what I said last time, but I'm not gonna apologise...

1205
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:52,940
因为我拿你们当朋友才会这么说的
...for speaking the truth as a friend.

1206
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:55,730
我说真的
I really meant what I said, and, in fact, I actually think

1207
01:58:55,760 --> 01:58:58,230
甚至觉得你们说的更加佐证了我的看法
this whole bit you're doing just further proves my point.

1208
01:58:58,260 --> 01:58:59,440
你们俩显然是...
You guys are obviously...

1209
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:03,810
-干嘛  -尚气
- What? - Shang-Chi.

1210
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:06,360
尚气
Shang-Chi.

1211
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:08,870
这儿
Here.

1212
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:10,190
到
Present.

1213
01:59:13,860 --> 01:59:15,940
我是王
My name is Wong.

1214
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:18,550
啊 我知道 先生 我是你铁杆粉丝...
Yeah, I know, sir. I'm a huge fan...

1215
01:59:18,570 --> 01:59:21,440
你真的拥有十环吗
Do you have the rings?

1216
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:23,130
嗯 对啊
Yeah, yes.

1217
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,600
好 跟我走 我跟你还有很多话要说
Good. Let's go, we have a lot to talk about.

1218
01:59:26,620 --> 01:59:27,660
还有你
You too.

1219
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,540
还有我的份?
Me too?

1220
01:59:34,710 --> 01:59:36,730
-我觉得咱们应该... -哦 对 没错
- I think we should... - Yeah.

1221
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:40,320
-咱得走了 -走着
- We gotta go. - Yeah.

1222
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:43,900
我懂 这事太难以接受了 之后跟你发短信解释
I know this is, like, crazy, but I'm gonna text you,

1223
01:59:43,930 --> 01:59:46,950
如果有机会的话 很高兴见到你 约翰
and we'll do this again. Nice to see you, John.

1224
01:59:46,970 --> 01:59:50,230
之后给你们转账...
I'll Venmo you for the...

1225
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:09,890
独立日你开着敞篷车兜风
You was crusin' with your top down Fourth of July

1226
02:00:09,910 --> 02:00:12,850
我开着车 我们在红绿灯前停下
I was movin' down the block We got caught at the light

1227
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:17,230
我想追求你
Out my window I was shooting my shot

1228
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:20,150
看着天上的烟火
Watching fireworks in the sky

1229
02:00:20,170 --> 02:00:23,320
就是你了 就是你了
I'm calling it now I'm calling it now

1230
02:00:23,340 --> 02:00:24,820
我爱上了你

就是你了
Yes, somehow I'm calling it now

1233
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:34,410
夏天我们开着敞篷车 享受阳光
In the summers we let the top down Soak up the light

1234
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:37,500
我只想锁定我今生所爱
All I wanted was just to lock down the love of my life

1235
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:41,500
像午夜兜风一样简单美好
Nice and simple like a midnight drive

1236
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:44,590
看着天上的烟火
Watching fireworks in the sky

1237

1242
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:09,070
描绘你的每词每句
Every line, every word every noun and verb can define you

1243
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:11,040
哦 哦 哦
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1244
02:01:13,890 --> 02:01:16,580
你很害羞但让我停车
You were shy but you told me to pull over

1245
02:01:16,610 --> 02:01:19,750
我在你身后
And now I'm right behind you

1246
02:01:19,780 --> 02:01:23,090
我们进展很快 但感觉很对
We was movin' kinda fast but the feeling was right

1247
02:01:23,110 --> 02:01:25,960
今晚就去内华达结婚
We should cruise up to Nevada Get married tonight

1248
02:01:25,990 --> 02:01:30,090
只要你在 生活就很简单
Life is simple as long as you're in my life

1249
02:01:30,120 --> 02:01:33,060
看着天上的烟火
Watching fireworks in the sky

1250
02:01:33,080 --> 02:01:36,060
就是你了 就是你了

就是你了
Yes, somehow I'm calling it now

1254
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:07,300
典籍里没有这样东西
They don't match any artefacts from our codex.

1255
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:08,800
你怎么看
What do you think?

1256
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:11,950
我不确定
I'm not sure.

1257
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:17,300
不是振金 也许是齐塔瑞族的
They're not vibranium. Chitauri?

1258
02:02:17,540 --> 02:02:20,940
我没见过这样的外星技术
Not like any alien tech I've seen.

1259
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,150
在交给你之前
How long did your dad have them

1260
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:24,860
你爸拥有十环多久了
before he gave them to you?

1261
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:25,920
呃
Um...

1262
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:28,110
一千年吧
About a thousand years.

一个信号

但你得慢慢习惯

回家好好休息
