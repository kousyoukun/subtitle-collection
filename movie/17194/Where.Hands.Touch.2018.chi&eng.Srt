1
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:41,133
一边去。
Move aside.

2
00:00:41,176 --> 00:00:44,571
我们正在寻找那个女孩。
We are looking for the girl.

3
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:46,268
那个德国人在哪里？
Where is the german?

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,053
你正在寻找的那个人，
The one you're searching for, she

5
00:00:48,096 --> 00:00:50,794
她两天前回到吕贝克了。
returned to Lubec two days ago.

6
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,709
你是施莱格尔太太？
You are Frau Schlegel?

7
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,102
她是你的孩子吗？
She is your child?

8
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:55,408
是的，但她不住在这里。
Yes, but she doesn't live here.

9
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,628
她在吕贝克和她阿姨一起住。
She lives with her aunt in Lubec.

10
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:00,413
你搞错了。
You're making a mistake.

11
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:04,678
像你这样的女人，只会污染。
Women like you, you contaminate.

12
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:09,248
如果她跟她母亲那怕有一点相似，她也会欣然接受
If she's anything like her mother, she'll be open also--

13
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:10,858
从里到外的肮脏
to contaminate from within.

14
00:01:16,516 --> 00:01:19,954
你找不到她的。
You won't find her.

15
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,956
因为她不住在这里。
Because she doesn't live here.

16
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:39,321
来，蕾娜，他们走了。
Leyna, come They've gone.

17
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:59,472
1944年春。
Spring 1944.

18
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:01,038
那一年我满十六岁。
That was the year I turned 16.

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,522
像我这样来自莱茵兰的孩子
Children like me from the Rhineland

20
00:02:06,566 --> 00:02:13,268
被称为莱茵兰的杂种或“希特勒的麻烦”
were known as Rhineland bastards or "Hitler's problem,"

21
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:16,184
因为即便我的父亲是非洲人
because our German nationality automatically

22
00:02:16,228 --> 00:02:19,709
而且不在身边，我们依旧能够从白人母亲
came through our white mothers even though our fathers

23
00:02:19,753 --> 00:02:22,103
那边获得德国国籍。
were African and often absent.

24
00:02:26,499 --> 00:02:31,199
我的同类人数稀少，以致在我过去16年里
There were so few of us that in my entire 16 years,

25
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:34,202
从来没有见过另外一个和我一样的人。
I never saw another soul like me.

26
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:37,727
生日快乐，可爱的女孩。
Happy Birthday, sweet girl.

27
00:02:37,771 --> 00:02:39,686
谢谢你，海因里希太太。
Thank you, Frau Heinrich.

28
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:42,950
希特勒想秘密地处决我们，
Hitler
wanted to deal with us secretly,

29
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:48,477
避免被德国群众视作对我们雅利安人母亲的攻击。
without being seen by Germany to be attacking our Aryan mothers.

30
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:53,178
所以我们拥有犹太人没有的自由，
So though we had a freedom that the Jews did not have,

31
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:57,225
但我们还是得掩掩藏藏，尤其是
still we had to be guarded, especially

32
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,923
当盖世太保密探来吕德斯海姆看我们的时候。
once the Gestapo started to visit us in Rudesheim.

33
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:08,715
并不是说我不知道自己不一样。
It wasn't that I had not known I was different.

34
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:15,330
而是在我16岁的时候，我才真正体会到。
It was that as I reached 16, I really began to feel it.

35
00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:20,117
正是那一年，我意识到了希特勒对我们这群人有着一个计划。
That was the year I realized Hitler had a plan for us.

36
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,858
我们为什么去柏林？
Why are we going to Berlin?

37
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:23,817
去消失。
To be invisible.

38
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,253
科恩，别说了。
Stop talking, Koen.

39
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:26,080
看你的书去。
Read your book.

40
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:40,703
我有我的画画本，但我没有铅笔。
I have my drawing book, but no pencil.

41
00:03:40,747 --> 00:03:42,357
没铅笔我画不了。
I can't draw without one.

42
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:44,707
你想要根铅笔？
You want a pencil?

43
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:49,408
我想我也许能够帮你，小伙子。
I think that I might be able to help you, little man.

44
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,670
谢谢你。
Thank you.

45
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:51,410
他就是事儿多。
He's restless.

46
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:52,367
他是个男孩子。
He's a boy.

47
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,760
我们长大了也不会变的。
We never grow out of it.

48
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,592
你的文件呢？
Your papers?

49
00:03:59,635 --> 00:04:02,116
是，当然。
Yes, of course.

50
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,726
我带了我们所有的文件。
I have all of our papers.

51
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,379
给你。
Here.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,219
施莱格尔？
Schlegel?

53
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:18,872
是。
Yes.

54
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,711
不要找事。
Invisible.

55
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,549
这里不像莱茵兰。
Here is not like the Rhineland.

56
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:45,812
他们不会因为你这样的孩子感到不安
They're not bothered with children like you

57
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:49,598
也不会嚷着要“修理”你。
or this talk of fixing you.

58
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:51,774
生活会好起来的。
Life will be good again.

59
00:04:51,818 --> 00:04:55,300
我保证。
I promise.

60
00:04:55,343 --> 00:04:58,346
今天，有个新来的女孩会加入我们。
We have a new girl joining us today.


61
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,004
她的名字是蕾娜・施莱格尔。
Her name is Leyna Schlegel.

62
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:04,700
起立。
Stand up.

63
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:14,797
施莱格尔是个不错的德国名字，但你的脸，如此的不像德国人。
Schlegel is a good German name, but your face, so un-German.

64
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:18,061
请告诉我，蕾娜的五官
Leyna has facial features in common

65
00:05:18,105 --> 00:05:21,369
和哪个洲的人相似呢？
with people of which continent?

66
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:22,631
格蕾塔。
Greta.

67
00:05:22,675 --> 00:05:23,806
非洲。
Africa.

68
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:29,377
正确，所以你这样的女孩是怎么
Indeed So how does a girl like you

69
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,553
拥有像施莱格尔这样德式的名字呢？
come to have a name so Germanic as Schlegel?

70
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:39,300
施莱格尔是我母亲的名字。
Schlegel is my mother's name.

71
00:05:39,344 --> 00:05:40,823
那你父亲的名字呢？
And what is your father's name?

72
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,440
你什么时候告诉我关于我父亲的事？
When will you tell me about my father?

73
00:05:48,483 --> 00:05:50,006
他从头到脚都是黑色皮肤。
He was black from head to toe.

74
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,184
我想知道他是谁。
I want to know who he was.

75
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,186
蕾娜。
Leyna.

76
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,884
你什么都知道。
You know everything.

77
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:00,974
当时，我只比你大一点。
I was just a little older than you.

78
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:01,714
犯了一些错误。
Made mistakes.

79
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:02,628
错误？
Mistakes?

80
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:05,326
不是说你。
Not you.

81
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:07,110
科恩，请给我倒点水。
Koen, get me some water, please.

82
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,118
他是个很出色的士兵。
He was a good soldier.

83
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:17,556
但这些我都告诉过你了。
But I've told you all this.

84
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,818
我不知道还有什么好说的。
I don't know what else.

85
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:20,820
你们为什么没有结婚？
Why did you not marry?

86
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:24,389
穆勒先生昨天批评了我，因为他告诉我
Mr. Mueller slapped me yesterday, because he told me

87
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:27,827
你即拥有最优等的白人血统
that you were the first of all people who are white

88
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,438
又有最低等的黑人血统。
and the worse of all people, black.

89
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:32,875
也就是黑白混血儿。
That's what a Mulatto is.

90
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,444
但我告诉他那不是真的。
But I told him that's not true.

91
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:38,403
对我来说，你是最好的。
To me you are the best of everything.

92
00:06:41,493 --> 00:06:44,539
你的头发脏了。
Your hair is dirty.

93
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:45,671
我今晚给你洗。
I'll wash it for you tonight.

94
00:06:58,379 --> 00:06:59,293
希特勒万岁。
Heil Hitler.


95
00:06:59,336 --> 00:06:59,946
希特勒万岁。
Heil Hitler.

96
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,368
嘿，你不该跟他们一起吗，你个猴子？
Hey, shouldn't you be going with them, monkey?

97
00:08:09,232 --> 00:08:11,626
威廉刚从维也纳回来。
Wilhelm just returned from Vienna.

98
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,367
但他知道我们要来吗？
But he knows we're coming?

99
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,411
对，当然。
Yes, of course.

100
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:15,325
我告诉他了。
I told him.

101
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:21,418
她真的很漂亮。
She actually is beautiful.

102
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:27,990
和她父亲一个模子刻出来的。
And he looks just like Father.

103
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:28,817
来啊，蕾娜。
Go on, Leyna.

104
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:29,514
坐下。
Sit down.

105
00:08:39,828 --> 00:08:42,265
我没想到你会和孩子一起来。
I didn't expect you with the children.

106
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,963
今天他们在门口看见了一个黑人。
Today they saw a Negro at the door.

107
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,878
第二天就会遭受犹太人的待遇，你懂吗？
Tomorrow it will be a Jew, you know?

108
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:46,835
没人看见我们，希达。
Nobody saw us, Hida.

109
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,761
蕾娜，你先走。
Leyna, go ahead of me.

110
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,459
看看能不能在店铺关门之前
See if you can pick up a good loaf of bread

111
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:04,505
拿到一块不错的面包。
before the store closes.

112
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:05,462
你把科恩带上。
Take Koen with you.

113
00:09:08,814 --> 00:09:11,556
蕾娜，求你了，走后面的门。
Leyna, please, use the back.

114
00:09:21,391 --> 00:09:23,176
柯思婷，我想让你理解，
Kerstin, I want you to understand,

115
00:09:23,219 --> 00:09:26,832
我跟你家无冤无仇。
I have nothing against your family.

116
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:31,010
而如果要在你的孩子和我们之间作出选择，我知道，
And a choice between your child and us, well, I know,

117
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,533
这根本没有选择。
it's no choice at all.

118
00:09:32,577 --> 00:09:35,449
即便我为德皇杀过人。
But I spilled blood for the Kaiser.

119
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:40,019
上个月他们仍把我生病的父亲关了两个晚上
And last month they kept my sick father over two nights

120
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:43,370
就因为有人让他们相信我父亲的妈妈是个犹太人。
because someone convinced them he had a Jewish mother.

121
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,981
而现在，你带着你的黑人过来。
And now you bring your Negro here.

122
00:09:46,025 --> 00:09:49,985
没有任何顾虑把我们都置于危险之中。
You compromised me, us, your sister, without any regard.

123
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,466
威廉。
Wilhelm.

124
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:59,560
请你听我说完，我发誓之后我们再也不会来打扰你们了。
Listen for just a moment and you 
will never hear from us again.

125
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:00,430
我需要文件。
I need papers.

126
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,389
柯思婷。
Kerstin.

127
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,566
能证明蕾娜不能生育的文件。
Something to say Leyna has been sterilized.

128
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,394
你真够特别的啊。
You really are quite unique.

129
00:10:07,437 --> 00:10:08,787
威廉，你有能力做到的。
Wilhelm, you have access.

130
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,617
一份证明她身体被改变了的盖世太保文件。
A Gestapo document declaring her physically changed.

131
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,054
你能做到的。
You can do this.

132
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:15,881
我知道你可以。
I know you can.

133
00:10:15,924 --> 00:10:16,969
你该走了，柯思婷。
You should leave, Kerstin.

134
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,666
希达，求你了。
Hida, please.

135
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,886
我没想到命令会影响到柏林。
I didn't think the order would extend to Berlin.

136
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:23,279
我本希望她在这里能够获得安全。
I hoped she would be safe here.

137
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,541
但两天前他们来了。
But two days ago they came.

138
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,152
她出去了。
She was out.

139
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,067
我告诉了他们文件在她身上，但我害怕。
I told them she carries the papers with her but I'm afraid.

140
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:35,857
我怕他们会从街上把她带走
I'm afraid that they will take her from the streets,

141
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:39,165
从学校，任何我保护不了她的地方。
from the school, anywhere that I can't protect her.

142
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:40,470
蕾娜，我们走吧。
Leyna, let's go.

143
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,211
你为什么让她上学？
Why did you put her in school?

144
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:44,387
你什么毛病？
What's the matter with you?

145
00:10:44,431 --> 00:10:45,693
我不能把她藏起来。
I can't hide her.

146
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,347
如果不是学校，就得是干苦工去。
If not school, then labor service.

147
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,740
谁知道会发生什么呢？
Who knows where she would end?

148
00:10:48,783 --> 00:10:50,611
每个女孩都要去做苦工。
All the girls must do labor service.

149
00:10:50,655 --> 00:10:51,917
她也一样。
She's no different.

150
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,701
你想让她享有特权吗？
You want her to be special?

151
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:55,660
不。
No.

152
00:10:55,703 --> 00:11:00,447
我想让她和别人一样。
I want her to be like everyone else.

153
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,274
不被贴上标签。
Unremarkable.

154
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:08,716
那么她就得直面这场无法逃离的战争。
Then she will not escape this war as if it never happened.

155
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,196
我们谁都无法逃离，柯思婷。
None of us will
 manage that, Kerstin.

156
00:11:17,638 --> 00:11:18,944
甘特。
Gunter.

157
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,641
哪里？
Where?

158
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:24,340
那声音是从哪里来的？
Where did that voice come from?

159
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,298
啊。
Ah.

160
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:26,778
来点面包，甘特，谢谢。
Some bread, please, Gunter.

161
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:27,735
你怎么样？
How are you?

162
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,605
不错？
Good?

163
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:29,606
正在安顿下来？
Settling in?

164
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,347
我想家。
I miss home.

165
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,566
早啊。
Morning.

166
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,136
啊，我想，那是个笑容吧。
Ah, is that a, yes, I think a smile.

167
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,268
好点了。
That's better.

168
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:40,356
还有人在等。
There are people waiting.

169
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:53,239
我总是在后面存着一块好的，但给你了。
I always keep good come back, but you can have it.

170
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:54,631
现在你听我说
Now listen to me.

171
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,677
如果你姐姐忘了要笑，
If your sister forgets to smile, you

172
00:11:56,721 --> 00:11:58,723
你得让她想起甘特的脸。
remind her of Gunter's face.

173
00:11:58,766 --> 00:12:00,986
很搞笑，是不是？
It's funny, yes?

174
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:01,638
是。
Yes.

175
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,346
我现在能走了吗？
Can I go now?

176
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,043
嗯，你可以跟其他男孩子一起走了。
Yes, you can go with the other boys.

177
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:17,785
去吧。
Go on then.

178
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:18,438
科恩。
Koen.

179
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,142
科恩。
Koen.

180
00:12:27,186 --> 00:12:28,883
我没有选择。
I have no choice.

181
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,798
法律说你必须得走。
The law says you must go.

182
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:36,543
但在你要去的那个地方，他们会教你很多东西。
But where you are going, they will teach you many things.

183
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:39,676
很多都是有道理，感觉是对的，
Lots will make sense and feel right,

184
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,070
但很多会让你感到疑惑
but so much will be confusing because it

185
00:12:42,114 --> 00:12:48,250
因为它和你在家里学到的东西不同。
will be different to the things you learn here at home.

186
00:12:48,294 --> 00:12:51,819
但我希望你理解，没有人
But I want you to understand that nobody

187
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:54,909
能比一个母亲更了解自己的儿子，
can know a son better than a mother,

188
00:12:54,953 --> 00:12:57,216
任何老师，任何队长都不行。
no teacher, no group leader.

189
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:04,701
我希望，科恩，你选择永远不忘记这个，
I hope, Koen, that you choose never to forget this,

190
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:10,751
你把我教你的放在这里和这里。
that you keep what I teach you in here and here.

191
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,104
科恩，你理解我说的吗？
Do you understand me, Koen?

192
00:13:48,006 --> 00:13:48,745
蕾娜！
Leyna!


193
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:49,790
我没有看到你。
I didn't see you.

194
00:13:49,834 --> 00:13:50,530
蕾娜？
Leyna?

195
00:13:50,573 --> 00:13:52,010
对不起。
Sorry.

196
00:13:52,053 --> 00:13:55,100
让我看看你。
Let me look at you.

197
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,014
你应该更小心一点。
You should be more careful.

198
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,631
我需要你把你带回家，好清理这些伤口。
I need to get you home so we can clean these wounds.

199
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,593
对不起
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:26,305 --> 00:14:28,176
你为什么这么早跑到楼里？
Why are you in the building so early?

201
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,223
队长们在男孩子们到达之前有个会议要开。
The leaders in meeting before the boys arrive.

202
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:32,746
我跟他们说这是必须的。
I told them we need to.

203
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,270
你在给自己找麻烦吗？
Are you making problems for yourself?

204
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:38,404
年龄大的那些还在抢别人的零花钱。
The older ones are taking pocket money from the others.

205
00:14:38,447 --> 00:14:40,014
昨天还有孩子的母亲冲我耳朵里瞎喊。
Yesterday I had mothers screaming in my ears.

206
00:14:40,058 --> 00:14:40,710
等等！
Wait!

207
00:14:44,062 --> 00:14:45,367
问我要。
Ask.

208
00:14:45,411 --> 00:14:46,194
嗯。
Hm.

209
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:46,891
别伸手就拿。
Don't take.

210
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,727
我们有点晚了，纳格尔太太。
We're a little late, Frau Nagel.

211
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,555
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

212
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,166
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

213
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,820
一个小疯子骑着自行车把她撞倒了。
A little hooligan ran her over with his bike.

214
00:15:03,864 --> 00:15:06,171
是个意外。
It was an accident.

215
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,389
你该说什么，科恩？
What do you say, Koen?

216
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,695
谢谢你，纳格尔太太。
Thank you, Frau Nagel.

217
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:11,916
下回下国际象棋，我要让你输得屁滚尿流，对吧？
And next time, I kick your ass at chess, huh?

218
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:17,791
一位先生让我替你拿着。
A gentleman asked me to take it for you.

219
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,272
你不在的时候，他站在你的门口外面了。
He was at your door while you were gone.

220
00:15:20,315 --> 00:15:24,537
我问了他的名字，但他不愿意告诉我。
I ask him his name, but he didn't want to tell me.

221
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,190
是威廉。
Wilhelm.

222
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:41,771
希达不能知道这件事。
Hida must never know.

223
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,208
这里，拿着这些。
Here, take them.

224
00:15:43,251 --> 00:15:47,125
一套医生的文件也填好了。
A set of the doctor's papers has also been filed.

225
00:15:47,168 --> 00:15:48,604
谁？
Who?

226
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,433
鲁德谢姆市的一个眼目，
A connection in the municipality of Rudesheim,

227
00:15:51,477 --> 00:15:52,782
制度下的一个关键人物。
one who is critical 
of the regime.

228
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:55,568
一个共产党？
A communist?

229
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:58,223
你有共产党联系人？
You have communist contacts?

230
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:00,877
这里面有很多
There are more papers inside that

231
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:03,402
需要在鲁德谢姆存档的文件。
must be archived in Rudesheim.

232
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:07,101
把他们签好字，按要求还给我。
Have them signed and returned to me as instructed.

233
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:11,584
这之后，你就得与你的妹妹断绝来往。
And then you must forget that you ever had a sister.

234
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:34,911
给。
Here.

235
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,060
什么？
What?

236
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,105
没什么。
Nothing.

237
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:57,151
你擦鞋跟你哈里叔叔似的
You polish like your Uncle Harry--

238
00:16:57,195 --> 00:17:00,111
像个女孩一样。
like a girl.

239
00:17:00,154 --> 00:17:05,072
哦好吧，反正哈里叔叔告诉我，我擦鞋跟你似的。
Oh, well Uncle Harry told me I polish like you.

240
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,031
你弄完了的话，去把你自己清理干净。
When you're finished, go and get yourself cleaned up.

241
00:17:07,074 --> 00:17:10,817
你头发里有泥巴。
You have mud in your hair.

242
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,818
我今天瞄靶棒极了。
My targets were excellent today.

243
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,740
我得去汉堡，但周日，
I have to go to Hamburg tonight but Sunday,

244
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:21,915
星期天我们去捕些鱼，如何？
Sunday we'll catch some fish, yes?

245
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:55,122
我有文件要给你。
I have papers for you.

246
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,126
你去哪都要戴着它们。
You should carry them with you wherever you go.

247
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,042
它们会保护你。
They will protect you.

248
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,087
你从哪 -
Where did you--

249
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:08,048
它们是假的，但足够了。
They're false, but they're enough.

250
00:18:08,092 --> 00:18:08,701
没有人会知道的。
No one will know.

251
00:18:15,142 --> 00:18:19,015
威廉需要你把这些也签好。
Wilhelm needs you to sign these also.

252
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,626
等我把这些寄回给他，
If I send them back to him, he will

253
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:24,586
他会保证我们以后不再被打扰。
make sure it's in the right place for us to be left alone.

254
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,501
这是什么？
What is it?

255
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:29,417
一个你不会犯下罪过
A declaration that you will not

256
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:31,115
将自己的种族与如何有德国血液的人
commit the crime of racial mixing

257
00:18:31,158 --> 00:18:32,377
混为一体的声明。
with anyone of German blood.


258
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:37,164
我是个德国人。
I am of German blood.

259
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,253
签字只是为了让他们不要来打扰我们。
It's just a signature to keep them away.

260
00:18:39,297 --> 00:18:40,646
没有任何意义的。
It means nothing.

261
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:42,648
一定有意义，不然我为什么要签？
It means something surely or why should I sign?

262
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,913
我不签。
I won't.

263
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,570
好吧。
Fine.

264
00:18:51,613 --> 00:18:53,311
那他们就会来抓你，蕾娜，
Then they will come for you, Leyna,

265
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:57,576
然后他们会逼着你签，到时候就不是又假又空的文件。
and they will make you sign, not false, empty papers.

266
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:02,407
而是真的文件，而在此之前，他们会真的修理你
Real ones, and not before they have fixed you in reality

267
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:04,104
在你体内动刀子。
and cut your insides to do so.

268
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:18,379
不论是你还是你弟弟 
Neither you nor your brother entered

269
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,513
都是经历了痛苦才来到世上。
this world without pain.

270
00:19:21,556 --> 00:19:26,953
但如果没有你们两个，我不会有我的这一生。
But I could not be in this life without you both.

271
00:19:26,996 --> 00:19:27,997
某一天，你也应该知道
You should also know the blessing

272
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,173
作为母亲的恩赐，蕾娜。
of motherhood one day, Leyna.

273
00:19:32,176 --> 00:19:35,396
我想让你体会到。
I want that for you.

274
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,704
如果你不签，他们会对你
If you do not sign, they will do to you

275
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:39,835
做一些不可能挽回的事情。
what can never be undone.

276
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:47,452
你会成为他们改造的产物。
You will be who they have made you.

277
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,542
那个允许波兰拿走帝国的这一片土地
What was the treaty that enabled Poland to take

278
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,283
的条约是什么？
this land from the empire?

279
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:53,240
安娜？
Anna?

280
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:54,285
凡尔赛条约。
Versailles.

281
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:55,895
施莱格尔。
Schlegel.

282
00:19:55,938 --> 00:20:00,116
签署这条条约的五位重要领导人是谁？
The five principle leaders were signatories to this treaty?

283
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,117
希特勒万岁。
Heil Hitler.

284
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,684
希特勒万岁。
Heil Hitler.

00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,251
希特勒万岁。

00:20:04,295 --> 00:20:04,904
坐下。

287

把书放下。
Leave your books.

290
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:25,141
你不会再需要它们了。
You won't need them anymore.

291
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:25,838
拿着你的包。
And take your bag.

292
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,042
他们没有伤害你。
They didn't hurt you.


293
00:20:56,085 --> 00:20:57,565
这是唯一要紧的事。
That's all that matters.

294
00:21:01,352 --> 00:21:03,049
他们可以不让你上学，但他们

295
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:05,878
不能阻止你学习。

296
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:07,706
你在家里学习。

297
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,451
但你现在会被召去劳动了。

298

我为你今天的劳动感到骄傲。

299
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:29,205
你的成长如此之快。
You're growing so quickly.

300
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:31,773
我有件现在对你来说很合身的外套。
I have a coat that will fit you nicely now.

301
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:45,004
开车送我们回家？
Drive us home?

302
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:46,353
不了，谢谢。
No, thank you.

303
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:47,049
我…我骑车。
I-- I'll cycle.

304
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:08,201
哦，请。
Oh, please.

305
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:18,211
你跟着我们回家了。
You followed us home.

306
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,344
我想知道你是不是没事。
I wanted to know if you're all right.

307
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:20,996
我没是。
I am.

308
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:29,048
你在看什么？
What are you looking at?

309
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:30,179
我不知道，你的瘀青吧。
I don't know, your bruise.

310
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:41,539
再见了。
I'll see you.

311
00:22:41,582 --> 00:22:42,191
你叫什么名字？
What's your name?

312
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,335
甘特
Gunter,..

313
00:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,776

314

脱下来。

316
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:16,269
脱掉！

317
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:29,717
他们没把你的包皮切干净啊，犹太人。
They didn't circumcise you good enough, Jew.

318
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:30,675
我能把它修好。

319
00:23:39,858 --> 00:23:40,772
发生什么了？
What happened?

320
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:41,773
他是个犹太人？
He was a Jew?

321
00:23:41,816 --> 00:23:43,383
打印海报。
Printing leaflets.

322
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:44,732
他跟其他学生一起密谋着什么。
He was plotting with other students.

323
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:46,430
把十字架跟个徽章似的戴着。
He wore a crucifix like it was a badge.

324
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:48,388
跟些腐臭的犹太复国运动组织混在一起。
Running with some rotten Zionist group.

325
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:03,838
我在甘特的店铺外面听到有人讨论。
I heard some people outside Gunter's store.

326
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:05,884
甘特今天遭遇了一些事。
Something happened to him today.

327
00:24:05,927 --> 00:24:07,668
我知道。
I know.

328
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:08,539
我在现场。
I was there.

329
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:09,191
我看见了。
I saw it.

330
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:15,502
他当时在弄他的面包。
He was touching the bread.

331
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:17,504
但他是犹太人。
But he was Jewish.

332
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:18,462
科恩，别傻了。
Don't be stupid, Koen.

333
00:24:18,505 --> 00:24:19,941
他是个好犹太人。
He was good Jew.


334
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:21,029
蕾娜。
Leyna.

335
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:23,379
好犹太人？
Good Jew?

336
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:26,426
他是个活生生的人。
He was a human being.

337
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,689
如果我禁止你和我走在同一条街上
If I forbade you from sharing the streets with me

338
00:24:28,733 --> 00:24:31,170
只因为你的脸上有雀斑，我的言语有能力
because your face is freckled, should my words make

339
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,433
让你失去作为人的资格吗？
you any less of a human being?

340
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:35,087
这样的话是不是任何人都应该
Should that mean that anyone should shoot

341
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,262
在大街上把你像一条狗一样打死？
you in the street like a dog?

342
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:43,443
对不起。
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:47,142 --> 00:24:50,668
你看到这样一件事，我很抱歉，蕾娜。
I'm sorry you had to see such a thing, Leyna.

344
00:24:50,711 --> 00:24:53,540
对你也如此，科恩。
Also to you, Koen.

345
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:56,761
这不是你的错误，这是我的责任
It's not your fault. It's my job to protect

346
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:59,241
来规范你听到的东西，甚至是你想的东西。
you from the things you hear, even the things you think.

347
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:08,424
一个党卫军。
A Waffen SS man.

348
00:25:08,468 --> 00:25:10,905
今天训练的时候他过来找我们。
He came to speak to us in training today.

349
00:25:10,949 --> 00:25:14,082
他告诉我，我的技艺很好。
He told me my skills are superior.

350
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,649
他想进一步和我谈谈。
He wishes to speak with me further.

351
00:25:15,693 --> 00:25:17,608
他叫什么名字？
What was his name?

352
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:19,174
莱贝尔。
Leiber.

353
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,872
排长。
Section leader.

354
00:25:20,915 --> 00:25:26,486
告诉我，莱贝尔打算什么时候和我谈？
Tell me when does Leiber plan to speak to me?

355
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,141
我不觉得他们会要求你打仗。
I don't think they're asking you to fight.

356
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:31,926
那你有没有问他们为什么不在前线
And are you asking them why they are not out there

357
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:35,582
亲自上阵，而是在这个地方招募你
fighting themselves these men who walk around recruiting you

358
00:25:35,626 --> 00:25:38,280
这种傻瓜？
idiots?

359
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:39,891
你为什么要生气？
Why are you angry?

360
00:25:39,934 --> 00:25:41,719
当没有人攻击你的时侯，你很容易击中目标，
It's easy to hit the target when no one is attacking you,

361
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:43,285
卢茨。
Lutz.

362
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:46,506
你觉得到东边战场上有时间给你练习？
You think there's time for practice out there in the east?


363
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:50,292
在那里敌人是真实的，他唯一的目标就是你。
Out there the enemy is real and his only target is you.

364
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,946
这对我来说不是个游戏。
This isn't a game to me.

365
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,732
我很努力训练。
I am training hard.

366
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:55,602
谁都能看出来。
Everyone can see it.

367
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:05,612
上一场战争我打了四年的仗，我回来时
I fought in the last war for four years, and when I got

368
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:10,661
德国比我走的时候还要糟糕。
back Germany was even worse than when I left.

369
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:11,662
没有工作。
No work.

370
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:12,445
负债累累。
Debt.

371
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,708
饥荒遍地。
Hunger.

372
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:17,624
跟你似的，我们心甘情愿地向死亡奔去。
Like you, we ran willingly towards our death.

373
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:21,628
为了保护我们的家园。
Towards protecting the-- the Homeland.

374
00:26:21,672 --> 00:26:25,501
我们像傻子一样，没有问过一个问题。
Like fools, we didn't ask a single question.

375
00:26:25,545 --> 00:26:29,593
然后这些跟我一起吃饭的同伴，
And all those men, comrades that I ate with,

376
00:26:29,636 --> 00:26:32,639
一起睡觉，一起上厕所的同伴，他们死得毫无价值。
slept with, pissed with-- they died for nothing.

377
00:26:32,683 --> 00:26:34,119
你懂吗？毫无价值！
Do you understand me? For nothing!

378
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:43,302
我们被羞辱了，被欺骗了。
We were humiliated, cheated.

379
00:26:43,345 --> 00:26:47,523
但是这场战争，这场战争是我们的。
But this war, this war is ours.

380
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,917
你不能做出任何改变。
You cannot make a difference.

381
00:26:49,961 --> 00:26:52,528
不是那样的。
That's not true.

382
00:26:52,572 --> 00:26:54,008
广播：德国
ANNOUNCER : Germany will

383
00:26:54,052 --> 00:26:57,925
将从奸诈的盖世太保和谋杀犯党卫军中解放，
be freed from the Gestapo hyenas, the SS murderers,

384
00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:00,232
任何相信希特勒的污秽，
and anyone who believes in the filth of Hitler,

385
00:27:00,275 --> 00:27:01,668
相信民族社会主义
of National Socialism--

386
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,240
和这令人作呕的社会体系。
--and this repulsive system.

387
00:27:08,283 --> 00:27:10,459
我们都会看着它覆灭，不是你的消亡，
We will see the end-- not of you,

388
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:13,854
也不是德国，因为这场战争不是针对德国人民的。
not of Germany, for the fight is not against the German people.

389
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,464
蕾娜。
Leyna.

390
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,770
相反，英国为了
On the contrary, Britain fights to--

391
00:27:16,814 --> 00:27:18,380
我
I--

392
00:27:18,424 --> 00:27:19,730
让你们从恐怖的
--relieve
 you from the monstrous

393
00:27:19,773 --> 00:27:21,557
独裁者中的手中解放而战
hands of a dictator--

394
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:22,994
妈妈，我只是需要呼吸新鲜空气。
Mother, I just need some fresh air.

395
00:27:23,037 --> 00:27:24,430
他们说服你，他们会
--who convinced you he would

396
00:27:24,473 --> 00:27:25,561
解放德国，但反而
free Germany, and instead--

397
00:27:25,605 --> 00:27:26,693
蕾娜。
Leyna.

398
00:27:26,737 --> 00:27:27,607
他们毁灭了德国。
--has broken it.

399
00:27:35,876 --> 00:27:36,790
她是个黑鬼。
She's a negro.

400
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:43,405
蕾娜。
Leyna.

401
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:45,859
蕾娜？
Leyna?

402
00:28:50,298 --> 00:28:51,125
那是你的名字吧？
That's your name?

403
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:56,522
你为什么过来？
Why did you come?

404
00:28:56,565 --> 00:28:59,220
你可能会惹上很大的麻烦。
You could get into a lot of trouble.

405
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,178
希特勒万岁！
Heil Hitler!

406
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,222
我想看看而已。
I wanted to see what it's like.

407
00:29:01,266 --> 00:29:03,485
希特勒万岁！
Heil Hitler!

408
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:05,966
看看他在这里干什么。
See what he does here.

409
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,273
科恩。
Koen.

410
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:10,014
他是我弟弟。
He's my brother.

411
00:29:10,057 --> 00:29:11,972
我知道。
I know.

412
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,931
我见过他和你在一起。
I have seen him with you.

413
00:29:13,974 --> 00:29:16,020
你是在偷窥我们吗？
Were you spying on us?

414
00:29:16,063 --> 00:29:16,716
只有一次。
Only once.

415
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:23,114
他是德国人。
He's German.

416
00:29:23,157 --> 00:29:24,028
当然。
Of course.

417
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:34,647
我见过一位长得像你一样的女士。

418
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:37,171
在一张照片里。
In a photograph.

419
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:42,350
好吧，其实不是一张照片。
Well not really a photograph.

420
00:29:42,394 --> 00:29:44,439
我的父亲，他有一台留声机。
My father, he has a gramophone.

421
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:49,880
他把他的爵士乐唱片都藏起来了，但我听他偷偷放过。
He hides jazz records, but I've heard them playing quietly.

422
00:29:49,923 --> 00:29:52,839
有时侯，深夜里，我在我房间的时候，
Sometimes, late at night, when I'm in my room,

423
00:29:52,883 --> 00:29:54,362
如果我把耳朵贴在地板上，我就能听见。
if I press my ear to the floor, I hear.

424
00:29:58,802 --> 00:29:59,628
黑人音乐。
Negermusik.

425
00:30:03,328 --> 00:30:04,198
那不正是这种音乐的名字吗？
Isn't that what it's called?

426
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:08,202
它们是被禁止的。
It's not allowed.

427
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:17,298
我们要是在友好的环境下，
When we're in a friendly situation,

428
00:30:17,342 --> 00:30:23,783
我的话语也许听起来不这么悦耳。
my conversation might not be smart.

429
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:28,701
但如果我们能彼此理解，
But if we're to have a perfect understanding,

430
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,878
我们就叫它将心比心吧。
let's call a heart a heart.


431
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:38,189
在一本杂志的封面上有一位女士。
On the cover of one of the magazines there's a lady.

432
00:30:38,232 --> 00:30:39,712
她和你一样。
She's like you.

433
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:43,324
有点美丽。
Kind of beautiful.

434
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,863
你唱那些歌会惹上麻烦的。
You'll get into trouble singing those songs.

435
00:30:59,906 --> 00:31:01,473
我只需要小心一点就行了。
I'll just have to be careful.

436
00:31:01,516 --> 00:31:02,126
像我父亲一样。
Like my father.

437
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:17,402
来吧。
Come on.

438
00:31:28,979 --> 00:31:31,590
你有没有上去过那里？
Have you ever been up there?

439
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:34,680
那些山丘上？
Into those hills?

440
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:37,378
那是世界上最安静的地方。
It's the quietest place on earth.

441
00:31:37,422 --> 00:31:39,293
我之前经常上去收集毛毛虫，
I used to go up there to collect caterpillars,

442
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:42,253
跟我父亲和母亲一起
with my father and my mother.

443
00:31:42,296 --> 00:31:43,994
你在那里可以看到整个柏林。
You can see all of Berlin from that one place.

444
00:31:51,262 --> 00:31:52,089
你离家出走了吗？
Did you run away?

445
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:55,222
离家出走？
Run away?

446
00:31:58,312 --> 00:32:00,793
因为你的母亲，她是
It's just your mother, she is--

447
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:08,192
她不是犹太人。
She's not Jewish.

448
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:11,195
不，我知道，但是
No, I know, but--

449
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:13,545
你的父亲
your father.

450
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:15,851
他…他是个黑人。
He-- He's a negro.

451
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:22,075
你有没有在晚上游泳？
Have you ever swam in the night?

452
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:23,947
就是黑到什么也看不见的时候。
You know, when it's so dark you can see nothing.

453
00:32:29,996 --> 00:32:34,000
我一直在想那会是多么美妙。
I always thought it would be so wonderful.

454
00:32:34,044 --> 00:32:36,046
那你为什么没这么做过？
Then why have you never done it?

455
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:43,270
在鲁德谢姆，我每周都游泳。
In Rudesheim I'd swim every week.

456
00:32:43,314 --> 00:32:45,403
那里有很多犹太人。
There were many Jews.

457
00:32:45,446 --> 00:32:46,839
他们不能用游泳池。
They were told they couldn't use the pool.

458
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:56,849
然后，他们说我也不能用。
And then-- I was told I couldn't use it either.

459
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:59,852
很久之前的事了。
It's been a long time, that's all.

460
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:01,245
我有过自己被水淹死的噩梦。
I have dreams that I'm drowning.

461
00:33:08,992 --> 00:33:10,558
你只需要再适应水就行了。
You just have to get used to the water again.


462
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:21,830
你可以和我一起跳进来。
You can jump in with me.

463
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:28,881
接下来
Now the next--

464
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:44,549
希特勒万岁。
Heil Hitler.

465
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,514
蕾娜。
Leyna.

466
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:54,254
蕾娜！
Leyna!

467
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,299
蕾娜？
Leyna?

468
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:56,082
蕾娜！
Leyna!

469
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:57,127
蕾娜！
Leyna!

470
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,130
蕾娜。
Leyna.

471
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:19,671
我来。
Here.

472
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:21,499
接下来你不能瞎走了。
This bit you need to know where you're going.

473
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:25,459
我真不敢相信我把我的自行车借给你了。
I can't believe I lent you my bike.

474
00:34:29,724 --> 00:34:31,552
我母亲为我们做的。
My mother had them made for us.

475
00:34:31,596 --> 00:34:32,640
我和父亲。
For me and father.

476
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:36,122
她也有一个吗？
Does she have one too?

477
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:37,863
她去世了。
She's dead.

478
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:40,213
哦，我
Oh, I--

479
00:34:40,257 --> 00:34:42,911
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

480
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,523
这就是你来这里的原因吗？
Is that why you come here?

481
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:46,176
来思念她？
To think of her?

482
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:52,269
有时侯是。
Sometimes.

483
00:34:52,312 --> 00:34:55,881
更多时候，我都在想打仗是什么感觉。
Mostly I think of what would it would be like to fight.

484
00:34:55,924 --> 00:35:00,277
为德国而战，像我父亲一样。
To stand up for Germany, like my father did.

485
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,845
你觉得你能杀人吗？
Do you think you could take a life?

486
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:06,457
杀掉一个活生生的人？
Kill a human being?

487
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,807
我当然可以。
Of course I could.

488
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,678
我可以轻松杀死一名俄罗斯士兵。
I could kill a Russian soldier with ease.

489
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,990
噢，我母亲要觉得我搞事情了。
Ooh, my mother will think I've been up to something.

490
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,731
用我的衣服吧。
Use my jumper.

491
00:35:19,774 --> 00:35:20,384
会方便一点。
It's easier.

492
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:29,306
你不害怕吗？
Aren't you afraid?

493
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:31,177
害怕什么？
Of what?

494
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,918
打仗。
Fighting.

495
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:34,659
战争。
War.

496
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:35,877
战争让你感到害怕吗？
Does the war frighten you?

497
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:38,576
是的。
Yes.

498
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:40,665
我父亲打了仗。
My father fought in the war.

499
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:41,405
真的？
He did?

500
00:35:41,448 --> 00:35:42,101
为了德国？
For Germany?

501
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:45,844
当然。
Of course.

502
00:35:48,673 --> 00:35:49,891
BBC广播员：这里是英格兰。

507
00:36:00,206 --> 00:36:03,340
英国精英部队和美国军队 -
British Elite Forces, along with US troops--

508
00:36:03,383 --> 00:36:04,645
我父亲是为德国而战的吗？
Did my father fight for Germany?

509
00:36:04,689 --> 00:36:06,038
你再说一遍？
Beg your pardon?

510
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,213
今天拿下了
--have today captured

511
00:36:07,257 --> 00:36:08,388
法国的瑟堡港 -
the French port of Cherbourg--

512
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,911
他是法国军人。

在西部前线。

515
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:16,179
胜利包括
The victory included--

516
00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:24,448
你是告诉过我他是被派到这边来打仗的。
You told me he was sent here to fight.

517
00:36:24,491 --> 00:36:26,754
你没告诉我他是来打我们的！
You didn't tell me he was sent here to fight us!

518
00:36:34,022 --> 00:36:35,981
这是他的语言！
It's his language!

519
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:38,679
我们见面时，他已经是部队的成员了。
He was part of the Occupation by the time we met.

520
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:40,333
他不是你的敌人。

521
00:36:40,377 --> 00:36:42,944
也不是我的。
Or me.

00:36:42,988 --> 00:36:45,077
他当然是。

523
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,908
我是德国人，即便你想装作你不是。

524
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:52,693
即使你想让我装作我不是。
Even if you want me to pretend I'm not.

525
00:36:52,737 --> 00:36:55,479
我爱过他。
I loved him.

526
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:57,829
正是爱才让你降临在这个世界上。
It was from that place that you came.

527
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:01,180
科恩甚至都不是。
A place even Koen cannot claim.

528

是你再次让我成为众矢之的。

蕾娜，那你看看你周围吧！

531
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:11,277
听着，蕾娜。
Look, Leyna.

532
00:37:11,321 --> 00:37:14,454
下次你再和那个纳粹的儿子在一起的时候，
And the next time you are with that son of a Nazi,

533
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,282
你要知道
you know this--

534
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:21,374
如果他父亲发现你和他儿子在一起，他会杀了他。
If his father catches you with his boy, he'll kill him.

535
00:37:21,418 --> 00:37:23,028
然后来杀掉我们！
Before he comes and kills us!

536
00:37:51,883 --> 00:37:55,495
我忘带手套了。
I've forgotten my gloves.

537
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:56,191
我等你。
I'll wait.

538
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,327
不，你继续走吧。
No, you go on.


539
00:38:01,371 --> 00:38:02,285
我一会儿就好。
I'll be just a moment.

540
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:06,332
这是你的选择，蕾娜。
It's your choice, Leyna.

541
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:35,187
你一直在这里。
You're always here.

542
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,449
在工厂外面。
Outside the factory.

543
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:43,369
你冷吗？
Are you cold?

544
00:38:43,413 --> 00:38:45,371
不。
No.

545
00:38:45,415 --> 00:38:47,591
你呢？
Are you?

546
00:38:47,634 --> 00:38:49,244
嗯，这是最冷的夏天。
Yes, it's the coldest summer.

547
00:38:52,552 --> 00:38:55,686
我把手套丢了。
I've lost my gloves.

548
00:38:55,729 --> 00:38:57,122
我跟我母亲说我落下了。
I told my mother I left them.

549
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:12,023
我得走了。
I have to go.

550
00:40:12,066 --> 00:40:14,460
我不想让我母亲再对我失望了。
I don't want my mother to be more upset with me.

551
00:40:14,504 --> 00:40:15,809
我想给你个东西。
I wanted to give you something.

552
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:25,689
奶酪。
Cheese.

553
00:40:25,732 --> 00:40:28,169
也许你可以跟科恩和你母亲一起享用它。
Maybe you could enjoy it with Koen and your mother.

554
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:44,751
我以为你走了
I thought you had gone.

555
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:48,146
蕾娜，我母亲没有等我。
My mother didn't wait for me, Leyna.

556
00:40:48,189 --> 00:40:52,411
在那之后我就怀上你了
And that's just how I became your mother,

557
00:40:52,455 --> 00:40:54,718
追逐和你面前一样的不可能。
chasing the same impossibility you are chasing.

558
00:40:57,938 --> 00:41:01,333
你父亲第一次看到我时，
The first time your father looked at me,

559
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:02,987
我认为这世上除了他不会再有人
I thought my heart would never beat again

560
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,205
让我有活着的感觉。
unless he loved me forever.

561
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:10,995
然而这之后他从我身边被别人带走了，蕾娜。
He was ripped away from me, Leyna.

562
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:13,954
我剩下的只有你了。
And all I had left was you.

563
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:17,262
世上最好的事物。
The best of everything.

564
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:19,220
你觉得我能离开你吗？
So you think I could ever leave you?

565
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:26,750
我们两个都有依靠。
For each of us there is someone.

566
00:41:29,927 --> 00:41:32,190
对我来说是你，蕾娜。
For me it's you, Leyna.

567
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:35,541
你父亲留给我的礼物。
The gift from your father.

568
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:39,240
科恩是我的心脏，你知道的。
Koen is my heart, you know that.

569
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:45,769
但对我来说，那个依靠是你。
But for me, that someone is you.

570
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:52,993
塞巴斯蒂安：一个肮脏的英国人。
An unwashed Englishman.

571
00:41:56,257 --> 00:41:58,651
一个法国狒狒，从头到脚都是黑的。
A French baboon, black from head to toe.


572
00:41:58,695 --> 00:41:59,739
黑得像你的姐。
Black like your sister.

573
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:02,960
如同蕾娜一样，黑得像煤。
Black as coal like Leyna.

574
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:09,401
站好队！
HITLER YOUTH COMMANDER: Get in line!

575
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,664
动起来！
Move!

576
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,280
习惯了，是吗？
Used to it, aren't you?

577
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:23,241
嘴里含着肮脏的土？
Dirt in your mouth?

578
00:42:23,284 --> 00:42:24,285
一个好的士兵应该有尊严。
A good soldier should have honor.

579
00:42:28,725 --> 00:42:29,377
科恩！
Koen!

580
00:42:39,997 --> 00:42:40,824
科恩，你还好吗？
Are you all right, Koen?

581
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,310
科恩！
Koen!

582
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:50,007
什么？
What?

583
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:55,055
你还爱我吗？
Do you still love me?

584
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:56,361
不。
No.

585
00:42:56,404 --> 00:42:58,581
我恨你。
I hate you.

586
00:42:58,624 --> 00:43:00,931
你是个女孩，我讨厌女孩！
You're a girl and I hate girls!

587
00:43:39,883 --> 00:43:44,452
我没有
I have not

588
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:47,325
这些不是老文件！
These are not old papers!

589
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:48,282
别拿那些拿走！
Don't take those!

590
00:43:48,326 --> 00:43:49,980
你要带我去哪儿？
Where are you taking me?

591
00:43:50,023 --> 00:43:51,285
你们这里有犹太人吗？
You have Jews here?

592
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:53,418
只有我们三个。
It's just the three of us.

593
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:54,941
我儿子在卧室里睡着了。
My son is asleep, in the bedroom.

594
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:02,688
她的文件呢？
Where are her papers?

595
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:03,428
去拿来，蕾娜。
Go fetch them, Leyna.

596
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,482
没事的，科恩。
It's all right, Koen.

597
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,179
他们很快就走了。
They'll go soon.

598
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,435
盖世太保士兵：出生于鲁德谢姆。
Born in Rudesheim.

599
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:55,088
德国人。
German.

600
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:03,836
你是个黑鬼，但你说你是德国人。
You are a Negro, but you say you are German.

601
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:38,697
我们会去弄新的来。
We will have them replaced.

602
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,018
你不用再去找那个党卫军莱贝尔了。
You, er, won't be reporting to SS Leiber.

603
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:58,630
他觉得你在别的地方会更有用处。
He thinks you'll be of more use elsewhere.

604
00:45:58,673 --> 00:45:59,283
打仗？
Fighting?

605
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,158
我们需要我们能找到的每一个人。
We need every man we can get.

606
00:46:05,202 --> 00:46:08,074
哦，所以你知道我们的人都要
Oh, so you do realize that our men are freezing to death

607
00:46:08,118 --> 00:46:09,554
在俄罗斯前线冻死了？
on the Russian front?

608
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:11,469
他们带着荣耀牺牲。
They are dying with honor.

609
00:46:11,512 --> 00:46:12,426
不是没有意义的。
It's not for nothing.

610
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,213
不，这只是个盲目的妄想。
No, it's for blind delusion.

611
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:17,954
你说完了吗？
Are we finished?

612
00:46:17,997 --> 00:46:20,347
我能走了吗？
May I go now?


613
00:46:20,391 --> 00:46:22,088
卢茨，等等。
Lutz, wait.

614
00:46:22,132 --> 00:46:28,834
你母亲为了活命用她身躯的每一部分战斗。
Your mother fought for her life with every part of her being.

615
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:30,488
她不会想看到你随随便便牺牲的。
She wouldn't want to see you throw away yours.

616
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,102
你必须戴上能帮助你避免战争，
You wear the mask that gets you through the war,

617
00:46:36,146 --> 00:46:36,973
帮你活命的面具。
that helps you survive.

618
00:46:39,627 --> 00:46:42,369
你要是不爱德国，如果你没准备好牺牲性命
Why did you fight for Germany if you don't love it?

619
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:43,588
那你为什么要替国家打仗？
If you weren't prepared to die.

620
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:45,851
卢茨，别随便给我戴帽子。
Don't judge me, Lutz.

621
00:46:45,895 --> 00:46:47,157
你跟我当时一样。
You are just as I was.

622
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,768
我能为了德国死上10多次。
I would have died for Germany 10 times over.

623
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:52,858
别人那时候做出了这样的牺牲。
Others made that sacrifice then.

624
00:46:52,902 --> 00:46:54,425
他们现在也会如此。
And they will make it now.

625
00:46:54,468 --> 00:46:55,078
就让他们去吧。
Let them.

626
00:46:58,124 --> 00:47:01,519
卢茨，我首先是你的父亲。
Lutz, I am your father first of all.

627
00:47:01,562 --> 00:47:03,086
你懂我的意思吗？
Do you understand?

628
00:47:03,129 --> 00:47:04,522
不，我不懂。
No, I don't.

629
00:47:04,565 --> 00:47:06,829
你想让我理解你的感受，但你不愿意
You want me to feel as you feel, but you don't want

630
00:47:06,872 --> 00:47:08,656
我像你一样出战。
me to fight like you fought.

631
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,267
你想让我有独立的想法，
You want me to have an independent mind,

632
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,616
但如果跟你的相背，你就不乐意了。
but not if it goes against yours.

633
00:47:14,662 --> 00:47:16,360
我应该是谁？
Who should I be?

634
00:47:16,403 --> 00:47:17,883
我应该成为你，还是不？
Should I be you or not?

635
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,324
你不是个英雄。
You are not a hero.

636
00:47:24,368 --> 00:47:25,369
我也不是。
And neither am I.

637
00:48:02,928 --> 00:48:04,712
我们今天不能去山顶了。
We can't go to the hilltop today.

638
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,323
我得想办法回家。
I have to try to get back home.

639
00:48:06,366 --> 00:48:07,063
你应该等等
You should wait.

640
00:48:07,106 --> 00:48:08,107
哪里都是他们的人。
They'll be everywhere.

641
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:08,803
等？
Wait?

642
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,112
把这个戴上。
Put this on.

643
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:18,422
戴上，快点！
Come on, quick!

644
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:19,075
蕾娜！
Leyna!

645
00:48:29,737 --> 00:48:32,218
我们要去哪？
Where are we going?

646
00:48:32,262 --> 00:48:34,046
一个安全的地方。
Somewhere safe.

647
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,396
等到事情都平息了。
Until things calm down.


648
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,181
我父亲，他昨天去慕尼黑了。
My father, he left for Munich yesterday.

649
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:48,669
坐下。
Sit down.

650
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:54,806
你饿吗？
Are you hungry?

651
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,808
不，谢谢。
No, thanks.

652
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,724
渴吗？
Thirsty?

653
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:00,594
我也不。
Me neither.

654
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:12,998
谢谢你。
Thank you.

655
00:49:13,042 --> 00:49:14,826
谢什么？
What for?

656
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:15,479
你做我的朋友
Being my friend.

657
00:49:20,788 --> 00:49:21,702
我想喝点水。
I will have some water.

658
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,333
你妈妈，她看起来很善良。
Your mother, she looked kind.

659
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:51,428
你一定很想她。
You must miss her terribly.

660
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:57,434
我父亲，他之前经常为她落泪。
My father, he used to cry a lot.

661
00:49:57,477 --> 00:49:58,304
那是最可怕的。
That was the worst.

662
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:04,136
我只有一张我父亲的照片。
I only have one photograph of my father.

663
00:50:09,054 --> 00:50:10,229
我想给你看点东西。
I want to show you something.

664
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,120
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

665
00:50:31,163 --> 00:50:31,816
我告诉你了。
I told you.

666
00:50:39,476 --> 00:50:41,086
这是他最常放的。
This one he likes to play most often.

667
00:50:44,437 --> 00:50:47,614
比利假日酒店，“让我们开心吧。”

668
00:50:54,056 --> 00:50:58,103
我们要是在友好的环境下，
When we're in a friendly situation, my

669
00:50:58,147 --> 00:51:02,629
我的话语也许听起来不这么悦耳。
conversation may not be smart.

670
00:51:02,673 --> 00:51:07,547
但如果我们能彼此理解，
But if we're to have a perfect understanding,

671
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:08,983
我们就叫它将心比心吧。
let's call a heart a heart.

672
00:51:09,027 --> 00:51:11,986
她去世后，每当我听到这个音乐
After she died I would hear this music

673
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:14,989
我就会告诉自己，我要是使足够劲
and I would tell myself if I looked hard

674
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:17,122
往门缝里看
enough through the crack in the door

675
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:21,431
我就能看到她在这里，和我父亲一起跳舞。
I would catch her in here, dancing with my father.

676
00:51:21,474 --> 00:51:26,088
如果我告诉你我梦中的需求，
If I tell you what my dreams have been demanding,

677
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:30,309
我们就叫它将心比心吧。
let's call a heart a heart.

678
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:32,355
我们可以跳舞。
We can dance.

679
00:51:32,398 --> 00:51:36,272
我能用一句话
Can I prove how I yearn

680
00:51:36,315 --> 00:51:40,798
来表达我的渴望吗？
just by the turn of a phrase?

681
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:50,329
当我的灵魂燃烧时，我还能控制自己吗？
Can I keep my control when all my soul is aflame?

682
00:51:50,373 --> 00:51:56,161
也许你会称某人为真正的
Maybe you would call a true
 confession and indiscretion

683
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:58,946
忏悔和轻率。
on someone's part.

684
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:05,562
但如果我要说我多么疯狂地崇拜你，让我们称之为一颗心
But if I'm to say how madly I adore you, let's call a heart--

685
00:52:14,179 --> 00:52:16,616
嘘。
Shh.

686
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,836
是詹恩，做家具的
It's Jann, the furniture maker.

687
00:52:18,879 --> 00:52:20,185
没关系，他看不见你。
It's all right, he can't see you.

688
00:52:20,229 --> 00:52:21,447
他几乎是个瞎子。
He's almost blind.

689
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:23,667
只能看见形状，如果你离得非常近他也许也会看到。
Its only shapes, or if you're really close.

690
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,669
他想干什么？
What do you think he wants?

691
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,584
我父亲给他提供工作。
My father gives him work.

692
00:52:27,627 --> 00:52:29,629
他大概是把一些工具落在后面了。
He probably left some tools in the back.

693
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:35,113
他走了。
He's leaving.

694
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:44,209
柏林现在应该清除干净了。
Berlin is supposed to be clear by now.

695
00:52:44,253 --> 00:52:47,430
我想这就是今天有这么多行动的原因了。
I think that's why there's so many actions today.

696
00:52:47,473 --> 00:52:49,171
你不用害怕。
You don't have to be scared.

697
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:50,911
“清除干净？”
"Clear?"

698
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:53,087
没有犹太人了。
Of all Jews.

699
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:55,916
我听到我父亲走之前说的。
I heard my father talking before he left.

700
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,309
去年为了元首的生日，
For the Fuhrer's birthday last year,

701
00:52:57,353 --> 00:52:59,529
柏林得清空犹太人。
Berlin was to be clear of Jews.

702
00:52:59,572 --> 00:53:01,357
但犹太人和德国人结婚了，那些混血的犹太人，
But the Jews married to Germans and the half Jews,

703
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,053
他们还在。
they still remain.

704
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:08,451
他们把这些“清除”到哪里？
Where do they "clear" them to?

705
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:10,453
应该是波兰。
Poland, I think.

706
00:53:10,496 --> 00:53:13,195
那里的劳动营。
Camps for labor.

707
00:53:13,238 --> 00:53:14,805
与其让他们坐在那计划推翻我们
Better they work for Germany than sitting here plotting

708
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:16,110
还不如让他们给我们干活。
and planning against us.

709
00:53:20,854 --> 00:53:21,681
这不简单，你知道吗。
It's hard, you know.

710
00:53:25,729 --> 00:53:28,035

不会一直这样的。

为什么问？

717
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:23,542
你给我看的那个杂志上的女人
That woman you showed me on the magazine--

718
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,979
她是美国人。

719
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:26,632
所以呢？

725
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:06,280
什么事？
Do what?

别说话，蕾娜。
Be quiet, Leyna.

734
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:45,450
你想你从来没有过像抚摸我一样
I don't think that you ever touched anyone the way

735
00:56:45,494 --> 00:56:46,625
抚摸过任何人

736
00:56:51,935 --> 00:56:53,327
来，把这个穿上。

00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,861
希特勒万岁。
Heil Hitler.

743
00:57:48,905 --> 00:57:51,211
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

744
00:57:51,255 --> 00:57:53,518
我…我从特雷普托拿点书。
I'm-- I'm collecting some books from Treptow.

你不能在白天做？

747
00:57:56,913 --> 00:57:58,523
就在晚上晃来晃去？

748
00:57:58,567 --> 00:58:00,003
鲁茨：我刚从训练回来。

750
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,267
嘿!

752
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,966
我住在科佩尼克。
I live in Koppenick.

753
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:07,619
威斯穆勒的儿子？

754
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:15,801
走吧，快走，待会儿你就得被抓了。
Go on, get on your way,
 before you get arrested.

755
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:24,593
蕾娜！
Leyna!

756
00:58:24,636 --> 00:58:25,289
蕾娜！
Leyna!

757
00:58:29,598 --> 00:58:31,600
我等你进去了。
I'll wait until you get inside.

758
00:58:31,643 --> 00:58:34,559
卢茨。
Lutz.

759
00:58:34,603 --> 00:58:35,342
我们今天做的
What we did today--

760
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:40,347
你以前做过吗？
did you ever do that before?

761
00:58:43,481 --> 00:58:45,744
没有。
No.

762
00:59:44,803 --> 00:59:46,631
从今天开始
From here on, you will not leave

763
00:59:46,675 --> 00:59:48,154
我要是不跟着你，不要离开屋子
the house unless I'm with you.

764
00:59:48,198 --> 00:59:51,201
你证明了你不能被信任。
You've shown you can't be trusted.

765
00:59:51,244 --> 00:59:53,595
你可能被逮捕的。

766
00:59:53,638 --> 00:59:54,944
我不是犹太人。
I'm not Jewish.

767

00:59:56,249 --> 00:59:59,078
但你也不是雅利安人，蕾娜。

769
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:01,951
我们最后都得为你的错误负责。
We'll all have to pay for your mistakes in the end.

770
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:04,910
我，你，甚至是科恩。
Me, you, even Koen.

771
01:00:07,696 --> 01:00:09,088
我们都得负责。
We'll all have to pay.

772
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,878
你只会指责我的错误
You speak of nothing but mistakes,

773
01:00:15,921 --> 01:00:18,663
那你自己犯过的错呢？
but who's paying for yours?

774
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:29,587
这正是为什么我不会看着你把你的生命抛在一边。
And that's why I will not watch you throw your life away.

775
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:31,415
你不能再接近那个男孩了。

776
01:00:48,998 --> 01:00:51,043
我道歉。

01:00:51,087 --> 01:00:51,696
不好意思。
Excuse me.

778
01:00:59,225 --> 01:01:00,749
你！
You!

779
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:03,229
停下。
Stop.

780
01:01:03,273 --> 01:01:04,187
停下！
Halt!

781
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:04,927
现在！
Now!

782
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:07,494
停下，蕾娜。
Stop, Leyna.

783
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:08,278
我们必须停下。
We have to stop.

784
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:13,805
待在这。
Stay here.

785
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:19,637
你们两个！
Both of you!

786
01:01:19,681 --> 01:01:22,161
妈妈，我没有绝育的文件。

没有身份证件。

01:01:23,423 --> 01:01:24,033
我会解释。
I will explain.

789
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:39,831
这是你的杂种？
Your bastard?

790
01:01:39,875 --> 01:01:40,527
我的女儿。
My daughter.

791
01:01:43,443 --> 01:01:46,142
你的黑鬼杂种。
Your Negro bastard.

792
01:01:49,014 --> 01:01:51,756
你在工厂工作？
You're at the factory?

793
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:53,758
文件呢？
Papers?

是。

797
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,549
这里。
Here.

798
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,160
她的文件？

799
01:02:04,203 --> 01:02:05,117
是。
Yes.

800
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:07,032
告诉我
Tell me--

801
01:02:07,076 --> 01:02:12,211
当你羞辱德国的时侯，你心里在想什么？
What was in your heart when you were shaming Germany?


802
01:02:12,255 --> 01:02:13,735
我从来没有羞辱德国。

803
01:02:17,173 --> 01:02:18,870
她的文件！

01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:22,831
你是德国的耻辱。

闭上你的嘴。

01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:32,841
黑人的妓女。

01:02:32,884 --> 01:02:34,146
你迷失了。

809
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:40,326
忘了做一个优秀德国女人是什么感觉。
Forgotten what it is to be a good German woman.

810
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:44,113
你觉得你迷失了吗？
Do you think you are lost?

811
01:02:44,156 --> 01:02:47,812
我没有。
I am not lost.

812
01:02:47,856 --> 01:02:52,251
也许确实不必永远迷失。

813
01:02:52,295 --> 01:02:57,430
那么告诉我，你要怎样成为一个优秀的德国女人？

814
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:04,829
你要扔掉你的猴子。

815
01:03:04,873 --> 01:03:05,830
妈妈。
Mama.

816
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:10,835
什么？
What?

817
01:03:10,879 --> 01:03:12,837
我们把她带走或者把你带走。
We take her or we take you.

818
01:03:15,231 --> 01:03:16,710
- 不不不！ - 蕾娜：妈妈！
- No, no, no!   - Mama!

819
01:03:16,754 --> 01:03:18,016
求你了！求你了！
Please! Please!

820
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:18,887
求你了，我求求你！

821
01:03:18,930 --> 01:03:19,888
不，求求你！

822
01:03:19,931 --> 01:03:20,671
求求你！

824
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:22,978
闭嘴！
Be quiet!

825
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:26,285
把我带走！
Take me!

826
01:03:27,504 --> 01:03:28,200
不！
No!

827
01:03:28,244 --> 01:03:28,940
妈妈！

828
01:03:28,984 --> 01:03:29,941
不！
No!

829
01:03:29,985 --> 01:03:31,987
你不许哭。

830
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:33,640
你不能哭。

831
01:03:48,917 --> 01:03:51,180
妈妈。

832
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:52,834
妈妈！
Mama!

833
01:03:57,447 --> 01:03:58,056
妈妈！
Mama!

834
01:04:06,369 --> 01:04:09,067
她为什么没告诉我？
Why didn't she tell me?

835
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:12,418
她连再见都没说。
She didn't even say goodbye.

836
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:16,161
她让我替她说再见。
She told me to say goodbye for her.

837
01:04:16,205 --> 01:04:21,210
这份工作会给她丰厚的薪水，而且我们不必等太久。
This work, it will pay her good money and it won't be for long.

838
01:04:21,253 --> 01:04:22,776
多久？
How long?

839
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:23,429
我不知道。
I don't know.

840
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:34,049
但她爱我们。
But she loves us.

841
01:04:34,092 --> 01:04:39,184
你不会离开你爱的人太久的。
And you can't be away from people you love for very long.

842
01:04:39,228 --> 01:04:47,192
所以现在，我知道，就在此刻，

843
01:04:47,236 --> 01:04:52,937
她在尽可能努力回来。

844
01:04:52,981 --> 01:04:56,027
我可以和她一起去的。
I could have gone with her.

845
01:04:56,071 --> 01:04:57,333
不，你不能。
No, you couldn't.


846
01:05:07,691 --> 01:05:08,431
打扰一下，先生？
Excuse me, Herr?

847
01:05:17,701 --> 01:05:19,790
我是恩格尔先生。

848
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,575
我刚要去找卢茨和他父亲。

849
01:05:25,491 --> 01:05:27,319
我不确定他是不是还在慕尼黑。

850
01:05:27,363 --> 01:05:28,538
他回来了。

851
01:05:28,581 --> 01:05:30,105
哦。
Oh.

852
01:05:30,148 --> 01:05:32,368
卢茨你已经错过了。
Lutz you missed already.

853
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:34,283
他被召去履行义务了。

854
01:05:34,326 --> 01:05:37,286
一天前。
One day ago.

855
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:38,896
义务？
Duty?

856
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,681
本来以为还有一个月时间
Thought he had one month but they came for him

857
01:05:41,725 --> 01:05:43,248
但他们昨天一大早就找到他了。

858
01:05:43,292 --> 01:05:45,424
把他送去东边了。

859
01:05:45,468 --> 01:05:47,122
没有提前预警。
No warning.

860
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:49,994
他到时侯了。
It was his time.

861
01:05:50,038 --> 01:05:53,737
希望我的时候还能再来。
Wish it was mine again.

862
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:56,914
柏林除了女人和老男人，什么也没有。
Nothing in Berlin except women and old men.

863
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,089
哼。
Huh.

864
01:05:58,133 --> 01:06:01,701
还有藏起来的犹太人。
And hiding Jews.

865
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:23,071
你之前说一个人不能离开
Is it true you can't be away from people

866
01:06:23,114 --> 01:06:27,075
爱的人太久，是真的吗？
you love for very long?

867
01:06:27,118 --> 01:06:27,989
当然是。
Of course it is.

868
01:06:58,106 --> 01:06:58,758
科恩？
Koen?

869
01:07:05,113 --> 01:07:05,722
过来。
Come.

870
01:07:16,385 --> 01:07:17,299
文件。
Papers.

871
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:18,300
身份证明。
Identity papers.

872
01:07:18,343 --> 01:07:19,953
发生什么了？
What's happening?

873
01:07:19,997 --> 01:07:21,912
我想他们要把我们搬到发动机工厂。
I think they're moving us to the engine factory.

874
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:22,652
文件。
Papers.

875
01:07:29,267 --> 01:07:30,051
是什么？
What is it?

876
01:07:30,094 --> 01:07:30,877
发生什么了？
What's happening?

877
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,314
他们在找什么？
Who are they looking for?

878
01:07:32,357 --> 01:07:33,097
把她带走
Take her away.

879
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:40,322
文件。
Papers.

880
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:45,283
他们在查每个人的文件。
They're checking everyone's papers.

881
01:08:05,216 --> 01:08:06,435
看，看！
Look, look!

882
01:08:06,478 --> 01:08:07,697
一个女的跑走了！
A woman is running away!

883
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:08,872
抓住她！
Get her!

884
01:08:08,915 --> 01:08:11,004
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

885
01:08:11,048 --> 01:08:12,310
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

886
01:08:21,754 --> 01:08:22,494
快点。
Quickly.

887
01:08:22,538 --> 01:08:24,366
进去。
Get in.

888
01:08:45,213 --> 01:08:45,865
闭嘴。
Shut up.

889
01:08:51,262 --> 01:08:53,221
闭嘴！
Shut up!

890
01:08:53,264 --> 01:08:55,875
下一个。
Next.

891
01:08:55,919 --> 01:08:56,746
快点。
Hurry up.

892
01:09:06,886 --> 01:09:07,670
过来。
Come here.

893
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:19,508
你是个混血？
You're a mischling?

894
01:09:19,551 --> 01:09:21,423
是。
Yes.

895
01:09:21,466 --> 01:09:22,946
我母亲是雅利安人。
My mother is Aryan.

896
01:09:22,989 --> 01:09:24,034
绝育了？
Sterilized?

897
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,253
是。
Yes.


898
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:26,384
我在鲁德谢姆绝育了
I was sterilized in Rudesheim--

899
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:28,691
莱茵兰。
The Rhineland.

900
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:30,867
你母亲没有帮到你什么忙。
Your mother did you no favors.

901
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:34,305
是她让你变成了一个黑鬼。
She rendered you a Neger.

902
01:09:34,349 --> 01:09:37,569
别以为她的纯种有多了不起
Don't cling to her purity because she

903
01:09:37,613 --> 01:09:38,788
以为她没把你也变成纯种。
didn't care to make you pure.

904
01:09:47,275 --> 01:09:47,884
吉普赛？
Gypsy?

905
01:09:50,713 --> 01:09:51,322
你是个法国人？
You a Partisan?

906
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:56,284
不。
No.

907
01:09:56,327 --> 01:09:56,980
我爱德国。
I love Germany.

908
01:10:05,162 --> 01:10:07,382
但他们把我母亲和我的文件带走了。
But they took my mother and my papers.

909
01:10:11,212 --> 01:10:15,303
他们说祖国没有黑人这种东西。
They say there is no such thing as a Negro of the Fatherland.

910
01:10:15,346 --> 01:10:16,217
那你怎么看？
And what do you say?

911
01:10:19,263 --> 01:10:19,872
我觉得
I say--

912
01:10:24,312 --> 01:10:25,182
我觉得我是德国人。
I say I am German.

913
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,111
站到这里。
Stand here.

914
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,669
我会给你做
I am going to do for you

915
01:11:17,713 --> 01:11:19,323
你母亲不能给你做的事。
what your mother couldn't.

916
01:11:19,367 --> 01:11:21,586
我会给你一次活下去的机会，
I am going to give you a chance for life,

917
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,241
因为毕竟不是你玷染了德国种族。
because it was not you who defiled the German race.

918
01:11:24,285 --> 01:11:27,723
你只是恶心的结果罢了。
You are merely the sickening produce.

919
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:30,247
你会在厨房工作。
You will work in the kitchen.

920
01:11:30,291 --> 01:11:32,771
你吃我们你给的饭一点也不能多。
You will eat the food you are given and no more.

921
01:11:32,815 --> 01:11:37,167
如果你试着占小便宜，你会提前死
If you take advantage, you will die before your time,

922
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,386
就像你母亲本应那样。
as your mother should have.

923
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,853
你在我的床铺上。
You are in my bunk.

924
01:12:10,896 --> 01:12:13,203
哦，闭嘴，黑鬼。
Oh, hush, Negro.

925
01:12:13,246 --> 01:12:15,118
你觉得你比我高一等？
You think you are better than me?

926
01:12:15,161 --> 01:12:16,685
你省口劲儿吧。
Spare your energy.

927
01:12:16,728 --> 01:12:18,600
你不在那边的老鼠房里已经很幸运了
You are only lucky you are not in the rat house over there

928
01:12:18,643 --> 01:12:19,296
像个...
like--

929
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:20,428
你觉得我是犹太人？
You think I am Jewish?

930
01:12:20,471 --> 01:12:22,647
我只想在我妹妹旁边睡。
All I want is to sleep near my sister.


931
01:12:22,691 --> 01:12:25,868
但像你这样的非洲野蛮人不会懂的。
But an African savage like you wouldn't understand.

932
01:12:25,911 --> 01:12:28,436
你为了活命能吃掉你母亲。
You would eat your own mother to keep alive.

933
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:31,264
只有傻瓜睡在那底下
Only a fool sleeps down there where they piss and empty

934
01:12:31,308 --> 01:12:33,441
别人都往你头上拉撒。
themselves on you from above.

935
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:34,920
行吧，你可以睡我的床铺。
Well you can sleep in my bunk.

936
01:12:41,405 --> 01:12:42,928
睡在这里的那些女孩呢？
Where are the girls that sleep here?

937
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:46,062
去医务室了。
Infirmary.

938
01:12:46,105 --> 01:12:46,932
他们回不来了。
They won't be back.

939
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:55,027
那些鞋会给你惹麻烦的。
Those shoes will cause you trouble.

940
01:12:55,071 --> 01:12:56,028
我知道，但它们很结实。
I know but they are strong.

941
01:12:59,815 --> 01:13:01,033
那下面伤寒肆虐。
Down there is ripe for typhus.

942
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:06,038
我受够了被排挤了。
I'm tired of being pushed out.

943
01:13:13,524 --> 01:13:16,135
你肚子是圆的。
Your stomach is round.

944
01:13:16,179 --> 01:13:17,441
我在洗澡间里看见过。
I've seen it in the wash barracks.

945
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:29,192
你知道那里面发生些什么事儿吗？
Do you know what happens in there?

946
01:13:32,413 --> 01:13:33,631
哪里？
Where?

947
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:34,980
犹太老鼠房。
The Jewish rat house.

948
01:13:47,123 --> 01:13:48,951
这空气我呼吸不了。
I can't breathe with this air.

949
01:15:23,045 --> 01:15:27,397
我怎样才能证明我的向往
How can I prove how I yearn

950
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,402
只是一个短语的转折？
just by the turn of a phrase?

951
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:39,278
当我所有的灵魂都燃烧起来时，我能保持控制吗？
Can I keep control when all my soul is aflame?

952
01:15:43,021 --> 01:15:48,940
但如果我要说我多么疯狂地崇拜你，
But if I'm to say how madly I adore you,

953
01:15:48,984 --> 01:15:50,594
让我们称呼一颗心。
let's call a heart a heart.

954
01:16:19,623 --> 01:16:20,363
给，拿我的吧。
Here, take mine.

955
01:16:24,759 --> 01:16:26,935
拿着。
Take it.

956
01:16:26,978 --> 01:16:28,197
我在厨房里吃过了。
I ate in the kitchen.

957
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:42,472
赫敏，你的脚要烂了。
Your feet are rotting, Hermine.

958
01:16:51,002 --> 01:16:55,093
要是可以，我给你带一个土豆。
When I can, I'll bring you a potato.

959
01:16:55,137 --> 01:16:57,661
你可以用它来买鞋。
You can use it to buy shoes.

960
01:16:57,705 --> 01:16:58,314
好吗？
OK?

961
01:17:02,448 --> 01:17:07,497
昨天晚上，我吃了冰淇淋。
Last night, I ate ice cream.

962
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:13,416
甜甜的香草冰淇淋。
Sweet vanilla ice cream.


963
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:17,028
我在我母亲的怀抱里睡着了。
I was asleep in my mother's arms.

964
01:17:17,072 --> 01:17:20,075
我闻到了她皮肤的味道。
I smelt her skin.

965
01:17:20,118 --> 01:17:24,470
我感受到了她的心跳。
I felt her heart beat.

966
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,777
他们带走了她而不是我。
They took her instead of me.

967
01:17:26,821 --> 01:17:28,692
我永远不会原谅自己。
I will never forgive myself.

968
01:17:41,749 --> 01:17:44,012
我说我已经绝育了。
I have said that I am sterilized.

969
01:17:57,634 --> 01:18:00,332
赫敏，疼。
Hermine, it hurts.

970
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,420
你会习惯它的。
You will get used to it.

971
01:18:38,806 --> 01:18:39,415
站住！
Halt!

972
01:18:43,767 --> 01:18:45,334
你从哪来，要到哪去？
Where are you coming from and where are you going?

973
01:18:48,816 --> 01:18:52,994
先生，我从厨房来要回到我的营房。
Sir, I'm returning from kitchen duty to my barracks.

974
01:18:53,037 --> 01:18:54,996
你从厨房拿了食物。
You carry food from the kitchen.

975
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:56,824
交出来。
Hand it over.

976
01:18:56,867 --> 01:18:58,086
先生。
Sir.

977
01:18:58,129 --> 01:18:58,782
把你的衣服脱掉。
Take off your clothes.

978
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,482
赶紧！
Hurry up!

979
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:10,098
快点。
Come on.

980
01:19:10,141 --> 01:19:11,229
你想被打死吗？
Do you want to be shot?

981
01:19:20,108 --> 01:19:21,631
把你的衣服脱掉。
Take off your clothes.

982
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:22,458
现在。
Now.

983
01:19:22,501 --> 01:19:23,111
喂!
Hey!

984
01:19:29,987 --> 01:19:31,641
她做了什么？
What has she done?

985
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:33,121
黑人杂种。
Negermischling.

986
01:19:33,164 --> 01:19:35,253
你之前见过吗？
You seen one before?

987
01:19:35,297 --> 01:19:38,082
从厨房偷东西。
Thieving from the kitchen.

988
01:19:38,126 --> 01:19:40,258
看她哆嗦的。
See how she shakes.

989
01:19:40,302 --> 01:19:41,477
她在藏食物。
She's hiding food.

990
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:54,359
我想处置她。
I should like to deal with her.

991
01:19:54,403 --> 01:20:03,064
她…她太卑鄙了。
She-- She is miserable.

992
01:20:03,107 --> 01:20:05,240
让我带走她
Let me take her.

993
01:20:05,283 --> 01:20:09,853
我想搜她的营房。
I want to search her barracks.

994
01:20:09,897 --> 01:20:12,160
继续吧。
Go ahead.

995
01:20:12,203 --> 01:20:13,596
如果你受得了这黑人的恶臭。
If you can stand the Neger's stench.

996
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:26,348
蕾娜。
Leyna.

997
01:20:44,627 --> 01:20:45,236
等等。
Wait.

998
01:20:50,589 --> 01:20:51,199
停下！
Stop!

999
01:20:58,293 --> 01:20:59,555
你睡哪里？
Where do you sleep?

1000
01:21:02,906 --> 01:21:04,038
我们得走。
We have to walk.

1001
01:21:04,081 --> 01:21:04,777
你的住所在哪？
Where is your block?

1002
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,222
我们睡在同一个营房。
We sleep in the same barracks.

1003
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:15,440
她能和我回去吗？
Can she return with me?

1004
01:21:37,375 --> 01:21:38,420
你那里有食物吗？
Do you have food in there?

1005
01:22:15,065 --> 01:22:15,718
过来。
Come.

1006
01:22:22,029 --> 01:22:22,725
你脸色看起来很苍白。
You look pale.

1007
01:22:22,768 --> 01:22:23,726
你生病了吗？
Are you sick?

1008
01:22:23,769 --> 01:22:24,945
没有。
No.


1009
01:22:24,988 --> 01:22:26,903
你离犯人远一点。
You stay away from the prisoners.

1010
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:28,644
集中营泛滥了，我们跟不上了。
Camp is riddled, we can't keep up.

1011
01:22:34,389 --> 01:22:37,435
你为什么把我带过来？
Why did you bring me here?

1012
01:22:37,479 --> 01:22:39,002
就为了和你待一起吗？
Was it just to be with you?

1013
01:22:39,046 --> 01:22:41,309
这很糟糕吗？
Well is that so bad?

1014
01:22:41,352 --> 01:22:44,051
现在，犹太人在给别人贿赂食物
Right now, the Jews are bribing each other with food just

1015
01:22:44,094 --> 01:22:46,618
只为了离一个自己爱的人近一些
to be close to a loved one.

1016
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:47,837
无论你打仗还是在这里，
Whether you fight or you are here,

1017
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,056
你周围尽是死亡。
you are surrounded by death.

1018
01:22:49,099 --> 01:22:51,493
但至少在这里没人朝你开枪。
At least here you're not being shot at.

1019
01:22:51,536 --> 01:22:53,103
只要你穿着制服
And no one can doubt your loyalty

1020
01:22:53,147 --> 01:22:53,974
没人能怀疑你的忠诚。
if you wear the uniform.

1021
01:22:58,195 --> 01:23:01,372
“戴上能让你避免战争
"You wear the mask that will get you through the war

1022
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:02,417
让你存活的面具”。
and allow you to survive."

1023
01:23:14,429 --> 01:23:16,474
这个煮过了。
It's cooked.

1024
01:23:16,518 --> 01:23:19,216
能帮你弄到一双好鞋。
I will get you good shoes.

1025
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:21,479
到明天之前，我觉得我得帮你保管。
I think I should look after it for you until tomorrow.

1026
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:34,797
来吃一小口。
Have a small bite.

1027
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,364
但就一口，不然你得被自己气死。
But just one or you'll be furious with yourself.

1028
01:24:56,922 --> 01:24:57,923
他需要一个年轻健壮的人。
He needs someone young and strong.

1029
01:24:57,967 --> 01:24:59,142
跟他去
Go with him.

1030
01:25:08,412 --> 01:25:09,674
你必须跟我说话。
You have to talk to me.

1031
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:22,122
你怎么到这里的？
How did you get here?

1032
01:25:25,821 --> 01:25:28,040
你母亲呢？
What about your mother?

1033
01:25:28,084 --> 01:25:28,650
弟弟？
Brother?

1034
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:34,699
那卢茨呢？
What about Lutz?

1035
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:35,570
他怎么了？
What happened to him?

1036
01:25:42,533 --> 01:25:43,752
我被叫过来了。
I was called.

1037
01:25:43,795 --> 01:25:46,929
我没有时间。
I had no time.

1038
01:25:46,972 --> 01:25:50,150
我不知道怎么给你传信。
I didn't know how to get word to you.

1039
01:25:50,193 --> 01:25:52,282
我以为他们会派我打仗。
I thought they would send me to fight.

1040
01:25:55,894 --> 01:25:59,202
但他们把我送到了个集中营。
Instead they sent me to a camp.

1041
01:25:59,246 --> 01:26:00,290
东边。
East.


1042
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:09,430
整天都是皮肤和骨头的味道。
All day the smell of skin and bone.

1043
01:26:09,473 --> 01:26:10,692
我受不了。
I can't bear it.

1044
01:26:16,915 --> 01:26:18,352
你在那样的地方工作过？
You have worked in a place like that?

1045
01:26:18,395 --> 01:26:19,048
没有。
No.

1046
01:26:22,225 --> 01:26:24,880
但我见过被选到去那边工作的犹太人。
But I have seen Jews selected to work in them.

1047
01:26:31,930 --> 01:26:35,195
去杀人房间。
In the killing rooms.

1048
01:26:35,238 --> 01:26:36,457
去杀别的犹太人？
To kill other Jews?

1049
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,812
不会有幸存者的。
But there will be none left.

1050
01:26:49,209 --> 01:26:50,819
毒气不会停下来的。
The smoke never stops.

1051
01:26:54,518 --> 01:26:55,780
不，它不会。
No, it doesn't.

1052
01:27:03,745 --> 01:27:06,008
我想让它停下，但我不知道该怎么办。
I want to make it stop but I don't know how.

1053
01:27:10,186 --> 01:27:11,274
你为什么盯着我？
Why are you staring at me?

1054
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:17,759
你看起来有变化。
You look changed.

1055
01:27:25,723 --> 01:27:28,596
公共厕所。
The latrines.

1056
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,120
我晚上会在附近值班。
I'll be on duty nearby tonight.

1057
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:31,860
找我。
Meet me.

1058
01:27:31,903 --> 01:27:33,035
我会带食物来。
I'll bring food.

1059
01:27:33,078 --> 01:27:34,558
不。
No.

1060
01:27:34,602 --> 01:27:37,996
你必须吃东西，蕾娜。
You need to eat, Leyna.

1061
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:40,216
我还没有收到你的命令。
I haven't received the order from you.

1062
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,609
什么命令？
Which order?

1063
01:27:41,652 --> 01:27:43,959
清除孩子。
Clearing the children.

1064
01:27:44,002 --> 01:27:45,482
在指挥官缺席的情况下，
In the absence of the Commandant,

1065
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,963
需要你的签名。
it needs your signature.

1066
01:27:48,006 --> 01:27:49,791
我还有更要紧的顾虑。
I've had more urgent concerns.

1067
01:27:49,834 --> 01:27:51,619
你要是没发现，我们缺了60辆坦克
In case you haven't noticed, we're 60

1068
01:27:51,662 --> 01:27:53,403
马上就要输掉战争了。
tanks short of losing the war.

1069
01:27:53,447 --> 01:27:55,753
是，我对把感染了的尸体留给美国人
Yes, and I'm not interested in leaving diseased corpses

1070
01:27:55,797 --> 01:27:56,537
也不感兴趣。
for the Americans to find.

1071
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:57,451
你呢？
Are you?

1072
01:28:04,849 --> 01:28:10,202
你知道为什么你总是这么多传言的起因吗？
Do you know why you were always the cause of so many rumors?

1073
01:28:10,246 --> 01:28:13,858
你说不了你到底在想什么
Your inability to say what's going on in your mind

1074
01:28:13,902 --> 01:28:15,947
和你对伙伴的选择。
and your choice of company.

1075
01:28:15,991 --> 01:28:19,995
总是这么可疑。
Dubious, always.

1076
01:28:20,038 --> 01:28:21,605
你的朋友，俾斯麦宰相，
Your friend,
 Bismarck Schonhausen,

1077
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:23,999
在柏林被逮捕了

1078
01:28:24,042 --> 01:28:27,742
和15个人一起密谋与元首作对。
plotting against the Fuhrer, with 15 others.

1079
01:28:27,785 --> 01:28:29,744
他应该像狗一样被绞死。
He should be hanged like a dog.

1080
01:28:29,787 --> 01:28:32,921
他的儿子也一样，如果他们还有脑子的话。
So should his son, if they have any sense.

1081
01:28:32,964 --> 01:28:37,708
出于父亲的罪过之类的。
Sins of the father and such.

1082
01:28:37,752 --> 01:28:43,105
你说他拜访过你家多少次？
How many times would you say he visited your home?

1083
01:28:43,148 --> 01:28:45,325
跟你差不多，尤特纳。
About as many times as you, Juttner.

1084
01:29:11,394 --> 01:29:12,482
你昨天没来。
You didn't come yesterday.

1085
01:29:19,663 --> 01:29:20,490
我给你带了这个。
I brought you this.

1086
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,851
和一些食物。
And some food.

1087
01:29:33,895 --> 01:29:35,940
先生，这个东西被发现在集中营里，
Sir, this was found in the camp,

1088
01:29:35,984 --> 01:29:38,334
和囚犯的首饰一起。
amongst jewelry from the prisoners.

1089
01:29:38,378 --> 01:29:42,033
是个威斯穆勒指环，是吧？
It is a Weissmuller ring, isn't it?

1090
01:29:42,077 --> 01:29:42,860
谢谢你，彼特。
Thank you, Peter.

1091
01:29:42,904 --> 01:29:43,513
你可以走了。
You can go.

1092
01:29:57,484 --> 01:30:00,443
我脏死了。
I'm filthy.

1093
01:30:00,487 --> 01:30:01,096
让我抱你
Let me hold you.

1094
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:23,161
你为什么那样呼吸？
Why do you breathe like that?

1095
01:30:23,205 --> 01:30:24,075
我冷。
I'm cold.

1096
01:31:06,422 --> 01:31:07,031
蕾娜？
Leyna?

1097
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:11,383
嗯。
Yes.

1098
01:31:19,653 --> 01:31:21,263
我上次抱你是六个月前。
I last held you six months ago.

1099
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,842
蕾娜，你怕我吗？
Leyna, you are afraid of me?

1100
01:31:37,932 --> 01:31:39,803
有人这样伤害过你吗？
Did someone hurt you this way?

1101
01:31:46,593 --> 01:31:47,811
这是我做的吗？
Did we do this together?

1102
01:32:48,393 --> 01:32:49,264
跟我一起走。
Walk with me.

1103
01:33:46,756 --> 01:33:49,541
这不是战争。
This isn't war.

1104
01:33:49,585 --> 01:33:50,760
伤害普通人。
Harming ordinary people.

1105
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:55,547
这不是一个士兵该做的事。
It isn't what a soldier does.

1106
01:33:55,591 --> 01:33:56,548
哼。
Hm.

1107
01:33:56,592 --> 01:33:58,768
你这么觉得？
You think so?

1108
01:33:58,812 --> 01:34:00,770
这正是一个士兵做的事，
That is precisely what a soldier does,

1109
01:34:00,814 --> 01:34:03,773
不论他愿不愿意。
whether he wants to or not.

1110
01:34:03,817 --> 01:34:06,907
这就是战争。
That is war.

1111
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:12,042
我跟你说过，你的选择决定你的生死。
I told you your choices would keep you alive or see you dead.


1112
01:34:12,086 --> 01:34:14,131
你来了这里，所以你活着。
You came here, so you're alive.

1113
01:34:19,789 --> 01:34:22,966
那是你的选择。
Those were your options.

1114
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:25,447
选择生存或死亡。
Choose life or choose death.

1115
01:34:37,111 --> 01:34:41,028
你跟我说过，我们不是英雄。
You told me we are not heroes.

1116
01:34:41,071 --> 01:34:42,638
你应该说的是我们是懦夫。
What you should have said is that we are cowards.

1117
01:35:20,894 --> 01:35:22,243
起来。
Up.

1118
01:35:22,286 --> 01:35:23,635
起来！
Up!

1119
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:24,854
起床！
Get up!

1120
01:35:24,898 --> 01:35:25,637
马上！
Now!

1121
01:35:25,681 --> 01:35:28,205
快点！
Come on!

1122
01:35:28,249 --> 01:35:30,251
我的鞋呢？
Where are my shoes?

1123
01:35:30,294 --> 01:35:31,208
我的鞋呢？
Where are my shoes?

1124
01:35:36,779 --> 01:35:38,868
你拿了我的鞋吗？
Did you take my shoes?

1125
01:35:38,912 --> 01:35:39,869
你拿了她的鞋吗？
Did you take her shoes?

1126
01:35:39,913 --> 01:35:41,610
你拿了我的鞋吗？
Did you take my shoes?

1127
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:42,698
你拿了她的鞋吗？
Did you take her shoes?

1128
01:35:42,742 --> 01:35:44,569
我的鞋呢？
Where are my shoes?

1129
01:35:44,613 --> 01:35:45,788
- 我的鞋在哪里？ - 赫敏。
- Where are my shoes?   - Hermine.

1130
01:35:45,832 --> 01:35:46,702
我的鞋呢？
Where are my shoes?

1131
01:35:46,746 --> 01:35:47,529
赫敏，停下！
Hermine, stop it!

1132
01:35:47,572 --> 01:35:48,443
她死了！
She's dead!

1133
01:35:55,842 --> 01:35:59,976
贝兹，蕾娜。
Betz, Leyna.

1134
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:04,764
你知道他会对我做什么吗？
Do you know what he will do to me?

1135
01:36:04,807 --> 01:36:06,766
他是个杀人的猪。
He's a murdering pig.

1136
01:36:10,508 --> 01:36:14,338
我看到我的家人去你们叫老鼠房的地方。
I saw my family go to the place you call the rat house.

1137
01:36:17,515 --> 01:36:20,214
在那里，他们一个一个消失了。
Where, one by one they disappeared.

1138
01:36:24,958 --> 01:36:32,182
我母亲，她跟我说永远不要承认自己是个犹太人。
My mother, she told me never admit you are a Jew.

1139
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:38,275
那就是活着的方法。
That is how to stay alive.

1140
01:36:41,235 --> 01:36:45,717
蕾娜，我还活着。
I'm alive, Leyna.

1141
01:36:45,761 --> 01:36:49,591
我错过了毒气来这里劳作。
I missed the smoke and came here for labor.

1142
01:36:49,634 --> 01:36:50,853
赫敏。
Hermine.

1143
01:36:50,897 --> 01:36:58,252
现在，因为我没有鞋，我要死了。
And now, I will die because I have no shoes.

1144
01:36:58,295 --> 01:36:59,557
你不会死。
You will not die.

1145
01:37:39,554 --> 01:37:40,163
没有鞋？
Shoeless?

1146
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:45,429
为什么？
Why?

1147
01:37:45,473 --> 01:37:48,041
先生，我的鞋昨天晚上在营房里被拿走了。
Sir, my shoes were taken in the barracks during the night.

1148
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,046
威斯穆勒。
Weissmuller.

1149
01:37:53,089 --> 01:37:53,916
跟着我
Join me, will you?

1150
01:38:07,974 --> 01:38:08,583
打死她。
Shoot her.

1151
01:38:18,636 --> 01:38:19,507
打死她。
Shoot her.


1152
01:38:52,366 --> 01:38:53,454
你笑了？
Do you laugh?

1153
01:38:53,497 --> 01:38:56,544
你觉得她的厚颜无耻很有趣？
You find her insolence amusing?

1154
01:38:56,587 --> 01:38:57,414
是吗？
Do you?

1155
01:38:57,458 --> 01:38:59,329
嗯？
Eh?

1156
01:39:43,808 --> 01:39:45,636
你应该杀了她。
You should have killed her.

1157
01:39:50,467 --> 01:39:51,555
这样我就可能会理解你是谁了。
Then I might understand who you are.

1158
01:39:56,256 --> 01:39:57,126
她没有武器。
She had no weapon.

1159
01:40:00,173 --> 01:40:01,783
那不是我想作战的方式。
That's not how I wanted to fight.

1160
01:40:06,092 --> 01:40:07,310
她是个犹太女孩。
She was a Jewess.

1161
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,098
她告诉我了。
She told me.

1162
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:18,930
德国告诉我们全世界都在跟我们作对，
Germany told us the world is against us,

1163
01:40:18,974 --> 01:40:24,023
但我只看见德国在杀自己的国人。
and yet all I see is Germany killing its own people.

1164
01:40:27,243 --> 01:40:30,420
蕾娜，我们要去
Leyna, we need to go somewhere where

1165
01:40:30,464 --> 01:40:32,031
别人永远不会认识我们的地方。
nobody would ever know us.

1166
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:33,902
离开德国，离开
Away from Germany, away from--

1167
01:40:33,945 --> 01:40:39,647
卢茨，你看我的时侯，你看见的是什么？
Lutz, when you look at me, what do you see?

1168
01:40:45,218 --> 01:40:48,047
我不是吉普赛人。
I am not a gypsy.

1169
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:49,048
我不是犹太人。
I'm not a Jew.

1170
01:40:52,268 --> 01:40:56,490
即使在这个集中营，他们也告诉我没有属于我的地方。
Even in this camp they tell me I have no place to belong.

1171
01:40:56,533 --> 01:41:00,972
我看见一个德国女孩，对自己的祖国敬爱忠诚。
I see a German girl, loyal and dutiful to the Fatherland.

1172
01:41:01,016 --> 01:41:04,324
但我从来都不被允许爱它。
But I was never allowed to love it.

1173
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:07,327
你不应该爱我。
You are not supposed to love me.

1174
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:08,023
但我爱。
But I do.

1175
01:41:16,162 --> 01:41:23,256
赫敏死了，被迫否认她的身份。
Hermine died, forced to deny who she was.

1176
01:41:23,299 --> 01:41:26,476
而我现在得替我们两个活下去，
And now I must live for both of us,

1177
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:30,915
每天都宣告我是谁。
declaring every day who I am.

1178
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:34,484
这里，在我自己的国家里。
Here, in my country.

1179
01:41:34,528 --> 01:41:38,184
他们会杀掉你和我们的孩子。
They will kill you and our child.

1180
01:41:38,227 --> 01:41:39,968
如果孩子能活过这一切，
If the baby has survived all of this,

1181
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:44,451
我也可以。他们不想让我有孩子。
then so can I. They didn't want me to have a child.

1182
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:54,156
但她和我会成为一切的证据
But she and I will be
 the evidence of all

1183
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:59,901
她和我是他们想要否认的一切
that she and I are and all that they try to deny--

1184
01:41:59,944 --> 01:42:02,817
我是个德国黑人。
that I am a German Negro.

1185
01:42:05,863 --> 01:42:08,083
在我们都有所归属的地方爱我吧，卢茨。
Love me where we both belong, Lutz.

1186
01:42:13,306 --> 01:42:15,090
我们至少得离开这里。
We have to at least get out of here.

1187
01:42:15,134 --> 01:42:18,789
躲在什么地方，等到战争结束。
Hide somewhere until the war is over.

1188
01:42:18,833 --> 01:42:20,748
我可以偷辆汽车，自行车，什么都行。
I can steak a car or bike, anything.

1189
01:42:20,791 --> 01:42:21,879
我们…我们不能待在这里。
We-- we can't stay in this.

1190
01:42:21,923 --> 01:42:24,360
求你了。
Please.

1191
01:42:24,404 --> 01:42:28,451
我们逃跑的话，不会活着出去的。
We will never make it out alive if we try to escape.

1192
01:42:28,495 --> 01:42:29,844
你救不了我。
You can't save me.

1193
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:36,503
你能救我吗？
Can you save me?

1194
01:42:36,546 --> 01:42:41,203
我想让你好好呼吸，每天早上晚上都吃上饭
I want you to breathe properly, and to eat morning and night

1195
01:42:41,247 --> 01:42:44,728
不用怕在这个地方会被杀掉
without the fear that you will be murdered in this place

1196
01:42:44,772 --> 01:42:47,818
没有人告诉我，我要成为一个杀人犯。
that-- that tells me that I should be a murderer.

1197
01:42:52,388 --> 01:42:55,086
我不想让你再害怕了。
I don't want you to be afraid anymore.

1198
01:43:09,492 --> 01:43:12,539
很快会结束的。
It will be over soon.

1199
01:43:12,582 --> 01:43:16,195
对于我们大家来说，是真正的结束。
For all of us it will be over.

1200
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:19,241
犯人一旦被转移，我会为你做安排
Once the prisoners are moved, I'll make arrangements for you

1201
01:43:19,285 --> 01:43:20,068
回到柏林。
to go back to Berlin.

1202
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,026
转移？
Moved?

1203
01:43:22,070 --> 01:43:23,463
怎么转移？
How?

1204
01:43:23,506 --> 01:43:25,378
铁道被炸了，路被毁了
The railway lines are bombed, the roads destroyed

1205
01:43:25,421 --> 01:43:26,727
很危险。
and dangerous.

1206
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:27,989
他们走路。
They'll walk.

1207
01:43:28,032 --> 01:43:29,599
我们转移他们。
We'll move them.

1208
01:43:29,643 --> 01:43:30,339
一点一点的...
Little by little.

1209
01:43:30,383 --> 01:43:32,298
他们会死的。
They'll die.

1210
01:43:32,341 --> 01:43:34,082
大部分人自己上厕所都很困难。
Most of them can barely make it to relieve themselves.

1211
01:43:46,660 --> 01:43:51,230
或者你现在想走？
Or perhaps you want to go now?

1212
01:43:51,273 --> 01:43:53,580
不。
No.


1213
01:43:53,623 --> 01:43:55,843
我不走，现在还不。
I'm not going, not yet.

1214
01:43:55,886 --> 01:43:58,759
他们从两边一块冲我们来。
They're coming at us from both sides.

1215
01:43:58,802 --> 01:44:01,457
我不知道谁会先到这里，但我保护不了你。
I don't know who will reach here first but I can't protect you.

1216
01:44:01,501 --> 01:44:03,242
我不想让你保护我。
I don't want you to protect me.

1217
01:44:03,285 --> 01:44:05,287
那这个呢？
And this?

1218
01:44:05,331 --> 01:44:09,726
你想让我把这个放回犯人的营房里？
You want me to put it back in the prisoners' barracks?

1219
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:10,814
别让我为你选择。
Don't make me choose for you.

1220
01:44:56,295 --> 01:44:58,297
蕾娜。
Leyna.

1221
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,907
这件事你要快点做。
You will have to do this quickly.

1222
01:44:59,950 --> 01:45:01,735
他们几天后会转移集中营。
They will start moving the camp in days.

1223
01:45:01,778 --> 01:45:03,911
我有一套给你的制服。
I have a uniform for you.

1224
01:45:03,954 --> 01:45:06,043
我不能走出大门。
I can't walk through the gates.

1225
01:45:06,087 --> 01:45:06,870
我不行！
I can't!

1226
01:45:06,914 --> 01:45:08,568
我们坐一辆摩托车。
We will use a motorcycle.

1227
01:45:08,611 --> 01:45:09,743
我会找到一辆。
I will get one.

1228
01:45:09,786 --> 01:45:10,483
我保证
I promise

1229
01:45:10,526 --> 01:45:12,789
卢茨，我们会死的。
Lutz, we will die.

1230
01:45:12,833 --> 01:45:15,139
蕾娜，我们会拥有新的生活。
Leyna, we will have a life.

1231
01:45:15,183 --> 01:45:17,751
新的生命。
A life.

1232
01:45:35,682 --> 01:45:36,639
快点！
Come on!

1233
01:45:36,683 --> 01:45:39,599
轰炸越来越近了！
The bombing is getting closer!

1234
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:47,476
我不行！
I can't!

1235
01:46:33,130 --> 01:46:34,393
他们要把我们带到哪里？
Where are they taking us?

1236
01:46:34,436 --> 01:46:37,874
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

1237
01:46:37,918 --> 01:46:39,615
我们要去哪儿？
Where are we going?

1238
01:46:39,659 --> 01:46:42,966
发生什么了，盖堡？
What's happening, Kapo?

1239
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:44,533
我不知道。
I don't know.

1240
01:46:44,577 --> 01:46:45,316
走！
Go!

1241
01:46:45,360 --> 01:46:48,319
抓紧！
Hurry up!

1242
01:46:48,363 --> 01:46:50,887
女营发生什么了？
The women's camp, what's happening?

1243
01:46:50,931 --> 01:46:51,540
你已经在转移他们了。
You're moving them already.

1244
01:46:51,584 --> 01:46:52,889
我们不得不这么做。
We have to.

1245
01:46:52,933 --> 01:46:55,326
你和我今天离开。
You and me leave today.

1246
01:46:55,370 --> 01:46:56,719
你本来打算什么时候才告诉我？
And when were you going to tell me?

1247
01:46:56,763 --> 01:46:57,590
我现在就在告诉你。
I'm telling you now.

1248
01:47:00,941 --> 01:47:01,811
我不走！
I won't go!

1249
01:47:11,125 --> 01:47:14,128
那就只剩你和小偷还有犹太人一起。
Then it will be you, the thieves, and the Jews.

1250
01:47:14,171 --> 01:47:15,085
你活下来的几率有多大？
How do you rate your chances?


1251
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:19,612
你了解你自己吗，卢茨？
Do you know yourself, Lutz?

1252
01:47:19,655 --> 01:47:20,656
了解吗？
Do you?

1253
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,702
是，我了解我自己。
Yes, I know myself.

1254
01:47:22,745 --> 01:47:24,007
还有你！
And you!

1255
01:47:24,051 --> 01:47:26,793
你知道她对我来说意味着什么。
You know what she means to me.

1256
01:47:26,836 --> 01:47:30,361
如果你把她带走，我会死的。
And if you take her away, you will kill me.

1257
01:47:30,405 --> 01:47:33,364
你觉得和一个黑鬼给未来做打算
And you think planning a future with a Negro

1258
01:47:33,408 --> 01:47:34,975
能让你活着？
will keep you alive?

1259
01:47:35,018 --> 01:47:38,108
我不会让你因为她被逮捕，被折磨。
I refuse to let you be arrested and tortured because of her.

1260
01:47:38,152 --> 01:47:40,023
德国不会让你活着。
Germany will not let you survive.

1261
01:47:40,067 --> 01:47:41,634
你不会活下来的！
You will not survive!

1262
01:47:41,677 --> 01:47:45,725
父亲，她怀了我们的孩子。
Father, she is having our child.

1263
01:47:45,768 --> 01:47:47,857
我们必须活下去！
We have to survive!

1264
01:47:47,901 --> 01:47:48,510
我们必须。
We have to.

1265
01:47:51,731 --> 01:47:53,733
他们会把你吊死。
They will hang you.

1266
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:42,042
一个
A

1267
01:48:46,829 --> 01:48:47,613
先生，我们得走了。
Sir, we have to go.

1268
01:48:47,656 --> 01:48:48,527
没时间了。
There is no time.

1269
01:49:06,414 --> 01:49:09,373
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1270
01:49:09,417 --> 01:49:10,984
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1271
01:49:11,027 --> 01:49:11,637
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1272
01:49:14,988 --> 01:49:15,597
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1273
01:49:19,340 --> 01:49:20,559
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1274
01:49:20,602 --> 01:49:21,298
卢茨！
Lutz!

1275
01:49:21,342 --> 01:49:22,648
我在这！
I'm here!

1276
01:49:22,691 --> 01:49:23,649
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1277
01:49:23,692 --> 01:49:24,345
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1278
01:49:27,304 --> 01:49:28,610
卢茨！
Lutz!

1279
01:49:28,654 --> 01:49:30,569
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1280
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:32,614
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1281
01:49:32,658 --> 01:49:34,616
卢茨！
Lutz!

1282
01:49:34,660 --> 01:49:36,618
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1283
01:49:36,662 --> 01:49:39,447
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1284
01:49:39,490 --> 01:49:40,100
蕾娜！
Leyna!

1285
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:54,800
拜托，我在尽力帮助你们所有人。
Please, I'm going to try to help all of you.

1286
01:51:54,843 --> 01:51:58,499
请报上您要找的亲人的
Please have the full name, age, and occupation of the relative

1287
01:51:58,542 --> 01:52:00,414
全名，年龄和职业。
you are searching for.

1288
