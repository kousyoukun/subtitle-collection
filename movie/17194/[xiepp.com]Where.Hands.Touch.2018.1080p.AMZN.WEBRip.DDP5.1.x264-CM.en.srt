1
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:46,133
Move aside.

2
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:49,571
We are
looking for the girl.

3
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,268
Where is the?

4
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:53,053
The one you're
searching for, she

5
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,794
returned to Lubec two days ago.

6
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,709
You
are Frau Schlegel?

7
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:59,102
She is your child?

8
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:00,408
Yes, but she
doesn't live here.

9
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:03,628
She lives with
her aunt in Lubec.

10
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:05,413
You're making a mistake.

11
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:09,678
Women like you,
you contaminate.

12
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:14,248
If she's anything like her
mother, she'll be open also...

13
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,858
to contaminate from within.

14
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:24,954
You won't find her.

15
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:26,956
Because she doesn't live here.

16
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:44,321
Leyna, come They've gone.

17
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:04,472
Spring 1944.

18
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,038
That was the year I turned 16.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,522
Children like me
from the Rhineland

20
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:18,268
were known as Rhineland
bastards or "Hitler's problem,"

21
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:21,184
because our German
nationality automatically

22
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:24,709
came through our white mothers
even though our fathers

23
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:27,103
were African and often absent.

24
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:36,199
There were so few of us
that in my entire 16 years,

25
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:39,202
I never saw another
soul like me.

26
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:42,727
Happy Birthday, sweet girl.

27
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,686
Thank you, Frau Heinrich.

28
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,950
Hitler
wanted to deal with us secretly,

29
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:53,477
without being seen by Germany to
be attacking our Aryan mothers.

30
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:58,178
So though we had a freedom
that the Jews did not have,

31
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:02,225
still we had to be
guarded, especially

32
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,923
once the Gestapo started
to visit us in Rudesheim.

33
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:13,715
It wasn't that I had not
known I was different.

34
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:20,330
It was that as I reached 16,
I really began to feel it.

35
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:25,117
That was the year I realized
Hitler had a plan for us.

36
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,858
Why are we going to Berlin?

37
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,817
To be invisible.

38
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,253
Stop talking, Koen.

39
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:31,080
Read your book.

40
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:45,703
I have my drawing
book, but no pencil.

41
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,357
I can't draw without one.

42
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:49,707
You want a pencil?

43
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:54,408
I think that I might be able
to help you, little man.

44
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:55,670
Thank you.

45
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:56,410
He's restless.

46
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,367
He's a boy.

47
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:58,760
We never grow out of it.

48
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,592
Your papers?

49
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:07,116
Yes, of course.

50
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,726
I have all of our papers.

51
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,379
Here.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,219
Schlegel?

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:23,872
Yes.

54
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,711
Invisible.

55
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,549
Here is not like the Rhineland.

56
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:50,812
They're not bothered
with children like you

57
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:54,598
or this talk of fixing you.

58
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,774
Life will be good again.

59
00:04:56,818 --> 00:05:00,300
I promise.

60
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:03,346
We have a new girl
joining us today.

61
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:09,004
Her name is Leyna Schlegel.

62
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:09,700
Stand up.

63
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:19,797
Schlegel is a good German name,
but your face, so un-German.

64
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,061
Leyna has facial
features in common

65
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:26,369
with people of which continent?

66
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:27,631
Greta.

67
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:28,806
Africa.

68
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,377
Indeed So how
does a girl like you

69
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,553
come to have a name so
Germanic as Schlegel?

70
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:44,300
Schlegel is my mother's name.

71
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,823
And what is your
father's name?

72
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:53,440
When will you tell
me about my father?

73
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:55,006
He was black from head to toe.

74
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,184
I want to
know who he was.

75
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,186
Leyna.

76
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,884
You know everything.

77
00:06:02,927 --> 00:06:05,974
I was just a little
older than you.

78
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:06,714
Made mistakes.

79
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:07,628
Mistakes?

80
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,326
Not you.

81
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,110
Koen, get me some water, please.

82
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,118
He was a good soldier.

83
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:22,556
But I've told you all this.

84
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:23,818
I don't know what else.

85
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,820
Why did you not marry?

86
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:29,389
Mr. Mueller slapped me
yesterday, because he told me

87
00:06:29,432 --> 00:06:32,827
that you were the first of
all people who are white

88
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,438
and the worse of
all people, black.

89
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,875
That's what a Mulatto is.

90
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,444
But I told him that's not true.

91
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,403
To me you are the
best of everything.

92
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,539
Your hair is dirty.

93
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,671
I'll wash it for you tonight.

94
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,946
Heil Hitler.

95
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:36,368
Hey, shouldn't you be
going with them, monkey?

96
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:16,626
Wilhelm just
returned from Vienna.

97
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,367
But he
knows we're coming?

98
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,411
Yes, of course.

99
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,325
I told him.

100
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,418
She actually is beautiful.

101
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,990
And he looks just like Father.

102
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:33,817
Go on, Leyna.

103
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:34,514
Sit down.

104
00:08:44,828 --> 00:08:47,265
I didn't expect you
with the children.

105
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:48,963
Today they saw a
Negro at the door.

106
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:50,878
Tomorrow it will
be a Jew, you know?

107
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:51,835
Nobody saw us, Hida.

108
00:09:02,454 --> 00:09:04,761
Leyna, go ahead of me.

109
00:09:04,805 --> 00:09:07,459
See if you can pick up
a good loaf of bread

110
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:09,505
before the store closes.

111
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,462
Take Koen with you.

112
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:16,556
Leyna, please, use the back.

113
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:28,176
Kerstin, I want
you to understand,

114
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:31,832
I have nothing
against your family.

115
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:36,010
And a choice between your
child and us, well, I know,

116
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,533
it's no choice at all.

117
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,449
But I spilled blood
for the Kaiser.

118
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:45,019
And last month they kept my
sick father over two nights

119
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:48,370
because someone convinced
them he had a Jewish mother.

120
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,981
And now you bring
your Negro here.

121
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,985
You compromised me, us, your
sister, without any regard.

122
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:57,466
Wilhelm.

123
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:04,560
Listen for just a moment and you
will never hear from us again.

124
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,430
I need papers.

125
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,389
Kerstin.

126
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:10,566
Something to say Leyna
has been sterilized.

127
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,394
You really are quite unique.

128
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:13,787
Wilhelm, you have access.

129
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:17,617
A Gestapo document declaring
her physically changed.

130
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,054
You can do this.

131
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:20,881
I know you can.

132
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:21,969
You should leave, Kerstin.

133
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,666
Hida, please.

134
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,886
I didn't think the order
would extend to Berlin.

135
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,279
I hoped she would be safe here.

136
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,541
But two days ago they came.

137
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,152
She was out.

138
00:10:31,195 --> 00:10:33,067
I told them she carries the
papers with her but I'm afraid.

139
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:40,857
I'm afraid that they will
take her from the streets,

140
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:44,165
from the school, anywhere
that I can't protect her.

141
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,470
Leyna, let's go.

142
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,211
Why did you
put her in school?

143
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:49,387
What's the matter with you?

144
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,693
I can't hide her.

145
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,347
If not school,
then labor service.

146
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,740
Who knows where she would end?

147
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,611
All the girls must
do labor service.

148
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,917
She's no different.

149
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,701
You want her to be special?

150
00:10:58,745 --> 00:11:00,660
No.

151
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:05,447
I want her to be
like everyone else.

152
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,274
Unremarkable.

153
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:13,716
Then she will not escape this
war as if it never happened.

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,196
None of us will
manage that, Kerstin.

155
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:23,944
Gunter.

156
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:25,641
Where?

157
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,340
Where did that voice come from?

158
00:11:29,384 --> 00:11:30,298
Ah.

159
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,778
Some bread, please, Gunter.

160
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:32,735
How are you?

161
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:33,605
Good?

162
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:34,606
Settling in?

163
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,347
I miss home.

164
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,566
Morning.

165
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:42,136
Ah, is that a,
yes, I think a smile.

166
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,268
That's better.

167
00:11:44,312 --> 00:11:45,356
There are people waiting.

168
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:58,239
I always keep good come
back, but you can have it.

169
00:11:58,282 --> 00:11:59,631
Now listen to me.

170
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:01,677
If your sister
forgets to smile, you

171
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
remind her of Gunter's face.

172
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,986
It's funny, yes?

173
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:06,638
Yes.

174
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,346
Can I go now?

175
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,043
Yes, you can go
with the other boys.

176
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:22,785
Go on then.

177
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:23,438
Koen.

178
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,142
Koen.

179
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:33,883
I have no choice.

180
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:35,798
The law says you must go.

181
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:41,543
But where you are going, they
will teach you many things.

182
00:12:41,586 --> 00:12:44,676
Lots will make sense
and feel right,

183
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,070
but so much will be
confusing because it

184
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:53,250
will be different to the
things you learn here at home.

185
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:56,819
But I want you to
understand that nobody

186
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,909
can know a son
better than a mother,

187
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:02,216
no teacher, no group leader.

188
00:13:05,523 --> 00:13:09,701
I hope, Koen, that you
choose never to forget this,

189
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:15,751
that you keep what I teach
you in here and here.

190
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,104
Do you understand me, Koen?

191
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:53,745
Leyna!

192
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:54,790
I didn't see you.

193
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,530
Leyna?

194
00:13:55,573 --> 00:13:57,010
Sorry.

195
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,100
Let me look at you.

196
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,014
You should be more careful.

197
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:09,631
I need to get you home so
we can clean these wounds.

198
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:15,593
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,176
Why are you in the
building so early?

200
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,223
The leaders in meeting
before the boys arrive.

201
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,746
I told them we need to.

202
00:14:37,789 --> 00:14:40,270
Are you making
problems for yourself?

203
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,404
The older ones are taking
pocket money from the others.

204
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:45,014
Yesterday I had mothers
screaming in my ears.

205
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:45,710
Wait!

206
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:50,367
Ask.

207
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,194
Hm.

208
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:51,891
Don't take.

209
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:02,727
We're a little
late, Frau Nagel.

210
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,555
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:06,166
What happened to you?

212
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:08,820
A little hooligan
ran her over with his bike.

213
00:15:08,864 --> 00:15:11,171
It was an accident.

214
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,389
What do you say, Koen?

215
00:15:12,433 --> 00:15:13,695
Thank you, Frau Nagel.

216
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:16,916
And next time, I kick
your ass at chess, huh?

217
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,791
A gentleman asked
me to take it for you.

218
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:25,272
He was at your door
while you were gone.

219
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:29,537
I ask him his name, but
he didn't want to tell me.

220
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,190
Wilhelm.

221
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,771
Hida must never know.

222
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,208
Here, take them.

223
00:15:48,251 --> 00:15:52,125
A set of the doctor's
papers has also been filed.

224
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,604
Who?

225
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:56,433
A connection in the
municipality of Rudesheim,

226
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:57,782
one who is critical
of the regime.

227
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,568
A communist?

228
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:03,223
You have communist contacts?

229
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,877
There are more
papers inside that

230
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:08,402
must be archived in Rudesheim.

231
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:12,101
Have them signed and
returned to me as instructed.

232
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:16,584
And then you must forget
that you ever had a sister.

233
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:39,911
Here.

234
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,060
What?

235
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,105
Nothing.

236
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,151
You polish like
your Uncle Harry...

237
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:05,111
like a girl.

238
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:10,072
Oh, well Uncle Harry
told me I polish like you.

239
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:12,031
When you're finished, go
and get yourself cleaned up.

240
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:15,817
You have mud in your hair.

241
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,818
My targets were
excellent today.

242
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,740
I have to go to Hamburg
tonight but Sunday,

243
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:26,915
Sunday we'll catch
some fish, yes?

244
00:17:55,987 --> 00:18:00,122
I have papers for you.

245
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:04,126
You should carry them
with you wherever you go.

246
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,042
They will protect you.

247
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,087
Where did you...

248
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:13,048
They're false,
but they're enough.

249
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:13,701
No one will know.

250
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:24,015
Wilhelm needs you
to sign these also.

251
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,626
If I send them back
to him, he will

252
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,586
make sure it's in the right
place for us to be left alone.

253
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,501
What is it?

254
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:34,417
A declaration
that you will not

255
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,115
commit the crime
of racial mixing

256
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,377
with anyone of German blood.

257
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,164
I am of German blood.

258
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,253
It's just a signature
to keep them away.

259
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:45,646
It means nothing.

260
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,648
It means something surely
or why should I sign?

261
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:51,913
I won't.

262
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,570
Fine.

263
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,311
Then they will come
for you, Leyna,

264
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,576
and they will make you sign,
not false, empty papers.

265
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:07,407
Real ones, and not before
they have fixed you in reality

266
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,104
and cut your insides to do so.

267
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:23,379
Neither you nor
your brother entered

268
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:26,513
this world without pain.

269
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:31,953
But I could not be in this
life without you both.

270
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:32,997
You should also
know the blessing

271
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,173
of motherhood one day, Leyna.

272
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,396
I want that for you.

273
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,704
If you do not sign,
they will do to you

274
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:44,835
what can never be undone.

275
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:52,452
You will be who
they have made you.

276
00:19:52,495 --> 00:19:55,542
What was the treaty that
enabled Poland to take

277
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,283
this land from the empire?

278
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,240
Anna?

279
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,285
Versailles.

280
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:00,895
Schlegel.

281
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:05,116
The five principle leaders were
signatories to this treaty?

282
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,117
Heil Hitler.

283
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,684
Heil Hitler.

284
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,251
Heil Hitler.

285
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:09,904
Sit.

286
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,439
Schlegel, stand.

287
00:20:23,483 --> 00:20:24,135
Come.

288
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,357
Leave your books.

289
00:20:28,401 --> 00:20:30,141
You won't need them anymore.

290
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:30,838
And take your bag.

291
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,042
They didn't hurt you.

292
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,565
That's all that matters.

293
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:08,049
They can force you
from school, but they

294
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:10,878
can't stop you learning.

295
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,706
You'll learn here at home.

296
00:21:16,623 --> 00:21:18,451
But you will be
conscripted to work now.

297
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,986
I was proud of how
you worked today.

298
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,205
You're growing so quickly.

299
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,773
I have a coat that will
fit you nicely now.

300
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,004
Drive us home?

301
00:21:50,047 --> 00:21:51,353
No, thank you.

302
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,049
I... I'll cycle.

303
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:13,201
Oh, please.

304
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:23,211
You followed us home.

305
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:25,344
I wanted to know
if you're all right.

306
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:25,996
I am.

307
00:22:30,958 --> 00:22:34,048
What are you looking at?

308
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,179
I don't know, your bruise.

309
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:46,539
I'll see you.

310
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:47,191
What's your name?

311
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,335
Gunter,

312
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:06,776
Gunter!

313
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,867
Take them off.

314
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:21,269
Off!

315
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:34,717
They didn't circumcise
you good enough, Jew.

316
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:35,675
I can fix that.

317
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:45,772
What happened?

318
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,773
He was a Jew?

319
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:48,383
Printing leaflets.

320
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:49,732
He was plotting
with other students.

321
00:23:49,776 --> 00:23:51,430
He wore a crucifix
like it was a badge.

322
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,388
Running with some
rotten Zionist group.

323
00:24:04,573 --> 00:24:08,838
I heard some people
outside Gunter's store.

324
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,884
Something happened to him today.

325
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:12,668
I know.

326
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:13,539
I was there.

327
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,191
I saw it.

328
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,502
He was touching the bread.

329
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,504
But he was Jewish.

330
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:23,462
Don't be stupid, Koen.

331
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:24,941
He was good Jew.

332
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,029
Leyna.

333
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:28,379
Good Jew?

334
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:31,426
He was a human being.

335
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,689
If I forbade you from
sharing the streets with me

336
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,170
because your face is
freckled, should my words make

337
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,433
you any less of a human being?

338
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,087
Should that mean that
anyone should shoot

339
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,262
you in the street like a dog?

340
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:48,443
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:52,142 --> 00:24:55,668
I'm sorry you had to
see such a thing, Leyna.

342
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,540
Also to you, Koen.

343
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,761
It's not your fault.
It's my job to protect

344
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:04,241
you from the things you hear,
even the things you think.

345
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:13,424
A Waffen SS man.

346
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,905
He came to speak to
us in training today.

347
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:19,082
He told me my
skills are superior.

348
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,649
He wishes to speak
with me further.

349
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,608
What was his name?

350
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,174
Leiber.

351
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:25,872
Section leader.

352
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:31,486
Tell me when does Leiber
plan to speak to me?

353
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,141
I don't think they're
asking you to fight.

354
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,926
And are you asking them
why they are not out there

355
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,582
fighting themselves these men
who walk around recruiting you

356
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:43,280
idiots?

357
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,891
Why are you angry?

358
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,719
It's easy to hit the target
when no one is attacking you,

359
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,285
Lutz.

360
00:25:48,329 --> 00:25:51,506
You think there's time for
practice out there in the east?

361
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,292
Out there the enemy is real
and his only target is you.

362
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,946
This isn't a game to me.

363
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,732
I am training hard.

364
00:25:59,775 --> 00:26:00,602
Everyone can see it.

365
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:10,612
I fought in the last war
for four years, and when I got

366
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:15,661
back Germany was even
worse than when I left.

367
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:16,662
No work.

368
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:17,445
Debt.

369
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,708
Hunger.

370
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:22,624
Like you, we ran willingly
towards our death.

371
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:26,628
Towards protecting
the... the Homeland.

372
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:30,501
Like fools, we didn't
ask a single question.

373
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:34,593
And all those men,
comrades that I ate with,

374
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,639
slept with, pissed with...
they died for nothing.

375
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,119
Do you understand me?
For nothing!

376
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,302
We were humiliated, cheated.

377
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:52,523
But this war, this war is ours.

378
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,917
You cannot make a difference.

379
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:57,528
That's not true.

380
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:59,008
ANNOUNCER [ON
Germany will

381
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:02,925
be freed from the Gestapo
hyenas, the SS murderers,

382
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:05,232
and anyone who believes
in the filth of Hitler,

383
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,668
of National Socialism...

384
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,240
...and this repulsive system.

385
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,459
We will see the
end... not of you,

386
00:27:15,503 --> 00:27:18,854
not of Germany, for the fight is
not against the German people.

387
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:20,464
Leyna.

388
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,770
On the
contrary, Britain fights to...

389
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:23,380
I...

390
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:24,730
...relieve
you from the monstrous

391
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,557
hands of a dictator...

392
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:27,994
Mother, I just
need some fresh air.

393
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,430
...who
convinced you he would

394
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:30,561
free Germany, and instead...

395
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:31,693
Leyna.

396
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:32,607
...has broken it.

397
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:41,790
She's a negro.

398
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:48,405
Leyna.

399
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:50,859
Leyna?

400
00:28:55,298 --> 00:28:56,125
That's your name?

401
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:01,522
Why did you come?

402
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:04,220
You could get into
a lot of trouble.

403
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:05,178
Heil Hitler!

404
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:06,222
I wanted to see
what it's like.

405
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,485
Heil Hitler!

406
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,966
See what he does here.

407
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,273
Koen.

408
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:15,014
He's my brother.

409
00:29:15,057 --> 00:29:16,972
I know.

410
00:29:17,016 --> 00:29:18,931
I have seen him with you.

411
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,020
Were you spying on us?

412
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:21,716
Only once.

413
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:28,114
He's German.

414
00:29:28,157 --> 00:29:29,028
Of course.

415
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,647
I've seen a lady
that looks like you.

416
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,171
In a photograph.

417
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:47,350
Well not really a photograph.

418
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,439
My father, he has a gramophone.

419
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:54,880
He hides jazz records, but I've
heard them playing quietly.

420
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:57,839
Sometimes, late at night,
when I'm in my room,

421
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,362
if I press my ear to
the floor, I hear.

422
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,628
Negermusik.

423
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:09,198
Isn't that what it's called?

424
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:13,202
It's not allowed.

425
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:22,298
When we're
in a friendly situation,

426
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:28,783
my conversation
might not be smart.

427
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:33,701
But if we're to have a
perfect understanding,

428
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:36,878
let's call a heart a heart.

429
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,189
On the cover of one of the
magazines there's a lady.

430
00:30:43,232 --> 00:30:44,712
She's like you.

431
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:48,324
Kind of beautiful.

432
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:04,863
You'll get into trouble
singing those songs.

433
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,473
I'll just have to be careful.

434
00:31:06,516 --> 00:31:07,126
Like my father.

435
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:22,402
Come on.

436
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,590
Have you ever been up there?

437
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:39,680
Into those hills?

438
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,378
It's the quietest
place on earth.

439
00:31:42,422 --> 00:31:44,293
I used to go up there
to collect caterpillars,

440
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:47,253
with my father and my mother.

441
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,994
You can see all of Berlin
from that one place.

442
00:31:56,262 --> 00:31:57,089
Did you run away?

443
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:00,222
Run away?

444
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,793
It's just your
mother, she is...

445
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:13,192
She's not Jewish.

446
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:16,195
No, I know, but...

447
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,545
your father.

448
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:20,851
He... He's a negro.

449
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:27,075
Have you ever
swam in the night?

450
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,947
You know, when it's so
dark you can see nothing.

451
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:39,000
I always thought it
would be so wonderful.

452
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:41,046
Then why have
you never done it?

453
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:48,270
In Rudesheim I'd
swim every week.

454
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:50,403
There were many Jews.

455
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,839
They were told they
couldn't use the pool.

456
00:32:55,147 --> 00:33:01,849
And then... I was told I
couldn't use it either.

457
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,852
It's been a long
time, that's all.

458
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,245
I have dreams that I'm drowning.

459
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,558
You just have to get
used to the water again.

460
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:26,830
You can jump in with me.

461
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:33,881
Now the next...

462
00:33:48,678 --> 00:33:49,549
Heil Hitler.

463
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:58,514
Leyna.

464
00:33:58,558 --> 00:33:59,254
Leyna!

465
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,299
Leyna?

466
00:34:00,342 --> 00:34:02,127
Leyna!

467
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,130
Leyna.

468
00:34:22,538 --> 00:34:24,671
Here.

469
00:34:24,714 --> 00:34:26,499
This bit you need to
know where you're going.

470
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:30,459
I can't believe I
lent you my bike.

471
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:36,552
My mother had them made for us.

472
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:37,640
For me and father.

473
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:41,122
Does she have one too?

474
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,863
She's dead.

475
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:45,213
Oh, I...

476
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:47,911
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:50,523
Is that why you come here?

478
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:51,176
To think of her?

479
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:57,269
Sometimes.

480
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,881
Mostly I think of what would
it would be like to fight.

481
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:05,277
To stand up for Germany,
like my father did.

482
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,845
Do you think you
could take a life?

483
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:11,457
Kill a human being?

484
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,807
Of course I could.

485
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,678
I could kill a Russian
soldier with ease.

486
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,990
Ooh, my mother will
think I've been up to something.

487
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,731
Use my jumper.

488
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:25,384
It's easier.

489
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:34,306
Aren't you afraid?

490
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,177
Of what?

491
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,918
Fighting.

492
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:39,659
War.

493
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:40,877
Does the war frighten you?

494
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:43,576
Yes.

495
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,665
My father fought in the war.

496
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:46,405
He did?

497
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:47,101
For Germany?

498
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:50,844
Of course.

499
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,891
BBC PRESENTER [ON
Here is England.

500
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:57,633
Here is England.

501
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:00,549
Here is the BBC midnight news.

502
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:05,163
The Allies' advance into
mainland Europe continues.

503
00:36:05,206 --> 00:36:08,340
British Elite Forces,
along with US troops...

504
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,645
Did my father
fight for Germany?

505
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,038
Beg your pardon?

506
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,213
...have today captured

507
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:13,388
the French port of Cherbourg...

508
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:14,911
He fought for the French.

509
00:36:14,955 --> 00:36:17,697
A Tirailleur Senegalais.

510
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,786
...from the western front.

511
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,179
The victory included...

512
00:36:25,313 --> 00:36:29,448
You told me he was
sent here to fight.

513
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,754
You didn't tell me he was
sent here to fight us!

514
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,981
It's his language!

515
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:43,679
He was part of the
Occupation by the time we met.

516
00:36:43,723 --> 00:36:45,333
He didn't fight you.

517
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,944
Or me.

518
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:50,077
Of course he did.

519
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,908
I am German, even if you
want to pretend you are not.

520
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:57,693
Even if you want me
to pretend I'm not.

521
00:36:57,737 --> 00:37:00,479
I loved him.

522
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:02,829
It was from that
place that you came.

523
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:06,180
A place even Koen cannot claim.

524
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,879
You have made
me an enemy twice.

525
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,664
If you think I've
made you the enemy,

526
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:14,928
Leyna, then look around you!

527
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,277
Look, Leyna.

528
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:19,454
And the next time you are
with that son of a Nazi,

529
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,282
you know this...

530
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:26,374
If his father catches you
with his boy, he'll kill him.

531
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,028
Before he comes and kills us!

532
00:37:56,883 --> 00:38:00,495
I've forgotten my gloves.

533
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:01,191
I'll wait.

534
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:06,327
No, you go on.

535
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:07,285
I'll be just a moment.

536
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:11,332
It's your choice, Leyna.

537
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,187
You're always here.

538
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,449
Outside the factory.

539
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,369
Are you cold?

540
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,371
No.

541
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:52,591
Are you?

542
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,244
Yes, it's the coldest summer.

543
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:00,686
I've lost my gloves.

544
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,122
I told my mother I left them.

545
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:17,023
I have to go.

546
00:40:17,066 --> 00:40:19,460
I don't want my mother
to be more upset with me.

547
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,809
I wanted to give
you something.

548
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,689
Cheese.

549
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:33,169
Maybe you could enjoy it
with Koen and your mother.

550
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:49,751
I thought you had gone.

551
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:53,146
My mother didn't
wait for me, Leyna.

552
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:57,411
And that's just how
I became your mother,

553
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,718
chasing the same
impossibility you are chasing.

554
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:06,333
The first time your
father looked at me,

555
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:07,987
I thought my heart
would never beat again

556
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,205
unless he loved me forever.

557
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:15,995
He was ripped away
from me, Leyna.

558
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:18,954
And all I had left was you.

559
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:22,262
The best of everything.

560
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:24,220
So you think I could
ever leave you?

561
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:31,750
For each of us there is someone.

562
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:37,190
For me it's you, Leyna.

563
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:40,541
The gift from your father.

564
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:44,240
Koen is my heart, you know that.

565
00:41:47,461 --> 00:41:50,769
But for me, that someone is you.

566
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:57,993
An
unwashed Englishman.

567
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:03,651
A French baboon,
black from head to toe.

568
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:04,739
Black like your sister.

569
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,960
Black as coal like Leyna.

570
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:14,401
HITLER YOUTH
Get in line!

571
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,664
Move!

572
00:42:22,801 --> 00:42:24,280
Used to it, aren't you?

573
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:28,241
Dirt in your mouth?

574
00:42:28,284 --> 00:42:29,285
A good soldier
should have honor.

575
00:42:33,725 --> 00:42:34,377
Koen!

576
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:45,824
Are you all right, Koen?

577
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:54,310
Koen!

578
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:55,007
What?

579
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,055
Do you still love me?

580
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:01,361
No.

581
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,581
I hate you.

582
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,931
You're a girl and I hate girls!

583
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:49,452
I have not

584
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:52,325
These are not old papers!

585
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:53,282
Don't take those!

586
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:54,980
Where are you taking me?

587
00:43:55,023 --> 00:43:56,285
You have Jews here?

588
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,418
It's just the three of us.

589
00:43:58,461 --> 00:43:59,941
My son is asleep,
in the bedroom.

590
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:07,688
Where are her papers?

591
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:08,428
Go fetch them, Leyna.

592
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:19,482
It's all right, Koen.

593
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:20,179
They'll go soon.

594
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:59,435
Born in Rudesheim.

595
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:00,088
German.

596
00:45:03,613 --> 00:45:08,836
You are a Negro, but
you say you are German.

597
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:43,697
We will have them replaced.

598
00:45:57,450 --> 00:46:00,018
You, er, won't be
reporting to SS Leiber.

599
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,630
He thinks you'll be
of more use elsewhere.

600
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:04,283
Fighting?

601
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:10,158
We need every man we can get.

602
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:13,074
Oh, so you do realize that
our men are freezing to death

603
00:46:13,118 --> 00:46:14,554
on the Russian front?

604
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:16,469
They are dying with honor.

605
00:46:16,512 --> 00:46:17,426
It's not for nothing.

606
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:21,213
No, it's for blind delusion.

607
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:22,954
Are we finished?

608
00:46:22,997 --> 00:46:25,347
May I go now?

609
00:46:25,391 --> 00:46:27,088
Lutz, wait.

610
00:46:27,132 --> 00:46:33,834
Your mother fought for her life
with every part of her being.

611
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:35,488
She wouldn't want to see
you throw away yours.

612
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,102
You wear the mask that
gets you through the war,

613
00:46:41,146 --> 00:46:41,973
that helps you survive.

614
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:47,369
Why did you fight for
Germany if you don't love it?

615
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:48,588
If you weren't prepared to die.

616
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,851
Don't judge me, Lutz.

617
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:52,157
You are just as I was.

618
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,768
I would have died for
Germany 10 times over.

619
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,858
Others made that sacrifice then.

620
00:46:57,902 --> 00:46:59,425
And they will make it now.

621
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:00,078
Let them.

622
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:06,519
Lutz, I am your
father first of all.

623
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:08,086
Do you understand?

624
00:47:08,129 --> 00:47:09,522
No, I don't.

625
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:11,829
You want me to feel as you
feel, but you don't want

626
00:47:11,872 --> 00:47:13,656
me to fight like you fought.

627
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,267
You want me to have
an independent mind,

628
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,616
but not if it goes
against yours.

629
00:47:19,662 --> 00:47:21,360
Who should I be?

630
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:22,883
Should I be you or not?

631
00:47:26,931 --> 00:47:29,324
You are not a hero.

632
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:30,369
And neither am I.

633
00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,712
We can't go to
the hilltop today.

634
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:11,323
I have to try
to get back home.

635
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:12,063
You should wait.

636
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:13,107
They'll be everywhere.

637
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:13,803
Wait?

638
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:18,112
Put this on.

639
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:23,422
Come on, quick!

640
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,075
Leyna!

641
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:37,218
Where are we going?

642
00:48:37,262 --> 00:48:39,046
Somewhere safe.

643
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:41,396
Until things calm down.

644
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,181
My father, he left
for Munich yesterday.

645
00:48:52,842 --> 00:48:53,669
Sit down.

646
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:59,806
Are you hungry?

647
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:01,808
No, thanks.

648
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,724
Thirsty?

649
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,594
Me neither.

650
00:49:15,082 --> 00:49:17,998
Thank you.

651
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,826
What for?

652
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:20,479
Being my friend.

653
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:26,702
I will have some water.

654
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:48,333
Your mother, she looked kind.

655
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:56,428
You must miss her terribly.

656
00:49:56,471 --> 00:50:02,434
My father, he
used to cry a lot.

657
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:03,304
That was the worst.

658
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,136
I only have one
photograph of my father.

659
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:15,229
I want to show you something.

660
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,120
What are you doing?

661
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:36,816
I told you.

662
00:50:44,476 --> 00:50:46,086
This one he likes
to play most often.

663
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:03,103
When we're in
a friendly situation, my

664
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:07,629
conversation may not be smart.

665
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:12,547
But if we're to have a
perfect understanding,

666
00:51:12,591 --> 00:51:13,983
let's call a heart a heart.

667
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:16,986
After she died I
would hear this music

668
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,989
and I would tell
myself if I looked hard

669
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,122
enough through the
crack in the door

670
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:26,431
I would catch her in here,
dancing with my father.

671
00:51:26,474 --> 00:51:31,088
If I tell you what
my dreams have been demanding,

672
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:35,309
let's call a heart a heart.

673
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:37,355
We can dance.

674
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:41,272
Can I
prove how I yearn

675
00:51:41,315 --> 00:51:45,798
just by the turn of a phrase?

676
00:51:45,841 --> 00:51:55,329
Can I keep my control when
all my soul is aflame?

677
00:51:55,373 --> 00:52:01,161
Maybe you would call a true
confession and indiscretion

678
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:03,946
on someone's part.

679
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:10,562
But if I'm to say how madly I
adore you, let's call a heart...

680
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:21,616
Shh.

681
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:23,836
It's Jann, the furniture maker.

682
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:25,185
It's all right,
he can't see you.

683
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,447
He's almost blind.

684
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:28,667
Its only shapes, or if
you're really close.

685
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,669
What do you think he wants?

686
00:52:30,712 --> 00:52:32,584
My father gives him work.

687
00:52:32,627 --> 00:52:34,629
He probably left some
tools in the back.

688
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,113
He's leaving.

689
00:52:46,467 --> 00:52:49,209
Berlin is supposed
to be clear by now.

690
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,430
I think that's why there's
so many actions today.

691
00:52:52,473 --> 00:52:54,171
You don't have to be scared.

692
00:52:54,214 --> 00:52:55,911
"Clear?"

693
00:52:55,955 --> 00:52:58,087
Of all Jews.

694
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:00,916
I heard my father
talking before he left.

695
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,309
For the Fuhrer's
birthday last year,

696
00:53:02,353 --> 00:53:04,529
Berlin was to be clear of Jews.

697
00:53:04,572 --> 00:53:06,357
But the Jews married to
Germans and the half Jews,

698
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,053
they still remain.

699
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:13,451
Where do they "clear" them to?

700
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:15,453
Poland, I think.

701
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:18,195
Camps for labor.

702
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:19,805
Better they work for Germany
than sitting here plotting

703
00:53:19,848 --> 00:53:21,110
and planning against us.

704
00:53:25,854 --> 00:53:26,681
It's hard, you know.

705
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:33,035
The Gestapo come looking
for a Jew and they find me.

706
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:40,260
Not for long.

707
00:53:40,304 --> 00:53:42,871
It can't stay like this forever.

708
00:53:42,915 --> 00:53:43,698
Germany will be calm again.

709
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:53,969
It will be all right.

710
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:21,318
What do you
think America is like?

711
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:24,277
Why?

712
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:28,542
That woman you showed
me on the magazine...

713
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:30,979
she's American.

714
00:55:31,023 --> 00:55:31,632
So?

715
00:55:36,985 --> 00:55:41,338
Do you think she's happy?

716
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:45,167
They hang people like
you in America, Leyna.

717
00:55:45,211 --> 00:55:49,302
They show us in
books at meetings.

718
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,000
People hanging in
trees, set on fire.

719
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:07,320
Did you ever do that before?

720
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,280
Do what?

721
00:56:16,634 --> 00:56:19,550
What we just did.

722
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:20,246
Of course.

723
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:23,902
When?

724
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,080
When was the first time?

725
00:56:30,909 --> 00:56:32,824
I don't know.

726
00:56:32,867 --> 00:56:36,741
A few years ago.

727
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:37,655
A few years?

728
00:56:40,701 --> 00:56:42,181
Be quiet, Leyna.

729
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:50,450
I don't think that you
ever touched anyone the way

730
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:51,625
that you just touched me.

731
00:56:56,935 --> 00:56:58,327
Here, put this on.

732
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,681
What time is it?

733
00:57:03,724 --> 00:57:06,205
It's after 9:00.

734
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:08,163
What?

735
00:57:08,207 --> 00:57:08,816
Lutz, the curfew.

736
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:44,852
Halt!

737
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:53,861
Heil Hitler.

738
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:56,211
What are you doing?

739
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:58,518
I'm... I'm collecting
some books from Treptow.

740
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,433
I'm preparing for
a meeting tomorrow.

741
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,869
And you
couldn't do it in daylight?

742
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:03,523
Just skulking
around in the dark?

743
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,003
I just returned
from training exercise.

744
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:06,526
Where do you live?

745
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,267
Hey!

746
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,703
Koppenick.

747
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:11,966
I live in Koppenick.

748
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:12,619
Weissmuller's boy?

749
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:20,801
Go on, get on your way,
before you get arrested.

750
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:30,289
Leyna!

751
00:58:34,598 --> 00:58:36,600
I'll wait until you get inside.

752
00:58:36,643 --> 00:58:39,559
Lutz.

753
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:40,342
What we did today...

754
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:45,347
did you ever do that before?

755
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:50,744
No.

756
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:51,631
From here on,
you will not leave

757
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,154
the house unless I'm with you.

758
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:56,201
You've shown you
can't be trusted.

759
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:58,595
You could have been arrested.

760
00:59:58,638 --> 00:59:59,944
I'm not Jewish.

761
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:01,206
No.

762
01:00:01,249 --> 01:00:04,078
And nor are you Aryan, Leyna.

763
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:06,951
We'll all have to pay for
your mistakes in the end.

764
01:00:06,994 --> 01:00:09,910
Me, you, even Koen.

765
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,088
We'll all have to pay.

766
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:20,878
You speak of
nothing but mistakes,

767
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:23,663
but who's paying for yours?

768
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:34,587
And that's why I will not
watch you throw your life away.

769
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,415
You will not go
near that boy again.

770
01:00:53,998 --> 01:00:56,043
I apologize.

771
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:56,696
Excuse me.

772
01:01:04,225 --> 01:01:05,749
You!

773
01:01:05,792 --> 01:01:08,229
Stop.

774
01:01:08,273 --> 01:01:09,187
Halt!

775
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:09,927
Now!

776
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,494
Stop, Leyna.

777
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:13,278
We have to stop.

778
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:18,805
Stay here.

779
01:01:22,504 --> 01:01:24,637
Both of you!

780
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,161
Mother, I have no
sterilization papers.

781
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:28,380
No identity papers.

782
01:01:28,423 --> 01:01:29,033
I will explain.

783
01:01:42,133 --> 01:01:44,831
Your bastard?

784
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:45,527
My daughter.

785
01:01:48,443 --> 01:01:51,142
Your Negro bastard.

786
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,756
You're at the factory?

787
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,758
Papers?

788
01:01:58,802 --> 01:01:59,759
Yes.

789
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:00,847
Quickly.

790
01:02:00,891 --> 01:02:01,543
Yes.

791
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:07,549
Here.

792
01:02:07,593 --> 01:02:09,160
Her papers?

793
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:10,117
Yes.

794
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:12,032
Tell me...

795
01:02:12,076 --> 01:02:17,211
What was in your heart when
you were shaming Germany?

796
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:18,735
I have never shamed Germany.

797
01:02:22,173 --> 01:02:23,870
Her papers!

798
01:02:23,914 --> 01:02:27,831
You are
Germany's disgrace.

799
01:02:27,874 --> 01:02:30,007
You and your bastard.

800
01:02:31,443 --> 01:02:33,532
Close your mouth.

801
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:37,841
Black man's whore.

802
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:39,146
You're lost.

803
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:45,326
Forgotten what it is to
be a good German woman.

804
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:49,113
Do you think you are lost?

805
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:52,812
I am not lost.

806
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:57,251
Perhaps not forever.

807
01:02:57,295 --> 01:03:02,430
So then, how do you become
a good German woman?

808
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:09,829
You lose your monkey.

809
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,830
Mama.

810
01:03:14,616 --> 01:03:15,835
What?

811
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,837
We take
her or we take you.

812
01:03:20,231 --> 01:03:21,710
No, no, no!
Mama!

813
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,016
Please!
Please!

814
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:23,887
Please, I beg you!

815
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:24,888
No, please!

816
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:25,671
Please!

817
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:26,977
Please, take me!

818
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:27,978
Be quiet!

819
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:31,285
Take me!

820
01:03:32,504 --> 01:03:33,200
No!

821
01:03:33,244 --> 01:03:33,940
Mama!

822
01:03:33,984 --> 01:03:34,941
No!

823
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,987
You don't cry.

824
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,640
You do not cry.

825
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,180
Mama.

826
01:03:57,224 --> 01:03:57,834
Mama!

827
01:04:02,447 --> 01:04:03,056
Mama!

828
01:04:11,369 --> 01:04:14,067
Why didn't she tell me?

829
01:04:14,111 --> 01:04:17,418
She didn't even say goodbye.

830
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:21,161
She told me to
say goodbye for her.

831
01:04:21,205 --> 01:04:26,210
This work, it will pay her good
money and it won't be for long.

832
01:04:26,253 --> 01:04:27,776
How long?

833
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:28,429
I don't know.

834
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:39,049
But she loves us.

835
01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:44,184
And you can't be away from
people you love for very long.

836
01:04:44,228 --> 01:04:52,192
So I know, right now,
right this minute,

837
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:57,937
she's working as hard as
she can to get back to us.

838
01:04:57,981 --> 01:05:01,027
I could have gone with her.

839
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,333
No, you couldn't.

840
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:13,431
Excuse me, Herr?

841
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:24,790
Herr Engel.

842
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:27,575
I was going to visit
Lutz and his father.

843
01:05:30,491 --> 01:05:32,319
I wasn't sure if he
was still in Munich.

844
01:05:32,363 --> 01:05:33,538
He's back.

845
01:05:33,581 --> 01:05:35,105
Oh.

846
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:37,368
Lutz you missed already.

847
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:39,283
He was summoned to duty.

848
01:05:39,326 --> 01:05:42,286
One day ago.

849
01:05:42,329 --> 01:05:43,896
Duty?

850
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,681
Thought he had one month
but they came for him

851
01:05:46,725 --> 01:05:48,248
early yesterday morning.

852
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:50,424
Sent him to the east.

853
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,122
No warning.

854
01:05:52,165 --> 01:05:54,994
It was his time.

855
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:58,737
Wish it was mine again.

856
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,914
Nothing in Berlin except
women and old men.

857
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,089
Huh.

858
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:06,701
And hiding Jews.

859
01:06:26,243 --> 01:06:28,071
Is it true you can't
be away from people

860
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:32,075
you love for very long?

861
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:32,989
Of course it is.

862
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:03,758
Koen?

863
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:10,722
Come.

864
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:22,299
Papers.

865
01:07:22,342 --> 01:07:23,300
Identity papers.

866
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:24,953
What's happening?

867
01:07:24,997 --> 01:07:26,912
I think they're moving
us to the engine factory.

868
01:07:26,955 --> 01:07:27,652
Papers.

869
01:07:34,267 --> 01:07:35,051
What is it?

870
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:35,877
What's happening?

871
01:07:35,921 --> 01:07:37,314
Who are they looking for?

872
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,097
Take her away.

873
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:45,322
Papers.

874
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:50,283
They're checking
everyone's papers.

875
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:11,435
Look, look!

876
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:12,697
A woman is running away!

877
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:13,872
Get her!

878
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:16,004
What
are you doing?

879
01:08:16,048 --> 01:08:17,310
What are you doing?

880
01:08:26,754 --> 01:08:27,494
Quickly.

881
01:08:27,538 --> 01:08:29,366
Get in.

882
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:50,865
Shut up.

883
01:08:56,262 --> 01:08:58,221
Shut up!

884
01:08:58,264 --> 01:09:00,875
Next.

885
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:01,746
Hurry up.

886
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:12,670
Come here.

887
01:09:22,636 --> 01:09:24,508
You're a mischling?

888
01:09:24,551 --> 01:09:26,423
Yes.

889
01:09:26,466 --> 01:09:27,946
My mother is Aryan.

890
01:09:27,989 --> 01:09:29,034
Sterilized?

891
01:09:29,077 --> 01:09:30,253
Yes.

892
01:09:30,296 --> 01:09:31,384
I was sterilized in Rudesheim...

893
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:33,691
The Rhineland.

894
01:09:33,734 --> 01:09:35,867
Your mother did you no favors.

895
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:39,305
She rendered you a Neger.

896
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:42,569
Don't cling to her
purity because she

897
01:09:42,613 --> 01:09:43,788
didn't care to make you pure.

898
01:09:52,275 --> 01:09:52,884
Gypsy?

899
01:09:55,713 --> 01:09:56,322
You a Partisan?

900
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:01,284
No.

901
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:01,980
I love Germany.

902
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:12,382
But they took my
mother and my papers.

903
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:20,303
They say there is no such thing
as a Negro of the Fatherland.

904
01:10:20,346 --> 01:10:21,217
And what do you say?

905
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:24,872
I say...

906
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:30,182
I say I am German.

907
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,111
Stand here.

908
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:22,669
I am
going to do for you

909
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:24,323
what your mother couldn't.

910
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,586
I am going to give
you a chance for life,

911
01:11:26,630 --> 01:11:29,241
because it was not you who
defiled the German race.

912
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,723
You are merely the
sickening produce.

913
01:11:32,766 --> 01:11:35,247
You will work in the kitchen.

914
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:37,771
You will eat the food you
are given and no more.

915
01:11:37,815 --> 01:11:42,167
If you take advantage, you
will die before your time,

916
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,386
as your mother should have.

917
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:15,853
You are in my bunk.

918
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:18,203
Oh, hush, Negro.

919
01:12:18,246 --> 01:12:20,118
You think
you are better than me?

920
01:12:20,161 --> 01:12:21,685
Spare your energy.

921
01:12:21,728 --> 01:12:23,600
You are only lucky you are
not in the rat house over there

922
01:12:23,643 --> 01:12:24,296
like...

923
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,428
You think I am Jewish?

924
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:27,647
All I want is to
sleep near my sister.

925
01:12:27,691 --> 01:12:30,868
But an African savage like
you wouldn't understand.

926
01:12:30,911 --> 01:12:33,436
You would eat your own
mother to keep alive.

927
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:36,264
Only a fool sleeps down
there where they piss and empty

928
01:12:36,308 --> 01:12:38,441
themselves on you from above.

929
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:39,920
Well you can sleep in my bunk.

930
01:12:46,405 --> 01:12:47,928
Where are the
girls that sleep here?

931
01:12:47,972 --> 01:12:51,062
Infirmary.

932
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:51,932
They won't be back.

933
01:12:57,547 --> 01:13:00,027
Those shoes will
cause you trouble.

934
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:01,028
I know but they are strong.

935
01:13:04,815 --> 01:13:06,033
Down there is ripe for typhus.

936
01:13:09,820 --> 01:13:11,038
I'm tired of being pushed out.

937
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:21,135
Your
stomach is round.

938
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:22,441
I've seen it in
the wash barracks.

939
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:34,192
Do you know what
happens in there?

940
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,631
Where?

941
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:39,980
The Jewish rat house.

942
01:13:52,123 --> 01:13:53,951
I can't breathe with this air.

943
01:15:28,045 --> 01:15:32,397
How
can I prove how I yearn

944
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:37,402
just by the turn of a phrase?

945
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:44,278
Can I keep control when
all my soul is aflame?

946
01:15:48,021 --> 01:15:53,940
But if I'm to say how
madly I adore you,

947
01:15:53,984 --> 01:15:55,594
let's call a heart a heart.

948
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:25,363
Here, take mine.

949
01:16:29,759 --> 01:16:31,935
Take it.

950
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:33,197
I ate in the kitchen.

951
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:47,472
Your feet are rotting, Hermine.

952
01:16:56,002 --> 01:17:00,093
When I can, I'll
bring you a potato.

953
01:17:00,137 --> 01:17:02,661
You can use it to buy shoes.

954
01:17:02,705 --> 01:17:03,314
OK?

955
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:12,497
Last night,
I ate ice cream.

956
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:18,416
Sweet vanilla ice cream.

957
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:22,028
I was asleep in
my mother's arms.

958
01:17:22,072 --> 01:17:25,075
I smelt her skin.

959
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:29,470
I felt her heart beat.

960
01:17:29,514 --> 01:17:31,777
They took her instead of me.

961
01:17:31,821 --> 01:17:33,692
I will never forgive myself.

962
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:49,012
I have said that
I am sterilized.

963
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:05,332
Hermine, it hurts.

964
01:18:05,376 --> 01:18:06,420
You will get used to it.

965
01:18:43,806 --> 01:18:44,415
Halt!

966
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,334
Where are you coming from
and where are you going?

967
01:18:53,816 --> 01:18:57,994
Sir, I'm returning from
kitchen duty to my barracks.

968
01:18:58,037 --> 01:18:59,996
You carry food
from the kitchen.

969
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:01,824
Hand it over.

970
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:03,086
Sir.

971
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:03,782
Take off your clothes.

972
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:08,482
Hurry up!

973
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:15,098
Come on.

974
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:16,229
Do you want to be shot?

975
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,631
Take off your clothes.

976
01:19:26,674 --> 01:19:27,458
Now.

977
01:19:27,501 --> 01:19:28,111
Hey!

978
01:19:34,987 --> 01:19:36,641
What has she done?

979
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:38,121
Negermischling.

980
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:40,253
You seen one before?

981
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:43,082
Thieving from the kitchen.

982
01:19:43,126 --> 01:19:45,258
See how she shakes.

983
01:19:45,302 --> 01:19:46,477
She's hiding food.

984
01:19:57,053 --> 01:19:59,359
I should like
to deal with her.

985
01:19:59,403 --> 01:20:08,064
She... She is miserable.

986
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:10,240
Let me take her.

987
01:20:10,283 --> 01:20:14,853
I want to search her barracks.

988
01:20:14,897 --> 01:20:17,160
Go ahead.

989
01:20:17,203 --> 01:20:18,596
If you can stand
the Neger's stench.

990
01:20:30,738 --> 01:20:31,348
Leyna.

991
01:20:49,627 --> 01:20:50,236
Wait.

992
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:56,199
Stop!

993
01:21:03,293 --> 01:21:04,555
Where do you sleep?

994
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:09,038
We have to walk.

995
01:21:09,081 --> 01:21:09,777
Where is your block?

996
01:21:15,479 --> 01:21:19,222
We sleep in the same barracks.

997
01:21:19,265 --> 01:21:20,440
Can she return with me?

998
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,420
Do you have food in there?

999
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:20,718
Come.

1000
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:27,725
You look pale.

1001
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:28,726
Are you sick?

1002
01:22:28,769 --> 01:22:29,945
No.

1003
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:31,903
You stay away
from the prisoners.

1004
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,644
Camp is riddled,
we can't keep up.

1005
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:42,435
Why did you bring me here?

1006
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:44,002
Was it just to be with you?

1007
01:22:44,046 --> 01:22:46,309
Well is that so bad?

1008
01:22:46,352 --> 01:22:49,051
Right now, the Jews are bribing
each other with food just

1009
01:22:49,094 --> 01:22:51,618
to be close to a loved one.

1010
01:22:51,662 --> 01:22:52,837
Whether you fight
or you are here,

1011
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,056
you are surrounded by death.

1012
01:22:54,099 --> 01:22:56,493
At least here you're
not being shot at.

1013
01:22:56,536 --> 01:22:58,103
And no one can
doubt your loyalty

1014
01:22:58,147 --> 01:22:58,974
if you wear the uniform.

1015
01:23:03,195 --> 01:23:06,372
"You wear the mask that
will get you through the war

1016
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:07,417
and allow you to survive."

1017
01:23:19,429 --> 01:23:21,474
It's cooked.

1018
01:23:21,518 --> 01:23:24,216
I will get you good shoes.

1019
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:26,479
I think I should look after
it for you until tomorrow.

1020
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:39,797
Have a small bite.

1021
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,364
But just one or you'll
be furious with yourself.

1022
01:25:01,922 --> 01:25:02,923
He needs someone
young and strong.

1023
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:04,142
Go with him.

1024
01:25:13,412 --> 01:25:14,674
You have to talk to me.

1025
01:25:25,903 --> 01:25:27,122
How did you get here?

1026
01:25:30,821 --> 01:25:33,040
What about your mother?

1027
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:33,650
Brother?

1028
01:25:36,827 --> 01:25:39,699
What about Lutz?

1029
01:25:39,743 --> 01:25:40,570
What happened to him?

1030
01:25:47,533 --> 01:25:48,752
I was called.

1031
01:25:48,795 --> 01:25:51,929
I had no time.

1032
01:25:51,972 --> 01:25:55,150
I didn't know how
to get word to you.

1033
01:25:55,193 --> 01:25:57,282
I thought they would
send me to fight.

1034
01:26:00,894 --> 01:26:04,202
Instead they sent me to a camp.

1035
01:26:04,246 --> 01:26:05,290
East.

1036
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:14,430
All day the smell
of skin and bone.

1037
01:26:14,473 --> 01:26:15,692
I can't bear it.

1038
01:26:21,915 --> 01:26:23,352
You have worked in
a place like that?

1039
01:26:23,395 --> 01:26:24,048
No.

1040
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:29,880
But I have seen Jews
selected to work in them.

1041
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:40,195
In the killing rooms.

1042
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:41,457
To kill other Jews?

1043
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,812
But there will be none left.

1044
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,819
The smoke never stops.

1045
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:00,780
No, it doesn't.

1046
01:27:08,745 --> 01:27:11,008
I want to make it stop
but I don't know how.

1047
01:27:15,186 --> 01:27:16,274
Why are you staring at me?

1048
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:22,759
You look changed.

1049
01:27:30,723 --> 01:27:33,596
The latrines.

1050
01:27:33,639 --> 01:27:36,120
I'll be on duty nearby tonight.

1051
01:27:36,163 --> 01:27:36,860
Meet me.

1052
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:38,035
I'll bring food.

1053
01:27:38,078 --> 01:27:39,558
No.

1054
01:27:39,602 --> 01:27:42,996
You need to eat, Leyna.

1055
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,216
I haven't
received the order from you.

1056
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,609
Which order?

1057
01:27:46,652 --> 01:27:48,959
Clearing the children.

1058
01:27:49,002 --> 01:27:50,482
In the absence of
the Commandant,

1059
01:27:50,526 --> 01:27:52,963
it needs your signature.

1060
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:54,791
I've had more urgent concerns.

1061
01:27:54,834 --> 01:27:56,619
In case you haven't
noticed, we're 60

1062
01:27:56,662 --> 01:27:58,403
tanks short of losing the war.

1063
01:27:58,447 --> 01:28:00,753
Yes, and I'm not interested
in leaving diseased corpses

1064
01:28:00,797 --> 01:28:01,537
for the Americans to find.

1065
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,451
Are you?

1066
01:28:09,849 --> 01:28:15,202
Do you know why you were always
the cause of so many rumors?

1067
01:28:15,246 --> 01:28:18,858
Your inability to say
what's going on in your mind

1068
01:28:18,902 --> 01:28:20,947
and your choice of company.

1069
01:28:20,991 --> 01:28:24,995
Dubious, always.

1070
01:28:25,038 --> 01:28:26,605
Your friend,
Bismarck Schonhausen,

1071
01:28:26,649 --> 01:28:28,999
has been arrested in Berlin...

1072
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:32,742
plotting against the
Fuhrer, with 15 others.

1073
01:28:32,785 --> 01:28:34,744
He should be hanged like a dog.

1074
01:28:34,787 --> 01:28:37,921
So should his son, if
they have any sense.

1075
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:42,708
Sins of the father and such.

1076
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:48,105
How many times would you
say he visited your home?

1077
01:28:48,148 --> 01:28:50,325
About as many times
as you, Juttner.

1078
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:17,482
You didn't come yesterday.

1079
01:29:24,663 --> 01:29:25,490
I brought you this.

1080
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,851
And some food.

1081
01:29:38,895 --> 01:29:40,940
Sir, this was
found in the camp,

1082
01:29:40,984 --> 01:29:43,334
amongst jewelry
from the prisoners.

1083
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:47,033
It is a Weissmuller
ring, isn't it?

1084
01:29:47,077 --> 01:29:47,860
Thank you, Peter.

1085
01:29:47,904 --> 01:29:48,513
You can go.

1086
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:05,443
I'm filthy.

1087
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:06,096
Let me hold you.

1088
01:30:24,331 --> 01:30:28,161
Why do you breathe like that?

1089
01:30:28,205 --> 01:30:29,075
I'm cold.

1090
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:12,031
Leyna?

1091
01:31:15,731 --> 01:31:16,383
Yes.

1092
01:31:24,653 --> 01:31:26,263
I last held you
six months ago.

1093
01:31:37,970 --> 01:31:39,842
Leyna, you are afraid of me?

1094
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:44,803
Did someone hurt you this way?

1095
01:31:51,593 --> 01:31:52,811
Did we do this together?

1096
01:32:53,393 --> 01:32:54,264
Walk with me.

1097
01:33:51,756 --> 01:33:54,541
This isn't war.

1098
01:33:54,585 --> 01:33:55,760
Harming ordinary people.

1099
01:33:59,546 --> 01:34:00,547
It isn't what a soldier does.

1100
01:34:00,591 --> 01:34:01,548
Hm.

1101
01:34:01,592 --> 01:34:03,768
You think so?

1102
01:34:03,812 --> 01:34:05,770
That is precisely
what a soldier does,

1103
01:34:05,814 --> 01:34:08,773
whether he wants to or not.

1104
01:34:08,817 --> 01:34:11,907
That is war.

1105
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:17,042
I told you your choices would
keep you alive or see you dead.

1106
01:34:17,086 --> 01:34:19,131
You came here, so you're alive.

1107
01:34:24,789 --> 01:34:27,966
Those were your options.

1108
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:30,447
Choose life or choose death.

1109
01:34:42,111 --> 01:34:46,028
You told me
we are not heroes.

1110
01:34:46,071 --> 01:34:47,638
What you should have said
is that we are cowards.

1111
01:35:25,894 --> 01:35:27,243
Up.

1112
01:35:27,286 --> 01:35:28,635
Up!

1113
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:29,854
Get up!

1114
01:35:29,898 --> 01:35:30,637
Now!

1115
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:33,205
Come on!

1116
01:35:33,249 --> 01:35:36,208
Where are my shoes?

1117
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,868
Did you take my shoes?

1118
01:35:43,912 --> 01:35:44,869
Did you take her shoes?

1119
01:35:44,913 --> 01:35:46,610
Did you take my shoes?

1120
01:35:46,653 --> 01:35:47,698
Did you take her shoes?

1121
01:35:47,742 --> 01:35:49,569
Where are my shoes?

1122
01:35:49,613 --> 01:35:50,788
Where are my shoes?
Hermine.

1123
01:35:50,832 --> 01:35:51,702
Where are my shoes?

1124
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:52,529
Hermine, stop it!

1125
01:35:52,572 --> 01:35:53,443
She's dead!

1126
01:36:00,842 --> 01:36:04,976
Betz, Leyna.

1127
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:09,764
Do you know what
he will do to me?

1128
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:11,766
He's a murdering pig.

1129
01:36:15,508 --> 01:36:19,338
I saw my family go to the
place you call the rat house.

1130
01:36:22,515 --> 01:36:25,214
Where, one by one
they disappeared.

1131
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:37,182
My mother, she told me
never admit you are a Jew.

1132
01:36:40,055 --> 01:36:43,275
That is how to stay alive.

1133
01:36:46,235 --> 01:36:50,717
I'm alive, Leyna.

1134
01:36:50,761 --> 01:36:54,591
I missed the smoke and
came here for labor.

1135
01:36:54,634 --> 01:36:55,853
Hermine.

1136
01:36:55,897 --> 01:37:03,252
And now, I will die
because I have no shoes.

1137
01:37:03,295 --> 01:37:04,557
You will not die.

1138
01:37:44,554 --> 01:37:45,163
Shoeless?

1139
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:50,429
Why?

1140
01:37:50,473 --> 01:37:53,041
Sir, my shoes were taken in
the barracks during the night.

1141
01:37:56,131 --> 01:37:58,046
Weissmuller.

1142
01:37:58,089 --> 01:37:58,916
Join me, will you?

1143
01:38:12,974 --> 01:38:13,583
Shoot her.

1144
01:38:23,636 --> 01:38:24,507
Shoot her.

1145
01:38:57,366 --> 01:38:58,454
Do you laugh?

1146
01:38:58,497 --> 01:39:01,544
You find her insolence amusing?

1147
01:39:01,587 --> 01:39:02,414
Do you?

1148
01:39:02,458 --> 01:39:04,329
Eh?

1149
01:39:48,808 --> 01:39:50,636
You should
have killed her.

1150
01:39:55,467 --> 01:39:56,555
Then I might
understand who you are.

1151
01:40:01,256 --> 01:40:02,126
She had no weapon.

1152
01:40:05,173 --> 01:40:06,783
That's not how I
wanted to fight.

1153
01:40:11,092 --> 01:40:12,310
She was a Jewess.

1154
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,098
She told me.

1155
01:40:20,927 --> 01:40:23,930
Germany told us the
world is against us,

1156
01:40:23,974 --> 01:40:29,023
and yet all I see is Germany
killing its own people.

1157
01:40:32,243 --> 01:40:35,420
Leyna, we need to
go somewhere where

1158
01:40:35,464 --> 01:40:37,031
nobody would ever know us.

1159
01:40:37,074 --> 01:40:38,902
Away from Germany, away from...

1160
01:40:38,945 --> 01:40:44,647
Lutz, when you look
at me, what do you see?

1161
01:40:50,218 --> 01:40:53,047
I am not a gypsy.

1162
01:40:53,090 --> 01:40:54,048
I'm not a Jew.

1163
01:40:57,268 --> 01:41:01,490
Even in this camp they tell
me I have no place to belong.

1164
01:41:01,533 --> 01:41:05,972
I see a German girl, loyal
and dutiful to the Fatherland.

1165
01:41:06,016 --> 01:41:09,324
But I was never
allowed to love it.

1166
01:41:09,367 --> 01:41:12,327
You are not supposed to love me.

1167
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:13,023
But I do.

1168
01:41:21,162 --> 01:41:28,256
Hermine died, forced
to deny who she was.

1169
01:41:28,299 --> 01:41:31,476
And now I must live
for both of us,

1170
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,915
declaring every day who I am.

1171
01:41:35,959 --> 01:41:39,484
Here, in my country.

1172
01:41:39,528 --> 01:41:43,184
They will kill
you and our child.

1173
01:41:43,227 --> 01:41:44,968
If the baby has
survived all of this,

1174
01:41:45,011 --> 01:41:49,451
then so can I. They didn't
want me to have a child.

1175
01:41:54,020 --> 01:41:59,156
But she and I will be
the evidence of all

1176
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:04,901
that she and I are and all
that they try to deny...

1177
01:42:04,944 --> 01:42:07,817
that I am a German Negro.

1178
01:42:10,863 --> 01:42:13,083
Love me where we
both belong, Lutz.

1179
01:42:18,306 --> 01:42:20,090
We have to at least
get out of here.

1180
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,789
Hide somewhere until
the war is over.

1181
01:42:23,833 --> 01:42:25,748
I can steak a car
or bike, anything.

1182
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:26,879
We... we can't stay in this.

1183
01:42:26,923 --> 01:42:29,360
Please.

1184
01:42:29,404 --> 01:42:33,451
We will never make it out
alive if we try to escape.

1185
01:42:33,495 --> 01:42:34,844
You can't save me.

1186
01:42:38,064 --> 01:42:41,503
Can you save me?

1187
01:42:41,546 --> 01:42:46,203
I want you to breathe properly,
and to eat morning and night

1188
01:42:46,247 --> 01:42:49,728
without the fear that you
will be murdered in this place

1189
01:42:49,772 --> 01:42:52,818
that... that tells me that
I should be a murderer.

1190
01:42:57,388 --> 01:43:00,086
I don't want you to
be afraid anymore.

1191
01:43:14,492 --> 01:43:17,539
It will be over soon.

1192
01:43:17,582 --> 01:43:21,195
For all of us it will be over.

1193
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:24,241
Once the prisoners are moved,
I'll make arrangements for you

1194
01:43:24,285 --> 01:43:25,068
to go back to Berlin.

1195
01:43:25,111 --> 01:43:27,026
Moved?

1196
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:28,463
How?

1197
01:43:28,506 --> 01:43:30,378
The railway lines are
bombed, the roads destroyed

1198
01:43:30,421 --> 01:43:31,727
and dangerous.

1199
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:32,989
They'll walk.

1200
01:43:33,032 --> 01:43:34,599
We'll move them.

1201
01:43:34,643 --> 01:43:35,339
Little by little.

1202
01:43:35,383 --> 01:43:37,298
They'll die.

1203
01:43:37,341 --> 01:43:39,082
Most of them can barely make
it to relieve themselves.

1204
01:43:51,660 --> 01:43:56,230
Or perhaps you want to go now?

1205
01:43:56,273 --> 01:43:58,580
No.

1206
01:43:58,623 --> 01:44:00,843
I'm not going, not yet.

1207
01:44:00,886 --> 01:44:03,759
They're coming at
us from both sides.

1208
01:44:03,802 --> 01:44:06,457
I don't know who will reach here
first but I can't protect you.

1209
01:44:06,501 --> 01:44:08,242
I don't want
you to protect me.

1210
01:44:08,285 --> 01:44:10,287
And this?

1211
01:44:10,331 --> 01:44:14,726
You want me to put it back
in the prisoners' barracks?

1212
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:15,814
Don't make me choose for you.

1213
01:45:01,295 --> 01:45:03,297
Leyna.

1214
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:04,907
You will have to
do this quickly.

1215
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:06,735
They will start moving
the camp in days.

1216
01:45:06,778 --> 01:45:08,911
I have a uniform for you.

1217
01:45:08,954 --> 01:45:11,043
I can't walk
through the gates.

1218
01:45:11,087 --> 01:45:11,870
I can't!

1219
01:45:11,914 --> 01:45:13,568
We will use a motorcycle.

1220
01:45:13,611 --> 01:45:14,743
I will get one.

1221
01:45:14,786 --> 01:45:15,483
I promise

1222
01:45:15,526 --> 01:45:17,789
Lutz, we will die.

1223
01:45:17,833 --> 01:45:20,139
Leyna, we will have a life.

1224
01:45:20,183 --> 01:45:22,751
A life.

1225
01:45:40,682 --> 01:45:41,639
Come on!

1226
01:45:41,683 --> 01:45:44,599
The bombing is getting closer!

1227
01:45:51,606 --> 01:45:52,476
I can't!

1228
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:39,393
Where
are they taking us?

1229
01:46:39,436 --> 01:46:42,874
Where are we going?

1230
01:46:42,918 --> 01:46:44,615
Where are we going?

1231
01:46:44,659 --> 01:46:47,966
What's happening, Kapo?

1232
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:49,533
I don't know.

1233
01:46:49,577 --> 01:46:50,316
Go!

1234
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:53,319
Hurry up!

1235
01:46:53,363 --> 01:46:55,887
The women's camp,
what's happening?

1236
01:46:55,931 --> 01:46:56,540
You're moving them already.

1237
01:46:56,584 --> 01:46:57,889
We have to.

1238
01:46:57,933 --> 01:47:00,326
You and me leave today.

1239
01:47:00,370 --> 01:47:01,719
And when were you
going to tell me?

1240
01:47:01,763 --> 01:47:02,590
I'm telling you now.

1241
01:47:05,941 --> 01:47:06,811
I won't go!

1242
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:19,128
Then it will be you,
the thieves, and the Jews.

1243
01:47:19,171 --> 01:47:20,085
How do you rate your chances?

1244
01:47:23,001 --> 01:47:24,612
Do you know yourself, Lutz?

1245
01:47:24,655 --> 01:47:25,656
Do you?

1246
01:47:25,700 --> 01:47:27,702
Yes, I know myself.

1247
01:47:27,745 --> 01:47:29,007
And you!

1248
01:47:29,051 --> 01:47:31,793
You know what she means to me.

1249
01:47:31,836 --> 01:47:35,361
And if you take her
away, you will kill me.

1250
01:47:35,405 --> 01:47:38,364
And you think planning
a future with a Negro

1251
01:47:38,408 --> 01:47:39,975
will keep you alive?

1252
01:47:40,018 --> 01:47:43,108
I refuse to let you be arrested
and tortured because of her.

1253
01:47:43,152 --> 01:47:45,023
Germany will not
let you survive.

1254
01:47:45,067 --> 01:47:46,634
You will not survive!

1255
01:47:46,677 --> 01:47:50,725
Father, she is
having our child.

1256
01:47:50,768 --> 01:47:52,857
We have to survive!

1257
01:47:52,901 --> 01:47:53,510
We have to.

1258
01:47:56,731 --> 01:47:58,733
They will hang you.

1259
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:47,042
A

1260
01:48:51,829 --> 01:48:52,613
Sir, we have to go.

1261
01:48:52,656 --> 01:48:53,527
There is no time.

1262
01:49:11,414 --> 01:49:16,637
Leyna!

1263
01:49:19,988 --> 01:49:20,597
Leyna!

1264
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:25,559
Leyna!

1265
01:49:25,602 --> 01:49:26,298
Lutz!

1266
01:49:26,342 --> 01:49:27,648
I'm here!

1267
01:49:27,691 --> 01:49:29,345
Leyna!

1268
01:49:32,304 --> 01:49:33,610
Lutz!

1269
01:49:33,654 --> 01:49:37,614
Leyna!

1270
01:49:37,658 --> 01:49:39,616
Lutz!

1271
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:45,100
Leyna!

1272
01:51:56,840 --> 01:51:59,800
Please, I'm going
to try to help all of you.

1273
01:51:59,843 --> 01:52:03,499
Please have the full name, age,
and occupation of the relative

1274
01:52:03,542 --> 01:52:05,414
you are searching for.

1275
01:52:05,457 --> 01:52:08,112
If you know the last camp your
relative was taken to, please

1276
01:52:08,156 --> 01:52:10,027
have this information ready.

1277
01:52:24,955 --> 01:52:25,782
Hi.

1278
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:15,919
Leyna Schlegel.

1279
01:53:15,963 --> 01:53:16,615
Ah.

1280
01:53:26,364 --> 01:53:28,671
I'm
looking for my aunt.

1281
01:53:28,714 --> 01:53:29,628
Can you help me?

1282
01:53:29,672 --> 01:53:30,760
