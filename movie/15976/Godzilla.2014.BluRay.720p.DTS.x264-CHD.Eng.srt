1
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,367
<i>Ten...</i>

2
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
<i>...nine, eight...</i>

3
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,963
<i>...seven, six...</i>

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,531
<i>...five, four...</i>

00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,049
<i>...three, two...</i>

6
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,247
<i>...one.</i>

7
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,285
Dr. Serizawa?

8
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,922
Jerry Boyd. I'm warning you, it's a mess.

9
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,491
It's just a total mess.

10
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,250
Monarch sent me in this morning.

11
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,926
Took a look around,
but I told them we needed you.

12
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,765
They picked up a radiation pocket
out here last month.

13
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,571
They got excited, thinking
they had a uranium deposit.

14
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,451
They started stacking up
the heavy machinery and then...

15
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,920
Well, the valley floor...

16
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,285
...collapsed into a cavern below.

17
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,481
Just dropped away. Just gone.

18
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,081
Best guess right now is
about 40 miners went down with it.

19
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,006
This way.

20
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,325
When they first discovered this pocket,
the radiation levels were only half as strong.

21
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,806
It's almost as if contact
with the outside air...

22
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,010
...started catalyzing something.

23
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,287
Some kind of fossils, right?

24
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,681
I've been digging holes for 30 years,
I've never seen anything like it.

25
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,204
My God. Is it possible?

26
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,371
Is it him?

27
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,008
No.

28
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,129
This is much older.

29
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,090
Hey, guys. You gotta see this.

30
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,481
What is it?

31
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,170
Some kind of egg?

32
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,484
A dormant spore?

33
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,766
The bones are fossilized...

34
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,849
...but this formation seems to be
perfectly preserved.

35
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,329
This one looks broken.

36
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,607
It's like something...

37
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,046
...came out of it.

38
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,962
I'll get it. It's probably for me.

39
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,806
No, Takashi.

40
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,209
No. Takashi, just listen to me
for a second.

41
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,808
I'm asking for the meeting because
if I have to shut the reactor down...

42
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,560
...you're not gonna want to
read about it in a memo.

43
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,007
I've been following these tremors
since they started in the Philippines...

44
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,322
...and now they're in our own backyard.

45
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,165
No, no, no. Hayato says...

46
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,131
...I need to go through you about this.

47
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,566
Look, I'm just...

48
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,805
...trying to follow the protocols set forth
by the company. That's all. It's my job.

49
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,681
He's awake.

50
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,647
I know. He got up early.

51
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,802
What are we gonna do?

52
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,844
Get dressed. I'll figure it out.

53
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,601
- Okay?
- Okay.

54
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,247
Later, Dad.

55
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,528
With all due respect, Takashi, and honor...

56
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,161
...respect and honor, with all of that...

57
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,529
...I'm an engineer. I don't like
unexplained frequency patterning...

58
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,810
...near a plant where I'm responsible.
I need a meeting. Make it happen.

59
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,166
Bye, Mom!

60
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,724
He made you a sign.

61
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,406
- What?
- Your birthday sign.

62
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,443
- He worked so hard.
- God.

63
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
I'm gonna come home early.

64
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,564
I'll take the car and pick him up...

65
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,768
...and we can get a proper cake. Okay?

66
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,002
Listen, I need to know...

67
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,647
...that it's not the sensors. Okay?

68
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,168
I can't be calling this meeting
and look like the American maniac.

69
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,447
So when we get there...

70
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,446
...don't even bother coming up.
Just grab a team and go down to Level 5.

71
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,761
You're not a maniac.

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,162
I mean, you are, just not about this.

73
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,442
Must be something we're not thinking of.

74
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,570
Happy birthday.

75
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,526
What? Is it...?

76
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,047
- Yes, it is. Ha, ha.
- I forgot all about it.

77
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,725
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

78
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,764
I should have a birthday more often. Ha, ha.

79
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,121
<i>- What is this?
- Seismic anomaly.</i>

80
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,362
This graph is minutes.

81
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,281
X is minutes, not days. This is now.

82
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,887
Wait, hold on. Seismic activity?

83
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,248
Seismic?
You're talking about earthquakes?

84
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,881
No, earthquakes are random, jagged.

85
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,885
This is consistent, increasing.

86
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,126
This is a pattern.

87
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,530
All right. Let's make this quick.

88
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,483
Takashi. What the hell is going on?
Have you seen this?

89
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,051
Yeah. Maybe not such...

90
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,805
...good time for a meeting.

91
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,564
What's the source?

92
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,845
Where's the epicenter?

93
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,368
We don't know. But it keeps getting stronger.

94
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,648
It's gotta be centered somewhere.

95
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,161
Hayato.

96
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,005
No one else is reporting it.

97
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,564
We are contacting every other plant
in the Kanté region.

98
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,245
Tékai, Fujiyama.

99
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,567
They're unaffected.

100
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,805
But my guess is these readings are just
aftershocks from the Philippine earthquake.

101
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,005
Are we at full function?

102
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,247
Yes, we are.

103
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,002
But perhaps we should be
drawing down, to be safe.

104
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,001
Take us offline.

105
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
- Now, Joe...
- Do it!

106
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,965
Now. Wind it down.

107
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,201
Sandra.

108
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,646
Sandra, are you there?

109
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,490
We're turning back.

110
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,602
Let's go.

111
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,764
My God.

112
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,686
Joe, are you there?

113
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,561
<i>Joe, there's been a breach.
We're heading back to the containment seal.</i>

114
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,689
Listen. You need to get out of there.

115
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,002
<i>If there's been a reactor breach,
you won't last five minutes...</i>

116
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,441
<i>...with or without the suits.</i>

117
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,488
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

118
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,210
I hear you. We're coming!

119
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,005
I'll meet them there myself.

120
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
Put the safety doors on manual override.

121
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:37,680
I cannot do that!

122
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,042
Keep the doors open. My wife is still in there!

123
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,922
Come on...

124
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,763
...let's go!

125
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,281
Tell me this door's...

126
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,089
...on manual.

127
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,283
<i>Yeah. But we are starting to breach!</i>

128
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,648
I'm here.
Soon as they're through, I'll seal it.

129
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,882
Sandra, can you...

130
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,969
...hear me? I'm at the door.

131
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,123
Sandra?

132
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,005
Sandra, I'm waiting for you.

133
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,651
<i>I'm at the checkpoint.</i>

134
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,729
<i>But you have to run as fast as you can.</i>

135
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,603
I am!

136
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,246
Kenji. Kenji...

137
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,720
...we need to go!

138
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,402
<i>Joe!</i>

139
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,240
<i>Close the door!</i>

140
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,687
<i>Seal the corridor
or the whole city will be exposed.</i>

141
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,721
Sandra?

142
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,367
<i>- Joe? Joe, can you hear me?</i>
- Yes.

143
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,123
<i>- Are you there?</i>
- Sandra, I'm here. Can you hear me?

144
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,801
<i>Yeah.</i>

145
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,211
<i>Joe, it's too late. We're not coming.</i>

146
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,283
No, don't say that! Don't you say that!

147
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,329
Run as hard as you can, honey.

148
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,843
<i>Joe, you have to close the door.</i>

149
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,401
<i>You have to live for our son.</i>

150
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,408
<i>- Joe, seal the door! Now!</i>
- My God.

151
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,125
<i>Five seconds! Four seconds!</i>

152
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,410
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,921
Take care of Ford.

154
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,362
Be a good father.

155
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,403
I will.

156
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,290
We didn't make it.

157
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,327
Let's go out!

158
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,051
Hurry! Come on! Ford!

159
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,691
On your feet!

160
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,324
You got family waiting for you?

161
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,761
I hope so.

162
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,206
How long you been away?

163
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,845
Fourteen months.

164
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,002
Take it slow.

165
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,442
It's the one thing they don't train you for.

166
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,168
All right! Let's go!

167
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,882
- I can't tell you.
- Can I see it?

168
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,161
Don't let him see.

169
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,961
Whoa. My God.

170
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,567
- It's a welcome home cake.
- Look at that.

171
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,767
That's you.

172
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,646
- And that's me.
- What's it say?

173
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,485
"Welcome home, Daddy."

174
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,520
Daddy's home.

175
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,643
- Daddy's home.
- Cake every night.

176
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,531
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- Daddy's home equals...

177
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,608
...cake every night.

178
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,969
How did you manage to get chocolate
on your eyeball?

179
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,167
- Daddy did it.
- Heh.

180
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,880
<i>I can't sleep with you...</i>

181
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,680
- ...making all this noise.
- Hee-hee-hee.

182
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,362
Come on, let's get you into bed.

183
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,603
Okay, big man.

184
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,047
Time to hit the rack.

185
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,441
Dad?

186
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,281
Yeah?

187
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,321
Are you still gonna be here tomorrow?

188
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,721
Yeah.

189
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,444
Come on, let's get some sleep.

190
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,531
Turns around, nose-to-nose,
he says, "At ease, lieutenant."

191
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,162
God, I missed your laugh.

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,490
I missed you.

193
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,481
I should get that. No, it could be work.

194
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,161
- I need to get that.
- You don't need to. Come on.

195
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,926
Hello?

196
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,283
Yeah, this is Mrs. Brody.

197
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,640
Tell him you're busy tending to
your husband's needs.

198
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,365
Shh.

199
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,203
Yeah, he's my husband.

200
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,768
Tell them we're not gonna buy it.

201
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,411
Yes, sir. Could you just hold on one moment?

202
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,086
It's the consulate.

203
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,602
Joe's been arrested in Japan.

204
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,529
Elle, I can't find my pants.

205
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,765
They're in the other drawer.

206
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,409
So why was he trespassing
in the quarantine zone?

207
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,926
Why do you think?

208
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,322
The lone crusader for the truth.

209
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,011
All his crackpot cuckoo theories.

210
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,483
Your father is a good man.
He just needs your help right now.

211
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,961
Ford, he's lost everything.

212
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,965
Yeah, so did I. But you know what?
I got over it.

213
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,929
Right. I can see that.

214
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,683
I'm sorry. It's just...

215
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,330
Every time I let him in close,
he always tries to drag me back.

216
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,246
And I can't. I can't put our family
through that.

217
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,688
Well, he is your family.

218
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,170
Hey. Come here.

219
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,891
You know you're only gonna be gone
for a few days, right?

220
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,922
And then you are gonna
come back to me.

221
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,444
Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,449
It's not the end of the world.

223
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,365
Papa.

224
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,211
I don't get many visitors.

225
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,926
Clearly.

226
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,881
This is you here.

227
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,607
Even, Ph.D.'s...

228
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,764
...don't get much teaching English
as a second language.

229
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,801
Here we go.

230
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,121
And a towel.

231
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,290
All right.

232
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,601
So...

233
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,970
...how's the bomb business?

234
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,447
It must be a growth area these days.

235
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,451
It's called "explosive ordnance disposal."

236
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,688
My job isn't dropping bombs.

237
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,564
It's stopping them.

238
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,528
- Dad.
- Hey...

239
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,045
...how's Elle doing?

240
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,282
And Sam. My God. He must be...

241
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,170
...what? Three? Three and a half?

242
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,890
He's almost 5.

243
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,286
I thought you were over this.
"Echolocation"?

244
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,123
- Hey.
- "Parasitic communication..."

245
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,688
Please don't, if you don't mind.
I have everything the way I like it.

246
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:04,764
I'm just...
I'm studying bioacoustics.

247
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,809
What were you doing, going back there?

248
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,884
- This trespassing stuff, that was bull.
- You broke the law.

249
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,840
I was trying to get back to our old house.

250
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,565
- In a quarantine zone.
- Precisely.

251
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,845
The new readings are exactly
like they were on that day...

252
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,485
...and I can prove it to you.

253
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,643
With a little luck, if I can get back...

254
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,126
...to the house...

255
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,081
...I can show you and the world this was
not from a natural disaster. This was...

256
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,321
Dad!

257
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,848
Your mom's out there, Ford.

258
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,641
To me...

259
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,809
...she'll always be there.

260
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,400
They evacuated us so quickly.

261
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,244
I don't even have a picture of her.

262
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,444
This has to stop.

263
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,967
You know I did everything I could.

264
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,281
You know that, right?

265
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,805
Let me take you home.

266
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,209
Come home with me.

267
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,129
I got a little boy who's desperate
to see his grandpa.

268
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,844
We can leave tomorrow.

269
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,761
What are you doing?

270
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,805
I'm heading back out there, Ford.

271
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,208
- No. I don't think so.
- One hour, in and out.

272
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,646
I have to go!

273
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,289
I came back here and wasted six years...

274
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,046
...staring through that barbed wire,
thinking it was...

275
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,807
...a military mistake or some horrible
design flaw they were covering up.

276
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,088
One day...

277
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,324
...I met a guy who runs
a cargo boat offshore.

278
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,687
Every day he goes right past
the reactor site.

279
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,890
So he places a couple frequency monitors
on buoys for me.

280
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,002
Two weeks ago...

281
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,045
I check this thing like every other day
just for the kick.

282
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,324
Two weeks ago, I'm tuning in...

283
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,364
...and, my God...

284
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,490
...there it is.

285
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,929
Whatever "it" is that's in there.

286
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,891
Whatever it is they're guarding
so carefully...

287
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,248
...started talking again.

288
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,965
And I mean talking.

289
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,561
Ha, ha.

290
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,487
I have to go back...

291
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,607
...to our house.

292
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,605
I need my old disks, if they're still there.

293
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,521
I need the data to be able to prove
a baseline here...

294
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,287
...that this isn't a fantasy,
that I'm not what you think I am.

295
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,925
I'm gonna find the truth...

296
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,487
...and end this.

297
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,290
Whatever it takes.

298
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,687
Why can't you just let it rest?

299
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,368
Because I sent her down there, son.

300
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,284
This wasn't just a reactor meltdown.

301
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,760
I don't wanna hear this.

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,048
I know. I know you don't.

303
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,489
But you can't keep running away.

304
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,129
And, son, you can't bury this in the past.

305
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,444
What spooked them?

306
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,644
Dad, come on. Let's go.
It's only another two blocks.

307
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,281
Dad!

308
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,720
Are we going home, or what?

309
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,089
Whoa! Hey, what are you doing?

310
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,481
Dad?

311
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,166
It's clean.

312
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,000
I knew it.

313
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,409
The radiation in this place should be lethal,
but there's nothing.

314
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,720
Thank God.

315
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,082
Are they rebuilding the plant?

316
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,124
I don't know. I haven't seen...

317
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,566
<i>Ten seconds. Ten seconds.</i>

318
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,847
Seven-point-two seconds
and getting stronger.

319
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,570
We're trending exponentially.

320
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,445
That's our new curve.

321
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,247
Jesus, it's worse than we thought.

322
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,651
Excuse me, Dr. Serizawa?

323
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,603
Two men were just arrested
in the Q-zone.

324
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,605
We've got bigger problems here.
Have Dr. Graham take a look.

325
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,689
She did, sir. She sent me.

326
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,287
One of them says
he used to work here, doctor.

327
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,209
You are not fooling anybody...

328
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,046
...when you say that
what happened 15 years ago...

329
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,760
Found these disks in his bag.

330
00:30:32,785 --> 00:30:34,410
...was a natural disaster.

331
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,160
Not sure what to make of them.

332
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,762
Not an earthquake, it wasn't a typhoon.
Okay? So stop...

333
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,082
Look, I'm tired of talking to you
about this.

334
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,361
I want my son.

335
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,809
I wanna see my son.
I wanna know that he's all right.

336
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,802
This guy, this guy knows.

337
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,520
He knows where he is.

338
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,529
I want my son.

339
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,441
And I want my bag and disks.

340
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,524
And I wanna talk to somebody
in charge, not you. No, not you.

341
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,524
I'm done talking to you.

342
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,322
All right? You're looking at me right now,
like I'm in a fish tank, right?

343
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,403
Fine. Because I know
what happened here.

344
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,451
And you keep telling everybody
that this place...

345
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,722
...is a death zone, but it's not.

346
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,166
You're lying.

347
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,164
Because what's really happening...

348
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,051
...is that you're hiding something
out there.

349
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,724
I'm right, aren't I?

350
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,329
My wife died here!

351
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,483
Something killed my wife.

352
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,643
And I have...

353
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,325
...a right to know!

354
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,608
I deserve answers!

355
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,806
All these items...

356
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,080
...they were found on him.

357
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,403
- And the date. Look, 15 years ago.
- I thought all of the data...

358
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,682
...from that day was lost.

359
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,887
I guess not.

360
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,448
You see?

361
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,728
You see? There it is again.

362
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,604
That is not a transformer malfunction.

363
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,888
That is an electromagnetic pulse.

364
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,120
It affects everything electrical...

365
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,606
...for miles and miles...

366
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,604
...and it is happening again.

367
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,207
This is what caused everything
in the first place.

368
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,965
Don't you see that?

369
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,646
And it is gonna send us
back to the Stone Age.

370
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,881
You have no idea what's coming.

371
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,615
Pulses are seconds apart.

372
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,840
They're getting stronger.
It's affecting the power grid.

373
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,081
Any radiation leakage?

374
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,890
Gamma levels are still zero.

375
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,724
It sucked all three reactors dry.

376
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,244
It's done feeding.

377
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,807
What's this?

378
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,320
- It's the same pattern.
- Fifteen years ago...

379
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:04,124
- ...it's what caused the meltdown.
- An electromagnetic...

380
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,160
...pulse. That's what it's building to.
Converting all that radiation...

381
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,650
...until it hatches.

382
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,649
We have to shut down.

383
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,446
Secure the grid.

384
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,847
Wildfire protocols.

385
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,329
All personnel,
clear the first perimeter immediately!

386
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,967
What's going on? Hey, where you going?

387
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,727
Grid's secure.

388
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,805
Kill it.

389
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,683
All readings are flatlined.

390
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,491
Ahem.

391
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,206
Get a visual.

392
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,444
Jesus. Check the grid. Hit us
with an EMP. We're losing power!

393
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,080
- Get the backup generators online.
- Working on it.

394
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,685
That pulse fried every circuit.

395
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,241
- Check the cage.
- Trying the backup generators.

396
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,527
Here we go.

397
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,921
Everybody out!

398
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,009
Now!

399
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,606
Hey! Let me out! Hey!

400
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,486
No! No, wait!

401
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,323
Stop!

402
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,721
Ford!

403
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,169
Dad!

404
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,129
<i>It was unlike anything
I've ever experienced before.</i>

405
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,124
Yeah, it's, Ford Brody.

406
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,283
Japan to San Francisco.

407
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,444
Okay, could I at least...
If you could let me leave you my cell...

408
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,722
Hello?

409
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,326
Damn it!

410
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,205
I'm sorry.

411
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,762
Hey, it's okay.

412
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,010
It's okay. Daddy's gonna be okay.

413
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,330
Daddy's gonna be okay.

414
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,447
<i>This area is now under
Naval military jurisdiction.</i>

415
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,125
<i>All personnel must report...</i>

416
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,681
<i>...to the duty officer for debriefing.</i>

417
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,370
Dr. Serizawa!

418
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,051
Dr. Serizawa!

419
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,050
Dr. Serizawa.

420
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,850
Captain Russell Hampton.

421
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,880
Glad to find you. I've been briefed...

422
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,764
...on your work with Operation Monarch.

423
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,844
Now, I'm told your organization
has situational awareness...

424
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,650
...of our unidentified creature?

425
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,326
Is that right?

426
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,845
We are now taking over
operational authority...

427
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,003
...from Monarch. So I'm gonna need you...

428
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,202
...to come with me.

429
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,442
Is there any other personnel you need?

430
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,006
They'll take care of you.

431
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,480
I'll be right next to you.

432
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,201
Okay.

433
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,641
Them.

434
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,642
- Let's get his Vitals.
- Shh. Shh.

435
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,123
- Dad. Dad.
- Radial pulse is weak. I'm counting 125.

436
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,325
It's okay.

437
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,440
You were right.

438
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,446
I'm sorry.

439
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,884
Go home to your family.

440
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,927
You keep them safe.

441
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,609
- Okay?
- Okay.

442
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,165
Whatever it takes.

443
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,726
Whatever it ta...

444
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,684
Hey, stay with me.

445
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,922
Dad?

446
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,367
- Dad?
- Radial pulse is weaker. Barely feel it.

447
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,408
We're losing him.

448
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,800
- Joe, can you hear me?
- He's going into A-fib.

449
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,288
Give me another epi, one milligram,
and 40 units of vasopressin.

450
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,000
Stay with us. Come on, Joe.
Hang in there, buddy.

451
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,642
This is our needle in a haystack, people.

452
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,321
MUTO.

453
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,291
Massive unidentified terrestrial organism.

454
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,002
It is, however, no longer terrestrial.
It is airborne.

455
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,402
The world still thinks
this was an earthquake...

456
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,967
...and it would be preferable that
that remain so.

457
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,365
Before we lost sight, it was
headed east across the Pacific...

458
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,568
...and had emitted enough
EMP disruption...

459
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,406
...to create havoc with
our radar and satellite feeds...

460
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,486
...and reduce us, for the moment,
to a strictly visual pursuit.

461
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,643
I emphasize "for the moment"...

462
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,008
...because we will get on our game...

463
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,129
...and we will find this thing.

464
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,965
It is imperative that we do so.

465
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,041
Captain, I want any...

466
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,489
- ...and all search options on this table ASAP.
- Yes, sir.

467
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,050
Dr. Serizawa.

468
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,447
Admiral William Stenz.

469
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,241
- Nice to meet you.
- Glad to have you on board.

470
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,601
Sensei.

471
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,161
Excuse me.

472
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,881
- <i>Authorities issued a statement...
- Brody's dead.</i>

473
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,720
<i>...claiming the nuclear contamination...</i>

474
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,851
<i>...is at no risk of spreading,
even as the death toll rises.</i>

475
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,610
Lieutenant Brody?

476
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,124
Dr. Serizawa.

477
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,604
My condolences.

478
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,766
We are deeply sorry for your loss,
lieutenant.

479
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,888
But I'm afraid we need your help.

480
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,848
<i>This is the USS Nautilus.</i>

481
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:27,920
In 1954...

482
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,206
...the first time a nuclear submarine
ever reached the lower depths...

483
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,407
- ...it awakened something.
- The Americans...

484
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,847
...first thought that it was the Russians.

485
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,082
The Russians thought that it was them.

486
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,041
All those nuclear bomb tests
in the '50s...?

487
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,363
Not tests.

488
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,449
They were trying to kill it.

489
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,121
Him.

490
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,770
- An ancient alpha predator.
- Millions of years...

491
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,331
...older than mankind.

492
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,720
From an age when the Earth...

493
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,763
...was 10 times more radioactive
than today.

494
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,643
This animal and others like it...

495
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,531
...consumed this radiation as a food source.

496
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,081
As the levels on the surface
naturally subsided...

497
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,527
...these creatures adapted
to live deeper in the oceans.

498
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,565
Further underground.

499
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,560
Absorbing radiation
from the planet's core.

500
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,203
The organization we work for, Monarch,
was established...

501
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,204
...in the wake of this discovery.

502
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,365
A multinational coalition...

503
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,971
...formed in secrecy...

504
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,600
...to search for him.

505
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,886
Study him.

506
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,964
Learn everything we could.

507
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,921
We call him...

508
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,126
<i>...Gojira.</i>

509
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,242
The top of...

510
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,209
...a primordial ecosystem.

511
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,369
A god, for all intents and purposes.

512
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,567
- A monster.
- Fifteen years ago...

513
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,361
...we found a fossil of another giant animal
in the Philippines.

514
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,570
Like Gojira. But this creature...

515
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,046
...died long ago.

516
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,089
Killed by these.

517
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,925
Parasitic spores.

518
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,927
One dormant. But the other hatched.
Catalyzed when a mining company...

519
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,242
...unknowingly drilled into its tomb.

520
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,365
The hatchling burrowed straight for
the nearest source of radiation...

521
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,166
...your father's power plant in Janjira...

522
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,171
...and cocooned there for 15 years,
absorbing its radioactive fuel...

523
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,171
- ...to gestate, to grow.
- Until it hatched...

524
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,841
...like a butterfly into the creature
you saw today.

525
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,889
Wait. You knew about this?

526
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,243
This thing? The whole time?
Why didn't you...

527
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,120
- ...kill it when you had the chance?
- It was absorbing...

528
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:33,728
...radiation from the reactors.

529
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,126
We worried killing it...

530
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,284
...might release that radiation
and endanger millions.

531
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,966
That's why our mission was to contain it.

532
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,124
To study its biology, to understand it.

533
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,880
We knew the creature
was having an electrical effect...

534
00:45:46,905 --> 00:45:48,848
...on everything within a close proximity.

535
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,047
What we didn't know...

536
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,647
...was that it could harness
this same power...

537
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,962
...in an EMP attack.

538
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,285
But your father did.

539
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,411
He predicted it.

540
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,529
What else did he say?

541
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,121
Please try to remember, Mr. Brody.

542
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,722
Anything that would help us.
Anything at all.

543
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,450
I didn't listen.

544
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,009
I just thought he was crazy.

545
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,888
He was obsessed with all this...

546
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,686
Said something about an animal call.

547
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:24,531
Something talking.

548
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,201
Talking?

549
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,889
He said he was studying something.

550
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,925
Echolocation.

551
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,161
If the MUTO was talking that day...

552
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:38,083
...your father must have discovered
something talking back.

553
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,686
- Check again.
- Yup.

554
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,485
Search for a response call.

555
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,370
This parasite.

556
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,202
It's still out there. Where's it headed?

557
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,010
The MUTO is young...

558
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,281
...growing.

559
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,125
It will be looking for food.

560
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,529
Sources of radiation.

561
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,001
We're monitoring all known sites...

562
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,200
...but if we don't find it soon...

563
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:02,971
Then what?

564
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,645
Nature has an order.

565
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,090
A power to restore balance.

566
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,409
I believe he is that power.

567
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:19,091
Sir, right now we're 50 miles from Hawaii.

568
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,607
This transport will take you there.

569
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,921
You're catching a commercial flight
back to San Francisco.

570
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,247
I'm gonna need you to brush your teeth.

571
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,604
- Disgusting! Those are terrible!
- Ha, ha.

572
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,920
We gotta brush them!

573
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,200
<i>Citizens within a 100-mile radius...</i>

574
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:50,354
<i>...are being temporarily evacuated
from the area.</i>

575
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,804
<i>Hey, this is Elle.
You missed me. Please leave a message.</i>

576
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,566
Elle.

577
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,729
I don't know what they're saying
on the news.

578
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,201
There was an accident in Japan.

579
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,691
Dad's gone.

580
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,569
I'll explain when I see you.

581
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,284
I'm headed to Hawaii.
I'm gonna catch a flight from there.

582
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,370
I'll see you soon.

583
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,285
Keep scrolling.

584
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,561
Near the end. Before the EMP.

585
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,328
There.

586
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,564
Something responded.

587
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:53,531
<i>Aloha, and welcome aboard.</i>

588
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,967
<i>The train will begin moving shortly.</i>

589
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,483
<i>For the comfort of others,
no smoking, please. Thank you.</i>

590
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,365
<i>Please remember to stay clear
of the automatic doors.</i>

591
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,681
Akio!

592
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,246
Mama!

593
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,003
Mama!

594
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,841
Hey, hey, hey.

595
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:14,683
Mama!

596
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,680
I can't open it.
Look, don't worry. Just wait there.

597
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,680
I'll bring him back.

598
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,568
Okay?

599
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,840
- Mama!
- Hey, hey.

600
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,100
Mama!

601
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,129
- Whoa. Hey. Whoa, kid.
- Mama!

602
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,289
It's okay. I'm gonna bring him back.

603
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,482
All right. I'm gonna set you down there.

604
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,095
I'll get you back to your parents.

605
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:33,882
Okay?

606
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,926
Here. Is this what you want?

607
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,282
Take good care of him for me.

608
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,651
I better not miss my flight, kid.

609
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,682
Admiral, received an intel report.

610
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,043
We lost track of a nuclear Akula
50 nautical miles northwest of Hawaii.

611
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,566
Could be the MUTO.

612
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,923
Just got word of a missing Russian sub
in the North Pacific.

613
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,927
Martinez?

614
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,004
Aye. Special Forces Team Sparta 1
is picking up a distress signal...

615
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,242
...northwest of Diamond Head
on the island of Oahu.

616
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,284
They're on the ground,
headed to the beacon.

617
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,483
<i>...on 5.23 north-northeast...</i>

618
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,007
<i>...of the last beacon. Moving in on foot.</i>

619
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,084
Wanna tell me why we're looking...

620
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,731
...for an Akula in the jungle?

621
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,923
Probably a glitch. Russians said they...

622
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,491
...got a ping from this location.

623
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,882
Hey, I got a reading. It's right up ahead.

624
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,000
<i>Sparta 1, this is Hawkeye.</i>

625
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:44,448
<i>We're getting the same ping off
the transponder. Range 30 meters.</i>

626
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,324
<i>Looks like you're getting warm.</i>

627
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,005
What the hell?

628
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,930
Jesus.

629
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,890
My God.

630
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,889
Guardian 3, we located your Russian sub.

631
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:25,642
<i>You're not gonna believe
what else we found.</i>

632
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,802
Holy shit.

633
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,724
<i>It appears to be rising
approximately 20 to 30 meters...</i>

634
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,961
<i>...above the tree line.</i>

635
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,810
<i>We can't tell how wide it is.</i>

636
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,725
Cat's out of the bag, doctor.
No more secrets.

637
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,167
Our highest priority now is safety.

638
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,846
There's close to a million people
on that island.

639
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,727
Get me eyes in the air.

640
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,083
We're picking up something else.
Approaching from the Pacific.

641
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,209
We need to check out that object.

642
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,601
General quarters.

643
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,610
Bridge, this is the captain.

644
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:01,962
- Where you going?
- Up to the flight deck.

645
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,531
I think he is coming.

646
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,961
What are you doing?

647
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,850
I have to see this.

648
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,125
Whoa.

649
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,241
Two Charlie Six, we are circling the target.
Go on your command.

650
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,365
Stand by, got a visual. Bogey at my 12.

651
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,165
Be advised. Prepare to engage target.

652
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,415
We're getting movement...

653
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,407
...down here.

654
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,448
Take cover!

655
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:38,608
Control, I have...

656
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,569
...no power. I say again, I've lost all...

657
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,131
You all right?

658
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,641
You give it 10 seconds,
lights gonna come back on.

659
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,051
It's okay.

660
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,961
- What was that?
- Did you see that?

661
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,650
What is it?

662
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:22,687
Dad!

663
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:24,681
Zoe?

664
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,481
Zoe!

665
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,085
My God.

666
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,888
Run. Run! Tsunami! Tsunami!

667
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,083
Target spotted offshore...

668
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,840
...two knots due east of your position.
Could be a second bogey.

669
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,006
Anybody hurt?

670
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,527
- Anyone get an eyeball on the bogey?
- Where is he?

671
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,921
There you go.

672
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,366
What did I tell you?

673
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,008
<i>...please. Thank you.</i>

674
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:52,849
Get down!

675
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:06,843
Let's go!

676
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,360
<i>Remember to stay...</i>

677
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,402
<i>...clear of the doors.</i>

678
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,291
Go, go, go!

679
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,880
<i>Target in sight...</i>

680
00:58:38,905 --> 00:58:42,273
- ...two o'clock, 300 meters.
- We're on 6-X-01. Target confirmed.

681
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,521
Jesus!

682
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,761
<i>Can you tell us what happened?</i>

683
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,767
<i>... and everybody started running
and screaming.</i>

684
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,967
Sam, please turn that TV off.

685
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,964
Hey, did you hear me?

686
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,281
Off.

687
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,366
Come on, Sammy. Let's go.

688
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,331
Let's go. It's bedtime.

689
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,121
- Sammy.
- Mommy, look.

690
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,209
Dinosaurs.

691
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:24,691
<i>Attention, please. Incoming patients...</i>

692
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,321
- ...please proceed...
- Excuse me.

693
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,011
Hi. Excuse me. I'm sorry.

694
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,208
This boy's been separated from his parents.

695
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,640
Fill this out. Be with you...

696
01:00:32,665 --> 01:00:33,905
...in just a minute.

697
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,763
Hey, you got service on that cell phone?

698
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,764
No. The pay phones don't even work.

699
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:52,247
- Akio!
- Akio!

700
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,165
Mama! Papa!

701
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,324
Corporal, load up, load up.

702
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,762
Sergeant. Lieutenant Brody, U.S. Navy.

703
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,367
I need your help.
I'm trying to get to the mainland.

704
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,291
It's your lucky day.
Everything not tied down is moving east.

705
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:13,688
- Whoa, is that where they're heading?
- Yeah.

706
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,209
I guess we're monster hunters now.

707
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:38,280
<i>Satellite transfer complete.</i>

708
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,249
Simulations uploaded.

709
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,970
Satellite tracking continues.

710
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,931
Last satellite tracks predict
the MUTO continuing due east.

711
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,695
All our models have the targets
converging on the Pacific Coast.

712
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,135
As of now, it looks like Godzilla's
still following the MUTO.

713
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,366
He's hunting.

714
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,566
Have all vessels maintain
current distance from target.

715
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,041
And plot the speed and heading
of these things.

716
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,886
I wanna know exactly when and where
they'll make landfall.

717
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,406
Yes, sir.

718
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,529
Doctor, what did you mean by "hunting"?

719
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,402
You think it's chasing this MUTO?

720
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,449
But if the MUTO is his prey...

721
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,205
The signal shows a call.

722
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:14,488
- Why call up a predator?
- No, it didn't.

723
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,642
I think Godzilla...

724
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,166
...was only listening.

725
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,286
The MUTO was calling something else.

726
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,406
The pattern.

727
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:31,010
Focus the search on Nevada.

728
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,083
Nevada? Why would it go to Nevada?

729
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:36,005
- It can't be. It's impossible.
- What's impossible?

730
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,086
There was another spore, intact,
found in the Philippine mine.

731
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,364
But we vivisected it.

732
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,409
Ran every test on it for years.

733
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:47,405
You confirmed it for yourself.
It was dormant!

734
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,244
Maybe not anymore.

735
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,642
This spore. Where is it now, doctor?

736
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,645
It was highly radioactive.
It was disposed of.

737
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,291
The Americans, they took it.

738
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,124
Doctor, where is it?

739
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,405
Where you put all your nuclear waste.

740
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,970
Go, go, go!

741
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,169
Right, let's go! Give me a Mark I...

742
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:37,440
...eyeball on every vault.

743
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,123
Clear!

744
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:43,961
Clear!

745
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,009
Clear!

746
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,049
- Clear!
- Clear!

747
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,202
Clear!

748
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,002
- Clear!
- Clear!

749
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,041
Hey!

750
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,650
Is anyone in there?

751
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,888
<i>Captain, our UAVs have footage
of the new MUTO.</i>

752
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,120
Let's have a look.

753
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,321
Yes, sir.

754
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,090
This is from five minutes ago.

755
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:24,685
My God.

756
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,731
Playing all we have now.

757
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,645
It's almost 300 feet.

758
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,844
It's far bigger than the other one.

759
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,164
But this one doesn't have any wings.

760
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,125
A different sex?

761
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,446
A female.

762
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,644
That's who he's been talking to.

763
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,650
It must be a mating call.

764
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,526
The female remained dormant
until the male matured.

765
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,004
Now they're seeking radiation.

766
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,845
To reproduce.

767
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,687
Current tracking models indicate that
all three targets are converging here:

768
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:03,921
San Francisco Bay.

769
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:07,409
But if we rig a nuclear warhead
with a shielded timer...

770
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,200
...put it on a boat and send it...

771
01:06:09,225 --> 01:06:10,167
...20 miles out...

772
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:12,204
...the radiation lures the MUTOs...

773
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,569
...and the MUTOs lure Godzilla.

774
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,804
And we detonate,
with minimal fallout risk to the city.

775
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,805
You can't be serious.
They feed on radiation.

776
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,526
Correct. That's why we use
the bomb as bait.

777
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,841
And kill them...

778
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,044
- ...with the sheer force of the blast.
- This is crazy.

779
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:31,364
Doctor, if you have any other ideas,
I am all ears.

780
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,840
Admiral.

781
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,931
Yes, doctor?

782
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,005
<i>Gojira</i> may be the answer.

783
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:40,282
I believe...

784
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,966
...he's here to restore balance.

785
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,050
He can defeat them.

786
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,851
And what? We just stand by and watch?

787
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:51,004
I'm sorry, doctor. I can't take that risk.

788
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,975
Prep the warheads
and get them moving to the coast.

789
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,604
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

790
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,245
I know you don't agree with this.

791
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,328
But my first priority
is to safeguard our citizens.

792
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,926
It's stopped.

793
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,161
Yes.

794
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,485
Eight-fifteen in the morning.

795
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:32,849
August 6, 1945.

796
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,125
Hiroshima.

797
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,290
It was my father's.

798
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,328
Heads up.

799
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,528
We've got new destination, new orders.

800
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:57,687
Let's get geared up.

801
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,961
Hey, Tech sergeant.

802
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,201
What's the word?

803
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,931
Another one of those things
popped up in Nevada, sir.

804
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,683
Okay, everybody out.

805
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,084
Can't fly any further.

806
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,369
We're well in range of its EMP.

807
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,161
So from here on out, it's on the ground
or it's not at all. Let's go!

808
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:54,641
All right, listen up!

809
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:58,248
This train and these weapons
are headed to San Francisco.

810
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,000
Anyone not part of this mission,
disembark now!

811
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,241
<i>Negative.</i>

812
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,367
Can't do it, sir.

813
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,321
This is a high-risk mission.
That train is a national asset, not Amtrak.

814
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:12,846
- We good to go?
- Just about.

815
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,930
From the look of the casings
on those Minuteman ICBMS...

816
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:20,165
...guessing the digital module's been bypassed
and you're prepping for full analog retrofit.

817
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,130
Is my jaw supposed to drop?

818
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,850
I get it. You're EOD.

819
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,841
- I got my crew, they know what they're doing.
- Aim the pointy end...

820
01:09:26,866 --> 01:09:28,436
...at the monsters, right, Sarge?

821
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,320
When was the last time you let one of
your guys put their fingers in a live bomb?

822
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,485
Look, this is what I do.

823
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,085
This is my job.

824
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:40,765
Master sergeant.

825
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,049
My family's in the city.

826
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,007
Okay? I need to get on that train.

827
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,255
<i>You heard the spokesman say...</i>

828
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,363
<i>...that the White House has not ruled
out the use of nuclear force.</i>

829
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,408
Sam, your mom's gonna be right back.

830
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,524
Emergency, can I help you?

831
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:04,041
Hello?

832
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,890
Yeah, just a sec.

833
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:08,686
Elle, for you.

834
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,241
- Tell them I'll be there in a minute.
- Elle.

835
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,125
It's your husband.

836
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:18,248
Hello?

837
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:19,567
Elle?

838
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,726
<i>Ford?</i>

839
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,281
<i>God.</i>

840
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,364
<i>- You all right? How's Sam?</i>
- I've been calling you everywhere.

841
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,647
- You okay?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>

842
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:31,089
- I've got Sam with me.
<i>- Great. Because I wanna get you both...</i>

843
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,765
Can't believe this is happening.

844
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,001
<i>Ford.</i>

845
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:36,605
<i>You okay? Are you doing okay?</i>

846
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:39,247
<i>I'm okay. Elle, please don't worry.</i>

847
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,448
Baby, I'm so scared right now.

848
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:42,408
<i>I know.</i>

849
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:46,601
I'm gonna be at the hospital by sunrise.

850
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,810
Then I'll get you and Sam out.

851
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,488
Okay.

852
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,888
<i>The military has a plan
to deal with these things.</i>

853
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:55,050
<i>I'm coming to get you both, okay?</i>

854
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,566
Okay.

855
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,010
Can you please just hurry?

856
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,366
<i>I Will.</i>

857
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,283
<i>Elle?</i>

858
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,567
I just wanted you to know that I love you.

859
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,603
I love you too. Just be safe.

860
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,206
I'll see you soon.

861
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,643
Good to go! Let's move out!

862
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,604
<i>As blackouts and electrical interference...</i>

863
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,360
<i>...radiate farther and farther west...</i>

864
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:41,161
<i>...citizens within 200 miles of the creature's
current sphere of influence...</i>

865
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,488
<i>...are being urged to please find shelter...</i>

866
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,007
<i>...stay indoors and stay off the roads.</i>

867
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,240
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

868
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,645
<i>...kids in the car.</i>

869
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,281
<i>...debris going back about two miles.</i>

870
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:56,683
<i>This girl is not breathing.</i>

871
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,971
<i>... people that are hurt.
Send somebody out here now!</i>

872
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,761
Yes, sir.

873
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,247
Yes, warheads are on the move.

874
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,404
I completely agree, sir.

875
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,086
All right, people. Let's go.

876
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,971
I need to know the exact location
of the MUTOs ASAP.

877
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,443
Aye. We're updating
our models with the current tracking data now.

878
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,806
Admiral.

879
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,561
Yes?

880
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:33,050
Please don't do this.

881
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,168
I understand your concerns, doctor.

882
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,085
But I am sacrificing lives...

883
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,688
...every minute trying to steer one of
these things clear of population centers...

884
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,600
...and now there are two more on the way.

885
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,489
There are millions of lives at risk.
So all I want to know...

886
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,761
...from you is:

887
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,367
Will it work and can they be killed?

888
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,811
But we tried that before.

889
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,691
We're talking dialable yield.
Megatons, not kilotons.

890
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,524
Nothing can withstand that blast.

891
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,162
Makes the bomb we tried to kill it with
in '54 look like a firecracker.

892
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,925
- Sergeant Morales. Give me a hand.
- I thought these nukes...

893
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,851
- ...all detonated by remote control.
- The MUTOS knock out...

894
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,246
...everything electric.

895
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,084
Including detonators.

896
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,005
Can't even get in range
without these things going haywire.

897
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,407
But this?

898
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,041
This, on the other hand, is old-school.

899
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,406
Clockwork.

900
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,760
Takes a licking...

901
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:39,280
- ...keeps on ticking.
- Heh.

902
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:57,002
Holy shit.

903
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:00,921
Sergeant Morales, get down here
with that radio. On the double. Move, move!

904
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:10,366
Snake Eyes,
this is Bravo to November. Is the bridge...

905
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,647
...clear? Over.

906
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:15,927
I say again:

907
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,844
We got a train of VIP cargo...

908
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,811
...headed for the coast.
Is the bridge clear? Over.

909
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,206
Snake Eyes, I need a sitrep.

910
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,851
Are the tracks clear?

911
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:29,005
We are at phase line yellow. In the next
10 mikes, we're advancing to phase line red.

912
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,730
Secure or not? Over.

913
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,125
You think it's intact?

914
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,729
Only one way to find out.

915
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,450
- You wanna take the top?
- Sure.

916
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:07,246
You check below. Sergeant Morales,
you come with me.

917
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:30,528
Shit.

918
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,125
Jesus.

919
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,166
- Jones, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm good!

920
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,646
The bridge is intact.

921
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,126
Bulldog, this is Eagle.

922
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,725
All clear to move out. Over.

923
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,525
Roger that, Eagle.

924
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:23,363
Let's go! Let's go, people!

925
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:28,927
Say again.

926
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,084
I do not have a visual.
What is your position? Over.

927
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:35,007
Unreadable. Say again. Over.

928
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,731
Hit the deck.

929
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:13,721
Help me turn it off, man.

930
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:00,603
Run!

931
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:03,842
Move it, run!

932
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,926
Ford! Aah!

933
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,441
<i>He's going under!</i>

934
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,840
Boats, sound the collision alarm.

935
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,411
Frame 180.

936
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,244
We're losing visual, admiral.

937
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:02,926
He's diving.

938
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:07,246
Changing course and moving fast.
I've got him at 33 knots and picking up speed.

939
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:08,891
He's gonna outrun us, sir.

940
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,240
Watch the swinging!

941
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:09,766
No swing!

942
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,763
Hey!

943
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,201
Hold on!

944
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,046
Medic!

945
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:23,683
<i>They are insisting civilians
make their way to the BART stations.</i>

946
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,566
<i>BART stations are designated shelters.</i>

947
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,889
These patients are my responsibility.
Where are you taking them?

948
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,282
Across the bridges.
Critical and children only.

949
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:36,206
Shelters are gonna fill up fast.
Trust me, they'll be safer outside the city.

950
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,770
- I can take Sam.
- No, no, no.

951
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,762
Ford's on his way.

952
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,651
If you change your mind,
the buses leave in 10 minutes.

953
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,404
Come on. Where are you, Ford?

954
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:48,844
This way! Keep them moving!

955
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,565
Let's go. Come on, come on.

956
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,407
Hey! Where are they taking it?

957
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,246
Twenty miles offshore, convergence point.

958
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,323
We're gonna lure them there.

959
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,162
Three birds, one stone.

960
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,201
Wait!

961
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,645
Okay, Sammy.

962
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,120
Laura, thank God.

963
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:46,204
Sammy, you remember Laura.
She's Mommy's work friend, right?

964
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,722
She's gonna look after you
for a little bit.

965
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,240
Daddy's gonna be here soon.

966
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,721
And I'm gonna just
come get you right after.

967
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,166
I promise.

968
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:55,447
Okay.

969
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,041
Okay?

970
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,087
Come on, sweetheart.
You're gonna come with me.

971
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,810
Your mom's gonna stay and help.

972
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,167
Elle, I'm gonna take care of him, okay?

973
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:10,091
- Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy."
- Bye, Mommy.

974
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,731
I got him! I got him!

975
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:42,200
Just sit down here.

976
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:43,601
Sit, sit.

977
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,483
Here.

978
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,926
Did you lose consciousness?

979
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:49,481
I'm okay. Really, I'm fine.

980
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:55,563
Sitrep, please. Location of targets?

981
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,406
Male MUTO was spotted
30 miles off the Farallon Islands.

982
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,166
Showing seismic activity
to the east near Livermore.

983
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,890
Should be the female closing in.

984
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:03,840
Where's Godzilla?

985
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:05,600
Last contact was five hours ago.

986
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,048
Maintaining a bearing of 053 degrees,
descending below a depth of 10,000 feet.

987
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:10,281
Be here within the hour.

988
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:13,569
<i>Residents are trying
to get out of the city any way they can.</i>

989
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:16,844
There's still buses on that bridge.

990
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,925
Come on!

991
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:28,809
Let's get those busses through. Let's go!

992
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:36,244
We're not gonna stop the buses here.

993
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,288
What?

994
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,721
I can't hear you. Kids...

995
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,450
...please be quiet.

996
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,840
Move into position till you have
a clean line of sight!

997
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,962
Portside! Two hundred meters!

998
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,281
Brace!

999
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,531
Hold your fire.

1000
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,171
Hold your fire.

1001
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:21,564
Holy shit.

1002
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:28,368
Shit!

1003
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:31,041
- Hold on!
- Watch out!

1004
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,765
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1005
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,202
Look out!

1006
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,330
Get down! Get down in your seats!

1007
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,567
Please! Get down!

1008
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,367
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

1009
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:49,882
Hey!

1010
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,323
Move out! Move, move, move!

1011
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,569
Striker! There's civilians
on the bridge. Hold your fire!

1012
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,001
Open fire!

1013
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,722
Move! Move!

1014
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:01,604
- All right, get in there!
- Prepare to arm the device!

1015
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,684
Ready! You got it?

1016
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:06,880
I'm all set.

1017
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:10,926
Arming keys!

1018
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:17,681
Three! Two! One!

1019
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,806
What the hell was that?

1020
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:30,962
EMP.

1021
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,328
Engine's stopped! We lost power!

1022
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,083
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1023
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:23,722
- Fire!
- Incoming!

1024
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:04,125
Sam Brody was checked into the Oakland
Coliseum shelter an hour ago. He is safe.

1025
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,966
No record of Elle Brody.
Never made it out of the city.

1026
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:11,205
Well, check again. Please.
I told her to wait for me, and I didn't make it.

1027
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:14,410
They are trying to get everyone downtown
into subway shelters.

1028
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,324
I'm sure your wife is fine.

1029
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:20,881
Lieutenant Brody!

1030
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,122
I'm looking for Lieutenant Brody.

1031
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,803
- Are you Brody?
- Yes.

1032
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,044
Okay. The male delivered the warhead
to the center of downtown.

1033
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:32,689
That puts 100,000 civilians
in the blast radius.

1034
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:33,960
We can't stop it remotely.

1035
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:38,130
An analog timer has been installed. The MUTOS
are frying electronics within a five-mile bubble.

1036
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:40,200
Means approaching from ground
is not an option.

1037
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,250
That's why we'll be conducting
a HALO insertion. Jumping altitude...

1038
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,891
...will be 30,000 feet.

1039
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:47,606
We just skate to the top and drop. Here.

1040
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:51,686
And here. If you don't hit a skyscraper
on the way, meet at rally point Charlie.

1041
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,611
- Right here. Good?
- Doctor, any guesses where to look?

1042
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,086
Underground.

1043
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,084
If the MUTOS have spawned...

1044
01:30:58,320 --> 01:30:59,924
...they'll be building a nest.

1045
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,807
Captain, when you find the warhead...

1046
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,929
...how long to disarm it?
- Without seeing...

1047
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,084
- ...the analog mod, I couldn't even guess.
- Sixty seconds...

1048
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:10,765
...if I can access it.

1049
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,770
I retrofitted that device myself.

1050
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,800
Lieutenant Brody is our only...

1051
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,968
...EOD Tech to survive the train attack.

1052
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,084
Well, it sounds like we could use you.

1053
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,487
With all due respect...

1054
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,645
- ...if that doesn't work, then what's Plan B?
- The waterfront...

1055
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,769
...is located one klick downhill.

1056
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,008
Get the bomb to the pier, onto a boat...

1057
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:32,289
...and as far away from the city
as possible before it detonates.

1058
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:37,405
Any questions?

1059
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,401
- Dismissed.
- That's it.

1060
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:40,681
Let's move.

1061
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,206
Lieutenant?

1062
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,244
They've already been briefed.

1063
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,170
We have no extraction plan.

1064
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,643
If you don't walk out,
you don't come back at all.

1065
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:53,449
Sir, I'll do whatever it takes.

1066
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:14,286
This alpha predator of yours, doctor...

1067
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,921
...do you really think he has a chance?

1068
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:24,171
The arrogance of man is thinking
nature is in our control...

1069
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,483
...and not the other way around.

1070
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:32,844
Let them fight.

1071
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,968
Lord God, we give thanks...

1072
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:31,129
...for the opportunities you have given us...

1073
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:34,250
...going together as comrades
to defend our great nation.

1074
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,723
We thank you for the time and service
that you have given us together.

1075
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,002
Now as we are about to leave one another...

1076
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,163
...let us have the strength...

1077
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,446
Take position! Take position!

1078
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:35,131
I saw Team 1 move to the east.

1079
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,680
Two of our team members didn't make it.
I heard bits and pieces on the radio.

1080
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,600
Snipers on the rooftop
moving into position.

1081
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,525
Here we go. Picking up the nuke.

1082
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:44,363
Which way?

1083
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,761
One klick up the hill.

1084
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:46,922
We found the warhead.

1085
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,322
Let's go! Up the hill, this direction. Move.

1086
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,931
Hey. Hey.

1087
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,446
Look.

1088
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,009
Let's move, let's move.

1089
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:31,401
On my six.

1090
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,800
Sarge, get a look at this.

1091
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,082
We gotta get moving.
You got a signal yet?

1092
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,287
I got it.

1093
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,362
It's down there.

1094
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:20,327
All right, move, move!

1095
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:30,451
Grab a line!

1096
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:36,485
More light. Grazer.

1097
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:01,482
Right, clear out.

1098
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,602
Here we go.

1099
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,646
Whoa, look out, heads up!

1100
01:40:05,440 --> 01:40:06,521
How much time we got left?

1101
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,923
We have 27 mikes.

1102
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,409
We gotta get this thing down.

1103
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:44,283
Move, move, I got you!

1104
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,726
Move it out, move it out!

1105
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,530
Careful! Careful.

1106
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:23,290
And down in three...

1107
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,089
...two...

1108
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:25,367
...one.

1109
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,881
Let's get this cover off.

1110
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:28,000
Lieutenant, you're up.

1111
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,280
It's not budging. It's sealed shut.

1112
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,520
We need time to open it.

1113
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:37,607
We don't have time!

1114
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:39,171
We gotta get it on a boat.

1115
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:41,010
Grab the warhead! Let's move!

1116
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:42,247
Go!

1117
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:44,568
Easy.

1118
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:47,042
Easy, easy.

1119
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,890
Move it out, guys!

1120
01:41:54,280 --> 01:41:55,805
Lieutenant, let's go!

1121
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,246
Lieutenant?

1122
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:32,521
What the hell was that?

1123
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:34,205
Holy shit! Did you see that?

1124
01:44:55,480 --> 01:44:56,606
This way.

1125
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,371
Faster, faster.

1126
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,005
Let's get this thing started.

1127
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:07,326
Find the ignition, sir?

1128
01:45:07,680 --> 01:45:09,045
Give me that pack.

1129
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:10,686
Here you go.

1130
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,404
Come on, come on. Hurry.

1131
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:42,609
Hurry it up. Let's go, let's go!

1132
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,490
She's coming for the bomb!

1133
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:50,842
Let's get this weapon secured.

1134
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,321
Unh! Come on.

1135
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:39,961
Come on.

1136
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,445
Stay right here.

1137
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,481
<i>Quiet!</i>

1138
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,047
Quiet!

1139
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,928
I hear some people. Come on!

1140
