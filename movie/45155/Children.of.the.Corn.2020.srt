1
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,017
来吧，红
Come on, Red. Giddyup.

2
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:04,019
快起来，来吧。骑他们吧，牛仔。
Giddyup, come on. Ride 'em, cowboy.

3
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,761
我们去抓那些亡命之徒。
Let's get those outlaws.

4
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,110
快到了。来吧!
We're almost there. Come on!

5
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,026
明白了。我们知道了。快到了。
Got it. We got it. We're almost there.

6
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:12,681
来吧。
Come on.

7
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:27,087
嘿,博伊德。
Hey, Boyd.

8
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,046
你在玉米地里待了多久?
How long were you out in the corn?

9
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:34,137
我希望不是又一整晚。
Not all night again, I hope.

10
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,768
我不想让你再哭了，伊登。
I don't want you to cry anymore, Eden.

11
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,610
别担心，伊登。
Don't worry, Eden.

12
00:02:13,611 --> 00:02:16,048
在玉米地里什么都不会死。
Nothing ever really dies in the corn.

13
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,757
博伊德!该死的。你到底去哪儿了?
Boyd! Damn it. Where the hell you been?

14
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:38,419
博伊德……博伊德,不!
Boyd... Boyd, no!

15
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:51,996
各单位注意，瑞尔斯通儿童之家发生人质劫持事件。
All units be advised, there is a hostage situation at the Rylstone Children's Home.

16
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:57,741
当地治安官和他的农民朋友们使用了一种动物镇静气体试图解决这个问题。
The local sheriff and his farmer buddies have used some kind of animal sedative gas to try and solve it.

17
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:00,918
从所有报道来看，这听起来像是一场灾难。
By all reports, it sounds like a total disaster.

18
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,616
是的，我现在在这里。
Yeah, I'm here now.

19
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:06,011
这些白痴简直是在往里面灌氟烷想把这孩子弄死。
These idiots are literally pumping halothane in to try to take this kid down.

20
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:58,324
好吧，我的连任失败了。
Well, there goes my reelection.

21
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,762
唯一的一线希望就是那个该死的太空学员。
The only silver lining is that goddamn space cadet in there.

22
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:08,856
那个小矮子在玉米地里游荡了四天才有人意识到她不是毒气的受害者之一。
That little runt was wandering around the corn for four days before anybody realized she wasn't one of the casualties from the goddamn gas.

23
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:15,037
牧师，看看那孩子有没有说过什么能解释他为什么突然发作，杀了那么多人。
Pastor, try and find out if that boy said anything that would explain why he snapped and killed all those people.

24
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:26,614
所以…
So...

25
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:37,538
我猜这就是说，经历了这一切之后，你需要一个住的地方，对吧?
I guess it follows that, uh, you'll need a place to live after all this, huh?

26
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,193
谁知道呢?
Who knows?

27
00:04:42,194 --> 00:04:49,506
如果你是个好女孩，也许我们可以让你来和我住在一起。
If you're a good girl, then maybe we could manage it for you to come and live with me.

28
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:54,510
我有个马厩，里面有几匹老马。
I have a stable with a couple of old nags in it.

29
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:57,339
你可以挑一辆骑上去。
You can pick one out and ride it.

30
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,210
听起来怎么样?
How's that sound?

31
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,822
该死的!
God dang it!

32
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:04,173
这件衣服快把我逼疯了!
This one piece is driving me nuts!

33
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,747
哦。
Oh.

34
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,668
她来了。红方王后。
There she is. The Red Queen.

35
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,323
你喜欢红方王后吗?
You like the Red Queen?

36
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,718
红皇后让世界变成她想要的样子。
The Red Queen makes the world the way she wants it to be.

37
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:34,245
E-Eden,我……我真的很抱歉发生在家里的那些小朋友身上的事。
E-Eden, I'm... I'm really sorry about what happened to all your little friends in the home.

38
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,378
真的。
I really am.

39
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,947
这是个不幸的意外。
It was an unfortunate accident.

40
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:47,869
我得问你…那个男孩，他说什么了吗?
I-I have to ask you... That boy, did he say anything?

41
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,308
不。不是真的。
No. Not really.

42
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:58,880
除了说他很抱歉。
Oh, uh, except just to say he was sorry.

43
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,013
抱歉?
Sorry?

44
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:06,277
抱歉杀了监狱里的所有成年人?
Sorry for killing every adult in the facility?

45
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,931
不。
No.

46
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:10,805
我觉得他很抱歉没把你们都杀了。
I think he was sorry for not killing all of you.

47
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,919
嘿!回来!
Hey! Get back!

48
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,181
嘿，你怎么了?!
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

49
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:41,488
这应该是公开的!
That should be public!

50
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,001
酷。
Cool.

51
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,182
看看这些东西。
Look at this stuff.

52
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:30,492
我警告过他们多少次了?
How many times did I try and warn them?

53
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:36,280
他们都没看一眼标签就把这些东西埋在地里。
The stuff that they put into this ground without even barely reading a label.

54
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:42,286
有没有注意到“玉米”和“迷宫”这两个词…就像玉米和拼图……是一样的吗?
Ever notice how the words "maize" and "maze"... Like a corn maize and a puzzle... are the same?

55
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:45,115
玉米迷宫。
A maze of maize.

56
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,160
奇怪,是吧?
Weird, huh?

57
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,075
当然。“惊人的”。
Sure. "Amazing."

58
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,860
Har-dee-har。咬我。
Har-dee-har. Bite me.

59
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:53,123
嘿!
Hey!

60
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:56,518
毒素在腐烂作物的茎叶上生长。
Toxins grow on the stalks and leaves of rotting crops.

61
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,346
这是一种真菌。
It's a fungus.

62
00:07:58,347 --> 00:08:02,612
它会让你生病甚至死亡。
It can make you sick or even die.

63
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,181
是的。
Yeah.

64
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:09,618
还有幻觉。
And, uh, hallucinations.

65
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,795
-随你怎么说，波。——什么?这是真的。
- Whatever you say, Bo. - What? It's true.

66
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:16,538
有人说它是塞勒姆女巫审判的罪魁祸首。
You know, some people say it was responsible for the Salem witch trials.

67
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:18,062
我也很高兴和你聊天，姐姐。
Fun talking to you too, sis.

68
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,501
啊!
Ahh!

69
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:27,027
嗯!闻闻那些毒素。天鹅绒般柔软可口。
Mmm! Smell those toxins. Velvety and delicious.

70
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:28,550
-太好了。-茜茜，别说了。
- So good. - Ceece, stop.

71
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,030
我想再来一份。
Think I'll have a second helping.

72
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,988
别说了。别玩那些东西了，好吗?
Cut it out. Stop playing with that stuff, okay?

73
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:38,908
现在，听我说。我…这不是我带你来的原因，好吗?
Now, listen to me. I... That's not why I brought you out here, okay?

74
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,345
这是。
This is.

75
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:47,831
我已经一个月没睡了，因为我…
I literally haven't been able to sleep for a month because I...

76
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,054
在这里。
Here.

77
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:04,020
我下周离开。
I leave next week.

78
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:08,982
听着，这是微生物学的本科学位。
Look, it's an undergraduate degree in microbiology.

79
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,811
好吧?这不是永恒。
All right? It's not an eternity.

80
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,596
它是。
It is.

81
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:18,034
它是!你为什么要回来?
It is! Why would you ever come back?

82
00:09:18,035 --> 00:09:20,167
我知道你讨厌这里。
I know you hate it here.

83
00:09:20,168 --> 00:09:22,039
因为。
Because.

84
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:27,261
因为你。因为爸爸。
Because of you. Because of Dad.

85
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:33,789
听着，希希，你知道，总有一天你也会离开这里。
And look, Ceece, you know, you'll leave here one day too.

86
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,923
因为我糟糕的成绩?
With my cruddy grades?

87
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:39,056
我将永远被困在这里。
I'll be stuck here forever.

88
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:43,277
在这个恐怖垂死的地方。
In this creepy, dying place.

89
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,585
不。瑞尔斯通不会死的。
No. Rylstone's not dying.

90
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,762
这几年过得很艰难。你知道吗?
It's been a hard couple years. You know?

91
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,285
我们犯了很多错误。
A lot of mistakes have been made.

92
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,157
做了很多糟糕透顶的决定。
A lot of shitty, shitty decisions.

93
00:09:54,158 --> 00:10:03,777
但与…花点时间和心思，然后这一切…这是可以解决的。
But with... with a little time and care, then all this... it can be fixed.

94
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:06,910
是的。
Yeah.

95
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,784
听起来不错，波。
Sounds awesome, Bo.

96
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,572
Eden!天啊，你吓死我们了。
Eden! God, you scared the shit out of us.

97
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:19,053
认真对待。
Seriously.

98
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,010
假发是怎么回事?
What's with the wig?

99
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:26,713
今天我是红方王后。
Today I am the Red Queen.

100
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,934
Crud。
Crud.

101
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,284
说到这个我们走吧
Um, speaking of which let's go.

102
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,939
加油，红魔!快起来，来吧。
Come on, Red! Giddyup, come on.

103
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,856
塞西尔，你不会想错过这个的。
Cecil, you're not gonna want to miss this.

104
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,042
沃利·托马斯·普拉特!
Wally Thomas Pratt!

105
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:48,707
“因为残忍和不寻常地对待你自己的猎犬，你被判处死刑!”
"For the crime of cruel and unusual treatment of your very own hunting dog, you are hereby sentenced to die!"

106
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,491
你杀了吉伯!
You killed Gibber!

107
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:53,450
嘿!我知道这只是玩玩，但那不是我的错。
Hey! I know this is for play and all, but that wasn't my fault.

108
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,191
我没有给吉伯下毒药。
I didn't give Gibber that poison.

109
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,802
他从捕鼠器里吃的。
He ate it out of some rat trap.

110
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:59,195
而你却眼睁睁看着他受苦!
And you just watched him suffer!

111
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:00,806
他只是一只老猎狗。
He was just an old hound dog.

112
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,547
骗子!比利巴!
Liar! Billy Barnes!

113
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:05,332
狗的杀手!
Dog killer!

114
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,637
嘿,沃利。
Hey, Wally.

115
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:08,291
去你的，巴恩斯。
Screw you, Barnes.

116
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:09,553
滚下去，沃利!
Off the edge, Wally!

117

来吧!
Come on!

128
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,755
嘿!你到底在干什么?
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

129
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,365
嘿,考尔德。
Hey, Calder.

130
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,802
你在我奶奶的车上做什么?
What in frick's name are you doing on my grandma's car?

131
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,065
凸轮吗?
Cam?

132
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:45,938
下车。滚远点。
Get off. Get the hell off.

133
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,854
你疯了吗?
Are you effing crazy?

134
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,507
你们这些蠢蛋。
You dumb-ass idiots.

135
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,161
你把四分之一的嵌板弄凹了。
You've dented the quarter panels.

136
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:55,164
你把窗户打碎了。
You cracked the window.

137
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:56,297
该死的。
Damn.

138
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,299
你甚至把油箱都弄坏了。
You've even busted the gas tank.

139
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,518
等等，考尔德，这是你的车?
Wait, Calder, this is your car?

140
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,260
是的。我的奶奶的。66岁的。
Yeah. My grandma's. '66 Olds.

141
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:06,915
那为什么要停在这荒郊野外?
So why is it parked out here in the middle of nowhere?

142
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:08,787
管好你的事怎么样，derp?
How about mind your business, derp?

143
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,921
我想把我奶奶的车停在我爸的地里，我会的，好吗?
I want to park my grandma's car in my dad's field, I will, okay?

144
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,620
你到底在外面干什么?
What the hell are you doing out here anyway?

145
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,232
我们要处决沃利·普拉特。
We're executing Wally Pratt.

146
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:22,191
他让吉伯痛苦而漫长地死去。
He let Gibber die a long and painful death.

147
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,673
胡扯?不可能。我爱吉伯。
Gibber? No way. I loved Gibber.

148
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,022
螺丝。
Screw that.

149
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,198
和他的混蛋在一起。
Off the edge with his punk ass.

150
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:31,331
是啊!现在，别再拖延了!
Yeah! Now, quit stalling!

151
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:33,202
从边缘掉下来!
Off the edge!

152
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:35,074
——是的!-从边缘掉下来!
- Yeah! - Off the edge!

153
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,467
跳!
Jump!

154
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:38,643
该死，比利!
Dang it, Billy!

155
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:45,999
阿奇，准备在他落地时点燃玉米。
Archie, get ready to light up that corn when he lands in it.

156
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:50,263
哇!等待。你不能这么做。
Whoa! Wait. You can't do that.

157
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:53,092
那辆车在漏油，空气中弥漫着谷物粉尘?
With that car leaking gas and the grain dust in the air?

158
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:55,007
那东西就像火药，知道吗?
That stuff is like gunpowder, okay?

159
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:59,012
什么都不剩了，包括你。
There won't be anything left, including you.

160
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,277
是的。博林是对的。把他推开。
Yeah. Boleyn's right. Just shove him off.

161
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:06,279
我们假装把他烧死!
We'll pretend the part where we burn him to death!

162
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,802
是啊!
Yeah!

163
00:14:07,803 --> 00:14:11,284
死亡!死亡!死亡!
Death! Death! Death!

164
00:14:11,285 --> 00:14:13,199
从边缘掉下来!
Off the edge!

165
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,765
-把他推下去!-从边缘掉下来!
- Push him off! - Off the edge!

166
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,942
-我不干了。-从边缘掉下来!
- I'm out. - Off the edge!

167
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,814
-从边缘掉下来!-从边缘掉下来!
- Off the edge! - Off the edge!

168
00:14:19,815 --> 00:14:20,946
走跳板!
Walk the plank!

169
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,164
哇!
Whoo!

170
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,384
从边缘掉下来!走跳板!
Off the edge! Walk the plank!

171
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,038
-你在开玩笑吧?-从边缘掉下来!
- You're kidding, right? - Off the edge!

172
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,867
-你开玩笑吧?——什么?他们也是我的朋友。
- You're kidding? - What? They're my friends too.

173
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,174
下周你走后，可能是我唯一的朋友。
And after you leave next week, probably my only friends.

174
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:34,394
走跳板!走跳板!
Walk the plank! Walk the plank!

175
00:14:34,395 --> 00:14:42,395
走跳板!走跳板!
Walk the plank! Walk the plank!

176
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,715
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo !
Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo!

177
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:59,202
哇!
Whoo!

178
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,905
死亡!死亡!
Death! Death!

179
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,057
嘿。
Hey.

180
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:31,669
菠，自从我们上次玩海盗之后，发生了很多变化。
A lot's changed since the last time we played pirates, Bo.

181
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,368
你没事吧?
You okay?

182
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:38,241
是的,是的。我只是…
Yeah, yeah. I'm just...

183
00:15:45,205 --> 00:15:50,513
听着，我觉得小家伙们吸入了太多腐烂的玉米真菌。
Look, I think the little ones have just been breathing in too much rotting corn fungus.

184
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,516
在这里也不难。
Wouldn't be hard around here.

185
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:57,259
你想解释一下那辆车吗?
So do you want to explain the car?

186
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,219
天啊，菠，非要我给你解释清楚吗?
Jeez, Bo, do I really have to spell it out for you?

187
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,311
我是说，如果是w-e-e-d就不是了。
I mean, not if it's spelled w-e-e-d.

188
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,313
玉米都快死了。
Corn's all dying.

189
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,794
还不如用这些地种点什么。
Might as well use these fields to grow something.

190
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,363
我上周满18岁了，菠。
I turned 18 last week, Bo.

191
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,017
我和你一样在建造一座桥。
I'm building a bridge just like you.

192
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,410
我要离开这里。
I'm getting out of here.

193
00:16:17,411 --> 00:16:19,716
是的。
Yeah.

194
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:24,287
但你要逃的不只是莱尔斯通的死玉米，对吧?
Except it's not just Rylstone's dying corn you're escaping, is it?

195
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,335
别胡扯了。
Come off it.

196
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,644
这是个意外。
It was an accident.

197
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:41,826
卡尔，你不是…当我笨手笨脚地把他的拳头插在弟弟和他之间时，我的脸撞到了他的拳头。
Cal, you're not... My face hit his fist when I inserted it stupidly between my little brother and him.

198
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,829
事故。
Accident.

199
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:47,919
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

200
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:50,573
不要。
Don't be.

201
00:16:50,574 --> 00:16:53,924
为那些没有出路的人感到遗憾。
Be sorry for the ones who don't have a way out.

202
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:58,451
听着，说到出去…上个周末上学前。
Look, speaking of getting out... Last weekend before school.

203
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:01,019
你和其他人一起去河边了吗?
You headed to the river with everyone else?

204
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,542
不。
No.

205
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,936
我得留下来，照看我的投资。
I got to hang back, look after my investments.

206
00:17:05,937 --> 00:17:10,202
看来你和我最后一次可以独享瑞尔斯通了。
Guess you and I will be having Rylstone all to ourselves one last time.

207
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:13,335
只有我们和小家伙们。
Just us and the little ones.

208
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,164
不要忘记那些小事。
Don't forget the little ones.

209
00:17:18,385 --> 00:17:19,690
再见。
See you.

210
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,041
再见。
See you.

211
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,926
-走跳板!——上帝!
- Walk the plank! - God!

212
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:09,973
耶稣,什么…塞勒姆女巫审判已经结束了吗?
Jesus, what... So are the Salem witch trials over already?

213
00:19:09,974 --> 00:19:12,672
非常甜蜜。沃利吓坏了。
It was pretty sweet. Wally was freaking out.

214
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:17,503
每个人都在尖叫，大喊大叫，在玉米地里跳舞。
Everybody was screaming and yelling and shouting and dancing through the corn.

215
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,200
真是太棒了。
It was pretty dope.

216
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,116
妈妈?
Mom?

217
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,946
Ceece。我们走吧。来吧。
Ceece. Let's go. Come on.

218
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,736
希希，这是爸爸妈妈之间的事。
Ceece, that's between Mom and Dad.

219
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,739
好吧?Ceece。来吧。
Okay? Ceece. Come on.

220
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,351
波，你太瞎了。
Bo, you are so blind.

221
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,700
这和妈妈无关。
It's not about Mom.

222
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,182
这和爸爸无关。
It's not about Dad.

223
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,880
是关于瑞尔斯通的。
It's about Rylstone.

224
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:54,104
而是关于这个地方已经支离破碎了甚至没有人愿意去修复它。
It's about this place that's so broken that nobody even gives a damn enough to try to fix it.

225
00:19:54,105 --> 00:19:57,631
不过，我想这就不是你的问题了，对吧，菠?
But, then, I guess that's not your problem anymore, is it, Bo?

226
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,895
享受波士顿。
Enjoy Boston.

227
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:23,395
玉米……我们的玉米…正在消亡。
Corn... our corn... is dying.

228
00:20:23,396 --> 00:20:24,961
-是的。-是的。
- Yeah. - Yeah.

229
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:32,099
在离这里不到500码的田野里，放眼望去，是一片垂死的棕色海洋。
In the fields not 500 yards from here, as far as the eye can see, is a sea of dying brown.

230
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,366
那些伴随我们长大的，祖先种在这里的金色谷物去哪了?
What happened to the glorious golden grain that we grew up with, that our forefathers planted here?

231
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,976
我们知道发生了什么。
Well, we know what happened.

232
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:44,720
我们投票了，大多数人……你知道，我不同意……统治。
We voted, and a majority... A majority you know I disagreed with... ruled.

233
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:52,424
所以我们邀请了大玉米公司GrowSynth，带着他们的除草剂和转基因作物进入我们的田地。
So we invited Big Corn, GrowSynth, right into our fields with their arsenal of herbicides and GMOs.

234
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:54,426
看看玉米发生了什么。
And look what happened to the corn.

235
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:55,645
我都不知道。
Just didn't even know.

236
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:58,604
我的玉米就是这样。
That's what happened to my corn.

237
00:20:58,605 --> 00:21:01,216
-没错。-事情就是这样。
- That's right. - That's what happened.

238
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:09,136
指责是没有意义的，因为木已成舟。
There's no sense pointing fingers because what's done is done.

239
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:12,487
但这意味着我们必须面对一个新的现实。
But what that means is we have to face a new reality.

240
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:20,322
也许，只是也许，所有的手指都指向了错误的方向。
Or maybe, just maybe, all those fingers are pointing the wrong way anyhow.

241
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:37,208
我们的玉米遭受的枯萎病，也许与GrowSynth或我们放入土壤中的任何转基因生物关系不大，更多的是与我们自己有关，与你们有关。
That blight that struck our corn, maybe it's got a lot less to do with GrowSynth or any GMOs we put in our soil and more to do with us, more to do with you.

242
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,472
坐吧，老头。
Sit down, old man.

243
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:55,225
也许在我们的玉米地里发生的事情与其说是一场农业灾难不如说是一种道德和精神上的憎恶吞没了这个小镇!
Maybe what's happening out there in our corn is less about an agricultural calamity and more about a moral and spiritual abomination that has engulfed this town!

244
00:21:55,226 --> 00:22:01,928
好吧，既然我们听够了那些道貌不扬的，神圣的滚马废话。
Okay, now that we're done listening to that sanctimonious, Holy Rolling horse crap.

245
00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,410
这与你的欺骗和背后的中伤无关。
It isn't about any of the cheating or the backstabbing that's been going on.

246
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,977
它只关乎一件事。
It's about one thing and one thing only.

247
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,023
现在，我们被卖了一大堆豆子。
Now, we was sold a hill of beans.

248
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,111
-没错。——是的!
- That's right. - Yeah!

249
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:18,292
他们说，我们所要做的就是把这个，把那个放进土壤里，改变我们的玉米，这样我们就可以卖更多的苏打水给第三世界的穷孩子。
All we had to do, they said, was put this put that in the soil and alter our corn so we could sell more soda to the poor kids in the Third World.

250
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,338
他们说，这样做，我们就发财了。
Do that, they said, and we'd be rich.

251
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,340
比我们想象的还要富有。
Richer than we could dream.

252
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,429
但相反，看看发生了什么。
But instead, look at what happened.

253
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,735
玉米病和经济灾难。
Sick corn and economic disaster.

254
00:22:26,736 --> 00:22:29,999
这就是瑞尔斯通必须留下玉米的原因。
And that's why Rylstone has to leave corn behind.

255
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,784
这就是我们能做的。
This is how we can do it.

256
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,176
补贴。
Subsidies.

257
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,700
补贴吗?
Subsidies?

258
00:22:34,701 --> 00:22:39,269
联邦政府将补贴……付给我们……不是种玉米。
Federal government will subsidize... pay us... Not to grow corn.

259
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,014
但这个项目的财政年度还有不到两天就结束了，所以我们必须答应，而且必须现在就做。
But this program's fiscal year ends in less than two days, so we got to say yes and we got to do it now.

260
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:52,326
我们的推土机就在镇边上准备挖沟埋我们的玉米。
We got earthmovers right at the edge of town ready to dig the trench to bury our corn.

261
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,676
我和你一样不想这样。
And I don't want this any more than you do.

262
00:22:54,677 --> 00:23:02,380
听着，这并不理想，我承认，但我觉得我们别无选择。
And look, it's not ideal, I admit that, but I don't think we have a choice.

263
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,079
好吧，我不同意，爸爸。
Yeah, well, I disagree, Dad.

264
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:10,910
你们都应该感到羞愧。
You all should be ashamed.

265
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:17,873
当我们需要你们做成年人的时候，你们没有做成年人，而是帮助了你们自己，给我们留下了创伤。
Instead of being the adults when we needed you to be, you helped yourselves and left the rest of us traumatized.

266
00:23:17,874 --> 00:23:20,441
瑞尔斯通已经出卖过灵魂了。
Rylstone sold its soul once already.

267
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:27,187
你所做的一切都是为了解决问题，而不是试图修复土壤，是内斗。
And all you're doing to solve the problem, instead of trying to repair the soil, is infighting.

268
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:35,500
内斗，再一次以最快的速度出卖我们的灵魂，只是卖给了另一个主人。
Infighting and selling all our souls all over again as fast as you can, just to a different master.

269
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,894
但你有选择。
But you do have a choice.

270
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:42,159
相信我，这不是你要做的事。
Trust me, it's not the one you're making.

271
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,687
我美丽的女儿，波。
My beautiful daughter, Bo.

272
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:50,732
谢谢你！
Thank you.

273
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,300
一如既往的衷心和热情。
Most heartfelt and passionate, as always.

274
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:56,477
我希望我能和你一样乐观。
And I wish I shared your optimism.

275
00:23:56,478 --> 00:24:00,568
但试图恢复土壤可能需要数年时间。
But trying to restore the soil could take years.

276
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,831
我们没时间了。
We're simply out of time.

277
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:09,752
如果你想修复这一切，这破碎的东西…你记住我的话，只会让事情变得更糟。
If you try to fix this, something this broken... you mark my words, you're just going to make it worse.

278
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,147
那我们来投票吧。
So let's put it to a vote.

279
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:19,369
不，罗伯特，我真的必须……请坐，牧师。没人在乎。
No, Robert, I-I really must... Sit down, Pastor. No one cares.

280
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,634
我同意。让那些脱粒机滚吧。
I say aye. Let those threshers roll.

281
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:24,636
放开那些大男孩!
Let them big boys go!

282
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:27,769
是的。佛罗里达分时，我来了。
Yeah. Florida time-share, here I come.

283
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,815
玉米经济见鬼去吧。
Corn economy can kiss my ass.

284
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:30,946
——是的!——是的!
- Yeah! - Yeah!

285
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:32,688
看到举手了吗?
See a show of hands?

286
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,869
好吧。我们正在做这件事。每个人的投票。
All right. We're doing this. Everyone's voted.

287
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,872
只是大家都还没投票。
Except everyone hasn't voted.

288
00:24:46,963 --> 00:24:49,051
不是我们。
Not us.

289
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:51,445
孩子们。
The children.

290
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:53,273
他们是对的。
They're right.

291
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:55,623
这也是孩子们的未来。
It's the little ones' futures too.

292
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:58,321
是啊，他们连投票权都没有。
Yeah, they don't even get a vote, a say.

293
00:24:58,322 --> 00:25:00,976
因为波是对的。我们有一个选择。
'Cause Bo is right. We have a choice.

294
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,805
好了，废话够多了。
All right, enough horseshit.

295
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:06,722
孩子吗?有发言权?
Children? Having a say?

296
00:25:08,115 --> 00:25:11,552
我以为17岁的孩子顶嘴已经够糟了。
I thought 17-year-olds mouthing off was bad enough.

297
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,555
愚蠢的孩子。
Stupid kids.

298
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,949
听的,听。
Hear, hear.

299
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:19,561
小孩子!
Little kids!

300
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:22,259
投票!
Voting!

301
00:25:25,393 --> 00:25:27,873
好吧，我建议你回家玩你的玩具。
Yeah, well, I vote you go home and play with your toys.

302
00:25:27,874 --> 00:25:29,527
好吗，小姑娘?
Okay, little girl?

303
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:33,313
听起来怎么样?是吗?
How does that sound? Yeah?

304
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:36,098
你也是，孩子。你就等我回家吧。
You too, boy. You just wait till I get home.

305
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,840
你等着吧，孩子。
You just wait, boy.

306
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,452
嘿，来吧!嘿!嘿!
Hey, come on! Hey! Hey!

307
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,849
看在上帝的份上，那是个孩子。
That's a child, for Christ's sake.

308
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,554
——嘿!-你会没事的。
- Hey! - You're gonna be fine.

309
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,601
好了，别闹了。这就够了。别闹了!
All right, knock it off. That's enough. Knock it off!

310
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,212
你怎么了?
What is wrong with you?

311
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:05,345
好的。这是解决。
Okay. It's settled.

312
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:10,742
不到48小时，瑞尔斯通的玉米就会永远消失。
In less than 48 hours, corn will be dead in Rylstone forever.

313
00:26:10,743 --> 00:26:13,353
是的。谢谢你！
Yes. Thank you.

314
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:15,486
你说的正是我们一直在想的。
You're saying what we've been thinking.

315
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,821
爸爸。
Dad.

316
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:21,437
听着，事情没必要变成这样。
Listen, it doesn't have to be like this.

317
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:25,877
现在做点什么还不晚。
It's not too late to do something.

318
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:28,315
休息一下吧，波。这是完成了。
Give it a rest, Bo. It's done.

319
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,723
你什么时候开始在打架时逃跑了?
Since when do you ever, ever run from a fight?

320
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:50,729
菠，我能区分争取和合作。
I distinguish, Bo, between fighting for and fighting with.

321
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:55,777
你说的是瑞尔斯通还是妈妈?
Are you talking about Rylstone or Mom?

322
00:28:56,386 --> 00:29:01,043
怎么啦？它只是…已经结束了，菠。这是结束了。
What? It's just... It's done, Bo. It's over.

323
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,354
这是完成了。
It's done.

324
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:13,360
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

325
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:22,108
你以前很不一样。
You used to be so different.

326
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,519
我受够你了!
I have had enough of you!

327
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,871
你得离开这房子!
You need to get out of this house!

328
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,699
滚出这房子!
Get out of this house!

329
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,191
的成年人。
The adults.

330
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:05,238
我知道。
I know.

331
00:30:06,326 --> 00:30:08,544
它糟透了。
It sucks.

332
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:11,244
有时候真的很难呼吸。
It's so hard sometimes you can hardly breathe.

333
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:16,814
但我可以帮忙。
But I can help.

334
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,599
用你的痛苦。
With your pain.

335
00:30:28,914 --> 00:31:06,994
♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我♬他爱我他不爱我
♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not ♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not ♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not ♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not ♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not ♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not

336
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:13,436
♬他爱我♬他不爱我
♪ He loves me ♪ He loves me not

337
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:48,906
我父亲认为如果我们试图解决这个问题，只会让事情变得更糟。
My father thinks if we try to fix this, it'll only make things worse.

338
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,909
但他错了。我们可以解决这个问题。
But he's wrong. We can fix this.

339
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,695
这就是…公开的羞辱。
And this is how... Public humiliation.

340
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:57,436
好吗?
Okay?

341
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:05,226
我们用图像向世界展示他们对瑞尔斯通，对我们，对玉米做了什么。
We graphically show the world what they did to Rylstone, to us, to the corn.

342
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:07,228
希拉•博伊斯。
Sheila Boyce.

343
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:10,101
奥马哈。NowCloud记者。
Omaha. Reporter for NowCloud.

344
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:15,497
我给她发了短信，告诉她我们的情况，也许她可以报道这个故事，她回复了。
I DM'd her and told her about our situation, that maybe she could cover the story, and she responded.

345
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:16,977
——什么?-是的。
- What? - Yeah.

346
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,544
你能听懂吗?
So are you with me?

347
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:20,763
我们要这么做吗?
We doing this?

348
00:32:20,764 --> 00:32:23,202
你要不要?
You in or out?

349
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,249
我们开始吧。
Let's do it.

350
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,771
-是的。-你在开玩笑吗?
- Yeah. - Are you kidding?

351
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,948
我们还在等什么?——好的。
- What are we waiting for? - Okay.

352
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,428
在这里。
Here goes.

353
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:42,002
喂?嗨。
Hello? Hi.

354
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,003
博林威廉姆斯吗?

355
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,918
是的,是的!
Yeah, yes!

356
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,575
博伊斯小姐，非常感谢你接我电话。
Miss Boyce, thank you so much for taking my call.

357
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:02,327
Eden?
Eden?

358
00:33:02,328 --> 00:33:06,157
耶稣,什么…那是什么?
Jesus, what... what is all that?

359
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,636
血。
Blood.

360
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,596
什么血?
What blood?

361
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,207
迪伦爸爸的猪。
From Dylan's pop's hog.

362
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,123
我们把玉米根涂成红色。
We're painting the corn roots red.

363
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,734
就像红方王后。
Like the Red Queen.

364
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:20,433
《爱丽丝梦游仙境》。
"Alice in Wonderland."

365
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:24,654
总得想办法喂玉米。
Got to feed the corn somehow.

366
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:41,366
好吧，你真的想治好玉米吗?
Okay, so you really you want to heal the corn, huh?

367
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:43,585
你想拯救玉米吗?好吧。
You want to save the corn? All right.

368
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,371
作为女王，我需要你的帮助。
As the, uh, queen, I need your help.

369
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:54,074
我需要你和你的朋友们出去，告诉佩妮牧师，告诉你的父母，所有人，所有成年人。
I need you and all your little army of friends to go out, tell Pastor Penny, tell your parents, everyone, all the adults.

370
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:55,989
有点小谎，对吧?
Kind of fib, okay?

371
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:01,125
你告诉他们我父亲要召开紧急会议讨论他们要耕种的玉米。
You tell them that my father is calling an emergency meeting about that corn they're gonna plow under.

372
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:06,260
我要你确保他们今晚十点前到社区大厅。
And I need you to make absolutely sure they're at the community hall by 10:00 p.m. tonight.

373
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:09,481
你觉得你能做到吗?
Think you can do that?

374
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:12,571
是的。好的。我会帮你的，菠。
Yeah. Okay. I'll help you do this, Bo.

375
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:15,400
但为什么是社区大厅呢?
But why the community hall?

376
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:20,100
哦，因为我们要开庭了。
Oh, 'cause we are gonna have us a trial.

377
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:24,017
你知道，没有法院是无法进行审判的。
And you know, you can't have a trial without a courthouse.

378
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:27,368
还有，我们有个从奥马哈来的一流女记者。
Plus, we got this big-time newswoman coming in from Omaha.

379
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:30,502
所以我要你在进来的路上接她，把她也带到社区大厅。
So I need you to meet her on the road in, bring her to the community hall too.

380
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:34,072
不要忘记…晚上10点整。
Don't forget... 10:00 p.m. sharp.

381
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:44,517
待会儿见。
I'll see you later.

382
00:34:46,823 --> 00:34:47,911
来吧。
Come on.

383
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:50,435
你杀人。
You murderer.

384
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:57,268
偷偷溜到你身后，用重物压在你脑壳上一劳永逸地结束这一切。
Sneak up behind you and lay something heavy across your skull and end this once and for all.

385
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:02,099
你是个坏人。你是个很坏的人!
You're a bad man. You're a very bad man!

386
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:06,494
你这么想。说吧，安东尼。
You think that. Go ahead, Anthony.

387
00:35:06,495 --> 00:35:09,933
我是个很坏的人。继续这么想。
I'm a very bad man. Keep thinking that.

388
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,501
谁从他后面悄悄走过去。
Somebody sneak up behind him.

389
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:18,420
趁他还在想我，赶紧结束这一切!
Somebody end this now while he's thinking about me!

390
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:33,522
啊!
Aah!

391
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:47,753
希望它进入玉米地。
Wish it into the cornfield.

392
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:49,929
求你了，儿子，祝它到玉米地里去。
Please, son, wish it into the cornfield, please.

393
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,628
好了，我该睡觉了。
Well, beddy-bye for me.

394
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,327
是的。我击败。
Yeah. I'm beat.

395
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,504
你呢，爸爸?
How about you, Dad?

396
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:02,594
一个还长着丑脸的玩偶。
A jack-in-the-box that still had his bad face.

397
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:06,773
你不能有不好的想法……别熬夜，好吗?
You mustn't think bad thoughts... Don't stay up too late, okay?

398
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:10,777
否则我也会对你做同样的事。
Or I'll do the same thing to you.

399
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,293
我们犯了幼稚的错误吗，茜茜?
Are we making a childish mistake, Ceece?

400
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:53,428
试图改变世界从来都不是错误，菠。
It's never a mistake to try and change the world, Bo.

401
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,638
你们在做什么?
What are you guys doing?

402
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,903
爸爸，你还记得你告诉过我有些事值得为之奋斗吗?
Dad, you know how you told me some things are worth fighting for?

403
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:39,734
我猜你养育我的方式是对的，因为现在就是这样。
Well, I guess you raised me right, because that's what's happening.

404
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:43,042
我们要举行模拟审判，而你是主宾。
We're holding a mock trial, and you're the guest of honor.

405
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,783
别吵醒妈妈。
Don't wake Mom.

406
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:49,571
悄悄地来，我保证很快就会结束的。
Come quietly, and I promise you this will be over soon.

407
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:19,687
你确定吗，菠?
You sure about this, Bo?

408
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:21,864
拜托，考尔德。我们已经迟到了。
Yeah, come on, Calder. We're already late.

409
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,360
大家都去哪儿了?
Where is everyone?

410
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:10,565
不，没关系。相信我。
No, it's okay. Trust me.

411
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,285
你好,Bo。
Hi, Bo.

412
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:37,418
Eden。
Eden.

413
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,466
每个人都在哪儿?记者在哪里?
Where's everybody? Where's the reporter?

414
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,859
希拉•博伊斯。
Sheila Boyce.

415
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,122
谁?
Who?

416
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:51,475
记者。从奥马哈。
The reporter. From Omaha.

417
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:54,782
你应该去接她的。
You were supposed to pick her up.

418
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:56,698
她没有出现。
She never showed.

419
00:39:58,221 --> 00:40:00,789
我猜肯定有更重要的事情发生了。
Guess something more important must have come up.

420
00:40:03,749 --> 00:40:05,794
她……
Did she...

421
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:11,146
已经不重要了，菠。
Doesn't really matter anymore, Bo.

422
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:12,497
这是结束了。
It's over.

423
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:16,935
是什么?在是什么?
What is? What's over?

424
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:18,850
你迟到了。
You were late.

425
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,634
所以我们就这么做了。
So we just went ahead and did it.

426
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,376
你做了什么?
You did what?

427
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:24,944
的审判。
The trial.

428
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:37,738
父母呢?
Where are the parents?

429
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,698
大家都去哪儿了?
Where is everyone?

430
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:42,787
凸轮。
Cam.

431
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:46,748
爸爸在哪儿?
Where's Dad?

432
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:50,273
到底是怎么回事?
What the hell is going on?

433
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:57,803
想看点什么吗，波?
Want to see something, Bo?

434
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,541
我猜他不同意判决结果。
Didn't agree with the verdict, I guess.

435
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:45,241
跟这种人相处总是需要付出更多，菠。
It was always gonna take more with these kind of people, Bo.

436
00:41:46,591 --> 00:41:47,679
还有很多。
A lot more.

437
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:50,986
考尔德!
Calder!

438
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:54,032
爸爸?爸爸!
Dad? Dad!

439
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:56,470
帮帮我!提他!把他举起来!
Help me! Lift him! Lift him up!

440
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,386
提升!提他!
Lift! Lift him!

441
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:04,172
我们走吧。
Let's go.

442
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,218
爸爸!
Dad!

443
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,568
爸爸。
Dad.

444
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:14,444
不!不!不!不!
No! No! No! No!

445
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,199
他现在不笑了。
He's not laughing now.

446
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,996
看看我们!
Check us out!

447
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:33,088
是啊!
Yeah!

448
00:43:40,008 --> 00:43:41,749
来吧!来吧!
Come on! Come on!

449
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,497
这太离谱了!
This is outrageous!

450
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:54,719
我发誓，地狱之火会倾盆而下。
I swear, it's gonna rain down with hellfire.

451
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:59,506
我在跟你说话，伊登。
I'm talking to you, Eden.

452
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:08,470
Eden,亲爱的……现在回头还不晚。
Eden, honey... It's not too late to turn back.

453
00:44:08,471 --> 00:44:11,691
你现在是我女儿了。
You're my daughter now.

454
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,216
你认为你应该这样做吗?
Do you think this is how you should behave?

455
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,610
这该死的!
God damn!

456
00:44:17,611 --> 00:44:19,395
还有问题吗?
Any more questions?

457
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,007
我不这么认为。
I didn't think so.

458
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:26,881
-你没事吧?-是的。
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

459
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:41,199
这太疯狂了。这完全是疯狂的。
This is insanity. This is completely insane.

460
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,505
你看到外面的情况了吗?
Did you see what it was like out there?

461
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:45,420
所有的尸体。
All the dead bodies.

462
00:44:45,421 --> 00:44:46,726
我不知道我父母在哪。
I don't know where my parents are.

463
00:44:46,727 --> 00:44:48,249
我不知道他们怎么了。
I don't know what happened to them.

464
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,208
让我们把这地方翻个底朝天!
Let's tear this place to the ground!

465
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:53,907
我的电话。我的手机坏了。
My phone. My phone doesn't work.

466
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:55,430
我的。
Mine either.

467
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:58,259
这些小怪物会不会对信号塔做了什么?
Could these little freaks have done something to the cell tower?

468
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,044
耶稣。
Jesus.

469
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:02,569
我哥哥现在和他们在一起。
My brother is with them now.

470
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:07,007
把他们撕碎!
Rip 'em up!

471
00:45:07,008 --> 00:45:08,836
薄薄
Bo. Bo.

472
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:11,926
做点什么。
Do something.

473
00:45:13,014 --> 00:45:14,712
如果可以，请帮助我们。
Help us if you can.

474
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:20,151
打击他们!
Hit 'em!

475
00:45:20,152 --> 00:45:25,157
我们必须这么做。我们……我们可以做点什么。
We have to. We... We can do something.

476
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,855
看看这个!
Look at this!

477
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:30,075
是的,Bo。
Yes, Bo.

478
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:34,819
你是对的。我们必须阻止这一切。
You're right. We have to stop this.

479
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,608
——啊!——不!
- Aaaah! - No!

480
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:53,925
我的上帝。
My God.

481
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:09,809
Eden。
Eden.

482
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,118
耶稣基督。你想在这里做什么?
Jesus Christ. What is it you intend to do here?

483
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,383
嗯…
Well...

484
00:46:23,171 --> 00:46:25,739
如果你真的想知道的话。
If you really want to know.

485
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:36,576
我希望你能比蒂米·凯恩，艾娃·福斯特，博伊德·鲍登，或者我其他的不良朋友更能屏住呼吸。
I hope you can hold your breath better than Timmy Cain, Ava Foster, Boyd Bowden, or any of my other delinquent friends.

486
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:43,235
不!
No!

487
00:46:45,977 --> 00:46:47,195
氟烷!
It's halothane!

488
00:46:48,893 --> 00:46:50,458
捂住嘴!
Cover your mouths!

489
00:46:50,459 --> 00:46:53,462
Eden,不!
Eden, no!

490
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,248
Eden!
Eden!

491
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,643
这是给我朋友的。感觉如何?
This is for my friends. How does it feel?

492
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,821
你觉得怎么样?
How do you like it?

493
00:48:01,182 --> 00:48:03,054
你好，格布勒警长。
Heya, Sheriff Gebler.

494
00:48:14,804 --> 00:48:15,936
妈妈?
Mom?

495
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:28,817
看在上帝的份上，你以为你在干什么?
What in God's name do you think you're doing?

496
00:48:28,818 --> 00:48:30,994
做出裁决。
Rendering the verdict.

497
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:33,518
你就等着我抓到你吧。
You just wait till I get my hands on you.

498
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:34,693
你这个小贱人。
You little, bitch.

499
00:48:34,694 --> 00:48:36,913
哦!真的吗?
Oh! Really?

500
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,566
你想惹我吗?
You want to mess with me?

501
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:41,178
是的。好的,很好。是的。让我们玩。
Yeah. Okay, fine. Yeah. Let's play.

502
00:48:41,179 --> 00:48:43,832
史蒂夫!乔!我们走吧!
Steve! Joe! Let's go!

503
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:45,443
Eden。
Eden.

504
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:47,489
-伊登，不要，求你了。-你没必要这么做。
- Eden, no, please. - You don't have to do this.

505
00:48:59,501 --> 00:49:01,503
不!你不能这么做!
No! You can't do this!

506
00:49:03,984 --> 00:49:05,463
Eden。Eden!
Eden. Eden!

507
00:49:05,464 --> 00:49:06,987
让我们出去!
Let us out!

508
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:13,820
停!
Stop!

509
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:20,957
博,不!
Bo, no!

510
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,135
妈妈!
Mom!

511
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,012
不!
No!

512
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:38,105
你在干什么?!
What are you doing?!

513
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,542
不,不!
No, no!

514
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:42,631
停!
Stop!

515
00:49:48,768 --> 00:49:50,769
不，别这么做!
No, don't do it!

516
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,076
停!不!
Stop! No!

517
00:49:53,077 --> 00:49:54,208
不!
No!

518
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:08,005
妈妈!妈妈!
Mom! Mom!

519
00:50:54,877 --> 00:50:56,053
塞西尔。
Cecil.

520
00:51:17,813 --> 00:51:19,337
饲料。
Feed.

521
00:51:31,262 --> 00:51:33,046
妈妈。
Mom.

522
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:38,095
我很抱歉。
I am sorry.

523
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:16,307
我爸爸是对的。
My dad was right.

524
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,487
他警告我，如果我想弥补，只会让事情更糟。
He warned me if I tried to fix this I'd only make it worse.

525
00:52:24,315 --> 00:52:26,534
所以，如果可以的话，就出去吧。
So get out if you can.

526
00:52:27,883 --> 00:52:29,407
拯救自己。
Save yourselves.

527
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:37,675
但是我爸爸还活着。
But my dad is still alive.

528
00:52:37,676 --> 00:52:44,551
所以我要留下来阻止伊登把他也杀了。
So I'm gonna stay and stop Eden from killing him too.

529
00:52:44,552 --> 00:52:46,249
是的。
Yeah.

530
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,989
好的。
Okay.

531
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,514
好的,Bo。
Okay, Bo.

532
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:53,473
去烛台吧。
Well, go to Candlestick.

533
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:55,476
寻求帮助。
And get help.

534
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,319
你好,Bo。
Hi, Bo.

535
00:53:57,321 --> 00:54:00,105
伊登，你不能。
Eden, you can't.

536
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:02,500
你不能这样做。
You cannot do this.

537
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:10,116
他们杀了他们碰过的所有东西。
They kill everything they touch.

538
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:15,425
让他们接受审判是你的主意。
Putting them on trial was your idea.

539
00:54:15,426 --> 00:54:17,341
你以为会发生什么?
What did you think would happen?

540
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:22,171
不是这个。
Not this.

541
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,131
是我们对他们。
It's us against them.

542
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,003
你站在哪一边?
Whose side are you on?

543
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,710
你要拿我父亲和其他人怎么办?
What are you gonna do with my father and the others?

544
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:42,627
我要把他们送到玉米地里去，菠。
I'm gonna send them out to the corn, Bo.

545
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:50,069
他生病了。他需要进食。
He's sick. He needs to feed.

546
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:52,070
他吗?
He?

547
00:54:52,071 --> 00:54:54,769
行走的人。
He Who Walks.

548
00:54:57,946 --> 00:54:59,644
我在那里的那个星期……
That week I was out there...

549
00:55:01,994 --> 00:55:07,694
独自在玉米地里游荡……他跟我说话了。
wandering alone in the corn... he talked to me.

550
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:11,743
他照顾我。
He took care of me.

551
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:19,141
瑞尔斯通没有一个成年人为我这样做过。
No adult in Rylstone ever did that for me.

552
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:24,059
所以现在我要照顾他。
So now I'm going to take care of him.

553
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,718
杀死所有的成年人?
By killing all the adults?

554
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,678
首先。
For starters.

555
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:38,334
波，他们吃了玉米种子。
They ate the seed-corn, Bo.

556
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,337
现在是时候付出代价了。
Now it's time to pay the price.

557
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:46,342
如果我们中有人能离开这里，去烛台，我们就能得到帮助，好吗?
If one of us can just get out of here, make it to Candlestick, we can get help, all right?

558
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,823
看看这个!
Check this out!

559
00:55:49,998 --> 00:55:51,738
这太疯狂了。爸爸，我需要你相信我。
This is insanity. Dad, I need you to trust me.

560
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:55,699
现在，他们想知道我站在哪一边，所以我需要你完全按我说的做。
Right now, they want to know who's side I'm on, so I need you to do exactly what I say.

561
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,267
听着，他们想带你们去玉米地里。
Listen, they want to take you all out into the corn.

562
00:55:59,268 --> 00:56:00,747
——什么?对什么?——走吧!走吧!
- What? What for? - Go! Go!

563
00:56:00,748 --> 00:56:02,707
你会很安全的。你可以寻求帮助。
You'll be safe. You can get help.

564
00:56:10,845 --> 00:56:19,984
如果那个生物想让我们去玉米地里，那我们就应该做完全相反的事!
If that creature wants us to go into the corn, then we should be doing the exact opposite!

565
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:21,725
我不会担心的。
I wouldn't worry about it.

566
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:25,598
反正你也不会去玉米地里。
You were never going into the corn anyway.

567
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,426
因为你挺身而出
Because you stood up for it.

568
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:29,820
是的。没错，伊登。
Yes. That's right, Eden.

569
00:56:29,821 --> 00:56:32,431
玉米的死跟我一点关系都没有。
I never had a thing to do with killing the corn.

570
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:36,130
事实上，我强烈反对!
In fact, I-I spoke out strongly against it!

571
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:39,699
伊登，还记得在寄养家庭发生的事吗?
Eden, remember that thing that happened in the foster home?

572
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:43,617
哦。谁收留了你?
Ohh. Who took you in, hmm?

573
00:56:46,925 --> 00:56:49,796
是你，牧师。你所做的。
It was you, Pastor. You did.

574
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:52,582
你收留了我。
You took me in.

575
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,934
你从未像其他人那样对谷物犯过罪。
You never sinned against the corn like all the rest.

576
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,727
但是，拜托，牧师。
But, come on, Pastor.

577
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:09,599
你犯了罪。
You did sin.

578
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,992
不是吗?
Didn't you?

579
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:20,174
——够了!-闭嘴。
- Enough! - Shut up.

580
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:22,308
不!
No!

581
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:28,139
不,Eden!不，求你了，不要!
No, Eden! No, please, no!

582
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,532
不，伊登，不!
No, Eden, no!

583
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:33,927
不，不，不，不!
No, no, no, no!

584
00:57:33,928 --> 00:57:36,322
不，伊登，不!
No, Eden, no!

585
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,498
上帝!哦，天哪，不!
God! Oh, God, no!

586
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,630
拜托!
Please!

587
00:57:40,631 --> 00:57:43,024
不,Eden!
No, Eden!

588
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:49,204
不,不!
No, no!

589
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:54,558
天啊，不，不!
God, no, no!

590
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:04,437
哦,Eden…
Oh, Eden...

591
00:58:29,897 --> 00:58:31,507
波，她在哪?
Bo, where is she?

592
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,073
求你了，别问我这个。别问我妈妈的事。
Please, don't ask me that. Don't ask me about Mom.

593
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:34,335
我要知道我妻子在哪里!
I need to know where my wife is!

594
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:35,598
停!
Stop!

595
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:37,469
听着，你得去玉米地里。
Listen, you need to go out to the corn.

596
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,602
就是这样。这是我们寻求帮助的机会。
That's it. This is our chance to get help.

597
00:58:39,603 --> 00:58:41,561
好吧?就是它了。
Okay? This is it.

598
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,000
好的。我去。
Okay. I'll go.

599
00:58:47,088 --> 00:58:49,829
但你会战斗。好吧?
But you fight. All right?

600
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:50,917
是的。
Yes.

601
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:52,398
我爱你。
I love you.

602
00:58:54,748 --> 00:58:56,097
我也爱你。
I love you too.

603
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:06,454
你做得很好。
You did good.

604
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:08,022
他今晚会吃得很饱的。
He'll feed well tonight.

605
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:10,459
放下枪，小卡。
Drop it, Cam.

606
00:59:12,287 --> 00:59:14,420
她不是威胁。
She's not a threat.

607
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:25,604
好的,爸爸。
Okay, Dad.

608
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:27,606
我会的。
I will.

609
00:59:27,607 --> 00:59:29,391
我会战斗。
I will fight.

610
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,634
猜猜还有什么。
And guess what else.

611
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:59,725
从现在起，里尔斯通不许任何人出入!
From now on, no one in Rylstone and no one out!

612
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:03,207
如果有人想在这里停下来，猜猜我们要做什么。
And if anyone cares to stop here, guess what we're gonna do.

613
01:00:03,208 --> 01:00:05,644
带他们!把他们带到玉米地里去!
Take them! Take them into the corn!

614
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:08,168
这是正确的。把它们放到玉米地里。
That's right. Get them into the corn.

615
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:11,607
因为我们不需要他们提供的任何东西!
Because we don't need a single thing they have to offer!

616
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:17,264
我们需要的一切都在这里，就在那片田野里。
Everything we've ever needed is right here, right out there in those fields.

617
01:00:17,265 --> 01:00:21,660
玉米，土地，会照顾它的孩子。
The corn, the earth, will take care of its children.

618
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:27,187
现在这是我们的世界，我们要改变一下，按我们想要的方式经营。
This is our world now, and we're gonna run it the way we want for a change.

619
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:28,580
我们要好好经营!
And we're gonna run it right!

620
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:29,886
没错!
Right!

621
01:00:29,887 --> 01:00:32,540
也不只是瑞尔斯通一个人。
And isn't just gonna be Rylstone either.

622
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:35,108
我们要把消息传遍全国。
We're gonna spread the word all across this country.

623
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:37,415
你以为没有像我们这样的人吗?
You think there aren't others like us?

624
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:41,680
孩子们眼睁睁地看着自己的世界和未来被出卖?
Kids seeing their world and future just being traded away?

625
01:00:41,681 --> 01:00:45,684
他们也会夺回自己的城镇，让整个世界恢复正常!
Well, they're gonna take their towns, too, and make this whole world right again!

626
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:51,952
——对吧!——对吧!
- Right! - Right!

627
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:57,741
比如这个。
Like this thing.

628
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:08,359
它要利用我们，要出卖我们的未来。
It was going to use us, was going to sell our future.

629
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:11,188
所以我们应该把她的头砍下来，对吧，菠?
So we should cut her head off, right, Bo?

630
01:01:11,189 --> 01:01:12,407
不!
No!

631
01:01:16,107 --> 01:01:17,716
我的意思是，是的。
I mean, yes.

632
01:01:17,717 --> 01:01:18,849
是的。
Yes.

633
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:21,720
她犯了罪。
She sinned.

634
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:25,028
她得罪了你。
She sinned against you.

635
01:01:25,029 --> 01:01:27,074
对我们所有人。
Against all of us.

636
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:34,168
所以我们不应该在这里浪费她的血。
And that's why we shouldn't waste her blood here.

637
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:40,218
我可以把她送到玉米地里去。
Not when I can send her into the corn.

638
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:43,351
这是个好主意，菠。
That's a pretty good idea, Bo.

639
01:02:24,392 --> 01:02:26,090
但是,博…
But, Bo...

640
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:35,752
更好的办法是直接带她去见他。
An even better idea would be to take her straight to him.

641
01:02:43,368 --> 01:02:45,065
这里。
This way.

642
01:05:16,825 --> 01:05:18,175
就是这样。
That's it.

643
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,135
带她上去。
Take her up.

644
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,592
门。
Doors.

645
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:57,301
行走的人!
He Who Walks!

646
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:00,347
来了!
Come!

647
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:03,481
到我们这儿来!
Come to us!

648
01:06:35,861 --> 01:06:38,167
Eden。
Eden.

649
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:43,955
那个行走的人，他不存在。
He Who Walks, he doesn't exist.

650
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:46,524
你竟敢这么说!
Don't you dare say that!

651
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:06,979
待回来。
Stay back.

652
01:08:07,866 --> 01:08:09,998
这不可能是真的。
It can't be real.

653
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:40,768
啊!
Aah!

654
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:54,913
帮帮我!
Help me!

655
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:01,615
你伤不了我的，菠。
You can't hurt me, Bo.

656
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,820
天啊，你们这些白痴!你们这些该死的小白痴!
God, you idiots! You're goddamn little idiots!

657
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:35,345
振作起来。
Brace yourself.

658
01:09:35,997 --> 01:09:39,131
你是…你疯了吗?!
Are you... Are you crazy?!

659
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:43,482
粮食粉尘。
Grain dust.

660
01:09:43,483 --> 01:09:44,788
还记得吗?
Remember?

661
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:47,269
这地方到处都是。
This place is full of it.

662
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:51,621
你一点火，这地方就会被炸飞。
You light a fire, this whole place will blow sky high.

663
01:09:51,622 --> 01:09:58,629
玉米和里面的东西都会烧起来。
The corn and everything in it will burn.

664
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:09,901
很好。
Fine.

665
01:10:12,773 --> 01:10:14,340
我们把她剁了吧。
Let's chop her up.

666
01:10:18,692 --> 01:10:20,607
继续。得到她。
Go on. Get her.

667
01:10:40,975 --> 01:10:43,020
来吧!
Come on!

668
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:44,543
我们走吧!
Let's go!

669
01:10:44,544 --> 01:10:46,416
到玉米地里去!
Into the corn!

670
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:54,293
来吧!
Come on!

671
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,999
来吧!
Come on!

672
01:11:52,003 --> 01:11:53,482
爸爸。
Dad.

673
01:11:53,483 --> 01:11:55,398
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.

674
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:25,341
帮助我。
Help me.

675
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:18,165
车!是的!
Car! Yes!

676
01:15:24,258 --> 01:15:25,869
钥匙，钥匙，钥匙。
Keys, keys, keys.

677
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:02,922
去他妈的。
Fuck that shit.

678
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:16,414
不。不。
No. No.

679
01:17:25,466 --> 01:17:27,338
不，不，不。
No, no, no, no.

680
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:40,003
哦，谢谢。哦，谢天谢地。
Oh, thank you. Oh, thank God.

681
01:17:42,875 --> 01:17:44,442
你好,Bo。
Hi, Bo.

682
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:48,664
Eden。
Eden.

683
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:52,929
Eden,Eden。
Eden, Eden.

684
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:55,496
耶稣。
Jesus.

685
01:17:58,021 --> 01:18:04,461
这……这太疯狂了。
T-This... This is madness.

686
01:18:04,462 --> 01:18:07,291
疯狂,疯狂。
Craziness, insanity.

687
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,948
你知道吗?
You know?

688
01:18:13,993 --> 01:18:16,952
是的。这太疯狂了。
Yeah. It's pretty crazy.

689
01:18:16,953 --> 01:18:18,345
我会告诉你的。
I'll give you that.

690
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,449
那是什么，伊登?
What is that, Eden?

691
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,065
哦。
Oh.

692
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:44,589
这一点。
This.

693
01:18:46,591 --> 01:18:48,201
肯定的，菠。
Depositive bolt, Bo.

694
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:51,248
你知道，牛枪。
You know, a cattle gun.

695
01:18:53,337 --> 01:18:55,078
我知道你在想什么。
I know what you're thinking.

696
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,342
算了吧。
Forget it.

697
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:01,780
你知道这里不止我一个人。
You know I'm not the only one out here.

698
01:19:21,931 --> 01:19:23,933
已经过了我的就寝时间。
It's past my bedtime.

699
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:26,762
我们走吧。
Let's go.

700
01:19:29,025 --> 01:19:31,070
至少最后一根烟?
A l-last cigarette at least?

701
01:19:32,985 --> 01:19:34,247
你抽烟吗?
You smoke?

702
01:19:38,295 --> 01:19:44,518
坏习惯。我…正要辞职。
Bad habit. I... was about to quit.

703
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:39,660
来吧。
Come on.

704
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:54,850
跪下来。
Get down on your knees.

705
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:18,699
别害怕，菠。
Don't be scared, Bo.

706
01:21:20,788 --> 01:21:22,573
嘿,Eden?
Hey, Eden?

707
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:36,935
你真的以为你把我浸在拖拉机燃料里的那一刻，我就不会确定我的结果是正确的…
You really think the second you soaked me in all that tractor fuel, that I wasn't gonna make sure I ended up right...

708
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,681
在这里吗?
here?

709
01:21:51,297 --> 01:21:52,864
燃烧。
Burn.

710
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,382
不。
No.

711
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,446
不，不，不!
No, no, no!

712
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:25,000
烛台和方圆几英里内的其他人很快就会到这里。
Candlestick and everyone else for miles around will be here soon.

713
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:29,351
面对它。
Face it.

714
01:23:29,352 --> 01:23:31,615
结束了。
It's done.

715
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:54,203
你的幻想结束了，伊登。
Your fantasy's finished, Eden.

716
01:24:37,289 --> 01:24:38,595
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

717
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:46,646
Eden。
Eden.

718
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:42,632
别担心，波。
Don't worry, Bo.

719
01:26:44,111 --> 01:26:46,505
在玉米地里什么都不会死。
Nothing ever really dies in the corn.
