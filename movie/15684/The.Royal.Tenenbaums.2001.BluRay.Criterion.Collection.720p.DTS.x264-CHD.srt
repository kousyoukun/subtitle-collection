太晚了  别管他了
It's too late. You forgot him.

282
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,090
巴克利  巴克利
Buckley! Buckley!

283
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,590
别坐电梯  火灾不能坐电梯
No elevator! There's a fire.

284
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,840
快  快
Go, go!

285
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,180
快逃  快逃
Go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go!

286
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,420
那场空难查斯和两个儿子  
Chas and their two sons, Ari and Uzi

287
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,730
阿里  乌兹幸免遇难
were also on the flight and survived

288
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,580
他们装在笼子里的狗也活了下来
as did their dog who was discovered in his cage

289
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,330
在坠毁现场几千码的地方被发现
several thousand yards from the crash site.

290
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,120
4分48秒
4 minutes, 48 seconds.

291
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,460
真起火的话咱们已经被烧成人干了
We're all dead, burnt to a crisp.

292
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,640
6个月以来
Over the last six months

293
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,520
他愈发担忧孩子们的安全问题
he had become increasingly concerned with their safety.

294
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,220
我们把巴克利忘家里了
We left Buckley.

295
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,480
那不重要
It doesn't matter.

296
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,780
艾瑟琳成为了考古学家
Etheline became an archaeologist

297
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,240
并帮助房屋署和运输管理局
and had overseen excavations

298
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,130
监督他们的挖掘工作
for the Department of Housing and the Transit Authority.

299
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,200
关于这个问题
Apropos of my question

300
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,740
根据I-40和I-9理算文件...
regarding I-40\I-9 adjustments...

301
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,030
每周两次她教人打桥牌  
She taught a bridge class twice a week

302
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,160
学生是她的朋友  亨利・谢尔曼  一名税务经理  
with her friend and business manager, Henry Sherman.

303
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,730
抓住每一分钱  个人理财指导  亨利・谢尔曼著

304
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,320
根据目前情况看来
It would probably be advantageous

305
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,570
办理正式离婚
for your marital status to be legally established as single

306
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,430
对你较为有利
in light of the circumstances.

307
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
什么意思
What do you mean?

308
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,760
我是说在税务方面
I mean for tax purposes.

309
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,420
但我觉得...
But I thought...

310
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,610
-艾瑟琳  -嗯
- Etheline... - Yes?

311
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,690
嫁给我好吗
Will you marry me?

312
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,970
我  我爱你
I... I love you, uh...

313
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,990
你感觉到了吧
Did you already know that?

314
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,670
没  没有 
No, I didn't.

315
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:05,480
和丈夫分居后
Since her separation from her husband,

316
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,610
她有过很多的追求者
she had had many suitors...

317
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,370
但这还是她第一次动心
...but had not considered a single one until this moment.

318
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,530
这和缴税没什么关系对吧
This isn't really a tax issue, is it?

319
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,410
的确
That's true, uh...

320
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,110
我也不知道我为什么这样说
I don't know why I put it that way.

321
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,410
容我考虑一下  亨利
Let me think about it, Henry.

322
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,560
你好  请告诉先生是帕戈达打来的  
Hello. Please tell Mr. Royal this is the Pagoda.

323
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,380
大厅到了
Lobby.

324
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,760
谢谢  达斯蒂
Thank you, Dusty.

325
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,640
不客气
You're welcome.

326
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,570
早上好  杰瑞
Good morning, Jerry.

327
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,430
有人打电话找您  特伦鲍姆先生
Oh, there's a call for you, Mr. Tenenbaum.

328
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,780
谁啊  弗雷德里克
Who is it, Frederick?

329
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,490
一个叫帕戈达的人
A Mr. Pagoda.

330
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,660
有什么消息
What do you got?

331
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,630
那个黑鬼向她求婚了
The black man asked her to be his wife.

332
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:13,850
开玩笑吧
No shit?

333
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,490
艾瑟琳怎么说
What did Etheline say?

334
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,280
她说考虑一下
She'll think about it.

335
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,270
我一点也不喜欢这个消息  帕戈达
I don't like the sound of this one damn bit, Pagoda.

336
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:30,250
我承认自己虽然也不忠过
I mean... Lord knows I've had my share of infidelities

337
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,400
但她仍然是我老婆啊
but she's still my wife.

338
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,720
那个该死的二流会计师
And no damn two-bit, chartered accountant

339
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,520
休想改变这个事实
is going to change that.

340
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,770
嗨
Hi.

341
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,700
喂  帕戈达  过来搭把手吧
Hey, Pagoda, give us a hand, huh?

342
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,450
查斯
Chas?

343
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,660
出什么事了
What's going on?

344
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:19,110
我们被锁在公寓外面了
We got locked out of our apartment.

345
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,220
没找锁匠开锁吗
Did you call a locksmith?

346
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,850
找了
Uh-huh.

347
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:25,830
我就不明白了
Well, I don't understand.

348
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,010
你们难道是在被锁在屋外前就
Did you pack your bags

349
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,710
把行李打包带好了还是怎么搞的
before you got locked out or how did you?

350
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,700
那里不安全
It's not safe over there.

351
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,540
等我一会儿
Excuse me for a moment.

352
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,920
哪儿不安全了
What are you talking about?

353
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,210
公寓
The apartment.

354
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,770
我得在房子里安装新的火灾喷水装置
I have to get some new sprinklers

355
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,130
和后备安全系统
and a backup security system installed.

356
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:46,170
但这里也没有什么喷水装置啊
But there are no sprinklers here, either.

357
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,580
那就在这也装一个
Well, we might have to do something about that, too.

358
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,230
好吧
Okay.

359
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,440
是不是很好玩
Isn't this fun, huh?

360
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,560
是不是很棒
Isn't this great?

361
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,260
就像露营一样
Feels like we're camping.

362
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,850
我们多久回家
When are we going home?

363
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,720
看看这个
Hey, look at this.

364
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,380
挺酷对吧
Pretty cool, huh?

365
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,730
谁把这玩意放这的
Who put that in here?

366
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,080
好了
Okay.

367
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,510
明早见孩子们
Well, I will see you boys in the morning.

368
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,720
-晚安  -好梦
- Good night. - Good night.

369
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,890
晚安
Good night.

370
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,900
要不  我和你们睡一块儿吧
You know what? I think I'm going to sleep in here with you.

371
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:37,570
这样才能看着你们
That way... we can all be together.

372
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,460
大概都有些什么副作用
What kind of side effects can be expected?

373
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,420
种类很多
Well, there are a number of possibilities.

374
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,420
常见症状有恶心头晕等
Severe nausea and dizziness are standard.

375
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,260
部分病人还会有抽搐的迹象
A certain percentage of patients may also experience seizure.

376
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,180
你是说突然倒地人事不知那种
You mean, like flopping around on the floor and everything?

377
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,060
有些病例是的
In some cases.

378
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,400
有人来看你了  亲爱的
You have a visitor, my darling.

379
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,440
谁啊
Who is it?

380
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:18,990
是我  宝贝
It's me, sweetie.

381
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,620
罗利说你一天6小时都在里面
Raleigh says you've been spending six hours a day

382
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,000
一边泡澡一边看电视
locked in here, watching television and soaking in the tub.

383
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,080
我有这样吗
I doubt that.

384
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,800
这不大健康吧  你说呢
I don't think that's very healthy, do you?

385
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,550
而且在浴缸旁边放一个电器
Nor do I think it's very intelligent

386
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,350
似乎也不大明智吧
to keep an electrical gadget on the edge of the bathtub.

387
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,220
我把它拴在暖气片上了
I tie it to the radiator.

388
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,560
尽管如此这对你的视力也不好
Well, it can't be very good for your eyes, anyway.

389
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,870
查斯回家了
Chas came home.

390
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,280
什么
What do you mean?

391
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,000
他们爷仨要和我住一阵
He and Ari and Uzi are going to stay with me for a little while.

392
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,670
他们回来干什么
Why are they allowed to do that?

393
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,380
我也不清楚
I don't know exactly

394
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,260
不过他看起来很失落
but I think he's been very depressed.

395
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,880
我也失落
So am I.

396
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,340
你怎么了
So are you, what?

397
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,340
有必要搬走吗
But why is this necessary?

398
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,600
我不想再混吃等死了  我得改变一下
'Cause I'm in a rut, and I need a change.

399
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,810
等等
Hang on.

400
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,650
出租车
Taxi!

401
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,650
车上有个凹痕
That cab has a dent in it.

402
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:50,370
你是不是不爱我了
You don't love me anymore, do you?

403
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,540
一点点吧
I do, kind of.

404
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,460
我现在解释不清楚
I can't explain it right now.

405
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,670
这有个缺口  那也有个
Another dent here, and another dent here.

406
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,720
我会打给你的  好吗
I'll call you, okay?

407
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,580
你好
Hello.

408
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,910
有人吗
Hello?

409
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,450
你好  美人
Hello, beautiful.

410
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,520
有时间吗
Got a minute?

411
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,200
你在这干什么
What are you doing here?

412
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,780
想请你帮个忙
I need a favor.

413
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,050
我想跟你和孩子们住一阵子
I want to spend some time with you and the children.

414
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,280
你疯了吗
Are you crazy?

415
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,530
等一下  该死的
Well, wait a minute, damn it!

416
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,640
别跟着我
Stop following me.

417
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,070
我想回家
Well, I want my family back.

418
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,460
你不能回来
Well, you can't have it.

419
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,450
真遗憾  但是已经太晚了
I'm sorry for you, but it's too late.

420
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,200
听我说
Well, listen...

421
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,840
宝贝  我活不了多久了
Baby, I'm dying.

422
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,340
我病得很重
Yeah, I'm-I'm sick as a dog.

423
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,190
只剩6周了
I'll be dead in six weeks.

424
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:22,320
我快死了
I'm dying.

425
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,760
你说什么
What are you talking about?

426
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,880
怎么回事
What's happening?

427
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,940
对不起
I'm sorry.

428
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,320
我不知道
I didn't know.

429
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,760
医生怎么说
Well, what'd they say?

430
00:22:58,370 --> 00:22:59,870
什么病
What is the prognosis?

431
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,760
放松点  
Take it easy, Ethel.

432
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,670
别哭  宝贝  别哭
Now, hold-hold on, baby, hold on.

433
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,670
坚强点
Hold on, okay?

434
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,470
别哭  别哭
Ethel, hold on, hold on.

435
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,760
医生在哪
Where is the doctor?

436
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,050
别...你先...
Don't... Well, just...

437
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,350
先等一下
Wait a second now.

438
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,680
冷静
Wait a second.

439
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:21,270
好了  我没生病
Okay, listen, I'm not dying...

440
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,020
我只想和你们在一起
But I need some time.

441
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,270
1个月左右  行吗
A month or so, okay?

442
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,070
我希望...我希望我们能...
I want us... I want us to-to...

443
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,070
你有毛病吧
What's wrong with you?!

444
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,570
该死
Damn!

445
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,660
艾瑟
Ethel,

446
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,660
你疯了吧
Are you crazy?!

447
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,200
艾瑟  宝贝...
Ethel, baby...

448
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,450
我确实活不久了
I am dying.

449
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,970
你到底有没有
Are you or aren't you?

450
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,680
什么  生病吗
What? Dying?

451
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,930
有
Yeah.

452
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,310
你告诉孩子们了吗
Have you told your children?

453
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,810
透露了点
More or less.

454
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,610
他们还好吗
And are they all right?

455
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,230
不好说
It's hard to say.

456
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,610
你爸是谁
Who's your father?

457
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,490
他叫罗伊・特伦鲍姆
His name is Royal Tenenbaum.

458
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,240
你明明说过他已经去世了
You told us he was already dead.

459
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,200
好吧  现在他真的快去世了
Yeah, well, now he's really dying.

460
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,120
-准备好了  -打印吧
- Ready. - Print it.

461
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,620
真遗憾  玛戈
I am very sorry, Margo.

462
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,660
没关系
That's okay.

463
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,660
毕竟我们没有血缘关系
We're not actually related, anyway.

464
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,750
确实
True.

465
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,870
麻烦你  我想回个信
I'd like to send a response, please.

466
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,540

474
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,900
超人鲍姆
Hey, Baumer.

475
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,820
能不能和你拍张照
Do you mind if we get a picture with you?

476
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,190
没问题
Not at all.

477
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240

479
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,790
到码头接他回家
to meet him at the pier by way of the Green Line bus.

480
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,630
和以往一样  她迟到了
As always, she was late.

481

我在街边徘徊

482
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,920
沉默地度过这些天
I don't do too much talking these days

483
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,470
这些日子
These days

484
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,180
这些日子里  我独自沉思
These days I seem to think a lot

没多久了
Not long.

我现在只有你们和妈妈了
The three of you and your mother are all I've got

517

查斯  让我说完

521
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,660
可以给我这个机会吗
Will you give me a chance?

522
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,700

我代表我自己
I speak for myself.

525
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,830
那么你的答案我知道了
Well, you've made your views known.

526
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,170
让其他人发表一下意见吧
Let somebody else do some of the talking now.

527
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,340
你打算怎么做
What do you propose to do?

528
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,260
我也说不上来
I can't say, really.

529
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,840
弥补遗失的的时光吧
Make up for lost time, I suppose.

530
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,340
首先我想
First thing I want to do is

531
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:49,180
找个时间带你们去看看奶奶
take you out to see your grandmother, at some point.

532
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,930
6岁以后我就没有去过那里了
I haven't been out there since I was six.

533
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,810
我从来没去过

我从未被邀请过
I was never invited.

535
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,690
她并不是你真正的奶奶
Well, she wasn't your real grandmother

536
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,610
我不知道你是否愿意  宝贝
and I never knew how much interest you had, sweetie.

537
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,530
那么  现在我邀请你
Anyway, you're invited now.

538
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,700
谢谢
Thanks.

我妻子
My wife.

542
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,250
没错  是的
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

543
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,540
我们也会去给她扫个墓
Well, we'll have to swing by her grave, too.

544
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,960
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

我能见见孙子们吗
Can I see my grandsons?

547
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,720
干什么
Why?

548
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,940
因为我最后想见见他们
Because I finally want to meet them.

549
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,230
别再跟我较劲了
Don't give me that guff.

550
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,440
我们都会习惯的
I think we'll pass.

551
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,240
帕戈达
Pagoda,

552
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,330
我的那幅海芙琳娜呢

553
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,290
晚安了  孩子们
I'll say good-night to you now, children.

558
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,860
看看那头老灰熊
Look at that old grizzly bear.

559
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,070
回来了  艾瑟

565
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,330
不太好  我活不了多久了
Not too well. I'm dying.

566
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,130
里奇还好吗
How's Richie?

567
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,840
不知道
I don't know.

568
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,630
我说不上来
I can't tell.

569
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,170
我也是
Yeah, me neither.

570
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,130
他给我写了封信
He wrote me a letter.

571
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:50,470
他说爱上了你
He says he's in love with you.

572
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
你说什么
What are you talking about?

573
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,640
他就是这么说的
That's what he said.

574
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,940
我不知道该怎么理解这句话
I don't know how we're supposed to take it.

575
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,140
等一会
Hang on.

576
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,610
谁啊
Hello.

577
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,490
亲爱的  是我伊莱
Sugar, it's Eli.

578
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,990
宝贝儿  等一下
Hey, baby, give me a second.

579
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,740
你在干什么  伊莱
What are we doing, Eli?

580
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,120
我顺手捎点东西
Oh, I just got to pick something up.

581
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
对了  别和里奇提这件事
Don't repeat that, by the way. About Richie.

582
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,540
他私下和我说的...
It was told to me in confidence, and, you know...

583
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,840
很好
Good.

584
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,460
现在扫开浮土
Now just remove the loose soil

585
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,540
然后记录腐烂程度
and note the decomposition levels.

586
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,240
抱歉在工作时打扰你
I'm sorry to interrupt your work.

587
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,300
别犯傻
Don't be silly.

588
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,060
来吧
Come on.

589
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:46,760
我想为那天求婚的事
I just want to apologize for the other day

590
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,190
向你道歉
when I proposed to you.

591
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,190
为什么
Why?

592
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,610
我觉得很温馨啊
I thought it was very sweet.

593
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,410
你身边那么多完美成熟人士
I know I'm not as accomplished as some of the men

594
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,910
我自愧不如  
you've been involved with.

595
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,700
像弗兰克林・班尼迪克  卡特莱特将军
Franklin Benedict, General Cartwright

596
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,080
还有你前夫
and your ex-husband.

597
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,450
这太可笑了
Oh, that's ridiculous.

598
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,120
但是  但是  我觉得
But, but, I feel

599
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,040
我能和他们一样为你付出
I can offer just as much as them.

600
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:08,710
我现在是有点前后矛盾  但是…
I know I went about it backwards, but...

601
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,170
亨利  我对弗兰克林・班尼迪克
Henry, I have no interest in Franklin Benedict

602
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,050
或是道格・卡特莱特一点兴趣也没有
or Doug Cartwright-I never did

603
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,850
至于罗伊  他是最...
and as far as Royal's concerned, he's the most...

604
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,350
亨利
Henry?

605
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,730
亨利  你还好吧
Henry, are you all right?

606
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,810
我没事  没事
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

607
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,270
请你想好之后告诉我答案
Anyway, let me know when you make up your mind.

608
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,230
亨利  等一下
Henry, wait a second.

609
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,240
对不起  我太紧张了
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.

610
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,070
没关系
Th-That's okay.

611
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,410
谢谢
Thank you.

612
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,040
你为什么这么紧张
Why are you so nervous?

613
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,960
说实话
Well, to tell you the truth

614
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,300
我已经18年没和男人睡过了
I haven't slept with a man in 18 years.

615
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,360
你们有一条老猎犬啊
That's a hell of an old hound dog you got there.

616
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,490
它叫什么
What's he go by?

617
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,910
巴克利
Buckley.

618
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,830
巴克利  坐下
Buckley, sit.

619
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,330
知道我是谁吗
You know who I am?

620
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,330
我叫罗伊
I'm Royal.

621
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,040
听说过吗
Have you heard of me?

622
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,010
你们失去母亲我感到很难过
I'm very sorry for your loss.

623
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:18,720
她是个很有魅力的女人
Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.

624
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,930
谢谢你
Thank you.

625
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,850
你叫什么
Which one are you?

626
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,010
阿里
Ari.

627
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,770
我是你们的爷爷
Uzi, I'm your granddad.

628
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:26,060
你好
Hello.

629
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,690
真遗憾  我们对彼此都不了解
I'm sorry we haven't gotten to know each other.

630
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,810
因为我不怎么受欢迎
I don't get invited around very much.

631
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,190
你们觉得我怎么样
What do you think of that, by the way.

632
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,530
你们什么都不用说
Oh, you... you don't have to say anything.

633
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,910
估计是什么糟老头子之类的话吧
It's kind of a "Fuck you" to the old man, I guess.

634
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,370
你们爸爸还好吗
How's your daddy?

635
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:42,320
挺好的
Fine.

636
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:43,330
是吗
You think so?

637
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,200
他经常让你们来锻炼吗
How often has he got you working out?

638
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:47,200
每周16次
16 times a week.

639
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,210
帮我个忙
Do me a favor.

640
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,880
告诉他你们想见我
Tell him you want to meet me.

641
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,420
但我们刚见过啊
But we just met.

642
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,420
我们没有
No, we didn't.

643
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,050
我希望我们能更亲密一点
Look, I'd like us to have a relationship

644
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,430
不过得用点小计策才行
but we have to pull some strings to make it happen.

645
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,680
你们这么对他说...
Now, here's what you tell him. You say...

646
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,850
我敢打赌妈肯定希望
Well, I bet Mom would have wanted us

647
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,390
我们能在他过世前去见见他
to meet him before he died.

648
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,430
对吧
Wouldn't she?

649
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,060
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

650
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,620
她是个坚强的老太婆  对吧
She was a tough old broad, wasn't she?

651
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,950
我不知道
I wouldn't know.

652
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,540
我离开一下  过来
Excuse me. Come on.

653
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,620
对了
Oh, that's right.

654
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,670
还有另一个人的墓要扫呢
We've got another body buried here, haven't we?

655
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,750
等下
Hold on.

656
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,050
拿点这个
Take some of these.

657
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,300
过来
Come on.

658
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,560
把那个大块头的黑人埋在这里
So what do you think of this big, old black buck

659
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,640
你觉得怎么样
moving in up there?

660
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,270
谁
Who?

661
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,520
亨利・谢尔曼
Henry Sherman.

662
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,730
认识他吗
You know him?

663
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,150
认识
Yeah.

664
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,110
能诅咒他吗
Is he worth a damn?

665
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,860
我觉得行
I believe so.

666
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,120
你的手指为什么没了
What happened to your finger?

667
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,040
乌兹  嘘
Uzi, shh.

668
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,080
没关系  可以告诉你
It's okay, I'll tell you.

669
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,660
我是养女  你们知道吧
I'm adopted. Did you know that?

670
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,170
我确实是
Well, I am.

671
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,460
14岁时我去寻找真正的家人
When I was 14, I went to find my real family.

672
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,710
他们住在印第安纳州
They live in Indiana.

673
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,590
拿根胡桃木树干
All right, now, just set one of them hickory trunks

674
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
立这  玛姬妹妹
right up top there, sister Maggie.

675
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,980
你试过把它缝回去吗
Did you try to sew it back on?

676
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,610
不值得
Wasn't worth it.

677
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,990
这该死的墓碑
Hell of a damn grave.

678
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,540
真希望它是我的
Wish it were mine.

679
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,870
很可惜  对吧
It's a shame, isn't it?

680
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,250
什么
What?

681
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,830
你在赛场上的黄金时代
Well, you probably had another good two or three years

682
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,330
也许还能再延续2到3年
of competitive play in you.

683
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,540
也许吧
Probably.

684
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,170
我在那场比赛上下了很多注  知道吗
I had a lot riding on that match, you know.

685
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,470
经济上和感情上都是
Financially and personally.

686
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,600
那天为什么会输  超人鲍姆
Why did you choke out there that day, Baumer?

687
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,720
甘地40-15领先
Mr. Gandhi leads 40-15.

688
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,510
那是第七十二次
That's 72 unforced errors

689
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,220
里奇・特伦鲍姆非受迫性失误了
for Richie Tenenbaum.

690
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,560
这是他一生中最糟糕的比赛
He's playing the worst tennis of his life.

691
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,510
他现在是怎么想的  泰克斯・海沃德
What's he feeling right now, Tex Hayward?

692
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,600
我不知道  吉姆
I don't know, Jim.

693
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,990
他明显是出什么事了
There's obviously something wrong with him.

694
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,990
他把自己的鞋和一只袜子脱了
He's taken off his shoes and one of his socks

695
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,790
而且...其实我觉得他哭了
and... actually, I think he's crying.

696
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,220
我想是的
I think you're right.

697
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,250
朋友席上他一直看的那人是谁  泰克斯
Who's he looking at in the friends' box, Tex?

698
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
是他姐姐玛戈
That's his sister, Margot

699
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,100
和她新婚丈夫・圣克莱尔
and her new husband, Raleigh St. Clair.

700
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:39,540
他们昨天刚完婚  吉姆
They were just married yesterday, Jim.

701
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,990
是这样啊
Oh, yes.

702
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,910
我从没见过这样的比赛
I've never seen anything like this.

703
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,130
我也是
Neither have I.

704
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,920
速风球场上匪夷所思的一天
Strange day out here at Windswept Fields.

705
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,860
那之后我基本上就消失了  是吧
I kind of disappeared after that, didn't I?

706
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,860
是啊
Yeah.

707
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,860
但是我理解
But I understood.

708
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,200
你不怎么会排解失望
I know you're not very good with disappointment.

709
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,040
那个BB弹还在你手上吗  查斯
You still got that little BB in your hand, Chassie?

710
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,420
你当初为什么朝我开枪
Why did you shoot me?

711
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,020
那不是游戏规则吗
It was the object of the game, wasn't it?

712
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:31,920
不是
No.

713
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,870
我们是同一队的
We were on the same team.

714
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,950
是吗
Were we?

715
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:39,920
那么  你当初还起诉我
Well... you sued me.

716
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,370
还两次  害我律师执照都没了
Twice. Got me disbarred.

717
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:44,680
我也没有怪你  不是吗
I don't hold it against you, do I?

718
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,850
特伦鲍姆先生怎么可能
And how is it possible

719
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,600
在没有你签署授权书的情况下
for Mr. Tenenbaum to withdraw these funds

720
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
撤回资金呢
without your written authorization?

721
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,570
反对  法官大人  该死  我...
Objection, Your Honor. Damn it, I...

722
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,360
你怎么不让我喊反对  罗伊
Why don't you leave the objections to me, Royal?

723
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,280
因为我未成年开公司
Because I started the corporation when I was a minor.

724
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,850
所以几乎我所有的账目
So, my father was the primary signatory

725
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:57,590
都由我父亲担当原始签字人
on most of my accounts.

726
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,020
我14岁时
He also stole bonds

727
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,810
他还从我的保险箱中盗取债券
out of my safety deposit box when I was 14.

728
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,210
你能试着原谅我吗
You think you could start forgiving me?

729
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,920
为什么
Why should I?

730
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,630
因为这让我很受伤
Because you're hurting me.

731
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,540
过来
Come on.

732
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,340
你进过监狱吗
Were you in prison?

733
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,720
算是吧
Kind of.

734
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:27,980
低度设防
Minimum security.

735
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:30,020
我被美国国税局监控过
I got jacked by the IRS.

736
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,290
我们该走了吧
Should we split?

737
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:32,350
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

738
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,340
叫我特伦鲍姆先生
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.

739
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,750
好吧
Okay.

740
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,620
我开玩笑呢  叫我爷爷
No, I'm kidding; call me Pappy.

741
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,960
好的
Okay.

742
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:42,860
来  我们撤吧
Come on, let's shag ass.

743
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,080
如果你需要帮助
Well, just let me know

744
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,550
只管告诉我  好吗
if you need somebody to talk to, okay?

745
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:48,730
我挺喜欢罗利的
I like Raleigh very much.

746
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,610
他是比你大很多
I know he's a lot older than you are

747
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:52,680
你们两个之间出了些问题
and you two are having some problems

748
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,860
但是...总之  也许我能帮上忙
but... anyway, maybe I can help.

749
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,820
好  谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

750
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,900
超人鲍姆  很好
Hey, Baumer! All right!

751
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,150
对了  我知道那封你写给伊莱的信了
By the way, I heard about that letter you sent to Eli.

752
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,560
你的烟掉了
You dropped some cigarettes.

753
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,250
不是我的
Those aren't mine.

754
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:22,670
是从你口袋里掉出来的
They just fell out of your pocket.

755
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
天啊  瞧瞧你
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

756
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,360
快进来
Come in.

757
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,090
你是不是告诉了玛戈
Did you tell Margot

758
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,610
我给你写的那封信
about that letter I wrote to you?

759
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,820
怎么了  她提这事了吗
Why? Did she mention it?

760
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,200
我告诉她了
Yes, I did.

761
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,000
她为什么要提这事
Why would she have repeated that, I wonder?

762
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,830
我也想问你这个问题
Well, I would ask you the same question.

763
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,960
没错
Rightly so.

764
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,270
你说什么
What'd you say?

765
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,310
什么
What?

766
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,730
我没说话啊
I didn't say anything.

767
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:25,940
什么时候  现在吗
When? Right now?

768
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,490
抱歉  别理我
I'm sorry, don't listen to me.

769
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,820
我嗑药了
I'm on mescaline.

770
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,910
神游了一整天
I've been spaced out all day.

771
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,910
你是说你嗑药了
Did you say you're on mescaline?

772
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,080
没错  很频繁
I did, indeed. Very much so.

773
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:46,500
你多久...
How often do you... uh?

774
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,250
里奇  我很担心你
I'm worried about you, Richie.

775
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,260
为什么
Why?

776
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,170
其实是玛戈  因为某些事
Well, actually, Margot is, for some reason.

777
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,590
但是你说你爱上她的时候
But I did find it odd

778
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,390
我确实觉得怪怪的
when you said you were in love with her.

779
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,430
她都结婚了
She's married, you know.

780
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,230
是啊
Yeah.

781
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,600
她还是你姐
And she's your sister.

782
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,110
领养的
Adopted.

783
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,660
我的百科全书呢
Where are my encyclopedias?

784
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,130
在仓库里
They've been placed in storage.

785
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,140
见鬼去吧  你们拿了我的百科全书
Well, damn you. You're taking my encyclopedias.

786
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,890
-这...这是在侮辱我  -抱歉
- Th... this is humiliating. - I'm sorry.

787
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:28,190
您可以写投诉信
Would you like to make a complaint in writing?

788
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,100
我该去哪
Where am I supposed to go?

789
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,520
你们让我成了流浪汉
You're turning me into a damn hobo.

790
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,080
我很愿意帮您预定其他宾馆
I'd be happy to make a reservation for you at another hotel.

791
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,820
混账东西
You son of a bitch.

792
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,350
弗雷德里克
Frederick.

793
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,240
你好啊  达斯蒂
Hello there, Dusty.

794
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,040
你好
Hello.

795
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,750
能借我个硬币吗
Could you spot me a quarter?

796
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:42,160
当然
Of course.

797
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,050
是里奇吗
Richie? Hi.

798
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,960
我是你爸
It's your dad.

799
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:53,320
我觉得他很孤独
I think he's very lonely,

800
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,200
比他装出来的还要孤独
lonelier than he lets on,

801
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,690
可能比他想的还要孤独
maybe lonelier than he even realizes.

802
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,860
你和他说过这个吗
Have you spoken to him about this?

803
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,410
简单提过  他同意我们...
Briefly, and he agreed that we...

804
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,160
抱歉  我好像有点糊涂了
I'm sorry, maybe I'm a little confused here.

805
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,720
你什么意思
What are you suggesting?

806
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,330
我想让他来住我的房间
That he come here and stay in my room.

807
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,120
你疯了吗
Are you out of your mind?

808
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,770
我没有  不管怎样
No, I'm not. Anyway,

809
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,110
他住这里会更舒服些  比起...
I think that he'd be much more comfortable here than he would...

810
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,680
-谁在乎他  -我
- Who gives a shit? - I do.

811
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,820
你这个可悲的傻瓜
You poor sucker.

812
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,560
长不大的小屁孩
You poor, washed-up papa's boy.

813
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,850
好了  大家冷静点
All right, let's not get out of hand.

814
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:25,690
谢尔曼先生  不用你掺和
Please, don't get in the middle of this, Mr. Sherman.

815
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,830
这是我们家的事
This is a family matter.

816
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,370
别这么和他说话
Don't talk to him like that.

817
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,250
叫我亨利
Call me Henry.

818
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,500
还是叫谢尔曼先生好点
I prefer Mr. Sherman.

819
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,460
叫他亨利
Call him Henry.

820
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,020
凭什么  我跟他没那么熟
Why? I don't know him that well.

821
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,820
你认识他10年了
You've known him for ten years.

822
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,930
他是你的会计师
As your accountant,

823
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,260
就该称呼他谢尔曼先生
Mr. Sherman, yes.

824
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,040
你睡哪里呢
Where are you going to sleep?

825
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,730
我在楼上搭个帐篷
I'm just going to camp out upstairs.

826
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,690
我们带了睡袋
We brought our sleeping bag.

827
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,540
-乌兹  -我们不介意的  爸爸
- Uzi! - We don't mind, Dad.

828
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,460
我们喜欢他
We like him.

829
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,720
谁  爷爷吗
Who, Pappy?

830
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,140
爷爷
Pappy?

831
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,580
他可以睡楼上
He can sleep in the room above us.

832
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,040
阿里  你说的不算
Ari, it's not your decision.

833
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,760
你说的也不算
Nor is it yours.

834
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,540
他已经在楼上了
Well, he's already up there.

835
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
什么
What?!

836
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,120
可能因为吃药的关系  他已经睡了
I think he's asleep because of the medication he's on,

837
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:04,650
但你可以叫醒他  把他赶出去
but I... I guess you can wake him up and throw him out,

838
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,090
如果妈同意
if Mom says it's okay.

839
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,420
出去
Get out.

840
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,280
好吧
All right.

841
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,640
我收拾下东西
Let me just collect my things.

842
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,040
里奇  你能把拐杖递给我吗
Would you mind handing me my cane, Richie?

843
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,630
我想想  我的行李箱哪去了
Let me see, where's my suitcases?

844
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,140
我帮你拿
I'll get 'em.

845
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,810
谢了
Oh, thanks.

846
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:33,710
爸
Dad!

847
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:36,090
妈
Mom!

848
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,920
儿子  给我拿片戊巴比妥好吗
Grab me a Nembutal, will you, son?

849
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,760
你没事吧
Are you okay?

850
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,680
管你什么事
What the fuck you care?

851
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,600
老天啊
Oh, my goodness.

852
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,760
帕戈达
Pagoda?

853
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,220
给麦克鲁尔医生打电话
Call Doctor McClure.

854
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,860
深吸一口气  憋住
Take a breath and hold it.

855
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,190
咳嗽一下
Now cough.

856
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:02,990
他的情况很稳定
His condition is stable.

857
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,450
只是有点副作用
The attack was just a side effect.

858
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,500
我建议你们让他吃流食
I recommend you push fluids

859
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,910
继续胃癌药物治疗
and continue the stomach cancer medication.

860
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,130
我们能挪动他吗
Can we move him?

861
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:21,050
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

862
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:23,220
多久才行
For how long?

863
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,140
我们得等等看
We'll have to wait and see.

864
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,970
他会好起来吗
Is he going to be all right?

865
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,020
看情况  他意志坚强吗
That depends. Is he a fighter?

866
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,560
是的
Yeah.

867
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,390
那就是最好的情况了
Then that's the best we've got.

868
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,650
帕戈达那有个包裹  里面有我的遗嘱
Pagoda's in possession of a parcel containing my will

869
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:43,030
还有一些对葬礼的要求
and some instructions for the funeral

870
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,160
以及我的墓志铭
including my epitaph, for when the time comes.

871
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,490
在往墓碑上刻之前
Proofread it for me

872
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,870
帮我校对一下  好吗
before they carve it on the headstone, okay?

873
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,580
好的
Okay.

874
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,080
还有  我对你的爱从未停止过
I never did stop loving you, by the way.

875
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,380
你相信吗
Do you believe that?

876
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,000
不太信
Not really.

877
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:59,550
你真漂亮
You look terrific.

878
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,380
裙子也很迷人
That dress is stunning.

879
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,470
谢了
Thanks.

880
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,530
天使的眼泪
Tears that angels cry

881
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:34,040
模糊了天空
And they darken all the sky

882
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,370
关灯了  老头
Lights out, old man.

883
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,960
查斯  我还想看会书
I thought I'd read for a while, Chas.

884
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,800
抱歉  11点半了  关灯
Sorry, 11: 30. Lights out.

885
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,720
我正读在兴头上呢
I'm right in the middle of a sentence.

886
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,090
明早再接着读吧
Well, you'll have to finish it in the morning.

887
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,350
这是规矩
These were the rules.

888
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,390
查斯
Chas?

889
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,100
晚安  儿子
Good night, my boy.

890
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,400
爱人告别之际
When the one you love says good-bye

891
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,570
用歌声陪她安眠
Sing a lullaby

892
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,660
你和老头子又和好如初了呗
Looks like you and Dad are back together again, huh?

893
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,670
查斯  他也是你爸啊
He's your dad too, Chas.

894
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,250
-他不是  -他是
- No, he's not. - Yes, he is.

895
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,170
你对我恨之入骨了是吧
You really hate me, don't you?

896
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,800
没有  我爱你
No. I don't. I love you.

897
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:26,510
我不知道
Well, I don't know

898
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,210
你这么做是想逃避什么
what you think you're going to get out of this.

899
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,220
但是相信我
But believe me,

900
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:32,150
无论如何  这样都不值得
whatever it is, it's not worth it.

901
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,090
查斯
Chas,

902
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:39,440
我不想伤害你
I don't want to hurt you.

903
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,740
我知道  你和孩子们生活得很辛苦
I know what you and the boys have been through.

904
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,000
你是我哥  我爱你
You're my brother, and I love you.

905
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,320
够了
Stop saying that!

906
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:03,290
那个蠢货在干什么
What's that jackass doing?

907
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,330
我认识你的  混蛋
I know you, asshole!

908
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,920
伊莱寄给你的吗
Did Eli send you that?

909
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,900
他一直都给我寄他的剪报
He always sends me his clippings.

910
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,060
为什么
What for?

911
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,000
我想他只是喜欢受到鼓励吧
I think he just likes the encouragement.

912
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,120
他寄了好几年了
He's done it for years.

913
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,000
他以前还给我寄他大学的成绩单
He used to send me his grades in college.

914
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,470
太荒唐了吧
That's ridiculous.

915
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,030
你要在这里待多久
How long do you intend to stay here?

916
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,190
不知道
I don't know.

917
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,190
你还回家吗
Are you ever coming home?

918
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:57,680
也许不回了
Maybe not.

919
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,260
你在开玩笑吧
You're joking.

920
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,600
没有
No.

921
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:09,820
我真想死了算了
Well, I want to die.

922
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:16,990
罗利  别这样
Raleigh, please.

923
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,250
你爱上别人了吗
Have you met someone else?

924
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,330
我从没想过
I couldn't even begin to think about

925
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,420
自己要回答这样的问题
knowing how to answer that question.

926
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:35,090
我不喜欢你那样对待罗利
I don't like the way you're treating Raleigh.

927
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,180
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

928
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:41,640
你都不认识他
You don't even know him.

929
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:43,600
我看见他了  我觉得他不该受到...
Well, I've met him, and I don't think he deserves...

930
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:46,730
别瞎掺和
Stay out of it.

931
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,570
你给他戴绿帽子
You're two-timing him

932
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:52,740
和那个混蛋伊莱・凯什鬼混
with that bloodsucker Eli Cash.

933
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,740
你不应该这样  真该死
Now, that's just not right, damn it.

934
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,910
你以前是个天才
You used to be a genius.

935
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:03,080
我不是
No, I didn't.

936
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,960
反正人们过去常常这么说
Anyway, that's what they used to say.

937
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:16,590
里奇  我知道你和玛戈最亲
Richard, I know you're terribly close to Margot

938
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,850
可能也最了解她
and probably understand her better than anyone.

939
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:21,850
我能跟你说说真心话吗
May I confide in you?

940
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,650
可以
Okay.

941
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,230
我觉得她有外遇
I believe she's having an affair.

942
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,610
我要崩溃了
I'm utterly devastated.

943
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,320
我不知所措
I... don't know where else to turn.

944
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,490
你能给我点建议吗
Will you advise me?

945
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,960
不知道  你想怎么办
I don't know. What do you want to do?

946
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,290
我不知道  也许...
I don't know. Perhaps, uh...

947
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,790
找到那家伙  揍一顿
Find the guy and get him?

948
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,590
不  我想我们可以...
Well, no, I thought we could...

949
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,970
你觉得可能是谁
Who do you think it might be?

950
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:59,390
我现在还不知道
I don't know at the moment.

951
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,850
我们看看现货好吗
Let's look at the actuals, okay?

952
00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:05,980
我完全同意你
I agree with you a hundred percent.

953
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:08,150
因此我们才有营销网
That's why we have marketing grids.

954
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,650
我们去小东京买烟火吧
What do you say we go down to Little Tokyo

955
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,320
怎么样
and get some fireworks?

956
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,240
你有什么需要的吗
What do you need?

957
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,410
没什么
Nothing.

958
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:19,870
我看见你在逼他们算数
I see you got them, uh, crunching numbers for you.

959
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:23,490
请不要进这个房间
Please don't come in this room.

960
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,000
查斯把孩子
Chas has those boys cooped up

961
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:26,960
像野兔一样关起来  艾瑟琳
like a pair of jackrabbits, Etheline.

962
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,500
他有他的道理
He has his reasons.

963
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,170
这我知道  但不能让男孩胆小怕事
Oh, I know that, but you can't raise boys to be scared of life.

964
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,510
应该让他们学着无畏一点
You got to brew some recklessness into them.

965
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:40,180
我觉得这个建议很糟糕
I think that's terrible advice.

966
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,180
才没有
No, you don't.

967
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:46,600
我们上拳击和防身课
We take boxing and self-defense classes.

968
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,690
我不是说舞蹈课
I'm not talking about dance lessons.

969
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,610
我是说
I'm talking about

970
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,650
用砖头砸别人的挡风玻璃
putting a brick through the other guy's windshield.

971
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:56,990
找点麻烦什么的
I'm talking about taking it out and chopping it up.

972
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:58,780
你什么意思
What do you mean?

973
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,200
妈的睡衣掉下了床
The mama pajama rolled out of bed

974
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:02,950
她跑到警察局
And she ran to the police station

975
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:07,040
爸发现了  大喊大叫
When the papa found out, he began to shout

976
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,790
开展调查
And he started the investigation

977
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:10,960
这是与法律对抗
It's against the law

978
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,040
快跑
Go!

979
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,210
这是与法律对抗
It was against the law

980
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,300
妈看见了什么  这是与法律对抗
What the mama saw, it was against the law

981
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:22,260
妈向下一瞥  把痰吐在地上
The mama looked down and spit on the ground

982
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,810
每当提起我的名字
Ev'ry time my name gets mentioned

983
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:27,270
爸就会说  如果我抓到这小子
The papa said, "Oy, if I get that boy

984
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,440
一定关他禁闭
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention"

985
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,560
我在路上
Well, I'm on my way

986
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,980
不知去往何方
I don't know where I'm goin'

987
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,730
我在路上
I'm on my way

988
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,400
抓紧时间
I'm takin' my time

989
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,740
却不知去往何方
But I don't know where

990
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:43,620
再见了罗西  日光女王
Good-bye to Rosie, the Queen of Corona

991
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,330
过来
Come here.

992
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:46,310
你  我  还有胡里奥
See you, me and Julio

993
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:46,910
这就对了  快跑
That's it! Run!

994
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,660
停留在操场
Down by the schoolyard

995
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,550
你  我  还有胡里奥
See you, me and Julio

996
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:52,750
停留在操场
down by the schoolyard

997
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,750
他救过我的命
He saved my life, you know.

998
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,750
那是30年前
30 years ago,

999
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,240
我在加尔各答的集市上挨了一刀
I was knifed in a bazaar in Calcutta.

1000
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:25,160
他把我背到了医院
He carried me to the hospital on his back.

1001
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,350
是谁干的
Who stabbed you?

1002
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,510
就是他
He did.

1003
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,290
当时有人出钱要我的人头
Yeah, there was a price on my head,

1004
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,380
他是雇来的杀手
and he was a hired assassin.

1005
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:37,380
用弹簧刀刺在我肚子上
Stuck me right in the gut with a shiv.

1006
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,100
怎么了
What?

1007
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,290
你们去哪了
Where have you been?

1008
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:56,830
我们就是出去透透气
Uh, we just stepped out to get some air.

1009
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:00,090
这是怎么了
What's that?

1010
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,130
我的天啊  不是吧
Holy shit. That's not?

1011
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:03,720
这是怎么了
What is that?

1012
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:08,050
没事啦  是狗血
Oh, no, no, that's, uh, dog's blood.

1013
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:09,880
干什么
What?

1014
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,260
你离我的孩子远点
You stay away from my children.

1015
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,630
明白没
Do you understand?

1016
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,550
天啊  我多少年都没进这里了
My God, I haven't been in here for years.

1017
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,140
你有没有听我说话
Hey! Are you listening to me!

1018
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,640
听着呢
Yes, I am!

1019
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,270
我觉得你精神失常了
I think you've having a nervous breakdown!

1020
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,270
你并没有走出瑞秋离世的阴影
I don't think you recovered from Rachael's death.

1021
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,900
我...
I...

1022
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,540
原来你在这
There you are.

1023
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:51,840
{\pos(234,209)}罗伊和艾瑟琳在公园的小路散步  罗伊带着羊毛帽子
拄着拐杖  孩子们在池塘后的树丛中玩耍...

1024
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:57,470
你感觉如何
How are you feeling?

1025
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:59,260
我很开心
I'm having a ball.

1026
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:02,640
和大家一起吵吵闹闹
Scrapping and yelling and mixing it up.

1027
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,350
享受和家人相处的每一分钟
Loving every minute with this damn crew.

1028
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,770
还要谢谢你把孩子们抚养大
I want to thank you for raising our children by the way.

1029
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:13,940
好吧
Okay.

1030
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,240
我不是开玩笑
I'm not kidding.

1031
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,280
你总是把他们放在第一位  不是吗
You always put them first, didn't you?

1032
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,910
我想了
I tried to.

1033
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,950
最近我觉得我可能不是一个好母亲
Lately I feel like maybe I didn't do such a great job.

1034
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,490
别这么想
God damn it, don't do that to yourself.

1035
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,410
我才是没有尽责
I'm the one that failed them.

1036
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,460
或者说  谁都没错
Or, anyway, it's nobody's fault.

1037
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,920
再说了  不是...
Plus that it doesn't...

1038
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,920
罗伊  你为什么不关心我们
Why didn't you give a damn about us, Royal?

1039
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,960
为什么一点都不在意
Why didn't you care?

1040
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:38,260
我不知道
I don't know.

1041
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,050
我为自己感到羞耻
I'm ashamed of myself.

1042
00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:46,430
但我要告诉你一件事
I'll tell you one thing, though.

1043
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,480
你是我认识的女人中
You got more grit, fire and guts

1044
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,480
最有毅力  最热情  最勇敢的
than any woman I have ever met.

1045
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,610
你...你笑什么
What... what are you smiling about?

1046
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,070
没什么
Nothing.

1047
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,610
什么这么搞笑
No, wha... what's so funny?

1048
00:55:57,690 --> 00:55:58,780
没什么
Nothing.

1049
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:01,280
就是在笑你这些表达方式
It's these little expressions of yours.

1050
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,450
我不懂你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about,

1051
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,870
就当你在夸我吧
but I'll take it as a compliment.

1052
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,250
你很专情  艾瑟  
You're true blue, Ethel.

1053
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,540
真的
You really are.

1054
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,260
你的感情生活如何
How's your love life?

1055
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,920
不关你事
None of your business.

1056
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,440
我希望你和罗伊谈谈我们的事
I'd like you to talk to Royal about us

1057
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,770
如果你不介意
if you don't mind.

1058
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:36,610
亨利  我觉得不是谈这个的时候
I don't think the timing's right for that, Henry.

1059
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:39,690
如果我相信他真的只有6周活头
Well, I'd agree if i thought he was really

1060
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:41,280
我也会这样觉得
going to die in six weeks.

1061
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,360
但是我不相信
But I don't.

1062
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:47,370
我倒希望如此了
Well, I hope you're right.

1063
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:53,120
我今晚不想和你出去了
Actually, I don't believe I'll join you tonight.

1064
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,170
明早给你打电话吧
I'll call you in the morning.

1065
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,010
她是那么说的吗
She said that?

1066
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:09,640
太棒了
Great.

1067
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,350
让那傻瓜去死吧
Got the sucker on the ropes.

1068
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,450
亨利  能问你个问题吗
Can I ask you something, Hank?

1069
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,210
可以啊
Okay.

1070
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,760
你是不是想撬走我的女人
Are you trying to steal my woman?

1071
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,930
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

1072
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,010
老黑  你听明白了
You heard me, Coltrane.

1073
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,680
-老黑  -怎样
- Coltrane? - What?

1074
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,770
-你刚是不是叫我老黑  -没有
- Did you just call me "Coltrane"? - No.

1075
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,190
-没有吗  -没有
- You didn't? - No.

1076
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,320
好吧
Okay.

1077
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,070
但是就算我叫了
But if I did,

1078
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,620
你也不能把我怎么样
you wouldn't be able to do anything about it, would you?

1079
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,870
-你真这么想吗  -当然
- You don't think so? - No, I don't.

1080
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,120
听着  罗伊
Listen, Royal,

1081
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,710
如果你想继续在这混...
if you think you can march in here...

1082
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,080
你想讲黑人英语吗
You want to talk some jive?

1083
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:18,540
那我就跟你说说
I'll talk some jive.

1084
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:20,210
我说的你可能从没听过
I'll talk some jive like you've never heard.

1085
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,590
-是吗  -当然了
- Oh, yeah? - Right on!

1086
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:23,130
-坐下  -什么
- Sit down. - What?!

1087
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:24,130
你...你刚说什么
Wh... what did you say?

1088
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,220
我说坐下  该死的
I said sit down, goddamn it!

1089
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:27,010
我听见了  你给我滚出我家
Oh, I heard you! I want you out of my house!

1090
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,180
这不是你家
This is not your house!

1091
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,550
你给我滚出去  混蛋
I want your raggedy ass out!

1092
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:30,850
别跟我玩文字游戏
Don't talk semantics with me.

1093
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:31,850
这不是你的...
Oh, this is not your...

1094
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,680
你们怎么回事
What's going on here?

1095
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,730
没什么
Nothing.

1096
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,590
喂  我想找寇比综合医院的麦克鲁尔
Hello, I'm calling in regards to a Dr. McClure, yes,

1097
00:59:02,670 --> 00:59:04,380
麦克鲁尔医生
at Colby General.

1098
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,920
病人的名字是罗伊・特伦鲍姆
The name of the patient is Royal Tenenbaum.

1099
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:13,140
这是薄荷糖吗
Is that a Tic-Tac?

1100
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,610
他给了你多少钱
How much is he paying you?

1101
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:29,610
我不知到你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

1102
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,280
我在特伦鲍姆家长大
Well, I grew up with the Tenenbaum family, you know.

1103
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:33,370
对
Right.

1104
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,530
就在街对面
Across the street.

1105
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,950
他们现在处境艰难  对吗
They've fallen on hard times now, haven't they?

1106
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,000
我没法否认
I can't say no.

1107
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,670
一派胡言
This is bullshit.

1108
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,040
换台
Change it, huh?

1109
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:47,800
你的手怎么了
What did you do to your hand?

1110
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,720
没什么
Uh, nothing.

1111
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:57,100
我们能请人来灭鼠吗
Can we get somebody over here to kill these mice for us?

1112
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,140
不能  它们是查斯的东西
No. They belong to Chas.

1113
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,850
或者说  是他发明了它们
Or anyway, he invented them.

1114
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:06,780
好吧  让他把它们关在笼子里之类的
Well, get him to stick them in a fucking cage or something.

1115
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,320
艾瑟琳  能上来一下吗
Etheline... mind coming up here for a minute, please?

1116
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:12,860
老头儿  你要干什么
What's cooking, Pops?

1117
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,160
你马上就知道了
You'll see.

1118
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,240
-你的上一部小说 -《野猫》
- Now, your previous novel... - Yes. Wildcat.

1119
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,580
并不成功
Not a success.

1120
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,290
为什么
Why?

1121
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:33,140
《野猫》里用的都是些过时的方言
Well, Wildcat was written in a kind of obsolete vernacular.

1122
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:38,560
野猫...
Wildcat...

1123
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:41,270
野生的...猫
Wild... cat...

1124
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,230
野猫
Wildcat...

1125
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:51,400
我得走了
I'm going to go.

1126
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,700
我要走了  我要把这个拿掉
I'm taking this off and I'm going.

1127
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,070
走出去
Stepping out.

1128
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,870
这怪异的行为是怎么回事
What the hell kind of way to act is that?

1129
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,240
开门
Open the door.

1130
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,370
他嗑药了
He's on drugs.

1131
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,750
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

1132
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,040
詹姆斯・布拉德利
James Bradley...

1133
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,960
请稍等
Hold on a minute, please.

1134
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:10,170
怎么了
What's going on?

1135
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,800
帕戈达有些话要说
Pagoda has something to say.

1136
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:19,930
他得了癌症
He has a cancer.

1137
01:01:20,020 --> 01:01:21,370
他没得
No, he doesn't.

1138
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:25,600
我知道得了胃癌看起来是什么样子
I know what stomach cancer looks like.

1139
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:26,720
我见过
I've seen it.

1140
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:29,080
要是你得了胃癌的话
And you don't eat three cheeseburgers a day

1141
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:31,390
不可能一天吃得下三个加了炸薯条的汉堡
with French fries if you got it.

1142
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,280
胃癌疼得让人难以忍受
The pain is excruciating.

1143
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,280
你怎么知道
How would you know?

1144
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,320
我妻子得的就是胃癌
My wife had it.

1145
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:41,660
寇比综合医院不光没有麦克鲁尔医生这人
Not only is there no Dr. McClure at Colby General

1146
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,750
寇比综合医院根本就不存在
there is no Colby General.

1147
01:01:43,830 --> 01:01:46,370
它1974年就倒闭了
It closed in 1974.

1148
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:47,960
该死
Aw, shit, man.

1149
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,050
该死
Oh, shit, man.

1150
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,100
麻烦你立刻派辆出租车
Yes, can you send a taxi

1151
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,850
到射手大街111号
to 111 Archer Avenue right away, please?

1152
01:02:03,940 --> 01:02:04,850
谢谢
Thank you.

1153
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,450
兄弟  我们又要流落街头了吗
I guess we're back out on the street, huh, pal?

1154
01:02:16,530 --> 01:02:18,780
你也参与了吗  帕戈达
Were you part of this, Pagoda?

1155
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,370
他当然参与了
Of course he was.

1156
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,870
没有  好吧  他参与了
No, well, yeah, he was

1157
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,250
可是  他没牵涉很多
but, I mean, he wasn't that involved.

1158
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:27,120
你从哪儿弄来的这些医用器械
Where'd you get all these medical supplies?

1159
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,670
有个圣皮特医院的家伙欠我个人情
A guy at St. Pete's owed me a favor.

1160
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:33,460
我帮他处理过医疗事故的案子
I did some malpractice work for him.

1161
01:02:33,550 --> 01:02:36,380
不过  我真的有高血压
I do have high blood pressure, though.

1162
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,470
我知道这次是我不对
Look, I know I'm going to be the bad guy on this one.

1163
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,890
不过我真的想告诉你们  过去的这6天
But I just want to say, the last six days have been

1164
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,810
是我这辈子最美好的6天
the best six days of probably my whole life.

1165
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,190
说完这句话后
Immediately after making this statement

1166
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,820
罗伊立刻意识到了这是事实
Royal realized that it was true.

1167
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,330
你为什么这么对我们  罗伊
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

1168
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:05,580
到底是为了什么
What was the point?

1169
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,830
我以为能把你抢回来
I thought I could win you back.

1170
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:11,840
另外  我也以为能除掉亨利
And then I thought I could get rid of Henry...

1171
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,550
或者至少是维持现状
and at least keep the status quo.

1172
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:16,210
可我们有7年没有说过话了
But we hadn't spoken in seven years.

1173
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,590
我知道
I know.

1174
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:21,260
再加上
Plus, uh...

1175
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,680
我破产了
I was broke.

1176
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,480
还被踢出了我住的酒店
And I got kicked out of my hotel.

1177
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,350
你真是个混蛋
You're a bastard.

1178
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,060
再见  罗伊
Good-bye, Royal.

1179
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:48,580
查斯  别对孩子那么严格
Take it easy on those boys, Chassie.

1180
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,670
我不希望你重蹈我的覆辙
I don't want this to happen to you.

1181
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,760
里奇  这个病  和死亡亲密接触
You know, Richie, this illness, this closeness to death

1182
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,760
对我影响很深
has had a profound effect on me.

1183
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,810
我觉得我变了个人似的  真的
I-I feel like a different person, I really do.

1184
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:13,480
爸  你本来就不会死
Dad, you were never dying.

1185
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,650
可是我还得活下去
But I'm going to live.

1186
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:30,620
他不是你父亲
He's not your father.

1187
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:33,580
你也不是
Neither are you.

1188
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,910
你个狗娘养的
You son of a bitch!

1189
01:05:07,990 --> 01:05:10,290
该死的
God... damn...

1190
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,420
这是你最后一次用刀捅我了  听到了吗
That's the last time you put a knife in me, hear me?

1191
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:29,180
去Y大街375号
The 375th Street Y, please.

1192
01:05:36,150 --> 01:05:39,280
{\pos(220,202)}一幢像城堡似的建筑  门牌上写着Y大街375号
房间小得可怜  天花板很低  有一张单人床...

1193
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,700
所有人都讨厌我
Everyone's against me.

1194
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,700
兄弟  这是你的错
It's your fault, man.

1195
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:52,450
我知道  该死  我希望家人都喜欢我
Yeah, I know, but damn it, I want this family to love me.

1196
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:53,660
你有多少钱
How much money you got?

1197
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,000
一分也没有
I don't have.

1198
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,790
什么  你破产了吗
What, you're broke?

1199
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,250
你在逗我吧
You got to be kidding me.

1200
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:01,460
我们怎么付房租
How are we going to pay for this room?

1201
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,720
好吧  我们会想到办法的
All right, we'll think of something.

1202
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,200
我不爱你了
I'm not in love with you anymore.

1203
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:34,870
我不知道你什么时候爱过我
I didn't know you ever were.

1204
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,370
我们就维持现状吧
Let's not make this any more difficult than it already is.

1205
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,170
好吧
Okay.

1206
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,970
什么好吧
Okay, what?

1207
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:49,970
好吧  我也不爱你了
Okay, I'm not in love with you, either.

1208
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,230
是啊  我知道
Yes, I know,

1209
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:56,100
你爱的是邋遢恶心的里奇
you're in love with Richie which is sick and gross.

1210
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:03,650
是你把你的剪报和大学的成绩单
Do you send my mother your clippings

1211
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,990
寄给我妈的吗
and your grades from college?

1212
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:12,030
别再鄙视我了
Please stop belittling me.

1213
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,530
在我的书开始得到好评之前
You never gave me the time of day

1214
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,960
你一直对我不理不睬
till I started getting good reviews.

1215
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,010
你的书评也没有那么好
Your reviews aren't that good.

1216
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,430
可是销量很好
But the sales are.

1217
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,690
先生们  你们知道多少了
Gentlemen... how much do you already know?

1218
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:43,770
恐怕只有一点点
Very little, I'm afraid.

1219

你准备好看报告了吗
Would you like to examine the report?

1220

你在帮他渡过难关
You're pulling him through

1272
01:10:59,050 --> 01:11:02,890
犹如大海捞针
Needle in the hay

1273
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:04,720
大海捞针
Needle in the hay

1274
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:07,310
我明天自杀
I'm going to kill myself tomorrow.

1275
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:11,020
大海捞针
Needle in the hay

1276
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:14,480
大海捞针
Needle in the hay

1277
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,860
达利  他在哪儿
Dudley, where is he?

1278
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,530
谁
Who?

1279
01:12:06,370 --> 01:12:08,700
他可能会昏睡几个小时
He'll probably sleep for several hours

1280
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,960
然后我会回来给他做检查
and then I'll come back to check on him.

1281
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:12,380
好吗
All right?

1282
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:18,920
你觉得怎么样
How are you feeling?

1283
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,590
很好  谢谢
Fine, thanks.

1284
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,090
疼吗
Are you in any pain?

1285
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,550
不怎么疼
Not really.

1286
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,760
你为什么想自杀
Why'd you try to kill yourself?

1287
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:27,430
别逼他
Don't press him right now.

1288
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,730
我写了封遗书
I wrote a suicide note.

1289
01:12:29,810 --> 01:12:31,270
真的吗
You did?

1290
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:32,560
是的
Yeah.

1291
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:35,650
就在我恢复知觉以后
Right after I regained consciousness.

1292
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:39,320
我们能看吗
Can we read it?

1293
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,450
不行
No.

1294
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,740
你能跟我们说说吗
Can you paraphrase it for us?

1295
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:46,330
不行
I don't think so.

1296
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,450
很阴暗吗
Is it dark?

1297
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:49,750
当然了
Of course it's dark.

1298
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,290
那是遗书
It's a suicide note.

1299
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,750
好吧  那就够了
All right, that's enough.

1300
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:54,670
医生说让他睡一会儿
Doctor said to let him sleep.

1301
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,050
什么
What?!

1302
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,970
帮我们掩护一下  好吗  达斯蒂
Cover for us, will you, Dusty?

1303
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,760
好的  罗伊
Yes. Yes, Royal.

1304
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:21,920
你给我戴了绿帽子
You've made a cuckold of me.

1305
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,220
我知道
I know.

1306
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,990
很多次
Many times over.

1307
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:30,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

1308
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,120
你差点害死你可怜的弟弟
And you nearly killed your poor brother.

1309
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,290
他在说什么
What's he talking about?

1310
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:40,960
没什么
It doesn't matter.

1311
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,130
她和伊莱・凯什有一腿
She's balling Eli Cash.

1312
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,220
我的天啊
Oh, my goodness.

1313
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:51,770
能给我支烟吗
May I have a cigarette?

1314
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,980
什么
What?

1315
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,480
还用我再说一次吗
Shall I repeat the question?

1316
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:00,610
你不会抽烟
You don't smoke.

1317
01:14:00,690 --> 01:14:02,740
我知道
I know that.

1318
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,710
还有打火机
And a light.

1319
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:26,380
再见
Au revoir.

1320
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:39,440
你抽了多久的烟了
How long have you been a smoker?

1321
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,110
22年
22 years.

1322
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,610
我觉得你该戒掉
Well, I think you should quit.

1323
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,040
我能帮什么忙吗
How can I help?

1324
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:02,090
让我看看这些表格
Let me look at these forms.

1325
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,520
亨利
Oh, Henry.

1326
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,740
我探望里奇・特伦鲍姆
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

1327
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,990
你叫什么
Your name?

1328
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:28,110
罗伊・特伦鲍姆
Royal Tenenbaum.

1329
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,280
探病时间已经过了  先生
I'm afraid visiting hours are over, sir.

1330
01:15:31,370 --> 01:15:34,160
你这是什么意思  他们不想见我吗
Wh-Wh-What does it say there - they don't want me?

1331
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,370
很抱歉
I-I'm sorry.

1332
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:36,750
我建议你去找巴罗斯医生
I have to refer you to Dr. Burrows.

1333
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,120
他明天下午会在
He'll be in tomorrow afternoon.

1334
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:54,760
我们可以顺着排水槽爬上去
We could shimmy up that gutter,

1335
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,770
跳过窗台
jump over that window ledge,

1336
01:15:56,850 --> 01:15:59,940
然后  撬开换气扇口
and then, uh, pry open that ventilator shaft.

1337
01:16:00,020 --> 01:16:01,770
他在那里
There he is.

1338
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:03,190
里奇
Richie!

1339
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,860
里奇
Richie.

1340
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,530
他要去哪儿
Where's he going?

1341
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:15,200
里奇
Richie!

1342
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,130
好吧  我不得不说
Well, I have to say

1343
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:30,130
他看起来不像自杀的人
he didn't look half bad for a suicide.

1344
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,470
不管怎样  自杀未遂
Attempted, anyway.

1345
01:16:33,550 --> 01:16:35,050
多谢
Thanks.

1346
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,970
拜托
Please

1347
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,560
再给我一次恩惠
Give me second grace

1348
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,360
拜托
Please

1349
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,240
再见我一面
Give me a second face

1350
01:16:52,950 --> 01:16:56,120
我已深陷其中
I've fallen far down

1351
01:16:56,200 --> 01:17:00,410
从第一次开始
The first time around

1352
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,830
现在我坐在你的必经之路上
Now I just sit on the ground in your way

1353
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:15,970
现在
Now

1354
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:18,220
如果是时候偿还
If it's time for recompense

1355
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,600
我所做的一切
For what's done

1356
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,600
谁在那儿
Who's there?

1357
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:24,060
来
Come

1358
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:27,310
坐在阳光照耀的篱笆上
Come sit down on the fence in the sun

1359
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,860
有人吗
Hello?

1360
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:34,360
白云飘过
And the clouds will roll by

1361
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:37,120
我们永远不会否认
And we'll never deny

1362
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:48,380
你在我的帐篷里干什么
W-What are you doing in my tent?

1363
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:51,630
听听唱片
Just listening to some records.

1364
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,300
你不应该在医院里吗
Aren't you supposed to be in the hospital?

1365
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:56,640
我自己出院了
I checked myself out.

1366
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,040
你缝了多少针
How many stitches did you get?

1367
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:23,790
不知道
I don't know.

1368
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,500
你想看吗
You want to see?

1369
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,750
他们日复一日留在那里
They seem to stay for day after day

1370
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:32,920
永不消失
And won't disappear

1371
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:34,170
天啊
Jesus.

1372
01:18:34,260 --> 01:18:36,130
我用尽一切方式
I tried every way

1373
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:40,300
里奇  看起来太可怕了
Richie, that looks horrible.

1374
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:43,970
我听说了你前夫的事情
I heard about your ex-husband.

1375
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:44,930
德斯蒙德吗
Desmond?

1376
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,140
也许是
I guess so.

1377
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:47,940
我不知道他的名字
I didn't get his name.

1378
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:49,440
是啊
Yeah.

1379
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,770
我在海上遇到他
I met him in the ocean.

1380
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:53,030
我当时正在游泳
I was swimming

1381
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:56,030
他划着独木船出现在我面前
and he came out to me in a canoe.

1382
01:18:56,110 --> 01:18:58,160
我们的婚姻只维持了9天
We were only married nine days.

1383
01:18:58,240 --> 01:18:59,950
我还听说了伊莱的事
And I heard about Eli.

1384
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,370
我知道
I know.

1385
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:05,960
可怜的伊莱
Poor Eli.

1386
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,460
总之  他们多半都谈到过你
Anyway, they mostly just talked about you.

1387
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,290
是吗
They did?

1388
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:14,960
是的
Yeah.

1389
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:18,000
大概那就是吸引我的地方吧
I guess that was the attraction,

1390
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,220
你懂我的意思吧
if you know what I mean.

1391
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:27,350
她笑得那么甜美
She smiled sweetly

1392
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,770
说着不要担心
And says don't worry

1393
01:19:29,860 --> 01:19:31,980
告诉你一件事
I have to tell you something.

1394
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:33,980
什么事
What's that?

1395
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,690
我爱你
I love you.

1396
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:43,530
我也爱你
I love you, too.

1397
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:50,000
不用再费力找寻
There's no use trying

1398
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:52,630
你就在这里
You're here

1399
01:19:52,710 --> 01:19:56,960
再一次开始
Begin again

1400
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,430
再一次
And o'er again

1401
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:06,470
她温柔的诉说着
That's what she said so softly

1402
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,100
我总是情不自禁的想你
I can't stop thinking about you.

1403
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:12,400
我离开这1年  思念却更加强烈
I went away for a year, and it only got worse

1404
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,480
我不知该如何是好
and I don't know what to do.

1405
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:18,610
我们躺一会儿好吗
Let's lie down for a minute.

1406
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,030
她笑得那么甜美
She smiled sweetly

1407
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:27,450
她笑得那么甜美
She smiled sweetly

1408
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:29,660
这个睡袋
This is the sleeping bag

1409
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,580
是我们带到博物馆的那个  是不是
we took to the museum, isn't it?

1410
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,010
不  不对
Oh, no, no, no

1411
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:39,970
你为什么这么做
Why'd you do it?

1412
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,760
因为我吗
Because of me?

1413
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:46,060
是啊  但这不是你的错
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

1414
01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:54,440
你不会再这么做了  对吗
You're not going to do it again, are you?

1415
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,150
我不知道
I doubt it.

1416
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,650
她从来不说
She would never say

1417
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:03,570
她来自何方
Where she came from

1418
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:10,540
昨天已无所谓
Yesterday don't matter

1419
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,870
它已逝去
If it's gone

1420
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,920
太阳依然明亮
While the sun is bright

1421
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,680
或者在最黑暗的夜晚中
Or in the darkest night

1422
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,430
无人知晓
No one knows

1423
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:28,710
我觉得我们只能私下相爱  
I think we're just going to have to be secretly in love

1424
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:30,680
保持现状  里奇
with each other and leave it at that, Richie.

1425
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:38,940
再见  红宝石星期二
Good-bye, Ruby Tuesday

1426
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:43,610
谁能给你带来名誉
Who could hang a name on you

1427
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:48,120
每当崭新的一天来临  你都会随之改变
When you change with every new day

1428
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,290
我依然会想念你
Still I'm gonna miss you

1429
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:53,290
大厅到了
Lobby floor.

1430
01:21:56,540 --> 01:21:57,540
谢谢你  先生
Thank you, sir.

1431
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:05,300
上楼吗
Going up?

1432
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,640
是的
Yeah.

1433
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:07,970
去哪层  先生
What floor, sir?

1434
01:22:08,050 --> 01:22:10,060
无所谓
Doesn't matter.

1435
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,900
所以你现在是开电梯的吗
So, you're elevator operators now?

1436
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,600
是啊  刚开始干
Yeah, just started.

1437
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:23,380
一加入工会就会加薪
We'll get a bump as soon as we join the union.

1438
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:25,830
你为什么干这行
What made you decide to do that?

1439
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:27,940
我们破产了
We're broke.

1440
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,510
不过  回答你的问题
But in answer to your question

1441
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:32,000
我想要证明
I wanted to prove

1442
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,200
我能独立生活什么的
I could pay my dues, and whatnot.

1443
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,510
我只是希望有人能注意到
I just hope somebody notices.

1444
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,270
你问过我那天为什么自杀
You asked me why I choked out there that day.

1445
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:44,510
我大概知道为什么了
I think I may know the answer

1446
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:46,550
想听听你的意见
and I wanted your advice.

1447
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:49,080
好啊
Sure.

1448
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,050
玛戈・特伦鲍姆
Margot Tenenbaum?

1449
01:22:59,050 --> 01:22:59,870
是  
Yeah.

1450
01:22:59,870 --> 01:23:01,420
什么时候开始的
Well, since when?

1451
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,320
一直都是
Since always.

1452
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,700
她知道吗
Does she know?

1453
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:06,650
知道
Uh-huh.

1454
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:09,820
那她怎么想的
Well, what does she feel about that?

1455
01:23:10,410 --> 01:23:12,440
我觉得她挺困惑的
I think she feels confused.

1456
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:13,470
不难理解
Well, I can understand that.

1457
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:14,840
你俩大概都不合法
It's probably illegal.

1458
01:23:15,110 --> 01:23:15,900
我不觉得
I don't think so.

1459
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:17,730
我俩又不是血亲
We're not related by blood.

1460
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,820
这倒是
That's true.

1461
01:23:20,590 --> 01:23:22,200
还是挺诡异的
Still frowned upon.

1462
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,710
但反正现在什么都挺诡异的
But then, what isn't these days, right?

1463
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,560
我不知道  没准也能成
I don't know, maybe it works.

1464
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:37,730
是吧  管它呢
Why not, what the hell.

1465
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,270
你俩互相喜欢
You love each other.

1466
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:42,400
也没人知道以后会怎么样
Nobody knows what's going to happen, so...

1467
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,980
你知道吗
You know something.

1468
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:47,780
别听我的
Don't listen to me.

1469
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,860
我一直都不懂她
I never understood her myself.

1470
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:51,950
你们几个我都搞不懂
I never understood any of us.

1471
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,780
我希望能告诉你该怎么做
I wish I could tell you what to do

1472
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:55,830
但我说不出
but I just can't.

1473
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,580
没关系的
That's okay.

1474
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,750
有关系
No, it's not.

1475
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,090
你还把我当爸吗
You still consider me your father?

1476
01:24:05,170 --> 01:24:08,760
当然
Sure, I do.

1477
01:24:08,840 --> 01:24:12,590
真希望我能做的更称职一点
I wish I had more to offer in that department.

1478
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,680
爸  你做的挺好的
I know you do, Pop.

1479
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,400
这不怪你
I don't blame you, by the way.

1480
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,220
她漂亮
Uh, she's a great-looking girl

1481
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:27,280
聪明机灵
and smart as a whip.

1482
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:28,780
莫迪凯
Mordecai.

1483
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:36,620
丝黛芬妮在想  半生已过
Stephanie says that she wants to know

1484
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:41,120
为何身边环绕之人
Why she's given half her life

1485
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:45,460
都会令她十分厌恶
To people she hates now...

1486
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:47,630
我的天
Holy shit.

1487
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,630
你回来了
You came back.

1488
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:51,800
天哪
Jiminy crickets.

1489
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:55,140
这鸟脑袋里肯定装雷达了
That damn bird must have radar in its brain.

1490
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,470
是不是  莫迪凯
Is that true, Mordecai?

1491
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,470
我不确定这就是莫迪凯
I-I'm not so sure this is Mordecai.

1492
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,640
你说啥呢
What do you mean?

1493
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:00,980
他直接就飞过来了
He flew right in here.

1494
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,400
这只鸟的白羽毛太多了
This bird has much more white feathers on him.

1495
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:09,320
这小鬼头肯定是掉毛呢
Oh, the son of a bitch must be molting.

1496
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,990
还得再让你帮个忙
Oh. I need your help with something else.

1497
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:13,660
没问题  怎么了
You got it. What's the situation?

1498
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:15,320
我觉得伊莱可能...
Well, um, I think Eli maybe...

1499
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,030
等下
Hold it.

1500
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,620
帕戈达  在大堂等我
Pagoda, meet me in the lobby.

1501
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:20,910
我们行动
Let's hit it.

1502
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,340
我不是指现在...不过也行
I didn't mean right this second, but... that's okay.

1503
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:28,960
我觉得不是拉美西斯
I don't think it was Ramses.

1504
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,340
应该是图亭卡门
I believe it was Tootinkamen.

1505
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,510
是图坦卡门
Tutankhamen.

1506
01:25:31,590 --> 01:25:32,760
图坦卡门
Tutankhamen?

1507
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:34,010
对  图坦卡门
Yes. Tutankhamen.

1508
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:41,060
谁
Yes?

1509
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,440
你好  里奇
Hey, Richie.

1510
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:57,280
我们要带你去戒毒
We want to take you to get some help.

1511
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,200
没别人跟着你们
Is it just you guys?

1512
01:26:01,290 --> 01:26:04,620
能单独谈谈吗
Would you excuse us, please?

1513
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,210
好
Okay.

1514
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,680
我们还是朋友吗
Are we still friends?

1515
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:22,600
什么意思
What do you mean?

1516
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,770
是不是
Are we?

1517
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:24,940
当然了
Of course.

1518
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:26,980
你怎么能这么问
How can you even ask me that?

1519
01:26:27,060 --> 01:26:28,400
反正也没关系了
Well, it doesn't matter.

1520
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,480
没关系
It doesn't matter?

1521
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:30,730
当然有关系
It does matter.

1522
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:33,280
我听说你和玛戈的事了
I heard about you and Margot.

1523
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,860
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1524
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:46,290
我不知道该怎么说
I don't know what to say.

1525
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:48,090
什么都不用解释
You don't have to say anything.

1526
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:52,920
我一直想成为你家里人  你知道的
I always wanted to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

1527
01:26:53,010 --> 01:26:55,510
我也是
Me, too.

1528
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:59,680
当然没有小时候那么想了
Course it doesn't mean what it used to though, does it?

1529
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:04,120
要是小时候你也对我这么好就好了
I wish you'd done this for me when I was a kid.

1530
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:08,250
那时候你还没吸毒呢
But you didn't have a drug problem then.

1531
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,770
是  但那会对我意义重大
Yeah, but it would've meant a lot to me.

1532
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:14,420
感谢你来找我了
Anyway, I'm glad you're here now.

1533
01:27:15,050 --> 01:27:17,570
我知道吸毒不对
I recognize that I have a problem...

1534
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:21,120
我也想戒掉
and I want to get better.

1535
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,250
我去收拾下
I'll just grab my stuff.

1536
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:37,300
他跑了
There he goes.

1537
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:38,510
什么
What?!

1538
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:39,510
他跑了
There he goes.

1539
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:40,890
停车
Tucker!

1540
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,640
慢点  慢点
Skiddly, skiddly.

1541
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:53,940
圣诞将至
Christmastime is here

1542
01:27:54,030 --> 01:27:56,360
欢声笑语
Happiness and cheer...

1543
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,820
我要给女儿点份冰淇淋
I'd like to order some ice cream for my daughter, please.

1544
01:27:59,910 --> 01:28:01,160
想要什么  玛戈
What would you like, Margot?

1545
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,030
什么都不用  我说了5分钟内得走
Nothing. I told you I have to go in five minutes.

1546
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:11,500
那就要个奶油糖圣代吧
I'll have a butterscotch sundae, I guess.

1547
01:28:17,470 --> 01:28:20,220
你弟弟心里很纠结
Your brother's all torn up inside.

1548
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,110
我也是
Well, so am I,

1549
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:23,510
但我不打算跟你说这些
but I'm not going to discuss it with you.

1550
01:28:27,230 --> 01:28:30,480
浪子回头金不换
Can't somebody be a shit their whole life and try to repair the damage?

1551
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,020
人人不是就欢喜这个嘛
I-I mean, I think people want to hear that.

1552
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:35,020
是吗
Do they?

1553
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:40,030
你可能都不知道我教名是什么
You probably don't even know my middle name.

1554
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:46,030
这是个陷阱
That's a trick question.

1555
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:47,370
你没有教名
You don't have one.

1556
01:28:47,450 --> 01:28:48,700
海伦
Helen.

1557
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:51,870
那是我母亲的名字
That was my mother's name.

1558
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:54,880
我知道
I know it was.

1559
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:11,350
想一起随便吃点什么
Anybody interested in grabbing a couple burgers

1560
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,480
然后去墓地吗
and hitting the cemetery?

1561
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:37,590
我给你带了点东西  艾瑟

1562
01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:39,050
我亲手做的
Actually, I made it.

1563
01:29:39,130 --> 01:29:40,460

离婚协议书
It's a divorce.

1565

01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,760
对
Yes.

1567

公证人
He's a notary public.

1569
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:48,260
-你好  -你好先生

1572
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:56,610
这楼是你的吗  亨利
You own this building, don't you, Henry?

1573
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:01,280
真棒
It's magnificent.

1574
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,200
我原来也有房子的
I used to be a homeowner myself

1575
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,660
后来被我儿子给没收了
until our son expropriated it from me.

1576
01:30:06,660 --> 01:30:07,950
我得去赶公交了
I got to catch my bus.

1577
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:09,160
谢谢  桑切斯
Thanks, Sanchez.

1578
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:10,450
不客气
You're welcome.

1579
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:12,290
我们算离婚了吗
Are we divorced?

1580
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:13,500
差不多了
Almost.

1581
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,790
桑切斯去把文件提交了就行
Sanchez just has to file the papers.

1582
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,290
我爱你  艾瑟琳
I love you, Etheline.

1583
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:19,960
祝贺你们俩
Congratulations to both of you.

1584
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:21,920
一开始觉得他不怎么样
I didn't think so much of him at first.

1585
01:30:22,010 --> 01:30:23,130
现在我明白了
But now I get it.

1586
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:25,300
他有我没有的一切
He's everything that I'm not.

1587
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:32,220
让帕戈达回去工作吧
Take back Pagoda, will you?

1588
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,780
{\pos(201,206)}艾瑟琳和亨利射手大街婚礼请柬
封面和罗伊以前那张很相似...

1589
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,780
{\pos(195,125)}第八章

1590
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:07,300
有点歪
Uh, slightly uneven.

1591
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:10,520
没歪  你就是紧张了
Looks okay. You're just nervous.

1592
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,220
亨利
Henry?

1593
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:13,350
你好  里奇
Hello, Richie.

1594
01:31:13,430 --> 01:31:14,560

Hi.

01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:16,600
这是我儿子  沃特・谢尔曼
This is my son, Walter Sherman.

1596
01:31:16,690 --> 01:31:19,440
你好沃特  很高兴见到你
Hi, Walter. Nice to meet you.

1597
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:20,730
我也是
Nice to meet you.

1598
01:31:20,820 --> 01:31:21,980
亨利是你爸
Henry's your dad?

1599
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:24,360
对
Yes.

1600
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,400
这么说你以前结过婚
So you've been married before.

1601
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:29,280
对  我前妻去世了
Yes. I'm a widower.

1602
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:31,370
是
Oh, yeah.

1603
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:33,950
我忘了
I forgot.

1604
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:39,250
我前妻也去世了
You know, I'm a widower myself.

1605
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:45,050
我知道  查斯
I know you are, Chas.

1606
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,970
你在嚼什么
What are you chewing on?

1607
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:51,640
尼古丁呼吸器
My nicotine inhaler.

1608
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,680
帮我戒烟的
It's supposed to help me quit.

1609
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:56,270
有用吗
Is it working?

1610
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:59,310
没多大用
Not really.

1611
01:32:02,860 --> 01:32:04,570
我有一半希伯来血统
Well, of course, I'm half Hebrew

1612
01:32:04,650 --> 01:32:07,110
但孩子们是3/4爱尔兰血统
but the children are three-quarters Mick Catholic.

1613
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,400
所以他们是在教堂长大的
So they were raised in the church?

1614
01:32:09,490 --> 01:32:11,410
应该是
I believe so.

1615
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:13,280
我不太清楚
I really don't know.

1616
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:25,300
来了
Here I come.

1617
01:32:28,720 --> 01:32:30,180
孩子
Boys!

1618
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:33,470
怎么了
What was that?

1619
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:36,890
伊莱开车撞进前院里了
Eli just crashed his car into the front of the house.

1620
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:38,310
天哪
Oh, my God.

1621
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,860
我的鞋呢
Where's my shoe?

1622
01:32:54,030 --> 01:32:56,120
阿里  乌兹  你们在哪
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

1623
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:57,450
他们没事  查斯
They're okay, Chas.

1624
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,790
没事  他们没事
It's okay. They're safe.

1625
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,250
他们没事
They're safe.

1626
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:01,410
爸  巴克利被撞了
Dad, they ran over Buckley.

1627
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:02,420
什么
What?

1628
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,130
是  巴克利可能没希望了
Yeah, I think we lost Buckley.

1629
01:33:04,210 --> 01:33:05,380
他救了他们
He saved them.

1630
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,500
谁
Who?

1631
01:33:06,590 --> 01:33:08,590
爸  他把他们拉开了
Dad. He pulled them out of the way.

1632
01:33:08,670 --> 01:33:10,630
真的
You did?

1633
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:13,510
撞到谁了吗
Did I hit anyone?

1634
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:16,550
大家都还好吧
Is everybody okay?

1635
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:26,020
伊莱
Eli!

1636
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:27,270
怎么回事
What's going on?

1637
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,450
伊莱
Eli!

1638
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:40,540
什么
What?

1639
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,250
你好  伙计
Hey, man.

1640
01:33:43,330 --> 01:33:45,250
你该尝尝  特好吃
You should try this. It's very tasty.

1641
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,650
特伦鲍姆
Tenenbaum!

1642
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,940
查斯
Chas?

1643
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,390
我撞到狗了
Did I hit the dog?

1644
01:34:38,470 --> 01:34:40,470
对
Yeah.

1645
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:45,230
他死了
Is he dead?

1646
01:34:45,310 --> 01:34:47,440
对
Yeah.

1647
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:52,650
我需要救助
I need help.

1648
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:56,240
我也是
So do I.

1649
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:04,000
从另一边绕过去
Go around to the other side.

1650
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,140
你们几个待在这  我们马上回来
You kids stay there. We'll be right back.

1651
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:07,930
好
Yeah.

1652
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:12,040
能跟你说句话吗  亨利
Can I say something to you, Henry?

1653
01:35:12,120 --> 01:35:13,050
好
Okay.

1654
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:14,710
从我有印象起
I've always been considered an asshole

1655
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,300
大家一直把我当混蛋
for about as long as I can remember.

1656
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,720
我就是这样
That's just my style.

1657
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,100
但如果你不会原谅我
But I'd really feel blue if I didn't think

1658
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,630
我会很难过的
you were going to forgive me.

1659
01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:24,390
我不觉得你混蛋  罗伊
I don't think you're an asshole, Royal.

1660
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,270
我就是觉得你比较王八蛋
I just think you're kind of a son of a bitch.

1661
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:29,690
谢谢啊
Well, I really appreciate that.

1662
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,280
能让我们去下后院吗
Could you let us in your backyard, ma'am?

1663
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,990
有几个人掉在后面了
We've got a couple boys back there.

1664
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:38,190
可能是扭到脚踝了
I think you may have broken an ankle.

1665
01:35:38,190 --> 01:35:40,780
这也不是很严重啊
Well, that's not terribly serious, is it?

1666
01:35:40,870 --> 01:35:43,160
有别人可以替你吗
Do you have an alternate?

1667
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,410
没有
No.

1668
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:46,040
好了吗
Ready?

1669
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,000
没有预备牧师什么的吗
Are there priests on call?

1670
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,170
安瓦尔  你把车开过去吧
Why don't you bring the car around, Anwar.

1671
01:35:50,250 --> 01:35:53,500
我的车就失去控制了
At which point, I apparently lost control of the vehicle

1672
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:56,260
然后冲进房子  撞死了那只可怜的狗
smashed it into the house, and killed that poor dog.

1673
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:57,970
你是伊莱・凯什
You're Eli Cash.

1674
01:35:58,050 --> 01:35:59,630
是的  我是
Yes indeed, I am.

1675
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:01,140
我喜欢你的书
I love your work.

1676
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:02,970
你这么说真好
Oh, how sweet of you to say.

1677
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:09,140
我觉得他是串子
I think he's part mutt.

1678
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,730
狗证上面怎么写的
What kind of papers do you have for him?

1679
01:36:12,820 --> 01:36:14,940
中坚  坐下  坐下
Spark Plug, sit, sit.

1680
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:17,650
真棒
Good boy.

1681
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:23,200
戴上这个
Put this on.

1682
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:26,450
有什么好笑的  达利
What's so funny, Dudley?

1683
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,450
挺帅的
You look great.

1684
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,670
能看得清吗
Can you see out of it?

1685
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:32,830
不太能
Not really.

1686
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:35,000
角膜有点小创伤
Minor corneal damage.

1687
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:37,340
如果影响到另一只眼了告诉我
Page me if it spreads to the other eye.

1688
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:39,840
这个我跟谁说
Who do I make it out to?

1689
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:41,680
埃里克斯吗  好的
Alex? Okay.

1690
01:36:43,260 --> 01:36:45,600
这些没有损坏建筑结构 爸
But these aren't structure-bearing elements, Dad.

1691
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:47,020
我不管
It doesn't matter.

1692
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:48,980
还是提一个不可抗力索赔
It's still best to file another force majeure

1693
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:50,350
挽回点损失
and recoup the deductible.

1694
01:36:55,570 --> 01:36:57,730
你们两个跟我上去
You boys come up here with me.

1695
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:59,820
但巴克利还在下面
But Buckley's still under there.

1696
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:02,420
我知道  但现在
I know, but there's nothing

1697
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:04,780
我们也没法做什么
we can do for him at the moment.

1698
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:06,910
来吧
Come on.

1699
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:12,750
我给孩子们买了条狗
I got you a new dog for the boys.

1700
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:14,790
刚买的
I just bought him.

1701
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,050
真的吗
You did?

1702
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:19,300
抱歉让你们失望了  查斯
Sorry I let you down, Chas.

1703
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:21,380
让你们失望了
All of you.

1704
