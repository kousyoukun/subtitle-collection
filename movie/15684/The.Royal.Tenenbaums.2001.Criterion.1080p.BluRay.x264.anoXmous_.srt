NARRATOR:
Royal Tenenbaum bought
the house on Archer Avenue

5
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,054
in the winter of his 35th year.

6
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:59,726
(instrumental
"Hey Jude" plays)

7
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,269
Over the next decade

8
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,855
he and his wife
had three children

9
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:05,815
and then they separated.

10
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,613
Are you
getting divorced?

11
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:17,702
At the moment, no...
but... it doesn't look good.

12
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,704
Do you still love us?

13
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,038
Of course I do.

14
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:22,582
Do you still love Mom?

15
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,584
Yes, very much, but your
mother's asked me to leave

16
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,294
and I must respect
her position on the matter.

17
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:27,587
Is it our fault?

18
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,839
No.

19
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,091
Obviously,
we made certain sacrifices

20
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,635
as a result of having children,
but, uh...

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,678
no, Lord, no.

22
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:37,889
Then why'd she ask you to leave?

23
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,434
I don't really know anymore.

24
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:47,231
Maybe, uh, I wasn't as true
to her as I could've been.

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:47,982
Well, she said...

26
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,066
Let's just drop it

27
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,401
shall we, uh, Chassie?

28
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,862
NARRATOR:
They were never
legally divorced.

29
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,113
Thank you, Pagoda.

30
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:56,365
NARRATOR:
Etheline Tenenbaum
kept the house

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,575
and raised the children

32
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,952
and their education was
her highest priority.

33
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,580
Yes, I'll hold, please.

34
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,165
Thank you.

35
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,125
I need $187.

36
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,127
Write yourself a check.

37
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,760
Bene. Si.

38
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,638
Grazie mille.

39
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,017
NARRATOR:
She wrote a book
on the subject.

40
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,730
Chas, Chas!
Richie!

41
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,941
Uh, the gentleman
in the blue cardigan, please.

42
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,901
Thank you. I have
a two-part question.

43
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:32,985
Go ahead.

44
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:38,241
NARRATOR:
Chas Tenenbaum had,
since elementary school

45
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,201
taken most of his meals
in his room

46
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,662
standing up at his desk
with a cup of coffee

47
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,831
to save time.

48
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:49,168
("Hey, Jude" continuing)

49
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,838
In the sixth grade,
he went into business

50
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,422
breeding Dalmatian mice

51
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,467
which he sold to a pet shop
in Little Tokyo.

52
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,470
He started buying real estate
in his early teens

53
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:03,015
and seemed to have an almost
preternatural understanding

54
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,017
of international finance.

55
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:09,564
He negotiated the purchase
of his father's summer house

56
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:11,566
on Eagle's Island.

57
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,990
ROYAL:
Hold it, Chassie.

58
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,658
Hold it right there.

59
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,827
What are you doing?
You're on my team.

60
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,828
(chuckles)

61
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,830
There are no teams.

62
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,747
(groans)

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,501
(laughing)

64
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:34,046
NARRATOR:
The BB was still lodged
between two knuckles

65
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,507
in Chas's left hand.

66
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,302
Margot Tenenbaum was adopted
at age two.

67
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:43,014
Her father had always noted
this when introducing her.

68
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,766
This is my adopted daughter
Margot Tenenbaum.

69
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:50,563
NARRATOR:
She was a playwright, and won
a Braverman Grant of $50,000

70
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,773
in the ninth grade.

71
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,823
She and her brother Richie
ran away from home one winter

72
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,491
and camped out

73
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,870
in the African wing
of the public archives.

74
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,456
(camera shutter clicking)

75
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,124
Hi, Eli.

76
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,043
You said I could run away, too.

77
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:15,588
No, I didn't, and don't
tell anyone you saw us.

78
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,548
NARRATOR:
They shared a sleeping bag

79
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,717
and survived on crackers
and root beer.

80
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,719
Four years later

81
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,722
Margot disappeared alone
for two weeks

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:28,059
and came back
with half a finger missing.

83
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,816
Richie Tenenbaum had been
a champion tennis player

84
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,401
since the third grade.

85
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:39,570
Do you copy, Anonymous?

86
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,826
NARRATOR:
He turned pro at 17

87
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:49,121
and won the U.S. Nationals
three years in a row.

88
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,959
He kept a studio
in the corner of the ballroom

89
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,087
but had failed to develop
as a painter.

90
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,340
Up... up...

91
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,549
right...

92
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,592
perfect.

93
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,551
Pagoda?

94
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,011
NARRATOR:
On weekends

95
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,930
Royal took him on outings
around the city.

96
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,306
(yelling)

97
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,433
(dogs barking)

98
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:11,352
Put it out there.

99
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,687
NARRATOR:
These invitations

100
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,438
were never extended
to anyone else.

101
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:16,524
(laughing)

102
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:22,822
Richie's best friend, Eli Cash,
lived with his aunt

103
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,783
in the building
across the street.

104
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,619
He was a regular fixture
at family gatherings

105
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:32,039
holidays, mornings before
school, and most afternoons.

106
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,005
The three Tenenbaum children
performed Margot's first play

107
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,132
on the night
of her 11th birthday.

108
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,216
(doorbell rings)

109
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,968
They had agreed

110
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:48,139
to invite their father
to the party.

111
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,640
What'd you think, Dad?

112
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:52,309
Mmm... didn't seem
believable to me.

113
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,686
Why are you wearing pajamas?

114
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,854
Do you live here?

115
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,064
He has permission to sleep over.

116
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,774
Well, did you at least think

117
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,985
the characters
were well-developed?

118
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:01,986
What characters?

119
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,821
This is a bunch
of little kids, uh

120
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,322
dressed up in animal costumes.

121
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,158
Good night, everyone.

122
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,659
Well, sweetie...

123
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:09,577
don't be mad at me.

124
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:11,328
That's just one man's opinion.

125
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,960
CHILDREN:
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

126
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:21,297
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

127
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,509
NARRATOR:
He had not been invited
to any of their parties since.

128
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,054
In fact, virtually all memory

129
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,556
of the brilliance
of the young Tenenbaums

130
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,891
had been erased

131
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,562
by two decades of betrayal,
failure, and disaster.

132
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,563
Go, Mordecai.

133

00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,169
(classical music playing)

141
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,684
(shutter clicks)

142
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,699
I've been instructed

143
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,451
to refuse any further charges
on your room account

144
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,120
and to direct you, in writing

145
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,165
to please vacate the premises
by the end of the month.

146
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,126
What about Sing-Sang?

147
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,962
I owe her $100.

148
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,757
NARRATOR:
Royal had lived
in the Lindbergh Palace Hotel

149
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,509
for 22 years.

150
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:33,846
(keyboard clacking)

151
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
Can you pay her in cash?

152
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,725
Uh-uh.

153
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,770
NARRATOR:
He was a prominent litigator
until the mid '80s

154
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,065
when he was disbarred
and briefly imprisoned.

155
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,572
No one in his family had spoken
to him in three years.

156
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,742
Read it back to me so far,
Pietro.

157
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:03,751
New paragraph.

158
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,294
NARRATOR:
Richie had retired

159
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,004
from professional tennis at 26.

160
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:10,007
His last match had been
widely discussed in the media.

161
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,843
(tennis ball hits racquet,
bounces on court)

162
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:14,011
(applause)

163
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,597
"Your friend Richie."
End of letter.

164
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,433
NARRATOR:
For the past year,
he had been traveling alone

165
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,644
on an ocean liner
called the Cote d'lvoire

166
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,271
and had seen both poles,
five oceans

167
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,190
the Amazon and the Nile.

168
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,776
"The crickets
and the rust beetles scuttled

169
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,195
"among the nettles
of the sage thicket.

170
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,364
"'Vamanos, amigos,'
he whispered

171
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,866
"and threw
the busted-leather flint craw

172
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,369
"over the loose weave
of the saddle cock

173
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,330
and they rode on
in the friscalating dusk light."

174
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,998
(applause)

175
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,251
NARRATOR:
Eli was an assistant professor

176
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,378
of English literature
at Brooks College.

177
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,922
The recent publication
of his second novel...

178
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,926
(horses galloping,
gunfire, shouting)

179
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,554
...had earned him a sudden,
unexpected literary celebrity.

180
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,308
Well, everyone knows Custer
died at Little Bighorn.

181
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:04,937
What this book presupposes is...
maybe he didn't.

182
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,188
Let me ask you something.

183
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,315
Why would a review
make the point of saying

184
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,483
someone's not a genius?

185
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,736
You think I'm especially
not a genius?

186
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:15,322
I know w...

187
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,825
You didn't even have
to think about it, did you?

188
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,328
Well, I just don't use
that word lightly.

189
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,164
(knocking on door)

190
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:27,126
I have to go, Eli.

191
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,503
(knocking on door)

192
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,587
MAN:
Margot?

193
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,588
Uh-huh.

194
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,008
May I come in, please?

195
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,011
(water running)

196
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,851
(squeaking)

197
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,356
How are you, my darling?

198
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,152
NARRATOR:
Margo was married
to the writer and neurologist

199
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,529
Raleigh St. Clair.

200
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,614
(gulls cawing)

201
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,451
I'm fine, thank you.

202
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,952
You need to eat something.

203
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,454
May I make you dinner?

204
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,371
No, thank you.

205
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,290
(tapping prosthetic finger)

206
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,884
NARRATOR:
She was known
for her extreme secrecy.

207
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,261
For example,
none of the Tenenbaums knew

208
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,639
she was a smoker, which she
had been since the age of 12.

209
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,142
Nor were they aware
of her first marriage

210
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,895
and divorce to
a recording artist in Jamaica.

211
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,565
She kept a private studio
in Mockingbird Heights

212
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,318
under the name "Helen Scott."

213
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,072
She had not completed a play
in seven years.

214
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:44,578
17 October, third examination
of Dudley Heinsbergen.

215
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,581
All right, Dudley

216
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,084
make yours like mine.

217
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,668
(clicks)

218
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,671
NARRATOR:
Raleigh's next book was
on the subject

219
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:57,883
of a condition he called
"Heinsbergen Syndrome."

220
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,387
Where's that red one

221
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:03,389
going to go?

222
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,351
Done.

223
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,772
Good.

224
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,857
Very good.

225
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,776
(chuckles)

226
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,528
My goodness.

227
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,406
How interesting. How bizarre.

228
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:23,283
Dudley suffers
from a rare disorder

229
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,953
combining symptoms
of amnesia, dyslexia

230
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,955
and color blindness.

231
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,416
He has a highly acute
sense of hearing.

232
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,959
There is also evidence of...

233
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,544
I'm not color blind, am I?

234
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,880
I'm afraid you are.

235
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,966
(watch ticking)

236
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,601
(alarm blaring)

237
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:56,400
Ari, fire alarm! Let's go!

238
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,818
Out you go!

239
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,319
Let's go!

240
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,325
Uzi, emergency! Let's go!

241
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,748
Uzi... what did I just say?!

242
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:12,916
Look alive!

243
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,084
Fire!

244
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,502
NARRATOR:
Chas's wife Rachael

245
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,005
was killed in a plane crash
the previous summer.

246
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,006
What about Buckley?

247
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,507
It's too late. You forgot him.

248
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,092
Buckley! Buckley!

249
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,598
No elevator! There's a fire.

250
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,849
Go, go!

251
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,185
Go, go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go, go!

252
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,897
NARRATOR:
Chas and their two sons,
Ari and Uzi

253
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,025
were also on the flight
and survived

254
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,360
as did their dog

255
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,820
who was discovered in his cage

256
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,615
several thousand yards
from the crash site.

257
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,290
(clicks)

258
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,125
Four minutes, 48 seconds.

259
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,461
We're all dead,
burnt to a crisp.

260
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,129
NARRATOR:
Over the last six months

261
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,882
he had become increasingly
concerned with their safety.

262
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,884
We left Buckley.

263
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,053
It doesn't matter.

264
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,478
NARRATOR:
Etheline became
an archaeologist

265
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,146
and had overseen excavations

266
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:19,066
for the Department of Housing
and the Transit Authority.

267
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,068
Apropos of my question

268
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:25,989
regarding I-40
slash I-9 adjustments...

269
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:26,990
um...

270
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,325
(clears throat)

271
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,911
NARRATOR:
She taught a bridge class
twice a week

272
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,705
with her friend and business
manager, Henry Sherman.

273
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,709
(calculator clicking)

274
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,003
It would probably be
advantageous

275
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,005
for your marital status

276
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,591
to be legally established
as single

277
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,009
in light of the circumstances.

278
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,261
What do you mean?

279
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,263
I mean for tax purposes.

280
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,264
But I thought...

281
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,182
- Etheline...
- Yes?

282
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,892
Will you marry me?

283
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,062
I...

284
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,438
I love you, uh...

285
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:00,524
Did you already know that?

286
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,193
No, I didn't.

287
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,445
Since her separation
from her husband

288
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,239
she had had many suitors...

289
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:17,374
...but had not considered
a single one until this moment.

290
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,961
This isn't really
a tax issue, is it?

291
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,131
That's true, uh...

292
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,134
I don't know why
I put it that way.

293
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,930
Let me think about it, Henry.

294
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,062
Hello. Please tell Mr. Royal
this is the Pagoda.

295
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,816
(bell dings)

296
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,569
Lobby.

297
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,821
Thank you, Dusty.

298
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,573
You're welcome.

299
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,993
Good morning, Jerry.

300
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,328
Hmm...

301
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:58,332
Oh, there's a call for you,
Mr. Tenenbaum.

302
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,666
Who is it, Frederick?

303
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,585
A Mr. Pagoda.

304
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,962
(phone ringing)

305
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,424
What do you got?

306
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,427
The black man asked her
to be his wife.

307
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,348
No shit?

308
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,141
What did Ethel say?

309
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,644
She think about it.

310
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,607
I don't like the sound of this
one damn bit, Pagoda.

311
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,610
I mean... Lord knows

312
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,405
I've had my share
of infidelities

313
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,866
but she's still my wife.

314
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,621
And no damn two-bit,
chartered accountant

315
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,123
is going to change that.

316
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:50,050
Hi.

317
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:57,974
Hey, Pagoda,
give us a hand, huh?

318
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,060
(classical music plays)

319
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,103
(door closes)

320
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,896
(footsteps)

321
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,407
Chas?

322
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,868
What's going on?

323
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,495
We got locked out
of our apartment.

324
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,831
Did you call a locksmith?

325
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:22,999

Well, I don't understand.

327
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,753
Did you pack your bags
before you got locked out

328

or how did you?

329
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,507
It's not safe over there.

no sprinklers here, either.

♪ And other times, I... ♪

493
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,529
Stand up straight.

494
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,074
Let me get a look at you.

495
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,621
What's so funny?

496
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:27,126
Well, it's nice to see you, too.

497
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,180
NARRATOR:
That night, Etheline found
all of her children

498
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:41,057
living together under
the same roof

499
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:42,725
for the first time in 17 years.

500
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,143
Where's your dad?

501
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,570
NARRATOR:
The next morning,
Richie woke at dawn.

502
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,074
He had decided birds should not
be kept in cages

503
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:01,786
fed Mordecai three sardines,
and set him free.

504
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,976
(doorbell chimes)

505
00:27:41,327 --> 00:27:43,828
I've missed the hell out of you,
my darlings.

506
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,289
Well, you know that, though,
don't you?

507
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,125
I hear you're dying.

508
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,336
So they tell me.

509
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,879
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,298
Well, I've had a good run.

511
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,508
You don't look so sick, Dad.

512
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,260
Thank you.

513
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,845
What have you got?

514
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,805
I've got a pretty bad case
of cancer.

515
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,183
(Chas yawning):
How long you going to last?

516
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,477
Not long.

517
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:09,312
A month, a year?

518
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,481
About six weeks.

519
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,690
Let me get to the point.

520
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,193
The three of you and your mother
are all I've got

521
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,903
and I love you
more than anything.

522
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:17,987
CHAS:
Ho-ho!

523
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:19,405
- Ho-ho.
- Chas, let me

524
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,407
finish here.

525
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:25,244
Now, I've got six weeks
to set things right with you

526
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,662
and I aim to do it.

527
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,664
Will you give me a chance?

528
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:29,707
No.

529
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:30,583
You speak

530
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,667
for everyone?

531
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,044
I speak for myself.

532
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:34,837
Well, you've
made your views known.

533
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:37,173
Let somebody else do some of
the talking now.

534
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,342
What do you propose to do?

535
00:28:39,426 --> 00:28:41,260
I can't say, really.

536
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,847
Um, make up for lost time,
I suppose.

537
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,349
First thing I want to do is

538
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:49,185
take you out to see
your grandmother, at some point.

539
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,938
I haven't been out there
since I was six.

540
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,815
I haven't been out there at all.

541
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,024
I was never invited.

542
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,693
Well, she wasn't
your real grandmother

543
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,614
and I never knew how much
interest you had, uh, sweetie.

544
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,533
Anyway, you're invited now.

545
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,700
Thanks.

546
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,702
RICHIE:
You know, Rachael's buried

547
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,745
out there, too.

548
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,080
Who?

549
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,957
My wife.

550
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,250
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

551
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,544
Well, we'll have to swing
by her grave, too.

552
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,969
Uh, I'll be right back.

553
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:27,306
Chas.

554
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:31,144
Can I see my grandsons?

555
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,728
Why?

556
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,940
Because I finally want
to meet them.

557
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,400
(sighing)

558
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,235
Don't give me that guff.

559
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,448
I think we'll pass.

560
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,247
Pagoda...

561
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,333
where's my Havelina?

562
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,296
I'll say good-night
to you now, children.

563
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,714
Dad.

564
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,845
Thank you, my sweet boy.

565
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,434
I'll contact you
in the next 12 hours

566
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,144
with further instructions.

567
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,112
Look at that old

568
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:25,865
grizzly bear.

569
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,075
Hello, Ethel.

570
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,410
Good evening, sir.

571
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:31,370
Hold the cab,
will you, driver?

572
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,955
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.

573
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,207
Hey, lay it on me, man.

574
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,291
How do you do?

575
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,335
Not too well. I'm dying.

576
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,295
(upbeat music playing
on radio)

577
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,130
How's Richie?

578
00:30:41,215 --> 00:30:42,840
I don't know.

579
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,634
I can't tell.

580
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,177
Yeah, me neither.

581
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,137
He wrote me a letter.

582
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:50,473
He says he's
in love with you.

583
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,143
What are you talking about?

584
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,645
That's what he said.

585
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:58,940
I don't know how we're
supposed to take it.

586
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,149
Hang on.

587
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,236
(male vocalist singing
on radio)

588
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,114
(buzzer sounds)

589
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,616
MAN:
Hello.

590
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,493
Sugar, it's Eli.

591
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,994
Hey, baby, give me a second.

592
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,746
What are we doing, Eli?

593
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,123
Oh, I just got to pick
something up.

594
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,002
Don't repeat that,
by the way.

595
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,003
About Richie.

596
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:24,549
It was told to me in
confidence, and, you know...

597
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:29,554
(lock buzzes)

598
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,846
Good.

599
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,308
Now just remove the loose soil

600
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:38,187
and note the
decomposition levels.

601
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,189
I'm sorry to interrupt
your work.

602
00:31:40,274 --> 00:31:42,400
Don't be silly.

603
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,068
Come on.

604
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,696
I just want to apologize
for the other day

605
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,197
when I proposed to you.

606
00:31:48,282 --> 00:31:49,198
Why?

607
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:50,616
I thought it was
very sweet.

608
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:53,411
I know I'm not as accomplished
as some of the men

609
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,912
you've been involved with.

610
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,707
Uh, Franklin Benedict,
General Cartwright,

611
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:59,083
and your ex-husband.

612
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,459
Oh, that's ridiculous.

613
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,128
But, but, I feel...

614
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,047
I can offer
just as much as them.

615
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,718
I know I went about it
backwards, but...

616
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,178
Henry, I have no interest
in Franklin Benedict

617
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,055
or Doug Cartwright -
I never did -

618
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,850
and as far as Royal's concerned,
he's the most...

619
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,351
Henry?

620
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,731
Henry, are you all right?

621
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,816
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

622
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,278
Anyway, let me know
when you make up your mind.

623
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,239
Henry, wait a second.

624
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:34,243
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.

625
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,078
Th-That's okay.

626
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,417
Oh, thank you.

627
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:45,046
Why are you so nervous?

628
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,965
Well, to tell you the truth

629
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,303
I haven't slept
with a man in 18 years.

I'm very sorry for your loss.

Your mother was a terribly
attractive woman.

651
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:19,932
Thank you.

652
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,851
Which one are you?

653
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:23,018
Ari.

654
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,770
Uzi, I'm your granddad.

655
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,063
Hello.

656
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,691
I'm sorry we haven't gotten
to know each other.

657
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,818
I don't get invited around
very much.

658
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,195
What do you think of that,
by the way?

659
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,447
Oh, you...

660
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,532
you don't have to say anything.

661
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,910
It's kind of a "fuck you"
to the old man, I guess.

662
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,370
How's your daddy?

663
00:34:41,455 --> 00:34:42,329
Fine.

664
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:43,330
You think so, huh?

665
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,207
How often has he got you
working out?

666
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,209
16 times a week.

667
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,211
Do me a favor.

668
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,880
Tell him you want to meet me.

669
00:34:50,964 --> 00:34:52,423
But we just met.

670
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,424
No, we didn't.

671
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,051
Look, I'd like us to have
a relationship

672
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,430
but we have to pull some strings
to make it happen.

673
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:02,683
Now, here's what you tell him.
You say...

674
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,852
ARI:
Well, I bet
Mom would have wanted us

675
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,395
to meet him before he died.

676
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,438
Wouldn't she?

677
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,064
Don't you think?

678
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,624
She was a tough old broad,
wasn't she?

679
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,959
I wouldn't know.

680
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,544
Excuse me.
Come on.

681
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,629
Oh, that's right.

682
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,672
We've got another body
buried here, haven't we?

683
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:34,757
Uh, hold on.

684
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,053
Take some of these.

685
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:42,306
Come on.

686
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,562
So what do you think of
this big, old black buck

687
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,647
moving in up there?

688
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,273
Who?

689
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:52,525
Henry Sherman.

690
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:53,734
You know him?

691
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,152
Yeah.

692
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,112
Is he worth a damn?

693
00:35:58,532 --> 00:36:00,866
I believe so.

694
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,123
What happened to your finger?

695
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,041
Uzi, shh.

696
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,084
It's okay, I'll tell you.

697
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,669
I'm adopted. Did you know that?

698
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,171
Well, I am.

699
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:17,466
When I was 14, I went to find
my real family.

700
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:18,717
They live in Indiana.

701
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:21,595
All right, now, just set one
of them hickory trunks

702
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,681
right up top there,
sister Maggie.

703
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,563
(gasps)

704
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,984
Did you try to sew it back on?

705
00:36:35,068 --> 00:36:37,611
Wasn't worth it.

706
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,996
Hell of a damn grave.

707
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,541
Wish it were mine.

708
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,876
It's a shame, isn't it?

709
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,252
What?

710
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,838
Well, you probably had another
good two or three years

711
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,339
of competitive play in you.

712
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,549
Probably.

713
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:02,177
I had a lot riding on
that match, you know.

714
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,471
Financially and personally.

715
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:08,601
Why did you choke out
there that day, Baumer?

716
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,729
TENNIS ANNOUNCER:
Mr. Gandhi leads 40-15.

717
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,776
(crowd reacts)

718
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,695
COMMENTATOR:
That's 72 unforced errors

719
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,030
for Richie Tenenbaum.

720
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,032
He's playing the worst tennis
of his life.

721
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,034
What's he feeling right now,
Tex Hayward?

722
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,452
HAYWARD:
I don't know, Jim.

723
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:28,579
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

724
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,873
He's taken off his shoes
and one of his socks

725
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,708
and... actually,
I think he's crying.

726
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,460
COMMENTATOR:
I think you're right.

727
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:37,046
Who's he looking at
in the friends' box, Tex?

728
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,964
HAYWARD:
That's his sister, Margot

729
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:41,050
and her new husband,
Raleigh St. Clair.

730
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,010
They were just married
yesterday, Jim.

731
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,637
COMMENTATOR:
Oh, yes.

732
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,431
(crowd reacts)

733
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:52,937
COMMENTATOR:
I've never seen anything
like this.

734
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,897
HAYWARD:
Neither have I.

735
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,275
Strange day out here
at Windswept Fields.

736
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,861
I kind of disappeared
after that, didn't I?

737
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,863
Yeah.

738
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,866
But I understood.

739
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,203
I know you're not very good
with disappointment.

740
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:17,002
You still got that little BB

741
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:20,255
in your hand, Chassie?

742
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,258
(chuckling softly)

743
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,430
Why did you shoot me?

744
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:30,349
It was the object
of the game, wasn't it?

745
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,684
No.

746
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:34,186
We were on the same team.

747
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,271
Were we?

748
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:39,608
Well... you sued me.

749
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:41,652
Twice. Got me disbarred.

750
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,530
I don't hold it
against you, do I?

751
00:38:44,614 --> 00:38:45,614
And how is it possible

752
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,574
for Mr. Tenenbaum
to withdraw these funds

753
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,284
without your written
authorization?

754
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,786
Objection, Your Honor.
Damn it, I...

755
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,871
Why don't you leave
the objections to me, Royal?

756
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:55,040
Because I started the
corporation when I was a minor.

757
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,709
So, my father
was the primary signatory

758
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,043
on most of my accounts.

759
00:38:58,128 --> 00:38:59,128
He also stole bonds

760
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,755
out of my safety deposit box
when I was 14.

761
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:06,010
(chuckles uncomfortably)

762
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,178
You think you could
start forgiving me?

763
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,144
Why should I?

764
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,229
Because you're hurting me.

765
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,315
Come on.

766
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,945
Were you in prison?

767
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,904
Kind of.

768
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,489
Minimum security.

769
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,034
I got jacked by the IRS.

770
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:31,326
Should we split?

771
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,327
Yes, sir.

772
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,038
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.

773
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,330
Okay.

774
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:38,042
No, I'm kidding; call me Pappy.

775
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,668
Okay.

776
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:43,380
Come on, let's shag ass.

777
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:44,840
Well, just let me know

778
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,342
if you need somebody
to talk to, okay?

779
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:48,969
I like Raleigh very much.

780
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,346
I know he's a lot older
than you are

781
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,682
and you two are having
some problems

782
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:55,809
but... anyway,
maybe I can help.

783
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,561
Okay. Thanks.

784
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,522
Hey, Baumer! All right!

785
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:05,527
All right! Ha!
Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus.

786
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:08,947
By the way, I heard about
that letter you sent to Eli.

787
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,746
You dropped some cigarettes.

788
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,125
Those aren't mine.

789
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,544
They just fell
out of your pocket.

790
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:37,476
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

791
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,233
Come in.

792
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,238
Did you tell Margot

793
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,490
about that letter
I wrote to you?

794
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,700
Why? Did she mention it?

795
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:56,286
(sighing)

796
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,081
Yes, I did.

797
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,875
Why would she
have repeated that, I wonder?

798
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,711
Well, I would ask you
the same question.

799
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,840
Rightly so.

800
00:41:15,265 --> 00:41:18,142
What'd you say?

801
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,810
Hmm?

802
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,186
What?

803
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:23,605
I didn't say anything.

804
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,816
When? Right now?

805
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,364
I'm sorry; don't listen to me.

806
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,699
I'm on mescaline.

807
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,784
I've been spaced out all day.

808
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:37,703
(cork pops)

809
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,788
Did you say you're on mescaline?

810
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,707
I did, indeed.

811
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,959
Very much so.

812
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,378
How often do you, uh?

813
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,130
I'm worried about you, Richie.

814
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,132
Why?

815
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,051
Well, actually, Margot is,
for some reason.

816
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,469
But I did find it odd

817
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:57,264
when you said
you were in love with her.

818
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,311
She's married, you know.

819
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:04,104
Yeah.

820
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,481
And she's your sister.

821
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:08,984
Adopted.

822
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,413
Where are my encyclopedias?

823
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,831
They've been placed in storage.

824
00:42:22,916 --> 00:42:24,666
Well, damn you.
You're taking my encyclopedias.

825
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,335
- Th-this is humiliating.
- I'm sorry.

826
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,420
Would you like to make
a complaint in writing?

827
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,546
Where am I supposed to go?

828
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,089
You're turning me
into a damn hobo.

829
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,008
I'd be happy to make
a reservation for you

830
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,676
- at another hotel.
- You son of a bitch.

831
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:36,053
Frederick.

832
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,054
Hello there, Dusty.

833
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,680
Hello.

834
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,515
Could you spot me a quarter?

835
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,434
Of course.

836
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,687
Richie? Hi.

837
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,898
It's your dad.

838
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,195
I think he's very lonely...

839
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,030
Ionelier than he lets on

840
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,908
maybe lonelier
than he even realizes.

841
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,702
Have you spoken
to him about this?

842
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,871
Briefly,
and he agreed that we...

843
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:05,207
I'm sorry, maybe I'm
a little confused here.

844
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,625
What are you suggesting?

845
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:08,961
That he come here
and stay in my room.

846
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,546
Are you out of your mind?

847
00:43:11,631 --> 00:43:12,881
No, I'm not.
Anyway, I think that

848
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:15,217
he'd be much more comfortable
here than he would...

849
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,134
Who gives a shit?

850
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,803
I do.

851
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,054
You poor sucker.

852
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,390
You poor, washed-up papa's boy.

853
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:22,933
SHERMAN:
All right, let's not
get out of hand.

854
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,435
Please, don't get in the middle
of this, Mr. Sherman.

855
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,645
This is a family matter.

856
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,897
Don't talk to him like that.

857
00:43:28,982 --> 00:43:30,565
- Call me Henry.
- I prefer Mr. Sherman.

858
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,234
Call him Henry.

859
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,568
Why? I don't know him
that well.

860
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,945
You've known him
for ten years.

861
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,655
As your accountant,
Mr. Sherman, yes.

862
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,031
Where are you going to sleep?

863
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,658
I'm just going
to camp out upstairs.

864
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,159
We brought
our sleeping bag...

865
00:43:41,244 --> 00:43:42,119
Uzi!

866
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,495
ARI:
We don't mind, Dad.

867
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,538
We like him.

868
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,580
UZl:
Who, Pappy?

869
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:46,581
"Pappy"?

870
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,417
He can sleep in
the room above us.

871
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,043
Ari, it's not your decision.

872
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:51,336
Nor is it yours.

873
00:43:51,421 --> 00:43:53,130
Well, he's already up there.

874
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,259
What?!

875
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,427
I think he's asleep

876
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,637
because of the medication
he's on

877
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:04,474
but I... I guess you can
wake him up and throw him out...

878
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,728
if Mom says it's okay.

879
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,189
(monitor beeping)

880
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:16,862
Get out.

881
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:18,947
(grunting)
All right.

882
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,616
Let me just collect my things.

883
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,618
(groans)

884
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:26,288
Would you mind handing me
my cane, Richie?

885
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,081
Let me see,
where's my suitcases?

886
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,458
I'll get 'em.

887
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,667
Oh, thanks.

888
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,377
(grunting):
Oh!

889
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:33,587
Dad!

890
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,963
(groans)

891
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:35,964
Mom!

892
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:38,800
Grab me a Nembutal,
will you, son?

893
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:40,635
Are you okay?

894
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,554
What the fuck you care?

895
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,473
ETHELINE:
Oh, my goodness.

896
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,641
ROYAL:
Pagoda?

897
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:48,101
Call Doctor McClure.

898
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,354
(monitor flatlines)

899
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,730
(moans)

900
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,732
Take a breath and hold it.

901
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,109
(inhales)

902
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,069
Now cough.

903
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,529
(coughs weakly)

904
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:02,866
His condition is stable.

905
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,327
The attack was
just a side effect.

906
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,372
I recommend you push fluids

907
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,791
and continue the stomach cancer
medication.

908
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,834
(pager beeping)

909
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,007
CHAS:
Can we move him?

910
00:45:19,092 --> 00:45:20,926
Absolutely not.

911
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,095
For how long?

912
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,013
We'll have to wait and see.

913
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:26,848
Is he going to be all right?

914
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,892
That depends. Is he a fighter?

915
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,435
Yeah.

916
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,270
Then that's the best we've got.

917
00:45:35,817 --> 00:45:37,359
Pagoda's in possession

918
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,528
of a parcel containing
my will

919
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,906
and some instructions
for the funeral

920
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,033
including my epitaph,
for when the time comes.

921
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,368
Proofread it for me

922
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,745
before they carve it
on the headstone, okay?

923
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,455
Okay.

924
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,959
I never did stop loving you,
by the way.

925
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,252
Do you believe that?

926
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:56,878
Not really.

927
00:45:56,963 --> 00:45:59,423
You look terrific.

928
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,258
That dress is stunning.

929
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,343
Thanks.

He's your dad, too, Chas.

No. I don't. I love you.

Well, I don't know
what you think

952
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,262
you're going to get out of this

953
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:32,516
but believe me, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,980
I don't want to hurt you.

956
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,691
I know what you and the boys
have been through.

You're my brother,
and I love you.

Stop saying that!

959

What's that jackass doing?

960
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,761
I know you, asshole!

961
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,191
Did Eli send you that?

962
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:25,026
Mm-hmm.

963
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:28,029
He always sends me
his clippings.

964
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,865
What for?

965
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,118
I think he just likes
the encouragement.

966
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,494
He's done it for years.

967
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,871
He used to send me
his grades in college.

I don't know.

Are you ever coming home?

974
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,853
Maybe not.

975
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,355
You're joking.

976
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,442
No.

977
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,113
Well, I want to die.

978
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,870
Raleigh, please...

979
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,122
Have you met someone else?

980
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,209
I couldn't even begin
to think about

981
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,296
knowing how to answer
that question.

982
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:34,971
ROYAL:
I don't like the way
you're treating Raleigh.

983
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,060
What are you talking about?

984
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:41,519
You don't even know him.

985
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,480
Well, I've met him,
and I don't think he deserves...

986
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:46,608
Stay out of it.

987
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,694
You're two-timing him
with that bloodsucker

988
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,614
Eli Cash.

989
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,617
Now, that's just not right,
damn it.

990
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,786
You used to be a genius.

991
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,957
No, I didn't.

992
00:50:05,044 --> 00:50:07,837
Anyway, that's what
they used to say.

993
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:16,471
RALEIGH:
Richard, I know you're
terribly close to Margot

994
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,723
and probably understand
her better than anyone.

995
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,726
May I confide in you?

996
00:50:21,811 --> 00:50:24,854
(sighs)

997
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:28,525
Okay.

998
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:31,111
I believe
she's having an affair.

999
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,489
I'm utterly devastated.

1000
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,201
I... don't know
where else to turn.

1001
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:41,371
Will you advise me?

1002
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,497
I don't know.

1003
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,832
What do you want to do?

1004
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,041
I don't know.

1005
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,167
Perhaps, uh...

1006
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:47,669
Find the guy and get him?

1007
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,462
Well, no,
I thought we could...

1008
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,844
Who do you think it might be?

1009
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:59,264
I don't know at the moment.

1010
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,727
CHAS:
Let's look
at the actuals, okay?

1011
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:05,854
I agree with you
a hundred percent.

1012
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:08,022
That's why we have
marketing grids.

1013
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,691
ROYAL:
Hey.

1014
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,526
What do you say
we go down to Little Tokyo

1015
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:13,194
and get some fireworks?

1016
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,113
What do you need?

1017
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,282
Nothing.

1018
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:19,743
I see you got them,
uh, crunching numbers for you.

1019
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,371
Please don't
come in this room.

1020
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,873
Chas has those boys cooped up

1021
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,833
like a pair ofjackrabbits,
Etheline.

1022
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,376
He has his reasons.

1023
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,711
Oh, I know that

1024
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,047
but you can't raise boys
to be scared of life.

1025
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,384
You got to brew
some recklessness into them.

1026
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:40,054
I think that's terrible advice.

1027
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,058
No, you don't.

1028
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:46,478
ARI:
We take boxing
and self-defense classes.

1029
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,563
I'm not talking
about dance lessons.

1030
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,482
I'm talking about
putting a brick

1031
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:52,525
through the other guy's
windshield.

1032
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,863
I'm talking about taking it out
and chopping it up.

Yippee!

1064
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,486
He saved my life, you know.

1065
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:22,198
30 years ago, I was
knifed in a bazaar
in Calcutta.

1066
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,826
He carried me
to the hospital on his back.

1067
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,035
(chuckling)

1068
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,037
Who stabbed you?

1069
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:29,205
He did.

1070
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,999
Yeah, there was
a price on my head

1071
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,168
and he was a hired assassin.

1072
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:37,714
Stuck me right in the gut
with a shiv.

1073
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,007
(all yelling)

1074

1075
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,517
CHAS:
Hey!

1076
00:53:49,602 --> 00:53:51,102
What?

1077
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,022
Where have you been?

1078
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,774
Uh, we just stepped
out to get some air.

1079
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,360
What's that?

1080
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,528
Holy shit.

1081
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,030
That's not?

1082
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,365
What is that?

1083
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,826
Oh, no, no,
that's, uh, dog's blood.

1084
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,202
Come here.

1085
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,454
What?

1086
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,835
You stay away
from my children.

1087
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,211
Do you understand?

1088
00:54:17,296 --> 00:54:19,130
My God, I haven't been
in here for years.

1089
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:20,715
Hey! Are you listening to me!

1090
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,216
(yelling)
Yes, I am!

1091
00:54:22,301 --> 00:54:24,844
I think you've having
a nervous breakdown!

1092
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:26,512
I don't think you recovered

1093
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:27,847
from Rachael's death.

1094
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:29,474
I...

1095
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:33,478
(door slams)

1096
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:43,112
There you are.

1097
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,825
(chuckling)

1098
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,043
How are you feeling?

1099
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,836
I'm having a ball.

1100
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:02,215
Scrapping and yelling
and mixing it up.

1101
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,926
Loving every minute
with this damn crew.

1102
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,347
I want to thank you
for raising our children

1103
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,349
by the way.

1104
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,518
Okay.

1105
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,812
I'm not kidding.

1106
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,855
You always put them first,
didn't you?

1107
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,482
I tried to.

1108
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,527
Lately I feel like maybe
I didn't do such a great job.

1109
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,071
Goddamn it,
don't do that to yourself.

1110
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,990
I'm the one that failed them.

1111
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:29,033
Or, anyway,
it's nobody's fault.

1112
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:30,493
Plus, that - it doesn't...

1113
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,496
Why didn't you give
a damn about us, Royal?

1114
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,541
Why didn't you care?

1115
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,834
I don't know.

1116
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,628
I'm ashamed of myself.

1117
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:46,009
I'll tell you
one thing, though...

1118
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:49,053
you got more grit, fire and guts

1119
00:55:49,138 --> 00:55:52,056
than any woman
I have ever met.

1120
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:54,183
What... what are you
smiling about?

1121
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,643
Nothing.

1122
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:57,186
No, wha...
what's so funny?

1123
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:58,354
Nothing.

1124
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:00,857
It's these little
expressions of yours.

1125
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,026
I don't know
what you're talking about

1126
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,445
but I'll take it
as a compliment.

1127
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,824
You're true blue, Ethel.

1128
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:12,118
You really are.

1129
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,832
How's your love life?

1130
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,500
None of your business.

1131
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:22,086
(chuckling)

1132
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,592
(hoots)

1133
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,012
I'd like you to talk
to Royal about us

1134
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,346
if you don't mind.

1135
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:36,184
I don't think the timing's right
for that, Henry.

1136
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,685
Well, I'd agree

1137
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:40,855
if I thought he was really
going to die in six weeks

1138
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,940
but I don't.

1139
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,944
Well, I hope you're right.

1140
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:52,700
Actually, I don't believe
I'll join you tonight.

1141
00:56:52,785 --> 00:56:55,745
I'll call you in the morning.

1142
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,587
She said that?

1143
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,839
(chuckling)

1144
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,217
Great.

1145
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:12,929
Got the sucker on the ropes.

1146
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,640
(Royal chuckles softly)

1147
00:57:29,738 --> 00:57:32,031
Can I ask you something, Hank?

1148
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,788
Okay.

1149
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,333
Are you trying
to steal my woman?

1150
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,503
I beg your pardon?

1151
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,588
You heard me, Coltrane.

1152
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,507
Coltrane?

1153
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,259
What?

1154
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:53,094
Did you just call me "Coltrane"?

1155
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,345
No.

1156
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,471
You didn't?

1157
00:57:55,556 --> 00:57:57,765
No.

1158
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,892
Okay.

1159
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,936
(clears throat)

1160
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,646
But if I did...

1161
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:08,192
you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it, would you?

1162
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,944
You don't think so?

1163
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,445
No, I don't.

1164
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,697
Listen, Royal

1165
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,282
if you think
you can march in here...

1166
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:15,658
You want to talk some jive?

1167
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,119
I'll talk some jive.

1168
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:19,787
I'll talk some jive
like you've never heard.

1169
00:58:19,872 --> 00:58:21,164
- Oh, yeah?
- Right on!

1170
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:22,707
- Sit down.
- What?!

1171
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:23,708
Wh-what did you say?

1172
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:24,792
I said sit down,
goddamn it!

1173
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:26,586
Oh, I heard you!
I want you out of my house!

1174
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,753
This is not your house!

1175
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,130
I want your raggedy ass out!

1176
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,423
Don't talk semantics with me.

1177
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,424
Oh, this is not your...

1178
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,259
What's going on here?

1179
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,303
Nothing.

1180
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,184
Mmm.

1181
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:52,612
(whirring and pumping)

1182
00:58:56,575 --> 00:58:58,993
(no audio)

1183
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:02,163
Hello, I'm calling in regards
to a Dr. McClure - yes -

1184
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,956
at Colby General.

1185
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:06,500
The name of the patient
is Royal Tenenbaum.

1186
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:08,586
Hmm...

1187
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:12,715
Is that a Tic-Tac?

1188
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:17,011
(foreboding organ music plays)

1189
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,429
(knock on door)

1190
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:22,350
(recorded sitar music playing)

1191
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,186
How much is he paying you?

1192
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,190
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1193
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,859
Well, I grew up with the
Tenenbaum family, you know.

1194
00:59:31,944 --> 00:59:32,944
Right.

1195
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:34,111
Across the street.

1196
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:35,363
Mm-hmm.

1197
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:37,531
They've fallen on hard times
now, haven't they?

1198
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,575
I can't say no.

1199
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,244
This is bullshit.

1200
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,620
Change it, huh?

1201
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,375
What did you do to your hand?

1202
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:50,294
Uh, nothing.

1203
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:54,548
ROYAL:
Can we get somebody over here

1204
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,676
to kill these mice for us?

1205
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,719
No. They belong to Chas.

1206
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:01,430
Or anyway, he invented them.

1207
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,933
Well, get him to stick them
in a fucking cage

1208
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,352
or something.

1209
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,897
Etheline... mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

1210
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,441
What's cooking, Pops?

1211
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,735
You'll see.

1212
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,403
Now, your previous novel...

1213
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,821
Yes. Wildcat.

1214
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:17,905
Right.

1215
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,157
Not a success.

1216
01:00:20,242 --> 01:00:21,867
Why?

1217
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:30,668
Well, Wildcat was written
in a kind of obsolete

1218
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,712
vernacular...

1219
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,134
(whispers):
Wildcat...

1220
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:40,845
Wild... cat...

1221
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,766
(quietly imitates gunshots)

1222
01:00:45,851 --> 01:00:47,810
Wildcat...

1223
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,980
I'm going to go.

1224
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,274
I'm taking this off
and I'm going.

1225
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,650
Stepping out.

1226
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:57,445
What the hell
kind of way to act is that?

1227
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:58,821
ELI:
Open the door.

1228
01:00:58,905 --> 01:00:59,947
He's on drugs.

1229
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:03,326
I'll be right back.

1230
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:06,620
James Bradley...

1231
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,539
Hold on a minute, please.

1232
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,749
What's going on?

1233
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:12,376
Pagoda has something to say.

1234
01:01:16,965 --> 01:01:19,508
He has a cancer.

1235
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,844
No, he doesn't.

1236
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:23,888
I know what stomach cancer
looks like.

1237
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:25,556
I've seen it.

1238
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,975
And you don't eat

1239
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:31,520
three cheeseburgers a day
with French fries if you got it.

1240
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:32,855
The pain is excruciating.

1241
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,857
How would you know?

1242
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,901
My wife had it.

1243
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:41,238
Not only is there
no Dr. McClure at Colby General

1244
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,324
there is no Colby General.

1245
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,951
It closed in 1974.

1246
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,536
Aw, shit, man.

1247
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:49,622
Oh, shit, man.

1248
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,418
(Chas grunts)

1249
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:58,547
(dialing rotary phone)

1250
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:01,675
Yes, can you send a taxi

1251
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,427
to 111 Archer Avenue
right away, please?

1252
01:02:03,512 --> 01:02:04,428
Thank you.

1253
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:05,596
(slams receiver)

1254
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:16,023
I guess we're back out
on the street, huh, pal?

1255
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:18,359
Were you part of this,
Pagoda?

1256
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,944
Of course he was.

1257
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,445
No, well, yeah, he was

1258
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,823
but, I mean,
he wasn't that involved.

1259
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:26,700
Where'd you get all
these medical supplies?

1260
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,245
A guy at St. Pete's
owed me a favor.

1261
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:33,040
I did some malpractice work
for him.

1262
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,960
I do have
high blood pressure, though.

1263
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:42,049
Look, I know I'm going to be
the bad guy on this one.

1264
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:45,469
But I just want to say,
the last six days have been

1265
01:02:45,554 --> 01:02:48,389
the best six days
of probably my whole life.

1266
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:50,766
NARRATOR:
Immediately after
making this statement

1267
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:53,394
Royal realized
that it was true.

1268
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:01,902
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

1269
01:03:01,987 --> 01:03:05,156
What was the point?

1270
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,408
I thought I could win you back.

1271
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,412
And then I thought I could
get rid of Henry...

1272
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:14,123
and at least keep
the status quo.

1273
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,791
But we hadn't spoken
in seven years.

1274
01:03:15,876 --> 01:03:17,168
I know.

1275
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,838
Plus, uh...

1276
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,257
I was broke.

1277
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:27,052
And I got kicked out
of my hotel.

1278
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:29,930
You're a bastard.

1279
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,641
Good-bye, Royal.

1280
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:48,157
Take it easy
on those boys, Chassie.

1281
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,243
I don't want this
to happen to you.

1282
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,339
You know, Richie, this illness,
this closeness to death

1283
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,341
has had a profound effect
on me.

1284
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:08,385
I-I feel like a different
person, I really do.

1285
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:13,057
Dad, you were never dying.

1286
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:17,228
But I'm going to live.

1287
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,199
He's not your father.

1288
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:33,160
Neither are you.

1289
01:04:53,139 --> 01:04:55,140
(taxi engine idling)

1290
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:00,437
(dropping bags)

1291
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,486
You son of a bitch!

1292
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,863
God... damn...

1293
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,994
That's the last time you put
a knife in me, hear me?

1294
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,875
(groans)

1295
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,757
The 375th Street Y, please.

1296
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,469
(grunts)

1297
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,275
Everyone's against me.

1298
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,277
It's your fault, man.

1299
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:52,031
Yeah, I know, but damn it,
I want this family to love me.

1300
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,240
How much money you got?

1301
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:54,575
I don't have.

1302
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:56,368
What, you're broke?

1303
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:58,829
You got to be kidding me.

1304
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,040
How are we going to pay
for this room?

1305
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,295
All right,
we'll think of something.

1306
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,798
Ow.

1307
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:22,019

(sighing)

1309
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:31,779
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

1310
01:06:31,863 --> 01:06:34,448
I didn't know you ever were.

1311
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,116
Let's not make this
any more difficult

1312
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:37,951
than it already is.

1313
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,748
Okay.

1314
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,542
Okay, what?

1315
01:06:45,627 --> 01:06:49,546
Okay, I'm not in love
with you, either.

1316
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:53,300
Yes, I know;
you're in love with Richie

1317
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:55,678
which is sick and gross.

1318
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:03,227
Do you send my mother
your clippings...

1319
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:05,562
and your grades from college?

1320
01:07:08,066 --> 01:07:11,610
Please stop belittling me.

1321
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,161
You never gave me
the time of day

1322
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,539
till I started getting
good reviews.

1323
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,583
Your reviews aren't that good.

1324
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:29,002
But the sales are.

(shutter clicks)

1326
01:07:36,094 --> 01:07:40,264
Gentlemen... how much
do you already know?

1327
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:43,350
Very little, I'm afraid.

1328
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:45,352
Would you like
to examine the report?

1329
01:07:45,437 --> 01:07:47,855
Yes.

1397
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:08,281
He'll probably sleep
for several hours

1398
01:12:08,366 --> 01:12:10,534
and then I'll come back
to check on him.

1400

Don't press him right now.

1406
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,302
I wrote a suicide note.

01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:30,846
You did?

1408
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,139
Yeah.

1409
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:35,225
Right after I regained
consciousness.

1410
01:12:37,103 --> 01:12:38,895

No.

1412
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:43,316
Can you paraphrase it for us?

1413
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,902
I don't think so.

1414
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:48,030
Is it dark?

1415
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,322
Of course it's dark.

1416
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,866
It's a suicide note.

1417
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,325
All right, that's enough.

1418

I'm sorry.

1426
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,701

01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,185
You don't smoke.

1435
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,312
I know that.

1436

(sighs)

1437
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,284
And a light.

1438
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:25,961
Au revoir.

1439
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:39,015

01:15:14,135 --> 01:15:16,094
Oh, Henry.

1446
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,312
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

1447

NURSE:
Your name?

1448
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,689
Royal Tenenbaum.

1449
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:30,859
I'm afraid visiting hours
are over, sir.

1450
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,737
Wh-Wh-What does it say there -
they don't want me?

1451
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:34,946
I-I'm sorry.

1452
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,323
I have to refer you
to Dr. Burrows.

1453
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,700
He'll be in
tomorrow afternoon.

(mumbles)

1455
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,341
We could shimmy up
that gutter

1456
01:15:54,425 --> 01:15:56,343
jump over that window ledge

1457
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,512
and then, uh, pry open
that ventilator shaft.

1458
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:01,348
There he is.

1459
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,766
Richie!

1460
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:06,436
Richie.

1461
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:11,107
Where's he going?

1462
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:14,778
Richie!

1463
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:26,706
Well, I have to say

1464
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,709
he didn't look half bad
for a suicide.

1465
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:33,046
Attempted, anyway.

1466
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,631

I wanted to prove

I could pay my dues,

I don't think it was Ramses.

1635
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,916
I believe it was Tootinkamen.

1636
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,083
Tutankhamen.

1637
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:32,335
Tutankhamen?

1638
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:33,586
Yes. Tutankhamen.

1639
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:35,546
(knock at door)

1640
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:38,341
("Rock the Casbah"
playing in background)

1641
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:40,635
Yes?

1642
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,016
Hey, Richie.

1643
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,859
We want to take you
to get some help.

1644
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,780
Is it just you guys?

1645
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:03,032
ROYAL:
Would you

1646
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,200
excuse us, please?

1647
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,788
Okay.

1648
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,129
(turns music off)

1649
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:19,257
Are we still friends?

1650
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,176
What do you mean?

1651
01:26:22,261 --> 01:26:23,344
Are we?

1652
01:26:23,428 --> 01:26:24,512
Of course.

1653
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,556
How can you even ask me that?

1654
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:27,974
Well, it doesn't matter.

1655
01:26:28,058 --> 01:26:29,058
It doesn't matter?

1656
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:30,309
It does matter.

1657
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:32,854
I heard about you and Margot.

1658
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:44,532
I'm sorry.

1659
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:45,867
I don't know what to say.

1660
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,869
You don't have to say anything.

1661
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:52,498
I always wanted
to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

1662
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,084
Me, too.

1663
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,336
ELI:
Course it doesn't mean

1664
01:26:57,421 --> 01:27:00,256
what it used to though, does it?

1665
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,800
I wish you'd done this for me
when I was a kid.

1666
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:07,430
But you didn't have
a drug problem then.

1667
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:11,559
Yeah, but it would've
meant a lot to me.

1668
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,644
Anyway, I'm glad
you're here now.

1669
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:17,148
I recognize
that I have a problem...

1670
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:20,693
and I want to get better.

1671
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,822
I'll just grab my stuff.

1672
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,876
There he goes.

1673
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,085
What?!

1674
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,086
There he goes.

1675
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,463
Tucker!

1676
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,214
Skiddly, skiddly.

1677
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,800
(mumbles incoherently)

1678
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:49,221

1682
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:00,733
What would you like, Margot?

1683
01:28:00,817 --> 01:28:03,611
Nothing. I told you
I have to go in five minutes.

1684
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,696
Oh.

1685
01:28:06,865 --> 01:28:08,199
(quiet sigh)

1686
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,077
I'll have a butterscotch sundae,
I guess.

1687
01:28:17,042 --> 01:28:19,794
Your brother's all torn up
inside.

1688
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:23,089
Well, so am I, but I'm not going
to discuss it with you.

1689
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,717
Oh...

1690
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:28,678
Can't somebody be a shit
their whole life

1691
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,054
and try to repair the damage?

1692
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:33,599
I-I mean, I think people want
to hear that.

1693
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:34,600
Do they?

1694
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:35,601
Mmm.

1695
01:28:35,686 --> 01:28:37,436
You probably don't even know

1696
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:39,605
my middle name.

1697
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,611
That's a trick question.

1698
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:46,946
You don't have one.

1699
01:28:47,030 --> 01:28:48,280
Helen.

1700
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:51,450
That was my mother's name.

1701
01:28:51,535 --> 01:28:54,453
I know it was.

1702
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:10,928
Anybody interested
in grabbing a couple burgers

1703
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:13,055
and hitting the cemetery?

1704
01:29:21,648 --> 01:29:23,941
(solemn organ music plays)

1705

(Royal whistles)

1706
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,163
I got something for you, Ethel.

1707
01:29:37,247 --> 01:29:38,622
Actually, I made it.

1708
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:40,041
What's this?

1709
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,333
It's a divorce.

1710
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:43,169
From you?

1711
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:44,336
Yes.

1712
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:45,546
This is Sanchez.

1713
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,714
He's a notary public.

1714
01:29:46,798 --> 01:29:47,840
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

1715
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:49,133
You just sign here

1716
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:51,343
and initial here
and sign there.

1717
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:56,182
You own this building,
don't you, Henry?

1718
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:58,225
Hmm.

1719
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,853
It's magnificent.

1720
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,772
I used to be a homeowner myself

1721
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:05,232
until our son expropriated it
from me.

1722
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,526
I got to catch my bus.

1723
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:08,736
Thanks, Sanchez.

1724
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:10,029
You're welcome.

1725
01:30:10,113 --> 01:30:11,864
ETHELINE:
Are we divorced?

1726
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:13,074
Almost.

1727
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,367
Sanchez just has
to file the papers.

1728
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:16,869
I love you, Etheline.

1729
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:19,538
Congratulations
to both of you.

1730
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,499
I didn't think so much
of him at first.

1731
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,708
But now I get it.

1732
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:24,877
He's everything that I'm not.

1733
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,964
(chuckles)

1734
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:31,801
Take back Pagoda, will you?

1735
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,761
(bus drives off)

1736

(playing classical music)

1738
01:31:05,544 --> 01:31:06,877
Uh, slightly uneven.

1739
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,796
Looks okay.
You're just nervous.

1740
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,256
(knocking)

1741
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:11,799
Henry?

1742
01:31:11,883 --> 01:31:12,925
Hello, Richie.

1743
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:14,135
Hi.

1744
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:16,178
This is my son, Walter Sherman.

1745
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:19,014
Hi, Walter.
Nice to meet you.

1746
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,307
Nice to meet you.

1747
01:31:20,392 --> 01:31:21,559
Henry's your dad?

1748
01:31:21,643 --> 01:31:23,936
Yes.

1749
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,980
So you've been married before.

1750
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:28,858
Yes. I'm a widower.

1751
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:30,943
Oh, yeah.

1752
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:33,529
I forgot.

1753
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:38,826
You know, I'm a widower myself.

1754
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:44,623
I know you are, Chas.

1755
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:47,209
(plastic rattling
against teeth)

1756
01:31:47,294 --> 01:31:49,545
What are you chewing on?

1757
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:51,213
My nicotine inhaler.

1758
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:53,257
It's supposed to help me quit.

1759
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,843
Is it working?

1760
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:58,888
Not really.

1761
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:04,143
Well, of course,
I'm half Hebrew

1762
01:32:04,227 --> 01:32:06,687
but the children are
three-quarters Mick Catholic.

1763
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,981
So they were raised
in the church?

1764
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,983
I believe so.

1765
01:32:11,067 --> 01:32:12,860
I really don't know.

1766
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:14,987
(tires squealing)

1767
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:17,031
(engine roaring)

1768
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,872
Here I come.

1769
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:29,752
Boys!

1770
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:31,253
(scream and crash)

1771
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:33,047
What was that?

1772
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:36,467
Eli just crashed his car
into the front of the house.

1773
01:32:36,551 --> 01:32:37,885
Oh, my God.

1774
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:50,439
Where's my shoe?

1775
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,694
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

1776
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:57,029
They're okay, Chas.

1777
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:58,364
It's okay. They're safe.

1778
01:32:58,448 --> 01:32:59,823
They're safe.

1779
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:00,991
Dad, they ran over Buckley.

1780
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:01,992
What?

1781
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:03,702
Yeah, I think we lost Buckley.

1782
01:33:03,787 --> 01:33:04,954
He saved them.

1783
01:33:05,038 --> 01:33:06,080
Who?

1784
01:33:06,164 --> 01:33:08,165
Dad. He pulled them
out of the way.

1785
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:10,209
You did?

1786
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,087
Did I hit anyone?

1787
01:33:13,171 --> 01:33:16,131
Is everybody okay?

1788
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,599
Eli!

1789
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:26,850
What's going on?

1790
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,227
(mumbles)

1791
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,651
(yells)

1792
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:38,028
CHAS:
Eli!

1793
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:40,114
What?

1794
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,825
Hey, man.

1795
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:44,827
You should try this.
It's very tasty.

1796
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:52,751
(screaming)

1797
01:33:55,130 --> 01:34:00,676
(groaning)

1798
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:05,764
(screaming)

1799
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:07,224
ELI:
Tenenbaum!

1800
01:34:07,309 --> 01:34:09,476

01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:11,520
Chas?

1802
01:34:21,406 --> 01:34:23,449
(grunts)

1803
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,963
Did I hit the dog?

1804
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:40,049
Yeah.

1805
01:34:42,802 --> 01:34:44,803
Is he dead?

1806
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:47,014
Yeah.

1807
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:52,227
I need help.

1808
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:55,814
So do I.

1809
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,572
Go around to the other side.

1810
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:04,948
ROYAL:
You kids stay there.

1811
01:35:05,033 --> 01:35:06,116
We'll be right back.

1812
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:08,202
HENRY:
Yeah.

1813
01:35:09,996 --> 01:35:11,413
Can I say something
to you, Henry?

1814
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:12,623
Okay.

1815
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:14,291
I've always been considered
an asshole

1816
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:15,876
for about as long
as I can remember.

1817
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:17,294
That's just my style.

1818
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:18,379
But I'd really feel blue

1819
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:20,506
if I didn't think
you were going to forgive me.

1820
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:23,967
I don't think
you're an asshole, Royal.

1821
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:26,845
I just think you're kind
of a son of a bitch.

1822
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,264
Well, I really
appreciate that.

1823
01:35:29,349 --> 01:35:31,517
(sirens approaching)

1824
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:33,560
Could you let us
in your backyard, ma'am?

1825
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:35,562
We've got a couple boys
back there.

1826
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,564
I think you may
have broken an ankle.

1827
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:40,359
Well, that's not terribly
serious, is it?

1828
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,736
Do you have an alternate?

1829
01:35:42,821 --> 01:35:43,987
No.

1830
01:35:44,072 --> 01:35:45,614
Ready?

1831
01:35:45,698 --> 01:35:47,574
Are there priests on call?

1832
01:35:47,659 --> 01:35:49,743
Why don't you bring
the car around, Anwar.

1833
01:35:49,828 --> 01:35:53,080
At which point, I apparently
lost control of the vehicle

1834
01:35:53,164 --> 01:35:55,833
smashed it into the house,
and killed that poor dog.

1835
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:57,543
You're Eli Cash.

1836
01:35:57,627 --> 01:35:59,211
Yes indeed, I am.

1837
01:35:59,295 --> 01:36:00,712
I love your work.

1838
01:36:00,797 --> 01:36:02,548
Oh, how sweet of you
to say.

1839
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,383
DISPATCHER (on radio)...
78-35, Code Six.

1840
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:06,385
105 North Sandler...

1841
01:36:06,469 --> 01:36:08,720
ROYAL:
I think he's part mutt.

1842
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:12,307
What kind of papers
do you have for him?

1843
01:36:12,392 --> 01:36:14,518
Spark Plug, sit, sit.

1844
01:36:14,602 --> 01:36:17,229
Good boy.

1845
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:22,776
Put this on.

1846
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,778
(laughs)

1847
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:26,029
What's so funny, Dudley?

1848
01:36:26,114 --> 01:36:28,031
You look great.

1849
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:29,616
(laughing)

1850
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,243
DUSTY:
Can you see out of it?

1851
01:36:31,327 --> 01:36:32,411
Not really.

1852
01:36:32,495 --> 01:36:34,580
Uh-huh. Minor corneal damage.

1853
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,915
Page me if it spreads
to the other eye.

1854
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,250
(sirens approaching)

1855
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:39,418
Who do I make it out to?

1856
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:41,253
Alex? Okay.

1857
01:36:41,337 --> 01:36:42,754
(fire engine horn blasting)

1858
01:36:42,839 --> 01:36:45,174
But these aren't
structure-bearing elements, Dad.

1859
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:46,592
It doesn't matter.

1860
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:48,552
It's still best
to file another force majeure

1861
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:49,928
and recoup the deductible.

1862
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:51,930
(horn blasting)

1863
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:55,058
(background radio
communication)

1864
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,311
You boys come up here with me.

1865
01:36:57,395 --> 01:36:59,396
But Buckley's
still under there.

1866
01:36:59,481 --> 01:37:04,359
I know, but there's nothing
we can do for him at the moment.

1867
01:37:04,444 --> 01:37:06,487
(quietly):
Come on.

1868
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,326
I got you a new dog
for the boys.

1869
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,369
I just bought him.

1870
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:16,622
You did?

1871
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:18,874
Sorry I let you down, Chas.

1872
01:37:18,958 --> 01:37:20,959
All of you.

1873
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:23,629
I been trying
to make it up to you.

1874
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:32,054
What's his name?

1875
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:34,139
Spark Plug.

1876
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,936
Thank you.

1877
01:37:39,020 --> 01:37:41,063
You're welcome.

1878
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:45,692
I've had a rough year, Dad.

1879
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:48,070
I know you have, Chassie.

1880
01:37:55,161 --> 01:37:57,204
Hey.

1881
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:11,385
(fluttering)

1882
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:12,844
(soft chirping)

1883
01:38:17,809 --> 01:38:19,059
RICHIE:
See, now he has

1884
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:21,019
more white feathers
on his neck.

1885
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,275
I wonder
what happened to him?

1886
01:38:26,359 --> 01:38:27,859
I don't know.

1887
01:38:27,944 --> 01:38:30,946
Sometimes if a person
has a traumatic experience

1888
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,573
their hair turns white.

1889
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,451
Well, I'm sure
he'll get over it.

1890
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:56,096
This was one
of my first hiding places.

1891
01:38:59,642 --> 01:39:01,893
How old do you think those are?

1892
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,731
I'd say about ten years.

1893
01:39:08,192 --> 01:39:10,152
Come here.

1894
01:39:12,614 --> 01:39:14,656
(soft chirping)

1895
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,220
(gentle melody plays
on acoustic guitar)

1896
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:47,356
NARRATOR:
Royal dug a hole for Buckley
behind the garden shed

1897
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,566
and buried him
in a canvas duffel bag.

1898
01:39:49,651 --> 01:39:50,942
All right, boys.

1899
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:52,152
Say a prayer.

1900
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,779
Dear Heavenly Father...

1901
01:39:53,863 --> 01:39:55,030
I do.

1902
01:39:55,114 --> 01:39:57,783
Etheline and Henry were married

1903
01:39:57,867 --> 01:40:00,452
48 hours later
in judge's chambers.

1904
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:06,458
Margot's new play was produced
at the Cavendish Theatre.

1905
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:09,795
This is my adopted daughter,
Elaine Levinson.

1906
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,297
(chuckling)

1907
01:40:12,382 --> 01:40:16,718
It ran for just under two weeks
and received mixed reviews.

1908
01:40:16,803 --> 01:40:20,013
Yes, can the boy tell time?

1909
01:40:20,098 --> 01:40:21,640
Oh, my Lord, no.

1910
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:23,266
No. No.

1911
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:25,435
Raleigh and Dudley
went on a lecture tour

1912
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:26,561
to 11 universities

1913
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:28,397
in the promotion
of their new book.

1914
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:32,401
(audience applause)

1915
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:34,695
Eli checked himself into
a rehabilitation hospital

1916
01:40:34,779 --> 01:40:36,363
in North Dakota.

1917
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:40,826
Oh, hey, this is my sponsor,
Runs With Two Horses.

1918
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,662
Wind's blowing up
a gale today.

1919
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:45,497
This is the grip
that Rod Laver used.

1920
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:46,998
Are you familiar with Laver?

1921
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,792
Richie started a program

1922
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:52,671
teaching competitive tennis
to eight-to-12 year olds

1923
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,756
at the 375th Street Y.

1924
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:57,426
Game. Change sides.

1925
01:41:01,431 --> 01:41:03,598
(hooting, hollering,
and laughing)

1926
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:10,772
Royal had a heart attack
at the age of 68.

1927
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,653
Chas rode with him
in the ambulance

1928
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:19,614
and was the only witness
to his father's death.

1929
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:25,454
In his will, he stipulated

1930
01:41:25,538 --> 01:41:28,623
that his funeral
take place at dusk.

1931
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:44,264
(music ends)

1932
01:42:01,699 --> 01:42:05,285
Among the few possessions
he left to his heirs

1933
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:08,205
was a set
of Encyclopedia Britannica

1934
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:11,374
in storage
at the Lindbergh Palace Hotel

1935
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:14,419
under the names
Ari and Uzi Tenenbaum.

1936
01:42:14,504 --> 01:42:17,172
No one spoke at the funeral

1937
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:21,927
and Father Petersen's leg
had not yet mended...

1938
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:23,845
but it was agreed among them

1939
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:26,389
that Royal
would have found the event

1940
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,141
to be most satisfactory.

1941
01:42:31,521 --> 01:42:40,529
Fire!
