Shh.

00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:54,652
<i>Royal Tenenbaum bought</i>
<i>the house on Archer Avenue</i>

3
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:56,486
<i>in the winter of his 35th year.</i>

4
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,685
<i>Over the next decade</i>

5
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,290
<i>he and his wife</i>
<i>had three children</i>

6
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,198
<i>and then they separated.</i>

7
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,135
Are you
getting divorced?

8
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:19,203
At the moment, no...
but... it doesn't look good.

9
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,147
Do you still love us?

10
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,479
Of course I do.

11
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,075
Do you still love Mom?

12
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,018
Yes, very much, but your
mother's asked me to leave

13
00:01:26,054 --> 00:01:27,783
and I must respect
her position on the matter.

14
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:29,016
Is it our fault?

15
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,251
No.

16
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,258
No.

17
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,522
Obviously,
we made certain sacrifices

18
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:36,121
as a result of having children,
but, uh...

19
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:37,131
no, Lord, no.

20
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,395
Then why'd she ask you to leave?

21
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:42,835
I don't really know anymore.

22
00:01:45,006 --> 00:01:48,601
Maybe, uh, I wasn't as true
to her as I could've been.

23
00:01:48,643 --> 00:01:49,473
Well, she said...

24
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,499
Let's just drop it

25
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:51,807
shall we, uh, Chassie?

26
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:54,280
<i>They were never</i>

27

28

<i>breeding Dalmatian mice</i>

48

<i>which he sold to a pet shop</i>
<i>in Little Tokio.</i>

49
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,914
<i>He started buying real estate</i>
<i>in his early teens</i>

50
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:04,440
<i>and seemed to have an almost</i>

<i>of international finance.</i>

52
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:10,981

You're on my team.

57

This is my adopted daughter
Margot Tenenbaum.

63
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:51,995
<i>She was a playwright, and won</i>

68

Hi, Eli.

69
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,486
You said <i>I</i> could run away, too.

70
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:17,013
No, I didn't, and don't
tell anyone you saw us.

71
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,992
<i>They shared a sleeping bag</i>

79
00:04:45,286 --> 00:04:47,254
<i>He turned pro at 17</i>

80

<i>three years in a row.</i>

81

Mmm... didn't seem
believable to me.

102

He has permission to sleep over.

105

Well, did you at least think

106
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,389
the characters
were well-developed?

107
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,397
What characters?

108
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,228
This is a bunch
of little kids, uh

00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:14,209
You think I'm especially
<i>not</i> a genius?

160
00:10:14,248 --> 00:10:16,773
I know w...

161
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,251
You didn't even have
to think about it, did you?

162
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,778
Well, I just don't use
that word lightly.

163
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:28,560
I have to go, Eli.

164

Margot?

165
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,467
May I come in, please?

166
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:50,773
How are you, my darling?

167

No, thank you.

going to go?

188
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,719
Done.

189
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,190
Good.

190
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:15,293
Very good.

191
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:18,966
My goodness.

192
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:21,804
How interesting. How bizarre.

Dudley suffers

combining symptoms
of amnesia, dyslexia

195

and color blindness.

196
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,816
He has a highly acute
sense of hearing.

I'm afraid you are.

<i>Over the last six months</i>

We left Buckley.

224
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:07,438
It doesn't matter.

233
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,478
It would probably be
advantageous

234
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:43,506
for your marital status

235
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,018
to be legally established

What do you mean?

238
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,690
I mean for tax purposes.

239
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,691
But I thought...

240
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:53,522
- Etheline...
- Yes?

241
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,221
Will you marry me?

00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,864
I love you, uh...

244
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,868
Did you already know that?

245
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,666
No, I didn't.

246
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,900
<i>Since her separation</i>
<i>from her husband</i>

247
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,567
<i>she had had many suitors...</i>

248

<i>... but had not considered</i>
<i>a single one until this moment.</i>

249

This isn't really
a tax issue, is it?

250
00:15:22,423 --> 00:15:25,586
That's true, uh...

251
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:28,459
I don't know why
I put it that way.

252
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:33,289
Let me think about it, Henry.

253
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,431
Hello. Please tell Mr. Royal
this is the Pagoda.

254
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:47,041
Lobby.

255
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,241
Thank you, Dusty.

256
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,944
You're welcome.

257
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,449
Good morning, Jerry.

258
00:15:55,823 --> 00:15:59,759
Oh, there's a call for you,
Mr. Tenenbaum.

259
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,124
Who is it, Frederick?

260
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:02,992
A Mr. Pagoda.

261
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:08,834
What do you got?

262
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,804
The black man asked her
to be his wife.

263
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,767
No shit?

264
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,572
What did Ethel say?

265
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:20,011
She think about it.

266
00:16:22,382 --> 00:16:25,010
I don't like the sound of this
one damn bit, Pagoda.

267
00:16:25,052 --> 00:16:28,078
I mean... Lord knows

268
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:31,852
I've had my share
of infidelities

269
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:34,326
but she's still my wife.

270
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:39,091
And no damn two-bit,
chartered accountant

271
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,532
is going to change that.

272
00:16:49,643 --> 00:16:51,474
Hi.

273
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:59,314
Hey, Pagoda,
give us a hand, huh?

274
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,758
Chas?

275
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,264
What's going on?

276
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,863
We got locked out
of our apartment.

277
00:17:19,907 --> 00:17:22,239
Did you call a locksmith?

278
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,809
Well, I don't understand.

279
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,212
Did you pack your bags
before you got locked out

280
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,374
or how did you...?

281
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,907
It's not safe over there.

282
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:35,046
Excuse me for a moment.

283
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,122
What are you talking about?

284
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,148
The apartment.

285
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,058
I have to get
some new sprinklers

286
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,359
and a backup
security system installed.

287
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:47,561
But there are
no sprinklers here, either.

288
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:50,661
Well, we might have
to do something about that, too.

289
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,803
Okay.

290
00:17:56,843 --> 00:17:58,936
Isn't this fun, huh?

291
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:00,139
Isn't this great?

292
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,977
Feels like we're camping.

293
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,812
When are we going home?

294
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:05,818
Hey, look at this.

295
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,281
Pretty cool, huh?

296
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:11,382
# Who am I supposed to be? #

297
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:12,687
Who put that in here?

298
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:15,559
#... Look at me #

299
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,457
# What am I supposed to be? #

300
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,092
Okay.

301
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:24,968
Well, I will see you boys
in the morning.

302
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:26,165
- Good night.
- Good night.

303
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:27,332
Good night.

304
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:29,365
# Look at me #

305
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,740
You know what?

306
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,337
I think I'm going
to sleep in here with you.

307
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,608
That way...

308
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,049
...we can all be together.

309
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,212
# Oh, my love #

310
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,936
What kind of side effects
can be expected?

311
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,904
Well, there are
a number of possibilities.

312
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:00,839
Severe nausea and dizziness
are standard.

313
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:03,775
A certain percentage of patients
may also experience seizure.

314
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,643
You mean, like flopping around
on the floor and everything?

315
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,477
In some cases.

316
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:14,819
You have a visitor, my darling.

317
00:19:14,855 --> 00:19:16,823
Who is it?

318
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,384
It's me, sweetie.

319
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,038
Raleigh says you've been
spending six hours a day

320
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,042
locked in here,
watching television

321
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,441
and soaking in the tub.

322
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,105
I doubt that.

323
00:19:40,147 --> 00:19:42,172
I don't think that's
very healthy, do you?

324
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,978
Nor do I think
it's very intelligent

325
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,781
to keep an electrical gadget
on the edge of the bathtub.

326
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,617
I tie it to the radiator.

327
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,920
Well, it can't be very good
for your eyes, anyway.

328
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:06,267
Chas came home.

329
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,706
What do you mean?

330
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:11,108
He and Ari and Uzi
are going to stay

331
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,442
with me for a little while.

332
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,143
Why are they allowed
to do that?

333
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,811
I don't know exactly

334
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:21,719
but I think he's been
very depressed.

335
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,347
So am I.

336
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,722
So are you, what?

337
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,784
But why is <i>this</i> necessary?

338
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:31,059
'Cause I'm in a rut,
and I need a change.

339
00:20:31,098 --> 00:20:33,259
Hang on.

340
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,070
Taxi!

341
00:20:43,944 --> 00:20:46,071
That cab has a dent in it.

342
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,875
You don't love me anymore,
do you?

343
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,011
I do, kind of.

344
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:55,919
I can't explain it right now.

345
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:59,153
Another dent here,
and another dent here.

346
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:10,200
I'll call you, okay?

347
00:21:30,524 --> 00:21:32,992
Hello.

348
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,323
Hello?

349
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:41,261
Hello, beautiful.

350
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,104
Got a minute?

351
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,414
What are you doing here?

352
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:57,746
Uh, I need a favor.

353
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,412
I want to spend some time
with you and the children.

354
00:22:00,453 --> 00:22:02,318
Are you crazy?

355
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:03,652
Well, wait a minute, damn it!

356
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,816
Stop following me.

357
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:06,155
Well, I want my family back.

358
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,660
Well, you can't have it.

359
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:10,754
I'm sorry for you,
but it's too late.

360
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,094
Well, listen...

361
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:14,157
Baby, I'm dying.

362
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:19,033
Yeah, I'm- I'm sick as a dog.

363
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,098
I'll be dead in six weeks.

364
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,474
I'm dying.

365
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:33,252
What are you talking about?

366
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,454
What's happening?

367
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,398
Oh, I'm sorry.

368
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:51,760
I didn't know.

369
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,078
Well, what'd they say?

370
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:01,080
What is the prognosis?

371
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:02,809
Take it easy, Ethel.

372
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,147
Now, hold-hold on, baby,
hold on.

373
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:08,154
Hold on, okay?

374
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,920
Ethel, hold on, hold on.

375
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,221
Where is the doctor?

376
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:15,489
Don't... Well, just...

377
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:16,756
W- Wait a second now.

378
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,093
Wait a second.

379
00:23:18,131 --> 00:23:22,693
Okay, uh, listen,
I'm not dying...

380
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,431
but I need some time.

381
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:26,701
A month or so, okay?

382
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,504
I want us... I want us to-to...

383
00:23:29,542 --> 00:23:31,510
What's wrong with you?!

384
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,977
Damn!

385
00:23:33,013 --> 00:23:34,071
Ethel.

386
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:35,081
Are you crazy?!

387
00:23:35,115 --> 00:23:36,639
Ethel, baby...

388
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:39,880
I <i>am</i> dying.

389
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,389
Are you or aren't you?

390
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:57,130
What? Dying?

391
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,331
Yeah.

392
00:24:02,242 --> 00:24:03,766
Have you told your children?

393
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,243
More or less.

394
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,041
And are they all right?

395
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,672
It's hard to say.

396
00:24:08,715 --> 00:24:10,114
Who's your father?

397
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,947
His name is Royal Tenenbaum.

398
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,748
You told us he was already dead.

399
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,584
Yeah, well, now
he's really dying.

400
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,611
- Ready.
- Print it.

401
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,123
I am very sorry, Margo.

402
00:24:18,158 --> 00:24:19,147
That's okay.

403
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:21,092
We're not actually related,
anyway.

404
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:23,184
True.

405
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:26,365
I'd like to send a response,
please.

406
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:27,957
Yes, sir, go ahead.

407
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:29,835
Dear Mom:

408
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,530
I received your message.

409
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:34,039
I'm coming home
as soon as possible.

410
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:35,735
Who do I see about that?

411
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:39,734
<i>The ship's porter arranged for</i>
<i>Richie to disembark at Halifax</i>

412
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:42,009
<i>and transfer</i>
<i>to a third-class state room</i>

413
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,481
<i>on board the</i> Queen Helena

414

<i>the Eastern seaboard.</i>

415
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:49,387
<i>His trunks would not arrive</i>
<i>for another 11 days.</i>

416
00:24:49,422 --> 00:24:51,356
Hey, Baumer.

417
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:53,325
Do you mind if we get
a picture with you?

418
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,588
Not at all.

419
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:59,724
<i>He had made a request</i>
<i>for his usual escort</i>

420
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,961
<i>the one from his days</i>
<i>on the circuit</i>

421
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:05,233
<i>to meet him at the pier</i>
<i>by way of the Green Line bus.</i>

422
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,704
Hi.

423
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:12,073
<i>As always, she was late.</i>

424
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:48,344
# I've been out walking #

425
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:55,116
# I don't do too much talking
these days #

426
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:59,990
# These days #

427
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,688
# These days I seem
to think a lot #

428
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:07,530
# About the things
that I forgot to do... #

429
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:13,199
# And other times, I... #

430
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,002
Stand up straight.

431
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:17,532
Let me get a look at you.

432
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,114
What's so funny?

433
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:28,617
Well it's nice to see you, too.

434
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,598
<i>That night, Etheline found</i>
<i>all of her children</i>

435
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,498
<i>living together under</i>
<i>the same roof</i>

436
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:44,162
<i>for the first time in 17 years.</i>

437
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:45,535
Where's your dad?

438
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,040
<i>The next morning,</i>
<i>Richie woke at dawn.</i>

439
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:59,574
<i>He had decided birds should not</i>
<i>be kept in cages</i>

440
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,214
<i>fed Mordecai three sardines,</i>
<i>and set him free.</i>

441
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,322
I've missed the hell out of you,
my darlings.

442
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:47,663
Well, you know that, though,
don't you?

443
00:27:48,968 --> 00:27:50,629
I hear you're dying.

444
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,865
So they tell me.

445
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:54,396
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,738
Well, I've had a good run.

447
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,006
You don't look so sick, Dad.

448
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,774
Thank you.

449
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:02,337
What have you got?

450
00:28:02,382 --> 00:28:04,316
I've got a pretty bad case
of cancer.

451
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,682
How long you going to last?

452
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,017
Not long.

453
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:10,750
A month, a year?

454
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,020
About six weeks.

455
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,219
Let me get to the point.

456
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,660
The three of you and your mother
are all I've got

457
00:28:16,696 --> 00:28:18,357
and I love you
more than anything.

458
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:20,898
Chas, let me

459
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:22,868
finish here.

460
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:26,702
Now, I've got six weeks
to set things right with you

461
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,138
and I aim to do it.

462
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:30,039
Will you give me a chance?

463
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,134
No.

464
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,007
You speak

465
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,137
for everyone?

466
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,476
I speak for myself.

467
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:36,277
Well, you've
made your views known.

468
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:38,614
Let somebody else do some of
the talking now.

469
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:40,744
What do you propose to do?

470
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,755
I can't say, really.

471
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:46,350
Um, make up for lost time,
I suppose.

472
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:47,825
First thing I want to do is

473
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,624
take you out to see
your grandmother, at some point.

474
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:53,359
I haven't been out there
since I was six.

475
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,230
I haven't been out there at all.

476
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,462
I was never invited.

477
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:59,096
Well, she wasn't
your real grandmother

478
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:03,040
and I never knew how much
interest you had, uh, sweetie.

479
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:04,976
Anyway, you're invited now.

480
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,103
Thanks.

481
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,136
You know, Rachael's buried

482
00:29:08,181 --> 00:29:09,170
out there, too.

483
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,443
Who?

484
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,383
My wife.

485
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,680
Oh, that's right, isn't it?

486
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,847
Well, we'll have to swing
by her grave, too.

487
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,356
Uh, I'll be right back.

488
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,455
Chas.

489
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,589
Chas.

490
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:32,496
Can I see my grandsons?

491
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,096
Why?

492
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,371
Because I finally want
to meet them.

493
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:40,608
Don't give me that guff.

494
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,817
I think we'll pass.

495
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:52,688
Pagoda...

496
00:29:52,725 --> 00:29:55,694
where's my Havelina?

497
00:29:57,697 --> 00:29:59,722
I'll say good-night
to you now, children.

498
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:01,131
Dad.

499
00:30:05,071 --> 00:30:07,232
Thank you, my sweet boy.

500
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:12,904
I'll contact you
in the next 12 hours

501
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:14,537
with further instructions.

502
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,523
Look at that old

503
00:30:24,557 --> 00:30:27,287
grizzly bear.

504
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,488
Hello, Ethel.

505
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:30,826
Good evening, sir.

506
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:32,797
Hold the cab,
will you, driver?

507
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,390
Royal, this is Henry Sherman.

508
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:35,628
Hey, lay it on me, man.

509
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:36,692
How do you do?

510
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:38,761
Not too well. I'm dying.

511
00:30:40,807 --> 00:30:42,570
How's Richie?

512
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,303
I don't know.

513
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:46,039
I can't tell.

514
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,603
Yeah, me neither.

515
00:30:47,647 --> 00:30:49,615
He wrote me a letter.

516
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:51,879
He says he's
in love with you.

517
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,612
What are you talking about?

518
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:57,145
That's what he said.

519
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:00,387
I don't know how
we're supposed to take it.

520
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:01,586
Hang on.

521
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,068
Hello.

522
00:31:10,103 --> 00:31:11,934
Sugar, it's Eli.

523
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:13,461
Hey, baby, give me a second.

524
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:15,235
What are we doing, Eli?

525
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:17,504
Oh, I just got to pick
something up.

526
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:21,403
Don't repeat that, by the way.

527
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:22,471
About Richie.

528
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:25,951
It was told to me in
confidence, and, you know...

529
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,285
Good.

530
00:31:32,325 --> 00:31:35,726
Now just remove the loose soil

531
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:39,664
and note the
decomposition levels.

532
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:41,633
I'm sorry to interrupt
your work.

533
00:31:41,667 --> 00:31:43,828
Don't be silly.

534
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,497
Come on.

535
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:48,132
I just want to apologize
for the other day

536
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:49,641
when I proposed to you.

537
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:50,642
Why?

538
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,041
I thought it was very sweet.

539
00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:54,842
I know I'm not as accomplished
as some of the men

540
00:31:54,881 --> 00:31:56,371
you've been involved with.

541
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,249
Uh, Franklin Benedict,
General Cartwright,

542
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,616
and your ex-husband.

543
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:01,950
Oh, that's ridiculous.

544
00:32:01,988 --> 00:32:03,649
But, but, I feel...

545
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:06,590
I can offer
just as much as them.

546
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:10,153
I know I went about it
backwards, but...

547
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,687
Henry, I have no interest
in Franklin Benedict

548
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:14,597
or Doug Cartwright...
I never did...

549
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:17,330
and as far as Royal's concerned,
he's the most...

550
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,803
Henry?

551
00:32:21,874 --> 00:32:23,239
Henry, are you all right?

552
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:25,267
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

553
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:28,769
Anyway, let me know
when you make up your mind.

554
00:32:28,815 --> 00:32:31,750
Henry, wait a second.

555
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:35,743
I'm sorry, I'm very nervous.

556
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,517
Th-That's okay.

557
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,952
Oh, thank you.

558
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:46,522
Why are you so nervous?

559
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:49,467
Well, to tell you the truth

560
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:53,836
I haven't slept
with a man in 18 years.

561
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:59,831
That's a hell of an old
hound dog you got there.

562
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:00,930
What's he go by?

563
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:02,338
Buckley.

564
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,206
Buckley, sit.

565
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:09,738
You know who I am?

566
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,840
I'm Royal.

567
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,442
Have you heard of me?

568
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:17,417
I'm very sorry for your loss.

569
00:34:17,456 --> 00:34:20,152
Your mother was a terribly
attractive woman.

570
00:34:20,192 --> 00:34:21,318
Thank you.

571
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,225
Which one are you?

572
00:34:23,262 --> 00:34:24,456
Ari.

573
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:26,192
Uzi, I'm your granddad.

574
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,494
Hello.

575
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,127
I'm sorry we haven't gotten
to know each other.

576
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,228
I don't get invited around
very much.

577
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:34,569
What do you think of that,
by the way?

578
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:35,869
Oh, you...

579
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,967
you don't have to say anything.

580
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,377
It's kind of a “fuck you”
to the old man, I guess.

581
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,779
How's your daddy?

582
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:43,782
Fine.

583
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:44,783
You think so, huh?

584
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:46,648
How often has he got you
working out?

585
00:34:46,686 --> 00:34:48,586
16 times a week.

586
00:34:49,722 --> 00:34:50,689
Do me a favor.

587
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:52,247
Tell him you want to meet me.

588
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,849
But we just met.

589
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:54,917
No, we didn't.

590
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:57,486
Look, I'd like us to have
a relationship

591
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,931
but we have to pull some strings
to make it happen.

592
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:04,164
Now, here's what you tell him.
You say...

593
00:35:04,203 --> 00:35:06,330
<i>Well, I bet</i>
<i>Mom would have wanted us</i>

594
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:07,805
<i>to meet him before he died.</i>

595
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,932
Wouldn't she?

596
00:35:08,975 --> 00:35:10,374
Don't you think?

597
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:28,015
She was a tough old broad,
wasn't she?

598
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,392
I wouldn't know.

599
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:31,953
Excuse me. Come on.

600
00:35:31,998 --> 00:35:33,090
Oh, that's right.

601
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,100
We've got another body
buried here, haven't we?

602
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,123
Uh, hold on.

603
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:40,439
Take some of these.

604
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,670
Come on.

605
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:50,008
So what do you think
of this big, old black buck

606
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,107
moving in up there?

607
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,742
Who?

608
00:35:52,785 --> 00:35:53,979
Henry Sherman.

609
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,180
You know him?

610
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:56,620
Yeah.

611
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:58,487
Is he worth a damn?

612
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:02,223
I believe so.

613
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,497
What happened to your finger?

614
00:36:09,535 --> 00:36:10,502
Uzi, shh.

615
00:36:10,536 --> 00:36:11,560
It's okay, I'll tell you.

616
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:12,969
I'm adopted. Did you know that?

617
00:36:14,607 --> 00:36:15,574
Well, I am.

618
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,873
When I was 14, I went to find
my real family.

619
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,139
They live in Indiana.

620
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,012
All right, now, just set one
of them hickory trunks

621
00:36:23,049 --> 00:36:25,017
right up top there,
sister Maggie.

622
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:36,386
Did you try to sew it back on?

623
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:38,989
Wasn't worth it.

624
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:48,438
Hell of a damn grave.

625
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:51,966
Wish it were mine.

626
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,342
It's a shame, isn't it?

627
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:54,676
What?

628
00:36:54,714 --> 00:36:57,308
Well, you probably had another
good two or three years

629
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,816
of competitive play in you.

630
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,011
Probably.

631
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:03,647
I had a lot riding on
that match, you know.

632
00:37:03,689 --> 00:37:05,953
Financially and personally.

633
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:10,052
Why did you choke out
there that day, Baumer?

634
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:13,122
Mr. Gandhi leads 40-15.

635
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,103
That's 72 unforced errors

636
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,437
for Richie Tenenbaum.

637
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,443
He's playing the worst tennis
of his life.

638
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:26,445
What's he feeling right now,
Tex Hayward?

639
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:27,844
I don't know, Jim.

640
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,007
There's obviously
something wrong with him.

641
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:32,279
He's taken off his shoes
and one of his socks

642
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:34,149
and... actually,
I think he's crying.

643
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:35,881
I think you're right.

644
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,446
Who's he looking at
in the friends' box, Tex?

645
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:40,391
That's his sister, Margot

646
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,417
and her new husband,
Raleigh St. Clair.

647
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,429
They were just married
yesterday, Jim.

648
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:45,987
Oh, yes.

649
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:54,401
I've never seen anything
like this.

650
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,340
Neither have I.

651
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:59,708
Strange day out here
at Windswept Fields.

652
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,305
I kind of disappeared
after that, didn't I?

653
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:04,316
Yeah.

654
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:07,319
But I understood.

655
00:38:07,353 --> 00:38:10,618
I know you're not very good
with disappointment.

656
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,396
You still got that little BB

657
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,695
in your hand, Chassie?

658
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,864
Why did you shoot me?

659
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,774
It was the object
of the game, wasn't it?

660
00:38:31,811 --> 00:38:33,108
No.

661
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,613
We were on the same team.

662
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:37,707
Were we?

663
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:40,981
Well... you sued me.

664
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,045
Twice. Got me disbarred.

665
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,955
I don't hold it
against you, do I?

666
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,015
And how is it possible

667
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:48,993
for Mr. Tenenbaum
to withdraw these funds

668
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:50,655
without your written
authorization?

669
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,186
Objection, Your Honor.
Damn it, I...

670
00:38:52,231 --> 00:38:54,256
Why don't you leave
the objections to me, Royal?

671
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,495
Because I started the
corporation when I was a minor.

672
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:58,127
So, my father
was the primary signatory

673
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,467
on most of my accounts.

674
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:00,597
He also stole bonds

675
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,164
out of my safety deposit box
when I was 14.

676
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:09,573
You think you could
start forgiving me?

677
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,550
Why should I?

678
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:18,557
Because you're hurting me.

679
00:39:20,326 --> 00:39:21,657
Come on.

680
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,327
Were you in prison?

681
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,332
Kind of.

682
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:28,924
Minimum security.

683
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:31,436
I got jacked by the IRS.

684
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,767
Should we split?

685
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:33,772
Yes, sir.

686
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,433
No, call me Mr. Tenenbaum.

687
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:36,771
Okay.

688
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,437
No, I'm kidding; call me Pappy.

689
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,105
Okay.

690
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,809
Come on, let's shag ass.

691
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,283
Well, just let me know

692
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:48,786
if you need somebody
to talk to, okay?

693
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,379
I like Raleigh very much.

694
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,754
I know he's a lot older
than you are

695
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,123
and you two are having
some problems

696
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,219
but... anyway,
maybe I can help.

697
00:39:57,263 --> 00:39:58,992
Okay. Thanks.

698
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:01,898
Hey, Baumer! All right!

699
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:06,997
All right! Ha!
Oh, shit! Oh, Jesus.

700
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,372
By the way, I heard about
that letter you sent to Eli.

701
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,148
You dropped some cigarettes.

702
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:21,549
Those aren't mine.

703
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,953
They just fell
out of your pocket.

704
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:38,893
Oh, my Lord, look at you.

705
00:40:44,376 --> 00:40:45,638
Come in.

706
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,704
Did you tell Margot

707
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:52,979
about that letter
I wrote to you?

708
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,179
Why? Did she mention it?

709
00:40:57,823 --> 00:41:00,485
Yes, I did.

710
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:03,393
Why would she
have repeated that, I wonder?

711
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,159
Well, I would ask you
the same question.

712
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,224
Rightly so.

713
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:19,576
What'd you say?

714
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,645
What?

715
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:25,047
I didn't say anything.

716
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:27,211
When? Right now?

717
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,824
I'm sorry; don't listen to me.

718
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:35,156
I'm on mescaline.

719
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:37,162
I've been spaced out all day.

720
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:41,223
Did you say you're on mescaline?

721
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,200
I did, indeed.

722
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:45,430
Very much so.

723
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:47,871
How often do you, uh...?

724
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:49,635
I'm worried about you, Richie.

725
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,609
Why?

726
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:54,510
Well, actually, Margot is,
for some reason.

727
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:55,911
But I did find it odd

728
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:58,678
when you said
you were in love with her.

729
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,782
She's married, you know.

730
00:42:03,822 --> 00:42:05,585
Yeah.

731
00:42:05,624 --> 00:42:07,956
And she's your sister.

732
00:42:07,993 --> 00:42:10,427
Adopted.

733
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,836
Where are my encyclopedias?

734
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:24,240
They've been placed in storage.

735
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,141
Well, damn you.
You're taking my encyclopedias.

736
00:42:26,178 --> 00:42:27,805
- Th-this is humiliating.
- I'm sorry.

737
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:29,837
Would you like to make
a complaint in writing?

738
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:31,008
Where am I supposed to go?

739
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,540
You're turning me
into a damn hobo.

740
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:34,449
I'd be happy to make
a reservation for you

741
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,147
- at another hotel.
- You son of a bitch.

742
00:42:36,188 --> 00:42:37,485
Frederick.

743
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:38,490
Hello there, Dusty.

744
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:40,151
Hello.

745
00:42:40,192 --> 00:42:41,989
Could you spot me a quarter?

746
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:43,824
Of course.

747
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,161
Richie? Hi.

748
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:49,292
It's your dad.

749
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,663
I think he's very lonely...

750
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:56,537
lonelier than he lets on

751
00:42:56,575 --> 00:42:59,339
maybe lonelier
than he even realizes.

752
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:02,142
Have you spoken
to him about this?

753
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,308
Briefly,
and he agreed that we...

754
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,715
I'm sorry, maybe I'm
a little confused here.

755
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:08,049
What are you suggesting?

756
00:43:08,087 --> 00:43:10,385
That he come here
and stay in my room.

757
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,947
Are you out of your mind?

758
00:43:12,991 --> 00:43:14,356
No, I'm not.
Anyway, I think that

759
00:43:14,393 --> 00:43:16,588
he'd be much more comfortable
here than he would...

760
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:17,560
Who gives a shit?

761
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,223
I do.

762
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,458
You poor sucker.

763
00:43:20,499 --> 00:43:22,831
You poor, washed-up papa's boy.

764
00:43:22,868 --> 00:43:24,358
All right, let's not
get out of hand.

765
00:43:24,403 --> 00:43:26,894
Please, don't get in the middle
of this, Mr. Sherman.

766
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:28,065
This is a family matter.

767
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:30,268
Don't talk to him like that.

768
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:32,004
- Call me Henry.
- I prefer Mr. Sherman.

769
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:33,602
Call him Henry.

770
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,044
Why? I don't know him
that well.

771
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,411
You've known him for ten years.

772
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,109
As your accountant,
Mr. Sherman, yes.

773
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,447
Where are you going to sleep?

774
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:41,146
I'm just going
to camp out upstairs.

775
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,585
We brought our sleeping bag...

776
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:43,588
Uzi!

777
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:44,987
We don't mind, Dad.

778
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,990
We like him.

779
00:43:46,024 --> 00:43:47,013
Who, Pappy?

780
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,026
“Pappy”?

781
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,925
He can sleep in
the room above us.

782
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:51,486
Ari, it's not your decision.

783
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:52,827
Nor is it yours.

784
00:43:52,865 --> 00:43:54,560
Well, he's already up there.

785
00:43:56,969 --> 00:43:58,664
What?!

786
00:43:58,704 --> 00:43:59,932
I think he's asleep

787
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,099
because of the medication
he's on

788
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:05,941
but I... I guess you can
wake him up and throw him out...

789
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:09,175
if Mom says it's okay.

790
00:44:15,521 --> 00:44:18,251
Get out.

791
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,349
All right.

792
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:23,020
Let me just collect my things.

793
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:27,725
Would you mind handing me
my cane, Richie?

794
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:29,529
Let me see,
where's my suitcases?

795
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:30,865
I'll get 'em.

796
00:44:30,903 --> 00:44:32,131
Oh, thanks.

797
00:44:32,171 --> 00:44:33,798
Oh!

798
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,033
Dad!

799
00:44:36,408 --> 00:44:37,375
Mom!

800
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:40,207
Grab me a Nembutal,
will you, son?

801
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:42,042
Are you okay?

802
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,014
What the fuck you care?

803
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,949
Oh, my goodness.

804
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:48,043
Pagoda?

805
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:49,553
Call Doctor McClure.

806
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:55,193
Take a breath and hold it.

807
00:44:57,596 --> 00:44:58,563
Now cough.

808
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:04,363
His condition is stable.

809
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:06,769
The attack was
just a side effect.

810
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:09,797
I recommend you push fluids

811
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:12,241
and continue the stomach cancer
medication.

812
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:20,381
Can we move him?

813
00:45:20,419 --> 00:45:22,387
Absolutely not.

814
00:45:22,421 --> 00:45:24,548
For how long?

815
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,421
We'll have to wait and see.

816
00:45:26,458 --> 00:45:28,289
Is he going to be all right?

817
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:30,318
That depends. Is he a fighter?

818
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:31,852
Yeah.

819
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:33,694
Then that's the best we've got.

820
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,760
Pagoda's in possession

821
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:40,897
of a parcel containing
my will

822
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:44,340
and some instructions
for the funeral

823
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:46,469
including my epitaph,
for when the time comes.

824
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:47,808
Proofread it for me

825
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:50,178
before they carve it
on the headstone, okay?

826
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:51,876
Okay.

827
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:55,375
I never did stop loving you,
by the way.

828
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,682
Do you believe that?

829
00:45:56,722 --> 00:45:58,314
Not really.

830
00:45:58,357 --> 00:46:00,917
You look terrific.

831
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,688
That dress is stunning.

832
00:46:02,728 --> 00:46:04,719
Thanks.

833
00:46:27,052 --> 00:46:29,850
# Tears that angels cry... #

834
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:35,286
# And the dark
and all the sky... #

835
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:37,693
Lights out, old man.

836
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:41,256
I thought I'd read
for a while, Chas.

837
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,098
Sorry. 11:30. Lights out.

838
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:46,070
I'm right in the middle
of a sentence.

839
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:49,437
Well, you'll have to finish it
in the morning.

840
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:50,634
Them's the rules.

841
00:46:50,676 --> 00:46:52,644
Chas?

842
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,446
Good night, my boy.

843
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:59,644
# When the one you love
says good-bye #

844
00:47:01,687 --> 00:47:05,953
# Sing a lullaby #

845
00:47:05,991 --> 00:47:09,825
# Dee-Dee-Dee,
Dee-Dee, Dee-Dee #

846
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:14,161
# Dee-Dee-Dee, Dee-Dee,
Dee-Dee... #

847
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:16,963
Looks like you and Dad are
back together again, huh?

848
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:19,971
He's your dad, too, Chas.

849
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,563
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

850
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:23,437
You really hate me,
don't you?

851
00:47:23,475 --> 00:47:25,067
No. I don't. I love you.

852
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:28,736
Well, I don't know
what you think

853
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,714
you're going to get out of this

854
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:33,877
but believe me, whatever it is,
it's not worth it.

855
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,219
Chas...

856
00:47:38,256 --> 00:47:40,417
I don't want to hurt you.

857
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:43,121
I know what you and the boys
have been through.

858
00:47:43,161 --> 00:47:45,095
You're my brother,
and I love you.

859
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,927
Stop saying that!

860
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,879
What's that jackass doing?

861
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:11,144
I know you, asshole!

862
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,601
Did Eli send you that?

863
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:26,433
Mm-hmm.

864
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,440
He always sends me
his clippings.

865
00:48:29,474 --> 00:48:32,272
What for?

866
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,540
I think he just likes
the encouragement.

867
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,910
He's done it for years.

868
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:38,279
He used to send me
his grades in college.

869
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:41,111
That's ridiculous.

870
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:51,955
How long do you intend
to stay here?

871
00:48:51,997 --> 00:48:54,295
I don't know.

872
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:57,460
Are you ever coming home?

873
00:48:57,502 --> 00:49:01,302
Maybe not.

874
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:03,807
You're joking.

875
00:49:03,842 --> 00:49:06,834
No.

876
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,508
Well, I want to die.

877
00:49:15,187 --> 00:49:18,247
Raleigh, please...

878
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,451
Have you met someone else?

879
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:24,595
I couldn't even begin
to think about

880
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:27,621
knowing how to answer
that question.

881
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:36,368
I don't like the way
you're treating Raleigh.

882
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:41,445
What are you talking about?

883
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,970
You don't even know him.

884
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,914
Well, I've met him,
and I don't think he deserves...

885
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,010
Stay out of it.

886
00:49:48,053 --> 00:49:51,113
You're two-timing him
with that bloodsucker

887
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:54,057
Eli Cash.

888
00:49:54,092 --> 00:49:57,061
Now, that's just not right,
damn it.

889
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:59,154
You used to be a genius.

890
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,366
No, I didn't.

891
00:50:06,505 --> 00:50:09,235
Anyway, that's what
they used to say.

892
00:50:15,413 --> 00:50:17,938
Richard, I know you're
terribly close to Margot

893
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,178
and probably understand
her better than anyone.

894
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:23,187
May I confide in you?

895
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:29,987
Okay.

896
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:32,519
I believe
she's having an affair.

897
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:35,996
I'm utterly devastated.

898
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:39,663
I... don't know
where else to turn.

899
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:42,832
Will you advise me?

900
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,000
I don't know.

901
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,339
What do you want to do?

902
00:50:45,377 --> 00:50:46,503
I don't know.

903
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:47,671
Perhaps, uh...

904
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,179
Find the guy and get him?

905
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:50,909
Well, no,
I thought we could...

906
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,351
Who do you think it might be?

907
00:50:57,389 --> 00:51:00,722
I don't know at the moment.

908
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:05,220
Let's look
at the actuals, okay?

909
00:51:05,263 --> 00:51:07,288
I agree with you
a hundred percent.

910
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,527
That's why we have
marketing grids.

911
00:51:09,568 --> 00:51:11,126
Hey.

912
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,034
What do you say
we go down to Little Tokio

913
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,629
and get some fireworks?

914
00:51:14,673 --> 00:51:16,538
What do you need?

915
00:51:16,575 --> 00:51:18,736
Nothing.

916
00:51:18,777 --> 00:51:21,177
I see you got them,
uh, crunching numbers for you.

917
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:24,807
Please don't
come in this room.

918
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:26,339
Chas has those boys cooped up

919
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,318
like a pair of jackrabbits,
Etheline.

920
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,820
He has his reasons.

921
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:31,151
Oh, I know that

922
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:34,556
but you can't raise boys
to be scared of life.

923
00:51:34,593 --> 00:51:37,824
You got to brew
some recklessness into them.

924
00:51:37,862 --> 00:51:41,491
I think that's terrible advice.

925
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:45,492
No, you don't.

926
00:51:45,537 --> 00:51:47,971
We take boxing
and self-defense classes.

927
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:50,065
I'm not talking
about dance lessons.

928
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:51,973
I'm talking about
putting a brick

929
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,001
through the other guy's
windshield.

930
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:58,311
I'm talking about taking it out
and chopping it up.

931
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,079
What do you mean?

932
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,517
# The mama pajama
rolled out of bed #

933
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:04,245
# And she ran
to the police station #

934
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:08,350
# When the papa found out,
he began to shout #

935
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,089
# And he started
the investigation #

936
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:12,255
# It's against the law #

937
00:52:12,297 --> 00:52:13,423
Go!

938
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:14,523
# It was against the law #

939
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:18,595
# What the mama saw,
it was against the law #

940
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,569
# The mama looked down
and spit on the ground #

941
00:52:23,608 --> 00:52:26,099
# Ev'ry time my name
gets mentioned #

942
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,578
# The papa said,
“Oy, if I get that boy #

943
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:31,741
# I'm gonna stick him
in the house of detention” #

944
00:52:31,783 --> 00:52:33,876
# Well, I'm on my way #

945
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:36,352
# I don't know where I'm goin' #

946
00:52:36,388 --> 00:52:38,083
# I'm on my way #

947
00:52:38,123 --> 00:52:39,715
# I'm takin' my time #

948
00:52:39,758 --> 00:52:41,055
# But I don't know where #

949
00:52:41,092 --> 00:52:44,994
# Goodbye to Rosie,
the Queen of Corona... #

950
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:46,657
Come here.

951
00:52:46,698 --> 00:52:48,165
# See you, me and Julio #
- That's it! Run!

952
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,996
# Down by the schoolyard #

953
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:54,028
# See you, me and Julio
down by the schoolyard. #

954
00:53:17,829 --> 00:53:19,956
He saved my life, you know.

955
00:53:19,998 --> 00:53:23,627
30 years ago, I was
knifed in a bazaar
in Calcutta.

956
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,296
He carried me
to the hospital on his back.

957
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,473
Who stabbed you?

958
00:53:29,507 --> 00:53:30,633
He did.

959
00:53:30,675 --> 00:53:32,472
Yeah, there was
a price on my head

960
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,638
and he was a hired assassin.

961
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,138
Stuck me right in the gut
with that. Shoot.

962
00:53:49,194 --> 00:53:50,991
Hey!

963
00:53:51,029 --> 00:53:52,519
What?

964
00:53:53,698 --> 00:53:55,495
Where have you been?

965
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:58,195
Uh, we just stepped out
to get some air.

966
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:00,834
What's that?

967
00:54:00,872 --> 00:54:01,998
Holy shit.

968
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,507
That's not...?

969
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,839
What is that?

970
00:54:05,877 --> 00:54:08,345
Oh, no, no,
that's, uh, dog's blood.

971
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:09,676
Come here.

972
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:10,908
What?

973
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,287
You stay away from my children.

974
00:54:17,322 --> 00:54:18,619
Do you understand?

975
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:20,556
My God, I haven't been
in here for years.

976
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,116
Hey! Are you listening to me!

977
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,650
Yes, I am!

978
00:54:23,695 --> 00:54:26,255
I think you've having
a nervous breakdown!

979
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:27,958
I don't think you recovered

980
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:29,296
from Rachael's death.

981
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:30,824
I...

982
00:54:42,514 --> 00:54:44,505
There you are.

983
00:54:56,194 --> 00:54:58,492
How are you feeling?

984
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:00,327
I'm having a ball.

985
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,664
Scrapping and yelling
and mixing it up.

986
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:06,363
Loving every minute
with this damn crew.

987
00:55:08,873 --> 00:55:10,841
I want to thank you
for raising our children

988
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:12,843
by the way.

989
00:55:12,877 --> 00:55:15,004
Okay.

990
00:55:15,046 --> 00:55:17,276
I'm not kidding.

991
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:19,283
You always put them first,
didn't you?

992
00:55:19,317 --> 00:55:20,944
I tried to.

993
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,954
Lately I feel like maybe
I didn't do such a great job.

994
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,513
Goddamn it,
don't do that to yourself.

995
00:55:26,558 --> 00:55:28,423
I'm the one that failed them.

996
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:30,450
Or, anyway,
it's nobody's fault.

997
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:31,962
Plus, that... it doesn't...

998
00:55:31,996 --> 00:55:34,965
Why didn't you give
a damn about us, Royal?

999
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:37,968
Why didn't you care?

1000
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,299
I don't know.

1001
00:55:39,337 --> 00:55:41,999
I'm ashamed of myself.

1002
00:55:44,843 --> 00:55:47,471
I'll tell you
one thing, though...

1003
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:50,504
you got more grit, fire and guts

1004
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:53,483
than any woman
I have ever met.

1005
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:55,645
What... what are you
smiling about?

1006
00:55:55,687 --> 00:55:57,154
Nothing.

1007
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:58,655
No, wha... what's so funny?

1008
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:59,816
Nothing.

1009
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:02,326
It's these little
expressions of yours.

1010
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,487
I don't know
what you're talking about

1011
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:06,861
but I'll take it
as a compliment.

1012
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:11,331
You're true blue, Ethel.

1013
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:13,530
You really are.

1014
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:19,272
How's your love life?

1015
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:20,937
None of your business.

1016
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:32,456
I'd like you to talk
to Royal about us

1017
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,855
if you don't mind.

1018
00:56:33,892 --> 00:56:37,623
I don't think the timing's right
for that, Henry.

1019
00:56:37,662 --> 00:56:39,129
Well, I'd agree

1020
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:42,291
if I thought he was really
going to die in six weeks

1021
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,324
but I don't.

1022
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:48,404
Well, I hope you're right.

1023
00:56:48,439 --> 00:56:54,139
Actually, I don't believe
I'll join you tonight.

1024
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:57,170
I'll call you in the morning.

1025
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:06,053
She said that?

1026
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:10,657
Great.

1027
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:14,324
Got the sucker on the ropes.

1028
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:33,447
Can I ask you something, Hank?

1029
00:57:37,989 --> 00:57:40,116
Okay.

1030
00:57:41,793 --> 00:57:43,727
Are you trying
to steal my woman?

1031
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,892
I beg your pardon?

1032
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:48,922
You heard me, Coltrane.

1033
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:50,901
Coltrane?

1034
00:57:50,935 --> 00:57:52,630
What?

1035
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,467
Did you just call me “Coltrane”?

1036
00:57:54,505 --> 00:57:55,733
No.

1037
00:57:55,773 --> 00:57:56,865
You didn't?

1038
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:59,138
No.

1039
00:57:59,177 --> 00:58:01,372
Okay.

1040
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:04,975
But if I did...

1041
00:58:06,617 --> 00:58:09,586
you wouldn't be able to do
anything about it, would you?

1042
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,281
You don't think so?

1043
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:12,812
No, I don't.

1044
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:14,085
Listen, Royal

1045
00:58:14,125 --> 00:58:15,786
if you think
you can march in here...

1046
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:17,089
You want to talk some jive?

1047
00:58:17,128 --> 00:58:19,460
I'll talk some jive.

1048
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:21,124
I'll talk some jive
like you've never heard.

1049
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:22,530
- Oh, yeah?
- Right on!

1050
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:24,125
- Sit down.
- What?!

1051
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:25,135
Wh-what did you say?

1052
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,227
I said sit down, goddamn it!

1053
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:28,033
Oh, I heard you!
I want you out of my house!

1054
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,164
This is not your house!

1055
00:58:29,207 --> 00:58:30,572
I want your raggedy ass out!

1056
00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:31,870
Don't talk semantics with me.

1057
00:58:31,909 --> 00:58:32,876
Oh, this is not your...

1058
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,673
What's going on here?

1059
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:36,703
Nothing.

1060
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,602
Hello, I'm calling in regards
to a Dr. McClure... yes...

1061
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:05,438
at Colby General.

1062
00:59:05,476 --> 00:59:07,967
The name of the patient
is Royal Tenenbaum.

1063
00:59:10,014 --> 00:59:14,110
Is that a Tic-Tac?

1064
00:59:23,795 --> 00:59:26,559
How much is he paying you?

1065
00:59:26,597 --> 00:59:30,533
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1066
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:33,298
Well, I grew up with the
Tenenbaum family, you know.

1067
00:59:33,337 --> 00:59:34,361
Right.

1068
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:35,531
Across the street.

1069
00:59:36,841 --> 00:59:39,002
They've fallen on hard times
now, haven't they?

1070
00:59:39,043 --> 00:59:40,977
I can't say no.

1071
00:59:41,012 --> 00:59:42,673
This is bullshit.

1072
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:44,010
Change it, huh?

1073
00:59:46,451 --> 00:59:48,715
What did you do to your hand?

1074
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:51,654
Uh, nothing.

1075
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,918
Can we get somebody over here

1076
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,121
to kill these mice for us?

1077
00:59:58,162 --> 01:00:00,187
No. They belong to Chas.

1078
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:02,893
Or anyway, he invented them.

1079
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:05,334
Well, get him to stick them
in a fucking cage

1080
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,837
or something.

1081
01:00:07,872 --> 01:00:11,273
Etheline... mind coming up here
for a minute, please?

1082
01:00:11,309 --> 01:00:13,834
What's cooking, Pops?

1083
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:16,073
You'll see.

1084
01:00:16,114 --> 01:00:16,910
Now, your previous novel...

1085
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:18,245
Yes<i>. Wildcat.</i>

1086
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:19,271
Right.

1087
01:00:19,317 --> 01:00:21,581
Not a success.

1088
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,246
Why?

1089
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:32,058
Well, <i>Wildcat</i>was written
in a kind of obsolete

1090
01:00:32,096 --> 01:00:34,087
vernacular...

1091
01:00:37,268 --> 01:00:39,566
<i>Wildcat...</i>

1092
01:00:39,604 --> 01:00:42,266
<i>Wild... cat...</i>

1093
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:49,179
<i>Wildcat...</i>

1094
01:00:50,581 --> 01:00:52,446
I'm going to go.

1095
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:54,713
I'm taking this off
and I'm going.

1096
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:56,014
Stepping out.

1097
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:58,886
What the hell
kind of way to act is that?

1098
01:00:58,923 --> 01:01:00,288
Open the door.

1099
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,416
He's on drugs.

1100
01:01:01,459 --> 01:01:04,622
I'll be right back.

1101
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:08,095
James Bradley...

1102
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,997
Hold on a minute, please.

1103
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,228
What's going on?

1104
01:01:11,269 --> 01:01:13,737
Pagoda has something to say.

1105
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:20,903
He has a cancer.

1106
01:01:20,945 --> 01:01:23,243
No, he doesn't.

1107
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,306
I know what stomach cancer
looks like.

1108
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:26,941
I've seen it.

1109
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:29,350
And you don't eat

1110
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:32,914
three cheeseburgers a day
with French fries if you got it.

1111
01:01:32,957 --> 01:01:34,288
The pain is excruciating.

1112
01:01:34,325 --> 01:01:36,259
How would you know?

1113
01:01:36,294 --> 01:01:38,285
My wife had it.

1114
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:42,629
Not only is there
no Dr. McClure at Colby General

1115
01:01:42,667 --> 01:01:44,794
there is no Colby General.

1116
01:01:44,835 --> 01:01:47,360
It closed in 1974.

1117
01:01:47,405 --> 01:01:48,963
Aw, shit, man.

1118
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,997
Oh, shit, man.

1119
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,116
Yes, can you send a taxi

1120
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,883
to 111 Archer Avenue
right away, please?

1121
01:02:04,922 --> 01:02:05,889
Thank you.

1122
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:17,425
I guess we're back out
on the street, huh, pal?

1123
01:02:17,468 --> 01:02:19,766
Were you part of this,
Pagoda?

1124
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,362
Of course he was.

1125
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,838
No, well, yeah, he was

1126
01:02:22,873 --> 01:02:25,239
but, I mean,
he wasn't <i>that</i>involved.

1127
01:02:25,276 --> 01:02:28,074
Where'd you get all
these medical supplies?

1128
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,637
A guy at St. Pete's
owed me a favor.

1129
01:02:30,681 --> 01:02:34,447
I did some malpractice work
for him.

1130
01:02:34,485 --> 01:02:37,386
I do have
high blood pressure, though.

1131
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:43,492
Look, I know I'm going to be
the bad guy on this one.

1132
01:02:43,527 --> 01:02:46,894
But I just want to say,
the last six days have been

1133
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:49,832
the best six days
of probably my whole life.

1134
01:02:49,867 --> 01:02:52,233
<i>Immediately after</i>
<i>making this statement</i>

1135
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,761
<i>Royal realized</i>
<i>that it was true.</i>

1136
01:03:00,311 --> 01:03:03,280
Why'd you do this to us, Royal?

1137
01:03:03,314 --> 01:03:06,579
What was the point?

1138
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,881
I thought I could win you back.

1139
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:12,855
And then I thought I could
get rid of Henry...

1140
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:15,484
and at least keep
the status quo.

1141
01:03:15,526 --> 01:03:17,187
But we hadn't spoken
in seven years.

1142
01:03:17,228 --> 01:03:18,559
I know.

1143
01:03:19,897 --> 01:03:22,229
Plus, uh...

1144
01:03:22,266 --> 01:03:24,598
I was broke.

1145
01:03:26,003 --> 01:03:28,437
And I got kicked out
of my hotel.

1146
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:31,270
You're a bastard.

1147
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:33,971
Good-bye, Royal.

1148
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:49,583
Take it easy
on those boys, Chassie.

1149
01:03:49,627 --> 01:03:52,619
I don't want this
to happen to you.

1150
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,804
You know, Richie, this illness,
this closeness to death

1151
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,810
has had a profound effect
on me.

1152
01:04:06,844 --> 01:04:09,779
I- I feel like a different
person, I really do.

1153
01:04:09,814 --> 01:04:14,410
Dad, you were never dying.

1154
01:04:16,287 --> 01:04:18,585
But I'm going to live.

1155
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,597
He's not your father.

1156
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:34,502
Neither are you.

1157
01:05:06,704 --> 01:05:08,899
You son of a bitch!

1158
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:11,271
God<i>...</i> damn...

1159
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:16,410
That's the last time you put
a knife in me, hear me?

1160
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:30,083
The 375th Street Y, please.

1161
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:47,702
Everyone's against me.

1162
01:05:47,745 --> 01:05:49,679
It's your fault, man.

1163
01:05:49,713 --> 01:05:53,444
Yeah, I know, but damn it,
I want this family to love me.

1164
01:05:53,484 --> 01:05:54,678
How much money you got?

1165
01:05:54,718 --> 01:05:56,015
I don't have.

1166
01:05:56,053 --> 01:05:57,816
What, you're broke?

1167
01:05:57,855 --> 01:06:00,255
You got to be kidding me.

1168
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,384
How are we going to pay
for this room?

1169
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,654
All right,
we'll think of something.

1170
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,158
Ow.

1171
01:06:28,586 --> 01:06:33,182
I'm not in love
with you anymore.

1172
01:06:33,224 --> 01:06:35,818
I didn't know you ever were.

1173
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,487
Let's not make this
any more difficult

1174
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:39,291
than it already is.

1175
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:44,129
Okay.

1176
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,966
Okay, what?

1177
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:50,963
Okay, I'm not in love
with you, either.

1178
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:54,705
Yes, I know;
you're in love with Richie

1179
01:06:54,745 --> 01:06:57,043
which is sick and gross.

1180
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:04,647
Do you send my mother
your clippings...

1181
01:07:04,688 --> 01:07:06,918
and your grades from college?

1182
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:12,987
Please stop belittling me.

1183
01:07:20,538 --> 01:07:22,597
You never gave me
the time of day

1184
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,006
till I started getting
good reviews.

1185
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:28,034
Your reviews aren't that good.

1186
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,376
But the sales are.

1187
01:07:37,388 --> 01:07:41,654
Gentlemen... how much
do you already know?

1188
01:07:41,692 --> 01:07:44,718
Very little, I'm afraid.

1189
01:07:44,762 --> 01:07:46,696
Would you like
to examine the report?

1190
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,198
Yes.

1191
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,576
# Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt #

1192
01:08:02,613 --> 01:08:07,175
# They both went down to Berlin,
joined the Ice Capades #

1193
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,185
# And, oh, I don't know why #

1194
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,847
# Oh, I don't know why #

1195
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:14,323
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

1196
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:16,155
# Perhaps they'll die #

1197
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:17,182
# Oh, yeah #

1198
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,889
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

1199
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:22,194
# Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah #

1200
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:25,690
# Second verse,
same as the first #

1201
01:08:25,736 --> 01:08:28,136
# Jackie is a punk,
Judy is a runt #

1202
01:08:28,172 --> 01:08:32,108
# They both went down to Berlin,
joined the Ice Capades #

1203
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:35,043
# And, oh, I don't know why #

1204
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:37,274
# Oh, I don't know why #

1205
01:08:37,314 --> 01:08:39,680
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

1206
01:08:39,717 --> 01:08:41,412
# Perhaps they'll die #

1207
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:42,544
# Oh, yeah #

1208
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,850
# Perhaps
they'll die, oh, yeah #

1209
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:48,289
# Perhaps they'll die,
oh, yeah #

1210
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,595
# Third verse,
different from the first #

1211
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:02,765
# Jackie is a punk... #

1212
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,707
She smokes.

1213
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:13,717
Yes.

1214
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:20,750
All right, well.

1215
01:09:20,791 --> 01:09:22,986
Everything seems
to be in order.

1216
01:09:23,027 --> 01:09:26,019
I'll contact you
in the next 24 hours.

1217
01:09:26,063 --> 01:09:27,530
I appreciate that.

1218
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:30,931
Uh, which way are you leaning,
by the way?

1219
01:09:30,968 --> 01:09:32,333
I'll inform you of my decision

1220
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,495
at the appropriate time.

1221
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:34,902
I get it.

1222
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:37,338
Uh, Dusty, put in a good word
for us, will you?

1223
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:38,773
I already did.

1224
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:46,207
You want to play some word games

1225
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:49,014
or do some experiments
on me or anything?

1226
01:09:49,053 --> 01:09:51,044
No.

1227
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:55,021
# Your hand on his arm #

1228
01:09:55,059 --> 01:09:57,186
# Haystack charm #

1229
01:09:57,227 --> 01:09:59,058
# Around your neck #

1230
01:09:59,096 --> 01:10:01,223
# Strung out and thin #

1231
01:10:01,265 --> 01:10:05,565
# Calling some friend,
trying to cash some check #

1232
01:10:05,602 --> 01:10:08,298
# He's acting dumb #

1233
01:10:08,338 --> 01:10:12,297
# That's what you've come...
to expect #

1234
01:10:12,342 --> 01:10:16,779
# Needle in the hay #

1235
01:10:16,814 --> 01:10:20,011
# Needle in the hay #

1236
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:24,384
# Needle in the hay #

1237
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:27,857
# Needle in the hay #

1238
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,273
# He's wearin' your clothes #

1239
01:10:43,307 --> 01:10:44,797
# Head down to toes #

1240
01:10:44,842 --> 01:10:47,208
# A reaction to you #

1241
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:48,973
# You say you know what he did #

1242
01:10:49,012 --> 01:10:51,344
# But you idiot kid #

1243
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:53,713
# You don't have a clue #

1244
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:55,378
# Sometimes they just #

1245
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:57,580
# Get caught in the eye #

1246
01:10:57,621 --> 01:10:59,987
# You're pulling him through #

1247
01:11:00,023 --> 01:11:03,925
# Needle in the hay #

1248
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:05,758
# Needle in the hay... #

1249
01:11:05,796 --> 01:11:08,356
I'm going to kill myself
tomorrow.

1250
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:12,095
# Needle in the hay #

1251
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:15,401
# Needle in the hay. #

1252
01:11:58,849 --> 01:12:00,840
Dudley, where is he?

1253
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:04,415
Who?

1254
01:12:07,357 --> 01:12:09,621
He'll probably sleep
for several hours

1255
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,992
and then I'll come back
to check on him.

1256
01:12:12,029 --> 01:12:13,360
All right?

1257
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:19,892
How are you feeling?

1258
01:12:19,937 --> 01:12:21,598
Fine, thanks.

1259
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:24,072
Are you in any pain?

1260
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:25,438
Not really.

1261
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:26,772
Why'd you try
to kill yourself?

1262
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,437
Don't press him right now.

1263
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,776
I wrote a suicide note.

1264
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:32,213
You did?

1265
01:12:32,249 --> 01:12:33,546
Yeah.

1266
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:36,576
Right after I regained
consciousness.

1267
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,251
Can we read it?

1268
01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:41,450
No.

1269
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,619
Can you paraphrase it for us?

1270
01:12:44,661 --> 01:12:47,255
I don't think so.

1271
01:12:47,297 --> 01:12:49,390
Is it dark?

1272
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:50,798
Of course it's dark.

1273
01:12:50,834 --> 01:12:52,233
It's a suicide note.

1274
01:12:52,269 --> 01:12:53,759
All right, that's enough.

1275
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:55,601
Doctor said to let him sleep.

1276
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:01,001
What?!

1277
01:13:05,015 --> 01:13:06,983
Cover for us, will you, Dusty?

1278
01:13:07,017 --> 01:13:08,644
Yes. Yes, Royal.

1279
01:13:19,129 --> 01:13:23,429
You've made a cuckold of me.

1280
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:26,595
I know.

1281
01:13:26,637 --> 01:13:30,095
Many times over.

1282
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:33,769
I'm sorry.

1283
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,108
And you nearly killed
your poor brother.

1284
01:13:36,146 --> 01:13:39,274
What's he talking about?

1285
01:13:39,316 --> 01:13:41,944
It doesn't matter.

1286
01:13:41,985 --> 01:13:45,113
She's balling Eli Cash.

1287
01:13:45,155 --> 01:13:47,146
Oh, my goodness.

1288
01:13:50,327 --> 01:13:52,795
May I have a cigarette?

1289
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:55,957
What?

1290
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:59,457
Shall I repeat the question?

1291
01:13:59,503 --> 01:14:01,630
You don't smoke.

1292
01:14:01,672 --> 01:14:03,663
I know that.

1293
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:17,615
And a light.

1294
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,287
<i>Au revoir.</i>

1295
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,440
How long have you been
a smoker?

1296
01:14:40,477 --> 01:14:43,037
22 years.

1297
01:14:44,081 --> 01:14:46,549
Well, I think you should quit.

1298
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:57,989
How can I help?

1299
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,993
Let me look at these forms.

1300
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:17,446
Oh, Henry.

1301
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:26,755
Richie Tenenbaum, please.

1302
01:15:26,790 --> 01:15:27,916
Your name?

1303
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:29,084
Royal Tenenbaum.

1304
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:32,254
I'm afraid visiting hours
are over, sir.

1305
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:35,162
Wh-Wh-What does it say there...
they don't want me?

1306
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:36,358
I- I'm sorry.

1307
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:37,765
I have to refer you
to Dr. Burrows.

1308
01:15:37,801 --> 01:15:40,065
He'll be in
tomorrow afternoon.

1309
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,775
We could shimmy up
that gutter

1310
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:57,753
jump over that window ledge

1311
01:15:57,788 --> 01:16:00,951
and then, uh, pry open
that ventilator shaft.

1312
01:16:00,991 --> 01:16:02,788
There he is.

1313
01:16:02,826 --> 01:16:04,088
Richie!

1314
01:16:05,896 --> 01:16:07,830
Richie.

1315
01:16:09,866 --> 01:16:12,460
Where's he going?

1316
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:16,169
Richie!

1317
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:28,042
Well, I have to say

1318
01:16:28,085 --> 01:16:31,077
he didn't look half bad
for a suicide.

1319
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:34,420
Attempted, anyway.

1320
01:16:34,458 --> 01:16:35,948
Thanks.

1321
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:38,927
# Please #

1322
01:16:38,962 --> 01:16:41,453
# Give me second grace #

1323
01:16:45,402 --> 01:16:47,336
# Please #

1324
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:50,203
# Give me a second face #

1325
01:16:53,844 --> 01:16:57,109
# I've fallen far down #

1326
01:16:57,147 --> 01:17:01,345
# The first time around #

1327
01:17:01,384 --> 01:17:05,787
# Now I just sit on the ground
in your way #

1328
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,989
# Now #

1329
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:19,263
# If it's time
for recompense #

1330
01:17:19,302 --> 01:17:20,633
# For what's done... #

1331
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,638
Who's there?

1332
01:17:22,672 --> 01:17:25,072
# Come #

1333
01:17:25,108 --> 01:17:28,305
# Come sit down
on the fence in the sun... #

1334
01:17:28,345 --> 01:17:29,744
Hello?

1335
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:35,444
# And the clouds will roll by #

1336
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:38,147
# And we'll never deny... #

1337
01:17:45,862 --> 01:17:49,298
W- What are you doing in my tent?

1338
01:17:49,332 --> 01:17:52,563
Just listening to some records.

1339
01:17:52,602 --> 01:17:55,332
Aren't you supposed to be
in the hospital?

1340
01:17:55,372 --> 01:17:57,567
I checked myself out.

1341
01:18:19,196 --> 01:18:23,064
How many stitches did you get?

1342
01:18:23,099 --> 01:18:24,828
I don't know.

1343
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:26,495
You want to see?

1344
01:18:28,572 --> 01:18:32,804
# They seem to stay
for day after day #

1345
01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:33,934
# And won't disappear... #

1346
01:18:33,977 --> 01:18:35,205
Jesus.

1347
01:18:35,245 --> 01:18:37,213
# I tried every way... #

1348
01:18:37,247 --> 01:18:41,240
Richie, that looks horrible.

1349
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:44,913
I heard about your ex-husband.

1350
01:18:44,955 --> 01:18:45,979
Desmond?

1351
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:47,080
I guess so.

1352
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:48,988
I didn't get his name.

1353
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:50,356
Yeah.

1354
01:18:50,393 --> 01:18:52,827
I met him in the ocean.

1355
01:18:52,862 --> 01:18:54,056
I was swimming

1356
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:56,964
and he came out to me
in a canoe.

1357
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,195
We were only married
nine days.

1358
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:00,999
And I heard about Eli.

1359
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,299
I know.

1360
01:19:02,339 --> 01:19:07,003
Poor Eli.

1361
01:19:07,043 --> 01:19:10,410
Anyway, they mostly
just talked about you.

1362
01:19:10,447 --> 01:19:13,211
They did?

1363
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,014
Yeah.

1364
01:19:16,052 --> 01:19:21,149
I guess that was the attraction,
if you know what I mean.

1365
01:19:21,191 --> 01:19:25,287
# She smiled sweetly #

1366
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:28,388
# She smiled sweetly #

1367
01:19:28,431 --> 01:19:30,797
# And says don't worry... #

1368
01:19:30,834 --> 01:19:32,961
I have to tell you something.

1369
01:19:33,003 --> 01:19:34,971
What's that?

1370
01:19:35,005 --> 01:19:37,667
I love you.

1371
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:44,507
I love you, too.

1372
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:51,051
# There's no use tryin' #

1373
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:53,647
# You're here #

1374
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:58,024
# Begin again #

1375
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:00,393
# And o'er again #

1376
01:20:02,532 --> 01:20:07,492
# That's what she said
so softly... #

1377
01:20:07,537 --> 01:20:10,165
I can't stop thinking
about you.

1378
01:20:10,206 --> 01:20:13,471
I went away for a year,
and it only got worse

1379
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,501
and I don't know
what to do.

1380
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:19,504
Let's lie down for a minute.

1381
01:20:23,987 --> 01:20:26,012
# She smiled sweetly #

1382
01:20:26,056 --> 01:20:28,456
# She smiled sweetly... #

1383
01:20:28,491 --> 01:20:30,652
This is the sleeping bag

1384
01:20:30,694 --> 01:20:33,629
we took to the museum,
isn't it.

1385
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:38,964
# Oh, no, no, no... #

1386
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,970
Why'd you do it?

1387
01:20:41,004 --> 01:20:43,802
Because of me?

1388
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,003
Yeah, but it's not your fault.

1389
01:20:51,681 --> 01:20:55,481
You're not going
to do it again, are you?

1390
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,145
I doubt it.

1391
01:20:58,955 --> 01:21:01,685
# She would never say #

1392
01:21:01,725 --> 01:21:04,455
# Where she came from... #

1393
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:11,556
# Yesterday don't matter #

1394
01:21:11,601 --> 01:21:13,899
# If it's gone #

1395
01:21:17,807 --> 01:21:19,775
# While the sun is bright #

1396
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:24,613
# Or in the darkest night #

1397
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:26,444
# No one knows... #

1398
01:21:26,483 --> 01:21:28,348
I think we're just going
to have to be

1399
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:30,012
secretly in love with each other

1400
01:21:30,053 --> 01:21:31,577
and leave it at that, Richie.

1401
01:21:35,892 --> 01:21:39,851
# Good-bye, Ruby Tuesday #

1402
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:44,629
# Who could hang a name
on you? #

1403
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:49,127
# When you change
with every new day #

1404
01:21:49,172 --> 01:21:52,198
# Still I'm gonna miss you... #

1405
01:21:52,242 --> 01:21:54,301
Lobby floor.

1406
01:21:57,514 --> 01:21:58,503
Thank you, sir.

1407
01:22:04,521 --> 01:22:06,318
Going up?

1408
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:07,653
Yeah.

1409
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:08,987
What floor, sir?

1410
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:11,016
Doesn't matter.

1411
01:22:18,902 --> 01:22:20,426
So, you're
elevator operators now?

1412
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:21,630
Yeah, just started.

1413
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:23,639
We'll get a bump as soon
as we join the union.

1414
01:22:25,308 --> 01:22:27,606
What made you decide
to do that?

1415
01:22:27,644 --> 01:22:29,339
We're broke.

1416
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:32,473
But in answer to your question

1417
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:33,573
I wanted to prove

1418
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:35,106
I could pay my dues,
and whatnot.

1419
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:38,643
I just hope
somebody notices.

1420
01:22:40,156 --> 01:22:44,286
You asked me
why I choked out there that day.

1421
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:45,817
I think I may know the answer

1422
01:22:45,862 --> 01:22:47,261
and I wanted your advice.

1423
01:22:48,298 --> 01:22:50,698
Sure.

1424
01:22:58,174 --> 01:22:59,801
Margot Tenenbaum?

1425
01:22:59,843 --> 01:23:00,810
Yeah.

1426
01:23:00,844 --> 01:23:02,812
Well, since when?

1427
01:23:02,846 --> 01:23:05,644
Since always.

1428
01:23:05,682 --> 01:23:06,808
Does she know?

1429
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:11,650
Well, what does she feel
about that?

1430
01:23:11,688 --> 01:23:13,315
I think she feels confused.

1431
01:23:13,356 --> 01:23:14,482
Well, I can understand that.

1432
01:23:14,524 --> 01:23:15,991
It's probably illegal.

1433
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:17,356
I don't think so.

1434
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:19,588
We're not related by blood.

1435
01:23:19,629 --> 01:23:21,426
That's true.

1436
01:23:21,464 --> 01:23:23,591
Still frowned upon.

1437
01:23:23,633 --> 01:23:26,796
But then, what isn't
these days, right?

1438
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:37,544
I don't know, maybe it works.

1439
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:38,774
Why not, what the hell.

1440
01:23:38,815 --> 01:23:40,282
You love each other.

1441
01:23:40,316 --> 01:23:43,410
Nobody knows
what's going to happen, so...

1442
01:23:43,453 --> 01:23:44,920
You know something.

1443
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:48,783
Don't listen to me.

1444
01:23:48,825 --> 01:23:50,850
I never understood her myself.

1445
01:23:50,894 --> 01:23:52,885
I never understood any of us.

1446
01:23:52,929 --> 01:23:54,624
I wish I could tell you
what to do

1447
01:23:54,664 --> 01:23:56,825
but I just can't.

1448
01:23:58,001 --> 01:23:59,525
That's okay.

1449
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:02,800
No, it's not.

1450
01:24:02,839 --> 01:24:06,138
You still consider me
your father?

1451
01:24:06,175 --> 01:24:09,804
Sure, I do.

1452
01:24:09,846 --> 01:24:13,646
I wish I had more to offer
in that department.

1453
01:24:13,683 --> 01:24:16,675
I know you do, Pop.

1454
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,449
I don't blame you, by the way.

1455
01:24:24,494 --> 01:24:26,792
Uh, she's a
great-looking girl

1456
01:24:26,829 --> 01:24:28,262
and smart as a whip.

1457
01:24:28,298 --> 01:24:29,731
Mordecai.

1458
01:24:29,766 --> 01:24:37,605
# Stephanie says
that she wants to know #

1459
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,100
# Why she's given
half her life #

1460
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:46,377
# To people she hates now... #

1461
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:48,611
Holy shit.

1462
01:24:48,651 --> 01:24:51,620
You came back.

1463
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:52,814
Jiminy crickets.

1464
01:24:52,855 --> 01:24:56,120
That damn bird must
have radar in its brain.

1465
01:24:56,159 --> 01:24:57,456
Is that true, Mordecai?

1466
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:59,461
I- I'm not so sure
this is Mordecai.

1467
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:00,621
What do you mean?

1468
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:01,960
He flew right in here.

1469
01:25:01,998 --> 01:25:04,364
This bird has much more
white feathers on him.

1470
01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:10,234
Oh, the son of a bitch
must be molting.

1471
01:25:10,273 --> 01:25:12,969
Oh. I need your help
with something else.

1472
01:25:13,009 --> 01:25:14,670
You got it.
What's the situation?

1473
01:25:14,711 --> 01:25:16,406
Well, um, I think Eli maybe...

1474
01:25:16,446 --> 01:25:18,004
Hold it.

1475
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:20,572
Pagoda, meet me in the lobby.

1476
01:25:20,617 --> 01:25:21,879
Let's hit it.

1477
01:25:24,053 --> 01:25:27,216
I didn't mean right this second,
but... that's okay.

1478
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:29,918
I don't think it was Ramses.

1479
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:31,324
I believe
it was Tootinkamen.

1480
01:25:31,361 --> 01:25:32,487
Tutankhamen.

1481
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:33,756
Tutankhamen?

1482
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:34,956
Yes. Tutankhamen.

1483
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:41,963
Yes?

1484
01:25:46,376 --> 01:25:48,344
Hey, Richie.

1485
01:25:55,852 --> 01:25:58,184
We want to take you
to get some help.

1486
01:26:00,123 --> 01:26:02,114
Is it just you guys?

1487
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:04,388
Would you

1488
01:26:04,427 --> 01:26:05,519
excuse us, please?

1489
01:26:07,997 --> 01:26:10,090
Okay.

1490
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:20,599
Are we still friends?

1491
01:26:22,445 --> 01:26:23,571
What do you mean?

1492
01:26:23,613 --> 01:26:24,739
Are we?

1493
01:26:24,781 --> 01:26:25,907
Of course.

1494
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,916
How can you even ask me that?

1495
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,349
Well, it doesn't matter.

1496
01:26:29,385 --> 01:26:30,511
It doesn't matter?

1497
01:26:30,553 --> 01:26:31,679
It <i>does</i> matter.

1498
01:26:31,721 --> 01:26:34,189
I heard about you and Margot.

1499
01:26:44,701 --> 01:26:45,963
I'm sorry.

1500
01:26:46,002 --> 01:26:47,264
I don't know what to say.

1501
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:49,271
You don't have to say anything.

1502
01:26:49,305 --> 01:26:53,799
I always wanted
to be a Tenenbaum, you know.

1503
01:26:53,843 --> 01:26:55,333
Me, too.

1504
01:26:55,378 --> 01:26:56,504
Me, too.

1505
01:26:56,546 --> 01:26:58,776
'Cause it doesn't mean

1506
01:26:58,815 --> 01:27:01,613
what it used to though, does it?

1507
01:27:01,651 --> 01:27:04,176
I wish he'd done this for me
when I was a kid.

1508
01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:08,755
But you didn't have
a drug problem then.

1509
01:27:10,426 --> 01:27:13,020
Yeah, but it would've meant
a lot to me.

1510
01:27:13,062 --> 01:27:15,053
Anyway, I'm glad
you're here now.

1511
01:27:15,098 --> 01:27:18,590
I recognize
that I have a problem...

1512
01:27:18,634 --> 01:27:22,070
and I want to get better.

1513
01:27:24,207 --> 01:27:26,198
I'll just grab my stuff.

1514
01:27:36,219 --> 01:27:38,210
There he goes.

1515
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:39,551
What?!

1516
01:27:39,589 --> 01:27:40,556
There he goes.

1517
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:41,921
Tucker!

1518
01:27:41,958 --> 01:27:43,653
Skiddly, skiddly.

1519
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:54,969
# Christmastime is here #

1520
01:27:55,004 --> 01:27:57,404
# Happiness and cheer... #

1521
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,739
I'd like to order some ice cream
for my daughter, please.

1522
01:28:00,777 --> 01:28:02,074
What would you like, Margot?

1523
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,978
Nothing. I told you
I have to go in five minutes.

1524
01:28:05,014 --> 01:28:07,141
Oh.

1525
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:12,517
I'll have a butterscotch sundae,
I guess.

1526
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:21,191
Your brother's all torn up
inside.

1527
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:24,427
Well, so am I, but I'm not going
to discuss it with you.

1528
01:28:26,002 --> 01:28:28,129
Oh...

1529
01:28:28,171 --> 01:28:30,139
Can't somebody be a shit
their whole life

1530
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:31,470
and try to repair the damage?

1531
01:28:31,507 --> 01:28:34,943
I- I mean, I think people want
to hear that.

1532
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:35,944
Do they?

1533
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:38,913
You probably don't even know

1534
01:28:38,948 --> 01:28:40,939
my middle name.

1535
01:28:44,487 --> 01:28:46,955
That's a trick question.

1536
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:48,388
You don't have one.

1537
01:28:48,424 --> 01:28:49,652
Helen.

1538
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:52,752
That was my mother's name.

1539
01:28:52,795 --> 01:28:55,764
I know it was.

1540
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:12,407
Anybody interested
in grabbing a couple burgers

1541
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,439
and hitting the cemetery?

1542
01:29:36,305 --> 01:29:38,569
I got something for you, Ethel.

1543
01:29:38,608 --> 01:29:40,075
Actually, I made it.

1544
01:29:40,109 --> 01:29:41,508
What's this?

1545
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:42,806
It's a divorce.

1546
01:29:42,845 --> 01:29:44,608
From you?

1547
01:29:44,647 --> 01:29:45,807
Yes.

1548
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:46,974
This is Sanchez.

1549
01:29:47,016 --> 01:29:48,142
He's a notary public.

1550
01:29:48,184 --> 01:29:49,310
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

1551
01:29:49,352 --> 01:29:50,580
You just sign here

1552
01:29:50,620 --> 01:29:52,747
and initial here
and sign there.

1553
01:29:55,157 --> 01:29:57,591
You own this building,
don't you, Henry?

1554
01:29:59,662 --> 01:30:02,324
It's magnificent.

1555
01:30:02,365 --> 01:30:04,265
I used to be a homeowner myself

1556
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:06,632
until our son expropriated it
from me.

1557
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:09,001
I got to catch my bus.

1558
01:30:09,038 --> 01:30:10,198
Thanks, Sanchez.

1559
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:11,365
You're welcome.

1560
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:13,375
Are we divorced?

1561
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:14,535
Almost.

1562
01:30:14,577 --> 01:30:16,841
Sanchez just has
to file the papers.

1563
01:30:16,879 --> 01:30:18,244
I love you, Etheline.

1564
01:30:18,281 --> 01:30:20,909
Congratulations to both of you.

1565
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:22,918
I didn't think so much
of him at first.

1566
01:30:22,952 --> 01:30:24,146
But now I get it.

1567
01:30:24,186 --> 01:30:26,177
He's everything that I'm not.

1568
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:33,156
Take back Pagoda, will you?

1569
01:31:06,862 --> 01:31:08,329
Uh, slightly uneven.

1570
01:31:08,364 --> 01:31:10,264
Looks okay. You're just nervous.

1571
01:31:11,767 --> 01:31:13,257
Henry?

1572
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:14,394
Hello, Richie.

1573
01:31:14,437 --> 01:31:15,631
Hi.

1574
01:31:15,671 --> 01:31:17,605
This is my son, Walter Sherman.

1575
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,438
Hi, Walter. Nice to meet you.

1576
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:21,704
Nice to meet you.

1577
01:31:21,744 --> 01:31:22,972
Henry's your dad?

1578
01:31:23,012 --> 01:31:25,378
Yes.

1579
01:31:25,414 --> 01:31:27,405
So you've been married before.

1580
01:31:27,450 --> 01:31:30,283
Yes. I'm a widower.

1581
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:32,344
Oh, yeah.

1582
01:31:32,388 --> 01:31:34,913
I forgot.

1583
01:31:37,393 --> 01:31:40,226
You know, I'm a widower myself.

1584
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,928
I know you are, Chas.

1585
01:31:48,704 --> 01:31:51,002
What are you chewing on?

1586
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,667
My nicotine inhaler.

1587
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,676
It's supposed to help me quit.

1588
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:57,304
Is it working?

1589
01:31:57,346 --> 01:32:00,247
Not really.

1590
01:32:03,786 --> 01:32:05,583
Well, of course,
I'm half Hebrew

1591
01:32:05,621 --> 01:32:08,146
but the children are
three-quarters Mick Catholic.

1592
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,385
So they were raised
in the church?

1593
01:32:10,426 --> 01:32:12,451
I believe so.

1594
01:32:12,495 --> 01:32:14,326
I really don't know.

1595
01:32:24,073 --> 01:32:26,200
Here I come.

1596
01:32:29,645 --> 01:32:31,135
Boys!

1597
01:32:32,681 --> 01:32:34,376
What was that?

1598
01:32:35,651 --> 01:32:37,881
Eli just crashed his car
into the front of the house.

1599
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,217
Oh, my God.

1600
01:32:49,498 --> 01:32:51,864
Where's my shoe?

1601
01:32:54,937 --> 01:32:57,132
Ari, Uzi, where are you?

1602
01:32:57,173 --> 01:32:58,470
They're okay, Chas.

1603
01:32:58,507 --> 01:32:59,804
It's okay. They're safe.

1604
01:32:59,842 --> 01:33:01,275
They're safe.

1605
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,436
Dad, they ran over Buckley.

1606
01:33:02,478 --> 01:33:03,445
What?

1607
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:05,174
Yeah, I think we lost Buckley.

1608
01:33:05,214 --> 01:33:06,374
He saved them.

1609
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:07,541
Who?

1610
01:33:07,583 --> 01:33:09,574
Dad. He pulled them
out of the way.

1611
01:33:09,618 --> 01:33:11,609
You did?

1612
01:33:12,955 --> 01:33:14,547
Did I hit anyone?

1613
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:17,491
Is everybody okay?

1614
01:33:25,034 --> 01:33:27,025
Eli!

1615
01:33:27,069 --> 01:33:28,229
What's going on?

1616
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:39,445
Eli!

1617
01:33:39,482 --> 01:33:41,473
What?

1618
01:33:42,718 --> 01:33:44,242
Hey, man.

1619
01:33:44,286 --> 01:33:46,186
You should try this.
It's very tasty.

1620
01:34:07,276 --> 01:34:08,675
Tenenbaum!

1621
01:34:10,913 --> 01:34:12,904
Chas?

1622
01:34:37,239 --> 01:34:39,332
Did I hit the dog?

1623
01:34:39,375 --> 01:34:41,366
Yeah.

1624
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:46,239
Is he dead?

1625
01:34:46,282 --> 01:34:48,375
Yeah.

1626
01:34:51,620 --> 01:34:53,645
I need help.

1627
01:34:53,689 --> 01:34:57,181
So do I.

1628
01:35:02,198 --> 01:35:04,962
Go around to the other side.

1629
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,399
You kids stay there.

1630
01:35:06,435 --> 01:35:07,527
We'll be right back.

1631
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:09,561
Yeah.

1632
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,898
Can I say something
to you, Henry?

1633
01:35:12,942 --> 01:35:14,102
Okay.

1634
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:15,770
I've always been considered
an asshole

1635
01:35:15,811 --> 01:35:17,301
for about as long
as I can remember.

1636
01:35:17,346 --> 01:35:18,711
That's just my style.

1637
01:35:18,747 --> 01:35:19,805
But I'd really feel blue

1638
01:35:19,848 --> 01:35:21,975
if I didn't think
you were going to forgive me.

1639
01:35:22,017 --> 01:35:25,384
I don't think
you're an asshole, Royal.

1640
01:35:25,421 --> 01:35:28,254
I just think you're kind
of a son of a bitch.

1641
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:30,690
Well, I really
appreciate that.

1642
01:35:32,995 --> 01:35:34,963
Could you let us
in your backyard, ma'am?

1643
01:35:34,997 --> 01:35:36,965
We've got a couple boys
back there.

1644
01:35:36,999 --> 01:35:39,024
I think you may
have broken an ankle.

1645
01:35:39,068 --> 01:35:41,798
Well, that's not terribly
serious, is it?

1646
01:35:41,837 --> 01:35:44,169
Do you have an alternate?

1647
01:35:44,206 --> 01:35:45,434
No.

1648
01:35:45,474 --> 01:35:47,066
Ready?

1649
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:49,043
Are there priests on call?

1650
01:35:49,078 --> 01:35:51,171
Why don't you bring
the car around, Anwar.

1651
01:35:51,213 --> 01:35:54,512
At which point, I apparently
lost control of the vehicle

1652
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:57,280
smashed it into the house,
and killed that poor dog.

1653
01:35:57,319 --> 01:35:59,014
You're Eli Cash.

1654
01:35:59,054 --> 01:36:00,681
Yes indeed, I am.

1655
01:36:00,723 --> 01:36:02,156
I love your work.

1656
01:36:02,191 --> 01:36:03,954
Oh, how sweet of you to say.

1657
01:36:03,993 --> 01:36:05,858
DISPATCHER
78-35, Code Six.

1658
01:36:05,894 --> 01:36:07,828
105 North Sandler...

1659
01:36:07,863 --> 01:36:10,161
I think he's part mutt.

1660
01:36:10,199 --> 01:36:13,760
What kind of papers
do you have for him?

1661
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:15,963
Spark Plug, sit, sit.

1662
01:36:16,005 --> 01:36:18,565
Good boy.

1663
01:36:21,143 --> 01:36:24,203
Put this on.

1664
01:36:26,248 --> 01:36:27,442
What's so funny, Dudley?

1665
01:36:27,483 --> 01:36:29,451
You look great.

1666
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:32,678
Can you see out of it?

1667
01:36:32,721 --> 01:36:33,847
Not really.

1668
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:36,050
Uh-huh. Minor corneal damage.

1669
01:36:36,091 --> 01:36:38,389
Page me if it spreads
to the other eye.

1670
01:36:39,728 --> 01:36:40,854
Who do I make it out to?

1671
01:36:40,896 --> 01:36:42,659
Alex? Okay.

1672
01:36:44,233 --> 01:36:46,633
But these aren't structure-
bearing elements, Dad.

1673
01:36:46,669 --> 01:36:48,068
It doesn't matter.

1674
01:36:48,103 --> 01:36:49,968
It's still best
to file another force majeure

1675
01:36:50,005 --> 01:36:51,336
and recoup the deductible.

1676
01:36:56,545 --> 01:36:58,809
You boys come up here with me.

1677
01:36:58,847 --> 01:37:00,838
But Buckley's
still under there.

1678
01:37:00,883 --> 01:37:05,843
I know, but there's nothing
we can do for him at the moment.

1679
01:37:05,888 --> 01:37:07,879
Come on.

1680
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:13,827
I got you a new dog
for the boys.

1681
01:37:13,862 --> 01:37:15,830
I just bought him.

1682
01:37:15,864 --> 01:37:18,059
You did?

1683
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:20,330
Sorry I let you down, Chas.

1684
01:37:20,369 --> 01:37:22,394
All of you.

1685
01:37:22,438 --> 01:37:25,066
I been trying
to make it up to you.

1686
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,539
What's his name?

1687
01:37:33,582 --> 01:37:35,573
Spark Plug.

1688
01:37:38,454 --> 01:37:40,422
Thank you.

1689
01:37:40,456 --> 01:37:42,549
You're welcome.

1690
01:37:45,127 --> 01:37:47,186
I've had a rough year, Dad.

1691
01:37:47,229 --> 01:37:49,493
I know you have, Chassie.

1692
01:37:56,638 --> 01:37:58,629
Hey.

1693
01:38:19,194 --> 01:38:20,456
See, now he has

1694
01:38:20,496 --> 01:38:22,361
more white feathers
on his neck.

1695
01:38:25,234 --> 01:38:27,668
I wonder
what happened to him?

1696
01:38:27,703 --> 01:38:29,261
I don't know.

1697
01:38:29,304 --> 01:38:32,330
Sometimes if a person
has a traumatic experience

1698
01:38:32,374 --> 01:38:33,898
their hair turns white.

1699
01:38:35,544 --> 01:38:37,842
Well, I'm sure
he'll get over it.

1700
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:57,490
This was one
of my first hiding places.

1701
01:39:01,036 --> 01:39:03,300
How old do you think those are?

1702
01:39:05,174 --> 01:39:07,142
I'd say about ten years.

1703
01:39:09,578 --> 01:39:11,546
Come here.

1704
01:39:45,481 --> 01:39:48,814
<i>Royal dug a hole for Buckley</i>
<i>behind the garden shed</i>

1705
01:39:48,851 --> 01:39:50,978
<i>and buried him</i>
<i>in a canvas duffel bag.</i>

1706
01:39:51,019 --> 01:39:52,418
All right, boys.

1707
01:39:52,454 --> 01:39:53,580
Say a prayer.

1708
01:39:53,622 --> 01:39:55,112
Dear Heavenly Father...

1709
01:39:55,157 --> 01:39:56,488
I do.

1710

<i>It ran for just under two weeks</i>
<i>and received mixed reviews.</i>

1715
01:40:18,113 --> 01:40:21,378
Yes, can the boy tell time?

1716
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:23,077
Oh, my Lord, no.

1717
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:24,676
No. No.

1718

1724

Wind's blowing up
a gale today.

1725
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:46,940
This is the grip
that Rod Laver used.

1726
01:40:46,975 --> 01:40:48,442
Are you familiar with Laver?
