00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,335
YOU OK?

165
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,636
YEAH.

166
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,804
YOU'VE BEEN
AWFUL QUIET

167
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,806
SINCE WE LEFT
THE RESTAURANT.

168
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,875
I'M FINE. I'VE JUST
BEEN THINKING.

169
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,710
THINKING?
ABOUT WHAT?

170
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,214
HAVE YOU EVER FELT LIKE
YOU MIGHT BE DREAMING

171
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,784
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW
YOU WERE AWAKE?

172
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:27,420
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO RUN THAT BY ME AGAIN?

173
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,789
LIKE SOMETHING HAPPENED,

174
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:31,558
BUT IT'S MORE LIKE
A DREAM THAN REAL.

175
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,560
DAYDREAMING.
YEAH, SURE.

176
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,295
HAPPENS
TO EVERYBODY.

177
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,764
IT'S OK.

178
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,368
I GOT TO STOP
BY THE OFFICE
FOR SOMETHING.

179
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,502
WAIT FOR ME
IN THE CAR?

180
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,737
OK.

181
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:45,739
ALL RIGHT?

182
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,494
TRACY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

183
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,162
WHAT? WHAT?

184
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,232
THAT WASN'T
A DREAM YOU HAD.
IT WAS REAL.

185
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,533
WHERE ARE YOU?

186
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,368
IN THE BACK SEAT.

187
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,876
WELL?

188
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:25,045
DISAPPOINTED?

189
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,915
OH, GOSH, NO...
GOD, SIR.

190
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,084
WHY--WHY WOULD I BE
DISAPPOINTED, SIR?

191
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,788
ARE YOU REALLY GOD, SIR?

192
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:37,190
FORGET THE SIR.
JUST PLAIN GOD.

193
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,059
THE OWNER
OF THE STORE.

194
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,694
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE MAN UPSTAIRS.

195
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,998
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMEHOW I THOUGHT
YOU'D LOOK HOLIER...

196
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47,067
AND MORE FANCY,
SORT OF.

197
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:51,038
I MEAN,
LIKE WITH A CROWN
AND A LONG BEARD

198
00:12:51,038 --> 00:12:53,040
AND A FLOWING
WHITE ROBE.

199
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,042
YOU'RE THINKING OF
CHARLTON HESTON.

200
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:57,244
I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

201
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,511
IT'S JUST THAT--

202
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,182
THAT I GUESS
I EXPECTED YOU
TO LOOK MUCH OLDER.

203
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,252
THANKS, TRACY.
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

204
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,386
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

205
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:07,855
WHO KNOWS?

206
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:11,224
AFTER THE FIRST
2 MILLION YEARS,
I STOPPED COUNTING.

207
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:13,526
IT'S AWKWARD
TALKING LIKE THIS.

208
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,997
WOW! HOW'D
YOU DO THAT?

209
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,832
IF I COULD PART
THE RED SEA,

210
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,302
I CAN CERTAINLY
MOVE TO THE FRONT
OF A CAR.

211
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,239
IT'S REFRESHING
TALKING TO A YOUNG
LADY LIKE YOU.

212
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:29,342
TAKES MY MIND OFF
SOME OF MY PROBLEMS.

213
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,477
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS?

214
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,546
YEAH. I'M NOT ALWAYS
ON CLOUD NINE.

215
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,116
THEY'RE STILL NOT
GETTING MY MESSAGE.

216
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,518
I'M JUST NOT IN
PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS.

217
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:41,221
THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IN ME
LIKE THEY SHOULD.

218
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,892
I DO, AND I'M NOT
SAYING THAT JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.

219
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:46,894
I KNOW, BUT
THERE ARE PEOPLE

220
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:49,963
WHO THINK OF ME
ONLY A COUPLE
OF TIMES A YEAR.

221
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,265
THEN OTHERS DON'T
THINK OF ME AT ALL

222
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,201
UNTIL THAT
VERY LAST MINUTE--

223
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:57,204
AND THEN, BOY, DO I
HEAR FROM THEM.

224
00:13:57,204 --> 00:14:00,207
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE
REMINDED THAT
I'M STILL AROUND.

225
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:03,243
THEN COME UP WITH ONE
OF YOUR BIG MIRACLES.

226
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,378
THAT WOULD REALLY
SHAKE THEM UP.

227
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,048
AH. PEOPLE
REMEMBER THE MIRACLE

228
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:10,050
AND FORGET
WHY I DID IT.

229
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,752
I'VE GOT IT.
MY DAD'S IN THAT BUSINESS.

230
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,121
YOU SHOULD ADVERTISE.

231
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,722
TELEVISION, RADIO,

232
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:17,324
BILLBOARDS, NEWSPAPERS.

233
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,658
GET A SLOGAN.

234
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,293
A SLOGAN?

235
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,530
TRACY, I'M NOT A TUBE
OF TOOTHPASTE.

236
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,965
SLOGANS REALLY WORK.

237
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,167
YOU'LL BECOME
A HOUSEHOLD WORD.

238
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,536
HOUSEHOLD WORD.

239
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,805
YEAH. THAT WOULD BE
NICE FOR A CHANGE.

240
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:36,944
ALL RIGHT, TRACY.
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
A JOB.

241
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,278
YOU THINK
OF A SLOGAN,

242
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,213
AND I'LL SPREAD IT
AROUND.

243
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,682
I'LL ASK MY DAD.
HE'S GREAT.

244
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:46,019
NO. I HAVEN'T
BEEN DOING TOO WELL
WITH GROWNUPS LATELY.

245
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,820
I'D RATHER
IT CAME FROM YOU.

246
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,623
ME? I'M THE WORLD'S
WORST WRITER,

247
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,892
AND MY SPELLING
IS THE PITS.

248
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,028
I DON'T TAKE OFF
FOR SPELLING.

249
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,964
SEE, IF IT COMES
FROM YOU,

250
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:59,566
IT'LL BE SOMETHING
THAT YOUR FRIENDS
CAN UNDERSTAND.

251
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,602
THAT WAY, I'LL HAVE
THE CHILDREN
ON MY SIDE.

252
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,405
AND WHEN THEY
GROW UP, I'LL HAVE
THEIR CHILDREN.

253
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,240
ONCE YOU'VE GOT
THE CHILDREN,

254
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,841
THAT'S
THE BALL GAME.

255
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,145
THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE
OF A FEW THINGS--

256
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:13,746
LIKE ALL THAT
POLLUTION.

257
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,816
AND HAVE YOU NOTICED
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT
OF EAGLES?

258
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:21,121
AND THERE ARE
A FEW VOLCANOES THAT
NEED COOLING OFF.

259
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:22,922
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
TRACY?

260
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,559
WILL YOU COME UP
WITH A SLOGAN?

261
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:28,661
OK. I'LL SURE TRY.

262
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:29,862
GOOD.

263
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,166
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

264
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,701
NOBODY ELSE WILL,
EITHER.

265
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,504
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE
OR HEAR ME.

266
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:40,873
TELL THEM ABOUT
OUR VISITS, THEY'LL
THINK YOU'RE, UM...

267
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:41,941
BONKERS?

268
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,576
DEFINITELY.

269
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:47,147
THEY GAVE SOME
OF MY BEST PEOPLE
A PRETTY BAD TIME.

270
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,082
HERE COMES
YOUR FATHER.

271
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,922
HERE YOU GO.

272
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,191
SORRY I TOOK SO LONG.

273
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:04,031
OK. READY
FOR YOUR MOVIE?

274
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,698
YEP.

275
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,943
THREE LASER FIGHTS,
A COLLISION OF PLANETS?

276
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,511
YOU DON'T EVEN WATCH.

277
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,114
HALFWAY
THROUGH THE MOVIE,
YOU WANT TO GO HOME.

278
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,449
YOU OK?

279
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:23,983
SORRY, DADDY.

280
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,253
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SORRY.

281
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,623
DADDY?

282
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,524
HMM?

283
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,860
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE
A BIG NEW CLIENT

284
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,064
AND YOU NEED
A REAL SUPER SLOGAN.

285
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:39,332
WHERE DO YOU START?

286
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,170
WELL, UH...

287
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,272
FIRST YOU EXAMINE
THE PRODUCT.

288
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,773
YOU TRY TO PICK OUT

289
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,176
THE SINGLE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT IT--

290
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:51,078
THE THING THAT'LL
MAKE IT SELL--

291
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,013
LIKE, UM...WELL,
TAKE POTATO CHIPS,
FOR EXAMPLE.

292
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:57,484
NO. SOMETHING BIGGER.
MORE IMPORTANT.

293
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,352
IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER.

294
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,620
A PRODUCT'S
A PRODUCT.

295
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,222
THE PRINCIPLE
IS THE SAME.

296
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:04,624
WELL, LET'S SAY YOU'RE
SELLING A PERSON...

297
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,758
OK.

298
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,160
A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON,

299
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,928
LIKE, UH...

300
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,864
WELL, LET'S SAY...

301
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,433
GOD.

302
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,704
GOD.

303
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,572
I DON'T THINK I'D
HANDLE THAT ACCOUNT.

304
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,309
ONE MISTAKE AND
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE
THERE.

305
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,311
DON'T TRY AND GET
OUT OF IT, DADDY.

306
00:17:24,311 --> 00:17:26,513
HOW WOULD YOU
SELL GOD?

307
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:28,415
OK. GOD.

308
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,384
GOD. WELL...

309
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:35,422
FIRST I'D, UH,
MAKE A LIST OF
HIS GOOD QUALITIES--

310
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:36,989
YOU KNOW, HIS MOST
SALABLE FEATURES--

311
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,993
THEN I'D COME UP
WITH A NICE
LOW-KEY SLOGAN.

312
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,797
THEN I'D MEET HIM
FOR LUNCH AND
PITCH IT TO HIM.

313
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,233
AND THEN?

314
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,201
IF HE LIKES IT,
I'LL PICK UP THE TAB.

315
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,503
IF NOT, I'LL LET HIM
PICK IT UP.

316
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,539
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF
ABOUT GOD?

317
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,307
SOME SCHOOL PROJECT,
OR--

318
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,809
SORT OF.
IT'S AN ASSIGNMENT
I JUST GOT.

319
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,545

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,156
THE TONIGHT SHOW,
STARRING JOHNNY CARSON.

484
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,993
THIS IS ED McMAHON
ALONG WITH TOMMY NEWSOME

485
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,796
INVITING YOU TO JOIN
JOHNNY AND HIS GUESTS--

486
00:26:03,796 --> 00:26:06,565
BOB HOPE,
ANGIE DICKINSON,

487
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,934
MELISSA MANCHESTER,

488
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,236
AND OLYMPICS EXPERT
BUD GREENSPAN.

489
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:12,304
AND NOW,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

490
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,374
HERE'S...

491
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:16,542
JOHNNY!

492
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:18,645
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDS]

493
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:32,591
GOD? ON THE JOHNNY
CARSON SHOW?

494
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,026
WHY NOT?

495
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:35,928
HE GETS EVERYBODY ELSE
TO REPLACE HIM.

496
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,496
I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

497
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,965
DON'T WORRY, TRACY.

498
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,800
ONLY YOU CAN SEE ME.

499
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,670
EVERYBODY ELSE
IS WATCHING JOHNNY CARSON.

500
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,306
WOW. YOU REALLY
GET AROUND.

501
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,876
WHEN YOU GOT
A TERRITORY
AS BIG AS MINE,

502
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:52,111
YOU CAN'T DOG IT.

503
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,347
WELL, HAVE YOU
GOT A SLOGAN FOR ME?

504
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,249
YEAH, I GOT A FEW.

505
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,785
GOOD. LET'S HEAR THEM.

506
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,286
OK, HERE WE GO.

507
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,957
"HOW DO YOU SPELL
RELIEF? G-O-D."

508
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:07,960
THAT'S NICE.

509
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,096
IT'S--IT'S REAL NICE,

510
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:13,232
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S FOR ME.

511
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,167
HOW ABOUT THIS--

512
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:18,504
"GOD IS BULLISH
ON HUMANITY."

513
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,239
THAT'S NICE, TOO.

514
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,908
YOU GOT ANY MORE?

515
00:27:21,908 --> 00:27:25,011
OH, SURE. THIS ONE'S
MY FAVORITE.

516
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:28,114
"YOU'RE IN GOOD
HANDS WITH GOD."

517
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:31,784
THAT'S GOOD,
BUT THEN AGAIN, TRACY,

518
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,753
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN GOOD.

519
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:36,989
I THOUGHT YOU'D GO
FOR THAT ONE.

520
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,726
HOW ABOUT,
"LET GOD PUT YOU--"

521
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:41,728
IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT?

522
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,095
YEAH.

523
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,664
LOOK, I WORKED HARD
ON THESE.

524
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,334
I'M SURE YOU DID,

525
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:51,637
BUT, TRACY,
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I'M BRAGGING,

526
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:54,540
BUT LET'S FACE IT,
I'M AN ORIGINAL,

527
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,708
THE ONE AND ONLY.

528
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,878
I MADE MY OWN MOLD
AND THREW IT AWAY.

529
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:01,948
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY EASY.

530
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:05,417
I DIDN'T SAY IT WOULD BE.
ONE MORE WEEK.

531
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,219
JUST A WEEK?

532
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:08,587
THAT'S LONG ENOUGH.

533
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:12,324
LOOK WHAT I
ACCOMPLISHED IN A WEEK,
AND WITHOUT COMPUTERS.

534
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:15,627
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A MATH TEST COMING UP.

535
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,930
ONE WEEK.

536
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,801
I SAY IF YOU DON'T
SET DEADLINES,
NOTHING HAPPENS.

537
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,370
CAN I ASK MY DAD
FOR HELP?

538
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,272
IN MATH, SURE.

539
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,442
WHAT ABOUT SHINGO?
CAN HE HELP ME?

540
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,577
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND?

541
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,013
YEAH, SHINGO CAN HELP.

542
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:37,583
WE'LL DO
THE BEST WE CAN.

543
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,385
WE'LL REALLY TRY.

544
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:44,123
I DON'T SEE WHY
YOU HAVE TO
HAVE IT SO FAST.

545
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,262
TRACY?

546
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,699
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

547
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:56,702
NOTHING. UM, NOBODY.

548
00:28:56,702 --> 00:28:59,138
YOU WERE JUST
TALKING TO SOMEONE.

549
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:03,209
THAT? OH, I WAS TALKING
BACK TO THE TELEVISION.

550
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,979
THE SET ISN'T EVEN ON.

551
00:29:06,979 --> 00:29:08,214
I TURNED IT OFF.

552
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:10,182
IT WAS SOME DUMB
COMMERCIAL.

553
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,252
THEY'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO SELL
YOU SOMETHING.

554
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,755
HOW ABOUT, "YOU CAN
BE SURE IF IT'S GOD"?

555
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,758
NO, IT HAS
TO BE ORIGINAL.

556
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,627
WE'VE BEEN AT IT
FOR HOURS.

557
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:23,162
LET'S GO HOME.
I'M STARVED.

558
00:29:23,162 --> 00:29:26,032
WAIT! I THINK I'M
ON TO SOMETHING.

559
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,666
I LIKE IT. LET'S GO.

560
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,768
I DIDN'T SAY IT YET.

561
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,840
HOW ABOUT,
"BUY GOD. B-U-Y"?

562
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,474
GREAT. LET'S GO.

563
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,043
NAH,
IT'S TOO COMMERCIAL.

564
00:29:37,043 --> 00:29:38,410
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

565
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,013
YOU KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN I DO.

566
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,714
HOW ABOUT, "TRY GOD"?

567
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,850
GREAT.

568
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,851
"GOOD GOD."

569
00:29:44,851 --> 00:29:45,952
THAT'S EVEN GREATER.

570
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,153
"GREAT GOD."

571
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:47,954
PERFECT!

572
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,157
NO, IT JUST MISSES.

573
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,925
HOW COME EVERYTHING
JUST MISSES?

574
00:29:52,925 --> 00:29:54,593
I DON'T KNOW.

575
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:56,195
IT'S JUST A GUT FEELING.

576
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,664
THAT'S AN ADVERTISING
EXPRESSION.

577
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,566
I'VE GOT
A GUT FEELING, TOO.

578
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,101
I'M HUNGRY.

579
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,003
WE'LL THINK GOD
TOMORROW.

580
00:30:04,003 --> 00:30:06,072
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

581
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:07,806
I SAID WE'LL
THINK GOD TOMORROW.

582
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,807
THAT'S IT!

583
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,842
WHAT'S IT?

584
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:11,077
THINK GOD! THINK GOD!

585
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:12,945
THAT'S A TERRIFIC SLOGAN!

586
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:15,147
OH, SHINGO,
YOU SAVED THE DAY.

587
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,583
"THINK GOD."
HE'LL LOVE IT.

588
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,691
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

589
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,760
WHO IS SHE TALKING TO?

590
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,498
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT KID.

591
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:36,202
IT'S THE SECOND
TIME I'VE SEEN
HER DO THAT.

592
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,271
HARRIET, LOOK AT THE WAY
SHE'S CARRYING ON.

593
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:40,973
POOR TRACY.

594
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,808
POOR PAULA.

595
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,844
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE HER MOTHER.

596
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,518
THINK GOD. HMM. YEAH.

597
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,620
THINK GOD.

598
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,388
VERY INTERESTING.

599
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,991
IT'S GOT A MESSAGE,
IT'S SHORT,

600
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:01,593
AND TELLS IT ALL.

601
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,931
TRACY, I REALLY LIKE IT.

602
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:07,099
THANK GOD.

603
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:10,202
THAT'S GOOD, TOO,
BUT LET'S GO
WITH "THINK GOD."

604
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,004
SHINGO CAME UP
WITH THAT ONE.

605
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,572
I HAD A HUNCH HE WOULD.

606
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,708
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO SPREAD
THE SLOGAN AROUND?

607
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,311
YOU'VE DONE SUCH
A GOOD JOB,

608
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,013
I'M GOING
TO HAVE YOU DO IT.

609
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,016
ME? I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

610
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:26,152
WHY NOT START
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

611
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:28,754
BUT A WHOLE BIG
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN?

612
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,156
HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

613
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:31,890
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.

614
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,292
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

615
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:35,061
WHY DON'T YOU
PICK ON SOMEBODY

616
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,163
WHO ISN'T BEHIND
IN HER HOMEWORK?

617
00:31:37,163 --> 00:31:39,898
I'VE PICKED ON
SOME GOOD PEOPLE.

618
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,768
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
TO BE IN THEIR COMPANY.

619
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,470
WELL, OK.

620
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,507
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NOT EXACTLY EASY
TO TURN DOWN.

621
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,113
SO THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE GOT TO DO--

622
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,648
WRITE "THINK GOD"
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

623
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,985
ON WALLS, ON SIDEWALKS,

624
00:31:58,985 --> 00:32:01,587
WE'VE GOT TO STICK SIGNS
ON TREES,

625
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:05,191
CAR BUMPERS,
TELEPHONE POLES,
EVERYWHERE.

626
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:08,627
WE WANT IT ALL OVER.
"THINK GOD."

627
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:09,996
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

628
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,063
WHAT?

629
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,631
I THINK
YOU'RE A LOONY.

630
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:14,933
[LAUGHTER]

631
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,136
IF I'M GOING
TO WRITE ON WALLS,

632
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,071
I'M NOT WRITING
"THINK GOD."

633
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:21,273
THE THINGS
YOU WRITE ON WALLS

634
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,575
WOULD FOG UP
YOUR GLASSES.

635
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,412
COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET TRACY TALK.

636
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:29,215
LISTEN.
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

637
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,950
WE ALL TAKE GOD
TOO MUCH FOR GRANTED.

638
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,486
WE SHOULD REMIND PEOPLE
TO THINK ABOUT HIM.

639
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,356
IF NOT FOR HIM,
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

640
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,791
THAT WILL SHAKE UP
MY PARENTS.

641
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,993
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

642
00:32:40,993 --> 00:32:43,095
I THINK TRACY'S GOT
A NEAT IDEA.

643
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:44,830
LET'S DO SOMETHING GOOD
FOR A CHANGE.

644
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,200
LET'S VOTE. ALL IN FAVOR,
RAISE YOUR HANDS.

645
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,535
YAY!
YAY!
YAY!
YAY!

646
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,103
WHAT IS THIS?

647
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,105
WHAT ARE WE,
RELIGIOUS FREAKS?

648
00:32:53,105 --> 00:32:55,507
NEXT YOU'LL HAVE US
SHAVING OUR HEADS.

649
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,509
I'VE HEARD
SOME DUMB IDEAS,

650
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,445
I'VE HEARD SOME
CRAZY IDEAS,

651
00:32:59,445 --> 00:33:01,947
BUT THIS ONE
TAKES THE CAKE,

652
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,349
AND IT SHOULD
TAKE THE CAKE

653
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:06,385
BECAUSE IT'S THE GREATEST
IDEA I EVER HEARD.

654
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:09,388
LET'S GET TOGETHER
AND PUT THIS THING OVER.

655
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:11,723
LET'S GO!
YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!

656
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,692
WHAT MADE ME
SAY THAT?

657
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:18,257
HEY! HEY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

658
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:21,493
GO ON, GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE.

659
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:45,284
THERE. NOW,
THAT LOOKS BETTER.

660
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,517
TRACY?

661
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,319
YES?

662
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,255
TRACY, I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

663
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58,657
CAN'T IT WAIT?
I'M AWFUL HUNGRY.

664
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,560
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

665
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,297
GOT THE NOTE
FROM MISS HUDSON, HUH?

666
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:06,698
SIT DOWN.

667
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,100
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

668
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,703
I'LL CATCH UP
ON MY HOMEWORK.

669
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,172
TRACY, SIT DOWN.

670
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,907
WHEN IS DINNER?

671
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:17,276
PARK IT.

672
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,515
TRACY...

673
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:29,054
HARRIET STOPPED BY
THE OFFICE TODAY,

674
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:33,925
AND SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE SAW YOU
TALKING TO YOURSELF

675
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:35,527
AT THE RED DRAGON,

676
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:38,163
THAT YOU WERE DOING
THE SAME THING
AT McDONALD'S.

677
00:36:38,163 --> 00:36:39,465
WHAT'S GOING ON?

678
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:42,067
I WASN'T TALKING
TO MYSELF.

679
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,270
WHO WERE YOU
TALKING TO?

680
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,940
WAS IT THE SAME
PERSON YOU WERE
TALKING TO

681
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,776
THE OTHER NIGHT?

682
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,881
TRACY?

683
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,783
YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.

684
00:36:57,783 --> 00:36:59,351
I WILL.

685
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:03,355
GOD.

686
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:06,325
WHAT'S GOD
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

687
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:09,861
HE'S THE ONE
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO.

688
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,831
OH, GOD.

689
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:16,602
OH, GOD.

690
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,470
YOU MEAN YOU'VE
BEEN PRAYING TO GOD,

691
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,838
SORT OF OUT LOUD?

692
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:22,908
NO. HE TALKS TO ME,
AND I TALK TO HIM.

693
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:26,512
YOU MEAN, YOU
ACTUALLY HEARD HIM?

694
00:37:26,512 --> 00:37:28,046
SURE, I HEARD HIM.

695
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,715
HE WAS IN THE DEN.

696
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:39,057
YOU MEAN
YOU SAW HIM, TOO?

697
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,859
UH-HUH.

698
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45,497
OH, TRACY.

699
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:48,367
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

700
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,402
YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS,
HONEY.

701
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:53,372
PEOPLE JUST DON'T
SEE AND CHAT WITH GOD.

702
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:56,274
MOM, I SAW HIM,
LOTS OF TIMES.

703
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,844
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

704
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,149
SHINGO,
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT I CAN'T TALK.

705
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:06,284
I'M TRYING TO DO
MY HOMEWORK.

706
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,853
HOMEWORK?
WHO'S DOING HOMEWORK?

707
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,988
WE'RE PRINTING,
PAINTING, AND POSTING.

708
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:12,190
MY COUSINS ARE DOING IT
AT THEIR SCHOOL.

709
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,459
IT'S SPREADING.

710
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,526
THAT'S GREAT.

711
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,061
THAT'S JUST
FANTASTIC.

712
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,896
KEEP UP
THE GOOD WORK.

713
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,164
YOU CAN TAKE OVER.

714
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,532
YOU STARTED IT!

715
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,302
I KNOW, BUT YOU
CAN FINISH IT.
GOODBYE, SHINGO.

716
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,405
WAIT. TRACY, I--

717
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:34,245
OH, HI.

718
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,048
TRACY, YOU CAN'T QUIT.

719
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,050
I JUST DID.

720
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,852
YOU'RE OFF
TO A GREAT START.

721
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:43,822
YOU'RE DOING A SUPER JOB
FOR A GREAT CAUSE.

722
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,458
AND GETTING INTO
SUPER TROUBLE.

723
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,061
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

724
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,764
THERE ARE SOME HEAVY
HITTERS IN THAT LINEUP.

725
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:56,101
SOCRATES,
MARTIN LUTHER KING,

726
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:59,004
MAHATMA GANDHI,
ABE LINCOLN.

727
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:00,338
I'M JUST A KID.

728
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:04,876
I TOLD MY MOM,
AND NOW SHE THINKS
I'M BANANAS.

729
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,812
IT NEVER FAILS.

730
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,147
SHE'S REALLY UPTIGHT
ABOUT IT.

731
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,417
BANANAS. I HATE
THAT EXPRESSION.

732
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,485
I MAKE A BEAUTIFUL FRUIT,

733
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,353
AND PEOPLE USE IT
FOR CRAZY.

734
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,723
MY TEACHER'S
ON MY BACK, TOO.

735
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:21,427
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY,
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANY HOMEWORK.

736
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:23,028
LET ME SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

737
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:26,498
ABOUT A ZILLION PROBLEMS
TO MAKE UP, THAT'S ALL.

738
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:29,735
LET ME SEE. MAYBE
I CAN HELP YOU.

739
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:36,307
MATHEMATICS.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

740
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:39,377
I SHOULD HAVE
MADE THE WHOLE
THING EASIER.

741
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,580
YOU MAKE MISTAKES?

742
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,649
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

743
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:46,652
I BLEW IT
WITH THE DEAD SEA.

744
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:49,655
ALL THAT SALT
AND NO LIFE IN IT.

745
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,256
AND THE FLAMINGO--

746
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,524
BEAUTIFUL BIRD,

747
00:39:52,524 --> 00:39:55,060
AND I PUT THE KNEECAPS
ON BACKWARDS.

748
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,429
AND I COULD HAVE
FOUND A BETTER WAY

749
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,598
FOR A SKUNK
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

750
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:03,068
AND YOU SURE GOOFED
WITH THE GIRAFFE.

751
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,670
GIRAFFE?

752
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,672
WHY'D YOU MAKE
THE NECK SO LONG?

753
00:40:06,672 --> 00:40:09,508
SO HE COULD
EAT THE LEAVES
OFF THE TREES.

754
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,910
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE
THE TREES SHORTER?

755
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:15,514
WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN I NEEDED YOU?

756
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,415
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

757
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,950
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

758
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,752
I KNOW, IT'S AWFUL.

759
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,688
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

760
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,823
SHE WAS ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGELY.

761
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:28,393
YES. SHE WAS ASKING
ME SOME QUESTIONS

762
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,562
ABOUT GOD
AND HOW I'D HANDLE

763
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,830
AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FOR HIM.

764
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,099
I DIDN'T THINK
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

765
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,702
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENS.

766
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:39,037
DO YOU SUPPOSE
SHE'S MAKING IT UP,

767
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,573
YOU KNOW, AS A PLAY
FOR ATTENTION?

768
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,108
OH, COME ON, DON.

769
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,611
IF TRACY'S ONE THING,
SHE'S TRUTHFUL.

770
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:48,514
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
EVER TOLD A LIE.

771
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,986
I'M SORRY
I WAS SO CRABBY.

772
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,387
I UNDERSTAND.

773
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,056
HERE'S
YOUR HOMEWORK.

774
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,961
WOW. THANKS.

775
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:03,995
GOD.

776
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:05,230
YEAH?

777
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,965
WHO DO YOU
PRAY TO?

778
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:13,438
ME? WELL, SOMETIMES
I TALK TO MYSELF.

779
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:16,041
IT MUST BE REAL
LONESOME UP THERE.

780
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,342
WELL, WHEN I SNEEZE,

781
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,978
THERE'S NO ONE AROUND
TO BLESS ME.

782
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,146
TRACY!

783
00:41:21,146 --> 00:41:23,414
UH-OH,
NOW IT'S MY DAD.

784
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,050
I'VE GOT TO GO.

785
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:29,955
AND BLESS YOU, GOD.

786
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,257
THAT'S FOR
YOUR NEXT SNEEZE.

787
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:40,365
MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE MADE THE TREES
A LITTLE SHORTER.

788
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,499
HI, DADDY.

789
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,234
HI, SWEETHEART.

790
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,904
HOW'S MY BABY?

791
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,072
OK.

792
00:41:55,313 --> 00:41:56,648
SO, UH...

793
00:41:56,648 --> 00:41:58,249
MOM TOLD YOU, HUH?

794
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,386
LOOK, UM...

795
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:03,321
SWEETHEART...

796
00:42:03,321 --> 00:42:06,524
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
PEOPLE IMAGINE THINGS,

797
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,626
UH...

798
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,460
KIDS IN PARTICULAR.

799
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,129
I DIDN'T IMAGINE IT.

800
00:42:11,129 --> 00:42:13,498
IT SEEMS SO REAL.

801
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:15,533
IT REALLY SEEMS
LIKE IT HAPPENED.

802
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,803
I TALKED TO HIM.
HE TALKED TO ME.

803
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:20,572
YOUR IMAGINATION
JUST RUNS RIGHT
AWAY FROM YOU.

804
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:23,541
DADDY, I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

805
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,744
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BELIEVE,

806
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:27,278
BUT IT HAPPENED.

807
00:42:29,447 --> 00:42:30,949
IT HAPPENED?

808
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:32,550
UH...

809
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,587
LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

810
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:38,089
YOU'RE SAYING YOU
ACTUALLY SAW GOD,

811
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:40,692
I MEAN,
AS A REAL PERSON?

812
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,560
LOTS OF TIMES.

813
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,697
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

814
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,566
HE JUST HELPED ME
WITH MY MATH.

815
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,235
OH, MY GOD.

816
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:53,839
GOD WAS UPSTAIRS HELPING YOU
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK?

817
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,174
YEAH.
HERE IT IS.

818
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,111
UM...

819
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:03,048
WELL, THIS MULTIPLICATION
IS VERY GOOD,

820
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:07,218
BUT, TRACY, SWEETHEART,
THESE ARE YOUR NUMBERS.

821
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,453
THAT'S YOUR WRITING.

822
00:43:08,453 --> 00:43:10,989
THAT WAS EASY
FOR HIM TO DO.

823
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,259
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
IT WOULD BE.

824
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,426
UM...

825
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,362
RIGHT. WELL, UM...

826
00:43:17,362 --> 00:43:20,265
OK. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
LATER, ALL RIGHT?

827
00:43:20,265 --> 00:43:22,734
WHY DON'T YOU, UM...

828
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,602
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK UPSTAIRS

829
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,204
AND FINISH YOUR...

830
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,807
YOUR STUDYING, OK?

831
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:40,351
BUT YOU BOTH THINK
I'M BANANAS.

832
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:44,923
OH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID THAT.

833
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,292
HE HATES THAT EXPRESSION.

834
00:43:57,368 --> 00:44:01,506
WHAT THE HELL
HAS BEEN GOING ON HERE
SINCE I LEFT?

835
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,241
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

836
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,743
IF YOU SPENT LESS TIME

837
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,111
PEDDLING THOSE
OVERPRICED HOUSES,

838
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,645
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED.

839
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,715
I'VE NEVER NEGLECTED
THAT CHILD,

840
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,549
AND YOU KNOW IT.

841
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:14,052
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO MOVED OUT.
YOU ARE.

842
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:15,821
LET'S NOT
GET INTO THAT.

843
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,322
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

844
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,225
I'LL TAKE HER
TO A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST.

845
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:21,259
NO!

846
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:22,527
NO WAY. NEVER.

847
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:25,263
PAULA, SHE NEEDS HELP.

848
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,664
LOOK.

849
00:44:27,866 --> 00:44:30,101
YOU TAKE CARE
OF BOOBS,

850
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,203
AND I WILL TAKE CARE
OF TRACY.

851
00:44:32,203 --> 00:44:36,007
WE'RE NOT HERE TO ARGUE.
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

852
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,475
WHAT ABOUT A MINISTER?

853
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:38,877
HE COULD AT LEAST--

854
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:43,381
LOOK. WHY DO WE HAVE
TO TAKE HER TO ANYBODY?

855
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,784
I MEAN...

856
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:48,854
MAYBE IT'S NOT ALL
THAT BAD, YOU KNOW?

857
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:51,957
SHE'S OURS.
CAN'T WE...

858
00:44:51,957 --> 00:44:54,993
CAN'T WE JUST
WORK IT OUT OURSELVES?

859
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,566
OK. GIVE IT
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

860
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:05,536
MAYBE SHE'LL JUST
SNAP OUT OF IT.

861
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,205
I'LL CALL YOU.

862
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,144
GOD HELPED HER
WITH HER HOMEWORK.

863
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:15,847
TERRIFIC.
JUST TERRIFIC.

864
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,415
[BELL RINGS]

865
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,083
WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON AROUND HERE?

866
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:26,985
EVERYWHERE I LOOK,
"THINK GOD."

867
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,453
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

868
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,321
OH, IT'S TRACY RICHARDS.

869
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,891
WHO'S TRACY RICHARDS?
WHAT GRADE IS SHE IN?

870
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,026
SHE'S IN
MISS HUDSON'S CLASS.

871
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:37,829
GET HER IN HERE
AND MISS HUDSON, TOO.

872
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:40,832
I'LL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

873
00:46:40,832 --> 00:46:44,502
ARE WE RUNNING
A SCHOOL OR A MONASTERY?

874
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,956
UH, NOW,
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

875
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:07,525
SINCE THIS IS
A BEHAVIOR PROBLEM,

876
00:47:07,525 --> 00:47:10,929
I'VE ASKED DR. YOUNG,
OUR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST,

877
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,231
TO, UH...SIT IN.

878
00:47:13,231 --> 00:47:15,901
SHE'S A LITTLE BEHIND
IN HER HOMEWORK, BUT--

879
00:47:15,901 --> 00:47:18,636
OH, IT'S WAY BEYOND THAT,
MRS. RICHARDS.

880
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:22,240
HAVE YOU SEEN ALL THOSE
"THINK GOD" SIGNS AROUND?

881
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,444
WELL, TRACY IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE WHOLE THING.

882
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:29,414
SHE HELD A MEETING,
GOT KIDS WORKED UP.

883
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:32,183
NOW THEY'RE ALL
RUNNING AROUND WRITING,

884
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:34,719
TACKING UP SIGNS.

885
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,654
WHAT, EXACTLY,
IS SO AWFUL

886
00:47:36,654 --> 00:47:38,389
ABOUT WRITING
"THINK GOD"?

887
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,624
I MEAN--

888
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:43,261
YEAH, I MEAN,
IF KIDS ARE GOING
TO WRITE ON WALLS,

889
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:46,264
THEY MIGHT AS WELL
WRITE SOMETHING NICE.

890
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:48,766
I AGREE,
BUT THE POINT IS,

891
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:52,037
RELIGION IN THE SCHOOLS
IS A VERY SENSITIVE AREA.

892
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:53,404
IT IS NOT ALLOWED.

893
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:56,441
SHE'S GOT THE WHOLE PLACE
IN AN UPROAR.

894
00:47:56,441 --> 00:47:58,843
SHE'S DISRUPTED
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

895
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:00,678
SHE'S NEVER BEEN
A TROUBLEMAKER.

896
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,614
SHE'S CERTAINLY MAKING UP
FOR IT THIS TIME.

897
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,017
I HAD A TALK WITH HER.

898
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:08,920
I TOLD HER
TO CUT ALL THIS OUT.

899
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:10,721
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T.

900
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,657
SHE COULDN'T?

901
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:14,625
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

902
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:18,363
WOULD YOU
BRING IN TRACY, PLEASE?

903
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,367
IF YOU CAN'T GET HER
TO COOPERATE,

904
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:25,937
I'LL SIMPLY HAVE TO
SUSPEND HER FROM SCHOOL.

905
00:48:30,976 --> 00:48:32,243
I'M SORRY.

906
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:35,180
TRACY, WOULD YOU
SIT DOWN, PLEASE?

907
00:48:38,716 --> 00:48:42,120
YOUR PARENTS WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

908
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:54,265
TRACY...

909
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:59,070
YOU REALLY
HAVE TO COOPERATE.

910
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:01,772
I MEAN,
MR. BENSON IS RIGHT.

911
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,442
YOU'VE DISRUPTED
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

912
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:08,013
WELL, UNLESS
THIS THING STOPS,

913
00:49:08,013 --> 00:49:09,447
THEY'RE GOING TO
SUSPEND YOU.

914
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:12,150
YOU DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN,
DO YOU, SWEETHEART?

915
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:20,591
OK, MOM.

916
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:22,493
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

917
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:25,596
I'LL TELL THE KIDS
TO CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF.

918
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,700
WELL, NOW,
THAT'S ALL WE ASK.

919
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:35,040
ALL RIGHT, TRACY. YOU CAN
GO BACK TO CLASS NOW.

920
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,607
THANK YOU, MR. BENSON.

921
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:37,742
BYE, MOMMY.

922
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:38,943
GOODBYE,
SWEETHEART.

923
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,378
SEE YOU SATURDAY,
DADDY.

924
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:41,646
BYE, BABY.

925
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,852
BUT BEFORE I TELL
THE KIDS TO STOP,

926
00:49:47,852 --> 00:49:49,687
I HAVE TO ASK HIM.

927
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,024
ASK WHO?

928
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:56,561
ASK WHO, TRACY?

929
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,672
GOD.

930
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:09,607
OH, GOD.

931
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:14,412
HE'S THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THIS?

932
00:50:14,412 --> 00:50:18,683
YEAH. IT WAS PART
HIS IDEA AND PART MINE.

933
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,385
OH.

934
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,453
WHEN YOU TALKED TO HIM,

935
00:50:22,453 --> 00:50:24,722
DID HE TALK
TO YOU, TOO?

936
00:50:24,722 --> 00:50:27,492
YES. HE TALKED
TO ME FIRST.

937
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,394
I SEE.

938
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,296
WE TALKED
QUITE A FEW TIMES.

939
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:33,564
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME?

940
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:37,034
THE FIRST TIME
I TALKED TO HIM
OR SAW HIM?

941
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:39,036
YOU SAW HIM?

942
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,839
SURE.

943
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,774
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

944
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,344
WELL, HE WEARS GLASSES,

945
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,379
AND HE'S GOT GRAY HAIR,

946
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:51,182
AND HE'S A VERY
NICE-LOOKING MAN.

947
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,351
I'M SURE.

948
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:58,323
HOW DID YOU
FIRST MEET HIM?

949
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,226
IN A CHINESE RESTAURANT.

950
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:05,096
HE SENT ME A MESSAGE
IN A FORTUNE COOKIE.

951
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:07,898
UH...

952
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,267
TRACY, WOULD YOU, UH...

953
00:51:09,267 --> 00:51:12,670
WAIT OUT
IN THE HALL, PLEASE?

954
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,282
YOUR CHILD NEEDS HELP.

955
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:27,218
SHE IS OUT OF TOUCH
WITH REALITY.

956
00:51:27,218 --> 00:51:28,819
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

957
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,888
I HAVE MY
RESPONSIBILITY.

958
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:33,758
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS,
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

959
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:38,196
BUT, AS OF NOW,
TRACY IS SUSPENDED
FROM SCHOOL.

960
00:51:38,196 --> 00:51:39,797
FOR HOW LONG?

961
00:51:39,797 --> 00:51:41,432
UNTIL SHE'S WELL.

962
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:46,003
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT,
SUSPENDING TRACY?

963
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:49,073
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

964
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:50,508
IF THEY'RE GOING
TO THROW HER OUT,

965
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:52,009
WHY DON'T THEY
THROW US OUT?

966
00:51:52,009 --> 00:51:53,711
WE'VE ALL BEEN WRITING
"THINK GOD."

967
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,346
WHAT WILL WE DO?

968
00:51:55,346 --> 00:51:57,915
WE WON'T TAKE IT
LYING DOWN.

969
00:51:57,915 --> 00:52:00,451
WE'LL FIGHT BACK.

970
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:07,358
AND ANOTHER THING,

971
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:09,927
EVERYBODY IS TRYING
TO HELP ME.

972
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,329
I DON'T NEED HELP.

973
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:12,963
I FEEL FINE.

974
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,365
I'M PERFECTLY NORMAL.

975
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:16,767
YOU OUGHT TO BE
PROUD OF ME.

976
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:19,504
NOT EVERYBODY
GETS PICKED BY GOD.

977
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:21,772
I'M IN
A PRETTY GOOD CLUB--

978
00:52:21,772 --> 00:52:25,210
SOCRATES, ABE LINCOLN,
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

979
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:37,555
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

980
00:52:37,555 --> 00:52:40,758
THE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU FIRST.

981
00:52:43,594 --> 00:52:46,764
WE'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE, BABY.

982
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:57,074
HIYA, TRACY.

983
00:52:57,074 --> 00:52:58,476
OH, HELLO.

984
00:52:58,476 --> 00:53:01,246
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU WERE
GOING TO SHOW UP.

985
00:53:01,246 --> 00:53:02,613
EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL,

986
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,350
AND NOW YOU'RE A LITTLE
UPSET ABOUT THIS?

987
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,485
NO. I'M FINE.

988
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:10,555
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
A LITTLE UPSET.

989
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:13,558
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A LOT TO DO,

990
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:16,627
BUT YOU WOULDN'T FORGET
ABOUT ME, WOULD YOU?

991
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:19,830
WELL, YOU ARE
A LITTLE WORRIED,
AREN'T YOU?

992
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,099
I GUESS I AM.

993
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,334
LET ME...

994
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,603
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE STORY.

995
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:28,539
THERE WAS THIS TIGER
IN THE JUNGLE,

996
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,075
AND HE GOT A THORN
IN HIS PAW.

997
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:32,377
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL.

998
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:34,812
THIS LITTLE CAT
SAW THIS

999
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:37,515
AND PULLED THE THORN
OUT OF HIS PAW.

1000
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:40,017
THIS MADE THE TIGER
VERY HAPPY.

1001
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:43,120
THE CAT SAYS, "I'VE
DONE YOU A FAVOR.

1002
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,355
YOU DO ME ONE."

1003
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:46,156
THE TIGER SAYS,
"ANYTHING."

1004
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,693
THE CAT SAYS,
"WHENEVER I'M
IN THE JUNGLE,

1005
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,795
I'M SCARED
OF THE ANIMALS."

1006
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,230
THE TIGER SAYS,
"NO PROBLEM.

1007
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,500
"WHEN YOU WALK
THROUGH THE JUNGLE,

1008
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,767
"HOLD YOUR HEAD UP,

1009
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,636
"SHAKE IT,
WAG YOUR TAIL,

1010
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:01,306
AND THEY'LL THINK
YOU'RE A TIGER."

1011
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:05,343
THE LITTLE CAT
GOT AWAY WITH IT
FOR THREE YEARS.

1012
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:08,913
ONE DAY SHE MET
THE TIGER.

1013
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,916
SHE WAS
SHAKING HER HEAD,
WAGGING HER TAIL.

1014
00:54:11,916 --> 00:54:16,086
THE TIGER SAYS,
"YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SHAKE AND WAG AT ME.

1015
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,855
I KNOW
YOU'RE A CAT."

1016
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,694
THAT'S IT?

1017
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:25,095
THAT'S IT.

1018
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,332
WHAT'S THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

1019
00:54:27,332 --> 00:54:29,199
NOTHING.
IT'S A CUTE STORY.

1020
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,337
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
CHEER YOU UP.

1021
00:54:34,372 --> 00:54:36,941
THAT'S BETTER.

1022
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,644
YOU'VE BEEN SEPARATED
SEVEN MONTHS, RIGHT?

1023
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:41,011
YES.

1024
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:42,780
FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID,

1025
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,316
TRACY'S CONTACTS
WITH GOD

1026
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:48,085
USUALLY TAKE PLACE
IN EATING AREAS.

1027
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,454
THE CHINESE RESTAURANT,

1028
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,756
McDONALD'S,
AN ICE CREAM CART.

1029
00:54:51,756 --> 00:54:55,125
THEY'VE ALL TAKEN PLACE
SINCE YOU, MR. RICHARDS,

1030
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,128
LEFT THE HOUSE
FOLLOWING YOUR SEPARATION.

1031
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,798
SO, OBVIOUSLY,

1032
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,301
TRACY HAS CREATED
A FANTASY FATHER FIGURE

1033
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,603
AS A SUBSTITUTE

1034
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:07,572
TO GIVE HER
THE EMOTIONAL NURTURING

1035
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:10,307
SHE CRAVES
FROM HER MISSING FATHER.

1036
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,609
ARE YOU SURE?

1037
00:55:11,609 --> 00:55:14,044
ONE IS NEVER
COMPLETELY SURE,

1038
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,180
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SAID

1039
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,815
THAT'S VERY INTRIGUING.

1040
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:20,818
TRACY'S FANTASY FATHER,
GOD,

1041
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,888
LIKE HER REAL FATHER,
IS INTERESTED IN ADVERTISING

1042
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:26,924
OR SPREADING A MESSAGE,
SO TO SPEAK.

1043
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:28,726
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

1044
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,861
WELL, THESE ARE
ONLY THEORIES.

1045
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,964
I'LL HAVE TO GIVE TRACY
A SERIES OF TESTS

1046
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,299
TO VERIFY THEM.

1047
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,034
BRING BACK TRACY!

1048
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,669
BRING BACK TRACY!

1049
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,005
BRING BACK TRACY!

1050
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,607
BRING BACK TRACY!

1051
00:55:42,607 --> 00:55:44,542
BRING BACK TRACY!

1052
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:46,577
BRING BACK TRACY!

1053
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:48,278
BRING BACK TRACY!

1054
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:50,347
BRING BACK TRACY!

1055
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,016
BRING BACK TRACY!

1056
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,951
BRING BACK TRACY!

1057
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:21,979
OOH!

1058
00:56:21,979 --> 00:56:23,581
OW.

1059
00:56:23,581 --> 00:56:27,384
WHAT'S YOUR FIRST MEMORY
INVOLVING A PERSON?

1060
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,921
I CAN REMEMBER MY DAD
PEELING AN APPLE.

1061
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,982
NOW, TODAY,
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

1062
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:36,153
IF THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE
OR IMAGINARY CHARACTERS.

1063
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:38,322
ROBERT REDFORD.

1064
00:57:38,322 --> 00:57:40,190
HE'S REAL.

1065
00:57:41,526 --> 00:57:43,160
GEORGE WASHINGTON.

1066
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,029
WAS HE REAL?

1067
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:46,463
OF COURSE.

1068
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,602
BUGS BUNNY.

1069
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,604
REAL OR IMAGINARY?

1070
00:57:53,604 --> 00:57:55,973
OH, COME ON, DOCTOR.

1071
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,643
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THESE SLIDES

1072
00:57:58,643 --> 00:58:00,477
AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU SEE?

1073
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,516
EGG FOO YUNG.

1074
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:12,456
OK. WHAT ABOUT THIS?

1075
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:14,825
SHRIMP IN LOBSTER SAUCE.

1076
00:58:17,528 --> 00:58:19,296
AND THIS?

1077
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:21,098
SPAGHETTI.

1078
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,233
"THE TASTE OF MAMA."

1079
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:26,003
YOU SEEM TO ASSOCIATE
EVERYTHING WITH FOOD.

1080
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,505
THAT SEEMS
VERY SIGNIFICANT.

1081
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,175
IT COULD ALSO BE
I'M STARVED.

1082
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,180
AH.

1083
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,883
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE

1084
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,552
OF ANY ORGANIC DISTURBANCE
IN TRACY.

1085
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:42,987
OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

1086
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:46,557
HOWEVER, THE EVALUATION
IN THE BEHAVIORAL AREA

1087
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:49,059
IS NOT ENCOURAGING.

1088
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,729
TRACY IS STILL
STEADFASTLY INSISTING

1089
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:54,832
THAT SHE'S ACTUALLY SEEN
AND SPOKEN WITH GOD...

1090
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,134
A DELUSION
THAT INDICATES

1091
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:59,069
A REAL PSYCHOSIS.

1092
00:58:59,069 --> 00:59:00,738
PSYCHOSIS?

1093
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:02,106
I'M AFRAID SO.

1094
00:59:03,273 --> 00:59:06,811
WHAT TRACY NEEDS IS
OBSERVATION AND TREATMENT.

1095
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:09,914
NOW, WE HAVE A FINE PLACE
IN SANTA BARBARA

1096
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:11,616
WHERE SHE'LL GET
EXPERT CARE.

1097
00:59:11,616 --> 00:59:12,983
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT--

1098
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:16,621
WAIT. YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
SUGGESTING THAT...

1099
00:59:16,621 --> 00:59:19,657
THAT SHE BE PUT
IN AN INSTITUTION,
ARE YOU?

1100
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:21,826
DON'T LET THAT WORD
BOTHER YOU.

1101
00:59:21,826 --> 00:59:24,361
A BANK
IS AN INSTITUTION.

1102
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:25,796
A SCHOOL, A SUPERMARKET,

1103
00:59:25,796 --> 00:59:27,965
EVERYTHING
IS AN INSTITUTION.

1104
00:59:27,965 --> 00:59:31,035
THE FACT IS,
THIS IS A NICE, PLEASANT

1105
00:59:31,035 --> 00:59:33,671
CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT
WITH A TRAINED STAFF.

1106
00:59:33,671 --> 00:59:36,106
SHE'LL BE MUCH
BETTER OFF THERE.

1107
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,942
AND...

1108
00:59:37,942 --> 00:59:40,645
SHE HAS TO BE THERE.

1109
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:48,385
IT'S, UM...

1110
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:51,355
IT'S A KIND OF RANCH
IN SANTA BARBARA,
SWEETHEART,

1111
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:52,990
ONLY, UH...

1112
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,560
YOU WON'T HAVE TO GO
FOR AT LEAST
TWO DAYS.

1113
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:59,196
AND YOU'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

1114
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:02,532
DON'T BE SO UPTIGHT.
I'M NOT WORRIED.

1115
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:04,601
THAT'S A GOOD ATTITUDE.

1116
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,871
YOU'RE A VERY BRIGHT
YOUNG LADY.

1117
01:00:06,871 --> 01:00:11,175
GOD WOULD NEVER LET THEM
PUT ME INTO AN INSTITUTION.

I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU

1436
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:03,893
THAT THERE'S A GREAT
DEAL OF SYMPATHY

1437
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:05,094
FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL.

1438
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:06,562
MANY CHILDREN
ARE OUT OF SCHOOL.

1439
01:21:06,562 --> 01:21:09,999
OUR PROFESSION WILL BE
UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE.

1440
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:11,600
WE CAN'T
GIVE IN TO THAT.

1441
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,937
NO, WE CAN'T
GIVE IN TO THAT.

1442
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:15,471
NO, WE--WE CAN'T.

1443
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:18,841
IF WE LET HER
RUN AROUND
WITH HER DELUSIONS,

1444
01:21:18,841 --> 01:21:21,277
WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE PATIENT

1445
01:21:21,277 --> 01:21:23,412
WHO THINKS
HE'S NAPOLEON?

1446
01:21:23,412 --> 01:21:26,115
CERTAINLY.
IF SHE'S RIGHT,

1447
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:29,385
THEN, UH...
WE'RE ALL WRONG.

1448
01:21:30,286 --> 01:21:33,889
NO, THE GIRL BELONGS
IN AN INSTITUTION.

1449
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,025
NOW, ARE THERE
ANY OBJECTIONS?

1450
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:37,460
NO? THEN THAT'S
SETTLED.

1451
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:40,563
CARL, WOULD YOU BRING
THEM BACK IN, PLEASE?

1452
01:21:45,368 --> 01:21:47,036
THEY'RE READY.

1453
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:06,055
NOW, TRACY...

1454
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:10,059
WE'VE ALL DECIDED
THAT, UH, YOU NEED HELP...

1455
01:22:10,059 --> 01:22:14,197
AND, BELIEVE ME, IT'S
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

1456
01:22:14,197 --> 01:22:15,431
AND THE CHANCES ARE

1457
01:22:15,431 --> 01:22:18,401
THAT YOU WON'T BE
THERE FOR LONG.

1458
01:22:18,401 --> 01:22:21,637
IF YOU LOOK AT IT
IN A POSITIVE WAY,

1459
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:24,040
I'M SURE THAT YOU--

1460
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:29,312
It's him.
It's God.

1461
01:22:30,913 --> 01:22:33,116
SORRY I'M LATE.

1462
01:22:36,485 --> 01:22:40,123
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO
MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES.

1463
01:22:40,123 --> 01:22:41,490
I WOULD'VE BEEN
HERE SOONER,

1464
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,426
BUT I WAS STUCK
IN TRAFFIC.

1465
01:22:43,426 --> 01:22:44,660
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1466
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:46,829
WHO ARE YOU?

1467
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,231
DR. STEVENS.

1468
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:51,367
I DON'T RECALL
YOUR BEING INVITED.

1469
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:52,601
IF I WAITED
TO BE INVITED,

1470
01:22:52,601 --> 01:22:54,337
I'D MISS A LOT
OF IMPORTANT THINGS.

1471
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:55,904
HOWEVER,
IN THIS CASE,

1472
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:57,240
I THINK
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

1473
01:22:57,240 --> 01:23:01,277
BUT YOUR NAME'S
NOT ON THE LIST.
YES, IT IS.

1474
01:23:05,181 --> 01:23:06,382
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1475
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:07,883
WE'RE ALL
LEARNED PSYCHIATRISTS.

1476
01:23:07,883 --> 01:23:11,820
WHAT DID THIS LITTLE GIRL DO
THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE?

1477
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,256
SHE GOT CHILDREN TOGETHER.

1478
01:23:13,256 --> 01:23:15,224
THEY ALL WROTE
"THINK GOD,"

1479
01:23:15,224 --> 01:23:17,293
AND THE WORLD
IS THINKING GOD.

1480
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:18,961
IS THAT SO BAD?

1481
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:23,666
BUT, SIR, AS A...
LEARNED PSYCHIATRIST,

1482
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:26,169
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
THAT THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

1483
01:23:26,169 --> 01:23:27,936
THIS LITTLE GIRL
CLAIMS

1484
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:31,107
SHE NOT ONLY SAW GOD
AND SPOKE TO HIM,

1485
01:23:31,107 --> 01:23:34,210
BUT HE SPOKE
TO HER AS WELL.

1486
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,979
WHO ARE WE TO SAY
THAT SHE DIDN'T?

1487
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:39,082
MAYBE SHE DID.

1488
01:23:39,082 --> 01:23:41,117
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T.

1489
01:23:41,117 --> 01:23:43,086
LOOK, SIR,
WE'VE ALL VOTED.

1490
01:23:43,086 --> 01:23:45,888
I KNOW, AND YOU SAID
IF SHE'S RIGHT

1491
01:23:45,888 --> 01:23:48,624
THEN WE'RE ALL WRONG.

1492
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:50,093
WELL...

1493
01:23:50,093 --> 01:23:53,028
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I SAID THAT?

1494
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:55,331
I ALSO READ
TEA LEAVES.

1495
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:59,435
LOOK, I MEAN,
WE ARE COMPETENT
PROFESSIONALS.

1496
01:23:59,435 --> 01:24:01,070
WE KNOW
OUR BUSINESS.

1497
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,539
WE'VE BEEN OVER
THIS CASE BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS,

1498
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,642
AND WE HAVE MADE
OUR DECISION.

1499
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:10,213
I WOULDN'T WANT THIS
TO GET AROUND,

1500
01:24:10,213 --> 01:24:12,381
BUT, IF WE'RE
SO COMPETENT,

1501
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,783
SO RIGHT IN ALL
OUR METHODS AND THEORIES,

1502
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:17,920
HOW IS IT SO MANY PEOPLE
IN INSTITUTIONS

1503
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,322
NEVER GET OUT?

1504
01:24:19,322 --> 01:24:22,625
BUT THAT'S A SITUATION
BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

1505
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:25,561
MANY PEOPLE WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH

1506
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:27,730
BETWEEN REALITY
AND ILLUSION.

1507
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:30,399
REMEMBER, SOMETIMES
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

1508
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:32,868
TO DETERMINE WHAT IS REALITY
AND WHAT IS ILLUSION.

1509
01:24:32,868 --> 01:24:35,704
FOR INSTANCE,
THE, UH, THE CHANDELIER--

1510
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:38,807
NOW, THAT'S REALITY.

1511
01:24:38,807 --> 01:24:40,075
WE ALL LOOKED UP,

1512
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:41,210
WE ALL SAW IT.

1513
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,078
WE ALL KNOW IT'S THERE.

1514
01:24:43,078 --> 01:24:44,747
BUT IS IT?

[GASP]

1516

OH, MY GOD...

1517
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,893
IT IS GOD.

1518
01:24:57,893 --> 01:25:01,497
WHAT'S THE ILLUSION,
AND WHAT'S THE REALITY?

1519
01:25:01,497 --> 01:25:04,167
DID THE CHANDELIER
DISAPPEAR OR NOT?

1520
01:25:04,167 --> 01:25:06,302
WE'RE ALL
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE.

1521
01:25:06,302 --> 01:25:09,238
DID WE SEE IT,
OR DIDN'T WE SEE IT?

1522
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:10,439
MAYBE THAT LITTLE GIRL

1523
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:13,442
DID SEE AND TALK WITH GOD.

1524
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:16,111
WHERE IS IT WRITTEN
THAT MOSES HAD AN EXCLUSIVE?

1525
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,148
JUST BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO GOD

1526
01:25:19,148 --> 01:25:20,916
DOESN'T MEAN SHE HASN'T.

1527
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:25,020
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
OR WHO YOU ARE--

1528
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:27,656
MAYBE A MAGICIAN
OR A HYPNOTIST--

1529
01:25:27,656 --> 01:25:30,726
BUT THERE ARE SOME
THINGS I'M SURE OF.

1530
01:25:30,726 --> 01:25:33,496
I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL
PSYCHIATRISTS HERE.

1531
01:25:33,496 --> 01:25:35,798
I KNOW I'M
BENJAMIN CHARLES WHITLEY.

1532
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:37,433
I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN.

1533
01:25:37,433 --> 01:25:40,135
I PAY $2,200 A MONTH
ALIMONY.

1534
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,538
I KNOW THIS IS
THE UCLA
MEDICAL CENTER,

1535
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:45,874
AND I KNOW IT IS
11:30 IN THE MORNING.

1536
01:25:45,874 --> 01:25:47,543
DOCTOR...

1537
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:49,412
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S MORNING?

[GASP]
[GASP]

1539
01:26:01,224 --> 01:26:02,658
DOCTOR, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1540
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:05,194
IT IS 11:30
IN THE MORNING.

1541
01:26:16,572 --> 01:26:19,308
I KNOW WE'RE ALL
ANXIOUS TO GET HOME,

1542
01:26:19,308 --> 01:26:21,377
BUT BEFORE
WE JUDGE TRACY,

1543
01:26:21,377 --> 01:26:22,811
SHOULDN'T WE ALL

1544
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,147
BE A LITTLE MORE SURE
OF OURSELVES?

1545
01:26:25,147 --> 01:26:27,883
IF WE TOLD EVERYBODY
THAT WE SAW

1546
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:30,419
DAY TURN INTO NIGHT
AND NIGHT INTO DAY,

1547
01:26:30,419 --> 01:26:32,588
THEY'D THROW US
OUT OF SCHOOL, TOO.

1548
01:26:32,588 --> 01:26:36,225
SO MAYBE TRACY
DID SEE GOD.

1549
01:26:39,328 --> 01:26:42,465
MAYBE YOU'RE SEEING HIM
RIGHT NOW.

1550
01:26:42,465 --> 01:26:44,600
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT.

01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,144
THINK ABOUT IT.

1552
01:26:56,144 --> 01:26:58,347
GIVE IT
SOME THOUGHT.

01:27:25,107 --> 01:27:28,677
WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE TRACY HOME NOW.

01:27:28,677 --> 01:27:31,447
WE'VE GOT TO GET HER
READY FOR SCHOOL
IN THE MORNING.

01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:33,882
COME ON, BABY.

01:27:49,131 --> 01:27:51,266
AHEM.

I DON'T KNOW, UH,
WHETHER ANY OF US HERE

UNDERSTAND WHAT, UH...

WHAT--WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED HERE,

1563
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,779
BUT I'M
INCLINED TO THINK

1564
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:07,516
THAT IT MIGHT BE
A VERY GOOD IDEA

1565
01:28:07,516 --> 01:28:10,152
IF WE KEEP IT
TO OURSELVES.

YEAH.
YEAH.
YEAH.

VERY WELL, THEN...

IS CLOSED.

HOW ABOUT ONE
OVER HERE?

COME IN, TRACY.

FOR THE DOOR TO OPEN
BY ITSELF.

SORRY. I FORGOT.

YOU GOT MY PARENTS
TOGETHER AGAIN.

1590
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,908
NO, NO. THEY DID THAT
BY THEMSELVES.

1591
01:29:39,908 --> 01:29:43,245
AW, I BET
YOU ARRANGED
THE WHOLE THING.

1592
01:29:43,245 --> 01:29:45,213
HONEST TO ME,
I DIDN'T.

1593
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:48,917
TRACY, THE REASON
I CALLED YOU--

1594
01:29:48,917 --> 01:29:51,454
I WANT TO THANK YOU
AND ALL THE CHILDREN

1595
01:29:51,454 --> 01:29:53,489
FOR THE WONDERFUL JOB
YOU DID.

1596
01:29:53,489 --> 01:29:56,459
WILL I EVER
SEE YOU AGAIN?

1597
01:29:56,459 --> 01:29:59,462
IF I EVER HAVE
A REAL BIG PROBLEM,

1598
01:29:59,462 --> 01:30:02,030
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
I'LL CALL.

1599
01:30:02,030 --> 01:30:04,833
YOU WON'T NEED ME.
YOU'RE GOD.

1600
01:30:04,833 --> 01:30:07,402
YOU DON'T NEED
ANYBODY.

1601
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,371
GOD NEEDS EVERYONE.

1602
01:30:09,371 --> 01:30:11,874
I NEED ALL THE HELP
I CAN GET.

1603
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:21,684
GOODBYE, TRACY.

1604
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:25,954
GO AHEAD, TRACY.

1605
01:30:25,954 --> 01:30:29,825
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN COLD EGG FOO YUNG.
