1
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,058
"The movie will begin
in five moments"

2
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:59,228
the mindless voice announced.

3
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:03,899
"All those unseated
will await the next show."

4
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:08,445
We filed slowly, languidly
into the hall.

5
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,699
The auditorium was vast and silent.

6
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:17,246
As we seated and were darkened,
the voice continued.

7
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,124
"The program for this evening
is not new.

8
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,710
You've seen this entertainment
through and through.

9
00:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,879
You've seen your birth,
your life and death.

10
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,506
You might recall all of the rest.

11
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:30,259
Did you have a good world
when you died?

12
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,970
Enough to base a movie on?"

13
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:37,015
Hey, Jim, it's your birthday, man.

14
00:01:37,099 --> 00:01:40,644
What do you say
we finish this another night?

15
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:45,566
Turn the lights down a little bit more,
will you, Jay?

16
00:01:52,698 --> 00:01:56,493
Hey, man.
How come the Doors aren't in on this?

17
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,456
No music. No Doors.
Come on, let's roll.

18
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,625
Rolling.

19
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:22,728
ls everybody in?

20
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:32,070
The ceremony is about to begin.

21
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:39,453
Let me tell you about heartache...

22
00:02:39,494 --> 00:02:41,955
and the loss of God.

23
00:02:41,997 --> 00:02:46,126
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.

24
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:50,797
Out here, in the perimeter,
there are no stars.

25
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:55,427
Out here, we is stoned, immaculate.

26
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:02,976
lt's beautiful.
Look at those big, puffy clouds.

27
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,105
Hey, Jimmy.
Wake up. Look at the clouds.

28
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,858
Come on.
Wake up.

29
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,408
What's going on?

30
00:03:18,492 --> 00:03:20,661
l don't know.

31
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,885
Officer, what happened?
Can we help?

32
00:03:36,969 --> 00:03:40,138
No, sir.
We've got everything under control.

33
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:54,361
Just a dream, Jimmy.

34
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:57,531
That's all it is.
lt's just a dream

35
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,470
Waiting for the medicine.

36
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,449
On your finger.

37
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,075
Wait here.
Don't go.

38
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,660
l'll be right here.

39
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:07,221
You got a problem with doors?

40
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,223
Waste of time.

41
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:13,644
l followed you from the beach.

42
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:17,397
You followed me?

43
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,816
- Why?
- 'Cause...

44
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,818
you're the one.

45
00:07:38,794 --> 00:07:41,380
Maybe you should meet my old man.

46
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,382
What's your name?

47
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:47,261
- Mine's Jim.
- Pam.

48
00:07:55,227 --> 00:07:57,020
Who the hell was that?

49
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,648
l have no idea.

50
00:08:01,024 --> 00:08:02,526
Nietzsche said...

51
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:06,822
"All great things must first wear
terrifying and monstrous masks..

52
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:09,867
in order to inscribe themselves...

53
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,661
on the hearts of humanity."

54
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:14,454
Listen, children...

55
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:18,041
to the sound of the Nuremberg night.

56
00:08:19,126 --> 00:08:20,377
ln a seance...

57
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,298
the shaman leads a sensuous panic.

58
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:29,887
He acts like a madman.
A professional hysteria.

59
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:32,431
Have you ever seen God?

60
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:35,225
Mandala?

61
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:36,852
A symmetrical angel.

62
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:39,938
We got our final vision by clap.

63
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:43,192
Columbus' groin got filled
with green death.

64
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:46,403
- l touched her thigh...
- This film is weak.

65
00:08:46,445 --> 00:08:49,031
and death smiled.

66
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,286
Hey, Morrison.
Fuck them, man.

67
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,705
lt's great.
lt's nonlinear, it's poetry.

68
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,624
lt's everything good art stands for.

69
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,628
This world, a monster of energy.

70
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:05,214
Without beginning,
Without end.

71
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:07,966
Likewise, without increase or income.

72
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,845
Disclosing nothing.

73
00:09:11,929 --> 00:09:13,805
This world.

74
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,725
This world is a will to power...

75
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:19,186
and nothing besides.

76
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:26,026
Pretty pretentious there.

77
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,778
Not easy to follow.
A little incoherent.

78
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,697
Dancing bears, Nazism, masturbation.

79
00:09:30,739 --> 00:09:32,241
What's next?

80
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:34,701
- What do you guys think?
- A bore, man. l hated it.

81
00:09:34,785 --> 00:09:37,246
lt was better than a Warhol picture!

82
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:38,664
lt was worse!

83
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:40,332
A guy sleeping for seven hours?

84
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,043
There was no political conscience.

85
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:46,588
- You need your art spoon-fed to you.
- Right on!

86
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:51,802
Hold it down.
Let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks.

87
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:56,807
l quit.

88
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:21,164
Awake.

89
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:26,336
Shake dreams from your hair,
my pretty child, my sweet one.

90
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:28,964
Choose the day
and choose the sign of your day.

91
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:32,843
The day's divinity.
First thing l see.

92
00:10:32,926 --> 00:10:35,387
Come on out for a walk.

93
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:38,390
lt's a beautiful night.

94
00:10:38,515 --> 00:10:40,601
A vast, radiant beach...

95
00:10:40,684 --> 00:10:44,188
and a cool, jeweled moon.

96
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:49,526
Couples, naked,
race down by its quiet side.

97
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,613
And we laugh like soft, mad children...

98
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:56,116
smug in the woolly,
cotton brains of infancy.

99
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,329
Every time
l try to make love to you

100
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,958
you run around
with your mouth stuck out

101
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:09,171
Choose, they croon, the ancient ones.
The time has come again.

102
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:12,090
Choose now, they croon,
beneath the moon...

103
00:11:12,132 --> 00:11:13,592
beside an ancient lake.

104
00:11:14,635 --> 00:11:16,929
Enter again the sweet forest.

105
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,806
Enter the hot dream.
Come with us.

106
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,475
Everything is broken up...

107
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:23,810
and dances.

108
00:11:26,772 --> 00:11:29,024
l can't believe it's so beautiful.

109
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:33,987
"Now l have come again to the land
of the fair, strong and the wise.

110
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:36,365
Brothers and sisters
o'er the pale forest.

111
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,325
O, children of night...

112
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,035
who among you will run with the hunt?

113
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,664
Now, night arrives with
her purple legion.

114
00:11:43,705 --> 00:11:47,084
Retire now to your tents and dreams.

115
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,962
Tomorrow we enter
the town of my birth.

116
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:52,130
l want to be ready."

117
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:56,510
lt's beautiful.

118
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,638
- Do you like that?
- lt's beautiful.

119
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,641
l've never read much poetry before.

120
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,646
What's a shaman?

121
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:13,402
He's a medicine man...

122
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:15,070
of the lndians.

123
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,949
He gets into a peyote trance...

124
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:24,079
and he gets deeper and deeper,
and then he has a vision...

125
00:12:24,121 --> 00:12:26,582
and the whole tribe is healed.

126
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,711
All cultures have a version of it.

127
00:12:30,752 --> 00:12:33,005
Greeks had theater and gods.

128
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:37,342
The lndians say the first shaman
invented sex.

129
00:12:37,426 --> 00:12:39,761
They called him
"The One Who Makes You Crazy."

130
00:12:41,388 --> 00:12:44,099
What turns you on?

131
00:12:46,393 --> 00:12:48,312
l don't know.

132
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:52,399
Experience.

133
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:54,735
Freedom.

134
00:12:54,818 --> 00:12:58,197
Love. Now.

135
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,909
You know, the first time l did acid,
l saw God.

136
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:05,829
And l saw a friend of mine
who was Christ and Judas too.

137
00:13:05,913 --> 00:13:08,123
Then l realized that...

138
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:11,210
that was the secret of everything.

139
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:14,463
We're all one,
the universe is one...

140
00:13:14,505 --> 00:13:17,883
and that everything is beautiful.

141
00:13:21,887 --> 00:13:24,890
l feel most alive...

142
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:27,893
confronting death...

143
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:29,561
experiencing pain.

144
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:33,440
l think you're most alive
by recognizing beauty.

145
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:35,442
Seeing truth.

146
00:13:36,527 --> 00:13:39,321
Does death turn you on?

147
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:41,323
You love death?

148
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:44,910
Life hurts a lot more.

149
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:47,371
When you die, the pain's over.

150
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,969
All the poems have wolves in it.

151
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,304
All but one.

152
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:07,057
The most beautiful one of all.

153
00:14:08,851 --> 00:14:13,188
"She dances in a ring of fire...

154
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:16,525
and throws off the challenge
with a shrug."

155
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:21,530
That's beautiful.

156
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:26,034
Who did you write that for?

157
00:14:26,076 --> 00:14:28,453
l wrote it for you.

158
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,279
Try acid, Ray.

159
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,949
lt's guaranteed.

160
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:07,993
Shit, Morrison.

161
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,456
My last trip was a real bummer, man.

162
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:14,917
l never had a bummer on acid.

163
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,877
l'm trying naturally high now.

164
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,795
Whatever works.

165
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,881
Making movies at MGM yet?

166
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:23,717
l got in to see the head of production.

167
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,386
He said, "Where's your script?"
l said, "l don't need a script.

168
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,972
Godard doesn't use a script.
He improvises."

169
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:32,017
The guy says, "Great. Who's Godard?"

170
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,019
l'm off movies, man.

171
00:15:35,729 --> 00:15:38,732
l went out to the desert.
Got lost.

172
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:42,277
l've been living up on Trick's rooftop.

173
00:15:43,862 --> 00:15:46,865
- Got stuck on a chick.
- So what else you doing?

174
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:50,869
Writing songs, poems.
Stuff like that.

175
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:54,039
You're writing songs?

176
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,582
So let me hear one.

177
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,043
l'm shy.

178
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,420
- Sing it to me.
- l can't sing.

179
00:16:00,504 --> 00:16:01,713
You sing better than Dylan?

180
00:16:01,755 --> 00:16:03,215
Johnny's in the basement

181
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,884
Mixing up the medicine
l'm on the pavement

182
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:07,261
Thinking about the government

183
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:10,764
Let me hear your words.

184
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,438
All right.

185
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,070
Let's swim to the moon

186
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:28,740
Let's climb through the tide

187
00:16:30,075 --> 00:16:33,662
Penetrate the evening

188
00:16:33,745 --> 00:16:38,667
That the city sleeps to hide

189
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:45,549
Let's swim out tonight, love

190
00:16:45,632 --> 00:16:49,845
lt's our turn to try

191
00:16:50,971 --> 00:16:55,184
Park beside the ocean

192
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:57,728
On our

193
00:16:57,811 --> 00:17:01,023
Moonlight drive

194
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,701
Those are great fucking lyrics, man.

195
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:16,455
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You write this?

196
00:17:16,538 --> 00:17:18,832
You got others in here?

197
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,502
A bunch, man.
l got a whole concert in my head.

198
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,337
l can see it all.

199
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,380
What the hell happened to you
in the desert, man?

200
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:26,924
- Ecstasy and madness.
- Let's get a band together...

201
00:17:27,007 --> 00:17:28,800
and make a million bucks!

202
00:17:28,884 --> 00:17:31,261
- l got tons of songs.
- Things are about to explode.

203
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:34,264
l can feel it in the air.
People want to fight or fuck.

204
00:17:34,306 --> 00:17:37,017
Love or kill.
Vietnam is right out there.

205
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,019
Sides are being chosen.

206
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:42,606
Everything's gonna flame.
The planet is screaming for change.

207
00:17:42,648 --> 00:17:44,608
We gotta make the myths.

208
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,693
There ought to be great orgies, man.

209
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:50,489
When Dionysus arrived in Greece,
he made all the women mad.

210
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:53,575
Leaving their homes
and dancing off into the mountains.

211
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:57,329
There should be great, golden
copulations in the streets of L.A.

212
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,664
We should call ourselves Dionysus.

213
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:01,166
l got a name.
Doors.

214
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,836
You mean "The Doors ln Your Mind"?
The Huxley book?

215
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:06,004
- Doors of perception. Acid.
- That's great.

216
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:08,006
The quote's from William Blake.

217
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,300
"When the doors of perception
are cleansed...

218
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,302
things will appear
as they truly are."

219
00:18:12,344 --> 00:18:15,013
Mescaline experiments.
Reducing the sugar flow to the brain.

220
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:15,097
Come on!

221
00:18:15,097 --> 00:18:17,015
Come on!

222
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,487
You know the day destroys the night

223
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:32,614
Night divides the day

224
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,033
Try to run

225
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:36,618
Try to hide

226
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:39,621
Break on through to the other side

227
00:18:45,878 --> 00:18:47,838
What's the matter?

228
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:49,798
- lt just doesn't sound right.
- l know that, John.

229
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:51,884
Jim, stay in time.

230
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,468
l say we try that bossa nova beat.

231
00:18:55,137 --> 00:18:56,597
l think it's hot.

232
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,351
l think the lyrics are kind of weird.

233
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,105
You write one, man.

234
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,775
We need more songs anyway.

235
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:11,111
l thought it was pretty good.

236
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:13,572
Let's go outside.

237
00:19:24,082 --> 00:19:26,001
l came up with something.

238
00:19:29,505 --> 00:19:32,966
A minor, then F sharp.

239
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,227
You know that it would be untrue

240
00:19:43,352 --> 00:19:46,855
You know that l would be a liar

241
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:50,901
lf l was to say to you

242
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:54,530
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

243
00:19:54,613 --> 00:19:58,242
Come on, baby, light my fire

244
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:01,620
- G, A, D.
- Pretty good. Pretty neat.

245
00:20:01,703 --> 00:20:04,957
Try to set the night on fire

246
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,959
Great, Robby.
You got nice changes in there.

247
00:20:07,042 --> 00:20:09,044
- Got anymore lyrics?
- l got some.

248
00:20:09,127 --> 00:20:11,797
l call it "Light My Fire."

249
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,510
lf l'm gonna compete with your stuff, it
better be about earth, snakes or fire.

250
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:19,388
l like it.
Sounds like the Byrds though.

251
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:21,974
But l like it.
lt's good.

252
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,767
A little Latin beat'll
do it some justice.

253
00:20:23,809 --> 00:20:28,146
Maybe put a couple long solos,
like Coltrane on "My Favorite Things."

254
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,941
Start over, man.

255
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:33,819
A minor, B minor.
lt's jazz.

256
00:20:33,861 --> 00:20:36,071
The time to hesitate is through

257
00:20:36,154 --> 00:20:40,868
- Some kind of intro.
- No time to wallow in the mire

258
00:20:40,951 --> 00:20:44,121
Try now, we can only lose

259
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:48,083
And our love becomes a funeral pyre

260
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,503
Come on baby, light my fire

261
00:20:55,424 --> 00:20:58,886
Try to set the night on fire

262
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,558
- Can you give me--
- Try now, we can only lose

263
00:21:04,641 --> 00:21:08,228
Can you give me five minutes?
l got to figure out some kind of intro.

264
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:11,148
- Let's let him work. You like that?
- Yeah, l like Laguna Beach, man.

265
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,443
Funeral pyre.

266
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:21,241
What do you think about when you play?

267
00:21:21,283 --> 00:21:23,994
l don't know.

268
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:26,038
Fish in my fish tank.

269
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:31,376
- How about that acid tonight, man?
- Not for me.

270
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,296
- Not me, either.
- Right here at Ray's house.

271
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:36,673
See what kind of trouble
we can get into tonight.

272
00:21:36,757 --> 00:21:38,759
No way.
You always get all the chicks.

273
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,302
l always get the dogs.

274
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:42,221
Hey, l got it!
Come on!

275
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:43,639
l got it!
l got the intro!

276
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:46,808
Hang on a second.
John, count off in four, man.

277
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,352
One, two, three.

278
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:17,798
ls that horny fucker
in the black pants here tonight?

279
00:22:17,881 --> 00:22:20,259
No l.D.'s, you can't get in.

280
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,352
Yeah, we chased our pleasures here

281
00:22:30,435 --> 00:22:32,604
Dug our treasures there

282
00:22:32,646 --> 00:22:35,482
Can't you still recall
The time we tried

283
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,569
Break on through to the other side

284
00:22:57,796 --> 00:23:00,799
Turn around, man.
Come on, let them in.

285
00:23:00,841 --> 00:23:03,760
l found an island in your arms

286
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:06,430
A country in your eyes

287
00:23:06,513 --> 00:23:09,183
Arms that chain us
Eyes that lie

288
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:11,560
Break on through to the other side

289
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:18,400
All right

290
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:24,364
l'm a big fan!
Give it to me!

291
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,782
Made the scene

292
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,201
Week to week

293
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:29,578
Day to day
Hour to hour

294
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:32,581
The gate is straight
Deep and wide

295
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,875
Break on through to the other side

296
00:23:44,927 --> 00:23:46,678
All right

297
00:23:48,263 --> 00:23:48,305
Hi, Jim.
Can l have your autograph?

298
00:23:48,305 --> 00:23:51,558
Hi, Jim.
Can l have your autograph?

299
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,269
- l don't know. Where do you want it?
- Anywhere you want it.

300
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:56,313
Leave it to me.
l can take you all the fucking way.

301
00:23:56,396 --> 00:23:58,690
- You blew my mind.
- Did you like the music?

302
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:00,901
l loved it.
That's why we're talking.

303
00:24:00,984 --> 00:24:03,529
Some of it's on the dark side.
You ought to get some tunes.

304
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:06,365
Herman's Hermits stuff.
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter

305
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,033
That shit goes right to the radio.

306
00:24:08,158 --> 00:24:11,078
l need him here
to groove on my boyfriend.

307
00:24:12,996 --> 00:24:14,748
What about getting us
some real equipment?

308
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:16,583
l sign you
to a five-year management contract--

309
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:18,669
You with the joint.
Put that out, please.

310
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,213
- We can smell that upstairs.
- l can get you there.

311
00:24:21,338 --> 00:24:23,131
Trust me for a while.
What do you say?

312
00:24:23,215 --> 00:24:24,842
We'll have a band meeting on it.

313
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:28,971
We do everything unanimously
or we don't do it.

314
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:30,305
The Musketeers.

315
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:32,516
l'm touched.

316
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,102
Let me tell you something.
Loyalty don't pay the bills.

317
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:39,064
Think about it and call me tomorrow.
Here's my card.

318
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:46,572
Pay attention.
You could get rich.

319
00:24:46,655 --> 00:24:48,949
- Are you blind?
- How old are you?

320
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:51,410
- Twenty-one.
- Get lost, will you?

321
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:57,749
l'll make this quick and to the point.
lf you repeat it, l'll deny it.

322
00:24:57,791 --> 00:24:59,251
Drop those guys.

323
00:24:59,334 --> 00:25:01,920
Jim's got to start facing the crowd
if he's going to be our front man.

324
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,422
He's just getting his confidence.

325
00:25:03,463 --> 00:25:06,925
- The guy never does what's rehearsed--
- Well, how does it feel?

326
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,302
lt feels great, but--

327
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:11,138
Your looks. Your voice.
That's what's going to sell records.

328
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,806
We'll make a million bucks a year.

329
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,558
Call me.
l'm right.

330
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,977
Hey, man, let's go.

331
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,813
Do yourself a favor.
Call Larry.

332
00:25:19,897 --> 00:25:22,441
l like a guy
who wears his soul on his face.

333
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:26,445
Whisky's next, man.
l can feel it in my bones.

334
00:25:27,988 --> 00:25:29,656
l still think the lyrics are weird.

335
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,950
The days are bright

336
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:35,162
And filled with pain

337
00:25:35,245 --> 00:25:40,667
Enclose me in your gentle rain

338
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:44,922
The time you ran

339
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:49,551
Was too insane

340
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,887
We'll meet again

341
00:25:54,973 --> 00:25:57,059
The chicks are really
digging you tonight, man.

342
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,894
We still got to deepen, man.

343
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:01,396
- We got to go one more step.
- Turn around and face the crowd.

344
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:02,940
lt'll help present it better.

345
00:26:03,023 --> 00:26:04,775
l got to go to the desert
and take that peyote.

346
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:06,443
ls that what you're on?

347
00:26:06,527 --> 00:26:08,654
Yeah, man.
lt's kicking in!

348
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:11,573
- Fucking longhair!
- He's fucking crazy.

349
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:14,243
- Come on.
- l'm not doing acid, man.

350
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:16,453
lt's peyote.

351
00:26:16,537 --> 00:26:19,456
What's a rock and roll band for?

352
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:22,459
Let's plan a murder or start a religion.

353
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:24,795
More, more, more!

354
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:27,256
l'm into T.M., man.
l promised my guru.

355
00:26:27,297 --> 00:26:29,341
l'll try it.
l'm ready.

356
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:30,634
Let's go to the desert.

357
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:32,636
Let's do the peyote.

358
00:26:34,555 --> 00:26:36,640
Who's on next?

359
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,059
Arthur Lee.
He's cool.

360
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,106
l am the lizard king!

361
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:46,149
l can do anything!

362
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:49,403
Raise your hands if you understand.

363
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:54,908
Let's take a poll.
How many of you know you're alive?

364
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:57,661
Bullshit!

365
00:26:57,703 --> 00:27:01,081
You're plastic soldiers
in a miniature dirt war.

366
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:03,542
Come on!

367
00:27:03,584 --> 00:27:06,545
How many of you people
know you're alive?

368
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:50,130
Close your eyes.

369
00:27:50,172 --> 00:27:51,924
You see the snake.

370
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,594
See the serpent appear?

371
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:56,929
His head is ten feet long...

372
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:59,181
and five feet wide.

373
00:27:59,223 --> 00:28:01,350
He has one red eye and one green eye.

374
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:04,311
That's all right.
lt gets better.

375
00:28:04,353 --> 00:28:05,896
Peace.

376
00:28:07,189 --> 00:28:09,107
Seven miles long.

377
00:28:13,028 --> 00:28:14,947
Deadly.

378
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:21,203
See it.
All the history of the world...

379
00:28:21,286 --> 00:28:23,705
is on its scales.

380
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:26,041
All people.
All actions.

381
00:28:26,124 --> 00:28:30,045
We're all just little pictures
in the scales.

382
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:35,133
God, it's big.

383
00:28:36,426 --> 00:28:38,345
lt's moving.

384
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,599
Devouring consciousness.

385
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,978
Digesting power.

386
00:28:48,105 --> 00:28:51,358
Monster of energy.

387
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:53,402
lt's a monster.

388
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:59,491
l'm gonna kiss the snake on the tongue.

389
00:28:59,616 --> 00:29:02,035
Kiss the serpent.

390
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:05,122
But if it senses fear...

391
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:08,166
it'll eat us instantly.

392
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,586
But if we kiss it without fear...

393
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,046
it'll take us through the garden.

394
00:29:13,172 --> 00:29:14,882
Through the gate.

395
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:18,343
To the other side.

396
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:21,513
Ride the snake...

397
00:29:21,597 --> 00:29:23,515
'til the end of time.

398
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:28,687
l think l'm fucked up, man.

399
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,272
l'm not thinking right.

400
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:33,233
Look at your eyes, man.
You're death.

401
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:35,444
l'm afraid of my father.

402
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,198
l can't be what they want me to be.

403
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:41,033
Maybe you should kill your father.

404
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:42,409
l'm in pain, man.

405
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,080
l feel the universe
functioning perfectly...

406
00:29:47,164 --> 00:29:51,960
but l'm still perfectly locked
inside myself.

407
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:55,214
lnstead of oneness, l feel isolation.

408
00:29:56,256 --> 00:29:58,175
But you're alive.

409
00:29:58,258 --> 00:30:00,928
- Feel it.
- l'm scared.

410
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:02,888
- lt's beautiful.
- l'm still scared.

411
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,015
Then use us.

412
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:08,310
Use our strength.
Come on in here.

413
00:30:08,393 --> 00:30:10,270
That's right.

414
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:13,941
We're a tribe now.
A tribe of warriors.

415
00:30:14,816 --> 00:30:19,071
l promise you, l'll be with you
to the end of time.

416
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:21,698
Nothing will destroy our circle.

417
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:23,700
Ride the snake.

418
00:30:27,955 --> 00:30:29,873
Come on.

419
00:30:30,999 --> 00:30:35,838
My wild love went riding

420
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:40,467
She rode all the day

421
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:45,472
She rode to the devil

422
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:49,268
Asked him to pay

423
00:30:50,227 --> 00:30:54,857
My wild love went riding

424
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:58,235
She went to the sea

425
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:03,282
She went to the devil

426
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:08,662
All that's left was we

427
00:31:22,551 --> 00:31:25,470
l'm lying.
l am afraid.

428
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,649
Don't go away!

429
00:31:39,109 --> 00:31:41,195
Come dance with me!

430
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:50,204
Where you going, Jimmy?

431
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:06,678
This is the end

432
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,557
Beautiful friend

433
00:32:13,185 --> 00:32:16,063
This is the end

434
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:20,734
My only friend, the end

435
00:32:20,776 --> 00:32:24,613
Of our elaborate plans

436
00:32:24,696 --> 00:32:26,698
The end

437
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,786
Of everything that stands

438
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:32,788
The end

439
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:36,583
No safety or surprise

440
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,627
The end

441
00:32:38,752 --> 00:32:41,463
l'll never look

442
00:32:41,547 --> 00:32:44,758
lnto your eyes

443
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,010
Again

444
00:32:51,181 --> 00:32:56,144
Can you picture what we'll be

445
00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:00,399
So limitless and free

446
00:33:01,483 --> 00:33:05,028
Desperately in need

447
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:08,740
Of some stranger's hand

448
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:14,413
ln a desperate land

449
00:33:46,361 --> 00:33:50,866
Lost in a Roman

450
00:33:50,949 --> 00:33:55,454
Wilderness of pain

451
00:33:57,372 --> 00:34:02,169
And all the children

452
00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:05,297
Are insane

453
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:24,733
Waiting for the summer rain

454
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:46,129
There's danger on the edge of town

455
00:34:51,552 --> 00:34:56,014
Ride the king's highway, baby

456
00:35:00,435 --> 00:35:04,731
Weird scenes inside the gold mine

457
00:35:09,403 --> 00:35:14,157
Ride the highway west, baby

458
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:21,790
Ride the snake

459
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:30,883
To the lake

460
00:35:32,676 --> 00:35:36,180
The ancient lake, baby

461
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:41,435
The snake is long

462
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:44,646
Seven miles

463
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,483
Ride the snake

464
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:54,281
He's old

465
00:35:55,741 --> 00:35:59,036
And his skin is cold

466
00:36:05,334 --> 00:36:09,046
The west is the best

467
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,768
Get here and we'll do the rest

468
00:36:30,484 --> 00:36:34,279
The blue bus

469
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:38,450
ls calling us

470
00:36:48,502 --> 00:36:53,173
Driver, where you taking us

471
00:37:08,689 --> 00:37:12,150
The killer awoke before dawn.

472
00:37:12,234 --> 00:37:14,570
He put his boots on.

473
00:37:17,573 --> 00:37:18,866
He took a face...

474
00:37:18,907 --> 00:37:20,742
from the ancient gallery...

475
00:37:20,826 --> 00:37:24,329
and he walked on down the hall.

476
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:36,175
He went into the room
where his sister lived.

477
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,926
Then he...

478
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,347
paid a visit to his brother.

479
00:37:42,431 --> 00:37:45,350
Then he--

480
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:49,479
He walked on down the hall.

481
00:37:51,815 --> 00:37:55,152
And he came to a door.

482
00:37:56,236 --> 00:37:59,448
He looked inside.

483
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:06,997
"Father."
"Yes, son?"

484
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,333
"l want to kill you."

485
00:38:14,171 --> 00:38:15,839
"Mother."

486
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:21,970
l want to

487
00:38:22,054 --> 00:38:24,598
fuck you all night, baby

488
00:38:25,432 --> 00:38:27,392
Come on, baby

489
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:32,439
"Mother, l want to fuck you"?

490
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:36,193
Come on

491
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:43,325
Fuck, fuck

492
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:46,036
Turn him off!
Turn his fucking amp off!

493
00:38:53,001 --> 00:38:54,753
Fuck me, baby

494
00:39:07,641 --> 00:39:08,809
Come on, baby

495
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:10,602
- He's insane!
- He's a great artist!

496
00:39:10,644 --> 00:39:12,312
- We all love it!
- Come on

497
00:39:25,367 --> 00:39:27,369
All right

498
00:39:33,166 --> 00:39:36,420
Kill

499
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,933
Get him out of here!

500
00:39:50,017 --> 00:39:50,058
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

501
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:52,936
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

502
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,191
Nobody's gonna fuck their mother
on my stage!

503
00:39:57,274 --> 00:39:59,484
- That's what l mean!
- You're out of here!

504
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:01,862
Kill your father!
Fuck the mother!

505
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:03,614
All right!

506
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:05,616
Jerry, come on, man!

507
00:40:05,657 --> 00:40:08,744
- Art, man! lt's art!
- What do you know about art?

508
00:40:08,785 --> 00:40:11,079
Take a look at the future, old man!

509
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:13,415
We're things to come!

510
00:40:13,457 --> 00:40:15,626
Here's art.

511
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:19,171
- There's your art!
- This is fucking great!

512
00:40:19,254 --> 00:40:23,050
- We'll never work in this town again.
- Quite a night.

513
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,177
l'm Jac Holzman.

514
00:40:25,219 --> 00:40:27,888
- l own Elektra Records.
- ls that asshole gonna pay us?

515
00:40:30,182 --> 00:40:33,060
l think if you can put
what you did in there on record...

516
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:35,854
we could really have something
and make a lot of money.

517
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:39,691
Rothchild here
was born to be your producer.

518
00:40:39,775 --> 00:40:42,694
How you doing? Sorry about all this.
You guys are--

519
00:40:43,695 --> 00:40:46,657
Bertolt Brecht. lt's cabaret.
lt's rock and roll.

520
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:48,700
l'm really blown away, guys.

521
00:40:48,784 --> 00:40:53,080
l'd like to get you guys
into a studio immediately.

522
00:40:53,163 --> 00:40:56,458
How would you like to come down
from there and make a record?

523
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:59,419
Sure.
Pretty good. Pretty neat.

524
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:04,550
Bruce, you feel it?

525
00:41:04,591 --> 00:41:07,094
lt's bitchin'.

526
00:41:07,135 --> 00:41:11,640
An album of killer music in six days.
Six days, baby.

527
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:13,433
Unreal.

528
00:41:13,475 --> 00:41:16,979
The time to hesitate is through

529
00:41:17,062 --> 00:41:20,941
No time to wallow in the mire

530
00:41:20,983 --> 00:41:24,194
Try now, we can only lose

531
00:41:24,278 --> 00:41:28,282
And our love become a funeral pyre

532
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:31,034
Come on, baby, light my fire

533
00:41:35,831 --> 00:41:38,959
Try to set the night on fire

534
00:42:12,951 --> 00:42:15,037
L.B.J.! L.B.J. !

535
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,040
How many kids
have you killed today?

536
00:42:24,087 --> 00:42:27,716
You know that it would be untrue

537
00:42:27,799 --> 00:42:31,595
You know that l would be a liar

538
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:35,182
lf l was to say to you

539
00:42:35,265 --> 00:42:38,727
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

540
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:41,813
Come on, baby, light my fire

541
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:49,446
Try to set the night on fire

542
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,880
All right!

543
00:43:33,448 --> 00:43:36,410
- Name? Occupation?
- Bill Siddons. l'm the manager.

544
00:43:36,493 --> 00:43:37,870

00:43:45,878 --> 00:43:48,255
John Densmore.

548
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:51,300
Twenty-two years old.
Far out, man.

549
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:54,845
- Name? Occupation?
- Raymond Daniel Manzarek.

550
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:59,224
Born 2-12-39.
Musician. Organist.

551
00:43:59,308 --> 00:44:02,519
- Name? Occupation?
- Jim.

552
00:45:09,086 --> 00:45:11,046
We're gonna be on TV.

553
00:45:11,129 --> 00:45:12,714
Right this way, Mr. Sullivan.

554
00:45:12,798 --> 00:45:12,840
They're called the Doors...

555
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,967
They're called the Doors...

556
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,928
and they've got the number one single
in the country right now.

557
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:19,930
"Light Your Fire."

558
00:45:21,306 --> 00:45:23,308
Now, they're not your usual group...

559
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:25,811
but l think they're gonna fit in
just fine.

560
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:27,729
Everything's gonna be fine.

561
00:45:27,813 --> 00:45:30,858
The riot continues in Detroit,
with 1,400 buildings burned.

562
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:32,568
No wonder "Light My Fire"
is number one.

563
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:36,613
So, what's your room number?

564
00:45:36,697 --> 00:45:38,365
l'll talk to you later.

565
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:42,286
- You have got very serious hair.
- Were you pinching her butt?

566
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:46,206
- What about me?
- l won't open that kettle of worms.

567
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:48,208
What about you, handsome?
What can we do?

568
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,794
Some of the worst mistakes of my life
have been haircuts.

569
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:54,256
Don't wash it. Don't set it. Go away.
l like it just the way it is.

570
00:45:54,339 --> 00:45:57,718
- Be mean.
- Boys. Boys.

571
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:59,761
Meet Mr. Sullivan.

572
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:02,055
Fellas, just great.

573
00:46:02,097 --> 00:46:04,933
-l heard your record, "Light That Fire."
-"Light Your Fire."

574
00:46:05,017 --> 00:46:06,602
- Just--
- "Light My Fire."

575
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:09,271
Fine.
Just really, really fine.

576
00:46:09,313 --> 00:46:11,732
l have one small thing to bring up.

577
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:14,526
But it's important.
The guys at network told us...

578
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:16,528
they have a little problem...

579
00:46:16,612 --> 00:46:20,032
with the lyric,
"Girl, we couldn't get much higher."

580
00:46:20,115 --> 00:46:22,159
You can't say "higher"...

581
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:23,702
on network.

582
00:46:23,785 --> 00:46:25,579
They asked if you could say, instead...

583
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:28,040
"Girl, we can't get much better."

584
00:46:28,123 --> 00:46:30,125
- Can you dig that?
- How about...

585
00:46:30,209 --> 00:46:33,837
"Girl, you couldn't bite my wire"?

586
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,591
l don't think
Standards and Practices would--

587
00:46:37,674 --> 00:46:41,512
Why don't you have a nice, big smile
on your face when you get out there?

588
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:43,347
There's no point in being sullen.

589
00:46:43,388 --> 00:46:46,141
- You know what l mean?
- We're a sullen group, Ed.

590
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:51,605
You boys should know, Mr. Sullivan
is considering you for four more shows.

591
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:53,023
- You dig?
- We dig.

592
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:56,401
l'll work it out.
Just give me five minutes.

593
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:58,403
- Groovy.
- Just give me five.

594
00:46:58,487 --> 00:47:00,531
Have a great show.

595
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,495
Well?

596
00:47:07,287 --> 00:47:11,083
- Come on.
- lt's just a word.

597
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:13,669
The Stones changed
when they played here.

598
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:15,796
Why don't you change your name to...

599
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:18,298
Sidney or lrving Manzarek?

600
00:47:18,382 --> 00:47:20,425
- lt's just a word.
- Hey, man.

601
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:23,053
My words. l don't care.
Let's just jam.

602
00:47:23,136 --> 00:47:24,388
And now...

603
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:26,932
direct from
Los Angeles, California...

604
00:47:27,057 --> 00:47:30,561
ladies and gentlemen,
here now, the Doors!

605
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,816
You know that it would be untrue

606
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:37,860
We're okay sound wise?

607
00:47:40,404 --> 00:47:44,533
lf l was to say to you

608
00:47:44,616 --> 00:47:48,078
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

609
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:49,830
He said it!

610
00:47:49,913 --> 00:47:51,331
He said it on national TV.

611
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:55,085
- l can't believe that!
- Come on baby, light my fire

612
00:47:55,169 --> 00:47:56,837
What's he doing? What's that?

613
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,673
Jesus! Get it off!
You can see his thing!

614
00:47:59,756 --> 00:48:01,800
You blew it, you little shit!

615
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:03,802
You'll never play Sullivan again!

616
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:12,144
Can you just move a step forward?

617
00:48:12,186 --> 00:48:14,688
Come on.
l know you love to look at yourself.

618
00:48:16,231 --> 00:48:18,192
Great.

619
00:48:19,735 --> 00:48:23,071
Let's try something different.
Take your shirt off.

620
00:48:24,072 --> 00:48:26,825
- You take it off.
- Do you need help?

621
00:48:28,994 --> 00:48:30,913
That's good.

622
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:36,418
The camera
is whatever you want it to be.

623
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,170
A woman you want to seduce.

624
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:42,049
A man you want to kill.

625
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,885
lt can be anything you want.

626
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,595
That's nice.

627
00:48:48,096 --> 00:48:49,598
That's great!

628
00:48:49,681 --> 00:48:52,392
Do you have any idea
what these pictures can do?

629
00:48:52,434 --> 00:48:56,188
One image controls millions of people.

630
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:58,857
- Where are the Doors?
- Right here.

631
00:48:58,941 --> 00:49:00,317
Will you forget the Doors?

632
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,110
You're the one they want.

633
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:04,321
You are the Doors.
Come on.

634
00:49:06,114 --> 00:49:07,658
That's it.
Be ugly.

635
00:49:09,743 --> 00:49:11,662
l love that.

636
00:49:11,745 --> 00:49:13,455
Anything you want.

637
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:15,624
There are no restrictions here.

638
00:49:18,836 --> 00:49:20,504
Look at yourself.

639
00:49:20,546 --> 00:49:22,506
Fall in love with yourself.

640
00:49:24,758 --> 00:49:27,719
You're your own audience now.

641
00:49:29,263 --> 00:49:31,223
They want you.

642
00:49:32,432 --> 00:49:35,894
Worship, love you.

643
00:49:35,936 --> 00:49:37,479
Adore you.

644
00:49:37,563 --> 00:49:40,482
Jim Morrison.

645
00:49:40,566 --> 00:49:42,484
The god of rock...

646
00:49:42,568 --> 00:49:44,486
and cock.

647
00:50:23,984 --> 00:50:27,154
Not tonight, Edie.
Thank you, not tonight.

648
00:50:27,196 --> 00:50:30,240
This is the fun part of my job.
This is history in the making.

649
00:50:30,324 --> 00:50:34,870
Would you like to see my imitation
of a shrimp?

650
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:37,039
Let me put it this way.

651
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,501
Andy is more than an artist.
Andy Warhol is art.

652
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:43,754
Sometimes l think bright people
in America must ask themselves...

653
00:50:43,837 --> 00:50:46,924
"Does Andy imitate life,
or does life imitate Andy?"

654
00:50:47,007 --> 00:50:49,718
Jim, this is Tom Baker.

655
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:53,096
He's in one of Andy's movies,
"l, A Man."

656
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,766
- And this is Count "Ruspooli."
- Ruspoli.

657
00:50:55,849 --> 00:50:57,726
He's ltalian, but he lives in Paris.

658
00:50:57,768 --> 00:51:01,271
He's from a very famous family,
700 years old.

659
00:51:01,355 --> 00:51:04,191
Hi, Jim.
You are great.

660
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:07,236
l see you at Ondine's with Hendrix.

661
00:51:07,277 --> 00:51:10,572
So cool.

662
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:12,574
- All right.
- Don't you like the way he talks?

663
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:15,118
- lt's so cool.
- What's your trip?

664
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:17,663
My trip?
l thought it was yours.

665
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,749
l caught your gig at The Scene.
l thought it was pretty good.

666
00:51:20,832 --> 00:51:22,543
l liked it a lot.
lt was hot.

667
00:51:22,626 --> 00:51:25,629
l like your movies, man.
You got a great penis.

668
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:31,051
We're gonna split.
Why don't you come with us?

669
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:34,680
- We're going to get a bite to eat.
- No, you can't leave.

670
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:36,265
Where's your will to be weird?

671
00:51:36,306 --> 00:51:38,809
Look, that's Jim Morrison.

672
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:40,519
l like the Doors.

673
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:43,230
Let's get out of here.
These people are wacky.

674
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:47,693
Come with me.
Andy's waiting for you.

675
00:51:47,776 --> 00:51:50,028
No, not now.
Let's do this later.

676
00:51:51,572 --> 00:51:53,532
Do you remember San Francisco?

677
00:51:53,574 --> 00:51:55,868
- No, not really.
- Have another joint.

678
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:57,619
Check it out.

679
00:51:58,537 --> 00:52:01,915
This chick here sings with Andy's band,
The Velvet Underground.

680
00:52:01,999 --> 00:52:05,419
She says she can
drink you under the table.

681
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:10,048
Hi, l'm Nico.

682
00:52:10,132 --> 00:52:12,551
lt's so boring tonight.

683
00:52:14,386 --> 00:52:17,181
Some of us are going downtown
to a new club.

684
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,099
You want to come?

685
00:52:19,224 --> 00:52:21,560
Elevate your taste in trolls, man.

686
00:52:24,438 --> 00:52:26,440
Vodka?

687
00:52:26,523 --> 00:52:28,442
l'll race you.

688
00:52:31,612 --> 00:52:33,488
Your death.

689
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:40,037
Come on, man.
Let's go.

690
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,706
All right.
We're gonna go to a club.

691
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:45,834
l think this girl
wants to hang out with you.

692
00:52:45,918 --> 00:52:49,796
Don't you want to meet Andy Warhol?

693
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,091
l could do without the guy.
He's a freak.

694
00:52:53,175 --> 00:52:54,885
Come on.
We got a big gig tomorrow.

695
00:52:54,968 --> 00:52:58,680
Wait. l thought we were going
to be a rock and roll band.

696
00:52:58,764 --> 00:53:01,225
All right.
The four of us.

697
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:03,435
Come on.
This isn't our scene.

698
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,187
These people are vampires.

699
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:12,194
Come on, let's make the myths.
Remember?

700
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:13,654
Let's go.

701
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:15,405
Don't leave.

702
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:17,741
Come on, you guys.
Not tonight.

703
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:19,743
l don't know what'll happen.

704
00:53:21,036 --> 00:53:22,621
lt might be death.

705
00:53:24,414 --> 00:53:26,333
lt's not death, man.

706
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,085
l'll see you tomorrow.

707
00:53:59,157 --> 00:54:00,826
Jimmy, this way.

708
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:03,829
Andy's waiting. This way.
l'll take you to him.

709
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:05,497
Hey, daddy.

710
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,417
Jimmy, please.
Come on.

711
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,419
Andy's waiting.
Come on.

712
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:14,840
Hey, man.
How you doin'?

713
00:54:14,882 --> 00:54:16,967
All right.
How you doin', man?

714
00:54:17,009 --> 00:54:18,468
Great.

715
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:21,763
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

716
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:33,400
There was this big show
in Philadelphia.

717
00:54:33,483 --> 00:54:34,902
Andy.

718
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,070
There were so many
people there--

719
00:54:37,154 --> 00:54:40,741
This is Jim Morrison of
the world-famous Doors musical group.

720
00:54:40,824 --> 00:54:43,702
- Andy Warhol, of course.
- Hi. Wow.

721
00:54:43,744 --> 00:54:46,496
We really like your music.

722
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,124
- How you doin', Andy?
- Oh, great.

723
00:54:49,208 --> 00:54:53,420
And there were so many people
at the show...

724
00:54:55,005 --> 00:54:57,674
the paintings
were getting crushed...

725
00:54:57,758 --> 00:55:01,803
and they had to
take them all down.

726
00:55:04,306 --> 00:55:06,141
Really, they were kind of...

727
00:55:07,601 --> 00:55:08,810
great.

728
00:55:08,852 --> 00:55:11,813
Just the walls.
You see, Andy was the art.

729
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:14,566
You should do a show
with just bare walls.

730
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,569
We'd really like to use you
in one of our movies, Jim.

731
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:19,571
You're really such a beauty.

732
00:55:19,655 --> 00:55:23,742
Andy says someday everybody
will be famous for 15 days.

733
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,827
He'd really be great,
wouldn't he?

734
00:55:28,956 --> 00:55:30,874
l mean...

735
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:36,839
lt's the singer,
not the song, right?

736
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:38,841
lt's the astronaut,
not the voyage.

737
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:44,179
Somebody gave me this telephone.

738
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:47,850
- l think it was Edie, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was Edie.

739
00:55:49,351 --> 00:55:51,895
And she said that...

740
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:54,815
l could talk to God with it...

741
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:57,734
but l don't have anything to say.

742
00:55:58,569 --> 00:56:00,529
Here. This is for you.

743
00:56:05,534 --> 00:56:08,245
Now you can talk to God.

744
00:56:22,342 --> 00:56:24,219
Morrison.

745
00:56:24,303 --> 00:56:26,305
Come here.

746
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:48,202
Darling, listen,
l pay the bills...

747
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:50,871
so l can use any language
that l want.

748
00:56:50,954 --> 00:56:53,373
The guy wants to talk
to the bum.

749
00:56:55,167 --> 00:56:56,919
Check it out, brother.

750
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:32,306
What are your songs about,
Mr. Morrison?

751
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:36,560
Love, death, travel, revolt.

752
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:42,482
We all write the songs.

753
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:44,109
l'm interested in...

754
00:58:45,194 --> 00:58:48,363
chaos, disorder...

755
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:51,450
especially activities which seem
to have no meaning, like this.

756
00:58:52,576 --> 00:58:56,538
How do you feel about being called
"the ultimate Barbie doll"?

757
00:58:56,622 --> 00:58:59,917
When you say something like that,
it's a shortcut to thinking.

758
00:59:01,293 --> 00:59:04,213
And do you think about
the dreadful reviews...

759
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:06,215
your new poetry book has gotten?

760
00:59:06,298 --> 00:59:08,717
l guess they didn't understand.

761
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,262
- Did you finance its publication?
- Have you bothered to read the poetry?

762
00:59:12,346 --> 00:59:16,266
You keep denying that nothing good
can come out of L.A.

763
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,268
That's a rather
provincial attitude.

764
00:59:18,352 --> 00:59:21,355
- Do you believe in drugs?
- l believe in excess.

765
00:59:21,438 --> 00:59:24,107
ls alcohol considered part
of the shaman's wisdom?

766
00:59:24,191 --> 00:59:25,692
lt's the American way.

767
00:59:25,776 --> 00:59:29,029
Every year we spend more money
on tobacco and alcohol...

768
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,781
than we do on education.

769
00:59:30,864 --> 00:59:33,909
- On behalf of the British press--
- What about the future of the Doors?

770
00:59:33,992 --> 00:59:36,912
- That's just an excuse for free sex.
- How do you spend your money?

771
00:59:40,582 --> 00:59:45,003
l believe in a long, prolonged
derangement of the senses...

772
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:47,214
to attain the unknown.

773
00:59:48,257 --> 00:59:50,759
Although l live
in the subconscious...

774
00:59:51,593 --> 00:59:54,555
our pale reason
hides the infinite from us.

775
00:59:56,056 --> 00:59:59,434
Are you, by any chance,
in a trance now?

776
01:00:02,396 --> 01:00:04,064
Do you hurt?

777
01:00:05,524 --> 01:00:06,984
What?

778
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:10,237
What hurts you the most?

779
01:00:13,198 --> 01:00:16,159
What do your parents think
about what you're doing?

780
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:18,245
Actually,
l don't remember being born.

781
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:21,248
lt must have happened
during one of my blackouts.

782
01:00:21,331 --> 01:00:23,959
They must have expressed
some feeling.

783
01:00:24,001 --> 01:00:27,963
Well, to tell you the truth,
they're not living anymore...

784
01:00:28,005 --> 01:00:31,133
so l really don't like
to talk about that.

785
01:00:32,092 --> 01:00:34,303
Could you tell us how they died?

786
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:40,350
lt was a...

787
01:00:41,435 --> 01:00:43,020
horrible car crash...

788
01:00:43,103 --> 01:00:44,563
in New Mexico...

789
01:00:44,646 --> 01:00:46,732
in the '50s.

790
01:00:46,857 --> 01:00:50,194
My father ran right into
a truckload of Navahos.

791
01:00:50,235 --> 01:00:51,320
They were...

792
01:00:53,405 --> 01:00:55,699
all over the highway, bleeding.

793
01:00:57,075 --> 01:01:00,412
Their souls, kind of
stirring in the breeze...

794
01:01:00,454 --> 01:01:02,122
just leapt into mine.

795
01:01:05,918 --> 01:01:07,419
l'm sorry.

796
01:01:08,921 --> 01:01:13,342
Mr. Krieger, do you really
consider Mr. Morrison a shaman?

797
01:01:42,579 --> 01:01:45,999
Don't worry about it.
lt happens to other guys too.

798
01:01:47,167 --> 01:01:49,002
Wanna do some coke?

799
01:01:49,127 --> 01:01:51,004
lt'll loosen you up.

800
01:01:51,129 --> 01:01:53,340
Sure. The new thing.

801
01:01:57,719 --> 01:01:58,846
Wow.

802
01:02:01,306 --> 01:02:02,558
How old is this?

803
01:02:03,684 --> 01:02:06,395
That's 14th century.

804
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:09,273
- Witchcraft.
- lt's a religion, you know.

805
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:11,233
Witchcraft.

806
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:13,443
Witches are
the protectors of the seasons...

807
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:16,780
the goddesses of the grain...

808
01:02:16,864 --> 01:02:18,782
and when crossed...

809
01:02:20,325 --> 01:02:21,743
destroyers.

810
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,751
You ever try drinking blood?

811
01:02:30,794 --> 01:02:32,796
What?

812
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,215
lt works, you know.

813
01:02:35,299 --> 01:02:38,218
Drink it at the right time
of the moon.

814
01:02:40,304 --> 01:02:43,932
They used to dance
in the forests naked.

815
01:02:43,974 --> 01:02:46,935
l think that's what
offended the Puritans...

816
01:02:46,977 --> 01:02:48,645
and led to the burnings.

817
01:02:50,063 --> 01:02:53,358
They were a sexual threat
to their male order...

818
01:02:53,442 --> 01:02:55,652
like the Bacchae.

819
01:02:55,736 --> 01:02:57,654
Five days a year,
for Dionysus...

820
01:02:57,738 --> 01:03:00,699
they used to wander the hills
of ancient Greece.

821
01:03:01,742 --> 01:03:04,119
The first witches.

822
01:03:04,203 --> 01:03:07,497
Clans of wild women...

823
01:03:08,582 --> 01:03:10,709
looting...

824
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:12,002
fucking...

825
01:03:13,378 --> 01:03:15,214
eating animals raw...

826
01:03:16,298 --> 01:03:19,384
looking for Dionysus...

827
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:21,386
to tear him...

828
01:03:21,428 --> 01:03:22,888
to pieces!

829
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:29,019
Where do you get the blood?

830
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:35,567
Blood is the rose
of mysterious union.

831
01:03:36,610 --> 01:03:38,570
Symbol of potency.

832
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:42,574
- Now you.
- l can't cut myself.

833
01:03:42,616 --> 01:03:46,078
Don't be such a child.
lf l do it, you have to do it.

834
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,376
You do it.

835
01:05:01,445 --> 01:05:03,530
Come on, rock god.

836
01:05:03,614 --> 01:05:05,908
Fuck me.
Fuck me good.

837
01:05:26,512 --> 01:05:30,182
What do you want me to do?
What can l do, baby?

838
01:05:36,563 --> 01:05:38,982
- What's the matter?
- Will you die for me?

839
01:05:39,024 --> 01:05:42,319
What do you want me to do?

840
01:05:42,361 --> 01:05:45,197
Maybe l should see
a doctor or something.

841
01:05:46,573 --> 01:05:50,702
What do you think?
Someone from the Freudian philosophy?

842
01:05:53,413 --> 01:05:55,499
lt happens to other guys too.

843
01:06:01,046 --> 01:06:02,965
You know, that's the irony.

844
01:06:05,926 --> 01:06:09,513
Teenage death girls
want my dick, not my words.

845
01:06:18,105 --> 01:06:20,524
lt's not so complicated.

846
01:06:20,607 --> 01:06:22,484
lt's just sex, you know.

847
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:25,946
Never wake up
in a good mood again.

848
01:06:26,029 --> 01:06:29,283
lt's the hours and the pressure.

849
01:06:29,366 --> 01:06:32,786
You do everything
like it's your last performance.

850
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:35,914
We weren't built to last.
You never know.

851
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:39,918
You're setting yourself up, you know.
You're setting yourself up.

852
01:06:41,503 --> 01:06:43,881
You're a poet, not a rock star.

853
01:06:44,965 --> 01:06:46,884
You really know what l am?

854
01:06:48,552 --> 01:06:52,639
- You know what poetry is?
- You don't belong on Ed Sullivan.

855
01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:54,641
Who am l?

856
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:59,229
Where's the feast
they promised us?

857
01:06:59,313 --> 01:07:01,231
Where's the new wine?

858
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:04,985
Dying on the vine.

859
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:12,242
See, l lied to you.

860
01:07:17,372 --> 01:07:19,291
l loved fame.

861
01:07:19,374 --> 01:07:22,044
l do love fame.

862
01:07:28,759 --> 01:07:30,969
- Why are you doing this to me?
- 'Cause you're here.

863
01:07:31,053 --> 01:07:32,888
And that's gonna help?

864
01:07:34,056 --> 01:07:37,226
l don't have this problem
with anybody else.

865
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:39,228
Suck it, honey.
Come on.

866
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:41,313
- Fuck you.
- Where you goin'? Huh?

867
01:07:41,396 --> 01:07:43,315
Where do you think you're going?

868
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:45,901
Love my girl!

869
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:47,986
How many guys have you fucked?

870
01:07:48,028 --> 01:07:50,614
And how many dogs
have you fucked?

871
01:07:50,656 --> 01:07:53,492
You're the only one
who couldn't make it, you asshole!

872
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:56,995
You are the only limp dick
in the lot!

873
01:07:59,831 --> 01:08:01,750
Will you die for me?

874
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,420
- Answer me!
- Will you die for me?

875
01:08:05,504 --> 01:08:07,047
Sure.

876
01:08:07,089 --> 01:08:08,590
l'd die for anybody.

877
01:08:08,674 --> 01:08:12,219
Shut up in there!
l'm trying to sleep in here!

878
01:08:16,515 --> 01:08:18,141
- Will you die for me?
- Yes!

879
01:08:18,225 --> 01:08:19,560
l don't believe you!

880
01:08:19,601 --> 01:08:21,562
- Say it!
- Yes. Yes.

881
01:08:29,945 --> 01:08:31,905
l'm just a clown.

882
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,825
Am l a clown?

883
01:08:41,582 --> 01:08:43,083
l need a home...

884
01:08:44,293 --> 01:08:45,919
a place to hide.

885
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,131
l'm sorry.

886
01:08:49,214 --> 01:08:52,509
We're gonna fuck death away.
Come on.

887
01:08:54,803 --> 01:08:57,556
Let's fuck death away.
Come on, baby. All right.

888
01:09:02,311 --> 01:09:06,231
An ancient lunatic reigns
in the trees of the night.

889
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:24,833
We've got
a serious problem here.

890
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,836
The fire marshal
won't let this concert go on...

891
01:09:27,878 --> 01:09:30,881
unless you clear the aisles
and go back to your seats.

892
01:09:30,923 --> 01:09:34,259
Unless you clear these aisles,
there is no show.

893
01:09:34,343 --> 01:09:36,553
The sound of the crowd.

894
01:09:36,595 --> 01:09:39,723
l don't even like rock groups.
They're sleazy.

895
01:09:42,392 --> 01:09:44,311
- You like that, huh?
- Like Nuremberg.

896
01:09:44,394 --> 01:09:46,313
- Like that?
- We're Germans.

897
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:49,608
- Beg.
- l'm begging.

898
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:52,778
You wanna fuck me?

899
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:56,949
Don't ever fuckin' lie
to me again.

900
01:09:56,990 --> 01:10:01,703
- About what?
- Why did you say your father was dead?

901
01:10:01,787 --> 01:10:04,164
He is dead.
Both of them. Totally.

902
01:10:04,248 --> 01:10:07,459
lf he's so dead,
who answered the phone when l called?

903
01:10:07,543 --> 01:10:08,961
What?

904
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:14,132
You didn't really think you were
getting away with that, did you?

905
01:10:14,216 --> 01:10:16,802
Your father's an admiral
in the Navy...

906
01:10:16,885 --> 01:10:20,806
who was at the Gulf of Tonkin
when the Vietnam War broke out.

907
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,563
Wow.

908
01:10:27,688 --> 01:10:30,691
Your dad's deputy chief
of operations.

909
01:10:30,774 --> 01:10:33,277
Just don't ever lie
to me again.

910
01:10:41,118 --> 01:10:42,536
What?

911
01:10:46,164 --> 01:10:47,708
You shouldn't have done that.

912
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:51,211
Like it's so hard
to trace your school records?

913
01:10:51,295 --> 01:10:55,757
You went to University of Florida,
Albuquerque, New Mexico...

914
01:10:55,883 --> 01:10:58,385
Arlington, Virginia...

915
01:10:58,468 --> 01:11:00,554
Washington, D.C.

916
01:11:01,638 --> 01:11:04,558
You have a brother
and a sister.

917
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:08,061
"Seven Miles Long," baby.
lt's all in "The End."

918
01:11:23,327 --> 01:11:24,661
l'm sorry.

919
01:11:25,746 --> 01:11:27,664
What did he do?

920
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:31,168
Did he love you?

921
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:36,006
How much?

922
01:11:41,011 --> 01:11:42,930
Your mama?

923
01:11:49,436 --> 01:11:52,356
Hatred's
a very underestimated emotion.

924
01:11:54,566 --> 01:11:56,860
Doesn't matter anymore,
does it?

925
01:11:58,570 --> 01:12:02,032
Do you hear them out there?
Are you listening to them?

926
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,078
lt's you they want now.

927
01:12:07,788 --> 01:12:09,748
lt's not the Doors.

928
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:13,836
lt's not your mother
or your father's child.

929
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,588
lt's you.

930
01:12:19,258 --> 01:12:22,470
They don't want me.
They want my death.

931
01:12:22,553 --> 01:12:24,472
Ripped to pieces.

932
01:12:26,224 --> 01:12:28,392
Patricia, just hold me.

933
01:12:31,395 --> 01:12:32,605
What you doin' there?

934
01:12:34,607 --> 01:12:36,192
- Nothin'.
- Okay, out.

935
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:37,777
No one's allowed backstage.

936
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:41,447
- Don't you know who this is?
- lt's cool. l'm with the band.

937
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,449
Let's go. Come on.

938
01:12:43,532 --> 01:12:45,660
- Cool it, pig.
- Fuckin' hippie!

939
01:12:46,577 --> 01:12:47,954
Motherfucker!

940
01:12:52,416 --> 01:12:53,834
They got Jim!

941
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:56,587
What's happening?

942
01:12:56,629 --> 01:12:59,465
What the fuck is going on here?

943
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,843
l'm blind!

944
01:13:02,927 --> 01:13:05,972
- He's under arrest.
- Don't shut your eyes, Jim!

945
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:09,475
We gotta get you out.

946
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:12,144
Leave him alone.

947
01:13:12,186 --> 01:13:15,648
- He doesn't need more shit in his life.
- What do you know what he needs?

948
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:24,907
Fuck!

949
01:13:25,992 --> 01:13:27,410
All right

950
01:13:28,494 --> 01:13:30,037
Okay

951
01:13:31,247 --> 01:13:32,665
All right

952
01:13:39,964 --> 01:13:41,382
l am

953
01:13:43,551 --> 01:13:46,554
Your back door man

954
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:49,307
"Light My Fire!"

955
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:53,561
Men don't know

956
01:13:53,644 --> 01:13:57,023
Little girls understand

957
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:59,233
Fire! "Light My Fire!"

958
01:14:02,403 --> 01:14:04,071
Well, all your people

959
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:06,866
Tryin' to sleep

960
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:09,869
l'm out there makin'

961
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,580
Midnight creep

962
01:14:18,336 --> 01:14:20,254
Back door man

963
01:14:23,841 --> 01:14:26,093
Men don't know

964
01:14:26,135 --> 01:14:27,261
Little girls

965
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,305
Understand

966
01:14:32,350 --> 01:14:34,435
All right, yeah

967
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,647
Come on

968
01:14:57,667 --> 01:15:00,002
Persian night, babe

969
01:15:02,213 --> 01:15:04,799
See that light, babe

970
01:15:06,717 --> 01:15:08,886
Save us

971
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,599
Jesus

972
01:15:15,893 --> 01:15:18,437
Save us

973
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:42,044
l want to tell you about something
that happened a few minutes ago...

974
01:15:42,128 --> 01:15:44,547
right here in New Haven.

975
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:47,592
This is New Haven, isn't it?
New Haven, Connecticut?

976
01:15:48,885 --> 01:15:51,262
United States of America?

977
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:55,099
ls the West really the best...

978
01:15:55,182 --> 01:15:58,019
or are you just stoned on weed?

979
01:15:58,102 --> 01:16:00,354
Come on!
Sing "Light My Fire."

980
01:16:15,328 --> 01:16:17,830
l was with this girl backstage.

981
01:16:18,873 --> 01:16:21,542
We wanted some privacy...

982
01:16:21,626 --> 01:16:24,212
so we went into
this shower stall.

983
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:29,842
We weren't doing anything.
We were just talking.

984
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,804
All of the sudden this--

985
01:16:33,846 --> 01:16:36,098
this little man came in...

986
01:16:36,182 --> 01:16:39,685
with a little blue hat
and a little blue suit.

987
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,108
He said,
"What you doin' in there?"

988
01:16:46,192 --> 01:16:48,069
l said, "Nothing."

989
01:16:48,861 --> 01:16:50,279
And he said...

990
01:16:50,363 --> 01:16:53,407
"Well, you'd better
get out of there or--"

991
01:16:53,491 --> 01:16:55,826
"Or what?" l said.

992
01:16:55,910 --> 01:16:57,828
And he started pushin' me.

993
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,499
So l started pushin' back!

994
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:04,293
He didn't like that.

995
01:17:10,716 --> 01:17:14,637
Then he reached behind
and pulled out a can of Mace...

996
01:17:16,973 --> 01:17:19,934
and sprayed it right in my eyes.

997
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,937
Fuckin' blinded me!

998
01:17:24,647 --> 01:17:26,315
Why?

999
01:17:26,357 --> 01:17:30,027
All because l was alone
in a room with a girl...

1000
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:34,657
doing what he'd like to be doing if
he could only get it up without a gun.

1001
01:17:34,699 --> 01:17:36,492
All right!

1002
01:17:37,618 --> 01:17:40,454
ln the United States
of America, man!

1003
01:17:41,497 --> 01:17:44,166
Land of the free,
home of the brave!

1004
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,252
ln God we trust!

1005
01:17:52,675 --> 01:17:54,510
Say your thing, man.

1006
01:17:54,552 --> 01:17:57,305
Mr. Morrison,
you've gone too far.

1007
01:17:57,346 --> 01:17:59,515
The show's over.

1008
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,269
You've violated
state obscenity laws.

1009
01:18:03,352 --> 01:18:05,855
- You're under arrest!
- There you go!

1010
01:18:15,406 --> 01:18:17,366
Out of the way!

1011
01:18:17,408 --> 01:18:20,036
Get out of the way!

1012
01:18:25,207 --> 01:18:27,126
Back! Keep 'em back!

1013
01:18:29,754 --> 01:18:32,215
Get your hands off me,
you slaves.

1014
01:18:34,258 --> 01:18:37,261
This isn't happening to me, man.
lt's happening to you.

1015
01:18:44,602 --> 01:18:48,189
Let's just say l was testing
the bounds of reality.

1016
01:18:48,272 --> 01:18:50,191
That's all.
l was curious.

1017
01:18:51,776 --> 01:18:54,737
l always preferred
to be hated...

1018
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:57,949
like Erich von Stroheim
in the movies.

1019
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:00,034
The man you love to hate.

1020
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:03,913
lt's meant to be ironic...

1021
01:19:03,996 --> 01:19:06,874
like courage wants to laugh.

1022
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:10,586
Essentially, a stupid situation.

1023
01:19:10,670 --> 01:19:13,714
l go out on the stage
and howl for people.

1024
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:19,178
ln me they see exactly
what they wanna see.

1025
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:23,349
Some say "lizard king,"
whatever that means.

1026
01:19:24,684 --> 01:19:26,644
Or some black-clad leather demon...

1027
01:19:26,686 --> 01:19:28,646
whatever that means.

1028
01:19:30,314 --> 01:19:32,775
But really,
l think of myself...

1029
01:19:33,943 --> 01:19:36,862
as a sensitive,
intelligent human being...

1030
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:42,285
but with the soul of a clown
that always forces me to blow it...

1031
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:44,829
at the most crucial moments.

1032
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:54,589
l'm a fake hero.

1033
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,427
A joke that God's played on me.

1034
01:19:59,468 --> 01:19:59,510
Good morning.

1035
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:01,262
Good morning.

1036
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:03,306
Pour me my breakfast,
Dolores.

1037
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:08,561
What's the matter with Jimbo?
Can't handle it, eh?

1038
01:20:08,644 --> 01:20:09,937
He's pussy-whipped.

1039
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:13,608
Hey, Jim, eat this, man.
We got one last place to go.

1040
01:20:13,691 --> 01:20:15,610
Ray's getting married this morning.
Remember?

1041
01:20:15,693 --> 01:20:17,278
"Alive, she cried."

1042
01:20:17,403 --> 01:20:19,739
Can't eat that.
lt'll make me sick.

1043
01:20:19,822 --> 01:20:22,575
Give me a Dos Equis,
will you, Dolores.

1044
01:20:22,658 --> 01:20:26,329
- And a Ramos fizz.
- What happened to you last night?

1045
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:30,666
You bet me $1,000 you were gonna
walk on the ledge of the 9000 building.

1046
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:31,959
Let's go right now.

1047
01:20:32,001 --> 01:20:35,671
Complaining about going home
to your sanctuary.

1048
01:20:35,713 --> 01:20:37,673
We were gonna make a movie.

1049
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:41,177
You bet me 1,000 bucks, man.

1050
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:43,804
- Give him a double.
- A triple.

1051
01:20:43,846 --> 01:20:46,349
lmagine me and Morrison
in a movie together.

1052
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:48,684
Two powerful, two lrish...

1053
01:20:48,768 --> 01:20:52,980
two-fisted fuckin' drinkin' guys
in the same movie together.

1054
01:20:53,022 --> 01:20:54,482
l'll direct it.

1055
01:20:54,523 --> 01:20:56,984
lf Dennis Hopper can do it,
l can.

1056
01:20:57,026 --> 01:21:00,988
We'll all three direct it.
A real road movie in black and white.

1057
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:02,990
We'll call it Zero.

1058
01:21:05,034 --> 01:21:06,994
- What the fuck?
- Fuck you, Morrison!

1059
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:08,746
Get outta here!

1060
01:21:08,788 --> 01:21:10,039
Fuckin' jack-off!

1061
01:21:17,213 --> 01:21:19,131
Keep the drink.

1062
01:21:20,716 --> 01:21:20,758
lt's only another 95,000...

1063
01:21:20,758 --> 01:21:24,345
lt's only another 95,000...

1064
01:21:24,428 --> 01:21:28,516
but l could get the best clothes
from lndia, from Morocco, Jim.

1065
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:30,518
Clothes you couldn't get
anywhere else.

1066
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:34,313
Then we could get the richest
people to come-- Miles Davis...

1067
01:21:34,397 --> 01:21:37,483
Sonny and Cher, the Stones.

1068
01:21:37,567 --> 01:21:40,945
lt could be the best boutique
on La Cienega, Jim.

1069
01:21:41,028 --> 01:21:43,656
Why don't we have a car?

1070
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:46,409
- We lost it.
- Yeah, but...

1071
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:48,411
where's the gravy train?

1072
01:21:53,249 --> 01:21:56,252
What's the matter with you?
What are you on?

1073
01:21:56,335 --> 01:21:58,546
You said you wouldn't
drink today.

1074
01:21:58,629 --> 01:22:01,340
No, Ma, l ain't drinkin'.

1075
01:22:01,424 --> 01:22:05,177
You promised you wouldn't drink anymore.
You're not gonna drink, are you?

1076
01:22:05,261 --> 01:22:06,929
No, Ma, l ain't.

1077
01:22:07,013 --> 01:22:10,725
And you're gonna change those stinky
leathers you've worn for three weeks.

1078
01:22:10,808 --> 01:22:13,185
l don't know about that.

1079
01:22:13,227 --> 01:22:15,187
What are you on?

1080
01:22:16,939 --> 01:22:19,984
lt's just some low-grade acid.
lt's not heavy.

1081
01:22:20,026 --> 01:22:21,903
Oh, Jim!

1082
01:22:21,986 --> 01:22:24,405
Oh, God! l cooked!

1083
01:22:24,488 --> 01:22:26,532
- l cooked the duck!
- lt's okay.

1084
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:28,910
People are coming, you know.

1085
01:22:28,993 --> 01:22:32,121
Ray and Dorothy think
that we're flaky enough.

1086
01:22:32,204 --> 01:22:36,042
You said we'd wait until after,
and now you're gonna peak before me.

1087
01:22:36,083 --> 01:22:39,378
No, it's cool. We'll trip,
and then we'll eat our feast.

1088
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:41,214
Yeah, sure. No!

1089
01:22:41,255 --> 01:22:44,926
You know, l think it's a good thing
about Ray and Dorothy.

1090
01:22:45,009 --> 01:22:46,928
l do.

1091
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:49,013
Women are such noble creatures.

1092
01:22:49,096 --> 01:22:52,350
They carry on your name
with dignity after you die.

1093
01:22:54,977 --> 01:22:57,939
Are you saying you want to
marry me, Jim Morrison?

1094
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:05,071
l think women have a comic
approach to life. How can they not?

1095
01:23:05,112 --> 01:23:08,699
They spend their lives
with that big dick seeking entry.

1096
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:10,451
Come on, Mom.

1097
01:23:10,493 --> 01:23:14,622
l want to look inside,
like a spy.

1098
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,793
l'm a spy

1099
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:22,838
ln the house of love

1100
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:27,635
l know the dream

1101
01:23:28,844 --> 01:23:32,765
That you're dreamin' of

1102
01:23:32,848 --> 01:23:36,269
l know the word

1103
01:23:37,562 --> 01:23:41,732
That you long to hear

1104
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:46,362
l know your deepest

1105
01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:49,240
Secret fear

1106
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:53,619
l know

1107
01:23:53,703 --> 01:23:55,788
Everything

1108
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,418
l love it
when you sing to me.

1109
01:24:00,501 --> 01:24:01,544
That's 'cause...

1110
01:24:02,378 --> 01:24:05,298
l'm the poet
and you're my muse.

1111
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:09,051
"Lions in the street, roaming.

1112
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:11,888
"Lions in the street, roaming.

1113
01:24:11,929 --> 01:24:15,099
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming.

1114
01:24:15,182 --> 01:24:18,936
A beast, caged in the heart
of the city, rotting...

1115
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,646
in the summer ground.

1116
01:24:20,771 --> 01:24:22,064
He fled the town...

1117
01:24:22,106 --> 01:24:24,609
left the chaos and disorder
back there--u

1118
01:24:24,692 --> 01:24:27,069
Hey, everybody.
Here's the nuptial couple.

1119
01:24:28,195 --> 01:24:31,115
What am l gonna do
about all these papers?

1120
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:32,783
- Get a drink.
- Jim.

1121
01:24:34,118 --> 01:24:37,747
You really need somebody
to organize all this stuff.

1122
01:24:37,830 --> 01:24:41,000
Your handwriting
is just like a little kid.

1123
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:45,254
Look at this. l wonder if William Blake
was ever this disorganized.

1124
01:24:49,133 --> 01:24:52,261
- You're trying too hard.
- l'm gonna be your editor now.

1125
01:24:52,345 --> 01:24:57,433
l'm gonna organize all this stuff
and take out all the "fuck" words.

1126
01:24:57,516 --> 01:25:01,520
- Honey, you're trying too hard.
- No, l'm not.

1127
01:25:01,604 --> 01:25:05,274
There's some great poetry here,
some wonderful ideas.

1128
01:25:05,358 --> 01:25:06,859
Come on in!

1129
01:25:08,527 --> 01:25:10,029
- Hey, Jimbo!
- Hey, man.

1130
01:25:10,112 --> 01:25:12,907
Hi, baby.
How's it goin'?

1131
01:25:13,991 --> 01:25:16,494
- Yo, Ray.
- Hey, Dog, how you doin'?

1132
01:25:16,535 --> 01:25:20,248
- Get some drinks over there.
- What am l supposed to do?

1133
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:25,920
Who am l supposed to be
around all these people?

1134
01:25:26,003 --> 01:25:27,338
Darling Pamela.

1135
01:25:28,214 --> 01:25:30,132
l brought you something.

1136
01:25:31,884 --> 01:25:33,886
You're my girl, that's who.

1137
01:25:35,179 --> 01:25:37,098
l'm not your girl.

1138
01:25:38,307 --> 01:25:42,436
l know you fuck everything
that touches you.

1139
01:25:42,478 --> 01:25:44,981
- Don't give me that shit.
- Come on.

1140
01:25:46,065 --> 01:25:48,609
l love my girl!
Listen, everybody!

1141
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:50,278
Pam and l--

1142
01:25:51,362 --> 01:25:52,947
She's lookin' good.

1143
01:25:52,989 --> 01:25:54,448
And to celebrate--

1144
01:25:55,533 --> 01:25:57,451
- Hey, Patricia.
- Hi, Jim.

1145
01:26:00,538 --> 01:26:02,456
Pam, have you met--

1146
01:26:02,540 --> 01:26:03,791
Do you know--

1147
01:26:03,833 --> 01:26:08,212
She wrote this great review
of my poetry book.

1148
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:11,966
- Let's go eat that turkey.
- Pam, let's set those plates.

1149
01:26:12,049 --> 01:26:14,385
Are you Patricia Kennealy?

1150
01:26:14,468 --> 01:26:15,970
You must be Pamela.

1151
01:26:20,474 --> 01:26:22,852
You actually put your dick
in this woman?

1152
01:26:24,437 --> 01:26:26,063
Well...

1153
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,648
sometimes, yeah.

1154
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,321
Well, l understand.
l really do.

1155
01:26:33,362 --> 01:26:37,199
But don't ever expect that Jim's
gonna love you or take care of you...

1156
01:26:37,283 --> 01:26:39,201
because you're one
of a hundred.

1157
01:26:39,285 --> 01:26:43,164
- You don't know when to stop.
- Look who's talking.

1158
01:26:43,205 --> 01:26:47,418
Jim can make up his own mind
about who he loves and who he doesn't.

1159
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:48,920
Don't kid yourself, sweetheart.

1160
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:52,673
He's crazy, but not that crazy.
He loves me.

1161
01:26:52,715 --> 01:26:54,675
Let's go check
those sweet potatoes.

1162
01:26:54,717 --> 01:26:57,386
- There they go again.
- Chuck!

1163
01:26:57,470 --> 01:27:00,723
Gonna be another one of those dinners?
You're gonna have to stop this.

1164
01:27:00,806 --> 01:27:05,269
l'm glad you made it.
Jim, Robbie, meet Chuck Vincent.

1165
01:27:07,939 --> 01:27:11,150
l just have one more thing
to say to you, Jim Morrison.

1166
01:27:11,234 --> 01:27:14,111
You have ruined
another Thanksgiving.

1167
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:16,614
Bastard!
You killed my duck!

1168
01:27:20,952 --> 01:27:23,287
You ruined my duck!

1169
01:27:26,624 --> 01:27:28,626
What did you do to her?

1170
01:27:28,709 --> 01:27:31,295
lt's all right.
We're working it out.

1171
01:27:31,337 --> 01:27:32,797
We'll work it out.

1172
01:27:32,838 --> 01:27:34,799
lt's okay.

1173
01:27:41,305 --> 01:27:42,723
Fuck you!

1174
01:27:53,859 --> 01:27:56,779
You want to know
what murder is?

1175
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:58,781
You want a little death?

1176
01:27:59,865 --> 01:28:01,117
Well, come on.

1177
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,411
You want a little death?

1178
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:07,039
Then kill me.
Go on, kill me. Come on.

1179
01:28:08,165 --> 01:28:10,376
Kill me. Go on!

1180
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:12,712
Come on, give me some death!

1181
01:28:15,256 --> 01:28:17,216
You killed my duck.

1182
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:25,182
And l'm still killing
your fucking duck.

1183
01:28:25,224 --> 01:28:27,852
There! Murder! Death!

1184
01:28:27,894 --> 01:28:29,395
Duck! Dead!

1185
01:28:29,478 --> 01:28:31,105
Dead! Fucking dead!

1186
01:28:31,188 --> 01:28:34,692
There! The duck is dead!

1187
01:28:34,775 --> 01:28:37,737
- That's the incredible truth!
- Stop this shit! Get sane!

1188
01:28:37,778 --> 01:28:40,197
Don't ever tell me what to do!

1189
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:42,325
- Yeah, fuck off, Ray.
- Fuck off, Ray.

1190
01:28:44,744 --> 01:28:46,662
This party's gettin' low-rent.

1191
01:28:46,746 --> 01:28:48,289
Let's split.

1192
01:28:48,372 --> 01:28:50,333
Looks like
we're not gonna eat.

1193
01:28:50,458 --> 01:28:51,876
Shit.

1194
01:28:53,711 --> 01:28:56,297
Fuck it.
Let's eat this thing.

1195
01:28:56,422 --> 01:29:00,009
What happened to us,
Daddy, huh?

1196
01:29:03,179 --> 01:29:05,806
There was some
beautiful poetry, you know.

1197
01:29:05,932 --> 01:29:07,350
Hold on, honey.

1198
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:09,644
There was some
beautiful poetry, Daddy.

1199
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:21,364
Action!

1200
01:29:21,364 --> 01:29:22,949
Action!

1201
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:43,010
Your mother's here
with your brother.

1202
01:29:43,094 --> 01:29:46,764
l don't want to see 'em, okay?

1203
01:29:46,889 --> 01:29:49,642
- What do you want me to do with 'em?
- You hear me?

1204
01:29:49,725 --> 01:29:50,935
They're waiting!

1205
01:29:52,019 --> 01:29:53,813
Ladies and gentlemen...

1206
01:29:53,896 --> 01:29:56,107
from Los Angeles, California...

1207
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:58,401
the Doors!

1208
01:29:58,484 --> 01:30:00,611
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

1209
01:30:25,344 --> 01:30:27,305
Not to touch the earth

1210
01:30:27,346 --> 01:30:29,640
Not to see the sun

1211
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:33,227
Nothing left to do
but run, run, run

1212
01:30:33,311 --> 01:30:34,228
Let's run

1213
01:30:37,648 --> 01:30:39,442
Let's run

1214
01:30:42,653 --> 01:30:44,697
House upon the hill

1215
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:46,782
Moon is lying still

1216
01:30:46,866 --> 01:30:48,910
Shadows of the trees

1217
01:30:48,993 --> 01:30:51,037
Witnessing the wild breeze

1218
01:30:51,078 --> 01:30:53,831
Come on, baby, run with me

1219
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:55,625
Come on, honey.

1220
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:58,628
l been so lonely.
l miss my girl.

1221
01:31:02,882 --> 01:31:05,509
l didn't realize
you were entertaining.

1222
01:31:06,677 --> 01:31:09,096
l hope you are cool about this.

1223
01:31:10,723 --> 01:31:13,142
Don't forget your smack
on the way out.

1224
01:31:14,101 --> 01:31:15,770
The mansion is warm

1225
01:31:15,853 --> 01:31:17,939
At the top of the hill

1226
01:31:18,022 --> 01:31:20,942
Rich are the rooms
and the comforts there

1227
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:23,152
Red are the arms

1228
01:31:23,236 --> 01:31:25,071
Of luxuriant chairs

1229
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:29,325
And you won't know a thing
'til you get inside here

1230
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:38,292
Yeah? Looking for a place
to hide, or to die?

1231
01:31:38,376 --> 01:31:41,587
Just doing my thing,
like you said.

1232
01:31:42,463 --> 01:31:44,882
- What?
- You're hurting me.

1233
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,217
Are you in pain?

1234
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:49,220
Let me introduce you
to my friend pain.

1235
01:31:51,806 --> 01:31:53,558
Fuck you.

1236
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:56,727
Oh, sanctuary.
Looking for a place to hide?

1237
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,730
- l'll give you a place to hide.
- From you, you pig.

1238
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:01,732
Forever.

1239
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:07,738
Hey, honey, this is
the best part of the trip.

1240
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,741
Sanctuary.

1241
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:13,494
Come on, baby.
Come on, honey.

1242
01:32:14,537 --> 01:32:15,788
Almost home.

1243
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:21,002
We're almost home, baby.

1244
01:32:35,975 --> 01:32:37,059
Help!

1245
01:32:37,143 --> 01:32:39,729
- lt's blinding me.
- Help! l'm blind!

1246
01:32:41,898 --> 01:32:42,982
That's better.

1247
01:32:44,317 --> 01:32:45,902
Ride 'em, cowboy!

1248
01:32:46,694 --> 01:32:48,613
- Look out.
- What?

1249
01:32:48,696 --> 01:32:50,615
- There's a cop. Slow down.
- Where?

1250
01:32:50,698 --> 01:32:52,825
Right there in front!
Look!

1251
01:32:55,244 --> 01:32:58,706
Dead president's corpse
in the driver's car

1252
01:32:58,789 --> 01:33:03,044
The engine
runs on glue and tar

1253
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:06,714
Come on along
Not goin' very far

1254
01:33:06,797 --> 01:33:10,635
To the East
to meet the czar, yeah

1255
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,311
By a right line, the running line,
the crooked and the straight...

1256
01:33:20,394 --> 01:33:21,979
l summon you up.

1257
01:33:22,104 --> 01:33:27,318
By wood and stone, wind and fire,
land and water, l bring you in.

1258
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:30,655
We worship the ancient forces
of nature.

1259
01:33:30,696 --> 01:33:33,074
The Great Mother,
the Triple Goddess...

1260
01:33:33,157 --> 01:33:35,618
and the Horned One,
god of the hunt.

1261
01:33:36,702 --> 01:33:38,162
Death does not part...

1262
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:40,331
only lack of love.

1263
01:33:40,456 --> 01:33:42,124
The goddess holds the vow forever.

1264
01:33:43,542 --> 01:33:45,294
Run with me

1265
01:33:47,088 --> 01:33:49,006
Run with me

1266
01:33:54,178 --> 01:33:55,304
Let's run

1267
01:35:13,716 --> 01:35:17,220
The outlaws live
by the side of the lake

1268
01:35:17,303 --> 01:35:20,556
The minister's daughter's
in love with a snake

1269
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:24,727
Who lives in a well
by the side of the road

1270
01:35:24,769 --> 01:35:28,564
Wake up, girl
We're almost home, yeah

1271
01:35:32,485 --> 01:35:34,904
We could see the gates
by morning

1272
01:35:38,991 --> 01:35:41,994
We should be inside
by evening

1273
01:35:45,665 --> 01:35:47,959
Sun, sun, sun

1274
01:35:52,338 --> 01:35:53,965
Moon, moon, moon

1275
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:01,347
l will gain you

1276
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:03,182
Soon

1277
01:36:18,406 --> 01:36:20,491
l am the lizard king.

1278
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:24,495
l can do anything.

1279
01:37:01,282 --> 01:37:05,578
Come on, come on, come on
Come on now, touch me, babe

1280
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:09,749
Can't you see
that l am not afraid

1281
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,961
What was that promise
that you made

1282
01:37:15,296 --> 01:37:19,425
Why won't you tell me
what she said

1283
01:37:21,052 --> 01:37:24,680
Fuckin' Neanderthal prima donna.
Too drunk to fuckin' sing.

1284
01:37:24,764 --> 01:37:28,643
l'm gonna love you

1285
01:37:28,684 --> 01:37:33,439
'Til the heavens
stop the rain

1286
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:37,318
l'm gonna love you

1287
01:37:37,401 --> 01:37:41,822
'Til the stars
fall from the sky

1288
01:37:41,864 --> 01:37:43,491
You and l

1289
01:37:43,574 --> 01:37:45,493
Cut. Cut.

1290
01:37:46,786 --> 01:37:50,331
Terrific take, Jim. We just had
a technical problem in here.

1291
01:37:50,414 --> 01:37:52,792
What's his fuckin' problem, man?

1292
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:55,545
- Paul, babe.
- Yeah, right here, babe.

1293
01:37:55,628 --> 01:37:57,922
Suck a fart
out of my asshole...

1294
01:37:58,005 --> 01:38:00,132
you slave-driving fascist--

1295
01:38:03,886 --> 01:38:06,847
- l hear the booze, the smoke.
- Sixty-seven takes?

1296
01:38:06,889 --> 01:38:10,101
- l don't hear your voice or the song.
- Because it's stale!

1297
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:12,103
- "Stale"?
- l wanna do my thing!

1298
01:38:12,186 --> 01:38:15,314
We'll do 167 takes
until it sounds like music.

1299
01:38:15,398 --> 01:38:19,402
Let's do something else.
You're all a bunch of fuckin' slaves.

1300
01:38:19,527 --> 01:38:21,070
Let's do--

1301
01:38:21,153 --> 01:38:23,447
Come on, come on, come on.

1302
01:38:23,531 --> 01:38:24,991
Rock is dead.

1303
01:38:25,074 --> 01:38:28,494
Everybody come out here.
We'll do a sing-along.

1304
01:38:28,578 --> 01:38:31,581
O come, all ye faithful

1305
01:38:31,622 --> 01:38:34,584
- Get this circus outta here.
- lt's too self-conscious.

1306
01:38:35,751 --> 01:38:39,171
Billy, get 'em out!
You, you, you! Let's go!

1307
01:38:39,255 --> 01:38:41,215
You deaf? Beat it!
Let's go!

1308
01:38:41,257 --> 01:38:42,633
See you later.

1309
01:38:43,759 --> 01:38:45,678
What are you doing, Jim?

1310
01:38:45,761 --> 01:38:49,098
l'm sitting in
that fuckin' booth for months.

1311
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:52,894
l look out of the glass,
l see Jim, l hear Jim...

1312
01:38:52,977 --> 01:38:55,187
but l miss him.

1313
01:38:55,313 --> 01:38:59,191
And he's standing right in front of me.
How do you explain that?

1314
01:39:01,193 --> 01:39:04,196
Don't make me go through
this whole shit again...

1315
01:39:04,322 --> 01:39:07,658
watching Janis dive to the bottom
of a bottle of Southern Comfort.

1316
01:39:07,742 --> 01:39:10,244
l won't go through it again.

1317
01:39:11,329 --> 01:39:13,247
Why are you fucking this up?

1318
01:39:16,918 --> 01:39:21,130
l love you, man.
You're my own flesh and blood.

1319
01:39:24,926 --> 01:39:26,677
Catchy tune.

1320
01:39:27,678 --> 01:39:29,597
You sold it to a commercial?

1321
01:39:35,186 --> 01:39:37,146
- How much?
- Seventy-five thousand.

1322
01:39:37,230 --> 01:39:39,565
We couldn't reach you.
We figured--

1323
01:39:39,607 --> 01:39:43,194
- What is this shit, Ray?
- lt's not a big deal, man.

1324
01:39:43,236 --> 01:39:45,196
The song has already
been commercialized.

1325
01:39:45,238 --> 01:39:47,698
Feliciano's already sold
two million copies.

1326
01:39:49,075 --> 01:39:51,953
Robbie thought it was a good idea.
So did John.

1327
01:39:52,036 --> 01:39:53,287
So did l.

1328
01:39:54,372 --> 01:39:55,790
Robbie?

1329
01:39:58,918 --> 01:40:01,379
Where were you?
You should've been here.

1330
01:40:03,798 --> 01:40:07,718
Do you know what you're saying
to millions of people?

1331
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:12,431
The Doors-- all for one,
one for all-- not real.

1332
01:40:15,017 --> 01:40:17,770
lt's not about money...

1333
01:40:17,812 --> 01:40:19,772
or records or success...

1334
01:40:19,814 --> 01:40:21,774
or these...

1335
01:40:21,816 --> 01:40:23,901
desires that you have.

1336
01:40:23,985 --> 01:40:25,903
lt's about...

1337
01:40:27,196 --> 01:40:29,282
using the music to break through.

1338
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:31,284
Wasn't it, Ray?

1339
01:40:33,828 --> 01:40:35,288
l don't know.

1340
01:40:36,956 --> 01:40:38,874
We lost something here, man.

1341
01:40:38,958 --> 01:40:40,877
l don't think so, Jim.

1342
01:40:42,003 --> 01:40:44,672
There's just a bigger picture,
that's all.

1343
01:40:44,714 --> 01:40:46,340
Yeah?

1344
01:40:46,424 --> 01:40:47,800
ln your fucking face!

1345
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,971
Jesus Fuckin' Christ!

1346
01:40:52,013 --> 01:40:54,181
What the fuck is goin' on, man?

1347
01:40:56,809 --> 01:40:58,561
Just kidding.

1348
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:01,606
Oh, hi, honey.

1349
01:41:03,149 --> 01:41:06,068
We were just watching
a little TV.

1350
01:41:06,152 --> 01:41:09,155
l wanted you to find us, Jim.
lt meant nothing.

1351
01:41:13,075 --> 01:41:15,369
You don't have to torture me.

1352
01:41:15,411 --> 01:41:18,372
Just let me make it up to you.

1353
01:41:25,755 --> 01:41:27,423
l love you.

1354
01:41:27,506 --> 01:41:30,218
lt's gonna be all right.

1355
01:41:30,259 --> 01:41:31,719
You're the one.

1356
01:41:32,845 --> 01:41:34,764
- Really?
- You're my girl.

1357
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:40,269
So vulnerable about everything,
it makes me sad.

1358
01:41:41,604 --> 01:41:44,899
All right, let's keep
that money machine rolling.

1359
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:53,741
Can you find me

1360
01:41:53,824 --> 01:41:56,953
Soft asylum

1361
01:41:56,994 --> 01:42:00,456
l can't make it

1362
01:42:00,498 --> 01:42:02,833
Anymore

1363
01:42:02,917 --> 01:42:04,835
The man is

1364
01:42:04,919 --> 01:42:09,382
At the door

1365
01:42:14,011 --> 01:42:16,097
This is the trip, the best part...

1366
01:42:16,180 --> 01:42:18,099
l really like.

1367
01:42:21,352 --> 01:42:25,231
Yeah, l'm proud to be
a part of this number!

1368
01:42:28,401 --> 01:42:32,196
Successful hills
are here to stay

1369
01:42:33,406 --> 01:42:36,742
Everything must be this way

1370
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:41,747
All our lives
we sweat and save

1371
01:42:42,957 --> 01:42:46,586
Buildin' for a shallow grave

1372
01:42:49,589 --> 01:42:53,593
The soft parade has now begun

1373
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,013
Cobra on my left

1374
01:42:57,096 --> 01:43:00,766
Leopard on my right, yeah

1375
01:43:03,519 --> 01:43:05,521
Come on

1376
01:43:06,606 --> 01:43:11,068
And it's getting harder

1377
01:43:11,152 --> 01:43:13,654
Callin' on the dogs

1378
01:43:13,779 --> 01:43:15,698
When all else fails

1379
01:43:15,781 --> 01:43:18,868
We can whip the horses' eyes

1380
01:43:18,993 --> 01:43:21,996
And make them sleep

1381
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:23,664
And cry

1382
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:28,586
l love you.

1383
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:36,677
Hate your next-door neighbor

1384
01:43:36,802 --> 01:43:39,222
But don't forget to say grace and

1385
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:42,141
Tell me over and over

1386
01:43:42,225 --> 01:43:45,728
And over and over again, my friend

1387
01:43:45,811 --> 01:43:48,147
You don't believe

1388
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:52,318
We're on the eve of destruction

1389
01:43:53,861 --> 01:43:56,197
A hot night in Miami, March '69.

1390
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,532
Every space in the auditorium
is consumed.

1391
01:43:58,616 --> 01:44:01,786
Unfortunately, The Doors have long
since sold out. They've become an act.

1392
01:44:01,869 --> 01:44:05,164
Morrison falls off the stage
at least every other performance.

1393
01:44:05,248 --> 01:44:09,001
"The Soft Parade" album only confirms
the plasticity of their approach.

1394
01:44:09,085 --> 01:44:11,462
Songs like "Touch Me"
and "Tell All the People"...

1395
01:44:11,546 --> 01:44:13,589
are not the Doors we once knew.

1396
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:16,050
So the question is:
why am l here?

1397
01:44:16,092 --> 01:44:18,511
Are funerals entertainment?

1398
01:44:18,594 --> 01:44:21,264
- He's not going to show.
- Show time is show time.

1399
01:44:21,305 --> 01:44:24,183
This guy's done it to us too many times.
We should go on without him.

1400
01:44:24,267 --> 01:44:27,812
Bill is with him. They're an hour away.
He'll get him here, all right?

1401
01:44:27,895 --> 01:44:31,274
He fucking better
get him here, man.

1402
01:44:31,357 --> 01:44:33,943
- Hey, he'll be here.
- l'll tell you one goddamn thing.

1403
01:44:34,026 --> 01:44:36,696
There's gonna be a show here tonight
if l gotta throw a wig on, man...

1404
01:44:36,779 --> 01:44:38,406
and sing them songs myself.

1405
01:44:38,447 --> 01:44:40,741
Yeah, fuck off.

1406
01:44:40,783 --> 01:44:43,452
How's it going?

1407
01:44:43,494 --> 01:44:45,871
- Hey, dude.
- Yo, Jimbo.

1408
01:44:45,955 --> 01:44:48,457
- Clean up your act.
- You asshole.

1409
01:44:48,499 --> 01:44:51,294
l love you!
Hey, listen, Paul.

1410
01:44:51,335 --> 01:44:53,337
- Can you get us some heroin?
- No.

1411
01:44:53,379 --> 01:44:56,215
Why not? Some heroin.

1412
01:44:56,299 --> 01:44:58,134
l am not gonna participate
in anything...

1413
01:44:58,175 --> 01:45:00,636
that's gonna help you
accomplish your goal, Jim.

1414
01:45:00,678 --> 01:45:02,805
What's my goal, Paul?

1415
01:45:03,639 --> 01:45:07,351
Your only friend, the end

1416
01:45:07,393 --> 01:45:11,731
Wrong. l just want to
sing the blues, man.

1417
01:45:11,814 --> 01:45:15,735
Get fat, do nothin', go nowhere.
Just be.

1418
01:45:15,818 --> 01:45:17,528
With that waistline,
you ain't got much choice.

1419
01:45:17,612 --> 01:45:20,197
What is wrong with being
a large mammal?

1420
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:24,368
- A big beast, like a tank.
- You're king crawling flab.

1421
01:45:24,410 --> 01:45:26,579
Rock is cock, baby,
and your rock is dying.

1422
01:45:26,662 --> 01:45:30,583
Rock is death, man.
There's no longer belief.

1423
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:32,752
l'll write poetry...

1424
01:45:32,835 --> 01:45:35,338
and direct movies.

1425
01:45:35,421 --> 01:45:36,672
That's bullshit.

1426
01:45:36,756 --> 01:45:39,926
You tested all the limits--
fame, fucking...

1427
01:45:40,009 --> 01:45:41,260
money.

1428
01:45:41,344 --> 01:45:43,888
What you gonna do
when the music's over, man...

1429
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:47,225
when you're too fat and old
to go out onstage?

1430
01:45:47,266 --> 01:45:51,270
What you gonna do for act three?
Puke on heaven's door?

1431
01:45:51,354 --> 01:45:53,856
Listen, you two-bit fucking actor.

1432
01:45:53,940 --> 01:45:55,942
You underestimate the audience.

1433
01:45:56,025 --> 01:45:58,486
Face it, Jim.
You're not gonna be remembered.

1434
01:45:58,569 --> 01:46:01,322
You think all they want is...

1435
01:46:01,405 --> 01:46:04,492
two cars and a house.

1436
01:46:04,575 --> 01:46:05,952
But you're wrong.

1437
01:46:05,993 --> 01:46:07,954
- You know what they want?
- No. Tell me.

1438
01:46:08,037 --> 01:46:11,374
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, tell me. What?

1439
01:46:11,457 --> 01:46:14,168
Something sacred.

1440
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:16,504
That's what they want.

1441
01:46:16,546 --> 01:46:18,381
Something sacred.

1442
01:46:24,512 --> 01:46:27,265
- He's two hours late!
- Where the fuck are the seats?

1443
01:46:27,348 --> 01:46:30,518
- l took them out.
- How are you doin'?

1444
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:32,061
l'd like you to meet
my new friend.

1445
01:46:32,144 --> 01:46:34,605
- You're not playing, huh?
- We're gonna sue your fucking ass.

1446
01:46:34,689 --> 01:46:38,568
So sue me. lf you ain't playing,
see where your equipment is tomorrow.

1447
01:46:38,651 --> 01:46:40,861
l'm not going out there until
l get some sort of guarantee.

1448
01:46:41,988 --> 01:46:44,865
Come on, John. How will you know
what could have been?

1449
01:46:44,907 --> 01:46:47,410
How will you know
unless you break on through?

1450
01:46:47,493 --> 01:46:49,370
Fucking asshole!

1451
01:46:49,412 --> 01:46:51,205
You're pushing death, Morrison.

1452
01:46:51,289 --> 01:46:53,207
People think we're drug addicts
because of you.

1453
01:46:53,291 --> 01:46:56,878
- Are we the Beatles now, John?
- We took drugs to expand our mind.

1454
01:46:56,961 --> 01:46:59,589
- Not to escape.
- Get him on the fucking stage!

1455
01:46:59,672 --> 01:47:01,632
Listen.

1456
01:47:01,716 --> 01:47:04,010
Have you ever eaten human flesh?

1457
01:47:04,093 --> 01:47:07,889
'Cause l know this chick
in New York, man.

1458
01:47:07,930 --> 01:47:09,932
Hey, it's cool.

1459
01:47:09,974 --> 01:47:12,435
Listen, listen.

1460
01:47:14,270 --> 01:47:17,064
Just one more time,
for old times' sake.

1461
01:47:17,106 --> 01:47:20,192
- l don't want any.
- You'll play like an orgasm.

1462
01:47:20,276 --> 01:47:22,236
Trust me.

1463
01:47:26,991 --> 01:47:28,993
You said you loved pain.

1464
01:47:29,118 --> 01:47:31,704
You run from it
every chance you get.

1465
01:47:34,916 --> 01:47:37,376
Doors! Doors! Doors!

1466
01:48:02,568 --> 01:48:04,779
Are you ready?

1467
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:19,669
Back off!

1468
01:48:20,795 --> 01:48:23,381
l don't want to see
any more of that shit!

1469
01:48:23,464 --> 01:48:25,967
l'll haul your ass in, pal.

1470
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:30,471
Hey, Jim!

1471
01:48:38,563 --> 01:48:41,566
Five to one, baby

1472
01:48:41,607 --> 01:48:44,443
One in five

1473
01:48:44,527 --> 01:48:49,949
No one here gets out alive now

1474
01:48:50,032 --> 01:48:52,785
You get yours, baby

1475
01:48:52,868 --> 01:48:54,912
l'll get mine

1476
01:48:56,205 --> 01:49:00,084
Gonna make it, baby
if we try

1477
01:49:11,762 --> 01:49:14,265
The old get older

1478
01:49:14,348 --> 01:49:17,852
The young get stronger

1479
01:49:17,935 --> 01:49:23,357
May take a week
and it may take longer

1480
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:28,779
They got the guns
but we got the numbers

1481
01:49:29,530 --> 01:49:33,701
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over

1482
01:49:33,743 --> 01:49:36,370
Come on!

1483
01:49:36,412 --> 01:49:38,706
Let me hear ya!

1484
01:50:00,311 --> 01:50:02,813
Look at this beautiful
living thing, man.

1485
01:50:02,897 --> 01:50:05,358
You wouldn't eat
my little friend, would you?

1486
01:50:05,441 --> 01:50:07,360
Come on, man.

1487
01:50:07,443 --> 01:50:10,404
Love animals.
Don't eat them!

1488
01:50:10,446 --> 01:50:12,281
l'd fuck her, but she's too young.

1489
01:50:22,959 --> 01:50:25,294
Your ballroom days

1490
01:50:25,378 --> 01:50:29,215
Are over, baby

1491
01:50:29,298 --> 01:50:32,426
Night is drawing near

1492
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:38,599
Shadows of the evening

1493
01:50:40,226 --> 01:50:43,938
Crawl across the year

1494
01:50:44,021 --> 01:50:47,024
You walk across the floor

1495
01:50:47,108 --> 01:50:49,860
With a flower in your hand

1496
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:55,783
Trying to tell me
no one understands

1497
01:50:55,866 --> 01:50:58,119
Trade in your house

1498
01:50:58,202 --> 01:51:02,081
For a handful of dimes

1499
01:51:02,164 --> 01:51:04,375
Gonna make it, baby

1500
01:51:04,417 --> 01:51:07,879
ln our prime

1501
01:51:07,962 --> 01:51:10,047
Get together

1502
01:51:10,131 --> 01:51:11,883
One more time

1503
01:51:13,718 --> 01:51:15,761
Get together

1504
01:51:15,845 --> 01:51:17,597
One more time

1505
01:52:14,904 --> 01:52:18,616
You're all a bunch
of fucking slaves!

1506
01:52:21,786 --> 01:52:24,705
How long you think
it's going to last?

1507
01:52:24,789 --> 01:52:27,917
How long are you gonna let 'em
push you around?

1508
01:52:28,042 --> 01:52:30,002
l'll tell you this.

1509
01:52:30,044 --> 01:52:34,048
l'm gonna get my kicks before
the whole shithouse goes up in flames.

1510
01:52:34,173 --> 01:52:36,092
All right.

1511
01:52:38,803 --> 01:52:41,389
"Light My Fire!" Come on, Jim!

1512
01:52:43,891 --> 01:52:45,059
Fuck you, man!

1513
01:52:45,142 --> 01:52:48,563
That's the word.
That's the very little word.

1514
01:52:48,646 --> 01:52:53,317
Come on, let me hear it.
All your little hatred.

1515
01:52:53,442 --> 01:52:56,404
You'd all eat shit, wouldn't ya?

1516
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:04,412
Adolf Hitler is alive and well
and living in Miami.

1517
01:53:05,746 --> 01:53:08,249
l fucked her last night.

1518
01:53:10,751 --> 01:53:12,336
What are you gonna do about it?

1519
01:53:28,477 --> 01:53:32,648
Come on, come on, come on
Come on and suck me, babe

1520
01:53:32,732 --> 01:53:37,695
Can't you see
that l need some head

1521
01:53:37,737 --> 01:53:41,532
What was that--
Wait a minute. Ah, bullshit!

1522
01:53:41,616 --> 01:53:45,328
lt's fucked up, man.
lt's all bullshit!

1523
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:48,122
lt's all fucked up.
l'm coming out!

1524
01:53:49,373 --> 01:53:51,500
Miami Beach, Florida, huh?

1525
01:53:54,712 --> 01:53:58,132
Hey, l went to Florida State.

1526
01:53:58,216 --> 01:54:01,886
Then l got smart
and moved to California.

1527
01:54:01,928 --> 01:54:06,724
They're trying to change the world
out there in California.

1528
01:54:06,766 --> 01:54:09,977
No, l ain't talkin' about
no revolution.

1529
01:54:10,061 --> 01:54:13,981
l'm talkin' about having
a good time this summer.

1530
01:54:15,233 --> 01:54:19,153
l'm talking about love your neighbor
until it hurts.

1531
01:54:20,446 --> 01:54:23,241
Come on.
How 'bout a little nakedness?

1532
01:54:25,534 --> 01:54:28,663
Come on. Let's see

1533
01:54:28,746 --> 01:54:32,792

1534
01:54:34,502 --> 01:54:38,965
l'm talkin' about
you and me lovin'--

1535
01:54:50,518 --> 01:54:53,479
Anybody gonna come up here
and love my ass?

1536
01:54:53,521 --> 01:54:56,274
Come on. l'm lonely up here.

1537
01:54:56,315 --> 01:54:58,150
l love you!

1538
01:54:58,234 --> 01:55:00,194
Come on, sweetheart.
You want to see it?

1539
01:55:00,278 --> 01:55:04,282
Why don't l pull it out for you,
shake it around a little bit?

1540
01:55:05,449 --> 01:55:07,702
Will that do it for ya?

1541
01:55:09,328 --> 01:55:12,039
All right, now.
l'm gonna show it to you.

1542
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:20,923
You see it?

1543
01:55:23,467 --> 01:55:26,387
Yeah, l saw it!

1544
01:55:26,429 --> 01:55:28,514
l wanna see some action out there!

1545
01:55:34,562 --> 01:55:36,772
No limits! No laws!

1546
01:55:36,856 --> 01:55:39,275
You want to fuck?

1547
01:55:39,358 --> 01:55:42,695
- This is your show! Yeah!

1548
01:55:42,737 --> 01:55:45,489
No laws! No limits!

1549
01:55:46,908 --> 01:55:49,785
Yeah! Fuckin' rock god!

1550
01:55:59,170 --> 01:56:02,256
Where's the guy with the penis?
Where's that son of a bitch? Get back!

1551
01:56:04,884 --> 01:56:07,220
Fat cat in a top hat

1552
01:56:14,936 --> 01:56:16,896
Dead cat in a top hat

1553
01:56:20,816 --> 01:56:23,903
Suckin' on a young man's

1554
01:56:23,986 --> 01:56:25,404
Love

1555
01:56:27,865 --> 01:56:30,660
Wishin' he could come, yeah

1556
01:56:33,120 --> 01:56:35,873
Suckin' on a soldier's brain

1557
01:56:38,292 --> 01:56:41,170
Wishin' it would be the same

1558
01:56:47,552 --> 01:56:50,972
Dead rats
See, you're an aristocrat

1559
01:56:53,266 --> 01:56:55,726
Well, that's crap

1560
01:56:55,851 --> 01:56:58,813
You know, the day
destroy the night

1561
01:56:58,896 --> 01:57:01,482
Night divide the day

1562
01:57:01,566 --> 01:57:04,318
Try to run, try to hide

1563
01:57:04,402 --> 01:57:06,779
Break on through
to the other side

1564
01:57:14,912 --> 01:57:16,831
Come on!

1565
01:57:17,999 --> 01:57:20,418
Chased our pleasures here

1566
01:57:20,459 --> 01:57:22,628
Dug our treasures there

1567
01:57:22,753 --> 01:57:26,173
Can you still recall
the time we cried

1568
01:57:26,257 --> 01:57:28,259
Break on through to--

1569
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:50,656
Mr. Morrison.

1570
01:57:50,740 --> 01:57:54,035
You are charged with lewd behavior
on four counts.

1571
01:57:54,118 --> 01:57:58,205
Simulated masturbation...

1572
01:57:58,289 --> 01:58:00,207
public drunkenness...

1573
01:58:01,334 --> 01:58:02,752
profanity...

1574
01:58:03,878 --> 01:58:05,796
and public exposure.

1575
01:58:07,006 --> 01:58:08,758
How do you plead?

1576
01:58:08,841 --> 01:58:10,760
The defendant pleads not guilty,
Your Honor.

1577
01:58:10,843 --> 01:58:12,470
Then trial is set for the week--

1578
01:58:12,553 --> 01:58:16,557
l want to bring to the jury's attention
that there's playing now on Broadway...

1579
01:58:16,599 --> 01:58:19,185
a musical called "Hair"
where the actors disrobe...

1580
01:58:19,227 --> 01:58:21,354
and appear naked on the stage.

1581
01:58:21,395 --> 01:58:24,690
- Objection. That's irrelevant.
- Sustained.

1582
01:58:24,732 --> 01:58:26,734
Your Honor,
how can you sustain that?

1583
01:58:26,817 --> 01:58:28,736
Stick to the facts.

1584
01:58:28,819 --> 01:58:31,072
This is a major
First Amendment violation...

1585
01:58:31,155 --> 01:58:33,741
by the politicians
and the police of Miami.

1586
01:58:33,783 --> 01:58:36,077
Every single witness
they've brought here...

1587
01:58:36,160 --> 01:58:39,789
has testified to not actually seeing
my client's genitals...

1588
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:43,376
except one, who is related
to the arresting officer.

1589
01:58:43,417 --> 01:58:46,754
l tell you, if you convict
on such lack of evidence...

1590
01:58:46,837 --> 01:58:51,092
l assure you that someday, somewhere
in the still of the night...

1591
01:58:51,133 --> 01:58:53,803
you will wake up screaming.

1592
01:58:59,350 --> 01:59:01,811
Are you gonna get rid of it?

1593
01:59:06,607 --> 01:59:08,818
Look.

1594
01:59:08,859 --> 01:59:13,739
Wouldn't it be better to have a kid with
someone who wanted to be its father?

1595
01:59:13,823 --> 01:59:16,784
lt'd be a fucking genius.
That's what it'd be.

1596
01:59:18,703 --> 01:59:20,997
You and me?

1597
01:59:21,038 --> 01:59:23,624
The child would be a goddess...

1598
01:59:23,666 --> 01:59:26,210
or a god.

1599
01:59:26,294 --> 01:59:28,212
lt'd be a monster.

1600
01:59:31,382 --> 01:59:33,718
No. Look.

1601
01:59:33,759 --> 01:59:36,512
l got this trial
that's hanging on me.

1602
01:59:36,554 --> 01:59:40,683
l can't afford this.
l don't want the responsibility.

1603
01:59:40,725 --> 01:59:44,478
You're a coward,
just a little boy!

1604
01:59:44,562 --> 01:59:47,398
The only way you can't afford it
is emotionally!

1605
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:51,110
Those vows were forever
in the goddess' sight!

1606
01:59:51,193 --> 01:59:54,488
"Death does not part,
only lack of love."

1607
01:59:54,572 --> 01:59:56,657
Come on, Patricia.

1608
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:58,868
l was stoned.

1609
02:00:00,536 --> 02:00:03,372
lt seemed like a fun thing
to do at the time.

1610
02:00:06,584 --> 02:00:10,254
Fuck you.
l'm gonna have the kid.

1611
02:00:10,338 --> 02:00:13,382
Well, then it will be your kid.

1612
02:00:13,424 --> 02:00:16,469
But if you want the abortion,
l'll be there with you.

1613
02:00:16,552 --> 02:00:18,387
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Yes, l will.

1614
02:00:18,471 --> 02:00:21,390
Bullshit, Morrison!
You know who you are!

1615
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:27,104
What difference
does it make, you know?

1616
02:00:27,146 --> 02:00:29,232
You never pretended.

1617
02:00:30,399 --> 02:00:32,401
l did.

1618
02:00:32,485 --> 02:00:35,404
Yeah, l don't even like kids,
particularly.

1619
02:00:36,614 --> 02:00:39,659
l don't want the other
fuckin' thing either.

1620
02:00:44,038 --> 02:00:45,248
Well.

1621
02:00:47,583 --> 02:00:51,003
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

1622
02:00:51,045 --> 02:00:54,340
- Look at that stomach.
- Come on, now.

1623
02:00:54,423 --> 02:00:56,634
Don't say these things.

1624
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:19,240
James Douglas Morrison...

1625
02:01:19,323 --> 02:01:21,576
l hereby sentence you...

1626
02:01:21,659 --> 02:01:24,787
to six months of hard labor
in the Dade County jail.

1627
02:01:24,912 --> 02:01:26,581
And for public exposure...

1628
02:01:26,706 --> 02:01:30,126
l'm sentencing you
to 60 days of the same...

1629
02:01:30,209 --> 02:01:33,671
after which you are to serve
two years and four months...

1630
02:01:33,754 --> 02:01:35,840
of probationary time.

1631
02:01:35,923 --> 02:01:39,260
Your Honor, l have an appellate bond
in the sum of $50,000 here.

1632
02:01:39,302 --> 02:01:42,305
l ask that Mr. Morrison remain free,
pending his appeal.

1633
02:01:49,562 --> 02:01:53,482
Everywhere, Jim-- Jacksonville, Dallas,
even Kent State University canceled.

1634
02:01:53,608 --> 02:01:56,110
The press for the first time
turned against us. We're fucked.

1635
02:01:56,193 --> 02:02:00,323
Pamela's called six times.
Katherine, Patricia. Gayle's pregnant.

1636
02:02:00,406 --> 02:02:02,491
You gotta go to the dentist.
Look, Jim.

1637
02:02:02,575 --> 02:02:04,368
Go home, get some sleep.

1638
02:02:04,493 --> 02:02:07,705
- Wash your hair.
- Take a bath too, man.

1639
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:11,000
- Jesus, this guy really despises you.
- We weren't even invited to Woodstock.

1640
02:02:11,083 --> 02:02:12,668
Twenty other bands. Not us.

1641
02:02:12,752 --> 02:02:14,503
First Hendrix, now Janis.

1642
02:02:14,629 --> 02:02:17,173
Radio stations won't play us.
Some big cities.

1643
02:02:17,298 --> 02:02:19,675
Philly, Cinci, Chicago, Detroit.

1644
02:02:19,717 --> 02:02:21,761
We can drag this appeal out for years,
keep you out of jail.

1645
02:02:21,844 --> 02:02:24,847
The F.B.l.'s behind it.
They had memos on you in Phoenix.

1646
02:02:24,889 --> 02:02:26,849
They extradited you to Miami.

1647
02:02:26,933 --> 02:02:28,100
A new image.

1648
02:02:28,184 --> 02:02:31,354
Slow, quiet. The beard.
The elder of the tribe.

1649
02:02:35,066 --> 02:02:39,028
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord!

1650
02:02:40,279 --> 02:02:41,572
The band you love to hate.

1651
02:02:41,614 --> 02:02:43,074
Let's win there.

1652
02:02:44,075 --> 02:02:45,117
lt was fun.

1653
02:02:53,334 --> 02:02:56,420
l think l'm having
a nervous breakdown.

1654
02:03:00,049 --> 02:03:03,010
- Do you hear me?
- Climb on the edge, baby.

1655
02:03:03,094 --> 02:03:05,096
We're rolling, Jim.

1656
02:03:05,137 --> 02:03:07,223
- Jump!
- Let him dance a little bit.

1657
02:03:07,265 --> 02:03:10,935
l want you to come back in here
this minute, Jim Morrison.

1658
02:03:10,977 --> 02:03:13,229
l am not gonna kill myself for you.

1659
02:03:13,312 --> 02:03:16,649
- Goddamn it, Jim!
- Your whole life is bullshit!

1660
02:03:16,691 --> 02:03:19,485
- Shut up!
- You want me, come out and get me!

1661
02:03:19,569 --> 02:03:21,112
Oh, no!

1662
02:03:21,153 --> 02:03:23,823
Jim, where are you--
Pam, get back inside!

1663
02:03:23,906 --> 02:03:27,451
- l love you.
- Come out here, honey.

1664
02:03:28,661 --> 02:03:31,330
- Come on, baby.
- Jim, give her your hand.

1665
02:03:31,372 --> 02:03:34,500
- She's gonna fall.
- Once more with feeling.

1666
02:03:34,584 --> 02:03:35,918
Take two.

1667
02:03:36,002 --> 02:03:39,338
- l don't want to die.
- Man, we gotta finish it.

1668
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:42,842
- We don't have an ending, Ray.
- All the poetry has wolves in it.

1669
02:03:42,884 --> 02:03:45,511
- The most beautiful--
- Come on, girl.

1670
02:03:45,553 --> 02:03:48,973
l see your hair is burning

1671
02:03:49,015 --> 02:03:51,684
The most beautiful one of all...

1672
02:03:51,767 --> 02:03:54,854
dances in a ring of fire...

1673
02:03:54,937 --> 02:03:58,524
then throws off a challenge
with a shrug.

1674
02:03:58,566 --> 02:04:00,401
That's my girl.

1675
02:04:02,153 --> 02:04:05,197
Let's go. Let's leave this place.

1676
02:04:05,239 --> 02:04:07,283
Just you and me, baby.

1677
02:04:07,366 --> 02:04:09,577
We can, you know.

1678
02:04:10,786 --> 02:04:12,204
Just one more step.

1679
02:04:15,833 --> 02:04:17,210
l want to live!

1680
02:04:17,251 --> 02:04:19,712
l want to live with you!

1681
02:04:22,632 --> 02:04:25,843
All the poetry
has wolves in it, Pam.

1682
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:28,638
All but one.

1683
02:04:30,306 --> 02:04:33,226
The most beautiful one of all.

1684
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:37,396
l hope you go out smiling...

1685
02:04:37,438 --> 02:04:41,317
like a child
into the cool remnant of a dream.

1686
02:04:43,986 --> 02:04:46,822
The angel man...

1687
02:04:46,906 --> 02:04:50,660
has finally claimed
this benevolent soul.

1688
02:04:51,744 --> 02:04:54,038
Ophelia...

1689
02:04:54,121 --> 02:04:57,667
leaves sudden in silk.

1690
02:04:57,708 --> 02:04:59,710
Glory in dream.

1691
02:05:01,003 --> 02:05:03,506
Mad, stifled witness.

1692
02:05:24,193 --> 02:05:25,903
All right!

1693
02:05:27,238 --> 02:05:29,407
Hi, Dorothy.
Oh, you cut your hair.

1694
02:05:29,490 --> 02:05:32,910
- We're trying to have another baby.
- Was your hair getting in the way?

1695
02:05:34,287 --> 02:05:36,497
Where's Ray?
l got to catch a plane.

1696
02:05:36,581 --> 02:05:38,416
He's upstairs.

1697
02:05:38,499 --> 02:05:41,294
- Where's Princess?
- Out back.

1698
02:05:45,590 --> 02:05:48,426
We added a rain effect
to "Riders," man.

1699
02:05:48,467 --> 02:05:50,428
lt's great.

1700
02:05:52,138 --> 02:05:55,099
lt's the best album
since "Days," man.

1701
02:05:56,434 --> 02:05:58,936
l must admit it's pretty good...

1702
02:05:59,061 --> 02:06:02,273
for four guys who weren't even
talking to each other that day.

1703
02:06:03,608 --> 02:06:06,444
So you're really gonna live
in Paris, huh, man?

1704
02:06:06,527 --> 02:06:09,488
Yeah. You know, be anonymous,
write a book.

1705
02:06:11,574 --> 02:06:15,328
"Observations of an American
While On Trial in Miami."

1706
02:06:15,411 --> 02:06:17,371
Still got a lot
of good songs in you.

1707
02:06:17,455 --> 02:06:19,999
Still think we got a couple
of blues albums in us.

1708
02:06:20,124 --> 02:06:21,500
l'm pinned, man.

1709
02:06:21,584 --> 02:06:24,670
They got a category
for everything we do.

1710
02:06:26,047 --> 02:06:28,007
l'm a wanted man.

1711
02:06:31,510 --> 02:06:34,055
l'm gonna miss you, man.

1712
02:06:34,180 --> 02:06:38,100
l'm gonna miss that feeling
of playing music with you, man.

1713
02:06:38,184 --> 02:06:40,519
You, John, miss me?

1714
02:06:40,603 --> 02:06:43,314
More than you think, asshole.

1715
02:06:43,397 --> 02:06:45,191
Yeah.

1716
02:06:45,316 --> 02:06:47,944
You can always whip
the horses' eyes.

1717
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:53,783
As far as l'm concerned...

1718
02:06:53,866 --> 02:06:56,452
l made music with Dionysus.

1719
02:06:57,912 --> 02:07:01,290
We had moments onstage
that no one will ever fucking know.

1720
02:07:03,084 --> 02:07:05,461
You lay off those drugs, Robby.

1721
02:07:06,921 --> 02:07:08,881
Hey, Merry Christmas.

1722
02:07:17,265 --> 02:07:19,934
We'll get together again,
you know...

1723
02:07:20,017 --> 02:07:22,186
in some strange way.

1724
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:25,481
Maybe we'll make a movie together.
Black and white.

1725
02:07:34,657 --> 02:07:37,493
Sabrina, this is for you.

1726
02:07:41,998 --> 02:07:45,668
- Morrison, see you around.
- What, no bon voyage?

1727
02:07:45,751 --> 02:07:47,837
l'll see you back.

1728
02:07:49,422 --> 02:07:52,133
And little Princess Smiling Face...

1729
02:07:52,174 --> 02:07:55,386
this one's for you...

1730
02:07:55,469 --> 02:07:57,847
from Chief Mojo Rising.

1731
02:08:00,516 --> 02:08:01,851
Happy birthday, Princess.

1732
02:08:01,934 --> 02:08:05,354
- Let me see.
- lt's you.

1733
02:08:05,438 --> 02:08:07,398
Forever young.

1734
02:08:08,983 --> 02:08:12,695
The strangest life
l've ever known.

1735
02:08:58,741 --> 02:09:01,160
Jim. You got a plane to catch, man?

1736
02:09:05,748 --> 02:09:08,125
Yeah.

1737
02:09:08,167 --> 02:09:11,003
We're reaching for death
on the end of a candle.

1738
02:09:11,087 --> 02:09:14,382
We're trying for something
that's already found us.

1739
02:09:14,465 --> 02:09:16,384
Last words.

1740
02:09:16,467 --> 02:09:18,844
Out.

1741
02:09:26,185 --> 02:09:27,812
Did you get all that?

1742
02:09:29,355 --> 02:09:30,481
Yeah.

1743
02:09:30,523 --> 02:09:32,483
l got it, Jim.

1744
02:09:42,034 --> 02:09:44,829
Come on. Let's get some tacos.

1745
02:10:03,222 --> 02:10:04,640
Death.

1746
02:10:06,684 --> 02:10:08,853
lt's not so bad.

1747
02:10:08,936 --> 02:10:11,105
- Jim?
- l love my girl.

1748
02:10:11,188 --> 02:10:13,524
Jim, is that you?

1749
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:59,570
l knew it was you, Jim Morrison.
l always know when it's you.

1750
02:11:10,957 --> 02:11:13,251
Come on, baby.
Get out of the tub.

1751
02:11:13,376 --> 02:11:16,003
Come on. Mama will dry you off.

1752
02:11:16,087 --> 02:11:19,549
Just stop joking around, you hear me?
Just cut it out.

1753
02:11:50,746 --> 02:11:53,124
Was it all right, Jim?

1754
02:11:55,877 --> 02:11:58,629
Did you enjoy it when it came...

1755
02:12:00,631 --> 02:12:03,134
just like you said you would?

1756
02:12:30,870 --> 02:12:33,205
They are waiting to take us...

1757
02:12:33,289 --> 02:12:35,541
into the severed garden.

1758
02:12:35,625 --> 02:12:38,628
You know how pale and wanton
thrillful comes death...

1759
02:12:38,711 --> 02:12:40,713
in the strange hour...

1760
02:12:40,796 --> 02:12:43,591
unannounced, unplanned for...

1761
02:12:43,674 --> 02:12:48,262
like a scary, over-friendly guest
you've brought to bed.

1762
02:12:48,346 --> 02:12:51,599
Death makes angels of us all
and give us wings...

1763
02:12:51,682 --> 02:12:55,353
where we had shoulders
smooth as ravens' claws.

1764
02:13:00,233 --> 02:13:02,610
No more money, no more fancy dress.

1765
02:13:02,693 --> 02:13:05,488
This other kingdom seems
by far the best...

1766
02:13:05,571 --> 02:13:08,741
until its other jaw
reveals incest...

1767
02:13:08,783 --> 02:13:11,911
and loose obedience
to a vegetable law.

1768
02:13:11,953 --> 02:13:15,456
l will not go.

1769
02:13:15,498 --> 02:13:18,876
l prefer a feast of friends
to the giant family.
