[door opens]

3
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,508
[woman] Mom!

4
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:31,509
[door closes]

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,120
How was your shift?

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,818
Ugh. Long.

7
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:38,995
[sighs] Boring.

8
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:40,388
I'm tired.

9
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,650
I got you guys hamburgers.

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,000
[gasps]
With sweet potato fries?

11
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,003
Heh. Yes, a double order, of course.

12
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,700
Bless you.

13
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:50,833
Showed three houses
on the west side today.

14
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:52,574
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

15
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:53,923
Well, just start without me.

16
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,664
I'm gonna have
a quick shower, okay?

17
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:58,319
Before you race off, you might
want to check the table.

18
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,284
Aren't you going to open it?

19
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:08,677
I can't. Can you?

20
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,157
Go on.

21
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,897
What if I didn't get
a high enough score

22
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:13,638
to get into any law school?

23
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:15,597
Then you'll try again.

24
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:18,991
It took your father three tries
before he passed his LSATs.

25
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:25,520
160. [laughs]

26
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,000
It just doesn't feel right

27
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:29,393
celebrating without Dad.

28
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,222
I know.
Once the Manzotti case is over,

29
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:34,920
maybe we could convince him
to take some time off.

30
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:36,748
The three of us
could take a little vacation

31
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,490
- before you head off to law school.

[gasps]

34
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,625
Maybe he had
a break in the case.

35
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:44,800
Okay, you wait here.

36
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,551
Nick?

37
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,816
Laura, there's been an accident.

38
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,211
What happened?

39
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,603
Is he okay?

40
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:07,301
Let's step inside.

41
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:08,911
[softly] No.

42
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,242
Damn it.

43
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,942

[door opens]

45
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,209
I forgot my... I left my...

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,993
I couldn't find my house...
the key.

47
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,778
I think I left it at the bar.

48
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:51,258
How much have you had to drink?

49
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:52,607
Mmm...

50
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,478
I don't know.

51
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,263
Where is your car?

52
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:57,960
Did Ethan drive you home?

53
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,092
- You know how I feel about him.
- Yes, Mom, I know.

54
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,920
The whole town knows
how you feel about Ethan.

55
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,096
No, I walked home from the bar,

56
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:06,490
because I'm a responsible adult.

57
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,492
Natalie, you have to
get yourself together.

58
00:03:08,623 --> 00:03:10,451
It's been almost a year,
and you're still...

59
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,496
Still what?
I am getting myself together.

60
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,238
Me hanging out with my friends
is getting myself together.

61
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,979
Okay?
It's better than, what,

62
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:18,763
going to sleep with dad's
case files every night?

63
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,244
What are you
even hoping to find?

64
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,941
I'm trying to help you.

65
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,856
I don't need your help, okay?

66
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,989
You're the one who can't even
close the deal on a house.

67
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,034
You're all like, "Hey, do
you wanna buy a house?

68
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,167
It comes with a conspiracy theory.
Do you care?"

69
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,823
I mean, that's weird, Mom.
You're the one who needs help!

70
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,216
[woman] Laura.

71
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,782
Hey, is everything okay?

72
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,088
[scoffs]

73
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,438
Yes.
Thank you, Betty.

74
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:43,745
[Natalie]
She's so annoying.

75
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,747
She needs to mind
her own business.

76
00:03:45,877 --> 00:03:47,096
Natalie, if you're
gonna stay here,

77
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,402
you cannot act like this.

78
00:03:48,532 --> 00:03:49,881
It's embarrassing
for both of us.

79
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,274
Oh, it's embarrassing?
You know what, then?

80
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:53,233
In the morning, I won't be here.

81
00:03:53,363 --> 00:03:55,757
I'll be gone, and you can just
live here alone in the past.

82
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,541
It's your dream situation.

83
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,587
- That's not what I meant.
- [scoffs]

84
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,243
This isn't over, Natalie.

85
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:05,767
Oh. Found them,

86
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:08,596
so it is.

87
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:12,208
Goodbye, Mom!

88
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:13,644
[slams door]

00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,327
Mom?

91
00:05:31,243 --> 00:05:32,941
Mom?

92
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:38,250
Mom?!

93
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,125
Mom?!

94
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:49,566
Mom?!

[camera clicks]

96
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,921
Appears to be a break-in, Chief.

97
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:58,662
Window over there is smashed.

98
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,448
Best we can figure is it
was a burglary gone wrong.

99
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:02,710
Vic came into the kitchen,

100
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,841
scared 'em in the act.

101
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:04,929
They panicked.

102
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,628
Oh, Laura, I'm so sorry.

103
00:06:09,847 --> 00:06:10,892
There's no jewelry.

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,157
Looks like they yanked it
right off of her neck.

105
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,816
[sighs]

106
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,123
She has a daughter, Natalie.

107
00:06:26,342 --> 00:06:28,039
I'm a friend of the family,

108
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,825
so I should probably call
her and break the bad news.

109
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:33,305
Uh, sir, Monroe's got
her out back right now.

110
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,959
She was upstairs
when it happened.

111
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,787
She's the one that called it in.

112
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,009
I want a report
on my desk A.S.A.P.

113
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,621
Make sure you get a picture
of the neck and the wrist.

114
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:45,666
Yes, sir.

115
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:54,022
[Monroe] And what time
did you go to bed last night?

116
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:57,678
[Natalie] Um, I don't remember,
'cause I wasn't feeling very well.

117
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,941
And as far as you know,
did your mother

118
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,508
have any, uh, plans
for last night?

119
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,466
Was she going to have
anybody else over?

120
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:08,428
No, sh-she didn't talk to
anybody like that since...

121
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,475
My God, Nick.
Thank God you're here.

122
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,608
You have to find out
who did this.

123
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,218
I mean, who would
do this to her?

124
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:17,480
I know, Natalie.
I know.

125
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,439
- Monroe.
- Chief.

126
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,092
I just have a few more
questions for her, and then...

127
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:22,833
You know, I would
appreciate it if you'd

128
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,313
go and ask the neighbors
some questions.

129
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,402
See if they have
anything to add.

130
00:07:34,366 --> 00:07:36,238
Nat...

131
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:43,463
I can't even begin to imagine
what you're going through,

132
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:45,813
but if you're up for it,

133
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,597
you know, any little detail

134
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,165
may very well help us
catch who killed her.

135
00:07:56,084 --> 00:07:57,172
Your car isn't here.

136
00:07:57,302 --> 00:07:58,739
Is it possible that whoever...

137
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,045
I walked home. I...

138
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:02,917
I'd had a bit to drink.

139
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,354
My mom let me in,

140
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,748
and then we talked for a bit,

141
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,228
- and then I went to bed.
- And after that?

142
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:12,666
Did you hear anything?

143
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,190
Any noises? Any voices?

144
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,324
I-I guess I'd had
a little bit more

145
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,849
than a little bit to drink.

146
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,461
You have somebody to call?

147
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,247
Someplace safe
that you can go tonight?

148
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:33,817
I could call Ethan, but, uh...

149
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,515
Don't worry.

150
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,429
I know the folks
that own the Sleep 'n Stay.

151
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,779
They'll put you up.

152
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,738
Natalie, I'm not going to rest

153
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:45,394
until I know who did this.

154
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,135
I promise.

155
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,492
[cell phone chirps]

[cell phone buzzes]

158
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:14,205
Oh, okay. So I wasn't sure
exactly what to get, so...

159
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,381
kinda got everything.

160
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:18,906
Um, toothbrush and shampoo.

161
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,560
You need towels,

162
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,562
because I don't trust
the ones in that bathroom.

163
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,086
Oh, and I know you said
you weren't hungry,

164
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:26,957
- [cell phone buzzing]
- but I always say that,

165
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,438
and then I end up
wishing I had food.

166
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:35,792
You, uh, gonna answer that?

167
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:38,578
No, because it's Ethan, and I
don't want to talk to him.

168
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,362
Ugh. Hallelujah.

169
00:09:40,492 --> 00:09:43,278
I was worried your moment
of clarity last night

170
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:45,280
would have faded away, but...

171
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,630
well, I never liked him.

172
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:49,414
Yeah, you made that very clear,

173
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,678
you and my mom both.

174
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,215
Shelby, what am I gonna do?

175
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,740
I don't have anyone left.

176
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:11,959
Hey...

177
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,832
come on.
That's not true.

178
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:18,443
When my dad died,
I was devastated,

179
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,707
and I kept thinking,
"This is so unfair,"

180
00:10:20,837 --> 00:10:24,667
but accidents happen, and...

181
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,321
now with both of them gone,

182
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,062
I feel like it's like
some cosmic punishment,

183
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:30,020
and I don't know what
I did to deserve it.

184
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:31,326
Nothing.

185
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,155
Hey, you did nothing.

186
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,810
I just need to leave town, I
think, after the funeral.

187
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,072
I can't... I can't be here.

188
00:10:38,202 --> 00:10:39,508
I can't live in that house.

189
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,988
You can't just run away

190
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,467
from what
you're feeling, Natalie.

191
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:44,469
I know you know that.

192
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,602
But my mom, even after the
accident, she wanted me to go.

193
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,343
She was like, "Even if
you aren't in school,

194
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:50,606
I think it would be good for
you to clear your head."

195
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,564
- But that... that wasn't...
- I know. She was mad

196
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,044
that you convinced me to stay.

197
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:55,567
No, she was wrong.

198
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,837
If you'd gone,

199
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,448
you might have missed your
last months together with her.

200
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:09,843
Or maybe not.

201
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:12,584
But you can't know that.

202
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,463
I'm all alone.

203
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:28,035
No, you're not.

204
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,605
But what you probably are
is... is hungry,

205
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,391
so come to the bar.
I've got a shift,

206
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:39,481
and I know that you could
use a tray of comfort fries.

207
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,486
No, not tonight.
I'm good.

208
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,104
If it tastes like
there's no rum in that one,

209
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,237
it's because there isn't.

210
00:11:56,367 --> 00:11:58,979
We don't want a repeat
of last week? Do we, Norris?

211
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:03,200
[gasps]

212
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,073
And speaking of
unwelcome repeats...

213
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,204
Where is she, Shelby?

214
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,466
Not here,

215
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,903
and neither should you be.

216
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,992
- Don't lie to me.
- Okay.

217
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:13,689
You're a creep,
and you should leave.

218
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,560
Her car is outside, Shelby.

219
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,258
You can't try and tell...

220
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:20,348
Because she walked home,
just like you should.

221
00:12:20,478 --> 00:12:22,611
Okay? You don't want to wreck
that pretty little car of yours.

222
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,613
- But my phone won't...
- Your phone?

223
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,397
Okay, you're right.
I was wrong.

224
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,922
You're not a creep.
You're a super creep,

225
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:33,013
and you don't work here, so
get out from behind the bar.

226
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,667
I-I just want to make
sure she's okay.

227
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:39,367
Of course she's not.
Her mother died.

228
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:42,152
I-I want her to know
that I'm here for her.

229
00:12:42,283 --> 00:12:43,675
Wonderful.

230
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,721
But not here, okay?

231
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,031
Natalie needs me,

232
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,902
and you know why?

233
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,557
Because I'm the only one who
treats her like an adult.

234
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,214
Yeah, real adult.

235
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,999
I'm about to get Rudy,

236
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,349
and I don't think
he's gonna be as nice to you

237
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,829
as he was last night.

238
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,614
I hope you and Rudy and everyone

239
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:13,488
understands
that she needs me, okay?

240
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:15,751
She needs me.

241
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:27,023
[laughs]

242
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,459
Well, that was fun.

243
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,635
Thanks for the help, guys.

244
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:32,942
All right, who wants a shot?

245
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:34,726
Bit of rum, please.

246
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:12,547
[soft piano music playing]

247
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,464
Natalie, so sorry for your loss.

248
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,338
Poor girl

249
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,079
Your mom was a great woman.

250
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,951
Mm-hmm.

251
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:39,661
Honey, I'm gonna go...

252
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:53,153
Chief, it's good to see you.

253
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,111
- Just paying my respects.
- I know.

254
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:57,026
I know what's up.

255
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,723
Okay. What's up?

256
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,074
You're looking for the killer.

257
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,293
I heard they always come
to their victim's funeral.

258
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,469
Yeah, I don't think that's true.

259
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,862
Well, don't worry.
I'll stand...

260
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,996
Think you could
do me a favor, Chief?

261
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,522
Who's the guy in the car?

262
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:17,829
Ethan, Natalie's ex.
Super creeper.

263
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,920
And look where he is.
Just saying.

264
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,010
I got him.

265
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:26,360
[chuckles]

266
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:32,496
Bye, Ethan.

267
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,371
[soft music playing]

268
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:49,774
E-Excuse me.

269
00:15:49,905 --> 00:15:51,124
Um, would it be cliché

270
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,821
to ask you if
you come here often?

271
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,214
It's not a line.
I'm just wondering

272
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:55,693
if you know what's good here.

273
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:58,609
The alcohol.

274
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,915
It's a bit early for me.

275
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,613
All right.
Suit yourself.

276
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,659
Hey.
Can I help you?

277
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,054
Uh, yeah. Um, can I
get a burger, medium rare,

278
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:11,927
and a refill for
whatever she's having?

279
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,147
Oh, it's okay.
You don't have to buy me a drink.

280
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:16,192
Oh, I know, but I heard
they're really good here.

281
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,455
Who told you that?

282
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,066
- [chuckles]
- Hey, Rudy,

283
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,850
uh, can you add a side
of sweet potato fries

284
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:22,938
- to his order?
- Sure.

285
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,637
They're worth the whole trip.

286
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,726
Uh, thanks.

287
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,251
Play your cards right, I might
even share 'em with you.

288
00:16:33,731 --> 00:16:35,646
So is this a-an
everyday look for you?

289
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,300
Not that you look bad.

290
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:38,954
I mean, you look really
beautiful. I just...

291
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:41,217
Was my mother's funeral today.

292
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:46,005
I-I'm sorry.

293
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:47,354
It's okay.
You didn't know.

294
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:50,574
Still, uh, I'm sorry, Natalie.

295
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:52,228
Do they, uh, serve
good apologies here?

296
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:53,664
I never told you my name.

297
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,058
You didn't? Oh.

298
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,060
Well, um, I think Rudy said it.

299
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,714
- No.
- It was Natalie, wasn't it?

300
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,629
No? Oh, then,
what is it?

301
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:09,245
[clears throat]
I-I know who you are,

302
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,900
but if you'll just listen to me.
My name is Brody,

303
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,425
Brody Long.
I'm a... I'm a writer, a crime writer.

304
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,340
I'd really like to talk about
everything that's been going on.

305
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:18,602
I knew your father.

306
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,780
Before he died,
I was writing a book

307
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:24,347
about the case
he was working on,

308
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:26,480
the Manzotti family ties
to organized crime.

309
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,699
I reached out to your mother...

310
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,614
Oh, but now they're dead, so you
need a new source to exploit?

311
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:32,225
No. I...
Look, I want to help,

312
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:33,965
if you'd just hear me out.

313
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:36,359
Look, I know you have
no reason to trust me,

314
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,100
but trust this.

315
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,103
You're in danger.

316
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,239
Stay away from me.

317
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,335
[sighs]

318
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,601
and I found her,
and she was on the ground,

319
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,255
and I saw her head,

320
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,257
and there was stuff
all over the floor,

321
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:06,259
and can you please hurry?
I don't know what to do.

322
00:18:06,389 --> 00:18:07,999
Oh, God.
Mom, I'm so sorry.

323
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,523
Right there.

324
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,526
Oh, God.
Mom, I'm so sorry.

325
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:14,702
She said it away from the phone.

326
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:17,226
I don't think she realized it would
be picked up by the recording.

327
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:21,796
Monroe, people react to
trauma in all kinds of ways.

328
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:24,015
You can't take "I'm sorry"

329
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,756
as an admission of guilt.

330
00:18:25,887 --> 00:18:27,628
There's more.
Some drawers were opened,

331
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,238
some were dumped
out on the ground,

332
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,197
and then there's this table
lying on its side,

333
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,156
but what's weird here
are the chairs.

334
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,854
If someone was looking for
something and panicked,

335
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,160
it would have been impulsive,

336
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,292
so the chairs
would have scattered

337
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:40,902
when the table was flipped,

338
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:42,469
but these look like
they've been pulled out,

339
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,644
- suggesting that...
- "Suggesting"?

340
00:18:45,036 --> 00:18:48,344
You're suggesting
that this is staged.

341
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,607
The only items that are missing

342
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,654
are a wedding ring and a
necklace, both on her person.

343
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,178
No other attempt
to loot the house.

344
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:57,527
Maybe that's when
he was interrupted.

345
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,833
Or she.

346
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:03,620
You heard what Natalie said.

347
00:19:03,751 --> 00:19:06,884
Hell, we knew Laura.

348
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,583
I mean, the woman was harmless.

349
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:10,932
If you can see a motive

350
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:13,195
beyond her big house
and her nice car,

351
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:14,979
then I'd appreciate
if you'd share it.

352
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,721
It just seems odd that
Natalie didn't hear anything.

353
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,941
If a table is thrown
across the room...

354
00:19:24,554 --> 00:19:26,774
it's kinda hard not to hear it.

355
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,911
She was drunk.

356
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,305
And that makes her
less of a suspect?

357
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:39,221
Look, I know you have a personal
relationship with this family,

358
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,745
but this is worth pursuing.

359
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,878
It may be nothing, but...

360
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:46,359
[sighs]
I have questions.

361
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,279
Okay.

362
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:57,631
[door shuts]

363
00:20:01,939 --> 00:20:03,898
[knock on door]

364
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:06,683
Nick.

365
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:07,989
Did you find him?

366
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,730
No, not yet.

367
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,688
I just wanted to check on you.

368
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,037
Tried calling.

369
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,474
Yeah, my phone's been off.

370
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,563
I'm not really in a chatty mood.

371
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:19,000
Well, yeah. Understand that.

372
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,090
Well, I'm sorry that I can't
be the bearer of good news,

373
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,397
but I can be
the bearer of lunch.

374
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,660
It's from Rudy's, so...

375
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:29,924
Thank you for this.

376
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,595
Nat, I know this is a lot.

377
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:52,642
I hope you know that we're
doing all that we can.

378
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:56,211
We're looking into
every possibility.

379
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,693
Actually that's the other
reason I stopped by.

380
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:03,087
Um, a few days, I'm gonna
need you to come in

381
00:21:03,218 --> 00:21:05,786
and answer a few more
questions, just a formality.

382
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:08,310
Okay, yeah, but I already
told you everything I know.

383
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,747
I know.
Like I said, formality.

384
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:14,403
Do you think this could have something
to do with my father's death?

385
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,492
I mean, do you think
they could be connected?

386
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:22,846
[sighs]

387
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,068
Look, Nat...

388
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,289
when your dad died,

389
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:33,509
all I could think was,
"No, no, not Andy,

390
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,165
not like this.
It's not an accident."

391
00:21:38,906 --> 00:21:40,734
But it was.

392
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:52,180
Yeah, my mom
never believed that.

393
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,530
She said the Manzottis
were the kind of people

394
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,359
that could shut somebody up
if they wanted to.

395
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,277
None of us believed that your
dad had started drinking again,

396
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:05,106
but the toxicology
report was pretty clear.

397
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,502
I'm not trying to upset you.

398
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,026
We need to get into the future,

399
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:14,637
and we don't do that by
dwelling in the past, do we?

400
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:18,162
So you do me a favor, and
you stay in the present.

401
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:20,077
Mm-hmm.

402
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:25,561
Okay. You call
if you need anything.

403
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,313
[water splashes]

404
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,822
Oh. I'm sorry.

405
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,835
[ice rattling]

406
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,899
Why are you ignoring me?

407
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:31,818
Ethan, how did you get in here?

408
00:24:31,948 --> 00:24:34,255
[sighs]
Door was cracked.

409
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,086
Oh, I-I brought you these.

410
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:42,002
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

411
00:24:42,132 --> 00:24:43,917
I know you were there.

412
00:24:44,047 --> 00:24:46,136
I mean, to see if you were okay,

413
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:49,488
but your control-freak friend
unleashed that cop on me.

414
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,577
I-I just wanted
to pay my respects

415
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:54,449
No, you didn't.
You hated my mom.

416
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,757
[chuckles] Doesn't mean
I can't feel bad.

417
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,281
I mean, it's not like
I wanted her dead.

418
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:12,075
I didn't kill her.

419
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:15,339
You can't really think
I killed her.

420
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,732
I believe you.

421
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,865
I don't want you
to just believe me.

422
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:21,084
- I want you to trust me.
- I do. I... Same thing.

423
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,130
No, Natalie, it isn't.

424
00:25:25,175 --> 00:25:26,437
Hey, don't shut me out.

425
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:28,570
[gasping]

426
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:33,575
I-I didn't mean to.

427
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:37,797
Ethan, do you want me
to trust you?

428
00:25:37,927 --> 00:25:40,930
I-I just need some space, okay?

429
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:50,113
Fine.

430
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:55,597
[door closes]

431
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,470
[Monroe] Stop me
if I start to go astray.

432
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,124
You went to Rudy's
at about 6:00 p.m.,

433
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:02,865
not for work,
but for a drink with friends,

434
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,911
and at 9:15,
you walked home,

435
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,956
where you were greeted on the
front porch by your mother,

436
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:08,567
and you two had a fight.

437
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:10,917
Well, I wouldn't say
it was a fight.

438
00:26:11,047 --> 00:26:14,094
We spoke with your neighbor,
Betty Ledbetter, and she stated

439
00:26:14,224 --> 00:26:16,662
that you were yelling so loudly she
could hear you from across the street.

440
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,447
You had an argument, right?

441
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,799
Did you have
these arguments regularly?

442
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,063
What does this have
to do with the break-in?

443
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,936
- It doesn't.
- You were the last person to see her alive.

444
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,678
The details of that interaction
are extremely pertinent.

445
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:33,940
Hey.

446
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:42,209
Did you recently come back
from a trip, a vacation?

447
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,863
- Were you planning one?
- No.

448
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,865
You had a suitcase
out in your room

449
00:26:45,995 --> 00:26:47,910
that was hurriedly packed
from the looks of it.

450
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:50,173
If you didn't have any plans,
what were you packing for?

451
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,965
I don't think I want to answer
any more questions right now.

452
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:08,191
Um, Detective, why don't you get
Natalie a little more water.

453
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:09,715
Please?

454
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,515
This is uncomfortable,
I know, Natalie.

455
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,865
Does she think that I was
involved or something?

456
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,650
We have to be thorough

457
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,435
so we make sure that we
don't overlook anything.

458
00:27:34,565 --> 00:27:36,350
That would have
been nice a year ago.

459
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,875
Fair.

460
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,921
So let's say your mom was right.

461
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:45,881
Let's assume
that we missed something

462
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,448
in the investigation
of your father's death.

463
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,624
We don't really want that
to happen again, do we?

464
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,453
Then I need you to trust me.

465
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,324
Yeah, everybody
wants me to trust them,

466
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:55,761
but nobody trusts me.

467
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,504
Have you talked to Ethan?

468
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:01,680
Your ex?

469
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,551
You should.

470
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,467
He was really drunk that
night, and he was angry,

471
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:09,905
and he did not like my mom at
all, and he was at the funeral,

472
00:28:10,036 --> 00:28:11,559
which Shelby says
is like a very common...

473
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,824
Yes. I know
what Shelby says.

474
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:18,261
[Shelby] And I told her,
"You know, Crystal,

475
00:28:18,392 --> 00:28:21,090
real producers
don't use Tinder,"

476
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:22,788
at least not in the casting.

477
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,183
But guess what.
Now she's in some huge monster movie,

478
00:28:27,314 --> 00:28:29,577
so what do I know?

479
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:30,709
Hey.
See you later, Rudy.

480
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,232
See you, Shelby.

481
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,278
It's Shelby, right?

482
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:36,540
Uh, it is,

483
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,281
but I'm off duty.

484
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,501
If you are, too, uh,
drinks are over there,

485
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,808
and Rudy will take care of you.

486
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,897
If not, Natalie's not here,

487
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:46,028
and also she's grieving,

488
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,682
so how 'bout give it a break?

489
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:49,162
I'm looking for Ethan James.

490
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:51,251
I was told
I could find him here.

491
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:52,948
Not anymore, you can't.

492
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,950
Rudy finally kicked him
out a few nights ago

493
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,735
and the night before that.

494
00:28:56,865 --> 00:28:59,520
Drunk and belligerent
both times.

495
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,565
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

496
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:03,872
Yeah. Right over there.

497
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:06,919
He's been brooding on the nearest
strip of public property

498
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,225
just itching to catch
Natalie out and about.

499
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:12,838
He's the one who's about
yay high and yay douchey.

500
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:13,926
Got it.

501
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,669
[Monroe] Ethan James...

502
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,824
Ugh. This is the worst idea.

503
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,608
Yeah, I know it seems weird,

504
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,567
but I read that the
healthiest thing to do

505
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:49,352
is separate yourself
from material residue.

506
00:29:50,571 --> 00:29:52,138
What does that even mean?

507
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:54,053
I'm not sure.

508
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:55,924
Look, there is a lot of
stuff in this house,

509
00:29:56,055 --> 00:29:57,578
and with it sitting here empty,

510
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,407
what if the robber comes back?

511
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:02,191
So you agree that it's a robber?

512
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,714
'Cause the police
don't seem sure.

513
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,674
I mean, yeah.
Who else would it be?

514
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,241
Who do they think it is?

515
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,808
They don't know.

516
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,766
Well, that's the problem
with the police.

517
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:14,595
- Never sure...
- [clatter]

518
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:16,292
What was that?

519
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,599
[clattering, thumping]

520
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:20,470
[whispering]
Someone's in here.

521
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:21,776
I heard that criminals
often return to the...

522
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:23,038
- [thump]
- [gasps]

523
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:24,170
Okay, we're calling the police.

524
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,128
No, no, no, no, no.
Wait.

525
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,260
Wait.

526
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:52,372
[squeals]
What are you doing here?!

527
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:54,461
Do you know this guy?

528
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:57,594
Yes. It's that "writer" guy
I was telling you about.

529
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:59,814
Oh, him.

530
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:02,077
Yeah, him, I think.

531
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,557
Uh, what's with the air quotes?

532
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:05,167
- I'm published.
- [Shelby] So what?

533
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:07,039
I thought she told you
to stay away.

534
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:09,650
Yeah, and I did.

535
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,218
You're in my house right now.

536
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:14,307
Hey! Stop that.

537
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:15,438
You're disturbing
the crime scene.

538
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:16,962
Calm down, CSI.

539
00:31:17,092 --> 00:31:20,052
The real police
have already been over it.

540
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:22,010
And speaking of, Natalie,

541
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,099
I still think we should
give them a call.

542
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,318
No, you shouldn't.

543
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:27,450
I'm sorry.
Is your name Natalie?

544
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:28,974
You had a meeting
with them, right?

545
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:31,585
And let me guess.
They're starting

546
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:32,673
to ask a lot of questions

547
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,109
about how you and your mom

548
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,589
got in a big fight
the night she died,

549
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,243
how the neighbors heard.

550
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:39,332
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

551
00:31:39,462 --> 00:31:41,856
I know they don't have a
suspect or a murder weapon.

552
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,119
- They're looking.
- Yeah...

553
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,729
at you.

554
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,383
'Cause when they don't
have a suspect,

555
00:31:47,514 --> 00:31:48,645
they invent one.

556
00:31:50,865 --> 00:31:52,606
Now, I don't have
a suspect either,

557
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,651
but I do have a weapon.

558
00:31:54,782 --> 00:31:57,480
Your mom was
a big reader, right?

559
00:31:57,611 --> 00:31:58,786
I figured.

560
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,310
Great collection.

561
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,791
And what's missing
from this bookshelf?

562
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,184
What?

563
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:06,620
One of your books?

564
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:11,886
What's that?

565
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:15,542
This is a start.

566
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,205
There were two of these.

567
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:27,684
Obviously.

568
00:32:33,473 --> 00:32:34,648
[gags]

569
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,128
[groans]

570
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,481
When you say you want an ending,

571
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:43,309
I hope you mean a happy one.

572
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,746
Well, yeah. I'm not keen
on the sort of stories

573
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,270
where the heroes get shot
and dumped in the bay.

574
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:51,360
I mean, they sell,
but I want answers.

575
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:53,623
Did you know your
Deadly Affairbook

576
00:32:53,754 --> 00:32:56,365
only has a 2 1/2 star
rating on Goodreads?

577
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:58,324
It was my first book.

578
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:01,936
NovelGal54 says it's
boring and predictable.

579
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,112
Why not let the police
just find the answers?

580
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,461
- There's the ones...
- They said your father

581
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:06,897
had been drinking.
You believe that?

582
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:09,639
No.

583
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,206
Neither do I.

584
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:12,816
They settled for the
easy explanation.

585
00:33:12,947 --> 00:33:14,514
I don't want to see
the same mistake

586
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:16,907
get made again,
if it was a mistake.

587
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,345
Why, 'cause easy explanations
don't make for good books?

588
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:21,477
No, because easy explanations
reek of laziness,

589
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:23,523
and laziness is
the enemy of justice.

590
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:27,918
Really? I heard that "the
mystery is the best part,

591
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:31,183
and the beginning and
conclusion is ho-hum."

592
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:32,401
I've gotten better.

593
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,663
Hey, I don't write the reviews.

594
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,970
I just read them aloud.

595
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,106
I think we're good on our own.

596
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:43,195
[sighs]

597
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,631
Suit yourself.

598
00:33:46,241 --> 00:33:48,113
[clears throat]

599
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,117
But a word of warning.

600
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:53,640
Your dad was investigating

601
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,990
some very dangerous
people before he died.

602
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,993
Your mom may have been killed 'cause
she was considered a loose end.

603
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,039
What are you saying?

604
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:06,261
I'm saying you might be
a loose end, too.

605
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:09,090
And loose ends meet bad ends.

606
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:20,710
That's the end of that.

607
00:34:20,841 --> 00:34:21,885
[laughs]
You think so?

608
00:34:22,016 --> 00:34:23,539
No, hell, no.

609
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,367
I have read too much
pulpy crime fiction

610
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:28,022
to think we've seen the
end of Brody Long.

611
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:29,502
But when we do see him again,

612
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,634
don't tell him
I read that trash.

613
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,944
Yeah, I just wish
they cuffed him.

614
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,948
But, no, he just followed him
in that stupid yellow ride.

615
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,386
If they were charging him,
they would have told me.

616
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:46,301
Who do you think's gonna
pop back up first,

617
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,390
- Ethan or Brody?
- I have no idea.

618
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:50,653
I would not be
surprised at all if...

619
00:34:50,784 --> 00:34:52,699
God.
That was quick.

620
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,615
- We told you no.
- Yeah, I-I heard that.

621
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:58,487
But you listened to us even less
than you listen to your editors.

622
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:01,186
Um, no.

623
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,665
Um, well, maybe,

624
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:05,277
but also, uh...

625
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,192
this is my room.

626
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:28,561
[knocks]

627
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:30,345
I'm headed out.

628
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,391
Call if you come up with
anything that holds water.

629
00:35:32,521 --> 00:35:33,522
Will do.

630
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:49,538
Thing about comfort food is
it only works if you eat it.

631
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:53,325
Heh. I know.
I just don't really wanna be comforted.

632
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:55,240
I got a little too comfortable
after my dad died,

633
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,806
and look where that got me.

634
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:59,026
This place isn't so bad.

635
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,854
The fries are delicious.

636
00:36:00,984 --> 00:36:03,422
And free for employees.

637
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,081
Okay, let's play a game.

638
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:13,083
I know what you're doing and that
you're trying to distract me,

639
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,607
but I don't wanna be distracted.

640
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:16,696
I think I just need
to process everything.

641
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,698
I know. It's about that.

642
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:22,745
- What, like Clue?
- No.

643
00:36:22,876 --> 00:36:25,792
Well, actually, yeah, kinda.

644
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:29,883
Let's say we were
in a Brody Long novel.

645
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,711
Who are the possible suspects,

646
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:34,322
and what are their motives?

647
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,281
Okay. Um...

648
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,414
Ethan.

649
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,329
My mom was trying to
keep me away from him.

650
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,419
Good.
Too obvious, but good.

651
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,421
What about Brody?

652
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:49,381
The case was cold, and he
had to force it to reopen?

653
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:52,732
The police?

654
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:54,777
Maybe my mom proved
that they botched

655
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:56,214
the investigation of my dad,

656
00:36:56,344 --> 00:36:57,824
and that could be embarrassing.

657
00:36:57,954 --> 00:36:59,956
Would Nick allow that?

658
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,655
I don't know.
We're open to every possibility, right?

659
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:06,093
Okay. Me.

660
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,530
Your mom was trying to convince
you to go to law school,

661
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:11,011
and I would have
missed you too much.

662
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,841
Or me.

663
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:18,540
Inheritance?

664
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:19,976
What? No. I was...

665
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:21,543
I was gonna say drunken fight,

666
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,023
but is that what you think...

667
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:24,677
Is that why you wanted
to play this game?

668
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:25,852
No, I wasn't...

669
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,855
It's just a stupid game.

670
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,163
Yeah, it's really stupid.

671
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:36,819
And it's probably just a robber.

672
00:37:37,951 --> 00:37:39,126
Maybe.

673
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,520
I mean, who else could it be?

674
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:49,702
You know, it's just really hard to say.

675
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:53,183
I only wish I had paid
a bit more attention.

676
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:56,186
I think I told you
before I always felt

677
00:37:56,317 --> 00:37:59,320
like a real closeness
to that family.

678
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:00,669
Yeah, you mentioned that.

679
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,192
Not like I was
actually a part of it.

680
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,107
I mean, Laura was her mother,

681
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:06,501
and let me tell you,
she was a saint.

682
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,155
Yep. You mentioned that...

683
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,939
The way Natalie would
speak to her sometimes,

684
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,551
I would never...

685
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:16,119
But I cared.

686
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,602
Uh, you wrote that down, right?

687
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:21,951
- Uh, yep.
- Oh, you got it?

688
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,866
Got it all right here. Bye.

689
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:26,434
I wish I could help.
I really do,

690
00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:29,176
but I think she always
found me kind of...

691
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,221
annoying.
[laughs]

692
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,049
I find that hard to believe.

693
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,269
Anyways, thank you
so much for your time.

694
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,705
Oh, my pleasure.

695
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,359
And if you do find
that copy of my book,

696
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,230
I'd be happy to come back
and sign it for you.

697
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,145
Oh, absolutely.
It was a pleasure.

698
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:43,886
- Always nice to meet a fan.
- Nice to meet you, too.

699
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,323
Good luck!

700
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,022
Hmm.

701
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,330
[Nick] Afternoon,
Mrs. Ledbetter.

702
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,550
Chief Nick.
Nice to see you.

703
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:56,943
Is Natalie doing all right?

704
00:38:57,073 --> 00:38:58,205
Oh, all things considered.

705
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,728
[sighs]

706
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:01,687
Betty, I had a few
follow-up questions,

707
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:03,819
but if you don't mind
me asking, who's that?

708
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,560
Oh, him?

709
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:08,128
Ah, he's a true-crime novelist

710
00:39:08,258 --> 00:39:12,175
in town covering
Laura Romero's murder.

711
00:39:12,306 --> 00:39:14,874
Seems a little sweet on Natalie.

712
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:18,138
You know,
he knew Mr. Romero.

713
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:22,316
Apparently he was working
on a book about him, too.

714
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:24,492
Really hope this book's
better than his last.

715
00:39:24,623 --> 00:39:27,408
It was a real... [snorts]
snoozefest, you know?

716
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:28,453
Mm.

717
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,455
[chuckles]

718
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:32,413
Excuse me.

719
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:34,415
[Brody] Had the nosy
neighbor only been

720
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:37,549
as attentive through the night
as she was to the fight,

721
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,638
might she have se...

722
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:43,816
"Night," "fight"...

723
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:45,383
"might."

724
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:49,474
[clears throat]

725
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,737
[chuckles]
Is there a problem, Chief?

726
00:39:51,867 --> 00:39:54,217
I don't know. Might be.

727
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,351
Did you know that
you could be charged

728
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,353
with obstruction of justice

729
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,442
for threatening or interfering
with the witnesses

730
00:40:01,573 --> 00:40:02,878
of an ongoing investigation?

731
00:40:03,009 --> 00:40:05,838
Uh, just asking questions.

732
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,710
For your book?

733
00:40:08,841 --> 00:40:10,190
For my book.

734
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,757
See, that's the thing.

735
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,759
This murder isn't a story.

736
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,064
It isn't entertainment.

737
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,373
Lot of people were hurt by it,

738
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:24,247
people that are and
were very dear to me,

739
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:27,294
and I just don't take
kindly to other people

740
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,645
trying to exploit that pain.

741
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:32,691
Making myself clear, right?

742
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:34,519
I think so.

743
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,434
I think we want
the same thing here,

744
00:40:36,564 --> 00:40:39,001
for justice to be served
and to honor Andrea Romero.

745
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:42,396
No, we don't want
the same thing.

746
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:46,792
See, you want to protect
your Amazon sales.

747
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:52,232
I want to protect grieving
survivors from your harassment.

748
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:55,844
What I don't want...

749
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:57,455
is to see you
around this town again.

750
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:02,155
Drive safe.

751
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:24,612
Ethan, what are you doing?

752
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:26,745
[sighs] What are you
telling the police about me?

753
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,704
- Nothing!
- They came to talk to me.

754
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:32,620
They wanted to know where I was
the night your mother died.

755
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,317
They're talking to
everyone that's connected.

756
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:37,146
Oh, so... so now I'm connected?

757
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:38,539
You were with me the...

758
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,149
Don't lie to me, Natalie!

759
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,325
Everything okay?

760
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:45,677
Ah.

761
00:41:45,807 --> 00:41:48,244
Oh, so I guess it's you.

762
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,378
I guess you're what
needing space looks like.

763
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,903
Well, I hope
she's warned you, buddy,

764
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:56,775
but people
that get close to her,

765
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:58,298
they don't last very long.

766
00:41:58,428 --> 00:41:59,908
Better you than me.

767
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,083
Good luck.

768
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:10,005
You good?

769
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:11,267
Yeah.

770
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,966
I assume he's a suspect, right?

771
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,885
And now he's
been threatening me.

772
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:22,104
Threatening you?
How's that?

773
00:42:22,235 --> 00:42:23,889
I mean, he showed up
at my motel.

774
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:25,586
He showed up at my car.

775
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:27,283
I thought you said you
were gonna talk to him.

776
00:42:27,414 --> 00:42:29,416
I did. He's not
the most stand-up guy,

777
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,984
but he has an alibi for the time
of death, and it checks out,

778
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,247
so as far as we're concerned,
he's not a suspect.

779
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:37,380
But if you feel threatened,
we can...

780
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:39,557
No, no. It's...
It's okay.

781
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,994
Thank you for your time.

782
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:44,823
Actually, Natalie, uh,
I'm glad you stopped by.

783
00:42:44,953 --> 00:42:46,607
There's something
I wanted to run by you.

784
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:53,135
Okay, well, do I need a lawyer?

785
00:42:53,266 --> 00:42:54,920
You're entitled to one
if you want.

786
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:56,138
It's up to you.

787
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:58,488
No, it's fine.
What is it?

788
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,752
I've been reviewing
your statement,

789
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:03,363
and you said that you came
home and went straight to bed.

790
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,670
Is that correct?

791
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,063
I mean, I...
I packed a little bit.

792
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:09,325
I was upset.
You know that.

793
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:10,805
Of course.

794
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:12,590
And then you woke up
the next morning,

795
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,679
and you went downstairs
and found your mom, right?

796
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:16,376
Mm-hmm.

797
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:19,858
Do you recognize this room?

798
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,730
Yeah.
That's my bedroom.

799
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:26,647
And do you see what's here
on the nightstand?

800
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:28,388
The glass of water.

801
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:30,390
You see, what's weird
about this glass of water

802
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,000
is that it's fresh.

803
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:33,741
There's still
condensation on it.

804
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:35,613
I don't understand.

805
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:39,921
If you went straight to bed,

806
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:42,228
how do you explain
this glass of water?

807
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:43,838
I don't know.

808
00:43:43,969 --> 00:43:46,885
I was really drunk.

809
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,538
- Maybe I went down to...
- The kitchen?

810
00:43:52,151 --> 00:43:53,761
I was really drunk.
I don't really...

811
00:43:53,892 --> 00:43:55,720
You don't remember?

812
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,244
Right.

813
00:43:58,374 --> 00:44:00,681
Look, I'm just trying
to get your story straight.

814
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:03,989
If you don't remember going
downstairs for a glass of water,

815
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,470
I'm just curious what else you
might not remember seeing

816
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:09,037
or doing.

817
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,969
Sir, you can step over here.

818
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,128
Remind me again why
you're not on this case.

819
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:57,825
[officer] Everybody
makes mistakes, Chief.

820
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:11,186
[Monroe] Chief.

821
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:16,409
[sighs]

822
00:45:17,453 --> 00:45:18,890
Detective.

823
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,283
I just had
Natalie Romero in here.

824
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:22,545
Thought I told you not to...

825
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:24,025
She came in on her own.

826
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:27,072
She wanted to accuse
her ex-boyfriend again.

827
00:45:28,334 --> 00:45:29,596
Still stuck on that?

828
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,206
She's trying to throw us.

829
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:32,642
Now hear me out.

830
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:34,470
I asked her
about the glass of water,

831
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,342
and just like the suitcase,
she had nothing.

832
00:45:36,472 --> 00:45:37,386
Neither do we.

833
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,084
That is not true.

834
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:41,521
Anyone can tell that
that scene was staged,

835
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:44,132
and nothing that
this girl has said adds up.

836
00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,308
We need to start
seriously investigating

837
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:49,442
the possibility that Natalie
Romero is her mother's murderer.

838
00:45:52,314 --> 00:45:53,533
Yeah, I know.

839
00:46:38,012 --> 00:46:39,622
[knock on door]

840
00:46:49,328 --> 00:46:51,243
Hi. Natalie.

841
00:46:52,548 --> 00:46:54,899
Uh, I was gonna leave...

842
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:56,204
Uh-huh.

843
00:46:56,335 --> 00:46:58,424
I have something
you need to see.

844
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:05,126
What are these?

845
00:47:05,257 --> 00:47:07,737
You're not the only one
with investigative skills.

846
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:13,004
Wait. Detective Monroe

847
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:15,658
was the officer on scene
the night your father died?

848
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:17,269
That's a hell of a coincidence.

849
00:47:17,399 --> 00:47:20,054
Or is it?
Go to the last page, toxicology.

850
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:25,843
Redacted?

851
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:27,453
Yeah, entirely.

852
00:47:29,324 --> 00:47:31,587
What are
the legal ramifications?

853
00:47:34,155 --> 00:47:36,244
I thought you were
in law school.

854
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:38,029
Your dad mentioned that you
were prepping for your LSATs.

855
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,160
You passed, I assume.

856
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:41,684
It was over a year ago.

857
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:43,904
Look, you're right.
I can't just sit with my hands tied

858
00:47:44,035 --> 00:47:46,428
while the police are just
connecting all the wrong dots.

859
00:47:47,647 --> 00:47:50,389
What do I do?

860
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:51,999
You connect the right ones.

861
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,131
Let's go.

862
00:48:00,225 --> 00:48:02,096
[Brody]
When you're writing,

863
00:48:02,227 --> 00:48:05,317
you gotta try and get in the
heads of all your characters.

864
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:08,929
The same way police want to get
in the heads of criminals,

865
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,062
we want to get
in the heads of police.

866
00:48:11,192 --> 00:48:12,498
We wanna know
what they're thinking,

867
00:48:12,628 --> 00:48:14,979
and we want to know why.

868
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:16,981
The police think
the crime scene was staged.

869
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:18,199
Very good.

870
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,809
How can you tell?

871
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,073
Because I heard them
say it at the station.

872
00:48:22,203 --> 00:48:23,552
Huh.

873
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,380
And because
the drawers were all open,

874
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,339
and there was nothing taken
other than what was on her.

875
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:29,732
This table was flipped.
I mean, how would that even happen?

876
00:48:29,863 --> 00:48:30,995
Exactly. See?

877
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:36,870
I, um...

878
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:38,959
What about the window?

879
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:41,701
What about it?

880
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,453
The Smiths a few houses down

881
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:55,758
had a robbery a few months ago,

882
00:48:55,889 --> 00:48:57,195
and they did the same thing,

883
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:58,936
broke a piece of glass
on their door, too.

884
00:48:59,066 --> 00:49:00,633
We call this the point of entry,

885
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:03,157
except in this case, it wasn't.

886
00:49:03,288 --> 00:49:04,985
So you think that robbery
was staged, too?

887
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:07,161
No. I think
this murder was staged

888
00:49:07,292 --> 00:49:08,641
to look like that robbery.

889
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:10,730
Here. Look at this.

890
00:49:12,688 --> 00:49:13,820
Glass.

891
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,082
Clearly.

892
00:49:15,213 --> 00:49:17,519
Take a closer look.

893
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,086
It's on the blanket...

894
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:23,177
which could only be true
if it was broken in

895
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:25,136
after the place
was being ransacked.

896
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:27,747
You think the police
caught that?

897
00:49:27,877 --> 00:49:30,880
I don't know, but it means
that whoever did this

898
00:49:31,011 --> 00:49:33,405
had to come in from one
of the other doors.

899
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,233
Or they were already
in the house.

900
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:41,587
[sighs]

901
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,852
This is a lot.

902
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,419
Maybe we should take a break.

903
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:49,116
You want to get
something to eat?

904
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:51,205
I mean, I never did get
to try those fries.

905
00:49:51,336 --> 00:49:53,642
Um, I think I want to spend
a little more time here...

906
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:56,080
- Okay.
- alone.

907
00:49:57,472 --> 00:49:58,908
Are you sure that's a good idea?

908
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,345
Yeah, Shelby's
about to get off work.

909
00:50:00,475 --> 00:50:02,173
She can come by and pick me up.

910
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:06,264
I just kinda want to spend
some time here by myself.

911
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:08,875
Well, I get it.
I don't like it, but I get it.

912
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,311
Actually, I don't get it.

913
00:50:10,442 --> 00:50:11,921
I'll text you
the second I leave.

914
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:12,922
I promise.

915
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,099
You better.

916
00:50:15,229 --> 00:50:17,492
[clears throat]
Oh, and, hey,

917
00:50:17,623 --> 00:50:18,537
just so you know,

918
00:50:18,667 --> 00:50:22,106
you make a great heroine.

919
00:50:22,236 --> 00:50:23,455
Thanks.

920
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:27,067
And thank you for trusting me.

921
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,460
Hmm.

922
00:50:46,347 --> 00:50:47,522
But how could...

923
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:49,829
[glass shatters]

924
00:50:52,745 --> 00:50:54,181
Brody?

925
00:50:56,749 --> 00:50:58,142
Shelby?

926
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,320
Ethan?

927
00:51:08,326 --> 00:51:10,980
[panting]

928
00:51:52,021 --> 00:51:53,240
[gasps]

929
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:08,429
[Nick] Can you tell me anything
else about your assailant?

930
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,866
Identifying marks?

931
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,565
No. His face
was covered.

932
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,436
- With this, right?
- Yeah.

933
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,091
I cut his arm, though,
and it was pretty deep.

934
00:52:19,658 --> 00:52:21,921
No blood. Seems clean.

935
00:52:25,533 --> 00:52:27,709
Natalie, have you
been drinking today?

936
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:29,320
[laughs]

937
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,669
Excuse me?

938
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:31,887
I'm sorry, but I have to ask.

939
00:52:32,018 --> 00:52:33,759
[Shelby] Well,
I have to ask, too.

940
00:52:33,889 --> 00:52:35,456
Why don't you start treating her

941
00:52:35,587 --> 00:52:38,067
like the victim that she
is instead of a suspect?

942
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,113
She was almost just killed,

943
00:52:40,244 --> 00:52:41,636
no thanks to your
handy police work.

944
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,421
Shelby.

945
00:52:43,551 --> 00:52:47,729
Natalie, what were you
doing in there all alone?

946
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:49,601
What does it matter?

947
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:51,777
- I am on your side here.
- Are you?

948
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,258
'Cause kinda starting to
feel like maybe you're not.

949
00:52:54,388 --> 00:52:56,173
Natalie, I got you a room so that
you wouldn't have to be here.

950
00:52:56,303 --> 00:52:58,305
Yeah. Thank you.

951
00:52:58,436 --> 00:53:00,264
I think I'm gonna head
there right now, actually.

952
00:53:01,613 --> 00:53:03,180
- Shelby.
- Gladly.

953
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,272
I think you need
to take a look inside.

954
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,243
That's from the shirt you were
wearing the night of the murder.

955
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,202
How'd you know that?

956
00:53:25,332 --> 00:53:27,378
I-I watched the, uh,
surveillance footage at the bar.

957
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:29,467
God, there's cameras
everywhere now, isn't there?

958
00:53:29,597 --> 00:53:30,772
Yeah.

959
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:32,165
Yeah, there are.

960
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:36,561
So this was stuck
in the window frame,

961
00:53:36,691 --> 00:53:39,564
which is the point of entry,
but we know it isn't.

962
00:53:39,694 --> 00:53:41,087
No. I would
have seen it.

963
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,567
So would the police.

964
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:43,872
If someone's trying to frame me,

965
00:53:44,003 --> 00:53:45,700
they're not gonna
fall for it, right?

966
00:53:45,831 --> 00:53:48,399
I don't know.
They seem to be missing a lot lately.

967
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:50,836
Oh, uh, I talked to Mrs.
Ledbetter, your neighbor.

968
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:53,578
Every question they were
asking her was leading.

969
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,667
They basically wanted her
to say that you were awful.

970
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:59,758
But she... she didn't, though.

971
00:53:59,888 --> 00:54:01,499
She seems to really care,

972
00:54:01,629 --> 00:54:03,631
and, mm, because
you're not awful.

973
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:04,719
No, I am.

974
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:09,985
I was awful that night.

975
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:13,250
I was just so frustrated
and confused and sad,

976
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,077
and I feel guilty
even though I didn't...

977
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:17,297
- I get it. I do.
- I know.

978
00:54:17,428 --> 00:54:19,386
Everyone says they get it.
Everyone says they understand,

979
00:54:19,517 --> 00:54:21,867
but you can't...
you can't understand unless...

980
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,695
Unless you've been
through it yourself.

981
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,702
I lost both my parents

982
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:33,095
in a car accident when I was 19.

983
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:35,141
I'm so sorry.

984
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,882
The last thing I said to 'em

985
00:54:37,012 --> 00:54:39,406
was that I wouldn't pay
for the window I broke

986
00:54:39,537 --> 00:54:41,713
when I was mad about
a rejection letter.

987
00:54:43,149 --> 00:54:45,499
I came here looking for a story.

988
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,675
That's true, but...

989
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:50,156
I feel a real connection to you.

990
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,941
And I know that sounds weird,
but, I mean, I just...

991
00:54:53,072 --> 00:54:56,336
I-I feel like I knew exactly
what you were feeling,

992
00:54:56,467 --> 00:55:01,559
th-the loneliness a-and
the confusion, the guilt.

993
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,175
Everything I want
to say to you right now

994
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,526
sounds kind of like the annoying
stuff everyone was saying to me.

995
00:55:12,657 --> 00:55:15,268
Well, maybe
some of them are right.

996
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:19,272
Yeah. Doesn't make it
easier to hear.

997
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:21,535
Ah, but sometimes
we have to hear it.

998
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,235
Yeah.

999
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:27,541
When I interviewed
your father...

1000
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:34,287
he talked about you.

1001
00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:37,943
Uh, this may be hard to hear,

1002
00:55:38,073 --> 00:55:40,467
but I think it might
make things easier, too.

1003
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:53,262
Okay. Where'd we leave off?

1004
00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:55,700
[Brody] You were telling me
about the night of the 16th.

1005
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,398
Right. So I had
just met with...

1006
00:55:58,529 --> 00:55:59,965
[cell phone buzzing]

1007
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:03,011
Sorry. Thought I had
turned that off.

1008
00:56:03,142 --> 00:56:04,883
[chuckles]

1009
00:56:05,013 --> 00:56:06,928
It's my daughter.

1010
00:56:07,059 --> 00:56:08,452
She's quite a character.

1011
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,629
Look.

1012
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:15,937
This is your face.

1013
00:56:16,068 --> 00:56:17,156
[Brody]
Natalie, right?

1014
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:18,636
Oh, I mentioned her, huh?

1015
00:56:18,766 --> 00:56:20,681
Mm. Once or twice
or 20 times.

1016
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:22,422
She's pretty.

1017
00:56:22,553 --> 00:56:23,989
She's remarkable.

1018
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:26,078
I'd tell you she was single,

1019
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:29,124
but she typically goes for
guys that are a little more...

1020
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,605
you know.

1021
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:34,347
Besides, next year, she'll
be away at law school,

1022
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:36,175
so even if...

1023
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:41,659
I'm really gonna miss her.

1024
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,182
To be honest,

1025
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:45,358
this case has
kind of gotten to me.

1026
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:49,057
You know, you...
you think you can trust someone, and then...

1027
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:55,063
I know I can
always count on her,

1028
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:57,196
no matter what,

1029
00:56:57,326 --> 00:57:00,155
and I cannot wait to
see what she becomes.

1030
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:08,468
I failed him.

1031
00:57:10,557 --> 00:57:12,994
- N-No. No, that doesn't...
- He can't count on me.

1032
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,692
I'm not in law school.

1033
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,389
I'm literally not doing
anything with my life.

1034
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,043
Yet.

1035
00:57:18,173 --> 00:57:20,132
Natalie, he had faith in you,

1036
00:57:20,262 --> 00:57:21,568
a-and he wasn't wrong.

1037
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:24,397
You are remarkable,
no matter what.

1038
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,356
Is there more?

1039
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,011
Hours.

1040
00:57:51,598 --> 00:57:52,556
[Natalie]
Thank you.

1041
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,866
My dad was saying this case
made him distrust people.

1042
00:57:58,997 --> 00:58:00,694
I wonder
who he was talking about.

1043
00:58:00,825 --> 00:58:02,870
That's what I
intend to find out.

1044
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:05,264
Thank you for helping me.

1045
00:58:05,394 --> 00:58:07,875
I feel like
it's been really hard,

1046
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:11,749
but having you here has kind of made
me feel like I can get through it.

1047
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:16,580
But I feel like my dad was
definitely wrong about one thing.

1048
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:22,107
[car door opens]

1049
00:58:22,237 --> 00:58:24,283
What's going on?

1050
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:25,980
[indistinct conversation]

1051
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:27,765
I don't know.

1052
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:31,725
[Natalie]
That's my car.

1053
00:58:31,856 --> 00:58:33,771
Detective, what are you doing?

1054
00:58:33,901 --> 00:58:35,250
Natalie, I need you
to stay back.

1055
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:36,948
Do you have a search warrant?

1056
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,952
[Natalie]
I don't understand.

1057
00:58:41,082 --> 00:58:41,953
Detective, I have
something here.

1058
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:49,743
Recognize this?

1059
00:58:49,874 --> 00:58:51,658
- It's the...
- Just a bookend.

1060
00:58:53,051 --> 00:58:54,313
Log it.

1061
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,664
Natalie Romero,
you are under arrest

1062
00:58:57,795 --> 00:58:59,971
for the murder of your
mother, Laura Romero.

1063
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,755
You have the right
to remain silent.

1064
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:02,930
Put your hands behind your back.

1065
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:04,802
- Please...
- Anything you say

1066
00:59:04,932 --> 00:59:06,804
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

1067
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:08,719
You have the right
to an attorney.

1068
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,677
If you cannot afford one, one
will be appointed for you.

1069
00:59:10,808 --> 00:59:12,549
You understand the rights
as I have read them to you?

1070
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:13,637
Natalie...

1071
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:16,596
no matter what.

1072
00:59:43,144 --> 00:59:45,669
Before you say anything,
Natalie, I need to remind you

1073
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:47,714
that we are not talking
friend to friend.

1074
00:59:47,845 --> 00:59:50,369
Yeah, it's pretty obvious
you're not on my side,

1075
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,371
but, uh, question.
Are you on hers?

1076
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:54,721
The bookend matches

1077
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:56,288
the contusion
on your mother's head,

1078
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:57,550
and it's covered in prints,

1079
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,204
all of which,
I suspect, are yours.

1080
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:00,727
[Natalie] Because you
wore gloves.

1081
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:03,251
That's not the bookend
that killed my mother.

1082
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:05,471
It just looks like it.
That's how bookends work.

1083
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,865
There's two of them.
You took that one after the fact

1084
01:00:07,995 --> 01:00:09,562
and just got lucky that
I already touched it.

1085
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,085
What are you talking about?

1086
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,783
You knew my father, didn't you?

1087
01:00:14,175 --> 01:00:16,569
You know we did.
We were friends.

1088
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,092
Yeah, but something
happened, didn't it,

1089
01:00:18,223 --> 01:00:20,268
and you redacted
his toxicology report.

1090
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:21,705
This is ridiculous.

1091
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:23,054
Is it?

1092
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:24,708
She handled my father's case,

1093
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:26,666
just like she's handling
my mother's case.

1094
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:28,973
I heard about all the
questions you asked Betty,

1095
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:31,105
how you found
every piece of evidence.

1096
01:00:31,236 --> 01:00:33,586
And if I'd aimed my knife better
and it ended up in your stomach,

1097
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,849
that bookend never even
would have been in my car.

1098
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,894
[laughs]

1099
01:00:38,547 --> 01:00:39,505
Nick, you can't...

1100
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,556
- You can't seriously...
- Let me see your arm, Monroe.

1101
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:04,835
The other arm.
Take off the jacket.

1102
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,017
Get out of my way.

1103
01:01:19,153 --> 01:01:20,285
I'm sorry. I'm sor...

1104
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:34,125
Natalie.

1105
01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:36,518
Hey. You okay?

1106
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:37,955
Th-They're not charging you?

1107
01:01:38,085 --> 01:01:40,958
Not yet, but they won't
let me leave town.

1108
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:51,098
Which is the exact opposite
of what I told you, I think.

1109
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:52,709
Well, she needs
someone she can trust.

1110
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:56,625
Obviously your department
isn't doing the trick.

1111
01:01:56,756 --> 01:01:59,672
So I take it she got this
ridiculous conspiracy theory

1112
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:02,327
in her head from you.

1113
01:02:02,457 --> 01:02:03,807
Oh, kidding.

1114
01:02:03,937 --> 01:02:06,723
This is all a literary
exercise for you.

1115
01:02:06,853 --> 01:02:09,769
The thing is, out here
in the real world,

1116
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:13,120
what you're doing is dangerous.

1117
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:15,035
Right.

1118
01:02:15,166 --> 01:02:18,038
You've got experience being
dangerous, don't you?

1119
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,997
Did your friend tell you
that he'd been arrested

1120
01:02:20,127 --> 01:02:21,520
for breaking and entering...

1121
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,566
and assault?

1122
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:26,960
Is that true?

1123
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,354
Yeah, see, if you
had stolen his file

1124
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:30,659
and not your father's,

1125
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:33,401
you would have seen a lot more

1126
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:35,795
than a toxicology report
that had been redacted

1127
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:38,015
to protect the reputation
of a good man.

1128
01:02:44,238 --> 01:02:46,501
Why don't I
walk you out, Natalie?

1129
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:07,305
Excuse me!

1130
01:03:07,435 --> 01:03:09,611
Hi. Can I help you?

1131
01:03:09,742 --> 01:03:11,962
I was just wondering if you'd
turned up anything new.

1132
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:14,616
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

1133
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:16,401
Oh, how rude. Greg.

1134
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,229
Greg Wilson.

1135
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:20,971
Anyway, I know
how annoying it must be

1136
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:22,537
when people play
amateur detective,

1137
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:24,626
but my wife's been dying to know

1138
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,324
if you turned up anything
on those tapes.

1139
01:03:26,454 --> 01:03:29,066
Uh, I'm sorry.
Let's, um, just pretend

1140
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:30,719
that I'm new to this case.

1141
01:03:30,850 --> 01:03:32,243
Which tapes
are we talking about?

1142
01:03:32,373 --> 01:03:35,463
Oh, I'm sorry.
I live just down the street.

1143
01:03:35,594 --> 01:03:38,423
I told the other officer my camera
doesn't see the Romero house,

1144
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:41,469
just the street, but he said
they might be valuable anyway

1145
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,255
to paint a full
and vibrant picture.

1146
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:46,997
Guy had a pretty good
vocabulary for a cop,

1147
01:03:47,127 --> 01:03:49,260
actually sounded
more like a writer.

1148
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:54,918
Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

1149
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:57,572
Uh, no. You've been
extremely helpful.

1150
01:03:57,703 --> 01:03:59,270
It's just that
that other officer

1151
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,228
is going to be
in a lot of trouble.

1152
01:04:04,231 --> 01:04:06,625
Okay, look, I'm the
first to admit it.

1153
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,192
I haven't always
been a nice guy.

1154
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,021
Except you
didn't admit it, so...

1155
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,066
What do you want to show me?

1156
01:04:13,197 --> 01:04:15,939
I-I used to have
some anger issues.

1157
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:18,593
I'm not gonna
say it's, you know,

1158
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:20,117
from what happened
to my parents,

1159
01:04:20,247 --> 01:04:21,640
but you know where
I'm coming from, right?

1160
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,816
Anger? Yeah, I'm familiar
with the emotion.

1161
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:25,687
What do you want to show me?

1162
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:27,864
Yeah, of course.
I just wanted to make sure we're cool.

1163
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:29,953
- We're not.
- Wait.

1164
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:31,824
Okay, wait, wait.
All right, look.

1165
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:33,782
Remember how I said the cops
talked to your neighbors?

1166
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:35,436
- Yeah, Mrs. Ledbetter.
- Right.

1167
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,265
And I talked to the
neighbor next-door to her.

1168
01:04:40,311 --> 01:04:41,399
Guess what.

1169
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:45,098
What is this?

1170
01:04:45,229 --> 01:04:46,883
The night of the murder.

1171
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:48,275
Does it show anything?

1172
01:04:48,406 --> 01:04:49,973
I don't know. Shall we?

1173
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:51,235
Yeah.

1174
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:58,068
Hey, that's Ethan's car.

1175
01:04:58,198 --> 01:04:59,721
He was there.

1176
01:04:59,852 --> 01:05:01,114
Wait. Let it play.

1177
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:15,433
[pounding on door]

1178
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:18,958
[pounding]

1179
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:41,067
[gasps]
You're alive.

1180
01:05:41,198 --> 01:05:44,679
What are you still doing
talking to this creep?

1181
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:47,291
"This creep" is the only
one making progress

1182
01:05:47,421 --> 01:05:49,075
- towards figuring out...
- Natalie, I thought I told you

1183
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,990
that if you wanted
to move on, you have to stop...

1184
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:52,383
She doesn't have to do anything.

1185
01:05:52,513 --> 01:05:54,472
She can make her own decisions.

1186
01:05:54,602 --> 01:05:56,430
Obviously, because right now she's
making a pretty crappy one.

1187
01:05:56,561 --> 01:05:57,866
Trying to solve
her mother's murder?

1188
01:05:57,997 --> 01:06:00,304
Spending time alone
with a convicted...

1189
01:06:00,434 --> 01:06:02,784
whatever you call a person
who assaults people.

1190
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:04,264
- Well said.
- Come on, Natalie. Let's go.

1191
01:06:04,395 --> 01:06:07,006
No, wait. No,
Brody has new evidence.

1192
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,270
New evidence?

1193
01:06:10,401 --> 01:06:13,621
How long have you been
waiting to show her that, Brody?

1194
01:06:13,752 --> 01:06:14,579
Little while.

1195
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,276
Hmm.

1196
01:06:16,407 --> 01:06:18,409
Well, I have old news
for you, too, Natalie.

1197
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:21,238
I was actually interested
in this clown,

1198
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:24,502
so I e-mailed myself his
manuscript from his computer.

1199
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:27,853
Look at the title.

1200
01:06:29,855 --> 01:06:32,727
"A Daughter's Betrayal."

1201
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,773
- You're his main suspect.
- You were.

1202
01:06:34,903 --> 01:06:36,688
Obviously.
How could you not be?

1203
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:37,950
Oh, but you've cleared me now?

1204
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,605
There's video of...

1205
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:42,520
It's your boyfriend.

1206
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,043
I mean, what other motive
could he have had?

1207
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:45,523
What motive could I have had?!

1208
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:48,091
Well, an inheritance.

1209
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:51,050
Look, Natalie, she's just trying

1210
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:52,486
to play us against each other

1211
01:06:52,617 --> 01:06:54,358
to keep you from getting
back on your feet

1212
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:56,577
and leaving her to waste away
in some neighborhood bar.

1213
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:57,926
Are you kidding me?

1214
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,059
No, get this.

1215
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:03,454
He was at the funeral.

1216
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:04,933
I told you what
that means, right?

1217
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,500
- What does that mean?
- What that means

1218
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:08,154
is I'm sick of your games.

1219
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:10,635
- Finally. Let's just...
- No, both of you.

1220
01:07:10,765 --> 01:07:12,115
I'm sick of being
steered around.

1221
01:07:12,245 --> 01:07:13,638
If this is gonna
go badly for me,

1222
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:15,422
I want it to be
because I made a mistake,

1223
01:07:15,553 --> 01:07:17,250
- not because of someone else's.
- Natalie, trust me. I...

1224
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:19,731
Trust, yeah.
I'm having a hard time with that lately.

1225
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:22,908
I need to take some time to
figure out how to trust myself.

1226
01:07:27,913 --> 01:07:30,046
That's a bad choice of words.

1227
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:32,918
[scoffs]
And so are these.

1228
01:07:33,962 --> 01:07:35,442
Maybe so.

1229
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,684
[knocks on door]

1230
01:08:07,605 --> 01:08:09,128
Natalie?

1231
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,136
Nat?

1232
01:08:19,573 --> 01:08:21,097
Natalie?

1233
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:31,019
Natalie?

1234
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:38,157
This was the last place
I saw my mother alive.

1235
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:41,726
And I was really mean to her.

1236
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:46,992
And I blame myself,
but shouldn't...

1237
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:51,257
because somebody took her.

1238
01:08:51,388 --> 01:08:53,912
Natalie, you said that you
had new evidence to show me.

1239
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:16,761
You know, Ethan does
a lot of creepy things.

1240
01:09:16,891 --> 01:09:19,285
Natalie, I think
that accusation's

1241
01:09:19,416 --> 01:09:21,069
pretty played out.
Don't you?

1242
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,159
I mean, I'm glad
you're not accusing

1243
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:24,551
Monroe anymore, but...

1244
01:09:24,682 --> 01:09:26,162
He used to just sit in his car

1245
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:27,946
after he was dropping
me off and wait

1246
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:30,078
for my bedroom lights
to turn off.

1247
01:09:30,209 --> 01:09:33,169
I kind of used to like looking
out and seeing his car.

1248
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:36,781
But I wasn't the only
one that could see him.

1249
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:38,565
There's a camera.

1250
01:09:40,001 --> 01:09:41,873
[Nick] You have
a security camera?

1251
01:09:42,003 --> 01:09:43,744
[Natalie]
No, we don't.

1252
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:48,793
The Wilsons down the street do.

1253
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:54,625
And you're saying this
camera caught something.

1254
01:10:01,371 --> 01:10:05,070
Ethan. He was here
a little earlier

1255
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:06,680
than the coroner thought, but...

1256
01:10:06,811 --> 01:10:08,943
I would love to get a
look at that footage.

1257
01:10:09,074 --> 01:10:11,294
[knock on door]

1258
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:15,298
[Natalie]
It's him.

1259
01:10:18,344 --> 01:10:20,912
I want you to stay up here.

1260
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:30,008
[Ethan] You know, I'm starting
to think it's a little funny

1261
01:10:30,138 --> 01:10:33,054
that everywhere she is,
there you are.

1262
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:35,796
- [Nick] I think it's funny...
- Just because you have a gun

1263
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,320
doesn't mean
you can protect her.

1264
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:38,799
- Ethan, calm down!
- I can protect her!

1265
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:40,410
- Calm down.
- That's my job!

1266
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:41,498
- [blow thumps]
- [gunshot]

1267
01:10:41,628 --> 01:10:42,673
Nick?

1268
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:50,333
Nick?

1269
01:10:53,292 --> 01:10:54,511
Ethan?

1270
01:10:59,951 --> 01:11:01,257
[gasping]

1271
01:11:01,387 --> 01:11:02,736
Oh, my God.

1272
01:11:02,867 --> 01:11:05,261
[Nick] He hit me.

1273
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:06,610
He hit me. I was
holding my gun on him,

1274
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:07,654
and he hit me.

1275
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:10,570
He was probably drunk.

1276
01:11:10,701 --> 01:11:14,487
Yeah. Well, he was probably
drunk that night, too.

1277
01:11:14,618 --> 01:11:18,839
Yeah. At the bar, there's
surveillance footage of it.

1278
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,364
- So...
- So I was wrong, Natalie.

1279
01:11:21,494 --> 01:11:23,322
Looks like you've
made your case.

1280
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:29,763
Let's go out to my car.
I can call this in,

1281
01:11:29,894 --> 01:11:31,287
and then we can go get
the video of the street.

1282
01:11:31,417 --> 01:11:33,985
Nick, you're bleeding.

1283
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:42,254
Must have hit me
harder than I thought.

1284
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:09,020
Natalie Romero,
you are under arrest

1285
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:11,414
for the murder of your
mother, Laura Romero.

1286
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:14,765
You...

1287
01:12:15,983 --> 01:12:18,551
I advise you not to resist.

1288
01:12:20,118 --> 01:12:22,512
[pounding on door]

1289
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:24,122
Brody Long?

1290
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,602
Oh, thank heavens.

1291
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:27,299
- You're under arrest.
- That's fine.

1292
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:29,562
Wait. What? For what?

1293
01:12:29,693 --> 01:12:31,477
Impersonating an officer and
obstruction of justice.

1294
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:33,566
Fine. I plead guilty.
You need to see this.

1295
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,400
Help!

1296
01:12:41,531 --> 01:12:43,402
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1297
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:45,448
Help!
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1298
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:47,363
No. No.

1299
01:12:47,493 --> 01:12:49,147
[pounding]
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1300
01:12:49,277 --> 01:12:50,061
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1301
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:53,064
Help!
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1302
01:12:53,194 --> 01:12:55,458
- [pounding]
- [Nick] Nice dog.

1303
01:12:55,588 --> 01:12:57,111
Thanks.

1304
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:59,287
Let's go, Lady.
Good girl.

1305
01:12:59,418 --> 01:13:01,725
Betty!
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1306
01:13:01,855 --> 01:13:04,075
Help!
Mrs. Ledbetter!

1307
01:13:04,205 --> 01:13:05,946
No. No.

1308
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:13,301
She's not back at the
crime scene, is she?

1309
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:17,741
Knowing her, probably. Why?

1310
01:13:17,871 --> 01:13:20,396
Nick said he was going there
to follow up on a hunch.

1311
01:13:20,526 --> 01:13:22,528
Wait.
I'm coming with you.

1312
01:13:22,659 --> 01:13:24,922
Obviously.
You're still under arrest.

1313
01:13:40,067 --> 01:13:41,504
Hey, hey, let me out.

1314
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,333
Hey, I could be your backup.

1315
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:47,379
I-I'll watch your six
or something.

1316
01:14:02,046 --> 01:14:02,960
Natalie!

1317
01:14:03,090 --> 01:14:04,309
- Oh, God.
- Natalie!

1318
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,833
He's dead.
It's too bad.

1319
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:09,053
We really could have used his
sixth sense for stalking Natalie.

1320
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:10,794
What are you doing?
Stop. You're gonna...

1321
01:14:10,924 --> 01:14:12,796
He doesn't have a sixth sense.
He has a tracking app.

1322
01:14:12,926 --> 01:14:14,275
A tracking app?

1323
01:14:14,406 --> 01:14:16,408
It's how insecure people
date these days.

1324
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,454
No pass code. Idiot.

1325
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:19,716
Sorry.

1326
01:14:23,110 --> 01:14:25,069
There.
South shore, Vernon Bay.

1327
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:26,810
What's there?

1328
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,726
Just marsh. It's where
the Manzottis used to...

1329
01:14:29,856 --> 01:14:31,031
Oh, God.

1330
01:14:40,171 --> 01:14:42,434
But I'm supposed
to be under arrest!

1331
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:52,009
[grunting]

1332
01:14:57,797 --> 01:15:00,147
You're never gonna
get away with this.

1333
01:15:00,278 --> 01:15:01,932
Too many people saw you.

1334
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,673
Yeah. Well, that's
the thing about trust.

1335
01:15:03,803 --> 01:15:05,936
People trust you, you can
get away with anything.

1336
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:08,155
Is that what you told my father?

1337
01:15:08,286 --> 01:15:10,027
I didn't have to tell
your father anything,

1338
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:11,724
because he trusted me.

1339
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:14,945
See, your dad,
he wasn't an idiot.

1340
01:15:15,075 --> 01:15:18,296
As a matter of fact, I think he
probably would have rolled over

1341
01:15:18,426 --> 01:15:20,951
if the Manzotti had asked him,

1342
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:22,866
just like I did.

1343
01:15:22,996 --> 01:15:24,432
[grunts]

1344
01:15:24,563 --> 01:15:25,912
But they couldn't
risk asking him,

1345
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,218
because they didn't trust him...

1346
01:15:28,741 --> 01:15:29,916
or you and your mom.

1347
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:31,135
You're just not so stacked

1348
01:15:31,265 --> 01:15:33,180
in the brain department,
are you?

1349
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:37,489
I give you this.
You got bigger balls than your dad did.

1350
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:42,842
[car approaching]

1351
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:44,975
[groaning]

1352
01:15:47,455 --> 01:15:48,935
Come back here.

1353
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:54,114
Oh, you...

1354
01:15:58,162 --> 01:16:00,338
Natalie. Natalie!

1355
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:02,645
[Monroe]
Put the gun down, and put your hands up!

1356
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:09,869
Monroe...

1357
01:16:12,785 --> 01:16:15,483
look, you...
you were right all along.
Natalie did it.

1358
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:17,137
Chief, do not make me
pull this trigger.

1359
01:16:17,268 --> 01:16:18,791
Put the gun down.

1360
01:16:21,664 --> 01:16:24,710
All right. Just, uh,
calm down, all right?

1361
01:16:26,451 --> 01:16:27,800
Put it down, Nick.

1362
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,811
Put your hands behind your back.

1363
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:45,209
Listen, I don't know what that
squirrely little writer said...

1364
01:16:45,339 --> 01:16:47,907
I saw the tape, Nick.

1365
01:16:49,996 --> 01:16:51,171
[gasping]

1366
01:16:59,397 --> 01:17:01,878
Who else saw the tape?

1367
01:17:02,008 --> 01:17:03,575
Everybody.

1368
01:17:04,924 --> 01:17:06,317
Monroe,
you're a decent detective,

1369
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:08,667
but you are one lousy liar.

1370
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:11,844
Goodbye, Monroe.

1371
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:14,455
[gunshot]

1372
01:17:14,586 --> 01:17:15,805
Natalie. Natalie.

1373
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:19,547
Thank you.

1374
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:20,636
Oh, God.

1375
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:26,424
- Drop the gun, Natalie.
- Don't do it.

1376
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:29,427
Or what?
You're gonna kill me anyway.

1377
01:17:29,557 --> 01:17:31,342
Drop the gun,

1378
01:17:31,472 --> 01:17:34,171
or I'm gonna kill Shelby, too.

1379
01:17:34,301 --> 01:17:36,390
That the same deal
you offered my mom?

1380
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,783
Would you just
have come upstairs...

1381
01:17:37,914 --> 01:17:41,047
You really think
I wanted to do any of this?!

1382
01:17:41,178 --> 01:17:42,788
Your dad...

1383
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:48,228
Killing your dad hurt me,

1384
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:50,753
but it solved too many problems.

1385
01:17:50,883 --> 01:17:52,972
And to have those problems
resurface again

1386
01:17:53,103 --> 01:17:55,235
just because Laura wanted
to play amateur detective,

1387
01:17:55,366 --> 01:17:56,715
I couldn't let it happen.
I couldn't...

1388
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:01,198
Nick. Thank you for
coming over so late.

1389
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:02,765
Of course, Laura.

1390
01:18:02,895 --> 01:18:04,636
You got me thinking
of Andy, too.

1391
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:06,246
Come in.

1392
01:18:10,337 --> 01:18:12,905
I tried for months now not to
think about it, but the truth is,

1393
01:18:13,036 --> 01:18:14,559
I just can't stop.

1394
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,605
Yeah, I know
the feeling, trust me,

1395
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:19,869
but I just think
that now you should...

1396
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:22,045
Andy hadn't had
a drink in five years.

1397
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:25,048
All right, so maybe
he slipped, huh?

1398
01:18:25,178 --> 01:18:27,050
I mean, I know it's
hard to believe...

1399
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:28,312
I requested his case file.

1400
01:18:31,968 --> 01:18:33,709
Yeah, I heard.

1401
01:18:35,362 --> 01:18:39,105
Oh, but my request was denied.

1402
01:18:39,236 --> 01:18:41,107
Laura...

1403
01:18:41,238 --> 01:18:43,457
it is not healthy to keep
digging up the past.

1404
01:18:43,588 --> 01:18:45,242
- [laughs]
- What?

1405
01:18:45,372 --> 01:18:47,461
It's just funny
you used that phrase.

1406
01:18:47,592 --> 01:18:49,942
I filed a request
with the Coroner, too.

1407
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:54,120
You did what?

1408
01:18:56,166 --> 01:19:00,126
When he died, I didn't want
to look at the reports,

1409
01:19:00,257 --> 01:19:03,173
the autopsy and everything.

1410
01:19:03,303 --> 01:19:05,262
Everyone said I shouldn't.
Even you said it.

1411
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:09,266
But now I need to, Nick.

1412
01:19:12,443 --> 01:19:14,010
And Natalie?

1413
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:17,709
What does she say
about what you're doing?

1414
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,190
I haven't told her
any of the details,

1415
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,715
but she disapproves,
thinks it's a waste of time.

1416
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:28,764
The truth is Natalie and I have been
going through a bit of a rough patch.

1417
01:19:34,334 --> 01:19:36,206
[Nick] And now you.

1418
01:19:36,336 --> 01:19:38,861
Why couldn't you
just let this be?

1419
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:40,863
Because it's in my blood.

1420
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:44,083
That's too bad.

1421
01:19:46,564 --> 01:19:47,695
I'm sorry, Andy.

1422
01:19:53,701 --> 01:19:54,833
[car horn honks]

1423
01:19:54,964 --> 01:19:56,356
Game over!

1424
01:19:57,662 --> 01:19:59,403
[gunshot]

1425
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,406
- [Natalie panting]
- [Nick grunts]

1426
01:20:05,148 --> 01:20:06,149
Nat?

1427
01:20:15,245 --> 01:20:16,463
Natalie, are you hurt?

1428
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:18,596
That's okay. You're okay.

1429
01:20:18,726 --> 01:20:22,513
You're... You're okay.

1430
01:20:22,643 --> 01:20:24,167
I'm here.

1431
01:20:25,516 --> 01:20:26,822
We're here.

1432
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:32,871
It's over, Nick.

1433
01:20:49,192 --> 01:20:50,541
Finished.

1434
01:20:51,716 --> 01:20:53,109
And?

1435
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:54,850
I have questions.

1436
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:56,939
[Brody]
Okay. That's good.

1437
01:20:57,069 --> 01:20:59,115
Did you only yell, "Game over,"

1438
01:20:59,245 --> 01:21:00,551
so it could be the title
of the last chapter?

1439
01:21:00,681 --> 01:21:02,118
Totally.

1440
01:21:02,248 --> 01:21:04,381
And why didn't I get
to be in it anywhere?

1441
01:21:04,511 --> 01:21:05,948
I drove you to the finale.

1442
01:21:06,078 --> 01:21:08,385
Yeah, how did you get
there in the book?

1443
01:21:08,515 --> 01:21:10,517
He drives Ethan's Camaro.

1444
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:12,868
Hey, why didn't you
drive his Camaro there?

1445
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:16,654
I, um, maybe sort of don't
know how to drive a stick.

1446
01:21:16,784 --> 01:21:18,264
[door closes]

1447
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:20,701
Mm, mm, mm.

1448
01:21:20,832 --> 01:21:23,574
Somebody ordered Rudy's?

1449
01:21:23,704 --> 01:21:26,055
I'll get that for you.
Thank you.

1450
01:21:26,185 --> 01:21:27,752
[laughs]

1451
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:33,889
You're really gonna
miss this stuff

1452
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:35,325
while you're away at school.

1453
01:21:35,455 --> 01:21:36,892
Yeah, you were right
about these fries.

1454
01:21:37,022 --> 01:21:38,676
Better get some
before I take 'em all.

1455
01:21:38,806 --> 01:21:40,765
- [Natalie chuckles]
- And this is for you.

1456
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,027
Mm. Thanks,
Mrs. Ledbetter.

1457
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:43,246
You're quite welcome.

1458
01:21:43,376 --> 01:21:47,206
More like Ledbest.
Here you go.

1459
01:21:47,337 --> 01:21:50,253
Oh, thank you.

1460
01:21:51,863 --> 01:21:53,821
[ice clinking]

1461
01:21:59,131 --> 01:22:01,568
I'm not that drunk.

1462
01:22:02,787 --> 01:22:03,875
I know,

1463
01:22:04,006 --> 01:22:05,485
but it's good for you.

1464
01:22:07,487 --> 01:22:09,533
I'm sorry, Mom.

1465
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,318
I know,

1466
01:22:12,449 --> 01:22:15,321
and I love you no matter what.

1467
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:19,108
I love you, too,

1468
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:20,979
no matter what.

1469
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:31,033
[Brody]
Natalie.

1470
01:22:39,389 --> 01:22:40,651
You okay?

1471
01:22:45,177 --> 01:22:46,352
I am.

1472
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:54,665
