1
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:41,757
Sophie,

2
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:43,965
we closed the shop.
You've done enough work.

3
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,306
Why don't you come out
with us this time?

4
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,060
No, I better finish this.

5
00:01:48,187 --> 00:01:50,263
You go and have fun.

6
00:01:50,398 --> 00:01:52,640
All right, suit yourself.

7
00:01:52,775 --> 00:01:53,724
Let's go, girls.

8
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,852
- Wait for me!
- I'm ready.

9
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:58,394
- Do I look OK?
- It's Howl's castle!

10
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,990
- Where?
- Howl?

11
00:02:00,116 --> 00:02:02,867
I've never seen it close!

12
00:02:02,994 --> 00:02:05,449
Do you think
Howl will go into town?

13
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:13,670
He's gone.

14
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:16,501
No, he's just hiding
in the fog from those planes.

15
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:19,009
Did you hear
what happened to Martha?

16
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,011
They say Howl tore her heart out.

17
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,554
I'm scared to go out!

18
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,676
What?

19
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:26,016
Don't worry,
he only preys on pretty girls.

20
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,090
All right, let's go.

21
00:02:29,228 --> 00:02:33,308
- You girls are mean.
- It's not funny.

22
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:38,105
Hey. Looks like
a little mouse lost its way.

23
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,307
Oh, no, I'm not lost.

24
00:04:40,441 --> 00:04:42,315
This little mouse looks thirsty.

25
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,187
We should take her for a cup of tea.

26
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,194
No thanks, my sister's expecting me.

27
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:48,481
She's pretty cute for a mouse.

28
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:51,024
How old are you?
You live around here?

29
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,995
Leave me alone.

30
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:55,996
You see? Your moustache
scares all the girls.

31
00:04:56,123 --> 00:04:58,282
So? She's even cuter when she's scared.

32
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:02,958
There you are, sweetheart. Sorry
I'm late. I was looking everywhere.

33
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:03,919
Hey, we're busy here.

34
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:05,329
Are you really?

35
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:08,384
It looked to me like the
two of you were just leaving.

36
00:05:09,095 --> 00:05:10,423
Hup!

37
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:12,049
Hup!

38
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:14,423
Whoa! What? Hey!

39
00:05:16,102 --> 00:05:17,810
Don't hold it against them.

40
00:05:17,937 --> 00:05:20,013
They're actually not all that bad.

41
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:23,433
Where to?
I'll be your escort this evening.

42
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,975
Oh, I'm, um, just going to the bakery.

43
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,318
Don't get alarmed,
but I'm being followed.

44
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,107
Act normal.

45
00:05:50,803 --> 00:05:54,053
Sorry. Looks like you're involved..

46
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,226
This way.

47
00:06:06,109 --> 00:06:07,485
Hold on..

48
00:06:11,823 --> 00:06:15,193
Now, straighten your legs
and start walking.

49
00:06:19,873 --> 00:06:22,993
See? Not so hard, is it?

50
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,637
You are a natural.

51
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:56,238
I'll make sure to draw them off.

52
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,656
But wait a bit
before you head back outside.

53
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:00,661
OK.

54
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,031
That's my girl.

55
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,420
Excuse me, could we trouble
you for some more coffee?

56
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:17,013
- There you go.
- Do you have Lettie-shaped cookies?

57
00:07:17,013 --> 00:07:18,721
- I'd buy those.
- Here.

58
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:20,046
What time do you get off?

59
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:21,298
She what?

60
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:24,763
- I'm here, where're you going?
- Hey!

61
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:29,603
Sophie?

62
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,727
- Lettie.
- What's going on?

63
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,648
Someone just told me you
floated down onto our balcony.

64
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:37,605
So that did happen. It wasn't a dream.

65
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:40,031
Lettie, would you
like to use my office?

66
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:43,998
I should really get back to work.
Thank you, though.

67
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:48,459
Wow. He must have been a wizard, then.

68
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:50,460
But he was so kind to me.

69
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:53,209
He rescued me, Lettie.

70
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:56,295
Of course he did.
He was trying to steal your heart!

71
00:07:56,427 --> 00:07:58,669
You are so lucky, Sophie.

72
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,005
If that wizard were Howl,
he would have eaten it.

73
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,884
No, he wouldn't.

74
00:08:03,017 --> 00:08:05,010
Howl only does that to beautiful girls.

75
00:08:05,144 --> 00:08:06,935
Don't give me that.

76
00:08:07,063 --> 00:08:10,024
You need to be more careful.
It's dangerous out there.

77
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:14,318
Even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl.

78
00:08:14,403 --> 00:08:17,440
- Are you listening?
- Huh?

79
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,115
Ugh!

80
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,907
Lettie, the chocolate ¨¦clairs are done.

81
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,995
OK. I'll be right there.

82
00:08:26,082 --> 00:08:27,659
Thanks.

83
00:08:28,793 --> 00:08:30,536
All right. I better get going then.

84
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:33,243
I just wanted to make sure
that you were doing OK.

85
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:37,588
- Hello, Lettie.
- Hi, how are you doing?

86
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,632
Sophie, do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in that hat shop?

87
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:44,888
The shop was just
so important to Father.

88
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:46,595
And I'm the eldest, I don't mind.

89
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,969
I'm not asking what Father
would have wanted.

90
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:51,014
I want to know what you want.

91
00:08:51,148 --> 00:08:52,179
Well....

92
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:53,644
See you later, Lettie.

93
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,649
- Good seeing you again.
- You too.

94
00:08:55,778 --> 00:08:58,613
- I better be going.
- It's your life, Sophie.

95
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,230
- Do something for yourself for once.
- Bye, Lettie.

96
00:10:09,017 --> 00:10:10,974
I'm sorry,
but the shop's closed now, ma'am.

97
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:14,139
I could have sworn I locked
that door. Must have forgotten.

98
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:18,314
What a tacky shop.

99
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:21,071
I've never seen such tacky little hats.

100
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:25,279
Yet you're by far
the tackiest thing here.

101
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,698
I'm afraid you will have to leave now.

102
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:37,461
The door's over here, ma'am.
We're closed.

103
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:40,709
Standing up to the Witch of the Waste,

104
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,966
that's plucky.

105
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:45,051
The Witch of the Waste?

106
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:54,802
The best part of that spell
is you can't tell anyone about it.

107
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:58,437
My regards to Howl..

108
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,419
Oh... no.

109
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:25,175
Oh!

110
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:45,687
That's really me, isn't it?

111
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:48,027
I've got to stay calm.

112
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:06,673
I've got to stay calm!

113
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,959
Now, there's no use panicking, Sophie.

114
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:10,375
Oh!

115
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:12,090
It's a bad dream, that's all.

116
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,975
Just go inside, go to bed.

117
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,925
You're gonna be fine, Sophie.
You're gonna be fine.

118
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,388
Got to stay calm.

119
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:32,569
Look who's here!

120
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:35,488
- You're back!
- Look at you!

121
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,954
What do you think?
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

122
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:39,954
It's gorgeous!

123
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,417
I know! Our customers'll love it!
Sophie!

124
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,004
Sophie!

125
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,001
Your daughter
hasn't come downstairs yet today.

126
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,256
That's strange. I wonder what's wrong.

127
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,138
Sophie!

128
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,433
Sophie!

129
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,642
Sophie!

130
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:02,644
Don't come in here.

131
00:13:02,773 --> 00:13:04,895
I've got a bad cold.

132
00:13:05,025 --> 00:13:07,064
I don't want you to catch it.

133
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:11,776
You sound ghastly,
like some 90-year-old woman.

134
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:14,694
I'll just stay in bed
all day, so you go on.

135
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,368
Well....

136
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:17,739
If you insist.

137
00:13:19,623 --> 00:13:21,615
Up we go.

138
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:34,509
This isn't so bad, now, is it?

139
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:36,215
You're still in pretty good shape.

140
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:39,017
And your clothes finally suit you.

141
00:13:41,227 --> 00:13:43,932
But you can't stay here
like this for long.

142
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:59,074
Oh! Being old is worse than I thought.

143
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,249
They say their prince
is missing.

144
00:14:06,377 --> 00:14:08,037
And they're blaming us.

145
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:11,705
Yeah, and it sounds
like they're gonna start a war.

146
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,258
Nobody wants to go to war.

147
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:15,460
Let's hope
the prince turns up soon.

148
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:25,308
Excuse me, could you use some help?

149
00:14:25,438 --> 00:14:27,929
I'll be fine, but thanks for offering.

150
00:14:28,065 --> 00:14:29,607
That was really kind.

151
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:33,103
Sure, there's room in
back, but where are you headed?

152
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:36,024
Just a little ways farther
than where you're going.

153
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,995
You're crazy
if you do this, Grandma!

154
00:14:43,122 --> 00:14:45,743
There's nothing but witches
and wizards out there!

155
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:47,914
- Thank you.
- I'll keep that in mind.

156
00:14:48,043 --> 00:14:50,332
She's going
to the Wastes by herself?

157
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:52,918
She says she's looking
for her younger sister.

158
00:15:07,396 --> 00:15:10,017
I'll never get there with these legs.

159
00:15:11,734 --> 00:15:14,937
At least my teeth
haven't fallen out yet.

160
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:24,573
That would make a nice cane.

161
00:15:24,705 --> 00:15:26,329
Up we go.

162
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:29,292
Oh..

163
00:15:33,088 --> 00:15:35,007
Might be too big.

164
00:15:45,892 --> 00:15:47,969
This is one stubborn branch.

165
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:53,058
You're not getting
the best of this old lady.

166
00:15:59,865 --> 00:16:01,359
Oh!

167
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:06,995
Just a scarecrow!

168
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:09,791
I was afraid you were
one of those blob men.

169
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,917
But how're you standing
on your own like that?

170
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,330
You're head's a turnip.

171
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:21,000
I've always hated turnips,
ever since I was little.

172
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:24,006
At least you're not upside down now.

173
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,681
So long.

174
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:34,727
It's too cold.

175
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:37,645
And I can still see the town.
I've barely moved.

176
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:40,185
Hmm?

177
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,774
Go away! Quit following me!

178
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:47,780
There's no need to thank me,
you don't owe me a thing.

179
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,119
I'm sure you have
some kind of spell on you,

180
00:16:50,248 --> 00:16:53,083
and I've had more than enough
of witches and spells.

181
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,670
So, just go find some field
and stand in it!

182
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:20,358
Thank you, this cane is perfect,
it's just what I need.

183
00:17:20,486 --> 00:17:22,858
If you'd like to do me one more favor,

184
00:17:22,989 --> 00:17:25,444
you could run off
and find me a place to stay.

185
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:39,164
I seem to have become
quite cunning in my old age.

186
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,171
A battleship!

187
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,467
Oh!

188
00:17:53,602 --> 00:17:56,224
Why do you get so cold when you're old?

189
00:17:56,355 --> 00:18:00,732
I'm fatter than ever,
yet the wind blows right through me.

190
00:18:15,082 --> 00:18:19,791
Someone's got a fire going.
Maybe there's a cabin nearby.

191
00:18:39,106 --> 00:18:42,023
You turnip-head! That's Howl's castle!

192
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,100
That is not what I meant
when I asked for a place to stay.

193
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:00,158
Look at that. They call this a castle?

194
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,762
Ahh!

195
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,477
Is that the way in?

196
00:19:24,234 --> 00:19:26,523
Slow down!

197
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,937
For heaven's sake.

198
00:19:31,074 --> 00:19:34,573
Make up your mind.
Are you gonna let me on or not?

199
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:35,983
Whoa!

200
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,702
Oh, my shawl!

201
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:55,674
It's nice and warm in there,
so I'm going in.

202
00:19:55,807 --> 00:19:57,965
Oh, my shawl, thank you.

203
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:02,644
I'm sure Howl won't eat the heart
of a shriveled, old lady like me.

204
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,985
It's been a pleasure meeting you.

205
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,772
Even if you are
my least favorite vegetable.

206
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:12,360
Take care, Turnip-head.

207
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:44,303
Ahh.

208
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:56,696
There we go.

209
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:00,904
What a dump.

210
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:03,783
When I think castle,
this is not what I picture.

211
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:17,091
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is nothing frightens you.

212
00:21:26,188 --> 00:21:29,272
I don't envy you, lady.
That is one bad curse.

213
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:33,018
Curses are tough. You're gonna have
a hard time getting rid of that one.

214
00:21:33,946 --> 00:21:35,321
The fire spoke!

215
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,282
The curse won't allow you
to talk about it, right?

216
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:39,986
Are you Howl?

217
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:43,203
No, I'm an extremely powerful
fire demon named Calcifer.

218
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,998
I just like to do that once in a while.

219
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:49,791
A fire demon. Well, then you
should be able to break my curse.

220
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,035
Maybe, maybe not.

221
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:53,958
Listen, if you can find a way
to break the spell that's on me,

222
00:21:54,091 --> 00:21:56,795
then I'll break the spell
that's on you, you got it?

223
00:21:56,927 --> 00:21:59,928
If you're a demon,
how do I know I can trust you?

224
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:02,261
You promise to help me if I help you?

225
00:22:02,391 --> 00:22:06,471
I don't know, lady.
Demons don't make promises.

226
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:08,679
Then go find someone else.

227
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:10,605
Come on!
You should feel sorry for me!

228
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,689
That spell keeps me stuck
in this castle,

229
00:22:12,818 --> 00:22:14,691
and Howl treats me like I'm his slave.

230
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:17,393
It burns me up. Got to keep
the water hot, the rooms warm.

231
00:22:17,531 --> 00:22:19,689
- keep the castle moving.
- Oh, that's rough.

232
00:22:19,825 --> 00:22:21,698
You ever try to move a castle?

233
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:24,781
If you can figure out how
to break this thing I'm in with Howl,

234
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,241
then you can break my spell.

235
00:22:26,373 --> 00:22:29,742
After that, I can easily
break the spell that's on you.

236
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:33,334
All right, it's a deal.

237
00:22:35,006 --> 00:22:37,758
Hey, lady? Lady?

238
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,167
Hello? Lady? Hello? Hey, hey!

239
00:22:41,304 --> 00:22:43,380
Lady? Lady?

240
00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:46,302
Hey, let me get over there.

241
00:22:46,434 --> 00:22:48,474
Some big help you're gonna be.

242
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:44,322
Hey, who's this lady?

243
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,119
- Porthaven door.
- How'd she get in here?

244
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,958
Stand by.

245
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:03,127
Mr. Mayor, good day.

246
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,014
Good afternoon, sir. Would the
great Wizard Jenkins be at home?

247
00:24:07,014 --> 00:24:09,552
I am afraid that
my master is out at the moment.

248
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:12,019
I speak for him in his absence.

249
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:14,937
An invitation from His Majesty the King.

250
00:24:15,064 --> 00:24:16,891
The time for war is upon us.

251
00:24:17,024 --> 00:24:21,485
His Majesty requires that every witch
and wizard aid our homeland.

252
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,945
Wizard Jenkins must report
to the palace immediately.

253
00:24:25,074 --> 00:24:27,031
- That is all.
- War....

254
00:24:28,327 --> 00:24:30,450
I can't believe it's come to this.

255
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:33,284
And what do you think
you're doing here, Grandma?

256
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:35,324
Calcifer said that I could come in.

257
00:24:35,459 --> 00:24:38,994
I did not. She just wandered
in here from the Wastes.

258
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:42,007
She's from the Wastes?

259
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:43,967
How do we know that she's not a witch?

260
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:45,969
Do you think I'd let a witch in here?

261
00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:49,255
Porthaven door again!

262
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,429
Must be a customer.

263
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,768
Stand by.

264
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,231
Yes, my dear child?

265
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:01,350
My mom sent me to pick up a spell.

266
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,521
- Ah, yes, do come in.
- OK.

267
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:08,443
Just keep quiet and don't
cause any trouble, Grandma.

268
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:25,958
It's not the Wastes.

269
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:29,757
Excuse me, Granny, are you a witch too?

270
00:25:29,888 --> 00:25:32,972
That's right.
I'm the scariest witch of them all.

271
00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:37,429
Dust your ship with this powder
and the winds will favor it.

272
00:25:37,562 --> 00:25:39,187
Thanks.

273
00:25:40,857 --> 00:25:42,482
Farewell, child.

274
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,648
Quit telling
lies to our customers.

275
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,903
What about you?
You're wearing a disguise.

276
00:25:49,032 --> 00:25:50,775
I have to. I'm practicing my magic.

277
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:52,948
Hmm?

278
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:55,366
It's the Kingsbury door!

279
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,028
Stand by.

280
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:05,666
Would this be the residence
of the great Wizard Pendragon?

281
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:06,997
It is.

282
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,592
I bear an invitation

283
00:26:08,718 --> 00:26:09,916
from His Majesty the King.

284
00:26:10,053 --> 00:26:12,970
Please inform Mr. Pendragon
that all witches and wizards

285
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:15,386
are required to report
for duty at the palace.

286
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:18,268
I will inform him right away.

287
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,615
This is the royal city, isn't it?

288
00:26:35,745 --> 00:26:38,829
Move it, Grandma,
or you'll lose your nose.

289
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,624
And stop wandering around!

290
00:27:22,124 --> 00:27:25,458
- Leave it alone, Grandma.
- I'm getting angry.

291
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,460
This is a magic house, isn't it?

292
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:28,619
Oh!

293
00:27:28,756 --> 00:27:30,962
So, tell me, where
does the black one lead?

294
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,716
Only Master Howl knows that.

295
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:35,879
I need some breakfast. I'm starved.

296
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,270
Don't you want to have
some bacon and eggs?

297
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:51,978
Yeah, but we can't use the fire.
Master Howl's not here.

298
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,029
Don't worry, I can cook.

299
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,026
- It doesn't matter.
- Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

300
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,736
That's right, lady.
I'm not taking orders from you.

301
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,960
Oh, there's my hat.

302
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:10,753
That's better.

303
00:28:10,881 --> 00:28:13,798
All right, Calcifer. Let's get cooking.

304
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:17,211
I don't cook!
I'm a scary and powerful fire demon!

305
00:28:19,139 --> 00:28:22,140
How would you like a bucket
of cold water in your face?

306
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:25,766
Or maybe I should
tell Howl about our bargain?

307
00:28:25,896 --> 00:28:27,935
Oh! Stupid me!

308
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:30,852
I never should have let her in here.

309
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,478
So, what'll it be?

310
00:28:36,156 --> 00:28:39,110
That's right. That's a good fire.

311
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,407
Here's another curse.
May all your bacon burn.

312
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:46,828
Calcifer's doing what she says.

313
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,745
I think I'd like some
tea too. Do you have a kettle?

314
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,917
- Sure.
- Hey, what are you doing?

315
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:55,920
Don't get the kettle! Who's side are you
on, anyway? Markl, what are you doing?

316
00:28:56,051 --> 00:28:57,842
Huh?

317
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,717
Master Howl,
the king's messengers were here.

318
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,806
They said you have
to report to the palace

319
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:07,604
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

320
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:19,029
Calcifer?

321
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,031
You're being so obedient.

322
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,032
Not on purpose. She bullied me.

323
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,327
Not just anybody can do that.

324
00:29:26,456 --> 00:29:28,329
And you are... who?

325
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:31,661
Uh, you can just call me Grandma Sophie.

326
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:34,326
I'm your new cleaning lady.
I just started work today.

327
00:29:34,464 --> 00:29:35,922
Give that to me.

328
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:37,507
Oh!

329
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:43,093
Hand me two more slices of that bacon
and six more of those eggs.

330
00:29:56,402 --> 00:30:00,316
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

331
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,449
Mmm.

332
00:30:03,576 --> 00:30:06,363
Yummy. Mmmm.

333
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:15,993
So, then, who hired you to clean?

334
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,968
Uh, Calcifer did. He's disgusted
by how dirty it is in here.

335
00:30:20,968 --> 00:30:22,462
Hmm.

336
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:25,050
Markl, get the plates.

337
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:30,842
Wait a second, you're all gonna eat
while I do all the work?

338
00:30:30,978 --> 00:30:33,433
Come have some breakfast,
Sophie.

339
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:39,983
Take a seat.

340
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,821
Hmm.

341
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:55,495
Which do you want?

342
00:30:55,627 --> 00:30:58,035
You only get one
'cause the rest are dirty.

343
00:31:00,674 --> 00:31:03,046
Looks like I've got
my work cut out for me.

344
00:31:05,012 --> 00:31:07,503
- Bread, Markl?
- Thanks.

345
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:11,471
- Sophie?
- Yes, thank you.

346
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:16,768
- So, friends, enjoy. Bon app¨¦tit.
- Bon app¨¦tit.

347
00:31:16,898 --> 00:31:19,389
I can't remember the last time
we had a real breakfast.

348
00:31:26,033 --> 00:31:29,567
Even the manners
are a mess in this house.

349
00:31:29,703 --> 00:31:32,988
So, what do you have hidden
in your pocket, Sophie?

350
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:35,696
Huh? Oh....

351
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,133
- What is this?
- Give it to me.

352
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,210
Hmm.

353
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:49,175
Oh!

354
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:55,971
- Scorch marks.
- Howl, can you read them?

355
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:58,346
That is ancient sorcery.

356
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,059
And quite powerful too.

357
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,985
It's from the Witch of the Waste?

358
00:32:01,985 --> 00:32:04,902
"You who swallowed a falling star,

359
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:08,778
oh, heartless man,
your heart shall soon belong to me."

360
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:10,782
That can't be good for the table.

361
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:26,041
Wow! It's gone!

362
00:32:26,175 --> 00:32:28,970
The mark may be gone,
but the spell is still there.

363
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,884
Excuse me, my friends,
please continue your meal.

364
00:32:33,015 --> 00:32:36,266
Calcifer, move the castle
60 miles to the west.

365
00:32:40,982 --> 00:32:44,148
And while you're at it,
make hot water for my bath.

366
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:47,396
Fine. Like moving
the castle isn't hard enough?

367
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,021
You're not working for
the Witch of the Waste, are you?

368
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:53,032
I would never work for that witch!

369
00:32:53,161 --> 00:32:55,367
She's the one who....

370
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:01,621
I'm actually a... yuh... yuh....

371
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,298
If I ever get my hands on that witch,
I'm going to wring her fat neck!

372
00:33:10,428 --> 00:33:13,843
Finish your breakfast!

373
00:33:16,017 --> 00:33:18,009
I've had enough of this!

374
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,974
You bugs better run
before I bite your heads off!

375
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:26,436
I'm sick of being treated
like some timid little old lady.

376
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,154
Hello, sir, is my potion ready?

377
00:33:33,284 --> 00:33:34,861
Come back later.

378
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:36,951
There's a witch on a rampage in there.

379
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:46,337
Sophie, please!

380
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:48,954
Sophie! Please help me! I'm going out!

381
00:33:50,009 --> 00:33:53,508
Please, get me some firewood, quick!

382
00:33:53,637 --> 00:33:57,057
Hey, please help me.
Wait, what are you doing?

383
00:33:57,057 --> 00:33:59,215
Don't! I'll fall!
You crazy lady with tongs!

384
00:33:59,351 --> 00:34:01,723
- You'll be fine.
- I'll fall! Help!

385
00:34:01,854 --> 00:34:03,312
I'm just sweeping out the ashes.

386
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:06,558
No, I'm not fine!  Please!

387
00:34:06,692 --> 00:34:08,435
I'm going out!

388
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:11,981
Please. I'm falling.

389
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:16,826
Help! I'm falling!

390
00:34:19,871 --> 00:34:21,947
Sophie, hurry up, please.

391
00:34:22,082 --> 00:34:24,999
Hurry, please. P.. P....

392
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:28,212
Whoa!

393
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:50,060
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't torment my friend.

394
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,943
Master Howl, are you going out now?

395
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:04,655
Markl, make sure the cleaning lady
doesn't get carried away while I'm gone.

396
00:35:09,254 --> 00:35:11,293
Sophie, what did you do now?

397
00:35:11,423 --> 00:35:13,878
She almost smothered me!

398
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:17,011
If I die, Howl dies too,
I hope you know.

399
00:35:17,011 --> 00:35:19,337
Oh, be quiet. You're all right.

400
00:35:19,472 --> 00:35:21,465
Now quit bothering me,
I've got a job to do.

401
00:35:22,392 --> 00:35:25,061
Wait, you can't come up here!

402
00:35:25,186 --> 00:35:28,637
Whatever you don't want me
to clean, better hide it now.

403
00:35:28,773 --> 00:35:31,893
Save my room for last, OK?

404
00:35:35,321 --> 00:35:37,943
These little outbursts seem
to be giving me some energy.

405
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,446
What a mess.

406
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,040
Oh!

407
00:36:01,013 --> 00:36:02,555
Oh!

408
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,907
Incredible!

409
00:36:22,034 --> 00:36:24,359
Calcifer! Calcifer!

410
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:26,487
Are you the one
moving the castle?

411
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:29,327
Of course. No one
else does any work around here.

412
00:36:29,458 --> 00:36:30,952
I am thoroughly impressed!

413
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:34,999
You are a first-class fire demon.
I like your spark.

414
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:40,795
She likes my spark! Ha-ha!

415
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,933
Ah! Not ready! Not ready!

416
00:37:21,093 --> 00:37:22,836
It's beautiful.

417
00:37:22,969 --> 00:37:25,342
Yeah. It's called Star Lake.

418
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:31,802
Hey, what's that stick doing in there?

419
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:36,314
Oh, dear. Give me a hand, Markl.

420
00:37:43,031 --> 00:37:44,573
It's a scarecrow.

421
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,906
Yep, I've been calling him Turnip-head.

422
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:49,906
Somehow he always manages
to get stuck upside down.

423
00:37:58,588 --> 00:38:00,830
He keeps following me everywhere.

424
00:38:00,965 --> 00:38:03,005
Seems to have taken a liking to me.

425
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:05,590
That's weird. Are you sure
you're not a witch, Sophie?

426
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,552
Oh, yes! I'm the worst kind
of witch ever, the kind that cleans.

427
00:38:38,378 --> 00:38:41,628
Quit pulling so hard, Turnip-head!

428
00:38:50,973 --> 00:38:53,013
I think he likes doing the laundry.

429
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:56,641
Looks like he'll have it dry in no time.

430
00:38:57,855 --> 00:39:00,014
I bet he's some kind of demon.

431
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:02,023
Calcifer doesn't seem
to mind him at all.

432
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:06,231
You're right. He probably is a demon.

433
00:39:06,364 --> 00:39:09,946
But he led me here,
so maybe he's the good kind.

434
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:54,073
We got all the laundry put away, Sophie.

435
00:39:54,203 --> 00:39:55,780
Oh, thank you, Markl.

436
00:39:55,913 --> 00:40:00,290
When you're old, all you want
to do is stare at the scenery.

437
00:40:00,417 --> 00:40:04,497
It's so strange,
I've never felt so peaceful before.

438
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:24,000
Whew.

439
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,286
You OK? I mean, you smell terrible.

440
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,886
You shouldn't keep
flying around like that.

441
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:50,269
Soon you won't be able
to turn back into a human.

442
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,405
Isn't this great?

443
00:41:55,531 --> 00:41:57,156
Sophie put these here for me.

444
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:01,328
This war is terrible.

445
00:42:01,454 --> 00:42:04,371
They've bombed from the southern
coast to the northern border.

446
00:42:04,499 --> 00:42:05,993
It's all in flames now.

447
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,533
I can't stand the fire in gunpowder.

448
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:11,504
Those dopey guys
have absolutely no manners.

449
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:15,498
- My own kind attacked me today.
- Who, the Witch of the Waste?

450
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:19,217
No, some hack wizards who turned
themselves into monsters for the king.

451
00:42:19,305 --> 00:42:22,425
Those wizards are going
to regret doing that.

452
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:25,014
They'll never change back into humans.

453
00:42:25,144 --> 00:42:28,061
After the war, they won't
recall they ever were human.

454
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:31,143
Hey, aren't you supposed
to report to the king too?

455
00:42:31,275 --> 00:42:34,478
I'm tired.
Make some hot water for my bath.

456
00:42:34,612 --> 00:42:36,688
What? Not again.

457
00:43:09,146 --> 00:43:10,474
Is Howl back?

458
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:13,275
Yes. He's wasting
all my hot water again.

459
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:19,855
I don't know
why we're doing this.

460
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:22,695
- Master Howl hardly eats.
- Too bad.

461
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:24,907
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

462
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,374
Don't you love early morning markets?
And just look at the water!

463
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:34,419
I've never seen
the ocean before! It's beautiful!

464
00:43:34,546 --> 00:43:36,171
It always looks like that.

465
00:43:45,098 --> 00:43:47,091
Hmm, I hate potatoes.

466
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:48,559
Pay up.

467
00:43:48,685 --> 00:43:51,437
- Thanks, have a nice day.
- Come again.

468
00:43:53,023 --> 00:43:55,893
All our fish
were caught fresh this morning.

469
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,275
Hmm, I hate fish.

470
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:01,278
One of our ships
is in the harbor!

471
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,900
It looks like it's on fire!

472
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:05,025
Looks like there's
been a serious battle.

473
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,829
What happened?
Sorry, lady, we're closed.

474
00:44:07,954 --> 00:44:09,532
The ship, it's sinking!

475
00:44:32,187 --> 00:44:34,096
Come on, Sophie,
let's get a better look.

476
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:37,931
No, I've seen all I can take.
Let's go home.

477
00:44:38,067 --> 00:44:40,938
I can't believe it.
It's our most advanced battleship.

478
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:47,069
The witch's henchmen are here.

479
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:49,241
- What?
- Quiet down.

480
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,944
They're only a few feet away.

481
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,539
He's gone.

482
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,341
I don't understand why
no one else seemed to notice him.

483
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,973
Look! There they are!

484
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:10,930
That plane!
That's what dropped the bombs!

485
00:45:11,058 --> 00:45:13,016
Look, Sophie. It's the enemy's airship!

486
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:20,857
Sophie! Wait up! Sophie!

487
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:23,648
- Ignore the flyers.
- They're enemy propaganda.

488
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:30,403
Sophie, are you OK?

489
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,540
I just need a glass of water.

490
00:45:38,669 --> 00:45:40,211
I'll get it.

491
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:58,513
Sophie! You sabotaged me! Look!

492
00:45:58,647 --> 00:46:00,225
Look what you've done to my hair!

493
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,984
Look!

494
00:46:01,984 --> 00:46:04,819
- What a pretty color.
- It's hideous!

495
00:46:04,903 --> 00:46:08,319
You completely ruined my
magic potions in the bathroom!

496
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,035
I just organized things,
Howl, nothing's ruined.

497
00:46:12,161 --> 00:46:13,996
Wrong! Wrong!

498
00:46:13,996 --> 00:46:17,863
I specifically ordered you
not to get carried away!

499
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,328
Now I'm repulsive.

500
00:46:19,459 --> 00:46:22,829
I can't live like this.

501
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:26,289
Come on, it's not that bad.

502
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:36,934
You should look at it now.
This shade is even better.

503
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,934
I give up.

504
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:41,933
I see no point in living
if I can't be beautiful.

505
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:56,405
Howl, cut it out. Howl, no, stop it.

506
00:46:56,538 --> 00:46:58,531
He's calling the Spirits of Darkness.

507
00:46:58,665 --> 00:47:02,449
I saw him do this once before
when a girl dumped him.

508
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:07,377
Now, Howl, you're all right.

509
00:47:07,507 --> 00:47:09,963
We'll just dye your hair back again.

510
00:47:10,093 --> 00:47:13,213
OK? Oh!

511
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,763
Fine! So, you think you've got it bad?

512
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:26,983
I've never once been
beautiful in my entire life!

513
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,359
I've had enough of this place!

514
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:11,728
Thank you, Turnip-head.

515
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:13,813
How did you get to be so kind?

516
00:48:13,948 --> 00:48:16,984
Sophie, get back inside,
we need your help! Howl's in trouble!

517
00:48:17,118 --> 00:48:19,324
Howl, cut it out! I'm gonna drown!

518
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:22,988
I'm drowning here, Howl.
Sophie! Sophie, help him, please!

519
00:48:23,124 --> 00:48:25,449
Sophie! Do something!

520
00:48:27,086 --> 00:48:29,921
- Such drama.
- Is he dead?

521
00:48:30,047 --> 00:48:32,965
No, he's fine.
He's just throwing a tantrum.

522
00:48:33,092 --> 00:48:36,011
- Come on. Give me a hand.
- OK.

523
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:41,056
Get the hot water running.

524
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:42,304
Right.

525
00:48:42,435 --> 00:48:44,973
Come on, Howl, you can still walk.

526
00:48:56,198 --> 00:48:57,990
Get him cleaned up, Markl.

527
00:48:58,117 --> 00:48:59,611
I will.

528
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:03,112
Now I have to mop again.

529
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:14,497
This says they've landed
on the coast already.

530
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:15,831
- Where?
- North.

531
00:49:26,019 --> 00:49:28,593
Howl, I'm coming in.

532
00:49:36,029 --> 00:49:38,983
I brought you some warm milk.
Want a sip?

533
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:43,362
I'll leave it here for you, then.

534
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:46,366
Try to drink it before it gets cold.

535
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:51,408
Sophie, wait.

536
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:00,926
Do you want some milk?

537
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:14,221
The Witch of the Waste
is trying to find my castle.

538
00:50:15,402 --> 00:50:18,989
I saw her
henchmen at the harbor.

539
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,943
I am such a big coward,
all I do is hide.

540
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:25,658
And all of this magic
is just to keep everybody away.

541
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:27,827
I can't stand how scared I am.

542
00:50:29,332 --> 00:50:32,748
Howl, why is the Witch of the
Waste trying to hunt you down?

543
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:37,005
She was once quite beautiful,
so I decided to pursue her.

544
00:50:37,132 --> 00:50:39,124
Then I realized she wasn't.

545
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:41,216
So as usual, I ran away.

546
00:50:43,596 --> 00:50:46,930
I can't run much longer, though.
I have to report to the palace

547
00:50:47,058 --> 00:50:49,763
as both Pendragon and Jenkins.

548
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:52,136
How many aliases do you have, anyway?

549
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:54,727
As many as I need to keep my freedom.

550
00:50:54,857 --> 00:50:56,055
Hmm.

551
00:50:56,192 --> 00:51:00,024
- Just refuse the king's invitation.
- See that?

552
00:51:00,154 --> 00:51:03,654
That's the oath I took when
I entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

553
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:06,867
I must report to the
palace whenever summoned.

554
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:09,746
You know, Howl, I think
that you should see the king.

555
00:51:09,872 --> 00:51:11,746
What?

556
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:13,499
Give him a piece of your mind.

557
00:51:13,626 --> 00:51:15,535
Tell him this war is pointless.

558
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:17,579
And you refuse to take part, huh?

559
00:51:19,549 --> 00:51:22,419
You obviously don't know
what these people are like.

560
00:51:22,552 --> 00:51:24,425
But he's our king.

561
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:28,337
He should want to hear what
all his citizens have to say.

562
00:51:28,474 --> 00:51:29,976
I got it!

563
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:32,348
Why don't you go to the palace for me?

564
00:51:32,478 --> 00:51:33,937
Huh?

565
00:51:34,063 --> 00:51:36,471
Just say that you're Pen dragon's mother,

566
00:51:36,607 --> 00:51:38,434
and your son
is such a cowardly wizard,

567
00:51:38,567 --> 00:51:40,359
he's too afraid to show his face.

568
00:51:40,486 --> 00:51:43,357
Maybe then Madame Suliman
will finally give up on me.

569
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:46,062
Who's Madame Suliman?

570
00:51:48,828 --> 00:51:50,452
You're wearing that hat?

571
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:52,957
After all the magic I used
to make your dress pretty?

572
00:51:52,957 --> 00:51:56,373
- Take care of him, Markl.
- Mm-hmm.

573
00:51:56,502 --> 00:51:58,744
Good luck.

574
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,754
This charm will
guarantee your safe return.

575
00:52:10,182 --> 00:52:13,516
Don't worry.
I'll follow behind you in disguise.

576
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:15,352
Now. Off you go.

577
00:52:23,112 --> 00:52:26,278
Why do I feel like
this is not going to work?

578
00:52:34,164 --> 00:52:38,244
I wonder what Howl disguised
himself as. Surely not a crow.

579
00:52:44,716 --> 00:52:47,551
Can't be a pigeon,
he's too flamboyant for that.

580
00:52:52,849 --> 00:52:55,091
That could be him.

581
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:09,773
Look how far I still have to go.

582
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:21,626
Come on! Step right up!

583
00:53:51,032 --> 00:53:54,366
Howl? You disguised
yourself as an old dog?

584
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:02,953
You couldn't think
of something a bit more useful?

585
00:54:03,086 --> 00:54:05,707
Do you know how hard it is
to do things when you're old?

586
00:54:07,965 --> 00:54:09,792
Look who's here.

587
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:12,011
The tacky little girl from the hat shop.

588
00:54:12,011 --> 00:54:13,755
The Witch of the Waste.

589
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:17,091
Thank you for handing
my scorching love note to Howl.

590
00:54:19,185 --> 00:54:21,474
How's he doing, by the way?

591
00:54:21,604 --> 00:54:23,229
He's acting like a big baby.

592
00:54:23,356 --> 00:54:26,357
And he's working me
to the bone as his cleaning lady.

593
00:54:26,484 --> 00:54:29,983
How delightful.

594
00:54:30,112 --> 00:54:34,241
So, tell me, what business
do you have here at the palace?

595
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:37,071
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

596
00:54:37,203 --> 00:54:38,994
And what about yourself?

597
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,957
I received a royal invitation.

598
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:46,994
That idiot Suliman finally realized
how much she needs my powers.

599
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:50,545
If you're so great, why don't
you break the spell you put on me?

600
00:54:50,675 --> 00:54:52,169
I'm sorry, dear.

601
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:56,506
My talent lies in casting spells,
not breaking them.

602
00:54:56,639 --> 00:54:58,596
Bye, Granny.

603
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,976
Now, just wait a minute!

604
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:03,811
You get back here right now!

605
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:06,974
If I didn't have you to worry about,
I would have clobbered her.

606
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:26,285
What on earth is wrong with you two?

607
00:55:26,377 --> 00:55:29,828
Sorry, ma'am. Vehicles
are prohibited beyond this point.

608
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:31,707
You must continue on foot.

609
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,085
That Suliman.

610
00:55:33,217 --> 00:55:37,464
Using her magic to force me
to climb all those god-forsaken stairs.

611
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:50,023
Come on, Howl.

612
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,021
We can do this, just act natural.

613
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:04,579
Oh!

614
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:19,214
Howl, why are you so heavy?

615
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:32,972
Wait. Help. I can't make it.

616
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:35,268
What'd you say?

617
00:56:35,403 --> 00:56:38,986
You suddenly remembered how
to break the spell you put on me?

618
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:40,989
I told you.

619
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:43,988
I don't know how..

620
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,113
Then start studying.

621
00:56:51,044 --> 00:56:53,001
I don't get it.

622
00:56:53,129 --> 00:56:55,916
Where does she get all that energy?

623
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:05,975
I have to rest a bit.

624
00:57:12,315 --> 00:57:15,269
Why don't you just give up?

625
00:57:15,401 --> 00:57:16,682
You're killing yourself.

626
00:57:16,778 --> 00:57:18,735
I've waited....

627
00:57:18,863 --> 00:57:22,232
...for 50 years now to be invited here.

628
00:57:22,367 --> 00:57:24,952
Ever since that Suliman....

629
00:57:24,952 --> 00:57:27,241
...banished me to live in the Wastes.

630
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:28,949
Well, good luck, then.

631
00:57:29,081 --> 00:57:32,830
Too bad I'm not younger,
or I'd lend you a hand.

632
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,752
Come on, Howl.

633
00:57:35,797 --> 00:57:38,007
You cold-hearted old hag.

634
00:57:38,007 --> 00:57:40,676
Next time, I'll turn you senile too.

635
00:58:01,697 --> 00:58:04,069
Almost there!

636
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,904
Honored guest, please follow me.

637
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:09,609
You should go help her
get up these stairs.

638
00:58:09,747 --> 00:58:12,913
I am strictly forbidden
to offer such assistance.

639
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:16,411
That's so rude.
The King himself invited her.

640
00:58:16,545 --> 00:58:18,953
Come on! Let's go!

641
00:58:20,007 --> 00:58:21,418
Don't give up now!

642
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,459
Are you a witch or aren't you?

643
00:58:25,554 --> 00:58:27,677
Just shut up.

644
00:58:29,975 --> 00:58:31,968
What happened? You look so much older.

645
00:58:32,603 --> 00:58:36,185
Mrs. Pendragon
and the Witch of the Waste!

646
00:58:38,108 --> 00:58:42,058
- Pull yourself together.
- Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

647
00:58:45,073 --> 00:58:48,442
Mrs. Pendragon
and the Witch of the Waste!

648
00:58:48,535 --> 00:58:50,492
Your name's Pendragon?

649
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:52,412
Why does that name sound so familiar?

650
00:58:52,539 --> 00:58:55,113
Uh, because that was
the name of my tacky hat shop.

651
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,003
- don't you remember?
- Is that what it was?

652
00:58:58,003 --> 00:59:00,920
Wait in here, please.

653
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:10,553
A chair! It's mine!

654
00:59:21,276 --> 00:59:24,111
Howl, get back here.

655
00:59:30,118 --> 00:59:31,067
Oh!

656
00:59:31,828 --> 00:59:33,536
This way please, ma'am.

657
00:59:41,087 --> 00:59:43,044
Huh?

658
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:14,275
Thank you, Madame Suliman.

659
01:00:14,412 --> 01:00:16,369
Madame Suliman.

660
01:00:33,723 --> 01:00:35,965
So, you are Howl's mother, are you?

661
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,971
Yes, I'm Mrs. Pendragon.

662
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:41,974
You must be tired. Please have a seat.

663
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:43,684
Thank you.

664
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:56,943
I am Madame Suliman,
His Majesty's head sorceress.

665
01:00:57,079 --> 01:00:58,989
Hmm.

666
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,454
That's not your dog, is it?

667
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:08,252
His name is Heen. He's my errand dog.

668
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:10,256
I had him escort you here.

669
01:01:12,094 --> 01:01:13,885
Oh.

670
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:16,930
I take it Howl won't be joining us?

671
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,935
He's such a lazy son,
he sent me instead.

672
01:01:21,061 --> 01:01:24,347
I'm afraid the king would
find him completely useless.

673
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:27,938
I am very sorry to hear that.

674
01:01:28,068 --> 01:01:32,232
Howl was the last apprentice
I ever took on.

675
01:01:32,364 --> 01:01:35,449
I'd never seen such a gifted student.

676
01:01:35,534 --> 01:01:37,942
I was so thrilled
to have finally found someone

677
01:01:38,078 --> 01:01:40,616
talented enough to replace me.

678
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:44,542
Then, one day,
his heart was stolen by a demon.

679
01:01:44,668 --> 01:01:46,993
He never returned
to complete his apprenticeship.

680
01:01:47,129 --> 01:01:48,374
And from that day forward,

681
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:52,005
he has been using his magic
for entirely selfish reasons.

682
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,552
- Mrs. Pendragon.
- Yes?

683
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,802
That boy is extremely dangerous.

684
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:00,802
His powers are far too great
for someone without a heart.

685
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:07,147
If he stays selfish, I'm afraid he'll
end up just like the Witch of the Waste.

686
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:08,389
Send her in.

687
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,572
What on earth happened to you?

688
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,410
I just restored her
to the age she actually is.

689
01:02:21,538 --> 01:02:23,495
All her powers are gone now.

690
01:02:23,623 --> 01:02:27,917
Once, she, too, was a magnificent
sorcerer with so much promise.

691
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:31,006
But then she fell prey
to a demon of greed

692
01:02:31,006 --> 01:02:34,624
who slowly consumed her, body and soul.

693
01:02:34,759 --> 01:02:37,630
Our kingdom can no longer
afford to turn a blind eye

694
01:02:37,762 --> 01:02:40,170
to these disreputable
witches and wizards.

695
01:02:40,307 --> 01:02:44,553
If Howl reports to me and vows
to use his magic to serve the kingdom.

696
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:47,177
I will show him
how to break from his demon.

697
01:02:47,313 --> 01:02:51,607
If not, I'll strip him
of all his powers. Just like her.

698
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,727
That is enough!

699
01:02:54,863 --> 01:02:58,397
Now I understand why Howl was
so concerned about coming to see you.

700
01:02:58,533 --> 01:03:00,075
It's a trap.

701
01:03:00,201 --> 01:03:03,286
You lure people here
with an invitation from the king,

702
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:06,248
and then you strip them
of all their powers.

703
01:03:06,332 --> 01:03:08,408
Howl would never be so heartless.

704
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:10,500
He may be selfish and cowardly,

705
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:12,751
and sometimes he's hard to understand,

706
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:16,249
but his intentions are good.
He just wants to be free.

707
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:19,301
Howl won't come here.
He doesn't need your help.

708
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,920
He can fix his problem
with his demon on his own.

709
01:03:22,015 --> 01:03:24,256
I am certain of it.

710
01:03:24,392 --> 01:03:27,595
Now I understand.
You're in love with Howl.

711
01:03:27,729 --> 01:03:29,389
Howl?

712
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:31,479
Did you say Howl's coming?

713
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,608
I want his heart,
his heart belongs to me!

714
01:03:34,694 --> 01:03:36,686
Stop that, just calm down.

715
01:03:36,821 --> 01:03:38,695
Howl is not coming here, OK?

716
01:03:39,907 --> 01:03:42,030
Oh, I think he will.

717
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,537
I now know his weakness, Mrs. Pendragon.

718
01:03:52,169 --> 01:03:55,005
- Your Majesty.
- As you were.

719
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:56,839
So, then, how are you feeling?

720
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,590
I'm fine, thank you.

721
01:03:58,718 --> 01:04:01,968
Thought I'd drop by, rather than
sit through a dull war meeting.

722
01:04:02,054 --> 01:04:05,470
- What an honor.
- Who are your guests?

723
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,935
This is Howl's mother, Mrs. Pendragon.

724
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,726
Ah.

725
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:14,685
Thanks for coming.

726
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:17,901
But I've decided not
to use magic to win this war.

727
01:04:18,028 --> 01:04:20,519
We have tried using
Madame Suliman's magic

728
01:04:20,656 --> 01:04:22,898
to shield our palace
from the enemy's bombs.

729
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:25,655
But the bombs fall
on civilian homes instead.

730
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:28,657
That's the problem with magic.
Right, Suliman?

731
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:30,912
You're so eloquent today, Your Majesty.

732
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:32,535
Suliman!

733
01:04:35,212 --> 01:04:36,920
I've got a new battle plan.

734
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,585
This time we're going
to beat them to a pulp.

735
01:04:39,717 --> 01:04:42,124
Um....

736
01:04:42,261 --> 01:04:44,930
Suliman, that's the best double
you've made of me yet.

737
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:46,721
Ha! Keep up the good work.

738
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:47,880
Your Majesty.

739
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:51,136
- Get my generals assembled.
- Sir.

740
01:04:53,981 --> 01:04:56,982
So nice to see you again, Howl.

741
01:04:57,109 --> 01:04:59,397
You're looking well,
Madame Suliman.

742
01:04:59,528 --> 01:05:01,900
Rather weak disguise.
Didn't I teach you better?

743
01:05:02,030 --> 01:05:03,822
I'm not trying to outwit you.

744
01:05:03,949 --> 01:05:06,522
I kept my oath,
I reported when summoned.

745
01:05:06,660 --> 01:05:08,403
Now Mother and I will go.

746
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:10,446
I'm afraid not.

747
01:05:30,892 --> 01:05:33,979
Whatever you do, don't look down.

748
01:05:33,979 --> 01:05:38,308
It's time to show your mother
what you really are, Howl.

749
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:23,314
Oh!

750
01:06:31,828 --> 01:06:34,579
Stop, Howl, it's a trap!

751
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:48,214
Hold on.

752
01:06:56,185 --> 01:06:59,637
Sophie, sit up here.

753
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:02,684
Did you have to bring
those two with you?

754
01:07:04,527 --> 01:07:06,899
Nice doggie..

755
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:10,979
Hmm. I can't believe
you work for Suliman.

756
01:07:11,117 --> 01:07:12,990
I guess it's too late to toss him.

757
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:14,696
Sophie. Take the wheel.

758
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:17,070
- What?
- I can't fly, are you kidding?

759
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:18,997
They're gaining on us.

760
01:07:23,546 --> 01:07:27,294
I'll distract them, then you can
fly back to my castle in the Wastes.

761
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:28,968
How? I don't know the way.

762
01:07:28,968 --> 01:07:32,171
Hey, don't worry. The ring that
I gave you will guide you back home.

763
01:07:32,304 --> 01:07:34,932
All you have to do
is summon Calcifer with your heart.

764
01:07:34,932 --> 01:07:36,889
Calcifer?

765
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:41,887
It's glowing!

766
01:07:42,022 --> 01:07:45,356
Just keep following that light
and you should be there before dark.

767
01:07:45,484 --> 01:07:48,520
I can't. Why did you make me
come here if you were coming yourself?

768
01:07:48,654 --> 01:07:51,109
Knowing you'd be there
gave me the courage to show up.

769
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,909
That woman terrifies me,
I can't face her on my own.

770
01:07:54,034 --> 01:07:56,074
You saved me, Sophie.

771
01:07:56,203 --> 01:07:59,370
I was in big trouble back there.

772
01:07:59,498 --> 01:08:02,997
Oh! Don't let go!

773
01:08:08,632 --> 01:08:10,589
- Wow. You're good.
- Are you nuts?

774
01:08:12,553 --> 01:08:14,296
We've got a good lead now.

775
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:17,964
I can give you five minutes
of invisibility, so use it wisely.

776
01:08:21,186 --> 01:08:22,894
Howl!

777
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:24,765
Good luck!

778
01:08:24,898 --> 01:08:26,772
Oh!

779
01:08:34,741 --> 01:08:37,113
No, not now.

780
01:08:37,244 --> 01:08:38,619
Oh, thank you.

781
01:08:38,745 --> 01:08:40,903
That was the most fun I've had in ages.

782
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,874
I suppose Howl thinks he's evaded me.

783
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,369
Hmm. I bet his mother
can help me find him.

784
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:05,636
Go!

785
01:09:07,232 --> 01:09:09,141
Huh?

786
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:40,549
Almost there.
That's my hometown below us.

787
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:45,304
Don't try to be cute, dog.

788
01:09:45,436 --> 01:09:47,310
I'm still not going to trust you.

789
01:10:11,045 --> 01:10:13,251
The castle is coming to meet us!

790
01:10:17,969 --> 01:10:20,257
Sophie! Here!

791
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,012
Markl, help me!

792
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:24,346
How am I supposed to land this thing?

793
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:38,739
Sophie!

794
01:10:38,864 --> 01:10:41,153
Nice doggie..

795
01:10:41,283 --> 01:10:43,572
Markl!

796
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,944
I'm home.

797
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,622
Are you hurt?

798
01:10:47,748 --> 01:10:48,827
Whoa!

799
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:50,368
I missed you.

800
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:53,170
I missed you too.
Thanks for coming to meet us.

801
01:11:22,908 --> 01:11:26,491
Oh, this is bad.
You've gone too far, Howl.

802
01:11:44,971 --> 01:11:47,593
I wonder if Howl's back home.

803
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:43,439
Howl?

804
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,007
Howl, is that you?

805
01:13:50,012 --> 01:13:52,384
Are you in pain?
Tell me what's happening.

806
01:13:52,514 --> 01:13:55,385
Go away.

807
01:13:55,517 --> 01:13:56,976
No, I'm not going away.

808
01:13:57,102 --> 01:13:59,854
I'm going to help you break
the spell that you're under.

809
01:14:00,981 --> 01:14:04,267
You... You can't
even break your own spell.

810
01:14:04,401 --> 01:14:06,857
But you don't understand. I love you.

811
01:14:06,987 --> 01:14:09,478
You're too late.

812
01:14:12,701 --> 01:14:15,073
Howl! No!

813
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:29,172
Calcifer, did Howl just get in?

814
01:14:29,301 --> 01:14:30,879
Yeah, and he looks terrible.

815
01:14:31,011 --> 01:14:33,846
You better figure out how
to break the spell on us quick.

816
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:36,380
Howl's running out of time,
I hope you realize that.

817
01:14:36,516 --> 01:14:39,434
You mean he'll become
a monster. Is that it?

818
01:14:39,561 --> 01:14:42,977
I can't tell you details of the curse,
lady. You should know that by now.

819
01:14:44,733 --> 01:14:46,943
Do you know
what Madame Suliman said?

820
01:14:46,943 --> 01:14:49,980
She said that Howl's heart
was stolen by a demon.

821
01:14:50,113 --> 01:14:51,905
Tell me now. What do you know?

822
01:14:52,032 --> 01:14:55,068
I'm so sorry, but that would
be confidential information.

823
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:57,989
What if I dump a bucket of water on you?

824
01:14:58,121 --> 01:15:00,826
If you drown me,
then Howl will die too!

825
01:15:20,018 --> 01:15:21,927
Hi, Turnip-head.

826
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:24,101
This isn't gonna be easy.

827
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:29,556
OK. Ready!

828
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:32,980
Calcifer, open it wider.

829
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:35,866
Here we go!

830
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:51,665
I... said... move!

831
01:15:51,799 --> 01:15:53,507
Ow!

832
01:15:53,634 --> 01:15:55,960
Oh! Oh!

833
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:19,443
If I just hang a little curtain here,
maybe Howl won't notice.

834
01:16:21,162 --> 01:16:23,653
Come on in, it's time to eat!

835
01:16:29,503 --> 01:16:31,413
Here. Want some more?

836
01:16:32,757 --> 01:16:35,461
- Don't feed her!
- That's the Witch of the Waste!

837
01:16:35,593 --> 01:16:37,003
Oh, she's all right.

838
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:39,971
- She keeps staring at me.
- It's freaking me out.

839
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:42,303
What a pretty fire.

840
01:16:44,602 --> 01:16:47,009
- Howl! Hello.
- Good morning, everyone.

841
01:16:47,146 --> 01:16:48,308
Glad you're home.

842
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:50,478
Master Howl,
we can keep this dog, can't we?

843
01:16:50,566 --> 01:16:53,816
The Witch of the Waste
and Suliman's dog at my table.

844
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:56,435
What possessed you
to let them in the house, Calcifer?

845
01:16:56,572 --> 01:16:57,983
I didn't let them in.

846
01:16:58,115 --> 01:17:00,950
Sophie crash-landed
her plane into my face.

847
01:17:03,621 --> 01:17:05,530
I knew she'd make a great pilot.

848
01:17:05,664 --> 01:17:09,199
Looks like we have yet
another addition to the family.

849
01:17:09,335 --> 01:17:13,005
Hmm, you've got quite
a nasty spell on you too.

850
01:17:13,005 --> 01:17:15,966
It seems everyone
in this family's got problems.

851
01:17:15,966 --> 01:17:18,338
What a handsome man.

852
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:21,920
So. We've got a lot
of work to do. We're moving.

853
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:23,799
- Moving?
- That's good.

854
01:17:23,932 --> 01:17:26,554
I'm sick of being stuck out here
in the middle of nowhere.

855
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:30,350
Madame Suliman is hot on our trail,
so we're gonna have to hurry.

856
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,936
I'm afraid your spell
is too strong for this move.

857
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,940
You're gonna have to stay behind.

858
01:17:40,824 --> 01:17:42,449
There. All done.

859
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:45,660
All right, Calcifer, line her up.

860
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,800
There. That should do it.

861
01:18:01,887 --> 01:18:03,760
Sit tight for a second.

862
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:09,264
Be gentle with me, please.

863
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,772
On my mark.

864
01:18:57,984 --> 01:19:00,938
Moving's done. You can get down now.

865
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:05,361
This is great, Master Howl! It's huge!

866
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:08,860
Oh, what a pretty fire.

867
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:25,301
- But this is...
- I added on a bathroom

868
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,132
since our family seems to keep growing.

869
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,422
Come over here, Sophie.

870
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:36,308
I added another bedroom too.

871
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:37,470
Have a look.

872
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:45,613
Oh.

873
01:19:47,825 --> 01:19:49,652
Why'd you... do this?

874
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,861
So we'd have a room that suited you.

875
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,075
Do you like it?

876
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,915
Of course.
It's perfect for a cleaning lady.

877
01:19:58,043 --> 01:20:01,044
I got you some new clothes too.
But you can open them later.

878
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:04,503
Come on, Sophie. Look at this.

879
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,590
All right, a courtyard!

880
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,007
That shop's ours too.

881
01:20:09,138 --> 01:20:10,881
Heen! Come on!

882
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,137
See that new color on the dial?

883
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:15,888
There's a new portal.

884
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:20,890
It's a present for you. Come see.

885
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,443
Oh!

886
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:48,124
You like it? It's my secret garden.

887
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,585
It's incredible.

888
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:54,933
Did you use your magic to make this?

889
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:58,267
Only a little,
just to help the flowers grow.

890
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,026
This place is gorgeous, Howl!

891
01:21:09,155 --> 01:21:11,362
It's like a dream.

892
01:21:34,347 --> 01:21:36,423
Sophie?

893
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:40,937
It all seems so familiar,
yet I know I've never been here before.

894
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,262
I feel so at home.

895
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,853
- Come with me.
- OK.

896
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:55,866
Look there..

897
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:03,417
- What a cute cottage.
- That was my secret hideaway.

898
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:07,872
I spent a lot of time here
by myself when I was young.

899
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:10,750
You were alone?

900
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:15,053
My uncle, who was a wizard,
gave me this place as my private study.

901
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:18,014
Now you can come here
whenever you like.

902
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:22,722
What's the matter?

903
01:22:22,853 --> 01:22:24,981
It's... You're scaring me.

904
01:22:24,981 --> 01:22:27,602
I have this weird feeling
that you're going to leave.

905
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:32,530
Howl, tell me what's going on.

906
01:22:32,655 --> 01:22:35,656
Please. I don't care
if you're a monster.

907
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:44,662
I'm setting things up so that
all of you can live comfortably.

908
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,950
With all the flowers
you've got in this valley,

909
01:22:47,044 --> 01:22:49,251
you could easily
open up a flower shop.

910
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:52,085
Right? I'm sure you'd be good at it.

911
01:22:52,216 --> 01:22:54,458
So, you are going away?

912
01:22:55,386 --> 01:22:58,969
Please, Howl,
I know I can be of help to you.

913
01:22:59,098 --> 01:23:03,345
Even though I'm not pretty,
and all I'm good at is cleaning.

914
01:23:03,477 --> 01:23:06,478
Sophie! Sophie, you're beautiful!

915
01:23:09,983 --> 01:23:14,195
Well, the nice thing about being old
is you've got nothing much to lose.

916
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:18,193
Hmm?

917
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:30,245
- What is that thing doing out here?
- A battleship?

918
01:23:30,379 --> 01:23:32,206
Still looking for more cities to burn.

919
01:23:32,339 --> 01:23:34,332
Is it the enemy's
or one of ours?

920
01:23:34,466 --> 01:23:36,293
What difference does it make?

921
01:23:48,397 --> 01:23:49,891
Those stupid murderers.

922
01:23:56,947 --> 01:23:59,901
We can't just let them
fly off with all those bombs.

923
01:24:15,924 --> 01:24:18,960
What's happening? What did you do?

924
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:21,881
Just messed with it.
It won't crash, though.

925
01:24:23,014 --> 01:24:24,177
Oh!

926
01:24:24,307 --> 01:24:26,099
Howl!

927
01:24:26,226 --> 01:24:28,895
Uh-oh. Here they come.

928
01:24:38,154 --> 01:24:41,772
Those things are
Suliman's henchmen. Let's go.

929
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:44,779
Faster! We need to take off!

930
01:24:57,965 --> 01:24:59,543
All right, you're going in.

931
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:01,964
No! Don't let go!

932
01:25:10,561 --> 01:25:12,471
Sophie, what happened?

933
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:15,476
Oh! I'm too old
to be treated like this!

934
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:28,993
- Uh, good night, Sophie.
- Good night, Markl.

935
01:25:30,623 --> 01:25:32,781
Oh, don't worry
about Master Howl, Sophie.

936
01:25:32,917 --> 01:25:34,956
Sometimes he likes
to go away for days on end.

937
01:25:35,086 --> 01:25:37,577
Thank you.
That's good to know.

938
01:25:37,713 --> 01:25:40,085
- Need anything else?
- No, I'm fine.

939
01:25:40,216 --> 01:25:42,339
Well. Good night, then.

940
01:25:42,468 --> 01:25:43,748
You're in love.

941
01:25:46,222 --> 01:25:49,887
Don't deny it.
You've been sighing all day.

942
01:25:59,985 --> 01:26:03,401
Hmm. Just as I thought.

943
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:05,950
Have you ever been in love before?

944
01:26:05,950 --> 01:26:08,904
Of course I have. I'm still in love.

945
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:13,531
Strapping, young men
are so difficult to deal with.

946
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:16,121
But their hearts, I just adore.

947
01:26:16,251 --> 01:26:18,125
You're terrible.

948
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,542
And they're so cute too.

949
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:25,709
What's that?

950
01:26:25,844 --> 01:26:27,504
It's an air raid siren.

951
01:26:28,472 --> 01:26:29,468
Air raid?

952
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:32,135
It's a long way's off.

953
01:26:32,267 --> 01:26:34,972
But you better not
go outside tonight, dear.

954
01:26:35,896 --> 01:26:40,225
I'm sure Suliman's henchmen
are looking everywhere for this place.

955
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:45,735
What a good fire.

956
01:26:45,864 --> 01:26:47,904
He keeps this house so well hidden.

957
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:25,860
- Sophie, there's a strange lady here!
- Hmm?

958
01:27:32,911 --> 01:27:34,239
Mother?

959
01:27:34,371 --> 01:27:36,862
Sophie!

960
01:27:38,958 --> 01:27:41,912
Thank goodness you're here!
I searched everywhere for you!

961
01:27:42,045 --> 01:27:44,915
Oh, my, look at your face,
you're so old!

962
01:27:45,048 --> 01:27:47,918
Everyone's saying
it's my fault that you left!

963
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:52,594
You'll forgive me,
oh, won't you? Oh, Sophie!

964
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,056
Mother.

965
01:27:56,392 --> 01:27:59,263
I barely recognize the place.

966
01:27:59,395 --> 01:28:02,729
Who is that woman? Huh? The landlady?

967
01:28:02,857 --> 01:28:06,273
Oh! I forgot to tell you!
I got married again!

968
01:28:06,402 --> 01:28:09,024
He's such a nice man,
and he's filthy rich too,

969
01:28:09,155 --> 01:28:11,112
so we can all live together again!

970
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,951
You won't have
to work as a cleaning lady.

971
01:28:13,951 --> 01:28:17,783
That's all right, Mother.
I actually like living here.

972
01:28:17,914 --> 01:28:20,405
Really?  I forgot!

973
01:28:20,541 --> 01:28:23,032
I've got a car waiting. I've gotta run.

974
01:28:23,169 --> 01:28:26,419
Sophie, I'm so glad I found you.

975
01:28:40,937 --> 01:28:45,100
A peeping bug?
Can't Suliman do better than that?

976
01:28:45,232 --> 01:28:46,976
Open wide, Cal.

977
01:28:55,993 --> 01:28:58,780
I hope you and your new
husband will be very happy.

978
01:28:58,913 --> 01:29:02,198
- Thank you, Sophie. Bye.
- Bye, Mother.

979
01:29:05,586 --> 01:29:08,789
I did what I was told.
Now take me to my husband.

980
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:11,877
Yes, ma'am. I'm sure
Madame Suliman will be very pleased.

981
01:29:14,011 --> 01:29:15,929
Forgive me, Sophie.

982
01:29:19,975 --> 01:29:21,386
Wow. Look at all of them.

983
01:29:21,518 --> 01:29:25,183
If they keep leaving at this rate,
the town will soon be empty.

984
01:29:25,314 --> 01:29:28,231
- Do you want to leave too, Sophie?
- What?

985
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:30,980
That lady said she wants you
to live with her now.

986
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:34,694
Yes, well, at least
she cared enough to visit.

987
01:29:34,823 --> 01:29:37,112
Don't leave, Sophie.

988
01:29:37,201 --> 01:29:40,036
I love you. You have to stay.

989
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:44,159
Oh, I love you too, Markl.

990
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:45,702
I'll stay.

991
01:29:45,834 --> 01:29:47,708
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

992
01:29:47,836 --> 01:29:49,378
Because we're a family now.

993
01:29:49,505 --> 01:29:51,378
Yes, we're a family.

994
01:29:51,507 --> 01:29:53,380
Thank you, Sophie.

995
01:30:01,183 --> 01:30:04,267
I'll never let Suliman
get ahold of Howl.

996
01:30:21,036 --> 01:30:23,159
But the newspaper says we won.

997
01:30:23,288 --> 01:30:27,120
Only idiots believe
what they read in the paper.

998
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:30,921
That's so strange.
I can't get Calcifer going.

999
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:33,376
Do you have to keep smoking that?

1000
01:30:33,506 --> 01:30:35,298
It smells terrible.

1001
01:30:35,425 --> 01:30:38,046
Don't deny an old witch
her pleasures, young lady.

1002
01:30:38,178 --> 01:30:40,633
Markl,
will you crack a window, please?

1003
01:30:40,764 --> 01:30:42,139
Mm-hmm.

1004
01:30:44,267 --> 01:30:47,019
I wouldn't open that window,
if I were you, dear.

1005
01:30:48,063 --> 01:30:51,313
Calcifer's too weak right now
to protect this place.

1006
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:53,226
Suliman's henchmen could get in.

1007
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:56,988
Markl!

1008
01:31:06,581 --> 01:31:08,573
Get back!

1009
01:31:14,088 --> 01:31:15,997
Markl, get back inside.

1010
01:31:16,132 --> 01:31:18,041
- I'm going to check on the shop.
- Mm-hmm.

1011
01:31:35,693 --> 01:31:37,567
There are bombs falling on us!

1012
01:31:37,695 --> 01:31:41,230
Why can't you put out
some fires instead?

1013
01:32:04,972 --> 01:32:06,514
Howl! No!

1014
01:32:09,310 --> 01:32:10,852
Oh!

1015
01:32:19,403 --> 01:32:21,027
This is exciting.

1016
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:35,209
Howl!

1017
01:32:37,254 --> 01:32:39,745
I'm sorry, Sophie.
I should've gotten here sooner.

1018
01:32:39,882 --> 01:32:43,464
You're alive! Oh, thank goodness!

1019
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:03,069
Master Howl! Sophie! You're OK!

1020
01:33:04,489 --> 01:33:06,233
Calcifer.

1021
01:33:06,366 --> 01:33:08,489
You hang in there, now.

1022
01:33:12,748 --> 01:33:17,125
Tell me, was that cigar a gift
from Madame Suliman by any chance?

1023
01:33:17,252 --> 01:33:20,585
Howl, she fed me
something gross. I feel sick.

1024
01:33:20,714 --> 01:33:23,584
Why, if it isn't Howl.

1025
01:33:23,717 --> 01:33:27,928
I think you and I need to have
a nice, long, heart-to-heart chat.

1026
01:33:28,054 --> 01:33:32,218
There's nothing I'd like more than that,
but right now there's a war going on.

1027
01:33:33,185 --> 01:33:36,933
How unlike you, Howl,
not running away anymore.

1028
01:33:37,063 --> 01:33:39,056
Until later, then.

1029
01:33:39,190 --> 01:33:42,441
Stay here. Calcifer will
protect you from the henchmen.

1030
01:33:42,569 --> 01:33:44,277
I'll stand guard out front.

1031
01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:50,408
No, wait! Howl! Don't go out there.
It's too dangerous.

1032
01:33:50,535 --> 01:33:52,113
Another wave's coming.

1033
01:33:52,245 --> 01:33:54,238
And Calcifer's too weak
to stop the bombs.

1034
01:33:54,372 --> 01:33:56,661
Let's run! Don't fight them, Howl.

1035
01:33:56,791 --> 01:33:59,745
Sorry. I've had enough
of running away, Sophie.

1036
01:33:59,836 --> 01:34:04,877
Now I've got something
I want to protect. It's you.

1037
01:34:09,262 --> 01:34:10,590
Come back!

1038
01:34:25,695 --> 01:34:27,154
Hmm!

1039
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,637
There's where we are, at the shop.

1040
01:35:40,853 --> 01:35:42,347
Looks like Howl's in trouble.

1041
01:35:51,738 --> 01:35:52,901
Howl, look out!

1042
01:36:01,999 --> 01:36:04,786
What's going on? Turnip!

1043
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,419
- Markl, I need your help.
- Huh?

1044
01:36:10,549 --> 01:36:13,419
Are you crazy? I can't move
the portals without Howl's help.

1045
01:36:13,552 --> 01:36:16,930
Try. If we don't break away,
Howl will keep protecting the hat shop.

1046
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:18,932
I'd preferred him as a coward.

1047
01:36:18,932 --> 01:36:22,266
- OK, we have to go now.
- Are we going for a stroll?

1048
01:36:22,394 --> 01:36:24,683
We can't do that.
It'll make us too vulnerable!

1049
01:36:24,813 --> 01:36:25,975
We already are.

1050
01:36:26,106 --> 01:36:28,431
If we don't move quick,
Howl doesn't have a chance.

1051
01:36:28,567 --> 01:36:31,105
Sophie! They're about
to bomb the hat shop!

1052
01:36:31,194 --> 01:36:33,401
Quick. Help her get outside, OK?

1053
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,989
Right.

1054
01:36:36,366 --> 01:36:38,240
You're coming with us. Hop on.

1055
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:39,946
I can't! It's impossible!

1056
01:36:40,078 --> 01:36:42,236
No one but Howl
can take me out of this hearth.

1057
01:36:42,372 --> 01:36:45,243
There's no time to lose.
We have to try something.

1058
01:36:45,375 --> 01:36:47,166
Oh! Don't do this! No, no!

1059
01:36:47,293 --> 01:36:49,666
Help, help, crazy lady with a shovel!

1060
01:36:49,754 --> 01:36:52,839
If you take me out that door,
the castle could collapse.

1061
01:36:52,966 --> 01:36:53,915
Good!

1062
01:36:57,470 --> 01:36:59,178
- We're ready.
- OK, step back.

1063
01:36:59,305 --> 01:37:01,345
Make sure I go out last, Sophie.

1064
01:37:01,474 --> 01:37:05,851
I don't know what'll happen,
but I'm sure it won't be good.

1065
01:37:34,007 --> 01:37:38,087
- I told you it would collapse.
- Rain! Rain!

1066
01:37:40,805 --> 01:37:42,085
That ship's headed for town!

1067
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:43,966
Markl, look after her, OK?

1068
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:45,973
Turnip-head, help me find a way back in.

1069
01:37:46,811 --> 01:37:49,563
Don't you worry, now, ma'am,
I'll take good care of you.

1070
01:37:52,441 --> 01:37:54,268
Markl, here's a way in!

1071
01:38:04,287 --> 01:38:06,956
- The roof's leaking.
- Don't let me get wet!

1072
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:08,456
Hold on for a second.

1073
01:38:08,582 --> 01:38:11,252
It's wet here, Sophie! Ah!

1074
01:38:11,377 --> 01:38:15,327
Too damp,
too damp, very damp here!

1075
01:38:15,464 --> 01:38:16,839
Hurry! Hurry!

1076
01:38:16,966 --> 01:38:18,839
Hurry, please!

1077
01:38:26,016 --> 01:38:27,559
Markl, hurry, get inside.

1078
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:29,724
The castle's a wreck.

1079
01:38:29,853 --> 01:38:33,104
Told you we should have stayed put.
Howl and I could have handled it.

1080
01:38:35,526 --> 01:38:38,396
We have to tell Howl we're not
attached to the hat shop now.

1081
01:38:38,529 --> 01:38:40,521
Move the castle and take us to Howl.

1082
01:38:40,656 --> 01:38:42,530
Ah! What?

1083
01:38:42,658 --> 01:38:46,525
I know you can do it.
I've never seen a fire with more spark.

1084
01:38:46,662 --> 01:38:50,362
But there's no chimney here,
and I keep getting dripped on.

1085
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:51,910
And the wood's all damp.

1086
01:38:52,042 --> 01:38:54,331
They say that the best blaze brightest

1087
01:38:54,461 --> 01:38:56,869
when circumstances are at their worst.

1088
01:38:57,005 --> 01:38:59,413
Yeah, but no one really believes that.

1089
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:01,008
Come on, let's be honest.

1090
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:04,468
- Oh! What a pretty fire.
- Why don't you have a seat.

1091
01:39:04,596 --> 01:39:07,597
All right. I need
something of yours, Sophie.

1092
01:39:07,724 --> 01:39:08,887
Why's that?

1093
01:39:09,017 --> 01:39:11,425
I can't do it by myself.
How about your eyes?

1094
01:39:11,561 --> 01:39:15,227
Huh? How about this?

1095
01:39:36,586 --> 01:39:38,543
Ahh!

1096
01:40:03,863 --> 01:40:06,105
Ahh!

1097
01:40:19,754 --> 01:40:22,327
Thanks, Calcifer. You're fantastic!

1098
01:40:22,465 --> 01:40:25,715
Imagine what I could've done
with your eyes. Or your heart.

1099
01:40:25,843 --> 01:40:28,963
That's it! You've got Howl's heart!

1100
01:40:31,224 --> 01:40:33,347
I found it!

1101
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:48,192
I can see Howl down there.
Looks like he's trapped!

1102
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:55,697
Calcifer, hurry!

1103
01:40:55,831 --> 01:40:57,917
No!

1104
01:40:57,917 --> 01:40:59,197
Put it back!

1105
01:40:59,335 --> 01:41:01,873
Let go!

1106
01:41:02,004 --> 01:41:04,958
Howl's heart, it's mine!

1107
01:41:15,643 --> 01:41:17,018
Put it back now!

1108
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:20,981
It's hot! Ah!

1109
01:41:20,981 --> 01:41:23,021
- It's burning me!
- Let go!

1110
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,107
You're catching on fire!

1111
01:41:25,236 --> 01:41:27,109
No, it's mine.

1112
01:41:27,238 --> 01:41:31,864
It's mine! It's mine!

1113
01:41:41,377 --> 01:41:43,168
Ah!

1114
01:41:45,005 --> 01:41:47,164
Sophie!

1115
01:41:50,803 --> 01:41:53,757
- Sophie!
- Sophie ruined it!

1116
01:41:53,889 --> 01:41:56,214
My heart's ruined!

1117
01:42:39,518 --> 01:42:43,052
Heen, what have I done?
I poured water on Calcifer!

1118
01:42:45,357 --> 01:42:48,358
What if I killed Howl too?

1119
01:43:15,053 --> 01:43:17,970
It's moving. Is Howl still alive?

1120
01:43:18,097 --> 01:43:20,220
Can you lead me to him?

1121
01:43:41,454 --> 01:43:43,493
The front door.

1122
01:45:01,408 --> 01:45:02,867
Heen.

1123
01:45:37,152 --> 01:45:39,109
That's Howl.

1124
01:45:57,505 --> 01:46:00,459
I know where I am.
I'm in Howl's childhood.

1125
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:25,948
Oh!

1126
01:47:19,086 --> 01:47:21,328
Howl! Calcifer!

1127
01:47:22,965 --> 01:47:24,958
It's me, Sophie!

1128
01:47:25,092 --> 01:47:27,049
I know how to help you now.

1129
01:47:27,928 --> 01:47:31,297
Find me in the future!

1130
01:48:03,047 --> 01:48:06,415
Sorry, Heen. I'm trying to hurry.

1131
01:48:06,508 --> 01:48:08,501
I just can't seem to stop crying.

1132
01:48:32,993 --> 01:48:34,191
Howl.

1133
01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:43,621
I'm sorry. Did I come too late?

1134
01:48:43,753 --> 01:48:47,372
I didn't mean
to make you wait this long.

1135
01:48:50,677 --> 01:48:53,963
I need you to take me
to Calcifer if you can.

1136
01:49:56,743 --> 01:49:59,827
- He's dead?
- No, Markl.

1137
01:50:03,875 --> 01:50:05,250
Howl needs that back now.

1138
01:50:05,376 --> 01:50:06,919
Don't look at me. I don't have it.

1139
01:50:06,919 --> 01:50:09,457
I don't know what you're talking about.

1140
01:50:09,547 --> 01:50:10,661
Please.

1141
01:50:12,258 --> 01:50:14,297
Please give it back.

1142
01:50:17,013 --> 01:50:19,883
You really want it that badly?

1143
01:50:20,016 --> 01:50:21,976
Yes.

1144
01:50:21,976 --> 01:50:23,684
All right, then.

1145
01:50:23,811 --> 01:50:26,267
- You'd better take good care of it.
- OK.

1146
01:50:26,397 --> 01:50:28,970
Here, dear.

1147
01:50:29,066 --> 01:50:31,522
Thank you, you have a big heart.

1148
01:50:47,126 --> 01:50:49,035
Calcifer.

1149
01:50:50,171 --> 01:50:52,578
Sophie, I'm so tired.

1150
01:50:52,715 --> 01:50:56,214
If I give Howl back his heart,
what will happen to you?

1151
01:50:56,343 --> 01:50:58,917
I'll be OK if you do it. I think.

1152
01:50:59,054 --> 01:51:03,763
You dumped water on me,
and Howl and I both survived.

1153
01:51:03,892 --> 01:51:05,932
I better try then.

1154
01:51:08,689 --> 01:51:11,974
It's so warm and fluttering like a bird.

1155
01:51:12,067 --> 01:51:14,523
It's still just the heart of a child.

1156
01:51:15,320 --> 01:51:18,321
Please, help Calcifer live.

1157
01:51:18,449 --> 01:51:21,782
And please help Howl
take back his heart.

1158
01:51:33,881 --> 01:51:36,122
- I'm alive!
- I'm alive! Look, I'm free!

1159
01:51:36,258 --> 01:51:40,469
Free! Free!  I'm alive!

1160
01:51:42,597 --> 01:51:44,804
He moved! See?

1161
01:51:48,979 --> 01:51:50,936
It can't stand without Calcifer!

1162
01:52:06,037 --> 01:52:06,986
Turnip!

1163
01:52:19,467 --> 01:52:20,926
His pole snapped!

1164
01:52:21,052 --> 01:52:23,424
Are you all right?
We'll get you a new pole, OK?

1165
01:52:25,974 --> 01:52:28,512
You saved us, Turnip.

1166
01:52:36,025 --> 01:52:37,567
Thank you, Sophie.

1167
01:52:37,694 --> 01:52:40,813
I'm the prince missing
from the neighboring kingdom.

1168
01:52:40,905 --> 01:52:43,112
Somehow I got that blasted spell on me.

1169
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:46,776
I know that spell.
A kiss from your true love breaks it.

1170
01:52:46,911 --> 01:52:48,913
That's right. If it weren't for Sophie.

1171
01:52:48,913 --> 01:52:51,404
I would have been a scarecrow
for the rest of my life.

1172
01:52:51,541 --> 01:52:53,866
My, what a
strapping young man you are.

1173
01:52:54,001 --> 01:52:56,290
What's going on? What am I doing here?

1174
01:52:56,421 --> 01:53:00,205
I feel terrible,
like there's a weight on my chest.

1175
01:53:00,341 --> 01:53:02,879
A heart's a heavy burden.

1176
01:53:03,011 --> 01:53:06,842
Wow! Sophie,
your hair looks just like starlight.

1177
01:53:06,973 --> 01:53:08,467
It's beautiful.

1178
01:53:08,599 --> 01:53:11,269
You think so? So do l!

1179
01:53:13,062 --> 01:53:15,814
It looks like your true love
is in love with someone else.

1180
01:53:15,940 --> 01:53:19,475
You should go home anyway, and
tell your king to stop this dumb war.

1181
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:21,188
Yes, that's exactly what I'll do.

1182
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:24,570
One thing you can always
count on is that hearts change.

1183
01:53:24,699 --> 01:53:27,486
So as soon as this war is over,
I shall return.

1184
01:53:27,618 --> 01:53:30,109
I love it when you talk like that.

1185
01:53:30,246 --> 01:53:32,951
I'll look forward to your return,
big boy.

1186
01:53:39,505 --> 01:53:40,965
There you are.

1187
01:53:40,965 --> 01:53:43,372
You should have checked in earlier.

1188
01:53:43,509 --> 01:53:45,418
What on earth were you up to?

1189
01:53:48,472 --> 01:53:50,880
Howl found his true love.

1190
01:53:51,016 --> 01:53:53,554
You little traitor.

1191
01:53:58,065 --> 01:54:01,766
The game is over.

1192
01:54:01,902 --> 01:54:05,947
Get me the Prime Minister
and the Minister of Defense.

1193
01:54:06,073 --> 01:54:08,860
It's time to put an end
to this idiotic war.

1194
01:54:08,993 --> 01:54:09,941
Yes, ma'am.

1195
01:54:10,077 --> 01:54:12,533
Hey, it's Calcifer!

1196
01:54:12,663 --> 01:54:15,201
You didn't have to come back, Calcifer.

1197
01:54:17,668 --> 01:54:19,210
I kind of missed you guys.

1198
01:54:19,336 --> 01:54:20,914
And it looks like it's gonna rain.

1199
01:54:21,046 --> 01:54:24,047
I missed you too, Calcifer.

1200
01:54:24,174 --> 01:54:25,918
Wow!
