00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,250
How do you like my car, Big boy?

00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,050
<i>Bart, Sarah and Jonathan</i>

3
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,480
<i>are spending their leisure day
at the city pool.</i>

4
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,324
<i>Aren't they lucky?</i>

5
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,646
<i>Let's see what they have
brought with them to the pool today.</i>

6
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,403
<i>Bart has a plain towel.</i>

7
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,848
<i>Sarah has a bright towel.</i>

8
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,407
<i>Jonathan has a gay towel.</i>

9
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,971
<i>There's something wrong
with kids today.</i>

10
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,928
<i>They know too much.</i>

11
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,088
<i>Take this little gem.</i>

12
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:25,329
<i>She's 13.</i>

13
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,970
<i>Already she's got herself a winner.</i>

14
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,127
<i>Sure, he's three times her age,</i>

15
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>but he's got money for pot
and he drives a nice car.</i>

16
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,050
Who's the man, baby?

17
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,689
Who's the man?

18
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,531
- You are. You're the man.
- Yeah. That's right.

19
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,370
That's right. I'm the man.

20
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,521
Oh, yes. You're my foxy-fox.

21
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,687
<i>I'm not saying
I wasn't a little bastard.</i>

22
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,161
<i>I mean, I grew up Irish.</i>

23
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,971
<i>The Bronx. Riverdale.</i>

24
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,925
<i>I don't have a job title,
I'm not in the Yellow Pages,</i>

25
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,809
<i>but if you got trouble with someone,</i>

26
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,610
<i>someone's messing around
with your underage daughter,</i>

27
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,889
<i>you might ask around for me,
Jackson Healy.</i>

28
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,526
Are you the man?

29
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,805
What?

30
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,002
Stay away from little girls.

31
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,406
<i>Love. Grand, isn't it?</i>

32
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,050
<i>I was in love once.</i>

33
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,805
<i>Marriage is buying a house
for someone you hate.</i>

34
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,040
<i>Remember that.</i>

35
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,375
<i>I'm here with a representative</i>

36

37
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,735
<i>And, Mr. Paulsen, glad to have you here.</i>

38
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,887
<i>I understand that you're in town
for the big show.</i>

39
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,451
<i>Tell us a little bit about it.</i>

40
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>Take a look at this outstanding line-up
we have here for you.</i>

41
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:42,084
<i>These cars are so incredible,
they practically drive themselves.</i>

42
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,526
<i>I do have to ask you</i>

43
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,081
<i>about the allegations about collusion</i>

44
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,175
<i>in regards to</i> a <i>smog control device...</i>

45
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,201
<i>the recent lawsuit against the Big Three.</i>

46
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,656
<i>I'm not gonna dignify that...</i>

47
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,603
<i>You have reached
March Investigations.</i>

48

<i>This machine records messages.</i>

49
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,571
<i>Wait for the tone and speak clearly.</i>

50
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,136
<i>This is your daughter speaking.</i>

51
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,528
<i>Thursday, as you may remember,
is my birthday.</i>

52
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,648
<i>Please give accordingly.</i>

53
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,329
<i>Also, I hope you didn't forget that
you're supposed to be working today.</i>

54
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,406
<i>I wish I wished for things, man.</i>

55
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,928
<i>My folks, they told me
to reach for the stars,</i>

56
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:34,288
<i>and then my pals in the force
said reach for the brass ring,</i>

57
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,725
<i>and then my wife died,</i>

58
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,850
<i>and I reached for whatever came
in a gallon and cost a buck fifty.</i>

59
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,928
<i>She used to say I got no follow-through.</i>

60
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,002
<i>I hit nails in halfway and stop.</i>

61
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,850
<i>She's not wrong.</i>

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,576
<i>Hey, there's</i> a <i>line, asshole!</i>

63
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,816
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

64
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,165
<i>They implemented a no-fault divorce here
a couple of years back</i>

65
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,163
<i>that really screwed things up.</i>

66
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,766
<i>A lot of private cops folded.</i>

67
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,610
<i>Not me. I got this guy
in a local retirement park.</i>

68
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,966
<i>He kicks a few cases my way.</i>

69
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,761
<i>It's my husband.</i>

70
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,365
Fred's his name.

71
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,680
Fred.

72
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,887
He's gone missing.

73
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,120
Missing?

74
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,930
<i>I'm terribly worried.</i>

75
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,281
<i>It's just Fred's never been
gone this long before.</i>

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,490
How long has he been missing?

77
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,449
Since the funeral.

78
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,680
Well, I can start right away.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,161
Amelia?

80
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,730
Mr. Healy.

81
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,483
Um, I think there's two of them,

82
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,165
but I only have the name
and description for the one.

83
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,610
<i>You can take care of them?</i>

84
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,363
Consider it done.

85
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,725
Thank you.

86
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,882
- I feel better already.
- It's my job.

87
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,244
They've been following me around
and asking my friends where I live.

88
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:08,927
I've just been really scared,
but, um, you make me feel safe.

89
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,569
You're short.

90
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,091
I'm what?

91
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,083
You're seven dollars short.

92
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,163
Right, um...

93
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,199
Sorry. Um...

94
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,365
<i>Sometimes
I feel okay about things.</i>

95
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,925
<i>Not often.</i>

96
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:27,920
<i>Could try for an investigator's license.</i>

97
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,206
<i>Become a P.l.</i>

<i>Maybe then I'd feel good in the morning.</i>

100
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,524
She's got dark hair,

101
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,729
about yea high.

102
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,725
Name's Amelia.

103
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,404
She might be from the neighborhood.

104
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,126
- No, can't help you, buddy.
- No?

105
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,485
Sorry.

106
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,722
<i>I work in a cesspool.
Sex. More sex.</i>

107
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,601
<i>My wife, she used to say
I make a living off rumpy-pumpy.</i>

108
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,961
<i>Whatever. She was English.</i>

109
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,415
<i>I don't know
what the fuck it means either.</i>

110
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,096
<i>The point is I don't care
if Colonel Mustard</i>

111
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,679
<i>did it in the study with a candlestick,</i>

112
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,724
<i>I just wanna know who he did it with
and get the pictures.</i>

113
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,176
<i>Yeah, I think I remember her.</i>

114
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,690
Amelia, right?

115
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,279
Was in here three or four nights ago.

116
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,243
Drank bourbon martinis.

117
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:12,802
Well, that's disgusting.

118
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,361
Any chance she, uh,
paid with a credit card?

119
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,881
As in, am I gonna pull
the receipts for you?

120
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,808
Fat fucking chance.

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,440
ls that a shirt?

122
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,931
Yeah.

123
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,286
It's very pretty-

124
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,124
I made it myself.

125
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,725
Yeah?

126
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,969
I made this.

127
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,326
<i>Look, I'm not saying it's easy.</i>

128
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,125
<i>I'm not saying you don't
gotta think on your feet,</i>

<i>bend a few rules maybe,</i>

130
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,682
<i>but it's Worth it,</i>

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,841
<i>as long as you get the results.</i>

132
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,485
Okay, that's it.

133
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,000
That's a lot of blood.

134
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:12,527
That is a lot... That's a lot of blood.

135
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,003
We're losing him. Go! Hurry up!

136
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,889
Now, don't go anywhere. Don't...

137
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,201
Stay with me. Stay with me! Sir.

138
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,320
Now, tell me, are you willing to find God?

139
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,721

Mr. March, we're gonna play a game.

161
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,010
I think you have the wrong house.

162
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,163
It's called, "Shut up unless you're me."

163
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,283
I love that game.

164
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,684
You're a private investigator?

165
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,816
Look, there's 20 bucks in there,
all right? Just take it.

166
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,969
No, I'm not here for that.
I told you, I'm a messenger.

167
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,961
You can afford
to live like this as a P.l.?

168
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,565
What's the message?

169
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,721
Oh, right, right.

170
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,562
Stop looking for Amelia, all right?

171
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,721
I'm not even looking for Amelia.

172
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,280
<i>She's</i> a <i>person of interest, man.</i>

173
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,566
Fine.

174
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,721
I'm done. Put a fork in me.

175
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,450
Don't really put a fork in me.

176
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,135
Amelia's gonna be very happy
that you got the message so quickly.

177
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,241
It's gonna make her smile. That's good.

178
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,448
Now, ahem, I got one more thing I need
to ask you before we're done here.

179
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,044
You wanna know who hired me.

180
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,201
Bingo. Yeah.

181
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,456
Now, we can do this the easy way
or we can do it the hard way.

182
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,924
- Glenn.
- What?

183
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,081
Lily Glenn. Two N's.

184
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,686
Old lady hired me
to find her niece on Tuesday.

185
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,205
You just gave up your client.

186
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,522
I made a discretionary revelation.

187
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,169
No. No, you just gave her up.

188
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,809
I asked you one simple question.

189
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,096
You gave me all the information.

190
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,375
I thought that's what you wanted.

191
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,686
What?

192
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,164
Now, I'm very sorry that
you didn't get the message.

193
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,085
Me, too. But I get it now.

194
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,639
I get it. I dig it.

195
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,961
Shit!

196
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,965
What about now? You get the message now?

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,808
- Yep.
- Are you sure?

198
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,441
Yeah, I'm cool.

199
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,607
- All right. Give me your left arm.
- Huh?

200
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,536
<i>Your left arm.
Give me your left arm. This one.</i>

201
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:35,890
- No!
- Yeah, come on.

202
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,040
No!

203
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,681
Get... No!

204
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,921
Did you cut yourself?

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,286
I'm dealing with an injury.

206
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,255
Right, look, when you're
talking to your doctor,

207
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,330
just tell him you have
a spiral fracture of the left radius.

208
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
No! No!

209
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,640
- Deep breath.
- No!

210
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,370
Do you mind if I have an apple?

211
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,486
All right, Mr. March.
You have a good day, okay?

212
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,009
- Hi.
- Hey.

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
<i>Want a You-hoe'?</i>

214
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,446
A Yoo-hoo?

215
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:13,524
Are you kidding?

216
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,326
Oh, yeah.

217
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,323
You know, I haven't had one
of these in about 30 years.

218
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,931
Are you a friend of my dad's?

219
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,480
Yeah, yeah. We're business associates.

220
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:25,971
He's inside resting.

221
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,091
Didn't I see you crawling round
a vacant lot a couple of blocks over?

222
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,047
Um, maybe. I read there sometimes.

223
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,571
Right.

224
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,000
"It's me-he for Yoo-hoo!" Thanks again.

225
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,286
Bye.

226
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,283
<i>Because the gas prices
are up 16 cents a gallon,</i>

227
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,966
<i>uh, the US now
is looking into alternative fuels.</i>

228
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,727
There's a process where you can
put corn in and gas comes out.

229
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,166
<i>I'm no scientist,</i>

230
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,210
<i>but that's been my process
with corn for years.</i>

231
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,365
Hey.

232
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,760
It's not a public area up here.

233
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:15,760
WOW.

234
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,400
You got like an apartment up here?

235
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:22,484
If you're looking for the restroom,
back down the stairs.

236
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,770
We're looking for Amelia.

237
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,400
<i>I'm telling you,
I saw her, Mr. March.</i>

238
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:38,688
I didn't imagine it. I saw my Misty alive.

239
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,001
Mrs. Glenn, be reasonable.

240
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:43,207
This is a high-profile case.

241
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,922
Your niece is a very famous actress,

242
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,527
and the head medical examiner
lD'd her himself.

243
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,604
I saw her through the front window.

244
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:55,879
- You didn't.
- Clear as day.

245
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:56,921
<i>She was wearing...</i>

246
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,799
The pinstriped suit. I know.
Very specific.

247
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:00,255
<i>She was writing something and then</i>

248
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,126
she came out and she drove away,
and this was two days after the accident.

249
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,964
And I thought that you said you found her.

250
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,009
Now, what was that bonus payment?

251
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,006
I never said I found her.

252
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,924
I said I was tracking
the girl that you saw

253
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,003
and that was probably
this young lady, Amelia.

254
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,605
Why don't you believe me?

255
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:22,728
Mrs. Glenn, Misty's dead.

256
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,483
She died in that accident.

257
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,769
<i>I never should have taken
your money in the first place.</i>

258
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,922
I'm very sorry about that.

259
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,121
Even... No, even if this
Amelia girl isn't my niece,

260
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:37,401
<i>she might know something.</i>

261
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,086
Please, please, will you keep looking?

262
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,480
No.

263
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,410
Mr. March...

264
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,044
Can I ask you a question?

265
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,530
Tell me the truth.

266
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,968
And don't take it easy on me
just 'cause I'm your father.

267
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,645
You just tell it to me straight.

268
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,006
Am I a bad person?

269
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,361
Yes.

270
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,565
Just drive.

271
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:32,361
I'm gonna ask you again.

272
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,682
Where is Amelia?

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,127
I would like to help you,

274
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,520
but I just don't know
anybody called Amelia.

275
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,050
Oh, okay.

276
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,729
You don't talk, I'm gonna have to start
breaking your fingers.

277
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,529
<i>You understand?</i>

278
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,920
Yes, I understand.

279
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,444
Hey, hotshot, come on in here.

280
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,522
I found something hidden in the cabinet.

281
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,840
Really?

282
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,210
Watch him.

283
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,599
No, hey, don't.

284
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:03,923
Hey, don't open that
because that's not mine.

285
00:19:04,119 --> 00:19:05,375
It belongs to a friend. I just, uh...

286
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,401
I look after it for him.

287
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,403
But it's one of those bags.

288
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:09,776
<i>If you try to open</i> it...

289
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:10,800
<i>Oh, fuck! Fuck!</i>

290
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
Shit!

291
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,403
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

292
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,921
Motherfucker!

293
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,365
- I can't see nothing.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,886
Oh, God. What the fuck?

295
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,804
Okay. Yeah.

296
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,727
You know that color
doesn't come off, right?

297
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,519
I tried to tell you.

298
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,887
You tried to tell me?

299
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:40,685
<i>Fuck you!</i>

300
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,000
Hey, hey. Oh, no! Hey!

301
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,769
<i>Not the fish. Come on.</i>

302
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,490
Hey, can you ask this guy
to behave like a professional?

303
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,449
You know, kid,
when I get that gun off you,

304
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,885
it's gonna be your dinner.

305
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,969
Dinner?

306
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,926
It's fucking...
You're funny. You're funny.

307
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,080
Don't... Don't...

308
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,844
Come on, fish.

309
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,615
You want some fucking dinner?
Do you want some dinner?

310
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,096
Why are you doing this?
This is not gonna help you.

311
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,256
- There you go.
- Now, come on.

312
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:06,079
You're gonna eat that thing,
you fucking fuck!

313
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,723
Look, you gotta stop and
think about this, all right?

314
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,363
When you came here tonight,
was this what you wanted to happen?

315
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,807
What, you came here to make me eat fish?

316
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,371
To shoot me?

317
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,039
<i>Look, if you come in here,
you beat up on me, you trash the place,</i>

318
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,920
I understand, I get it,
it's part of the job.

319
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,529
I accept it, all right?

320
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,760
But what did you do?

321
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,048
You did something different
from that, didn't you? Right?

322
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,929
You pissed me off.

323
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,884
You made an enemy.

324
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:41,650
Now, even if I knew something,
I wouldn't tell you, kid.

325
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,319
And you know why I wouldn't tell you?

326
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,967
And this is... It's not my only reason,
but it is a principle reason.

327
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:49,884
You know, I wouldn't tell you
'cause you're a fucking moron.

328
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,163
What the...

329
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,249
You stupid son of a bitch!

330
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,135
- Six. I'm a six.
- I'm a seven!

331
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,161
Six!

332
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,003
- Seven!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

333
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,446
Jesus Christ! One at a time!

334
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,520
You took the Lord's name in vain.

335
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,284
No, I didn't, Janet.

336
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,125
I found it very useful, actually.
Okay, Janet?

337
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,567
<i><i>Birthday girl!</i>

338
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,762
March. Jack Healy.

339
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,405
Don't get upset. I'm not here to hurt you.

340
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,839
<i>I just wanna ask you</i> a <i>question.</i>

341
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,080
Hey, no.

342
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,402
How stupid do you think I am?

343
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,846
I got a license to carry, motherfucker.

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,843
Ever since your little visit
the other day,

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,207
this little baby's gonna stay right here.

346
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,565
Fuck, fuck.

347
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,567
Look away.

348
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,566
Look“.

349
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,683
- You know there's a mirror here, right?
- Close your eyes.

350
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,490
Fucking damn it. Forget it.
You know what? Turn around.

351
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,768
- Can I open my eyes?
- Yeah, open your eyes.

352
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,124
What do you want?

353
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:50,442
I want you to find Amelia.

354
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,322
So you think these guys
are gonna hurt Amelia?

355
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,523
Sure, after they're done killing her.

356
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,609
You know, I asked around about you.

357
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:05,336
There's a couple of people I trust
say you're pretty good at this.

358
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:07,119
Well, that's surprising.
I would have thought

359
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,891
your job ended with
breaking my fucking arm.

360
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,816
Well, you know,
technically it did.

361
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:12,840
I'm off the clock.

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,330
This is a separate situation.

363
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,486
I'm not buying this nice guy act, pal.

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,289
She owes you money, doesn't she?

365
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,776
You're coming to collect?

366
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,800
You want me to finger her

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,968
so you can throw acid in her face?
Well, no.

368
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,326
No, she paid me up front,
actually, you know.

369
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,723
What it is, for me, is I like where I live
and I don't wanna move.

370
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,005
So, two days in advance.

371
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,763
$400.

372
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,690
Plus whatever the old lady's giving you.

373
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,650
Old lady? Fuck you, old lady.

374
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,405
You broke my arm. I quit, remember?

375
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,642
So call her up, get back on the case.

376
00:23:51,799 --> 00:23:53,211
Get paid twice.

377
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,849
Wow, that is very telling.

378
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,130
I'm a detective and we have a code.

379
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,361
We don't do that.

380
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,602
But interesting. Good to know.

381
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,204
- Okay.
- Good to know.

382
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,759
You were looking for Amelia, right?

383
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,443
Yes and no.

384
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,839
Excuse me?

385
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,809
My profession is very complicated, okay?

386
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,040
It's nuanced.

387
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,083
What does that mean?

388
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,730
Fuck it.

389
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,609
Last week this old broad comes to me

390
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,126
and she asks me to find her niece,
Misty Mountains.

391
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,566
Misty Mountains?

392
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,406
The porno actress? The one that died?

393
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,407
The porno young lady.

394
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:35,609
But, yeah, she died in a crash
and then two days later,

395
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,536
her aunt goes to her house
to clean out the place,

396
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,560
and lo and behold,

397
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,121
alive and well, Misty Mountains.

398
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,496
She sees her through the window.

399
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,759
She sees her get in her car.

400
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,689
- She sees her drive away.
- Bullshit.

401
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,927
Bullshit's right.
She's dead and then she's alive.

402
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,279
That's what I'm talking about.

403
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,930
It's very fucking complicated.

404
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,411
But I persevere, you know.

405
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:56,483
I run the tape through and I think,
"Okay, maybe there was a girl there."

406
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,684
Amelia? The old lady saw Amelia?

407
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:04,366
Well, look who decided
to show up for class.

408
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,606
Yeah.

409
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:07,171
There's a gate guard,

410
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,279
he keeps track
of all the cars that go in and out.

411
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:12,289
So I checked with him,
I ran the plate, I got the name.

412
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,441
And?

413
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,080
Three.

414
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,680
Three what?

415
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:21,126
Three days in advance
if you want the rest of the story.

416
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,042
Fuck you. Come on, $600?
That's fucking robbery.

417
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,361
I've only got $400.

418
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:28,647
Well, it's early.

419
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,279
You can go rob a bank if you hurry.

420
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:33,045
Jesus!

421
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,805
What are you doing here?

422
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,290
Giving you a rim job.

423
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,807
What? Rim shot.

424
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,644
- Rim shot.
- Whatever.

425
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,927
Hey, can we go one more game before...

426
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,529
You're the guy who beat up my dad.

427
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,727
<i>He'!-</i>

428
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,000
No. Sucker-punched your dad.

429
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,406
<i>Big difference. But don't worry.</i>

430
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:53,005
<i>He just did it for money.</i>

431
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,084
You beat people up
and charge money?

432
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,769
Yeah. Sad, isn't it?

433
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,285
- That's really your job?
- Yeah.

434
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,487
- No way.
- Yeah.

435
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,325
So, um, how much would you charge
to beat up my friend Janet?

436
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,891
- What?
- How much you got?

437
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,002
- Thirty bucks.
- Look, apple pie.

438
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,810
- ls she a big girl?
- She's tall. Super annoying.

439
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,923
<i>- Apple pie.</i>
- She's always mean to me.

440
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,844
This conversation is over.

441
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,161
We're just talking.

442
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:16,845
And it's over.

443
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,323
$400, that's all.

444
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,362
$400, two days.

445
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,767
We find her earlier,
I still get to keep it.

446
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,648
Done.

447
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,483
Deal. Great.

448
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,881
'Cause I already know where she is.

449
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,736
<i>Adult film star Misty Mountains,</i>

450
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:43,205
<i>shown here at last month's
Detroit auto show.</i>

451
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:44,963
High-profile case for you, right?

452
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,048
Made the newspapers.

453
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:50,240
You know, the thing about
keeping your mouth closed is

454
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,599
it prevents you from speaking.

455
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:53,171
Sure.

456
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,527
Unless, of course, you're a ventriloquist.

457
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
Fuck those guys.

458
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:58,496
You can always see their mouths moving.

459
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,681
You can what?

460
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,976
Ventriloquism, it doesn't work.

461
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,047
Sometimes.

462
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,361
Never.

463
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,365
Look at these idiots.

464
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,971
<i>Join us!</i>

465
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,563
All right. Well...

466
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,207
Goodbye.

467
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,519
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

468
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,528
What do you mean, goodbye?

469
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,682
This is Amelia's protest group.

470
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:23,489
She's in there somewhere, so have at it.

471
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,164
Wait. How do you know she's in there?

472
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,527
'Cause it's her protest group.
She started it.

473
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,047
That's the hot tip I got yesterday
before you broke my arm.

474
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,929
Yeah, but she's holed up somewhere hiding.

475
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:34,082
What makes you think she's gonna be here?

476
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,816
- That's her protest group.
- Stop saying that.

477
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:37,976
- I'd like to stop saying...
- You said that.

478
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,215
- I hear it. It's her protest group.
- I don't hear you hearing it.

479
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,684
Hey, Amelia?

480
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,922
- Amelia?
- Amelia?

481
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:48,559
- She's not here.
- She's here.

482
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,210
Amelia.

483
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,884
<i>We can't talk to you.</i>

484
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:54,087
Who said that?

485
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,891
We can't talk to you. We're dead.

486
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,451
No, I...

487
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,480
Yeah, I get it, you know.

488
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,403
Like it's very clever. I'm hip.

489
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,607
But this is actually
a really serious matter.

490
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:08,568
So is this. We've all been killed.

491
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,449
No, you haven't.

492
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,364
Fuck you, man. We're dead!

493
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,886
They can't talk to you, man. They're dead.

494
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,167
What's the protest about? Do you know?

495
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,807
Any of you know why you're protesting?

496
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,290
The air.

497
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,805
Air.

498
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,086
You're protesting the air?

499
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,401
The pollution.

500
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,442
The birds can't breathe.

501
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,801
So all of you died
because of the pollution?

502
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,961
Right.

503
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:35,124
What about the gas masks?
They didn't save you?

504
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,362
This is fucking... All right.

505
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,444
- Fucker.
- Sorry.

506
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,602
I thought you were dead.

507
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,242
Look, Amelia, we know you're here,
so this is very...

508
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,721
Hey, dickhead. She's not here.

509
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,802
She's not here
because of her boyfriend.

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,641
Her boyfriend died,
like, really died, like, three days ago.

511
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,604
<i>- Her boyfriend died?
- Yeah.</i>

512
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:00,800
So where is she?

513
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,404
Sorry, can't help you. We're dead.

514
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,243
God damn it.

515
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,449
All right, which one of you cock and balls
wants to make 20 bucks, huh?

516
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,371
Up here, Chet?

517
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,884
Yeah, make a left here.

518
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,804
It's here. Just pull over.

519
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,724
It's right here. On the left.

520
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,882
Right... Look. Left.

521
00:29:33,079 --> 00:29:34,444
Right here.

522
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,808
<i>This is Dean's house.</i>

523
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,763
Amelia's boyfriend, Dean.

524
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,041
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

525
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,167
I know, it's crazy.

526
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,368
What the fuck is this, Chet?

527
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,528
This place looks so much bigger now.

528
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,160
Do you even really know Amelia, Chet?

529
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,050
Uh, yeah, well, like kind of like
mainly through Dean.

530
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,123
Dean was a filmmaker. Um...

531
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,890
Kind of like experimental kinds
of films. Um...

532
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,602
That's actually like kind of how we met,
'cause I'm kind of in the business myself.

533
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:10,965
Huh? What do you do?

534
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,400
Projectionalist.

535
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,890
<i>Yeah, anyway, um, Dean had</i>

536
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:17,730
this whole room,
like, filled with film stock.

537
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,400
One day it just went up,
you know...

538
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,122
And, uh, yeah, it cost the guy
his life and his life's work.

539
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,931
So, kind of, I don't know,
kind of makes you think, right?

540
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,240
Not really, Chet.

541
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:33,448
Hey, kid. Kid.

542
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,961
What?

543
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:37,087
You know the guy who lived here?

544
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,288
Maybe. What's it to you?

545
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,130
Hey, he'll give you $20 if you answer.

546
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,691
I didn't say that.

547
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:45,683
20 bucks, man, or you can blow.

548
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:46,840
Wow.

549
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,404
Thank you.

550
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,602
Yeah, I knew the dude.

551
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,483
Filmmaker dude.

552
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,289
Saw him making a film last month.

553
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,884
Experimental films, right?

554
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:01,923
I guess. More like a nudie film.

555
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,242
Did you see a girl
about 5'8", dark hair, named Amelia?

556
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,003
Nope.

557
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,969
- Saw that famous chick.
- What famous chick?

558
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,122
Dead one. Porn star. Misty something.

559
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,601
- You saw Misty Mountains here?
- Yeah.

560
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:16,047
Talked to the producer.

561
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,728
No, his name was Sid... Sid Hatrack. Yeah.

562
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,483
Nobody's name is Hatrack.

563
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,164
Whatever. Tried to get a job.

564
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:27,967
I offered to show my dick
'cause I got a big dick.

565
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,970
- Oh, right.
- Yeah.

566
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,960
Well, that's very nice.

567
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Yeah.

568
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,963
You sure you didn't see another girl?

569
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,527
Nope. You guys wanna see my dick?

570
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,250
Nobody wants to see your dick, dude.

571
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,167
- Twenty bucks?
- We already paid you 20...

572
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,605
What am I saying?

573
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,046
Oh, all right.

574
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,326
<i>Fags!</i>

575
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,279
Hey, kid.

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,520
What?

577
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,608
What was the name of that film?

578
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:00,690
I don't know. Uh...

<i>How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?</i>

580
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,000
There it is.

581
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,201
"Do you wanna see my dick?" Unbelievable.

582
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:15,599
This is what I'm talking about.

583
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,960
It's over.

<i>The days of ladies and gentlemen are over.</i>

585

This is what Holly's
looking down the barrel of.

586
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,286
This is what she's dealing with,
the fucking Chets and that idiot.

587
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,125
Well, one thing we know for sure,
something funny's going on.

588
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,044
No, there's not. No.

589
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,804
A guy burned up. It happens.

590
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,039
It happened three days ago,

591
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,124
the exact same day
Amelia fell off my radar.

592
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,691
Your radar?

593
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,489
<i>Let me tell you what two days
of detective work looks like, okay?</i>

594
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,130
You drive around like an asshole.

595
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:45,455
You're gonna spend half the time

596
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,200
interviewing the fucking Chets
of the world.

597
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,284
<i>You spend the other half trying
to translate fuckwit to English.</i>

598
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,359
And when it's over,
the only thing that's changed

599
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,249
is that the sun went down twice.

600
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,615
And nothing ever works out,
is that what you're trying to say?

601
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,641
Never.

602
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,131
But you get paid.

Hatrack. Look at that.

609
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,365
What?

610
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:15,401
<i>Sid Shattuck. Who's that?</i>

<i>Savage Sid, the porn king.</i>

612
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,650
Well, he didn't burn up,
so let's go talk to him.

613
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,166
I said I'd like to speak
to Sid personally.

614
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:26,846
<i>I'm asking after</i> a <i>friend of ours, Amelia.</i>

Why don't we invite him in?

617
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,285
No animals in the house, sweetheart.

618
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,964
Yeah, I'm here.

619
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,762
<i>Say that again.</i>

00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,400
Okay. Thank you very much.

621
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,722
Is that the number you got
for Sid Shattuck?

622
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,644
Yeah. Can you hang this up?

623
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,090
They're getting ready for a party
and I asked about Amelia

624
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,651
and they said she'd be right back.

625
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,842
Back? Like she's been staying there?

626
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,365
Yeah.

627
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,170
- So you found her?
- Maybe.

628
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,883
Can you stay at one of your friends?

629
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:05,041
I can stay with Jessica, but...

630
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,769
- You're going to a Party?
- No.

631
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,083
I'm going to a big party. Jacket.

632
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,041
Sweetheart, it's a job. I gotta take it.

633
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,925
If I don't, we won't get to live
in such a nice house.

634
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,490
I hate this house.

635
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,164
We're not even supposed to be here.

636
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,164
- Go to Janet's.
- Jessica's.

637
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,367
- Which one's she?
- The one with the brown hair.

638
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:28,925
Glass eye?

639
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:30,411
The one that you like.

640
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,289
And like the Hitler-stache?

641
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,847
I'm friends with a cop, you know.

642
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,047
Is that so?

643
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,248
He likes my dad a lot, too.

644
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,641
Maybe they should get married.

645
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,159
So, you know the old lady, right?

646
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,481
Did you believe her?

647
00:34:58,639 --> 00:34:59,800
What about?

648
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,615
When she said she saw
Misty alive that night,

649
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:02,686
did you believe her?

650
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,170
God, no.

651
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,208
- She's blind as a bat.
- Uh-huh.

652
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:08,887
She has actual coke bottles for glasses.

653
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,920
<i>You paint a mustache
on a Volkswagen, she says,</i>

654
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:13,565
<i>"Boy, that Omar Sharif sure runs fast."</i>

655
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:37,929
Jesus tap-dancing Christ!

656
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,081
All I told him was that
if you want me to do that,

657
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,362
then don't eat the asparagus.

658
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,726
<i>Why?</i>

659
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:55,327
I know what you're gonna say,
but since I'm already here,

660
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,960
you might as well
take me in with you, right?

661
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:06,322
Um, I can't take your car like that.

662
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,047
- Stop it.
- What?

663
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:11,851
Stop it. Stop it. Dad.

664
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,762
Dad, there's like whores here and stuff.

665
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,215
Sweetheart, how many times
have I told you?

666
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,445
Don't say "and stuff."

667
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:19,096
Just say, "Dad, there are whores here."

668
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,125
Well, there's like a ton.
Wait. No. I can help you.

669
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,809
<i>Seriously? I came all this way.</i>

670
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,371
I love you.

671
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,963
It's not my nose that grows.

672
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,483
Whoa. Well, we know Mary Jane turned up.

673
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,641
Who's that?

674
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,246
Mary Jane. Marijuana. Pot.

675
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,775
Place reeks of it. They're smoking it.

676
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,121
- Oh, yeah. I can't smell.
- What?

677
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,576
I got hit in the head a while back.

678
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,806
I lost my sense of smell.

679
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,003
You can't smell?

680
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,126
- Yeah.
- Wow.

681
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,615
You're a detective who can't smell?

682
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,641
Yeah.

683
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,525
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.

684
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:26,291
Wow, that's really insensitive.

685
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:31,175
Look, if Amelia doesn't show,

686
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:32,849
we still got Shattuck, right?

687
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,163
But if things get rough, I'm injured.

688
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,376
- So you're gonna have to handle it.
- Right.

689
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,416
Well, you know, blind his son,
or, you know, whatever it is.

690
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,775
You work your magic. Where you going?

691
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,371
I think this is gonna work better,
faster, if we split up.

692
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,646
- Okay?
- What?

693
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,371
You see a guy with a blue face,
you come and find me.

694
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,530
You wanna smoke?

695
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:56,846
Drink?

696
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,364
No, I...

697
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,490
Hey, uh... Sorry.

698
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,324
It's the killer bees.

699
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,840
That's what you gotta worry about.

700
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,815
<i>You know why they call them
killer bees, don't you?</i>

701
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,568
'Cause they'll kill you.

702
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,085
Good point.

703
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,327
- Excuse me.
- Hello, handsome.

704
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,005
You, uh, seem to have a very
good vantage point up there.

705
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,844
- I lost my sister.
- Yeah.

706
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,922
She's got dark hair, your height.

707
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,411
She's wearing clothes, but...

708
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,164
<i>Come on, baby, keep dancing!</i>

709
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
Answers to Amelia.

710
00:38:51,559 --> 00:38:53,324
Hey. You want another drink?

711
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,844
Just leave the girl alone.

712
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:21,201
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey.

713
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,726
I'm Amelia. She's about dark hair.

714
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,891
Answers to the call of the wild.

715
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,295
- I'm just kidding.
- What?

716
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,215
I forgot her name,
but, you know, if you see you,

717
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:34,960
just if you see,
let me know and tell me my name.

718
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,646
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

719
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,882
- You want a drink?
- No, thanks.

720
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Ow!

721
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,135
Holly. Hey, hey.

722
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:31,161
I don't think you should be watching this.

723
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,681
What's it to you, idiot?
Move. You're in my way.

724
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,364
Listen, dickweed,
that little girl's a minor.

725
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:41,576
Where do you get off showing
her stuff like this anyway?

726
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,965
He's not showing it to me.

727
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:45,523
She put it on.

728
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,840
Well, she shouldn't be
watching stuff like this either.

729
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,210
Watching it?

730
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,043
Man, I'm in it.

731
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:56,445
Oh, right. Look, go home, right?

732
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:59,291
Your dad told you to go home. Go home.

733
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,563
By the way, I'm supposed
to meet someone here.

734
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:06,291
Do you by any chance
know a girl named Amelia?

735
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,050
I think she did a film with Sid Shattuck.

736
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:11,646
Don't know her, but Sid's gross.

737
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,722
He told me this one chick
was his sister, right,

738
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,166
and then a few days later
I walk in on them

739
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,561
and they're all doing anal and stuff.

740
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,050
Don't say, "and stuff."

741
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,168
Just say, "They're doing anal."

742
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:30,684
<i>Hey, Pocahontas!</i>

743
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:42,161
<i>He'!-</i>

744
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,606
I'm a cowboy.

745
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,920
And you?

746
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:46,490
Pocahontas.

747
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,445
What do you do?

748
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,920
- I do a little bit of acting.
- Me, too.

749
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,445
- Hey, shoot me.
- What?

750
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:54,295
Shoot me, shoot me, shoot me.
Fucking shoot me.

751
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,445
Bang!

752
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,840
That's pretty good.

753
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,728
- Bang!
- Oh.

754
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,284
<i>Bang!</i>

755
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,331
Son of a...

756
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,045
Whoo! That was great!

757
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,925
Shit.

758
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,041
Shit!

759
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,769
My fucking gun.

760
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,722
Jesus.

761
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:45,369
You scared me.

762
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,527
Do I know you?

763
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,168
I'm not gonna hurt you.

764
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:55,641
No, I'm just looking for my gun.

765
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,005
So...

766
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,690
I got it!

767
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,001
So...

768
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,764
There you go, March.

769
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,365
March, March, he's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can.

770
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:28,690
March.

771
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,244
March!

772
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,650
<i>March!</i>

773
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:34,728
Healy. Healy!

774
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,405
Healy!

775
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,405
Healy!

776
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,927
<i>Healy!</i>

777
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,690
Come on! Come down here!

778
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,126
What the fuck are you doing down there?

779
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,282
Get down here!

780
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,121
- Healy!
- It's all right, man.

781
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,610
What?

782
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,760
Oh, fuck.

783
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,360
- I'm gonna be sick, throw up.
- Oh!

784
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:00,967
Who the fuck is that?

785
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,286
It's Sid Shattuck.

786
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,686
- That's Sid Shattuck.
- Don't tell me that.

787
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:18,646
Oh, no. Shit!

788
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,483
- What's going on?
- Shit!

789
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:23,119
Everybody worked
on this Amelia flick, right?

790
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,800
The boyfriend, then Misty,

791
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,882
now Sid. They're all dead.

792
00:45:28,039 --> 00:45:30,440
Before we go solving
the crime of the century,

793
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,806
let's deal with
the fucking rotting corpse.

794
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,175
What the fuck
are we gonna do with this guy?

795
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,565
- We gotta get rid of him.
- Why?

796
00:45:35,719 --> 00:45:36,766
I lost my gun.

797
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,849
There was a girl. She can place me.

798
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,128
All right, we got a plan.

799
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,291
We'll throw up, we'll get rid of the body.

800
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,965
Right.

801
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,967
<i>He'!-</i>

802
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:51,121
Hi.

803
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,489
Are you the one who's been
asking about Amelia?

804
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,641
Uh, I may have said something.

805
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,483
What do you want with her?

806
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,847
Um, she's my sister, see.

807
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,809
Yeah, um, I need to warn her.

808
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,485
Two freaky guys were coming around.

809
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:08,483
They were all like,
"Where is she? Where is she?"

810
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,449
It scared me kinda.

811
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:11,931
Well, you seem like a decent kid.

812
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,485
I'll take you to her.

813
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:15,601
- Come on.
- Okay.

814
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,606
What I can't figure out is how you saw him
from all the way up there.

815
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,047
You didn't fall down
the fucking hill, did you?

816
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,280
Did you fall down the hill?

817
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,521
I had, like, two, three drinks, tops.

818
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:28,976
Yeah, that's why you can't walk straight.

819
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,815
Oh, excuse me. I'm carrying a dead body
and I have his schwantz in my face.

820
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,001
So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.

821
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,048
You can't even say Baryshnikov.

822
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,201
You did, didn't you?

823
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,123
You fell down that fucking hill.

824
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,487
You get drunk, you lose your gun,

825
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:44,371
you take a header off the balcony,
and now you're gonna tell me

826
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:48,047
it's like a hallowed,
time-honored detective ploy, right?

827
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,679
It was very slippery up there, Okay?

828
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:51,563
I was in the pool.

829
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:53,483
- You were in the pool?
- Yeah.

830
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:54,686
<i>Why'?</i>

831
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,648
I had to question the mermaids.

832
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,326
What were you doing while I was working?

833
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,210
- Thank you.
- Let's get rid of this guy.

834
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,521
Oh, God.

835
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,126
Oh, God! My leg! My leg!

836
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,679
<i>What is that?</i>

837
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,326
Run.

838
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:21,048
Hop in back, sweetie.

839
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:25,090
This one says she's Amelia's sister.

840
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,250
Is that a fact?

841
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,766
Good times.

842
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,289
L... There's someone out looking for me.

843
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,800
- Really?
- Yeah. I...

844
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:42,007
Hey, hey, hey. No. Don't touch that.

845
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,806
Hey. Why didn't you watch my movie?

846
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,920
- Hey, goodbye.
- Come and watch with me.

847
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,615
- Have a great night.
- Come on. It's still playing.

848
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:55,403
Have a great night. Bye.

849
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:39,295
Excuse me, excuse me.

850
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,056
- I need to go right now.
- Don't touch...

851
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:42,081
Get away from me!

852
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:43,655
<i>I need my keys. I need my car.</i>

853
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:44,806
Hurry.

854
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,050
Don't fucking move.

855
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:48,610
Hurry. <i>I</i> need my <i>keys.</i>

856
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,521
Hello? Please! Hurry, hurry.

857
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:54,766
<i>Now!</i>

858
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,043
Fuck! Motherfucker, my fucking hand!

859
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:06,567
Amelia! Run!

860
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:21,050
Drive the fucking car!

861
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:30,764
Hey, man.

862
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,128
The girl in your trunk,
she was in that car.

863
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:43,201
<i>Johnny's car!</i>

864
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,487
<i>Hey, man,
what are you doing with my car?</i>

865
00:49:45,639 --> 00:49:47,416
That's Johnny's car!

866
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,405
Motherfucker!

867
00:50:11,239 --> 00:50:12,365
<i>Oh, Shit.</i>

868
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,684
I swear to God, you get up,
I'll shoot you in the cock.

869
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,280
I can pay you.

870
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,806
Trying to negotiate with me?

871
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,961
You'll never see me again.

872
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,405
Where are you gonna be?

873
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:41,605
Michigan.

874
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:43,690
Michigan works.

875
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,967
You okay? Does the car still go?

876
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,724
Well, stop fucking around. Come on!

877
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,969
Fuck!

878
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,199
Freeze!

879
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,364
You guys are fast.

880
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,681
Whoo!

881
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:50,121
There's a...

882
00:51:56,199 --> 00:51:57,530
Holy shit!

883
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,722
- Come on.
- Wait, wait.

884
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:05,016
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

885
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,724
<i>He's hurt. We need to help him.</i>

886
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,882
Are you crazy? Stay away from him!

887
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,043
Just hang on. We need to help him.

888
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,605
It's okay.

889
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,001
You're gonna be all right.

890
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:37,969
I'll get help.

891
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,085
It's all right.

892
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,565
A car hit him. We need an ambulance.

893
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,001
Holly, go and see
if you can flag somebody down.

894
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:49,161
He's in a bad way.

895
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,085
You.

896
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,130
Yeah, me.

897
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,204
You ever hear of John Boy?

898
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,362
By now he's heard of you.

899
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,762
They're flying him in.

900
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,250
Now he's gonna kill that private cop

901
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,208
and his whole fucking family.

902
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,601
<i>And then he's gonna come for you.</i>

903
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,603
You ain't got long to live.

904
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,724
Well, buddy,

905
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,125
none of us do.

906
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,324
Healy, there's no one here.

907
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,050
He didn't make it.

908
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:15,681
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

909
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,525
And that'll be the cops.

910
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:29,681
<i>Okay, Holly...</i>

911
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,175
What do you want me
to do with them?

912
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:32,880
Look, pal, you already got our statements.

913
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,690
Can I go see my daughter now?

914
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,365
Sir, I was told to keep you here,
so I'm keeping you here.

915
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:39,568
Just following orders.

916
00:54:39,719 --> 00:54:42,007
You know who else was
just following orders? Hitler.

917
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,880
Officer.

918
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,164
You're Mr. March, I think.

919
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,721
And you are...
Wait, I know you.

920
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,327
You're the guy.
The diner guy, right?

921
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:58,204
From last year, right?

922
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,565
Yeah.

923
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah. My name is Tally.

924
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,407
If you'll follow me,
my boss would like a word. Please.

925
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,884
I'm sorry. The diner guy?

926
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,646
I'll tell you later. Don't worry about it.

927
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,003
How do you do?

928
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:20,048
About this good most of the time.

929
00:55:20,199 --> 00:55:23,090
My name is Judith Kuttner.

930
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:25,641
I work for the Department of Justice.

931
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,525
Okay. Well, that explains
basically nothing.

932
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:30,768
I'm Amelia's mother.

933
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:37,045
<i>Holly, are you still frowning?</i>

934
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:38,929
<i>What's in my hand?</i>

935
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,844
What?

936
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,842
<i>I know how you do that.</i>

937
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:46,365
Hello.

938
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,565
Sit.

939
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,923
First of all, I wanna say thank you.

940
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,764
We've been watching interviews

941
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,445
and it sounds like
you might have saved my daughter's life.

942
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:58,489
That was mostly Holly.

943
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,762
- His daughter.
- It's genetics.

944
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:05,250
Would you like a mint?

945
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,485
Uh, yeah.

946
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,088
<i>I need your help.</i>

947
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,201
But I wanna know if I can trust you.

948
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,842
I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know,
you might not have much choice.

949
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,570
Well, my situation is very delicate.

950
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:24,199
Hey, that's where I know
you from, right? The TV.

951
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,528
You're prosecuting that car company thing.

952
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,409
The lawsuit for the catalytic converter.

953
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:31,402
Yes. That's half my day.

954
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,802
The other half I spend on pornography.

955
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,164
- Hmm.
- What kind? Like which films?

956
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,367
- What's your favorite?
- No, no.

957
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,842
Uh, anti. Anti-porn.

958
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:43,724
- Right.
- Like a crusader.

959
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,206
Should I be writing this down?

960
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,849
<i>Yeah, write it down.</i>

961
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:51,405
<i>The Vegas mob is trying to
spread its porn operation</i>

962
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:53,164
to Hollywood Boulevard.

963
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,402
<i>And I'm doing
everything I can to stop it.</i>

964
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:56,925
Thank you.

965
00:56:58,239 --> 00:56:59,969
Porn is bad.

966
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:02,248
Something I don't understand.
Your daughter,

967
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,527
she did a film with Sid Shattuck.

968
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:07,445
<i>Now, why would she do that
when she knows that's just gonna be</i>

969
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,489
extremely professionally
embarrassing for you?

970
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:11,688
'Cause she wanted to. She lashes out.

971
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,159
We have a difficult relationship.

972
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,202
Mothers and daughters, it's tough.

973
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,327
But there's no film, not anymore.

974
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,164
There was a fire.

975
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:20,320
Um...

976
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:23,007
- A friend of Amelia's, he...
- Dean.

977
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:25,240
Yeah, we went to his house.

978
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,639
Well, what's left of his house.

979
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,242
Mrs. Kuttner, why do you think
everyone involved with this film is dying?

980
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,289
I have no idea, Mr. March.

981
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:34,090
I Wish I did.

982
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:36,846
I only know that Amelia's in danger.

983
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,655
Why don't you put her
in protective custody?

984
00:57:38,679 --> 00:57:41,126
<i>I mean, after tonight
she's probably very scared.</i>

985
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,123
She might wanna be at home.

986
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,284
She doesn't trust me.

987
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,880
She thinks I am the government.

988
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:51,519
She thinks I'm behind all of this.

989
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:55,126
Somewhere she's out there
and she won't call home

990
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,563
because she thinks
her mother's going to have her killed.

991
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,648
Here. You wanna use that?

992
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,130
No, thank you.

993
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,481
I wanna hire you both.

994
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,565
Please, find her, protect her.

995
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:15,371
Okay, you can hire us,
but we're not cheap.

996
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:19,161
This is very intensive work
and something like this,

997
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:23,608
I'd say couldn't do it
for less than $5,000.

998
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:26,320
<i>Okay.</i>

999
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,641
Yes, I got it.

1000
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,768
Okay, I gotta get mine now.

1001
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,047
Can I take this?

1002
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:38,400
Fine.

1003
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,927
Does Tally have one of...
Shall we have hers as well?

1004
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:44,090
Just in case you're not...

1005
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:46,971
You know, we need
to get in touch with somebody.

1006
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:03,960
<i>So what's this?</i>

1007
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:06,487
World's biggest ashtray?

1008
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,809
Fuck it, it's... It's a rental.

1009
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:13,481
We're only here until we
rebuild the old place anyway.

1010
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:15,324
Rebuild?

1011
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,686
Yeah.

1012
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,648
It burned down.

1013
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,168
<i>Hey, you know, somethings
actually bugging me.</i>

1014
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,527
I found this in Shattuck's office.

1015
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:30,168
What is that, a pig?

1016
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,721
- No, it's a pink cow.
- Oh, it's a cow.

1017
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,967
When Amelia gave me your address,

1018
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:36,615
she gave it to me
on a piece of paper like this,

1019
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:37,800
handwriting like that.

1020
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,639
- I think you're onto something.
- Mmm-hmm.

1021
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:42,326
Can we talk about it tomorrow afternoon?

1022
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,610
Yeah, we can do that.

1023
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,170
Thanks.

1024
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,726
Hey, aren't you that diner guy?

1025
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,536
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1026
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,561
I gotta know.

1027
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:58,016
I don't wanna get into it right now.

1028
00:59:58,039 --> 00:59:59,086
You gotta get into it.

1029
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,880
I gotta know. You're the diner guy.

1030
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,963
- All right.
- Yes.

1031
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,802
- All right, about a year ago...
- Yes.

1032
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,525
I <i>was at</i> a <i>diner in Hollywood</i>

1033
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:12,206
and this asshole with a shotgun
started threatening people.

1034
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,646
<i>I</i> love it.

1035
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,239
It's the best story I've ever heard.

1036
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,844
<i>So I did something about it.</i>

1037
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,047
<i>I acted.</i>

1038
01:00:18,199 --> 01:00:20,885
I didn't plan to, I didn't, you know.

1039
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,806
<i>L</i> just did it.

1040
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,324
<i>I took that guy out.</i>

1041
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:30,601
<i>I didn't even get paid for it.</i>

1042
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,081
<i>So I ended up</i>

1043
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:35,641
with a bullet in the bicep
and 500 bucks of hospital bills.

1044
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,369
It was stupid, really.

1045
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,481
When I think about it,

1046
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,961
it was the best day of my life.

1047
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,641
Just for a moment I felt useful.

1048
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,567
All right.

1049
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,842
"Had Mademoiselle Blanche
been in England before?"

1050
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,606
"What part of France did she come from?"

1051
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:22,684
<i>"Mademoiselle Blanche
replied politely but with reserve."</i>

1052
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,364
<i>He'!-</i>

1053
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,121
<i>He'!-</i>

1054
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:32,641
You've got your foot in the toilet.

1055
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,130
I have?

1056
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,570
Now you're getting the carpet all wet.

1057
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,206
Was this your room?

1058
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,362
No, it was Mom and Dad's.

1059
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:46,969
Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.

1060
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:49,804
Does it look rebuilt to you?

1061
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,927
Not especially.

1062
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:56,449
Dad barely ever comes here.
He feels guilty, I guess.

1063
01:01:56,599 --> 01:01:58,204
Because?

1064
01:01:58,400 --> 01:01:59,400
Hmm?

1065
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,610
Oh, the fire.

1066
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,646
Mom kept on complaining
about a leak in the furnace,

1067
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:10,646
but Dad, you know,
he's got his nose thing,

1068
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,121
so he couldn't smell the gas.

1069
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,041
Anyways, I should probably
get back to my book.

1070
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:21,451
All right.

1071
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:28,121
Mr. Healy?

1072
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,721
Are you a bad person?

1073
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:38,481
What did you do to that man tonight?

1074
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:43,168
Did you kill him?

1075
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,010
Of course not.

1076
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,409
That's good.

1077
01:02:52,119 --> 01:02:54,771
I knew you couldn't
do something like that.

1078
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,885
Don't stay up too late, all right?

1079
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,206
Shit.

1080
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,856
I didn't know what time you'd get here.

1081
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,210
You said afternoon.

1082
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:40,284
Well, uh, we were at the bank
getting your money.

1083
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:44,929
There it is, half,
minus a few 100, you know,

1084
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:46,844
for, uh, that car that we crashed.

1085
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,889
I thought you'd wanna chip in for that.

1086
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,405
Sure.

1087
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:52,726
What do you think?

1088
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:55,880
- It's purple.
- It's maroon.

1089
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:00,681
We stopped at a bar.
That's why we're late.

1090
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,130
<i>So, Amelia's note.</i>

1091
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,489
Burbank Airport. Western flight D.

1092
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:10,130
I figure she's trying to skip town.

1093
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,445
How do you wanna do this?

1094
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,121
I don't know. I say we wait
a couple of days, call Kuttner

1095
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,170
and see if we can squeeze
a second installment out of her.

1096
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,208
A second installment?

1097
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:23,168
<i>You don't wanna call too soon.</i>

1098
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,041
Gotta act like you're onto something,
like you've been working hard.

1099
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:31,603
Then, day three, ask for more money.

1100
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,608
Well, she's putting a negative spin on it,
but, yeah, that's the idea.

1101
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,603
Kuttner paid us. Me.

1102
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,329
She paid me to do a job, right?

1103
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:41,760
- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- I respect that.

1104
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,684
That's why I'll lie to her.

1105
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:47,764
Hey, I shelled out 400 bucks
for a detective.

1106
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,126
Someone who finds clues, huh?

1107
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,402
I found Sid Shattuck's corpse, didn't I?

1108
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:54,561
Found it?

1109
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,929
<i>You fell on it!</i>

1110
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:00,646
I guess I don't understand
why we're not celebrating.

1111
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:02,085
<i>I mean, we just got paid.</i>

1112
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:04,083
We're all having a drink in the afternoon.

1113
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:09,326
What?

1114
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,481
Forget about it, all right?

1115
01:05:13,079 --> 01:05:14,280
Oh, <i>would</i> you just...

1116
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,721
Would you hold on for a goddamn second?

1117
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:19,248
You're the world's worst detective.

1118
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,724
- I'm the worst?
- Yeah.

1119
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,210
The world's worst?

1120
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:25,929
Didn't you hear me the first time?

1121
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,161
Got a cool ad, though.

1122
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:30,768
So...

1123
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,760
Why do you have to be such a fuck-up, huh?

1124
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,367
You go around and you drink
and you lie and stuff and people hate you!

1125
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:39,409
Sweetheart, don't say, "and stuff."
Just say...

1126
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:41,800
I hate you!

1127
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,320
That works.

1128
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,362
I'll find the girl myself.

1129
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,735
You're gonna find her yourself. Okay.

1130
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,976
<i>Well, say hi to her when you do.</i>

1131
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,001
I will.

1132
01:05:51,159 --> 01:05:53,056
'Course, you're not gonna
find her at the airport,

1133
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,525
seeing as how it's not a flight.

1134
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,922
- Did he stop?
- Yeah.

1135
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:04,289
Your note, look at it. It's not a flight.

1136
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,927
<i>Every airport has
an overflight curfew from 10:00 to 6:00,</i>

1137
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,081
<i>Burbank included.</i>

1138
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:13,403
And that top number is today's date
but reversed like the European way,

1139
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:16,927
which makes sense when you look at FLT
and you think it's not "flight,"

1140
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:20,083
it's probably "flat," like apartment.

1141
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,206
And Burbank APT West?

1142
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:26,362
Burbank Apartments West.

1143
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:30,411
It's a dump. Fuck it, I'll show you.

1144
01:06:30,679 --> 01:06:31,920
Holly, go to Janet's this time.

1145
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:33,119
- But for real.
- Jessica's.

1146
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:36,170
Jessica's. We've gotta go to work.

1147
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,925
- Do you want your keys?
- I'm driving.

1148
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,684
Excuse me.

1149
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,407
We're looking for the Burbank Apartments.

1150
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,369
Oh, they're gone.

1151
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:06,887
Tore them babies down, um,
going on about two years now.

1152
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,923
To the airport, then?

1153
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,775
Well, they used to have
an overflight curfew.

1154
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,215
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.

1155
01:07:21,239 --> 01:07:22,240
- They did.
- Yeah.

1156
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:23,936
And they still should
if they changed them.

1157
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,565
They should, they should change them back.

1158
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:33,121
- Pull over.
- What?

1159
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:34,884
- Pull over.
- Hey, what the fuck?

1160
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:41,088
<i>The Western Hotel.</i>

1161
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,204
The Burbank Airport Western Hotel.

1162
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,646
She's meeting somebody.

1163
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,001
Okay.

1164
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,320
Evening. What can I get you?

1165
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,483
Information.
Have you seen this girl?

1166
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:01,960
She probably came in
in the last half hour.

1167
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,121
Hey, I just work here.

1168
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,976
Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
That's why I'm asking you.

1169
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,402
Hmm. Memory gets a little foggy, you know.

1170
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,523
What's in it for me?

1171
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:12,681
He'll stop doing it.

1172
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,887
Doing what?

1173
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,041
Ow!

1174
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:18,202
- That.
- Fuck!

1175
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,369
Now, we can do this
the easy way, or we can...

1176
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,363
We're currently doing it the easy way.

1177
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:26,010
Okay. Jesus.

1178
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:28,564
The penthouse.

1179
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:31,326
She's in the penthouse, top floor.

1180
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,760
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

1181
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,001
Guys, listen.

1182
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:37,323
You don't go up there,
all right? Trust me.

1183
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:39,528
These New York guys are up there.

1184
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:40,886
Uh, business guys.

1185
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:43,007
<i>They got fucking bodyguards.</i>

1186
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:44,524
Kind of had their balls removed.

1187
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,766
What's that called? Huh?

1188
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,251
Marriage?

1189
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:50,407
Yeah. Uh...

1190
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,047
Just chill here, you know.
She's gotta come back down.

1191
01:08:54,199 --> 01:08:56,009
Have a couple of cold ones on me?

1192
01:08:56,159 --> 01:08:57,207
Oh, not for me.

1193
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,855
He makes
a strong argument, though.

1194
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,689
You see? Reasonable. Very reasonable.

1195
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,046
Now, your buddy,

1196
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,003
that was the problem,
he wasn't reasonable.

1197
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:05,326
Our buddy?

1198
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:06,815
<i>Yeah, we don't have friends.</i>

1199
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,046
The other guy looking for Amelia,
he wasn't with you?

1200
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,680
Where'd he go?

1201
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:12,576
Got in the elevator
right before you guys came in.

1202
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,250
Did you get a name?

1203
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:15,970
John something.

1204
01:09:16,119 --> 01:09:17,855
Did you actually witness him
getting into the elevator?

1205
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,121
No, it was told to me
by a wise old Indian.

1206
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:22,442
<i>Of course I fucking witnessed it.</i>

1207
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,283
- Right.
- What the hell's going on?

1208
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:25,487
Oh, it just makes sense.

1209
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,250
- It connects up.
- What makes sense?

1210
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:30,323
John Boy. Oh, just something
that Blueface mentioned, yeah.

1211
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,800
What do you mean, he mentioned?

1212
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,121
Mentioned how?

1213
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:34,520
Oh, you know, he...

1214
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,170
"There's a guy coming to kill you."

1215
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,686
That kind of crap. Yeah.

1216
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:41,411
We should probably just stay here.

1217
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,765
Smart move.

1218
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,804
Unless, of course, he's up there
killing her right now.

1219
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,439
Nobody's getting killed
at the Burbank Airport Hotel.

1220
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,170
Because?

1221
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:54,481
- That would be national news.
- Yeah, so?

1222
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,655
Oh, so when's the last time
you were on national news?

1223
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,045
- February.
- Really?

1224
01:09:58,199 --> 01:09:59,850
- Yeah.
- For what?

1225
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,685
- I got shot, in a diner.
- Where?

1226
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,451
In my arm. I told you this last night.

1227
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:07,640
We should call the cops.

1228
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,881
No. It'll take too long.

1229
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:10,121
I mean, she could die.

1230
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:12,646
You just said
it was the right move to stay down here.

1231
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,201
No, I said smart move. Different.

1232
01:10:31,239 --> 01:10:32,570
Munich.

1233
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:35,609
What?

1234
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,761
A guy without his balls.

1235
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,002
It's a Munich.

1236
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:45,250
Munich is a city in Germany.

1237
01:10:45,399 --> 01:10:48,643
München. Munich. Yeah.

1238
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,086
Right.

1239
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,721
Hitler only had one ball.

1240
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,880
All right, here we go.

1241
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:14,680
<i>Hey!</i> <i>Whoa!</i>

1242
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,001
Oh, shit.

1243
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:51,525
What are we doing?

1244
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,841
I can't just leave.

1245
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,239
<i>Why'?</i>

1246
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:56,083
She's in danger, man.

1247
01:11:56,239 --> 01:11:58,287
- We have to do something about it.
- She's dead.

1248
01:11:58,439 --> 01:12:00,090
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- Come on!

1249
01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:01,416
- She's not dead.
- Open your eyes, man.

1250
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:02,440
You don't know that!

1251
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,055
- She's fucking dead!
- You don't know she's...

1252
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,006
What are you doing here?

1253
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:35,610
Holy shit, you got her.

1254
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,159
You're supposed to be at Jessica's.

1255
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:38,560
<i>Yeah, sorry, Mr. March.</i>

1256
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:40,966
My sister kicked us out.
She's having a guy over.

1257
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:42,159
Your sister's such a slut.

1258
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:43,930
Yeah, I know.

1259
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:48,440
Hello?

1260
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:50,564
<i>Amelia.</i>

1261
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,966
Should you shake her shoulder? Maybe...

1262
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,962
You know, my brother used to flick my ear.

1263
01:12:55,119 --> 01:12:56,280
Like that. I hated that.

1264
01:12:56,439 --> 01:12:57,695
- We shouldn't be violent.
- You got a brother?

1265
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,855
- You could just hit her.
- Yeah.

1266
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,000
- Really?
- Like really hard.

1267
01:13:00,039 --> 01:13:01,376
- I've got a family.
- It's not practical.

1268
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:04,404
<i>We probably shouldn't hit her
if we want her to talk to us.</i>

1269
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,163
It's okay.

1270
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:08,095
You were supposed
to get those guys off of me.

1271
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:09,815
Do you know who they were?
Do you know who sent them?

1272
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:12,649
Yeah. It was my mother.

1273
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,684
Would you mind starting
from the top because...

1274
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,922
- Why? It doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, it doesn't matter?

1275
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:27,047
You just shot at us. I think it matters.

1276
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:29,042
Okay, okay. I made a film.

1277
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,567
I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.

1278
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,560
And the idea was
that we were gonna, you know,

1279
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,248
like make this experimental film,
like an artistic film.

1280
01:13:39,399 --> 01:13:41,686
- Porno film.
- It's not a porno.

1281
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:46,962
Look, do you even know who my mother is?

1282
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:48,770
Yes, we do.

1283
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:51,047
We've actually met your mother.

1284
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:52,935
What did she tell you,
that I'm crazy?

1285
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,247
That I was just lashing out?

1286
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:56,695
Something like that.
She might have mentioned...

1287
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:00,167
Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal.

1288
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,560
She's one of them.

1289
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,051
Who's them? What's them?

1290
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:04,645
<i>One of the insiders.</i>

1291
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:08,282
One of the capitalist,
corporate suppressors.

1292
01:14:08,439 --> 01:14:09,735
You know, they want us dead, man!

1293
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,376
We're just in their crosshairs, you know!

1294
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:12,480
We're just pawns!

1295
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,640
Gosh.

1296
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:15,041
Ow.

1297
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:17,123
Hey.

1298
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:20,922
And what does this
have to do with the birds?

1299
01:14:21,079 --> 01:14:22,286
Yeah.

1300
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,439
My mom's supposed to be working
for the Justice Department, right?

1301
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,801
Sure, she's prosecuting
the catalytic converter case.

1302
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,690
Yeah, only she's not.
She's not prosecuting it.

1303
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,841
The auto makers, she's gonna let 'em walk.

1304
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,199
- But they have the evidence.
- Yes, they have evidence.

1305
01:14:35,319 --> 01:14:36,685
They have memos proving that

1306
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,161
Detroit conspired
to suppress the converter,

1307
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:40,320
proving they would rather

1308
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:42,296
poison our air than spend
a little bit of money.

1309
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:43,975
But my mom, she's gonna say
that's not enough.

1310
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,525
She's gonna lie because...
Because she's on the take.

1311
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,159
Money again, right?
Mammon, that's her god.

1312
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:51,402
That fascist crony...

1313
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,560
- Okay, okay.
- Bogart!

1314
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,451
All right, all right,
just back up a little bit.

1315
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,336
Why not just go straight to the police?

1316
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:00,010
She is the police.

1317
01:15:00,159 --> 01:15:02,322
She's the head of the Justice Department.

1318
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:03,685
You've got a point.

1319
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:04,841
Okay, or the newspaper?

1320
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,411
They all work together.

1321
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,648
God, have you been living under a rock?

1322
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,761
All right, so then your solution
was you make a porn film.

1323
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,081
It's not a porno!

1324
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:16,775
<i>You know, I have neighbors.</i>

1325
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,319
- I made a statement.
- Right.

1326
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:21,728
And yeah, yeah,
my statement contained nudity.

1327
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:23,039
- Porno nudity.
- Art.

1328
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:25,487
That's just the commercial element, okay?

1329
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,721
Okay? Sid said we had to have that.

1330
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:30,359
And the reality was
we were getting our message out there.

1331
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,521
And it was all in the film,

1332
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:36,082
names and dates and everything,
everything that my mom was doing,

1333
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:38,239
and once it was out there,
once it was in theaters,

1334
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:39,496
there's no way that
they could suppress it.

1335
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,363
There's no way
that they could cover it up.

1336
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,010
<i>So let me get this straight.</i>

1337
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:46,925
You made a porno film
where the point was the plot?

1338
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:48,604
What's your hang-up, man?

1339
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,125
<i>It's not the sex.</i>

1340
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,487
It's what's in the story.

1341
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,641
My mom found out.

1342
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,006
She killed Dean and destroyed the film.

1343
01:16:00,199 --> 01:16:01,770
Your mom killed Dean?

1344
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,284
Of course.

1345
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:05,685
She killed Misty, too.

1346
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:07,569
And Sid Shattuck?

1347
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:10,201
Yeah.

1348
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:11,720
Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper

1349
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,842
and then your mom, basically.

1350
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,485
So what are you gonna do?

1351
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,880
<i>I</i> don't know.

1352
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:21,846
I'm just really tired, you know.

1353
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,765
Uh, all right, okay. So, uh, you...

1354
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,242
We're just gonna talk about it and
we'll think and you get some rest.

1355
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:31,128
Yeah, just get some rest.

1356
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,409
What do you think?

1357
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,845
I like her.

1358
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,001
I like her dress.

1359
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:42,405
It's a nice dress.

1360
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:44,210
But she's a loon.

1361
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:46,682
According to her,
her mother's single-handedly

1362
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:49,161
gonna wipe out all of Western society.

1363
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:51,208
Well, yeah.

1364
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,444
However, there are people
trying to kill her, right?

1365
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,806
- Like John Boy.
- Who's John Boy?

1366
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,689
<i>He's on The Waltons.</i>

1367
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,211
No, different John Boy.

1368
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:02,520
Well, we think.

1369
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,529
Think, yeah. Pretty sure.

1370
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,291
Can't be sure, though. Yeah.

1371
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,360
Mr. March, I just got a call from Judith.

1372
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,368
She didn't explain herself.

1373
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:16,689
Said she needed $100,000 in cash.

1374
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:18,729
- $100,000? Why?
<i>- I</i> don't know.

1375
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,362
I think she's involved
in something shady maybe.

1376
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,648
Well, her daughter
certainly seems to think so.

1377
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,801
What, Amelia? You found Amelia?

1378
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:27,961
HOLLAND; Yes.

1379
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,810
She fell on our car.

1380
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:31,849
We were just talking
and she fell on our car.

1381
01:17:32,039 --> 01:17:33,689
Anyway, she's here. You should come over.

1382
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,240
I'll send the family doctor.

1383
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,921
Okay, look,

1384
01:17:39,079 --> 01:17:41,207
- Mr. March...
- Holland, please.

1385
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:43,646
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

1386
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:48,606
Would you be willing
to carry the money for me?

1387
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,243
I wish I knew who to believe on this one.

1388
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:01,601
Well, the kid's a write-off,
I'll tell you that much.

1389
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,569
Maybe they're both telling the truth.

1390
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,609
We're downstairs.

1391
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:10,011
She's coming down.

1392
01:18:12,279 --> 01:18:13,855
What do you mean,
they're both telling the truth?

1393
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,119
What the fuck does that mean?

1394
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:17,520
I got a friend, right?

1395
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,761
Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail.

1396
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,530
This was after
they threw him out of office.

1397
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,600
No. Anyway, you know,

1398
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,775
Nixon's driving around
one day around San Clemente.

1399
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,006
Just him and a few agents.

1400
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,161
Yeah.

1401
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:31,560
And they come across
this car accident, right?

1402
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,881
There's a guy pinned under a car.

1403
01:18:34,039 --> 01:18:38,203
Anyway, Nixon gets out,
runs over to check on the guy,

1404
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:40,208
you know, leans down,
and Nixon says to him,

1405
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,643
"You're gonna be okay, son.
You're gonna be all right."

1406
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,484
And right then the guy dies.

1407
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:50,520
I don't get it.

1408
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:52,921
Think about it
from that guy's point of view, okay?

1409
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:54,246
The guy who died.

1410
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:57,323
He's lying there on the ground,
staring up at the sky, near death,

1411
01:18:57,479 --> 01:18:59,695
and then former president,
Richard Nixon, appears before him

1412
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,039
and tells him he's gonna be fine.

1413
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:03,845
Now, did he think that's normal, right,

1414
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,844
that before they die everybody sees Nixon?

1415
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,764
You're expecting an angel
and you get Nixon.

1416
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:10,409
- Exactly. Right?
- Yeah.

1417
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:13,324
It's the same situation,
just a vastly different point of view.

1418
01:19:13,479 --> 01:19:15,686
- So there's two ways to look at something.
- Yeah.

1419
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,296
- That's the point of the story?
- Yeah.

1420
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:19,048
- Yeah, just say that.
- What?

1421
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:21,655
Well, you just lead me on this
epic fucking journey with this story

1422
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,895
and 10 minutes later the point is

1423
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,496
that there's two ways
to look at something.

1424
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,363
Just... You could just say that.

1425
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,760
You didn't like that story?

1426
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,880
- That would be awful.
- Wouldn't it, right?

1427
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,684
- Yeah.
- It would suck, right?

1428
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,046
- Oh.
- Hey.

1429
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,439
Thank God.

1430
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:39,524
$100,000. Packed it myself.

1431
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:40,920
Just“.

1432
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,685
It's not common you find
such nice people in the world.

1433
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:50,041
I'm sorry about him.

1434
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:52,167
He just wanted to come along.
I don't know why.

1435
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:55,721
But I'll call you, you know,
when we make the drop.

1436
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,880
Thank you.

1437
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,970
Are you nervous at all?

1438
01:20:04,119 --> 01:20:05,405
Me? No.

1439
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:07,405
I got insurance.

1440
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,323
This baby right here.

1441
01:20:09,479 --> 01:20:10,970
<i>ls that an ankle gun?</i>

1442
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:12,685
That is an ankle gun, yeah.

1443
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:15,240
- That's pretty sweet.
- Uh-huh.

1444
01:20:16,359 --> 01:20:18,248
I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man.

1445
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:19,730
I'm gonna need you to drive.

1446
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,042
<i>I'm gonna pull over up here.</i>

1447
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,850
You don't have to pull over.
The car can drive itself.

1448
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,011
What?

1449
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:30,760
Just take your hands off the wheel, man.

1450
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,801
Hmm.

1451
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:48,367
I didn't know it could do that.

1452
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,609
Where you been, man?

1453
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:54,648
Every car can do this.

1454
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,121
Yeah, March, where the fuck
have you been, man?

1455
01:20:57,279 --> 01:20:58,645
Idiot. You didn't know that?

1456
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:02,048
You fly everywhere. You don't even drive.

1457
01:21:02,199 --> 01:21:03,247
What do you know?

1458
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:05,003
He's got a point there, Bumble.

1459
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:06,764
Yeah, whatever.

1460
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,963
I used to fly all the time,
but now the smog is just disgusting, man.

1461
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:11,804
It's just this pollution
is out of control.

1462
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,962
All the bees are riding around
in cars these days.

1463
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:15,484
Wake up! Wake up!

1464
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,204
March! Wake up!

1465
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,123
March! Wake up!

1466
01:21:37,479 --> 01:21:39,130
That's not money.

1467
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,528
Tally packed it herself. She said so.

1468
01:21:44,319 --> 01:21:47,641
Why? Why would she send us off
on some wild fucking goose chase?

1469
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,171
Amelia.

1470
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:00,926
- No, like The Waltons.
- Yeah?

1471
01:22:01,079 --> 01:22:02,206
Yeah, on TV.

1472
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,604
Richard something? Yeah.

1473
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,125
Who's that actor?

1474
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:07,805
Jessica, get off the phone.

1475
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,283
Yeah. Anyway, so this new John Boy's
like a murderer or something.

1476
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:13,645
Uh-huh.

1477
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,247
Shit. Now it's gonna bug me.

1478
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,524
You must be Holly.

1479
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:21,960
Dr. Malek.

1480
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

1481
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:25,128
She's inside. Come in.

1482
01:22:25,279 --> 01:22:26,610
<i>Thank you.</i>

1483
01:22:27,399 --> 01:22:29,368
<i>Yeah, I don't know..</i>

1484
01:22:34,279 --> 01:22:35,645
You mind fetching your dad?

1485
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:37,204
Uh, he's running an errand.

1486
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,045
Back anytime soon?

1487
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:41,725
Oh, hour, tops.

1488
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:43,206
Fine.

1489
01:22:44,199 --> 01:22:48,046
Now, then, Nurse Holly, how's our patient?

1490
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,211
That's her?

1491
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:52,050
Oh, no, that's Jessica.

1492
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:54,202
What she's got you can't fix.

1493
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,609
You are very funny.

1494
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,841
In there.

1495
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,730
<i>- Asleep. Slight fever.
- H</i> m <i>m.</i>

1496
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:03,082
On drugs you think?

1497
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:05,003
Maybe smoking the reefer?

1498
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:10,929
What was she saying?

1499
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:13,925
Was she making sense?

1500
01:23:14,079 --> 01:23:15,240
<i>Hold on. Um...</i>

1501
01:23:15,399 --> 01:23:18,404
Holly, what's the name of the guy
on The Waltons that plays John Boy?

1502
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:21,006
<i>With the hockey puck on his face?</i>

1503
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:25,720
That show's for retards.

1504
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:29,009
Dr. Malek, would you like a cookie?
Just baked them.

1505
01:23:29,159 --> 01:23:31,207
There's none left. I looked, remember?

1506
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:34,164
No, there's a couple. Doctor?

1507
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:38,962
I could be persuaded.

1508
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,730
After I have a look at Sleeping Beauty.

1509
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:48,164
Nurse Holly.

1510
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:53,327
Holly, what are you doing? Are you crazy?

1511
01:23:53,479 --> 01:23:55,686
There are handcuffs
behind the bar, asshole.

1512
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:57,086
Get them.

1513
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,490
This is really slowing me down, Holly.

1514
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:04,045
What's going on?

1515
01:24:04,199 --> 01:24:06,167
Jessica, it's him. He's the guy.

1516
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:09,766
Jessica, if you help me with this,

1517
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:14,051
<i>I'll</i> only kill Holly.

1518
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:21,685
Jessica, dial 911.

1519
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,287
Jessica, I wouldn't do that if I were you.

1520
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,203
You hear that?

1521
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,240
- Excuse me.
- Evening.

1522
01:24:49,479 --> 01:24:51,846
<i>You hear that sound
just a second ago?</i>

1523
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,842
Oh, yeah, just now.

1524
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,364
<i>That was me.</i>

1525
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,841
I threw that little girl out the window.

1526
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,801
Cover me.

1527
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:19,484
- Holly!
- Dad!

1528
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:20,975
Get in.
ls she okay?

1529
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,126
Get down.

1530
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:26,810
Fucking fascists!

1531
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,006
Jesus!

1532
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:29,365
Sorry.

1533
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,560
Get in.

1534
01:25:32,119 --> 01:25:35,488
Okay, come here.
Stay in here and don't move.

1535
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:36,880
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay-

1536
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:38,529
Wait, wait. Dad, Dad, here you go.

1537
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,680
Jesus!

1538
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,726
Jessica. I think she's awake.

1539
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,007
Wait, where are you going?
What are you doing?

1540
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:55,764
Tell Mr. Healy thanks for nothing.

1541
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:13,087
Oh, fuck.

1542
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:23,524
Fuck!

1543
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,520
Are you okay?

1544
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:28,680
March, gun, gun!

1545
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,609
- Fuck!
- Shit!

1546
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:41,447
Here.

1547
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,965
He's gone.

1548
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:06,961
He's gone.

1549
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,640
Hey.

1550
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:20,489
Shit.

1551
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:29,841
Wow.

1552
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,199
Please, I need to get out of here.

1553
01:28:25,079 --> 01:28:26,760
She had her fucking
daughter killed, Perry.

1554
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,840
Please tell me they're
at least gonna question her.

1555
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:30,399
They haven't and they're not going to.

1556
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:31,480
Because?

1557
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,136
Because she's the head
of the Justice Department.

1558
01:28:33,159 --> 01:28:34,920
Oh, and, by the way, you're welcome.

1559
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,810
You're out, free on your own recognizance.
You get to walk.

1560
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,280
There should be like a statue
of me in your fucking house.

1561
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:43,400
I'm sorry, guys.

1562
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:45,085
You're gonna lose this one, all right?

1563
01:28:45,239 --> 01:28:48,163
Your word against hers.
No evidence. You lose.

1564
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,368
You better seriously think
about changing your story.

1565
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:21,283
<i>Oh, fuck it. Maybe they're right.</i>

1566
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,291
Maybe the goddamn birds can't breathe.

1567
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,561
Amelia, Misty, Dean, Shattuck, all dead.

1568
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:35,761
The rest of us just get to choke.

1569
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,440
I need a drink.

1570
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,520
- How much do I owe you, buddy?
- 12 bucks, pal.

1571
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,523
I always hated that palm tree.

1572
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:57,126
Never trusted it.

1573
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:01,686
- Go inside and get your stuff.
- Okay.

1574
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,762
We'll go stay in a hotel or something.

1575
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,603
We'll get room service.

1576
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,006
Mr. March.

1577
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:17,490
Mrs. Glenn.

1578
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,921
I need to talk to you.

1579
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:21,844
What a wonderful surprise.

1580
01:30:23,319 --> 01:30:25,845
- Is that your house?
- We're remodeling.

1581
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:28,011
Listen, this isn't a great time.

1582
01:30:28,159 --> 01:30:29,889
It is a great time.

1583
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:33,805
He is supposed to be looking for my niece.

1584
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:36,122
- Really?
- Because I saw her.

1585
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:38,926
But nobody believes me.

1586
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:41,122
Why will nobody believe me?

1587
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:42,520
I'm sure I don't know, ma'am.

1588
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:47,128
I saw her in her house
through the front window as clear as day,

1589
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:49,247
writing something at a desk.

1590
01:30:49,399 --> 01:30:52,289
She was wearing a blue pinstriped jacket.

1591
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:54,920
I've seen that jacket, sure, yeah.

1592
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,376
What do you mean, you saw that jacket?

1593
01:30:57,399 --> 01:30:58,400
In Shattuck's office.

1594
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,239
It was there with
a bunch of other clothes.

1595
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:03,048
That jacket was in Sid Shattuck's office?

1596
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:04,201
Yeah. It was bagged up.

1597
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:06,376
It had Misty's name on it
and the name of the movie.

1598
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:08,481
It's wardrobe for the film.

1599
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:10,530
It's wardrobe for the film.

1600
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:14,488
- Holy fucking shit.
- Oh!

1601
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:17,802
Sorry. Mrs. Glenn, I need you
to take us to Misty's house.

1602
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,689
I need you to show us
exactly what you saw.

1603
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,405
<i>There. There.
That's the window.</i>

1604
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,529
I was coming around that corner
and I saw her through that window.

1605
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:38,930
But, no, it was here. The desk was here.

1606
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:40,081
No desk there now.

1607
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:42,082
<i>Well,
I don't know what to say.</i>

1608
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:43,365
Dad, what are you doing?

1609
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,005
Give me a second.

1610
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:53,643
World's worst detective, huh?

1611
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:55,324
You did see your niece, Mrs. Glenn.

1612
01:31:55,479 --> 01:31:59,087
You saw her on that wall,
at a desk, in a pinstriped suit.

1613
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:02,523
So what she saw was a movie?

1614
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,648
Not a movie. The movie.

1615
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:06,440
The movie.

1616
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,170
But the film burned up.

1617
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:11,881
Well, how did she see it
two days after it supposedly burned up?

1618
01:32:12,039 --> 01:32:14,042
And the wardrobe matches perfectly.

1619
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:17,123
So Amelia had a second print?
She had a copy?

1620
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:18,610
Wouldn't you?

1621
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,121
And she gave that copy to Misty.

1622
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,048
So she comes here,
checks the film against that wall...

1623
01:32:25,199 --> 01:32:26,884
Lily sees it through that window.

1624
01:32:27,039 --> 01:32:29,645
And Amelia splits and takes the film.

1625
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,006
And goes where?

1626
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:33,161
Oh, for fuck...

1627
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:35,328
I mean, can't we get to the next...

1628
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:38,323
The Western Hotel to meet the businessmen.

1629
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:39,970
Distributors.

1630
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,650
She was screening it for the distributors.

1631
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:45,604
She was showing them the film.

1632
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,171
<i>It's out there. The film exists.</i>

1633
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:49,083
Now we just have to find it.

1634
01:32:49,239 --> 01:32:50,445
<i>Guys, look.</i>

1635
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:55,048
"Opening night, 9:00 p.m." Signed, Chet.

1636
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:57,247
- Fucking Chet.
- The protestor guy?

1637
01:32:57,439 --> 01:32:59,168
Give me that shit.

1638
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:03,640
She was planning something with Chet.

1639
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:05,801
Opening night?

1640
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:08,327
The LA auto show.

1641
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:10,649
- It's today, right?
- Yeah.

1642
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:13,922
Big party. Mucky-mucks. Loads of press.

1643
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:15,815
If you wanted to get a story
out there, right?

1644
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,649
And fucking Chet's a projectionalist.

1645
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,136
<i>Please stop talking.</i>

1646
01:33:19,159 --> 01:33:22,130
I've been listening
to everything you said.

1647
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:26,211
Does this mean...
Does this mean that my niece is dead?

1648
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:27,520
Yes!

1649
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,688
I mean, you know, yes.

1650
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:34,529
- She was murdered. I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

1651
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,159
But we're gonna bring down
the people who did it.

1652
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:41,324
Yeah, and for a deeply
discounted rate, so...

1653
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:48,091
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles
and the 1978 Pacific Coast Auto Show.</i>

1654
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:49,240
<i>Styled road wheels.</i>

1655
01:33:49,399 --> 01:33:50,925
<i>These all-new fuel-efficient systems.</i>

01:33:51,079 --> 01:33:54,050
<i>An incredible 210-brake horsepower.</i>

1657

<i>Their battery-powered

<i>Cadillac have brought their new El Dorado.</i>

<i>Featuring a 7-liter V8.</i>

1660
01:34:11,239 --> 01:34:13,890
You guys know
where the projection room is?

1661
01:34:14,079 --> 01:34:15,216
You seen Chet, the projectionist?

1662
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:17,336
Yeah, he just left
like 10 minutes ago, went for a drink.

1663
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:18,565
And you are?

1664
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,926
In a hurry. Thanks, buddy.

1665
01:34:21,079 --> 01:34:23,320
How'd you know my name was Buddy?

1666
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:34,323
<i>The Malibu sedan.</i>

1667

<i>This year's edition

1668
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,244
<i>Come and see it, folks.</i>

1669
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,564
<i>It's just</i> a <i>bunch of cars.</i>

1670

Motor City Pride.

1671
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:45,606
- That's not it.
- Shit.

1672
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:46,841
That's not the film.

1673
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:51,289
Fucking Chet.

1674
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:54,488
He's probably still got it
stashed somewhere.

1675
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:03,769
Tally. Oh, my God, you look incredible.

1676
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,247
How do you get your hair to...
It's magnificent.

1677
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,615
Listen, I don't know
what's going on here,

1678
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:13,130
but there's been some foul play.

1679
01:35:13,279 --> 01:35:15,055
<i>Do you know that that
suitcase that you gave us,</i>

1680
01:35:15,079 --> 01:35:16,127
somebody switched it out?

1681
01:35:16,279 --> 01:35:17,485
There was no money in it.

1682
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,130
No <i>shit.</i>

1683
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:20,884
Weapons on the floor. Now.

1684
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:23,327
I guess
you killed the projectionist, huh?

1685
01:35:23,479 --> 01:35:25,846
No. My associate's out
looking for him now.

1686
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,126
We'll find him.

1687
01:35:27,319 --> 01:35:29,640
Tally, let me ask you something.

1688
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,604
You ever really killed anybody?

1689
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,841
In Detroit, yeah. Three times.

1690
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:37,490
Really?

1691
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:40,006
That's where this all started.
The Detroit show.

1692
01:35:40,159 --> 01:35:42,730
That bitch Misty shooting her
mouth off about her new movie.

1693
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:45,287
Tally, this is not you.

1694
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:46,600
You're not a murderer.

1695
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,405
She just said she killed three people.

1696
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:51,050
I know, but I'm saying deep down.

1697
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:52,456
<i>Hey, look, one's</i> a <i>mistake.</i>

1698
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:54,775
- By the time you get to three...
- Don't paint her with that brush.

1699
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,055
I guess it's easy
to live in your world, right,

1700
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:57,216
where everyone sits in their place.

1701
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:58,319
See what's in front of you.

1702
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:00,095
She's got a gun and she's killed three...

1703
01:36:00,119 --> 01:36:01,121
<i>Come on, man.</i>

1704
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:02,456
You don't know her upbringing.

1705
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:04,136
- You gotta face the situation.
- You don't know <i>what</i> she...

1706
01:36:04,159 --> 01:36:06,127
Room service.

1707
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:08,849
- Shit. No.
- What's wrong with him?

1708
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,809
I don't know. I'm gonna ask him.

1709
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,802
- March?
- Yeah?

1710
01:36:13,399 --> 01:36:14,845
Uh, what the fuck are you doing?

1711
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,286
Did you move it?

1712
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:18,043
- Move what?
- The fucking gun.

1713
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:20,725
- What gun?
- The fucking ankle gun.

1714
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:22,524
Who told you I had an ankle gun?

1715
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,199
You did. In the car before we crashed.

1716
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:25,975
You were like,
"Oh, check out my ankle gun."

1717
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:27,336
You know, you showed me your ankle gun.

1718
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,363
Come on. Are you serious?
Are you fucking serious?

1719
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:31,600
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

1720
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:34,689
- Did I dream that?
- Yeah, you moron, you dreamt it.

1721
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:36,364
No, no, no, no.

1722
01:36:37,319 --> 01:36:38,730
Yeah, you're right, that was...

1723
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,121
Just shut up! Shut up! Both of you.

1724
01:36:42,640 --> 01:36:43,801
<i>Room service.</i>

1725
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,087
- This takes the fucking cake.
- Shh!

1726
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,324
Holly, you can come in now.

1727
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,563
Very clever, Holly.

1728
01:36:57,079 --> 01:36:59,162
Thanks. I thought so.

1729
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,927
Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?

1730
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:08,162
I got it in the hallway.
I thought it was hot.

1731
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:09,895
I like where your head's at, sweetheart.

1732
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,279
That really could have worked out.

1733
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:13,930
All right, you know, everybody,
in the corner. Come on.

1734
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,921
Shit.

1735
01:37:21,159 --> 01:37:23,765
- Well, that really worked out.
- Yeah.

1736
01:37:26,279 --> 01:37:29,806
Now we just gotta find that
fucking Chet before John Boy does.

1737
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,962
Yeah. Well, that guy said
he was going for a drink.

1738
01:37:32,119 --> 01:37:34,930
You take the roof bar.
I'll take downstairs.

1739
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:36,319
- Well done, kiddo.
- Thanks.

1740
01:37:42,359 --> 01:37:44,966
- You the projectionist?
- Mmm-hmm.

1741
01:37:45,119 --> 01:37:46,564
Look, we got a problem on nine.

1742
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:48,210
Someone knocked over the projector.

1743
01:37:48,359 --> 01:37:49,560
The film's all over the floor.

1744
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,001
- Film's on the floor? Really?
- Yeah, it's a mess.

1745
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,844
You follow me?

1746
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,801
Okay, just wait here.
I'm gonna take a look around.

1747
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:06,961
I wanna help.

1748
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,520
You can help by staying put, okay?

1749
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:11,091
Promise me you'll get the film?

1750
01:38:11,279 --> 01:38:12,690
Yeah, I promise.

1751
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:14,284
Pinky promise?

1752
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:19,685
Fuck.

1753
01:38:27,319 --> 01:38:29,481
Hey, pal, what can I do you for?

1754
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,167
Free drinks. What do you have?

1755
01:38:33,319 --> 01:38:34,650
Little guy, stringy hair.

1756
01:38:34,840 --> 01:38:37,046
I think they went out through those doors.

1757
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,847
Hey, Chet? Chet?

1758
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,286
Hey. Hey, Chet.

1759
01:38:56,439 --> 01:39:01,002
Amelia's film, where is it?

1760
01:39:01,479 --> 01:39:04,404
The film is in the projector.
Repeat, it's in the projector.

1761
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:06,326
But we already checked that.

1762
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,524
- Spliced in.
- What?

1763
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:14,400
It's spliced into the middle of it,
right in the other film. Go get it.

1764
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,085
On my WHY-

1765
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:25,649
Don't you know it's rude to eavesdrop?

1766
01:39:27,039 --> 01:39:29,770
I got a gun pointed directly
at your daughter's spine.

1767
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,367
Come with me. Come on, baby.

1768
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:47,761
How does that song go?

1769
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,199
<i>Welcome, Los Angeles,</i>

1770
01:39:54,359 --> 01:39:57,283
<i>to the finest fleet of automobiles
Detroit has to offer,</i>

1771
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:00,569
<i>giving the world luxury redefined.</i>

1772
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,042
<i>In addition to the most
distinctive styling,</i>

1773
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:06,123
<i>we are bringing you interiors
that are comfort assured,</i>

1774
01:40:06,279 --> 01:40:10,079
<i>combining velour, leather,
wood paneling and an improved...</i>

1775
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,079
Help him up.

1776
01:40:16,359 --> 01:40:18,283
Why'd you have to bring the goddamn kid?

1777
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:21,841
I fucked up.

1778
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,161
Yeah, you fucked up.

1779
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,121
America...

1780
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,088
Oh, my God.

1781
01:40:43,239 --> 01:40:44,240
Fuck, fuck.

1782
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:45,880
Do you want her to see you like this?

1783
01:40:45,960 --> 01:40:47,216
You fucking drunk.

1784
01:40:47,239 --> 01:40:48,810
Oh, don't start that crying shit.

1785
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,199
<i>I</i> fucked up.

1786
01:40:50,359 --> 01:40:51,680
You drunk motherfucker, you.

1787
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:53,768
- I <i>love</i> you.
<i>- It's embarrassing.</i>

1788
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,490
I'm sorry. Duck.

1789
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:57,801
- What?
- Duck.

1790
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,649
Motherfucker!

1791
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,010
<i>Well, I'm Bulging Paulsen</i>

1792
01:41:17,159 --> 01:41:19,810
<i>and I represent the Detroit
auto manufacturers.</i>

1793
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:21,371
<i>That's who the hell I am.</i>

1794
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,240
<i>You poison our air.
The people won't stand for it.</i>

1795
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:31,400
Nixon!

1796
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,842
No!

1797
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:39,841
<i>I might be persuaded
to change my mind.</i>

1798
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,128
<i>Perhaps if we came
to a monetary arrangement.</i>

1799
01:41:43,319 --> 01:41:46,210
<i>I'll take a wire transfer.
It's a Union Federal account.</i>

1800
01:41:46,359 --> 01:41:47,690
<i>Number 22-12.</i>

1801
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:49,524
<i>Just tell them the exact amounts.</i>

1802
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,170
He's got a gun!

1803
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:14,645
Oh, my God.

1804
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,440
Three, two, one.

1805
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,970
Jesus!

1806
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:37,961
How'd you get down here?
I told you to go to the roof.

1807
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:40,122
- Did you fall?
- Yeah.

1808
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:43,291
Jesus Christ, are you kidding?

1809
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:44,725
I think I'm invincible.

1810
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,256
<i>It's the only thing that makes sense.</i>

1811
01:42:46,279 --> 01:42:48,203
- I don't think I can die.
- Where's the film?

1812
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:50,761
It's up there. We just gotta go get it.

1813
01:42:58,479 --> 01:43:00,208
You get out of here, you little shit.

1814
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:07,768
You give me that,
you fucked-up little hippy.

1815
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:11,560
You want it? Go get it.

1816
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:13,323
No!

1817
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,284
Get me that fucking film. Move it.

1818
01:43:28,439 --> 01:43:30,442
- Cover me.
- What... March! March!

1819
01:43:33,159 --> 01:43:34,685
Drop your weapon!

1820
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:44,650
Fuck.

1821
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:47,806
March, go. I got this.

1822
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:31,805
Hey!

1823
01:45:00,039 --> 01:45:02,963
Run! Just run!

1824
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,528
Mr. Healy, what are you doing?

1825
01:45:19,680 --> 01:45:20,726
Go away, Holly.

1826
01:45:22,720 --> 01:45:25,929
Healy, stop! You don't have to kill him!

1827
01:45:27,640 --> 01:45:30,927
Mr. Healy, if you kill this man,
I will never speak to you again.

1828
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,770
Congratulations, buddy.

1829
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:51,287
You owe your life to a 13-year-old girl.

1830
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,409
Come on, let's go down and see your dad.

1831
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,127
And that would be the cops.

1832
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:43,849
Sir? Sir, are you all right?

1833
01:46:44,039 --> 01:46:46,565
Sir, is anyone left in the building?

1834
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:48,961
<i>He's not responsive.</i>

1835
01:46:49,119 --> 01:46:50,576
<i>All right, let's find out who else is...</i>

1836
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:53,967
<i>And sometimes... Sometimes,</i>

1837
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:58,002
<i>you just win.</i>

1838
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,887
Jesus Christ.

1839
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,529
Oh, shit.

1840
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:14,523
You know what? Don't even talk to her.

1841
01:47:14,680 --> 01:47:16,841
Don't even look at her, man.

1842
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:19,440
Fuck.

1843
01:47:20,199 --> 01:47:22,362
Oh, boys, boys.

1844
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:25,970
You really think you've got
something done here.

1845
01:47:26,119 --> 01:47:28,565
Do you have a clue what just happened?

1846
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:32,484
It was protocol. I followed protocol.

1847
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,086
What's wrong with him?

1848
01:47:40,239 --> 01:47:44,564
I believe he's making a connection
between you and Adolf Hitler.

1849
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,367
Read the fucking newspaper.

1850
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:51,369
What's good for Detroit
is good for America.

1851
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,520
Unbelievable.

1852
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:57,003
The America I love
owes its life to the Big Three.

1853
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:00,296
But it's all right for you
to fail your daughter?

1854
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:01,730
Detroit had her killed.

1855
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,086
I think I read about that.

1856
01:48:03,239 --> 01:48:05,890
The whole city got together, took a vote.
Big turnout.

1857
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:07,365
I wanted her safe.

1858
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,726
That's why I hired you two.

1859
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:12,127
You're going to jail, Mrs. Kuttner.

1860
01:48:13,079 --> 01:48:16,765
I might be going to jail,
but it won't make a difference.

1861
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,286
You can't take Detroit down.

1862
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:27,411
And if I'm not there to take care of it,

1863
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,806
someone else will be.

1864
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:34,087
Okay, well, we shall see.

1865
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:44,801
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everybody.
Merry Christmas!

1866
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:47,761
Jesus.

1867
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:50,444
Where is he?

1868
01:48:58,359 --> 01:48:59,600
Scotch.

1869
01:49:01,199 --> 01:49:02,280
Did you see the TV?

1870
01:49:03,640 --> 01:49:04,845
Yeah, I saw.

1871
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,963
They're gonna let them off,
the car companies, soot-free.

1872
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:11,167
Not enough evidence of collusion, you see.

1873
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:12,650
I heard.

1874
01:49:14,119 --> 01:49:16,487
The sun went up, the sun went down.

1875
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:19,484
Nothing changes, just like you said.

1876
01:49:19,640 --> 01:49:24,088
Look, they got away with it.
Big surprise, you know?

1877
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,002
People are stupid.
But they're not that stupid.

1878
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:34,324
The point is five years tops,

1879
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,126
we're all driving
electric cars from Japan, anyway.

1880
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:38,850
Mark my words.

1881
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:41,369
Look at this.

1882
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,041
You ever see the bad-breath tie?

1883
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:49,682
Breathe on it.

1884
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:56,445
Works every time. Kills Holly.

1885
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:00,399
At least you're drinking again.

1886
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,689
Yeah. I feel great.

1887
01:50:04,760 --> 01:50:06,204
You know, nobody got hurt.

1888
01:50:06,359 --> 01:50:07,885
A few people got hurt.

1889
01:50:08,079 --> 01:50:09,376
I'm saying I think
they died quickly, though,

1890
01:50:09,399 --> 01:50:10,840
so I don't think that they got hurt.

1891
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:13,284
Look at this.

1892
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:18,521
<i>I'm sorry you look Filipino-
JACKSON: I do.</i>

1893
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:21,283
Or I look Mexican.

1894
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:23,920
<i>And we already got
our first case.</i>

1895
01:50:24,079 --> 01:50:25,729
- Old lady in Glendale.
- Mmm-hmm.

1896
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:27,760
Thinks her husband's
sleeping with Lynda Carter.

1897
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:29,244
Wonder Woman?

1898
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:30,970
Or Lynda Carter.

1899
01:50:31,119 --> 01:50:32,479
That's what we have to figure out.

1900
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:33,686
Right.

1901
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:36,411
- But he's 82, so it's time sensitive.
- Hmm.

1902
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:38,079
<i>What</i> do you <i>say?</i>

1903
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:39,886
Shit.

1904
01:50:44,039 --> 01:50:45,609
To the birds.

1905
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,204
Hallelujah.

1906
01:55:54,199 --> 01:55:55,201
