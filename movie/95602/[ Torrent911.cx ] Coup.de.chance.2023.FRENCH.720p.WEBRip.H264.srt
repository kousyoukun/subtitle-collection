1
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,750
Fanny?

2
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,583
Fanny Moreau?

3
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,375
Alain Aubert.

4
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,667
You used to write for
the school newspaper, right?

5
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,792
Yes, that's correct.

6
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,750
At the Lycée Français in New York, yes.

7
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:55,667
Crazy to run into you here.
What are you doing now?

8
00:01:55,833 --> 00:02:00,583
I am... I am on my way to work.
And what about you?

9
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,875
We were never in the same class,
but I saw you often in the hallways.

10
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:07,500
We had the same
French teacher, Mrs. Dufresnes.

11
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,167
I really loved her.

12
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:13,417
<i>The dead leaves picked up by the shovel.</i>

13
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:16,125
I can almost hear her. Wait...

14
00:02:16,292 --> 00:02:20,625
<i>You see, I did not forget,
The memories as well as the regrets.</i>

15
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,625
Jacques Prévert.

16
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:24,417
That was already Paris.

17
00:02:24,542 --> 00:02:28,167
- Where are you going?
- To the office, but...

18
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,417
- Do you work and live here?
- Weren't you going the other way?

19
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:36,708
That's the beauty of being a writer.
You can decide your own schedule.

20
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:42,125
My dad worked for a French company
in New York. So I was there too.

21
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:45,000
Dad was still with the UN at the time.

22
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:49,542
- So you're a writer?
- I can't believe I ran into you.

23
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,000
That's quite a coincidence.

24
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:54,292
Yes, I am a writer.

25
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,875
I've spent the summer here to write
a book, but it took longer than expected.

26
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,792
I've lived in Paris before.

27
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:07,625
- I was married then. A long story.
- Your pieces were very readable.

28
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,875
That's a big compliment.

29
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:13,208
- Do you live here?
- Yes, my husband works here.

30
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:17,250
- What do you do?
- I work for an auctioneer.

31
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:23,750
- You're no longer called Fanny Moreau.
- I'm now called Mrs. Fanny Fournier.

32
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,500
To think that you would recognize me.

33
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,750
Certainly, everywhere. I was
crazy about you back then.

34
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:34,375
- Don't get me started on it.
- Look, this is where I work now.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,250
- Huh? I'm staying just nearby.
- But you actually don't live in Paris?

36
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:42,625
No, I travel back and forth.
I'm often in London now.

37
00:03:42,792 --> 00:03:47,125
And what is your book about?
Wait, it's ten to three.

38
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:50,708
Nice to meet you,
good luck with your novel.

39
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,958
Maybe we can go out
to dinner sometime...

40
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:59,333
- ...and reminisce about good old times.
- Alright, you know how to reach me.

41
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,833
What is your name as a married
woman again? Fournier?

42
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,042
Mrs. Fournier...

43
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,875
Those people from Monaco
are selling the entire inheritance.

44
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,833
Jewelry, paintings,
unique clothing.

45
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,750
- Are you writing everything down?
- Yes.

46
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:29,333
We just have to show up at the
cocktail party. We won't stay long.

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,167
Edgar will drive us out of town
before it gets dark.

48
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,292
I thought we would
remain here this weekend?

49
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:39,958
But the weather is great. Bernard and
Chloé are coming with Pierre Hersant.

50
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,708
You look beautiful.

51
00:04:42,875 --> 00:04:45,833
It feels wonderful
when you wear that dress.

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,167
- Everyone becomes jealous.
- Don't you find it...

53
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,750
- ...too sexy? Look.
- 'Too sexy' doesn't exist.

54
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,583
Not 'too rich' either.

55
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,667
- I have something for you.
- Oh, Jean.

56
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:08,250
- How beautiful. This is craziness.
- I'm crazy about you.

57
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:11,250
- I like to spoil you.
- Indeed you do.

58
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:15,208
Don't worry, I spoil myself too. Come.

59
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,250
- Is this it?
- Look.

60
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,500
Yes, this is it.

61
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:29,500
An antique Märklin circuit
that works perfectly.

62
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:32,333
- You'll never grow up.
- I'll always be a boy.

63
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,833
Good. Put on the ring, then we'll go.

64
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:38,875
- Don't you find it beautiful?
- Yes, but...

65
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:42,458
Such an expensive jewel
isn't really my style.

66
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,792
When I first met you, maybe not.

67
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:48,917
Later, I took another look
and saw a princess.

68
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,458
And soon you'll be my queen.

69
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,042
Here, put it on.

70
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,875
You're the most spoiled of us,
you always get what you want.

71
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,708
Let's say you resisted, but weakly.

72
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,458
Let's say I was, above all, vulnerable.

73
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:05,292
- Are you putting on that ring now?
- It doesn't go with the dress.

74
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,875
- But it's such a beautiful ring.
- Certainly...

75
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:13,292
- ...but it feels uncomfortable.
- Always the rebel.

76
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:17,667
- You're a classy lady now.
- Do we really have to go out of town?

77
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,167
You and your friends are obsessed with
hunting, but I'm bored down there.

78
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:24,667
But you can relax, read, and eat well.

79
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,458
- And then there are the women.
- You mean Delphine.

80
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:32,292
She's arrogant and materialistic.
Has nothing to say.

81
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,917
Enough complaining.

82
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:37,917
Put on the ring, then you'll be
the most elegant of them all.

83
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,500
The ring is for a refined lady,
but my soul remains rebellious.

84
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:48,333
Your soul is my concern.
You just have to enter stunningly.

85
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,458
Am I a trophy wife?

86
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,333
I swear. No one calls you that.

87
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:02,000
- Jean Fournier and his trophy wife.
- She is adorable.

88
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,417
And very clever.

89
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,917
- A very beautiful couple.
- Yes, definitely.

90
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:10,625
- So he's very lucky.
- And very charming.

91
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:14,875
Personally, I find him very attractive.

92
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:17,750
And he is wonderfully wealthy.

93
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:19,875
Which doesn't hurt.

94
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,792
- A brilliant businessman, they say.
- What does he do?

95
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:28,500
- Nobody knows how he makes money.
- What are you insinuating?

96
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,167
Is there something fishy?

97
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,667
Anyway, he supports good causes.

98
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:39,542
I understand her. He seems
like a Gatsby. Quite enigmatic.

99
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,833
He had... You don't have this from me.

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,167
He once had a partner
who disappeared in the wilds.

101
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,000
Drowned.

102
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,708
Suicide, they say. Or even murder.

103
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:56,208
I've never heard of it.

104
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,042
Nobody knows why he disappeared.
However, I think...

105
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,750
Stop it.

106
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,500
Well...

107
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:09,542
The story broke before I came to Paris.
He was supposed to have drowned.

108
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:13,208
Great advantage for Jean.
That's all I know.

109
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,283
It's only gossip.

110
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,625
I love gossip, it makes
life more interesting.

111
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,292
They're just gossiping, right.

112
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:27,000
Wow, this is an attentive man.

113
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,708
- A magnificent ring.
- This is part of an exchange.

114
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:35,875
I give her such a piece of jewelry,
she leaves the city, which she hates.

115
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,167
I love swimming. That's about it.

116
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:44,333
Her mother is adventurous. She loves
kayaking, fishing, and even hunting.

117
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,417
But this ravishing girl doesn't.

118
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:51,708
This weekend, we're going out of town
for some deer hunting. What about it?

119
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,542
It's very entertaining.

120
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,792
- I can't.
- We're vegetarians.

121
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,417
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.

122
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,500
But perhaps there is some gossip,
something juicy to sink my teeth into?

123
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,333
- Dear friend...
- A drink?

124
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:15,500
- Are you bored? We're leaving the city.
- The countryside's great.

125
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:19,167
- But deadly.
- I can finish <i>Rendez-vous à Samarra</i>.

126
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,542
A great book.

127
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,625
Thank you.

128
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:31,958
I ran into someone from school,
on Avenue Montaigne.

129
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:36,417
- He recognised me right away.
- You have kept your girlish charm.

130
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,625
He said he was crazy
about me, back then.

131
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,708
And it's only now he told you?

132
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,167
It has thrusted me back into the past
and I keep thinking about it.

133
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:53,333
New York. The happiest time of my life,
with a promising future.

134
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
I remember his jeans
and his burgundy shirt.

135
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:05,000
If he had approached me then,
what would have happened?

136
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:09,667
- I could have had a different life.
- Why? Do you want a different life?

137
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:15,417
I learned from my first marriage:
it's not about work or obligation.

138
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:19,500
It's not a chore,
but something you look forward to.

139
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,417
I went to an auction...

140
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:13,875
...where jewelry belonging to
Marie-Antoinette was auctioned.

141
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:16,333
- Did you buy anything?
- Yes.

142
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,958
I wore it at the ball of
the Prince of Monaco. Great success.

143
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:25,042
I am happy.
It did cost me a bit though.

144
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,208
- Are we really going deer hunting?
- Yes, we are.

145
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,667
- I don't know if I have the courage.
- When I see such a creature...

146
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:35,792
...I don't know if I'll shoot it either.

147
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:39,042
Shooting a deer that looks at you...

148
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,208
...that's like murdering a child.

149
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,458
Oh, this is delicious.
Your wine is incredible.

150
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:04,667
- I bought that one for you.
- I can recommend...

151
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,292
- ... a culinary journey in Japan.
- I'm not a fan of Japanese food.

152
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:12,417
Is it delicious?
Our cook has the weekend off.

153
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:16,917
- Our cook has said goodbye.
- We're looking for someone...

154
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:19,933
- ...but a good one is not easy to find.
- Has she left?

155
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,292
You need to pay them well.

156
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:26,625
And Pierre is also very difficult.

157
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,667
- Delphine is nice, but a snob.
- She admires you.

158
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,792
Supporting their foundations does help.

159
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,250
Chloé asked again what you do.

160
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,500
Even as your wife, I don't know.

161
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:45,917
This is crazy. Why does everyone
find it so mysterious?

162
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:49,458
I've already explained a thousand times.

163
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,792
- I know, but...
- Listen.

164
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:55,833
I am adding to assets.
It can't get any clearer.

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,833
Rich people want to become richer.

166
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,708
Less tax, more for the children.

167
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,500
I help with that, and that's how I earn.

168
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,750
And everything legal?

169
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:09,208
Uh, yeah.

170
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:11,333
Mostly.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,625
Yes, Fanny, it's Alain.
Alain Aubert, from school.

172
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,458
Hi, how are you?

173
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:38,458
I'm fine. Listen.
I am now near the gallery.

174
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:43,208
Do you want to have lunch with me today?
Or any other day this week.

175
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:48,500
Yes, we can have lunch together today.

176
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,042
Great, great. Listen.

177
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,208
I know a good place.

178
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,292
It's beautiful weather
for lunch in the park.

179
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,958
That's what I was thinking too.

180
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:04,125
We can grab some sandwiches.

181
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:07,667
I am in front of your office.
Half past twelve, one o'clock?

182
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,875
Great. See you soon.

183
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,917
I live really close by,
just behind that building.

184
00:14:16,417 --> 00:14:19,625
But tell me. You're married, children?

185
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,667
Divorced, no children.

186
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:28,125
I was married to someone
you might know, Anne Sorel.

187
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:32,958
She was at school with us. She played
in Anouilh's <i>L'Alouette</i>.

188
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,292
I didn't know her.

189
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,000
Very beautiful girl.

190
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,917
- Actually...
- What?

191
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:43,833
...I fell in love with her
because she looked like you.

192
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,458
But that went wrong.

193
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,625
You seemed so straighforward.

194
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,125
Very natural.

195
00:14:51,292 --> 00:14:53,708
I couldn't look at you.

196
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:57,292
I feel flattered but also embarrassed.

197
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,667
It was something sacred about you.

198
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:06,333
I should have paid more attention to
lessons and less to boys. Which bench?

199
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,000
- Shall we sit here?
- Okay.

200
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,375
So I started dating Anne.

201
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,958
Then we moved to Paris.

202
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:23,125
We got married.

203
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:25,792
Then reality knocked on the door.

204
00:15:27,125 --> 00:15:30,208
- How long were you married?
- Very briefly.

205
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,625
After a few years, we couldn't
stand each other anymore.

206
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:39,333
I never thought it could
become such a chaos.

207
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,750
I went to Barcelona, never wanted to
return to Paris. Then I went to London.

208
00:15:44,917 --> 00:15:48,000
Now I'm back in Paris for my book.

209
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,458
You come out broken from a divorce.

210
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,475
I always thought you would
marry a painter or a poet.

211
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,208
That's right. He was a musician.
Very sensitive, very addicted.

212
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:05,125
I find that very sad.

213
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:10,458
On New Year's Eve, Jean picked
me up as the center of his life.

214
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,708
You were the center of my own!

215
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:17,708
I was dying to talk to you, but I was
powerless against my poor self-image.

216
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,792
I was at rock bottom at that time,
and Jean helped me out.

217
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,667
- Do you have children?
- No.

218
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:27,000
And what does he do?

219
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:30,417
Making rich people richer.

220
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:31,875
How kind.

221
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,458
Tell me about your book.

222
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you really want to know
or are you just polite?

223
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,250
It takes place in Paris,
in a jazz club.

224
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:47,167
The story of a singer
and a percussionist.

225
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,625
I don't know that world well.

226
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:54,833
- I have never been to such a club here.
- Want some chestnuts?

227
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,583
One bag, please.

228
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,667
Actually, the book is about
the irony of life.

229
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,583
Everyone's at the mercy of
chance and coincidences.

230
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,166
- Here you are.
- Life as a cruel joke.

231
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,583
- It's good.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:16,291
Look at us.

233
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:21,416
The same school, I'm secretly in love,
we don't talk to each other...

234
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:25,041
...and I run into you
in Paris, on the street.

235
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,416
Can it be more ironic?

236
00:17:27,541 --> 00:17:29,708
Will we become a couple?

237
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:35,000
- Me and the beautiful nerd in a
black turtleneck. - I'm sorry...

238
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:41,125
- ...but I'm no longer at all like that.
- For me, you'll always be Fanny Moreau.

239
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:45,167
With a black leather bag and
<i>Anna Karenina</i> under the arm.

240
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,042
Except that I'm now Fanny Fournier.

241
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,167
That's life.

242
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,875
Even though we would like to,
we have no control over it.

243
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:55,833
Sorry, but I am very late.

244
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,792
If you want, I would be delighted
to have a sandwich with you again.

245
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,417
Yes, call again.

246
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:11,000
- You look good.
- Nice to have you here.

247
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:16,583
- How is the champion mother-in-law?
- There was turbulence, drunk neighbor.

248
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,292
- Film a total loss. A hellish flight.
- Always so funny.

249
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,500
- And New York?
- Great, I never get tired of it.

250
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,917
- Even in the winter.
- How long are you staying?

251
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:34,208
Only today. I'm going to Bretagne
to help my sister after her surgery.

252
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:38,042
But I can't cross the ocean without
visiting my favourite couple.

253
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,167
We are leaving the city this weekend.

254
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,417
Kayaking, hiking, big game hunting.

255
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,833
You would have liked it.

256
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,500
I'll return via Paris again, but have no
idea how long I'll stay with Sophie.

257
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:56,208
- Are there dumbbells in here?
- Books for Sophie.

258
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:01,125
- Don't you have an e-reader?
- No, I prefer paper in my hands.

259
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:02,792
Turning the pages.

260
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,583
- So where shall we eat?
- A calm place so we can talk.

261
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,375
But it's important to your mother with
a good foie gras and a glass of Margaux.

262
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,667
- What a memory!
- Cholesterol! You're really a pair.

263
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:20,625
New wallpaper in the guest room,
and the lamp has been replaced because...

264
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,000
Is there a plank under the mattress now?

265
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:27,458
How could I have forgotten that?

266
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:33,250
- It was delicious.
- Your mother is a gourmet.

267
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,417
Yes, that is well known.

268
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,167
Good evening. Are you alright?

269
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:43,667
We're fine. This is my mother,
and this is Caroline and Marcel.

270
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:49,042
- We were with them in Corsica.
- This year we consider Polynesia.

271
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,042
A long journey, but sublime.

272
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,500
We could still call about it.

273
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,917
Yes, come along. That will be fun.

274
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,875
I have been there many times,
it is very romantic.

275
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:05,667
- Great, have a nice evening.
- Have a nice evening, see you soon.

276
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,542
Yes, Polynesia, but not
with them. She's soporific.

277
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:17,500
- He has written about Gauguin.
- He is a problem for me.

278
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:20,458
- Not because...
- I told you.

279
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,667
Terrible, the way he looks at you.
He has a crush on you.

280
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,625
But Marcel is crazy about Caroline
and would never cheat on her.

281
00:20:27,792 --> 00:20:32,750
- He might make an exception for you.
- Marcel Blanc means nothing to me.

282
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,875
I'm sorry but I don't like the guy.

283
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,542
Very pushy.

284
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:40,958
It is flattering when your man
protects you like a treasure.

285
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:44,500
Yes, but Jean can also be possessive.

286
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:48,833
Wait, if you're not cheating
with Marcel Blanc...

287
00:20:49,042 --> 00:20:50,667
...with whom then?

288
00:20:52,583 --> 00:20:56,583
Mick Jagger and Alain Delon
are already too old...

289
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,708
...so I don't know.

290
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,417
My foie gras.

291
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:04,792
- Thank you very much.
- Looks very good.

292
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,708
- What time are you flying tomorrow?
- I'm taking the train.

293
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:11,083
I'm sorry I can't stay longer.

294
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,958
So I could have come
with you, out of town.

295
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:17,417
Has Jean already said
that we are doing that?

296
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,167
- Do you find it annoying?
- For me, not for him.

297
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:26,250
- The people he invites are boring.
- Doesn't he have any great friends?

298
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,500
No, very shallow, their only
quality is being wealthy.

299
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,417
It's about money and the best hotels.

300
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:39,667
If I mention Rome or Madrid, they only
talk about fancy restaurants there.

301
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:46,042
- I don't like hunting and hiking.
- So invite your own friends.

302
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:48,500
No, Jean doesn't like my friends.

303
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:53,625
I hardly see Carla, Antoine
and Dominique any more.

304
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:57,875
- Excuse me but that's not a big loss.
- You always agree with him.

305
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:01,167
He loves you. That is cute.

306
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:06,833
He's charismatic and much better than
your first husband, who was a failure.

307
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,500
A very good change.

308
00:22:09,625 --> 00:22:13,917
Camille, I want to show
you something. You'll like this.

309
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,917
Let's go see.

310
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:28,167
Beautiful, isn't it?

311
00:22:29,208 --> 00:22:32,667
A Märklin circuit from the 1950s.

312
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,542
Magnificent.

313
00:22:34,708 --> 00:22:37,042
I always loved trains.

314
00:22:37,208 --> 00:22:41,583
As a little boy, I was bullied
by my parents and friends.

315
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,500
To escape, I climbed on
some random train, and I was gone.

316
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,583
And look now.

317
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:54,875
On board the train to nowhere,
I enter a tunnel...

318
00:22:56,042 --> 00:23:00,292
...dark, sinister, intimidating.

319
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:03,833
I see the true face of existence.

320
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:08,583
I see light at the end of
the tunnel, an opening.

321
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,542
And when I come out, I am changed.

322
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:17,542
I am no longer that
fragile, frightened boy.

323
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:19,208
I am someone else.

324
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:24,792
It is dreadful to be bullied as a child.

325
00:23:24,958 --> 00:23:28,958
- You must have been very cute.
- Oh, yes.

326
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:36,292
Beautiful park, far from the gallery.

327
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,750
When not in Paris, what I miss
the most are the beautiful parks.

328
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:43,042
I'm running a bit late.
Not that important though.

329
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:48,625
I see you walking with that turtleneck,
and I see my whole life.

330
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:52,667
I see myself at school, you are
walking through the hallway.

331
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:57,250
You fly through the hallway,
my heart skips a beat.

332
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:02,083
And your book?
I do want to read something.

333
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:07,083
You're talking about chance and irony.
That makes me curious.

334
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,125
You believe deeply in luck.

335
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:14,833
Without coincidence, I wouldn't be in
this park sharing a salad with you.

336
00:24:15,042 --> 00:24:17,292
I have longed for you for a long time.

337
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,458
Three euros.

338
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,667
My favorite poet.

339
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,458
They find the right words.

340
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:49,208
For me, there is nothing
higher than poetry.

341
00:25:13,292 --> 00:25:15,583
I'm tired of doing nothing.

342
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,333
I too find you a bit gloomy.

343
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,500
No, it's fine.

344
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,917
Sorry, but I'm annoying.
I don't do it on purpose.

345
00:25:28,042 --> 00:25:30,167
When I'm busy, I have to keep going.

346
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:33,042
I have nothing to complain about.

347
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,667
No, leave it on.

348
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,583
I'm afraid it's going to rain.

349
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,583
That's why I thought, I live nearby,
I'll prepare something at home...

350
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,292
...and you can read a few pages.
- I'd love to.

351
00:26:05,458 --> 00:26:08,208
Can you cook? Or should I do that?

352
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:11,708
I have a limited culinary repertoire.

353
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:17,083
- I make a good spaghetti bolognese.
- I'd like that. Shall I help you?

354
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,208
Of course. Do you enjoy cooking?

355
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,625
Delicious. What kind of wine is this?

356
00:26:45,792 --> 00:26:47,917
No idea. It was on offer.

357
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,333
Jean only drinks expensive Burgundy.

358
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,958
Do you love the Parisian life?

359
00:26:56,167 --> 00:27:00,333
I love New York, grew up in Bretagne,
and always wanted to live in Paris.

360
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,375
I wanted to live here too,
until my marriage exploded.

361
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,917
Afterwards, the city tasted bitter.

362
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:11,917
I never wanted to be here again,
and be alone. But look.

363
00:27:12,125 --> 00:27:15,875
The beauty of my profession,
you work wherever you want.

364
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:21,083
I have written in Bogotá, and Mexico.
Even in Montreal.

365
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,125
Very nice apartment.

366
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:27,167
I found it like this, fully furnished.

367
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:30,750
I have already paid six months' rent.

368
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:34,125
Perfect for a writer. Bohemian.

369
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,208
I am lucky.

370
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,208
Do you see?

371
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:44,250
If I hadn't seen you on the street,
my life would be very different.

372
00:27:45,542 --> 00:27:46,875
What are you doing?

373
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,875
The magic of wine at work.

374
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,875
You know my situation.

375
00:27:54,625 --> 00:28:00,292
I'm in love with you. At school
in New York, and now in Paris.

376
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:05,750
I've been selfish. I shouldn't
have let things go so far.

377
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,042
Why did you then?

378
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,500
I like you, I enjoy
spending time with you.

379
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:15,625
I also notice that I'm
looking forward to our meetings.

380
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,250
Me too.

381
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,500
But it's not a good idea.

382
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:22,625
Can I ask a question?

383
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:26,583
- Are you happy as a couple?
- I don't know anymore.

384
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,792
I ended up in this marriage
after my hellish first husband.

385
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:34,250
Then Jean arrived.
Energetic and charming.

386
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:38,125
He took me by the hand
and wanted to get married right away.

387
00:28:38,292 --> 00:28:42,708
- He is crazy about you.
- But at times I feel like a trophy wife.

388
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,583
Do you love him?

389
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,500
Yes, I love him.

390
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,875
What am I doing?

391
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:55,208
- So far, nothing.
- Why do I keep thinking about you?

392
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:17,125
- Where were you today?
- At the gallery.

393
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:19,292
I called the gallery.

394
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:22,500
- I had a long lunch.
- And your phone?

395
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:25,542
It was on 'mute' the whole time.

396
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:28,958
- And if it had been urgent?
- Was it urgent?

397
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:30,583
No.

398
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,542
I want to be able to always reach you.

399
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,208
You can reach me at any time. I just
forgot to turn the sound back on.

400
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:42,792
- Too bad, I wanted to have lunch.
- I had a business lunch.

401
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:47,542
- With whom?
- People who wanted to sell a Basquiat.

402
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,167
Yes, that was unfortunate.

403
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:54,750
I had discovered a Japanese restaurant.
Where did you eat?

404
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:56,958
Huh?

405
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:00,500
Don't make it so difficult.
Where did you eat?

406
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,583
At Café Philippe.

407
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,333
Café Philippe?

408
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,375
That is very far. And with
that transport strike...

409
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,583
Yes, it was a misery.

410
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,708
It's nice that you're taking
this training seriously now.

411
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:20,625
Physical fitness is
the highest priority!

412
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,708
- Hello?
- It's me.

413
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:34,250
- Great to hear from you. Are you okay?
- I don't know.

414
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:39,042
Tell me, I want to know everything.
What's going on?

415
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,458
I don't know why I'm calling.

416
00:30:41,583 --> 00:30:43,250
I feel miserable.

417
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:47,417
I'm just happy to hear
your voice, that's all.

418
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,667
I don't know what to say.

419
00:30:52,208 --> 00:30:55,042
A love that has been
going on for so long...

420
00:30:57,167 --> 00:31:01,417
What else is there to say?
You are my first love.

421
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,708
Are you okay?
Who was that on the phone?

422
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:09,292
Earlier. You seemed tense.

423
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,583
- Oh, after training?
- Yes.

424
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,667
That was a client who keeps
changing their mind about an auction.

425
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:21,417
There are people who just
can't make a decision.

426
00:31:23,167 --> 00:31:25,750
Me, I make decisions.

427
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,125
And I stick to them.

428
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:41,375
- Thank you. How much is it?
- Three euros.

429
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,917
I find it dreadful to lie.

430
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,667
But I am lying, right?

431
00:31:54,833 --> 00:31:56,667
Thank you, Madame.

432
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,208
What is that?

433
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:03,833
You asked about my book,
and I believe in luck.

434
00:32:04,042 --> 00:32:09,708
Friday there is a huge draw,
with a one in 139,838,260 chance.

435
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:14,208
So it's very small.
But the chance of being born...

436
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:17,917
...is one in four hundred billion.

437
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:20,958
You already have
the grand prize in your grasp.

438
00:32:21,167 --> 00:32:27,042
The chance is inconceivably
unlikely for every person on Earth.

439
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,458
Don't waste the miracle that is you.

440
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,875
That is the real miracle.

441
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,625
- I have a lover.
- No, really?

442
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:59,500
I must talk to someone. If Jean
finds out, it's the end of the marriage.

443
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,625
What am I doing?
I'm completely wrong.

444
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:07,500
- Who is it? Or don't you want to tell?
- That guy on the street.

445
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:10,708
I have told you about him.
The one from the Lycée.

446
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,792
- How long has it been going on?
- I hope I'm not in a romantic delirium.

447
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:18,958
- Is it really serious?
- I swore I wouldn't be swept up in it.

448
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,500
But with each day, the more
I fantasise, the more I feel.

449
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,125
He is writing a book here.

450
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:26,792
Some good advice.

451
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:31,250
Leave him now while you still can.
Before your marriage falls apart.

452
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:35,667
I try to tell myself, this is just
an adventure, I still love Jean.

453
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:40,458
But I have something with that guy.
I don't understand it, and that's scary.

454
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:45,250
I have to let go of everything for him.
He has been waiting his whole life.

455
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:49,417
Ironically, everyone sees you
as the perfect couple.

456
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:52,167
Sometimes I see myself running away
with him and change everything.

457
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:57,333
But I don't want to give up what I have.
I want children, but I only have fears.

458
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,917
It will be fine.

459
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,667
Hello, darling.

460
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,208
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

461
00:34:25,375 --> 00:34:29,833
- I saw you holding something.
- It's nothing.

462
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:32,833
No.

463
00:34:33,042 --> 00:34:37,167
- Show me what you're hiding.
- Alright, I'll show you.

464
00:34:37,333 --> 00:34:41,125
- This is what I hide.
- A lottery ticket!

465
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,417
How did you get it? Did you buy it?

466
00:34:43,542 --> 00:34:48,792
- Since when have you been playing?
- I read that there was a big draw.

467
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,500
A big draw.

468
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:54,042
- Do you know what the chance is?
- Yes, it's minimal.

469
00:34:54,208 --> 00:34:57,167
You have to play your whole life...

470
00:34:57,333 --> 00:35:00,542
- ...many lives even, to win.
- Give it to me.

471
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:04,750
- Someone is going to win.
- They always say that.

472
00:35:04,917 --> 00:35:07,792
It's a total fraud.

473
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:10,417
But why were you hiding that?

474
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,750
Are you afraid that
I'd think you're stupid?

475
00:35:14,917 --> 00:35:18,417
Sweetheart, I never think that of you.

476
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:29,708
Hello.

477
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:33,500
No, she is out to lunch.

478
00:35:33,667 --> 00:35:37,208
No idea. She said it could
take the whole afternoon.

479
00:35:38,458 --> 00:35:44,708
- I can't relax when we're outside.
- Isn't this great, far from the office?

480
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,875
We don't know anyone.

481
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:53,833
Hello.

482
00:35:56,833 --> 00:36:00,958
I'm in a park with a sandwich.
The weather is beautiful.

483
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,500
Are you alone?

484
00:36:03,042 --> 00:36:05,125
I have a newspaper.

485
00:36:05,292 --> 00:36:06,500
Should I come?

486
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:10,500
Don't bother, I'm almost done.

487
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,542
Good, have a nice afternoon.

488
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,083
Great.

489
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:23,250
- Do you write by hand?
- Always.

490
00:37:23,417 --> 00:37:27,917
- And when I'm finished, that's it.
- Fascinating, that creative process.

491
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:30,792
I write page after page without rest.

492
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,417
I hate rereading.

493
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,708
What are you thinking about?

494
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:43,250
- Time goes too fast since I met you.
- Do you still want to return to London?

495
00:37:43,417 --> 00:37:45,292
No, not really.

496
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:47,250
No one is waiting for me.

497
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,958
No family, no girlfriend.

498
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:55,375
I feel good here.
I am liking it more and more.

499
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:59,500
That is definitely thanks to you.
You make it idyllic.

500
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:06,083
To be honest, I think I'll stay here.

501
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,708
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, not at all.

502
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:17,208
- I'm confused in my head.
- I don't want to put pressure on you.

503
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:21,500
- I know.
- You're married, that's how it'll stay.

504
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:27,458
If you ever decide on something else,
I'll be there for you.

505
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:53,333
Hello.

506
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,083
This way.

507
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,417
Josephine, my associate.
Please have a seat.

508
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,617
How can I help you?

509
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,500
I think my wife has a lover.

510
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,833
I want clarity on that.

511
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:20,500
- Why do you think so?
- Numerous small details.

512
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,125
Nothing decisive,
but I sense the signals.

513
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:31,792
I may be mistaken.
I hope I am mistaken. I love her.

514
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,500
But I need to know.

515
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:38,500
- Do you have any idea who the lover is?
- No, not really.

516
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:43,542
Many men find her beautiful.
A charming woman.

517
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,375
Delicious.

518
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,500
Extremely desirable.

519
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:53,083
I need to know everything about her.
With photos, if possible.

520
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,292
How fast does this go?

521
00:39:55,458 --> 00:40:00,458
It depends on what your wife does,
but generally it goes quickly.

522
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:03,542
I do count on your discretion.

523
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:06,208
Do you really want to know the truth?

524
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,833
Yes, I'm sure.

525
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:14,583
Sometimes it's such a short affair
that the spouse doesn't notice.

526
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,292
Then, after such a slip-up,
the couple can move on and be happy.

527
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,292
Mr. Fournier?

528
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:27,917
What did you say? I'm sorry.

529
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,875
Do your investigation.

530
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:34,292
I provide the necessary information
and a photo of my wife.

531
00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:40,167
Happy birthday, Jean.

532
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,708
Thank you, everyone.

533
00:40:46,875 --> 00:40:52,375
I'm getting older but not wiser.
No instruction manual, huh?

534
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,208
We are celebrating André's birthday
in Venice. You are coming?

535
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,792
- I love Venice, but...
- But?

536
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,583
I thought we had agreed.
You would take time off.

537
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,875
I spoke to your wife.
She is a very fascinating person.

538
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:15,208
- Your wife too.
- And beautiful, right? Very beautiful.

539
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:18,458
I admit that.

540
00:41:18,583 --> 00:41:21,333
Thank you for the invitation.

541
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:27,917
- She chose this incredible place?
- We come here often, but she likes it.

542
00:41:28,125 --> 00:41:31,500
We are lucky to have
such beautiful women.

543
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:36,375
Aren't you ever afraid that
she might find someone else attractive?

544
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,667
At first, I was, but...

545
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:43,625
...it's not in Marion's DNA to cheat.

546
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:45,917
But everything's possible of course.

547
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:48,500
Do you still remember Olivier Wargon?

548
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:53,375
He found his wife in the arms
of the marriage counselor.

549
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,375
A sad and grotesque story.

550
00:41:56,375 --> 00:41:59,583
Marion would never take advantage of me.

551
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:05,917
First of all, it's not in her nature.
And she knows she'll be out at once.

552
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:09,333
Imagine those two in bed...

553
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:12,833
...mocking the humiliated husband...

554
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:19,667
So... back to reality.

555
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:23,333
We are really happy with our...

556
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:27,083
Have you seen my train obsession yet?

557
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,792
- Absolutely, very impressive.
- Very beautiful, isn't it?

558
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,375
- All that fine technology...
- It's incredible.

559
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:05,833
Excuse me.

560
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:11,083
Welcome.

561
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:13,417
Two glasses of red.

562
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:51,375
A beer, please.

563
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,833
Coming soon.

564
00:44:20,167 --> 00:44:21,875
<i>I need to speak to Jean.</i>

565
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:26,917
<i>I need time to think,
to take care of everything.</i>

566
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:30,042
<i>I love you.</i>

567
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:33,167
<i>Tell me honestly. Do you love me too?</i>

568
00:44:33,333 --> 00:44:36,083
<i>At first, I thought...</i>

569
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,875
<i>...that we could be two friends
from the Lycée.</i>

570
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:43,292
<i>But now I want to be
with you all the time.</i>

571
00:44:43,458 --> 00:44:47,208
<i>And we just happened to run
into each other. What an irony.</i>

572
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,875
I don't believe in irony...

573
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:52,625
...nor in coincidence.

574
00:44:52,792 --> 00:44:57,667
I despise people who rely on luck.
Luck doesn't exist.

575
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,583
You must force things.

576
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:04,333
- I'm sorry.
- Yes, it is ugly.

577
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,625
But reality is rarely beautiful.

578
00:45:07,792 --> 00:45:09,042
Want to have a drink?

579
00:45:09,208 --> 00:45:10,792
Who is the guy?

580
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,917
- Everything is in the report.
- Cognac, please.

581
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:18,208
I'm glad she's better, Mom.

582
00:45:19,625 --> 00:45:22,542
Just come when you want.
Your room is always ready.

583
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,583
It's okay. I just need to
make some decisions.

584
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,542
I will explain when you're here.

585
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:32,750
Jean will be home soon. I'll hang up.

586
00:45:32,917 --> 00:45:35,708
Good evening, sweetheart.
Who was that?

587
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:38,333
- My mother.
- Is she coming soon?

588
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,708
- Yes, in a few days.
- I can't wait. She is so delightful.

589
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,917
Shall we stay home tonight?

590
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:49,292
- You've been late all week.
- Good idea.

591
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:53,833
I still have some work to do,
so you can read in peace.

592
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,667
- How is your work?
- It's quite intense.

593
00:45:57,833 --> 00:46:00,500
Sorry if I have seemed
a bit concerned lately.

594
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,500
Everything will be fine.

595
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:06,833
I am going to make a call.
Can you ask for a cognac for me?

596
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:09,875
Suzanne, Monsieur would like a cognac.

597
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,917
No, the other side. To the left.

598
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,292
Hello?

599
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:22,708
- Can you talk?
- Yes. Is there a problem?

600
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:27,792
We must meet.
Nothing we can't fix.

601
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,417
Can you do tomorrow at 3:00 PM,
at the usual place?

602
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,708
Okay. See you tomorrow.

603
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,583
Everything's fine?

604
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:48,625
I've been thinking today
about how we met.

605
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:53,833
The first time I saw you, that famous
New Year's Eve at Fred Fox's.

606
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:56,375
With your black dress...

607
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,208
- Just after the divorce, unhappy.
- I never told you...

608
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,500
...but the first time
I approached you...

609
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:09,833
...I was desperately hoping
that you weren't a fool.

610
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,417
Thank you, Suzanne.
You were the completely opposite.

611
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,417
Conquering.

612
00:47:18,833 --> 00:47:20,167
Loyal.

613
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:23,333
Everything I could wish for in a woman.

614
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:28,000
Are you alright?

615
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:31,625
The song of that moment is
still stuck in my head.

616
00:47:32,167 --> 00:47:33,875
What are you doing? Are you crying?

617
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:36,375
No.

618
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,583
- Nostalgia always makes me sad.
- It doesn't have to.

619
00:47:41,083 --> 00:47:43,000
Everything went well.

620
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:45,492
With you, I am the happiest
man in the world.

621
00:47:59,542 --> 00:48:04,042
Here, the photo and the address.
There should be nothing left.

622
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,917
Not like last time. Completely gone.
Goodbye, forever.

623
00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:11,042
We have an airplane.

624
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:13,708
We can throw it out over the Atlantic.

625
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:17,500
- That's not very nice, huh, Dragos?
- Definitely.

626
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:21,833
But when certain people die,
things will automatically get better.

627
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:24,417
More fresh air for everyone.

628
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:29,083
- We sorted your partner out well.
- I've worked like mad to get my money.

629
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:33,500
I was not born rich, so now I think
I have earned the right to enjoy it.

630
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,667
We will handle this problem.

631
00:48:35,833 --> 00:48:37,917
He'll disappear. Right, Milos?

632
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:44,125
Strange, I hadn't dreamed for years,
but it started after we met.

633
00:48:44,292 --> 00:48:45,875
Isn't that strange?

634
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,500
Last night, I dreamed
we were living in Mexico.

635
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:52,417
Just because you talked
about it the other day.

636
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:57,875
A simple life with children.
We walked in the rain.

637
00:48:58,083 --> 00:49:02,250
When I woke up, I felt happy.
I have been all morning.

638
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,500
We share the same dreams.
That's already it.

639
00:49:07,208 --> 00:49:10,583
I keep reading the poems
you gave me over and over again.

640
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:11,833
Beautiful, aren't they?

641
00:49:12,042 --> 00:49:17,208
In Mallarmé, about the stork
trapped in the ice, I cry every time.

642
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:19,917
We'll all end up in the ice.

643
00:49:20,125 --> 00:49:22,917
If we do nothing before winter.

644
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,500
Before the ice covers everything.

645
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:27,875
Then we'll be stuck forever.

646
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,292
Jean is a fabulous man.

647
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:38,708
I have to be honest with him,
if we want to have a future together.

648
00:50:57,875 --> 00:50:59,500
Sold.

649
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,750
- Did the auction go well?
- Yes, Jean. I want to talk...

650
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:09,750
Later, we are late. Marc and Linda are
waiting in the restaurant. Hurry.

651
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:45,208
- You know we were
going to Saint-Martin?

652
00:51:56,417 --> 00:52:00,167
- What was the local delicacy?
- Pig's nose.

653
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:20,125
That's how it goes.
On the other hand, someone dies.

654
00:52:20,292 --> 00:52:25,500
That's life. You eat, you sleep,
you live, you die.

655
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,458
- Are you okay?
- My head is spinning.

656
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:48,083
- You should've stuck to the white wine.
- Why didn't you stop me then?

657
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,292
I'm your husband, not your chaperone.

658
00:52:51,458 --> 00:52:54,500
And it was very nice.

659
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:56,000
Wasn't it?

660
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,708
Done.

661
00:53:12,167 --> 00:53:13,375
Definitely?

662
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:16,917
It's at the bottom of the ocean.

663
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:21,250
Did you take all his belongings?

664
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:24,667
Diary, computer, phone numbers?

665
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,125
Perfect. We will meet tomorrow
at 3:00 PM at the usual place.

666
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,375
You will not be disappointed.

667
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,208
Has Monsieur gone?

668
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:47,500
He had to leave early
and didn't want to wake you up.

669
00:53:47,625 --> 00:53:52,250
He said you were not well yesterday.
Do you want something?

670
00:53:52,417 --> 00:53:54,667
Some coffee, please.

671
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:27,250
It's me, I have news.
Call me as soon as you can.

672
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:33,333
The jewels of our Saudi client
need to be photographed.

673
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,625
- Shall I order something for lunch?
- I have a lunch appointment.

674
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:38,125
Thank you.

675
00:55:00,667 --> 00:55:05,625
Hi, darling. I wanted to check in,
because you were a bit tipsy yesterday.

676
00:55:05,792 --> 00:55:08,333
I'm okay. I'm having
lunch with clients.

677
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,917
- Where?
- I don't know yet.

678
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:14,417
Good. Big hug, see you tonight.

679
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:17,458
Hopefully you'll be better. Goodbye.

680
00:55:19,542 --> 00:55:23,292
- Do you need anything?
- The photos of the Saudi jewels.

681
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:27,583
- Oh yes. Okay...
- It's too many. Please choose some.

682
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,542
Yes, I should have done that.
I forgot.

683
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,500
This is fine.

684
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:38,417
Are you okay? You seem distracted.

685
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,667
Do you need to call someone?

686
00:55:41,833 --> 00:55:46,750
- Do you mind? It will be brief.
- Go ahead. Do I need to leave?

687
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,667
I have been calling since
this morning. Where are you?

688
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:00,667
I'm worried. Call me back.

689
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,042
Alain? Are you there?

690
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,292
What's wrong, honey?

691
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,375
- You have nothing on your plate.
- What?

692
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:48,750
Are you not feeling well?
You haven't eaten anything.

693
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:50,833
I am tired, that's all.

694
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,917
You're still paying for all that vodka?

695
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,208
Eat something. It's not good
to have an empty stomach.

696
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,792
I think I have to vomit.

697
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,167
- Are you okay?
- Why is everyone asking that! I'm fine!

698
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:46,000
- Sorry, but you give the impression...
- I had a bad night's sleep.

699
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:48,042
Leave me alone, please.

700
00:58:50,292 --> 00:58:52,500
- Did it go well?
- Yes.

701
00:58:52,667 --> 00:58:55,958
Very well. But I'm happy
to finally rest for a while.

702
00:58:56,167 --> 00:59:00,375
- You look a bit pale.
- She drank a lot a few days ago...

703
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,750
- ... and since she hasn't been herself.
- I don't sleep well.

704
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:05,958
- She works too hard.
- It will be fine.

705
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,208
- Of course, sweetheart.
- That's not like you.

706
00:59:09,375 --> 00:59:14,958
- You don't drink, you sleep like a baby.
- I'm okay, I'm not sick.

707
00:59:15,167 --> 00:59:19,833
- I'll shut up if you go on like this.
- We'll leave her alone.

708
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:25,500
- Let's go enjoy this beautiful weather.
- Let me catch my breath for a moment.

709
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:33,500
- Has she been like this long?
- No, she works too much. That's all.

710
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:38,250
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Yes, you're excellent at that.

711
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,333
- What's bothering you?
- I don't want to talk about it.

712
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:54,792
- I can see something is really wrong.
- Okay, fine with me.

713
00:59:54,958 --> 01:00:01,208
Enough. I don't know what's going on,
but tell me. Jean doesn't deserve this.

714
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:04,292
Jean indeed doesn't deserve it.

715
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:06,292
And that means?

716
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:10,083
You don't understand,
you'll hate me if I tell.

717
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,542
Because you have a lover?

718
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,583
How could you guess?

719
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:19,292
I'm not stupid.

720
01:00:19,458 --> 01:00:25,500
You are a bundle of nerves.
Jean thinks it is overwork.

721
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:30,750
You change your appearance,
you start exercising. It is clear to me.

722
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:33,500
Okay, who is the guy?

723
01:00:33,625 --> 01:00:38,625
- Obviously he can't be as great as Jean.
- It started some months ago.

724
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:43,000
I ran into him on the street.
I know him from school.

725
01:00:43,208 --> 01:00:45,708
I don't understand how you can
cheat on a man like Jean?

726
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:50,667
You don't cheat on such an amazing man
with a loser, like your first husband.

727
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,542
He isn't a loser.

728
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:56,000
Everything's fine as long as you sleep
with him but stay with your husband.

729
01:00:56,208 --> 01:01:01,083
But if you ever tell him that
you're leaving Jean, he'll be gone.

730
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:04,000
- It's classic.
- He left no message, nothing!

731
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:06,500
It's not like him! He was crazy
about me at the Lycée.

732
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:10,417
- Maybe something happened to him.
- Like what?

733
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:14,167
Who would harm him?
A peaceful poet, with no enemies?

734
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:19,458
Nothing suspicious about his apartment.
He had just removed everything.

735
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:23,333
Obviously, he must have had doubts,
and didn't have the courage to tell me.

736
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,792
- I still wonder if you shouldn't go
to the police. - I did!

737
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:30,667
But when they asked for my name,
I panicked and hung up.

738
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,500
Honestly, it would surprise me
if something had happened to him.

739
01:01:33,667 --> 01:01:37,208
I won't even check on the morgue,
he wouldn't have taken his things there.

740
01:01:37,375 --> 01:01:42,667
- You can always go take a look.
- Stop dramatising. He's not there.

741
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:45,667
I'm not going to get my name mixed up
in this. Jean must not know.

742
01:01:45,833 --> 01:01:51,333
It's so obvious. As a married woman,
Alain was happy to be with me in secret.

743
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,792
And sleep with me. But as soon as he
realised I might leave Jean, he fled.

744
01:01:56,958 --> 01:02:00,125
Are you sure you can't make
things work out with Jean?

745
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:03,542
No, to him I'm just
a child he can spoil.

746
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,333
There you are.

747
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:09,792
- What's it about, you look so serious?
- None of your business!

748
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:14,833
Well, while you were chatting,
I had a brilliant idea.

749
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,875
We have friends in the US,
Jack and Rita Prescott.

750
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:23,708
Jack told me they are going to renew
their wedding vows with a big party.

751
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:27,167
A brilliant, extremely romantic idea.
We're going to do it too.

752
01:02:27,333 --> 01:02:32,208
Your mother is here, so that
works out nicely. What do you think?

753
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:34,500
What?

754
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:38,708
- We'll celebrate our years together.
- What a cute idea.

755
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,917
Oh, dear. You're not saying anything.

756
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:46,833
No, don't worry. Just...

757
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,750
- Don't you find it a bit cheesy?
- Very American, yes.

758
01:02:50,917 --> 01:02:53,925
I don't care, I think it's cute.

759
01:02:54,092 --> 01:02:57,833
It's usual in the US. I helped out at
such a party with your dad in Brooklyn.

760
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:00,917
It was very touching.

761
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:05,625
Okay, you're right. It's cute.
Sorry for acting like this.

762
01:03:05,792 --> 01:03:11,500
It doesn't have to be the party of
the century. Just our circle of friends.

763
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,875
I already know what I'm going to wear.

764
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:21,167
Thank you for coming. We're now
going to renew our wedding vows.

765
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:39,167
Love is very complicated.
The heart is ruthless.

766
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:43,125
Becauses it's about feelings,
and they don't compromise.

767
01:03:43,292 --> 01:03:48,375
- Some people find each other, for life.
- Well, it's called luck.

768
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:53,167
- Others have the need to renew the vow.
- But this ceremony is magnificent!

769
01:03:59,292 --> 01:04:03,250
To the health of the old newlyweds.

770
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:08,917
We got married on a boat
along the Dalmatian coast.

771
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:12,917
We got very sea sick. A bad omen.

772
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:16,792
- 15 years later we are still together.
- And still seasick.

773
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,917
I felt a bit sad during the ceremony.

774
01:04:20,125 --> 01:04:22,833
The daughter of our neighbors
was about to get married.

775
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,625
She was left behind in the church.
Her entire family was present.

776
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:32,792
Yes, that scoundrel of a fiancé
was gone, without explanation.

777
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:38,792
A month later, in Panama,
he was found married to a porn actress.

778
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:43,250
It's common to panic
just before committing.

779
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:48,583
- More often with men than women.
- Wait until the last moment, then bail.

780
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,583
- Obviously.
- I saw a documentary...

781
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:54,833
...about the increasing number of
people who disappear.

782
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,333
There is now evidence
of who is behind it.

783
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,083
Aliens.

784
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:06,583
I swear that not a single scared fiancé
has been abducted by aliens.

785
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:11,125
- It is not impossible though.
- Anything is possible now.

786
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:15,458
Jean's former partner could be
on a spaceship in another galaxy.

787
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:18,875
Didn't his body resurface in a lake?

788
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:23,292
Or perhaps they weren't sure it was him.
He disappeared years ago...

789
01:05:23,458 --> 01:05:28,917
...under mysterious circumstances.
He could well be on Mars or Jupiter!

790
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:35,125
- Not in the arms of a Panama prostitute.
- So Jean's partner disappeared?

791
01:05:35,292 --> 01:05:39,792
Yes, it was in the news! Can't remember
the details but he was suddenly gone.

792
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:45,625
Some said it had to do with embezzlement
or something like that.

793
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:50,500
Recently, it was reported
that a body had been found.

794
01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:56,375
The police were not sure it was him.
I don't think the case was ever closed.

795
01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,625
Abducted by aliens,
and the government is hiding it.

796
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:07,292
Very nice. Your friends are all nice.

797
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:11,458
- What an evening, what a day.
- So nice you were here.

798
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:15,000
- I'll turn in now.
- Goodnight.

799
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:22,500
I am exhausted. I had just white wine
and some champagne. I'll take a shower.

800
01:06:22,667 --> 01:06:27,667
It was a success, and we have
absolutely wonderful friends.

801
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:30,958
They all found you more
beautiful than ever.

802
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,625
- And you were wild.
- Because I was happy.

803
01:06:33,792 --> 01:06:38,542
- You drank more than ever before.
- I am also happier than ever before.

804
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:41,792
May I confess something?

805
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,750
The last few months,
I've been a bit crazy.

806
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:53,167
I was overworked, lost my footing
and sense of what's essential.

807
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:56,667
For a time I was annoying or absent.

808
01:06:56,833 --> 01:06:58,875
Now it's over.

809
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:04,625
It was a bad time. That's what I wanted
to say. Now I feel really strong.

810
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:08,500
I have thought about things too.

811
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:12,208
It's time to talk
about children again.

812
01:07:13,625 --> 01:07:15,250
Fantastic.

813
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:18,250
- I'm so lucky.
- No, it's me who's lucky.

814
01:07:18,417 --> 01:07:21,750
But you don't believe in
luck or coincidence.

815
01:07:21,917 --> 01:07:24,958
That's because I create my own luck.

816
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:34,708
Jean?

817
01:07:34,875 --> 01:07:36,583
Yes?

818
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:41,125
They told a strange story
about your partner.

819
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:44,167
That he disappeared some years ago.

820
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:47,125
You too? Who told you that?

821
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:49,958
A bit of an eccentric. One Gilles.

822
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:53,375
He claimed aliens are abducting people.

823
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:59,167
- Then someone mentioned your partner.
- What a jerk, that Gilles.

824
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:03,875
A drunkard, totally off his rocker.
Always aliens.

825
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:08,625
I understand that the case
caused a stir at the time.

826
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:13,250
- They even spoke of murder.
- That lasted a week or two.

827
01:08:13,417 --> 01:08:17,417
People became paranoid and
came with wacky accusations.

828
01:08:17,542 --> 01:08:20,500
What did they say?

829
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:22,875
Something about our business.

830
01:08:23,082 --> 01:08:26,832
Honestly, Camille, my partner was crazy.

831
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,917
He invented many stories,
I was supposed to have embezzled. Me!

832
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:32,917
Honestly, some people, Camille...

833
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:36,332
Then he just suddenly disappeared.

834
01:08:36,792 --> 01:08:38,917
What do you think about it?

835
01:08:39,125 --> 01:08:41,750
Not bad.

836
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:46,000
- Alain would have liked it.
- Do you still think about him?

837
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:49,332
Only when I'm angry because
he made a fool of me.

838
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,917
I feel guilty for cheating on Jean.
I'll do everything to make up for it.

839
01:08:52,125 --> 01:08:57,167
- And you're sure Jean doesn't know?
- Yes, completely sure.

840
01:08:57,332 --> 01:09:01,000
And you're sure his disappearance
isn't suspicious?

841
01:09:01,207 --> 01:09:04,792
Yes, I am not like you,
a twisted mind full of distrust.

842
01:09:04,957 --> 01:09:08,917
I am very gentle, just like Dad.

843
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:13,207
You remind me of that guy
who believed in UFOs.

844
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,417
Mom...

845
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:20,832
Alain wasn't taken by aliens,
he simply dumped me.

846
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,917
Why are you asking so much?

847
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:26,542
To give free rein to my macabre mind.

848
01:09:26,707 --> 01:09:31,917
Please stop your sinister imagination,
and read fewer crime thrillers.

849
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:36,167
A BUSINESSMAN DISAPPEARED

850
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:02,500
DELAUNY DETECTIVE AGENCY

851
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:15,250
Thank you very much.

852
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:17,375
Have you finished your book?

853
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,083
I ran into your mother this
afternoon reading at a café.

854
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,458
She was so engrossed by the book
that she got startled by me.

855
01:11:23,583 --> 01:11:26,750
- What kind of book was that?
- A Simenon.

856
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:31,625
I've read one detective novel in
my whole life. I don't like them.

857
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:35,125
In the books private detectives
are always extremely glamorous.

858
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:38,083
In reality, when I've dealt with them,
I was very disappointed.

859
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,250
Apart from in films and literature,
they are unintelligent.

860
01:11:41,417 --> 01:11:45,833
- Have you ever used detectives?
- Yes, for my work.

861
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,367
There are lots of shenanigans
in the financial world.

862
01:11:48,467 --> 01:11:51,667
I can imagine.

863
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:23,250
Mr. Fournier recommended you.
Jean Fournier.

864
01:12:23,417 --> 01:12:27,750
When it comes to infidelity,
you are a very good detective, he said.

865
01:12:27,917 --> 01:12:31,958
He had marital problems but
you handled it discreetly.

866
01:12:32,167 --> 01:12:35,750
Discretion is of the utmost
importance to me.

867
01:12:35,917 --> 01:12:41,417
We are proud to be both efficient and
discreet, as Mr. Fournier can confirm.

868
01:12:41,542 --> 01:12:45,417
I have the impression that
my husband is cheating on me.

869
01:12:45,542 --> 01:12:48,500
I want clarity on that.

870
01:12:48,667 --> 01:12:51,250
We need information.

871
01:12:51,417 --> 01:12:55,167
- Addresses, photos if possible.
- Yes.

872
01:12:55,333 --> 01:13:00,125
Great. I'll bring it next time.

873
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,333
At our second meeting?

874
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:08,208
I just wanted to know
how much time you need.

875
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:10,333
And how much it costs, of course.

876
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,000
Our hourly rate is 450 euros.

877
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:15,917
Well, that is expensive...

878
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:20,292
...for following a husband,
or in Mr. Fournier's case, a wife.

879
01:13:20,458 --> 01:13:25,333
There are cheaper agencies,
but we deliver top quality.

880
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:28,583
The required time
depends on the person.

881
01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:30,625
Of course, that's right.

882
01:13:30,792 --> 01:13:34,500
- Do you have any further questions?
- No, I'm fine.

883
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:36,708
So far. Thank you very much.

884
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:39,500
I will call you again soon.

885
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:44,250
- I... Thank you very much.
- I hope you enjoyed the information.

886
01:13:45,625 --> 01:13:48,625
- Goodbye and thank you.
- Goodbye.

887
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,583
Hello.

888
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,375
Mr. Fournier, Henri from Delauny.
Do you have a moment?

889
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:01,292
Yes, I'm listening.

890
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:05,500
There was a lady here
who said that you sent her.

891
01:14:05,667 --> 01:14:10,917
She was not at ease, and very suspect.
She seemed like an investigator.

892
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,125
- Straight, chestnut hair, golden glasses.
- I guess you didn't tell her anything?

893
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:22,375
Certainly not. It didn't feel right.
That's why I'm calling right away.

894
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,417
She clumsily asked about our work.

895
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:29,583
I knew she wasn't coming back.
I'll keep you informed.

896
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:31,700
But did you say something?

897
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:33,500
Nothing at all.

898
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:37,458
She seemed to know
that you employed us.

899
01:14:39,458 --> 01:14:42,625
If you haven't said anything, it's okay.

900
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:47,083
Thank you for the warning. Goodbye.

901
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:57,417
That's the lamp I was talking about.
For our bedroom after a renovation.

902
01:14:57,542 --> 01:15:00,917
- Not bad.
- It was Mom who found it.

903
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:03,625
- Will she be staying long?
- No idea.

904
01:15:03,792 --> 01:15:07,542
- She is so happy in Paris.
- What is she doing in the daytime?

905
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,917
Museums, antique shops.

906
01:15:11,125 --> 01:15:17,125
She loves walking, doing her own things.
She has always been like that.

907
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:19,500
Welcome.

908
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:24,000
Great idea to have lunch together.
I thought you were going to Versailles.

909
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:25,958
We need to talk.

910
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:28,292
Oh dear. This sounds serious.

911
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:32,917
I want you to listen
until I have finished.

912
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,917
I know your life has been
a roller coaster lately.

913
01:15:36,125 --> 01:15:39,792
And you're convinced there is nothing
suspect about Alain's disappearance...

914
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:43,750
- But I think it is.
- And why do you think that.

915
01:15:43,917 --> 01:15:45,750
Nothing concrete at the beginning...

916
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:50,500
...but something clicked with
that nonsense about aliens.

917
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:52,500
Are you crazy?

918
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:57,125
The nonsense about
alien abductors got to me...

919
01:15:57,292 --> 01:16:00,333
- Mom, come on.
- I did say 'nonsense'.

920
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:04,500
Then, I'm almost finished,
the conversation turned to...

921
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:09,500
...the disappearance of Jean's
partner who went missing...

922
01:16:09,625 --> 01:16:11,125
...exactly like Alain.

923
01:16:11,292 --> 01:16:15,917
That was long before I met Jean and the
case was resolved. They found the body.

924
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:18,750
It was perhaps suicide.
I don't know the details.

925
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:23,500
I do. Jean has taken advantage
of that disappearance.

926
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,667
Meaning?

927
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:29,208
He disappeared like Alain,
and Jean benefited a lot from it.

928
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:34,458
At the time, they talked about
suicide, kidnapping, even murder.

929
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:36,708
What are you suggesting now?

930
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:40,667
All I say is, in both cases
Jean had a motive and an interest.

931
01:16:40,833 --> 01:16:42,958
We are done with this.

932
01:16:44,167 --> 01:16:48,583
What if Jean knew about your affair?

933
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,917
What if he suspected?
- Out of the question.

934
01:16:51,125 --> 01:16:53,417
- Did he have you followed?
- How?

935
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:56,333
- By a private detective.
- You're just talking nonsense.

936
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:01,083
- I'm sure he hired someone.
- How?

937
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:06,708
I found a detective card
in the drawer of his desk.

938
01:17:06,875 --> 01:17:09,917
- You went through his things?
- I visited that detective.

939
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:15,583
Supposedly due to my cheating husband,
on the advice of Jean Fournier...

940
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:19,375
...who had been delighted
with his services.

941
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,583
I can't believe my ears.

942
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:25,833
- It explains everything.
- What does it explain?

943
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,250
- Jean getting rid of Alain? Nonsense!
- It's worth investigating further.

944
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:35,292
Sorry, I'm not hungry anymore.

945
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:42,625
Wait a moment!

946
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:46,292
- Listen to me!
- I'm not interested anymore.

947
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:49,542
I betrayed a man who
never stopped loving me...

948
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,750
...who I want to have children with.

949
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:56,500
Okay, I'm cheating on him with someone
out of my past. According to you...

950
01:17:56,667 --> 01:17:59,500
...he has me followed...

951
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:02,167
- ...and then he makes Alain disappear.
- Yes!

952
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:07,708
Why were you looking at me like that?

953
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:12,042
You have looked at me
strangely since morning.

954
01:18:12,208 --> 01:18:16,875
- Do you feel guilty about anything?
- No, not at all.

955
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:19,208
Wait, I can't go on.

956
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,750
Better than running indoors.

957
01:18:27,083 --> 01:18:31,125
At work they said you had
lunch with your mother.

958
01:18:31,292 --> 01:18:36,708
- We had an argument.
- About what?

959
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:40,125
You know her.
A boundless imagination...

960
01:18:40,292 --> 01:18:42,792
...that she feeds with soap operas
on TV and detective novels.

961
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:45,208
Perhaps she has a bit of
bad influence on you now?

962
01:18:45,375 --> 01:18:50,750
Sometimes she forgets her medication.
A day without makes her a bit paranoid.

963
01:18:50,917 --> 01:18:55,250
- Sometimes very paranoid.
- She must not forget her medication.

964
01:18:55,417 --> 01:18:59,542
- Paranoid about what?
- She reads too many detective novels.

965
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,500
I was going to take a shower.
Do you want anything?

966
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:16,375
I want to see if you were less paranoid.

967
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,583
I'm absolutely not paranoid.

968
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,458
He had you followed
and knew you were cheating.

969
01:19:21,583 --> 01:19:25,083
- Are you taking all your medication?
- Like clockwork.

970
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:28,292
Sometimes you forget them.
Then it won't work.

971
01:19:28,458 --> 01:19:33,833
Even if I forget once in a while,
all my suspicions don't come from that.

972
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:38,792
If I didn't love you, I would really
be insulted by your obsession with Jean.

973
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:43,500
- Let it go, please.
- I'm not a professional detective.

974
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:48,375
I want to explain it to a professional
to see what they think.

975
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:51,458
- What kind of professional?
- No idea.

976
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:55,708
I still think you should
tell everything to the police.

977
01:19:55,875 --> 01:20:00,333
I hope you're joking. Am I going
to say that I cheated on him?

978
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,125
From now on...

979
01:20:02,292 --> 01:20:07,333
... I want you to only think about
hunting, hiking, fishing, and having fun.

980
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:10,667
Nothing must go wrong now, Dragos.

981
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:13,667
- It has to look like an accident.
- What kind?

982
01:20:13,833 --> 01:20:15,917
It must be flawless.

983
01:20:16,125 --> 01:20:19,833
- Who is it? What kind of accident?
- A hunting accident.

984
01:20:20,042 --> 01:20:24,625
I will take her to a place in the woods.
You will be waiting there.

985
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:29,458
When you see her, you'll shoot,
like a hunter who makes a bad mistake.

986
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:31,708
The kind of hunter who thought
he saw an animal?

987
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:37,500
A large one. There are many deer
and hunters there. Can easily go wrong.

988
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,375
The police might have many questions.

989
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,750
I'll give you a hunting license
and a rifle. I'll take care of it.

990
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:49,625
You have the right to hunt,
it is tragic, and you are devastated.

991
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:53,875
But it must be your gun, not mine.

992
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,417
Do you understand?

993
01:20:55,542 --> 01:21:01,375
You're full of apologies. The police
can't do anything, it was an accident...

994
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:02,625
Dragos.

995
01:21:02,792 --> 01:21:06,292
I'll have nothing to do with it,
but I'll take good care of you as usual.

996
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:08,542
Yes, but there is a problem.

997
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:11,417
I have never fired a gun.

998
01:21:11,542 --> 01:21:13,792
- Never?
- No.

999
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:16,208
Not a problem. I'll help you.

1000
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:21,875
No, I know something better.
I'll shoot, and then give you the gun.

1001
01:21:22,083 --> 01:21:26,292
But you have to hold the gun
at the end, understand?

1002
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:29,958
In any case, Dragos,
that woman must disappear.

1003
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:35,417
She is harmful, dangerous,
demanding, and nosy. That's it.

1004
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:39,958
- When should it happen?
- We'll go exploring a few days earlier.

1005
01:21:40,167 --> 01:21:44,375
- So you'll be waiting at a good spot.
- But you will shoot?

1006
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:48,875
I shoot her, but it's
your responsibility.

1007
01:21:49,083 --> 01:21:52,667
Don't forget it's your job. Agreed?

1008
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:57,708
- And now you go to see your brother?
- I was going to go this week...

1009
01:21:57,875 --> 01:22:02,708
- ...but you called. I'll go next week.
- Say hello to him.

1010
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:10,667
- Did you forget anything?
- Where's Pierre and Delphine?

1011
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:12,542
We'll see them there.

1012
01:22:33,542 --> 01:22:36,167
I'm eager to go hunting tomorrow.

1013
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:39,250
Camille too, I think.
You're still hunting deer?

1014
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:42,542
I hope with more luck than last time.

1015
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:46,792
- I love game.
- The only thing we hunt for...

1016
01:22:46,958 --> 01:22:50,542
- ...is his antique stuff.
- Eat, eat!

1017
01:22:50,708 --> 01:22:54,250
- Enjoy your meal.
- This lobster is delicious.

1018
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,500
- Are you coming to the antique shops?
- I'm staying here to listen to music.

1019
01:22:59,667 --> 01:23:03,750
- I am looking for a table.
- There are many antique shops here.

1020
01:23:03,917 --> 01:23:06,750
I hope the hunt will be a success.

1021
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:09,708
It's about the search itself.

1022
01:23:09,875 --> 01:23:12,042
Yes, we enter a different universe.

1023
01:23:12,208 --> 01:23:15,917
It's all about tracking the animal,
you forget everything else.

1024
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:19,500
She inherited her love of nature from
her father, an excellent fisherman.

1025
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:22,250
I learned fly fishing as a little girl.

1026
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:25,542
- I didn't inherit any of this.
- Definitely not.

1027
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:28,333
- Will we see you at lunch?
- I don't think so.

1028
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,958
But we'll try getting
something for dinner.

1029
01:23:31,167 --> 01:23:36,167
- Make sure to spit out the pellets!
- You don't hunt deer with buckshot.

1030
01:23:36,333 --> 01:23:40,083
What time is it? Wait.
I have to take my pill.

1031
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:43,458
You see how careful I'm about it.
Have you seen them?

1032
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:44,958
Are they in your bag?

1033
01:23:45,167 --> 01:23:48,875
Oh no. I have left them in Paris.

1034
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:53,333
- It's a four-day weekend.
- Alright. In that case, I will...

1035
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:56,500
- I'm not going to die.
- But I have to go back to Paris.

1036
01:23:56,667 --> 01:24:01,625
- I can easily go without for four days.
- They're not that necessary.

1037
01:24:01,792 --> 01:24:05,625
- They are necessary. Edgar'll get them.
- He'll never find them.

1038
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,542
I will do it then. Where are they?

1039
01:24:07,708 --> 01:24:11,167
They're in my jacket. I'm so sorry.

1040
01:24:11,333 --> 01:24:16,625
- Don't worry. I'll go during the hunt.
- But you wanted to listen to music.

1041
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:21,417
Edgar is a very calm driver. I'll rest
and listen to music on the way.

1042
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:26,167
- Which jacket?
- The grey one. It may also be the bag.

1043
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:29,167
- She's going to find them.
- But wait, there are several bags.

1044
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:32,542
- Come along.
- Look carefully.

1045
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:34,083
Bye, darling.

1046
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,292
This one is for you.

1047
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:25,750
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1048
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:29,417
Come with me.

1049
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:46,792
We are going that way.

1050
01:25:59,375 --> 01:26:04,208
Camille, this way is better. I know
this forest like the back of my hand.

1051
01:26:17,375 --> 01:26:22,250
This forest inspires poets.
It is densely overgrown...

1052
01:26:22,417 --> 01:26:28,958
- ...gloomy, and with few deer.
- Don't worry, we'll soon see some action.

1053
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:33,292
I've been in the city for too long.
How do you manage to find your way?

1054
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:35,750
On my own I would be lost.

1055
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:09,708
I have something to do.
I'll be back in an hour.

1056
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:17,167
Let's be honest,
who would buy such a thing?

1057
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,917
People who appreciate
the art of hunting?

1058
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:22,375
For an old country house.

1059
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:24,708
Or for a jockey club, at most.

1060
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:12,792
Yes?

1061
01:29:16,417 --> 01:29:19,500
Fanny, the reception here is bad.

1062
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:25,583
Alain did not flee. You were right.
Something bad happened to him.

1063
01:29:26,083 --> 01:29:27,292
What are you saying?

1064
01:29:27,458 --> 01:29:29,125
I am at his place.

1065
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:32,958
I found your medication and
decided to go here, one last time.

1066
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:37,458
Your ideas haunted me,
and you were right.

1067
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:40,125
Whoever cleaned out the place...

1068
01:29:40,292 --> 01:29:44,500
...didn't know Alain's
secret spot for his manuscript.

1069
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:50,042
He would never leave without it.
It was the only copy.

1070
01:29:50,208 --> 01:29:51,917
His soul was in it.

1071
01:29:52,125 --> 01:29:54,333
This doesn't surprise me.

1072
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:58,208
Do you still think Jean is behind it?

1073
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:02,625
I can't prove anything.
But I think the police would.

1074
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:16,875
Put away the cigarette.

1075
01:30:21,667 --> 01:30:23,625
Give me your gun.

1076
01:30:29,375 --> 01:30:33,625
But Jean... I know him. He has his
flaws and obsessions, but this...

1077
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:38,042
Listen, I'll come back.
We need to talk.

1078
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,667
See you soon.

1079
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:58,542
Jean, no...

1080
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,917
Was that really a deer?

1081
01:31:06,125 --> 01:31:07,917
I think it was a man.

1082
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:10,792
Damn it. Are you sure?

1083
01:31:10,958 --> 01:31:14,958
- No, that was someone.
- Wasn't it a deer?

1084
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:17,167
A deer...

1085
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:19,583
What is it, damn it?

1086
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:21,750
Damn, damn...

1087
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:33,458
- We need to get help.
- That's not necessary. He is dead.

1088
01:31:33,583 --> 01:31:36,292
Good Lord, this can't be...

1089
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:38,708
It's horrible.

1090
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:42,083
I saw something moving
 among the trees.

1091
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,917
It was an accident.

1092
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,417
But, no... Oh my god.

1093
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:51,167
It's horrible.

1094
01:31:59,292 --> 01:32:03,667
<i>She drew the conclusion
that life was uncertain.</i>

1095
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:08,917
<i>The chance of your existence is
one in four hundred billion.</i>

1096
01:32:09,125 --> 01:32:11,542
<i>So every life is a miracle.</i>

1097
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:16,167
<i>Every living creature is a jackpot
in the cosmic lottery.</i>

1098
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:19,042
<i>Do not waste that miracle.</i>

1099
01:32:19,208 --> 01:32:23,583
<i>She felt ready to continue until the end
of her choices and her mistakes.</i>

1100
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:26,917
<i>It remained no less
terrifying to realise...</i>

1101
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,833
<i>...the immense role played
in all things by chance...</i>

1102
01:32:30,042 --> 01:32:32,500
<i>...and the importance of being lucky.</i>

1103
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:38,250
<i>It was better not to dwell on it.</i>
