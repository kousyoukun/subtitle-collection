00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:45,842
爸爸 回來我不想一個人呆著
{\fs12}Daddy, come back. I don't wanna be in here alone.

135
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:47,761
爸爸 求你了
{\fs12}Daddy, please!

136
00:12:11,712 --> 00:12:15,381
你害怕黑暗嗎
{\fs12}Are you scared of the dark?

137
00:12:15,383 --> 00:12:18,450
那是誰 是誰
{\fs12}Who is that? Who's there?

138
00:12:23,758 --> 00:12:25,624
不要害怕
{\fs12}Don't be afraid.

139
00:12:25,626 --> 00:12:27,995
我有光
{\fs12}I can make it light.

140
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,185
那是誰
{\fs12}Who is that?

141
00:12:53,187 --> 00:12:55,354
你為什麼在這裏
{\fs12}Why are you down here?

142
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,690
我爸爸把我關在這裏的
{\fs12}My daddy put me down here.

143
00:12:57,692 --> 00:13:01,225
你爸爸對你不太好
{\fs12}Your daddy doesn't treat you right.

144
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:03,228
把門打開
{\fs12}Open this door.

145
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,399
會有很多光的
{\fs12}There'll be lots of light.

146
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,200
繼續 打開
{\fs12}Go on. Open it.

147
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,970
鑰匙掛在那裏
{\fs12}There's a key hanging up right there.

148
00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:15,807
別著急 我可以等
{\fs12}Take your time. I can wait.

149
00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:19,046
你是唯一能把門打開的人
{\fs12}You're the only one that can open the door.

150
00:13:20,514 --> 00:13:23,114
你比表面更強大
{\fs12}You are more powerful than you know.

151
00:13:23,116 --> 00:13:26,820
我要你幫我打開所有的門
{\fs12}I want you to help me open all the doors.

152
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:46,397
別忘了海龜比爾剛剛做了什麼 大家
{\fs12}Don't forget what Bill the turtle just did, everyone,

153
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,734
因為我們可能要做同樣的事情
{\fs12}because we might have to do the same thing.

154
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,403
全都為此 朋友們
{\fs12}That's what this is all about, my friends.

155
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,607
防禦 掩護
{\fs12}Duck and cover.

156
00:14:54,609 --> 00:14:56,742
這是官方的民防電影
{\fs12}This is an official civil defense film

157
00:14:56,744 --> 00:14:59,277
根據聯邦民事法而合作製片的...
{\fs12}produced in cooperation with the Federal Civil...

158
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:07,322
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise?

159
00:15:28,308 --> 00:15:29,307
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise?

160
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,659
奧黛麗
{\fs12}Audrey?

161
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:49,764
奧黛麗
{\fs12}Audrey.

162
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:53,331
奧黛麗
{\fs12}Audrey!

163
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,901
不 奧黛麗
{\fs12}No, no, Audrey. Audrey, no.

164
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,773
不不不
{\fs12}No. No. No.

165
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,840
不 奧黛麗
{\fs12}No, Audrey!

166
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:04,511
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

167
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:06,845
不
{\fs12}No!

168
00:16:06,847 --> 00:16:08,814
不
{\fs12}No!

169
00:16:22,698 --> 00:16:25,602
2010年 加州

170
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:51,461
給我鑰匙

171
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,605
早上好
{\fs12}Good morning.

172
00:17:06,607 --> 00:17:08,942
夢就要回來了 沃倫
{\fs12}The dreams are coming back, Warren.

173
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,878
甩也甩不掉
{\fs12}Just won't go away, will it?

174
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,815
你想在床上吃早飯嗎
{\fs12}How would you like breakfast in bed?

175
00:17:16,817 --> 00:17:18,984
我覺得可以
{\fs12}I thought so.

176
00:17:18,986 --> 00:17:21,652
你變老了 小沃倫 我們都是
{\fs12}You're getting old, little Warren. We both are.

177
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:24,789
我一直在研究 教堂地下室上周的錄像
{\fs12}I've been studying last week's footage from the church basement

178
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,530
我們錯過了什麼 圖像之間有移動
{\fs12}and we missed something. There is movement in the frame.

179
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,863
看 就在那兒 - 這是一塊皮棉
{\fs12}Look, right there. - It's a piece of lint.

180
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,798
皮棉不能自行穿過房間
{\fs12}Lint doesn't walk across the room.

181
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,306
看 我整晚熬夜的原因
{\fs12}Behold. The reason I was up all night.

182
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,907
是燈
{\fs12}The lights.

183
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:45,878
沒錯 朋友們 音控可用
{\fs12}That's right, my friends. It's voice activated.

184
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,113
無需繼續在黑暗中
{\fs12}No more dealing with those pesky switches,

185
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:49,715
摸索那些該死的開關
{\fs12}having to find them in the dark,

186
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,549
不需抖抖索索的去按開關
{\fs12}straining fingers as you switch them.

187
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:53,853
這些開關之前真的很麻煩
{\fs12}Yeah, that was a real problem before, you know.

188
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,587
受夠了黑暗 我的朋友
{\fs12}Toil in the darkness of sarcasm, my friend.

189
00:17:56,589 --> 00:18:01,228
我喜歡在燈光下工作
{\fs12}I prefer to work in the lights.

190
00:18:05,298 --> 00:18:07,632
燈光
{\fs12}The lights?

191
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,671
燈光
{\fs12}Lights!

192
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:14,940
糟糕的聲學
{\fs12}Bad acoustics.

193
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:18,677
自然光更好 瞧
{\fs12}Natural light's better for the environment anyway. Voila.

194
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:21,514
我真的很喜歡 有小伙子在家裏
{\fs12}I truly love that you boys are staying here in the house

195
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,681
請不要再修其他的東西
{\fs12}But please don't try to fix anything else

196
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:25,485
並沒有壞
{\fs12}that isn't broken.

197
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:31,525
抓鬼隊
{\fs12}Spectral Sightings.

198
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:34,125
她在
{\fs12}Uh, yes, she is.

199
00:18:34,127 --> 00:18:36,027
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise!

200
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:38,796
我是伊莉絲 - 你好
{\fs12}This is Elise. - Hey there.

201
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,265
我叫泰德·加爾薩
{\fs12}My name is Ted Garza.

202
00:18:40,267 --> 00:18:42,033
很高興認識你 加爾薩先生
{\fs12}Nice to meet you, Mr. Garza.

203
00:18:42,035 --> 00:18:44,769
我有點問題
{\fs12}Yeah. I'm-I'm having some problems.

204
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,038
我家發生了些事
{\fs12}Things are happening in my house,

205
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,542
他們說 你懂
{\fs12}and they say that you know about this stuff.

206
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:51,710
我稍微懂一些
{\fs12}I know some things.

207
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:55,213
那你能不能幫我看一下
{\fs12}Yeah, well, I was wondering if you could take a look.

208
00:18:55,215 --> 00:18:59,751
我需要你的幫助
{\fs12}I need... I need help is the thing, see.

209
00:18:59,753 --> 00:19:01,653
請問你住在哪裏
{\fs12}May I ask where you live?

210
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:06,725
我住在蘋果樹路414號
{\fs12}I live at 414 Appletree Road

211
00:19:06,727 --> 00:19:09,527
新墨西哥州 五鑰
{\fs12}Five Keys, New Mexico.

212
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:21,573
加爾薩先生
{\fs12}Um. Mr. Garza, ahem,

213
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:24,910
希望我能幫到你 可惜不行
{\fs12}I wish I could help you, but I really can't.

214
00:19:24,912 --> 00:19:26,845
我很抱歉
{\fs12}I'm so sorry.

215
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,951
感謝你念著我
{\fs12}I thank you very much for thinking of me.

216
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:58,576
抱歉把你們倆從床上拽出來
{\fs12}Sorry to drag you boys out of bed.

217
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:01,982
今天打電話 提供工作的那個人
{\fs12}That man who called today about a job?

218
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:10,622
他告訴我 他住在我小時候的房子裏
{\fs12}He told me he lives in the house that I grew up in.

219
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:14,429
我稱它為房子 因為它不是一個家
{\fs12}I call it a house because it wasn't a... a home.

220
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:24,372
我沒有那個地方的記憶 我有傷疤
{\fs12}I don't have memories from that place. I have scars.

221
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:30,778
提醒你們 我的天賦
{\fs12}This gift I have that you boys are so in awe of,

222
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,314
我父親想把我的天賦驅趕掉
{\fs12}my father tried to beat it out of me.

223
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,418
然後
{\fs12}And...

224
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,452
我媽媽
{\fs12}my mother,

225
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:43,822
她在那所房子裏被殺了
{\fs12}she was killed in that house.

226
00:20:43,824 --> 00:20:48,460
殺掉她的 是我帶進這個世界的東西
{\fs12}She was murdered by something that I brought into this world.

227
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:51,896
惡魔想利用我的能力
{\fs12}This demon wants to use my abilities,

228
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,466
它會傷害我愛的人 來抓住我
{\fs12}and it will hurt the ones I love to get to me.

229
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:57,134
所以我從來不想進入遠境
{\fs12}That's why I never want to go into The Further

230
00:20:57,136 --> 00:20:59,403
就像我為奎恩做的那樣
{\fs12}like I did for Quinn.

231
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:03,174
我用生命來對抗這些東西
{\fs12}I have spent my life fighting these things

232
00:21:03,176 --> 00:21:04,876
因為我永遠都不會忘記
{\fs12}because I can never forget the look

233
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:07,147
我母親去世時的表情
{\fs12}on my mother's face when she died.

234
00:21:09,016 --> 00:21:10,615
所以
{\fs12}So...

235
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:14,390
我必須幫助這個人
{\fs12}I have to help this man

236
00:21:15,323 --> 00:21:18,728
因為我知道他在對付什麼
{\fs12}because I know what he's up against.

237
00:21:20,227 --> 00:21:22,126
我們今晚把皮卡收拾好
{\fs12}We'll pack up the truck tonight.

238
00:21:22,128 --> 00:21:23,828
明天一早動身
{\fs12}We'll get an early start tomorrow.

239
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,268
這次不行
{\fs12}Not this time.

240
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,336
這一次 我要...
{\fs12}This one, I have to do...

241
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:31,004
一個人
{\fs12}alone.

242
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,217
斯派克和塔克

243
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:19,785
我們得跟你走 這花了我們700塊錢
{\fs12}We have to come with you now. This cost us 700 bucks.

244
00:22:19,787 --> 00:22:22,824
油漆標誌 另外花了200
{\fs12}Plus 200 for the logo paint job.

245
00:22:30,666 --> 00:22:34,904
歡迎進入新墨西哥州

246
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,056
歡迎進去五鑰

247
00:24:03,323 --> 00:24:05,289
在我們進去之前
{\fs12}Before we go inside,

248
00:24:05,291 --> 00:24:07,727
我帶了些衣服給你們
{\fs12}I brought some clothes for you boys.

249
00:24:09,563 --> 00:24:13,401
有些是傑克的 對我來說很重要
{\fs12}Some of it belonged to Jack, and it's very important to me.

250
00:24:16,303 --> 00:24:18,536
我能猜到你是誰
{\fs12}I bet I can guess who you are.

251
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:20,971
沒必要 我是伊莉絲
{\fs12}There's no need. I'm Elise.

252
00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,507
你好 - 這是斯派克和塔克
{\fs12}Hi. - And this is Specs and Tucker,

253
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:24,709
我的夥伴
{\fs12}my associates.

254
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:26,710
她通靈
{\fs12}She's psychic.

255
00:24:26,712 --> 00:24:29,046
我們統領
{\fs12}We're sidekick.

256
00:24:29,048 --> 00:24:30,915
什麼
{\fs12}Where's that?

257
00:24:30,917 --> 00:24:34,151
她通靈 我們統領
{\fs12}She's psychic. We're sidekick.

258
00:24:35,556 --> 00:24:37,354
對不起 我沒搞懂
{\fs12}Sorry, I'm... I'm not understanding.

259
00:24:37,356 --> 00:24:39,059
算了
{\fs12}Yeah, never mind.

260
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,193
你想進來嗎 來吧
{\fs12}You wanna come in? Here.

261
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:45,529
來吧 我早就該請你進來了
{\fs12}Come on. I'm supposed to invite you in. Come on.

262
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:47,201
你好
{\fs12}Hello.

263
00:24:56,876 --> 00:25:01,513
朋友們 歷史總是驚人的相同
{\fs12}...and history always repeats, my friends.

264
00:25:01,515 --> 00:25:05,016
他們死去的過往 很快就是我們的現狀
{\fs12}The ghosts of their past will soon become our present

265
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:06,884
如果我們不面對他們...
{\fs12}if we do not confront them...

266
00:25:06,886 --> 00:25:09,020
你還留著我們很多的舊物
{\fs12}You still have so much of our old stuff.

267
00:25:09,022 --> 00:25:10,924
全都在這裏
{\fs12}It was all here.

268
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,559
很好的東西
{\fs12}Pretty good stuff, you know?

269
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,861
似乎沒理由丟掉
{\fs12}I didn't see any reason to get rid of it.

270
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:19,267
有故事的
{\fs12}There's stories.

271
00:25:20,532 --> 00:25:22,100
關於你的家庭
{\fs12}About your family.

272
00:25:22,102 --> 00:25:24,902
他們說 我不該坐在這裏
{\fs12}I never listened to them when they said that

273
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:27,404
但我從來沒把這句話當真
{\fs12}this wasn't a place that I should live.

274
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:30,574
我看著它 只是一所小房子
{\fs12}You know, I looked at it, and I just saw a little house.

275
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:34,682
我說"滾你的故事" 我買下了房子
{\fs12}I said, "Screw the stories," and I bought it.

276
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:41,786
現在 我相信這些故事了
{\fs12}Now I believe the stories.

277
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:48,759
你有什麼發現
{\fs12}You getting anything?

278
00:25:48,761 --> 00:25:50,763
房子裏有這麼多鬼魂
{\fs12}There are so many spirits in this house,

279
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,765
善的與惡的 很難區分
{\fs12}it's hard to tell the good from the evil.

280
00:25:52,767 --> 00:25:55,867
很多人死在那所監獄裏
{\fs12}A lot of people died in that prison.

281
00:25:55,869 --> 00:25:57,736
事件是幾時開始的
{\fs12}When did these occurrences start?

282
00:25:57,738 --> 00:26:00,141
我搬進來後不久
{\fs12}Soon after I moved in.

283
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:05,611
首先是
{\fs12}First, it was, uh,

284
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:08,145
小玩意
{\fs12}the little things, you know?

285
00:26:08,147 --> 00:26:09,449
那些...
{\fs12}Things that...

286
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,022
你被賜予了天賦
{\fs12}You've been blessed with a gift.

287
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:34,672
你很特別
{\fs12}You're special.

288
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:37,040
天知地知你知我知 好嗎
{\fs12}You just keep it between us from now on, okay?

289
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,149
不 不
{\fs12}No. No!

290
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:46,617
你沒事吧
{\fs12}You okay?

291
00:26:49,423 --> 00:26:52,123
我很好
{\fs12}Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

292
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,160
你的經歷
{\fs12}These experiences you're having...

293
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:56,963
主要發生在哪裏呢
{\fs12}Where do they mainly occur?

294
00:26:58,832 --> 00:27:01,135
大部分在一個房間裏
{\fs12}Mostly in one room.

295
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,701
這房間被我鎖起來了
{\fs12}I keep it locked now.

296
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:07,407
三個月沒有打開過
{\fs12}I haven't opened it in three months.

297
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,580
聖經

298
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:14,813
我來拿
{\fs12}I'll take that one.

299
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:16,717
幫我一把嗎
{\fs12}You wanna give me a hand?

300
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,753
很好
{\fs12}That's good.

301
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:23,923
再多一點
{\fs12}A little bit more.

302
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:53,418
對不起
{\fs12}Sorry.

303
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,085
不想進去
{\fs12}Can't go in there.

304
00:28:06,532 --> 00:28:09,433
剛開始時
{\fs12}When it first started,

305
00:28:09,435 --> 00:28:13,371
我聽到有人來回走動
{\fs12}I could hear somebody just walking back and forth.

306
00:28:13,373 --> 00:28:16,777
有人在自言自語
{\fs12}Someone was talking to themselves.

307
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,822
你覺得自己快要發瘋了 然後你
{\fs12}You think you're going crazy, and then you...

308
00:28:30,824 --> 00:28:33,127
你真的聽到了
{\fs12}you actually hear it.

309
00:28:35,596 --> 00:28:37,594
其實你知道你沒有聽到
{\fs12}And you know you're not.

310
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:40,832
終於有一天 我走了進去
{\fs12}Finally, one day, I walked in,

311
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:43,168
我對它尖叫著
{\fs12}and I screamed at it:

312
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:45,372
你停
{\fs12}"You stop.

313
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:49,276
你停
{\fs12}"You stop.

314
00:28:50,477 --> 00:28:51,745
請停
{\fs12}Please stop."

315
00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:56,480
我畢生的積蓄都花在這裏了
{\fs12}My whole life savings is in this place.

316
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,248
你們得幫我
{\fs12}You gotta help me.

317
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,117
你們得幫我 求你了
{\fs12}You gotta help me, please.

318
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,789
我們就是幹這行的
{\fs12}That's what we do.

319
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:07,991
通過攝像頭我們可以看到
{\fs12}The camera is so we can see

320
00:29:07,993 --> 00:29:10,163
她在皮卡裏看到的一切
{\fs12}what she sees from out in the truck.

321
00:29:11,464 --> 00:29:13,998
我們稱之為"溫尼巴之鬼"
{\fs12}We call it the "Winneba-ghost."

322
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:22,041
我現在得過去了
{\fs12}I think I'm gonna go there now.

323
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:35,621
你打算一個人待著嗎
{\fs12}You really are gonna stay here all alone?

324
00:29:35,623 --> 00:29:39,123
我的存在會吸引鬼魂....
{\fs12}My presence tends to draw the spirits out

325
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:41,228
離開它們黑暗的小角落
{\fs12}of their dark, little corners.

326
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:45,499
你得拿著
{\fs12}You need to take this.

327
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,002
謝謝
{\fs12}Thank you.

328
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:51,303
晚安
{\fs12}Good night.

329
00:30:13,026 --> 00:30:14,492
你能聽到我們嗎 伊莉絲
{\fs12}Can you hear us, Elise?

330
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:20,998
能 盡量不要其他的聲音
{\fs12}Yes. Try not to drown out the other voices.

331
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,069
那行 搞定
{\fs12}We got you, we're gone.

332
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,205
給你
{\fs12}Here you go.

333
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,442
這是什麼 - 燈
{\fs12}What's this? - Lights.

334
00:30:30,844 --> 00:30:32,413
謝謝
{\fs12}Thanks.

335
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:55,397
我以為永遠找不到你了
{\fs12}I thought you were gone forever.

336
00:31:56,796 --> 00:31:59,430
我媽媽給我弟弟的
{\fs12}My mother got this for my brother

337
00:31:59,432 --> 00:32:02,802
他6歲時 搞丟了的
{\fs12}and he lost it when he was 6 years old.

338
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:14,213
現在安全了
{\fs12}Safe now.

339
00:34:31,451 --> 00:34:32,950
停
{\fs12}Stop.

340
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:34,987
什麼 - 回到左邊去
{\fs12}What? - Go back, to the left.

341
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,324
什麼
{\fs12}What?

342
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,657
沒什麼
{\fs12}Yeah, nothing.

343
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,827
我似乎看到有腳
{\fs12}Thought I saw some feet.

344
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:44,064
什麼腳
{\fs12}Feet?

345
00:35:09,456 --> 00:35:12,526
伊莉絲 有人在你面前
{\fs12}Elise, there's someone right in front of you.

346
00:35:14,293 --> 00:35:16,193
像個女人
{\fs12}Looks like a woman.

347
00:35:16,195 --> 00:35:17,663
我什麼也沒看到
{\fs12}I don't see anything.

348
00:35:18,931 --> 00:35:22,633
伊莉絲 小心點
{\fs12}Elise, be careful.

349
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:29,710
我沒看到你看到的
{\fs12}I don't see what you're seeing.

350
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,248
你就快碰到它了
{\fs12}You're going to touch it.

351
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:37,550
小心
{\fs12}Be careful.

352
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:43,086
幫她
{\fs12}Help her.

353
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:50,696
伊莉絲 怎麼了
{\fs12}Elise? Elise? What happened?

354
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,697
哨子
{\fs12}The whistle.

355
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:55,900
它拿走了哨子
{\fs12}It took the whistle.

356
00:35:55,902 --> 00:35:58,403
你在裏面幹什麼
{\fs12}What were you doing in there?

357
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:01,238
你不是應該待在臥室裏嗎
{\fs12}Thought you were gonna stay in the bedroom.

358
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,240
有東西 把我引到了那裏
{\fs12}Something led me down there.

359
00:36:03,242 --> 00:36:05,309
女鬼
{\fs12}The spirit of a woman.

360
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:07,478
我不知道她為什麼說"幫她"
{\fs12}I don't know why she said, "Help her,"

361
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,813
但這個鬼
{\fs12}but it's a ghost I have seen before

362
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:11,784
我在房子裏見過
{\fs12}in this house,

363
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,487
當時我16歲
{\fs12}when I was 16 years old.

364
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,445
你聽到了嗎
{\fs12}Did you hear that?

365
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:41,780
聽到什麼
{\fs12}Hear what?

366
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:44,581
洗衣房裏有人
{\fs12}There's someone in the laundry room.

367
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:46,284
沒有啊
{\fs12}No, there isn't.

368
00:36:46,286 --> 00:36:48,452
我聽到了
{\fs12}I heard it.

369
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:49,954
我去看看
{\fs12}I'm gonna go look.

370
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:52,592
不 別去 伊莉絲
{\fs12}No. Don't, Elise.

371
00:36:58,764 --> 00:37:00,433
你好
{\fs12}Hello.

372
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,168
我和弟弟克裏斯丁 住在這裏
{\fs12}I live here with my brother, Christian.

373
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,670
你叫什麼名字
{\fs12}What's your name?

374
00:37:05,672 --> 00:37:06,903
閉嘴
{\fs12}Stop it.

375
00:37:06,905 --> 00:37:08,608
你在假裝
{\fs12}You're making it up.

376
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,409
出來看看我弟弟
{\fs12}Come out and see my brother.

377
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,244
他不相信你在這裏
{\fs12}He doesn't believe that you're here.

378
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:14,815
克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Christian!

379
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,287
你在做什麼 姑娘
{\fs12}What are you doing, girl?

380
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:25,858
有人在洗衣房裏
{\fs12}There's someone in the laundry.

381
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:37,604
這裏沒有人
{\fs12}There's no one in here.

382
00:37:41,173 --> 00:37:42,876
你又犯毛病了
{\fs12}You're doing it again.

383
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:47,144
你不能因此而懲罰我
{\fs12}You can't punish me for this.

384
00:37:47,146 --> 00:37:49,679
從來不是我的訴求
{\fs12}I never wanted it. I never asked for it.

385
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,282
噓
{\fs12}Sh.

386
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,655
如果你一輩子
{\fs12}If there's one thing

387
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:57,058
有那麼一件事 伊莉絲
{\fs12}you've been doing your whole life, Elise

388
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,856
全是因為它在訴求
{\fs12}it's ask for it.

389
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,675
我不會再讓你傷害我了
{\fs12}I won't let you hurt me anymore.

390
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:19,381
拜託
{\fs12}Please!

391
00:38:19,646 --> 00:38:21,381
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise.

392
00:38:22,681 --> 00:38:23,685
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise!

393
00:38:27,487 --> 00:38:29,189
伊莉絲 別走
{\fs12}Elise, don't go!

394
00:38:31,324 --> 00:38:34,329
隨她去
{\fs12}Leave her be. Leave her be.

395
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,295
她必須知道
{\fs12}She needs to learn that nobody else

396
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:39,833
沒人會像她這樣愛她
{\fs12}can possibly love someone like her.

397
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:51,445
從那以後 我就沒回來過了
{\fs12}I haven't been back here since.

398
00:38:58,184 --> 00:39:00,918
今晚就這樣吧
{\fs12}I think that's all for tonight.

399
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,889
我們明天繼續
{\fs12}We'll pick it up tomorrow.

400
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,461
克裏斯丁和我 小時候經常來此
{\fs12}Christian and I came here a lot as kids.

401
00:39:10,463 --> 00:39:12,762
我看起來還好嗎
{\fs12}Do I look okay?

402
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,768
挺好
{\fs12}Yeah, of course.

403
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,445
好了
{\fs12}All right.

404
00:39:35,722 --> 00:39:38,389
對不起 我
{\fs12}Oh. I'm sorry. I...

405
00:39:38,391 --> 00:39:41,090
你的臉很熟
{\fs12}You just look so much like someone I know very well.

406
00:39:41,092 --> 00:39:42,731
真的麼
{\fs12}Oh, really?

407
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,829
我是伊莉絲
{\fs12}I'm Elise.

408
00:39:44,831 --> 00:39:46,063
梅麗莎
{\fs12}Melissa.

409
00:39:46,065 --> 00:39:47,465
伊莫金
{\fs12}Imogen.

410
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:48,932
你們是姐妹嗎
{\fs12}And you're sisters?

411
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:50,467
是的
{\fs12}Yes, we are.

412
00:39:50,469 --> 00:39:52,135
塔克
{\fs12}Tucker.

413
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:53,375
斯派克
{\fs12}Specs.

414
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,407
我是斯派克 也叫史蒂文
{\fs12}I'm Specs. Or Steven.

415
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,807
隨便哪個都行
{\fs12}Whatever. Your choice.

416
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:00,177
她通靈 我們統領
{\fs12}She's psychic, and we're sidekick.

417
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:01,981
不好意思
{\fs12}I'm sorry?

418
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:04,748
算了
{\fs12}Forget it.

419
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,684
你們是來參觀的嗎
{\fs12}So are you guys visiting the area?

420
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:10,755
有口難開 實際上是保密的
{\fs12}Tough to talk about. Actually, it's pretty confidential.

421
00:40:10,757 --> 00:40:13,791
惡作劇 有關泰德·加爾薩的
{\fs12}It's a poltergeist infestation involving Ted Garza.

422
00:40:13,793 --> 00:40:16,425
你認識他嗎 他住在那邊往下還是...
{\fs12}Do you know him? He lives, like, down the road or...?

423
00:40:16,427 --> 00:40:19,061
鬼魂和食屍鬼
{\fs12}Ghosts and ghouls.

424
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:21,398
他想表達的是 我們是幽靈獵人
{\fs12}What he's trying to say is we're ghost hunters.

425
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,969
我們三個 - 類似警察
{\fs12}The three of us. - Kind of like cops.

426
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:27,170
但我們不逮捕人類
{\fs12}Only we don't arrest humans.

427
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:30,508
大多數時間 我很搞笑
{\fs12}I'm funny too. A lot of the time.

428
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,443
我也可以...怎麼了 - 行了啦
{\fs12}I can also be funny... What? - Okay. Okay.

429
00:40:33,445 --> 00:40:35,479
夠了 孩子們
{\fs12}I think that that's enough, boys.

430
00:40:35,481 --> 00:40:36,981
是麼
{\fs12}Oh, yeah?

431
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:40,351
我很久以前住過這裏
{\fs12}I used to live in this town a long time ago.

432
00:40:40,353 --> 00:40:42,787
算你走運 你離開了
{\fs12}Well, good for you. You got out.

433
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:46,791
我是自欺欺人 我們在...
{\fs12}Um. I'm really making a fool out of myself. We're making...

434
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:48,458
你可沒有
{\fs12}No, you're not.

435
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,327
很高興認識你
{\fs12}It's really nice to meet you.

436
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,963
厄尼 情況怎麼樣
{\fs12}Ernie, how's it hanging?

437
00:40:52,965 --> 00:40:54,469
爸爸 這邊
{\fs12}Dad, over here.

438
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,769
你好嗎 - 夠熱嗎
{\fs12}How are you? - Hot enough for you?

439
00:41:07,646 --> 00:41:09,015
你好 克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Hello, Christian.

440
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:12,619
我老嗎
{\fs12}Have I aged that much?

441
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:19,222
你不打算說點什麼嗎
{\fs12}Well, aren't you gonna say anything?

442
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:20,958
對你 我沒什麼好說的
{\fs12}I have nothing to say to you.

443
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,392
姑娘們 快點 我們走
{\fs12}Girls, come on. Let's go.

444
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:24,061
快點 - 我們才剛到這裏
{\fs12}Come on. - We just got here.

445
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:25,166
聽我說完
{\fs12}Hear me out.

446
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:29,032
我 我還是你姐姐...
{\fs12}I'm... I'm still your sister, and...

447
00:41:29,034 --> 00:41:31,336
這個意思是
{\fs12}That only means something if I choose it to

448
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,336
由我說了算
{\fs12}mean something, and I choose it not to.

449
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:34,871
求你了 克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Please, Christian.

450
00:41:34,873 --> 00:41:36,507
請聽我說完
{\fs12}I just want you to hear my piece.

451
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:38,242
我那時並不知道事態會如何發展
{\fs12}I didn't know how this was gonna go.

452
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:40,010
我以為你能看到未來
{\fs12}I thought you could see the future.

453
00:41:40,012 --> 00:41:42,479
真是你姐姐嗎 - 不是 走吧
{\fs12}Is this really your sister? - No, it isn't! Come on.

454
00:41:42,481 --> 00:41:43,981
我是他的姐姐
{\fs12}Yes, yes, I am his sister.

455
00:41:43,983 --> 00:41:45,516
聽我說 你聽著
{\fs12}Listen to me. You listen.

456
00:41:45,518 --> 00:41:49,753
我們小時候 你嚇壞我了
{\fs12}Now, when we were children, you terrified me.

457
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:52,590
你把我嚇得要死
{\fs12}You scared the life out of me

458
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:55,592
用紅門背後怪物的故事
{\fs12}with stories about a monster behind a red door,

459
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:58,695
然後你開門走人
{\fs12}and then you opened the door, and you left.

460
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:00,430
你扔下了我
{\fs12}You left me.

461
00:42:00,432 --> 00:42:03,867
把我拋給真正的怪物 我們的父親
{\fs12}You abandoned me to a real monster, our father.

462
00:42:03,869 --> 00:42:08,643
希望你安好 但請你離我們遠一點 伊莉絲
{\fs12}Look, I wish you no harm, but you stay away from us, Elise.

463
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:11,177
你離我遠一點
{\fs12}You stay away.

464
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:13,847
克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Christian.

465
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,586
克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Christian!

466
00:42:22,588 --> 00:42:24,658
克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Christian!

467
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,465
我真是笨 居然回來
{\fs12}I was stupid to come back here.

468
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:36,633
你不笨 你在幫助別人
{\fs12}No, you weren't. You're helping people.

469
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:38,635
你一直這麼做 記得嗎
{\fs12}That's what you do, remember?

470
00:42:38,637 --> 00:42:40,537
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise.

471
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:42,440
對不起
{\fs12}I'm sorry.

472
00:42:42,442 --> 00:42:45,208
他有時會不講理
{\fs12}He can be unreasonable sometimes.

473
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,912
瞭解他的成長 你就會懂的
{\fs12}Knowing what he grew up with, that's perfectly understandable.

474
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:51,447
他從來沒有提起童年
{\fs12}He's never told us anything about his childhood.

475
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:53,617
我連照片都沒看到過
{\fs12}I've never even seen a picture.

476
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:57,454
他也從來沒有跟我們提到過你
{\fs12}He never told us anything about you.

477
00:42:57,456 --> 00:43:00,795
我留下他一個人 我不該這麼做的
{\fs12}I left him alone, and I shouldn't have.

478
00:43:02,094 --> 00:43:04,666
他是個好爸爸
{\fs12}He is a great dad, you know?

479
00:43:05,097 --> 00:43:06,963
我很愛他
{\fs12}I love him a lot.

480
00:43:06,965 --> 00:43:10,135
你不知道這讓我有多幸福 親愛的
{\fs12}You have no idea how happy that makes me, honey.

481
00:43:14,533 --> 00:43:16,606
塔克 - 與我分享 好嗎
{\fs12}Tucker? - ...share with me. Yes?

482
00:43:16,608 --> 00:43:19,110
你有沒有打印出來的靜止圖像
{\fs12}Do you have the still frames that we printed?

483
00:43:19,112 --> 00:43:20,844
有啊 - 拿過來
{\fs12}Yes, I do. - Bring them here.

484
00:43:20,846 --> 00:43:22,479
被雌性吃掉 所以...
{\fs12}Eaten by the female, that's why...

485
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:23,680
塔克
{\fs12}Tucker?

486
00:43:23,682 --> 00:43:25,682
塔克 我需要你
{\fs12}Tucker, I need you.

487
00:43:25,684 --> 00:43:27,786
是的嘛 - 快過來
{\fs12}Yes. - Come on.

488
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,094
給你
{\fs12}Here you go.

489
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:39,863
給 你給你爸爸
{\fs12}Here. You give this to your dad,

490
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:41,798
告訴他 這是昨天拍的
{\fs12}and you tell him it was taken yesterday

491
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,867
拍的是我們的舊臥室
{\fs12}in our old bedroom.

492
00:43:43,869 --> 00:43:47,039
他會很驚訝的
{\fs12}Oh, I think he will be very surprised to see it.

493
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:51,510
很高興見到你
{\fs12}I'm so happy to meet you.

494
00:43:55,813 --> 00:43:57,282
OK
{\fs12}Okay.

495
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,159
測試 一 二
{\fs12}Testing. One, two.

496
00:44:09,161 --> 00:44:13,030
能聽見我嗎 夥計們 能嗎
{\fs12}Can you hear me, guys? No.

497
00:44:13,032 --> 00:44:18,034
昨晚我倒是注意到了 但我不能裝好設備
{\fs12}I noticed this last night, but I couldn't quite place it.

498
00:44:18,036 --> 00:44:21,737
然後 克裏斯丁提醒我 我小時候
{\fs12}Then Christian reminded me that when I was a child

499
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,407
我看見一扇紅色的門
{\fs12}I saw a red door.

500
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:28,080
殺死我母親的那個東西 穿過了這道門
{\fs12}The entity that killed my mother came through it.

501
00:44:30,148 --> 00:44:34,083
我不明白 紅門就是紅門 任何人都可以看到
{\fs12}I don't get it. A red door is a red door. Anyone can see it.

502
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,720
不是字面上的門 而是超自然門
{\fs12}No, it's not a literal door. It's a metaphysical one.

503
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:38,921
記得當我進入遠境時
{\fs12}Remember when I went into The Further

504
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:40,257
去找奎恩·布倫納嗎
{\fs12}to find Quinn Brenner?

505
00:44:40,259 --> 00:44:43,327
我遇到一扇紅門
{\fs12}I came across a red door.

506
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:46,195
我 穿了過去
{\fs12}And I... I passed through it,

507
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:49,333
這讓我更深入到遠境
{\fs12}and it took me deeper into The Further.

508
00:44:49,335 --> 00:44:51,905
我能找出其含義就好了
{\fs12}If I can find out what it means,

509
00:44:53,539 --> 00:44:55,639
我也許能阻止那玩意
{\fs12}I might be able to stop the thing

510
00:44:55,641 --> 00:44:57,874
在房子裏鬧鬼
{\fs12}that's haunting this house.

511
00:44:57,876 --> 00:45:00,246
或許有用
{\fs12}Well, this might help.

512
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:10,322
我昨晚和你談過了
{\fs12}I spoke to you last night.

513
00:45:12,791 --> 00:45:15,862
你在嗎 能聽見我嗎
{\fs12}Are you there? Can you hear me?

514
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:25,068
你奪走了我的東西
{\fs12}You took something from me.

515
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,808
為什麼
{\fs12}Why?

516
00:45:28,273 --> 00:45:30,074
你為什麼說 "幫她"
{\fs12}Why did you say, "Help her"?

517
00:45:30,076 --> 00:45:31,275
幫誰
{\fs12}Help who?

518
00:46:08,847 --> 00:46:10,382
這邊
{\fs12}This way.

519
00:48:07,231 --> 00:48:09,001
是你嗎
{\fs12}Is that you?

520
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:14,737
一聲哨代表"是" 兩聲代表"不"
{\fs12}Whistle once for yes, twice for no.

521
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:18,141
你是我昨晚看到的那個女人嗎
{\fs12}Are you the woman I saw last night?

522
00:48:23,014 --> 00:48:25,983
這房子裏有實體嗎
{\fs12}Is there an entity in this house

523
00:48:25,985 --> 00:48:29,353
就是想傷害泰德·加爾薩的東西
{\fs12}that is trying to hurt Ted Garza?

524
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:35,758
你是那個實體嗎
{\fs12}Are you that entity?

525
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:45,403
有東西想給我看嗎
{\fs12}Is there something you're trying to show me?

526
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:52,675
你想給我看的
{\fs12}Is what you want to show me

527
00:48:52,677 --> 00:48:55,345
是否在牆後面
{\fs12}behind this wall?

528
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:38,091
鑰匙
{\fs12}Keys.

529
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,872
別動 夥計 別動
{\fs12}Freeze, buddy. Freeze.

530
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:53,570
繼續
{\fs12}On.

531
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:55,074
等等 繼續
{\fs12}Wait. On.

532
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,903
等等
{\fs12}Wait.

533
00:51:05,744 --> 00:51:07,480
謝謝
{\fs12}Thank you.

534
00:51:39,577 --> 00:51:41,880
你想給我看什麼
{\fs12}What is it you wanna show me?

535
00:52:24,155 --> 00:52:26,958
救她
{\fs12}Help her!

536
00:52:48,213 --> 00:52:50,479
幫幫我
{\fs12}Help me.

537
00:52:56,487 --> 00:52:58,588
那不是鬼魂
{\fs12}That's not a ghost.

538
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,923
上帝
{\fs12}Oh, my God.

539
00:53:03,394 --> 00:53:05,662
上帝
{\fs12}Oh, my God.

540
00:53:05,664 --> 00:53:07,331
我會打破鎖鏈
{\fs12}I'll break the chain.

541
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,264
你別想
{\fs12}No, you won't.

542
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,735
閃開
{\fs12}Move.

543
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:15,771
離她遠點
{\fs12}Get away from her!

544
00:53:15,773 --> 00:53:18,941
我求你 幫我把鬼魂趕走
{\fs12}I asked you, help me get rid of the ghost.

545
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:20,911
幫我驅鬼
{\fs12}Help me get rid of it!

546
00:53:20,913 --> 00:53:22,681
幫幫我
{\fs12}Help me!

547
00:53:23,983 --> 00:53:27,316
你為什麼要下來
{\fs12}Why did you have to come down here?

548
00:53:29,588 --> 00:53:32,988
為什麼 - 你的鬼魂引我們下來的
{\fs12}Why? - Your ghost led us down here.

549
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,960
他在我腦子裏
{\fs12}He's in my head.

550
00:53:37,262 --> 00:53:39,531
他在我腦子裏
{\fs12}He's in my head.

551
00:53:57,315 --> 00:53:59,351
你朋友嗎
{\fs12}Is that your friend?

552
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:02,821
是你朋友
{\fs12}That is your friend.

553
00:54:53,371 --> 00:54:55,141
你在嗎 斯派克
{\fs12}You there, Specs?

554
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:05,048
斯派克
{\fs12}Specs!

555
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:12,258
怎麼回事
{\fs12}What?

556
00:55:48,025 --> 00:55:49,794
他媽的
{\fs12}Fuck.

557
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,927
她叫瑪拉·詹寧斯
{\fs12}Her name is Mara Jennings.

558
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:26,929
她是離這裏10英里外的一個鎮上的護士
{\fs12}Uh, she's a nurse from a town about 10 miles outside of here.

559
00:56:26,931 --> 00:56:29,499
她失蹤大約四個月了
{\fs12}She's been missing for approximately four months.

560
00:56:31,603 --> 00:56:33,172
小心腳下
{\fs12}Watch your step down.

561
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:37,773
你能在這呆幾天嗎
{\fs12}Can you stick around for a few days?

562
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:39,909
是的
{\fs12}Yeah, we'll be here.

563
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:42,615
我要你們所有人的證詞
{\fs12}I'm gonna have to get statements from all of you.

564
00:56:52,224 --> 00:56:55,829
這世界上 活躍著有很多惡魔
{\fs12}There are plenty of demons in this world

565
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,165
你阻止了他們中的一個
{\fs12}who are very much alive, and you stopped one of them.

566
00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:04,202
謝謝 伊莉絲
{\fs12}Thanks, Elise.

567
00:57:46,478 --> 00:57:48,378
爸爸 這太瘋狂了
{\fs12}Dad, this is crazy.

568
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,282
我必須這麼做
{\fs12}This is something I have to do.

569
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,023
我得找到它
{\fs12}I gotta find it.

570
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:04,961
一個小哨子 銀哨子
{\fs12}It's a little whistle, a little silver whistle.

571
00:58:04,963 --> 00:58:08,898
我和鬼世界打交道
{\fs12}Look, I deal in the spirit world,

572
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,003
鬼魂可以讓人們在現實世界中做壞事
{\fs12}and spirits can make people do bad things in the real world.

573
00:58:14,005 --> 00:58:18,007
很多人找我幫忙
{\fs12}Some of these people come to me for help.

574
00:58:18,009 --> 00:58:20,476
對你來說 是怪事
{\fs12}But to you, that's weird.

575
00:58:20,478 --> 00:58:23,317
對我而言 只不過又一天的例行工作
{\fs12}To me, it's a day job.

576
00:58:26,684 --> 00:58:28,621
不過這次不一樣
{\fs12}This one was different, though.

577
00:58:30,389 --> 00:58:33,289
鬧鬼的房子是我的房子
{\fs12}The haunted house was my house.

578
00:58:36,027 --> 00:58:37,894
不在這裏
{\fs12}It's not in here.

579
00:58:37,896 --> 00:58:40,197
我去看看他
{\fs12}Hey, I'm gonna check on him.

580
00:58:42,099 --> 00:58:44,534
為什麼加爾薩請你來
{\fs12}Why would Garza invite you up,

581
00:58:44,536 --> 00:58:47,269
難道不知道你可能發現瑪拉的風險嗎
{\fs12}knowing the risk that you might discover Mara?

582
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:57,950
這些鬼魂很可怕
{\fs12}These hauntings can be terrifying things.

583
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:02,351
也許對來世的恐懼...
{\fs12}Maybe the fear of the beyond...

584
00:59:02,353 --> 00:59:05,021
克服了被抓住的恐懼
{\fs12}overcame the fear of getting caught.

585
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,126
也許他就是想被抓
{\fs12}Or maybe he wanted to get caught.

586
00:59:12,063 --> 00:59:14,332
幹嘛 怎麼了
{\fs12}What? What is it?

587
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,367
我很抱歉
{\fs12}I-I'm sorry.

588
00:59:17,369 --> 00:59:20,269
我看到異象
{\fs12}I'm, uh, seeing things.

589
00:59:20,271 --> 00:59:22,938
非常震撼的異象
{\fs12}The shock of the whole thing, I suppose.

590
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:25,141
你還需要我做什麼嗎
{\fs12}Do you need me for anything else?

591
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:26,642
沒有了
{\fs12}No.

592
00:59:26,644 --> 00:59:28,213
謝謝
{\fs12}Thank you.

593
00:59:37,121 --> 00:59:38,956
梅麗莎
{\fs12}Melissa?

594
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:41,825
爸爸
{\fs12}Dad?

595
00:59:41,827 --> 00:59:45,030
下面這裏 親愛的 我找到哨子了
{\fs12}Down here, honey. I found the whistle.

596
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:09,521
爸爸
{\fs12}Dad?

597
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:34,333
噓
{\fs12}Shh.

598
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:39,769
你在做什麼 - 你找不到她 是嗎
{\fs12}What are you doing? - You can't find her, can you?

599
01:02:39,771 --> 01:02:42,539
她怎麼了 她在哪
{\fs12}What happened to her? Where is she?

600
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:44,874
我們到處找過了 - 哪裏都沒有
{\fs12}We've looked everywhere. - Not everywhere.

601
01:03:02,027 --> 01:03:03,996
天啊 不
{\fs12}Oh, God, no.

602
01:03:07,465 --> 01:03:09,865
伊莫金 叫輛救護車
{\fs12}Imogen, call an ambulance.

603
01:03:09,867 --> 01:03:11,536
現在
{\fs12}Now!

604
01:03:26,184 --> 01:03:28,720
你怎麼知道她在哪的
{\fs12}How did you know where she was?

605
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:31,787
她怎麼了
{\fs12}What happened to her?

606
01:03:31,789 --> 01:03:35,157
那房子裏有邪惡
{\fs12}There's something evil in that house...

607
01:03:35,159 --> 01:03:37,159
是我讓它進入這個世界的
{\fs12}and I let it into this world.

608
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:39,561
我覺得 就是它驅使泰德·加爾薩的
{\fs12}I think it made Ted Garza do what he did,

609
01:03:39,563 --> 01:03:41,697
現在它奪走了你妹妹的靈魂
{\fs12}and now it has taken your sister's spirit,

610
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:44,702
我會找到它的 今晚結束這一切
{\fs12}and I'm gonna find it, and I'm gonna finish it tonight.

611
01:03:47,204 --> 01:03:48,773
我也能看見異象
{\fs12}I can see things too.

612
01:04:00,585 --> 01:04:02,356
當我小姑娘時
{\fs12}When I was a little girl...

613
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:06,688
我睡著了 從臥室裏飄了出來
{\fs12}I went to sleep and floated out of my bedroom,

614
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,358
直接到我們的老鄰居家
{\fs12}all the way to our elderly neighbor's house.

615
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:11,526
她告訴我 她要離開這個世界
{\fs12}Then she told me she was leaving this world

616
01:04:11,528 --> 01:04:13,561
去下一世界
{\fs12}and going on to the next.

617
01:04:13,563 --> 01:04:17,199
我爸爸告訴我 她前一天晚上死了
{\fs12}My dad told me she had died the night before.

618
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:19,673
我告訴他 我已經知道了
{\fs12}I told him I already knew.

619
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:22,371
他聽到這個消息 很不開心
{\fs12}He wasn't too happy to hear that.

620
01:04:22,373 --> 01:04:24,211
伊莫金 走吧
{\fs12}Imogen, let's go.

621
01:04:24,608 --> 01:04:26,008
來吧 親愛的
{\fs12}Come on, honey.

622
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,148
不 我 我留下來
{\fs12}No, I... I'm staying.

623
01:04:28,913 --> 01:04:31,451
相信我好嗎
{\fs12}Just trust me, okay?

624
01:04:34,251 --> 01:04:36,519
來吧 孩子們 繼續工作
{\fs12}Come on, boys, let's get our things

625
01:04:36,521 --> 01:04:38,354
進屋開始
{\fs12}and get in the house and get started.

626
01:04:40,224 --> 01:04:41,626
孫子
{\fs12}Son of a...

627
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:45,929
我去吸引注意
{\fs12}I am going to get the attention

628
01:04:45,931 --> 01:04:48,097
吸引房子裏所有的鬼魂
{\fs12}of all the spirits in this house.

629
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:50,333
我需要一些對加爾薩很重要的東西
{\fs12}I need things that were important to Garza.

630
01:04:50,335 --> 01:04:52,501
斯派克 上樓去
{\fs12}Specs, go upstairs.

631
01:04:52,503 --> 01:04:55,137
有一本聖經 對他很珍貴
{\fs12}There is a Bible he held very dear to him.

632
01:04:55,139 --> 01:04:59,275
紅色的英皇欽定本 你去找到它
{\fs12}It was a red King James version, and I need you to find it.

633
01:04:59,277 --> 01:05:01,077
帶伊莫金一起去 - 好的
{\fs12}Take Imogen with you. - Okay.

634
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:02,912
不要讓她離開你的視線
{\fs12}And do not let her out of your sight.

635
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:05,113
我不會的 - 塔克和我去下面
{\fs12}I won't. - Tucker and I are going down

636
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:06,483
去隱蔽所
{\fs12}to the fallout shelter.

637
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,617
我去死亡地下室 他卻去搞聖經
{\fs12}I get the death chamber, he gets Bible camp

638
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,485
和一個大美女
{\fs12}with the most beautiful girl on Earth?

639
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:13,693
那不民主 - 去地下室 我只相信你
{\fs12}That's not a democracy. - You're the only one I trust to go down there with me.

640
01:05:15,226 --> 01:05:17,726
別高我一等 女人
{\fs12}Don't patronize me, woman.

641
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:20,464
你們為什麼穿成這樣
{\fs12}So why do you guys dress like that?

642
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:26,501
伊莉絲的主意 她給我們的衣服
{\fs12}It was Elise's idea. She dressed us.

643
01:05:26,503 --> 01:05:31,407
我平時的風格還是很悠閒的
{\fs12}No, my usual style's a lot more laid back.

644
01:05:31,409 --> 01:05:33,108
有點...
{\fs12}It's a little...

645
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:35,445
怎麼了
{\fs12}What?

646
01:05:35,447 --> 01:05:36,249
夥計
{\fs12}Dude.

647
01:05:36,274 --> 01:05:38,085
來世之旅

648
01:05:39,418 --> 01:05:41,684
舊版的 這值很多錢
{\fs12}This is vintage. No, this is worth a lot.

649
01:05:41,686 --> 01:05:44,619
我很嚴肅 我們得找到這東西
{\fs12}I'm serious. We gotta find this thing.

650
01:05:44,621 --> 01:05:46,121
我說說而已
{\fs12}I'm just saying.

651
01:05:46,123 --> 01:05:48,057
必須有愛好 - 我是說
{\fs12}Gotta have hobbies. - I'm saying.

652
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:49,525
不能整天圍著工作轉
{\fs12}Can't all be work.

653
01:05:49,527 --> 01:05:52,096
要好好享受 出去約會
{\fs12}Gotta enjoy yourself, go out on a date.

654
01:05:54,865 --> 01:05:56,803
做些快樂的事
{\fs12}You gotta do stuff like that.

655
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,039
這裏有些東西
{\fs12}There's something here.

656
01:06:00,237 --> 01:06:02,373
我能感覺到
{\fs12}I can feel it.

657
01:06:05,744 --> 01:06:07,842
她想讓我擁有它
{\fs12}She wants me to have it.

658
01:06:10,481 --> 01:06:11,981
估計可行
{\fs12}Oh, that should do it.

659
01:06:11,983 --> 01:06:13,887
讓開 - 是 先生
{\fs12}Step aside. - Yes, sir.

660
01:06:58,429 --> 01:07:00,397
該睡覺了
{\fs12}It's time to sleep.

661
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,848
我記得這件內衣
{\fs12}I know this slip.

662
01:07:15,547 --> 01:07:18,246
這會幫助你入睡 - 別再讓我喝酒了
{\fs12}This will help you sleep. - Don't make me drink anymore.

663
01:07:18,248 --> 01:07:20,016
求你了 讓我走吧
{\fs12}Please, let me go. I beg you.

664
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:22,653
給你
{\fs12}There you go.

665
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,555
求你了 讓我走吧
{\fs12}Please, let me go.

666
01:07:26,557 --> 01:07:29,291
我保證不會說出去的
{\fs12}I promise I won't tell.

667
01:07:29,293 --> 01:07:31,429
請讓我...
{\fs12}Please, let me...

668
01:08:03,762 --> 01:08:05,260
你聽到了嗎
{\fs12}Did you hear that?

669
01:08:05,262 --> 01:08:07,065
聽到什麼
{\fs12}Hear what?

670
01:08:11,534 --> 01:08:13,769
我弟弟不相信你在這裏
{\fs12}My brother doesn't believe that you're here.

671
01:08:13,771 --> 01:08:15,073
克裏斯丁
{\fs12}Christian!

672
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:19,444
有人在洗衣房裏
{\fs12}There's someone in the laundry.

673
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:32,993
這裏沒有人
{\fs12}There's no one here.

674
01:08:33,591 --> 01:08:36,791
你不能因此懲罰我 又不是我的訴求
{\fs12}You can't punish me for this. I never wanted it.

675
01:08:55,412 --> 01:08:56,678
再見 安娜
{\fs12}Goodbye, Anna.

676
01:09:05,355 --> 01:09:07,425
她沒死
{\fs12}She wasn't dead.

677
01:09:10,194 --> 01:09:14,263
我父親做了和加爾薩一模一樣的事
{\fs12}My father did the exact same thing that Garza did.

678
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:18,099
我很久之前看到的這個女人...
{\fs12}The woman I saw in this house all those years ago...

679
01:09:18,101 --> 01:09:20,171
她當時還活著
{\fs12}she was alive.

680
01:09:23,841 --> 01:09:25,877
我本可以幫她的
{\fs12}I could have helped her.

681
01:09:27,811 --> 01:09:29,844
我任由他殺了她
{\fs12}I let him kill her.

682
01:10:00,000 --> 01:14:00,000

683
01:10:33,077 --> 01:10:35,146
弄掉這東西
{\fs12}Take this thing off.

684
01:10:36,212 --> 01:10:37,481
好的
{\fs12}Okay.

685
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,076
她的死 是我的錯
{\fs12}Her death was my fault.

686
01:11:06,944 --> 01:11:10,845
她被困在黑暗中
{\fs12}Until I free her from wherever he put her...

687
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,051
直到我解救了她
{\fs12}she's trapped in the dark.

688
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,054
失蹤
{\fs12}Lost.

689
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:18,256
我要進去了
{\fs12}I'm going in there.

690
01:11:19,323 --> 01:11:20,825
退後
{\fs12}Stand back.

691
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:27,700
去吧
{\fs12}Go for it.

692
01:11:28,533 --> 01:11:30,068
我行的
{\fs12}I'm good.

693
01:12:21,618 --> 01:12:23,587
對不起 安娜
{\fs12}I'm sorry, Anna.

694
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:28,389
我辜負了你
{\fs12}I failed you.

695
01:13:15,838 --> 01:13:18,507
上帝
{\fs12}Oh, my God.

696
01:13:24,247 --> 01:13:25,647
等等
{\fs12}Wait, wait, wait, wa...

697
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:27,348
你要去哪
{\fs12}Where you going?

698
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:28,619
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise.

699
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:31,155
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise.

700
01:13:51,641 --> 01:13:53,278
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise.

701
01:13:56,113 --> 01:13:58,882
你不是唯一的 安娜
{\fs12}You weren't the only one, Anna.

702
01:15:23,132 --> 01:15:25,670
奧黛麗 - 伊莉絲
{\fs12}Audrey! - Elise?

703
01:15:27,404 --> 01:15:28,972
奧黛麗
{\fs12}Audrey.

704
01:15:30,875 --> 01:15:32,240
奧黛麗
{\fs12}Audrey.

705
01:15:32,242 --> 01:15:34,543
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise.

706
01:15:34,545 --> 01:15:36,482
我在哪裏
{\fs12}Where am I?

707
01:15:36,847 --> 01:15:38,885
你在一個特別的地方
{\fs12}You're in a special place...

708
01:15:40,117 --> 01:15:42,117
鬼魂呆的地方
{\fs12}where the spirits go.

709
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:43,887
你是誰
{\fs12}Who are you?

710
01:15:46,122 --> 01:15:49,059
我 是朋友
{\fs12}I'm... A friend.

711
01:15:50,094 --> 01:15:51,794
我不想待在這裏
{\fs12}I don't wanna be here.

712
01:15:51,796 --> 01:15:53,898
我不想去鬼魂呆的地方
{\fs12}I don't wanna go where the spirits go.

713
01:15:59,203 --> 01:16:00,468
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise...

714
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:04,272
不管你爸爸怎麼說
{\fs12}no matter what your daddy says...

715
01:16:04,274 --> 01:16:07,080
你得做你該做的事
{\fs12}you have to go on doing what you do.

716
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:11,783
不要害怕你的能力
{\fs12}Never be afraid of your ability.

717
01:16:16,753 --> 01:16:19,690
爸爸對我大吼大叫時 並不是他的本意
{\fs12}Daddy doesn't mean it when he yells at me.

718
01:16:20,791 --> 01:16:22,361
他很害怕...
{\fs12}He's scared...

719
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:25,231
那個拿著鑰匙的人
{\fs12}of the man with the keys.

720
01:16:25,829 --> 01:16:28,034
他才是控制一切的人
{\fs12}He's the one controlling it all.

721
01:16:28,664 --> 01:16:31,336
他是打開所有門的人
{\fs12}He's the one who opens all the doors.

722
01:16:34,939 --> 01:16:39,141
他打開所有的紅門嗎 - 是的
{\fs12}He opens all the red doors? - Yes.

723
01:16:39,143 --> 01:16:42,343
拿著鑰匙的人說 我比表面更強大
{\fs12}The man with the keys said I'm more powerful than I know.

724
01:16:42,345 --> 01:16:45,080
他要我幫他打開每一扇門
{\fs12}He says he wants me to help him open every door.

725
01:16:45,082 --> 01:16:47,685
他無論如何都要得到我
{\fs12}He says he'll do anything it takes to get me.

726
01:16:50,253 --> 01:16:52,286
他就站在你後面
{\fs12}He's standing right behind you.

727
01:16:53,659 --> 01:16:55,290
不
{\fs12}No!

728
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:58,129
離開這裏
{\fs12}Leave this place!

729
01:17:04,268 --> 01:17:06,938
伊莉絲 醒醒
{\fs12}Elise, wake up.

730
01:17:08,405 --> 01:17:09,707
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise!

731
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:12,879
斯派克
{\fs12}Specs!

732
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:15,515
我需要幫助
{\fs12}I need help!

733
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,516
這裏 小心她的頭 - 走
{\fs12}Here. Careful with her head. - Go, go, go.

734
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:21,817
她去另一邊了
{\fs12}She's on the other side.

735
01:17:21,819 --> 01:17:23,919
總得有人進去幫忙
{\fs12}Somebody has to go in and help. - Yeah,

736
01:17:23,921 --> 01:17:26,187
誰會這麼做 我做不到 你能嗎
{\fs12}who's gonna do that? I can't do that, can you do that?

737
01:17:26,189 --> 01:17:27,257
我沒說... - 我能行
{\fs12}I didn't say... - I can do it.

738
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,726
我可以幫她
{\fs12}I can help her.

739
01:17:31,728 --> 01:17:35,496
我以前從沒催眠過任何人
{\fs12}I've never actually hypnotized anybody before.

740
01:17:35,498 --> 01:17:37,432
我從沒被催眠過
{\fs12}I've never been hypnotized.

741
01:17:37,434 --> 01:17:40,070
那你就不知道 我做對做錯了吧
{\fs12}Well, then you won't know what I'm doing wrong, right?

742
01:17:46,009 --> 01:17:47,513
OK
{\fs12}Okay, um...

743
01:17:48,278 --> 01:17:49,745
練習一下 一點點...
{\fs12}The exercise, it's a little...

744
01:17:49,747 --> 01:17:52,246
我要 我把手指放在那兒
{\fs12}I'm gonna... I'll put my finger there.

745
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:53,784
外星人
{\fs12}E.T.

746
01:17:55,086 --> 01:17:56,884
伊莫金
{\fs12}Imogen.

747
01:17:56,886 --> 01:17:58,719
太酷了
{\fs12}That's pretty cool.

748
01:17:58,721 --> 01:18:01,357
看這裏
{\fs12}Just look here. - Mm-hm.

749
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,558
集中精力 放鬆一下
{\fs12}And, uh, concentrate on it and just relax.

750
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,062
想像你的身體 是由水組成的
{\fs12}Imagine that your body is made of water

751
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:08,731
而你卻在海裏
{\fs12}and you're in the ocean.

752
01:18:08,733 --> 01:18:10,770
這沒道理
{\fs12}That doesn't make sense.

753
01:18:11,034 --> 01:18:13,000
什麼 - 她是水做的
{\fs12}What? - She's made of water...

754
01:18:13,002 --> 01:18:16,838
她在海裏 因此她就是海洋
{\fs12}and she's in the ocean. Therefore, she is the ocean.

755
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:18,909
要不換你來
{\fs12}Would you like to do this?

756
01:18:23,546 --> 01:18:26,281
謝謝 - 我還在這裏
{\fs12}Thank you. - I'll still be here.

757
01:18:26,283 --> 01:18:28,549
不要觸摸目標 - 我沒有
{\fs12}Don't touch the subject. - I'm not.

758
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:30,153
讓開
{\fs12}Move away.

759
01:18:47,637 --> 01:18:49,204
閉上眼睛
{\fs12}Close your eyes.

760
01:18:49,206 --> 01:18:53,107
聽著滴答聲
{\fs12}Listen to the ticking.

761
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:55,242
集中精力
{\fs12}Focus on it.

762
01:18:55,244 --> 01:18:58,580
我從五倒數
{\fs12}I'm going to count back from five.

763
01:18:58,582 --> 01:19:03,156
當我數到一 你會被催眠
{\fs12}By the time I reach one, you will be hypnotized.

764
01:19:03,953 --> 01:19:06,623
五 四
{\fs12}Five, four...

765
01:19:07,923 --> 01:19:12,260
三 二 一
{\fs12}three, two, one.

766
01:19:12,262 --> 01:19:14,966
如果你能聽到我 就點頭
{\fs12}Nod if you can hear me.

767
01:19:19,636 --> 01:19:23,205
我說"現在" 你就睜開眼睛
{\fs12}When I say "now," you will open your eyes,

768
01:19:23,207 --> 01:19:26,844
你就去了另一邊
{\fs12}and you will be on the other side.

769
01:19:30,646 --> 01:19:32,382
現在
{\fs12}Now.

770
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:57,707
想去那裏
{\fs12}Wanna go there.

771
01:20:19,662 --> 01:20:21,264
我會幫你的
{\fs12}I'll help you.

772
01:21:04,373 --> 01:21:06,143
紅門
{\fs12}Red door.

773
01:21:07,511 --> 01:21:09,210
紅門
{\fs12}Red door.

774
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:12,714
那是伊莉絲說的紅門
{\fs12}That's the red door Elise was talking about.

775
01:21:12,716 --> 01:21:15,219
就是這個地方
{\fs12}This is the place.

776
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:44,278
我不能進去
{\fs12}I can't go in there.

777
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:47,182
如果他找到我 他會
{\fs12}If he finds me, he'll...

778
01:21:47,184 --> 01:21:49,021
他會再打我的
{\fs12}He'll take me again.

779
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,954
相信我 你會找到你要找的東西
{\fs12}Trust me. You'll find what you're looking for in there.

780
01:21:52,956 --> 01:21:54,992
拜託
{\fs12}Please!

781
01:21:56,292 --> 01:21:57,860
我承認
{\fs12}I admit it!

782
01:21:57,862 --> 01:21:59,363
閉嘴
{\fs12}Shut up!

783
01:22:00,764 --> 01:22:02,400
沒錯
{\fs12}That's right!

784
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,302
伊莉絲
{\fs12}Elise?

785
01:22:07,203 --> 01:22:10,272
鑰匙不見了
{\fs12}The key is missing.

786
01:22:11,277 --> 01:22:13,477
你們必須再次拿到
{\fs12}You're all gonna get it again!

787
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:35,097
你有沒有想到那些人
{\fs12}Do you ever think about the people

788
01:22:35,099 --> 01:22:36,697
坐電椅的人
{\fs12}who go to the electric chair?

789
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:39,099
有時吧
{\fs12}Sometimes.

790
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:41,572
你好奇他們去哪兒了嗎
{\fs12}Do you wonder where they go?

791
01:22:46,444 --> 01:22:48,776
現在輪到你了

01:24:05,555 --> 01:24:08,359
如果我們不正面對抗他們的話
{\fs12}...if we do not confront them head-on.

她需要知道

801
01:24:42,993 --> 01:24:44,893
沒人會像她這樣愛她

你爸爸就是其中之一

我不會再讓你傷害我了

你看到鬼魂了嗎
{\fs12}Did you see a ghost?

810
01:25:19,863 --> 01:25:22,097
你說沒看見就行了
{\fs12}Just say no. That's all you have to do.

811
01:25:22,099 --> 01:25:25,333
你不能因此懲罰我 又不是我的訴求
{\fs12}You can't punish me for this. I never wanted it.

812
01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:26,569
我從未訴求過
