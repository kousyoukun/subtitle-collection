1
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,541
Friday, 30 November, 1962

2
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:29,369
Waking up begins with saying "am" and "now".

3
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,705
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.

4
00:03:51,141 --> 00:03:54,686
For the past eight months waking up has actually hurt.

5
00:03:59,316 --> 00:04:02,903
The cold realization that I'm still here slowly sets in.

6
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:07,574
I was never teribly fond of waking up.

7
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,618
I was never one to jump out of bed

8
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,245
and greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

9
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,416
I used to want to punch him sometimes in the morning he was so happy.

10
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:18,210
I always used to tell him that

11
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:20,462
only fools greet the day with a smile...

12
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:23,798
...that only fools possibly escape the simple truth.

13
00:04:24,216 --> 00:04:26,927
That now isn't simply now.

14
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:31,640
It's a cold reminder. One day later than yesterday.

15
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,309
One year later than last year.

16
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:39,022
And that sooner or later it will come.

17
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,651
He used to laugh at me and then give me kiss on the cheek.

18
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,947
It takes time in the morning for me to become George.

19
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:48,949
The time to adjust to

20
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,035
what is expected of George and how he is to behave.

21
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:56,706
By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish...

22
00:04:56,706 --> 00:04:57,999
...on the now slightly stiff

23
00:04:57,999 --> 00:05:00,293
but quite perfect George...

24
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:04,714
...I know fully what part I'm supposed to play

25
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,396
Looking in the mirror staring back at me

26
00:05:19,396 --> 00:05:21,022
isn't so much as a face...

27
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,608
...as the expression of a predicament.

28
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:27,112
Just get through the goddamn day.

29
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,075
A bit melodramatic, I guess.

30
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:33,827
But then again...

31
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,080
...my heart has been broken.

32
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:41,793
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...

33
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:43,503
...can't breathe.

34
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,350
Aren't you going to say something?

35
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,144
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.

36
00:06:41,436 --> 00:06:42,562
What are you doing?

37
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,565
Just stop it. Stop it.

38
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:46,650
I don't think that you're quite ready for

39
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:48,360
life in a glass house.

40
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,028
Drapes, old man.

41
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:55,909
You're the one who is always saying that we are invisible.

42
00:06:57,452 --> 00:06:58,787
That's not exactly what I meant.

43
00:07:22,185 --> 00:07:24,729
For the first time in my life I can't see my future.

44
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:29,025
Every day goes by in a haze.

45
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:34,030
But today I have decided will be different.

46
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,502
Finally. You know it's been raining here all day.

47
00:07:47,502 --> 00:07:50,172
I've been trapped in this house waiting for you to call.

48
00:07:50,213 --> 00:07:51,756
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

49
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,134
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.

50
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:57,137
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.

51
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:58,805
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...

52
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,724
...correct number. How may I help you?

53
00:08:00,765 --> 00:08:02,642
This is Harold Ackerley.

54
00:08:02,642 --> 00:08:04,269
I'm Jim's cousin.

55
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,980
Of course. Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.

56
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm afraid I'm calling with some bad news.

57
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,112
There has been a car accident.

58
00:08:15,322 --> 00:08:16,489
An accident?

59
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:19,826
There has been a lot of snow here lately and the roads have been icy.

60
00:08:21,119 --> 00:08:24,539
On his way into town, Jim lost control of his car.

61
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,335
It was instantaneous apparently.

62
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:36,760
It happened late yesterday, but his parents didn't want to call you.

63
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:40,514
I see.

64
00:08:41,097 --> 00:08:43,183
In fact, they don't that I'm calling you now.

65
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:45,268
But I thought that you should know.

66
00:08:51,983 --> 00:08:52,859
Thank you.

67
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:58,365
I know this must be quite a shock. It was for all of us.

68
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:01,368
Yes, indeed.

69
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:09,417
Will there be a service?        The day after tomorrow.

70
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:15,298
Well, I suppose I should get off the phone...

71
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:18,510
...and book a plane flight.

72
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,721
The service is just for family.

73
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:26,977
For family, of course.

74
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,606
Well, thank you for calling.

75
00:09:33,608 --> 00:09:35,402
Mr. Ackerley?        Yes?

76
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,071
May I ask what happened to the dogs?

77
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,030
Dogs?

78
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,827
There was a dog with him but he died. Was there another one?

79
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,912
Yes, there was a small female.

80
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:48,165
I don't know, I'm sorry.

81
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:51,710
I haven't heard anyone mentioning another dog.

82
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:01,469
Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.

83
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,929
Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.

84
00:13:52,993 --> 00:13:54,286
Hello, Charley.

85
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:55,912
How did you know it was me?

86
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:58,790
Charlotte, nobody else calls me before eight in the morning.

87
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:02,836
I didn't call too early, did I? You sound grumpy.

88
00:14:02,836 --> 00:14:05,046
No, I have a headache.

89
00:14:05,088 --> 00:14:06,840
Listen, I was going to call you actually.

90
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,758
Is it too late to change my mind about tonight.

91
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:11,011
No, of course not.

92
00:14:11,011 --> 00:14:12,554
I haven't seen you all week.

93
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:17,267
I'm dying for a dose of you.        I know, I'm sorry.

94
00:14:17,976 --> 00:14:18,852
So great, I'll see you tonight.

95
00:14:18,852 --> 00:14:20,687
I have to run. I'm late for the work.

96
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,690
I'll call you later from school.

97
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:25,859
Alright, I see you then.

98
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:28,236
Bye, kiddo.        Bye, old man.

99
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,574
Good morning, Mr. George.

100
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,745
Sir, you don't look so good today.

101
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:21,456
Good morning, Alva. No, I didn't sleep very well.

102
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,292
You forgot to take the bread out of the freezer this morning.

103
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,752
It stays fresh that way.

104
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:27,754
It was a little too fresh this morning.

105
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:29,840
There are some papers laid out on my desk...

106
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,425
...which need to stay there. Please don't move them.

107
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:34,594
I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.

108
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:35,929
It's okay, sir.

109
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:38,014
Alva?        Yes, sir?

110
00:15:38,014 --> 00:15:40,809
Thank you, you're a wonderful.

111
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:51,922
This government, as promised,

112
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,883
has maintained the closest surveillance...

113
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:59,262
...of the Soviet military buildup on the Island of Cuba.

114
00:16:59,471 --> 00:17:02,807
Within the past week unmistakable evidence...

115
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,392
...has established the fact...

116
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:16,506
Professor Falconer?        Yes?

117
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:18,884
There was a student here this morning asking for your address.

118
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:19,926
My address?

119
00:18:22,012 --> 00:18:24,222
Did you give it to him?        Yes, sir.

120
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:25,390
I did.

121
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:27,601
I hope that's okay.

122
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,521
I realize that I probably shouldn't have but he was very nice.

123
00:18:31,563 --> 00:18:33,023
Before I knew it he...

124
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,194
Your hair looks great up like that. I really fits suits you.

125
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,156
You always look so beautiful...

126
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:43,283
...really fresh...

127
00:18:43,283 --> 00:18:45,118
You have such a lovely smile.

128
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,962
Arpege?        Sir?

129
00:18:57,797 --> 00:18:59,132
Really beautiful.

130
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:12,395
...that a series of offensive missile sites...

131
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:15,315
Good morning, Don.        Good morning, George.

132
00:19:30,372 --> 00:19:31,665
Good morning, George.

133
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:33,792
Good morning, Grant.

134
00:19:35,377 --> 00:19:37,170
You look awful. What have you been doing?

135
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,134
Look around you, Grant.

136
00:19:43,635 --> 00:19:46,263
Most of these students aspire to nothing more than corporate job...

137
00:19:46,888 --> 00:19:48,014
...and a desire to raise

138
00:19:48,014 --> 00:19:50,141
coke-drinking, TV-watching children...

139
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:51,393
...who as soon as they can speak

140
00:19:51,434 --> 00:19:52,352
start chanting TV jingles...

141
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:53,520
...and smashing things with hammers.

142
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,397
You're really scaring me today, George.

143
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,190
Don't tell me. You have easy time with these students.

144
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,358
I found them staring at me

145
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:00,277
in a kind of bovine stupor...

146
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:02,070
...as if I were lecturing in a foreign language.

147
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,114
Remind me why we shouldn't all just be annihilated.

148
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:06,157
You seem to think this is all a joke.

149
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:08,660
We're living in a world where nuclear war is a real threat.

150
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,787
I don't understand how that doesn't concern you.

151
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:11,872
You're serious, aren't you?

152
00:20:11,872 --> 00:20:13,707
Yes, I'm serious.

153
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:14,708
George did you even read

154
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:16,960
the article I gave you on bomb shelters?

155
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,045
Our is almost done. We had 3 contractors work on it...

156
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,714
...so none of them know what we've got.

157
00:20:20,964 --> 00:20:22,215
I'm having the outside of it landscaped

158
00:20:22,215 --> 00:20:23,758
so no one will that it's there.

159
00:20:23,758 --> 00:20:24,467
Really?

160
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:29,764
If word gets out that you've got a better shelter...

161
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:32,058
...then everyone will try to get in when something happens.

162
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,185
So?

163
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:34,769
There will be no time for sentiment

164
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:36,855
when the Russians fire a missile at us.

165
00:20:37,564 --> 00:20:39,858
If it's going to be a world with no time for sentiment Grant...

166
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,443
...the it's not a world that I want to live in.

167
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,532
After Many a Summer

168
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:30,367
Dies the Swan.

169
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:36,790
I think you've all...

170
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:39,584
...read the Huxley novel

171
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,837
I assigned more than three weeks ago?

172
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:47,634
How does the title relate to our story?

173
00:21:48,885 --> 00:21:49,803
Yes, Mr. Mong.

174
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:51,096
It doesn't.

175
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:52,764
It's about a rich guy

176
00:21:52,806 --> 00:21:55,892
who's too afraid that he's too old for this girl...

177
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,602
...and thinks that a young guy...

178
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:27,799
Russ.

179
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:40,437
Russ?

180
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,041
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

181
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:05,170
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...

182
00:23:05,212 --> 00:23:06,963
...the stupidest text in the Bible is

183
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:09,090
they hated me without a cause.

184
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,468
Does that mean the Nazis were right to hate the Jews?

185
00:23:11,468 --> 00:23:13,845
Is Huxley an anti-Semite?        No.

186
00:23:22,479 --> 00:23:25,315
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.

187
00:23:26,399 --> 00:23:28,235
Of course, the Nazis were wrong to hate the Jews.

188
00:23:28,235 --> 00:23:30,445
But their hating the Jews was not without a cause.

189
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,242
It's just that the cause wasn't real.

190
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,661
The cause was imagined.

191
00:23:37,911 --> 00:23:40,914
The cause was fear.

192
00:23:42,707 --> 00:23:44,835
Let's leave the Jews out o this just for a moment.

193
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,713
Let's think of another minority. One that...

194
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:51,633
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

195
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:56,346
There are all sorts of minorities,

196
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:58,431
blondes for example...

197
00:23:59,015 --> 00:24:00,600
...or people with freckles.

198
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,437
But a minority is only thought of as one...

199
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:07,816
...when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority.

200
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:10,193
A real threat or an imagined one.

201
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,988
And therein lies the fear.

202
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,617
If the minority is somehow invisible...

203
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,414
...and the fear is much greater.

204
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:27,210
That fear is why the minority is persecuted.

205
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,879
So, you see there always is a cause.

206
00:24:28,962 --> 00:24:30,130
The cause is fear.

207
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,048
Minorities are just people.

208
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,302
People like us.

209
00:24:42,434 --> 00:24:44,144
I can see that I've lost you a bit.

210
00:24:45,228 --> 00:24:49,065
So tell you what? We're gonna forget about Mr. Huxley today...

211
00:24:49,816 --> 00:24:51,651
...and we're gonna talk about fear.

212
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:55,155
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.

213
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,991
Fear is taking over our world.

214
00:24:57,991 --> 00:25:01,995
Fear is being used as a tool of manipulation in our society.

215
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:04,456
It's how politicians peddle policy.

216
00:25:05,624 --> 00:25:07,167
It's how Madison Avenue sells us

217
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,668
things that we don't need.

218
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,836
Think about it.

219
00:25:11,505 --> 00:25:13,048
Fear of being attacked.

220
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:17,010
Fear of that there are communists lurking around every corner.

221
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:19,763
Fear of that some little Caribbean country...

222
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:21,264
...that doesn't believe in our way of life

223
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:22,474
poses a threat to us.

224
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:24,935
Fear that black culture may take over the world.

225
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:27,437
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.

226
00:25:29,272 --> 00:25:31,358
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.

227
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:37,239
Fear that our bad breath might ruin our friendships.

228
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,203
Fear of growing old and being alone.

229
00:25:50,627 --> 00:25:54,172
The of that we're useless and that no one cares what we have to say.

230
00:25:59,386 --> 00:26:00,220
Have a good weekend.

231
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,521
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?

232
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,691
Why don't you always talk to us like that?

233
00:26:12,816 --> 00:26:14,359
I don't think it went over very well.

234
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:17,195
Man, fear of things gets to me all the time.

235
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:20,323
But you can't talk about it with anyone or you just sound like a fool.

236
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:22,075
You can't even talk about it with Lois?

237
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:24,327
I don't think she's afraid of anything.

238
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:25,912
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.

239
00:26:26,288 --> 00:26:27,581
What are you afraid of, sir?

240
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:29,249
Cars.

241
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,502
How can you live in Los Angeles and be afraid of cars?

242
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:33,753
Maybe you can't.

243
00:26:34,421 --> 00:26:38,008
Sometimes my fear of things can almost paralyze me.

244
00:26:38,925 --> 00:26:40,302
It's like I get really panic stricken

245
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:42,345
and I feel like I might explode or something.

246
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,682
May I ask you a personal question, sir?

247
00:26:45,682 --> 00:26:46,683
If you like.

248
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,894
Do you ever get high?

249
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:51,771
How old do I look to you?

250
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:53,607
Have you ever taken any drugs?

251
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:56,026
Of course, Kenny.

252
00:26:57,027 --> 00:26:57,944
Like what?

253
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,030
I don't feel I should be discussing

254
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,449
this with you on campus Mr. Potter.

255
00:27:02,782 --> 00:27:04,576
It's the only way I get by sometimes.

256
00:27:05,952 --> 00:27:07,287
Have you ever tried mescaline?

257
00:27:07,287 --> 00:27:09,122
Not my drug of choice.

258
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,208
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once on mescaline.

259
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:12,751
Not a good look for me.

260
00:27:13,043 --> 00:27:15,295
Sir?        I looked in the mirror.

261
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:17,464
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.

262
00:27:17,464 --> 00:27:20,342
I decided that my eyebrows were taking over my face.

263
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:21,718
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.

264
00:27:21,718 --> 00:27:22,802
I wore a band-aid over my eye

265
00:27:22,802 --> 00:27:24,596
for about six weeks while my brow grew back.

266
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:25,472
Very embarrassing.

267
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:27,557
You didn't take it again after that?

268
00:27:27,682 --> 00:27:28,767
Kenny, have you been listening to me?

269
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,852
I shaved off my eyebrow.

270
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,854
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,

271
00:27:32,854 --> 00:27:34,564
not a career on stage.

272
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:40,779
If you ever want to get high sir, I usually have some dope.

273
00:27:41,613 --> 00:27:43,824
You're really mad aren't you?

274
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:51,498
I'm sorry, sir.

275
00:27:51,498 --> 00:27:54,125
I guess you don't feel very comfortable talking like this.

276
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,460
What makes you say that?

277
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,089
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey. Like this morning...

278
00:27:59,089 --> 00:27:59,965
...when you were listening to

279
00:27:59,965 --> 00:28:02,217
all that crap we were talking about Huxley.

280
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,593
Well, not all of you.

281
00:28:03,593 --> 00:28:05,512
I didn't notice you open your mouth once.

282
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:06,805
I was watching you.

283
00:28:08,056 --> 00:28:09,516
You let us ramble on and on

284
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,601
and then you straighten us out.

285
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:15,355
But you never really tell us everything you know about something.

286
00:28:16,523 --> 00:28:19,693
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.

287
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:22,863
It's not that I want to be cagey.

288
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,118
It's just that I can't really discuss things completely openly...

289
00:28:28,118 --> 00:28:28,869
...at school.

290
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:31,580
Someone would misunderstand.

291
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,168
I tried that today. It didn't really work out.

292
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:44,968
What was it you wanted to get, sir?

293
00:28:44,968 --> 00:28:47,304
Nothing. I was on my way to the dean's office.

294
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:50,807
You mean you walked all the way down here just to talk to me?

295
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:52,809
Why not?        Well...

296
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:54,936
I think you deserve something for that, sir.

297
00:28:55,979 --> 00:28:57,272
Here sir, take your pick.

298
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,484
It's on me.        Thank you.

299
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:06,573
I thought you'd probably pick blue.

300
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:08,283
Why blue?

301
00:29:08,283 --> 00:29:10,327
Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?

302
00:29:10,327 --> 00:29:12,162
What makes you think I'm spiritual?

303
00:29:15,832 --> 00:29:17,250
And you? Red?

304
00:29:19,252 --> 00:29:22,047
What is red stand for?        A lot of things.

305
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:23,757
Rage, lust.

306
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:26,259
No kidding?

307
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,391
Well sir, I...

308
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:35,644
I guess I see you around.

309
00:30:58,101 --> 00:30:59,186
Hello?

310
00:30:59,352 --> 00:31:00,770
What are you up to, kiddo?

311
00:31:00,812 --> 00:31:04,399
Just trying to finish up a book. How's your day going?

312
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:05,358
Fine.

313
00:31:06,026 --> 00:31:06,693
I was just leaving school

314
00:31:06,693 --> 00:31:08,778
and wanted to know if you needed anything for tonight.

315
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:12,365
Thanks, you're sweet.

316
00:31:12,532 --> 00:31:13,658
But I think I'm all set.

317
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:17,078
Be a darling and...

318
00:31:17,078 --> 00:31:20,332
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.

319
00:31:20,332 --> 00:31:22,042
I love the color of the bottle.

320
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:26,171
You love what's in it. What time do you want me?

321
00:31:26,922 --> 00:31:29,883
7 would be great if that's ok with you.

322
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:32,177
Perfect. I'll see you then.

323
00:31:32,177 --> 00:31:34,346
I'll see you then. Bye, Geo.

324
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:35,388
Bye, kiddo.

325
00:31:57,911 --> 00:31:59,579
Beautiful.

326
00:32:55,218 --> 00:32:56,136
Yes, Mr. Potter?

327
00:32:56,136 --> 00:32:57,679
Are you going somewhere, sir?

328
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:00,682
That is usually why people get into their cars.

329
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,018
No, I mean are you going on vacation or something?

330
00:33:03,018 --> 00:33:03,810
What?

331
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,687
I saw you cleaning out your office.

332
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:13,528
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?

333
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:16,406
I was just hoping that perhaps

334
00:33:16,406 --> 00:33:18,909
we could get together for a drink or something sometime.

335
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:20,952
Why is that?

336
00:33:22,662 --> 00:33:23,663
I don't know, sir.

337
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:27,501
Because I think you might like it. And...

338
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,420
...because you seem as though you could use a friend.

339
00:33:30,462 --> 00:33:32,923
Oh really?        Yes, sir. You do.

340
00:33:37,636 --> 00:33:39,012
They may be right.

341
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:42,974
It will have to be another time. I'm late.

342
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,686
But thank you for the invitation.

343
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:49,523
And thank you for the talk earlier.

344
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:52,901
And stay away from the mescaline.

345
00:34:26,393 --> 00:34:27,811
Hello, Mr. Falconer.

346
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:30,063
Hello. How are you today?        I'm fine, sir.

347
00:34:30,063 --> 00:34:32,482
Do you need to get into your box?        Yes, I do.

348
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:33,733
Follow me.

349
00:34:42,826 --> 00:34:43,910
Here you are, sir.

350
00:34:46,454 --> 00:34:48,081
If you could please sign here...

351
00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:58,175
Thank you.        Thank you.

352
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:08,286
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

353
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:11,289
What would you like to know?

354
00:36:11,915 --> 00:36:14,793
I don't know. You seem very intimate I guess.

355
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,796
Like you were once together or something.

356
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:22,008
You haven't slept with her, have you?        Yes.

357
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,720
And?

358
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:29,474
A few times when we were young.

359
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,518
I wouldn't say that it meant nothing to me...

360
00:36:31,518 --> 00:36:33,687
...but it certainly meant a great deal more to Charley.

361
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:36,314
It was a long time ago in London.

362
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,609
I love Charley.

363
00:36:40,735 --> 00:36:42,571
And We were very close friends but that's all.

364
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:43,780
Well, I'm confused.

365
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:46,783
If you sleep with women then why are you with me?

366
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:48,618
Because I fall in love with men.

367
00:36:48,618 --> 00:36:50,620
Because I fell in love with you.

368
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:56,126
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with women when they're young?

369
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:58,545
I haven't.        You're joking.

370
00:36:58,545 --> 00:36:59,838
No, I'm not.

371
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:02,841
It was just never anything that interested me.

372
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:03,675
Well, you're awfully

373
00:37:03,717 --> 00:37:04,968
modern aren't you?

374
00:37:05,552 --> 00:37:07,971
You know, I think that was the first thing that I noticed about you...

375
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:11,975
...was how sure of yourself you were.

376
00:37:14,978 --> 00:37:17,355
How can you be so sure about everything at your age?

377
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:20,650
You think I'm sure of myself?

378
00:37:21,485 --> 00:37:22,486
Of course, you are.

379
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,676
I'm finished now. Thank you.

380
00:37:52,849 --> 00:37:54,100
Yes, Mr. Falconer?

381
00:37:55,352 --> 00:37:57,270
Is there something else we can help you with today?

382
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,981
I can't find my check book and I need some cash.

383
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:03,485
Not my day I'm afraid. Excuse me a minute.

384
00:38:57,414 --> 00:39:00,250
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,

385
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:01,668
but I think yours are pretty.

386
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:04,671
I think yours are pretty too.

387
00:39:05,172 --> 00:39:06,840
Why do you look so sad?

388
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,050
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

389
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:11,887
Ben Hur.

390
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:15,974
He's our scorpion.

391
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:20,187
Every night we throw in something new to him and watch him kill it.

392
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:22,606
Daddy says it's like the colosseum.

393
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:25,358
So my brother Tom put on all the columns in here.

394
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,819
He wants to be a set designer.

395
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:30,030
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...

396
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,033
...cause he's still full from the moth we gave him last night.

397
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,453
Daddy says he wants to throw you in to the colosseum.

398
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,456
No kidding? Why?

399
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,666
He says you're light in your loafers...

400
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:44,127
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.

401
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:46,713
I think my brother Tom is light in his loafers too...

402
00:39:46,713 --> 00:39:49,299
...but he wears Keds.

403
00:39:50,509 --> 00:39:55,347
He made me do a hair conditioning treatment on my hair with eggs.

404
00:39:55,972 --> 00:39:57,390
Does it look shiny?

405
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:00,227
Sweetheart, what are you doing bothering Mr. Falconer?

406
00:40:00,227 --> 00:40:03,522
She's not bothering me at all Susan. How are you?

407
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,732
I'm glad to see you George.

408
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:09,069
George, we're having a few people over tonight for drinks...

409
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:11,154
...and would love to have you join us if you could.

410
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:13,406
Thank you. That's very kind of you but I have plans.

411
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:15,992
Another time then.

412
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,204
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get back to his banking.

413
00:40:19,204 --> 00:40:20,205
Goodbye, George.

414
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:22,290
Bye, Susan. Bye, Jennifer.

415
00:40:31,716 --> 00:40:33,009
May I help you, sir?

416
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:35,762
I'd like to buy some bullets for this gun, please.

417
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:39,432
Yes, sir. This is a really old gun, sir.

418
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:41,601
We have a two for one sale on handguns at the moment.

419
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:43,144
Perhaps one for the little lady?

420
00:40:43,186 --> 00:40:44,813
No thank you. Just the bullets, please.

421
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:49,568
Here you go. Anything else?

422
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:50,986
No, thank you.

423
00:40:51,027 --> 00:40:52,696
That would be $2.29, sir.

424
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:57,242
Thank you.

425
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:38,241
I'm sorry. I hope she didn't growl at you.

426
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,911
She goes a little crazy sometimes when I have to leave her in the car.

427
00:41:40,911 --> 00:41:42,496
She's perfect. What's her name?

428
00:41:42,704 --> 00:41:43,663
India.

429
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:45,457
Let's go there.

430
00:41:50,962 --> 00:41:51,922
You little baby.

431
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:59,846
I used to have smooth fox terriers. You don't see them very often.

432
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,119
The very smell of buttered toast.

433
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:25,622
She's still a puppy isn't she?

434
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:33,004
Well.

435
00:42:33,004 --> 00:42:35,131
Have a nice evening.        You too.

436
00:42:35,799 --> 00:42:36,842
Good night, India.

437
00:42:50,355 --> 00:42:51,982
I'm sorry about that.        No, It's ok.

438
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:55,152
It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.

439
00:42:55,485 --> 00:42:56,653
It's ok. Don't worry.

440
00:42:57,821 --> 00:42:59,030
No, no I insist.

441
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:04,995
Thank you.

442
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:07,205
I'm sorry about the broken glass.

443
00:43:07,956 --> 00:43:09,708
Here you go.        Thanks man.

444
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:12,919
You want one?

445
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:14,754
No, thanks.

446
00:43:16,965 --> 00:43:19,050
Actually, yes. Why not?

447
00:43:19,759 --> 00:43:20,468
Thank you.

448
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:54,252
Carlos.        What did you say?

449
00:43:54,252 --> 00:43:56,880
Carlos. You asked me my name.

450
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,048
Are you okay?

451
00:44:00,217 --> 00:44:00,967
Yeah.

452
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:02,802
Yeah, I'm sorry.

453
00:44:07,265 --> 00:44:09,100
You're really something.

454
00:44:09,684 --> 00:44:10,977
You have an incredible face.

455
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,647
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.

456
00:44:14,648 --> 00:44:16,024
Your Spanish is perfect.

457
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:16,858
Thank you.

458
00:44:20,987 --> 00:44:22,614
I should have used it more.

459
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:24,491
Well...

460
00:44:25,116 --> 00:44:26,034
It's not too late.

461
00:44:54,312 --> 00:44:55,272
What are you doing?

462
00:44:56,523 --> 00:44:57,899
Aren't we going somewhere?

463
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:02,028
No. But, thanks.

464
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:07,784
You know, it's the smog

465
00:45:07,784 --> 00:45:09,286
that makes it that color.

466
00:45:10,412 --> 00:45:12,622
I've never seen a sky like this before.

467
00:45:14,249 --> 00:45:17,377
Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty.

468
00:45:22,924 --> 00:45:24,634
Could I have another cigarette?

469
00:45:25,093 --> 00:45:26,011
Sure.

470
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:57,334
Are sure that you don't want to go for a drive?        I'm sure.

471
00:46:00,754 --> 00:46:02,881
Where are you from?        Madrid.

472
00:46:02,881 --> 00:46:05,509
Madrid? How did you get here?

473
00:46:06,134 --> 00:46:07,344
It's a long story.

474
00:46:08,011 --> 00:46:10,305
I met a guy from LA at the hotel where I worked...

475
00:46:10,305 --> 00:46:11,097
...who told me

476
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:14,684
I could live with him and that he could get me an agent.

477
00:46:14,684 --> 00:46:16,895
But he never realized that I have a Spanish accent.

478
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:21,858
I like your accent. You speak very well.

479
00:46:23,485 --> 00:46:24,861
How did you learn English?

480
00:46:25,779 --> 00:46:28,532
My mom had an American boyfriend when I was little.

481
00:46:28,657 --> 00:46:30,116
Is your mother in Madrid?

482
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:33,203
Yes, she is. She cuts hair.

483
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:35,121
She cut my hair before I left.

484
00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:36,665
Do you like it?

485
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:39,960
I thought it made me look like James Dean.

486
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,586
You are better than James Dean.

487
00:46:42,295 --> 00:46:43,296
Really?

488
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:44,214
Thanks.

489
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:51,763
No one has ever picked me up and not wanted something.

490
00:46:52,347 --> 00:46:53,765
I think you picked me up.

491
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,477
This is kind of a serious day for me.

492
00:46:58,353 --> 00:47:01,815
Come on. What could be so serious for a guy like you?

493
00:47:05,068 --> 00:47:07,070
I'm just trying to get over an old love I guess.

494
00:47:09,948 --> 00:47:12,325
My mother says that lovers are like buses.

495
00:47:12,325 --> 00:47:15,829
You just have to wait a little while and another one comes along.

496
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:22,919
I have to go.

497
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:26,089
You're a nice guy.

498
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:27,841
I hope you find...

499
00:47:27,841 --> 00:47:29,217
...someone like you.

500
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:30,844
Thanks.

501
00:47:31,928 --> 00:47:32,971
I'm going away.

502
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:33,323
It's your turn to change it.

503
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:36,326
Yeah, I'm not changing it. It's your turn.

504
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:38,995
Besides, you never like what I put on anyway.

505
00:48:38,995 --> 00:48:41,623
I'll give you five dollars if you change it. I'm too old to get up.

506
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:44,167
You're only old when it's convenient for you to be old.

507
00:48:44,668 --> 00:48:45,919
What are you reading anyway?

508
00:48:45,919 --> 00:48:46,837
Metamorphosis

509
00:48:47,712 --> 00:48:49,714
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.

510
00:48:49,756 --> 00:48:50,966
It's for my class.

511
00:48:52,843 --> 00:48:55,554
What highbrow work of fiction might you be reading?

512
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:57,097
Breakfast at Tiffany's

513
00:48:58,306 --> 00:49:00,016
Don't be so smug.

514
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:05,605
Man, what a life he has.

515
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:08,108
Don't you just envy him?        Why?

516
00:49:08,859 --> 00:49:11,069
Because he can sniff anyone's arse he wants?

517
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:12,946
Nice.

518
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:17,659
No, because he just does what he wants. Like yesterday...

519
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:20,370
...I was standing in the front yard and Susan came over to talk.

520
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:23,290
And that little brat of hers Christopher came...

521
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:25,625
...running over waving that damned gun of his around.

522
00:49:25,625 --> 00:49:30,046
And our little dog walked right up, hiked his leg...

523
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:32,382
...and peed all over Christopher's new tennis shoes.

524
00:49:32,382 --> 00:49:34,384
All over Christopher actually.

525
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:37,012
And of course, I had to act like I was upset

526
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:40,932
It was so perfectly executed you should have seen it.

527
00:49:41,266 --> 00:49:43,727
After all the times those kids have tortured that poor dog.

528
00:49:44,978 --> 00:49:46,813
I mean, you should take a lesson from him. They don't...

529
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:49,733
They don't stay up all night worrying.

530
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:51,067
They figured out

531
00:49:51,067 --> 00:49:53,737
how to get the two of us to do exactly what they want.

532
00:49:53,737 --> 00:49:54,863
They are basically

533
00:49:54,863 --> 00:49:58,742
very sophisticated little parasites when you think about it.

534
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:01,453
Well, the dumbest creatures are the happiest.

535
00:50:01,453 --> 00:50:02,662
Just look at your mother.

536
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,709
He's really just living the moment.

537
00:50:09,669 --> 00:50:10,921
It's like now.

538
00:50:11,505 --> 00:50:13,757
What could be better than being tucked up here with you?

539
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:21,681
If I died right now it would be OK.

540
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:25,393
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me

541
00:50:26,228 --> 00:50:28,605
so why don't you shut up and go change the record.

542
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:31,817
Good answer.

543
00:50:33,568 --> 00:50:34,694
You know what? I was thinking about taking them up...

544
00:50:34,694 --> 00:50:37,113
...to Denver with me next week if it's okay with you.

545
00:50:38,198 --> 00:50:39,866
It's my mom. She loves them.

546
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:42,786
Probably that recognition of a similar mind.

547
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,375
You stay there, old man.

548
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:21,658
Tie in a windsor.

549
00:54:34,059 --> 00:54:38,313
No, I did not forget the gin. I'll see you in ten minutes.

550
00:55:22,649 --> 00:55:25,569
Christopher, would you like it if I killed you?

551
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:26,653
I don't know.

552
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:29,197
If you keep this up we're going to find out.

553
00:55:29,197 --> 00:55:31,700
So, why don't you go home and stop shooting people?

554
00:56:03,482 --> 00:56:05,484
I'm so happy to see you.

555
00:56:10,405 --> 00:56:11,531
Come on in.

556
00:56:14,701 --> 00:56:17,662
It smells wonderful. I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?

557
00:56:17,662 --> 00:56:20,373
I gave her the night off. I'm cooking myself.

558
00:56:20,373 --> 00:56:22,667
You are?        Yes, I'm trying something new.

559
00:56:22,709 --> 00:56:24,419
Charley darling, "you cooking' is new.

560
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:25,420
Don't be smart.

561
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,173
I'm in a good mood tonight. I'm going to be fun.

562
00:56:28,173 --> 00:56:30,884
I've already made two New Year's resolutions.

563
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:34,429
Resolution one: No more talk that of awful ex-husbands...

564
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:36,306
..and children who don't give a damn.

565
00:56:36,598 --> 00:56:38,183
And the other one?        One what?

566
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:39,351
Resolution.

567
00:56:39,726 --> 00:56:40,894
Resolution two:

568
00:56:40,894 --> 00:56:44,439
More smoking and more drinking and screw it all! So come on...

569
00:56:44,481 --> 00:56:45,899
...mix me up a drink.

570
00:56:45,899 --> 00:56:47,651
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

571
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:50,821
And watch out baby!        Coming up.

572
00:56:55,575 --> 00:56:57,285
It was sweet of you to come tonight.

573
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:58,995
Sweet had nothing to do with it.

574
00:57:00,622 --> 00:57:04,835
I needed to see you.      Oh,Geo. Come off it.

575
00:57:05,252 --> 00:57:08,171
Whenever you do something sweet you're too ashamed to admit it.

576
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:11,258
Here is to our early New Year's resolutions.

577
00:57:15,303 --> 00:57:16,137
Cheers.

578
00:57:18,014 --> 00:57:19,891
What are your resolutions by the way?

579
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:26,106
To let go of the past completely, entirely, and forever.

580
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:30,110
Light me up, will you?

581
00:57:38,285 --> 00:57:40,871
Darling, you don't look well.

582
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:43,957
Do you remember that little heart attack you had last year?

583
00:57:43,957 --> 00:57:44,666
It wasn't a heart attack.

584
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,042
Well whatever it was darling...

585
00:57:46,042 --> 00:57:48,086
...you don't look so hot.

586
00:57:48,086 --> 00:57:51,339
I'm fine. I never felt better.

587
00:57:51,339 --> 00:57:52,632
I'm a little tired. I haven't been sleeping...

588
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:55,218
Geo, it's normal.

589
00:57:55,886 --> 00:57:57,804
You were with Jim for 16 years.

590
00:57:57,804 --> 00:58:00,682
I think about Richard every day.

591
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:02,058
It's hard being alone.

592
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,897
At least you have a job and a life.

593
00:58:08,106 --> 00:58:10,567
Let's have a bit of dinner shall we?

594
00:58:11,193 --> 00:58:15,113
Because I've worked so very hard.

595
00:58:15,906 --> 00:58:17,491
What are you talking about?

596
00:58:18,033 --> 00:58:19,534
Seriously, there no such thing as old anymore.

597
00:58:19,534 --> 00:58:22,829
The other day one of my students has called me a senior citizen.

598
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,582
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...

599
00:58:25,582 --> 00:58:28,502
...but I'm not sure senior is what I'm aiming for either.

600
00:58:28,543 --> 00:58:29,961
It's all becoming so bland.

601
00:58:29,961 --> 00:58:31,296
It's not why I came to America.

602
00:58:31,296 --> 00:58:33,798
It's like a complete breakdown of culture and manners.

603
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,717
The young ones have no manners.

604
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:38,094
The other day at the car wash

605
00:58:38,512 --> 00:58:40,430
a young man looked me up and down...

606
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:43,433
...and actually asked me if I was a natural blonde.

607
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:45,018
What did you say?        I looked him straight in the eye...

608
00:58:45,018 --> 00:58:48,855
...and said: "Let's just say if I stood on my head...

609
00:58:48,855 --> 00:58:51,149
...I would be a natural brunette with lovely breath.

610
00:58:51,149 --> 00:58:53,026
You didn't!        I did!

611
00:58:54,653 --> 00:58:58,240
And the amusing thing was that it went right over his head!

612
00:58:59,366 --> 00:59:02,202
You know, you had a mouth on you even back in London.

613
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:04,871
Do you remember that old lesbian who threw her drink over your head...

614
00:59:04,913 --> 00:59:07,290
...because you asked her if she was hung like a donut.

615
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:19,970
Geo.

616
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:22,848
We could always go back to London. The two of us.

617
00:59:22,848 --> 00:59:25,934
No, thanks.        You know you miss it.

618
00:59:25,976 --> 00:59:27,352
I miss it sometimes.

619
00:59:28,395 --> 00:59:29,980
Maybe if Jim had lived.

620
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:31,982
He loved being in England.

621
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,733
He asked us to stay the last time we were there.

622
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:35,694
Do you really think you would have moved?

623
00:59:38,196 --> 00:59:40,949
I don't know. It's silly to even talk about it. It was only a fantasy.

624
00:59:49,875 --> 00:59:50,876
What's this?

625
00:59:52,127 --> 00:59:53,211
It's my mother's wedding ring.

626
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:56,381
I found it a drawer when I was cleaning out.

627
01:00:03,763 --> 01:00:06,474
Charley my dear, you and I are both in need of another drink.

628
01:01:38,358 --> 01:01:40,360
Wait! Wait, wait!

629
01:01:49,536 --> 01:01:50,912
I love this!

630
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,291
You're insane!        Come on, old man!

631
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:14,871
Don't move.

632
01:03:24,089 --> 01:03:24,881
Thank you.

633
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:39,521
Very smooth cigarette move.        I've always wanted to do that.

634
01:03:41,106 --> 01:03:42,399
You don't even smoke.

635
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:44,734
Well, not for the last sixteen years. Jim hated it.

636
01:03:46,194 --> 01:03:48,488
What's to stop me now? It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.

637
01:03:55,412 --> 01:03:58,874
This is so nice, lying here with you.

638
01:04:00,834 --> 01:04:02,502
Don't you ever miss this?

639
01:04:03,712 --> 01:04:05,547
What we could have been to each other?

640
01:04:06,339 --> 01:04:09,342
Having a real relationship and kids?

641
01:04:12,637 --> 01:04:17,017
I had Jim.        I know, but I mean a real relationship.

642
01:04:18,185 --> 01:04:19,144
Geo, let's be honest,

643
01:04:19,144 --> 01:04:22,063
what you and Jim had together was wonderful but...

644
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,443
...wasn't it really just a substitute for something else?

645
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:31,740
Is that really what you think after all of these years?

646
01:04:34,326 --> 01:04:38,622
You think Jim was just some kind of substitute for real love?

647
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:46,421
Jim was not a substitute for anything.

648
01:04:47,297 --> 01:04:48,423
Do you understand?

649
01:04:49,174 --> 01:04:51,051
There is no substitute for Jim...

650
01:04:51,051 --> 01:04:52,177
...anywhere!

651
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:55,722
And by the way, what is so real about your relationship with Richard?

652
01:04:55,722 --> 01:04:57,933
He left you after nine years!

653
01:04:59,643 --> 01:05:01,853
Jim and I were together for sixteen years!

654
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,897
And if he hadn't died we would still be together!

655
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:05,941
What the hell is not real about that?

656
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:08,151
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

657
01:05:08,735 --> 01:05:10,487
I know how much the two of you loved each other.

658
01:05:12,155 --> 01:05:15,242
I suppose I'm just jealous that you and I never had that kind of love.

659
01:05:19,246 --> 01:05:21,540
Actually, I've never had that kind of love with anybody.

660
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,336
I don't think Richard ever loved me...

661
01:05:26,837 --> 01:05:27,796
...except for the way I looked.

662
01:05:27,796 --> 01:05:29,673
And Clay...

663
01:05:30,173 --> 01:05:32,133
I don't know. You raise a child and love it...

664
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:34,094
...and then when they are old enough they just leave.

665
01:05:35,387 --> 01:05:37,180
Charley, there is nothing wrong with your life.

666
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:38,598
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.

667
01:05:38,598 --> 01:05:39,933
It's one of your great pleasures.

668
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:42,227
And it's not one of yours?

669
01:05:42,227 --> 01:05:44,187
You're as pathetic as I am.

670
01:05:44,187 --> 01:05:47,023
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely not one of my great pleasures.

671
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:48,441
Well, it's not one of mine either.

672
01:05:48,441 --> 01:05:50,402
I don't like feeling sorry for myself one bit.

673
01:05:50,443 --> 01:05:52,279
I tried to hold onto Richard for so long...

674
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,364
...even when it was obvious to everyone but me that it was over.

675
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:55,949
And now Clay is grown up.

676
01:05:55,949 --> 01:05:58,743
I mean, what am I doing here Geo? Tell me, what?

677
01:05:58,743 --> 01:06:01,329
You have plenty of friends. You'll be fine.

678
01:06:01,538 --> 01:06:03,623
Yes, I have friends. But none of them need me.

679
01:06:03,623 --> 01:06:04,457
And yes I have you

680
01:06:04,499 --> 01:06:07,460
and if you weren't such a goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

681
01:06:14,134 --> 01:06:16,303
I only have you now because you lost Jim.

682
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:17,971
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.

683
01:06:17,971 --> 01:06:19,598
It's not as easy for a woman.

684
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:21,475
I've done everything the way I was supposed to and...

685
01:06:21,475 --> 01:06:23,894
...all I have to keep me company is a bottle of gin.

686
01:06:24,394 --> 01:06:26,396
Maybe you should try donuts with your gin.

687
01:06:27,814 --> 01:06:28,899
Screw you.

688
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,987
Charlotte, you are dramatic.

689
01:06:34,988 --> 01:06:36,323
I swear you really almost had me.

690
01:06:36,323 --> 01:06:39,159
A tiny tear was beginning to form in the corner of my eye.

691
01:06:40,452 --> 01:06:41,411
Now stop it.

692
01:06:42,162 --> 01:06:45,248
You are still breathtakingly beautiful.

693
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:48,210
When you can be bothered to get up and out of bed...

694
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,504
...and you stop whimpering about everything for five minutes.

695
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:55,175
Go to London. Change your life.

696
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:57,636
If you're not happy being a woman then stop acting like one.

697
01:06:58,011 --> 01:06:59,429
You have all the answers.

698
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:02,349
No, I don't have any to mention.

699
01:07:03,225 --> 01:07:05,727
If you're so smart why don't you have something new in your life?

700
01:07:06,019 --> 01:07:07,312
Take that position at Stanford.

701
01:07:07,312 --> 01:07:08,980
You complain about that little school

702
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:10,565
but you could go anywhere you want.

703
01:07:10,565 --> 01:07:12,234
I think what I've done has been worthwhile.

704
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:15,362
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

705
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:16,613
I shouldn't have said that.

706
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,951
As much as I dread it, I think I will go back to London.

707
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:22,035
Why do you dread it?

708
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:24,913
When I lived in London last I was young.

709
01:07:24,913 --> 01:07:26,623
I was fresh, I was everything.

710
01:07:27,582 --> 01:07:31,002
Coming to America was such a dream, it was the icing on the cake.

711
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:33,713
Going home is defeat.

712
01:07:34,256 --> 01:07:36,633
None of it really worked out the way I'd planned.

713
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:39,261
Most things don't work out the way people plan.

714
01:07:41,763 --> 01:07:42,889
You're just living in the past.

715
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:44,724
You need to start thinking about your future.

716
01:07:45,475 --> 01:07:48,436
Living in the past is my future.

717
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:51,314
It doesn't have to be yours. You're a man.

718
01:07:53,150 --> 01:07:55,360
And you're a bore tonight.

719
01:07:56,319 --> 01:07:59,614
Can't we just feel sorry for ourselves a little bit longer?

720
01:08:00,448 --> 01:08:01,992
Let's have another drink.

721
01:08:01,992 --> 01:08:03,326
I don't think so. I have to go.

722
01:08:03,326 --> 01:08:04,161
Come on. Walk me out.        Please, please!

723
01:08:04,161 --> 01:08:07,914
Come on, I have to!        No, this was such fun! No.

724
01:08:16,631 --> 01:08:18,341
When will I see you again?

725
01:08:20,385 --> 01:08:23,972
Aren't you going to England?        I'll never do that!

726
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:26,016
It's far too much effort.

727
01:08:26,683 --> 01:08:28,018
Besides,

728
01:08:28,018 --> 01:08:32,189
I don't think Jim would want me to leave you here in LA all alone.

729
01:08:32,522 --> 01:08:34,232
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

730
01:08:34,274 --> 01:08:35,692
I've got all the answers. Remember?

731
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:38,111
What are you doing this weekend?

732
01:08:39,696 --> 01:08:41,781
I think I might just be very quiet.

733
01:08:44,409 --> 01:08:47,662
You never really did take me seriously, did you George?

734
01:08:47,913 --> 01:08:51,291
I tried to Charley. Remember? A long time ago.

735
01:08:52,876 --> 01:08:54,711
It didn't really work out, did it?

736
01:08:57,172 --> 01:08:58,131
No, Charley.

737
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:06,348
Sleep tight.

738
01:09:50,934 --> 01:09:54,271
Patrick, a beer and a packet of Lucky Strike, please.

739
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:39,983
Excuse me.

740
01:10:55,874 --> 01:10:57,042
It's too hot in there.

741
01:10:58,376 --> 01:10:59,127
Yes, it is.

742
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,589
Would you like a cigarette?        No thanks, I don't smoke.

743
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,886
This place is really crowded.        Well, it is Saturday night.

744
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:10,180
It's usually as bad as this.

745
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:12,432
People normally just stop by and pick someone up

746
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:13,934
and then head on down the beach.

747
01:11:14,935 --> 01:11:16,394
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.

748
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,772
I'm surprised the cops don't break it up.

749
01:11:19,314 --> 01:11:22,108
Is it always like that?        Since the war ended.

750
01:11:23,276 --> 01:11:25,570
It's pretty great actually. It's kind of pagan.

751
01:11:27,531 --> 01:11:29,658
I'm Jim.        I'm George.

752
01:11:29,658 --> 01:11:30,617
Pleased to meet you Jim.

753
01:11:30,617 --> 01:11:32,994
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some friends but I can't find them.

754
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:36,122
I just needed to get out of the house

755
01:11:36,122 --> 01:11:38,500
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

756
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:40,502
Do you live hereby?

757
01:11:40,502 --> 01:11:41,461
Canyon.

758
01:11:42,546 --> 01:11:44,422
For how long?        Since 38.

759
01:11:44,422 --> 01:11:46,675
Where are you from?        Colorado.

760
01:11:48,093 --> 01:11:51,805
I really like it here. It's close to beach.

761
01:11:53,056 --> 01:11:54,975
I think I might stay after I'm discharged.

762
01:11:56,143 --> 01:11:59,729
I don't know, maybe I'm a bit of a pagan.

763
01:12:04,109 --> 01:12:05,652
After you.        No.

764
01:12:12,325 --> 01:12:13,076
Sorry.

765
01:12:21,209 --> 01:12:23,545
Well, hello.        Hi.

766
01:12:25,338 --> 01:12:27,048
Do you buy me a drink?

767
01:12:28,884 --> 01:12:30,177
I think I'm taken.

768
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,390
Too bad, too bad.

769
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:39,102
Do you want another beer?

770
01:13:36,993 --> 01:13:40,330
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?

771
01:13:51,174 --> 01:13:52,342
Patrick, cancel that.

772
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:05,856
Well, hello Mr. Potter.

773
01:14:06,857 --> 01:14:07,732
Hello, sir.

774
01:14:09,734 --> 01:14:12,154
What are we drinking?        Scotch.

775
01:14:13,321 --> 01:14:14,156
Okay.

776
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,997
I come here all the time.

777
01:14:22,706 --> 01:14:25,167
I live just around the corner, but then you knew that.

778
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,626
On Camphor Tree Lane.

779
01:14:33,425 --> 01:14:34,759
You're still carrying that around.

780
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:40,140
One must always appreciate life's little gifts.

781
01:14:44,936 --> 01:14:46,313
So, what are you doing here?

782
01:14:47,105 --> 01:14:49,107
Just out for a ride on my bike.        Is that all?

783
01:14:50,192 --> 01:14:51,026
I don't know.

784
01:14:51,443 --> 01:14:52,652
Were you looking for me?

785
01:14:53,737 --> 01:14:55,947
Maybe. I don't know.

786
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:58,575
I feel like my head's stopped up with stuff.

787
01:14:58,575 --> 01:14:59,868
What kind of stuff?

788
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:02,078
Like, the stuff you were talking about today in class.

789
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:03,914
That is definitely not important.

790
01:15:03,914 --> 01:15:06,500
No, it is important. Your class is great.

791
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:10,712
But somehow we always seem to get stuck talking about the past.

792
01:15:11,338 --> 01:15:12,923
The past just doesn't matter to me.

793
01:15:13,256 --> 01:15:16,843
The present?        I can't wait for the present to be over.

794
01:15:17,552 --> 01:15:18,929
It's a total drag.

795
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:22,015
Well, tonight is the exception.

796
01:15:23,642 --> 01:15:24,392
What?

797
01:15:25,393 --> 01:15:28,688
Tonight, yes! The present, no!

798
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:30,524
Let's drink to tonight.

799
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:31,942
Tonight.

800
01:15:34,778 --> 01:15:36,863
So if the past doesn't matter and the present is a total drag.

801
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:37,948
What about the future?

802
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:41,743
What future? Cuba might just blow us up.

803
01:15:42,536 --> 01:15:43,870
Death is the future.

804
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,331
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be depressing.

805
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:48,625
It's not depressing. It's not depressing, it's true.

806
01:15:48,667 --> 01:15:51,419
It may not be your immediate future but it's what we all share.

807
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:53,797
Death is the future.

808
01:15:55,048 --> 01:15:56,258
You're right, I guess.

809
01:15:56,258 --> 01:15:59,219
If one is not enjoying one's present there isn't a great deal to...

810
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:01,096
...suggest that the future should be any better.

811
01:16:01,972 --> 01:16:03,431
Yeah, I've thought that before.

812
01:16:04,349 --> 01:16:07,769
But the thing is you just never know.

813
01:16:08,728 --> 01:16:09,646
Look at tonight.

814
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:15,485
Actually...

815
01:16:16,278 --> 01:16:18,238
...I feel really alone most of the time.

816
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:20,907
You do?        Yeah.

817
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:23,076
I've always felt this way.

818
01:16:23,535 --> 01:16:26,246
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.

819
01:16:26,955 --> 01:16:28,165
And while we're here

820
01:16:28,415 --> 01:16:31,668
we are absolutely, completely sealed in our own bodies.

821
01:16:32,419 --> 01:16:33,461
Really weird.

822
01:16:35,046 --> 01:16:36,840
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.

823
01:16:37,507 --> 01:16:40,594
We can only experience the outside world

824
01:16:40,802 --> 01:16:42,637
through our own slanted perception of it.

825
01:16:44,598 --> 01:16:46,433
Who knows what you're really like?

826
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,852
I just see what I think you're like.

827
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:51,605
I'm exactly what I appear to be.

828
01:16:54,107 --> 01:16:55,317
If you look closely.

829
01:17:02,115 --> 01:17:04,367
You know the only thing that has made the whole thing worthwhile...

830
01:17:06,786 --> 01:17:07,746
...has been those...

831
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:09,456
...few times

832
01:17:09,456 --> 01:17:12,709
that I've been able to really, truly connect with another human being.

833
01:17:16,755 --> 01:17:18,423
I had a hunch about you, sir.

834
01:17:18,882 --> 01:17:20,634
You did?        Yes, sir.

835
01:17:21,301 --> 01:17:23,804
I had a hunch you might be a real romantic.

836
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:32,521
You know, everyone keeps telling you that...

837
01:17:32,521 --> 01:17:35,398
...when you're older, that you'll have all this experience.

838
01:17:35,398 --> 01:17:36,983
Like it's some great thing.

839
01:17:37,651 --> 01:17:38,652
That's a load of shit.

840
01:17:39,152 --> 01:17:41,321
I think I've actually just gotten sillier and sillier.

841
01:17:41,613 --> 01:17:43,406
Really?        Absolutely.

842
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:46,910
So, all your experience is useless.

843
01:17:48,203 --> 01:17:49,454
No, I wouldn't say that.

844
01:17:50,872 --> 01:17:52,165
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:

845
01:17:52,165 --> 01:17:53,708
Experience is not what happens to a man.

846
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,002
It is what a man does with what happens to him.

847
01:17:58,755 --> 01:18:00,674
Let's go swimming.        Okay.

848
01:18:02,008 --> 01:18:04,636
What?        It was a test.

849
01:18:04,845 --> 01:18:07,055
I thought you were bluffing about being silly so...

850
01:18:07,722 --> 01:18:10,100
...I said to myself I'll suggest

851
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,853
doing something completely outrageous.

852
01:18:12,936 --> 01:18:15,313
And if he resists, if he even hesitates

853
01:18:15,355 --> 01:18:16,940
then I know he's full of shit.

854
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:20,527
Well, I wasn't. Were you?

855
01:18:22,237 --> 01:18:23,572
Hell, no!

856
01:18:41,548 --> 01:18:43,758
Come on sir. I'll help you down.

857
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:46,511
Let's go.

858
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:35,685
Come on, sir.

859
01:20:09,261 --> 01:20:10,011
Sir?

860
01:20:11,012 --> 01:20:11,972
Sir?

861
01:20:22,649 --> 01:20:24,067
That's enough for now, sir.

862
01:20:25,777 --> 01:20:28,446
I'm fine.        I'm cold. Come on.

863
01:20:42,002 --> 01:20:43,670
Can we go back to your place, sir?

864
01:20:44,379 --> 01:20:46,673
Of course. Where else?

865
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:49,968
Where else.        Are you out of your mind?

866
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:54,014
What's the matter?        You can't get home like that!

867
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:55,807
We're invisible, don't you know that?

868
01:20:58,018 --> 01:21:00,645
You know sir, they ought not to let you out on your own.

869
01:21:00,896 --> 01:21:02,689
You're liable to get into real trouble.

870
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:04,441
I excel at it.

871
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:06,610
Your forehead is bleeding.

872
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:33,929
The bathroom is just down the hall if you would like to take a shower.

873
01:21:35,514 --> 01:21:37,182
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?

874
01:21:37,224 --> 01:21:39,976
I'm fine. I'm English. We like to be cold and wet.

875
01:21:41,144 --> 01:21:43,313
First, I think that we need to take care of that cut, sir.

876
01:21:43,313 --> 01:21:44,815
Do you have any band-aids?

877
01:21:48,944 --> 01:21:52,405
Going camping, sir?        I'm fine, really.

878
01:21:53,532 --> 01:21:55,242
Stay there. I'll be right back.

879
01:22:39,703 --> 01:22:40,495
Sit up.

880
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:44,124
Tilt your head back.

881
01:23:09,691 --> 01:23:11,860
Well sir, I'm afraid this time you don't have...

882
01:23:11,902 --> 01:23:14,362
...the excuse of mescaline to explain your band-aid.

883
01:23:16,907 --> 01:23:19,034
I think we should get you out of those wet clothes.

884
01:23:22,204 --> 01:23:23,038
Yes, sir.

885
01:24:56,506 --> 01:24:58,467
You're not too cold?        I'm great.

886
01:24:59,676 --> 01:25:02,846
Would you like a drink?        A beer, sir. If you have one.

887
01:25:02,846 --> 01:25:05,182
I'm afraid that's all we have.

888
01:25:05,765 --> 01:25:06,933
Two beers coming up.

889
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:22,866
You live here all by yourself, sir?

890
01:25:22,866 --> 01:25:23,617
I do now.

891
01:25:24,493 --> 01:25:26,995
I used to share this place with a friend. He was an architect.

892
01:25:27,704 --> 01:25:31,166
Man, guys my age dream about the kind of setup you've got here.

893
01:25:31,166 --> 01:25:33,960
I mean, what more can you want?

894
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,297
You get to be left alone and come and go as you please.

895
01:25:39,341 --> 01:25:41,176
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?

896
01:25:41,176 --> 01:25:43,345
What's the matter, sir? Don't you believe me?

897
01:25:43,887 --> 01:25:45,931
If you're so keen on the idea living by yourself...

898
01:25:45,931 --> 01:25:47,682
...where does Lois fit into this plan?

899
01:25:48,183 --> 01:25:51,061
Lois? What's she got to do with anything?

900
01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:54,022
I got the impression that you and she were together.

901
01:25:57,234 --> 01:26:00,946
Not really. She is kind of cool and...

902
01:26:01,071 --> 01:26:02,405
...we're good friends but...

903
01:26:05,242 --> 01:26:08,578
I think what you really want to ask me is if we sleep together.

904
01:26:09,704 --> 01:26:11,748
And do you?        We did. Once.

905
01:26:11,748 --> 01:26:13,124
Why only once?

906
01:26:13,834 --> 01:26:15,961
I didn't say only once, I said once.

907
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:19,756
Come on, the last thing I want to talk about right now is Lois.

908
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:21,591
What time is it?

909
01:26:24,511 --> 01:26:26,138
My watch seems to have stopped.

910
01:26:33,687 --> 01:26:35,313
Do you want me to go?

911
01:26:36,231 --> 01:26:38,483
You must be kidding. Go, get us another beer.

912
01:26:40,485 --> 01:26:41,653
Is that an order, sir?

913
01:26:44,114 --> 01:26:45,365
You're damn right it is.

914
01:26:57,002 --> 01:26:58,044
Pathetic.

915
01:27:00,297 --> 01:27:01,465
Did you say something, sir?

916
01:27:06,303 --> 01:27:07,471
Why are you here?

917
01:27:10,182 --> 01:27:15,479
Why did you get to the office and ask secretary for my address?

918
01:27:17,606 --> 01:27:21,985
I just wanted to see you someplace other than school.

919
01:27:23,069 --> 01:27:23,904
Why?

920
01:27:27,699 --> 01:27:29,326
Sometimes I think I'm crazy

921
01:27:29,367 --> 01:27:31,578
cause I see things so differently than everyone else.

922
01:27:32,913 --> 01:27:34,289
I feel like I can talk to you.

923
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:39,169
To be honest sir, I was also worried about you today.

924
01:27:44,090 --> 01:27:44,841
Me?

925
01:27:46,259 --> 01:27:47,511
What's to be worried about?

926
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:49,971
I'm fine.

927
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:00,607
I'm...

928
01:28:02,484 --> 01:28:03,443
I'm fine.

929
01:30:47,858 --> 01:30:52,737
A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity.

930
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:57,242
When for a few brief seconds...

931
01:30:58,201 --> 01:31:00,495
...the silence drowns out the noise...

932
01:31:00,537 --> 01:31:03,915
...and I can feel rather than think.

933
01:31:04,875 --> 01:31:07,210
And things seem so sharp...

934
01:31:08,003 --> 01:31:10,046
And the world seems so fresh...

935
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:14,426
...as though it had all just come into existence.

936
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:37,240
I can never make these moments last.

937
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:39,493
I cling to them...

938
01:31:39,493 --> 01:31:41,244
...but like everything they fade.

939
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:45,665
I've lived my live on these moments.

940
01:31:47,501 --> 01:31:49,169
They pull me back to the present...

941
01:31:51,546 --> 01:31:52,172
...and I realize that

942
01:31:52,172 --> 01:31:56,676
everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.

943
01:34:16,566 --> 01:34:20,153
And just like that it came.
