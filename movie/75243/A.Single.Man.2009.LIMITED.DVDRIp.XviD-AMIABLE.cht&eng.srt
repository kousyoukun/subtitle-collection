00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,440
1962年 11月30日 星期五
Friday, 30 November, 1962

7
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,060
起床有"想要"和"已經"之分
Waking up begins with saying "am" and "now".

8
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,320
珍妮弗 別讓我再說第二遍
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.

9
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,370
八個月以來 夢醒時分總是心痛無比
For the past eight months waking up has actually hurt.

10
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,240
我依然存活的殘酷意識 還在慢慢滲透
The cold realization that I'm still here slowly sets in.

11
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,740
我從未真正喜歡過醒來的感覺
I was never teribly fond of waking up.

12
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,690
我也無法像吉姆一樣
I was never one to jump out of bed

13
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,180
微笑著起來迎接新的一天
and greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

14
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,200
見他一大早就那麼開心 我甚至想過給他一拳
I used to want to punch him sometimes in the morning he was so happy.

15
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,930
我常跟他說
I always used to tell him that

16
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,090
只有愚人才會笑著迎接新一天
only fools greet the day with a smile...

17
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,270
...只有愚人才會對現實的一切置若惘然
...that only fools possibly escape the simple truth.

18
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,290
而現在 惘然都已經不復存在
That now isn't simply now.

19
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,810
就像一個冷酷的提示 日復一日
It's a cold reminder. One day later than yesterday.

20
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,350
年復一年
One year later than last year.

21
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,900
終有一天 它會來到你的身邊
And that sooner or later it will come.

22
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,360
他總是笑而不語 輕吻我的臉頰
He used to laugh at me and then give me kiss on the cheek.

23
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,460
每天早上 我要花上一段時間打扮成喬治
It takes time in the morning for me to become George.

24
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,390
我需要時間來適應
The time to adjust to

25
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,340
喬治的形象和他應有的表現
what is expected of George and how he is to behave.

26
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,820
待到我穿著得體 一切光彩煥然...
By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish...

27
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,080
...展現給人們一個不茍言笑
...on the now slightly stiff

28
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,260
卻栩栩如生的喬治的時候...
but quite perfect George...

29
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,530
...我就知道自己該扮演哪個角色了...
...I know fully what part I'm supposed to play

30
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,590
注視著鏡中自己的面龐
Looking in the mirror staring back at me

31
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,150
可以說不是一張面孔...
isn't so much as a face...

32
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,650
...而是困境折射出來的表情
...as the expression of a predicament.

33
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,020
熬過這混渾渾噩噩的一天吧
Just get through the goddamn day.

34
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,770
雖然有些戲劇化...
A bit melodramatic, I guess.

35
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,430
但說真的...
But then again...

36
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,570
...我的心已經受傷了
...my heart has been broken.

37
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,080
我覺得自己在慢慢下沉 慢慢被淹沒...
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...

38
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,710
...無法呼吸
...can't breathe.

39
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
你不發表點見解嗎?
Aren't you going to say something?

40
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,020
開玩笑嗎?這簡直不可思議
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.

41
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,350
你要幹嘛?
What are you doing?

42
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,220
別這樣 別
Just stop it. Stop it.

43
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,300
我覺得你還沒準備好
I don't think that you're quite ready for

44
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,930
住在玻璃房子裡 (諺語 公佈於眾)
life in a glass house.

45
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,510
那就拉窗簾咯 老頭子
Drapes, old man.

46
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,150
是你一直都說我們是隱形的
You're the one who is always saying that we are invisible.

47
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,910
我不是這個意思
That's not exactly what I meant.

48
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,810
人生頭一回 我覺得未來如此渺遠
For the first time in my life I can't see my future.

49
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,920
每天都在懵懂的迷霧中悄然度過
Every day goes by in a haze.

50
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,730
而今天 我決定要過得迥然不同
But today I have decided will be different.

51
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,640
總算打來了 今天一直都在下雨
Finally. You know it's been raining here all day.

52
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,210
我就躲在屋子裡 等著你打電話來
I've been trapped in this house waiting for you to call.

53
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,710
抱歉 我是不是打錯了
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

54
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,010
我要找喬治·福克納先生
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.

55
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,880
不好意思 我在等別人電話
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.

56
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,500
沒錯 您並...
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...

57
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,340
...沒有打錯 有什麼事情嗎?
...correct number. How may I help you?

58
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,140
我是哈羅德·阿克利
This is Harold Ackerley.

59
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,720
我是吉姆的表哥
I'm Jim's cousin.

60
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,330
哦 你好啊 晚上好 阿克利先生
Of course. Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.

61
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,120
恐怕我有些噩耗要告訴您
I'm afraid I'm calling with some bad news.

62
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,150
發生了一起車禍
There has been a car accident.

63
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,430
車禍?
An accident?

64
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,640
最近這裡一直下雪 道路比較滑
There has been a lot of snow here lately and the roads have been icy.

65
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,160
吉姆在進城的路上 剎車失靈了
On his way into town, Jim lost control of his car.

66
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,790
結果 一下子人就沒了
It was instantaneous apparently.

67
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,860
是昨天晚上發生的 但他父母不想通知您
It happened late yesterday, but his parents didn't want to call you.

68
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,490
我知道了
I see.

69
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,050
事實上 我現在也是背著他們打給你的
In fact, they don't that I'm calling you now.

70
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,040
因為我覺得應該讓你知道
But I thought that you should know.

71
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,340
謝謝你
Thank you.

72
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,600
我知道這對您打擊很大 我們都很悲痛
I know this must be quite a shock. It was for all of us.

73
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,460
是啊 沒錯
Yes, indeed.

74
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,190
要舉行葬禮嗎?      葬禮安排在後天
Will there be a service?        The day after tomorrow.

75
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,850
那我恐怕要放下電話...
Well, I suppose I should get off the phone...

76
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,920
...趕緊訂一班飛機
...and book a plane flight.

77
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,010
葬禮僅限家人
The service is just for family.

78
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,060
家人啊 當然
For family, of course.

79
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,480
那麼 謝謝你能通知我
Well, thank you for calling.

80
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,140
阿克利先生?      什麼事?
Mr. Ackerley?        Yes?

81
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,670
我想問問那兩條狗怎麼處理呢?
May I ask what happened to the dogs?

82
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,590
狗?
Dogs?

83
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,220
有一條跟著他的狗也死了 還有另外一條嗎?
There was a dog with him but he died. Was there another one?

84
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,180
嗯 還有一條小母狗
Yes, there was a small female.

85
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,380
這我就不清楚了 很抱歉
I don't know, I'm sorry.

86
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,760
我沒聽誰提起過另外那條狗
I haven't heard anyone mentioning another dog.

87
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,110
再次謝謝您能打來告訴我
Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.

88
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,540
再見 福克納先生
Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.

89
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,400
喂 夏莉
Hello, Charley.

90
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,960
你怎麼會知道是我?
How did you know it was me?

91
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,710
夏洛特 不會有別人在早晨8點之前打電話來的
Charlotte, nobody else calls me before eight in the morning.

92
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,590
不會是擾了你的清夢吧? 你聽起來不大高興
I didn't call too early, did I? You sound grumpy.

93
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,730
不 我只是有些頭痛
No, I have a headache.

94
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,440
我本來要給你打電話的
Listen, I was going to call you actually.

95
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,300
今晚的事我改主意還來得及嗎
Is it too late to change my mind about tonight.

96
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,420
來得及啊 怎麼來不及
No, of course not.

97
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,910
我只是一周都沒見你而已
I haven't seen you all week.

98
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,460
我都快想死你了      我知道 實在抱歉
I'm dying for a dose of you.        I know, I'm sorry.

99
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,940
那就這麼定了 今晚見
So great, I'll see you tonight.

100
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,740
我先掛了 上班要遲到了
I have to run. I'm late for the work.

101
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,610
等會兒到了學校再打給你
I'll call you later from school.

102
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,660
好的 晚上見
Alright, I see you then.

103
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,970
再見 小淘氣      再見 大哥哥
Bye, kiddo.        Bye, old man.

104
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,420
早上好 喬治先生
Good morning, Mr. George.

105
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,420
先生 您今天氣色不大好啊
Sir, you don't look so good today.

106
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,010
愛爾瓦 早安 我沒事 只是沒睡好而已
Good morning, Alva. No, I didn't sleep very well.

107
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,720
你今早忘記把麵包從冰箱裡拿出來了
You forgot to take the bread out of the freezer this morning.

108
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,130
那樣才能保鮮啊
It stays fresh that way.

109
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,060
不過今天早上有點兒太鮮了
It was a little too fresh this morning.

110
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,020
我桌上有幾張紙...
There are some papers laid out on my desk...

111
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,510
...放在那兒就好 不要動
...which need to stay there. Please don't move them.

112
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,600
抱歉我的鋼筆墨水染到床單上了
I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.

113
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,880
沒關係的 先生
It's okay, sir.

114
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,860
愛爾瓦?      是的 先生?
Alva?        Yes, sir?

115
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,570
你真好 謝謝你
Thank you, you're a wonderful.

116
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,750
正如政府承諾的
This government, as promised,

117
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,590
他們會一如既往地對蘇軍在
has maintained the closest surveillance...

118
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,780
...古巴島上的軍事集結進行密切監視
...of the Soviet military buildup on the Island of Cuba.

119
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,200
過去幾周以來的確鑿證據...
Within the past week unmistakable evidence...

120
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,730
...讓我們有理由相信...
...has established the fact...

121
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,880
福克納教授?      怎麼了?
Professor Falconer?        Yes?

122
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,170
今早有個學生問我要了你的住址
There was a student here this morning asking for your address.

123
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,160
我的住址?
My address?

124
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,290
你給他了嗎?      是的 先生
Did you give it to him?        Yes, sir.

125
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,390
我給了
I did.

126
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,530
希望不會給您添麻煩
I hope that's okay.

127
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,290
之後我意識到也許不該給的 可他人真的很好
I realize that I probably shouldn't have but he was very nice.

128
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,730
所以我覺得他不會...
Before I knew it he...

129
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,740
你的髮型非常漂亮 很襯你
Your hair looks great up like that. I really fits suits you.

130
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,530
你總是那麼美艷動人...
You always look so beautiful...

131
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,570
...青春活潑...
...really fresh...

132
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,320
你笑起來很甜
You have such a lovely smile.

133
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,720
艾佩芝? (香水品牌)     先生?
Arpege?        Sir?

134
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,780
真的很漂亮
Really beautiful.

135
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,480
...一系列具有攻擊性的導彈基地
...that a series of offensive missile sites...

136
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,290
先生們 早上好      喬治 早上好
Good morning, Don.        Good morning, George.

137
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,950
早上好 喬治
Good morning, George.

138
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,010
早上好 格蘭特
Good morning, Grant.

139
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,240
你氣色不大好 怎麼了?
You look awful. What have you been doing?

140
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,970
格蘭特 看看你的周圍
Look around you, Grant.

141
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,960
大多數學生都只圖畢業後能去公司裡工作
Most of these students aspire to nothing more than corporate job...

142
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,650
...然後生一個
...and a desire to raise

143
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,670
喝著可樂 看著電視的小屁孩...
coke-drinking, TV-watching children...

144
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,890
...過不了幾年
...who as soon as they can speak

145
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
孩子就開始大唱廣告歌曲...
start chanting TV jingles...

146
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,900
...拿著錘子搞破壞了
...and smashing things with hammers.

147
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,710
喬治 你今天怎麼不大對勁
You're really scaring me today, George.

148
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,450
別跟我說 你和這些個學生相處很融洽
Don't tell me. You have easy time with these students.

149
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,540
我發現他們看我
I found them staring at me

150
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,380
像看一個喋喋不休的老先生一樣...
in a kind of bovine stupor...

151
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,120
...就好像我是用外語教書一般
...as if I were lecturing in a foreign language.

152
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,090
這也提醒了我們果然不是一個世界的人
Remind me why we shouldn't all just be annihilated.

153
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,050
你怎麼對什麼都一哂置之
You seem to think this is all a joke.

154
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,440
我們當前的世界 正瀰漫著核武器帶來的恐懼
We're living in a world where nuclear war is a real threat.

155
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,480
我不明白為什麼你毫不關心
I don't understand how that doesn't concern you.

156
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,510
你是認真的 對吧?
You're serious, aren't you?

157
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,270
是的 我很認真
Yes, I'm serious.

158
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,260
喬治 你到底讀沒讀
George did you even read

159
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
我給你的關於防空洞的文章?
the article I gave you on bomb shelters?

160
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,400
我們基本上談妥了 現在找了三個承包商...
Our is almost done. We had 3 contractors work on it...

161
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,000
...所以就不會有人知道這些
...so none of them know what we've got.

162
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,420
我會依照地形而建
I'm having the outside of it landscaped

163
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,920
這樣就神不知鬼不覺了
so no one will that it's there.

164
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,620
是嗎?
Really?

165
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,680
如果傳出去說你的防空洞比別人的好...
If word gets out that you've got a better shelter...

166
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,900
...那等到戰亂爆發 人們就一股腦地擠過來
...then everyone will try to get in when something happens.

167
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,950
所以呢?
So?

168
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,490
蘇聯的導彈扔過來
There will be no time for sentiment

169
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,480
就沒有時間留給你多愁善感了
when the Russians fire a missile at us.

170
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,360
格蘭特 倘若這世界沒有時間多愁善感...
If it's going to be a world with no time for sentiment Grant...

171
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,890
...那麼這也不會是我想要生活的世界
...the it's not a world that I want to live in.

172
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,040
"夏去夏來天鵝死"
After Many a Summer

173
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,820
(英國作家赫胥黎在1939年所寫小說)
Dies the Swan.

174
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,970
想必大家...
I think you've all...

175
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,640
...都讀過
...read the Huxley novel

176
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,790
我三周前佈置的這本赫胥黎的小說了吧
I assigned more than three weeks ago?

177
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,340
題目與作品有何關聯?
How does the title relate to our story?

178
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,440
蒙先生 請講
Yes, Mr. Mong.

179
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,680
並無關聯(赫胥黎引用"泰索尼斯"中的詩句)
It doesn't.

180
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,290
講述了一個富翁
It's about a rich guy

181
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,270
覺得自己已是垂暮 配不上那個女孩...
who's too afraid that he's too old for this girl...

182
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,910
...而他認為年輕的男人...
...and thinks that a young guy...

183
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,880
拉斯
Russ.

184
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,020
拉斯?
Russ?

185
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,760
請講 赫希先生
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

186
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,730
先生 在第79頁 普羅普特先生說道...
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...

187
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,430
...聖經中最愚蠢的章節就是
...the stupidest text in the Bible is

188
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,470
"他們無故地恨我"(約翰福音15:25)
they hated me without a cause.

189
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,740
這是為納粹對猶太人的憎惡開脫嗎?
Does that mean the Nazis were right to hate the Jews?

190
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,040
難道赫胥黎是一名反猶分子嗎?      不
Is Huxley an anti-Semite?        No.

191
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,040
不 赫胥黎先生並非反猶
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.

192
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,850
而且 納粹對猶太的民族仇恨是天大的錯誤
Of course, the Nazis were wrong to hate the Jews.

193
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,970
但他們對猶太人的恨並非無緣無故
But their hating the Jews was not without a cause.

194
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,560
只是這原因並不真實存在
It's just that the cause wasn't real.

195
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,890
憎恨的原因源於人們的臆想
The cause was imagined.

196
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,990
真正的原因是恐懼
The cause was fear.

197
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,760
咱們先暫且不要談論猶太的問題
Let's leave the Jews out o this just for a moment.

198
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,490
想想另一個少數派群體 那種...
Let's think of another minority. One that...

199
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,270
那種被人視而不見的少數派
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

200
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,790
其實這世上有著各種各樣的少數派
There are all sorts of minorities,

201
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,810
譬如金髮的人...
blondes for example...

202
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,890
...長著雀斑的人
...or people with freckles.

203
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,550
但是只有在少數派對多數派構成威脅時...
But a minority is only thought of as one...

204
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,800
...他們才被稱之為少數派
...when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority.

205
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,100
是真實的 還是臆想的
A real threat or an imagined one.

206
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,770
這當中便產生了恐懼
And therein lies the fear.

207
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,180
倘若少數派不為人知被人忽略
If the minority is somehow invisible...

208
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,790
...那麼恐懼便無限放大
...and the fear is much greater.

209
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,410
恐懼的存在 導致少數派被迫害
That fear is why the minority is persecuted.

210
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,000
所以 你們看原因總是存在的
So, you see there always is a cause.

211
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,190
這原因便是恐懼
The cause is fear.

212
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,020
少數派其實就是普通人
Minorities are just people.

213
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,150
如我們一樣的普通人
People like us.

214
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,650
感覺好像把你們講糊塗了
I can see that I've lost you a bit.

215
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,350
這樣吧 咱們今天先不講赫胥黎了...
So tell you what? We're gonna forget about Mr. Huxley today...

216
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,850
...我們來探討一下恐懼
...and we're gonna talk about fear.

217
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,190
畢竟...恐懼才是我們真正的敵人
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.

218
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,920
恐懼正在吞噬著我們的世界
Fear is taking over our world.

219
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,750
恐懼被用來操控著我們的社會
Fear is being used as a tool of manipulation in our society.

220
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,110
這就是政客們玩弄的伎倆
It's how politicians peddle policy.

221
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,710
這也就是麥迪遜大道上總有人賣給我們
It's how Madison Avenue sells us

222
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,140
不需要的東西
things that we don't need.

223
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,280
仔細想想看
Think about it.

224
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,350
對被襲的恐懼
Fear of being attacked.

225
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,160
恐懼著某個暗處隱藏著共產主義者
Fear of that there are communists lurking around every corner.

226
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,800
恐懼著那些和我們生活習慣截然不同的...
Fear of that some little Caribbean country...

227
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,250
...中美洲國家會對我們
...that doesn't believe in our way of life

228
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,390
造成威脅(古巴危機)
poses a threat to us.

229
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,770
恐懼著黑人的文化將會統領全世界
Fear that black culture may take over the world.

230
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,150
擔心貓王的屁股哪天會晃掉下來
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.

231
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,930
事實上 這個很有可能成為現實
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.

232
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,550
恐懼著口臭會破壞我們的友誼
Fear that our bad breath might ruin our friendships.

233
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,280
恐懼著韶華逝去孑然一身
Fear of growing old and being alone.

234
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,800
恐懼著自己一無是處 無人問津
The of that we're useless and that no one cares what we have to say.

235
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,600
週末愉快
Have a good weekend.

236
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,510
先生! 我能跟你談談嗎?
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?

237
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,550
為什麼你之前沒有這樣跟我們講過呢?
Why don't you always talk to us like that?

238
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,170
我怕你們不愛聽
I don't think it went over very well.

239
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,890
老師 我經常會有對週遭的恐懼
Man, fear of things gets to me all the time.

240
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,890
但你無法跟別人傾訴 否則會讓別人覺得你很傻
But you can't talk about it with anyone or you just sound like a fool.

241
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,540
連跟洛伊斯都不能傾訴嗎?
You can't even talk about it with Lois?

242
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,710
我覺得她什麼都不怕
I don't think she's afraid of anything.

243
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,230
每個人都有恐懼的東西 肯尼
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.

244
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,850
先生 那你怕什麼?
What are you afraid of, sir?

245
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,430
車
Cars.

246
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,570
你住在洛杉磯 怎麼能怕車呢?
How can you live in Los Angeles and be afraid of cars?

247
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,770
可能不能吧
Maybe you can't.

248
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,840
有時候 我內心的恐懼會讓我慌張無力
Sometimes my fear of things can almost paralyze me.

249
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,030
內心糾結緊張
It's like I get really panic stricken

250
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,020
生怕自己的感情會突然爆發
and I feel like I might explode or something.

251
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,200
我能問您個私人問題嗎 先生?
May I ask you a personal question, sir?

252
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,140
隨便
If you like.

253
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,270
你曾經嗨過嗎?
Do you ever get high?

254
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,040
你覺得我都多大歲數了?
How old do I look to you?

255
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
那您之前吸過毒嗎?
Have you ever taken any drugs?

256
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,110
當然 肯尼
Of course, Kenny.

257
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,950
譬如什麼?
Like what?

258
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,970
波特先生 我覺得
I don't feel I should be discussing

259
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,260
在校園討論這事情有點不合適吧
this with you on campus Mr. Potter.

260
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,330
這是我解壓的唯一方式
It's the only way I get by sometimes.

261
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,910
那您試過迷幻藥嗎?
Have you ever tried mescaline?

262
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,670
倒不是我的首選
Not my drug of choice.

263
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,680
有次吸完 我把半邊眉毛都刮掉了
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once on mescaline.

264
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,170
看上去不好看
Not a good look for me.

265
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,590
先生?      我對著鏡子
Sir?        I looked in the mirror.

266
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,690
吸完迷幻藥看鏡子是個錯誤至極的選擇
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.

267
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,440
我感覺我的眉毛要把整個臉都吞噬了
I decided that my eyebrows were taking over my face.

268
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,770
所以我就刮掉了一半
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.

269
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,790
我等眉毛長出來的時候
I wore a band-aid over my eye

270
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,530
被迫貼了六周的創可貼
for about six weeks while my brow grew back.

271
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,370
非常尷尬
Very embarrassing.

272
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
打那以後你就再沒碰過了?
You didn't take it again after that?

273
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,510
肯尼 你有聽我說話嗎?
Kenny, have you been listening to me?

274
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,510
我把眉毛都剃掉了啊
I shaved off my eyebrow.

275
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,430
我只是想要體驗一下 波特先生
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,

276
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,100
又不是想當台上的小丑
not a career on stage.

277
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,040
先生 你什麼時候想要嗨一下的話 我這兒有貨
If you ever want to get high sir, I usually have some dope.

278
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,940
你還真是瘋了
You're really mad aren't you?

279
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,320
抱歉 先生
I'm sorry, sir.

280
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,840
或許這種交談讓你覺得不適
I guess you don't feel very comfortable talking like this.

281
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,110
此話怎講?
What makes you say that?

282
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,600
洛伊斯覺得你過於小心謹慎了 就像今早...
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey. Like this morning...

283
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,430
...你不動聲色地聽
...when you were listening to

284
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,610
我們高談闊論赫胥黎
all that crap we were talking about Huxley.

285
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,920
也不是所有人啊
Well, not all of you.

286
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,780
我記得你不是沒有開口嗎
I didn't notice you open your mouth once.

287
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,990
因為我在注視您
I was watching you.

288
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,590
你總是先讓我們發表見解
You let us ramble on and on

289
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
然後你再直言不諱地解釋
and then you straighten us out.

290
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,200
你卻從未主動告訴過我們你所認為的一切
But you never really tell us everything you know about something.

291
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,340
或許在一定程度上 你說得沒錯
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.

292
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,390
但這並不是我故意謹慎
It's not that I want to be cagey.

293
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,450
只是我真的無法將所有都放開談論
It's just that I can't really discuss things completely openly...

294
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,170
...尤其是在學校
...at school.

295
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,760
有人會誤會的
Someone would misunderstand.

296
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,150
就像我今天試過了 反響不是很好啊
I tried that today. It didn't really work out.

297
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,590
你是想來買什麼嗎 先生?
What was it you wanted to get, sir?

298
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,850
沒什麼 我是剛好要去院長辦公室
Nothing. I was on my way to the dean's office.

299
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,210
所以你走了這麼長的路就是為了跟我講話咯?
You mean you walked all the way down here just to talk to me?

300
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,140
是啊      那麼...
Why not?        Well...

301
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,170
先生 我覺得我應該好好答謝你才是了
I think you deserve something for that, sir.

302
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,390
看看吧 選一個 先生
Here sir, take your pick.

303
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,450
我送給您      謝謝
It's on me.        Thank you.

304
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,340
我還以為你會選藍色
I thought you'd probably pick blue.

305
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
為什麼是藍色?
Why blue?

306
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,910
藍色不是代表著靈性嗎?
Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?

307
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
為什麼你覺得我會有靈性?
What makes you think I'm spiritual?

308
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,580
你呢? 紅色?
And you? Red?

309
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,160
紅色代表什麼?      那可太多了
What is red stand for?        A lot of things.

310
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,820
憤怒 慾望
Rage, lust.

311
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,210
開玩笑吧啊?
No kidding?

312
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,040
那麼 先生 我...
Well sir, I...

313
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,210
咱們再會啊
I guess I see you around.

314
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,330
喂?
Hello?

315
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,860
小淘氣 你在幹嘛呢啊?
What are you up to, kiddo?

316
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,310
正想要讀本書 你今天過得如何啊?
Just trying to finish up a book. How's your day going?

317
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,220
不錯
Fine.

318
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,540
我剛好要下班了
I was just leaving school

319
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,500
想問問你今晚需不需要帶點東西
and wanted to know if you needed anything for tonight.

320
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,960
謝謝 你可真貼心
Thanks, you're sweet.

321
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,190
不過我好像不缺什麼
But I think I'm all set.

322
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,470
你如果能...
Be a darling and...

323
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,590
...買點杜松子酒就更好了 唐桂來牌的吧
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.

324
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,240
我喜歡瓶子的顏色
I love the color of the bottle.

325
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,210
你是喜歡瓶子裡邊的東西 你想要我幾點到?
You love what's in it. What time do you want me?

326
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,770
要是方便的話 7點鐘最好了
7 would be great if that's ok with you.

327
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,950
那好 到時見了
Perfect. I'll see you then.

328
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,040
到時見 再見了 喬
I'll see you then. Bye, Geo.

329
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,050
再見 小淘氣
Bye, kiddo.

330
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,260
很美
Beautiful.

331
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,490
波特先生 什麼事?
Yes, Mr. Potter?

332
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,970
您要去哪兒嗎 先生?
Are you going somewhere, sir?

333
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,840
人們開車不都是為了去哪兒嗎?
That is usually why people get into their cars.

334
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,070
不 我是說 你是要去度假或是什麼嗎?
No, I mean are you going on vacation or something?

335
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,850
什麼?
What?

336
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,630
我看您把辦公室都清理乾淨了?
I saw you cleaning out your office.

337
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,160
肯尼 你到底想要幹嘛?
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?

338
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,930
我只是想說
I was just hoping that perhaps

339
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,320
找個時間 咱們可以喝一杯
we could get together for a drink or something sometime.

340
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,290
為什麼這麼說?
Why is that?

341
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,880
我也不清楚 先生
I don't know, sir.

342
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,570
可能我覺得你會喜歡這樣 而且...
Because I think you might like it. And...

343
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,380
...感覺您現在需要一個朋友的陪伴
...because you seem as though you could use a friend.

344
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,740
哦 是嗎?      是的 先生 您需要
Oh really?        Yes, sir. You do.

345
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,600
或許你說得對
They may be right.

346
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,410
下次找機會吧 我趕時間
It will have to be another time. I'm late.

347
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,950
不過謝謝你的誠摯邀請
But thank you for the invitation.

348
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,680
也謝謝你今早的那番話
And thank you for the talk earlier.

349
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,930
別再碰迷幻藥了
And stay away from the mescaline.

350
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,410
您好 福克納先生
Hello, Mr. Falconer.

351
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,540
嗯 你好嗎?      很好 先生
Hello. How are you today?        I'm fine, sir.

352
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,890
您需要拿保險箱出來嗎?      是的
Do you need to get into your box?        Yes, I do.

353
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,100
請跟我來
Follow me.

354
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,840
給您 先生
Here you are, sir.

355
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,860
麻煩請您在這裡簽名...
If you could please sign here...

356
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,500
謝謝      謝謝
Thank you.        Thank you.

357
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,760
跟我講講你那朋友 夏洛特
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

358
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,650
你都想知道什麼?
What would you like to know?

359
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,010
我也不知道 聽起來你們關係很親密
I don't know. You seem very intimate I guess.

360
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,900
感覺你們之前曾經是戀人
Like you were once together or something.

361
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,930
你沒跟她睡過嗎?      睡過
You haven't slept with her, have you?        Yes.

362
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,470
然後呢?
And?

363
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,070
年輕的時候 一時衝動睡過幾次
A few times when we were young.

364
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,040
當然 這不可能對我毫無意義
I wouldn't say that it meant nothing to me...

365
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,120
...不過顯然這對夏莉的意義非比尋常
...but it certainly meant a great deal more to Charley.

366
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
那是很久之前在倫敦的事了
It was a long time ago in London.

367
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,820
我很愛夏莉
I love Charley.

368
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,620
我們是很好的朋友 就這樣
And We were very close friends but that's all.

369
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,790
這我倒不明白了
Well, I'm confused.

370
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,690
如果你和女人上床 那你為什麼跟我在一起?
If you sleep with women then why are you with me?

371
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,440
因為我會愛上男人
Because I fall in love with men.

372
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,360
因為我愛上了你
Because I fell in love with you.

373
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,640
再說了 誰沒在年輕時候 跟女人睡過啊?
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with women when they're young?

374
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,960
我沒有      你開玩笑
I haven't.        You're joking.

375
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,200
不 我沒開玩笑
No, I'm not.

376
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,070
感覺我好像對什麼都不感興趣
It was just never anything that interested me.

377
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,900
你還真是新潮啊
Well, you're awfully

378
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,110
(50-60年代青年人對世事不關心的態度)
modern aren't you?

379
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,990
你知道嗎 這也是我最初注意到你的一點...
You know, I think that was the first thing that I noticed about you...

380
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,850
...就是你的自信
...was how sure of yourself you were.

381
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,990
你這麼年輕怎會對一切都如此篤定?
How can you be so sure about everything at your age?

382
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,180
你覺得我真的瞭解自己嗎?
You think I'm sure of myself?

383
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,930
當然
Of course, you are.

384
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,140
我弄好了 謝謝你
I'm finished now. Thank you.

385
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,230
福克納先生?
Yes, Mr. Falconer?

386
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,290
還有什麼需要效勞的嗎?
Is there something else we can help you with today?

387
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,890
我找不到支票簿了 需要些現金
I can't find my check book and I need some cash.

388
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,230
真是運氣不佳啊 請稍等一會兒
Not my day I'm afraid. Excuse me a minute.

389
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,680
媽媽說濃眉的人太俗氣
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,

390
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,050
我覺得你的濃眉很漂亮
but I think yours are pretty.

391
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,910
你的也很漂亮啊
I think yours are pretty too.

392
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,980
為何你看上去這麼傷心?
Why do you look so sad?

393
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,110
你想要見見查爾斯·赫斯頓嗎?
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

394
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,830
賓虛
Ben Hur.

395
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,760
我說的是我的蝎子
He's our scorpion.

396
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,780
每晚餵它不同的食物 看著它把它們殺死
Every night we throw in something new to him and watch him kill it.

397
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,110
爸爸說就像是看角鬥一樣
Daddy says it's like the colosseum.

398
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,770
所以我哥哥湯姆就弄了些圓柱放進來
So my brother Tom put on all the columns in here.

399
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,130
他想當個佈景師
He wants to be a set designer.

400
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,240
它還沒有吃掉那只蜘蛛...
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...

401
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,130
...因為他還沒有消化完昨晚餵它的那只飛蛾
...cause he's still full from the moth we gave him last night.

402
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,410
爸爸說他想把你放進角鬥場去
Daddy says he wants to throw you in to the colosseum.

403
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,290
不是吧? 為什麼呢?
No kidding? Why?

404
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,410
他說你是穿拖鞋的(暗指他是同性戀)
He says you're light in your loafers...

405
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,780
可你根本沒穿拖鞋
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.

406
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,250
我覺得我哥哥湯姆也是個穿拖鞋的...
I think my brother Tom is light in his loafers too...

407
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,730
...可他穿的是凱茲牌(帆布鞋)
...but he wears Keds.

408
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,510
他讓我用雞蛋給頭髮做護理
He made me do a hair conditioning treatment on my hair with eggs.

409
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,500
看上去有光澤嗎?
Does it look shiny?

410
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
甜心 你怎麼在這裡打攪福克納先生呢?
Sweetheart, what are you doing bothering Mr. Falconer?

411
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,350
蘇珊 她沒有打擾到我 你好啊
She's not bothering me at all Susan. How are you?

412
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,460
喬治 很高興見到你
I'm glad to see you George.

413
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,700
喬治 我們今晚請了些人來喝酒...
George, we're having a few people over tonight for drinks...

414
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,670
...如果你能過來 大家一定很開心
...and would love to have you join us if you could.

415
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,820
謝謝你的好意 不過我另外有事了
Thank you. That's very kind of you but I have plans.

416
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,330
那就下次吧
Another time then.

417
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,400
珍妮弗 咱們別打擾福克納先生了
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get back to his banking.

418
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,350
喬治 再見
Goodbye, George.

419
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,340
再見 蘇珊 再見 珍妮弗
Bye, Susan. Bye, Jennifer.

420
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,630
先生 需要點什麼嗎?
May I help you, sir?

421
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,280
我想買這把槍用的子彈 謝謝
I'd like to buy some bullets for this gun, please.

422
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,810
嗯 先生 這把槍可是有年頭了啊
Yes, sir. This is a really old gun, sir.

423
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,890
我們正在搞促銷 買二贈送一把手槍
We have a two for one sale on handguns at the moment.

424
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,380
要不要買一把送給女士呢?
Perhaps one for the little lady?

425
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,950
不必了 我只要子彈就好了
No thank you. Just the bullets, please.

426
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,510
給您 還需要點什麼嗎?
Here you go. Anything else?

427
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,900
不用了 謝謝
No, thank you.

428
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,530
一共2塊29分 先生
That would be $2.29, sir.

429
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,900
謝謝
Thank you.

430
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,200
抱歉 但願她沒衝你亂吠吧
I'm sorry. I hope she didn't growl at you.

431
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,740
她有時會有些失控 所以我把她放在車裡
She goes a little crazy sometimes when I have to leave her in the car.

432
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,270
她很漂亮 叫什麼名字?
She's perfect. What's her name?

433
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,390
印蒂雅
India.

434
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,130
過去
Let's go there.

435
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,330
來 小可愛
You little baby.

436
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,910
我之前也養過獵狐犬 這種狗不怎麼常見
I used to have smooth fox terriers. You don't see them very often.

437
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,230
這狗聞起來像是奶油吐司
The very smell of buttered toast.

438
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,640
她還是個小狗 對吧?
She's still a puppy isn't she?

439
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,710
那麼
Well.

440
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,750
祝您晚上愉快     你也是
Have a nice evening.        You too.

441
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,410
晚安 印蒂雅
Good night, India.

442
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,910
真不好意思      沒關係的
I'm sorry about that.        No, It's ok.

443
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,940
是我的錯 我再給你買包煙
It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.

444
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,400
沒關係的
It's ok. Don't worry.

445
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,690
不 不 我還是買吧
No, no I insist.

446
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,410
謝謝
Thank you.

447
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,530
謝謝 抱歉在門口打爛了瓶子
I'm sorry about the broken glass.

448
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,920
給你      謝謝了 夥計
Here you go.        Thanks man.

449
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,980
要來一根嗎?
You want one?

450
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,780
不 謝謝
No, thanks.

451
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,870
算了 來一根又有何妨嘛
Actually, yes. Why not?

452
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,250
謝謝
Thank you.

453
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,650
卡洛斯      你說什麼?
Carlos.        What did you say?

454
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,150
卡洛斯 你問我的名字嘛
Carlos. You asked me my name.

455
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,280
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

456
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,060
哦 沒事
Yeah.

457
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,850
嗯 抱歉
Yeah, I'm sorry.

458
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,880
(西語)你真是棱角分明
You're really something.

459
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,680
臉龐猶如雕塑
You have an incredible face.

460
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,230
好好利用 這是上天的恩賜
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.

461
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,520
你的西班牙語很不錯
Your Spanish is perfect.

462
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,330
謝謝
Thank you.

463
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,850
你應該更加好好珍惜你的外表
I should have used it more.

464
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,620
其實...
Well...

465
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,130
現在也不算晚
It's not too late.

466
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,170
你要幹嘛?
What are you doing?

467
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,680
不是要去什麼地方嗎?
Aren't we going somewhere?

468
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,620
不 不過 謝謝你
No. But, thanks.

469
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,170
是煙霧
You know, it's the smog

470
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,590
造就了夕陽的餘暉(洛杉磯的光化學煙霧)
that makes it that color.

471
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,780
我從未見過這樣的天空
I've never seen a sky like this before.

472
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,360
有時候 醜陋也有自己獨特之美
Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty.

473
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,320
我能再來一根嗎?
Could I have another cigarette?

474
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,620
當然
Sure.

475
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,660
你確定不想去兜兜風嗎?      我確定
Are sure that you don't want to go for a drive?        I'm sure.

476
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,990
你從哪兒來?      馬德里
Where are you from?        Madrid.

477
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,530
馬德里? 你是怎麼來這裡的
Madrid? How did you get here?

478
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,260
說來話長
It's a long story.

479
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,110
我在工作的旅店認識了一個洛杉磯來的小伙子...
I met a guy from LA at the hotel where I worked...

480
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,890
...他告訴我
...who told me

481
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,300
我可以跟他住 他可以給我找份工作
I could live with him and that he could get me an agent.

482
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,450
但他沒想過 我有西班牙口音
But he never realized that I have a Spanish accent.

483
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,210
我喜歡你的口音 你說起來非常動聽
I like your accent. You speak very well.

484
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,060
你怎麼學的英語?
How did you learn English?

485
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,600
我小時候 媽媽有個美國男友
My mom had an American boyfriend when I was little.

486
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,110
你媽媽現在在馬德里嗎?
Is your mother in Madrid?

487
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,080
嗯 是的 她是理髮師
Yes, she is. She cuts hair.

488
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,910
她在我走之前 為我剪了頭髮
She cut my hair before I left.

489
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,410
你喜歡這髮型嗎?
Do you like it?

490
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,540
我覺得 我看起來像詹姆斯·迪恩
I thought it made me look like James Dean.

491
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,110
你比詹姆斯·迪恩還好看
You are better than James Dean.

492
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,740
真的?
Really?

493
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,660
承蒙誇獎
Thanks.

494
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,870
從沒有人跟我搭訕卻對我毫無企圖
No one has ever picked me up and not wanted something.

495
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,810
我覺得是你找我搭訕的吧
I think you picked me up.

496
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,370
今天對我來說是相對煩惱的一天
This is kind of a serious day for me.

497
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,520
說說看 像你這樣的人怎會有煩惱?
Come on. What could be so serious for a guy like you?

498
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,570
我是想要忘卻一位舊愛
I'm just trying to get over an old love I guess.

499
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,580
我媽媽說 愛人就像是公共汽車
My mother says that lovers are like buses.

500
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,980
只要你耐心等待 下一輛自然會來
You just have to wait a little while and another one comes along.

501
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,750
我得走了
I have to go.

502
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,800
你是個不錯的人
You're a nice guy.

503
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,490
希望你能夠找到...
I hope you find...

504
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,790
...和你一樣的人
...someone like you.

505
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,380
謝謝
Thanks.

506
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,390
我先走了
I'm going away.

507
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,280
輪到你去換了
It's your turn to change it.

508
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,180
才不要 是輪到你了
Yeah, I'm not changing it. It's your turn.

509
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,730
再說了 我放什麼你都不喜歡的
Besides, you never like what I put on anyway.

510
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,240
我付你五塊錢去換 我太老了 站不起來
I'll give you five dollars if you change it. I'm too old to get up.

511
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,660
你只有在能佔便宜的時候才倚老賣老
You're only old when it's convenient for you to be old.

512
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,350
你在讀什麼呀
What are you reading anyway?

513
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,230
變形記 卡夫卡著
Metamorphosis

514
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,010
老天 又是那些無病呻吟的狗屎
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.

515
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,210
上課用的
It's for my class.

516
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,610
你讀的又是什麼高級小說啊
What highbrow work of fiction might you be reading?

517
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,060
蒂凡尼的早餐 卡波特著
Breakfast at Tiffany's

518
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,860
少瞧不起人
Don't be so smug.

519
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,230
它的日子多好
Man, what a life he has.

520
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,660
真叫人羨慕     為什麼
Don't you just envy him?        Why?

521
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,490
因為誰的屁股它都可以湊上去?
Because he can sniff anyone's arse he wants?

522
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,290
真高雅
Nice.

523
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,800
是因為它隨心所欲 就像昨天...
No, because he just does what he wants. Like yesterday...

524
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,420
...我站在院子前 蘇珊過來聊天
...I was standing in the front yard and Susan came over to talk.

525
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,180
她家那個小少爺克裡斯托弗...
And that little brat of hers Christopher came...

526
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,430
...跑來耀武揚威地搖他那把破槍
...running over waving that damned gun of his around.

527
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,700
咱們家小狗就走過去 抬起腿...
And our little dog walked right up, hiked his leg...

528
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,930
...尿透了他的球鞋
...and peed all over Christopher's new tennis shoes.

529
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,820
老實說是尿透了他全身
All over Christopher actually.

530
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,350
當然 我得裝作一副很生氣的模樣
And of course, I had to act like I was upset

531
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,120
它太神了 你真該看看
It was so perfectly executed you should have seen it.

532
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,790
這隻小可憐過去被那些小孩折磨了這麼多年
After all the times those kids have tortured that poor dog.

533
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,770
你真該學學它們 它們...
I mean, you should take a lesson from him. They don't...

534
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,540
它們不會徹夜不眠地思慮
They don't stay up all night worrying.

535
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:41,850
它們找出了
They figured out

536
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,380
一套操控我們的辦法
how to get the two of us to do exactly what they want.

537
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,470
認真想想 它倆基本就是
They are basically

538
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,190
兩隻深沉的米蟲嘛
very sophisticated little parasites when you think about it.

539
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,790
最愚蠢的物種總是最快樂的
Well, the dumbest creatures are the happiest.

540
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,940
以你媽為例
Just look at your mother.

541
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,810
它真是今朝有酒今朝醉
He's really just living the moment.

542
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,880
就好比現在
It's like now.

543
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,620
還有什麼比跟你窩在一起更好的呢
What could be better than being tucked up here with you?

544
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,180
就算要我立刻死掉 也無所謂了
If I died right now it would be OK.

545
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,760
我很有所謂
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me

546
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,840
所以趕緊閉嘴去換唱片吧
so why don't you shut up and go change the record.

547
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,920
這答案不錯
Good answer.

548
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,690
你不介意的話 我下周想把它們一起
You know what? I was thinking about taking them up...

549
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,000
...帶上去丹佛
...to Denver with me next week if it's okay with you.

550
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,650
我媽愛死它們了
It's my mom. She loves them.

551
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,420
估計是因為本是同根生吧
Probably that recognition of a similar mind.

552
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,800
您待著吧 老頭
You stay there, old man.

553
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,740
請系溫莎結
Tie in a windsor.

554
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,310
我沒忘松子酒的事兒 十分鐘後見
No, I did not forget the gin. I'll see you in ten minutes.

555
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,660
克裡斯托弗 你說我幹掉你怎麼樣
Christopher, would you like it if I killed you?

556
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,700
不知道
I don't know.

557
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,110
你再這樣下去 就會知道了
If you keep this up we're going to find out.

558
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,520
所以趕緊回家 別射人了
So, why don't you go home and stop shooting people?

559
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,930
見到你真好
I'm so happy to see you.

560
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,730
快進來
Come on in.

561
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,590
好香啊 我好餓 路易斯呢
It smells wonderful. I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?

562
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,180
我放了她一晚假 今晚我親自下廚
I gave her the night off. I'm cooking myself.

563
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,410
是嘛?      我試著做了點新菜品
You are?        Yes, I'm trying something new.

564
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,090
夏莉寶貝 你下廚房本身已經夠"新鮮"的
Charley darling, "you cooking' is new.

565
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,040
少油嘴滑舌
Don't be smart.

566
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,680
今晚我心情好 我要盡情歡樂
I'm in a good mood tonight. I'm going to be fun.

567
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,270
我已經許下新年決心了
I've already made two New Year's resolutions.

568
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,690
決心一 再也不提我的雞巴前夫...
Resolution one: No more talk that of awful ex-husbands...

569
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,480
和沒良心的孩子了
..and children who don't give a damn.

570
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,280
還有呢      還有什麼
And the other one?        One what?

571
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,400
決心
Resolution.

572
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,870
決心二
Resolution two:

573
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,290
多喝 多抽 去他媽的 來
More smoking and more drinking and screw it all! So come on...

574
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,660
...給我調杯酒
...mix me up a drink.

575
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,380
我要來杯松子酒加湯力水
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

576
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,420
瞧好了吧寶貝兒      馬上來
And watch out baby!        Coming up.

577
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,610
你今晚能來真是太體貼了
It was sweet of you to come tonight.

578
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,220
這跟體貼無關
Sweet had nothing to do with it.

579
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,850
我也需要見你      少來了
I needed to see you.      Oh,Geo. Come off it.

580
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,060
每次你體貼別人時總是不好意思承認
Whenever you do something sweet you're too ashamed to admit it.

581
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,020
來敬我們的新年前決心
Here is to our early New Year's resolutions.

582
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,670
乾杯
Cheers.

583
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,290
你的決心是什麼
What are your resolutions by the way?

584
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,260
完全 徹底 永遠地遺忘過去
To let go of the past completely, entirely, and forever.

585
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,060
點根兒煙 好嗎
Light me up, will you?

586
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,410
親愛的 你氣色不對啊
Darling, you don't look well.

587
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,340
還記得你去年的那場心臟病嗎
Do you remember that little heart attack you had last year?

588
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,050
那算不上心臟病
It wasn't a heart attack.

589
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,360
不管那是什麼 親愛的...
Well whatever it was darling...

590
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,310
...你現在可一點都不性感
...you don't look so hot.

591
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,430
我挺好 從沒感覺這麼好過
I'm fine. I never felt better.

592
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,680
就是有點累 已經好久沒睡...
I'm a little tired. I haven't been sleeping...

593
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,160
這很正常 老喬
Geo, it's normal.

594
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,650
你和吉姆在一起16年了
You were with Jim for 16 years.

595
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,390
我至今都日夜思念理查呢
I think about Richard every day.

596
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,710
孤單是一種病啊
It's hard being alone.

597
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,360
至少你還有自己的工作和生活
At least you have a job and a life.

598
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,870
去嘗嘗晚餐 如何
Let's have a bit of dinner shall we?

599
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,230
我可花了老大功夫來做呢
Because I've worked so very hard.

600
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,530
你說什麼啊
What are you talking about?

601
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,480
真的 現在沒有"老"這個說法了
Seriously, there no such thing as old anymore.

602
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:52,620
我一個學生有一天管我叫"老年市民"
The other day one of my students has called me a senior citizen.

603
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,260
我不在乎"老"的存在與否...
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...

604
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,100
...但估計"老年"我也談不上喜歡吧
...but I'm not sure senior is what I'm aiming for either.

605
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,470
一切都變得那麼寡然無味
It's all becoming so bland.

606
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,760
這可不是我來美國的原因
It's not why I came to America.

607
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,170
彷彿一切文化和禮儀都一夕之間分崩離析了
It's like a complete breakdown of culture and manners.

608
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,990
那些年輕人根本不懂禮儀
The young ones have no manners.

609
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,260
有一天在洗車店
The other day at the car wash

610
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,530
一個年輕人上下打量我一番...
a young man looked me up and down...

611
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,380
...然後居然問我的金髮是不是天生的
...and actually asked me if I was a natural blonde.

612
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,900
你怎麼說      我盯著他的眼睛...
What did you say?        I looked him straight in the eye...

613
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:17,600
...說"這麼說吧 我倒立起來的話...
...and said: "Let's just say if I stood on my head...

614
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,800
...就是個天生的口氣清新的黑髮美女了"
...I would be a natural brunette with lovely breath.

615
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,620
不會吧      真的
You didn't!        I did!

616
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,610
有趣的事他立馬就相信了
And the amusing thing was that it went right over his head!

617
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,380
你早在倫敦的時候就是個刀子嘴
You know, you had a mouth on you even back in London.

618
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,980
你還記得那個拿飲料砸你的女同志嗎...
Do you remember that old lesbian who threw her drink over your head...

619
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,260
...就因為你問人家的洞洞夠不夠用
...because you asked her if she was hung like a donut.

620
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,440
老喬
Geo.

621
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,200
我們兩 隨時都能回倫敦去啊
We could always go back to London. The two of us.

622
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,170
免了 多謝      你知道你懷念倫敦的
No, thanks.        You know you miss it.

623
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,520
偶爾為之
I miss it sometimes.

624
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,050
吉姆活著的話或許還有可能
Maybe if Jim had lived.

625
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,970
他喜歡呆在英國
He loved being in England.

626
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,630
我們上次回去的時候他就想留下
He asked us to stay the last time we were there.

627
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,510
你認真考慮過搬回去的事嗎
Do you really think you would have moved?

628
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,550
不知道 這事說起來都覺得很傻 只是個幻想
I don't know. It's silly to even talk about it. It was only a fantasy.

629
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,090
這是什麼
What's this?

630
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,330
我媽的婚戒
It's my mother's wedding ring.

631
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,360
我清理抽屜時找到的
I found it a drawer when I was cleaning out.

632
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,050
夏莉寶貝 我倆都需要再來一杯
Charley my dear, you and I are both in need of another drink.

633
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,070
等等 等等
Wait! Wait, wait!

634
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,200
我超愛這首
I love this!

635
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,430
你個瘋女人      來嘛 老傢伙
You're insane!        Come on, old man!

636
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:32,700
別動
Don't move.

637
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,310
謝謝
Thank you.

638
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,360
點煙老手了啊      我一直想這麼點煙
Very smooth cigarette move.        I've always wanted to do that.

639
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,140
你都不抽煙了
You don't even smoke.

640
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,360
有16年沒抽了 吉姆不喜歡
Well, not for the last sixteen years. Jim hated it.

641
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,970
現在何樂不為呢 也氣不死他了
What's to stop me now? It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.

642
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,930
這樣和你躺在這兒 真好
This is so nice, lying here with you.

643
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,380
你會不會懷念
Don't you ever miss this?

644
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,320
我們本可以發展成為什麼樣的關係呢?
What we could have been to each other?

645
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,950
真正的感情 結婚生子的感情
Having a real relationship and kids?

646
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,300
我有吉姆      我指真正的感情
I had Jim.        I know, but I mean a real relationship.

647
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,350
老喬 老實說
Geo, let's be honest,

648
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,160
你和吉姆很美妙但...
what you and Jim had together was wonderful but...

649
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:41,380
...那也只是別的事的替代品吧
...wasn't it really just a substitute for something else?

650
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,450
這真是你這些年來的想法嗎
Is that really what you think after all of these years?

651
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:53,020
你覺得吉姆於我來說只是個真愛的替代品?
You think Jim was just some kind of substitute for real love?

652
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,510
吉姆不是什麼的替代品
Jim was not a substitute for anything.

653
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,430
你明白嗎
Do you understand?

654
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,970
任何人都不可能...
There is no substitute for Jim...

655
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,050
...替代他
...anywhere!

656
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,440
再說 你跟理查的關係又多真摯了嗎
And by the way, what is so real about your relationship with Richard?

657
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,560
他九年後就離開你了
He left you after nine years!

658
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,310
吉姆和我在一起整整16年
Jim and I were together for sixteen years!

659
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,260
他要是沒死我們還會在一起
And if he hadn't died we would still be together!

660
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,230
這還他媽不夠真實嗎
What the hell is not real about that?

661
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,340
對不起 對不起 對不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

662
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,610
我知道你們有多相愛
I know how much the two of you loved each other.

663
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,160
我可能只是嫉妒我倆不能那樣相愛吧
I suppose I'm just jealous that you and I never had that kind of love.

664
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,190
老實說我從沒跟任何人那樣相愛過
Actually, I've never had that kind of love with anybody.

665
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,800
理查除了喜歡我的外表...
I don't think Richard ever loved me...

666
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,189
...估計從沒愛過我吧
...except for the way I looked.

667
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,990
還有克雷
And Clay...

668
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,350
我也不知道 你含辛茹苦地養大孩子...
I don't know. You raise a child and love it...

669
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,250
...他們羽翼豐滿了就離開你
...and then when they are old enough they just leave.

670
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,180
夏莉 其實你的生活沒什麼問題
Charley, there is nothing wrong with your life.

671
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,560
但你就是喜歡自憐自艾
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.

672
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,830
這是你的一大愛好
It's one of your great pleasures.

673
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,030
你不一樣嗎
And it's not one of yours?

674
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,910
你跟我一樣可悲
You're as pathetic as I am.

675
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,640
自憐自艾可不是我的最大愛好
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely not one of my great pleasures.

676
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,990
也不是我的
Well, it's not one of mine either.

677
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,890
我一點都不喜歡自憐自艾
I don't like feeling sorry for myself one bit.

678
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,700
我一直都想留住理查...
I tried to hold onto Richard for so long...

679
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,670
...即便除了我全世界都知道沒希望了
...even when it was obvious to everyone but me that it was over.

680
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,210
現在克雷也長大了
And now Clay is grown up.

681
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,880
我在這兒幹嘛啊老喬 告訴我啊
I mean, what am I doing here Geo? Tell me, what?

682
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,370
你有這麼多朋友 你沒事的
You have plenty of friends. You'll be fine.

683
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,540
我是有朋友 但他們都不需要我啊
Yes, I have friends. But none of them need me.

684
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,380
我也有你
And yes I have you

685
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,220
你要個該死的同志的話我們就能皆大歡喜了
and if you weren't such a goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

686
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,730
我現在有你 也是因為你失去了吉姆
I only have you now because you lost Jim.

687
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,300
但很快你又會有別人的
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.

688
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,870
這對女人來說沒那麼容易的
It's not as easy for a woman.

689
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,680
所有事我都竭盡了全力...
I've done everything the way I was supposed to and...

690
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,020
...而現在身邊只剩下的 是一瓶松子酒
...all I have to keep me company is a bottle of gin.

691
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,420
你或許也該找個洞洞來下酒
Maybe you should try donuts with your gin.

692
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,790
去你的
Screw you.

693
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,690
夏洛特 你太能演了
Charlotte, you are dramatic.

694
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,910
我差點就當真了
I swear you really almost had me.

695
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,630
一小滴眼淚都要從我眼角邊落下了
A tiny tear was beginning to form in the corner of my eye.

696
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:50,810
別這樣了
Now stop it.

697
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:54,490
你仍舊美得讓人窒息啊
You are still breathtakingly beautiful.

698
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,330
只要你肯打起精神從床上爬下來...
When you can be bothered to get up and out of bed...

699
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,510
...不要再事事都怨聲連連
...and you stop whimpering about everything for five minutes.

700
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,990
去倫敦吧 改變你的生活
Go to London. Change your life.

701
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,370
做女人做得不開心 就別婆婆媽媽的了
If you're not happy being a woman then stop acting like one.

702
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,080
你總有一切問題的答案
You have all the answers.

703
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,900
我沒什麼答案
No, I don't have any to mention.

704
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,110
你要真這麼聰明 何不改變自己的生活
If you're so smart why don't you have something new in your life?

705
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:15,640
接受斯坦福大學的職位
Take that position at Stanford.

706
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,230
你總是抱怨那所破學校
You complain about that little school

707
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,760
但你其實想去哪都行的
but you could go anywhere you want.

708
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,360
我覺得自己的付出還是有回報的
I think what I've done has been worthwhile.

709
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,350
抱歉 抱歉
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

710
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,580
我不該這麼說的
I shouldn't have said that.

711
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,720
儘管很厭惡 但我想我還是會回倫敦的
As much as I dread it, I think I will go back to London.

712
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,780
幹嘛要厭惡?
Why do you dread it?

713
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,510
我在倫敦時既年輕又新鮮
When I lived in London last I was young.

714
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,180
世界都在我腳下
I was fresh, I was everything.

715
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,360
來美國就像個夢想 像是蛋糕上的糖霜
Coming to America was such a dream, it was the icing on the cake.

716
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,960
回家則是挫敗
Going home is defeat.

717
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,780
沒有什麼事如我所願的
None of it really worked out the way I'd planned.

718
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,270
大多數事情都是不隨人願的
Most things don't work out the way people plan.

719
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,760
你一直活在過去
You're just living in the past.

720
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,520
你得開始考慮未來了
You need to start thinking about your future.

721
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,070
活在過去就是我的未來
Living in the past is my future.

722
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,820
你就不必如此 你是個男人
It doesn't have to be yours. You're a man.

723
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,730
而且今晚你是個悶蛋男人
And you're a bore tonight.

724
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,790
我們就不能再自怨自艾一小會兒嗎
Can't we just feel sorry for ourselves a little bit longer?

725
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,090
再喝一杯吧
Let's have another drink.

726
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,340
算了 我得走了
I don't think so. I have to go.

727
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,140
來陪我出去      求你啦
Come on. Walk me out.        Please, please!

728
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:13,780
好了 我得走了      不行 這麼好玩的
Come on, I have to!        No, this was such fun! No.

729
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,750
我什麼時候能再見你?
When will I see you again?

730
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,150
你不是要去英國嗎      我絕對不會去的
Aren't you going to England?        I'll never do that!

731
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,100
太花功夫了
It's far too much effort.

732
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,020
再說
Besides,

733
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:37,060
吉姆也不希望我把你一個人留在洛杉磯
I don't think Jim would want me to leave you here in LA all alone.

734
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,010
別擔心我
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

735
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,400
我有一切問題的答案 不是嗎
I've got all the answers. Remember?

736
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,740
你這週末幹嘛
What are you doing this weekend?

737
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,230
很安靜地待著吧
I think I might just be very quiet.

738
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,870
你從沒對我認真過 對吧 喬治
You never really did take me seriously, did you George?

739
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,360
我試過了 夏莉 記得嗎 很早以前
I tried to Charley. Remember? A long time ago.

740
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,660
但沒有結果 不是嗎
It didn't really work out, did it?

741
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,930
別 夏莉
No, Charley.

742
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:09,800
晚安
Sleep tight.

743
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,780
帕特裡克 來杯啤酒 一包煙
Patrick, a beer and a packet of Lucky Strike, please.

744
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,610
勞駕
Excuse me.

745
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:55,950
裡頭太熱了
It's too hot in there.

746
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,960
沒錯
Yes, it is.

747
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,270
來根兒煙?      謝了 我不抽煙
Would you like a cigarette?        No thanks, I don't smoke.

748
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:06,350
這兒人真多      週六晚上嘛
This place is really crowded.        Well, it is Saturday night.

749
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,570
通常人都很多的
It's usually as bad as this.

750
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,720
大家基本都是在這裡搭個人
People normally just stop by and pick someone up

751
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,140
去海邊折騰
and then head on down the beach.

752
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,530
嗯 這兒挺狂野的
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.

753
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,810
很奇怪警察還沒來查
I'm surprised the cops don't break it up.

754
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,010
這裡總是這樣的嗎      戰後開始
Is it always like that?        Since the war ended.

755
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,310
其實挺棒的 像是邪教聚會
It's pretty great actually. It's kind of pagan.

756
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,250
我叫吉姆      我是喬治
I'm Jim.        I'm George.

757
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,150
幸會 吉姆
Pleased to meet you Jim.

758
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,440
抱歉 我原本是來找朋友的 但我找不著了
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some friends but I can't find them.

759
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,440
我只是出門轉轉
I just needed to get out of the house

760
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,710
但沒禁受住冰啤的誘惑
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

761
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,630
你住在附近?
Do you live hereby?

762
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,570
在峽谷那兒
Canyon.

763
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,390
住了多久了      38年開始
For how long?        Since 38.

764
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,570
你哪兒來的?      科羅拉多
Where are you from?        Colorado.

765
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:48,500
我很喜歡這裡 離海灘很近·
I really like it here. It's close to beach.

766
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,540
等我退伍後 我估計就會留在這兒了
I think I might stay after I'm discharged.

767
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,060
或許我也有點邪教氣息吧
I don't know, maybe I'm a bit of a pagan.

768
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,770
你先請      不
After you.        No.

769
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:08,860
抱歉
Sorry.

770
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,920
你好啊      嗨
Well, hello.        Hi.

771
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,270
可以給我買杯酒嗎
Do you buy me a drink?

772
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,290
我有伴了
I think I'm taken.

773
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,270
太可惜了 太可惜了
Too bad, too bad.

774
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,830
還想再來一杯嗎
Do you want another beer?

775
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,560
帕特裡克 打包威士忌和一包煙
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?

776
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,100
帕特裡克 不要了
Patrick, cancel that.

777
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,030
你好啊 波特先生
Well, hello Mr. Potter.

778
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,840
你好 先生
Hello, sir.

779
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,080
我們喝什麼?      蘇格蘭威士忌
What are we drinking?        Scotch.

780
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,990
好吧
Okay.

781
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,530
我常來這兒
I come here all the time.

782
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,560
我就住在附近 你知道的
I live just around the corner, but then you knew that.

783
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,940
住在坎弗樹路上
On Camphor Tree Lane.

784
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:24,760
你還帶在身上
You're still carrying that around.

785
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,940
人必須對生活賜予的小禮物報以感恩
One must always appreciate life's little gifts.

786
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,840
你在這兒幹嘛呢
So, what are you doing here?

787
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,530
出來踩踩單車而已      僅此而已?
Just out for a ride on my bike.        Is that all?

788
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,350
不知道啊
I don't know.

789
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:41,930
你是在找我嗎
Were you looking for me?

790
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,070
可能吧 我不知道
Maybe. I don't know.

791
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,590
我覺得自己腦袋塞滿了東西
I feel like my head's stopped up with stuff.

792
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,830
什麼東西
What kind of stuff?

793
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,970
譬如您今天在課上說的東西
Like, the stuff you were talking about today in class.

794
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,720
那些完全無關緊要
That is definitely not important.

795
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,210
不 很重要的 您的課很棒
No, it is important. Your class is great.

796
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,230
但我們好像總是在談論著過去
But somehow we always seem to get stuck talking about the past.

797
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,370
我不關心過去
The past just doesn't matter to me.

798
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,130
那當下呢      我等不及讓當下成為過去
The present?        I can't wait for the present to be over.

799
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,120
當下太拖拉了
It's a total drag.

800
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:10,100
但今晚是個例外
Well, tonight is the exception.

801
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:12,370
怎麼?
What?

802
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,480
今晚 好! 當下 壞!
Tonight, yes! The present, no!

803
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,250
敬今晚
Let's drink to tonight.

804
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,600
敬今晚
Tonight.

805
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,320
如果過去無關緊要 當下又十分拖拉
So if the past doesn't matter and the present is a total drag.

806
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,370
那麼未來呢
What about the future?

807
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,010
什麼未來 我們或許就要被古巴炸飛了
What future? Cuba might just blow us up.

808
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,050
未來就是死亡啊
Death is the future.

809
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,410
抱歉 我不是故意要說得這麼消極的
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be depressing.

810
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,620
不消極 不消極 很真實
It's not depressing. It's not depressing, it's true.

811
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:38,300
這或許不是近期的將來 但卻是我們共同的歸宿
It may not be your immediate future but it's what we all share.

812
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,560
死亡就是未來
Death is the future.

813
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:42,920
我想 你是對的
You're right, I guess.

814
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,770
當人無法再當下獲得快樂時...
If one is not enjoying one's present there isn't a great deal to...

815
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,550
...未來的快樂就更是未知的了
...suggest that the future should be any better.

816
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,820
嗯 我過去想過這個
Yeah, I've thought that before.

817
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,970
但問題是 你永遠無法預知
But the thing is you just never know.

818
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,760
譬如今晚
Look at tonight.

819
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,360
老實說...
Actually...

820
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,000
...我時常感覺孤單
...I feel really alone most of the time.

821
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,580
是嗎      嗯
You do?        Yeah.

822
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,630
我總是有這種感覺
I've always felt this way.

823
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:11,660
我們孤單一人出世 孤單一人離去
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.

824
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,500
在這世上
And while we're here

825
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,860
我們又被徹底完全地封印在這身體裡
we are absolutely, completely sealed in our own bodies.

826
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,600
真夠怪的
Really weird.

827
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,850
每每想到這個都會很害怕
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.

828
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,440
我們只能通過自己扭曲的角度
We can only experience the outside world

829
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,390
來體驗世界
through our own slanted perception of it.

830
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,040
誰知道你的真是面目呢
Who knows what you're really like?

831
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,370
我看見的只是我認為的你的樣子
I just see what I think you're like.

832
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,000
我完全表裡如一的
I'm exactly what I appear to be.

833
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,550
只要你走近了看
If you look closely.

834
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,220
你知道嗎 人生最有價值的...
You know the only thing that has made the whole thing worthwhile...

835
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,490
幾個瞬間
...has been those...

836
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,100
就是當我
...few times

837
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,230
真正和他人交心的時刻
that I've been able to really, truly connect with another human being.

838
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,700
我對您有一種預感 先生
I had a hunch about you, sir.

839
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,840
是嗎      對
You did?        Yes, sir.

840
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,890
我感覺您一定是個浪漫主義者
I had a hunch you might be a real romantic.

841
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:15,240
人人都說...
You know, everyone keeps telling you that...

842
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,000
...人老了以後講積累許多經驗
...when you're older, that you'll have all this experience.

843
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,540
彷彿那是件很好的東西
Like it's some great thing.

844
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,130
這都是扯淡
That's a load of shit.

845
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,690
我覺得自己是越來越愚蠢了
I think I've actually just gotten sillier and sillier.

846
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,660
是嗎      絕對的
Really?        Absolutely.

847
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:29,040
所以 所有的經驗都是無用的
So, all your experience is useless.

848
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,490
倒也不是
No, I wouldn't say that.

849
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,090
如我們的朋友赫胥黎先生所說
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:

850
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,570
經驗不是人遇見的事
Experience is not what happens to a man.

851
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,750
而是人對所遇見事物的反應
It is what a man does with what happens to him.

852
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,260
去游泳吧      好啊
Let's go swimming.        Okay.

853
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,050
怎麼      那是個測試
What?        It was a test.

854
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,350
我以為你說變傻的事是在虛張聲勢...
I thought you were bluffing about being silly so...

855
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,280
...所以我想建議你
...I said to myself I'll suggest

856
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,930
做一件絕對出格的事兒
doing something completely outrageous.

857
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,300
如果你反對 甚至有一絲猶豫
And if he resists, if he even hesitates

858
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,850
那你就是滿口胡言
then I know he's full of shit.

859
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,280
看來我不是了 你是嗎
Well, I wasn't. Were you?

860
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,190
當然不是
Hell, no!

861
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,550
來吧先生 我幫你下去
Come on sir. I'll help you down.

862
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,200
走
Let's go.

863
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,380
來啊先生
Come on, sir.

864
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,290
先生?
Sir?

865
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,170
先生?
Sir?

866
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,780
差不多了 先生
That's enough for now, sir.

867
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,960
我沒事      但我冷了 走吧
I'm fine.        I'm cold. Come on.

868
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,550
可以去您家嗎 先生
Can we go back to your place, sir?

869
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,420
當然 不然去哪
Of course. Where else?

870
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,600
不然去哪      你傻啊
Where else.        Are you out of your mind?

871
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,470
怎麼了      你不能就這樣回家吧
What's the matter?        You can't get home like that!

872
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,180
我們是隱形的 您不知道嗎
We're invisible, don't you know that?

873
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:34,830
先生 他們以後不能讓您單獨行事
You know sir, they ought not to let you out on your own.

874
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,790
你絕對是個惹麻煩的人
You're liable to get into real trouble.

875
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,460
是我的強項
I excel at it.

876
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,580
您額頭出血了
Your forehead is bleeding.

877
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,750
你想洗澡的話 浴室就在走廊盡頭
The bathroom is just down the hall if you would like to take a shower.

878
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,890
您不洗個澡嗎 先生
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?

879
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,550
我沒事 我們英國人就愛又濕又冷
I'm fine. I'm English. We like to be cold and wet.

880
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,750
我想我們得先處理一下傷口 先生
First, I think that we need to take care of that cut, sir.

881
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,190
您有創可貼嗎
Do you have any band-aids?

882
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,500
您要去野營嗎 先生      我沒事 真的
Going camping, sir?        I'm fine, really.

883
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,180
呆在這兒 我馬上回來
Stay there. I'll be right back.

884
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:10,600
坐起來
Sit up.

885
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,100
仰頭
Tilt your head back.

886
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:40,690
先生 這回您恐怕不能以迷幻藥...
Well sir, I'm afraid this time you don't have...

887
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,080
...作為您貼創可貼的原因了
...the excuse of mescaline to explain your band-aid.

888
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,560
你該把濕衣服脫下來
I think we should get you out of those wet clothes.

889
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,390
遵命
Yes, sir.

890
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,930
不會冷吧      我挺好
You're not too cold?        I'm great.

891
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,100
想來一杯嗎      啤酒吧 如果您有的話
Would you like a drink?        A beer, sir. If you have one.

892
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:29,360
恐怕我就只有這個了
I'm afraid that's all we have.

893
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,050
兩杯啤酒 馬上就來
Two beers coming up.

894
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,310
您一個人住在這裡嗎 先生
You live here all by yourself, sir?

895
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,020
現在是了
I do now.

896
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,280
曾經是和一個朋友同住 他是個建築師
I used to share this place with a friend. He was an architect.

897
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:54,280
我們這年紀的人做夢都想要有這房子的設施啊
Man, guys my age dream about the kind of setup you've got here.

898
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,960
夫復何求啊
I mean, what more can you want?

899
01:21:56,970 --> 01:22:00,170
可以獨自生活 來去自如
You get to be left alone and come and go as you please.

900
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:03,880
這就是你的理想生活嗎
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?

901
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,950
怎麼 先生 您不相信嗎
What's the matter, sir? Don't you believe me?

902
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,430
如果你這麼熱愛獨自一人的生活...
If you're so keen on the idea living by yourself...

903
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,130
...洛伊斯對你來說又是什麼呢
...where does Lois fit into this plan?

904
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,380
洛伊斯?這關她什麼事?
Lois? What's she got to do with anything?

905
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,190
我感覺你倆是一對的
I got the impression that you and she were together.

906
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,830
談不上 她挺酷的...
Not really. She is kind of cool and...

907
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,250
...我們是好朋友但...
...we're good friends but...

908
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,150
您真正想問的是我倆有沒有上過床吧
I think what you really want to ask me is if we sleep together.

909
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,200
上過嗎      上過 有一次
And do you?        We did. Once.

910
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,530
怎麼只有一次
Why only once?

911
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,260
我沒說"只有一次" 是"有一次"
I didn't say only once, I said once.

912
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,890
拜託 我現在最不想說的就洛伊斯了
Come on, the last thing I want to talk about right now is Lois.

913
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,650
現在幾點了
What time is it?

914
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,990
我的表似乎停了
My watch seems to have stopped.

915
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,800
你想讓我走了嗎
Do you want me to go?

916
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,850
開玩笑 再去拿兩杯啤酒來
You must be kidding. Go, get us another beer.

917
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,870
這是命令嗎 先生
Is that an order, sir?

918
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,450
當然
You're damn right it is.

919
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:17,610
可悲啊
Pathetic.

920
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,890
您說什麼了嗎 先生
Did you say something, sir?

921
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,620
你為什麼來這兒
Why are you here?

922
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:34,330
你為什麼去辦公室 向秘書要我的地址
Why did you get to the office and ask secretary for my address?

923
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:40,560
我只想在學校以外的地方見到您
I just wanted to see you someplace other than school.

924
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,390
為什麼
Why?

925
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,620
有時我覺得自己瘋了
Sometimes I think I'm crazy

926
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,760
因為我看到的世界和眾人不同
cause I see things so differently than everyone else.

927
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,370
我感覺可以向您傾訴
I feel like I can talk to you.

928
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,050
老實說先生 我今天很擔心您
To be honest sir, I was also worried about you today.

929
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,460
我嗎
Me?

930
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,050
有什麼好擔心的
What's to be worried about?

931
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,390
我沒事
I'm fine.

932
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,590
我...
I'm...

933
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,340
我沒事
I'm fine.

934
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,680
我人生中 只有幾個醍醐灌頂的瞬間
A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity.

935
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,010
那短暫的瞬間裡...
When for a few brief seconds...

936
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,130
...寂靜淹沒了嘈雜...
...the silence drowns out the noise...

937
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,400
...我更能夠感覺 而不是思考
...and I can feel rather than think.

938
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,560
一切都顯得那麼明晰...
And things seem so sharp...

939
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:19,290
世界都顯得那麼清澈...
And the world seems so fresh...

940
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,470
...彷彿一切都物歸原主了
...as though it had all just come into existence.

941
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,360
但我永遠無法維持這樣的瞬間
I can never make these moments last.

942
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,520
我牢牢抓住它們...
I cling to them...

943
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,210
...但如同萬事萬物 它們都消逝了
...but like everything they fade.

944
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,440
我一直活在這幾個時刻當中
I've lived my live on these moments.

945
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,810
但它們又將我推回當下...
They pull me back to the present...

946
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,680
然後我意識到
...and I realize that

947
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,020
一切都是按照命中注定的軌道行駛
everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.

948
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:21,590
就這樣 襲來
And just like that it came.

949
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:34,960
