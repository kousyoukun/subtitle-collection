1
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,440
Friday, 30 November, 1962

2
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,060
Waking up begins with saying "am" and "now".

3
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,320
Jennifer, I'm not gonna tell you again.

4
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,370
For the past eight months waking up has actually hurt.

5
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,240
The cold realization that I'm still here slowly sets in.

6
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,740
I was never teribly fond of waking up.

7
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,690
I was never one to jump out of bed

8
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,180
and greet the day with a smile like Jim was.

9
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,200
I used to want to punch him sometimes in the morning he was so happy.

10
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,930
I always used to tell him that

11
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,090
only fools greet the day with a smile...

12
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,270
...that only fools possibly escape the simple truth.

13
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,290
That now isn't simply now.

14
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,810
It's a cold reminder. One day later than yesterday.

15
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,350
One year later than last year.

16
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,900
And that sooner or later it will come.

17
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,360
He used to laugh at me and then give me kiss on the cheek.

18
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,460
It takes time in the morning for me to become George.

19
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,390
The time to adjust to

20
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,340
what is expected of George and how he is to behave.

21
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,820
By the time I have dressed and put the final layer of polish...

22
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,080
...on the now slightly stiff

23
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,260
but quite perfect George...

24
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,530
...I know fully what part I'm supposed to play

25
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,590
Looking in the mirror staring back at me

26
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,150
isn't so much as a face...

27
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,650
...as the expression of a predicament.

28
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,020
Just get through the goddamn day.

29
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,770
A bit melodramatic, I guess.

30
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,430
But then again...

31
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,570
...my heart has been broken.

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,080
I feel as if I am sinking, drowning...

33
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,710
...can't breathe.

34
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
Aren't you going to say something?

35
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,020
Are you kidding? It's spectacular.

36
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,350
What are you doing?

37
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,220
Just stop it. Stop it.

38
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,300
I don't think that you're quite ready for

39
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,930
life in a glass house.

40
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,510
Drapes, old man.

41
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,150
You're the one who is always saying that we are invisible.

42
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,910
That's not exactly what I meant.

43
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,810
For the first time in my life I can't see my future.

44
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,920
Every day goes by in a haze.

45
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,730
But today I have decided will be different.

46
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,640
Finally. You know it's been raining here all day.

47
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,210
I've been trapped in this house waiting for you to call.

48
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,710
I'm sorry, I must have the wrong number.

49
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,010
I'm calling for Mr. George Falconer.

50
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm sorry, I was expecting someone else.

51
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,500
Yes sir, you have indeed called the...

52
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,340
...correct number. How may I help you?

53
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,140
This is Harold Ackerley.

54
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm Jim's cousin.

55
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,330
Of course. Yes, good evening Mr. Ackerley.

56
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm afraid I'm calling with some bad news.

57
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,150
There has been a car accident.

58
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,430
An accident?

59
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,640
There has been a lot of snow here lately and the roads have been icy.

60
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,160
On his way into town, Jim lost control of his car.

61
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,790
It was instantaneous apparently.

62
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,860
It happened late yesterday, but his parents didn't want to call you.

63
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,490
I see.

64
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,050
In fact, they don't that I'm calling you now.

65
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,040
But I thought that you should know.

66
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,340
Thank you.

67
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,600
I know this must be quite a shock. It was for all of us.

68
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,460
Yes, indeed.

69
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,190
Will there be a service?        The day after tomorrow.

70
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,850
Well, I suppose I should get off the phone...

71
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,920
...and book a plane flight.

72
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,010
The service is just for family.

73
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,060
For family, of course.

74
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,480
Well, thank you for calling.

75
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,140
Mr. Ackerley?        Yes?

76
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,670
May I ask what happened to the dogs?

77
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,590
Dogs?

78
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,220
There was a dog with him but he died. Was there another one?

79
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,180
Yes, there was a small female.

80
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,380
I don't know, I'm sorry.

81
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,760
I haven't heard anyone mentioning another dog.

82
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,110
Well, thank you for calling Mr. Ackerley.

83
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,540
Goodbye, Mr. Falconer.

84
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,400
Hello, Charley.

85
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,960
How did you know it was me?

86
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,710
Charlotte, nobody else calls me before eight in the morning.

87
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,590
I didn't call too early, did I? You sound grumpy.

88
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,730
No, I have a headache.

89
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,440
Listen, I was going to call you actually.

90
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,300
Is it too late to change my mind about tonight.

91
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,420
No, of course not.

92
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,910
I haven't seen you all week.

93
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,460
I'm dying for a dose of you.        I know, I'm sorry.

94
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,940
So great, I'll see you tonight.

95
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,740
I have to run. I'm late for the work.

96
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,610
I'll call you later from school.

97
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,660
Alright, I see you then.

98
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,970
Bye, kiddo.        Bye, old man.

99
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,420
Good morning, Mr. George.

100
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,420
Sir, you don't look so good today.

101
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,010
Good morning, Alva. No, I didn't sleep very well.

102
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,720
You forgot to take the bread out of the freezer this morning.

103
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,130
It stays fresh that way.

104
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,060
It was a little too fresh this morning.

105
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,020
There are some papers laid out on my desk...

106
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:47,510
...which need to stay there. Please don't move them.

107
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm afraid my pen leaked all over the bed.

108
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,880
It's okay, sir.

109
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,860
Alva?        Yes, sir?

110
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:55,570
Thank you, you're a wonderful.

111
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,750
This government, as promised,

112
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,590
has maintained the closest surveillance...

113
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,780
...of the Soviet military buildup on the Island of Cuba.

114
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:14,200
Within the past week unmistakable evidence...

115
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,730
...has established the fact...

116
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,880
Professor Falconer?        Yes?

117
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,170
There was a student here this morning asking for your address.

118
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,160
My address?

119
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,290
Did you give it to him?        Yes, sir.

120
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,390
I did.

121
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,530
I hope that's okay.

122
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,290
I realize that I probably shouldn't have but he was very nice.

123
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,730
Before I knew it he...

124
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,740
Your hair looks great up like that. I really fits suits you.

125
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,530
You always look so beautiful...

126
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,570
...really fresh...

127
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,320
You have such a lovely smile.

128
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,720
Arpege?        Sir?

129
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,780
Really beautiful.

130
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,480
...that a series of offensive missile sites...

131
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,290
Good morning, Don.        Good morning, George.

132
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,950
Good morning, George.

133
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,010
Good morning, Grant.

134
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,240
You look awful. What have you been doing?

135
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,970
Look around you, Grant.

136
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,960
Most of these students aspire to nothing more than corporate job...

137
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:52,650
...and a desire to raise

138
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,670
coke-drinking, TV-watching children...

139
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,890
...who as soon as they can speak

140
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
start chanting TV jingles...

141
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,900
...and smashing things with hammers.

142
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,710
You're really scaring me today, George.

143
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,450
Don't tell me. You have easy time with these students.

144
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,540
I found them staring at me

145
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,380
in a kind of bovine stupor...

146
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,120
...as if I were lecturing in a foreign language.

147
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,090
Remind me why we shouldn't all just be annihilated.

148
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,050
You seem to think this is all a joke.

149
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,440
We're living in a world where nuclear war is a real threat.

150
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,480
I don't understand how that doesn't concern you.

151
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,510
You're serious, aren't you?

152
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,270
Yes, I'm serious.

153
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,260
George did you even read

154
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
the article I gave you on bomb shelters?

155
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,400
Our is almost done. We had 3 contractors work on it...

156
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,000
...so none of them know what we've got.

157
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,420
I'm having the outside of it landscaped

158
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,920
so no one will that it's there.

159
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,620
Really?

160
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,680
If word gets out that you've got a better shelter...

161
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,900
...then everyone will try to get in when something happens.

162
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:35,950
So?

163
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,490
There will be no time for sentiment

164
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,480
when the Russians fire a missile at us.

165
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,360
If it's going to be a world with no time for sentiment Grant...

166
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,890
...the it's not a world that I want to live in.

167
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:29,040
After Many a Summer

168
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,820
Dies the Swan.

169
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,970
I think you've all...

170
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,640
...read the Huxley novel

171
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,790
I assigned more than three weeks ago?

172
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,340
How does the title relate to our story?

173
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,440
Yes, Mr. Mong.

174
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,680
It doesn't.

175
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,290
It's about a rich guy

176
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,270
who's too afraid that he's too old for this girl...

177
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,910
...and thinks that a young guy...

178
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,880
Russ.

179
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,020
Russ?

180
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,760
Yes, Mr. Hirsch.

181
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,730
Sir, on page 79, Mr. Propter says that...

182
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,430
...the stupidest text in the Bible is

183
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,470
they hated me without a cause.

184
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,740
Does that mean the Nazis were right to hate the Jews?

185
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,040
Is Huxley an anti-Semite?        No.

186
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,040
No, Mr. Huxley is not an anti-Semite.

187
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,850
Of course, the Nazis were wrong to hate the Jews.

188
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,970
But their hating the Jews was not without a cause.

189
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,560
It's just that the cause wasn't real.

190
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,890
The cause was imagined.

191
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,990
The cause was fear.

192
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,760
Let's leave the Jews out o this just for a moment.

193
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,490
Let's think of another minority. One that...

194
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,270
One that can go unnoticed if it needs to.

195
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,790
There are all sorts of minorities,

196
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,810
blondes for example...

197
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,890
...or people with freckles.

198
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,550
But a minority is only thought of as one...

199
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,800
...when it constitutes some kind of threat to the majority.

200
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:04,100
A real threat or an imagined one.

201
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,770
And therein lies the fear.

202
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:11,180
If the minority is somehow invisible...

203
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,790
...and the fear is much greater.

204
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,410
That fear is why the minority is persecuted.

205
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,000
So, you see there always is a cause.

206
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,190
The cause is fear.

207
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,020
Minorities are just people.

208
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,150
People like us.

209
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,650
I can see that I've lost you a bit.

210
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,350
So tell you what? We're gonna forget about Mr. Huxley today...

211
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,850
...and we're gonna talk about fear.

212
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,190
Fear, after all, is our real enemy.

213
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,920
Fear is taking over our world.

214
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,750
Fear is being used as a tool of manipulation in our society.

215
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,110
It's how politicians peddle policy.

216
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,710
It's how Madison Avenue sells us

217
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,140
things that we don't need.

218
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,280
Think about it.

219
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,350
Fear of being attacked.

220
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,160
Fear of that there are communists lurking around every corner.

221
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,800
Fear of that some little Caribbean country...

222
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,250
...that doesn't believe in our way of life

223
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,390
poses a threat to us.

224
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,770
Fear that black culture may take over the world.

225
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:18,150
Fear of Elvis Presley's hips.

226
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,930
Actually, maybe that one is a real fear.

227
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,550
Fear that our bad breath might ruin our friendships.

228
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:33,280
Fear of growing old and being alone.

229
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,800
The of that we're useless and that no one cares what we have to say.

230
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,600
Have a good weekend.

231
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,510
Sir! May I talk to you for a minute?

232
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,550
Why don't you always talk to us like that?

233
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,170
I don't think it went over very well.

234
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,890
Man, fear of things gets to me all the time.

235
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,890
But you can't talk about it with anyone or you just sound like a fool.

236
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,540
You can't even talk about it with Lois?

237
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,710
I don't think she's afraid of anything.

238
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,230
Everyone's afraid of something, Kenny.

239
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,850
What are you afraid of, sir?

240
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,430
Cars.

241
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,570
How can you live in Los Angeles and be afraid of cars?

242
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,770
Maybe you can't.

243
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,840
Sometimes my fear of things can almost paralyze me.

244
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,030
It's like I get really panic stricken

245
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,020
and I feel like I might explode or something.

246
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,200
May I ask you a personal question, sir?

247
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,140
If you like.

248
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,270
Do you ever get high?

249
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,040
How old do I look to you?

250
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
Have you ever taken any drugs?

251
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,110
Of course, Kenny.

252
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:44,950
Like what?

253
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:46,970
I don't feel I should be discussing

254
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,260
this with you on campus Mr. Potter.

255
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,330
It's the only way I get by sometimes.

256
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,910
Have you ever tried mescaline?

257
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,670
Not my drug of choice.

258
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,680
I shaved off one of my eyebrows once on mescaline.

259
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,170
Not a good look for me.

260
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,590
Sir?        I looked in the mirror.

261
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,690
Big mistake if you're high on mescaline.

262
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,440
I decided that my eyebrows were taking over my face.

263
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,770
Before I knew it, I had shaved one off.

264
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,790
I wore a band-aid over my eye

265
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,530
for about six weeks while my brow grew back.

266
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,370
Very embarrassing.

267
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,380
You didn't take it again after that?

268
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,510
Kenny, have you been listening to me?

269
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,510
I shaved off my eyebrow.

270
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,430
I wanted an experience Mr. Potter,

271
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,100
not a career on stage.

272
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,040
If you ever want to get high sir, I usually have some dope.

273
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,940
You're really mad aren't you?

274
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,320
I'm sorry, sir.

275
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,840
I guess you don't feel very comfortable talking like this.

276
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,110
What makes you say that?

277
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,600
Lois thinks you're kind of cagey. Like this morning...

278
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:44,430
...when you were listening to

279
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,610
all that crap we were talking about Huxley.

280
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,920
Well, not all of you.

281
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,780
I didn't notice you open your mouth once.

282
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,990
I was watching you.

283
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,590
You let us ramble on and on

284
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,600
and then you straighten us out.

285
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,200
But you never really tell us everything you know about something.

286
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,340
Well, maybe that's true up to a point.

287
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,390
It's not that I want to be cagey.

288
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:11,450
It's just that I can't really discuss things completely openly...

289
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,170
...at school.

290
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,760
Someone would misunderstand.

291
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,150
I tried that today. It didn't really work out.

292
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,590
What was it you wanted to get, sir?

293
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,850
Nothing. I was on my way to the dean's office.

294
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,210
You mean you walked all the way down here just to talk to me?

295
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,140
Why not?        Well...

296
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,170
I think you deserve something for that, sir.

297
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,390
Here sir, take your pick.

298
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,450
It's on me.        Thank you.

299
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,340
I thought you'd probably pick blue.

300
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,960
Why blue?

301
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,910
Isn't blue supposed to be spiritual?

302
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
What makes you think I'm spiritual?

303
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,580
And you? Red?

304
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,160
What is red stand for?        A lot of things.

305
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,820
Rage, lust.

306
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,210
No kidding?

307
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,040
Well sir, I...

308
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,210
I guess I see you around.

309
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,330
Hello?

310
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,860
What are you up to, kiddo?

311
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:41,310
Just trying to finish up a book. How's your day going?

312
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,220
Fine.

313
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,540
I was just leaving school

314
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,500
and wanted to know if you needed anything for tonight.

315
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,960
Thanks, you're sweet.

316
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,190
But I think I'm all set.

317
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,470
Be a darling and...

318
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,590
...pick up gin for me, Tangueray.

319
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,240
I love the color of the bottle.

320
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,210
You love what's in it. What time do you want me?

321
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,770
7 would be great if that's ok with you.

322
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,950
Perfect. I'll see you then.

323
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,040
I'll see you then. Bye, Geo.

324
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,050
Bye, kiddo.

325
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,260
Beautiful.

326
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,490
Yes, Mr. Potter?

327
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,970
Are you going somewhere, sir?

328
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,840
That is usually why people get into their cars.

329
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,070
No, I mean are you going on vacation or something?

330
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:35,850
What?

331
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,630
I saw you cleaning out your office.

332
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,160
What exactly is it that you want, Kenny?

333
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,930
I was just hoping that perhaps

334
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,320
we could get together for a drink or something sometime.

335
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,290
Why is that?

336
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,880
I don't know, sir.

337
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,570
Because I think you might like it. And...

338
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,380
...because you seem as though you could use a friend.

339
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,740
Oh really?        Yes, sir. You do.

340
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,600
They may be right.

341
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,410
It will have to be another time. I'm late.

342
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,950
But thank you for the invitation.

343
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,680
And thank you for the talk earlier.

344
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,930
And stay away from the mescaline.

345
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,410
Hello, Mr. Falconer.

346
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:58,540
Hello. How are you today?        I'm fine, sir.

347
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,890
Do you need to get into your box?        Yes, I do.

348
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,100
Follow me.

349
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,840
Here you are, sir.

350
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,860
If you could please sign here...

351
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,500
Thank you.        Thank you.

352
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,760
So explain your friend Charlotte to me.

353
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,650
What would you like to know?

354
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,010
I don't know. You seem very intimate I guess.

355
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,900
Like you were once together or something.

356
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,930
You haven't slept with her, have you?        Yes.

357
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:49,470
And?

358
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,070
A few times when we were young.

359
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,040
I wouldn't say that it meant nothing to me...

360
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:57,120
...but it certainly meant a great deal more to Charley.

361
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
It was a long time ago in London.

362
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,820
I love Charley.

363
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,620
And We were very close friends but that's all.

364
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,790
Well, I'm confused.

365
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,690
If you sleep with women then why are you with me?

366
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,440
Because I fall in love with men.

367
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,360
Because I fell in love with you.

368
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,640
Anyway, doesn't everyone sleep with women when they're young?

369
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,960
I haven't.        You're joking.

370
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,200
No, I'm not.

371
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,070
It was just never anything that interested me.

372
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,900
Well, you're awfully

373
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,110
modern aren't you?

374
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:29,990
You know, I think that was the first thing that I noticed about you...

375
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,850
...was how sure of yourself you were.

376
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,990
How can you be so sure about everything at your age?

377
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,180
You think I'm sure of myself?

378
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,930
Of course, you are.

379
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,140
I'm finished now. Thank you.

380
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,230
Yes, Mr. Falconer?

381
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,290
Is there something else we can help you with today?

382
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,890
I can't find my check book and I need some cash.

383
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,230
Not my day I'm afraid. Excuse me a minute.

384
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,680
Mommy says bushy eyebrows are pedestrian,

385
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,050
but I think yours are pretty.

386
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,910
I think yours are pretty too.

387
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,980
Why do you look so sad?

388
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:26,110
Would you like to meet Charlton Heston?

389
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,830
Ben Hur.

390
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,760
He's our scorpion.

391
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,780
Every night we throw in something new to him and watch him kill it.

392
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:39,110
Daddy says it's like the colosseum.

393
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,770
So my brother Tom put on all the columns in here.

394
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,130
He wants to be a set designer.

395
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,240
He hasn't eaten the spider yet...

396
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,130
...cause he's still full from the moth we gave him last night.

397
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,410
Daddy says he wants to throw you in to the colosseum.

398
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,290
No kidding? Why?

399
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,410
He says you're light in your loafers...

400
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,780
...but you aren't even wearing loafers.

401
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,250
I think my brother Tom is light in his loafers too...

402
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,730
...but he wears Keds.

403
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,510
He made me do a hair conditioning treatment on my hair with eggs.

404
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,500
Does it look shiny?

405
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Sweetheart, what are you doing bothering Mr. Falconer?

406
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,350
She's not bothering me at all Susan. How are you?

407
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,460
I'm glad to see you George.

408
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,700
George, we're having a few people over tonight for drinks...

409
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,670
...and would love to have you join us if you could.

410
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,820
Thank you. That's very kind of you but I have plans.

411
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,330
Another time then.

412
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,400
Jennifer, let's let Mr. Falconer get back to his banking.

413
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,350
Goodbye, George.

414
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,340
Bye, Susan. Bye, Jennifer.

415
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,630
May I help you, sir?

416
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,280
I'd like to buy some bullets for this gun, please.

417
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,810
Yes, sir. This is a really old gun, sir.

418
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,890
We have a two for one sale on handguns at the moment.

419
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,380
Perhaps one for the little lady?

420
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,950
No thank you. Just the bullets, please.

421
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,510
Here you go. Anything else?

422
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,900
No, thank you.

423
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,530
That would be $2.29, sir.

424
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,900
Thank you.

425
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm sorry. I hope she didn't growl at you.

426
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:51,740
She goes a little crazy sometimes when I have to leave her in the car.

427
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:53,270
She's perfect. What's her name?

428
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,390
India.

429
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,130
Let's go there.

430
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,330
You little baby.

431
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,910
I used to have smooth fox terriers. You don't see them very often.

432
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:32,230
The very smell of buttered toast.

433
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,640
She's still a puppy isn't she?

434
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,710
Well.

435
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,750
Have a nice evening.        You too.

436
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,410
Good night, India.

437
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,910
I'm sorry about that.        No, It's ok.

438
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,940
It's my fault. I'll get you another pack.

439
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,400
It's ok. Don't worry.

440
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,690
No, no I insist.

441
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,410
Thank you.

442
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,530
I'm sorry about the broken glass.

443
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,920
Here you go.        Thanks man.

444
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,980
You want one?

445
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,780
No, thanks.

446
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,870
Actually, yes. Why not?

447
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,250
Thank you.

448
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,650
Carlos.        What did you say?

449
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:02,150
Carlos. You asked me my name.

450
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,280
Are you okay?

451
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,060
Yeah.

452
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:07,850
Yeah, I'm sorry.

453
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,880
You're really something.

454
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,680
You have an incredible face.

455
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,230
Enjoy that. It's a great gift.

456
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,520
Your Spanish is perfect.

457
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:21,330
Thank you.

458
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:26,850
I should have used it more.

459
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:28,620
Well...

460
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,130
It's not too late.

461
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,170
What are you doing?

462
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,680
Aren't we going somewhere?

463
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,620
No. But, thanks.

464
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,170
You know, it's the smog

465
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:11,590
that makes it that color.

466
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,780
I've never seen a sky like this before.

467
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,360
Sometimes awful things have their own kind of beauty.

468
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,320
Could I have another cigarette?

469
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,620
Sure.

470
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,660
Are sure that you don't want to go for a drive?        I'm sure.

471
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,990
Where are you from?        Madrid.

472
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,530
Madrid? How did you get here?

473
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:07,260
It's a long story.

474
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,110
I met a guy from LA at the hotel where I worked...

475
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,890
...who told me

476
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,300
I could live with him and that he could get me an agent.

477
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,450
But he never realized that I have a Spanish accent.

478
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:21,210
I like your accent. You speak very well.

479
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,060
How did you learn English?

480
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,600
My mom had an American boyfriend when I was little.

481
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:29,110
Is your mother in Madrid?

482
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,080
Yes, she is. She cuts hair.

483
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,910
She cut my hair before I left.

484
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:35,410
Do you like it?

485
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,540
I thought it made me look like James Dean.

486
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,110
You are better than James Dean.

487
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:41,740
Really?

488
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:42,660
Thanks.

489
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,870
No one has ever picked me up and not wanted something.

490
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,810
I think you picked me up.

491
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,370
This is kind of a serious day for me.

492
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,520
Come on. What could be so serious for a guy like you?

493
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,570
I'm just trying to get over an old love I guess.

494
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,580
My mother says that lovers are like buses.

495
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:12,980
You just have to wait a little while and another one comes along.

496
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,750
I have to go.

497
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:22,800
You're a nice guy.

498
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,490
I hope you find...

499
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,790
...someone like you.

500
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:27,380
Thanks.

501
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:29,390
I'm going away.

502
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,280
It's your turn to change it.

503
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,180
Yeah, I'm not changing it. It's your turn.

504
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,730
Besides, you never like what I put on anyway.

505
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,240
I'll give you five dollars if you change it. I'm too old to get up.

506
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,660
You're only old when it's convenient for you to be old.

507
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:39,350
What are you reading anyway?

508
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,230
Metamorphosis

509
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:43,010
Oh God. Not that depressing crap again.

510
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,210
It's for my class.

511
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,610
What highbrow work of fiction might you be reading?

512
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,060
Breakfast at Tiffany's

513
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,860
Don't be so smug.

514
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,230
Man, what a life he has.

515
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,660
Don't you just envy him?        Why?

516
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,490
Because he can sniff anyone's arse he wants?

517
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,290
Nice.

518
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,800
No, because he just does what he wants. Like yesterday...

519
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:12,420
...I was standing in the front yard and Susan came over to talk.

520
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,180
And that little brat of hers Christopher came...

521
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,430
...running over waving that damned gun of his around.

522
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,700
And our little dog walked right up, hiked his leg...

523
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,930
...and peed all over Christopher's new tennis shoes.

524
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,820
All over Christopher actually.

525
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,350
And of course, I had to act like I was upset

526
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:32,120
It was so perfectly executed you should have seen it.

527
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,790
After all the times those kids have tortured that poor dog.

528
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,770
I mean, you should take a lesson from him. They don't...

529
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,540
They don't stay up all night worrying.

530
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:41,850
They figured out

531
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,380
how to get the two of us to do exactly what they want.

532
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:45,470
They are basically

533
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,190
very sophisticated little parasites when you think about it.

534
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,790
Well, the dumbest creatures are the happiest.

535
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,940
Just look at your mother.

536
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:57,810
He's really just living the moment.

537
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,880
It's like now.

538
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,620
What could be better than being tucked up here with you?

539
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,180
If I died right now it would be OK.

540
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,760
Well, it wouldn't be OK with me

541
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,840
so why don't you shut up and go change the record.

542
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,920
Good answer.

543
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,690
You know what? I was thinking about taking them up...

544
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,000
...to Denver with me next week if it's okay with you.

545
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,650
It's my mom. She loves them.

546
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,420
Probably that recognition of a similar mind.

547
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,800
You stay there, old man.

548
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:08,740
Tie in a windsor.

549
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,310
No, I did not forget the gin. I'll see you in ten minutes.

550
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,660
Christopher, would you like it if I killed you?

551
00:53:02,670 --> 00:53:03,700
I don't know.

552
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:06,110
If you keep this up we're going to find out.

553
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,520
So, why don't you go home and stop shooting people?

554
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:40,930
I'm so happy to see you.

555
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,730
Come on in.

556
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,590
It smells wonderful. I'm very hungry. Where is Lois?

557
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:55,180
I gave her the night off. I'm cooking myself.

558
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,410
You are?        Yes, I'm trying something new.

559
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,090
Charley darling, "you cooking' is new.

560
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,040
Don't be smart.

561
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,680
I'm in a good mood tonight. I'm going to be fun.

562
00:54:02,690 --> 00:54:05,270
I've already made two New Year's resolutions.

563
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,690
Resolution one: No more talk that of awful ex-husbands...

564
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,480
..and children who don't give a damn.

565
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:12,280
And the other one?        One what?

566
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,400
Resolution.

567
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,870
Resolution two:

568
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,290
More smoking and more drinking and screw it all! So come on...

569
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,660
...mix me up a drink.

570
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,380
I'll have a gin and tonic, please.

571
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:24,420
And watch out baby!        Coming up.

572
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:30,610
It was sweet of you to come tonight.

573
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,220
Sweet had nothing to do with it.

574
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,850
I needed to see you.      Oh,Geo. Come off it.

575
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,060
Whenever you do something sweet you're too ashamed to admit it.

576
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,020
Here is to our early New Year's resolutions.

577
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:48,670
Cheers.

578
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,290
What are your resolutions by the way?

579
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,260
To let go of the past completely, entirely, and forever.

580
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:02,060
Light me up, will you?

581
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:12,410
Darling, you don't look well.

582
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,340
Do you remember that little heart attack you had last year?

583
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:16,050
It wasn't a heart attack.

584
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:17,360
Well whatever it was darling...

585
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:19,310
...you don't look so hot.

586
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,430
I'm fine. I never felt better.

587
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,680
I'm a little tired. I haven't been sleeping...

588
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:26,160
Geo, it's normal.

589
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,650
You were with Jim for 16 years.

590
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,390
I think about Richard every day.

591
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,710
It's hard being alone.

592
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,360
At least you have a job and a life.

593
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,870
Let's have a bit of dinner shall we?

594
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,230
Because I've worked so very hard.

595
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:47,530
What are you talking about?

596
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,480
Seriously, there no such thing as old anymore.

597
00:55:49,490 --> 00:55:52,620
The other day one of my students has called me a senior citizen.

598
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,260
I wouldn't mind if old didn't exist...

599
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,100
...but I'm not sure senior is what I'm aiming for either.

600
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,470
It's all becoming so bland.

601
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,760
It's not why I came to America.

602
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:03,170
It's like a complete breakdown of culture and manners.

603
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:04,990
The young ones have no manners.

604
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,260
The other day at the car wash

605
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,530
a young man looked me up and down...

606
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,380
...and actually asked me if I was a natural blonde.

607
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,900
What did you say?        I looked him straight in the eye...

608
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:17,600
...and said: "Let's just say if I stood on my head...

609
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:19,800
...I would be a natural brunette with lovely breath.

610
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,620
You didn't!        I did!

611
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,610
And the amusing thing was that it went right over his head!

612
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,380
You know, you had a mouth on you even back in London.

613
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:32,980
Do you remember that old lesbian who threw her drink over your head...

614
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,260
...because you asked her if she was hung like a donut.

615
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:47,440
Geo.

616
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:50,200
We could always go back to London. The two of us.

617
00:56:50,210 --> 00:56:53,170
No, thanks.        You know you miss it.

618
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,520
I miss it sometimes.

619
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:57,050
Maybe if Jim had lived.

620
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,970
He loved being in England.

621
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,630
He asked us to stay the last time we were there.

622
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:02,510
Do you really think you would have moved?

623
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,550
I don't know. It's silly to even talk about it. It was only a fantasy.

624
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,090
What's this?

625
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:19,330
It's my mother's wedding ring.

626
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,360
I found it a drawer when I was cleaning out.

627
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,050
Charley my dear, you and I are both in need of another drink.

628
00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:02,070
Wait! Wait, wait!

629
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,200
I love this!

630
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:15,430
You're insane!        Come on, old man!

631
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:32,700
Don't move.

632
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,310
Thank you.

633
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,360
Very smooth cigarette move.        I've always wanted to do that.

634
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,140
You don't even smoke.

635
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,360
Well, not for the last sixteen years. Jim hated it.

636
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:04,970
What's to stop me now? It's not as if he's gonna to kill me.

637
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:14,930
This is so nice, lying here with you.

638
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:18,380
Don't you ever miss this?

639
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:21,320
What we could have been to each other?

640
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,950
Having a real relationship and kids?

641
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:32,300
I had Jim.        I know, but I mean a real relationship.

642
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:34,350
Geo, let's be honest,

643
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,160
what you and Jim had together was wonderful but...

644
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:41,380
...wasn't it really just a substitute for something else?

645
01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,450
Is that really what you think after all of these years?

646
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:53,020
You think Jim was just some kind of substitute for real love?

647
01:01:57,030 --> 01:02:00,510
Jim was not a substitute for anything.

648
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,430
Do you understand?

649
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:04,970
There is no substitute for Jim...

650
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,050
...anywhere!

651
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,440
And by the way, what is so real about your relationship with Richard?

652
01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:11,560
He left you after nine years!

653
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,310
Jim and I were together for sixteen years!

654
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,260
And if he hadn't died we would still be together!

655
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,230
What the hell is not real about that?

656
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,340
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

657
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:23,610
I know how much the two of you loved each other.

658
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,160
I suppose I'm just jealous that you and I never had that kind of love.

659
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,190
Actually, I've never had that kind of love with anybody.

660
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,800
I don't think Richard ever loved me...

661
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,189
...except for the way I looked.

662
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,990
And Clay...

663
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:44,350
I don't know. You raise a child and love it...

664
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,250
...and then when they are old enough they just leave.

665
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,180
Charley, there is nothing wrong with your life.

666
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,560
You just like feeling sorry for yourself.

667
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,830
It's one of your great pleasures.

668
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,030
And it's not one of yours?

669
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,910
You're as pathetic as I am.

670
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,640
Feeling sorry for myself is definitely not one of my great pleasures.

671
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,990
Well, it's not one of mine either.

672
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,890
I don't like feeling sorry for myself one bit.

673
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,700
I tried to hold onto Richard for so long...

674
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:05,670
...even when it was obvious to everyone but me that it was over.

675
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,210
And now Clay is grown up.

676
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,880
I mean, what am I doing here Geo? Tell me, what?

677
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,370
You have plenty of friends. You'll be fine.

678
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:14,540
Yes, I have friends. But none of them need me.

679
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:15,380
And yes I have you

680
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:18,220
and if you weren't such a goddamn poof we could have all been happy!

681
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,730
I only have you now because you lost Jim.

682
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,300
Soon I'll lose you to someone else.

683
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:29,870
It's not as easy for a woman.

684
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,680
I've done everything the way I was supposed to and...

685
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:34,020
...all I have to keep me company is a bottle of gin.

686
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,420
Maybe you should try donuts with your gin.

687
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,790
Screw you.

688
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,690
Charlotte, you are dramatic.

689
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,910
I swear you really almost had me.

690
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,630
A tiny tear was beginning to form in the corner of my eye.

691
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:50,810
Now stop it.

692
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:54,490
You are still breathtakingly beautiful.

693
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,330
When you can be bothered to get up and out of bed...

694
01:03:57,340 --> 01:03:59,510
...and you stop whimpering about everything for five minutes.

695
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:03,990
Go to London. Change your life.

696
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,370
If you're not happy being a woman then stop acting like one.

697
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,080
You have all the answers.

698
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,900
No, I don't have any to mention.

699
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,110
If you're so smart why don't you have something new in your life?

700
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:15,640
Take that position at Stanford.

701
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:17,230
You complain about that little school

702
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,760
but you could go anywhere you want.

703
01:04:18,770 --> 01:04:20,360
I think what I've done has been worthwhile.

704
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,350
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

705
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,580
I shouldn't have said that.

706
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,720
As much as I dread it, I think I will go back to London.

707
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,780
Why do you dread it?

708
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,510
When I lived in London last I was young.

709
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:34,180
I was fresh, I was everything.

710
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,360
Coming to America was such a dream, it was the icing on the cake.

711
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:40,960
Going home is defeat.

712
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,780
None of it really worked out the way I'd planned.

713
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,270
Most things don't work out the way people plan.

714
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,760
You're just living in the past.

715
01:04:49,770 --> 01:04:51,520
You need to start thinking about your future.

716
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,070
Living in the past is my future.

717
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,820
It doesn't have to be yours. You're a man.

718
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,730
And you're a bore tonight.

719
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:05,790
Can't we just feel sorry for ourselves a little bit longer?

720
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,090
Let's have another drink.

721
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,340
I don't think so. I have to go.

722
01:05:09,350 --> 01:05:10,140
Come on. Walk me out.        Please, please!

723
01:05:10,150 --> 01:05:13,780
Come on, I have to!        No, this was such fun! No.

724
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:23,750
When will I see you again?

725
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,150
Aren't you going to England?        I'll never do that!

726
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,100
It's far too much effort.

727
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,020
Besides,

728
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:37,060
I don't think Jim would want me to leave you here in LA all alone.

729
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:39,010
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

730
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,400
I've got all the answers. Remember?

731
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,740
What are you doing this weekend?

732
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:46,230
I think I might just be very quiet.

733
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,870
You never really did take me seriously, did you George?

734
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:55,360
I tried to Charley. Remember? A long time ago.

735
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,660
It didn't really work out, did it?

736
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:01,930
No, Charley.

737
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:09,800
Sleep tight.

738
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:55,780
Patrick, a beer and a packet of Lucky Strike, please.

739
01:07:38,830 --> 01:07:39,610
Excuse me.

740
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:55,950
It's too hot in there.

741
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,960
Yes, it is.

742
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:01,270
Would you like a cigarette?        No thanks, I don't smoke.

743
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:06,350
This place is really crowded.        Well, it is Saturday night.

744
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,570
It's usually as bad as this.

745
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,720
People normally just stop by and pick someone up

746
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,140
and then head on down the beach.

747
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:14,530
Yeah. It's pretty wild out there.

748
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,810
I'm surprised the cops don't break it up.

749
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,010
Is it always like that?        Since the war ended.

750
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,310
It's pretty great actually. It's kind of pagan.

751
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,250
I'm Jim.        I'm George.

752
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,150
Pleased to meet you Jim.

753
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,440
I'm sorry, I'm supposed to meet some friends but I can't find them.

754
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,440
I just needed to get out of the house

755
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,710
but the lure of a cold beer got to me.

756
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:37,630
Do you live hereby?

757
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:38,570
Canyon.

758
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,390
For how long?        Since 38.

759
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,570
Where are you from?        Colorado.

760
01:08:44,910 --> 01:08:48,500
I really like it here. It's close to beach.

761
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,540
I think I might stay after I'm discharged.

762
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:56,060
I don't know, maybe I'm a bit of a pagan.

763
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,770
After you.        No.

764
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:08,860
Sorry.

765
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,920
Well, hello.        Hi.

766
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,270
Do you buy me a drink?

767
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,290
I think I'm taken.

768
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:30,270
Too bad, too bad.

769
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,830
Do you want another beer?

770
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,560
Patrick, a bottle of scotch and a pack of Lucky Strikes to go, please?

771
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,100
Patrick, cancel that.

772
01:10:55,730 --> 01:10:57,030
Well, hello Mr. Potter.

773
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:58,840
Hello, sir.

774
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:03,080
What are we drinking?        Scotch.

775
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:04,990
Okay.

776
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:12,530
I come here all the time.

777
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,560
I live just around the corner, but then you knew that.

778
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:16,940
On Camphor Tree Lane.

779
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:24,760
You're still carrying that around.

780
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,940
One must always appreciate life's little gifts.

781
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,840
So, what are you doing here?

782
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,530
Just out for a ride on my bike.        Is that all?

783
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:40,350
I don't know.

784
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:41,930
Were you looking for me?

785
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:45,070
Maybe. I don't know.

786
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,590
I feel like my head's stopped up with stuff.

787
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,830
What kind of stuff?

788
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,970
Like, the stuff you were talking about today in class.

789
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,720
That is definitely not important.

790
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:55,210
No, it is important. Your class is great.

791
01:11:55,220 --> 01:11:59,230
But somehow we always seem to get stuck talking about the past.

792
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,370
The past just doesn't matter to me.

793
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:05,130
The present?        I can't wait for the present to be over.

794
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:07,120
It's a total drag.

795
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:10,100
Well, tonight is the exception.

796
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:12,370
What?

797
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,480
Tonight, yes! The present, no!

798
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,250
Let's drink to tonight.

799
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,600
Tonight.

800
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,320
So if the past doesn't matter and the present is a total drag.

801
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:25,370
What about the future?

802
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,010
What future? Cuba might just blow us up.

803
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:31,050
Death is the future.

804
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,410
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be depressing.

805
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,620
It's not depressing. It's not depressing, it's true.

806
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:38,300
It may not be your immediate future but it's what we all share.

807
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,560
Death is the future.

808
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:42,920
You're right, I guess.

809
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:45,770
If one is not enjoying one's present there isn't a great deal to...

810
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,550
...suggest that the future should be any better.

811
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:49,820
Yeah, I've thought that before.

812
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,970
But the thing is you just never know.

813
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:55,760
Look at tonight.

814
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:01,360
Actually...

815
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,000
...I feel really alone most of the time.

816
01:13:04,970 --> 01:13:06,580
You do?        Yeah.

817
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:08,630
I've always felt this way.

818
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:11,660
I mean we're born alone, we die alone.

819
01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:13,500
And while we're here

820
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:16,860
we are absolutely, completely sealed in our own bodies.

821
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,600
Really weird.

822
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:21,850
Kinda freaks me out to think about it.

823
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,440
We can only experience the outside world

824
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:27,390
through our own slanted perception of it.

825
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:31,040
Who knows what you're really like?

826
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,370
I just see what I think you're like.

827
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:36,000
I'm exactly what I appear to be.

828
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:39,550
If you look closely.

829
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,220
You know the only thing that has made the whole thing worthwhile...

830
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,490
...has been those...

831
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,100
...few times

832
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:56,230
that I've been able to really, truly connect with another human being.

833
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:01,700
I had a hunch about you, sir.

834
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:03,840
You did?        Yes, sir.

835
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,890
I had a hunch you might be a real romantic.

836
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:15,240
You know, everyone keeps telling you that...

837
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,000
...when you're older, that you'll have all this experience.

838
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,540
Like it's some great thing.

839
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:21,130
That's a load of shit.

840
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:23,690
I think I've actually just gotten sillier and sillier.

841
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,660
Really?        Absolutely.

842
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:29,040
So, all your experience is useless.

843
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,490
No, I wouldn't say that.

844
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:34,090
As our friend Mr. Huxley says:

845
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:35,570
Experience is not what happens to a man.

846
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,750
It is what a man does with what happens to him.

847
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,260
Let's go swimming.        Okay.

848
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:46,050
What?        It was a test.

849
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:48,350
I thought you were bluffing about being silly so...

850
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,280
...I said to myself I'll suggest

851
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,930
doing something completely outrageous.

852
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,300
And if he resists, if he even hesitates

853
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:57,850
then I know he's full of shit.

854
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,280
Well, I wasn't. Were you?

855
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,190
Hell, no!

856
01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:23,550
Come on sir. I'll help you down.

857
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,200
Let's go.

858
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,380
Come on, sir.

859
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,290
Sir?

860
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,170
Sir?

861
01:16:58,420 --> 01:16:59,780
That's enough for now, sir.

862
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,960
I'm fine.        I'm cold. Come on.

863
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,550
Can we go back to your place, sir?

864
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,420
Of course. Where else?

865
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,600
Where else.        Are you out of your mind?

866
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,470
What's the matter?        You can't get home like that!

867
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,180
We're invisible, don't you know that?

868
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:34,830
You know sir, they ought not to let you out on your own.

869
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:36,790
You're liable to get into real trouble.

870
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,460
I excel at it.

871
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,580
Your forehead is bleeding.

872
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,750
The bathroom is just down the hall if you would like to take a shower.

873
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,890
Aren't you taking a shower too, sir?

874
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,550
I'm fine. I'm English. We like to be cold and wet.

875
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:15,750
First, I think that we need to take care of that cut, sir.

876
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,190
Do you have any band-aids?

877
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,500
Going camping, sir?        I'm fine, really.

878
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,180
Stay there. I'll be right back.

879
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:10,600
Sit up.

880
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,100
Tilt your head back.

881
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:40,690
Well sir, I'm afraid this time you don't have...

882
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,080
...the excuse of mescaline to explain your band-aid.

883
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,560
I think we should get you out of those wet clothes.

884
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,390
Yes, sir.

885
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,930
You're not too cold?        I'm great.

886
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:27,100
Would you like a drink?        A beer, sir. If you have one.

887
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:29,360
I'm afraid that's all we have.

888
01:21:29,900 --> 01:21:31,050
Two beers coming up.

889
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:46,310
You live here all by yourself, sir?

890
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,020
I do now.

891
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:50,280
I used to share this place with a friend. He was an architect.

892
01:21:50,970 --> 01:21:54,280
Man, guys my age dream about the kind of setup you've got here.

893
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:56,960
I mean, what more can you want?

894
01:21:56,970 --> 01:22:00,170
You get to be left alone and come and go as you please.

895
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:03,880
Is that's your idea of the perfect life?

896
01:22:03,890 --> 01:22:05,950
What's the matter, sir? Don't you believe me?

897
01:22:06,460 --> 01:22:08,430
If you're so keen on the idea living by yourself...

898
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:10,130
...where does Lois fit into this plan?

899
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:13,380
Lois? What's she got to do with anything?

900
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:16,190
I got the impression that you and she were together.

901
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:22,830
Not really. She is kind of cool and...

902
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,250
...we're good friends but...

903
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,150
I think what you really want to ask me is if we sleep together.

904
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:33,200
And do you?        We did. Once.

905
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:34,530
Why only once?

906
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:37,260
I didn't say only once, I said once.

907
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:40,890
Come on, the last thing I want to talk about right now is Lois.

908
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:42,650
What time is it?

909
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,990
My watch seems to have stopped.

910
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,800
Do you want me to go?

911
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,850
You must be kidding. Go, get us another beer.

912
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,870
Is that an order, sir?

913
01:23:04,220 --> 01:23:05,450
You're damn right it is.

914
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:17,610
Pathetic.

915
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:20,890
Did you say something, sir?

916
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:26,620
Why are you here?

917
01:23:29,230 --> 01:23:34,330
Why did you get to the office and ask secretary for my address?

918
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:40,560
I just wanted to see you someplace other than school.

919
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:42,390
Why?

920
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:47,620
Sometimes I think I'm crazy

921
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:49,760
cause I see things so differently than everyone else.

922
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,370
I feel like I can talk to you.

923
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,050
To be honest sir, I was also worried about you today.

924
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:02,460
Me?

925
01:24:03,830 --> 01:24:05,050
What's to be worried about?

926
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:07,390
I'm fine.

927
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:17,590
I'm...

928
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,340
I'm fine.

929
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:02,680
A few times in my life I've had moments of absolute clarity.

930
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,010
When for a few brief seconds...

931
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,130
...the silence drowns out the noise...

932
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:13,400
...and I can feel rather than think.

933
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:16,560
And things seem so sharp...

934
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:19,290
And the world seems so fresh...

935
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:23,470
...as though it had all just come into existence.

936
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:45,360
I can never make these moments last.

937
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,520
I cling to them...

938
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:49,210
...but like everything they fade.

939
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:53,440
I've lived my live on these moments.

940
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,810
They pull me back to the present...

941
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,680
...and I realize that

942
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,020
everything is exactly the way it was meant to be.

943
01:30:18,140 --> 01:30:21,590
And just like that it came.
