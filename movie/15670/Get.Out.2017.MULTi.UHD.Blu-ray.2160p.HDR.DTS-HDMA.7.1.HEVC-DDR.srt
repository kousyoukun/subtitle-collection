00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,203
(CHUCKLES)

163
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,081
Get that headlight fixed.

164
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:10,624
And that mirror.

165
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,127
Thank you, Officer.

166
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:23,304
What?

167
00:13:23,512 --> 00:13:24,930
That was hot.

168
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,808
Well, I'm not gonna
let anyone fuck with my man.

169
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,936
I see that.
Okay.

170
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,148
We're here.

171
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,501
It's the groundskeeper.

172
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,176
Are you ready?

173
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:14,605
ROSE: Hi!

174
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,856
My little girl!
Come here!

175
00:14:17,024 --> 00:14:19,902
How are you? I love you too.
I missed you.

176
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:21,529
This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

177
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,072
Call me Mr. Armitage.

178
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,382
CHRIS: Of course.
How you doin'?

179
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,368
I'm kiddin'! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

180
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:29,036
How are ya?
I'm good. How are you?

181
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,538
We're huggers.
Yes.

182
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,864
This is my mom.
This is Chris.

183
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,374
Hi, welcome.

184
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,583
(LAUGHING)

185
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,377
Nice to meet you.

186
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,295
Your father gets
really excited, but...

187
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,923
Anyway, yeah.
I'm Missy.

188
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,051
Yes. Come on in. Please, welcome.
Inside.

189
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,595
(CHATTERING)

190
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,225
So how was your drive in?

191
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,852
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

192
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,563
What?
Oh, no.

193
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,064
Is it dead?
Yeah.

194
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,066
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

195
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,277
Yeah.
It just fruck us out.

196
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:02,361
It did?

197
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,381
CHRIS: Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

198
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:07,116
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

199
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:10,578
Frucking weird. Well, you
know what I say? (LAUGHING)

200
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,455
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

201
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:14,540
Dean.
Dad.

202
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,893
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

203
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,087
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

204
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,631
They're like rats. They're
destroying the ecosystem.

205
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:25,068
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

206
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,427
"That's a start."

207
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:28,262
I don't even
understand that.

208
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,388
I'm sorry.
I'm just sayin'.

209
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,725
You know what, I am grateful
for what you've done today.

210
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,268
(SIGHS)
I don't like 'em.

211
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:35,519
We got that.

212
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,645
Okay.
Yeah.

213
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:39,815
All right, you guys
look so wiped out.

214
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,609
Yeah, a little.
Yeah.

215
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:45,279
So how long has this
been going on? This...

216
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,780
This thang?

217
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:47,906
(DEAN SNICKERING)

218
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:49,908
How long?

219
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:51,827
(LAUGHING) Four months.

220
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:53,579
Four months?

221
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:56,498
Mmm.
Five months, actually.

222
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,626
She's right, I'm wrong.

223
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,961
Attaboy. Better get
used to saying that.

224
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,254
(LAUGHING)

225
00:16:03,297 --> 00:16:04,757
Please, I'm so sorry.

226
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,967
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

227
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:08,594
(SNICKERS) See?

228
00:16:09,011 --> 00:16:11,138
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

229
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:12,785
DEAN: I know.
I wanna give you a tour.

230
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,642
They just got...
Can we unpack first?

231
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,311
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

232
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,608
This is Missy's office. She
takes appointments in there.

233
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,068
She's a therapist,
right?

234
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,319
Psychiatrist, yeah.

235
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:26,737
Turns out people up here

236
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,632
are just as messed up in the
head as they are in the city.

237
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:29,907
This is Jeremy.

238
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,284
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

239
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,161
CHRIS: I've heard stories.

240
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,663
DEAN: Yeah, I bet you have.

241
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:39,208
He's studying medicine now. Wants
to be just like his old man.

242
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,959
You'll meet him.
All right. Cool.

243
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,004
I picked these up in Bali.

244
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,387
It's pretty eclectic. I'm a
traveler and I can't help it.

245
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,182
I keep bringing
souvenirs back.

246
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,726
It's such
a privilege to be able

247
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,395
to experience
another person's culture.

248
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,840
You know what I'm saying?
Mmm-hmm.

249
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,691
Oh, you're gonna
love this.

250
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:05,401
My dad's claim to fame.

251
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:07,611
He was beat by Jesse Owens

252
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:11,198
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

253
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,385
Those are the ones where...
Owens won in front of Hitler.

254
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:14,952
Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

255
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,540
I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

256
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:20,874
This black dude
comes along,

257
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:23,085
proves him wrong in front
of the entire world.

258
00:17:23,252 --> 00:17:24,420
Amazing.

259
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:25,879
Tough break for
your dad though.

260
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,131
Yeah.

261
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,591
He almost got over it.

262
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:30,843
(CHUCKLES)

263
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,971
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

264
00:17:34,138 --> 00:17:35,973
We got some black
mold down there.

265
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,102
My mother loved her kitchen, so
we keep a piece of her in here.

266
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,815
Georgina, this is Chris.
This is Rose's boyfriend.

267
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:45,899
Hi.

268
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,026
Hello.

269
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,613
DEAN: The garbage goes
under the sink,

270
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,243
and now for the
<i>pièce de résistance,</i>

271
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:02,750
the field of play.

272
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,586
I love it.

273
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:08,630
The nearest house
is across the lake.

274
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,258
It's total privacy.

275
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:18,849
(SCOFFS)

276
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:20,934
I know what
you're thinking.

277
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,102
What?

278
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:23,437
Come on, I get it.

279
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,024
White family,
black servants.

280
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,193
It's a total cliché.

281
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,479
I wasn't gonna
take it there.

282
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,279
Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me.

283
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,363
(CHUCKLES)

284
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,782
No.

285
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:39,369
We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

286
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,371
When they died,

287
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,664
(STAMMERS)

288
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:46,376
I couldn't bear to
let them go. I mean...

289
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:49,671
But, boy, I hate
the way it looks.

290
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,257
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

291
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:59,181
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

292
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,600
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

293
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,144
I agree.
Yeah.

294
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,107
(HUMMING)

295
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:13,487
So what do your
parents do, Chris?

296
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,489
Uh...

297
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,324
My dad wasn't
really in the picture.

298
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,243
My mom passed
away when I was 11.

299
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,411
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did she die?

300
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,788
A hit and run.

301
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,122
DEAN: That's awful.

302
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:26,333
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
You were young.

303
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:30,128
Actually, I don't remember a
lot from that time, so...

304
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,132
Well, that's okay. We don't
have to talk about that.

305
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,681
You smoke, Chris?

306
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,683
(CHUCKLING) Mmm-hmm.

307
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:44,406
You jonesing
a little bit over there, huh?

308
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,477
I'm quitting.

309
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:48,355
Dad, this is why I don't bring
people to the house anymore.

310
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,024
That's okay. We're not judging.
We're not.

311
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,693
That's a nasty habit,
though.

312
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,867
You should have Missy take
care of that for you.

313
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:58,657
How?

314
00:19:58,824 --> 00:19:59,825
DEAN: Hypnosis.

315
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,911
She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

316
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:05,539
Wow, um...

317
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,183
Some people
don't want strangers

318
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,434
messing around in
their heads, guys.

319
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,879
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

320
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,339
I smoked cigarettes

goddamn puff I took.

makes me want to vomit.

00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,725
Okay, fall back, Dean.

325
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,977
It's a service we provide.

326
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,147
I'm good, actually.

327

Thank you, though.

328
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,376
Well, smoker or not, we're
thrilled to have you up here

329
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,068
for the big get-together.
Yeah.

330

That's this weekend?

Oh, my God.

Thanks, George.

It's Rose's grandfather's party.

335

My dad would throw
a shindig once a year.

Get all his friends together,

guys tell me about this?

339
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,965
Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

340
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,759
No, it's not.
MISSY: Um...

341
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,344
DEAN: It is.
Actually, it is.

342
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,386
Is it really?

343
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,864
DEAN: Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
MISSY: Yeah.

344
00:21:02,888 --> 00:21:06,433
We just kept it up because after
they died, it felt like...

345
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:08,936
We keep them close to us.

346

Just get some rest.

Yes, I think I will.

355

Hey, buddy.

Nobody answers
the door around here?

Hey, Rosie.

DEAN: Why would I lie, huh?

I love it!

364

Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?

365
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,443
What?
Oh, my God!

366
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:01,780
She used to bite 'em off, suck on
'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.

That is so disgusting.

I fucking hate you.

371
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,080
Okay, here's a good one.

372
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,458
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

373
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,294
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

374
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,462
DEAN: Conner Garfield.

375
00:22:17,546 --> 00:22:18,672
No. Mom?

376
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:21,008
No, Jeremy, stop.

377
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,926
No, no, these are good.

378
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,136
I want to hear them.

379
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,054
Yeah, Rose,
where are your manners?

380
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:28,265
Our guest wants to
hear the stories, please.

381
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,307
JEREMY: Thank you.

382
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:32,144
So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right?
Huge kid, like 6'3".

383
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,813
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

384
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,023
You threw a party.

385
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,484
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

386
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,987
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

387
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,155
Like 15 of us.

388
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,490
Oh, my God. Tell me
this isn't true, Rose.

389
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,367
(JEREMY LAUGHING)
Yeah.

390
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:50,912
I filled the liquor
bottles with water...

391
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,581
And let me finish?

392
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:55,208
Uh-huh. Go ahead.
I'm curious.

393
00:22:55,292 --> 00:23:01,131
So I'm upstairs hooking up with the
hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

394
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,215
MISSY: Oh, God.

395
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,884
You realize you're
coming off as, like,

396
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,552
the world's
biggest douchebag, right?

397
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:11,266
So Conner starts banging
on the bathroom door, right?

398
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:12,893
I open it

399
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,854
and blood's gushing from his mouth.
And he's screaming,

400
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,482
(IMITATING LISP) "Your sister
bit my fucking tongue off!"

401
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,275
You bit him?
MISSY: What?

402
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,153
Okay, to be fair,
it was my first kiss

403
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,073
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

404
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,909
It was a reflex. I'm sorry.
(GROANS)

405
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,286
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

406
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,889
Yeah. DEAN: Yeah, you
better be careful.

407
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,332
Yeah, I'm very careful now.
(LAUGHING)

408
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:41,421
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

So, Chris, what's your sport?
Football? Baseball?

else have the floor for a second?

my sister, right?

street fights as a kid?

strength doesn't matter, right?
It's all about this.

It's a strategic game
like chess.

That's not...

647
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:52,316
No, don't talk to your dad.
It's not cool.

648
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,281
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.

649
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:56,348
Forget about it. It's done.

650
00:41:56,891 --> 00:41:57,892
Okay.

651
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,852
(CARS APPROACHING)

652
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:01,020
Oh, boy.

653
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,196
Oh, man. (SIGHS)

654
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,489
It begins.

655
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,325
Are you ready for this?

656
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:15,701
Yeah, I am.

657
00:42:15,826 --> 00:42:16,827
I'm not.

658
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:19,788
There they are.
Oh!

659
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:23,959
So nice.
How are you?

660
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,378
Just smile.
Smile? All right.

661
00:42:26,545 --> 00:42:27,588
How do you do that again?

662
00:42:27,671 --> 00:42:29,423
Yeah, just smile
the whole time.

663
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,300
Yeah, there you go.
There it is.

(CHUCKLES)

665
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,554
Oh, look,
it's the Greenes.

666
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:37,014
Gordon and Emily,
this is Chris.

667
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:38,724
Chris, this is Gordon
and Emily Greene.

668
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:39,975
Chris. Nice to meet you.

669
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,394
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Nice to meet you indeed.

670
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:43,604
Oh, that's quite a grip.

671
00:42:43,687 --> 00:42:44,730
Thank you. You too, man.

672
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,440
You, uh, ever play golf?

673
00:42:46,732 --> 00:42:49,026
Mmm, once, a few years ago.
I wasn't very good.

674
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,529
Gordon was a professional
golfer for years.

675
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:54,073
Oh, you kiddin'?

676
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:57,076
Well, I can't quite swing the
hips like I used to, though.

677
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,203
But, uh, I do know Tiger.

678
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:00,287
Oh.

679
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:03,040
Oh, that's great.
Super.

680
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:04,833
Gordon loves Tiger.

681
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,335
Oh, the best I've ever seen.

682
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,212
Ever. Hands down.

683
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:10,881
So, Chris, uh,
let's see your form.

684
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:14,218
This is Nelson and Lisa.

685
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:15,594
Hey, how you doin'?

686
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:18,472
So, how handsome is he?

687
00:43:19,348 --> 00:43:21,225
I don't know, are you handsome?
(CHUCKLES)

688
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:24,728
Okay.

689
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:28,607
Oh!
Not bad. Eh, Nelson?

690
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,779
So, is it true?

691
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,116
Is it better?

692
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,200
Oh, wow.

693
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:39,576
Wow.

694
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:43,956
Fairer skin has been in favor for the
past, what, couple of hundreds of years?

695
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,709
But now the pendulum
has swung back.

696
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:49,044
Black is in fashion.

697
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:55,426
Pardon me, I'm gonna
take some pictures.

698
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:56,802
Sure thing.

00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,247

(CHATTERING)

702
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,035
Good to see another
brother around here.

703
00:45:05,996 --> 00:45:10,042
Hi. Yes, of course it is.

704
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,251
(CHUCKLES)

705
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:13,879
Something wrong?

706
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:16,006
PHILOMENA: There you are.

707
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,301
Do something with this.

708
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:20,469
Ah, yes, yes.

709
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:24,098
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena.
And you are?

710
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,559
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

711
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,061
Fantastic.

712
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:31,730
You two make a lovely couple.

713
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:33,732
Thanks.

714
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:35,317
Oh, where are my manners?

715
00:45:35,484 --> 00:45:37,736
Logan. Logan King.

716
00:45:38,529 --> 00:45:40,030
Chris was just telling me
how he felt

717
00:45:40,114 --> 00:45:42,074
much more comfortable
with my being here.

718
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:44,243
That's nice.

719
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:49,748
Logan, I hate to tear you
away, dear, but

720
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:51,583
the Wincotts were
asking about you.

721
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,085
Ah, mmm.

722
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:56,630
Well, it was nice to
meet you, Chris.

723
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,220
(CHUCKLES)
Goodbye.

00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,989
What the fuck?

726
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,049
Ignorance.

Who?

728
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:45,471
All of 'em.

729
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,932
They mean well but they have no
idea what real people go through.

730
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:53,687
Jim Hudson.
Chris.

731
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:54,855
I know who you are.

732
00:46:56,064 --> 00:46:59,776
I am an admirer of your work.
You have a great eye.

733
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:03,780
Wait, Jim Hudson?
Hudson Galleries?

734
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,827
Believe me, the irony of being a
blind art dealer isn't lost on me.

735
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,830
How'd you do it?

736
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:16,668
My assistant describes the
work to me in great detail.

737
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:19,004
You've got something.

738
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:23,258
The images you capture.
So brutal, so melancholic.

739
00:47:24,468 --> 00:47:26,637
It's powerful stuff, I think.

740
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,805
Thank you.
Hmm.

741
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:33,268
Used to dabble myself,
wilderness mostly.

742
00:47:34,269 --> 00:47:39,399
I submitted to <i>Nat Geo</i> 14 times before
realizing I didn't have the eye.

743
00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:43,195
I began dealing. Then, of
course, my vision went to shit.

744
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:44,530
Damn.
(CHUCKLES)

745
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:48,700
I know. Life can be
a sick joke.

746
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:51,828
One day, you're developing
prints in the darkroom.

747
00:47:51,995 --> 00:47:54,540
The next day,
you wake up in the dark.

748
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:57,334
Genetic disease.

749
00:47:57,793 --> 00:47:59,169
Shit ain't fair, man.

750
00:47:59,336 --> 00:48:01,964
Oh, you got that right.
Shit ain't fair.

Hey.

Come here, come here.

757
00:49:04,568 --> 00:49:06,778
What the fuck?
You left me out there.

758
00:49:06,945 --> 00:49:08,780
Look at this.

759
00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:12,534
She unplugged my phone.

760
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:13,660
Who?

761
00:49:13,744 --> 00:49:16,747
Georgina. I came here to talk
to Rod, and I got no juice.

762
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:18,957
So you think she
did that because...

763
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:21,877
Maybe she doesn't like

764
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,589
the fact that I'm with you.

765
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,302

It's a thing.

00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:36,350
So you are so sexy that people
are just unpluggin' your phone?

768
00:49:38,727 --> 00:49:39,728
Forget it. Never mind.

769
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,813
No, no, no. Stop, don't...

770

(SIGHS) Don't do that.
Don't...

00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,235
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's all good, all right?

is lyanla Vanzant, okay?

She can't fix my motherfuckin' life.
You ain't gettin' in my head.

00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:32,197

off guard, right?

I'm cured. It worked.

Look, Jeffrey Dahmer was eating the
shit outta niggas' heads. Okay?

797
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,309
But that was after
he fucked the heads.

saw that shit comin'?

maybe jiggle some balls and shit."

No. They didn't get
a chance to jiggle shit

803
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,203
because their head
was off their fuckin' body.

804
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,216
Yeah, they still sucked a dick,
but without their heads.

I owe you an apology.

00:51:53,737 --> 00:51:56,573
How rude of me to have touched
your belongings without asking.

and it accidentally
came undone.

meddle with it further,

African-American experience

877

for me has been, for the
most part, very good.

Although I find it difficult
to go into detail

From the TSA?

01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:47,211
Yes, ma'am.

1150
01:15:49,254 --> 01:15:52,341
You know all TSA issues should be brought
up with your authorizing officer.

Yes, ma'am, but this
is not TSA business.

All right, here it is.
Mmm.

My boy, Chris, has been

Your son is missing?

Oh, no. Not my son,
my friend. He's 26.

1158
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:16,240
His name is Chris Washington.

1159
01:16:19,743 --> 01:16:23,038
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

She's white.

All right. Go on.

1162
01:16:30,128 --> 01:16:32,288
Look, Chris was supposed
to come back on Sunday, right?

1163
01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:34,925
And I've been watching his dog, Sid.

Cute, right?

1166
01:16:39,263 --> 01:16:42,599
So Chris sent this to me from his
girlfriend's parents' house.

1167
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:44,643
See, that's Andre Hayworth.

01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,770
Okay? Somebody we knew
from back in the day.

1169
01:16:46,937 --> 01:16:50,315
Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

1170
01:16:51,358 --> 01:16:53,360
Well, he don't look
so missing to me.

01:16:53,443 --> 01:16:55,529
That's 'cause we
found him, right?

1172
01:16:55,612 --> 01:16:57,252
But Chris said
he's acting real different.

1173
01:16:57,656 --> 01:16:58,740
Different how?

1174
01:16:58,824 --> 01:16:59,904
This dude is from Brooklyn.

1175
01:17:00,367 --> 01:17:02,077
Huh? He didn't dress
like this.

1176
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:04,121
I didn't use to
dress like this.

1177
01:17:04,496 --> 01:17:06,748
Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

1178
01:17:07,124 --> 01:17:09,167
And that would explain
the clothes. All right.

I know, I know, I know.

1182
01:17:15,257 --> 01:17:17,134
Okay, I'm trying to
work towards this.

1183
01:17:17,843 --> 01:17:20,012
Look, what I'm about to
tell you gonna sound crazy.

1184
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:21,972
You ready?
All right.

1185
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:24,141
Try me.

1186
01:17:24,558 --> 01:17:27,311
I believe they've been
abducting black people,

1187
01:17:27,477 --> 01:17:31,106
brainwashing 'em, making 'em work
for 'em as sex slaves and shit.

1188
01:17:31,648 --> 01:17:32,728
Oh, sorry about the "shit."

1189
01:17:33,525 --> 01:17:34,526
Sorry.

Hold on a second.

1191
01:17:42,576 --> 01:17:44,304
Then he sent me some
weird picture and I'm like,

1192
01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:45,746
"Oh, man,
that's Andre Hayworth."

1193
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:47,307
This dude been missing
for six months, right?

1194
01:17:47,331 --> 01:17:49,651
So I do all my research, you
know, 'cause as a TSA agent...

1195
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,085
You guys are detectives? I got
the same training, you know?

1196
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,754
We might know more
than y'all sometimes.

'Cause we dealin' with
some terrorist shit, so...

1198
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,150
But that's a
totally different story.

1199
01:17:57,174 --> 01:17:59,760
So, look, I go do
my detective work, right?

1200
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:01,887
And I start putting
pieces together.

1201
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:03,450
And, see, this is
what I came up with.

1202
01:18:03,513 --> 01:18:08,101
They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.

1203
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:11,772
Or sex slaves. Not just regular
slaves, but sex slaves and shit.

1204
01:18:11,938 --> 01:18:17,027
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis
that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,

1205
01:18:17,569 --> 01:18:20,739
but all I know is they already
got two brothers we know,

1206
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:23,408
and there could be a whole bunch
of brothers they got already.

1207
01:18:24,368 --> 01:18:25,369
What's the next move?
