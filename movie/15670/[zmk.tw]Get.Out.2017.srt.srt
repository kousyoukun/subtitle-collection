163
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,087
Get that headlight fixed.

164
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,647
And that mirror.

165
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,130
Thank you, Officer.

166
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,327
What?

167
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,931
That was hot.

168
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,811
Well, I'm not gonna
let anyone fuck with my man.

169
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,924
I see that.
Okay.

170
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,171
We're here.

171
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,531
It's the groundskeeper.

172
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,161
Are you ready?

173
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,606
ROSE: Hi!

174
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,846
My little girl!
Come here!

175
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,930
How are you? I love you too.
I missed you.

176
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,525
This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

177
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,091
Call me Mr. Armitage.

178
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,376
CHRIS: Of course.
How you doin'?

179
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,370
I'm kiddin'! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

180
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,045
How are ya?
I'm good. How are you?

181
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,531
We're huggers.
Yes.

182
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,880
This is my mom.
This is Chris.

183
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,365
Hi, welcome.

184
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,607
(LAUGHING)

185
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,364
Nice to meet you.

186
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,284
Your father gets
really excited, but...

187
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,928
Anyway, yeah.
I'm Missy.

188
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,042
Yes. Come on in. Please, welcome.
Inside.

189
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,609
(CHATTERING)

190
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,241
So how was your drive in?

191
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,840
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

192
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,570
What?
Oh, no.

193
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,085
Is it dead?
Yeah.

194
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,083
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

195
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,288
Yeah.
It just fruck us out.

196
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
It did?

197
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,376
CHRIS: Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

198
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,131
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

199
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,568
Armitage weird. Well, you
know what I say? (LAUGHING)

200
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,445
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

201
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,521
Dean.
Dad.

202
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,896
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

203
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,083
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

204
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,640
They're like rats. They're
destroying the ecosystem.

205
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,056
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

206
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,445
"That's a start."

207
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,291
I don't even understand that.

208
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,407
I'm sorry.
I'm just sayin'.

209
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,723
You know what, I am grateful
for what you've done today.

210
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,285
(SIGHS)
I don't like 'em.

211
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,521
We got that.

212
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,647
Okay.
Yeah.

213
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,803
All right, you guys
look so wiped out.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,604
Yeah, a little.
Yeah.

215
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,284
So how long has this
been going on? This...

216
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,761
This thang?

217
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,921
(DEAN SNICKERING)

218
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,926
How long?

219
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,841
(LAUGHING) Four months.

220
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,566
Four months?

221
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,482
Mmm.
Five months, actually.

222
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,645
She's right, I'm wrong.

223
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,962
Attaboy. Better get
used to saying that.

224
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,246
(LAUGHING)

225
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,770
Please, I'm so sorry.

226
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,968
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

227
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,601
(SNICKERS) See?

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,128
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

229
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,800
DEAN: I know.
I wanna give you a tour.

230
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,650
They just got...
Can we unpack first?

231
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,326
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

232
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,602
This is Missy's office. She
takes appointments in there.

233
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,091
She's a therapist, right?

234
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,321
Psychiatrist, yeah.

235
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Turns out people up here

236
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,616
are just as messed up in the
head <i>as</i> they are in the city.

237
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,926
This is Jeremy.

238
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,288
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

239
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,169
CHRIS: I've heard stories.

240
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,685
DEAN: Yeah, I bet you have.

241
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,202
He's studying medicine now. Wants
to be just like his old man.

242
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,964
You'll meet him.
All right. Cool.

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,002
I picked these up in Bali.

244
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,405
It's pretty eclectic. I'm a
traveler and I can't help it.

245
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,204
I keep bringing souvenirs back.

246
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,725
It's such a privilege to be able

247
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,410
to experience
another person's culture.

248
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,840
You know what I'm saying?
Mmm-hmm.

249
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,690
Oh, you're gonna love this.

250
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,410
My dad's claim to fame.

251
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,604
He was beat by Jesse Owens

252
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,207
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

253
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,376
Those are the ones where...
Owens won in front of Hitler.

254
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,970
Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

255
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,523
I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

256
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,881
This black dude comes along,

257
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,088
proves him wrong in front
of the entire world.

258
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,401
Amazing.

259
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,886
Tough break for your dad though.

260
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,121
Yeah.

261
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,603
He almost got over it.

262
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,841
(CHUCKLES)

263
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,961
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

264
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,963
We got some black
mold down there.

265
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,121
My mother loved her kitchen, so
we keep a piece of her in here.

266
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,811
Georgina, this is Chris.
This is Rose's boyfriend.

267
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,881
Hi.

268
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,051
Hello.

269
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,605
DEAN: The garbage goes
under the sink,

270
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,243
<i>and now for the Wants de Wants,</i>

271
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,771
the field of play.

272
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,601
I love it.

273
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,650
The nearest house
is across the lake.

274
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,251
It's total privacy.

275
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,841
(SCOFFS)

276
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,925
I know what you're thinking.

277
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,121
What?

278
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,440
Come on, I get it.

279
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,046
White family, black servants.

280
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,201
It's a total cliché.

281
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,520
I wasn't gonna take it there.

282
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,284
Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me.

283
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,361
(CHUCKLES)

284
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,806
No.

285
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,364
We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

286
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,361
When they died,

287
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,681
(STAMMERS)

288
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,363
I couldn't bear to
let them go. I mean...

289
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,683
But, boy, I hate
the way it looks.

290
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,244
Yeah, I know what you mean.

291
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,204
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

292
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,601
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

293
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,165
I agree.
Yeah.

294
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,121
(HUMMING)

295
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,482
So what do your
parents do, Chris?

296
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,485
Uh...

297
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,324
My dad wasn't
really in the picture.

298
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,244
My mom passed
away when I was 11.

299
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,402
Oh, I'm sorry.
How did she die?

300
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,800
A hit and run.

301
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,126
DEAN: That's awful.

302
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,328
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that.
You were young.

303
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,121
Actually, I don't remember a
lot from that time, so...

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,127
Well, that's okay. We don't
have to talk about that.

305
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,685
You smoke, Chris?

306
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,681
(CHUCKLING) Mmm-hmm.

307
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,400
You it looks
a little bit over there, huh?

308
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,481
I'm quitting.

309
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,371
Dad, this is why I don't bring
people to the house anymore.

310
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,046
That's okay. We're not judging.
We're not.

311
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,690
That's a nasty habit, though.

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,880
You should have Missy take
care of that for you.

313
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,641
How?

314
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,841
DEAN: Hypnosis.

315
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,930
She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

316
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,521
Wow, um...

317
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,176
Some people don't want strangers

318
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,416
messing around in
their heads, guys.

319
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,887
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

320
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,327
I smoked cigarettes
for 15 years.

321
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,767
I loved every
goddamn puff I took.

makes me want to vomit.

Okay, fall back, Dean.

325
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,962
It's a service we provide.

326

Thank you, though.

328

Well, smoker or not, we're
thrilled to have you up here

329

Thanks, George.

a shindig once a year.

Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

340

No, it's not.

Actually, it is.

DEAN: Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
MISSY: Yeah.

344

they died, it felt like...

345

her toenail collection?

What?
Oh, my God!

'em, and save 'em in a jewelry box.

Okay, here's a good one.

372
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,448
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

373
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,291
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

374
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,481
DEAN: Conner Garfield.

375
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,686
No. Mom?

376
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,002
No, Jeremy, stop.

377
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,929
No, no, these are good.

378
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,127
I want to hear them.

379
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,049
Yeah, Rose,
where are your manners?

380
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,288
Our guest wants to
hear the stories, please.

381
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
JEREMY: Thank you.

382
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,165
So Conner's from my lacrosse team, right?
Huge kid, like 6'3".

383
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,800
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

384
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,041
You threw a party.

385
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,488
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

386
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,007
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

387
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,161
Like 15 of us.

388
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,482
Oh, my God. Tell me
this isn't true, Rose.

389
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,361
(JEREMY LAUGHING)
Yeah.

390
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,929
I filled the liquor
bottles with water...

391
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,606
And let me finish?

392
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,207
Uh-huh. Go ahead.
I'm curious.

393
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:01,128
So I'm upstairs hooking up with the
hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

394
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,201
MISSY: Oh, God.

395

You realize you're
coming off as, like,

396
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,570
the world's
biggest douchebag, right?

397
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,282
So Conner starts banging
on the bathroom door, right?

398
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,891
I open it

399
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,850
and blood's gushing from his mouth.
And he's screaming,

400
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,486
(IMITATING LISP) "Your sister
bit my fucking tongue off!"

401
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,290
You bit him?
MISSY: What?

402
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,171
Okay, to be fair,
it was my first kiss

403
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,085
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

404
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,925
It was a reflex. I'm sorry.
(GROANS)

405
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,287
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

406
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,896
Yeah. DEAN: Yeah, you
better be careful.

407
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,321
Yeah, I'm very careful now.

408

I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,296
It's fine, it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.

649
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,368
Forget about it. It's done.

650
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,881
Okay.

(CARS APPROACHING)

652
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,001
Oh, boy.

653
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,205
Oh, man. (SIGHS)

654
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,486
It begins.

655
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,324
Are you ready for this?

656
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,720
Yeah, I am.

657
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,841
I'm not.

658
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,803
There they are.
Oh!

659
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,966
So nice.
How are you?

660
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,370
Just smile.
Smile? All right.

661
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,607
How do you do that again?

662
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,444
Yeah, just smile the whole time.

663
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,290

00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,006
Gordon and Emily, this is Chris.

667
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,730
Chris, this is Gordon
and Emily Greene.

668
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,961
Chris. Nice to meet you.

669
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,407
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Nice to meet you indeed.

670
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,607
Oh, that's quite a grip.

671
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,727
Thank you. You too, man.

672
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,444
You, uh, ever play golf?

673
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,041
Mmm, once, a few years ago.
I wasn't very good.

674
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,526
Gordon was a professional
golfer for years.

675
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,081
Oh, you kiddin'?

676
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,084
Well, I can't quite swing the
hips like I used to, though.

677
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,208
But, uh, I do know Tiger.

678
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,281
Oh.

679
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,043
Oh, that's great.
Super

680
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,840
Gordon loves Tiger.

681
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,331
Oh, the best I've ever seen.

682
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,204
Ever. Hands down.

683
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,886
So, Chris, uh,
let's see your form.

684
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,204
This is Nelson and Lisa.

685
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,606
Hey, how you doin'?

686
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,491
So, how handsome is he?

687
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,249
I don't know, are you handsome?
(CHUCKLES)

688
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,721
Okay.

689
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,602
Oh!
Not bad. Eh, Nelson?

690
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,762
So, is it true?

691
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,121
Is it better?

692
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,201
Oh, wow.

693
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,561
Wow.

694
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,971
Fairer skin has been in favor for the
past, what, couple of hundreds of years?

695
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,727
But now the pendulum
has swung back.

696
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,049
Black is in fashion.

697
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,447
Pardon me, I'm gonna
take some pictures.

698
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,806

Good to see another
brother around here.

703
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,050
Hi. Yes, of course it is.

705
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,885

706
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,006
PHILOMENA: There you are.

707
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,325
Do something with this.

708
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,481
Ah, yes, yes.

709
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,087
Oh, hello. I'm Philomena.
And you are?

710
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,562
Chris. Rose's boyfriend.

711
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,085
Fantastic.

712
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,720
You two make a lovely couple.

713
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,727
Thanks.

714
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,325
Oh, where are my manners?

715
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,721
Logan. Logan King.

716
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,045
Chris was just telling me
how he felt

717
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,088
much more comfortable
with my being here.

718
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,241
That's nice.

719
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,766
Logan, I hate to tear you
away, dear, but

720
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,604
the Wincotts were
asking about you.

721
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,091
Ah, mmm.

722
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,648
Well, it was nice to
meet you, Chris.

723
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,208
(CHUCKLES)
Goodbye.

00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,041
Ignorance.

00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
Who?

728
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,490
All of 'em.

729
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,922
They mean well but they have no
idea what real people go through.

730
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,689
Jim Hudson.
Chris.

731
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,847
I know who you are.

732
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,766
I am an admirer of your work.
You have a great eye.

733
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,760
Wait, Jim Hudson?
Hudson Galleries?

734
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,850
Believe me, the irony of being a
blind art dealer isn't lost on me.

735
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,843
How'd you do it?

736
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,689
My assistant describes the
work to me in great detail.

737
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,011
You've got something.

738
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,245
The images you capture.
So brutal, so melancholic.

739
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,642
It's powerful stuff, I think.

740
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,806
Thank you.
Hmm.

741
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,286
Used to dabble myself,
wilderness mostly.

742
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:39,411
I submitted to Nat Geo 14 times before
realizing I didn't have the eye.

743
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,207
I began dealing. Then, of
course, my vision went to shit.

744
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,521
Damn.
(CHUCKLES)

745
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,683
I know. Life can be
a sick joke.

One day, you're developing
prints in the darkroom.

747
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,526
The next day,
you wake up in the dark.

748
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,324
Genetic disease.

749
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,165
Shit ain't fair, man.

750
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,971
Oh, you got that right.
Shit ain't fair.

You left me out there.

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:08,769
Look at this.

759
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,521
She unplugged my phone.

760
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,641
Who?

761
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,764
Georgina. I came here to talk
to Rod, and I got no juice.

762
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,968
So you think she
did that because...

763
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,886
Maybe she doesn't like

764
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,609
the fact that I'm with you.

765

are just got jokes' your phone?

I'm cured. It worked.

he fucked the heads.

No. They didn't get
a chance to jiggle shit

803
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,200
because their head
was off their fuckin' body.

804
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,216
Yeah, they still sucked a dick,
but without their heads.

Yes, ma'am.

You know all TSA issues should be brought
up with your authorizing officer.

Yes, ma'am, but this

All right, here it is.
Mmm.

My boy, Chris, has been

Your son is missing?

Oh, no. Not my son,
my friend. He's 26.

1158
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,242
His name is Chris Washington.

1159
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,048
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

She's white.

All right. Go on.

01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,280
Look, Chris was supposed
to come back on Sunday, right?

01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,920

1166
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,602
So Chris sent this to me from his
girlfriend's parents' house.

1167
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,649
See, that's Andre Hayworth.

Okay? Somebody we knew
from back in the day.

1169
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,322
Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

1170
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,362
Well, he don't look
so missing to me.

01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,522
That's 'cause we
found him, right?

1172
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:57,240
But Chris said
he's acting real different.

1173
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,721
Different how?

1174
01:16:58,840 --> 01:16:59,920
This dude is from Brooklyn.

1175
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,089
Huh? He didn't dress
like this.

1176
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,124
I didn't use to dress like this.

1177
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,767
Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

1178
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,168
And that would explain
the clothes. All right.

I know, I know, I know.

1182
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,129
Okay, I'm trying to
work towards this.

1183
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,002
Look, what I'm about to
tell you gonna sound crazy.

1184
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:21,970
You ready?
All right.

1185
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,166
Try me.

1186
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:27,325
I believe they've been
abducting black people,

1187
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,121
brainwashing 'em, making 'em work
for 'em as sex slaves and shit.

1188
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:32,720
Oh, sorry about the "shit."

1189
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,521
Sorry.

1190
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,481
Hold on a second.

1191
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,296
Then he sent me some
weird picture and I'm like,

1192
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,765
"Oh, man,
that's Andre Hayworth."

1193
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,296
This dude been missing
for six months, right?

1194
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,641
So I do all my research, you
know, 'cause <i>as</i> a TSA agent...

1195
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:52,087
You guys are detectives? I got
the same training, you know?

1196
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:53,764
We might know more
than y'all sometimes.

'Cause we dealin' with
some terrorist shit, so...

1198
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,136
But that's a
totally different story.

1199
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,766
So, look, I go do
my detective work, right?

1200
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,888
And I start putting
pieces together.

1201
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,450
And, see, this is
what I came up with.

1202
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:08,128
They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.

1203
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:11,762
Or sex slaves. Not just regular
slaves, but sex slaves and shit.

1204
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:17,051
See, I don't know if it's the hypnosis
that's making 'em slaves or whatnot,

1205
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:20,723
but all I know is they already
got two brothers we know,

1206
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,411
and there could be a whole bunch
of brothers they got already.

1207
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,361
What's the next move?
