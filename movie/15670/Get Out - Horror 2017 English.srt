00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:23,665
What?

164
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:25,343
That was hot.

165
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:28,169
Well, I'm not gonna let anyone
fuck with my man.

166
00:13:29,415 --> 00:13:31,253
- I see that.
- Okay.

167
00:13:33,152 --> 00:13:34,445
We're here.

It's the groundskeepers.

Are you ready?

00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:14,849
[ROSE] Hi!

171
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,328
My little girl! Come here!

172
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:20,331
- How are you?
- I love you too. I missed you.

This is my dad, Dean.
This is Chris.

Call me Mr. Armitage.

175
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:24,635
[CHRIS] Of course. How you doing?

176
00:14:24,636 --> 00:14:27,738
I'm kidding! You call me Dean.
And you hug me, my man.

177
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:29,440
- How are ya?
- I'm good. How are you?

178
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:30,836
- We're huggers.
- Yes.

179
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:32,272
This is my mom. This is Chris.

[LAUGHING]

182
00:14:34,813 --> 00:14:36,814
Nice to meet you.

183
00:14:36,815 --> 00:14:39,184
Your father gets really excited, but...

184
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:42,320
Anyway, yeah. I'm Missy.

185
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:44,397
Yes. Come on in.
Please, welcome. Inside.

[CHATTERING]

187
00:14:50,462 --> 00:14:51,551
So how was your drive in?

188
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,299
It was fine.
We actually hit a deer.

189
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,898
- What?
- Oh, no.

190
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,500
- Is it dead?
- Yeah.

191
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,470
That's horrible.
Are you guys all right?

192
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:01,606
Yeah. It just fruck us out.

193
00:15:01,607 --> 00:15:02,866
It did?

194
00:15:02,874 --> 00:15:04,609
[CHRIS] Yeah. It came outta nowhere.
We got it pretty good.

195
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,512
Yeah, it must have
frucked you out, big time.

196
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:10,881
Frucking weird. Well, you know
what I say? [LAUGHING]

197
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:13,718
I say one down, a couple
hundred thousand to go.

198
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,080
- Dean.
- Dad.

199
00:15:15,086 --> 00:15:17,255
No, I don't mean to get on my
high horse, but I'm telling ya,

200
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:20,425
I do not like the deer. I'm sick of it.
They're taking over.

201
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:22,860
They're like rats.
They're destroying the ecosystem.

202
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:25,396
I see a dead deer on the side
of the road, I think to myself,

203
00:15:25,397 --> 00:15:27,265
That's a start.

204
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:28,559
I don't even understand that.

205
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:29,758
- I'm sorry.
- I'm just saying.

206
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:33,238
You know what, I am grateful
for what you've done today.

207
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:34,668
[SIGHS] I don't like 'em.

208
00:15:34,673 --> 00:15:35,762
We got that.

209
00:15:35,774 --> 00:15:36,727
- Okay.
- Yeah.

210
00:15:36,742 --> 00:15:40,278
All right, you guys look so wiped out.

211
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,547
- Yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

212
00:15:42,548 --> 00:15:47,006
So how long has this been going on?
This... this thang?

[DEAN SNICKERING]

How long?

215
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:51,977
[LAUGHING] Four months.

216
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,625
Four months?

217
00:15:54,626 --> 00:15:56,736
- Mmm.
- Five months, actually.

218
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,958
She's right, I'm wrong.

219
00:15:58,964 --> 00:16:01,332
Attaboy. Better get used to saying that.

00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,524
[LAUGHING]

221
00:16:03,535 --> 00:16:05,032
Please, I'm so sorry.

Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She's right, I'm wrong.

[SNICKERS] See?

224
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:11,542
Does he have an off button?
This is exhausting.

225
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:13,311
[DEAN]
I know. I wanna give you a tour.

226
00:16:13,312 --> 00:16:14,945
- They just got...
- Can we unpack first?

227
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:17,601
You wanna unpack?
Before the tour?

228
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:22,853
This is Missy's office.
She takes appointments in there.

229
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:24,421
She's a therapist, right?

230
00:16:24,423 --> 00:16:25,716
Psychiatrist, yeah.

231
00:16:25,724 --> 00:16:26,915
Turns out people up here

232
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:28,859
are just as messed up
in the head as they are in the city.

233
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,460
This is Jeremy.

234
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:32,597
That's Rose's little brother.
There he is.

235
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:34,599
[CHRIS] I've heard stories.

236
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,859
[DEAN] Yeah, I bet you have.

237
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:39,604
He's studying medicine now.
Wants to be just like his old man.

238
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:41,306
- You'll meet him.
- All right. Cool.

239
00:16:42,341 --> 00:16:44,383
I picked these up in Bali.

240
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:52,617
It's pretty eclectic.
I'm a traveller and I can't help it.

241
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:56,487
I keep bringing souvenirs back.

242
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:59,724
It's such a privilege to be able
to experience another person's culture.

243
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,246
- You know what I'm saying?
- Mmm-hmm.

Oh, you're gonna love this.

My dad's claim to fame.

246
00:17:06,031 --> 00:17:07,898
He was beat by Jesse Owens

247
00:17:07,899 --> 00:17:11,636
in the qualifying round for
the Berlin Olympics in 1936.

- Those are the ones where...
- Owens won in front of Hitler.

Yeah, what a moment.
What a moment.

250

I mean, Hitler's up there with all
his perfect Aryan race bullshit.

251
00:17:19,878 --> 00:17:20,978
This black dude comes along,

252
00:17:20,979 --> 00:17:23,514
proves him wrong in front
of the entire world.

253
00:17:23,515 --> 00:17:24,775
Amazing.

254
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:26,349
Tough break for your dad though.

255
00:17:26,352 --> 00:17:27,917
Yeah.

[CHUCKLES]

258
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,425
That's the basement.
We had to seal it up.

259
00:17:34,426 --> 00:17:36,661
We got some black mould down there.

we keep a piece of her in here.

the field of play.

I love it.

The nearest house is across the lake.

Come on, I get it.

White family, black servants.

It's a total cliche.

I wasn't gonna take it there.

Well, you didn't have to.
Believe me.

No.

279

We hired Georgina and Walter
to help care for my parents.

280
00:18:40,626 --> 00:18:41,851
When they died,

281

[STAMMERS]

282
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:46,731
I couldn't bear to let them go.
I mean...

But, boy, I hate the way it looks.

00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:52,571
Yeah, I know what you mean.

285
00:18:55,106 --> 00:18:59,610
By the way, I would have voted for
Obama for a third term if I could.

286
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:01,857
Best president in my lifetime.
Hands down.

- I agree.
- Yeah.

289
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:13,799
So what do your parents do, Chris?

290

Uh...

291
00:19:15,794 --> 00:19:17,728
My dad wasn't really in the picture.

292

My mom passed away when I was 11.

Oh, I'm sorry. How did she die?

- You were young.

a lot from that time, so...

people to the house any more.

That's okay. We're not judging.
We're not.

That's a nasty habit, though.

take care of that for you.

She developed a method, and I'm
telling you, it works like a charm.

Wow, um...

311
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:08,646
Some people don't want strangers
messing around in their heads, guys.

312
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:12,216
Listen, Chris, I thought
it was total bullshit.

313
00:20:12,217 --> 00:20:14,719
I smoked cigarettes for 15 years.

314
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,021
I loved every god damn puff I took.

315
00:20:17,022 --> 00:20:19,056
She puts me under once...

316
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:20,961
The sight of a cigarette
makes me want to vomit.

317
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,059
Okay, fall back, Dean.

318
00:20:25,063 --> 00:20:27,173
It's a service we provide.

319
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:30,535
I'm good, actually.

00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:35,573
- for the big get-together.
- Yeah.

323
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:37,575
Wait, holy shit. That's this weekend?

324
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:38,699
[MISSY] Yes, this weekend.

325
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,207
- What get-together?
- Oh, my God.

326
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:42,012
Thanks, George.

327
00:20:42,013 --> 00:20:45,315
It's Rose's grandfather's party.
[SIGHS]

328
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:48,619
My dad would throw
a shindig once a year.

329
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,723
Get all his friends together,
bocce ball, badminton...

330
00:20:52,724 --> 00:20:55,125
[ROSE] Wait, why didn't
you guys tell me about this?

331
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:57,327
Well, it's the same day
every year, sweetheart.

332
00:20:57,328 --> 00:20:59,229
No, it's not. [MISSY] Um...

333
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,695
[DEAN] It is. Actually, it is.

334
00:21:00,699 --> 00:21:01,890
Is it really?

335
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,200
[DEAN] Yeah, that's where you'd be wrong.
[MISSY] Yeah.

336
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:07,304
We just kept it up because
after they died, it felt like...

337
00:21:07,305 --> 00:21:09,273
We keep them close to us.

338
00:21:09,274 --> 00:21:10,840
Yeah, they're still with us.

339
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:13,343
[ROSE]
I just wanted to have a chill weekend.

340
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:14,978
[CHRIS]
Sounds like fun, actually.

341
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,614
[GASPS]

342
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:17,636
[MISSY] Oh, Georgina.

343
00:21:18,283 --> 00:21:19,611
I'm so sorry.

344
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,183
That's okay.

345
00:21:21,186 --> 00:21:24,623
Why don't you go lay down?
Just get some rest.

346
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,728
Yes, I think I will.

347
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,124
[MISSY] Good.

348
00:21:38,036 --> 00:21:39,295
My God, it must be very...

349
00:21:39,304 --> 00:21:40,734
'Sup, fam!

350
00:21:41,306 --> 00:21:42,736
Hey, Jer-Bear.

351
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:44,942
- Hi, darling.
- Hey, buddy.

352
00:21:44,943 --> 00:21:47,087
Nobody answers the door around here?

353
00:21:47,946 --> 00:21:49,680
Hey, Rosie.

354
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:50,848
[DEAN] Why would I lie, huh?
[LAUGHING]

355
00:21:50,849 --> 00:21:51,870
I love it!

356
00:21:54,786 --> 00:21:57,121
Did she tell you about
her toenail collection?

357
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:59,089
- What?
- Oh, my God!

358
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,092
She used to bite 'em off, suck on
'em, and save 'em in a jewellery box.

359
00:22:02,093 --> 00:22:03,318
[LAUGHING]

360
00:22:03,328 --> 00:22:06,196
No, I didn't.
I don't know what you're talking about.

361
00:22:06,197 --> 00:22:07,662
[CHRIS] That is so disgusting.

362
00:22:07,666 --> 00:22:08,721
I fucking hate you.

363
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,299
Okay, here's a good one.

364
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:13,871
Uh, let me set the scene.
It was our junior year.

365
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:16,741
Rose has a crush on this guy,
Conner Garfield.

366
00:22:16,742 --> 00:22:17,797
[DEAN] Conner Garfield.

367
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:19,069
No. Mom?

368
00:22:19,077 --> 00:22:21,278
No, Jeremy, stop.

369
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,247
No, no, these are good.

370
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:24,405
I want to hear them.

371
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:26,350
Yeah, Rose, where are your manners?

372
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:28,653
Our guest wants to hear
the stories, please.

373
00:22:28,654 --> 00:22:30,015
[JEREMY] Thank you.

374
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:32,422
So Conner's from my lacrosse
team, right? Huge kid, like 6'3.

375
00:22:32,423 --> 00:22:35,092
And he's pretty dumb, right?
So we threw this party.

376
00:22:35,093 --> 00:22:36,216
You threw a party.

377
00:22:37,796 --> 00:22:39,897
I think my parents
were in Greece or something.

378
00:22:39,898 --> 00:22:42,299
We raided their liquor cabinet
and we're all shit-faced.

379
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,253
Like 15 of us.

380
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:45,821
Oh, my God.
Tell me this isn't true, Rose.

381
00:22:46,705 --> 00:22:47,726
[JEREMY LAUGHING] Yeah.

382
00:22:49,207 --> 00:22:51,776
I filled the liquor bottles with water...

383
00:22:51,777 --> 00:22:53,036
And let me finish?

384
00:22:53,044 --> 00:22:55,412
Uh-huh. Go ahead. I'm curious.

385
00:22:55,413 --> 00:23:01,385
So I'm upstairs hooking up with
the hottest girl in class, Jean Deely.

386
00:23:01,386 --> 00:23:02,270
[MISSY] Oh, God.

387
00:23:02,287 --> 00:23:04,188
You realize you're coming off as, like,

388
00:23:04,189 --> 00:23:05,857
the world's biggest douchebag, right?

389
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,762
So Conner starts banging on
the bathroom door, right?

390
00:23:11,763 --> 00:23:16,200
I open it and blood's gushing from
his mouth. And he's screaming,

391
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,903
[IMITATING LISP]
Your sister bit my fucking tongue off!

392
00:23:18,904 --> 00:23:20,738
You bit him? [MISSY] What?

393
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:23,440
Okay, to be fair, it was my first kiss

394
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:26,376
and he slipped some tongue
and I was not expecting it.

395
00:23:26,377 --> 00:23:29,179
It was a reflex. I'm sorry.
[GROANS]

396
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,749
A reflex that I have
since gotten rid of.

397
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,117
- Yeah.
- [DEAN] Yeah, you better be careful.

398
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:36,453
Yeah, I'm very careful now.
[LAUGHING]

399
00:23:36,454 --> 00:23:41,866
I'm gonna go get dessert. And, Dean,
maybe clean it up just a little bit?

[SIGHS]

401
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:51,101
So, Chris, what's your sport?
Football? Baseball?

402
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,170
Basketball, mostly, I guess.

403
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:54,396
You an MMA fan?

00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,262

406
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,407
What?

Hey, Jeremy, why don't we let someone
else have the floor for a second?

408
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,800
You're dating my sister, right?

00:24:09,755 --> 00:24:12,957
He's dating my sister.
You had your chance.

410
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:14,727
I can't get to know the guy?

[SNIFFLES]

412
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:19,954
You mean like UFC?

413
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,759
Yes.

00:24:22,768 --> 00:24:24,333
Nah, too brutal for me.

415
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:30,207
You ever get into
street fights as a kid?

416
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,210
I did judo after school, first grade.

- [ROSE] Aw...
- You should've seen me.

00:24:34,345 --> 00:24:35,434

your genetic makeup,

That sounds good.

So the thing about jiu-jitsu is

strength doesn't matter, right?
It's all about this.

433
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:23,994
It's a strategic game like chess.

434
00:25:23,995 --> 00:25:27,943
It's all about being two,
three, four moves ahead.

in a fucking headlock.

Oh, no. Not my son, my friend. He's 26.

His name is Chris Washington.

1136
01:16:20,048 --> 01:16:23,315
He left on Friday with
his girlfriend, Rose Armitage.

his girlfriend's parents' house.

from back in the day.

Apparently, he's been missing for
six months in some affluent suburb.

Plus he's married to a
white woman twice his age.

They're probably abducting black people,
brainwashing 'em and making 'em slaves.
