00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,408
一個大西洋城的人
Some guy from Atlantic City.

134
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:31,242
在他變認真之前很有趣。
It was fun till he started getting serious.

135
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:34,908
-最近怎麼樣？
-說真的，我真想辭職。
- How's tricks?
- I'm ready to quit this dump. I really am.

136
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,910
雷不讓我帶眼鏡…
Ray won't let me wear my glasses,...

137
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,760
所以當我不能配合時藍就大怒。
...then lan gets pissed off
when I can't do the tricks.

138
00:13:39,892 --> 00:13:41,932
我是說，我真的看不見啊！
I mean, I'm only legally blind!

139
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:44,896
我可以理解，如果我把眼鏡戴在乳房上…
I could understand
if I wore my glasses on my tits,...

140
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,015
…那就不會有人看我的臉了。
...but nobody here looks at my face!

141
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,639
拜託，離開這地方吧。
Come on, let's just get outta here.

142
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:52,117
-我必須去做那只消失的藍鳥。
-聽起來不錯。
- I have to do the Disappearing Bluebird.
- Sounds great.

143
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,184
-你不能等等？
-我真的累了。
- Can't you wait?
- I'm really tired.

144
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:57,520
我可以叫一些皮薩在家中等你。
I could get some pizza
and meet you at home.

145
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,768
-你找到一個地方了？
-不算是。
- You've got a place?
- Not exactly.

146
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:02,942
只是我在那裡工作。
But I'm working on it.

147
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,819
哦，不，我知道你要說什麼了。
Oh, no. I know what's coming now.

148
00:14:05,949 --> 00:14:07,989
我保證，就今晚。
Just for tonight, I promise.

149
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,157
求你了。
Come on!

150
00:14:11,663 --> 00:14:14,449
你能保證電話只響七次嗎？
Do you promise
only seven-digit phone calls?

151
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,907
發誓。你不會後悔的。
Cross my heart. You won't regret it.

152
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:20,959
多謝。
Thanks.

153
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:22,962
歡迎回來。
Welcome back.

154
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:24,999
待會兒見。
I'll see you later.

155
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,491
嗨，美人兒，拿一張報紙吧。
Hey, baby. Take a paper.

156
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:06,961
哇，怎麼這樣。
Wow, I don't believe it.

157
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,353
大西洋城治安環境暴降
暴徒從旅店窗戶上落下
ATLANTIC CITY PLUNGE
MOBSTER FALLS FROM HOTEL WINDOW

158
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:13,717
靠！
Shit!

159
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,622
鼓聲
(drumming)

160
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:17,566
打擾！
(man) Excuse me!

161
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:20,322
-有火嗎？
-沒有，我不抽煙。
- You got a light?
- No, I don't smoke.

162
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,869
蘇珊！
Susan!

163
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:10,250
你怎麼不對我說一聲再見就離開了？
How come you split
without saying goodbye in person?

164
00:17:10,377 --> 00:17:12,584
每個人見面了都說再見。
Everybody says goodbye in person.

165
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,420
來吧，一起喝一杯。
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

166
00:17:15,549 --> 00:17:18,170
可以，但是只能一會兒。
um, yeah, OK,
but I've only got a few minutes.

167
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:20,757
-哦，別這樣…
-已經是最後的準備工作。
- Oh, great...
- It's a last-minute thing.

168
00:17:20,887 --> 00:17:23,971
今晚我們在Buffalo做一次演唱會。
The band got this gig in Buffalo
and we start tonight.

169
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,424
下次別在報紙上登廣告了，行嗎？
Next time don't put
an ad in the paper, OK?

170
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,726
蘇珊，我每週都在找你。
Susan, I've been looking for you
for weeks!

171
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:31,747
陪我去Buffalo吧？
Come to Buffalo with me?

172
00:17:31,757 --> 00:17:33,714
嗯，你可是在工作。

-無聊的工作
-陪我去吧。
- (Susan) It's boring.
- Come to Buffalo.

174
00:17:36,226 --> 00:17:39,558
我不會讓你閒著無聊的。
(Jim) I'll find some trouble
for you to get into.

175
00:17:39,687 --> 00:17:41,727
我現在已經沒閒心了。
I've had enough trouble already.

176
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,018
你…你和這人睡過？
You... you were with this guy?

177
00:17:47,152 --> 00:17:49,110
我離開時他還活著。
He was breathing when I left.

178
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:53,188
嗨，你們美女和野獸兩位，
我可不想在橋上出事，快走！
Hey! Beauty and the Beast,
we'll hit traffic on the bridge. Let's fly!

179
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,950
《生之欲》
(# "Lust For Life" by lggy Pop on radio)

180
00:17:55,077 --> 00:17:57,116
我不能就這樣離開你。
I don't like leaving you like this.

181
00:17:57,245 --> 00:18:00,781
-我能照顧好自己。
-好吧。
- I can take care of myself.
- I know.

182
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:03,454
這樣，我給你一個電話…
Look, I'll give you a number. uh...

183
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,292
有筆嗎？
You got a pen?

184
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,959
好了，這是我朋友迪茲的電話。
All right, this is the number
of my friend Dez.

185
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:13,131
他人不錯…
He's a great guy...

186
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:17,129
…如果你有困難了就打給他，他知道怎麼聯繫我。
...and if you really get in a jam, call him.
He'll know how to reach me.

187

還有絞肉機
# And the flesh machine

191
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,820
別尋刺激了，好嗎？
No more dead bodies, OK?

192
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:36,988
我要看看我能幹出什麼來。

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,235
下次我回來還在這裡見面。
Be here next time when I get back.

194

自從上當後我就沒有好轉…
# And I been hurtin'

195
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,534

Yo! Come back!
What are you doin' with my hat?

203
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,095
還給我眼鏡，怎麼回事啊？
Give me my glasses, babe!
What's the matter?

204
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,557
-哦，天，怎麼會這樣！
-對不起。
- Oh, man! I don't believe it!
- I'm sorry.

205
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:56,732
你在幹什麼？
What are you doin'?

《尊嚴》
(# "Respect" by Aretha Franklin

209
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:51,448
我不想繼續你的錯誤
# I ain't gonna do you wrong

210
00:20:51,914 --> 00:20:53,907
當你離開
# While you're gone

211
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:56,082
我不想繼續你的錯誤
# Ain't gonna do you wrong

212
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,163
因為我不想
# Cos I don't wanna

213
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:00,087
就是你回家時當我問起…
# All I'm askin'

214
00:21:00,215 --> 00:21:03,169
…那一點點尊嚴
# Is for a little respect
when you come home

I gotta have 'em, but 65 bucks...

222
00:21:25,322 --> 00:21:27,445
-那是定價。
-別管定價。
- That is the price.
- Forget it.

- I like the jacket.
- It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

But I bet he'd love it
if I swapped it for the boots.

225
00:21:35,957 --> 00:21:37,997
成交。
Deal.

226
00:21:46,843 --> 00:21:49,050
# Ooo, your kiss is

227

# So is my money...

230
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,023
很招人喜歡，是吧？
Gorgeous, isn't it?

231
00:22:10,157 --> 00:22:12,197
它曾經可是貓王的。
It used to belong to Elvis Presley.

232
00:22:12,326 --> 00:22:14,995
-試一試嗎？

- All right.

233
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:18,238
# Oh, a little respect

234
00:22:20,125 --> 00:22:22,284
# Oh, hey! A little respect...

235
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:01,237
我們從雞蛋開始
(TV) We start off with the eggs.

236
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,205
兩個兩個打，動作要快
These go very fast done two by two.

237
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:06,374
你可以在早晨做
And this you can do in the morning...

238
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:09,585
然後準備開始做菜。
...and get it all ready for baking.

239
00:23:09,715 --> 00:23:12,420
我會用新方法來做。
I'm gonna bake it and then unmould it.

240
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,675
這有六個雞蛋了。
There are your six eggs.

241
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:21,934
然後用打蛋器攪拌…

Some guy from West Germany's
got 1500 tubs...

246

他為人傳統
...he can't get through customs.

247
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:35,903
我得在鎮上陪他吃飯。

248
00:23:36,032 --> 00:23:38,605
就這一次，我抱歉，你能理解嗎？
It just happened.

- Car radio. You just came from the city.
- Oh, my God, the radio.

252
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:53,545

253
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:56,297
嗯，對，是，我忘了。
um... Yeah, right, I guess I did.

254
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:59,428
你可以說你不吃晚飯了，而我卻忙的不可開交。
You could have said
you didn't want dinner. I had to rush!

255
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:01,547
你忙什麼了？你說你什麼地方都沒去。
You said you didn't go anywhere.

256
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:03,473
你穿的是什麼？

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,809
夾克。曾經是Jimi Hendrix的夾克。
A jacket.
It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

258

怎麼，我們是窮人嗎？
You bought a used jacket?
What, are we poor?

259
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,898
你這是怎麼啦？
What's going on here?

260
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:22,238
羅伯塔，我必須要去了。
Roberta, I gotta run! I'm late.

261
00:24:22,368 --> 00:24:24,527
我們晚些再談吧。

262
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,868
晚些談。
All right, we'll talk later?

263
00:24:30,918 --> 00:24:32,958
Jimi Hendrix,是嗎？
Jimi Hendrix, huh?

264
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:44,552
落地聲
(clattering)

265
00:24:51,521 --> 00:24:53,561
電視聲
(TV continues)

266
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,495
警方尋找神秘女人

267
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:27,845
你賣了？
You sold it?

268
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:32,177
我落下了開儲物櫃的鑰匙！
I had a key that was important.
I got my shit inside a locker.

269
00:25:32,312 --> 00:25:35,846
-我賣了。
-我留下名字和電話。
- I sold it!
- I'll leave you my name and number.

270
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,214
動作好快，陌生人！
Good goin', stranger.

271
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:08,383
什麼他媽的陌生人？
Well, what fuckin' stranger?!

272
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:11,383
大型通鋪。這意味著尿褲子。
Festival seating. That means Portosans.

273
00:26:11,516 --> 00:26:15,845
尿褲子就是站著撒尿，我不想站著撒尿。
Portosans means pissing with flies.
I'm not gonna piss with flies.

274
00:26:15,978 --> 00:26:19,514
你們男人可以尿在瓶子裡。
這算什麼？木房子？
You guys can piss in bottles.
What the hell is this? Woodstock?

275
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:39,789
電話聲
(phone rings)

276
00:26:43,171 --> 00:26:45,413
-放映員
-迪茲，是我，吉姆。
- Projection.
- Dez, it's me. Jim.

277
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,376
等一會兒。
Hold on a second.

278
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,384
哦，我的天啊。
Jesus Christ!

279
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:56,463
我在Buffalo脫不了身，請你幫個忙，
是關於蘇珊的。
I'm stuck in Buffalo and I need a favour.
It's about Susan.

280
00:26:56,601 --> 00:27:02,390
是這樣，她在大西洋城遇到的一個傢伙
被人從旅店的窗戶上扔了出去。
See, now some guy she met in Atlantic
City got pushed out of a hotel window.

281
00:27:02,523 --> 00:27:04,765
這裡太亂了，我沒聽見。
This sounds wild. I'm sorry I missed it.

282
00:27:04,901 --> 00:27:06,940
迪茲，我沒開玩笑。
This is serious, Dez.

283
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:11,482
現在，一個署名陌生人的傢伙登出啟事
要在巴特利公園見她
And now some guy's run an ad to meet
her in Battery Park, signed "a stranger".

284
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:15,743
這有點怪了，你能不能
It sounds weird.
Could you just go down there...

285
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,743
去看一下她安全嗎？
...and make sure she's OK?

286
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:21,869
吉姆，維多利亞昨晚剛甩了我，
我心情糟透了。
Jim, Victoria split on me last night.
I'm in a shitty mood.

287
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,871
我沒法立刻就變成你的童子軍。
I'm not in the mood for being a boy scout
right now.

288
00:27:25,004 --> 00:27:27,245
拜託了，迪茲，就耽誤你半個小時。
Come on, Dez.
It'll take you half an hour.

289
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,964
-好了沒有？
-馬上就好，一秒鐘就好。
- (man) Come on!
- Give me a chance here. One second.

290
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:32,671
起哄聲
(booing)

291
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:36,503
-她在四點去見他。
-四點？那可要差不多一個小時！
- She's got to meet him at 4 o'clock.
- That's in less than an hour!

292
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,847
吉姆，我可是有工作的人！
Jim, I got a job here, you know!

293
00:27:38,975 --> 00:27:41,015
我求你了。
This one favour.

294
00:27:41,144 --> 00:27:43,599
即使我能找到人替我
Even if I could get someone
to fill in for me,...

295
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,889
可我連她長得什麼樣都不知道。
...I don't even know what she looks like.

296
00:27:46,024 --> 00:27:48,063
聽著，你不會找不到她的。
Look, you can't miss her.

297
00:27:48,192 --> 00:27:51,776
她很好看，金髮，還有，中等身材
She's incredibly pretty,
blonde hair, uh... medium height.

298
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,277
還有她穿著綠色的，上面畫著金色的…
And she's got this green and gold jacket...

299
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:58,654
一個錐形，一隻眼睛在上面，就像鈔票上那樣。
（共濟會標誌）你肯定能找到她。
...with a pyramid with an eye on top
like a dollar bill. You can't miss it.

300
00:27:58,786 --> 00:28:03,033
-好吧，你要請我吃飯啊。
-行，多謝，我一定請你。
- All right, you owe me one.
- Great. Thanks, Dez, I appreciate it.

301
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:05,205
好的，再見。
OK, yeah. Bye.

302
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,458
我一輩子都在紐約。
I lived in New York all my life.

303
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:11,754
我們老去中餐館，意餐館
We used to have Chinese restaurants,
ltalian restaurants.

304
00:28:11,882 --> 00:28:15,251
現在你去吃壽司。所有人都吃壽司。
Now you have these sushi restaurants.
Everyone goes for sushi.

305
00:28:15,386 --> 00:28:17,425
壽司，我討厭這東西。
Sushi... I hate the stuff.

306
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:20,306
我跟你說，儘管我有一天我買了一些，
Although, I tell you,
I had some the other day.

307
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:24,181
回家做了，還不錯的，味道像魚。
I took it home, I cooked it, it wasn't bad.
It tasted like fish.

308
00:28:24,311 --> 00:28:26,350
鼓聲
(drumming)

309
00:28:51,128 --> 00:28:53,168
9塊2.
$9.20.

310
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:57,506
給，不用找了。
Here, keep the change.

311
00:28:57,635 --> 00:29:00,802
哇，這是什麼？嗨，女士！
Whoa! Hey! What is that? Hey, lady!

312
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,969
嗨，女士！
Hey! Hey, lady!

313
00:29:03,098 --> 00:29:05,056
這算什麼？
What is this?

314
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:07,093
靠，刁民！
Oh, that's cute!

315
00:29:11,815 --> 00:29:13,855
嗨
Hi.

316
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:18,524
我以前好像見過你。
You look like I've seen you
somewhere before.

317
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:21,526
-不，我想不是。
-我想是。
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think so.

318
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:27,783
-你現在在做什麼事情嗎？
-我在等人。
- You doin' anything right now?
- I'm waiting for someone.

319
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:41,711
-跟我走，小姐。
-你不明白，我必須去見一個人。
- Come with me, miss.
- I have to meet someone.

320
00:29:41,844 --> 00:29:44,798
-我們談談出租車裡的事情。
-她那裡有我所有的東西。
- We'll talk about it in the car.
- She's got all my stuff.

321
00:29:44,931 --> 00:29:47,682
她會給你他媽的打車費。
She'll give you the goddamn cab fare!

322
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:52,718
我也不想這樣，可我也得生活。
(driver) I don't need this aggravation.
I work for a living.

323
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:54,894
想吃霸王餐，我知道法律。
Theft of services. I know the law.

324
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,685
嗨，打擾了，你喜歡吃糖嗎？
Well, hi!
Excuse me, but do you like candy?

325
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,572
-我這有甜甜糖。
-不，謝謝。
- I got some Sugar Babies.
- No, thank you.

326
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:07,325
我久想談一談，我認識你在大西洋城的的男朋友。
I wanted to have a chat. I was very close
to your boyfriend in Atlantic City.

327
00:30:07,452 --> 00:30:11,450
-不可能，我結婚了。
-我不這樣想。
- No, no, no. I'm married.
- No, I don't think so!

328
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,581
蘇珊？
Susan!

329
00:30:18,714 --> 00:30:21,038
你有一對他給你的漂亮的耳環嗎？
Did you wear the pretty earrings
he gave you?

330
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:24,875
-我們得談談，我的車就在附近。
-放開我！
- Let's have a chat. My car is over there.
- Let go of me!

331
00:30:25,012 --> 00:30:27,799
-蘇珊。
-讓我走。
- Susan!
- Let go!

332
00:30:27,931 --> 00:30:30,338
-羅伯塔尖叫
-蘇珊！
- (Roberta screams)
- Susan!

333
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:45,777
蘇珊？
(Dez) Susan?

334
00:30:47,075 --> 00:30:49,113
蘇珊
Susan?

335
00:30:51,454 --> 00:30:53,529
-發生什麼了？
-你怎麼樣？
- What happened?
- Are you OK?

336
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:56,496
我頭疼。
My head hurts.

337
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:58,784
我是迪茲，吉姆的朋友。
I'm Dez. I'm a friend of Jim's.

338
00:30:59,878 --> 00:31:01,917
吉姆？
Jim?

339
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:05,748
你男友吉姆。和你爭吵的那人是誰？
Your boyfriend Jim.
Who was the guy hassling you?

340
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:10,295
-誰？
-剛剛跑掉的那人。
- Guy?
- The guy that just ran off.

341
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:15,514
-我不知道。
-你不知道？
- I dunno.
- You don't know?

342
00:31:17,187 --> 00:31:20,057
-我不記得了。
-你記不起來了？
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

343
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:23,188
你還好嗎？
Are you OK?

344
00:31:23,318 --> 00:31:25,357
要不要去醫院？
Do you wanna see a doctor?

345
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:28,692
-我還好。
-你還可以。
- I'm OK.
- You're OK.

346
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,739
她還好，散了吧。
She's OK. Show's over.

347
00:31:32,868 --> 00:31:34,991
他跟我來的，她還好。
She's with me, she's OK.

348
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:38,661
要坐下嗎？
Sit down?

349
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,415
你什麼都不記得了嗎？
Do you remember anything?

350
00:31:42,545 --> 00:31:44,584
不知道。
I don't know.

351
00:31:44,713 --> 00:31:46,753
你怎麼到這兒來的？
How did you get here?

352
00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:48,709
不知道。
I don't know.

353
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,510
你記不記得早餐吃得什麼？
Do you remember
what you had for breakfast?

354
00:31:54,515 --> 00:31:56,174
不知道。
I don't know.

355
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,973
你叫蘇珊，記得吧？
You are Susan, aren't you?

356
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,689
-蘇珊？
-不知道。
- Susan?
- You don't know.

357
00:32:04,733 --> 00:32:06,772
好吧，我們這兒有什麼？
All right, what do we have here?

358
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:08,526
沒錢嗎？
No purse?

359
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:11,737
你的口袋裡是不是有一些東西？
Do you have anything in your pockets,
maybe?

360
00:32:20,248 --> 00:32:22,287
是什麼？
Is that it?

361
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:25,331
哦，現在我們得去某個地方。
Ah! Now we're getting someplace.

362
00:32:25,461 --> 00:32:27,334
這是我的電話號碼。
This is my phone number.

363
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,420
是吉姆給你的。
Jim must have given it to you.

364
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:32,339
這好像似曾相識。
This is like a dejavu.

365
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:36,470
你怎麼能似曾相識？
你什麼都記不起來了。
How can you have a dejavu
if you don't remember anything?

366
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:39,681
不不，我是說，一切都是似曾相識的。
No, no. I mean... this is all dejavu.

367
00:32:42,937 --> 00:32:45,427
這是Port Authority儲物櫃的鑰匙。
This is a Port Authority locker key.

368
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:48,898
我來告訴你吧，我要帶著你趕緊去
Port Authority的儲物櫃。
I tell you what. I'm gonna
run you up to the Port Authority.

369
00:32:49,026 --> 00:32:52,893
也許儲物櫃裡有什麼東西
可以讓你想起來什麼。
Maybe what's ever in the locker will
help you snap out of it. How's that?

370
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,318
-好的。
-好的。
- OK.
- OK.

371
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,781
走吧。
Let's go.

372
00:33:01,538 --> 00:33:03,495
等一下。
Wait a minute.

373
00:33:03,623 --> 00:33:06,244
你不是在哄我玩吧？
This isn't some sort of trick, is it?

374
00:33:06,376 --> 00:33:10,587
-你什麼意思？
-我是說，我聽說過你的一些事。
- What do you mean?
- I mean I know a little bit about you, OK?

375
00:33:10,713 --> 00:33:16,169
所以別玩我，因為我心情不好。
So don't even consider jerking me around
because I'm not in a great mood today.

376
00:33:16,302 --> 00:33:18,342
行，我是說，我不會…
Sure, I mean, I wouldn't...

377
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:20,510
玩你。
...jerk you around.

378
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:22,679
我都不認識你。
I don't even know you.

379
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:27,683
你戴上這個。
You better wear this.

380
00:33:58,426 --> 00:34:01,213
但願裡面是一些好東西。
I hope it's filled with something good.

381
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:08,349
這是什麼
Look at this!

382
00:34:16,569 --> 00:34:18,810
你把它塞得夠滿的了。
You sure do move around a lot, huh?

383
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:20,985
也許是吧。
Yeah, I guess.

384
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:42,174
這東西應該是耳環，對吧？
So this stuff does look familiar, right?

385
00:34:42,301 --> 00:34:44,460
這完全不可理喻。
Well, it's not completely unfamiliar.

386
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:49,639
你知道嗎，當我閉上眼睛，我看到一個金字塔。
You know, when I close my eyes
I see a pyramid.

387
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:52,009
一個金字塔？
A pyramid?

388
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:54,470
像你夾克上的那個？
Like on your jacket?

389
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:59,567
對，就是那個。
Oh, yeah. That must be what it is.

390
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:03,027
至少你沒丟東西。你好點了嗎？
At least you got everything.
I hope you're feeling better.

391
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:05,195
-你是不是好點了？
-是。
- You are feeling better?
- Yeah.

392
00:35:05,324 --> 00:35:08,906
很好。那我走了。我得把小摩托換回去。
Good. I gotta go.
I gotta get that scooter back.

393
00:35:09,036 --> 00:35:11,953
那麼，我哪次再來見你？
So, uh... I'll see you around
maybe sometime, huh?

394
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,785
可能我和吉姆一塊來。
Maybe, uh... I'll see you with Jim.

395
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:17,787
好嗎？保重，再見。
OK? All right, take care! Bye.

396
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,959
拜。
Bye.

397
00:35:46,698 --> 00:35:48,073
蘇珊。
Susan!

398
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:50,904
你今晚有地方睡覺嗎？
Have you got a place to sleep tonight?

399
00:35:58,959 --> 00:36:00,999
你可以去我那裡。
You can sleep at my place.

400
00:36:01,128 --> 00:36:03,167
就一晚上，沙發上。
One night... on the couch.

401
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,336
但是別給我找事。
But I don't want any drama.

402
00:36:05,466 --> 00:36:07,506
也別叫你的狐朋狗友來。
I don't want your friends coming over.

403
00:36:07,634 --> 00:36:12,379
也別隨便拿走什麼東西。
And I want nothing disappearing
from my apartment. You got that?

404
00:36:20,314 --> 00:36:22,352
咳嗽
(coughs)

405
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:25,064
你還是別抽了
Maybe you should quit?

406
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:27,772
是的。
Maybe.

407
00:36:35,078 --> 00:36:38,411
-多謝！
-客氣。
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

408
00:36:41,917 --> 00:36:43,957
你，出去。
OK, you. You're outta here.

409
00:36:45,921 --> 00:36:47,961
耽誤時間。
It's about time.

410
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,781
怎麼回事。
I don't believe it.

411
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:47,725
抱歉，耽誤你了嗎？
Sorry, man. Have you been waiting?

412
00:37:52,235 --> 00:37:55,320
-下次沒機會了。
-你要明白，這事緊急情況。
- Never ever again!
- Listen, man, it was an emergency.

413
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,152
我明白，沒機會了，下回別管我借了。
I understand. Never ever.
Don't ever ask me again.

414
00:37:58,283 --> 00:38:00,323
-好吧。
-不好意思。
- OK.
- Sorry.

415
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,909
這邊。
This way.

416
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:16,171
-這有人住？
-當然有人住。
- People live here?
- Yes, people live here!

417
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:19,883
抱歉，只不過我想這裡有點不一樣。
I just thought it was sort of unusual,
that's all.

418
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:23,719
得上兩層。
Two flights up.

419
00:38:30,189 --> 00:38:32,228
抱歉。
Oh! Sorry.

420
00:38:38,155 --> 00:38:40,860
抱歉，借過。
Oh! Sorry, man. Excuse me.

421
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,656
他們替我宣揚了這兒有人住。
Those look exactly like my speakers.

422
00:38:59,592 --> 00:39:01,918
嘿嘿，等一等。
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

423
00:39:02,053 --> 00:39:04,461
你在幹什麼？給我那個。
What do you think you're doing?
Give me that.

424
00:39:04,597 --> 00:39:06,637
謝謝。
Thank you.

425
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,509
這兒他媽怎麼了？
What the hell is goin' on here?

426
00:39:19,696 --> 00:39:21,734
笑聲。
(laughter)

427
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:25,572
不是吧。
I don't believe it.

428
00:39:29,162 --> 00:39:31,239
你要幹什麼？
(man) What you've gotta do is...

429
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:33,781
不錯啊，維多利亞。
(Dez) That's just great, Victoria.

430
00:39:34,502 --> 00:39:36,540
迪茲，這是我的東西。
It's my stuff, Dez.

431
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,710
那你就來取了？
So you just come and take it.

432
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:41,875
沒打個電話，也不商量，什麼也沒有
No phone call, no discussion,
no nothing.

433
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:45,423
-你好嗎？
-還行。
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

434
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:50,971
這樣，我把這些拿到
下面Porsche（德國跑車）上去。
Listen, uh... I'm gonna take
this stuff down to the Porsche.

435
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,592
我敢肯定有些東西是我的。
I believe some of that stuff is mine.

436
00:39:53,729 --> 00:39:57,144
比如應答機，比如Charlie Parker的唱片。
Like the answering machine.
Like the Charlie Parker records.

437
00:39:57,273 --> 00:40:00,144
-行啊，還你。
-謝謝。
- Oh, you can have it. Here.
- Thank you.

438
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:06,313
我會為其他的東西給你一張支票，好嗎？
I'll send you a cheque for the rest, OK?

439
00:40:06,449 --> 00:40:08,987
支票？行。
A cheque? Great.

440
00:40:14,165 --> 00:40:16,204
-嗨
-嗨
- Hi.
- Hi.

441
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,373
他是一個好小伙。
He's really a nice guy.

442
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,541
你一定會開心的。
You'll be happy together.

443
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:32,258
-抱歉。
-沒事。
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

444
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,300
口哨聲。
(Dez whistles)

445
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:37,851
其實，你可以打掃一下這地方。
You know...
you could do a lot with this place.

446
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,019
這兒很明亮。
There's a lot of light.

447
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,568
靠。
Ah, shit.

448
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:50,905
你是湊巧和人吵起來了，對嗎？
It happens, right?

449
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,949
應答機。
(answerphone beeps)

450
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,198
嗨，迪茲，是我，吉姆
(answerphone)
Oh, hi, Dez. It's, uh... It's Jim here.

451
00:40:57,331 --> 00:40:59,490
我剛打電話想知道蘇珊怎麼樣了。
I'm just calling to see if Susan's OK.

452
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:03,326
我在…媽的，我這兒是在哪裡。
I'm calling from, uh...
Oh, shit, I don't know where we are.

453
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:06,167
只知道是汽車旅館，嘿，這地方叫什麼？
It's some motel... Hey, where are we?

454
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:09,548
管他啦，這樣吧，我明天打給你。
Anyway, no, look...
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

455
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,670
多謝你了。
And thanks again for everything.

456
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,211
真夠哥們，謝謝，拜。
You're a pal. Thanks a lot. OK, bye.

457
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:18,014
看來電話鈴還要響幾次。
That's gotta ring some bells.

458
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:22,144
-老實說，不是湊巧。
-不是？
- Honestly, no.
- No?

459
00:41:22,272 --> 00:41:24,312
那糟了。
Terrific.

460
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:27,442
-我要喝一杯，你要點什麼？
-都行。
- I need a drink. Do you want something?
- All right.

461
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,523
你有的，什麼都行，蘋果汁，可樂，梨子酒
Whatever you're having.
Apple juice. Coke. Perrier.

462
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,695
Miller還是Heineken（都是啤酒品牌）
Miller or a Heineken?

463
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:35,280
-都行。
-到底哪一個？
- All right.
- Which?

464
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,070
第一個。
Either one.

465
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,781
謝謝。
Please.

466
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,455
口哨
(Dez whistles)

467
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:50,705
搞錯了吧！
(Dez) I don't believe it!

468
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,891
她把冰箱拿走了。
She took the refrigerator.

469
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:10,686
-警察怎麼說？
-這種情況大多數在24小時內就能找到。
- What did the police say?
- Most of these cases turn up in 24 hours.

470
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:14,437
你告訴他們那夾克的事了嗎？
還有她的結婚戒指在皂盒上？
Did you tell them about the jacket?
Her wedding ring in the soap dish?

471
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,400
我說了！
I told them!

472
00:42:17,242 --> 00:42:20,077
他們懷疑她只是有什麼事。
They seem to think she's having an affair.

473
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:22,872
哦，天啊，也許就是有事。
Oh, my God, maybe she is!

474
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,915
真是荒唐，羅伯塔哪來的事！
It's ridiculous.
Roberta is not having an affair!

475
00:42:26,042 --> 00:42:29,625
-她太冷淡了。
-虧你說得出來
- She's much too uptight.
- That is a horrible thing to say.

476
00:42:29,754 --> 00:42:33,835
我看你對和Becky Shuman偷情還挺得意的。
I suppose you're proud of the way you're
running around with Becky Shuman.

477
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:37,418
我不知道你在說什麼，
總之，我們沒偷情。
I didn't know you knew.
Anyway, we're not running around!

478
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,757
現在不是說閒話的時候！
We're having
a perfectly respectable affair!

479
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,262
-加裡，讓我問你點事。
-什麼？
- Gary, let me ask you something.
- What?

480
00:42:43,392 --> 00:42:47,888
羅伯塔有性高潮嗎？我是說，和你做的時候。
Does Roberta have orgasms?
I mean, did she have them with you?

481
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:51,768
-高潮？
-你心裡明白，對吧？
- Orgasms?
- You have heard of them, haven't you?

482
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,937
也許因為你不能給她滿足她才走了。
Maybe she left you
because you weren't satisfying her.

483
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,522
萊斯莉，沒人會癡迷於什麼性高潮！
Leslie!
Not everybody is obsessed with orgasms!

484
00:42:58,657 --> 00:43:01,113
-只是有些人…才有的。
-那麼她呢？
- Some people just... have them.
- Did she?

485
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:05,287
-你和Phil Donshue談論性高潮嗎？
-你個蠢貨！
- Did Phil Donahue discuss orgasms?!
- You are really a pig!

486
00:43:05,414 --> 00:43:08,580
-至少我體驗過。
-體驗過。我也有！
- At least I know about feelings.
- Feelings. I feel! I feel!

487
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:12,658
你真噁心，跟你爸一樣。怪不得羅伯塔離開你。
You're disgusting. You're just like Daddy!
No wonder Roberta left you.

488
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:14,836
你說夠了嗎！
Would you stop saying that!

489
00:43:14,965 --> 00:43:17,004
-加裡
-賴瑞
- Gary...
- Larry!

490
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:19,802
看著不錯。有羅伯塔的消息嗎？
That looks great.
Any word from Roberta yet?

491
00:43:19,927 --> 00:43:21,636
這麼快就搞上了，萊斯莉。
Fast work, Les.

492
00:43:21,763 --> 00:43:23,803
哦，這裡還有一些雞肉。
Oh, let's have some chicken.

493
00:43:23,932 --> 00:43:25,971
賴瑞，那是明天吃的。
The chicken is for tomorrow. Larry!

494
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,010
警察怎麼說？
What did the police say?

495
00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:30,813
出了這麼大的事你們還吃東西！
I can't believe
you're eating during a crisis!

496
00:43:30,939 --> 00:43:32,349
我們夠緊張的了，你還要怎麼樣？
We're nervous!

497
00:43:32,482 --> 00:43:35,269
那你們應該像個正常人那樣去打鎮定劑！
Then take a Valium like a normal person!

498
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:42,529
她有一口好牙。
She has great teeth.

499
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:46,659
這就是我為什麼出現在巴特利公園
(Dez)
That's why I showed up at Battery Park.

500
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:51,999
吉姆說你的一個朋友摔死在
大西洋城的旅館外邊。
Jim said a friend of yours got killed
outside your hotel in Atlantic City.

501
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,165
他擔心壞了。
He was pretty worried.

502
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,334
摔了？
Killed?

503
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,337
殺死了？
Dead?

504
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:02,048
這也是你的興趣之一，是嗎，蘇珊？
Sort of goes with the territory,
doesn't it, Susan?

505
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,553
也許我知道是誰幹的。
Maybe I know who did it.

506
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:10,264
我希望我能想起來。
I wish I could remember.

507
00:44:12,479 --> 00:44:14,518
也許就是你殺的。
Maybe you were the killer.

508
00:44:15,357 --> 00:44:17,396
不可能。
No! (laughs)

509
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:25,693
我想我要躺一會兒
I should probably lay low for while, huh?

510
00:44:26,284 --> 00:44:28,323
好主意。
It might be a wise idea.

511
00:44:30,121 --> 00:44:33,075
你不知道在碼頭的那個人是誰？
You don't know
who the guy at the quay was?

512
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:37,665
也許是被你拋棄的情人
Maybe a jilted lover?

513
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,422
肯定不是。
I don't think so.

514
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:48,301
也有可能。
Maybe he was.

515
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,304
你可知道
You know somethin'?

516
00:44:51,433 --> 00:44:54,054
你不完全是我所想的那樣。
You are not at all what I expected.

517
00:44:55,604 --> 00:44:58,142
你也不全是我想的那樣。
You're not quite what I expected either.

518
00:45:00,191 --> 00:45:02,231
薩克斯
(sax ophone)

519
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:22,622
我怎麼認識的吉姆？我是說…
Just how did I meet Jim? I mean, how...

520
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,420
我怎麼遇到他的？
How did I meet him?

521
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,588
也許這個有幫助。
Maybe it would help.

522
00:45:27,718 --> 00:45:30,174
我想是在那個咖啡店裡。
I think it was at some coffee shop.

523
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:33,511
那是你工作的第一天，
It was your first day at work.

524
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,680
吉姆大搖大擺的進來。
Jim waltzed in.

525
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:38,894
你給他帶來吃的，然後把帳單撕了。
You brought his food over
and you ripped up the check.

526
00:45:40,606 --> 00:45:43,891
他個高嗎？我說的是吉姆。
Is he tall? I mean Jim.

527
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:47,143
中等個頭吧。
He's about medium.

528
00:45:48,655 --> 00:45:50,695
哪種身材？
Is he sort of thin?

529
00:45:52,117 --> 00:45:54,156
哪種，哪種，呃…
Sort of. Sort of, um...

530
00:45:55,078 --> 00:45:57,070
跟我差不多。
...my build.

531
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:02,873
眼睛是什麼顏色的？
What colour eyes does he have?

532
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,998
藍的。
Blue.

533
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:11,173
跟你一樣？
Like yours?

534
00:46:18,058 --> 00:46:20,051
抱歉，抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

535
00:46:20,186 --> 00:46:22,225
抱歉。
(Roberta whispers) Sorry.

536
00:46:23,605 --> 00:46:26,311
我不知道怎麼回事，只是…
I don't know what happened. I just...

537
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:28,603
不好意思。
Sorry.

538
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:35,237
雷聲
(thunder rumbles)

539
00:47:34,716 --> 00:47:36,756
哼哼
(groans)

540
00:47:44,684 --> 00:47:46,724
過來。
Come on.

541
00:48:08,958 --> 00:48:10,997
迪茲
(whispers) Dez!

542
00:48:11,836 --> 00:48:13,874
迪茲
Dez...

543
00:48:19,385 --> 00:48:21,424
和我一起吃早餐嗎？
Wanna go out to breakfast with me?

544
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:24,427
早餐
Breakfast?

545
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:29,559
你怎麼了？穿的有點噁心。
What have you got on?
Some sort of disguise?

546
00:48:29,686 --> 00:48:32,936
-你不喜歡？
-不，只是，呃…
- You don't like it?
- No, it's, uh...

547
00:48:33,064 --> 00:48:35,851
還是迷人的。
...sort of charming.

548
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:38,936
我請客。
It's my treat.

549
00:48:40,113 --> 00:48:42,152
你要幹嘛？搶銀行？
What did you do? Rob a bank?

550
00:48:42,281 --> 00:48:45,199
我不知道，也許吧。
I don't know. Maybe.

551
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:48,827
你要到哪裡去？
Where do you wanna go?

552
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:51,196
看，我在手提箱找到這個。
See, I found this in the suitcase.

553
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,832
Gunny的咖啡店？我知道這地方。
Gunny's Coffee Shop? I know the place.

554
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,000
它在中央大街附近。
It's over on Center Street.

555
00:48:57,129 --> 00:48:59,916
也許我就是在那兒遇見吉姆的。
Maybe that's the place where I met Jim.

556
00:49:00,508 --> 00:49:01,836
-然後？
-然後…
- So?
- So...

557
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:06,380
然後我們就去那裡
看看是否有人認識我。
So we go there
and see if anybody remembers me.

558
00:49:06,514 --> 00:49:09,763
看得怎麼樣，有熟悉的嗎？
So what do you think?
Anyone look familiar?

559
00:49:11,226 --> 00:49:13,468
還沒有。
No. Not yet.

560
00:49:22,237 --> 00:49:25,072
我在手提箱裡找到這個，你聽說過嗎？
I found this in the suitcase.
You ever hear of it?

561
00:49:25,198 --> 00:49:28,732
魔術俱樂部？是的，在百老匯附近。
The Magic Club? Yeah.
That's that place over on Broadway.

562
00:49:28,868 --> 00:49:30,196
怎麼了？
Why?

563
00:49:30,328 --> 00:49:33,033
我想我應該去那，看看有沒有熟人。
I thought I'd go there
and see if I remember anyone.

564
00:49:33,164 --> 00:49:35,869
-你知道你要點什麼嗎？
-當然。
- You know what you're having?
- Sure.

565
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,040
你要點什麼？
What are you having?

566
00:49:38,169 --> 00:49:40,209
嗯，是你請客，對吧？
Well, it's your treat, right?

567
00:49:40,338 --> 00:49:42,330
是的，我付賬。
(giggles) Yeah, I got money.

568
00:49:42,465 --> 00:49:44,541
我要點…藍莓點心。
I'm gonna have... blueberry blintzes.

569
00:49:44,676 --> 00:49:46,714
很好，我也要那個。
I'll have that too. That sounds good.

570
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:48,884
你要點什麼？
What can I get you?

571
00:49:49,013 --> 00:49:51,385
呃，一杯咖啡。
Yes, I would like a... coffee...

572
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:54,513
還有…甜圈餅
...and a, uh... doughnut.

573
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:58,890
小姐，如果你有空了，就給我們上吃的吧。
Miss! When you get a chance,
could you take our order?

574
00:49:59,023 --> 00:50:00,980
給你可以，她可不行。
You can stay. She's gotta go.

575
00:50:01,107 --> 00:50:03,646
Mick，那個穿夾克的瘋子女孩來了。
Mick, it's that crazy girl with the jacket.

576
00:50:03,777 --> 00:50:05,816
-你，滾！
-你認識我？
- You, out!
- You know me?!

577
00:50:05,946 --> 00:50:08,069
對，別想在這兒吃霸王餐。
Yeah. You won't get a free meal here.

578
00:50:08,198 --> 00:50:11,567
-我有錢，我可以付款。
-我不要你的錢，滾出去。
- I got money, I can pay.
- I don't want your money. Get out.

579
00:50:11,701 --> 00:50:14,406
-我們有錢，怎麼了？
-想想你自己的事吧。
- We got money. What is it?
- Mind your own business.

580
00:50:14,537 --> 00:50:17,289
-這就是我的事，等一下。
-過來，出去。
- This is my business, wait a minute!
- Come on, out!

581
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:20,119
-嘿，我和他一起的。
-出去，出去。
- Hey, I'm with her.
- Come on, come on.

582
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:24,000
你幸運去吧，我沒向你逼帳！
You're lucky I don't press charges!

583
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,755
迪茲。
Dez.

584
00:50:25,882 --> 00:50:28,455
你怎麼樣，還好吧？太對不起了。
Are you OK? Are you all right? I'm sorry!

585
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,668
我說的第一條規則就是別給我找事。
Rule number one was no drama.

586
00:50:30,803 --> 00:50:33,970
-記得嗎？
-是的，我知道，抱歉。
- Remember?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry.

587
00:50:35,474 --> 00:50:37,266
我們走吧。
Let's get out of here.

588
00:50:37,393 --> 00:50:38,971
不好意思。
I'm sorry.

589
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:55,235
爭吵聲
(man and woman arguing)

590
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:58,404
你從來不讓我戴眼鏡。
(woman)
You won't even let me wear my glasses!

591
00:50:58,538 --> 00:51:01,954
回去賣T椊去吧，你被解雇了！
(man) Go back to selling T-shirts!
You're fired!

592
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:05,250
不對，你錯了，藍，是我辭職不幹了。
(shouts) No, you don't, lan, because I quit!

593
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,919
嘿，別在梯子下面！
(Susan) Hey! Not under the ladder!

594
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:16,638
我的命運絕不可能比這兒更糟糕的了。
敗類人渣！
My luck can't get much worse anyway.
Miserable scumbags!

595
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,846
也許我應該在床上教訓他。
Maybe I should've slept with him.

596
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:22,763
姐們，有個巫婆偷了我的衣服…
Man, some witch steals my clothes,...

597
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:27,142
…米克爾被人從旅店窗戶扔了出去，
現在你又被炒了。
...Meeker gets pushed out a hotel window
and now you get fired.

598
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:31,568
不太糟，但是壞運氣好像抓著你不放。
No offence, but bad luck really seems
to be following you around.

599
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,573
我們現在都清閒了，一起去看個電影吧。
We're both free now.
Let's just go to the movies.

600
00:51:37,702 --> 00:51:39,740
兩場連映的？
A double feature?

601
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,910
來吧。
Come on!

602
00:51:43,915 --> 00:51:46,668
如果你請我吃爆米花的話，電影票就我買了。
I'll pay for the movie
if you pay for the popcorn.

603
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:48,371
可以，但是，爆米花多少錢？
OK, but listen. How much is popcorn?

604
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,543
-2.50
-行。
- 2.50
- OK.

605
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:54,672
笑
(giggling)

606
00:52:02,642 --> 00:52:04,681
就是這地方。
This must be the place.

607
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:07,728
司機，靠邊停吧，就是這兒。
Sir, could you pull over, please?
This is it.

608
00:52:09,273 --> 00:52:11,313
真是不好意思。
I'm sorry about what happened.

609
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:14,565
-你沒有生氣吧？
-沒。
- Are you sure you're not angry?
- Yeah.

610
00:52:15,404 --> 00:52:17,444
-真的。
-我沒生氣。
- Really?
- I'm not angry.

611
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:20,280
你真夠哥們。
OK. You're a real pal.

612
00:52:21,702 --> 00:52:23,741
我會告訴吉姆的。
I'll tell Jim.

613
00:52:24,538 --> 00:52:26,448
-拜
-拜
- Bye!
- Bye.

614
00:52:33,673 --> 00:52:35,711
夠哥們，我會告訴吉姆…
A real pal. I'll tell Jim...

615

布利克大街電影院
Bleecker Street Cinema.

616
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,185
你只是別再這樣開除誰！
(man)
You just don't fire someone like that!

617
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:55,392
我上哪裡去找這麼文靜的女孩去？
Who am I gonna find
at such short notice?

618
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,566
拜託，你認識那麼多女孩。
Come on, Ray. You know lots of girls.

619
00:52:57,695 --> 00:53:01,610
-很多女人都在找工作。
-媽，別打擾我。
- (woman) Plenty of women need work.
- (Ray) Ma! Let me take care of this.

620
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:02,820
你好。
Hello.

621
00:53:02,951 --> 00:53:04,824
你看見外邊的招工告示了？
You saw the sign outside?

622
00:53:04,952 --> 00:53:06,861
你是在找工作？
Are you looking for a job?

623
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:10,740
是的，我想我是。
Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

624
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:13,033
-她還在想她在找工作。
-不。
- She thinks she's looking for a job.
- No!

625
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:15,790
我是在找工作，是什麼工作？
I am, I am! What kind of job?

626
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:18,044
進來吧。
Come on in.

627
00:53:18,173 --> 00:53:20,213

00:53:27,015 --> 00:53:29,055
還有我，藍。
And I'm lan.

還行，謝謝你。晚安，Daisy。
Fine, thank you. Good night, Daisy.

638
00:53:52,832 --> 00:53:54,824
你拿這個包去哪？
Where did you get this bag?

639
00:53:54,959 --> 00:53:56,999
它是我的，加裡夫人把它給我了。
It's mine. Mrs Glass give it to me.

640
00:53:57,128 --> 00:53:59,167
把包給我，Daisy。
Give me the bag, Daisy.

641
00:53:59,964 --> 00:54:03,214
-Daisy，把包給我。
-對不起，這包是我的。
- Daisy, give me the bag!
- Sorry, you ain't getting this bag.

642
00:54:03,343 --> 00:54:06,508
-請你給我，我要好好的問問你。
-這包是我的。

嘿，我說，你們能挪個地方吃東西嗎？
Hey, guys. Could you, uh...
have your picnic somewhere else?

645
00:54:31,452 --> 00:54:33,492
嘿，你們這些人！
Hey, guys!

646
00:54:35,165 --> 00:54:36,540
好吧，
Right...

647
00:54:36,666 --> 00:54:39,121
小心輕放，行吧？
Just try to be careful, all right?

648
00:54:42,463 --> 00:54:45,714
聽著，我不想捲入家庭糾紛，好嗎。
Listen, I don't get involved
in domestic disputes, OK?

649
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:47,668
不是糾紛。
There's no dispute.

650
00:54:47,802 --> 00:54:50,127
在她沒有失蹤前時，她穿著一件夾克。
She had the jacket on
when she disappeared.

651
00:54:50,263 --> 00:54:53,299
某種原因上講，這對她很不一樣。
It was very special to her
for some reason.

652
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:55,508
你真的記不起來她了？
Don't you even remember her?

653
00:54:55,643 --> 00:54:57,683
你也記不起來夾克了？
Don't you remember the jacket?

654
00:54:57,812 --> 00:55:02,473
黑色的，上面還有一個金色的像金字塔的圖形
It was black and gold and it had
a sort of a pyramid thing on it...

655
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:04,351
就像鈔票上的那樣。
...like on a dollar bill.

656
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,525
記不清了。
Vaguely.

657
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:09,820
很好，謝謝，你可真會幫忙。
Great. Thanks.
You've been a terrific help.

658
00:55:09,948 --> 00:55:12,024
等等，等等。
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

659
00:55:12,784 --> 00:55:15,785
她也來過這兒找夾克。
She stopped in here
looking for the jacket, too.

660
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:17,952
也許你們能互相幫助。
Maybe you can help each other.

661
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,120
電話鈴
(phone rings)

662
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,290
蘇珊，接一下電話。
Susan, will you get the phone?

663
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:24,328
電話鈴
(ringing continues)

664
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:26,538
蘇珊，電話！
Susan! The phone's ringing!

665
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,631
蘇珊！
Susan!

666
00:55:39,518 --> 00:55:41,558
你好。
Hello?

667
00:55:41,729 --> 00:55:44,054
等下，她在這兒。
Yeah, hold on. She's right here.

668
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:50,276
-什麼事？
-你的另一個暗戀者。
- What?
- Another one of your secret admirers.

669
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:52,443
喂？
Hello?

670
00:55:52,948 --> 00:55:54,988
是，你是誰？
Yeah. Who is this?

671
00:55:56,743 --> 00:55:58,368
加裡·格蘭斯？
Gary Glass?

672
00:56:01,874 --> 00:56:03,914
嗯，嗯。
uh-huh.

673
00:56:04,043 --> 00:56:07,542
哦，你就是巫婆的丈夫，我的東西呢？
Oh, so you're the witch's husband.
Where's my stuff?

674
00:56:09,005 --> 00:56:10,832
嗯。
Yeah.

675
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:13,168
嗯。
Yeah.

676
00:56:13,301 --> 00:56:15,341
嗯。也許我能幫你。
Well, maybe I could help you.

677
00:56:16,012 --> 00:56:21,089
聽著，今晚10點30到西21世紀街30號去見我。
Listen, meet me tonight at 10.30
at 30, West 21st Street.

678
00:56:21,226 --> 00:56:24,843
我在櫃檯邊的第三個座位等你，聽明白了？
I'll be waiting on the third floor
near the bar. You got that?

679
00:56:24,979 --> 00:56:27,435
好的，再見。
All right, I'll see you there.

680
00:56:30,693 --> 00:56:32,733
-嘿
-稀少的掌聲
- Hey!
- (sparse applause)

681
00:56:33,529 --> 00:56:35,736
晚上好，先生們女士們。
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

682
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:39,447
歡迎來到魔術俱樂部，
我是主持人，大雷。
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Big Ray.

683
00:56:39,576 --> 00:56:44,452
今晚我們有一系列的好節目，為所有人準備的。
We have a wonderful line-up for you
this evening, for all you people.

684
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:47,155
你，先生，就是穿紅色襯衫的…
You, sir, the man in the red shirt...

685
00:56:47,293 --> 00:56:49,783
-你從哪來？
-從布蘭克林。
- Where you from?
- (man) I'm from Brooklyn!

686
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,162
我們當中還有誰是從布蘭克林來的嗎？
Do we have anyone else here
from Brooklyn?

687
00:56:52,298 --> 00:56:54,669
好的。為什麼你們兩個不在一個酒吧間裡？
Right here.
Why don't you two share a cab home?

688
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:58,086
-笑
-真是好觀眾。
- (man laughs)
- This is a great audience.

689
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:02,087
好的，讓我繼續吧，我要介紹一位…
(Ray) OK, let's get on with it.
Introducing, back from his...

690
00:57:02,224 --> 00:57:04,264
蘇珊，過來。
Susan! Come here!

691
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:06,718
獨一無二的，舉世無雙的，冉冉新星…
(Ray) The one, the only, the innovator...

692
00:57:06,853 --> 00:57:09,973
從現在開始，我要你
在我們開始前在這兒呆五分鐘。
From now on, I want you here
five minutes before we begin.

693
00:57:10,107 --> 00:57:14,151
記住，我們從鴿子開始。你看起來很漂亮，要微笑。
Remember, we start with the doves.
You look beautiful. Smile.

694
00:57:14,277 --> 00:57:17,195
Davina，今夜女王。
Davina... Queen of the Night!

695
00:57:17,322 --> 00:57:20,276
所以，你們這些可愛的人們，
讓我們歡呼吧，來吧！
So let's hear it
from all you lovely people. Come on!

696
00:57:20,408 --> 00:57:22,400
掌聲
(applause)

697
00:57:22,535 --> 00:57:24,575
歡迎短曲
(band plays fanfare)

698
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,497
咳嗽
(Susan coughs)

699
00:57:29,625 --> 00:57:31,665
口哨
(wolf whistle)

700
00:57:32,045 --> 00:57:34,083
演奏
(band plays)

701
00:57:38,216 --> 00:57:40,256
掌聲
(applause)

702

掌聲
(applause)

703
00:57:52,439 --> 00:57:54,764
薄荷，又長又薄。
(woman) Menthol, extra-long, ultra-thin!

704
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:57,521
又長又薄哦，老顧客，就不用我說了…
Extra-ultra long and thin!
Regular, unleaded...

705
00:57:59,446 --> 00:58:01,486
鼓掌
(applause)

706
00:58:08,121 --> 00:58:09,200
不要啊。
Please!

707
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:11,656
下來吧。
(Roberta) Come down!

708
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:30,675
Davina
(lan) Davina!

掌聲
(applause)

711
00:59:21,483 --> 00:59:23,523
謝幕。
Bow!

712
00:59:26,947 --> 00:59:29,569
這一個比那一個還差！
This one's worse than the other one!

713
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,574
值得鼓勵，孩子。
Nice try, kid.

714
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:36,373
給你的，20美元。
Here you go. 20 bucks.

715
00:59:36,498 --> 00:59:38,657
明晚還是這個時間過來。
See you tomorrow night
at the same time.

716
00:59:38,792 --> 00:59:41,164
-你僱傭我了？
-當然僱傭你了。
- You're hiring me?
- Well, of course we are!

717
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:42,374
謝謝。
Thank you!

718
00:59:42,504 --> 00:59:45,624
把這些拿回家好好練習，好嗎？
Take these guys home and practise,
all right?

719
00:59:45,757 --> 00:59:49,541
還有，蘇珊，多多練習，好嗎？
And, Susan... practise a lot! OK?

720
00:59:49,677 --> 00:59:51,504
-好的。
-很好。
- All right.
- Good.

721
00:59:58,478 --> 01:00:00,684
《入軌》
麥當娜 唱
[歌詞不譯]
(# "Into The Groove" by Madonna)

722
01:00:12,532 --> 01:00:14,739
# Get into the groove

723
01:00:14,869 --> 01:00:16,446
# Boy, you've got to prove

724
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:20,956
# Your love to me, yeah

725
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:22,743
# Get up on your feet

726
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:24,785
# Yeah, step to the beat

727
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,254
# Boy, what will it be?

728
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:32,666
# Music can be such a revelation

729
01:00:32,845 --> 01:00:34,007
# Dancing around

730
01:00:34,137 --> 01:00:37,304
# You feel the sweet sensation

731
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:41,132
# We might be lovers
if the rhythm's right

732
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:45,474
# I hope this feeling never ends tonight

733
01:00:45,607 --> 01:00:49,770
# Only when I'm dancing
can I feel this free

734
01:00:50,236 --> 01:00:53,984
# At night I lock the doors
where no one else can see

735
01:00:54,115 --> 01:00:57,733
# I'm tired of dancing here all by myself

736
01:00:58,285 --> 01:01:02,200
# Tonight I wanna dance
with someone else

737
01:01:02,748 --> 01:01:04,242
# Get into the groove

738
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:06,414
# Boy, you've got to prove

739
01:01:06,627 --> 01:01:10,672
# Your love to me, yeah

740
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:12,707
# Get up on your feet

741
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:14,798
# Yeah, step to the beat

742
01:01:14,927 --> 01:01:18,011
# Boy, what will it be?

743
01:01:18,138 --> 01:01:21,056
# Gonna get to know you
in a special way...

744
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:23,175
加裡，格蘭斯，是吧？
Gary Glass, right?

745
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:25,219
是，你怎麼知道？
Yeah, how did you know?

746
01:01:25,354 --> 01:01:27,393
一猜便知。
Wild guess.

747
01:01:29,148 --> 01:01:32,648
-她離你而去，啊？
-是，兩天前。
- She split on you, huh?
- Yeah. Two days ago.

748
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:34,816
她之前離開過你嗎？
Has she ever split on you before?

749
01:01:34,946 --> 01:01:36,773
沒，當然沒有。
No, of course not.

750
01:01:36,948 --> 01:01:40,032
-她嗑藥嗎？
-嗑藥？羅伯塔？
- Did she do drugs?
- Drugs? Roberta?

751
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:43,074
她從小連大麻煙都沒吸過。
She's never smoked a joint
in her whole life.

752
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:46,952
她可能是李堡（紐澤西）最規矩的人。
She's probably
the straightest person in Fort Lee.

753
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,123
你是什麼意思？
What are you driving at?

754
01:01:50,002 --> 01:01:53,703
-你要喝點什麼？
-呃，不，謝謝了。
- Do you want something to drink?
- um... No, thanks.

755
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,707
我在計劃健身，不喝酒，不吃甜的。
I'm on this health programme, you know?
No alcohol, no sugar...

756
01:01:57,843 --> 01:01:59,919
-你要跳舞嗎？
-跳舞？
- Do you wanna dance?
- Dance?

757
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:09,179
借過，借過。
Excuse me. Excuse me.

758
01:02:09,313 --> 01:02:11,637
# Live out your fantasy

759
01:02:11,773 --> 01:02:13,682
# Here with me

760
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:17,186
- # Just let the music set you free
- (Gary coughs)

761
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:20,654
你看了報紙上關於一個叫米克爾的傢伙的事了麼？
Did you read that stuff in the newspaper
about that guy Meeker?

762
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,533
他在大西洋城被人從旅店窗戶上推了下去。
He got pushed out of a hotel window
in Atlantic City.

763
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:26,447
-沒有，為什麼？
-羅伯塔參加了這次謀殺。
- No, why?
- Roberta's mixed up in it.

764
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:28,619
羅伯塔？怎麼可能！
Roberta? That's impossible!

765
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:32,366
真的。她為米克爾的謀殺而圈定了我。
Fact. She's trying to frame me
for Meeker's murder.

766
01:02:32,501 --> 01:02:34,541
誰是米克爾？
Who's Meeker?

767
01:02:36,922 --> 01:02:39,674
是誰？而且他和羅伯塔到底想幹什麼？
Who's Meeker and what does
he have to do with Roberta?

768
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,216
米克爾死前的同夥和羅伯塔，
兩個人一起幹的。
Ex-partner and Roberta
were in on it together.

769
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:45,385
我想你弄錯了，
I-I think you're mistaken.

770
01:02:45,514 --> 01:02:49,049
羅伯塔在大西洋城不認識什麼人。
Roberta doesn't know anybody
in Atlantic City.

771
01:02:49,185 --> 01:02:51,225
我看見他們在一起了。
I've seen them together!

772
01:02:51,353 --> 01:02:54,853
你看了羅伯塔和別的男人在一起了？誰？
You saw Roberta with another man! Who?

773
01:02:55,566 --> 01:02:58,104
在我來看就像是個油球。
Looks like a real greaseball to me.

774
01:02:59,612 --> 01:03:01,650
你說的我都不信。
I don't believe a word you're saying.

775
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:04,188
相信我，你想找到你妻子嗎？
Here, trust me. You wanna find your wife?

776
01:03:04,325 --> 01:03:07,657
-使得，當然我要！
-很好，帶我去你家。
- Yeah, of course I do!
- Good. Let's go to your place.

777
01:03:07,786 --> 01:03:09,826
我家？
My place?

778
01:03:10,331 --> 01:03:12,287
借過。
Excuse me.

779
01:03:12,415 --> 01:03:16,081
# Now I know you're mine

780
01:04:58,393 --> 01:04:59,887
打擾。
Excuse me!

781
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:02,261
先生。
Sir!

782
01:05:02,397 --> 01:05:04,436
有人跟蹤我。
There's someone following me.

783
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:07,231
求你了，你能…
Please! Could you... Could you...

784
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:09,815
有個男人，有個男人跟蹤我…
There's a man...
There's a man following me...

785
01:05:09,946 --> 01:05:12,982
你是怎麼進來的？你不能到這裡來。
How do you get in here?
You're not supposed to be in here.

786
01:05:13,116 --> 01:05:16,449
我知道，對不起，先生，能幫我看一看他走了嗎？
I know. I'm sorry, sir,
but could you please see if he's gone?

787
01:05:16,578 --> 01:05:19,578
有個男人跟蹤我，你可以看看他走了嗎？
There's a man following me.
Could you see if he's gone?

788

789
01:05:23,793 --> 01:05:25,832

01:05:25,961 --> 01:05:28,630
Enrique會小心處理的。

791
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:33,049
不錯！

792
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:35,216
不錯。
Yeah.

793
01:05:38,599 --> 01:05:40,638
電視聲
(singing on TV)

794
01:05:41,893 --> 01:05:43,720
# He's hot!

795
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:49,020
# Your body's hot

796
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:52,104
# You're always hot, all the time, hot...

797
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:57,777
# Oh, I'm so hot, oh!

798
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:00,076
# So hot!

799
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,370
嗨，我是加裡的綠洲的加裡。
（西班牙語）Soy Gary de Gary's Oasis.

01:06:04,499 --> 01:06:06,373

805
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:21,754
在加裡的綠洲，你會美夢成真。
At Gary's Oasis
all your fantasies can come true!

806
01:06:22,308 --> 01:06:24,347
升降聲
(lift moves)

807
01:06:25,102 --> 01:06:27,142
先生？
Sir?

808
01:06:29,314 --> 01:06:31,354
先生！
Sir!

809
01:06:32,776 --> 01:06:34,603
升降機接近聲
(lift approaches)

810
01:06:46,248 --> 01:06:48,454
出租車！出租車！
(screeches) Taxi! Taxi!

811
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:52,332
出租車！
Taxi!

812
01:07:01,178 --> 01:07:03,218
喘息聲
(gasps)

813
01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:11,974
尖叫聲
(screams)

814
01:07:12,815 --> 01:07:15,899
-你自己送上門來了。
-等等，我給錢！
- You'll get yourself in a twist.
- Wait! I have money!

815
01:07:16,026 --> 01:07:18,517
我的錢在我的包裡！
I have money in my bag!
I have money in my bag!

816
01:07:18,654 --> 01:07:21,691
耳環，我要耳環。
OK. The earrings, I need them.

817
01:07:21,823 --> 01:07:24,990
什麼耳環？求求你，你搞錯人了。
What earrings?
Look, I'm not who you think. Please.

818
01:07:25,118 --> 01:07:28,951
好了，好了，別重蹈你已故的小情人的覆轍。
All right, all right, avoid the fate
of your late beloved boyfriend.

819
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,120
警笛聲
(police siren)

820
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,339
鴿子聲
(doves coo)

821
01:07:46,347 --> 01:07:48,386
他是拉皮條的？
Was he your pimp?

822
01:07:48,516 --> 01:07:50,556
什麼？
What?

823
01:07:50,685 --> 01:07:52,724
好的，這樣來吧。
All right, play it that way.

824
01:07:52,853 --> 01:07:56,981
起來吧，你只是頭撞了一小下，
你還活著呢。
Come on, you've just got a little bump
on your head. You'll survive it.

825
01:08:03,322 --> 01:08:05,362
你叫什麼？
What's your name?

826
01:08:05,491 --> 01:08:07,530
你不叫無名氏，對吧？
You got a name, don't you?

827
01:08:07,659 --> 01:08:10,909
好吧，到派出所再問她名字。
All right, we'll settle this
at the station house.

828
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:14,865
-羅伯塔。
-羅伯塔，是個名字。
- Roberta.
- Roberta. That's a name.

829
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,040
你們搞錯了。
I'm not who you think I am.

830
01:08:22,841 --> 01:08:24,881
這些鳥你怎麼用？
How do you use the birds?

831
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,730
你有個好房子，加裡。
Nice place you got here, Gar.

832
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:43,899
我們都喜歡。
We like it.

833
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:49,396
挺結實。
Firm.

834
01:08:49,534 --> 01:08:51,572
嗯，是。
Y-Yeah.

835
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,079
那是羅伯塔的。
They're Roberta's.

836
01:08:59,627 --> 01:09:01,951
《社交指南》

839
01:09:08,343 --> 01:09:10,383
這些也是羅伯塔的？
Are these Roberta's, too?

840
01:09:10,511 --> 01:09:12,837
我不知道她在讀這些。
I didn't know she read this stuff.

841
01:09:12,973 --> 01:09:15,012
你知道嗎，加裡，在你我之間，
You know, Gar, between you and me,...

842
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:18,095
你真的瞭解羅伯塔什麼？
...what do you really know about Roberta?

843
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,560
漂亮的牆紙。
Nice wallpaper.

844
01:09:37,329 --> 01:09:40,116
在你翻她的衣服之前，
Don't you think
you ought to wait for Roberta...

845
01:09:40,249 --> 01:09:42,325
你不覺得你應該等羅伯塔回來嗎？
...before you start taking her clothes?

846
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,499
她欠我一件外套。
She owes me a coat.

847
01:09:55,013 --> 01:09:57,172
-她體重多少？
-羅伯塔？
- What does she weigh?
- Roberta?

848
01:09:57,308 --> 01:09:59,300
105, 110.

849
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:01,925
我們差不多，非常接近。
We're close. Very close.

850
01:10:04,272 --> 01:10:07,807
-漂亮的浴缸。
-你喜歡？
- Nice tub.
- You like it?

851
01:10:07,942 --> 01:10:11,394
那是，呃，這是我們眾多受大眾喜愛的款項之一。
That's, uh...
It's one of our most popular items.

852
01:10:11,529 --> 01:10:16,405
你可以安裝在所有的浴室裡，
而且會為您的房子增價。
You can install it in any bathroom and it
increases the resale value of your home.

853
01:10:16,535 --> 01:10:18,491
我沒說我要買一個。
I didn't say I wanted to buy one.

854
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:20,659
是啊，不好意思。
Right. Sorry.

855
01:10:22,832 --> 01:10:26,165
你要知道，我可以習慣這樣的地方。
You know, I could get used
to a place like this.

856
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:28,163
來點大麻？
Got any pot?

857
01:10:29,088 --> 01:10:31,247
大，大麻，呃…
P-pot. um...

858
01:10:31,381 --> 01:10:33,540
平常我可以弄一些，
usually I keep some around,...

859
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:36,167
但是，現，現在，我要出去。
...but r-right now I'm out.

860
01:10:36,303 --> 01:10:38,343
你應該明白。
You know how it is.

861
01:10:39,598 --> 01:10:41,923
來一根火柴呢？
How about a match?

862
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:44,099
好，停。
(man) All right, stop.

863
01:10:44,603 --> 01:10:46,346
臉向前。
Face forward.

864
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,389
笑一笑。
Smile.

865
01:10:48,524 --> 01:10:50,563
左轉
Turn left.

866
01:10:51,568 --> 01:10:53,607
下一個。
Next.

867
01:10:53,737 --> 01:10:55,895
然後你開始想…
And then you start to think,...

868
01:10:56,031 --> 01:10:58,070
這都算什麼呢？
...what's it all about?

869
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:01,740
一張大照片。你明白嗎？
The big picture, you know what I mean?

870
01:11:02,412 --> 01:11:04,451
我明白，加裡。
Sure I do, Gar.

871
01:11:04,581 --> 01:11:06,620
我是說，那…
I mean, there...

872
01:11:06,749 --> 01:11:09,371
那有比賺錢更好的生活樂趣，對嗎？
There's more to life
than making money, right?

873
01:11:09,503 --> 01:11:11,459
我的意思是，我知道那個，我是說…
I mean, I know that. I mean...

874
01:11:11,587 --> 01:11:13,627
哦，□。
Oh... Mm.

875
01:11:18,052 --> 01:11:20,210
你知道……
You know... You know how...

876
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:23,762
這一切是如何來源於
在大學時的一個單純的想法？
...all time comes from
a single point in the universe?

877
01:11:24,975 --> 01:11:27,052
-你明白我說的嗎？
-不。
- You know what I mean?
- No.

878
01:11:36,486 --> 01:11:38,526
我丈夫。
My husband.

879
01:11:39,907 --> 01:11:41,982
我們住在李堡。
We live in Fort Lee.

880
01:11:42,117 --> 01:11:44,240
-電話聲。
-那些事情…
- (phone rings)
- There are...

881
01:11:44,369 --> 01:11:49,078
…發生在太陽系很遠的地方…
...things happening in solar systems
so far away...

882
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:51,366
…我們根本看不見它們。
...that we can't even see them.

883
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:55,208
笑
(giggling)

884
01:11:55,922 --> 01:11:58,163
我是說，它們…它們在乎什麼？
I mean, what do... what do they care?

885
01:11:58,299 --> 01:12:01,134
它們在乎什麼，即使我是紐澤西的礦泉浴巨擘？
What do they care
if I am the spa king of New Jersey?

886
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:03,384
喂，加裡的家。
Hello. Glass house.

887
01:12:03,513 --> 01:12:05,387
笑
(Gary giggles)

888
01:12:05,514 --> 01:12:07,554
喂？
(Susan) Hello?

889
01:12:08,268 --> 01:12:10,474
-喂？
-紐澤西礦泉浴的大王。
- Hello?
- Spa king of New Jersey!

890
01:12:10,603 --> 01:12:12,311
笑
(Gary giggles)

891
01:12:12,438 --> 01:12:14,561
礦泉浴大王。
Spa king!

892
01:12:18,652 --> 01:12:21,191
我可以再打給別的人嗎？求你了。
Could I call someone else? Please?

893
01:12:22,573 --> 01:12:24,612
打吧。
Go ahead.

894
01:12:48,848 --> 01:12:50,925
你，那個穿粉芭蕾舞裙的。
All right. You in the pink tutu.

895
01:12:51,225 --> 01:12:53,265
該走了。
Let's go.

896
01:12:58,858 --> 01:13:00,898
見到你真榮幸。
Nice to have met you.

897
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:05,611
她最好有一個好的解釋。
She better have a good explanation!

898
01:13:05,739 --> 01:13:07,863
你還沒見到她就開始大叫。
You haven't seen her and you're yelling.

899
01:13:07,992 --> 01:13:12,737
我不是。我就是想知道如果她有麻煩了
為什麼不打個電話？
I am not! I am wondering aloud why she
couldn't have called if she was in trouble!

900
01:13:12,872 --> 01:13:15,826
在你做任何蠢事之前先聽聽她是怎麼說的！
Hear her side of it
before you do anything stupid!

901
01:13:15,957 --> 01:13:18,745
格萊斯先生，Sergeant Taskal。坐下吧。
Mr Glass. Sergeant Taskal. Have a seat.

902
01:13:18,878 --> 01:13:21,166
這是我姐姐萊斯莉。
My sister Leslie.

903
01:13:22,005 --> 01:13:24,922
她在昨晚在下東區被逮捕。
She was arrested last night
on the Lower East Side.

904
01:13:25,050 --> 01:13:28,633
她在一座水塔樓下，我馬上把她帶過來。
She's in a holding tank downstairs.
I'll have her brought up.

905
01:13:28,762 --> 01:13:32,806
當我發現照片一樣時，我立刻給你打了電話。
I telephoned you as soon
as I realised the photographs matched up.

906
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:35,221
嗨，Ronnie，我是Taskal。把格萊斯帶來。
Hey, Ronnie. Taskal here.
Bring up Glass.

907
01:13:36,769 --> 01:13:39,391
我們可以結案了，她丈夫來了。
We're dropping the charges.
Her husband is here.

908
01:13:39,522 --> 01:13:42,227
是的，顯然他還沒接走她。
Well, obviously
he hasn't picked her up yet.

909
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:46,068
哦，羅伯塔。
(Gary) Oh, Roberta.

910
01:13:46,196 --> 01:13:47,524
讓我看看。
Let me see that.

911
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:49,695
哦，天啊。
Oh, my God.

912
01:13:51,283 --> 01:13:55,660
格萊斯先生，不久之前有人交了你妻子的保釋金，
她已經被放走了。
Mr Glass, somebody paid your wife's bail
a little while ago and she was released.

913
01:13:55,788 --> 01:13:57,246
你就與她擦肩而過。
You just missed her.

914
01:13:57,373 --> 01:13:59,200
誰，誰交了保釋金？
Who-Who paid her bail?

915
01:13:59,333 --> 01:14:01,539
男朋友，拉皮條的，你知道嗎？
Boyfriend. Pimp. Who knows?

916
01:14:01,668 --> 01:14:03,708
拉皮條的？
Pimp?

917
01:14:05,673 --> 01:14:09,041
我不知道該怎麼謝謝你，迪茲，
真的太不好意思了。
I don't know how to thank you, Dez.
I'm really sorry.

918
01:14:09,176 --> 01:14:11,216
考慮到這是我最後一次幫你，蘇珊，
Consider it my final favour, Susan.

919
01:14:11,345 --> 01:14:13,883
你還真的沒有辜負你的名聲啊。
You are really living up
to your reputation.

920
01:14:14,265 --> 01:14:16,174
看吧，現在已經完事了，迪茲。
See, now, that's just it, Dez.

921
01:14:16,308 --> 01:14:18,930
結束了，我並不是你想的那個人。
That's it! I'm not who you think I am.

922
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:21,682
-我可不在乎你是誰。。
-不，不，我不是你說的那個意思。
- I don't care who you are.
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.

923
01:14:21,814 --> 01:14:24,019
這裡真的很難講明白，我不是…
It's really getting complicated here.
I'm not...

924
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:26,189
噓。呆著別動。
Sssh. Stay right there.

925
01:14:40,081 --> 01:14:42,916
這是怎麼了？
I don't believe it.

926
01:14:43,042 --> 01:14:44,785
天！
(Roberta) God!

927
01:14:52,968 --> 01:14:55,839
我不敢相信維多利亞能這樣做。
I don't believe Victoria would do this.

928
01:14:57,514 --> 01:14:59,721
哦，天啊。
Oh, my God.

929
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,721
也許是昨晚搶我的那個人幹的。
Maybe it was the guy
who grabbed me last night.

930
01:15:02,853 --> 01:15:04,892
什麼？
What?

931
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:07,437
搶你的那個人？
The guy who grabbed you?

932
01:15:07,816 --> 01:15:09,725
你看，我跟蹤了我，迪茲。
See, he was after me, Dez.

933
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:12,529
呃，並不是我，他跟蹤蘇珊…
Well, not me exactly.
He was after Susan,...

934
01:15:12,654 --> 01:15:14,481
管她是誰，我不是！
...wherever she is, who I'm not!

935
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:16,903
他認為她住在這兒，可是那個她不在，
因為我是…
He thinks she's staying here,
which she isn't because I am...

936
01:15:17,033 --> 01:15:19,073
我不想聽！
I don't wanna hear it!

937
01:15:19,203 --> 01:15:22,452
首先，我屁股被人扔在了人行道上。
First of all, I get thrown out
on my ass on the sidewalk.

938
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:26,329
接著，我不得不支付了200美元的保釋金
把你從看守所裡接出來。
Then I have to fork up $200 bail
to get you out of jail.

939
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:31,251
現在，我回家了，看到整個地方被撕的稀爛，
而為什麼我還不知道！
Now I come home and the whole place
is torn apart. Why, I don't know!

940
01:15:31,839 --> 01:15:35,789
你要知道，蘇珊，我不想看到這些狗屁事，
真的不想。
You know, I really don't need this shit,
Susan. I really don't.

941
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:37,089
好。
Fine.

942
01:15:37,219 --> 01:15:39,259
我走。
I'll leave.

943
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,467
哎呦！
Whoops!

944
01:15:49,899 --> 01:15:52,650
你知道嗎，迪茲，我昨天晚上可能會被人殺死了。
You know, I could have been killed
last night, Dez!

945
01:15:52,777 --> 01:15:54,815
我真的怕得要命！
I was really scared!

946
01:15:55,571 --> 01:15:56,982
別想了。
Forget it.

947
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:59,153
抱歉給你弄得這麼亂。
Sorry about this mess.

948
01:15:59,992 --> 01:16:02,827
我會賠給你，我會給你寄一張支票。
I can pay you back!
I'll send you a cheque.

949
01:16:02,953 --> 01:16:04,993
很好，又一張支票。
Great. Another cheque.

950
01:16:11,085 --> 01:16:13,292
哭
(sobbing)

951
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,347
對不起。
Sorry.

952
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,520
嘿嘿嘿，
Hey, hey, hey.

953
01:16:33,649 --> 01:16:36,187
這麼亂不是最壞的。
This mess isn't so bad.

954
01:16:36,569 --> 01:16:38,893
我曾經開個派對，比著還要糟。
I've had worse parties than this.

955
01:17:07,223 --> 01:17:09,263
笑
(Roberta giggles)

956
01:17:53,977 --> 01:17:56,016
開電視
(turns TV on)

957
01:18:00,024 --> 01:18:02,597
理查德·諾蘭和布魯斯·米克爾是在等待…
Richard Nolan and Bruce Meeker
were released...

958
01:18:02,735 --> 01:18:05,736
…對他們1982年走私活動的定罪判決
提出上述期間被釋放的。
...pending appeal of their 1982
conviction for smuggling.

959
01:18:05,863 --> 01:18:10,192
他們是偷竊現在紐約展出的開羅收藏品中
They are prime suspects in the
disappearance of the Nefertiti earrings...

960
01:18:10,326 --> 01:18:13,909
娜芙兒提提耳環的主要嫌疑人。
...from the Cairo collection
currently on display in New York.

961
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:17,039
娜芙兒提提？我靠！
Nefertiti? No shit!

962
01:18:17,167 --> 01:18:19,740
這不正常！我剛剛看了一篇文章…
It's not uncommon!
I've just read an article...

963
01:18:19,877 --> 01:18:23,128
…關於一個女人上午在城裡胡作非為，
..about a woman who turned tricks
in the city all morning...

964
01:18:23,255 --> 01:18:25,747
然後在下午回家前又恢復正常。
...and shopped all afternoon
before going home.

965
01:18:25,883 --> 01:18:29,085
她做了好幾年了，而她丈夫卻一點不知道。
She did it for years
before her husband found out about it.

966
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:33,548
羅伯塔不可能去賣淫，她哪有妓女那樣的性感身材？
這不可能。
Roberta can't be a prostitute. She doesn't
like sex that much. It's impossible.

967
01:18:43,191 --> 01:18:48,398
哦，天啊，我可聽說有五分之四的妓女是同性戀。
Oh, my God. I have heard that four
out of five prostitutes are lesbians.

968
01:18:49,864 --> 01:18:53,697
萊斯莉，如果我妻子是同性戀的話我會知道的。
Leslie, I think that I would know
if my wife was a lesbian.

969
01:18:53,827 --> 01:18:56,365
怎麼知道？連她是妓女你都不知道。
Why?!
You didn't know she was a prostitute.

970
01:18:57,204 --> 01:18:59,577
加裡，我想你要接受這個事實…
Gary, I think you have
got to accept the fact...

971
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:03,539
就是在你的關係中存在著那些非常不正常的東西。
...that there is something very unusual
going on in your relationship.

972
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:06,041
蘇珊
(Gary) Susan.

973
01:19:06,172 --> 01:19:08,129
-蘇珊。
-蘇珊是誰？
- Susan!
- Who's Susan?

974
01:19:08,257 --> 01:19:11,377
呃，別想歪了，她是來幫助我找羅伯塔的。
uh... Don't get the wrong idea.
She was helping me find Roberta.

975
01:19:14,721 --> 01:19:16,761
蘇珊。
(Gary) Susan!

976
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,342
蘇珊。
Susan!

977
01:19:19,476 --> 01:19:21,268
你在幹什麼？
What are you doing here?

978
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:24,312
我有好消息和壞消息，你要先聽哪個？
I got good news and bad news.
What do you want first?

979
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:27,061
-你說過你會走的。
-好的，好消息。
- You said you were going to leave.
- OK, good news.

980
01:19:27,192 --> 01:19:29,269
你妻子不是跟那油球一起的。
Your wife isn't with the greaseball.

981
01:19:29,402 --> 01:19:33,270
蘇珊，我妻子剛在下東區被人接走…
Susan, my wife has just been
picked up on the Lower East Side,...

982
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:36,111
……跟著她的帶槍的拉皮條老闆跑的！
...escaping from her gun-toting pimp!

983
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:37,191
他不是拉皮條的。
He's not a pimp.

984
01:19:37,327 --> 01:19:39,284
-他不是拉皮條的。
-他不是拉皮條的。
- He's not a pimp.
- He's not a pimp.

985
01:19:39,413 --> 01:19:42,697
壞消息是他有可能會殺了她，因為他認為她是我。
The bad news is he'll probably kill her
cos he thinks she's me.

986
01:19:42,832 --> 01:19:44,872
-什麼？
-你從來沒讀過嗎？
- What?
- Didn't you ever read this?

987
01:19:45,001 --> 01:19:46,958
她的日記。
She kept a diary.

988
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:49,412
有一些好定西：睡不著。
It's great stuff. "Couldn't sleep."

989
01:19:49,547 --> 01:19:52,751
走進廚房，加裡進來，關了燈。
"Went into kitchen.
Gary came in. Turned on light."

990
01:19:52,883 --> 01:19:55,801
加裡走了，剩下生日蛋糕。
"Gary left. Finished birthday cake."

991
01:19:55,928 --> 01:20:00,590
這有好幾頁。這將是封底了。
沒有人的生活會這樣無趣。
Pages of it. It's gotta be a cover.
Nobody's life could be this boring.

992
01:20:00,725 --> 01:20:03,215
你不該讀這些的，這是私人隱私。
You shouldn't be reading that. It's private.

993
01:20:03,352 --> 01:20:06,768
是啊，這個與她無關，而與我有關，聽聽這個。
Yeah, well, it's not about her.
It's about me. Listen to this.

994
01:20:06,897 --> 01:20:10,231
他又開始找蘇珊了，她從墨西哥州回來晚了。
"He's looking for Susan again.
She's late returning from Mexico."

995
01:20:10,359 --> 01:20:12,316
這是他第五個啟事了。
"This is his fifth ad."

996
01:20:12,444 --> 01:20:15,778
為什麼他如此強烈的想要見她？
她是誰？
"Why does he want to see her so badly?
Who is she?"

997
01:20:15,906 --> 01:20:18,147
還有我的一張照片。
And there's my picture.

998
01:20:19,076 --> 01:20:22,242
加裡，為什麼你不告訴我她讀了這些啟事呢？
Gary, why didn't you tell me
she read the personals?

999
01:20:22,370 --> 01:20:24,410
我們昨天就可以搞定了。
We could've settled this yesterday.

1000
01:20:24,539 --> 01:20:27,291
她一直都在看這些啟事。我不認為…
She read them all the time. I didn't think...

1001
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:31,960
嗯，是。幸虧了每一個人，
我才能活下來想做點什麼。
Yeah, well, fortunately for everybody,
I'm here and I'm thinking.

1002
01:20:32,089 --> 01:20:34,127
把車鑰匙給我。
Give me the car keys.

1003
01:20:36,676 --> 01:20:38,799
我會把它完整帶回來的。
I'll bring it right back.

1004
01:20:38,928 --> 01:20:40,506
嘿咻。
Hiya.

1005
01:20:41,264 --> 01:20:44,218
加裡。她拿的是你的汽車鑰匙。
Gary! She is taking the car keys!

1006
01:20:46,394 --> 01:20:49,181
別說了，萊斯莉，行嗎？
Shut up, Leslie. OK?

1007
01:20:50,314 --> 01:20:54,775
日記本。有點偷偷摸摸的感覺。
她是怎麼評論我的？
Diary. That little sneak,
what did she say about me?

1008
01:21:18,425 --> 01:21:21,710
瘋狂尋找
陌生人尋找蘇珊
"Desperately seeking
stranger seeking Susan."

1009
01:21:21,845 --> 01:21:26,092
敬啟者，在星期六晚9點半，百老匯魔術俱樂部見。
"Regarding key. Meet me Saturday night,
Magic Club, Broadway. 9.30pm. Be there."

1010
01:21:26,224 --> 01:21:28,430
-就這些了？
-她會喜歡的。
- Is that it?
- She'll love it.

1011
01:21:28,559 --> 01:21:30,599
去櫃檯付錢。
Pay at the cashier.

1012
01:21:34,649 --> 01:21:37,685
四十歲單身白人男性，
尋找下午的玩伴。
"Single white male, 40,
looking for afternoon playmates."

1013
01:21:37,819 --> 01:21:41,104
就這些了？去櫃檯付錢。
Is that it? Pay at the cashier.

1014
01:21:55,836 --> 01:21:57,663
迪茲…
Dez...

1015
01:21:59,631 --> 01:22:01,671
我不是蘇珊。
I'm not Susan.

1016
01:22:02,801 --> 01:22:05,885
我是家庭主婦，住在紐澤西李堡。
I'm a housewife
and I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

1017
01:22:06,763 --> 01:22:09,219
我已經結婚四年了。
I've been married for four years.

1018
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,009
我丈夫加裡…
My husband Gary...

1019
01:22:11,142 --> 01:22:15,306
他做浴盆和浴室的生意。
He sells bathroom spas and saunas.

1020
01:22:20,652 --> 01:22:22,692
你怎麼還是這樣？
You never stop, do you?

1021
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:25,027
不，這是真的，真的。
No, really! Really!

1022
01:22:25,156 --> 01:22:29,783
這就是我喜歡你的原因，我從不知道你
下一句會說什麼，過來。
That's why I like you. I never know
what you'll say next. Come here.

1023
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:36,076
-門鎖聲
-迪茲。
- (door lock rattles)
- Dez.

1024
01:22:38,795 --> 01:22:40,834
-那是什麼？
-不知道。
- What is that?
- I dunno.

1025
01:22:43,174 --> 01:22:45,213
有人想進來。
Someone's trying to get in.

1026
01:22:55,393 --> 01:22:57,386
哦，天啊。
Oh, my God.

1027
01:22:57,521 --> 01:22:59,514
哦，是吉姆。
Oh, my God, it's Jim.

1028
01:22:59,647 --> 01:23:01,687
天啊。
Oh, my God.

1029
01:23:04,653 --> 01:23:08,188
吉姆，吉姆。
Jim... Jim. Jim.

1030
01:23:08,656 --> 01:23:13,698
謝天謝地，你嚇壞我了。你覺得怎麼樣，啊？
Thank God. You had me worried.
How you doing, man? Huh? Huh?

1031
01:23:13,828 --> 01:23:16,699
有人打我了，一片黑。
Somebody jumped me. It was dark.

1032
01:23:17,415 --> 01:23:19,574
嗯，呃…
Yeah. uh...

1033
01:23:20,126 --> 01:23:22,165
是我幹的。
It was me.

1034
01:23:22,921 --> 01:23:25,458
我以為你是別人呢。
I thought you were somebody else.

1035
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:27,629
你以為我是誰？
Who did you think I was?

1036
01:23:29,218 --> 01:23:32,801
有人跟蹤了蘇珊，我想你可能是他。
Somebody's been following Susan.
I thought maybe you were him.

1037
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:34,887
誰跟蹤她？
Who's following her?

1038
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,759
不知道。
I don't know.

1039
01:23:36,892 --> 01:23:38,684
你知道蘇珊。
You know Susan.

1040
01:23:38,811 --> 01:23:42,262
從她那裡得到一個清楚的答案真是困難。
It's really tough
to get a straight answer out of her.

1041
01:23:44,525 --> 01:23:46,518
她需要我，迪茲。
She needs me, Dez.

1042
01:23:46,651 --> 01:23:48,977
我想或許她準備安頓下來了。
I think maybe she's ready to settle down.

1043
01:23:49,113 --> 01:23:53,573
安頓下來？蘇珊？別扯了，吉姆。
Settle down? Susan? Come on, Jim!

1044
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:56,785
她從沒有做過什麼安頓的事，
她不是那類人。
She'd never do that.
She's really not the type.

1045
01:23:56,911 --> 01:23:58,904
從什麼時候你這麼瞭解她？
Since when do you know her so well?

1046
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:03,118
呃，我只是不能看見她安頓下來。
我是說，她太野性了。
Well, I just can't see her settling down.
I mean, she's too wild.

1047
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:05,577
但是這也是她的魅力。
But that's what's so great about her.

1048
01:24:05,711 --> 01:24:07,289
是這樣嗎？
Is that so?

1049
01:24:07,421 --> 01:24:10,755
我是說，你真的好像對她做了一番檢查。
I mean, you really seem
to have examined this.

1050
01:24:11,468 --> 01:24:14,551
嗯，我們一起度過了一些時間。
Well, we've been spending
some time together.

1051
01:24:17,598 --> 01:24:20,350
可…你在說什麼呀，迪茲？
Just... what are you saying here, Dez?

1052
01:24:20,476 --> 01:24:21,886
啊？
Huh?

1053
01:24:24,355 --> 01:24:26,596
我不想對你胡說八道，吉姆。
I'm not gonna bullshit you, Jim.

1054
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:29,816
是一件不好出口的事，
我沒說它沒有。
It was a shitty thing to do.
I'm not saying it wasn't.

1055
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:33,689
但是你自己說她誘人的。
But you yourself said she was irresistible.

1056
01:24:36,033 --> 01:24:38,072
哦，不會吧。
Oh, man.

1057
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:41,701
你，你為什麼不再打我一下，就像這樣的，
把我結果了？
W-why don't you just hit me again
and, like, finish me off?

1058
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:43,870
-你看…
-啊？
- Look...
- Huh?!

1059
01:24:43,998 --> 01:24:46,537
別哭喊了。我真的為她而瘋狂…
Don't cry about it.
I'm really crazy about her...

1060
01:24:46,669 --> 01:24:48,660
…而且她也為我而瘋狂。
...and she's really crazy about me.

1061
01:24:48,795 --> 01:24:51,121
-我對不起，
-聽著，我瞭解蘇珊。
- I'm sorry.
- Listen. I know Susan.

1062
01:24:51,255 --> 01:24:53,462
無論她告訴什麼都是胡扯。
Whatever she told you doesn't mean shit.

1063
01:24:53,592 --> 01:24:57,755
她不是認真的，迪茲。我是知道的，
我追了她好幾年了。
She plays with people, Dez. I oughta
know, I've been chasing her for years.

1064
01:24:57,887 --> 01:25:00,259
我認為她跟我是認真的。
I don't think she's playing with me.

1065
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:02,429
胡說。
Bullshit.

1066
01:25:03,184 --> 01:25:05,058
這樣吧，吉姆。
All right, Jim.

1067
01:25:05,186 --> 01:25:07,226
我們幹嘛不問問她呢？
Why don't we just ask her?

1068
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:11,185
蘇珊。
Susan!

1069
01:25:11,317 --> 01:25:13,605
蘇…她在這兒？
Su...! You mean she's here?!

1070
01:25:14,987 --> 01:25:16,398
蘇珊。
Susan!

1071
01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:18,986
-到這兒來。
-蘇珊。
- Come on out here.
- Susan...!

1072
01:25:22,578 --> 01:25:24,618
蘇珊。
Susan!

1073
01:25:34,089 --> 01:25:36,129
她走了。
She's gone.

1074
01:25:38,052 --> 01:25:40,008
她就在這兒。
She was here.

1075
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:42,176
我發誓。
I swear to God.

1076
01:25:42,306 --> 01:25:44,344
水壺鳴響
(kettle whistles)

1077
01:26:34,188 --> 01:26:36,228
迪茲，你在上面嗎？
(Jim) Dez, are you up there?

1078
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,310
怎麼了？
Yeah?

1079
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:44,113
猜猜怎麼了？
我想她把我倆都耍了。
Guess what, man?
I think she's jerking us both around.

1080
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,865
你什麼意思？
What do you mean?

1081
01:26:45,991 --> 01:26:49,443
你看看吧，這個他媽的陌生人是誰？
Check this out.
I mean, who the hell is this stranger?

1082
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:50,824
鼓
(drum roll)

1083
01:27:05,427 --> 01:27:08,096
蘇珊，我還是不明白我們來這兒幹什麼。
Susan, I still don't understand
why we're here.

1084
01:27:08,221 --> 01:27:10,511
信我吧，加裡。你會驚喜萬分的。
Trust me, Gar.
You're in for a real surprise.

1085
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:13,559
你的驚喜萬分已經讓我緊張了。
Your surprises are beginning
to make me nervous.

1086
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:16,473
-她怎麼說？
-我們會驚喜萬分的。
- What'd she say?
- We're in for a real surprise.

1087
01:27:16,605 --> 01:27:19,060
我想我們在這兒看不到Tony Bennett。
I guess we're not gonna see
Tony Bennett here.

1088
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:21,230
我應該叫警察跟著我們。
I'd settle for a police escort.

1089
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,194
你怎麼能讓她穿上羅伯塔的夾克？
How could you let her wear
Roberta's jacket?

1090
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:28,449
嘿，她沒衣服了，總得穿點什麼吧。
Hey, she's cold.
She's gotta wear something.

1091
01:27:28,574 --> 01:27:30,947
為什麼你不把你的指甲剪了？
(dummy) Why don't you
cut your fingernails?

1092
01:27:31,077 --> 01:27:33,366
我聽不見你在說啥…
I can't hear what you're saying...

1093
01:27:33,496 --> 01:27:35,536
摀住叫喊
(muffled shouting)

1094
01:27:40,045 --> 01:27:43,994
迪茲，如果她看到我們倆都在這兒，
她很可能又一走了之。
Dez, if she sees us both here,
she'll probably just split again.

1095
01:27:44,132 --> 01:27:46,171
那你回去吧。
You could go home.

1096
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,254
我要看看他媽的陌生人是誰。
I wanna see who this fuckin' stranger is.

1097
01:27:56,352 --> 01:28:00,432
讓我猜。三倍龍舌蘭到天亮。
Let me guess. Triple tequila sunrise.

1098
01:28:00,564 --> 01:28:02,640
姜味汽水。
Ginger ale.

1099
01:28:05,443 --> 01:28:07,353
你是威士忌。
And you're the Scotch.

1100
01:28:07,487 --> 01:28:09,397
這是你的。
This must be yours.

1101
01:28:09,532 --> 01:28:11,570
朗姆酒和Tab。
Rum and Tab.

1102
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:18,991
坐著別動，我去找找陌生人。
Sit tight. I'm gonna
go look for the stranger.

1103
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:21,997
什麼陌生人？
What stranger?

1104
01:28:22,127 --> 01:28:25,293
-天，她可真迷人。
-一坨漂亮的屎罷了。
- God, she's gorgeous.
- Beauty feces.

1105
01:28:38,392 --> 01:28:39,887
她在那。
There she is.

1106
01:28:40,019 --> 01:28:43,305
-哪？
-就在那兒，和買煙女說話的那個。
- Where?
- Right there. Talking to the cigarette girl.

1107
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,226
那不是蘇珊。我之前從沒見過那個女孩。
That's not Susan.
I never even seen that girl before.

1108
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:48,980
迪茲，那是蘇珊。你認為我能搞錯嗎？
Dez, that's Susan.
Don't you think I should know?

1109
01:28:49,903 --> 01:28:53,320
那可能是蘇珊，但不是我的蘇珊。
That might be a Susan
but that's not my Susan.

1110
01:28:53,449 --> 01:28:57,031
-那是我的蘇珊。
-那麼在巴特利公園的女孩是誰？
- That's my Susan.
- Then who was the girl at Battery Park?

1111
01:29:13,092 --> 01:29:15,085
誰是陌生人？
So who's the stranger?

1112
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:17,295
吉米！
Jimmy!

1113
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:19,470
誰是陌生人？
Who's the stranger?

1114
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:22,090
-說來話長。
-嗯啊。
- It's a long story.
- uh-huh.

1115
01:29:22,226 --> 01:29:24,350
你怎麼也不會知道她的。
You wouldn't know her anyway.

1116
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:26,518
-她？
-是，她。
- Her?
- Yeah. Her.

1117
01:29:29,275 --> 01:29:31,945
過來，找個私人空間去說話。
Come on. We'll talk about it in private.

1118
01:29:34,656 --> 01:29:36,694
敲門
(knocking)

1119
01:29:36,824 --> 01:29:39,445
我們還有三分鐘上場。
We've got three minutes before curtain!

1120
01:29:39,576 --> 01:29:41,616
戴上你的假髮馬上出發。
Get your wig on and get out there!

1121
01:29:49,961 --> 01:29:51,954
我在想蘇珊會不會出事。
I wonder what happened to Susan.

1122
01:29:52,089 --> 01:29:54,330
看起來像是你丟了女友。
Looks like you lost your girlfriend.

1123
01:29:54,466 --> 01:29:56,792
嘿，賴瑞，我結婚了，懂嗎？
Hey, Larry! I'm married, all right?

1124
01:29:56,927 --> 01:29:59,215
-哦，得了吧。
-怎麼？
- Oh, please!
- What?

1125
01:29:59,346 --> 01:30:01,386
樂隊聲
(band plays fanfare)

1126
01:30:06,144 --> 01:30:08,765
晚上好，女士們先生們。
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1127
01:30:08,896 --> 01:30:12,182
歡迎來到魔術俱樂部，我是主持人，雷。
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Ray...

1128
01:30:13,735 --> 01:30:16,605
酒吧生，給我結帳吧。
Bartender...
Can I have the check, please?

1129
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:21,109
有誰從女皇區出來的嗎？
Hey, is there anyone out here
from, uh... Queens?

1130
01:30:21,242 --> 01:30:23,733
你。好的。我自己是從正常人家的肚子裡出來的。
You. Well, I'm from
normal parents myself.

1131
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:25,067
零星笑聲
(scattered laughter)

1132
01:30:25,204 --> 01:30:29,616
是這樣的，今晚我們給大家一個特別的待遇。
Anyway, we got a special treat
for you people this evening.

1133
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:32,206
讓我介紹一下獨一無二的，舉世無雙的…
Introducing the one, the only...

1134
01:30:32,669 --> 01:30:34,709
蘇珊，快上來。
Susan, get up here!

1135
01:30:34,839 --> 01:30:38,124
…還有他可愛的助手，Davina…
...and his very lovely assistant, Davina...

1136
01:30:38,258 --> 01:30:41,544
…今夜女王，鼓掌吧。
...Queen of the Night! So let's hear it!

1137
01:30:52,523 --> 01:30:55,726
加裡，那是…
(Leslie) Gary... Is that...

1138
01:30:55,858 --> 01:30:58,350
不會吧。
It can't be.

1139
01:30:58,487 --> 01:31:01,322
我太喜歡了，真是好魔術啊。
I'm really enjoying this. It's a great trick.

1140
01:31:09,914 --> 01:31:11,706
蘇珊？
Susan?

1141
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:14,787
-羅伯塔？
-我不敢相信。
- Roberta?
- I don't believe it.

1142
01:31:15,544 --> 01:31:18,331
-羅伯塔…
-加裡，坐下。
- Roberta...
- Gary, sit down.

1143
01:31:26,013 --> 01:31:28,504
呃，我在這兒呆會兒，謝謝。
uh... I think I'll be staying, thank you.

1144
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,218
鼓
(drum roll)

1145
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,997
煙，要煙嗎？
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1146
01:31:57,210 --> 01:31:59,451
她還是很有型的啊。
She's really got style in a way.

1147
01:31:59,587 --> 01:32:01,627
她很不錯啊，加裡。
She's good, Gary.

1148
01:32:03,258 --> 01:32:05,297
哦，對不起。
(Larry) Right. Sorry.

1149
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,070
尖叫
(Roberta screams)

1150
01:32:43,379 --> 01:32:45,419
(screams)

1151
01:32:47,967 --> 01:32:49,794
哇哦！
Bravo!

1152
01:32:54,599 --> 01:32:57,268
是他，就是他。
That's him. That's the guy.

1153
01:33:00,313 --> 01:33:01,392
就是他！
That's the guy!

1154
01:33:01,522 --> 01:33:03,314
嗨，救救我。
Hey, help me!

1155
01:33:03,899 --> 01:33:06,816
嘿，就是他，就是他，救命。
Hey! That's the guy!
That's the guy! Help!

1156
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,562
來人抓住他，幫幫我。
Somebody stop that guy! Help!

1157
01:33:14,618 --> 01:33:16,741
怎麼…羅伯塔。
What... Roberta!

1158
01:33:16,871 --> 01:33:19,278
-羅伯塔。
-你是誰？
- Roberta!
- Who are you?

1159
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,664
怎麼了？
What's going on?!

1160
01:33:29,132 --> 01:33:31,421
-他打傷你了？我殺了他。
-加裡。
- Did he hurt you? I'll kill him!
- Gary!

1161
01:33:31,552 --> 01:33:34,587
-沒事了，我現在可以搞定了。
-這人是誰？
- It's OK, I can take care of it now.
- Who is this guy?

1162
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,760
你是誰？你什麼意思，我是誰？
Who are you?
What do you mean, who am I?

1163
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:38,717
-拜託…
-哦。
- Please...
- Oh.

1164
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:43,009
加裡，迪茲。
Gary... Dez.

1165
01:33:43,146 --> 01:33:45,815
迪茲，他是加裡，我丈夫。
Dez, this is Gary, my husband.

1166
01:33:46,649 --> 01:33:48,476
嗨。
Hi.

1167
01:33:48,609 --> 01:33:51,610
-做熱水盆的生意人？
-是。
- The hot-tub salesman?
- Yeah.

1168
01:33:51,738 --> 01:33:54,573
這麼說你昨晚告訴我的是真的了。
So you were telling me
the truth last night.

1169
01:33:54,699 --> 01:33:56,738
昨晚？哦，不。
Last night? Oh, no.

1170
01:33:56,867 --> 01:33:59,193
-你和他過了一夜？
-加裡…
- Did you spend the night with him?
- Gary...

1171
01:33:59,328 --> 01:34:02,199
-他就是警察提到的拉皮條的？
-他不是拉皮條的。
- Is he the pimp the police mentioned?
- He's not a pimp!

1172
01:34:02,331 --> 01:34:04,370
我不是拉皮條的，我是她一個朋友。
I'm not a pimp. I'm a friend of hers.

1173
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:07,536
-有誰呢能告訴我發生什麼了？
-我自己都不知道。
- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- I'm not sure myself.

1174
01:34:07,669 --> 01:34:09,709
-這段時間我糟糕透了…
-我也是。
- I'm having a hard time...
- So am I!

1175
01:34:09,838 --> 01:34:13,421
先停一停，停一停。
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Please, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1176
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:14,961
聽我說。
OK, listen.

1177
01:34:15,093 --> 01:34:20,005
迪茲，迪茲，我需要和加裡單獨談一談，好嗎？
Dez. Dez, I really need to talk
to Gary alone, OK? Please?

1178
01:34:21,058 --> 01:34:22,600
好吧。
OK.

1179
01:34:22,726 --> 01:34:25,181
我也需要自己靜一靜。
I really need some time alone too.

1180
01:34:26,020 --> 01:34:28,060
對不起。
I'm sorry.

1181
01:34:37,073 --> 01:34:40,690
都過去了，沒事了，噩夢結束了。
It's all right. It's all right.
The nightmare's over.

1182
01:34:43,162 --> 01:34:45,201
彈球機
(pinball machine pinging)

1183
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,007
別吱吱叫，你要把我帶出去。
Don't make a peep.
You're gonna get me outta here.

1184
01:34:58,135 --> 01:35:00,174
低叫
(Susan whimpers)

1185
01:35:00,387 --> 01:35:02,427
腿不錯。
Nice legs.

1186
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:09,388
-我不明白你和那個傢伙為什麼會在這兒。
-你又為什麼在這兒？
- I don't understand why you're here.
- Why are you here?

1187
01:35:09,521 --> 01:35:12,308
等等，先別管那個，你為什麼離開我？
Wait a minute. Never mind that.
Why did you leave me?

1188
01:35:12,441 --> 01:35:14,350
那是某種意外的事。
It was sort of an accident.

1189
01:35:14,485 --> 01:35:17,272
意外？當你在拉客也是個意外了？
When you were soliciting,
that was an accident, too?

1190
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:19,443
是的，當然是，加裡。
Yes, of course! Gary!

1191
01:35:19,864 --> 01:35:22,153
一切都是從尋人啟事開始的。
It all started with the personals.

1192
01:35:22,283 --> 01:35:25,319
那是給蘇珊的廣告，《不顧一切找蘇珊》。
There was this ad for Susan.
"Desperately seeking Susan."

1193
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:33,868
他到哪裡去了？
Where did he go?

1194
01:35:34,003 --> 01:35:36,672
所以他們就認為我是個妓女而把我逮捕了。
So they thought
I was a prostitute and arrested me.

1195
01:35:36,797 --> 01:35:38,671
羅伯塔，你是同性戀嗎？
Roberta, are you a lesbian?

1196
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:41,337
萊斯莉說很多妓女都是同性戀。
Leslie said
lots of prostitutes are lesbians.

1197
01:35:41,468 --> 01:35:45,052
加裡，你沒有聽我在說什麼，
我不是妓女，也不是同性戀。
Gary, you're not listening to me.
I'm not a prostitute or a lesbian!

1198
01:35:45,181 --> 01:35:48,549
我們需要找專業人員來幫助你，
我不管那要花多少錢。
We'll get professional help.
I don't care how much it costs.

1199
01:35:48,684 --> 01:35:52,728
-我只要你現在跟我回家。
-為什麼？
- I just want you to come home with me.
- Why?

1200
01:35:52,854 --> 01:35:55,346
為什麼？你什麼意思，為什麼？
Why? What do you mean, why?

1201
01:35:55,483 --> 01:35:57,558
為什麼你要我跟你一起回家？
Why do you want me
to come home with you?

1202
01:35:57,692 --> 01:35:59,685
拜託，別那麼激動，行嗎？
Come on, don't get excited, all right?

1203
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:01,942
你是吸毒了還是吃什麼了？
What, are you on drugs
or something now?

1204
01:36:02,072 --> 01:36:04,065
天啊。
God.

1205
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,907
看著我。
Look at me.

1206
01:36:06,034 --> 01:36:08,704
我看著呢，你看起來像個怪物。
I looked at you. You look ridiculous.

1207
01:36:08,829 --> 01:36:12,446
我是說看著我，加裡，看著我。
I mean look at me, Gary.
Look at me.

1208
01:36:20,089 --> 01:36:22,710
我不和你一起回家。
I'm not coming home with you.

1209
01:36:24,051 --> 01:36:26,341
你只不過是累了。
You're just tired.

1210
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:32,341
為什麼你不換套衣服，然後我們在家中討論這個？
Why don't you get changed
and we'll talk about it at home?

1211
01:36:32,476 --> 01:36:34,219
來吧，來吧。
Come on. Come on.

1212
01:36:38,315 --> 01:36:39,691
很好，這很好。
Fine. That's fine.

1213
01:36:39,816 --> 01:36:44,395
呃，我先去外邊，我只等你五分鐘。
uh... I'm gonna go outside
and I'm gonna wait for five minutes.

1214
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:49,110
如果你不過來，我就自己走了。
And if you're not there,
I'm gonna leave without you.

1215
01:36:50,827 --> 01:36:52,867
再見，加裡。
Goodbye, Gary.

1216
01:37:25,611 --> 01:37:27,651
嘿，哇！
Hey! Whoa!

1217
01:37:32,618 --> 01:37:34,657
你從哪裡得到的？
Where did you get this?

1218
01:37:35,871 --> 01:37:37,911
別動。
Stay!

1219
01:37:44,171 --> 01:37:46,210
蘇珊，這是怎麼回事？
Susan, what's going on?

1220
01:37:54,306 --> 01:37:55,586
救救我。
(whispers) Help me!

1221
01:37:57,225 --> 01:37:59,052
別推我。
Don't push!

1222
01:38:09,653 --> 01:38:11,646
動作好快，陌生人。
Good goin', stranger.

1223
01:38:11,781 --> 01:38:13,820
蘇珊。
Susan.

1224
01:38:24,459 --> 01:38:26,536
-嗨。
-笑
- Hi.
- (giggling)

1225
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:28,709
怎麼了？
What's going on?

1226
01:38:28,839 --> 01:38:30,997
朋友們，現在是決戰時刻了。
My friend, this is the crucial moment.

1227
01:38:31,508 --> 01:38:34,841
我們把主力轉移到船上。
Our force field power plant
has been transferred to the ship.

1228
01:38:35,011 --> 01:38:38,215
我們的防線在敵人最薄弱的地方，
完全可以視實際情況而機動作戰。
Our defences are at their weakest,
almost fully automatic.

1229
01:38:38,348 --> 01:38:42,215
突然襲擊的成功可能性是非常大的。
The likelihood of a successful
mutant attack is at its strongest.

1230
01:38:42,352 --> 01:38:46,681
-並且他們可能沒有意識到。
-我們努力保持這種狀況…
- But they may be unaware.
- We've tried to keep them away...

1231
01:39:01,746 --> 01:39:03,454
哎呦。
Ow!

1232
01:39:03,581 --> 01:39:06,368
-嗨。
-嗨。
- Hi.
- Hi.

1233
01:39:08,502 --> 01:39:11,538
你怎麼樣了？
Huh. How are you doin'?

1234
01:39:12,465 --> 01:39:14,504
還行。
OK.

1235
01:39:16,844 --> 01:39:19,549
那麼我猜你的名字不叫蘇珊，啊？
So I guess your name isn't Susan, huh?

1236
01:39:20,973 --> 01:39:23,012
那麼是什麼？
So what is it?

1237
01:39:23,141 --> 01:39:26,095
羅伯塔。
Roberta.

1238
01:39:26,228 --> 01:39:29,098
-羅伯塔。
-嗯。嗯。
- Roberta.
- Mm-hm.

1239
01:39:31,358 --> 01:39:33,397
多好的名字。
That's nice.

1240
01:40:20,273 --> 01:40:25,209
多好的一對！
WHAT A PAIR!

1241
01:40:26,566 --> 01:41:16,563
