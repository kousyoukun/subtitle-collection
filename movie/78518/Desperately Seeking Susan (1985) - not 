00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,825
在他变认真之前很有趣。
It was fun till he started getting serious.

135
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:07,491
-最近怎么样？
-说真的，我真想辞职。
- How's tricks?
- I'm ready to quit this dump. I really am.

136
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,493
雷不让我带眼镜…
Ray won't let me wear my glasses,...

137
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,343
所以当我不能配合时蓝就大怒。
...then lan gets pissed off
when I can't do the tricks.

138
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,515
我是说，我真的看不见啊！
I mean, I'm only legally blind!

139
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:17,479
我可以理解，如果我把眼镜戴在乳房上…
I could understand
if I wore my glasses on my tits,...

140
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:19,598
…那就不会有人看我的脸了。
...but nobody here looks at my face!

141
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,222
拜托，离开这地方吧。
Come on, let's just get outta here.

142
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,700
-我必须去做那只消失的蓝鸟。
-听起来不错。
- I have to do the Disappearing Bluebird.
- Sounds great.

143
00:13:24,728 --> 00:13:26,767
-你不能等等？
-我真的累了。
- Can't you wait?
- I'm really tired.

144
00:13:27,896 --> 00:13:30,103
我可以叫一些皮萨在家中等你。
I could get some pizza
and meet you at home.

145
00:13:30,232 --> 00:13:33,351
-你找到一个地方了？
-不算是。
- You've got a place?
- Not exactly.

146
00:13:33,485 --> 00:13:35,525
只是我在那里工作。
But I'm working on it.

147
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:38,402
哦，不，我知道你要说什么了。
Oh, no. I know what's coming now.

148
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:40,572
我保证，就今晚。
Just for tonight, I promise.

149
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,740
求你了。
Come on!

150
00:13:44,246 --> 00:13:47,032
你能保证电话只响七次吗？
Do you promise
only seven-digit phone calls?

151
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:49,490
发誓。你不会后悔的。
Cross my heart. You won't regret it.

152
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,542
多谢。
Thanks.

153
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,545
欢迎回来。
Welcome back.

154
00:13:55,673 --> 00:13:57,582
待会儿见。
I'll see you later.

155
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:26,074
嗨，美人儿，拿一张报纸吧。
Hey, baby. Take a paper.

156
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:39,544
哇，怎么这样。
Wow, I don't believe it.

157
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,936
大西洋城治安环境暴降
暴徒从旅店窗户上落下
ATLANTIC CITY PLUNGE
MOBSTER FALLS FROM HOTEL WINDOW

158
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,300

159
00:15:14,166 --> 00:15:16,205
鼓声
(drumming)

160
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,149
打扰！
(man) Excuse me!

161
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,905
-有火吗？
-没有，我不抽烟。
- You got a light?
- No, I don't smoke.

162
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,452
苏珊！
Susan!

163
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,833
你怎么不对我说一声再见就离开了？
How come you split
without saying goodbye in person?

164
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,167
每个人见面了都说再见。
Everybody says goodbye in person.

165
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,003
来吧，一起喝一杯。
Come on. Let's go get a drink.

166
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,753
可以，但是只能一会儿。

-已经是最后的准备工作。
- Oh, great...
- It's a last-minute thing.

168
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,554
今晚我们在Buffalo做一次演唱会。
The band got this gig in Buffalo
and we start tonight.

169
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,007
下次别在报纸上登广告了，行吗？
Next time don't put
an ad in the paper, OK?

170
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:02,309
苏珊，我每周都在找你。
Susan, I've been looking for you
for weeks!

171
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,330

(Jim) I'll find some trouble
for you to get into.

175
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,310
我现在已经没闲心了。
I've had enough trouble already.

176
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,601
你…你和这人睡过？
You... you were with this guy?

177
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:21,693
我离开时他还活着。
He was breathing when I left.

178
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,771
嗨，你们美女和野兽两位，
我可不想在桥上出事，快走！
Hey! Beauty and the Beast,
we'll hit traffic on the bridge. Let's fly!

179

《生之欲》

我不能就这样离开你。

这样，我给你一个电话…
Look, I'll give you a number. uh...

183
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:38,875
有笔吗？
You got a pen?

184
00:17:40,422 --> 00:17:43,542
好了，这是我朋友迪兹的电话。
All right, this is the number
of my friend Dez.

185
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,714
他人不错…

186
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:49,712
…如果你有困难了就打给他，他知道怎么联系我。
...and if you really get in a jam, call him.
He'll know how to reach me.

别寻刺激了，好吗？

00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:09,571
我要看看我能干出什么来。

Yo! Come back!

203
00:19:22,271 --> 00:19:24,678
还给我眼镜，怎么回事啊？
Give me my glasses, babe!
What's the matter?

204

当你离开

我不想继续你的错误
# Ain't gonna do you wrong

因为我不想

就是你回家时当我问起…

…那一点点尊严

I gotta have 'em, but 65 bucks...

222
00:20:57,905 --> 00:21:00,028

它曾经可是猫王的。

# Oh, hey! A little respect...

235
00:22:31,579 --> 00:22:33,820
我们从鸡蛋开始

两个两个打，动作要快
These go very fast done two by two.

237

你可以在早晨做

然后准备开始做菜。

我会用新方法来做。

240
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,258
这有六个鸡蛋了。
There are your six eggs.

241

00:23:06,446 --> 00:23:08,486
我得在镇上陪他吃饭。

嗯，对，是，我忘了。
um... Yeah, right, I guess I did.

254
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:32,011
你可以说你不吃晚饭了，而我却忙的不可开交。
You could have said
you didn't want dinner. I had to rush!

255
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:34,130
你忙什么了？你说你什么地方都没去。
You said you didn't go anywhere.

256

夹克。曾经是Jimi Hendrix的夹克。
A jacket.
It used to belong to Jimi Hendrix.

怎么，我们是穷人吗？
You bought a used jacket?
What, are we poor?

259
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:46,481
你这是怎么啦？
What's going on here?

260
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:54,821
罗伯塔，我必须要去了。
Roberta, I gotta run! I'm late.

261
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:57,110
我们晚些再谈吧。
We'll talk later, all right?

262

晚些谈。
All right, we'll talk later?

263

(clattering)

265
00:24:24,104 --> 00:24:26,144
电视声
(TV continues)

266
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:37,078
警方寻找神秘女人

267
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:00,428
你卖了？
You sold it?

268
00:25:01,391 --> 00:25:04,760
我落下了开储物柜的钥匙！
I had a key that was important.
I got my shit inside a locker.

269
00:25:04,895 --> 00:25:08,429
-我卖了。
-我留下名字和电话。
- I sold it!
- I'll leave you my name and number.

270
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:37,797
动作好快，陌生人！
Good goin', stranger.

271
00:25:38,927 --> 00:25:40,966
什么他妈的陌生人？
Well, what fuckin' stranger?!

272
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:43,966
大型通铺。这意味着尿裤子。
Festival seating. That means Portosans.

273
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:48,428
尿裤子就是站着撒尿，我不想站着撒尿。
Portosans means pissing with flies.
I'm not gonna piss with flies.

274
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:52,097
你们男人可以尿在瓶子里。
这算什么？木房子？
You guys can piss in bottles.
What the hell is this? Woodstock?

275
00:26:10,332 --> 00:26:12,372
电话声
(phone rings)

276
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,996
-放映员
-迪兹，是我，吉姆。
- Projection.
- Dez, it's me. Jim.

277
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:19,959
等一会儿。
Hold on a second.

278
00:26:22,928 --> 00:26:24,967
哦，我的天啊。
Jesus Christ!

279
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:29,046
我在Buffalo脱不了身，请你帮个忙，
是关于苏珊的。
I'm stuck in Buffalo and I need a favour.
It's about Susan.

280
00:26:29,184 --> 00:26:34,973
是这样，她在大西洋城遇到的一个家伙
被人从旅店的窗户上扔了出去。
See, now some guy she met in Atlantic
City got pushed out of a hotel window.

281
00:26:35,106 --> 00:26:37,348
这里太乱了，我没听见。
This sounds wild. I'm sorry I missed it.

282
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:39,523
迪兹，我没开玩笑。
This is serious, Dez.

283
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:44,065
现在，一个署名陌生人的家伙登出启事
要在巴特利公园见她
And now some guy's run an ad to meet
her in Battery Park, signed "a stranger".

284
00:26:44,198 --> 00:26:48,326
这有点怪了，你能不能
It sounds weird.
Could you just go down there...

285
00:26:48,453 --> 00:26:50,326
去看一下她安全吗？
...and make sure she's OK?

286
00:26:50,455 --> 00:26:54,452
吉姆，维多利亚昨晚刚甩了我，
我心情糟透了。
Jim, Victoria split on me last night.
I'm in a shitty mood.

287
00:26:54,584 --> 00:26:57,454
我没法立刻就变成你的童子军。
I'm not in the mood for being a boy scout
right now.

288
00:26:57,587 --> 00:26:59,828
拜托了，迪兹，就耽误你半个小时。
Come on, Dez.
It'll take you half an hour.

289
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:03,547
-好了没有？
-马上就好，一秒钟就好。
- (man) Come on!
- Give me a chance here. One second.

290
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:05,254
起哄声
(booing)

291
00:27:05,386 --> 00:27:09,086
-她在四点去见他。
-四点？那可要差不多一个小时！
- She's got to meet him at 4 o'clock.
- That's in less than an hour!

292
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:11,430
吉姆，我可是有工作的人！
Jim, I got a job here, you know!

293
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:13,598
我求你了。
This one favour.

294
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:16,182
即使我能找到人替我
Even if I could get someone
to fill in for me,...

295
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:18,472
可我连她长得什么样都不知道。
...I don't even know what she looks like.

296
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,646
听着，你不会找不到她的。
Look, you can't miss her.

297
00:27:20,775 --> 00:27:24,359
她很好看，金发，还有，中等身材
She's incredibly pretty,
blonde hair, uh... medium height.

298
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,860
还有她穿着绿色的，上面画着金色的…
And she's got this green and gold jacket...

299
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:31,237
一个锥形，一只眼睛在上面，就像钞票上那样。
（共济会标志）你肯定能找到她。
...with a pyramid with an eye on top
like a dollar bill. You can't miss it.

300
00:27:31,369 --> 00:27:35,616
-好吧，你要请我吃饭啊。
-行，多谢，我一定请你。
- All right, you owe me one.
- Great. Thanks, Dez, I appreciate it.

301
00:27:35,748 --> 00:27:37,788
好的，再见。
OK, yeah. Bye.

302
00:27:39,002 --> 00:27:41,041
我一辈子都在纽约。
I lived in New York all my life.

303
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:44,337
我们老去中餐馆，意餐馆
We used to have Chinese restaurants,
ltalian restaurants.

304
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,834
现在你去吃寿司。所有人都吃寿司。
Now you have these sushi restaurants.
Everyone goes for sushi.

305
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:50,008
寿司，我讨厌这东西。
Sushi... I hate the stuff.

306
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:52,889
我跟你说，尽管我有一天我买了一些，
Although, I tell you,
I had some the other day.

307
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:56,764
回家做了，还不错的，味道像鱼。
I took it home, I cooked it, it wasn't bad.
It tasted like fish.

308
00:27:56,894 --> 00:27:58,933
鼓声
(drumming)

309
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:25,751
9块2.
$9.20.

310
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:30,089
给，不用找了。
Here, keep the change.

311
00:28:30,218 --> 00:28:33,385
哇，这是什么？嗨，女士！
Whoa! Hey! What is that? Hey, lady!

312
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:35,552
嗨，女士！
Hey! Hey, lady!

313
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,639
这算什么？
What is this?

314
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,676
靠，刁民！
Oh, that's cute!

315
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:46,438
嗨
Hi.

316
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:51,107
我以前好像见过你。
You look like I've seen you
somewhere before.

317
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:54,109
-不，我想不是。
-我想是。
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I think so.

318
00:28:56,618 --> 00:29:00,366
-你现在在做什么事情吗？
-我在等人。
- You doin' anything right now?
- I'm waiting for someone.

319
00:29:11,091 --> 00:29:14,294
-跟我走，小姐。
-你不明白，我必须去见一个人。
- Come with me, miss.
- I have to meet someone.

320
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:17,381
-我们谈谈出租车里的事情。
-她那里有我所有的东西。
- We'll talk about it in the car.
- She's got all my stuff.

321
00:29:17,514 --> 00:29:20,265
她会给你他妈的打车费。
She'll give you the goddamn cab fare!

322
00:29:21,601 --> 00:29:25,301
我也不想这样，可我也得生活。
(driver) I don't need this aggravation.
I work for a living.

323
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:27,477
想吃霸王餐，我知道法律。
Theft of services. I know the law.

324
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,268
嗨，打扰了，你喜欢吃糖吗？
Well, hi!
Excuse me, but do you like candy?

325
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,155
-我这有甜甜糖。
-不，谢谢。
- I got some Sugar Babies.
- No, thank you.

326
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:39,908
我久想谈一谈，我认识你在大西洋城的的男朋友。
I wanted to have a chat. I was very close
to your boyfriend in Atlantic City.

327
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:44,033
-不可能，我结婚了。
-我不这样想。
- No, no, no. I'm married.
- No, I don't think so!

328
00:29:49,753 --> 00:29:51,164
苏珊？
Susan!

329
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,621
你有一对他给你的漂亮的耳环吗？
Did you wear the pretty earrings
he gave you?

330
00:29:53,757 --> 00:29:57,458
-我们得谈谈，我的车就在附近。
-放开我！
- Let's have a chat. My car is over there.
- Let go of me!

331
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,382
-苏珊。
-让我走。
- Susan!
- Let go!

332
00:30:00,514 --> 00:30:02,921
-罗伯塔尖叫
-苏珊！
- (Roberta screams)
- Susan!

333
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:18,360
苏珊？
(Dez) Susan?

334
00:30:19,658 --> 00:30:21,696
苏珊
Susan?

335
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:26,112
-发生什么了？
-你怎么样？
- What happened?
- Are you OK?

336
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,079
我头疼。
My head hurts.

337
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,367
我是迪兹，吉姆的朋友。
I'm Dez. I'm a friend of Jim's.

338
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:34,500
吉姆？
Jim?

339
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,331
你男友吉姆。和你争吵的那人是谁？
Your boyfriend Jim.
Who was the guy hassling you?

340
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:42,878
-谁？
-刚刚跑掉的那人。
- Guy?
- The guy that just ran off.

341
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:48,097
-我不知道。
-你不知道？
- I dunno.
- You don't know?

342
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,640
-我不记得了。
-你记不起来了？
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

343
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:55,771
你还好吗？
Are you OK?

344
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:57,940
要不要去医院？
Do you wanna see a doctor?

345
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,275
-我还好。
-你还可以。
- I'm OK.
- You're OK.

346
00:31:03,283 --> 00:31:05,322
她还好，散了吧。
She's OK. Show's over.

347
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:07,574
他跟我来的，她还好。
She's with me, she's OK.

348
00:31:09,205 --> 00:31:11,244
要坐下吗？
Sit down?

349
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,998
你什么都不记得了吗？
Do you remember anything?

350
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:17,167
不知道。
I don't know.

351
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:19,336
你怎么到这儿来的？
How did you get here?

352
00:31:19,465 --> 00:31:21,292
不知道。
I don't know.

353
00:31:22,926 --> 00:31:26,093
你记不记得早餐吃得什么？
Do you remember
what you had for breakfast?

354
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:28,757
不知道。
I don't know.

355
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:31,556
你叫苏珊，记得吧？
You are Susan, aren't you?

356
00:31:32,603 --> 00:31:35,272
-苏珊？
-不知道。
- Susan?
- You don't know.

357
00:31:37,316 --> 00:31:39,355
好吧，我们这儿有什么？
All right, what do we have here?

358
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:41,109
没钱吗？
No purse?

359
00:31:41,236 --> 00:31:44,320
你的口袋里是不是有一些东西？
Do you have anything in your pockets,
maybe?

360
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,870
是什么？
Is that it?

361
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,914
哦，现在我们得去某个地方。
Ah! Now we're getting someplace.

362
00:31:58,044 --> 00:31:59,917
这是我的电话号码。
This is my phone number.

363
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:02,003
是吉姆给你的。
Jim must have given it to you.

364
00:32:02,882 --> 00:32:04,922
这好像似曾相识。
This is like a dejavu.

365
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:09,053
你怎么能似曾相识？
你什么都记不起来了。
How can you have a dejavu
if you don't remember anything?

366
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:12,264
不不，我是说，一切都是似曾相识的。
No, no. I mean... this is all dejavu.

367
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,010
这是Port Authority储物柜的钥匙。
This is a Port Authority locker key.

368
00:32:18,147 --> 00:32:21,481
我来告诉你吧，我要带着你赶紧去
Port Authority的储物柜。
I tell you what. I'm gonna
run you up to the Port Authority.

369
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,476
也许储物柜里有什么东西
可以让你想起来什么。
Maybe what's ever in the locker will
help you snap out of it. How's that?

370
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,901
-好的。
-好的。
- OK.
- OK.

371
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,364
走吧。
Let's go.

372
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,078
等一下。
Wait a minute.

373
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:38,827
你不是在哄我玩吧？
This isn't some sort of trick, is it?

374
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:43,170
-你什么意思？
-我是说，我听说过你的一些事。
- What do you mean?
- I mean I know a little bit about you, OK?

375
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:48,752
所以别玩我，因为我心情不好。
So don't even consider jerking me around
because I'm not in a great mood today.

376
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:50,925
行，我是说，我不会…
Sure, I mean, I wouldn't...

377
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:53,093
玩你。
...jerk you around.

378
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,262
我都不认识你。
I don't even know you.

379
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,266
你戴上这个。
You better wear this.

380
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,796
但愿里面是一些好东西。
I hope it's filled with something good.

381
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,932
这是什么
Look at this!

382
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,393
你把它塞得够满的了。
You sure do move around a lot, huh?

383
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:53,568
也许是吧。
Yeah, I guess.

384
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,757
这东西应该是耳环，对吧？
So this stuff does look familiar, right?

385
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:17,043
这完全不可理喻。
Well, it's not completely unfamiliar.

386
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,222
你知道吗，当我闭上眼睛，我看到一个金字塔。
You know, when I close my eyes
I see a pyramid.

387
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,592
一个金字塔？
A pyramid?

388
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,053
像你夹克上的那个？
Like on your jacket?

389
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:32,150
对，就是那个。
Oh, yeah. That must be what it is.

390
00:34:32,277 --> 00:34:35,610
至少你没丢东西。你好点了吗？
At least you got everything.
I hope you're feeling better.

391
00:34:35,738 --> 00:34:37,778
-你是不是好点了？
-是。
- You are feeling better?
- Yeah.

392
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:41,489
很好。那我走了。我得把小摩托换回去。
Good. I gotta go.
I gotta get that scooter back.

393
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:44,536
那么，我哪次再来见你？
So, uh... I'll see you around
maybe sometime, huh?

394
00:34:44,663 --> 00:34:47,368
可能我和吉姆一块来。
Maybe, uh... I'll see you with Jim.

395
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:50,370
好吗？保重，再见。
OK? All right, take care! Bye.

396
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:52,542
拜。
Bye.

397
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:20,656
苏珊。
Susan!

398
00:35:20,782 --> 00:35:23,487
你今晚有地方睡觉吗？
Have you got a place to sleep tonight?

399
00:35:31,542 --> 00:35:33,582
你可以去我那里。
You can sleep at my place.

400
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,750
就一晚上，沙发上。
One night... on the couch.

401
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,919
但是别给我找事。
But I don't want any drama.

402
00:35:38,049 --> 00:35:40,089
也别叫你的狐朋狗友来。
I don't want your friends coming over.

403
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:44,962
也别随便拿走什么东西。
And I want nothing disappearing
from my apartment. You got that?

404
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:54,935
咳嗽
(coughs)

405
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,647
你还是别抽了
Maybe you should quit?

406
00:35:58,861 --> 00:36:00,355
是的。
Maybe.

407
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:10,994
-多谢！
-客气。
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

408
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,540
你，出去。
OK, you. You're outta here.

409
00:36:18,504 --> 00:36:20,544
耽误时间。
It's about time.

410
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,364
怎么回事。
I don't believe it.

411
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,308
抱歉，耽误你了吗？
Sorry, man. Have you been waiting?

412
00:37:24,818 --> 00:37:27,903
-下次没机会了。
-你要明白，这事紧急情况。
- Never ever again!
- Listen, man, it was an emergency.

413
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,735
我明白，没机会了，下回别管我借了。
I understand. Never ever.
Don't ever ask me again.

414
00:37:30,866 --> 00:37:32,906
-好吧。
-不好意思。
- OK.
- Sorry.

415
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:36,492
这边。
This way.

416
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:48,754
-这有人住？
-当然有人住。
- People live here?
- Yes, people live here!

417
00:37:48,884 --> 00:37:52,466
抱歉，只不过我想这里有点不一样。
I just thought it was sort of unusual,
that's all.

418
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:56,302
得上两层。
Two flights up.

419
00:38:02,772 --> 00:38:04,811
抱歉。
Oh! Sorry.

420
00:38:10,738 --> 00:38:13,443
抱歉，借过。
Oh! Sorry, man. Excuse me.

421
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:18,239
他们替我宣扬了这儿有人住。
Those look exactly like my speakers.

422
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,501
嘿嘿，等一等。
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait a minute.

423
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:37,044
你在干什么？给我那个。
What do you think you're doing?
Give me that.

424
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,220
谢谢。
Thank you.

425
00:38:40,933 --> 00:38:43,092
这儿他妈怎么了？
What the hell is goin' on here?

426
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,317
笑声。
(laughter)

427
00:38:56,115 --> 00:38:58,155
不是吧。
I don't believe it.

428
00:39:01,745 --> 00:39:03,822
你要干什么？
(man) What you've gotta do is...

429
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:06,364
不错啊，维多利亚。
(Dez) That's just great, Victoria.

430
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:09,123
迪兹，这是我的东西。
It's my stuff, Dez.

431
00:39:09,253 --> 00:39:11,293
那你就来取了？
So you just come and take it.

432
00:39:11,422 --> 00:39:14,458
没打个电话，也不商量，什么也没有
No phone call, no discussion,
no nothing.

433
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:18,006
-你好吗？
-还行。
- How you doin'?
- I'm fine.

434
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:23,554
这样，我把这些拿到
下面Porsche（德国跑车）上去。
Listen, uh... I'm gonna take
this stuff down to the Porsche.

435
00:39:23,683 --> 00:39:26,175
我敢肯定有些东西是我的。
I believe some of that stuff is mine.

436
00:39:26,312 --> 00:39:29,727
比如应答机，比如Charlie Parker的唱片。
Like the answering machine.
Like the Charlie Parker records.

437
00:39:29,856 --> 00:39:32,727
-行啊，还你。
-谢谢。
- Oh, you can have it. Here.
- Thank you.

438
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:38,896
我会为其他的东西给你一张支票，好吗？
I'll send you a cheque for the rest, OK?

439
00:39:39,032 --> 00:39:41,570
支票？行。
A cheque? Great.

440
00:39:46,748 --> 00:39:48,787
-嗨
-嗨
- Hi.
- Hi.

441
00:39:48,916 --> 00:39:50,956
他是一个好小伙。
He's really a nice guy.

442
00:39:51,085 --> 00:39:53,124
你一定会开心的。
You'll be happy together.

443
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:04,841
-抱歉。
-没事。
- Sorry.
- It's OK.

444
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:06,883
口哨声。
(Dez whistles)

445
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:10,434
其实，你可以打扫一下这地方。
You know...
you could do a lot with this place.

446
00:40:10,563 --> 00:40:12,602
这儿很明亮。
There's a lot of light.

447
00:40:18,111 --> 00:40:20,151
靠。
Ah, shit.

448
00:40:21,448 --> 00:40:23,488
你是凑巧和人吵起来了，对吗？
It happens, right?

449
00:40:24,493 --> 00:40:26,532
应答机。
(answerphone beeps)

450
00:40:26,662 --> 00:40:29,781
嗨，迪兹，是我，吉姆
(answerphone)
Oh, hi, Dez. It's, uh... It's Jim here.

451
00:40:29,914 --> 00:40:32,073
我刚打电话想知道苏珊怎么样了。
I'm just calling to see if Susan's OK.

452
00:40:32,209 --> 00:40:35,909
我在…妈的，我这儿是在哪里。
I'm calling from, uh...
Oh, shit, I don't know where we are.

453
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:38,750
只知道是汽车旅馆，嘿，这地方叫什么？
It's some motel... Hey, where are we?

454
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:42,131
管他啦，这样吧，我明天打给你。
Anyway, no, look...
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

455
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,253
多谢你了。
And thanks again for everything.

456
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:46,794
真够哥们，谢谢，拜。
You're a pal. Thanks a lot. OK, bye.

457
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:50,597
看来电话铃还要响几次。
That's gotta ring some bells.

458
00:40:51,394 --> 00:40:54,727
-老实说，不是凑巧。
-不是？
- Honestly, no.
- No?

459
00:40:54,855 --> 00:40:56,895
那糟了。
Terrific.

460
00:40:57,024 --> 00:41:00,025
-我要喝一杯，你要点什么？
-都行。
- I need a drink. Do you want something?
- All right.

461
00:41:00,152 --> 00:41:03,106
你有的，什么都行，苹果汁，可乐，梨子酒
Whatever you're having.
Apple juice. Coke. Perrier.

462
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:05,278
Miller还是Heineken（都是啤酒品牌）
Miller or a Heineken?

463
00:41:05,407 --> 00:41:07,863
-都行。
-到底哪一个？
- All right.
- Which?

464
00:41:07,993 --> 00:41:09,653
第一个。
Either one.

465
00:41:09,786 --> 00:41:11,364
谢谢。
Please.

466
00:41:13,998 --> 00:41:16,038
口哨
(Dez whistles)

467
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:23,288
搞错了吧！
(Dez) I don't believe it!

468
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,474
她把冰箱拿走了。
She took the refrigerator.

469
00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:43,269
-警察怎么说？
-这种情况大多数在24小时内就能找到。
- What did the police say?
- Most of these cases turn up in 24 hours.

470
00:41:43,402 --> 00:41:47,020
你告诉他们那夹克的事了吗？
还有她的结婚戒指在皂盒上？
Did you tell them about the jacket?
Her wedding ring in the soap dish?

471
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:48,983
我说了！
I told them!

472
00:41:49,825 --> 00:41:52,660
他们怀疑她只是有什么事。
They seem to think she's having an affair.

473
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:55,455
哦，天啊，也许就是有事。
Oh, my God, maybe she is!

474
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:58,498
真是荒唐，罗伯塔哪来的事！
It's ridiculous.
Roberta is not having an affair!

475
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:02,208
-她太冷淡了。
-亏你说得出来
- She's much too uptight.
- That is a horrible thing to say.

476
00:42:02,337 --> 00:42:06,418
我看你对和Becky Shuman偷情还挺得意的。
I suppose you're proud of the way you're
running around with Becky Shuman.

477
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:10,001
我不知道你在说什么，
总之，我们没偷情。
I didn't know you knew.
Anyway, we're not running around!

478
00:42:10,136 --> 00:42:13,340
现在不是说闲话的时候！
We're having
a perfectly respectable affair!

479
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:15,845
-加里，让我问你点事。
-什么？
- Gary, let me ask you something.
- What?

480
00:42:15,975 --> 00:42:20,471
罗伯塔有性高潮吗？我是说，和你做的时候。
Does Roberta have orgasms?
I mean, did she have them with you?

481
00:42:21,564 --> 00:42:24,351
-高潮？
-你心里明白，对吧？
- Orgasms?
- You have heard of them, haven't you?

482
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:27,520
也许因为你不能给她满足她才走了。
Maybe she left you
because you weren't satisfying her.

483
00:42:27,653 --> 00:42:31,105
莱斯莉，没人会痴迷于什么性高潮！
Leslie!
Not everybody is obsessed with orgasms!

484
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,696
-只是有些人…才有的。
-那么她呢？
- Some people just... have them.
- Did she?

485
00:42:33,826 --> 00:42:37,870
-你和Phil Donshue谈论性高潮吗？
-你个蠢货！
- Did Phil Donahue discuss orgasms?!
- You are really a pig!

486
00:42:37,997 --> 00:42:41,163
-至少我体验过。
-体验过。我也有！
- At least I know about feelings.
- Feelings. I feel! I feel!

487
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:45,241
你真恶心，跟你爸一样。怪不得罗伯塔离开你。
You're disgusting. You're just like Daddy!
No wonder Roberta left you.

488
00:42:45,379 --> 00:42:47,419
你说够了吗！
Would you stop saying that!

489
00:42:47,548 --> 00:42:49,587
-加里
-赖瑞
- Gary...
- Larry!

490
00:42:49,716 --> 00:42:52,385
看着不错。有罗伯塔的消息吗？
That looks great.
Any word from Roberta yet?

491
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,219
这么快就搞上了，莱斯莉。
Fast work, Les.

492
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,386
哦，这里还有一些鸡肉。
Oh, let's have some chicken.

493
00:42:56,515 --> 00:42:58,554
赖瑞，那是明天吃的。
The chicken is for tomorrow. Larry!

494
00:42:58,683 --> 00:43:00,593
警察怎么说？
What did the police say?

495
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:03,396
出了这么大的事你们还吃东西！
I can't believe
you're eating during a crisis!

496
00:43:03,522 --> 00:43:04,932
我们够紧张的了，你还要怎么样？
We're nervous!

497
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,852
那你们应该像个正常人那样去打镇定剂！
Then take a Valium like a normal person!

498
00:43:13,072 --> 00:43:15,112
她有一口好牙。
She has great teeth.

499
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:19,242
这就是我为什么出现在巴特利公园
(Dez)
That's why I showed up at Battery Park.

500
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:24,582
吉姆说你的一个朋友摔死在
大西洋城的旅馆外边。
Jim said a friend of yours got killed
outside your hotel in Atlantic City.

501
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,748
他担心坏了。
He was pretty worried.

502
00:43:26,877 --> 00:43:28,917
摔了？
Killed?

503
00:43:29,046 --> 00:43:30,920
杀死了？
Dead?

504
00:43:31,048 --> 00:43:34,631
这也是你的兴趣之一，是吗，苏珊？
Sort of goes with the territory,
doesn't it, Susan?

505
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:39,136
也许我知道是谁干的。
Maybe I know who did it.

506
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:42,847
我希望我能想起来。
I wish I could remember.

507
00:43:45,062 --> 00:43:47,101
也许就是你杀的。
Maybe you were the killer.

508
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,979
不可能。
No! (laughs)

509
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:58,276
我想我要躺一会儿
I should probably lay low for while, huh?

510
00:43:58,867 --> 00:44:00,906
好主意。
It might be a wise idea.

511
00:44:02,704 --> 00:44:05,658
你不知道在码头的那个人是谁？
You don't know
who the guy at the quay was?

512
00:44:08,209 --> 00:44:10,248
也许是被你抛弃的情人
Maybe a jilted lover?

513
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:16,005
肯定不是。
I don't think so.

514
00:44:18,845 --> 00:44:20,884
也有可能。
Maybe he was.

515
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:23,887
你可知道
You know somethin'?

516
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:26,637
你不完全是我所想的那样。
You are not at all what I expected.

517
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:30,725
你也不全是我想的那样。
You're not quite what I expected either.

518
00:44:32,774 --> 00:44:34,814
萨克斯
(sax ophone)

519
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:55,205
我怎么认识的吉姆？我是说…
Just how did I meet Jim? I mean, how...

520
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:58,003
我怎么遇到他的？
How did I meet him?

521
00:44:58,133 --> 00:45:00,171
也许这个有帮助。
Maybe it would help.

522
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,757
我想是在那个咖啡店里。
I think it was at some coffee shop.

523
00:45:04,055 --> 00:45:06,094
那是你工作的第一天，
It was your first day at work.

524
00:45:06,223 --> 00:45:08,263
吉姆大摇大摆的进来。
Jim waltzed in.

525
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:11,477
你给他带来吃的，然后把帐单撕了。
You brought his food over
and you ripped up the check.

526
00:45:13,189 --> 00:45:16,474
他个高吗？我说的是吉姆。
Is he tall? I mean Jim.

527
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:19,726
中等个头吧。
He's about medium.

528
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:23,278
哪种身材？
Is he sort of thin?

529
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,739
哪种，哪种，呃…
Sort of. Sort of, um...

530
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:29,653
跟我差不多。
...my build.

531
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,456
眼睛是什么颜色的？
What colour eyes does he have?

532
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,581
蓝的。
Blue.

533
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:43,756
跟你一样？
Like yours?

534
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:52,634
抱歉，抱歉。
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

535
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:54,808
抱歉。
(Roberta whispers) Sorry.

536
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:58,894
我不知道怎么回事，只是…
I don't know what happened. I just...

537
00:45:59,692 --> 00:46:01,186
不好意思。
Sorry.

538
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:07,820
雷声
(thunder rumbles)

539
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:09,339
哼哼
(groans)

540
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,307
过来。
Come on.

541
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:43,580
迪兹
(whispers) Dez!

542
00:47:44,419 --> 00:47:46,457
迪兹
Dez...

543
00:47:51,968 --> 00:47:54,007
和我一起吃早餐吗？
Wanna go out to breakfast with me?

544
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:57,010
早餐
Breakfast?

545
00:47:59,225 --> 00:48:02,142
你怎么了？穿的有点恶心。
What have you got on?
Some sort of disguise?

546
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:05,519
-你不喜欢？
-不，只是，呃…
- You don't like it?
- No, it's, uh...

547
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:08,434
还是迷人的。
...sort of charming.

548
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:11,519
我请客。
It's my treat.

549
00:48:12,696 --> 00:48:14,735
你要干嘛？抢银行？
What did you do? Rob a bank?

550
00:48:14,864 --> 00:48:17,782
我不知道，也许吧。
I don't know. Maybe.

551
00:48:19,536 --> 00:48:21,410
你要到哪里去？
Where do you wanna go?

552
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:23,779
看，我在手提箱找到这个。
See, I found this in the suitcase.

553
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,415
Gunny的咖啡店？我知道这地方。
Gunny's Coffee Shop? I know the place.

554
00:48:27,543 --> 00:48:29,583
它在中央大街附近。
It's over on Center Street.

555
00:48:29,712 --> 00:48:32,499
也许我就是在那儿遇见吉姆的。
Maybe that's the place where I met Jim.

556
00:48:33,091 --> 00:48:34,419
-然后？
-然后…
- So?
- So...

557
00:48:34,551 --> 00:48:38,963
然后我们就去那里
看看是否有人认识我。
So we go there
and see if anybody remembers me.

558
00:48:39,097 --> 00:48:42,346
看得怎么样，有熟悉的吗？
So what do you think?
Anyone look familiar?

559
00:48:43,809 --> 00:48:46,051
还没有。
No. Not yet.

560
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,655
我在手提箱里找到这个，你听说过吗？
I found this in the suitcase.
You ever hear of it?

561
00:48:57,781 --> 00:49:01,315
魔术俱乐部？是的，在百老汇附近。
The Magic Club? Yeah.
That's that place over on Broadway.

562
00:49:01,451 --> 00:49:02,779
怎么了？
Why?

563
00:49:02,911 --> 00:49:05,616
我想我应该去那，看看有没有熟人。
I thought I'd go there
and see if I remember anyone.

564
00:49:05,747 --> 00:49:08,452
-你知道你要点什么吗？
-当然。
- You know what you're having?
- Sure.

565
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,623
你要点什么？
What are you having?

566
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,792
嗯，是你请客，对吧？
Well, it's your treat, right?

567
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:14,913
是的，我付账。
(giggles) Yeah, I got money.

568
00:49:15,048 --> 00:49:17,124
我要点…蓝莓点心。
I'm gonna have... blueberry blintzes.

569
00:49:17,259 --> 00:49:19,297
很好，我也要那个。
I'll have that too. That sounds good.

570
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:21,467
你要点什么？
What can I get you?

571
00:49:21,596 --> 00:49:23,968
呃，一杯咖啡。
Yes, I would like a... coffee...

572
00:49:24,724 --> 00:49:27,096
还有…甜圈饼
...and a, uh... doughnut.

573
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:31,473
小姐，如果你有空了，就给我们上吃的吧。
Miss! When you get a chance,
could you take our order?

574
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:33,563
给你可以，她可不行。
You can stay. She's gotta go.

575
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,229
Mick，那个穿夹克的疯子女孩来了。
Mick, it's that crazy girl with the jacket.

576
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,399
-你，滚！
-你认识我？
- You, out!
- You know me?!

577
00:49:38,529 --> 00:49:40,652
对，别想在这儿吃霸王餐。
Yeah. You won't get a free meal here.

578
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:44,150
-我有钱，我可以付款。
-我不要你的钱，滚出去。
- I got money, I can pay.
- I don't want your money. Get out.

579
00:49:44,284 --> 00:49:46,989
-我们有钱，怎么了？
-想想你自己的事吧。
- We got money. What is it?
- Mind your own business.

580
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:49,872
-这就是我的事，等一下。
-过来，出去。
- This is my business, wait a minute!
- Come on, out!

581
00:49:49,998 --> 00:49:52,702
-嘿，我和他一起的。
-出去，出去。
- Hey, I'm with her.
- Come on, come on.

582
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,583
你幸运去吧，我没向你逼帐！
You're lucky I don't press charges!

583
00:49:56,713 --> 00:49:58,338
迪兹。
Dez.

584
00:49:58,465 --> 00:50:01,038
你怎么样，还好吧？太对不起了。
Are you OK? Are you all right? I'm sorry!

585
00:50:01,176 --> 00:50:03,251
我说的第一条规则就是别给我找事。
Rule number one was no drama.

586
00:50:03,386 --> 00:50:06,553
-记得吗？
-是的，我知道，抱歉。
- Remember?
- Yes. I know. I'm sorry.

587
00:50:08,057 --> 00:50:09,849
我们走吧。
Let's get out of here.

588
00:50:09,976 --> 00:50:11,554
不好意思。
I'm sorry.

589
00:50:25,741 --> 00:50:27,818
争吵声
(man and woman arguing)

590
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:30,987
你从来不让我戴眼镜。
(woman)
You won't even let me wear my glasses!

591
00:50:31,121 --> 00:50:34,537
回去卖T去吧，你被解雇了！
(man) Go back to selling T-shirts!
You're fired!

592
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,833
不对，你错了，蓝，是我辞职不干了。
(shouts) No, you don't, lan, because I quit!

593
00:50:39,963 --> 00:50:42,502
嘿，别在梯子下面！
(Susan) Hey! Not under the ladder!

594
00:50:45,093 --> 00:50:49,221
我的命运绝不可能比这儿更糟糕的了。
败类人渣！
My luck can't get much worse anyway.
Miserable scumbags!

595
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:52,429
也许我应该在床上教训他。
Maybe I should've slept with him.

596
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,346
姐们，有个巫婆偷了我的衣服…
Man, some witch steals my clothes,...

597
00:50:55,479 --> 00:50:59,725
…米克尔被人从旅店窗户扔了出去，
现在你又被炒了。
...Meeker gets pushed out a hotel window
and now you get fired.

598
00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:04,151
不太糟，但是坏运气好像抓着你不放。
No offence, but bad luck really seems
to be following you around.

599
00:51:06,823 --> 00:51:10,156
我们现在都清闲了，一起去看个电影吧。
We're both free now.
Let's just go to the movies.

600
00:51:10,285 --> 00:51:12,323
两场连映的？
A double feature?

601
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,493
来吧。
Come on!

602
00:51:16,498 --> 00:51:19,251
如果你请我吃爆米花的话，电影票就我买了。
I'll pay for the movie
if you pay for the popcorn.

603
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:20,954
可以，但是，爆米花多少钱？
OK, but listen. How much is popcorn?

604
00:51:21,086 --> 00:51:23,126
-2.50
-行。
- 2.50
- OK.

605
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:27,255
笑
(giggling)

606
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,264
就是这地方。
This must be the place.

607
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,311
司机，靠边停吧，就是这儿。
Sir, could you pull over, please?
This is it.

608
00:51:41,856 --> 00:51:43,896
真是不好意思。
I'm sorry about what happened.

609
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:47,148
-你没有生气吧？
-没。
- Are you sure you're not angry?
- Yeah.

610
00:51:47,987 --> 00:51:50,027
-真的。
-我没生气。
- Really?
- I'm not angry.

611
00:51:50,823 --> 00:51:52,863
你真够哥们。
OK. You're a real pal.

612
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:56,324
我会告诉吉姆的。
I'll tell Jim.

613
00:51:57,121 --> 00:51:59,031
-拜
-拜
- Bye!
- Bye.

614
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,294
够哥们，我会告诉吉姆…
A real pal. I'll tell Jim...

615
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:13,168
布利克大街电影院
Bleecker Street Cinema.

616
00:52:23,313 --> 00:52:25,768
你只是别再这样开除谁！
(man)
You just don't fire someone like that!

617
00:52:25,899 --> 00:52:27,975
我上哪里去找这么文静的女孩去？
Who am I gonna find
at such short notice?

618
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:30,149
拜托，你认识那么多女孩。
Come on, Ray. You know lots of girls.

619
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:34,193
-很多女人都在找工作。
-妈，别打扰我。
- (woman) Plenty of women need work.
- (Ray) Ma! Let me take care of this.

620
00:52:34,324 --> 00:52:35,403
你好。

00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:37,407
你看见外边的招工告示了？
You saw the sign outside?

622
00:52:37,535 --> 00:52:39,444
你是在找工作？
Are you looking for a job?

623
00:52:41,248 --> 00:52:43,323
是的，我想我是。
Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.

624
00:52:43,457 --> 00:52:45,616
-她还在想她在找工作。
-不。
- She thinks she's looking for a job.
- No!

625
00:52:45,752 --> 00:52:48,373
我是在找工作，是什么工作？
I am, I am! What kind of job?

626
00:52:48,504 --> 00:52:50,627
进来吧。

00:52:59,598 --> 00:53:01,638
还有我，蓝。
And I'm lan.

634
00:53:16,699 --> 00:53:18,737
加里先生，你还好吗？

还行，谢谢你。晚安，Daisy。

638
00:53:25,415 --> 00:53:27,407
你拿这个包去哪？
Where did you get this bag?

639
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:29,582
它是我的，加里夫人把它给我了。
It's mine. Mrs Glass give it to me.

640
00:53:29,711 --> 00:53:31,750
把包给我，Daisy。

641
00:53:32,547 --> 00:53:35,797
-Daisy，把包给我。
-对不起，这包是我的。
- Daisy, give me the bag!
- Sorry, you ain't getting this bag.

642
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:39,091
-请你给我，我要好好的问问你。

644
00:53:51,607 --> 00:53:55,854
嘿，我说，你们能挪个地方吃东西吗？
Hey, guys. Could you, uh...
have your picnic somewhere else?

645
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:06,075
嘿，你们这些人！
Hey, guys!

646
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,123
好吧，
Right...

647
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:11,704
小心轻放，行吧？
Just try to be careful, all right?

648
00:54:15,046 --> 00:54:18,297
听着，我不想卷入家庭纠纷，好吗。
Listen, I don't get involved
in domestic disputes, OK?

649
00:54:18,425 --> 00:54:20,251
不是纠纷。
There's no dispute.

650
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,710
在她没有失踪前时，她穿着一件夹克。
She had the jacket on
when she disappeared.

651
00:54:22,846 --> 00:54:25,882
某种原因上讲，这对她很不一样。
It was very special to her
for some reason.

652
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:28,091
你真的记不起来她了？
Don't you even remember her?

653
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:30,266
你也记不起来夹克了？
Don't you remember the jacket?

黑色的，上面还有一个金色的像金字塔的图形
It was black and gold and it had
a sort of a pyramid thing on it...

655
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:36,934
就像钞票上的那样。
...like on a dollar bill.

记不清了。
Vaguely.

658
00:54:42,531 --> 00:54:44,607
等等，等等。
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

659
00:54:45,367 --> 00:54:48,368
她也来过这儿找夹克。
She stopped in here
looking for the jacket, too.

660
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,535
也许你们能互相帮助。

662
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,873
苏珊，接一下电话。

663
00:54:55,002 --> 00:54:56,911
电话铃

00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,121

00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,951
加里・格兰斯？
Gary Glass?

672
00:55:34,457 --> 00:55:36,497
嗯，嗯。
uh-huh.

673
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:40,125
哦，你就是巫婆的丈夫，我的东西呢？
Oh, so you're the witch's husband.
Where's my stuff?

674
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,415
嗯。
Yeah.

嗯。也许我能帮你。
Well, maybe I could help you.

677
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:53,672

00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:57,426
我在柜台边的第三个座位等你，听明白了？
I'll be waiting on the third floor
near the bar. You got that?

679
00:55:57,562 --> 00:56:00,018
好的，再见。
All right, I'll see you there.

681
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,319
晚上好，先生们女士们。
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

682
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:12,030

684
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,738
你，先生，就是穿红色衬衫的…
You, sir, the man in the red shirt...

685
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:22,366
-你从哪来？

- Where you from?
- (man) I'm from Brooklyn!

686
00:56:22,503 --> 00:56:24,745
我们当中还有谁是从布兰克林来的吗？
Do we have anyone else here
from Brooklyn?

687
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,252
好的。为什么你们两个不在一个酒吧间里？
Right here.
Why don't you two share a cab home?

688
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,669
-笑
-真是好观众。
- (man laughs)
- This is a great audience.

689

从现在开始，我要你
在我们开始前在这儿呆五分钟。
From now on, I want you here
five minutes before we begin.

693
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:46,734
记住，我们从鸽子开始。你看起来很漂亮，要微笑。
Remember, we start with the doves.
You look beautiful. Smile.

694
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,778
Davina，今夜女王。
Davina... Queen of the Night!

695
00:56:49,905 --> 00:56:52,859
所以，你们这些可爱的人们，
让我们欢呼吧，来吧！

00:57:02,208 --> 00:57:04,248

704
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:30,104
又长又薄哦，老顾客，就不用我说了…
Extra-ultra long and thin!
Regular, unleaded...

谢幕。
Bow!

712
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:02,152
这一个比那一个还差！
This one's worse than the other one!

713
00:59:04,118 --> 00:59:06,157
值得鼓励，孩子。
Nice try, kid.

714
00:59:06,287 --> 00:59:08,956
给你的，20美元。
Here you go. 20 bucks.

715
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:11,240
明晚还是这个时间过来。
See you tomorrow night
at the same time.

716
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:13,747
-你雇佣我了？
-当然雇佣你了。
- You're hiring me?
- Well, of course we are!

717
00:59:13,878 --> 00:59:14,957
谢谢。
Thank you!

718
00:59:15,087 --> 00:59:18,207
把这些拿回家好好练习，好吗？
Take these guys home and practise,

719
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,124
还有，苏珊，多多练习，好吗？
And, Susan... practise a lot! OK?

《入轨》
麦当娜 唱
[歌词不译]
(# "Into The Groove" by Madonna)

722
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:47,322
# Get into the groove

723
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:49,029
# Boy, you've got to prove

724
00:59:49,162 --> 00:59:53,539
# Your love to me, yeah

725
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:55,326
# Get up on your feet

726
00:59:55,459 --> 00:59:57,368
# Yeah, step to the beat

727
00:59:57,503 --> 01:00:00,837
# Boy, what will it be?

728
01:00:01,548 --> 01:00:05,249
# Music can be such a revelation

729
01:00:05,428 --> 01:00:06,590
# Dancing around

730
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:09,887
# You feel the sweet sensation

731
01:00:10,016 --> 01:00:13,715
# We might be lovers
if the rhythm's right

732
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:18,057
# I hope this feeling never ends tonight

733
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:22,353
# Only when I'm dancing
can I feel this free

734
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,567
# At night I lock the doors
where no one else can see

735
01:00:26,698 --> 01:00:30,316
# I'm tired of dancing here all by myself

736
01:00:30,868 --> 01:00:34,783
# Tonight I wanna dance
with someone else

737
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:36,825
# Get into the groove

738
01:00:36,958 --> 01:00:38,997
# Boy, you've got to prove

739
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:43,255
# Your love to me, yeah

740
01:00:43,381 --> 01:00:45,290
# Get up on your feet

741
01:00:45,424 --> 01:00:47,381
# Yeah, step to the beat

742
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,594
# Boy, what will it be?

743
01:00:50,721 --> 01:00:53,639
# Gonna get to know you
in a special way...

744
01:00:53,766 --> 01:00:55,758
加里，格兰斯，是吧？
Gary Glass, right?

745
01:00:55,892 --> 01:00:57,802
是，你怎么知道？
Yeah, how did you know?

746
01:00:57,937 --> 01:00:59,976
一猜便知。
Wild guess.

747
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:05,231
-她离你而去，啊？
-是，两天前。
- She split on you, huh?
- Yeah. Two days ago.

748
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,399
她之前离开过你吗？
Has she ever split on you before?

749
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:09,356
没，当然没有。
No, of course not.

750
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:12,615
-她嗑药吗？
-嗑药？罗伯塔？
- Did she do drugs?
- Drugs? Roberta?

751
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:15,657
她从小连大麻烟都没吸过。
She's never smoked a joint
in her whole life.

752
01:01:15,787 --> 01:01:19,535
她可能是李堡（纽泽西）最规矩的人。
She's probably
the straightest person in Fort Lee.

753
01:01:19,666 --> 01:01:21,706
你是什么意思？
What are you driving at?

754
01:01:22,585 --> 01:01:26,286
-你要喝点什么？
-呃，不，谢谢了。
- Do you want something to drink?
- um... No, thanks.

755
01:01:26,423 --> 01:01:30,290
我在计划健身，不喝酒，不吃甜的。
I'm on this health programme, you know?
No alcohol, no sugar...

756
01:01:30,426 --> 01:01:32,502
-你要跳舞吗？
-跳舞？
- Do you wanna dance?
- Dance?

757
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:41,762
借过，借过。
Excuse me. Excuse me.

758
01:01:41,896 --> 01:01:44,220
# Live out your fantasy

759
01:01:44,356 --> 01:01:46,265
# Here with me

760
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,769
- # Just let the music set you free
- (Gary coughs)

761
01:01:49,904 --> 01:01:53,237
你看了报纸上关于一个叫米克尔的家伙的事了么？
Did you read that stuff in the newspaper
about that guy Meeker?

762
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:56,116
他在大西洋城被人从旅店窗户上推了下去。
He got pushed out of a hotel window
in Atlantic City.

763
01:01:56,243 --> 01:01:59,030
-没有，为什么？
-罗伯塔参加了这次谋杀。
- No, why?
- Roberta's mixed up in it.

764
01:01:59,162 --> 01:02:01,202
罗伯塔？怎么可能！
Roberta? That's impossible!

765
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:04,949
真的。她为米克尔的谋杀而圈定了我。
Fact. She's trying to frame me
for Meeker's murder.

766
01:02:05,084 --> 01:02:07,124
谁是米克尔？
Who's Meeker?

767
01:02:09,505 --> 01:02:12,257
是谁？而且他和罗伯塔到底想干什么？
Who's Meeker and what does
he have to do with Roberta?

768
01:02:12,383 --> 01:02:15,799
米克尔死前的同伙和罗伯塔，
两个人一起干的。
Ex-partner and Roberta
were in on it together.

769
01:02:15,929 --> 01:02:17,968
我想你弄错了，
I-I think you're mistaken.

770
01:02:18,097 --> 01:02:21,632
罗伯塔在大西洋城不认识什么人。
Roberta doesn't know anybody
in Atlantic City.

771
01:02:21,768 --> 01:02:23,808
我看见他们在一起了。
I've seen them together!

772
01:02:23,936 --> 01:02:27,436
你看了罗伯塔和别的男人在一起了？谁？
You saw Roberta with another man! Who?

773
01:02:28,149 --> 01:02:30,687
在我来看就像是个油球。
Looks like a real greaseball to me.

774
01:02:32,195 --> 01:02:34,233
你说的我都不信。
I don't believe a word you're saying.

775
01:02:34,363 --> 01:02:36,771
相信我，你想找到你妻子吗？
Here, trust me. You wanna find your wife?

776
01:02:36,908 --> 01:02:40,240
-使得，当然我要！
-很好，带我去你家。
- Yeah, of course I do!
- Good. Let's go to your place.

777
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:42,409
我家？
My place?

778
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:44,870
借过。
Excuse me.

779
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:48,664
# Now I know you're mine

780
01:04:30,976 --> 01:04:32,470
打扰。
Excuse me!

781
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:34,844
先生。
Sir!

782
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:37,019
有人跟踪我。
There's someone following me.

783
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:39,814
求你了，你能…
Please! Could you... Could you...

784
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:42,398
有个男人，有个男人跟踪我…
There's a man...
There's a man following me...

785
01:04:42,529 --> 01:04:45,565
你是怎么进来的？你不能到这里来。
How do you get in here?
You're not supposed to be in here.

786
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:49,032
我知道，对不起，先生，能帮我看一看他走了吗？
I know. I'm sorry, sir,
but could you please see if he's gone?

787
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:52,161
有个男人跟踪我，你可以看看他走了吗？
There's a man following me.
Could you see if he's gone?

788
01:04:52,288 --> 01:04:54,328
-可以。
-谢谢。
- OK.
- Thank you.

789
01:04:56,376 --> 01:04:58,415
你呆在这里。
You stay here.

790
01:04:58,544 --> 01:05:01,213
Enrique会小心处理的。
Enrique will take care of it.

791
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:05,632
不错！
no mal!

792
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:07,799
不错。
Yeah.

793
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:13,221
电视声
(singing on TV)

794
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:16,303
# He's hot!

795
01:05:20,273 --> 01:05:21,603
# Your body's hot

796
01:05:21,733 --> 01:05:24,687
# You're always hot, all the time, hot...

797
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:30,360
# Oh, I'm so hot, oh!

798
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,659
# So hot!

799
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:36,953
嗨，我是加里的绿洲的加里。
（西班牙语）Soy Gary de Gary's Oasis.

01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:38,956
在我们纽泽西的样品库里，

802
01:05:42,294 --> 01:05:44,252
快来加里的绿洲吧，
As?que venga a Gary's Oasis,...

803
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,420

- Hola, Gary!
- No, muchachas. No!

805
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:54,337
在加里的绿洲，你会美梦成真。
At Gary's Oasis
all your fantasies can come true!

806
01:05:54,891 --> 01:05:56,930
升降声
(lift moves)

807
01:05:57,685 --> 01:05:59,725
先生？
Sir?

808
01:06:01,897 --> 01:06:03,937
先生！
Sir!

809
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,186
升降机接近声
(lift approaches)

810
01:06:18,831 --> 01:06:21,037
出租车！出租车！
(screeches) Taxi! Taxi!

811
01:06:22,876 --> 01:06:24,915
出租车！
Taxi!

812
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:35,801
喘息声
(gasps)

813
01:06:43,312 --> 01:06:44,557
尖叫声
(screams)

814
01:06:45,398 --> 01:06:48,482
-你自己送上门来了。
-等等，我给钱！
- You'll get yourself in a twist.
- Wait! I have money!

815
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:51,100
我的钱在我的包里！
I have money in my bag!
I have money in my bag!

816
01:06:51,237 --> 01:06:54,274
耳环，我要耳环。
OK. The earrings, I need them.

817
01:06:54,406 --> 01:06:57,573
什么耳环？求求你，你搞错人了。
What earrings?
Look, I'm not who you think. Please.

818
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:01,534
好了，好了，别重蹈你已故的小情人的覆辙。
All right, all right, avoid the fate
of your late beloved boyfriend.

819
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:03,703
警笛声
(police siren)

820
01:07:12,883 --> 01:07:14,922
鸽子声
(doves coo)

821
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:20,969
他是拉皮条的？
Was he your pimp?

822
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:23,139
什么？
What?

823
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:25,307
好的，这样来吧。
All right, play it that way.

824
01:07:25,436 --> 01:07:29,564
起来吧，你只是头撞了一小下，
你还活着呢。
Come on, you've just got a little bump
on your head. You'll survive it.

825
01:07:35,905 --> 01:07:37,945
你叫什么？
What's your name?

826
01:07:38,074 --> 01:07:40,113
你不叫无名氏，对吧？
You got a name, don't you?

827
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:43,492
好吧，到派出所再问她名字。
All right, we'll settle this
at the station house.

828
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:47,448
-罗伯塔。
-罗伯塔，是个名字。
- Roberta.
- Roberta. That's a name.

829
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,623
你们搞错了。
I'm not who you think I am.

830
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:57,464
这些鸟你怎么用？
How do you use the birds?

831
01:08:12,273 --> 01:08:14,313
你有个好房子，加里。
Nice place you got here, Gar.

832
01:08:14,442 --> 01:08:16,482
我们都喜欢。
We like it.

833
01:08:20,699 --> 01:08:21,979
挺结实。
Firm.

834
01:08:22,117 --> 01:08:24,155
嗯，是。
Y-Yeah.

835
01:08:27,622 --> 01:08:29,662
那是罗伯塔的。
They're Roberta's.

这些也是罗伯塔的？
Are these Roberta's, too?

840
01:08:43,094 --> 01:08:45,420
我不知道她在读这些。
I didn't know she read this stuff.

841
01:08:45,556 --> 01:08:47,595
你知道吗，加里，在你我之间，
You know, Gar, between you and me,...

842
01:08:47,724 --> 01:08:50,678
你真的了解罗伯塔什么？
...what do you really know about Roberta?

843
01:08:51,103 --> 01:08:53,143
漂亮的墙纸。
Nice wallpaper.

844
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:12,699
在你翻她的衣服之前，
Don't you think
you ought to wait for Roberta...

845
01:09:12,832 --> 01:09:14,908
你不觉得你应该等罗伯塔回来吗？
...before you start taking her clothes?

846
01:09:15,043 --> 01:09:17,082
她欠我一件外套。
She owes me a coat.

847
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:29,755
-她体重多少？
-罗伯塔？
- What does she weigh?
- Roberta?

848
01:09:29,891 --> 01:09:31,883
105, 110.

849
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:34,508
我们差不多，非常接近。
We're close. Very close.

850
01:09:36,855 --> 01:09:40,390
-漂亮的浴缸。
-你喜欢？
- Nice tub.
- You like it?

851
01:09:40,525 --> 01:09:43,977
那是，呃，这是我们众多受大众喜爱的款项之一。
That's, uh...
It's one of our most popular items.

852
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:48,988
你可以安装在所有的浴室里，
而且会为您的房子增价。
You can install it in any bathroom and it
increases the resale value of your home.

853
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,074
我没说我要买一个。
I didn't say I wanted to buy one.

854
01:09:51,202 --> 01:09:53,242
是啊，不好意思。
Right. Sorry.

855
01:09:55,415 --> 01:09:58,748
你要知道，我可以习惯这样的地方。
You know, I could get used
to a place like this.

856
01:09:58,918 --> 01:10:00,746
来点大麻？
Got any pot?

857
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:03,830
大，大麻，呃…
P-pot. um...

858
01:10:03,964 --> 01:10:06,123
平常我可以弄一些，
usually I keep some around,...

859
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:08,750
但是，现，现在，我要出去。
...but r-right now I'm out.

860
01:10:08,886 --> 01:10:10,926
你应该明白。
You know how it is.

861
01:10:12,181 --> 01:10:14,506
来一根火柴呢？
How about a match?

862
01:10:14,642 --> 01:10:16,682
好，停。
(man) All right, stop.

863
01:10:17,186 --> 01:10:18,929
脸向前。
Face forward.

864
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:20,972
笑一笑。
Smile.

865
01:10:21,107 --> 01:10:23,146
左转
Turn left.

866
01:10:24,151 --> 01:10:26,190
下一个。
Next.

867
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,478
然后你开始想…
And then you start to think,...

868
01:10:28,614 --> 01:10:30,653
这都算什么呢？
...what's it all about?

869
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:34,323
一张大照片。你明白吗？
The big picture, you know what I mean?

870
01:10:34,995 --> 01:10:37,034
我明白，加里。
Sure I do, Gar.

871
01:10:37,164 --> 01:10:39,203
我是说，那…
I mean, there...

872
01:10:39,332 --> 01:10:41,954
那有比赚钱更好的生活乐趣，对吗？
There's more to life
than making money, right?

873
01:10:42,086 --> 01:10:44,042
我的意思是，我知道那个，我是说…
I mean, I know that. I mean...

874
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:46,210
哦，仫。
Oh... Mm.

875
01:10:50,635 --> 01:10:52,793
你知道……
You know... You know how...

876
01:10:52,929 --> 01:10:56,345
这一切是如何来源于
在大学时的一个单纯的想法？
...all time comes from
a single point in the universe?

877
01:10:57,558 --> 01:10:59,635
-你明白我说的吗？
-不。
- You know what I mean?
- No.

878
01:11:09,069 --> 01:11:11,109
我丈夫。
My husband.

879
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,565
我们住在李堡。
We live in Fort Lee.

880
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,823
-电话声。
-那些事情…
- (phone rings)
- There are...

881
01:11:16,952 --> 01:11:21,661
…发生在太阳系很远的地方…
...things happening in solar systems
so far away...

882
01:11:21,791 --> 01:11:23,949
…我们根本看不见它们。
...that we can't even see them.

883
01:11:25,753 --> 01:11:27,791
笑
(giggling)

884
01:11:28,505 --> 01:11:30,746
我是说，它们…它们在乎什么？
I mean, what do... what do they care?

885
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:33,717
它们在乎什么，即使我是纽泽西的矿泉浴巨擘？
What do they care
if I am the spa king of New Jersey?

886
01:11:33,843 --> 01:11:35,967
喂，加里的家。
Hello. Glass house.

887
01:11:36,096 --> 01:11:37,970
笑
(Gary giggles)

888
01:11:38,097 --> 01:11:40,137
喂？
(Susan) Hello?

889
01:11:40,851 --> 01:11:43,057
-喂？
-纽泽西矿泉浴的大王。
- Hello?
- Spa king of New Jersey!

890
01:11:43,186 --> 01:11:44,894
笑
(Gary giggles)

891
01:11:45,021 --> 01:11:47,144
矿泉浴大王。
Spa king!

892
01:11:51,235 --> 01:11:53,774
我可以再打给别的人吗？求你了。
Could I call someone else? Please?

893
01:11:55,156 --> 01:11:57,195
打吧。
Go ahead.

894
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:23,508
你，那个穿粉芭蕾舞裙的。
All right. You in the pink tutu.

895
01:12:23,808 --> 01:12:25,848
该走了。
Let's go.

896
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,481
见到你真荣幸。
Nice to have met you.

897
01:12:36,154 --> 01:12:38,194
她最好有一个好的解释。
She better have a good explanation!

898
01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:40,446
你还没见到她就开始大叫。
You haven't seen her and you're yelling.

899
01:12:40,575 --> 01:12:45,320
我不是。我就是想知道如果她有麻烦了
为什么不打个电话？
I am not! I am wondering aloud why she
couldn't have called if she was in trouble!

900
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:48,409
在你做任何蠢事之前先听听她是怎么说的！
Hear her side of it
before you do anything stupid!

901
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,328
格莱斯先生，Sergeant Taskal。坐下吧。
Mr Glass. Sergeant Taskal. Have a seat.

902
01:12:51,461 --> 01:12:53,749
这是我姐姐莱斯莉。
My sister Leslie.

903
01:12:54,588 --> 01:12:57,505
她在昨晚在下东区被逮捕。
She was arrested last night
on the Lower East Side.

904
01:12:57,633 --> 01:13:01,216
她在一座水塔楼下，我马上把她带过来。
She's in a holding tank downstairs.
I'll have her brought up.

905
01:13:01,345 --> 01:13:05,389
当我发现照片一样时，我立刻给你打了电话。
I telephoned you as soon
as I realised the photographs matched up.

906
01:13:05,516 --> 01:13:07,804
嗨，Ronnie，我是Taskal。把格莱斯带来。
Hey, Ronnie. Taskal here.
Bring up Glass.

907
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:11,974
我们可以结案了，她丈夫来了。
We're dropping the charges.
Her husband is here.

908
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:14,810
是的，显然他还没接走她。
Well, obviously
he hasn't picked her up yet.

909
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,651
哦，罗伯塔。
(Gary) Oh, Roberta.

910
01:13:18,779 --> 01:13:20,107
让我看看。
Let me see that.

911
01:13:20,238 --> 01:13:22,278
哦，天啊。
Oh, my God.

912
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:28,243
格莱斯先生，不久之前有人交了你妻子的保释金，
她已经被放走了。
Mr Glass, somebody paid your wife's bail
a little while ago and she was released.

913
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:29,829
你就与她擦肩而过。
You just missed her.

914
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:31,783
谁，谁交了保释金？
Who-Who paid her bail?

915
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:34,122
男朋友，拉皮条的，你知道吗？
Boyfriend. Pimp. Who knows?

916
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:36,291
拉皮条的？
Pimp?

917
01:13:38,256 --> 01:13:41,624
我不知道该怎么谢谢你，迪兹，
真的太不好意思了。
I don't know how to thank you, Dez.
I'm really sorry.

918
01:13:41,759 --> 01:13:43,799
考虑到这是我最后一次帮你，苏珊，
Consider it my final favour, Susan.

919
01:13:43,928 --> 01:13:46,466
你还真的没有辜负你的名声啊。
You are really living up
to your reputation.

920
01:13:46,848 --> 01:13:48,757
看吧，现在已经完事了，迪兹。
See, now, that's just it, Dez.

921
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:51,513
结束了，我并不是你想的那个人。
That's it! I'm not who you think I am.

922
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:54,265
-我可不在乎你是谁。。
-不，不，我不是你说的那个意思。
- I don't care who you are.
- No, no, I didn't mean it that way.

923
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:56,602
这里真的很难讲明白，我不是…
It's really getting complicated here.
I'm not...

924
01:13:56,732 --> 01:13:58,772
嘘。呆着别动。
Sssh. Stay right there.

925
01:14:12,664 --> 01:14:15,499
这是怎么了？
I don't believe it.

926
01:14:15,625 --> 01:14:17,368
天！
(Roberta) God!

927
01:14:25,551 --> 01:14:28,422
我不敢相信维多利亚能这样做。
I don't believe Victoria would do this.

928
01:14:30,097 --> 01:14:32,304
哦，天啊。
Oh, my God.

929
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:35,304
也许是昨晚抢我的那个人干的。
Maybe it was the guy
who grabbed me last night.

930
01:14:35,436 --> 01:14:37,475
什么？
What?

931
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:40,020
抢你的那个人？
The guy who grabbed you?

932
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:42,308
你看，我跟踪了我，迪兹。
See, he was after me, Dez.

933
01:14:42,443 --> 01:14:45,112
呃，并不是我，他跟踪苏珊…
Well, not me exactly.
He was after Susan,...

934
01:14:45,237 --> 01:14:47,064
管她是谁，我不是！
...wherever she is, who I'm not!

935
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:49,486
他认为她住在这儿，可是那个她不在，
因为我是…
He thinks she's staying here,
which she isn't because I am...

936
01:14:49,616 --> 01:14:51,656
我不想听！
I don't wanna hear it!

937
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:55,035
首先，我屁股被人扔在了人行道上。
First of all, I get thrown out
on my ass on the sidewalk.

938
01:14:55,163 --> 01:14:58,912
接着，我不得不支付了200美元的保释金
把你从看守所里接出来。
Then I have to fork up $200 bail
to get you out of jail.

939
01:14:59,042 --> 01:15:03,834
现在，我回家了，看到整个地方被撕的稀烂，
而为什么我还不知道！
Now I come home and the whole place
is torn apart. Why, I don't know!

940
01:15:04,422 --> 01:15:08,372
你要知道，苏珊，我不想看到这些狗屁事，
真的不想。
You know, I really don't need this shit,
Susan. I really don't.

941
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:09,672
好。
Fine.

942
01:15:09,802 --> 01:15:11,842
我走。
I'll leave.

943
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,050
哎呦！
Whoops!

944
01:15:22,482 --> 01:15:25,233
你知道吗，迪兹，我昨天晚上可能会被人杀死了。
You know, I could have been killed
last night, Dez!

945
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,398
我真的怕得要命！
I was really scared!

946
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:29,565
别想了。
Forget it.

947
01:15:29,697 --> 01:15:31,736
抱歉给你弄得这么乱。
Sorry about this mess.

948
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:35,410
我会赔给你，我会给你寄一张支票。
I can pay you back!
I'll send you a cheque.

949
01:15:35,536 --> 01:15:37,576
很好，又一张支票。
Great. Another cheque.

950
01:15:43,668 --> 01:15:45,875
哭
(sobbing)

951
01:16:02,103 --> 01:16:03,930
对不起。
Sorry.

952
01:16:04,063 --> 01:16:06,103
嘿嘿嘿，
Hey, hey, hey.

953
01:16:06,232 --> 01:16:08,770
这么乱不是最坏的。
This mess isn't so bad.

954
01:16:09,152 --> 01:16:11,476
我曾经开个派对，比着还要糟。
I've had worse parties than this.

955
01:16:39,806 --> 01:16:41,846
笑
(Roberta giggles)

956
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,599
开电视
(turns TV on)

957
01:17:32,607 --> 01:17:35,180
理查德・诺兰和布鲁斯・米克尔是在等待…
Richard Nolan and Bruce Meeker
were released...

958
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:38,319
…对他们1982年走私活动的定罪判决
提出上述期间被释放的。
...pending appeal of their 1982
conviction for smuggling.

959
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:42,775
他们是偷窃现在纽约展出的开罗收藏品中
They are prime suspects in the
disappearance of the Nefertiti earrings...

960
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:46,492
娜芙儿提提耳环的主要嫌疑人。
...from the Cairo collection
currently on display in New York.

961
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:49,622
娜芙儿提提？我靠！
Nefertiti? No shit!

962
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,323
这不正常！我刚刚看了一篇文章…
It's not uncommon!
I've just read an article...

963
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:55,711
…关于一个女人上午在城里胡作非为，
..about a woman who turned tricks
in the city all morning...

964
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,330
然后在下午回家前又恢复正常。
...and shopped all afternoon
before going home.

965
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:01,668
她做了好几年了，而她丈夫却一点不知道。
She did it for years
before her husband found out about it.

966
01:18:01,802 --> 01:18:06,131
罗伯塔不可能去卖淫，她哪有妓女那样的性感身材？
这不可能。
Roberta can't be a prostitute. She doesn't
like sex that much. It's impossible.

967
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:20,981
哦，天啊，我可听说有五分之四的妓女是同性恋。
Oh, my God. I have heard that four
out of five prostitutes are lesbians.

968
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:26,280
莱斯莉，如果我妻子是同性恋的话我会知道的。
Leslie, I think that I would know
if my wife was a lesbian.

969
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:28,948
怎么知道？连她是妓女你都不知道。
Why?!
You didn't know she was a prostitute.

970
01:18:29,787 --> 01:18:32,160
加里，我想你要接受这个事实…
Gary, I think you have
got to accept the fact...

971
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:36,122
就是在你的关系中存在着那些非常不正常的东西。
...that there is something very unusual
going on in your relationship.

972
01:18:36,252 --> 01:18:38,624
苏珊
(Gary) Susan.

973
01:18:38,755 --> 01:18:40,712
-苏珊。
-苏珊是谁？
- Susan!
- Who's Susan?

974
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,960
呃，别想歪了，她是来帮助我找罗伯塔的。
uh... Don't get the wrong idea.
She was helping me find Roberta.

975
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:49,344
苏珊。
(Gary) Susan!

976
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,925
苏珊。
Susan!

977
01:18:52,059 --> 01:18:53,851
你在干什么？
What are you doing here?

978
01:18:53,978 --> 01:18:56,895
我有好消息和坏消息，你要先听哪个？
I got good news and bad news.
What do you want first?

979
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,644
-你说过你会走的。
-好的，好消息。
- You said you were going to leave.
- OK, good news.

980
01:18:59,775 --> 01:19:01,852
你妻子不是跟那油球一起的。
Your wife isn't with the greaseball.

981
01:19:01,985 --> 01:19:05,853
苏珊，我妻子刚在下东区被人接走…
Susan, my wife has just been
picked up on the Lower East Side,...

982
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,694
……跟着她的带枪的拉皮条老板跑的！
...escaping from her gun-toting pimp!

983
01:19:08,826 --> 01:19:09,774
他不是拉皮条的。
He's not a pimp.

984
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:11,867
-他不是拉皮条的。
-他不是拉皮条的。
- He's not a pimp.
- He's not a pimp.

985
01:19:11,996 --> 01:19:15,280
坏消息是他有可能会杀了她，因为他认为她是我。
The bad news is he'll probably kill her
cos he thinks she's me.

986
01:19:15,415 --> 01:19:17,455
-什么？
-你从来没读过吗？
- What?
- Didn't you ever read this?

987
01:19:17,584 --> 01:19:19,541
她的日记。
She kept a diary.

988
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:21,995
有一些好定西:睡不着。
It's great stuff. "Couldn't sleep."

989
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:25,334
走进厨房，加里进来，关了灯。
"Went into kitchen.
Gary came in. Turned on light."

990
01:19:25,466 --> 01:19:28,384
加里走了，剩下生日蛋糕。
"Gary left. Finished birthday cake."

991
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:33,173
这有好几页。这将是封底了。
没有人的生活会这样无趣。
Pages of it. It's gotta be a cover.
Nobody's life could be this boring.

992
01:19:33,308 --> 01:19:35,798
你不该读这些的，这是私人隐私。
You shouldn't be reading that. It's private.

993
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:39,351
是啊，这个与她无关，而与我有关，听听这个。
Yeah, well, it's not about her.
It's about me. Listen to this.

994
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:42,814
他又开始找苏珊了，她从墨西哥州回来晚了。
"He's looking for Susan again.
She's late returning from Mexico."

995
01:19:42,942 --> 01:19:44,899
这是他第五个启事了。
"This is his fifth ad."

996
01:19:45,027 --> 01:19:48,361
为什么他如此强烈的想要见她？
她是谁？
"Why does he want to see her so badly?
Who is she?"

997
01:19:48,489 --> 01:19:50,730
还有我的一张照片。
And there's my picture.

998
01:19:51,659 --> 01:19:54,825
加里，为什么你不告诉我她读了这些启事呢？
Gary, why didn't you tell me
she read the personals?

999
01:19:54,953 --> 01:19:56,993
我们昨天就可以搞定了。
We could've settled this yesterday.

1000
01:19:57,122 --> 01:19:59,874
她一直都在看这些启事。我不认为…
She read them all the time. I didn't think...

1001
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,543
嗯，是。幸亏了每一个人，
我才能活下来想做点什么。
Yeah, well, fortunately for everybody,
I'm here and I'm thinking.

1002
01:20:04,672 --> 01:20:06,710
把车钥匙给我。
Give me the car keys.

1003
01:20:09,259 --> 01:20:11,382
我会把它完整带回来的。
I'll bring it right back.

1004
01:20:11,511 --> 01:20:13,089
嘿咻。
Hiya.

1005
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:16,801
加里。她拿的是你的汽车钥匙。
Gary! She is taking the car keys!

1006
01:20:18,977 --> 01:20:21,764
别说了，莱斯莉，行吗？
Shut up, Leslie. OK?

1007
01:20:22,897 --> 01:20:27,358
日记本。有点偷偷摸摸的感觉。
她是怎么评论我的？
Diary. That little sneak,
what did she say about me?

1008
01:20:51,008 --> 01:20:54,293
疯狂寻找
陌生人寻找苏珊
"Desperately seeking
stranger seeking Susan."

1009
01:20:54,428 --> 01:20:58,675
敬启者，在星期六晚9点半，百老汇魔术俱乐部见。
"Regarding key. Meet me Saturday night,
Magic Club, Broadway. 9.30pm. Be there."

1010
01:20:58,807 --> 01:21:01,013
-就这些了？
-她会喜欢的。
- Is that it?
- She'll love it.

1011
01:21:01,142 --> 01:21:03,182
去柜台付钱。
Pay at the cashier.

1012
01:21:07,232 --> 01:21:10,268
四十岁单身白人男性，
寻找下午的玩伴。
"Single white male, 40,
looking for afternoon playmates."

1013
01:21:10,402 --> 01:21:13,687
就这些了？去柜台付钱。
Is that it? Pay at the cashier.

1014
01:21:28,419 --> 01:21:30,246
迪兹…
Dez...

1015
01:21:32,214 --> 01:21:34,254
我不是苏珊。
I'm not Susan.

1016
01:21:35,384 --> 01:21:38,468
我是家庭主妇，住在纽泽西李堡。
I'm a housewife
and I live in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

1017
01:21:39,346 --> 01:21:41,802
我已经结婚四年了。
I've been married for four years.

1018
01:21:41,933 --> 01:21:43,592
我丈夫加里…
My husband Gary...

1019
01:21:43,725 --> 01:21:47,889
他做浴盆和浴室的生意。
He sells bathroom spas and saunas.

1020
01:21:53,235 --> 01:21:55,275
你怎么还是这样？
You never stop, do you?

1021
01:21:55,403 --> 01:21:57,610
不，这是真的，真的。
No, really! Really!

1022
01:21:57,739 --> 01:22:02,366
这就是我喜欢你的原因，我从不知道你
下一句会说什么，过来。
That's why I like you. I never know
what you'll say next. Come here.

1023
01:22:05,705 --> 01:22:08,659
-门锁声
-迪兹。
- (door lock rattles)
- Dez.

1024
01:22:11,378 --> 01:22:13,417
-那是什么？
-不知道。
- What is that?
- I dunno.

1025
01:22:15,757 --> 01:22:17,796
有人想进来。
Someone's trying to get in.

1026
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,969
哦，天啊。
Oh, my God.

1027
01:22:30,104 --> 01:22:32,097
哦，是吉姆。
Oh, my God, it's Jim.

1028
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,270
天啊。
Oh, my God.

1029
01:22:37,236 --> 01:22:40,771
吉姆，吉姆。
Jim... Jim. Jim.

1030
01:22:41,239 --> 01:22:46,281
谢天谢地，你吓坏我了。你觉得怎么样，啊？
Thank God. You had me worried.
How you doing, man? Huh? Huh?

1031
01:22:46,411 --> 01:22:49,282
有人打我了，一片黑。
Somebody jumped me. It was dark.

1032
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:52,157
嗯，呃…
Yeah. uh...

1033
01:22:52,709 --> 01:22:54,748
是我干的。
It was me.

1034
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,041
我以为你是别人呢。
I thought you were somebody else.

1035
01:22:58,173 --> 01:23:00,212
你以为我是谁？
Who did you think I was?

1036
01:23:01,801 --> 01:23:05,384
有人跟踪了苏珊，我想你可能是他。
Somebody's been following Susan.
I thought maybe you were him.

1037
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,470
谁跟踪她？
Who's following her?

1038
01:23:07,598 --> 01:23:09,342
不知道。
I don't know.

1039
01:23:09,475 --> 01:23:11,267
你知道苏珊。
You know Susan.

1040
01:23:11,394 --> 01:23:14,845
从她那里得到一个清楚的答案真是困难。
It's really tough
to get a straight answer out of her.

1041
01:23:17,108 --> 01:23:19,101
她需要我，迪兹。
She needs me, Dez.

1042
01:23:19,234 --> 01:23:21,560
我想或许她准备安顿下来了。
I think maybe she's ready to settle down.

1043
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:26,156
安顿下来？苏珊？别扯了，吉姆。
Settle down? Susan? Come on, Jim!

1044
01:23:26,284 --> 01:23:29,368
她从没有做过什么安顿的事，
她不是那类人。
She'd never do that.
She's really not the type.

1045
01:23:29,494 --> 01:23:31,487
从什么时候你这么了解她？
Since when do you know her so well?

1046
01:23:31,622 --> 01:23:35,701
呃，我只是不能看见她安顿下来。
我是说，她太野性了。
Well, I just can't see her settling down.
I mean, she's too wild.

1047
01:23:35,834 --> 01:23:38,160
但是这也是她的魅力。
But that's what's so great about her.

1048
01:23:38,294 --> 01:23:39,872
是这样吗？
Is that so?

1049
01:23:40,004 --> 01:23:43,338
我是说，你真的好像对她做了一番检查。
I mean, you really seem
to have examined this.

1050
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:47,134
嗯，我们一起度过了一些时间。
Well, we've been spending
some time together.

1051
01:23:50,181 --> 01:23:52,933
可…你在说什么呀，迪兹？
Just... what are you saying here, Dez?

1052
01:23:53,059 --> 01:23:54,469
啊？
Huh?

1053
01:23:56,938 --> 01:23:59,179
我不想对你胡说八道，吉姆。
I'm not gonna bullshit you, Jim.

1054
01:23:59,315 --> 01:24:02,399
是一件不好出口的事，
我没说它没有。
It was a shitty thing to do.
I'm not saying it wasn't.

1055
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:06,272
但是你自己说她诱人的。
But you yourself said she was irresistible.

1056
01:24:08,616 --> 01:24:10,655
哦，不会吧。
Oh, man.

1057
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:14,284
你，你为什么不再打我一下，就像这样的，
把我结果了？
W-why don't you just hit me again
and, like, finish me off?

1058
01:24:14,413 --> 01:24:16,453
-你看…
-啊？
- Look...
- Huh?!

1059
01:24:16,581 --> 01:24:19,120
别哭喊了。我真的为她而疯狂…
Don't cry about it.
I'm really crazy about her...

1060
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:21,243
…而且她也为我而疯狂。
...and she's really crazy about me.

1061
01:24:21,378 --> 01:24:23,704
-我对不起，
-听着，我了解苏珊。
- I'm sorry.
- Listen. I know Susan.

1062
01:24:23,838 --> 01:24:26,045
无论她告诉什么都是胡扯。
Whatever she told you doesn't mean shit.

1063
01:24:26,175 --> 01:24:30,338
她不是认真的，迪兹。我是知道的，
我追了她好几年了。
She plays with people, Dez. I oughta
know, I've been chasing her for years.

1064
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,842
我认为她跟我是认真的。
I don't think she's playing with me.

1065
01:24:32,972 --> 01:24:35,012
胡说。
Bullshit.

1066
01:24:35,767 --> 01:24:37,641
这样吧，吉姆。
All right, Jim.

1067
01:24:37,769 --> 01:24:39,809
我们干嘛不问问她呢？
Why don't we just ask her?

1068
01:24:42,357 --> 01:24:43,768
苏珊。
Susan!

1069
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,188
苏…她在这儿？
Su...! You mean she's here?!

1070
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:48,981
苏珊。
Susan!

1071
01:24:49,113 --> 01:24:51,569
-到这儿来。
-苏珊。
- Come on out here.
- Susan...!

1072
01:24:55,161 --> 01:24:57,201
苏珊。
Susan!

1073
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:08,712
她走了。
She's gone.

1074
01:25:10,635 --> 01:25:12,591
她就在这儿。
She was here.

1075
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,759
我发誓。
I swear to God.

1076
01:25:14,889 --> 01:25:16,927
水壶鸣响
(kettle whistles)

1077
01:26:06,771 --> 01:26:08,811
迪兹，你在上面吗？
(Jim) Dez, are you up there?

1078
01:26:10,233 --> 01:26:11,893
怎么了？
Yeah?

1079
01:26:13,612 --> 01:26:16,696
猜猜怎么了？
我想她把我俩都耍了。
Guess what, man?
I think she's jerking us both around.

1080
01:26:16,824 --> 01:26:18,448
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

1081
01:26:18,574 --> 01:26:22,026
你看看吧，这个他妈的陌生人是谁？
Check this out.
I mean, who the hell is this stranger?

1082
01:26:22,162 --> 01:26:23,407
鼓
(drum roll)

1083
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,679
苏珊，我还是不明白我们来这儿干什么。
Susan, I still don't understand
why we're here.

1084
01:26:40,804 --> 01:26:43,094
信我吧，加里。你会惊喜万分的。
Trust me, Gar.
You're in for a real surprise.

1085
01:26:43,224 --> 01:26:46,142
你的惊喜万分已经让我紧张了。
Your surprises are beginning
to make me nervous.

1086
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:49,056
-她怎么说？
-我们会惊喜万分的。
- What'd she say?
- We're in for a real surprise.

1087
01:26:49,188 --> 01:26:51,643
我想我们在这儿看不到Tony Bennett。
I guess we're not gonna see
Tony Bennett here.

1088
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,813
我应该叫警察跟着我们。
I'd settle for a police escort.

1089
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:56,777
你怎么能让她穿上罗伯塔的夹克？
How could you let her wear
Roberta's jacket?

1090
01:26:56,903 --> 01:27:01,032
嘿，她没衣服了，总得穿点什么吧。
Hey, she's cold.
She's gotta wear something.

1091
01:27:01,157 --> 01:27:03,530
为什么你不把你的指甲剪了？
(dummy) Why don't you
cut your fingernails?

1092
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,949
我听不见你在说啥…
I can't hear what you're saying...

1093
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:08,119
捂住叫喊
(muffled shouting)

1094
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:16,577
迪兹，如果她看到我们俩都在这儿，
她很可能又一走了之。
Dez, if she sees us both here,
she'll probably just split again.

1095
01:27:16,715 --> 01:27:18,754
那你回去吧。
You could go home.

1096
01:27:18,883 --> 01:27:21,837
我要看看他妈的陌生人是谁。
I wanna see who this fuckin' stranger is.

1097
01:27:28,935 --> 01:27:33,015
让我猜。三倍龙舌兰到天亮。
Let me guess. Triple tequila sunrise.

1098
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,223
姜味汽水。
Ginger ale.

1099
01:27:38,026 --> 01:27:39,936
你是威士忌。
And you're the Scotch.

1100
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:41,980
这是你的。
This must be yours.

1101
01:27:42,115 --> 01:27:44,153
朗姆酒和Tab。
Rum and Tab.

1102
01:27:48,704 --> 01:27:51,574
坐着别动，我去找找陌生人。
Sit tight. I'm gonna
go look for the stranger.

1103
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:54,580
什么陌生人？
What stranger?

1104
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:57,876
-天，她可真迷人。
-一坨漂亮的屎罢了。
- God, she's gorgeous.
- Beauty feces.

1105
01:28:10,975 --> 01:28:12,470
她在那。
There she is.

1106
01:28:12,602 --> 01:28:15,888
-哪？
-就在那儿，和买烟女说话的那个。
- Where?
- Right there. Talking to the cigarette girl.

1107
01:28:16,022 --> 01:28:18,809
那不是苏珊。我之前从没见过那个女孩。
That's not Susan.
I never even seen that girl before.

1108
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:21,563
迪兹，那是苏珊。你认为我能搞错吗？
Dez, that's Susan.
Don't you think I should know?

1109
01:28:22,486 --> 01:28:25,903
那可能是苏珊，但不是我的苏珊。
That might be a Susan
but that's not my Susan.

1110
01:28:26,032 --> 01:28:29,614
-那是我的苏珊。
-那么在巴特利公园的女孩是谁？
- That's my Susan.
- Then who was the girl at Battery Park?

1111
01:28:45,675 --> 01:28:47,668
谁是陌生人？
So who's the stranger?

1112
01:28:47,803 --> 01:28:49,878
吉米！
Jimmy!

1113
01:28:50,013 --> 01:28:52,053
谁是陌生人？
Who's the stranger?

1114
01:28:52,182 --> 01:28:54,673
-说来话长。
-嗯啊。
- It's a long story.
- uh-huh.

1115
01:28:54,809 --> 01:28:56,933
你怎么也不会知道她的。
You wouldn't know her anyway.

1116
01:28:57,062 --> 01:28:59,101
-她？
-是，她。
- Her?
- Yeah. Her.

1117
01:29:01,858 --> 01:29:04,528
过来，找个私人空间去说话。
Come on. We'll talk about it in private.

1118
01:29:07,239 --> 01:29:09,277
敲门
(knocking)

1119
01:29:09,407 --> 01:29:12,028
我们还有三分钟上场。
We've got three minutes before curtain!

1120
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:14,199
戴上你的假发马上出发。
Get your wig on and get out there!

1121
01:29:22,544 --> 01:29:24,537
我在想苏珊会不会出事。
I wonder what happened to Susan.

1122
01:29:24,672 --> 01:29:26,913
看起来像是你丢了女友。
Looks like you lost your girlfriend.

1123
01:29:27,049 --> 01:29:29,375
嘿，赖瑞，我结婚了，懂吗？
Hey, Larry! I'm married, all right?

1124
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,798
-哦，得了吧。
-怎么？
- Oh, please!
- What?

1125
01:29:31,929 --> 01:29:33,969
乐队声
(band plays fanfare)

1126
01:29:38,727 --> 01:29:41,348
晚上好，女士们先生们。
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1127
01:29:41,479 --> 01:29:44,765
欢迎来到魔术俱乐部，我是主持人，雷。
Welcome to the Magic Club.
I'm your host, Ray...

1128
01:29:46,318 --> 01:29:49,188
酒吧生，给我结帐吧。
Bartender...
Can I have the check, please?

1129
01:29:50,822 --> 01:29:53,692
有谁从女皇区出来的吗？
Hey, is there anyone out here
from, uh... Queens?

1130
01:29:53,825 --> 01:29:56,316
你。好的。我自己是从正常人家的肚子里出来的。
You. Well, I'm from
normal parents myself.

1131
01:29:56,452 --> 01:29:57,650
零星笑声
(scattered laughter)

1132
01:29:57,787 --> 01:30:02,199
是这样的，今晚我们给大家一个特别的待遇。
Anyway, we got a special treat
for you people this evening.

1133
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,789
让我介绍一下独一无二的，举世无双的…
Introducing the one, the only...

1134
01:30:05,252 --> 01:30:07,292
苏珊，快上来。
Susan, get up here!

1135
01:30:07,422 --> 01:30:10,707
…还有他可爱的助手，Davina…
...and his very lovely assistant, Davina...

1136
01:30:10,841 --> 01:30:14,127
…今夜女王，鼓掌吧。
...Queen of the Night! So let's hear it!

1137
01:30:25,106 --> 01:30:28,309
加里，那是…
(Leslie) Gary... Is that...

1138
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:30,933
不会吧。
It can't be.

1139
01:30:31,070 --> 01:30:33,905
我太喜欢了，真是好魔术啊。
I'm really enjoying this. It's a great trick.

1140
01:30:42,497 --> 01:30:44,289
苏珊？
Susan?

1141
01:30:44,416 --> 01:30:47,370
-罗伯塔？
-我不敢相信。
- Roberta?
- I don't believe it.

1142
01:30:48,127 --> 01:30:50,914
-罗伯塔…
-加里，坐下。
- Roberta...
- Gary, sit down.

1143
01:30:58,596 --> 01:31:01,087
呃，我在这儿呆会儿，谢谢。
uh... I think I'll be staying, thank you.

1144
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:02,801
鼓
(drum roll)

1145
01:31:24,663 --> 01:31:27,580
烟，要烟吗？
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1146
01:31:29,793 --> 01:31:32,034
她还是很有型的啊。
She's really got style in a way.

1147
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:34,210
她很不错啊，加里。
She's good, Gary.

1148
01:31:35,841 --> 01:31:37,880
哦，对不起。
(Larry) Right. Sorry.

1149
01:32:00,615 --> 01:32:02,653
尖叫
(Roberta screams)

1150
01:32:15,962 --> 01:32:18,002
(screams)

1151
01:32:20,550 --> 01:32:22,377
哇哦！
Bravo!

1152
01:32:27,182 --> 01:32:29,851
是他，就是他。
That's him. That's the guy.

1153
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,975
就是他！
That's the guy!

1154
01:32:34,105 --> 01:32:35,897
嗨，救救我。
Hey, help me!

1155
01:32:36,482 --> 01:32:39,399
嘿，就是他，就是他，救命。
Hey! That's the guy!
That's the guy! Help!

1156
01:32:39,527 --> 01:32:43,145
来人抓住他，帮帮我。
Somebody stop that guy! Help!

1157
01:32:47,201 --> 01:32:49,324
怎么…罗伯塔。
What... Roberta!

1158
01:32:49,454 --> 01:32:51,861
-罗伯塔。
-你是谁？
- Roberta!
- Who are you?

1159
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,247
怎么了？
What's going on?!

1160
01:33:01,715 --> 01:33:04,004
-他打伤你了？我杀了他。
-加里。
- Did he hurt you? I'll kill him!
- Gary!

1161
01:33:04,135 --> 01:33:07,170
-没事了，我现在可以搞定了。
-这人是谁？
- It's OK, I can take care of it now.
- Who is this guy?

1162
01:33:07,303 --> 01:33:09,343
你是谁？你什么意思，我是谁？
Who are you?
What do you mean, who am I?

1163
01:33:09,473 --> 01:33:11,300
-拜托…
-哦。
- Please...
- Oh.

1164
01:33:13,184 --> 01:33:15,592
加里，迪兹。
Gary... Dez.

1165
01:33:15,729 --> 01:33:18,398
迪兹，他是加里，我丈夫。
Dez, this is Gary, my husband.

1166
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,059
嗨。
Hi.

1167
01:33:21,192 --> 01:33:24,193
-做热水盆的生意人？
-是。
- The hot-tub salesman?
- Yeah.

1168
01:33:24,321 --> 01:33:27,156
这么说你昨晚告诉我的是真的了。
So you were telling me
the truth last night.

1169
01:33:27,282 --> 01:33:29,321
昨晚？哦，不。
Last night? Oh, no.

1170
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,776
-你和他过了一夜？
-加里…
- Did you spend the night with him?
- Gary...

1171
01:33:31,911 --> 01:33:34,782
-他就是警察提到的拉皮条的？
-他不是拉皮条的。
- Is he the pimp the police mentioned?
- He's not a pimp!

1172
01:33:34,914 --> 01:33:36,953
我不是拉皮条的，我是她一个朋友。
I'm not a pimp. I'm a friend of hers.

1173
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:40,119
-有谁呢能告诉我发生什么了？
-我自己都不知道。
- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- I'm not sure myself.

1174
01:33:40,252 --> 01:33:42,292
-这段时间我糟糕透了…
-我也是。
- I'm having a hard time...
- So am I!

1175
01:33:42,421 --> 01:33:46,004
先停一停，停一停。
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Please, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1176
01:33:46,133 --> 01:33:47,544
听我说。
OK, listen.

1177
01:33:47,676 --> 01:33:52,588
迪兹，迪兹，我需要和加里单独谈一谈，好吗？
Dez. Dez, I really need to talk
to Gary alone, OK? Please?

1178
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:55,183
好吧。
OK.

1179
01:33:55,309 --> 01:33:57,764
我也需要自己静一静。
I really need some time alone too.

1180
01:33:58,603 --> 01:34:00,643
对不起。
I'm sorry.

1181
01:34:09,656 --> 01:34:13,273
都过去了，没事了，噩梦结束了。
It's all right. It's all right.
The nightmare's over.

1182
01:34:15,745 --> 01:34:17,784
弹球机
(pinball machine pinging)

1183
01:34:27,423 --> 01:34:30,590
别吱吱叫，你要把我带出去。
Don't make a peep.
You're gonna get me outta here.

1184
01:34:30,718 --> 01:34:32,757
低叫
(Susan whimpers)

1185
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:35,010
腿不错。
Nice legs.

1186
01:34:38,934 --> 01:34:41,971
-我不明白你和那个家伙为什么会在这儿。
-你又为什么在这儿？
- I don't understand why you're here.
- Why are you here?

1187
01:34:42,104 --> 01:34:44,891
等等，先别管那个，你为什么离开我？
Wait a minute. Never mind that.
Why did you leave me?

1188
01:34:45,024 --> 01:34:46,933
那是某种意外的事。
It was sort of an accident.

1189
01:34:47,068 --> 01:34:49,855
意外？当你在拉客也是个意外了？
When you were soliciting,
that was an accident, too?

1190
01:34:49,987 --> 01:34:52,026
是的，当然是，加里。
Yes, of course! Gary!

1191
01:34:52,447 --> 01:34:54,736
一切都是从寻人启事开始的。
It all started with the personals.

1192
01:34:54,866 --> 01:34:57,902
那是给苏珊的广告，《不顾一切找苏珊》。
There was this ad for Susan.
"Desperately seeking Susan."

1193
01:35:04,459 --> 01:35:06,451
他到哪里去了？
Where did he go?

1194
01:35:06,586 --> 01:35:09,255
所以他们就认为我是个妓女而把我逮捕了。
So they thought
I was a prostitute and arrested me.

1195
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,254
罗伯塔，你是同性恋吗？
Roberta, are you a lesbian?

1196
01:35:11,382 --> 01:35:13,920
莱斯莉说很多妓女都是同性恋。
Leslie said
lots of prostitutes are lesbians.

1197
01:35:14,051 --> 01:35:17,635
加里，你没有听我在说什么，
我不是妓女，也不是同性恋。
Gary, you're not listening to me.
I'm not a prostitute or a lesbian!

1198
01:35:17,764 --> 01:35:21,132
我们需要找专业人员来帮助你，
我不管那要花多少钱。
We'll get professional help.
I don't care how much it costs.

1199
01:35:21,267 --> 01:35:25,311
-我只要你现在跟我回家。
-为什么？
- I just want you to come home with me.
- Why?

1200
01:35:25,437 --> 01:35:27,929
为什么？你什么意思，为什么？
Why? What do you mean, why?

1201
01:35:28,066 --> 01:35:30,141
为什么你要我跟你一起回家？
Why do you want me
to come home with you?

1202
01:35:30,275 --> 01:35:32,268
拜托，别那么激动，行吗？
Come on, don't get excited, all right?

1203
01:35:32,403 --> 01:35:34,525
你是吸毒了还是吃什么了？
What, are you on drugs
or something now?

1204
01:35:34,655 --> 01:35:36,648
天啊。
God.

1205
01:35:36,782 --> 01:35:38,490
看着我。
Look at me.

1206
01:35:38,617 --> 01:35:41,287
我看着呢，你看起来像个怪物。
I looked at you. You look ridiculous.

1207
01:35:41,412 --> 01:35:45,029
我是说看着我，加里，看着我。
I mean look at me, Gary.
Look at me.

1208
01:35:52,672 --> 01:35:55,293
我不和你一起回家。
I'm not coming home with you.

1209
01:35:56,634 --> 01:35:58,924
你只不过是累了。
You're just tired.

1210
01:36:01,473 --> 01:36:04,924
为什么你不换套衣服，然后我们在家中讨论这个？
Why don't you get changed
and we'll talk about it at home?

1211
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:06,802
来吧，来吧。
Come on. Come on.

1212
01:36:10,898 --> 01:36:12,274
很好，这很好。
Fine. That's fine.

1213
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,978
呃，我先去外边，我只等你五分钟。
uh... I'm gonna go outside
and I'm gonna wait for five minutes.

1214
01:36:18,823 --> 01:36:21,693
如果你不过来，我就自己走了。
And if you're not there,
I'm gonna leave without you.

1215
01:36:23,410 --> 01:36:25,450
再见，加里。
Goodbye, Gary.

1216
01:36:58,194 --> 01:37:00,234
嘿，哇！
Hey! Whoa!

1217
01:37:05,201 --> 01:37:07,240
你从哪里得到的？
Where did you get this?

1218
01:37:08,454 --> 01:37:10,494
别动。
Stay!

1219
01:37:16,754 --> 01:37:18,793
苏珊，这是怎么回事？
Susan, what's going on?

1220
01:37:26,889 --> 01:37:28,169
救救我。
(whispers) Help me!

1221
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,635
别推我。
Don't push!

1222
01:37:42,236 --> 01:37:44,229
动作好快，陌生人。
Good goin', stranger.

1223
01:37:44,364 --> 01:37:46,403
苏珊。
Susan.

1224
01:37:57,042 --> 01:37:59,119
-嗨。
-笑
- Hi.
- (giggling)

1225
01:37:59,253 --> 01:38:01,292
怎么了？
What's going on?

1226
01:38:01,422 --> 01:38:03,580
朋友们，现在是决战时刻了。
My friend, this is the crucial moment.

1227
01:38:04,091 --> 01:38:07,424
我们把主力转移到船上。
Our force field power plant
has been transferred to the ship.

1228
01:38:07,594 --> 01:38:10,798
我们的防线在敌人最薄弱的地方，
完全可以视实际情况而机动作战。
Our defences are at their weakest,
almost fully automatic.

1229
01:38:10,931 --> 01:38:14,798
突然袭击的成功可能性是非常大的。
The likelihood of a successful
mutant attack is at its strongest.

1230
01:38:14,935 --> 01:38:19,264
-并且他们可能没有意识到。
-我们努力保持这种状况…
- But they may be unaware.
- We've tried to keep them away...

1231
01:38:34,329 --> 01:38:36,037
哎呦。
Ow!

1232
01:38:36,164 --> 01:38:38,951
-嗨。
-嗨。
- Hi.
- Hi.

1233
01:38:41,085 --> 01:38:44,121
你怎么样了？
Huh. How are you doin'?

1234
01:38:45,048 --> 01:38:47,087
还行。
OK.

1235
01:38:49,427 --> 01:38:52,132
那么我猜你的名字不叫苏珊，啊？
So I guess your name isn't Susan, huh?

1236
01:38:53,556 --> 01:38:55,595
那么是什么？
So what is it?

1237
01:38:55,724 --> 01:38:58,678
罗伯塔。
Roberta.

1238
01:38:58,811 --> 01:39:01,681
-罗伯塔。
-嗯。嗯。
- Roberta.
- Mm-hm.

1239
01:39:03,941 --> 01:39:05,980
多好的名字。
That's nice.

1240
01:39:52,856 --> 01:39:57,792
多好的一对！
WHAT A PAIR!

1241
01:39:59,149 --> 01:40:49,146
