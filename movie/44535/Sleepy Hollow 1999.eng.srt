1
00:03:54,961 --> 00:03:58,672
Help here! Lend a hand here! Anyone!

2
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:02,092
Constable Crane?

3
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:04,011
Ichabod Crane, is that you?

4
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:05,429
None other.

5
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:07,431
Not only me.

6
00:04:07,474 --> 00:04:11,435
I have found something,
which was lately a man.

7
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:17,650
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,737
Just a moment, if I may.
We do not yet know the cause of death.

9
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:25,324
When you find them in the river,
cause of death is drowning.

10
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,034
Possibly so,
if there is water in the lungs,

11
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:30,246
but by pathology we might be able to
determine whether or not he was dead

12
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,538
before he went into the river.

13
00:04:31,623 --> 00:04:33,666
I will need to examine the body.

14
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,669
Cut him up. Are we heathens?

15
00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:39,588
What happened to him?

16
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:41,924
Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.

17
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,058
Good work.

18
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:54,395
The millennium is almost upon us.

19
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:58,315
In a few months,
we will be living in the 19th century,

20
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,860
yet our courts continue
to rely on medieval devices of torture.

21
00:05:01,903 --> 00:05:03,028
Stand down!

22
00:05:03,113 --> 00:05:06,198
I stand up for sense and justice.

23
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:08,492
Our jails overflow with men and women

24
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,661
convicted on confessions
worth no more than this one.

25
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:12,079
Constable Crane!

26
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:17,042
This is a song that we have heard
from you more than once.

27
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:20,879
Now, there are two courses open to me.

28
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:24,883
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells

29
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:28,053
until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office.

30
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:29,680
I beg pardon.

31
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:33,350
But why am I the only one
who sees that, to solve crimes,

32
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:36,729
to detect the guilty,
we must use our brains

33
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:41,400
to recognize vital clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

34
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,611
Which brings me to the second course.

35
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:49,325
There is a town upstate,
two days' journey to the north

36
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,327
in the Hudson Highlands.

37
00:05:51,411 --> 00:05:55,164
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

38
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:57,583
Have you heard of it?

39
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,084
I have not.

40
00:05:59,127 --> 00:06:02,838
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

41
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:07,384
Three persons have been
murdered there, all within a fortnight.

42
00:06:07,886 --> 00:06:12,264
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

43
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:13,766
Lopped off?

44
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:16,810
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

45
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:21,065
You will take
these experimentations of yours

46
00:06:21,107 --> 00:06:22,941
to Sleepy Hollow

47
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:26,737
and there you will detect the murderer.

48
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,616
Bring him here to face our good justice.

49
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,369
Will you do this?

50
00:06:34,788 --> 00:06:35,913
I shall.

51
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:39,958
Remember, it is you,

52
00:06:40,001 --> 00:06:42,544
Ichabod Crane,

53
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:45,881
who is now put to the test.

54
00:11:50,061 --> 00:11:53,063
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

55
00:11:53,106 --> 00:11:55,148
"Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

56
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:57,567
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

57
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:00,445
"Who's got a kiss
for the Pickety Witch?"

58
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,949
Is it Theodore?

59
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:06,118
No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger.

60
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,994
Then have a kiss on account.

61
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:18,797
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

62
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,550
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

63
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,219
And who are you, friend?
We have not heard your name yet.

64
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:26,722
I've not said it. Excuse me.

65
00:12:27,807 --> 00:12:29,474
- You need some manners.
- Brom.

66
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:31,768
Come, come.
We'll have no raised voices.

67
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:34,646
It is only to raise spirits
during this dark time

68
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:38,817
that I and my dear wife
are giving this little party.

69
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:42,821
Young sir, you are most welcome,
even if you are selling something.

70
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:44,489
Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:47,909
I am Constable Ichabod Crane,
sent to you from New York

72
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,870
to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.

73
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,498
Then Sleepy Hollow
is grateful to you, Constable Crane.

74
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,626
And we hope you will honor us
by remaining in this house.

75
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,211
Well spoke, dear.

76
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:01,423
Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on!

77
00:13:08,306 --> 00:13:09,848
Excuse me, please.

78
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:16,521
Thank you.

79
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:19,483
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

80
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,776
I will, sir.

81
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:26,198
Thank God you're here.

82
00:13:38,294 --> 00:13:41,296
Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear.

83
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:48,553
We are joined by
Dr. Thomas Lancaster,

84
00:13:48,638 --> 00:13:50,222
Reverend Steenwyck,

85
00:13:50,306 --> 00:13:53,016
our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse,

86
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,184
and lastly,

87
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:58,522
this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook,
our notary.

88
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,398
And you, sir?

89
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:03,610
A simple farmer who has prospered.

90
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:07,072
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

91
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:10,075
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

92
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,243
Thank you.

93
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:14,663
So...

94
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:19,125
Three persons murdered.

95
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:23,630
First, Peter Van Garrett

96
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:27,259
and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

97
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:32,556
Both of them strong, capable men,

98
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:34,933
found together

99
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:37,477
decapitated.

100
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,691
One week later, the Widow Winship.

101
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:47,153
Also decapitated.

102
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,785
Now, I will need to ask you
many questions.

103
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,290
But first, let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

104
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:05,922
How much have your superiors
explained to you, Constable?

105
00:15:06,841 --> 00:15:11,344
Only that the three
were slain in open ground,

106
00:15:12,096 --> 00:15:15,473
their heads found severed
from their bodies.

107
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:18,310
Their heads were not found severed.

108
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,520
Their heads were not found at all.

109
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:26,610
The heads are gone?

110
00:15:26,652 --> 00:15:27,861
Taken.

111
00:15:27,945 --> 00:15:30,864
Taken by the Headless Horseman.

112
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,824
Taken back to hell.

113
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:35,827
Pardon, I don't...

114
00:15:35,912 --> 00:15:38,496
Perhaps you had better sit down.

115
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,167
Yes.

116
00:15:46,547 --> 00:15:49,299
The horseman was
a Hessian mercenary

117
00:15:49,342 --> 00:15:52,093
sent to these shores by German princes

118
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:55,096
to keep Americans
under the yoke of England.

119
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:59,225
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money,

120
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,979
the horseman came for love of carnage.

121
00:16:03,022 --> 00:16:06,816
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

122
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:13,114
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

123
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:19,204
He was infamous
for riding his horse hard into battle,

124
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,831
chopping off heads at full gallop.

125
00:16:21,874 --> 00:16:25,502
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points

126
00:16:25,544 --> 00:16:28,213
to add to the ferocity of his appearance.

127
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:40,266
This butcher didn't finally reach his end

128
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:42,894
until the winter of '79

129
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:48,066
not far from here in our Western Woods.

130
00:17:42,413 --> 00:17:44,873
They chopped off his head
with his own sword.

131
00:17:44,957 --> 00:17:48,001
Even today,
the Western Woods is a haunted place

132
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:50,295
where brave men will not venture.

133
00:17:52,715 --> 00:17:55,216
For what was planted
in the ground that day

134
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,261
was a seed of evil.

135
00:18:01,474 --> 00:18:03,808
And so it has been for 20 years.

136
00:18:04,643 --> 00:18:06,394
But now the Hessian wakes.

137
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:10,440
He's on the rampage,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

138
00:18:15,738 --> 00:18:17,614
Are you saying...

139
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,450
Is that what you believe?

140
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:24,245
Seeing is believing.

141
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:30,668
They tell me that you've brought books
and trappings of scientific investigation.

142
00:18:31,045 --> 00:18:35,256
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

143
00:18:43,224 --> 00:18:44,516
I see.

144
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:48,186
Reverend Steenwyck.

145
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,021
Gentlemen.

146
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:54,943
Murder needs no ghosts
to come from the grave.

147
00:18:55,027 --> 00:18:59,322
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

148
00:18:59,365 --> 00:19:01,866
You're a long way
from New York, Constable.

149
00:19:02,326 --> 00:19:05,662
The assassin is
a man of flesh and blood

150
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:07,539
and I will discover him.

151
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,956
Come out, devil.

152
00:20:42,468 --> 00:20:43,968
His name's Gunpowder.

153
00:20:44,887 --> 00:20:47,138
He should do just fine, Mr. Killian.

154
00:20:47,806 --> 00:20:48,932
Thank you.

155
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,434
Good luck, sir.
If you need help, you call my name.

156
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:52,936
Much appreciated.

157
00:20:53,479 --> 00:20:55,897
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

158
00:20:55,981 --> 00:20:58,107
Everything's going to be just fine.

159
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:02,737
Thomas! Inside!

160
00:21:04,823 --> 00:21:06,324
Run along for your breakfast.

161
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,618
Kiss your mother
once for you and twice for me.

162
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:11,663
Murder! The horseman's killed again!

163
00:21:13,457 --> 00:21:16,209
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.
Come on.

164
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,253
No, no. Come on, the other way.

165
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:19,837
No, no. Turn around.

166
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:26,803
Good horsy.

167
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:42,318
- Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:44,696
The rest of you keep a sharp lookout.

169
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,658
It's all right. I'm here now.

170
00:22:13,726 --> 00:22:16,227
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

171
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:20,898
I see.

172
00:22:21,817 --> 00:22:23,943
And the head?

173
00:22:25,738 --> 00:22:28,823
Taken.

174
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:32,827
Interesting. Very interesting.

175
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:33,953
What is?

176
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,832
In headless-corpse cases of this sort,
the head is removed

177
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,709
to prevent identification of the body.

178
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:42,795
But we know
this was Jonathan Masbath.

179
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,256
Precisely. So why was
the head removed?

180
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:46,507
- Why?
- Right.

181
00:22:49,595 --> 00:22:51,846
- You have moved the body?
- I did.

182
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,724
- You must never move the body!
- Why not?

183
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:56,142
Because.

184
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:13,117
The stride is gigantic.

185
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:17,872
The attacker rode Masbath down,

186
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:20,583
turned his horse,

187
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,711
came back.

188
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:25,713
Came back to claim the head.

189
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:44,732
Yes.

190
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:47,777
There's a chemical reaction.

191
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,197
It shows there was a powerful,
singular thrust to the neck.

192
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:20,810
- Interesting.
- What is it?

193
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:24,897
The wound was cauterized
in the very instant,

194
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,860
as though the blade itself were red hot.

195
00:24:28,944 --> 00:24:32,363
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

196
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,075
The Devil's fire.

197
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:46,419
"Be vigilant,"
as it sayeth in the Book of Peter,

198
00:24:46,503 --> 00:24:48,754
chapter five, verse eight.

199
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:51,382
"Because your adversary the devil,

200
00:24:51,425 --> 00:24:54,677
"as a roaring lion, walketh about,

201
00:24:55,596 --> 00:24:57,805
"seeking whom he may devour."

202
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,934
God rest Jonathan Masbath.

203
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:04,937
Amen.

204
00:25:28,921 --> 00:25:30,421
Mr. Constable, sir.

205
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:34,342
You're young Masbath.

206
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:38,095
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

207
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,181
Masbath, at your service.

208
00:25:40,265 --> 00:25:42,600
In honor bound to avenge my father.

209
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:46,896
Well, one and only Masbath,
I thank you very much,

210
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,815
but your mother will need you
more than I.

211
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,443
My mother is in heaven, sir.

212
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:55,738
She has my father now to care for her.

213
00:25:55,781 --> 00:26:00,201
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

214
00:26:00,285 --> 00:26:03,955
Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

215
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,834
I'm sorry for your loss,
young Mr. Masbath.

216
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:23,724
- Constable Crane.
- Mr. Philipse?

217
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,518
Something you should know.

218
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:28,854
Jonathan Masbath
was not the fourth victim,

219
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:32,233
- but the fifth.
- The fifth?

220
00:26:32,317 --> 00:26:33,442
Aye.

221
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,863
Five victims in four graves.

222
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,835
Young Masbath.

223
00:26:51,587 --> 00:26:53,588
Find a place
in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters.

224
00:26:53,672 --> 00:26:55,172
Wake me before dawn.

225
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:57,550
I hope you have a strong stomach.

226
00:27:00,137 --> 00:27:01,554
Peter Van Garrett.

227
00:27:02,639 --> 00:27:04,098
Dirk Van Garrett.

228
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,392
Jonathan Masbath.

229
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,980
There are five victims, four graves.

230
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,538
The Widow Winship.

231
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:53,648
Bring the Widow in.

232
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:58,235
This is most irregular, Constable.

233
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:01,113
I should hope so, Doctor,
but in this case, necessary.

234
00:28:01,198 --> 00:28:02,782
We need to operate immediately.

235
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:05,701
Operate? She's dead.

236
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:07,745
When we say "operate,"

237
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:10,706
we mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

238
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:17,672
Once more, the neck wound cauterized.

239
00:28:20,175 --> 00:28:23,469
The sword thrust to the stomach,
the same.

240
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:25,262
But to what purpose?

241
00:28:25,305 --> 00:28:27,723
To what is your purpose
is the question.

242
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:31,435
What manner of instruments are these?

243
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,104
Some of my own design.

244
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,400
All right, then.
Step outside, young Masbath.

245
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:39,485
Thank you very, very much
for your help, Mr. Killian.

246
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,862
And if you don't mind, Doctor,

247
00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:45,241
my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

248
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:26,532
I am finished.

249
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:29,493
What in the name of God
have you done to her?

250
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:32,037
We are dealing with a madman.

251
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:34,498
What did you find out, Constable?

252
00:29:34,541 --> 00:29:36,959
The Widow Winship was with child.

253
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:00,858
Ichabod.

254
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:05,404
Ichabod. Ichabod.

255
00:30:06,698 --> 00:30:07,865
Ichabod.

256
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,215
Who's there?

257
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:37,788
Ichabod.

258
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,789
Oh, pardon my intrusion. I saw a light.

259
00:33:01,873 --> 00:33:05,292
It is no intrusion.
I come here to read when I am wakeful.

260
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:13,384
To read books which you must hide?

261
00:33:13,468 --> 00:33:16,220
They were my mother's books.
My father believes

262
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:19,056
tales of romance caused the brain fever
that killed my mother.

263
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,392
She died two years ago
come midwinter.

264
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:24,269
The nurse who cared for her
during her sickness

265
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:25,980
is now Lady Van Tassel.

266
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:29,233
There was something else, too.

267
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:31,443
Why did no one think to mention that

268
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:34,530
the Van Garretts are kith and kin
to the Van Tassels?

269
00:33:34,572 --> 00:33:37,116
Why, because there is hardly
a household in Sleepy Hollow

270
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,411
that is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

271
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,745
I see.

272
00:33:46,918 --> 00:33:49,461
This land we're looking at
was Van Garrett land,

273
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:52,297
given to my father
when I was in swaddling clothes.

274
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:54,883
The Van Garretts were
the richest family around these parts.

275
00:33:54,926 --> 00:33:57,052
When my father brought us
to Sleepy Hollow,

276
00:33:57,095 --> 00:34:00,014
Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

277
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:04,184
My father worked hard for his family,
and prospered and built this house.

278
00:34:04,269 --> 00:34:06,270
And I owe my happiness to him.

279
00:34:07,439 --> 00:34:09,732
I remember living poor in the cottage.

280
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:12,443
Should I show you?

281
00:34:13,153 --> 00:34:14,278
Yes.

282
00:34:17,365 --> 00:34:20,451
Take this. It is my gift for you.

283
00:34:21,453 --> 00:34:22,995
No, I have no use for it.

284
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:25,164
Are you so certain of everything?

285
00:34:37,844 --> 00:34:38,969
It was your mother's.

286
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:42,598
Keep it close to your heart.
It is sure protection against harm.

287
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,813
Are you so certain of everything?

288
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,707
These are strange.
These markings, what are they?

289
00:35:08,792 --> 00:35:10,959
I've had them since I can remember.

290
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:24,306
I used to play by this hearth as a child.

291
00:35:28,269 --> 00:35:30,395
It was my first drawing school,

292
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,356
and my mother was my teacher.

293
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:37,027
Oh, look. See?

294
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:39,822
Carved into the fire back? The archer.

295
00:35:40,949 --> 00:35:42,324
I'd forgotten it.

296
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,537
This was from long before
we lived here.

297
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,334
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

298
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:57,214
A cardinal. My favorite.

299
00:35:57,715 --> 00:36:01,593
I'd love to have a tame one, but
I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

300
00:36:01,886 --> 00:36:05,597
Well, then I have something for you.

301
00:36:08,226 --> 00:36:11,687
Cardinal on one side. An empty cage.

302
00:36:12,564 --> 00:36:13,939
And now...

303
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:19,653
You can do magic. Teach me.

304
00:36:19,737 --> 00:36:24,241
It is no magic. It is what we call optics.

305
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:27,619
Separate pictures
which become one in the spinning.

306
00:36:27,704 --> 00:36:31,331
It is truth,
but truth is not always appearance.

307
00:37:21,799 --> 00:37:23,634
What are you running from,
Magistrate Philipse?

308
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:24,801
Damn you, Crane.

309
00:37:24,886 --> 00:37:26,970
- You had a mind to help me?
- Yes,

310
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:29,806
- and it's put me in mortal dread of...
- Of what?

311
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:32,601
Of powers against which
there is no defense. Come.

312
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:34,811
How did you know the Widow Winship
was expecting a child?

313
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:36,104
She told me.

314
00:37:36,606 --> 00:37:39,608
- Then I deduce you are the father.
- I'm not the father.

315
00:37:39,651 --> 00:37:41,818
Did she tell you
the name of the child's father?

316
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,904
Yes, she did.

317
00:37:43,988 --> 00:37:46,573
She came to me for advice
as town magistrate

318
00:37:46,658 --> 00:37:48,784
to protect the rights of her child.

319
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:51,662
I was bound by my oath of office
to keep the secret, but...

320
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:53,205
Do you believe the father killed her?

321
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:55,791
The Horseman killed her.

322
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,043
How often do I have to tell you?
There is no Horseman.

323
00:37:58,127 --> 00:38:01,171
Never was a Horseman,
and never will be a Horseman.

324
00:38:01,256 --> 00:38:03,006
What is that thing?

325
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:05,592
My talisman.
It protects me from the Horseman.

326
00:38:05,677 --> 00:38:08,804
You, a magistrate,
and your head full of such nonsense.

327
00:38:08,846 --> 00:38:10,681
Now, tell me the name of...

328
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:32,494
Oh, my God.

329
00:39:18,374 --> 00:39:21,418
Constable Crane? Constable Crane?

330
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:23,837
Has he not come out at all?

331
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:32,179
- It was a headless horseman.
- You must not excite yourself.

332
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:33,388
But it was a headless horseman!

333
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,349
Of course it was.
That's why you're here.

334
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:39,061
No, you must believe me. It was
a horseman, a dead one. Headless.

335
00:39:39,103 --> 00:39:40,228
I know. I know.

336
00:39:40,271 --> 00:39:43,899
You don't know because
you were not there! It's all true.

337
00:39:43,941 --> 00:39:46,902
Of course it is. I told you.
Everyone told you.

338
00:39:48,237 --> 00:39:50,447
I saw him.

339
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:58,288
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

340
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:25,041
All right, this time
I'll go to New York myself.

341
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:27,794
I won't be fobbed off
with an amateur deductor.

342
00:41:39,891 --> 00:41:42,184
This time, it's a magistrate
that's dead and...

343
00:41:42,226 --> 00:41:43,477
Gentlemen.

344
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:47,230
I need able men to go with me
into the Western Woods.

345
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:50,609
You? We thought you'd shot your bolt.

346
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:52,777
I have faced my fears,
and come out determined

347
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:54,446
to locate the Horseman's grave.

348
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,116
In short, to pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

349
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:01,703
Who's with me?

350
00:42:04,832 --> 00:42:05,916
Me.

351
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:10,295
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,

352
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:14,090
your father, Jonathan Masbath,
and now Philipse.

353
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:16,468
Something must connect them.

354
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:19,638
Did your father
have dealings with the Van Garretts?

355
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:22,432
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach house.

356
00:42:24,101 --> 00:42:25,310
It's nothing.

357
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,357
But there was something that happened
one night, a week before the murder.

358
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:33,568
An argument upstairs
between father and son.

359
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:36,571
And my father was later sent for
by Mr. Van Garrett.

360
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:41,117
An argument between father and son.

361
00:42:41,953 --> 00:42:45,455
After which the elder Van Garrett sent
for his servant Masbath.

362
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:47,249
Listen.

363
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:50,627
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

364
00:42:51,712 --> 00:42:56,132
No birds. No crickets.
It's all gone so quiet.

365
00:43:04,976 --> 00:43:06,226
Quicken pace.

366
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,360
Pardon our intrusion,

367
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:01,531
- but perhaps you could help us?
- You're from the Hollow.

368
00:44:01,991 --> 00:44:04,784
Yes. In a way, yes.

369
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:12,375
I should like to say that I make
no assumptions about your occupation.

370
00:44:12,418 --> 00:44:16,129
Nor your ways, which, which, which are

371
00:44:16,213 --> 00:44:18,214
nothing to me, whatever you are.

372
00:44:19,133 --> 00:44:20,550
Each to his own.

373
00:44:24,263 --> 00:44:25,388
Oh.

374
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:35,357
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

375
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:40,153
That'll be him, ma'am.

376
00:44:41,405 --> 00:44:43,323
You, come with me.

377
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:46,910
Go out, child. Keep away.

378
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:49,245
Whatever you hear, keep away.

379
00:44:55,961 --> 00:44:58,672
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

380
00:45:04,929 --> 00:45:08,390
He rides. To the Hollow and back.

381
00:45:08,432 --> 00:45:13,019
- I hear him. I smell the blood on him.
- Do you?

382
00:45:14,772 --> 00:45:19,484
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

383
00:45:26,617 --> 00:45:28,451
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld?

384
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:29,744
I can show you.

385
00:45:38,838 --> 00:45:42,465
- What are you doing?
- Do not move or speak.

386
00:45:42,508 --> 00:45:45,051
When the other comes, I will hold him.

387
00:45:45,136 --> 00:45:48,304
- The other?
- Silence. He comes now.

388
00:45:58,441 --> 00:45:59,524
Madam?

389
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:03,987
Madam, do you hear me?

390
00:46:16,542 --> 00:46:20,503
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

391
00:46:20,588 --> 00:46:24,340
Follow the Indian trail
to where the sun dies.

392
00:46:24,425 --> 00:46:26,426
Follow it to the Tree of the Dead.

393
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:30,180
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

394
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:38,688
We're leaving.

395
00:46:38,731 --> 00:46:40,857
- What happened?
- We're leaving now.

396
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,445
We take the Indian trail
to the Tree of the Dead.

397
00:46:45,529 --> 00:46:48,698
- How will we recognize it?
- Without difficulty, I rather fear.

398
00:46:48,783 --> 00:46:51,159
We climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

399
00:46:51,202 --> 00:46:53,203
- His camp?
- His grave.

400
00:47:04,465 --> 00:47:06,049
Stay here.

401
00:47:43,587 --> 00:47:45,839
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed.

402
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:49,384
Katrina?

403
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,970
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

404
00:47:52,054 --> 00:47:54,305
Because no one else would go with you.

405
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,517
Well, then I am now twice the man.

406
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:00,645
It is your white magic.

407
00:48:04,733 --> 00:48:06,234
Pardon my intrusion.

408
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:09,028
I think you'd better come
and look at this.

409
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:53,823
The Tree of the Dead.

410
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:12,258
Blood.

411
00:49:15,137 --> 00:49:18,139
Stay where you are.

412
00:49:57,554 --> 00:50:02,141
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

413
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:21,911
This tree is a gateway.
A gateway between two worlds.

414
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:38,594
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose.

415
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:40,596
Bring the shovel.

416
00:50:58,198 --> 00:51:02,702
The skull is gone. Taken.

417
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:05,955
That is why
the Horseman returns from the grave.

418
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:10,293
To take heads
till his own is restored to him.

419
00:51:28,145 --> 00:51:30,146
Ichabod?

420
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:21,864
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

421
00:52:41,135 --> 00:52:44,387
Don't pick your teeth,
you'll teach Thomas bad habits.

422
00:52:44,471 --> 00:52:48,808
- I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

423
00:53:08,537 --> 00:53:11,914
- Come on, let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

424
00:53:33,687 --> 00:53:36,022
Beth, run!

425
00:53:56,585 --> 00:53:58,586
Stay quiet.

426
00:56:43,418 --> 00:56:47,088
- Wait! He's not after you.
- I'll get him.

427
00:57:07,109 --> 00:57:08,984
We cannot win this.

428
00:58:07,419 --> 00:58:10,045
Remarkable.
A wound like this should've killed him.

429
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:13,382
But it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

430
00:58:15,051 --> 00:58:18,512
You must be still. The fever is on you.

431
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:21,599
Katrina.

432
00:58:22,017 --> 00:58:25,519
Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy,

433
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:28,898
in media nos laudamas.

434
00:58:45,624 --> 00:58:49,460
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but...

435
00:58:50,462 --> 00:58:53,088
Drink this down. It'll make you sleep.

436
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:58,719
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

437
00:58:58,762 --> 00:59:00,429
Later. Rest now.

438
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:04,308
I've discovered something.
The Horseman does not kill at random.

439
00:59:04,643 --> 00:59:07,520
His victims are chosen
by someone who controls him.

440
00:59:07,979 --> 00:59:10,439
By that very person who took his skull.

441
00:59:11,274 --> 00:59:13,025
Someone who knew where to dig.

442
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:16,403
Someone of flesh and blood,
as I've always said.

443
00:59:16,696 --> 00:59:20,032
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

444
00:59:53,733 --> 01:00:11,041
Ichabod.

445
01:00:31,938 --> 01:00:33,731
- You were dreaming.
- Yes.

446
01:00:35,191 --> 01:00:37,318
Things I had forgotten.

447
01:00:40,655 --> 01:00:44,617
- And would not like to remember.
- Tell me what you dreamt.

448
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:48,662
My mother was an innocent.
A child of nature.

449
01:00:50,832 --> 01:00:52,875
Condemned.

450
01:00:53,877 --> 01:00:56,378
Murdered. By my father.

451
01:00:57,213 --> 01:01:00,049
- Murdered by...
- Murdered to save her soul

452
01:01:01,217 --> 01:01:05,387
by a Bible-black tyrant
behind a mask of righteousness.

453
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:10,100
I was seven when I lost my faith.

454
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:14,188
What do you believe in?

455
01:01:14,731 --> 01:01:18,233
Sense and reason.
Cause and consequence.

456
01:01:21,112 --> 01:01:23,405
I should not have come to this place,

457
01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:27,242
where my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

458
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:28,911
Will you take nothing
from Sleepy Hollow

459
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:30,954
that was worth the coming here?

460
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:36,251
No. No, not nothing.

461
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,423
A kiss from a lovely young woman,

462
01:01:42,425 --> 01:01:44,718
before she saw my face
or knew my name.

463
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:48,222
Yes, without sense or reason.

464
01:01:52,018 --> 01:01:55,521
Forgive me, I speak of kisses

465
01:01:56,606 --> 01:01:58,941
and you've lost your brave man, Brom.

466
01:02:00,235 --> 01:02:04,780
I have shed my tears for Brom,
and yet my heart is not broken.

467
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:10,744
- Do you think me wicked?
- No.

468
01:02:12,497 --> 01:02:15,541
But perhaps there is a bit
of a witch in you, Katrina.

469
01:02:16,418 --> 01:02:20,504
- Why do you say that?
- Because you have bewitched me.

470
01:02:33,977 --> 01:02:34,977
Oh.

471
01:02:35,645 --> 01:02:39,314
- You slept like the dead.
- You're too kind to me.

472
01:02:39,858 --> 01:02:42,192
I do not look to be served
by the lady of the house.

473
01:02:42,277 --> 01:02:46,780
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

474
01:02:46,823 --> 01:02:50,784
- Sarah?
- Run away like so many others.

475
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:53,328
They're all leaving in fear.

476
01:02:54,998 --> 01:02:56,790
Where is Katrina?

477
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:01,587
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

478
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:10,512
Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.

479
01:03:12,557 --> 01:03:15,392
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

480
01:03:17,395 --> 01:03:20,773
Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck,

481
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:28,822
Notary Hardenbrook,
and Magistrate Philipse.

482
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,327
Who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

483
01:03:34,245 --> 01:03:37,206
All frightened men,
arguing together on the very night

484
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:39,625
Magistrate Philipse was killed.

485
01:03:41,669 --> 01:03:43,879
There is conspiracy here.

486
01:03:48,134 --> 01:03:51,512
The doctor, the reverend, the notary

487
01:03:52,055 --> 01:03:53,847
and the magistrate.

488
01:03:55,725 --> 01:03:58,352
What is this secret that unites them?

489
01:04:01,689 --> 01:04:04,942
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

490
01:04:06,402 --> 01:04:08,779
He knew the Widow was pregnant.

491
01:04:09,739 --> 01:04:12,282
He would not tell me
the name of the father.

492
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:15,452
What does this point to?

493
01:04:22,836 --> 01:04:25,671
We must proceed
by a process of elimination.

494
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:29,132
I shall make a list of
every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow,

495
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:32,678
starting with its chief citizen,
Baltus Van Tassel.

496
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,683
I feel we're getting very close.

497
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:41,395
Yes, I suppose
Baltus is the chief citizen,

498
01:04:41,437 --> 01:04:43,522
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

499
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:48,527
Yes, the Van Garretts.
I'd almost forgotten them.

500
01:05:00,582 --> 01:05:01,957
Come with me.

501
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:04,376
- Where?
- To Notary Hardenbrook's.

502
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:09,298
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes. I have.

503
01:05:24,606 --> 01:05:26,148
Hopeless.

504
01:05:35,033 --> 01:05:39,328
My father's satchel. Why is it here?

505
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:45,667
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook.

506
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,669
Leave me alone!

507
01:05:47,754 --> 01:05:50,088
Just as soon as you show me
the last will and testament

508
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:51,840
of old man Van Garrett.

509
01:05:52,008 --> 01:05:54,843
The will leaves everything to his son.

510
01:05:54,886 --> 01:05:59,181
Who died with him.
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

511
01:05:59,265 --> 01:06:03,393
- Naturally. All legal and above board.
- Sir.

512
01:06:05,772 --> 01:06:08,565
I'm a dead man. No.

513
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:13,028
Van Garrett's seal. Broken.

514
01:06:15,698 --> 01:06:18,617
Seems Van Garrett
made a new will just before he died.

515
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:23,038
Naming Widow Winship?

516
01:06:23,164 --> 01:06:26,541
And here, look. A marriage certificate.

517
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,546
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the Widow.

518
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:34,591
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

519
01:06:35,593 --> 01:06:38,762
So the new will
stood between the Van Garrett fortune

520
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:41,890
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

521
01:06:41,933 --> 01:06:46,728
It's true. But we four were drawn in
against our will.

522
01:06:47,146 --> 01:06:49,481
- Your will?
- He means...

523
01:06:49,899 --> 01:06:53,360
Of course. The four town elders.

524
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:56,738
Now I see what parts you had to play.

525
01:06:57,991 --> 01:07:01,410
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

526
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:04,246
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

527
01:07:04,664 --> 01:07:07,499
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

528
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:10,419
And Notary Hardenbrook
concealed the documents,

529
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:14,172
which had been entrusted
by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

530
01:07:14,257 --> 01:07:17,092
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

531
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:20,595
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

532
01:07:20,638 --> 01:07:22,681
But I have not finished, sir.

533
01:07:22,932 --> 01:07:26,268
First, the Van Garretts, father and son,
slain by a horseman

534
01:07:26,352 --> 01:07:28,311
raised from the grave to chop heads.

535
01:07:28,396 --> 01:07:32,274
Now, up pops a widow with a claim
on a fortune. Off with her head!

536
01:07:32,942 --> 01:07:35,110
But murder begets murder.

537
01:07:35,737 --> 01:07:38,947
It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath.

538
01:07:39,615 --> 01:07:42,617
The night father and son
quarreled over the new will,

539
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:45,871
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

540
01:07:46,706 --> 01:07:48,457
Here is his signature.

541
01:07:48,499 --> 01:07:51,293
I'm afraid it was his death warrant,
young Masbath.

542
01:07:51,377 --> 01:07:53,712
The Horseman came for him.

543
01:07:54,964 --> 01:07:58,842
Came for him at the bidding of
someone who had power over him.

544
01:07:59,218 --> 01:08:02,429
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull.

545
01:08:02,472 --> 01:08:05,057
The missing head, which must
be restored to the Horseman

546
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:07,059
before he will return to Hell.

547
01:08:07,268 --> 01:08:10,103
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

548
01:08:10,605 --> 01:08:15,567
None other than Van Garrett's
next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel!

549
01:08:21,783 --> 01:08:26,661
- Katrina? Why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

550
01:08:30,374 --> 01:08:34,336
- Was it wicked of me?
- No. No, not at all.

551
01:08:36,214 --> 01:08:38,381
I missed you. Where did you go?

552
01:08:38,466 --> 01:08:41,468
To the notary.
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

553
01:08:41,844 --> 01:08:44,221
And did you learn anything of interest?

554
01:08:46,474 --> 01:08:47,849
Perhaps.

555
01:08:48,643 --> 01:08:50,685
- My father...
- Your father?

556
01:08:50,937 --> 01:08:54,856
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

557
01:08:54,982 --> 01:08:58,193
Really? Why is that?

558
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:00,529
I don't know.

559
01:09:00,863 --> 01:09:04,282
Perhaps he looked in your ledger
and did not like what he saw.

560
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:13,875
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

561
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,211
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

562
01:09:30,726 --> 01:09:35,188
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it!

563
01:09:37,483 --> 01:09:40,068
- There's something under here.
- What is it?

564
01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:45,031
- Help me move the bed.
- No, no, I mustn't. You do it.

565
01:09:51,831 --> 01:09:56,668
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

566
01:09:58,462 --> 01:10:00,255
The evil eye?

567
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:52,933
Wait here.

568
01:12:08,384 --> 01:12:12,721
Katrina, you took the evidence

569
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:13,847
and burned it.

570
01:12:13,889 --> 01:12:16,391
So you would not have it
to accuse my father.

571
01:12:16,475 --> 01:12:18,226
I accuse no one.

572
01:12:18,311 --> 01:12:20,186
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,

573
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:21,771
no matter how much it grieves me.

574
01:12:21,856 --> 01:12:24,399
And no spells of yours
can alter it, either.

575
01:12:24,442 --> 01:12:25,942
Your father has the motive.

576
01:12:26,027 --> 01:12:28,236
It is he who stands to profit
from these murders.

577
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:31,906
If you knew him, you would not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

578
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:34,200
No, nor if you felt anything for me.

579
01:12:34,243 --> 01:12:36,036
I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.

580
01:12:36,078 --> 01:12:38,330
Why else did his four friends
conspire to conceal...

581
01:12:38,414 --> 01:12:40,248
You are the constable, not I.

582
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:42,917
So find another chain of reasoning
and let me be.

583
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,881
I cannot, not the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

584
01:12:48,215 --> 01:12:52,927
I think you have no heart.
And I had a mind once to give you mine.

585
01:12:53,888 --> 01:12:57,557
Yes, I think you loved me that day
when you followed me

586
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:00,602
into the Western Woods
to have braved such peril.

587
01:13:00,686 --> 01:13:01,978
What peril was there for me,

588
01:13:02,063 --> 01:13:05,440
if it was my own father who controlled
the Headless Horseman?

589
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:11,821
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.

590
01:13:11,906 --> 01:13:14,574
I curse the day
you came to Sleepy Hollow.

591
01:13:19,497 --> 01:13:24,084
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

592
01:13:26,504 --> 01:13:28,838
Only that she will not come down.

593
01:13:29,965 --> 01:13:32,050
I see. Thank you.

594
01:13:32,301 --> 01:13:34,135
Constable?

595
01:13:35,554 --> 01:13:39,307
You have not asked me how
I have hurt my hand since yesterday,

596
01:13:40,267 --> 01:13:42,143
which would have been polite.

597
01:13:43,813 --> 01:13:46,147
In fact, you have been as careful

598
01:13:46,524 --> 01:13:50,402
not to look at it as not to mention it.

599
01:13:51,946 --> 01:13:54,531
Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...

600
01:13:54,615 --> 01:13:57,992
- I know you saw me.
- What?

601
01:13:58,744 --> 01:14:01,454
I know you followed last night.

602
01:14:01,872 --> 01:14:05,041
And you must promise
not to tell my husband what you saw.

603
01:14:05,418 --> 01:14:06,835
Promise me!

604
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:09,671
The town is in ferment.

605
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:12,966
Horror piled on tragedy.
Hardenbrook is dead.

606
01:14:13,008 --> 01:14:16,803
- Oh, no! That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

607
01:14:16,846 --> 01:14:18,012
Hanged himself?

608
01:14:18,097 --> 01:14:20,807
Reverend Steenwyck's
called a meeting in the church tonight.

609
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:24,436
Every man, woman, and child
is going to speak out against you.

610
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,355
If you are wise, you will leave this place.

611
01:14:28,941 --> 01:14:32,861
- What is that?
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.

612
01:14:32,903 --> 01:14:34,654
The wound looks angry.

613
01:14:34,697 --> 01:14:38,199
I will bind it later
with wild arrowroot flowers.

614
01:14:38,284 --> 01:14:40,076
I know where some grow.

615
01:14:50,296 --> 01:14:53,590
Come on, hurry up.
The meeting bell started tolling.

616
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:19,407
The Horseman!

617
01:15:20,993 --> 01:15:22,327
- Katrina!
- Father?

618
01:15:22,411 --> 01:15:24,746
The Horseman! Save me!

619
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:29,918
He killed her.
The Horseman killed your stepmother.

620
01:15:38,928 --> 01:15:40,595
Oh, God!

621
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:54,108
Fire!

622
01:16:10,626 --> 01:16:14,587
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants.

623
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:36,943
He cannot enter.

624
01:16:36,986 --> 01:16:38,611
Over here!

625
01:16:46,829 --> 01:16:47,829
The Horseman cannot enter.

626
01:16:47,913 --> 01:16:49,289
Why should we die for you?

627
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:51,666
The Horseman cannot enter.
He cannot cross the gate.

628
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:54,002
We have to save ourselves.

629
01:16:55,212 --> 01:16:58,381
The next person that lays a hand on me
will get a bullet!

630
01:17:00,718 --> 01:17:02,343
He's coming back!

631
01:17:09,518 --> 01:17:12,604
Enough have died already.
It's time to confess our sins.

632
01:17:12,688 --> 01:17:16,065
- What is it that you know?
- Your four friends played you false.

633
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:18,610
We were devilishly possessed
by one who...

634
01:17:27,244 --> 01:17:31,205
Get out of my way!
Stand back! Stay back!

635
01:17:41,508 --> 01:17:44,469
Back! Stand back!

636
01:17:48,974 --> 01:17:52,769
There is a conspiracy here,
and I will shake it out.

637
01:19:08,637 --> 01:19:10,847
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

638
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:15,017
I pray God it is satisfied now,
and that you find peace.

639
01:19:15,102 --> 01:19:16,978
The evil eye's done its work.

640
01:19:17,396 --> 01:19:22,108
My life is over, spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep,

641
01:19:23,152 --> 01:19:25,153
waking each day to grief.

642
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:33,161
Goodbye, Katrina.

643
01:20:11,366 --> 01:20:15,536
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

644
01:20:15,621 --> 01:20:19,040
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

645
01:20:19,124 --> 01:20:21,626
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

646
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:25,004
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- I am beaten down by it!

647
01:20:30,552 --> 01:20:32,053
It is a hard lesson for a hard world,

648
01:20:32,095 --> 01:20:34,263
and you had better learn it,
young Masbath.

649
01:20:34,348 --> 01:20:36,224
Villainy wears many masks.

650
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:39,352
None so dangerous
as the mask of virtue.

651
01:20:47,444 --> 01:20:48,903
Farewell.

652
01:22:18,911 --> 01:22:20,453
- Van Ripper, turn the coach.
- What?

653
01:22:20,495 --> 01:22:22,038
Turn around now!

654
01:22:35,677 --> 01:22:37,178
Pardon my intrusion.

655
01:22:47,898 --> 01:22:51,692
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.

656
01:22:54,613 --> 01:22:58,366
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

657
01:23:08,961 --> 01:23:10,628
Dear stepdaughter,

658
01:23:12,923 --> 01:23:15,091
you look as if you'd seen a ghost.

659
01:23:46,707 --> 01:23:50,418
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.

660
01:23:50,669 --> 01:23:55,589
One more night of beheading.
Rise up with your sword.

661
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:59,593
A head for a head.

662
01:23:59,761 --> 01:24:02,680
My unholy horseman, rise!

663
01:24:03,515 --> 01:24:07,685
Come now for Katrina!

664
01:24:21,033 --> 01:24:22,950
Awake at last.

665
01:24:23,952 --> 01:24:26,871
Did you think it was all a nasty dream?

666
01:24:26,955 --> 01:24:29,040
Father saw the Horseman kill you.

667
01:24:29,458 --> 01:24:33,294
He saw the Horseman come
towards me with his sword unsheathed,

668
01:24:33,712 --> 01:24:37,131
but it is I who govern the Horseman,
my dear.

669
01:24:37,466 --> 01:24:39,967
And Baltus did not stay to watch.

670
01:24:44,473 --> 01:24:47,975
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

671
01:24:48,018 --> 01:24:50,394
And I always thought she was useless.

672
01:24:53,857 --> 01:24:56,692
But it seems
she had a purpose after all.

673
01:25:01,948 --> 01:25:03,699
Who are you?

674
01:25:04,326 --> 01:25:09,205
- My family name was Archer.
- The archer.

675
01:25:16,046 --> 01:25:20,341
I lived with my father and mother
and sister in a cottage not far from here.

676
01:25:20,383 --> 01:25:22,259
Until one day my father died,

677
01:25:22,344 --> 01:25:25,513
and the landlord, who had received
many years of loyal service

678
01:25:25,597 --> 01:25:27,640
from my parents, evicted us.

679
01:25:28,183 --> 01:25:30,851
No one in this God-fearing town
would take us in

680
01:25:30,936 --> 01:25:33,771
because my mother
was suspected of witchcraft.

681
01:25:34,523 --> 01:25:36,398
But she schooled her daughters well,

682
01:25:36,483 --> 01:25:39,652
while we lived as outcasts
in the Western Woods.

683
01:25:40,403 --> 01:25:42,988
She died within a year.

684
01:25:47,911 --> 01:25:52,748
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

685
01:25:53,416 --> 01:25:57,419
Until one day, whilst gathering firewood,

686
01:25:57,504 --> 01:26:00,089
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

687
01:26:05,846 --> 01:26:07,680
I saw his death.

688
01:26:08,223 --> 01:26:12,143
At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan,

689
01:26:12,227 --> 01:26:16,730
if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

690
01:26:21,236 --> 01:26:24,071
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett.

691
01:26:24,281 --> 01:26:27,491
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve,

692
01:26:27,576 --> 01:26:31,412
whilst Baltus Van Tassel
and his simpering wife and girl child

693
01:26:31,454 --> 01:26:32,913
stole our home.

694
01:26:33,081 --> 01:26:36,208
I swore I would make myself
mistress of all he had.

695
01:26:36,251 --> 01:26:38,544
The easiest part was the first.

696
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:41,297
To enter your house
as your mother's sick nurse,

697
01:26:41,381 --> 01:26:45,593
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

698
01:26:46,011 --> 01:26:49,263
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

699
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:52,433
The Widow had to go, of course.

700
01:26:53,143 --> 01:26:54,977
And the servant, Masbath.

701
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:58,606
And then, just the other day,
that silly midwife Killian

702
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,067
told me the Widow had told her
a big secret.

703
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:05,279
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

704
01:27:05,530 --> 01:27:06,780
What a goose!

705
01:27:08,241 --> 01:27:10,534
So, another little job for the Horseman.

706
01:27:13,747 --> 01:27:18,667
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

707
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:23,005
Fear did the same
for the notary, Hardenbrook,

708
01:27:23,089 --> 01:27:24,798
and the drunkard Philipse.

709
01:27:25,258 --> 01:27:27,927
And the doctor's silence I exchanged

710
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:32,973
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl, Sarah.

711
01:27:33,642 --> 01:27:37,228
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No.

712
01:27:37,646 --> 01:27:41,273
You have, my dear, by your father's will.

713
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,944
I get everything
in the event of your death.

714
01:27:46,738 --> 01:27:50,908
My sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

715
01:27:53,703 --> 01:27:55,329
Quite recently.

716
01:27:57,666 --> 01:27:59,708
You killed your own sister?

717
01:27:59,834 --> 01:28:04,338
She brought it on herself
by helping you and your master.

718
01:28:06,675 --> 01:28:09,510
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

719
01:28:09,844 --> 01:28:14,181
The Horseman comes!
And tonight, he comes for you!

720
01:28:20,272 --> 01:28:21,647
Katrina!

721
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,321
Thank God.

722
01:28:38,248 --> 01:28:40,207
Watch your head.

723
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:57,725
To the roof! I have an idea.

724
01:29:57,994 --> 01:29:59,620
Jump for the sails.

725
01:30:14,969 --> 01:30:16,220
Jump!

726
01:30:21,935 --> 01:30:23,018
Hurry!

727
01:30:43,331 --> 01:30:45,749
- Is he dead?
- That's the problem.

728
01:30:45,834 --> 01:30:47,543
He was dead to begin with.

729
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:12,693
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

730
01:31:26,499 --> 01:31:28,041
Here, take the reins.

731
01:31:48,396 --> 01:31:50,022
Ichabod!

732
01:32:45,787 --> 01:32:47,120
My bag!

733
01:33:04,722 --> 01:33:05,889
Jump!

734
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,246
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

735
01:34:12,540 --> 01:34:16,376
Yes, do run, and jump, and skip.

736
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,047
No!

737
01:34:28,765 --> 01:34:31,725
Here! Take her!

738
01:34:32,226 --> 01:34:34,561
She's yours!

739
01:34:37,273 --> 01:34:39,983
Sir, you're not dead.

740
01:35:21,526 --> 01:35:22,859
Horseman!

741
01:38:55,531 --> 01:38:57,824
Just in time for a new century.

742
01:39:10,796 --> 01:39:12,839
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

743
01:39:12,882 --> 01:39:15,258
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,

744
01:39:15,343 --> 01:39:18,343
and home is this way.
