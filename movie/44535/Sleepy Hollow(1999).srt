1
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:08,388
Help here! Lend a hand here! Anyone!

2
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:11,808
Constable Crane?

3
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,727
Ichabod Crane, is that you?

4
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:15,145
None other.

5
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,147
Not only me.

6
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,151
I have found something,
which was lately a man.

7
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,366
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

8
00:04:28,826 --> 00:04:31,453
Just a moment, if I may.
We do not yet know the cause of death.

9
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:35,040
When you find them in the river,
cause of death is drowning.

10
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:36,750
Possibly so,
if there is water in the lungs,

11
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,962
but by pathology we might be able to
determine whether or not he was dead

12
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,254
before he went into the river.

13
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:43,382
I will need to examine the body.

14
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:46,385
Cut him up. Are we heathens?

15
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,304
What happened to him?

16
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,640
Nothing, sir. Arrested for burglary.

17
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:00,774
Good work.

18
00:05:01,943 --> 00:05:04,111
The millennium is almost upon us.

19
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,031
In a few months,
we will be living in the 19th century,

20
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:11,576
yet our courts continue
to rely on medieval devices of torture.

21
00:05:11,619 --> 00:05:12,744
Stand down!

22
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,914
I stand up for sense and justice.

23
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:18,208
Our jails overflow with men and women

24
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,377
convicted on confessions
worth no more than this one.

25
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,795
Constable Crane!

26
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:26,758
This is a song that we have heard
from you more than once.

27
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:30,595
Now, there are two courses open to me.

28
00:05:30,638 --> 00:05:34,599
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells

29
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:37,769
until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office.

30
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:39,396
I beg pardon.

31
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,066
But why am I the only one
who sees that, to solve crimes,

32
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,445
to detect the guilty,
we must use our brains

33
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:51,116
to recognize vital clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

34
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,327
Which brings me to the second course.

35
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:59,041
There is a town upstate,
two days' journey to the north

36
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,043
in the Hudson Highlands.

37
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,880
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

38
00:06:05,757 --> 00:06:07,299
Have you heard of it?

39
00:06:07,717 --> 00:06:08,800
I have not.

40
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:12,554
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

41
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:17,100
Three persons have been
murdered there, all within a fortnight.

42
00:06:17,602 --> 00:06:21,980
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

43
00:06:22,065 --> 00:06:23,482
Lopped off?

44
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,526
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

45
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,781
You will take
these experimentations of yours

46
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,657
to Sleepy Hollow

47
00:06:32,742 --> 00:06:36,453
and there you will detect the murderer.

48
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:40,332
Bring him here to face our good justice.

49
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,085
Will you do this?

50
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:45,629
I shall.

51
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:49,674
Remember, it is you,

52
00:06:49,717 --> 00:06:52,260
Ichabod Crane,

53
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,597
who is now put to the test.

54
00:11:59,777 --> 00:12:02,779
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

55
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,864
"Who's got a kiss for the Pickety Witch?

56
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,283
"The Pickety Witch, the Pickety Witch

57
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,161
"Who's got a kiss
for the Pickety Witch?"

58
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:13,665
Is it Theodore?

59
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:15,834
No, pardon, miss. I am only a stranger.

60
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:17,710
Then have a kiss on account.

61
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:28,513
I'm looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

62
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:31,266
I'm his daughter, Katrina Van Tassel.

63
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,935
And who are you, friend?
We have not heard your name yet.

64
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,438
I've not said it. Excuse me.

65
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,190
- You need some manners.
- Brom.

66
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,484
Come, come.
We'll have no raised voices.

67
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,362
It is only to raise spirits
during this dark time

68
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:48,533
that I and my dear wife
are giving this little party.

69
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:52,537
Young sir, you are most welcome,
even if you are selling something.

70
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,205
Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:57,625
I am Constable Ichabod Crane,
sent to you from New York

72
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,586
to investigate murder in Sleepy Hollow.

73
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,214
Then Sleepy Hollow
is grateful to you, Constable Crane.

74
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,342
And we hope you will honor us
by remaining in this house.

75
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,927
Well spoke, dear.

76
00:13:08,012 --> 00:13:11,139
Come, sir, we'll get you settled. Play on!

77
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:19,564
Excuse me, please.

78
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,237
Thank you.

79
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:29,199
Please tell Mr. Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

80
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,492
I will, sir.

81
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,914
Thank God you're here.

82
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:51,012
Excellent. Come in. Leave us, my dear.

83
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:58,269
We are joined by
Dr. Thomas Lancaster,

84
00:13:58,354 --> 00:13:59,938
Reverend Steenwyck,

85
00:14:00,022 --> 00:14:02,732
our able Magistrate Samuel Philipse,

86
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:03,900
and lastly,

87
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:08,238
this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook,
our notary.

88
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,114
And you, sir?

89
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:13,326
A simple farmer who has prospered.

90
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,788
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

91
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,791
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

92
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,959
Thank you.

93
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,379
So...

94
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,841
Three persons murdered.

95
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:33,346
First, Peter Van Garrett

96
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,975
and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

97
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,272
Both of them strong, capable men,

98
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:44,649
found together

99
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,193
decapitated.

100
00:14:50,197 --> 00:14:52,407
One week later, the Widow Winship.

101
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:56,869
Also decapitated.

102
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:03,501
Now, I will need to ask you
many questions.

103
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:08,006
But first, let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

104
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:15,638
How much have your superiors
explained to you, Constable?

105
00:15:16,557 --> 00:15:21,060
Only that the three
were slain in open ground,

106
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:25,189
their heads found severed
from their bodies.

107
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:28,026
Their heads were not found severed.

108
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,236
Their heads were not found at all.

109
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,326
The heads are gone?

110
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,577
Taken.

111
00:15:37,661 --> 00:15:40,580
Taken by the Headless Horseman.

112
00:15:40,664 --> 00:15:42,540
Taken back to hell.

113
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:45,543
Pardon, I don't...

114
00:15:45,628 --> 00:15:48,212
Perhaps you had better sit down.

115
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:51,883
Yes.

116
00:15:56,263 --> 00:15:59,015
The horseman was
a Hessian mercenary

117
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,809
sent to these shores by German princes

118
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,812
to keep Americans
under the yoke of England.

119
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,941
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money,

120
00:16:09,026 --> 00:16:12,695
the horseman came for love of carnage.

121
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,532
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

122
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,830
He rode a giant black steed
named Daredevil.

123
00:16:25,501 --> 00:16:28,920
He was infamous
for riding his horse hard into battle,

124
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:31,547
chopping off heads at full gallop.

125
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,218
He had filed his teeth
down to sharp points

126
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,929
to add to the ferocity of his appearance.

127
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,982
This butcher didn't finally reach his end

128
00:16:50,401 --> 00:16:52,610
until the winter of '79

129
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:57,782
not far from here in our Western Woods.

130
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,589
They chopped off his head
with his own sword.

131
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,717
Even today,
the Western Woods is a haunted place

132
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:00,011
where brave men will not venture.

133
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:04,932
For what was planted
in the ground that day

134
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:07,977
was a seed of evil.

135
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,524
And so it has been for 20 years.

136
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,110
But now the Hessian wakes.

137
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,156
He's on the rampage,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

138
00:18:25,454 --> 00:18:27,330
Are you saying...

139
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:30,166
Is that what you believe?

140
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,961
Seeing is believing.

141
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:40,384
They tell me that you've brought books
and trappings of scientific investigation.

142
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:44,972
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

143
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,232
I see.

144
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,902
Reverend Steenwyck.

145
00:18:58,654 --> 00:18:59,737
Gentlemen.

146
00:19:01,365 --> 00:19:04,659
Murder needs no ghosts
to come from the grave.

147
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:09,038
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

148
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:11,582
You're a long way
from New York, Constable.

149
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:15,378
The assassin is
a man of flesh and blood

150
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,255
and I will discover him.

151
00:19:58,046 --> 00:19:59,672
Come out, devil.

152
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,684
His name's Gunpowder.

153
00:20:54,603 --> 00:20:56,854
He should do just fine, Mr. Killian.

154
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:58,648
Thank you.

155
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:01,150
Good luck, sir.
If you need help, you call my name.

156
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:02,652
Much appreciated.

157
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,613
Now, don't you worry about a thing.

158
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,823
Everything's going to be just fine.

159
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:12,453
Thomas! Inside!

160
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,040
Run along for your breakfast.

161
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,334
Kiss your mother
once for you and twice for me.

162
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,379
Murder! The horseman's killed again!

163
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:25,925
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.
Come on.

164
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,969
No, no. Come on, the other way.

165
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:29,553
No, no. Turn around.

166
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,519
Good horsy.

167
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,034
- Mr. Miller, ride back for the coffin cart.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,412
The rest of you keep a sharp lookout.

169
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:58,374
It's all right. I'm here now.

170
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,943
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

171
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:30,614
I see.

172
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:33,659
And the head?

173
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,539
Taken.

174
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,543
Interesting. Very interesting.

175
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:43,669
What is?

176
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,548
In headless-corpse cases of this sort,
the head is removed

177
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,425
to prevent identification of the body.

178
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,511
But we know
this was Jonathan Masbath.

179
00:22:52,596 --> 00:22:54,972
Precisely. So why was
the head removed?

180
00:22:55,057 --> 00:22:56,223
- Why?
- Right.

181
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,562
- You have moved the body?
- I did.

182
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,440
- You must never move the body!
- Why not?

183
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:05,858
Because.

184
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:22,833
The stride is gigantic.

185
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:27,588
The attacker rode Masbath down,

186
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,299
turned his horse,

187
00:23:31,635 --> 00:23:33,427
came back.

188
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,429
Came back to claim the head.

189
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,448
Yes.

190
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,493
There's a chemical reaction.

191
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:00,913
It shows there was a powerful,
singular thrust to the neck.

192
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,526
- Interesting.
- What is it?

193
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,613
The wound was cauterized
in the very instant,

194
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,576
as though the blade itself were red hot.

195
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,079
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

196
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,791
The Devil's fire.

197
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:56,135
"Be vigilant,"
as it sayeth in the Book of Peter,

198
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:58,470
chapter five, verse eight.

199
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,098
"Because your adversary the devil,

200
00:25:01,141 --> 00:25:04,393
"as a roaring lion, walketh about,

201
00:25:05,312 --> 00:25:07,521
"seeking whom he may devour."

202
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:11,650
God rest Jonathan Masbath.

203
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:14,653
Amen.

204
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,137
Mr. Constable, sir.

205
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,058
You're young Masbath.

206
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,811
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

207
00:25:47,854 --> 00:25:49,897
Masbath, at your service.

208
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:52,316
In honor bound to avenge my father.

209
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:56,612
Well, one and only Masbath,
I thank you very much,

210
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,531
but your mother will need you
more than I.

211
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,159
My mother is in heaven, sir.

212
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,454
She has my father now to care for her.

213
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:09,917
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

214
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:13,671
Yes, and a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

215
00:26:16,049 --> 00:26:18,550
I'm sorry for your loss,
young Mr. Masbath.

216
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,440
- Constable Crane.
- Mr. Philipse?

217
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,234
Something you should know.

218
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,570
Jonathan Masbath
was not the fourth victim,

219
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,949
- but the fifth.
- The fifth?

220
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:43,158
Aye.

221
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:47,579
Five victims in four graves.

222
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:00,551
Young Masbath.

223
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:03,304
Find a place
in the Van Tassel's servants' quarters.

224
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:04,888
Wake me before dawn.

225
00:27:05,181 --> 00:27:07,266
I hope you have a strong stomach.

226
00:27:09,853 --> 00:27:11,270
Peter Van Garrett.

227
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:13,814
Dirk Van Garrett.

228
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:16,108
Jonathan Masbath.

229
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,696
There are five victims, four graves.

230
00:27:34,794 --> 00:27:37,254
The Widow Winship.

231
00:28:01,905 --> 00:28:03,364
Bring the Widow in.

232
00:28:05,658 --> 00:28:07,951
This is most irregular, Constable.

233
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,829
I should hope so, Doctor,
but in this case, necessary.

234
00:28:10,914 --> 00:28:12,498
We need to operate immediately.

235
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:15,417
Operate? She's dead.

236
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:17,461
When we say "operate,"

237
00:28:17,504 --> 00:28:20,422
we mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

238
00:28:23,927 --> 00:28:27,388
Once more, the neck wound cauterized.

239
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:33,185
The sword thrust to the stomach,
the same.

240
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:34,978
But to what purpose?

241
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:37,439
To what is your purpose
is the question.

242
00:28:37,941 --> 00:28:41,151
What manner of instruments are these?

243
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,820
Some of my own design.

244
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,116
All right, then.
Step outside, young Masbath.

245
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,201
Thank you very, very much
for your help, Mr. Killian.

246
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:51,578
And if you don't mind, Doctor,

247
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:54,957
my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

248
00:29:34,998 --> 00:29:36,248
I am finished.

249
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:39,209
What in the name of God
have you done to her?

250
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:41,753
We are dealing with a madman.

251
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,214
What did you find out, Constable?

252
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,675
The Widow Winship was with child.

253
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,574
Ichabod.

254
00:30:11,868 --> 00:30:15,120
Ichabod. Ichabod.

255
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:17,581
Ichabod.

256
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:33,931
Who's there?

257
00:31:37,912 --> 00:31:47,504
Ichabod.

258
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:11,505
Oh, pardon my intrusion. I saw a light.

259
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,008
It is no intrusion.
I come here to read when I am wakeful.

260
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:23,100
To read books which you must hide?

261
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:25,936
They were my mother's books.
My father believes

262
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,772
tales of romance caused the brain fever
that killed my mother.

263
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:31,108
She died two years ago
come midwinter.

264
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,985
The nurse who cared for her
during her sickness

265
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,696
is now Lady Van Tassel.

266
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:38,949
There was something else, too.

267
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:41,159
Why did no one think to mention that

268
00:33:41,244 --> 00:33:44,246
the Van Garretts are kith and kin
to the Van Tassels?

269
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,832
Why, because there is hardly
a household in Sleepy Hollow

270
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:50,127
that is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

271
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,461
I see.

272
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,177
This land we're looking at
was Van Garrett land,

273
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:02,013
given to my father
when I was in swaddling clothes.

274
00:34:02,098 --> 00:34:04,599
The Van Garretts were
the richest family around these parts.

275
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:06,768
When my father brought us
to Sleepy Hollow,

276
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:09,730
Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

277
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,900
My father worked hard for his family,
and prospered and built this house.

278
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,986
And I owe my happiness to him.

279
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:19,448
I remember living poor in the cottage.

280
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,159
Should I show you?

281
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:23,994
Yes.

282
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:30,167
Take this. It is my gift for you.

283
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,711
No, I have no use for it.

284
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:34,880
Are you so certain of everything?

285
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,685
It was your mother's.

286
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,314
Keep it close to your heart.
It is sure protection against harm.

287
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:59,529
Are you so certain of everything?

288
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:18,423
These are strange.
These markings, what are they?

289
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,675
I've had them since I can remember.

290
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:34,022
I used to play by this hearth as a child.

291
00:35:37,985 --> 00:35:40,111
It was my first drawing school,

292
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:42,072
and my mother was my teacher.

293
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,743
Oh, look. See?

294
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:49,538
Carved into the fire back? The archer.

295
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,040
I'd forgotten it.

296
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:56,253
This was from long before
we lived here.

297
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:02,050
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

298
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:06,930
A cardinal. My favorite.

299
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,309
I'd love to have a tame one, but
I wouldn't have the heart to cage him.

300
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:15,313
Well, then I have something for you.

301
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,403
Cardinal on one side. An empty cage.

302
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,655
And now...

303
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:29,369
You can do magic. Teach me.

304
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:33,957
It is no magic. It is what we call optics.

305
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,335
Separate pictures
which become one in the spinning.

306
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,047
It is truth,
but truth is not always appearance.

307
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:33,350
What are you running from,
Magistrate Philipse?

308
00:37:33,434 --> 00:37:34,517
Damn you, Crane.

309
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,686
- You had a mind to help me?
- Yes,

310
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:39,522
- and it's put me in mortal dread of...
- Of what?

311
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:42,317
Of powers against which
there is no defense. Come.

312
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,527
How did you know the Widow Winship
was expecting a child?

313
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:45,820
She told me.

314
00:37:46,322 --> 00:37:49,324
- Then I deduce you are the father.
- I'm not the father.

315
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,534
Did she tell you
the name of the child's father?

316
00:37:51,577 --> 00:37:53,620
Yes, she did.

317
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,289
She came to me for advice
as town magistrate

318
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:58,500
to protect the rights of her child.

319
00:37:58,542 --> 00:38:01,378
I was bound by my oath of office
to keep the secret, but...

320
00:38:01,462 --> 00:38:02,921
Do you believe the father killed her?

321
00:38:03,005 --> 00:38:05,507
The Horseman killed her.

322
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,759
How often do I have to tell you?
There is no Horseman.

323
00:38:07,843 --> 00:38:10,887
Never was a Horseman,
and never will be a Horseman.

324
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:12,722
What is that thing?

325
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:15,308
My talisman.
It protects me from the Horseman.

326
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,520
You, a magistrate,
and your head full of such nonsense.

327
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:20,397
Now, tell me the name of...

328
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,210
Oh, my God.

329
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:31,134
Constable Crane? Constable Crane?

330
00:39:31,761 --> 00:39:33,553
Has he not come out at all?

331
00:39:39,435 --> 00:39:41,895
- It was a headless horseman.
- You must not excite yourself.

332
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,104
But it was a headless horseman!

333
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:45,065
Of course it was.
That's why you're here.

334
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,777
No, you must believe me. It was
a horseman, a dead one. Headless.

335
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:49,944
I know. I know.

336
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:53,615
You don't know because
you were not there! It's all true.

337
00:39:53,657 --> 00:39:56,618
Of course it is. I told you.
Everyone told you.

338
00:39:57,953 --> 00:40:00,163
I saw him.

339
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,004
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

340
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:34,757
All right, this time
I'll go to New York myself.

341
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,510
I won't be fobbed off
with an amateur deductor.

342
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,900
This time, it's a magistrate
that's dead and...

343
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,193
Gentlemen.

344
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:56,946
I need able men to go with me
into the Western Woods.

345
00:41:57,031 --> 00:42:00,325
You? We thought you'd shot your bolt.

346
00:42:00,409 --> 00:42:02,493
I have faced my fears,
and come out determined

347
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:04,162
to locate the Horseman's grave.

348
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:07,832
In short, to pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

349
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,419
Who's with me?

350
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:15,632
Me.

351
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:20,011
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,

352
00:42:20,095 --> 00:42:23,806
your father, Jonathan Masbath,
and now Philipse.

353
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,184
Something must connect them.

354
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,354
Did your father
have dealings with the Van Garretts?

355
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:32,148
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach house.

356
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,026
It's nothing.

357
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:40,073
But there was something that happened
one night, a week before the murder.

358
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,284
An argument upstairs
between father and son.

359
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,287
And my father was later sent for
by Mr. Van Garrett.

360
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,833
An argument between father and son.

361
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:55,171
After which the elder Van Garrett sent
for his servant Masbath.

362
00:42:55,798 --> 00:42:56,965
Listen.

363
00:42:58,717 --> 00:43:00,343
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

364
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:05,848
No birds. No crickets.
It's all gone so quiet.

365
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,942
Quicken pace.

366
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,076
Pardon our intrusion,

367
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,247
- but perhaps you could help us?
- You're from the Hollow.

368
00:44:11,707 --> 00:44:14,500
Yes. In a way, yes.

369
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:22,091
I should like to say that I make
no assumptions about your occupation.

370
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:25,845
Nor your ways, which, which, which are

371
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,930
nothing to me, whatever you are.

372
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:30,266
Each to his own.

373
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:35,104
Oh.

374
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:45,073
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

375
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,869
That'll be him, ma'am.

376
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,039
You, come with me.

377
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:56,626
Go out, child. Keep away.

378
00:44:56,668 --> 00:44:58,961
Whatever you hear, keep away.

379
00:45:05,677 --> 00:45:08,388
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

380
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:18,106
He rides. To the Hollow and back.

381
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:22,735
- I hear him. I smell the blood on him.
- Do you?

382
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:29,200
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

383
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,167
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld?

384
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,460
I can show you.

385
00:45:48,554 --> 00:45:52,181
- What are you doing?
- Do not move or speak.

386
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:54,767
When the other comes, I will hold him.

387
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:58,020
- The other?
- Silence. He comes now.

388
00:46:08,157 --> 00:46:09,240
Madam?

389
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:13,703
Madam, do you hear me?

390
00:46:26,258 --> 00:46:30,219
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

391
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:34,056
Follow the Indian trail
to where the sun dies.

392
00:46:34,141 --> 00:46:36,142
Follow it to the Tree of the Dead.

393
00:46:36,226 --> 00:46:39,896
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

394
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:48,404
We're leaving.

395
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:50,573
- What happened?
- We're leaving now.

396
00:46:52,826 --> 00:46:55,161
We take the Indian trail
to the Tree of the Dead.

397
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:58,414
- How will we recognize it?
- Without difficulty, I rather fear.

398
00:46:58,499 --> 00:47:00,875
We climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

399
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,919
- His camp?
- His grave.

400
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:15,765
Stay here.

401
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,555
Halt and turn, I have a pistol aimed.

402
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,100
Katrina?

403
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,686
I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

404
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,021
Because no one else would go with you.

405
00:48:05,107 --> 00:48:07,233
Well, then I am now twice the man.

406
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:10,361
It is your white magic.

407
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:15,950
Pardon my intrusion.

408
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,744
I think you'd better come
and look at this.

409
00:49:01,288 --> 00:49:03,539
The Tree of the Dead.

410
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:21,974
Blood.

411
00:49:24,853 --> 00:49:27,855
Stay where you are.

412
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,857
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

413
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:31,627
This tree is a gateway.
A gateway between two worlds.

414
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:48,310
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose.

415
00:50:48,395 --> 00:50:50,312
Bring the shovel.

416
00:51:07,914 --> 00:51:12,418
The skull is gone. Taken.

417
00:51:12,961 --> 00:51:15,671
That is why
the Horseman returns from the grave.

418
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,009
To take heads
till his own is restored to him.

419
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,862
Ichabod?

420
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:31,580
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

421
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:54,103
Don't pick your teeth,
you'll teach Thomas bad habits.

422
00:52:54,187 --> 00:52:58,524
- I am a bad habit. There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

423
00:53:18,253 --> 00:53:21,630
- Come on, let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

424
00:53:43,403 --> 00:53:45,738
Beth, run!

425
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:08,302
Stay quiet.

426
00:56:53,134 --> 00:56:56,804
- Wait! He's not after you.
- I'll get him.

427
00:57:16,825 --> 00:57:18,700
We cannot win this.

428
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:19,761
Remarkable.
A wound like this should've killed him.

429
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:23,098
But it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

430
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,228
You must be still. The fever is on you.

431
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:31,315
Katrina.

432
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:35,235
Nostradamus mediamus, milk of mercy,

433
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,614
in media nos laudamas.

434
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:59,176
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom, but...

435
00:59:00,178 --> 00:59:02,804
Drink this down. It'll make you sleep.

436
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:08,435
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

437
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,145
Later. Rest now.

438
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:14,024
I've discovered something.
The Horseman does not kill at random.

439
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:17,236
His victims are chosen
by someone who controls him.

440
00:59:17,695 --> 00:59:20,155
By that very person who took his skull.

441
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:22,741
Someone who knew where to dig.

442
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:26,119
Someone of flesh and blood,
as I've always said.

443
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:29,748
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

444
01:00:03,449 --> 01:00:20,757
Ichabod.

445
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:43,447
- You were dreaming.
- Yes.

446
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:47,034
Things I had forgotten.

447
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:54,333
- And would not like to remember.
- Tell me what you dreamt.

448
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,378
My mother was an innocent.
A child of nature.

449
01:01:00,548 --> 01:01:02,591
Condemned.

450
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,094
Murdered. By my father.

451
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:09,765
- Murdered by...
- Murdered to save her soul

452
01:01:10,933 --> 01:01:15,103
by a Bible-black tyrant
behind a mask of righteousness.

453
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:19,816
I was seven when I lost my faith.

454
01:01:22,153 --> 01:01:23,904
What do you believe in?

455
01:01:24,447 --> 01:01:27,949
Sense and reason.
Cause and consequence.

456
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:33,121
I should not have come to this place,

457
01:01:33,414 --> 01:01:36,958
where my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

458
01:01:37,001 --> 01:01:38,627
Will you take nothing
from Sleepy Hollow

459
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:40,670
that was worth the coming here?

460
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,967
No. No, not nothing.

461
01:01:48,596 --> 01:01:51,139
A kiss from a lovely young woman,

462
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:54,434
before she saw my face
or knew my name.

463
01:01:54,727 --> 01:01:57,938
Yes, without sense or reason.

464
01:02:01,734 --> 01:02:05,237
Forgive me, I speak of kisses

465
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,657
and you've lost your brave man, Brom.

466
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:14,496
I have shed my tears for Brom,
and yet my heart is not broken.

467
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:20,460
- Do you think me wicked?
- No.

468
01:02:22,213 --> 01:02:25,257
But perhaps there is a bit
of a witch in you, Katrina.

469
01:02:26,134 --> 01:02:30,220
- Why do you say that?
- Because you have bewitched me.

470
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,693
Oh.

471
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:49,030
- You slept like the dead.
- You're too kind to me.

472
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,908
I do not look to be served
by the lady of the house.

473
01:02:51,993 --> 01:02:56,496
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

474
01:02:56,539 --> 01:03:00,500
- Sarah?
- Run away like so many others.

475
01:03:01,085 --> 01:03:03,044
They're all leaving in fear.

476
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,506
Where is Katrina?

477
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:11,303
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

478
01:03:17,268 --> 01:03:20,228
Well, I'm fit for another day, I think.

479
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:25,108
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

480
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:30,489
Doctor Lancaster, Reverend Steenwyck,

481
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:38,538
Notary Hardenbrook,
and Magistrate Philipse.

482
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,043
Who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

483
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,922
All frightened men,
arguing together on the very night

484
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:49,341
Magistrate Philipse was killed.

485
01:03:51,385 --> 01:03:53,595
There is conspiracy here.

486
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:01,228
The doctor, the reverend, the notary

487
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:03,563
and the magistrate.

488
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,068
What is this secret that unites them?

489
01:04:11,405 --> 01:04:14,658
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

490
01:04:16,118 --> 01:04:18,495
He knew the Widow was pregnant.

491
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:21,998
He would not tell me
the name of the father.

492
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:25,168
What does this point to?

493
01:04:32,552 --> 01:04:35,387
We must proceed
by a process of elimination.

494
01:04:35,846 --> 01:04:38,848
I shall make a list of
every man and woman in Sleepy Hollow,

495
01:04:38,933 --> 01:04:42,394
starting with its chief citizen,
Baltus Van Tassel.

496
01:04:45,356 --> 01:04:47,399
I feel we're getting very close.

497
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:51,111
Yes, I suppose
Baltus is the chief citizen,

498
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:53,238
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

499
01:04:53,406 --> 01:04:58,243
Yes, the Van Garretts.
I'd almost forgotten them.

500
01:05:10,298 --> 01:05:11,673
Come with me.

501
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:14,092
- Where?
- To Notary Hardenbrook's.

502
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:19,014
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes. I have.

503
01:05:34,322 --> 01:05:35,864
Hopeless.

504
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:49,044
My father's satchel. Why is it here?

505
01:05:53,549 --> 01:05:55,383
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook.

506
01:05:55,426 --> 01:05:57,385
Leave me alone!

507
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,804
Just as soon as you show me
the last will and testament

508
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,556
of old man Van Garrett.

509
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,559
The will leaves everything to his son.

510
01:06:04,602 --> 01:06:08,897
Who died with him.
So the estate passes to the next of kin.

511
01:06:08,981 --> 01:06:13,109
- Naturally. All legal and above board.
- Sir.

512
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:18,281
I'm a dead man. No.

513
01:06:19,784 --> 01:06:22,744
Van Garrett's seal. Broken.

514
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:28,333
Seems Van Garrett
made a new will just before he died.

515
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:32,754
Naming Widow Winship?

516
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,257
And here, look. A marriage certificate.

517
01:06:38,886 --> 01:06:41,262
Old Van Garrett
secretly married the Widow.

518
01:06:41,305 --> 01:06:44,307
Left everything to her
and her unborn child.

519
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:48,478
So the new will
stood between the Van Garrett fortune

520
01:06:48,562 --> 01:06:51,606
and the person who would have
otherwise inherited everything.

521
01:06:51,649 --> 01:06:56,444
It's true. But we four were drawn in
against our will.

522
01:06:56,862 --> 01:06:59,197
- Your will?
- He means...

523
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:03,076
Of course. The four town elders.

524
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,454
Now I see what parts you had to play.

525
01:07:07,707 --> 01:07:11,126
Reverend Steenwyck knew the secret
because he performed the marriage.

526
01:07:11,168 --> 01:07:13,962
Dr. Lancaster attended
the pregnant woman.

527
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:17,215
Magistrate Philipse
gave protection of the law.

528
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:20,135
And Notary Hardenbrook
concealed the documents,

529
01:07:20,511 --> 01:07:23,888
which had been entrusted
by Van Garrett to his faithful servant.

530
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,808
The four conspirators
drawn into the plot.

531
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:30,311
We did not know
it was a murdering plot.

532
01:07:30,354 --> 01:07:32,397
But I have not finished, sir.

533
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:35,984
First, the Van Garretts, father and son,
slain by a horseman

534
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:38,027
raised from the grave to chop heads.

535
01:07:38,112 --> 01:07:41,990
Now, up pops a widow with a claim
on a fortune. Off with her head!

536
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,826
But murder begets murder.

537
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:48,663
It was the servant, Jonathan Masbath.

538
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:52,333
The night father and son
quarreled over the new will,

539
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:55,587
Jonathan Masbath was summoned
upstairs to bear witness.

540
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:58,173
Here is his signature.

541
01:07:58,215 --> 01:08:01,009
I'm afraid it was his death warrant,
young Masbath.

542
01:08:01,093 --> 01:08:03,428
The Horseman came for him.

543
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:08,558
Came for him at the bidding of
someone who had power over him.

544
01:08:08,934 --> 01:08:12,145
Someone who dug in the earth in
the Western Woods and stole the skull.

545
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:14,773
The missing head, which must
be restored to the Horseman

546
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:16,775
before he will return to Hell.

547
01:08:16,984 --> 01:08:19,819
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune.

548
01:08:20,321 --> 01:08:25,283
None other than Van Garrett's
next of kin, Baltus Van Tassel!

549
01:08:31,499 --> 01:08:36,377
- Katrina? Why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

550
01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:44,052
- Was it wicked of me?
- No. No, not at all.

551
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:48,097
I missed you. Where did you go?

552
01:08:48,182 --> 01:08:51,184
To the notary.
I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

553
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,937
And did you learn anything of interest?

554
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,565
Perhaps.

555
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:00,401
- My father...
- Your father?

556
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:04,572
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

557
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:07,909
Really? Why is that?

558
01:09:08,536 --> 01:09:10,245
I don't know.

559
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:13,998
Perhaps he looked in your ledger
and did not like what he saw.

560
01:09:19,547 --> 01:09:23,591
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

561
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:25,927
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

562
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:44,904
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it! Kill it! No, no, stomp it!

563
01:09:47,199 --> 01:09:49,784
- There's something under here.
- What is it?

564
01:09:51,745 --> 01:09:54,747
- Help me move the bed.
- No, no, I mustn't. You do it.

565
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:06,384
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

566
01:10:08,178 --> 01:10:09,971
The evil eye?

567
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:02,649
Wait here.

568
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:22,437
Katrina, you took the evidence

569
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:23,563
and burned it.

570
01:12:23,605 --> 01:12:26,107
So you would not have it
to accuse my father.

571
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:27,942
I accuse no one.

572
01:12:28,027 --> 01:12:29,902
But if there is guilt, I cannot alter it,

573
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:31,487
no matter how much it grieves me.

574
01:12:31,572 --> 01:12:34,115
And no spells of yours
can alter it, either.

575
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:35,658
Your father has the motive.

576
01:12:35,743 --> 01:12:37,952
It is he who stands to profit
from these murders.

577
01:12:37,995 --> 01:12:41,622
If you knew him, you would not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

578
01:12:41,874 --> 01:12:43,916
No, nor if you felt anything for me.

579
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:45,752
I am pinioned by a chain of reasoning.

580
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:48,046
Why else did his four friends
conspire to conceal...

581
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,964
You are the constable, not I.

582
01:12:50,007 --> 01:12:52,633
So find another chain of reasoning
and let me be.

583
01:12:52,676 --> 01:12:57,597
I cannot, not the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

584
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:02,643
I think you have no heart.
And I had a mind once to give you mine.

585
01:13:03,604 --> 01:13:07,273
Yes, I think you loved me that day
when you followed me

586
01:13:07,316 --> 01:13:10,318
into the Western Woods
to have braved such peril.

587
01:13:10,402 --> 01:13:11,694
What peril was there for me,

588
01:13:11,779 --> 01:13:15,156
if it was my own father who controlled
the Headless Horseman?

589
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:21,537
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane.

590
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:24,290
I curse the day
you came to Sleepy Hollow.

591
01:13:29,213 --> 01:13:33,800
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

592
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,554
Only that she will not come down.

593
01:13:39,681 --> 01:13:41,766
I see. Thank you.

594
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,851
Constable?

595
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:49,023
You have not asked me how
I have hurt my hand since yesterday,

596
01:13:49,983 --> 01:13:51,859
which would have been polite.

597
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,863
In fact, you have been as careful

598
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,118
not to look at it as not to mention it.

599
01:14:01,662 --> 01:14:04,247
Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...

600
01:14:04,331 --> 01:14:07,708
- I know you saw me.
- What?

601
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,170
I know you followed last night.

602
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:14,757
And you must promise
not to tell my husband what you saw.

603
01:14:15,134 --> 01:14:16,551
Promise me!

604
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:19,387
The town is in ferment.

605
01:14:19,596 --> 01:14:22,682
Horror piled on tragedy.
Hardenbrook is dead.

606
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:26,519
- Oh, no! That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

607
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:27,728
Hanged himself?

608
01:14:27,813 --> 01:14:30,523
Reverend Steenwyck's
called a meeting in the church tonight.

609
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:34,152
Every man, woman, and child
is going to speak out against you.

610
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:37,071
If you are wise, you will leave this place.

611
01:14:38,657 --> 01:14:42,577
- What is that?
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.

612
01:14:42,619 --> 01:14:44,370
The wound looks angry.

613
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:47,915
I will bind it later
with wild arrowroot flowers.

614
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,792
I know where some grow.

615
01:15:00,012 --> 01:15:03,306
Come on, hurry up.
The meeting bell started tolling.

616
01:15:27,706 --> 01:15:29,123
The Horseman!

617
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:32,043
- Katrina!
- Father?

618
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:34,462
The Horseman! Save me!

619
01:15:36,256 --> 01:15:39,634
He killed her.
The Horseman killed your stepmother.

620
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,311
Oh, God!

621
01:16:01,865 --> 01:16:03,824
Fire!

622
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:24,303
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants.

623
01:16:44,866 --> 01:16:46,659
He cannot enter.

624
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,327
Over here!

625
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:57,545
The Horseman cannot enter.

626
01:16:57,629 --> 01:16:59,005
Why should we die for you?

627
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,382
The Horseman cannot enter.
He cannot cross the gate.

628
01:17:01,466 --> 01:17:03,718
We have to save ourselves.

629
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:08,097
The next person that lays a hand on me
will get a bullet!

630
01:17:10,434 --> 01:17:12,059
He's coming back!

631
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:22,320
Enough have died already.
It's time to confess our sins.

632
01:17:22,404 --> 01:17:25,781
- What is it that you know?
- Your four friends played you false.

633
01:17:25,866 --> 01:17:28,326
We were devilishly possessed
by one who...

634
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,921
Get out of my way!
Stand back! Stay back!

635
01:17:51,224 --> 01:17:54,185
Back! Stand back!

636
01:17:58,690 --> 01:18:02,485
There is a conspiracy here,
and I will shake it out.

637
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,563
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

638
01:19:21,606 --> 01:19:24,733
I pray God it is satisfied now,
and that you find peace.

639
01:19:24,818 --> 01:19:26,694
The evil eye's done its work.

640
01:19:27,112 --> 01:19:31,824
My life is over, spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep,

641
01:19:32,868 --> 01:19:34,869
waking each day to grief.

642
01:19:41,376 --> 01:19:42,877
Goodbye, Katrina.

643
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:25,252
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

644
01:20:25,337 --> 01:20:28,756
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

645
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,342
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

646
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:34,720
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- I am beaten down by it!

647
01:20:40,268 --> 01:20:41,769
It is a hard lesson for a hard world,

648
01:20:41,811 --> 01:20:43,979
and you had better learn it,
young Masbath.

649
01:20:44,064 --> 01:20:45,940
Villainy wears many masks.

650
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:49,068
None so dangerous
as the mask of virtue.

651
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,619
Farewell.

652
01:22:28,627 --> 01:22:30,169
- Van Ripper, turn the coach.
- What?

653
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,754
Turn around now!

654
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:46,894
Pardon my intrusion.

655
01:22:57,614 --> 01:23:01,408
No blood flow, no clotting, no healing.

656
01:23:04,329 --> 01:23:08,082
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

657
01:23:18,677 --> 01:23:20,344
Dear stepdaughter,

658
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,807
you look as if you'd seen a ghost.

659
01:23:56,423 --> 01:24:00,134
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.

660
01:24:00,385 --> 01:24:05,305
One more night of beheading.
Rise up with your sword.

661
01:24:05,724 --> 01:24:09,309
A head for a head.

662
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:12,396
My unholy horseman, rise!

663
01:24:13,231 --> 01:24:17,401
Come now for Katrina!

664
01:24:30,749 --> 01:24:32,666
Awake at last.

665
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:36,587
Did you think it was all a nasty dream?

666
01:24:36,671 --> 01:24:38,756
Father saw the Horseman kill you.

667
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:43,010
He saw the Horseman come
towards me with his sword unsheathed,

668
01:24:43,428 --> 01:24:46,847
but it is I who govern the Horseman,
my dear.

669
01:24:47,182 --> 01:24:49,683
And Baltus did not stay to watch.

670
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:57,691
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

671
01:24:57,734 --> 01:25:00,110
And I always thought she was useless.

672
01:25:03,573 --> 01:25:06,408
But it seems
she had a purpose after all.

673
01:25:11,664 --> 01:25:13,415
Who are you?

674
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:18,921
- My family name was Archer.
- The archer.

675
01:25:25,762 --> 01:25:30,057
I lived with my father and mother
and sister in a cottage not far from here.

676
01:25:30,099 --> 01:25:31,975
Until one day my father died,

677
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,229
and the landlord, who had received
many years of loyal service

678
01:25:35,313 --> 01:25:37,356
from my parents, evicted us.

679
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:40,567
No one in this God-fearing town
would take us in

680
01:25:40,652 --> 01:25:43,487
because my mother
was suspected of witchcraft.

681
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,114
But she schooled her daughters well,

682
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:49,368
while we lived as outcasts
in the Western Woods.

683
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,704
She died within a year.

684
01:25:57,627 --> 01:26:02,464
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

685
01:26:03,132 --> 01:26:07,135
Until one day, whilst gathering firewood,

686
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:09,805
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

687
01:26:15,562 --> 01:26:17,396
I saw his death.

688
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:21,859
At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan,

689
01:26:21,943 --> 01:26:26,446
if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

690
01:26:30,952 --> 01:26:33,787
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett.

691
01:26:33,997 --> 01:26:37,207
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve,

692
01:26:37,292 --> 01:26:41,128
whilst Baltus Van Tassel
and his simpering wife and girl child

693
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,629
stole our home.

694
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:45,924
I swore I would make myself
mistress of all he had.

695
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:48,260
The easiest part was the first.

696
01:26:48,344 --> 01:26:51,013
To enter your house
as your mother's sick nurse,

697
01:26:51,097 --> 01:26:55,309
and put her body into the grave
and my own into the marriage bed.

698
01:26:55,727 --> 01:26:58,979
Not quite so easy
was to secure my legacy.

699
01:26:59,606 --> 01:27:02,149
The Widow had to go, of course.

700
01:27:02,859 --> 01:27:04,693
And the servant, Masbath.

701
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:08,322
And then, just the other day,
that silly midwife Killian

702
01:27:08,406 --> 01:27:11,783
told me the Widow had told her
a big secret.

703
01:27:11,826 --> 01:27:14,995
And she told me this
right in front of her husband.

704
01:27:15,246 --> 01:27:16,496
What a goose!

705
01:27:17,957 --> 01:27:20,250
So, another little job for the Horseman.

706
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:28,383
But lust delivered
the Reverend Steenwyck into my power.

707
01:27:30,136 --> 01:27:32,721
Fear did the same
for the notary, Hardenbrook,

708
01:27:32,805 --> 01:27:34,514
and the drunkard Philipse.

709
01:27:34,974 --> 01:27:37,643
And the doctor's silence I exchanged

710
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:42,689
for my complicity in his fornications
with the servant girl, Sarah.

711
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:46,944
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No.

712
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:50,989
You have, my dear, by your father's will.

713
01:27:51,616 --> 01:27:54,660
I get everything
in the event of your death.

714
01:27:56,454 --> 01:28:00,624
My sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

715
01:28:03,419 --> 01:28:05,045
Quite recently.

716
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:09,424
You killed your own sister?

717
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:14,054
She brought it on herself
by helping you and your master.

718
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,226
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

719
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,897
The Horseman comes!
And tonight, he comes for you!

720
01:28:29,988 --> 01:28:31,363
Katrina!

721
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,037
Thank God.

722
01:28:47,964 --> 01:28:49,923
Watch your head.

723
01:29:05,606 --> 01:29:07,441
To the roof! I have an idea.

724
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,336
Jump for the sails.

725
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:25,936
Jump!

726
01:30:31,651 --> 01:30:32,734
Hurry!

727
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:55,465
- Is he dead?
- That's the problem.

728
01:30:55,550 --> 01:30:57,259
He was dead to begin with.

729
01:31:20,616 --> 01:31:22,409
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

730
01:31:36,215 --> 01:31:37,757
Here, take the reins.

731
01:31:58,112 --> 01:31:59,738
Ichabod!

732
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:56,836
My bag!

733
01:33:14,438 --> 01:33:15,605
Jump!

734
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:20,962
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

735
01:34:22,256 --> 01:34:26,092
Yes, do run, and jump, and skip.

736
01:34:28,596 --> 01:34:29,763
No!

737
01:34:38,481 --> 01:34:41,441
Here! Take her!

738
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:44,277
She's yours!

739
01:34:46,989 --> 01:34:49,699
Sir, you're not dead.

740
01:35:31,242 --> 01:35:32,575
Horseman!

741
01:39:05,247 --> 01:39:07,540
Just in time for a new century.

742
01:39:20,512 --> 01:39:22,555
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

743
01:39:22,598 --> 01:39:24,974
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,

744
01:39:25,059 --> 01:39:28,059
and home is this way.
