Enjoy the Movie.

1
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,470
Help here!
Lend a hand! Anyone!

2
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,600
- Constable Crane? Is that you?
- None other.

3
00:04:12,888 --> 00:04:18,188
Not only me. I found something
which was lately a man.

4
00:04:22,068 --> 00:04:25,438
- Burn it.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:31,368
- We do not know the cause of death.
- If found in the river, it is drowning.

6
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:38,077
We might determine whether he was
dead before he went into the river.

7
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:42,998
- I will need to examine the body.
- Cut him up? Are we heathens?

8
00:04:45,298 --> 00:04:49,928
- What happened to him?
- Arrested for burglary.

9
00:04:56,558 --> 00:04:58,137
Good work.

10
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:01,147
The millennium is almost upon us.

11
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,266
In a few months, we will be living
in the 19th century.

12
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:08,317
Yet our courts rely
on medieval methods of torture.

13
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:12,526
- Stand down.
- I stand up, for sense and justice.

14
00:05:13,026 --> 00:05:16,946
Ourjails overflow with men convicted
on confessions worth no more...

15
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:23,247
Constable Crane! This is a song we
have heard from you more than once.

16
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:27,456
There are two courses open to me.

17
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:31,386
First, I can let you cool your heels
in the cells, -

18
00:05:31,506 --> 00:05:34,506
- until you learn respect
for the dignity of my office...

19
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:41,728
Why am I the only one who sees
that to solve crimes, detect the guilty, -

20
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:48,025
- we must use our brains to find clues,
using up-to-date scientific techniques?

21
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:52,025
Which brings me to the second course.

22
00:05:52,157 --> 00:05:57,695
There is a town upstate, two days
to the north, in the Hudson Highlands.

23
00:05:57,996 --> 00:06:02,416
It is a place called Sleepy Hollow.

24
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:05,585
- Have you heard of it?
- I have not.

25
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:09,005
An isolated farming community,
mainly Dutch.

26
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:14,296
Three persons have been murdered,
all within a fortnight.

27
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:20,097
Each one found
with the head lopped off.

28
00:06:20,227 --> 00:06:24,395
Clean as dandelion heads, apparently.

29
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:29,644
You will take your experimentations
to Sleepy Hollow, -

30
00:06:29,774 --> 00:06:33,315
- and there you will detect
the murderer.

31
00:06:33,485 --> 00:06:38,536
Bring him here to face our good justice.

32
00:06:38,694 --> 00:06:42,574
- Will you do this?
- I shall.

33
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:48,375
Remember,
it is you, Ichabod Crane, -

34
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:53,295
- who is now put to the test.

35
00:11:56,887 --> 00:12:01,808
The pickety witch, the pickety witch,
who's going to kiss the pickety witch?

36
00:12:09,017 --> 00:12:12,608
- Is it Theodore?
- I am only a stranger.

37
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:16,406
Then have a kiss on account.

38
00:12:22,328 --> 00:12:24,786
I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.

39
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,877
I am his daughter, Katrina.

40
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:33,376
- We have not heard your name yet.
- I have not said it. Excuse me.

41
00:12:34,376 --> 00:12:38,136
- You need some manners!
- Brom, we'll have no raised voices.

42
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:45,347
It is to raise spirits in this dark time
that I and my wife are giving this party.

43
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:49,357
You are welcome,
even if you are selling something.

44
00:12:51,016 --> 00:12:56,487
Constable Ichabod Crane, sent from
New York to investigate the murders.

45
00:12:56,607 --> 00:12:59,905
Then Sleepy Hollow is grateful to you.

46
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:04,617
We hope you will honour us
by remaining in this house.

47
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,747
Come sir, we'll get you settled.
Play on!

48
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,544
Excuse me.

49
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:25,885
Thank you. Please tell Mr Van Tassel
I will be down in a moment.

50
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,135
I will, sir.

51
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:34,606
Thank God you're here.

52
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:46,034
Ah, excellent, come in.

53
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,996
Leave us, my dear.

54
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:56,955
We are joined by Dr Thomas Lancaster,
Reverend Steenwyck, -

55
00:13:57,085 --> 00:13:59,675
- our able magistrate Samuel Philipse, -

56
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:05,055
- and lastly, this fine fellow
is James Hardenbrook, our notary.

57
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:10,095
- And you, sir?
- A simple farmer who has prospered.

58
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:13,644
The town looks to me
as friend and counsel.

59
00:14:13,764 --> 00:14:16,644
And landlord and banker.
Can we proceed?

60
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:25,524
So, three persons murdered...

61
00:14:27,485 --> 00:14:30,955
First, Peter Van Garrett...

62
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:33,913
...and his son, Dirk Van Garrett.

63
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:39,964
Both of them strong, capable men, -

64
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:44,753
- found together... decapitated.

65
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:50,674
One week later, the Widow Winship.

66
00:14:50,804 --> 00:14:53,893
Also decapitated.

67
00:14:56,064 --> 00:15:00,484
Now, I will need
to ask you many questions, -

68
00:15:00,604 --> 00:15:04,944
- but first let me ask,
is anyone suspected?

69
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:13,204
How much have your superiors
explained to you?

70
00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:18,541
Only that the three were slain
in open ground, -

71
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:22,622
- their heads found severed
from their bodies.

72
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:27,002
Their heads were not found severed.
Their heads were not found at all.

73
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:33,882
- The heads are gone?
- Taken.

74
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:39,683
Taken by the Headless Horseman.
Taken back to hell.

75
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:45,233
- Pardon, I don't...
- Perhaps you had better sit down.

76
00:15:47,943 --> 00:15:50,323
Yes.

77
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:55,823
The Horseman
was a Hessian mercenary, -

78
00:15:55,953 --> 00:16:01,582
- sent by German princes to keep
Americans under the yoke of England.

79
00:16:01,871 --> 00:16:05,832
But unlike his compatriots,
who came for money, -

80
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:09,672
- the Horseman came
for love of carnage.

81
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:14,342
When battle was joined,
there you'd find him.

82
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:21,062
{y:i}He rode a giant black steed
{y:i}named Daredevil.

83
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:28,312
{y:i}He rode hard into battle,
{y:i}chopping off heads at full gallop.

84
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:32,030
{y:i}He had filed his teeth
"down to sharp points," -

85
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,992
- "to add to the ferocity"
{y:i}of his appearance.

86
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:51,171
{y:i}This butcher didn't finally reach
{y:i}his end until the winter of '79.

87
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,341
{y:i}Not far from here,
{y:i}in our western woods.

88
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,939
They chopped off his head with
his own sword. Even today the woods -

89
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,149
- is a haunted place,
where brave men will not venture.

90
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,868
{y:i}For what was planted in the ground
"that day"-

91
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:06,329
- was a seed of evil.

92
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,459
{y:i}And so it has been for 20 years.

93
00:18:11,249 --> 00:18:17,259
But now the Hessian wakes,
cutting off heads where he finds them.

94
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,969
Are you saying...
Is that what you believe?

95
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,019
Seeing is believing.

96
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:37,438
They tell me you've brought books
of scientific investigation.

97
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:41,488
This is the only book
I recommend you read.

98
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:56,417
Reverend Steenwyck, gentlemen...

99
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,048
Murder needs no ghost
to come from the grave.

100
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,718
We have murders in New York
without benefit of ghouls and goblins.

101
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:08,098
You're far from New York.

102
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:14,308
The assassin is a man of
flesh and blood, and I will discover him.

103
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:57,517
Come out, devil.

104
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:55,825
- His name's Gunpowder.
- He should do just fine. Thank you.

105
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:59,624
Good luck, sir. You need any help,
you call my name.

106
00:21:00,085 --> 00:21:05,465
Don't you worry about a thing.
Everything will be just fine.

107
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:10,174
Thomas, inside!

108
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:14,475
Run along for breakfast. Kiss your
mother once for you and twice for me.

109
00:21:15,265 --> 00:21:18,015
Murder! The Horseman's killed again!

110
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:23,224
All right, Gunpowder, we're off.

111
00:21:23,353 --> 00:21:26,393
No, no, the other way.

112
00:21:32,274 --> 00:21:34,534
Good horse.

113
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:50,584
Mr Miller, ride back for the coffin-cart.
The rest of you, keep a sharp lookout.

114
00:21:53,383 --> 00:21:56,383
It's all right. I'm here now.

115
00:22:20,533 --> 00:22:24,283
The fourth victim, Jonathan Masbath.

116
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:31,172
I see. And the head...?

117
00:22:32,463 --> 00:22:36,213
- Taken.
- Taken...

118
00:22:37,013 --> 00:22:40,132
- Interesting. Very interesting.
- What is?

119
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:45,972
In cases like this, the head is removed
to prevent identification of the body.

120
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:51,651
- But we know this was Masbath.
- Precisely. So why was it removed?

121
00:22:51,941 --> 00:22:54,691
- Why?
- Right.

122
00:22:56,191 --> 00:23:00,032
You have moved the body?
You must never move the body.

123
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:04,032
- Why not?
- Because.

124
00:23:17,592 --> 00:23:21,472
The stride is gigantic!

125
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:25,391
The attacker rode Masbath down.

126
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:31,771
Turned his horse.
Came back to claim the head.

127
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:54,251
There's a chemical reaction.

128
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,251
It shows it was a powerful
singular thrust to the neck.

129
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:28,740
- Interesting.
- What is it?

130
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:35,369
The wound was cauterised,
as though the blade were red-hot.

131
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,090
And yet, no blistering,
no scorched flesh.

132
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,090
The Devil's fire.

133
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:55,598
"Be vigilant", as it sayeth in the
Book of Peter, chapter five, verse eight.

134
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:01,858
"Because your adversary, the Devil,
as a roaring lion, walketh about, -

135
00:25:02,148 --> 00:25:07,658
- seeking whom he may devour."
God rest, Jonathan Masbath.

136
00:25:35,518 --> 00:25:40,308
- Mr Constable, sir.
- You're young Masbath.

137
00:25:40,768 --> 00:25:44,607
I was young Masbath,
but now the only one.

138
00:25:44,738 --> 00:25:49,818
Masbath at your service. In honour,
bound to avenge my father.

139
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:55,578
Well, I thank you very much, but your
mother will need you more than I.

140
00:25:57,157 --> 00:26:01,588
My mother is in heaven. She has
my father now to care for her.

141
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:06,667
But you have no one to serve you.
I am your man, sir.

142
00:26:06,838 --> 00:26:11,676
And a brave one, too. But I cannot
be the one to look after you.

143
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:16,636
I am sorry for your loss,
young Mr Masbath.

144
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:32,616
Constable Crane!
There's something you should know.

145
00:26:32,737 --> 00:26:37,747
Jonathan Masbath was not
the fourth victim, but the fifth.

146
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:44,876
- The fifth?
- Aye. Five victims in four graves.

147
00:26:56,216 --> 00:27:01,556
Masbath, find a place in Van Tassel's
servants' quarters. Wake me at dawn.

148
00:27:01,976 --> 00:27:04,355
I hope you have a strong stomach.

149
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:11,405
Peter Van Garrett, Dirk Van Garrett.

150
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:18,196
Jonathan Masbath.
Five victims, four graves.

151
00:27:31,624 --> 00:27:35,465
The Widow Winship.

152
00:27:58,654 --> 00:28:01,364
Bring the widow in.

153
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:06,874
- This is most irregular, Constable.
- Yes, but in this case necessary.

154
00:28:07,745 --> 00:28:11,794
- I need to operate immediately.
- Operate? She's dead.

155
00:28:13,254 --> 00:28:17,964
I mean, of course,
I will need the operating table.

156
00:28:20,714 --> 00:28:24,593
Once more,
the neck wound cauterised, -

157
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:31,393
- the sword thrust to the stomach
the same, but to what purpose?

158
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:34,653
To what is your purpose,
is the question.

159
00:28:34,774 --> 00:28:39,903
- What type of instruments are these?
- Some of my own design.

160
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:43,784
Step out, young Masbath.

161
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:48,373
Thank you for your help, Mr Killian.
And if you don't mind, Doctor, -

162
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:53,463
- my concentration suffers greatly
when I'm observed.

163
00:29:31,833 --> 00:29:35,712
- I am finished.
- What have you done to her?

164
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:40,542
- We are dealing with a madman.
- What did you find out?

165
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:43,762
The Widow Winship was with child.

166
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,051
Who's there?

167
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:09,586
- Oh, pardon my intrusion.
- There's no intrusion.

168
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:13,166
I come here to read when I'm wakeful.

169
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:21,307
- To read books which you must hide.
- They were my mother's books.

170
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:27,557
My father believes tales of romance
caused the brain fever that killed her.

171
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:32,187
The nurse who cared for her during
her sickness is now Lady Van Tassel.

172
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:40,115
Why did no one mention that the Van
Garretts are kin to the Van Tassels?

173
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:46,076
Hardly a household is not connected
to every other by blood or marriage.

174
00:33:46,996 --> 00:33:49,165
I see.

175
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:58,835
This was Van Garrett land, given to my
father when I wore swaddling clothes.

176
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:03,135
They were the richest family around.
When my father brought me here, -

177
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:06,095
- Van Garrett set him up with an acre
and a broken-down cottage.

178
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:13,686
My father worked hard and prospered.
I owe Van Garrett my happiness.

179
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:16,945
I remember living poor in the cottage.

180
00:34:17,396 --> 00:34:20,614
- Should I show you?
- Yes.

181
00:34:23,864 --> 00:34:29,325
- Take this. It is my gift for you.
- No, I have no use for it.

182
00:34:29,625 --> 00:34:33,205
Are you so certain of everything?

183
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:49,134
- It was your mother's.
- It is sure protection against harm.

184
00:34:53,895 --> 00:34:58,024
Are you so certain of everything?

185
00:35:12,074 --> 00:35:15,124
What are these strange markings?

186
00:35:15,374 --> 00:35:18,334
I've had them since I can remember.

187
00:35:28,344 --> 00:35:32,474
I used to play by this hearth
as a child.

188
00:35:34,894 --> 00:35:38,354
It was my first drawing school.
My mother was my teacher.

189
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:44,732
Look. See?
Carved into the fireback.

190
00:35:45,403 --> 00:35:48,193
The archer. I'd forgotten it.

191
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:54,913
This was from long before
we lived here.

192
00:35:56,083 --> 00:36:00,163
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

193
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:06,883
A cardinal. I'd love to have a tame one,
but I wouldn't have the heart to cage it.

194
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:13,433
Well, then I have something for you.

195
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:20,103
Cardinal on one side,
an empty cage. And now...

196
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:29,822
- You can do magic. Teach me.
- It is no magic. We call it "optics".

197
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:37,412
The pictures are joined in the spinning.
Truth is not always appearance.

198
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:32,421
What are you running from, Philipse?
You had a mind to help me.

199
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:39,101
Yes, and it's put me in dread of powers
against which there is no defence.

200
00:37:39,221 --> 00:37:42,980
- You knew the widow was expecting?
- She told me.

201
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,150
And you are not the child's father?
Did she tell you the father's name?

202
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:53,070
Yes. She came to me for advice
as town magistrate, -

203
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,160
- to protect the rights of her child.
I was bound to keep the secret.

204
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,870
- Do you believe the father killed her?
- The Horseman killed her.

205
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:07,249
There is no Horseman.
There never was. There never will be.

206
00:38:07,959 --> 00:38:11,959
- What is that thing?
- My protection from the Horseman.

207
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:18,050
A magistrate, full of such nonsense!
Now tell me the name of...

208
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:40,159
Oh, my God!

209
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,578
Constable Crane?

210
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:31,418
Has he not come out at all?

211
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:39,968
- It was a headless horseman!
- You must not excite yourself.

212
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:45,717
- That's why you're here.
- A horseman, a dead one, headless!

213
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:50,137
- I know.
- You don't. You weren't there. It's true!

214
00:39:50,266 --> 00:39:54,476
Of course it is.
I told you. Everyone told you.

215
00:39:54,607 --> 00:39:58,147
I saw him.

216
00:40:02,447 --> 00:40:05,987
I suppose it's back to the city, then.

217
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:34,075
This time I'll go to New York myself.
I won't be fobbed off with an amateur.

218
00:41:46,385 --> 00:41:50,254
- This time, a magistrate's dead.
- Gentlemen...

219
00:41:50,384 --> 00:41:55,263
I need able men to go with me
into the western woods.

220
00:41:55,384 --> 00:42:00,763
- We thought you'd shot your bolt.
- I will find the Horseman's grave.

221
00:42:01,064 --> 00:42:05,564
I will pit myself
against a murdering ghost.

222
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,824
Who's with me?

223
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:11,614
Me.

224
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:21,084
The Van Garretts, Widow Winship,
your father, and now Philipse.

225
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:26,124
Something must connect them. Did
your father deal with the Van Garretts?

226
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:30,383
He worked for them.
We lived in the coach-house.

227
00:42:30,503 --> 00:42:32,553
It's nothing.

228
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:39,722
There was an argument between father
and son a week before the murder.

229
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:42,722
My father was later sent for
by Mr Van Garrett.

230
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:51,863
An argument between father and son.
Elder Van Garrett sent for his servant...

231
00:42:52,523 --> 00:42:55,193
Listen.

232
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,202
- I hear nothing.
- Nor I.

233
00:42:58,323 --> 00:43:02,492
No birds, no crickets,
it's all gone so quiet.

234
00:43:11,462 --> 00:43:13,592
Quicken pace.

235
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:06,561
Pardon our intrusion,
but perhaps you could help us.

236
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:11,191
- You're from the Hollow.
- In a way, yes.

237
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:18,441
I make no assumptions
about your occupation, -

238
00:44:18,571 --> 00:44:21,530
- nor your ways,
which... which... which...

239
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,371
...are nothing to me, whatever you are.
Each to his own.

240
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,259
Do you know of the Horseman, ma'am?
The Hessian?

241
00:44:44,969 --> 00:44:47,390
That'll be him.

242
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:50,480
You, come with me.

243
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,900
Go out, child. Keep away.
Whatever you hear, keep away.

244
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,330
What might he hear
that he must keep away from?

245
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:18,249
He rides to the Hollow and back.
I hear him. I smell the blood on him.

246
00:45:18,669 --> 00:45:20,968
Do you?

247
00:45:21,258 --> 00:45:26,049
Well, I'm here to find him
and make him stop.

248
00:45:33,019 --> 00:45:37,559
You seek knowledge
of the netherworld. I can show you.

249
00:45:44,988 --> 00:45:48,869
- What are you doing?
- Don't move or speak.

250
00:45:48,988 --> 00:45:52,369
- When the other comes, I will hold him.
- The other?

251
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,628
Silence. He comes now.

252
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,298
Madam...

253
00:46:08,848 --> 00:46:12,598
Madam, do you hear me?

254
00:46:23,027 --> 00:46:26,697
You seek the warrior bathed in blood,
the Headless Horseman.

255
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:32,578
Follow the Indian trail to where
the sun dies, to the Tree of the Dead.

256
00:46:32,697 --> 00:46:37,827
Climb down
to the Horseman's resting place.

257
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:47,377
We're leaving.
We're leaving now.

258
00:46:49,466 --> 00:46:53,017
- We go to the Tree of the Dead.
- How will we recognise it?

259
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:57,477
Without difficulty, I fear.
Then to the Horseman's resting place.

260
00:46:57,597 --> 00:47:00,557
- His camp?
- His grave.

261
00:47:11,026 --> 00:47:13,736
Stay here.

262
00:47:49,985 --> 00:47:53,576
Halt and turn,
I have a pistol aimed!

263
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:58,405
Katrina! I might have killed you.
Why have you come?

264
00:47:58,535 --> 00:48:01,495
Because no one else
would go with you.

265
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:06,875
Then I am now twice the man.
It is your white magic.

266
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:15,805
Pardon my intrusion.
I think you'd better look at this.

267
00:48:58,014 --> 00:49:00,264
The Tree of the Dead.

268
00:49:16,943 --> 00:49:18,982
Blood.

269
00:49:21,243 --> 00:49:23,243
Stay where you are.

270
00:50:03,902 --> 00:50:07,992
- What is it?
- Just stay where you are. Don't move.

271
00:50:23,972 --> 00:50:29,052
This tree is a gateway
between two worlds.

272
00:50:41,031 --> 00:50:46,611
This ground has been disturbed.
The soil is loose. Bring the shovel.

273
00:51:04,881 --> 00:51:09,351
The skull is gone.
Taken.

274
00:51:09,641 --> 00:51:12,601
That's why he returns from the grave.

275
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:16,270
To take heads
until his own is restored to him.

276
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,790
Ichabod?

277
00:52:24,669 --> 00:52:28,299
Split up. Glenn. Theodore.

278
00:52:47,477 --> 00:52:52,868
- Don't pick your teeth, it's a bad habit.
- I am a bad habit.

279
00:52:52,988 --> 00:52:56,738
- There's nothing for it.
- Oh, isn't there?

280
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:18,218
- Let's get ready for bed.
- Yes.

281
00:53:40,197 --> 00:53:42,117
Beth, run!

282
00:54:02,936 --> 00:54:05,265
Be quiet.

283
00:56:49,962 --> 00:56:53,261
- Wait, he's not after you.
- I'll get him.

284
00:57:13,362 --> 00:57:16,062
We cannot win this.

285
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,460
Remarkable. A wound like this
should have killed him, -

286
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:21,259
- but it needs no stitch,
and there's hardly a loss of blood.

287
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:27,960
- You must be still. The fever is on you.
- Katrina...

288
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:35,160
Nostradamus, Mediamus,
milk of mercy, in media nos laudamas.

289
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:55,459
Katrina, I tried to stop Brom...

290
00:58:56,758 --> 00:59:00,359
Drink this down,
it will make you sleep.

291
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,659
The Horseman was not set to kill Brom
or me. Had Brom not attacked him...

292
00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:07,059
Later. Rest now.

293
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:10,559
The Horseman doesn't kill at random.

294
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:16,459
His victims are chosen by
that very person who took his skull.

295
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:22,559
Someone who knew where to dig,
of flesh and blood, as I've always said.

296
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:26,059
- These are ravings.
- Drink.

297
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:17,657
{y:i}Ichabod...

298
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:43,157
- You were dreaming.
- Yes. Of things I had forgotten...

299
01:00:46,657 --> 01:00:48,857
...and would not like to remember.

300
01:00:49,157 --> 01:00:53,755
- Tell me what you dreamt.
- My mother was an innocent.

301
01:00:53,755 --> 01:00:57,255
A child of nature.

302
01:00:57,356 --> 01:01:02,856
Condemned.
Murdered... by my father.

303
01:01:03,556 --> 01:01:07,556
- Murdered by...?
- Murdered to save her soul.

304
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:13,056
By a Bible-black tyrant,
behind a mask of righteousness.

305
01:01:13,255 --> 01:01:16,255
I was seven when I lost my faith.

306
01:01:18,856 --> 01:01:22,456
- What do you believe in?
- Sense and reason.

307
01:01:22,856 --> 01:01:25,156
Cause and consequence.

308
01:01:27,456 --> 01:01:32,754
But here my rational mind has been
so controverted by the spirit world.

309
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:39,655
You'll take nothing from Sleepy Hollow
that was worth the coming here?

310
01:01:39,754 --> 01:01:42,455
No, not nothing.

311
01:01:45,155 --> 01:01:50,555
A kiss from a lovely young woman,
before she saw me or knew my name.

312
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:54,555
Yes, without sense or reason.

313
01:01:58,355 --> 01:02:04,555
Forgive me. I speak of kisses,
and you've lost your brave man Brom.

314
01:02:06,655 --> 01:02:09,555
I have shed my tears for Brom, -

315
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:14,854
- and yet my heart is not broken.
Do you think me wicked?

316
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:21,654
No. But perhaps
there is a bit of witch in you.

317
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:26,753
- Why do you say that?
- Because you've bewitched me.

318
01:02:41,954 --> 01:02:43,954
You slept like the dead.

319
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:48,554
You're too kind to me. I don't look
to be served by the lady of the house.

320
01:02:48,654 --> 01:02:52,854
Nor would you be,
but that the servant girl has vanished.

321
01:02:52,954 --> 01:02:56,653
- Sarah?
- Run away, like so many others.

322
01:02:57,653 --> 01:03:00,453
They're all leaving in fear.

323
01:03:01,353 --> 01:03:03,453
Where is Katrina?

324
01:03:03,553 --> 01:03:07,553
She watched over you till dawn.
Now it is her turn to sleep.

325
01:03:14,752 --> 01:03:17,553
I'm fit for another day, I think.

326
01:03:18,853 --> 01:03:20,453
Fit enough to face a mortal adversary.

327
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:27,752
Dr. Lancaster.
Reverend Steenwyck.

328
01:03:30,653 --> 01:03:35,652
Notary Hardenbrook
and Magistrate Philipse...

329
01:03:36,952 --> 01:03:40,552
...who tried to cut and run,
and lost his head.

330
01:03:40,652 --> 01:03:46,452
Four frightened men arguing together
on the very night Philipse was killed.

331
01:03:48,052 --> 01:03:50,552
There is conspiracy here.

332
01:03:54,652 --> 01:03:59,452
The doctor, the reverend,
the notary and the magistrate.

333
01:04:02,052 --> 01:04:05,751
What is the secret that unites them?

334
01:04:07,952 --> 01:04:12,452
Magistrate Philipse knew
there were five bodies to four graves.

335
01:04:12,652 --> 01:04:17,651
He knew the widow was pregnant and
would not tell me the father's name.

336
01:04:19,451 --> 01:04:23,051
What does this point to?

337
01:04:28,951 --> 01:04:32,451
We must proceed
by process of elimination.

338
01:04:32,551 --> 01:04:38,750
I'll list everyone in town, starting with
its chief citizen, Baltus Van Tassel.

339
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:45,351
- I feel we're getting very close.
- Yes...

340
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:51,451
I suppose Baltus is the chief citizen,
now that old Van Garrett is dead.

341
01:04:51,651 --> 01:04:55,951
The Van Garretts...
I'd almost forgotten them.

342
01:05:06,749 --> 01:05:10,450
Come with me,
to Notary Hardenbrook's.

343
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:16,550
- Have you thought of something?
- Yes... I have.

344
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:32,150
Hopeless.

345
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:45,449
My father's satchel.
Why is it here?

346
01:05:50,049 --> 01:05:53,949
- Leave me alone.
- Notary Hardenbrook...

347
01:05:54,049 --> 01:05:57,849
Show me the last will and testament
of old man Van Garrett.

348
01:05:58,449 --> 01:06:02,649
- The will leaves everything to his son.
- Who died with him.

349
01:06:02,748 --> 01:06:08,149
- The estate passes to the next of kin.
- Naturally. All legal and above board.

350
01:06:08,949 --> 01:06:14,748
- Sir?
- I'm a dead man. No...

351
01:06:16,449 --> 01:06:19,048
Van Garrett's seal, broken.

352
01:06:21,747 --> 01:06:29,247
He made a new will just before he died,
naming... Widow Winship?

353
01:06:29,448 --> 01:06:34,548
And here, look.
A marriage certificate.

354
01:06:35,148 --> 01:06:41,148
He secretly married the widow and left
everything to her and her unborn child.

355
01:06:41,848 --> 01:06:47,548
It stood between Van Garrett's fortune
and the one who'd have got everything.

356
01:06:47,648 --> 01:06:52,747
It's true, but we four
were drawn in against our will.

357
01:06:53,448 --> 01:06:55,448
- Your will?
- He means...

358
01:06:56,048 --> 01:07:00,447
Of course, the four town elders.

359
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:05,647
Now I see what parts you had to play.
Steenwyck knew the secret.

360
01:07:05,847 --> 01:07:10,746
He performed the marriage. Lancaster
attended the pregnant woman.

361
01:07:10,947 --> 01:07:17,047
Philipse gave protection of the law.
Hardenbrook concealed documents -

362
01:07:17,147 --> 01:07:20,547
- entrusted by Van Garrett
to his faithful servant.

363
01:07:20,647 --> 01:07:26,847
- The conspirators drawn into the plot.
- We knew not it was a murdering plot.

364
01:07:26,947 --> 01:07:29,047
But I have not finished, sir.

365
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:34,647
First, the Van Garretts slain by
a horseman raised from the grave.

366
01:07:34,746 --> 01:07:38,847
Up pops a widow with a claim
on the fortune. Off with her head.

367
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:43,646
But murder begets murder.
It was the servant...

368
01:07:43,745 --> 01:07:48,346
...Jonathan Masbath. The night father
and son quarrelled over the new will.

369
01:07:49,146 --> 01:07:53,046
Masbath was summoned upstairs
to bear witness.

370
01:07:53,146 --> 01:07:57,646
Here is his signature.
I'm afraid it was his death warrant.

371
01:07:57,846 --> 01:08:02,046
The Horseman came for him.
Came for him -

372
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:07,245
- at the bidding of someone who had
power over him, who dug in the earth -

373
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:13,545
- and stole the skull, which must again
be his before he will return to hell.

374
01:08:13,745 --> 01:08:17,844
Someone who stood to gain
or lose a fortune. None other -

375
01:08:17,945 --> 01:08:22,244
- than Van Garrett's next of kin,
Baltus Van Tassel!

376
01:08:28,244 --> 01:08:32,343
- Katrina, why are you in my room?
- Because it is yours.

377
01:08:36,744 --> 01:08:41,343
- Was it wicked of me?
- No, not at all.

378
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:47,843
- I missed you. Where did you go?
- I had questions to ask Hardenbrook.

379
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:53,944
- Did you learn anything of interest?
- Perhaps.

380
01:08:55,044 --> 01:08:57,044
- My father...
- Your father?

381
01:08:57,143 --> 01:09:00,944
Yes. My father thinks
you should return to New York.

382
01:09:01,044 --> 01:09:04,243
Really? Why is that?

383
01:09:05,142 --> 01:09:09,743
I don't know. Perhaps he looked in your
ledger and did not like what he saw.

384
01:09:16,043 --> 01:09:20,243
- What have you there?
- Evidence. I'm sorry, I must ask you...

385
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:24,043
Then I'll leave you to your thoughts.

386
01:09:36,743 --> 01:09:39,342
- It's just a spider.
- Kill it!

387
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:45,042
- No, stop it!
- There's something under here.

388
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:49,242
- What is it?
- Help me move the bed.

389
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:52,142
No, I mustn't. You do it.

390
01:09:58,242 --> 01:10:04,642
The evil eye. It is someone
casting spells against you.

391
01:10:04,842 --> 01:10:08,142
The evil eye...

392
01:10:57,441 --> 01:11:00,241
Wait here.

393
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,939
Katrina...

394
01:12:18,339 --> 01:12:22,139
- You took the evidence and burned it.
- So it would not accuse my father.

395
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:27,938
I accuse no one. But if there is guilt,
I cannot alter it, even if it grieves me.

396
01:12:28,138 --> 01:12:34,438
No spells of yours can alter it, either.
It is he who profits from these murders.

397
01:12:34,838 --> 01:12:38,438
If you knew him, you'd not have
such harsh thoughts about him.

398
01:12:38,539 --> 01:12:44,638
- Nor if you felt anything for me.
- Why did his friends conceal...?

399
01:12:44,938 --> 01:12:49,039
You are the constable. Find another
chain of reasoning and let me be.

400
01:12:49,138 --> 01:12:54,039
I cannot. Nor the one or the other.
And I am heartsick with it.

401
01:12:54,138 --> 01:12:58,838
I think you have no heart,
and I had a mind once to give you mine.

402
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:03,438
Yes, I think you loved me -

403
01:13:03,539 --> 01:13:07,137
- when you followed me into the woods.
To have braved such peril.

404
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:13,038
What peril was there if it was my own
father who controlled the Horseman?

405
01:13:16,837 --> 01:13:20,637
Goodbye, Ichabod Crane. I curse
the day you came to Sleepy Hollow.

406
01:13:26,038 --> 01:13:30,937
- She will not see you.
- Did she say anything?

407
01:13:32,937 --> 01:13:36,237
Only that she will not come down.

408
01:13:36,337 --> 01:13:40,437
- I see. Thank you.
- Constable...

409
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:46,437
You have not asked me
how I hurt my hand since yesterday, -

410
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:50,136
- which would have been polite.

411
01:13:50,236 --> 01:13:56,537
In fact, you have been as careful
not to look at it as not to mention it.

412
01:13:58,136 --> 01:14:03,336
- Yes, I'm sorry. How did you...?
- I know you saw me.

413
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:08,136
- What?
- I know you followed last night.

414
01:14:08,236 --> 01:14:13,336
You must promise not to tell my
husband what you saw. Promise me!

415
01:14:14,436 --> 01:14:19,037
The town is in ferment! Horror
piled on tragedy. Hardenbrook is dead!

416
01:14:19,236 --> 01:14:23,336
- That harmless old man?
- Hanged himself in the night.

417
01:14:23,436 --> 01:14:26,537
- Hanged himself?
- There's a church meeting tonight.

418
01:14:26,636 --> 01:14:31,635
Everyone is going to speak out
against you. If you are wise, -

419
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:36,335
- you will leave this place.
What is that?

420
01:14:37,036 --> 01:14:41,036
- I was careless with the kitchen knife.
- The wound looks angry.

421
01:14:41,135 --> 01:14:45,635
I will bind it with arrowroot flowers.
I know where some grow.

422
01:14:57,036 --> 01:15:00,536
Hurry up,
the meeting bell has started tolling.

423
01:15:24,334 --> 01:15:30,934
The Horseman!
Katrina, the Horseman saved me!

424
01:15:33,035 --> 01:15:36,535
The Horseman killed your stepmother!

425
01:15:45,334 --> 01:15:47,035
Oh, God!

426
01:16:17,233 --> 01:16:21,633
You'll kill us all!
You're the one the Horseman wants!

427
01:16:41,432 --> 01:16:43,432
He cannot enter.

428
01:16:53,232 --> 01:16:58,033
The Horseman cannot enter!
He cannot cross the gate.

429
01:16:58,232 --> 01:17:01,632
We have to save ourselves.

430
01:17:01,732 --> 01:17:04,732
The next person to lay a hand on me
will get a bullet!

431
01:17:06,632 --> 01:17:09,232
He's coming back!

432
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:20,231
- Enough have died. It's time to confess.
- What is it that you know?

433
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:25,431
Your four friends played you false.
We were possessed by one who...

434
01:17:35,131 --> 01:17:37,131
Stay back!

435
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,430
There's a conspiracy here,
and I will seek it out!

436
01:19:14,828 --> 01:19:18,228
It was an evil spirit possessed you.

437
01:19:18,328 --> 01:19:23,628
I pray it is satisfied and that you find
peace. The evil eye has done its work.

438
01:19:23,828 --> 01:19:28,328
My life is over. Spared for
a lifetime of horrors in my sleep.

439
01:19:29,428 --> 01:19:32,428
Waking each day to grief.

440
01:19:37,728 --> 01:19:40,728
Goodbye, Katrina.

441
01:20:17,727 --> 01:20:21,827
- You think it was Katrina, don't you?
- That can never be uttered.

442
01:20:21,927 --> 01:20:25,327
A strange sort of witch,
with a kind and loving heart.

443
01:20:25,427 --> 01:20:27,727
- How can you think so?
- I have good reason.

444
01:20:27,927 --> 01:20:31,827
- Then you are bewitched by reason.
- And beaten down by it!

445
01:20:36,726 --> 01:20:40,626
It is a hard lesson for a hard world.
You'd better learn it.

446
01:20:40,726 --> 01:20:46,726
Villainy wears many masks. None
so dangerous as the mask of virtue.

447
01:20:53,926 --> 01:20:55,926
Farewell.

448
01:22:25,124 --> 01:22:28,624
Return the coach! Turn around now!

449
01:22:41,923 --> 01:22:44,524
Pardon my intrusion.

450
01:22:53,923 --> 01:22:59,024
No blood flow,
no clotting, no healing.

451
01:23:00,823 --> 01:23:04,823
When this cut was made,
this woman was already dead.

452
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:17,823
Dear stepdaughter.

453
01:23:19,223 --> 01:23:22,523
You look as if you'd seen a ghost.

454
01:23:53,023 --> 01:23:59,222
Rise up once more, my dark avenger.
One more night of beheading.

455
01:23:59,822 --> 01:24:01,921
Rise up with your sword.

456
01:24:02,221 --> 01:24:06,121
A head for a head.

457
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:09,221
My unholy horseman, rise.

458
01:24:09,522 --> 01:24:14,022
Come now for Katrina.

459
01:24:27,522 --> 01:24:30,022
Awake at last.

460
01:24:30,321 --> 01:24:34,921
- You thought it was all a nasty dream?
- Father saw the Horseman kill you.

461
01:24:35,721 --> 01:24:39,221
He saw the Horseman come toward
me with his sword unsheathed, -

462
01:24:40,022 --> 01:24:46,120
- but it is I who govern the Horseman,
dear, and Baltus did not stay to watch.

463
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:54,120
- But there was a body.
- The servant girl, Sarah.

464
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:57,320
I always thought she was useless...

465
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:03,021
...but she had a purpose after all.

466
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:13,820
- Who are you?
- My family name was Archer.

467
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:16,920
The archer?

468
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:26,520
I lived with my father, mother and sister
in a cottage not far from here.

469
01:25:26,619 --> 01:25:33,819
My father died, and the landlord, whom
we'd served faithfully, evicted us.

470
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:40,719
No one would take us in, because my
mother was suspected of witchcraft.

471
01:25:40,819 --> 01:25:45,520
She schooled her daughters well, while
we lived as outcasts in the woods.

472
01:25:46,819 --> 01:25:49,219
She died within a year.

473
01:25:54,119 --> 01:25:59,719
My sister and I remained in our refuge,
seeing not a soul.

474
01:25:59,919 --> 01:26:06,318
Until one day, gathering firewood,
we crossed the path of the Hessian.

475
01:26:11,818 --> 01:26:18,118
I saw his death. At that moment,
I offered my soul to Satan, -

476
01:26:18,318 --> 01:26:23,918
- if he would raise the Hessian
from the grave to avenge me.

477
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:30,418
- Avenge you?
- Against Van Garrett!

478
01:26:30,618 --> 01:26:33,918
The landlord who showed us no mercy
and left us to starve, -

479
01:26:34,019 --> 01:26:39,019
- whilst Baltus and his simpering wife
and girl child stole our home.

480
01:26:39,118 --> 01:26:42,418
I'd make myself mistress of all he had.

481
01:26:42,718 --> 01:26:47,217
The easiest was to enter your house
as your mother's sick-nurse, -

482
01:26:47,317 --> 01:26:51,617
- and put her body into the grave,
and my own into the marriage bed.

483
01:26:51,817 --> 01:26:58,917
Not quite so easy was to secure
my legacy. The widow had to go, -

484
01:26:59,117 --> 01:27:05,117
- and the servant Masbath. Just the
other day, that silly midwife Killian -

485
01:27:05,117 --> 01:27:08,317
- told me the widow
had told her a big secret.

486
01:27:08,617 --> 01:27:13,417
And she told me this right in front
of her husband! What a goose!

487
01:27:13,917 --> 01:27:18,417
So, another little job for the Horseman.

488
01:27:20,018 --> 01:27:26,316
But lust delivered
the Rev. Steenwyck into my power.

489
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:31,416
Fear did the same for Hardenbrook
and the drunkard Philipse.

490
01:27:31,716 --> 01:27:35,316
And the doctor's silence I exchanged
for my complicity -

491
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:39,816
- in his fornications
with the servant girl Sarah.

492
01:27:39,916 --> 01:27:45,716
- Yes, you have everything now.
- No, you have, my dear.

493
01:27:45,816 --> 01:27:51,216
By your father's will. I get everything
in the event of your death.

494
01:27:52,816 --> 01:27:57,816
Oh, my sister, by the way,
sadly passed away.

495
01:28:00,017 --> 01:28:02,716
Quite recently.

496
01:28:04,017 --> 01:28:08,815
- You killed your own sister.
- She brought it on herself.

497
01:28:08,915 --> 01:28:11,815
By helping you and your master!

498
01:28:12,915 --> 01:28:16,115
You're just in time
to have your head cut off.

499
01:28:16,215 --> 01:28:19,815
Tonight the Horseman comes for you!

500
01:28:26,415 --> 01:28:28,715
Katrina!

501
01:28:34,215 --> 01:28:36,016
Thank God.

502
01:28:44,415 --> 01:28:46,515
Watch your head.

503
01:29:02,114 --> 01:29:04,614
To the roof. I have an idea.

504
01:30:04,313 --> 01:30:06,413
Jump in the sails!

505
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,513
Jump!

506
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:30,013
Hurry!

507
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:53,211
- Is he dead?
- He was dead to begin with.

508
01:31:17,211 --> 01:31:20,211
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere but here.

509
01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:35,110
Take the reins.

510
01:32:52,009 --> 01:32:53,708
My bag!

511
01:33:11,009 --> 01:33:12,308
Jump!

512
01:34:15,406 --> 01:34:18,106
- Still alive?
- Run, Katrina.

513
01:34:18,606 --> 01:34:22,507
Yes, do run and jump and skip.

514
01:34:34,507 --> 01:34:40,106
Here, take her! She's yours!

515
01:34:43,606 --> 01:34:47,106
Sir, you're not dead!

516
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:29,905
Horseman!

517
01:39:01,899 --> 01:39:04,699
Just in time for a new century.

518
01:39:16,899 --> 01:39:18,899
You'll soon get your bearings,
young Masbath.

519
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,500
The Bronx is up, the Battery's down,
and home is this way.

520
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:45,500
