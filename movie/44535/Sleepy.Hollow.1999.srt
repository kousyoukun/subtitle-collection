WHO ARE YOU?

773
01:25:13,436 --> 01:25:17,472
MY FAMILY NAME
WAS ARCHER.

774
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,207
THE ARCHER.

775
01:25:20,676 --> 01:25:22,943
[Whinnying]

776
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,149
I LIVED WITH MY FATHER AND MOTHER AND
SISTER IN A COTTAGE NOT FAR FROM HERE.

777
01:25:30,216 --> 01:25:32,517
UNTIL ONE DAY MY FATHER DIED.

778
01:25:32,585 --> 01:25:35,092
THE LANDLORD, WHO HAD
RECEIVED MANY YEARS OF

779
01:25:35,118 --> 01:25:37,513
LOYAL SERVICE FROM MY
PARENTS, EVICTED US.

780
01:25:37,556 --> 01:25:39,823
NO ONE IN
THIS GOD-FEARING TOWN...

781
01:25:39,891 --> 01:25:43,559
WOULD TAKE US IN BECAUSE MY MOTHER
WAS SUSPECTED OF WITCHCRAFT.

782
01:25:43,626 --> 01:25:46,411
BUT SHE SCHOOLED HER
DAUGHTERS WELL WHILE

783
01:25:46,437 --> 01:25:49,355
WE LIVED AS OUTCASTS
IN THE WESTERN WOODS.

784
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:53,000
SHE DIED WITHIN A YEAR.

785
01:25:57,504 --> 01:25:59,971
MY SISTER AND I REMAINED
IN OUR REFUGE,

786
01:26:00,039 --> 01:26:03,591
SEEING NOT A SOUL.

787
01:26:03,593 --> 01:26:08,411
UNTIL ONE DAY,
WHILST GATHERING FIREWOOD,

788
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:11,580
<i>WE CROSSED THE PATH
OF THE HESSIAN.</i>

789
01:26:11,648 --> 01:26:13,965
- SHH.
- [Twig Snaps]

790
01:26:15,417 --> 01:26:18,503
I SAW HIS DEATH.

791
01:26:18,571 --> 01:26:21,955
AT THAT MOMENT, I OFFERED
MY SOUL TO SATAN...

792
01:26:22,023 --> 01:26:27,659
<i>IF HE WOULD RAISE THE HESSIAN
FROM THE GRAVE TO AVENGE ME.</i>

793
01:26:30,897 --> 01:26:34,197
- AVENGE YOU?
- AGAINST VAN GARRETT.

794
01:26:34,265 --> 01:26:37,600
THE LANDLORD WHO SHOWED US NO
MERCY AND LEFT US TO STARVE...

795
01:26:37,668 --> 01:26:40,391
WHILST BALTUS VAN TASSEL
AND HIS SIMPERING

796
01:26:40,417 --> 01:26:42,696
WIFE AND GIRL CHILD
STOLE OUR HOME.

797
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:46,340
I SWORE I WOULD MAKE MYSELF
MISTRESS OF ALL HE HAD.

798
01:26:46,408 --> 01:26:49,108
THE EASIEST PART WAS THE FIRST.

799
01:26:49,176 --> 01:26:51,611
TO ENTER YOUR HOUSE
AS YOUR MOTHER'S SICK NURSE,

800
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:55,280
AND PUT HER BODY INTO THE GRAVE
AND MY OWN INTO THE MARRIAGE BED.

801
01:26:55,348 --> 01:26:59,918
NOT QUITE SO EASY
WAS TO SECURE MY LEGACY.

802
01:26:59,985 --> 01:27:02,653
THE WIDOW HAD TO GO,
OF COURSE,

803
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,954
AND THE SERVANT MASBATH.

804
01:27:05,022 --> 01:27:08,791
AND JUST THE OTHER DAY,
THAT SILLY MIDWIFE, KILLIAN,

805
01:27:08,859 --> 01:27:13,127
TOLD ME THE WIDOW HAD 
TOLD HER A BIG SECRET.

806
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:15,529
AND SHE TOLD ME THIS
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER HUSBAND.

807
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,496
WHAT A GOOSE!

808
01:27:17,564 --> 01:27:20,433
SO, ANOTHER LITTLE JOB
FOR THE HORSEMAN.

809
01:27:23,068 --> 01:27:28,405
BUT LUST DELIVERED THE REVEREND
STEENWYCK INTO MY POWER.

810
01:27:30,074 --> 01:27:33,009
FEAR DID THE SAME
FOR THE NOTARY HARDENBROOK...

811
01:27:33,077 --> 01:27:35,343
AND THE DRUNKARD PHILIPSE.

812
01:27:35,411 --> 01:27:37,947
AND THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE
I EXCHANGED...

813
01:27:38,014 --> 01:27:43,516
FOR MY COMPLICITY IN HIS FORNICATIONS
WITH THE SERVANT GIRL, SARAH.

814
01:27:43,584 --> 01:27:45,886
YES, YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING NOW.

815
01:27:45,954 --> 01:27:50,722
NO! YOU HAVE, MY DEAR,
BY YOUR FATHER'S WILL.

816
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:54,992
I GET EVERYTHING
IN THE EVENT OF YOUR DEATH!

817
01:27:56,327 --> 01:27:58,361
OH, MY SISTER, BY THE WAY,

818
01:27:58,429 --> 01:28:01,898
SADLY PASSED AWAY...

819

HELPING YOU AND YOUR MASTER!
