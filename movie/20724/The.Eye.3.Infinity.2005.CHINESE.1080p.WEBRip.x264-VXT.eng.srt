1
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:05,041
Come on! Look at here!

2
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,541
-What's that?
-So gross!

3
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:44,208
Cool shot!

4
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,666
Are we there already?

5
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,291
Yes! Let's go.

6
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,875
Move!

7
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:03,041
-Funny…
-Why are we stopping here?

8
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,833
Bye.

9
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,166
POH TECK TUNG RESCUE UNIT

10
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:21,833
Oh, shit!

11
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:25,666
-Oh, shit!
-Oh, shit!

12
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,416
Oh, shit! You moron!
How dare you tape that?

13
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,708
-Cut that out!
-Okay!

14
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,625
You heard me!

15
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,291
Give me some!

16
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,541
This is the best time
for telling horror stories.

17
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:09,375
Ever hear about the story
of All Souls' Day?

18
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,875
Depends on which year's
All Souls' Day, right?

19
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,375
Exactly!

20
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,041
This is the one concerning

21
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,666
my friend's uncle who owned a newsstand.

22
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,500
On the last All Souls' Day,
right in his shop, he had

23
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,833
an encounter!

24
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,208
<i>It was just after 4:00 a.m.</i>
<i>It was still dark.</i>

25
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>He was stacking the papers like usual.</i>

26
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,125
Hi there, Mr. Chan!

27
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:41,541
Do me a favor!

28
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,958
Call an ambulance!

29
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:48,875
Granny here,
she said she's not feeling well.

30
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,541
How about that? Scary?

31
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,041
Hell no! Listen to mine!

32
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,583
This story happened to the god-sister
of my friend's brother.

33
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,875
They lived at the apartments for firemen.

34
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:30,375
It was one evening two years ago.

35
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,375
<i>It was cold…</i>

36
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,791
about eight degrees Celsius.

37
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:37,666
This god-sister slept until 2:00 a.m.,

38
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,833
<i>then she heard people drilling outside.</i>

39
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,208
She thought, "How strange!

40
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:55,583
It's far too cold and too early
for the firemen to be drilling."

41
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,041
<i>So, she got up to take a look.</i>

42
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,541
Too bad she did because…

43
00:09:27,666 --> 00:09:30,250
One of the Japanese soldiers spotted her.

44
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,291
He yelled at her,

45
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,208
pulled out his samurai sword
and charged right at her!

46
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,458
Was the girl killed?

47
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:42,583
No. But she went nuts afterwards.

48
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:46,500
Listen! There is this true story.
It's super gross!

49
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,625
A friend of mine was
listening to a ghost story,

50
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,416
and she died choking!

51
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,333
Cut down the snacks, or you'll die!

52
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,208
-Come on!
-Cheers!

53
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:02,916
-Cheers!
-Yeah!

54
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,916
Your horror stories
don't involve you personally.

55
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,125
Frankly, did any of you
have an encounter before?

56
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,791
You guys should read more often!

57
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,875
{\an8}10 WAYS TO SEE… GHOSTS

58
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,708
-What's that?
-What?

59
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,416
This is about the 10 ways

60
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,875
to encounter ghosts.
It's from ancient Thai legends.

61
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:41,500
You can't find this book just anywhere.

62
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,666
<i>One evening, I took the wrong bus,</i>
<i>then got off at the wrong stop.</i>

63
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,541
<i>A book store was still open,</i>
<i>so, I went in for directions.</i>

64
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:07,166
Anyone in? Hello?

65
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:33,000
THE TEN ENCOUNTERS

66
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,791
{\an8}THIRD WAY TO SEE A GHOST - OUIJA

67
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:59,208
Pay first, and read later…

68
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,833
How much is it?

69
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,041
It's karma that brought you to this book.

70
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,250
I'll give you a discount, then.

71
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,583
How about 500 baht?

72
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,958
You must be kidding!

73
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,583
Too cheap?

74
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:20,750
Then pay me the full price!

75
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,833
Here's your 500.

76
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,041
Listen up, kiddo.

77
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,541
Don't ever turn to
the last page of the book.

78
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,375
Or else, misfortune will come to you!

79
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,833
You'll regret it if you don't believe me!

80
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,291
<i>Still, I cannot avoid misfortune!</i>

81
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,291
Don't you ever turn to the last page!

82
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,958
{\an8}"Price: 100 baht."

83
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:26,333
"Discount Price: 50 baht?" Bastard!

84
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:27,750
Moron!

85
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,375
Even an old man can fool you!

86
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,375
Man, this book was the real thing.
The rituals were authentic.

87
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,375
And I can tell you about two cases
to back it up!

88
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:42,416
The first one was
"the condemned cornea transplant".

89
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:49,083
The second one was for women only.
To attempt suicide while pregnant!

90
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,666
I think I've heard about
these two cases before.

91
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,541
Me too.

92
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,500
You see?

93
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:05,291
What's this? Yoga?

94
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:09,541
It's "Between-the-Knees Peek",
a Thai custom still practiced today!

95
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,291
Chongkwai. What are the other ways?

96
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,333
Let me see.

97
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,416
Comb your hair at midnight,

98
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,125
and the ghost you desire
will appear in the mirror.

99
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,333
Next.

100
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Jesus. Something is wrong with his eyes?

101
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,041
The book says,
rub the graveyard soil over your eyes,

102
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,291
and you'll be exposed to
the world of the spirits!

103
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,750
Aren't there any simpler and safer ways?

104
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,875
Sure! Here's a simpler way.

105
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:43,125
Open an umbrella indoors.
You'll score for sure!

106
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:50,666
So, if we follow the instructions,
we'll get to see ghosts for sure?

107
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:52,708
It depends.

108
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,125
Different players have
different success rates.

109
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,208
Why not try it out, then?

110
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,083
Damn right!

111
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,500
We need a game to get through the night!

112
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:09,375
Why not? Given that
there are different success rates,

113
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,708
we might not get
to see them at all, right?

114
00:15:13,458 --> 00:15:15,375
Right.

115
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,291
Then listen carefully.
Once the game has started,

116
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:23,000
we can't quit playing,
no matter what happens.

117
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,125
Or else, misfortune will come to us.

118
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,958
You've heard me. Now, let's begin!

119
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,666
Let's try the most convenient way!

120
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,291
The Thai "Spirits in a Glass"

121
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,625
is like the Chinese Plate Genie
and the Westerner's Ouija Board.

122
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,625
THE SPIRITS IN A GLASS

123
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,000
They are all alike.

124
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:46,583
That is, they all invite a ghost
to spell out his messages.

125
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,625
-Shit, it's moving.
-You moron! That's not funny!

126
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,500
-God. It's here!
-Stop shuffling!

127
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:37,375
"Reak…

128
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,333
chan…

129
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:44,958
ma…

130
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,750
tum…

131
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,250
mai."

132
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,500
Why are you calling me?

133
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,291
Hey!

134
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:04,375
Fuck you!

135
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,125
Mom! Why are you still up?

136
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,875
You're scaring my friends!

137
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:14,166
Serves you right!
You guys are killing my ears!

138
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,333
It's late already! Go to bed now!

139
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,083
Okay, after you.

140
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:22,791
Sorry, guys.

141
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,583
My mom did some heavy channeling
last night.

142
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,541
She needs to rest. We'd better be quiet.

143
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,875
So, your mom is a spiritual medium?
No wonder she looks kind of weird.

144
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,458
THE LATE DINNER ALERT

145
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,958
<i>Thai people believe that</i>

146
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:52,875
<i>where roads cross,</i>
<i>there is a lot of negative power.</i>

147
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:55,333
<i>It's a favorite hangout for stray spirits.</i>

148
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:58,708
<i>To catch a glimpse of them,</i>
<i>go to an intersection after midnight</i>

149
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:03,666
<i>with a meal for three,</i>
<i>and bowls and chopsticks.</i>

150
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,416
<i>Our target, the hungry ghosts.</i>

151
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,125
Hey! Later you tap the bowl
with the chopsticks and…

152
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:12,125
Tap the bowl with the chopsticks,

153
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:14,541
and hungry ghosts will come
out for the food.

154
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,250
Is this really going to work?

155
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,416
Of course! Believe me, it's a sure thing!

156
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,375
When you see them, don't scream, okay?

157
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,916
Look who's talking!
Just don't run away in front of me!

158
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,333
Once you start tapping the bowl,
do not stop!

159
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:31,541
If you stop, the ghosts will see you.

160
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,958
You don't want to risk
being possessed, okay?

161
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:36,791
Let's roll!

162
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,666
What is it?

163
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,083
What's the matter?

164
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,208
Stay cool, keep on tapping.

165
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,958
What did you see?

166
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:36,958
What is it? What's going on?

167
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,125
What did you see?

168
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,916
I didn't see a thing!

169
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,208
-What is it?
-Did you see that?

170
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:46,541
Stay cool!

171
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,125
Keep tapping!

172
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:13,125
What?

173
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,375
-What's wrong?
-What did you see?

174
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,375
-What did you see?
-What now?

175
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,500
I see them!

176
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:25,416
Keep tapping!

177
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,291
Stay cool! Tap!

178
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,583
What's wrong?

179
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,708
Tap!

180
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:29,041
I see nothing!

181
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:31,708
Hey! I didn't get to see anything!

182
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:33,375
What is it that you see, Gofei?

183
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:36,583
-Over there!
-But there's nothing there!

184
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:30,958
It's not fair! Everybody got
to see them except me!

185
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:35,041
Told you we all have
different reception of ghosts.

186
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,625
Maybe you're just the type
who can't see them!

187
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,625
Chongkwai, are there any other ways?
Don't you guys chicken out now!

188
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,125
I've got to see ghosts tonight!

189
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:53,666
PLAYING HIDE N' SEEK

190
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,916
<i>Play Hide n' Seek at midnight</i>
<i>carrying a black cat.</i>

191
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,291
<i>Ghosts will come join us</i>
<i>and block one of us from our view.</i>

192
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,208
<i>We then let go of the black cat.</i>

193
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:05,583
<i>The cat can make the ghost</i>
<i>appear before us.</i>

194
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:10,041
<i>Not only will we find that missing person,</i>
<i>we can also see the ghost.</i>

195
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:50,416
I quit! Come back out! I quit!

196
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:31,541
Papa! What's this stinky water?

197
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,916
Where is he?

198
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,166
What now?

199
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,625
I think a ghost is blocking Gofei.

200
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,333
It's okay. I'm letting the cat go now.

201
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,750
Ebony, lead the way!

202
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:58,541
Gofei! Gofei!

203
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:03,791
Gofei! Gofei!

204
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:11,291
Gofei! Gofei!

205
00:28:19,458 --> 00:28:22,041
Gofei! Gofei!

206
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,541
-Gofei!
-Over there!

207
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:53,291
Ebony seems dead!

208
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,208
Even the cat is dead?

209
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,041
What do we do now? What happened to Gofei?

210
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,458
What do we do? Where the hell is he?

211
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,083
-Gofei!
-Gofei!

212
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,708
Gofei, we quit the game! Come back out!

213
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,000
Gofei, call it off!

214
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:17,166
-Gofei!
-Gofei!

215
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,291
-Gofei!
-Gofei!

216
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:27,791
Gofei!

217
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:33,041
-Gofei!
-Gofei!

218
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,666
Gofei!

219
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:46,458
Gofei!

220
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,625
Gofei!

221
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:08,083
Hello? Gofei! Gofei!? Hello?

222
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:18,541
April, you okay?
The phone didn't even ring!

223
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,083
No, it did ring!

224
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,916
Don't worry too much!
The police will stay on it.

225
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,083
We will find Gofei for sure!

226
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:44,208
It's all your fault.

227
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,750
You'd better go back to Hong Kong first.

228
00:30:56,166 --> 00:31:00,916
The police might not be
able to help this time.

229
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,125
-But, Auntie--
-Just listen to me.

230
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,166
Leave while you still can.

231
00:31:05,625 --> 00:31:08,916
Someone could be setting you up.

232
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,125
I don't think you can defend yourselves!

233
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,458
THE SPECIAL EYE MASK

234
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:51,291
April!

235
00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:56,291
-Don't!
-April! April, are you okay?

236
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,375
April! Close your eyes,
don't open them, not now!

237
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:04,541
Close them tight. Listen to me!

238
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:08,291
You'll be in trouble if you open them now!

239
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,708
We're here for you! You'll be okay!

240
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,333
Hold on for just one more second.

241
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,458
Okay, now, you can open your eyes.

242
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,875
-Hey, April!
-April, you all right?

243
00:33:24,958 --> 00:33:26,791
It hurts!

244
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:33,708
It was so scary! My eyes, they fell out!

245
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:35,666
No way.

246
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:38,958
Your eyes are still there.

247
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:42,500
Don't worry, everything's okay now!

248
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:48,916
You guys were lucky to save her in time!

249
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:54,208
She almost slipped into the spirit world!

250
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:57,208
If she did, she'd be trapped forever!

251
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:05,833
Chongkwai! You should know
better not to play with fire!

252
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,583
You're not a child anymore!

253
00:34:08,125 --> 00:34:11,916
What did Auntie say?
Does she know where Gofei is?

254
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,000
My mom blamed me for teaching you
the use of graveyard soil.

255
00:34:17,666 --> 00:34:20,708
I nearly caused you to be
trapped in the spirit world.

256
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:22,916
I'm so sorry.

257
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,125
I never thought things
would turn out like this!

258
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:30,375
There're too many things
that you don't know.

259
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:33,000
There are other dimensions in this world!

260
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:35,541
Do you understand?

261
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:38,958
Apart from our human world,

262
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:42,333
there are numerous unknown dimensions.

263
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:47,458
April was lucky
not to slip into the other world.

264
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:53,041
When I was a kid, I saw this young woman.

265
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:56,958
<i>She entered that world by mistake.</i>

266
00:34:57,041 --> 00:35:00,625
Let me out!

267
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,791
Now you know!

268
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:17,791
Always stay away from black magic.

269
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:20,208
When things get out of hand,

270
00:35:20,291 --> 00:35:23,875
you won't be able to
survive the consequences.

271
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,833
But where is Gofei now?

272
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:31,583
Who knows?

273
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,375
Just don't stay here!
Go back to Hong Kong now!

274
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:44,208
No! I won't leave without Gofei!

275
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:56,375
Cousin.

276
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,708
Wouldn't it be kind of low
if we just leave?

277
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:05,666
If we leave, yes, it is low.

278
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:08,916
Then we shouldn't do it!

279
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,083
But then… the cab is here already.

280
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:21,666
Low or not low,
we can discuss that on the way!

281
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:30,625
Scumbags! How could they
ditch April like this?

282
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:33,000
You call them your friends?

283
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:40,583
<i>I didn't talk to Ted after</i>
<i>we were back to Hong Kong.</i>

284
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:42,791
<i>He didn't call me, either.</i>

285
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:47,583
<i>Maybe he just wants to</i>
<i>forget about what happened.</i>

286
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:53,041
<i>Me too. But I know it's not possible.</i>

287
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:58,416
<i>For the first two weeks,</i>
<i>Chongkwai did call.</i>

288
00:37:00,375 --> 00:37:02,625
<i>I didn't dare ask him about April, though.</i>

289
00:37:05,583 --> 00:37:08,041
<i>I wonder how she is now…</i>

290
00:38:01,708 --> 00:38:05,291
<i>I pretend everything's normal.</i>
<i>I go to school.</i>

291
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,791
<i>I play, I eat, I go out.</i>

292
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:14,333
<i>Damn right, everything is normal.</i>

293
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,625
<i>So, why am I pretending?</i>

294
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,041
Mister!

295
00:41:50,666 --> 00:41:52,958
Anyone in?

296
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:09,375
THE TEN ENCOUNTERS

297
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:38,000
THE SPIRITS IN A GLASS

298
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,875
This man has got to have
something to do with Gofei!

299
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:20,833
He even drew the five of us
playing the damn game!

300
00:43:20,916 --> 00:43:22,458
Bonehead!

301
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:25,375
It's obvious that
he's cast a spell on all of you!

302
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:29,958
You guys just can't overcome this
on your own!

303
00:48:06,375 --> 00:48:09,750
What's wrong with you? It's only a ball!

304
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,541
{\an8}THE BETWEEN-THE-KNEES PEEK

305
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,083
It's disturbing! Answer it!
Maybe it's urgent!

306
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:38,625
Okay!

307
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:44,291
Teddy? This time, I really saw it!

308
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,416
You saw ghosts again?
Where was it this time?

309
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:50,125
Right outside my front door!

310
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:54,291
Have a drink, and you won't remember it.

311
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:58,958
<i>Don't play dumb anymore, it's no use!</i>
<i>There is a ghost playing ball outside!</i>

312
00:51:59,041 --> 00:52:01,833
<i>-Just come over now!</i>
-Are you sure?

313
00:52:01,916 --> 00:52:03,083
<i>Hundred percent!</i>

314
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:06,791
<i>I did the Between-the-Knees Peek</i>
<i>bending over and I saw him!</i>

315
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:08,375
<i>I am so very sure!</i>

316
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,291
Then, I…

317
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,875
Cut the crap and come over now!

318
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:14,291
Okay, I will.

319
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:17,625
-Well, I must go.
-Where are you going?

320
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,000
Hello?

321
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:27,166
<i>May? It's Chongkwai! April has vanished!</i>

322
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,583
What?

323
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:32,625
<i>Already two people among us</i>
<i>have disappeared.</i>

324
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,125
<i>My mom wants you guys to be careful!</i>

325
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,041
Why is it still so crowded
so late at night?

326
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:38,625
UNIT 12C

327
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:53,875
Mister, have you seen my report card?

328
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:56,791
You little damn thing!

329
00:55:06,583 --> 00:55:09,125
Sorry. I thought you were a ghost!

330
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:12,000
Don't cry. I'm sorry!

331
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,458
So, what if there are ghosts?

332
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,041
Messing with us?

333
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:29,500
What are you doing?

334
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:32,208
Where am I?

335
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:35,833
It's dangerous here.

336
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,083
Teddy!

337
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:47,291
Thank God you're here!

338
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:52,958
Don't cry. Come sit down first.

339
01:00:59,083 --> 01:01:01,791
We are dead meat.

340
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,291
I see ghosts all the time!

341
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:07,875
Our problem has not ended
just there in Thailand.

342
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:11,916
Remember what Chongkwai said?
Once we've started the game,

343
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:16,333
we just can't quit playing
until it's all over!

344
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:22,666
Looks like we must return to Thailand
before we can settle everything.

345
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:32,500
Where's that girl?

346
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:34,625
What are you looking for?

347
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:38,750
My friend, the girl who came in with me!
The one from Thailand!

348
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:41,750
We shared the same bus ride
together, remember?

349
01:01:42,875 --> 01:01:45,750
It's okay, now! Come out!

350
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,125
I think I only saw you

351
01:01:49,208 --> 01:01:52,000
coming in alone!

352
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,375
Why are you watching these tapes?

353
01:03:11,041 --> 01:03:13,416
Don't tell me…

354
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,750
she's here.

355
01:03:22,375 --> 01:03:24,916
But I can't see her now.

356
01:03:28,291 --> 01:03:33,333
Wanna try and look between your legs?

357
01:03:36,666 --> 01:03:38,541
But how?

358
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:43,250
Bend over.

359
01:04:24,166 --> 01:04:25,208
Hey!

360
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:11,750
We shouldn't be doing this!
It's too risky!

361
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:16,083
Our lives are at stake, anyway!
This method could be our last resort!

362
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:21,083
Cousin, let's think it over!

363
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:24,291
You're not in this with me, right?
Suit yourself!

364
01:07:24,375 --> 01:07:26,083
Wait!

365
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:30,333
That's not what I mean. I'm in.

366
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:43,500
THE LAST FRONTIER

367
01:07:43,708 --> 01:07:46,583
DEATH

368
01:07:56,666 --> 01:07:57,875
<i>To advance your death,</i>

369
01:07:58,125 --> 01:08:02,083
<i>you have to play dead</i>
<i>wearing a used funeral suit,</i>

370
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:04,750
<i>and then you can</i>
<i>infiltrate the spirit world.</i>

371
01:08:05,333 --> 01:08:09,083
<i>Your time there is limited</i>
<i>and you must leave on time.</i>

372
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:13,375
<i>Once you hear me ringing a bell,</i>
<i>enter the stream of white light!</i>

373
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:17,500
<i>It's your only way out.</i>
<i>Don't delay, or you'll never get back!</i>

374
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,625
Damn…

375
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:37,375
I still can't fall asleep.

376
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,000
What a drag.

377
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:46,625
Then let me help you!

378
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:59,875
-Where are we?
-Don't know.

379
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:11,958
Damn…

380
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:15,291
-I'm kind of scared.
-I…

381
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:17,541
I'm scared, too!

382
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,125
Wait! A ghost!

383
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,041
But he is smiling!

384
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:25,416
That's right! Chongkwai said,

385
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:28,875
if we don't meddle with them,
they won't bother us!

386
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,541
This one is kind of cute!

387
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:37,375
Hey, they seem quite friendly, too!

388
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:40,875
There!

389
01:09:41,416 --> 01:09:43,875
There!

390
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Up there!

391
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,708
Something's not right!
It's getting crowded here!

392
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:16,125
And they aren't smiling,
not so friendly anymore, either.

393
01:10:22,083 --> 01:10:24,041
Quick, think of something!

394
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:29,291
I can't!

395
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:34,625
Didn't Chongkwai say that ghosts are
afraid of the smell of our breath?

396
01:10:34,708 --> 01:10:37,041
-He said that?
-Well…

397
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:44,458
It works!

398
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,625
Man, you stink!

399
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:46,958
Get up! Let's go!

400
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,583
They've stopped hunting us.

401
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:13,875
-How are you doing, Ted?
-I need to rest!

402
01:12:13,958 --> 01:12:15,458
So do I.

403
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,416
Be careful, cousin!

404
01:12:30,541 --> 01:12:35,458
You found me, how boring! I quit!

405
01:12:37,291 --> 01:12:39,041
Gofei!

406
01:12:40,125 --> 01:12:42,458
Thank God you're all right!
We've finally found you!

407
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,375
Calm down, girl!
You haven't seen me for only an hour!

408
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:47,791
Where were you guys?

409
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:50,708
-Listen! You were gone for a month!
-A month?

410
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:51,958
We messed up!

411
01:12:52,041 --> 01:12:55,500
A ghost has blocked you
from our view all this while.

412
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:59,750
We played dead to come here
for you in the spirit world.

413
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:06,416
This is… the spirit world?

414
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,416
Yes!

415
01:13:13,916 --> 01:13:17,625
It's all over! I'm pooped.

416
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,166
Same here.

417
01:13:20,541 --> 01:13:22,583
Gofei, you're new here.

418
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:26,375
-Greet them with your breath!
-My breath?

419
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:27,416
Yes!

420
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,708
What do you mean?

421
01:13:29,916 --> 01:13:32,416
-They're afraid of it.
-But how?

422
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:00,958
I really can't do this anymore!
I'm breathless!

423
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,458
Show them your specialty!
You can still fart, can't you?

424
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,583
<i>Gofei!</i>

425
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:12,125
<i>-Where are you?</i>
-April?

426
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:13,958
<i>-I've come to stay with you!</i>
-April?

427
01:14:14,041 --> 01:14:17,666
<i>-Gofei!</i>
-It's April! April! I'm here!!!

428
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,208
<i>Gofei? Is that you?</i>

429
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:21,291
Yes! It's April!

430
01:14:21,375 --> 01:14:22,333
Yes! It's April!

431
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:26,333
-Gofei!
-April!

432
01:14:26,541 --> 01:14:29,375
Come with me now! Hurry!

433
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:06,291
-You hear that?
-I do!

434
01:15:06,375 --> 01:15:08,625
Do you hear that? We are safe now!

435
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,125
-It's Chongkwai!
-It is!

436
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:11,541
What about him?

437
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:15,208
He said, run to the white light once
we hear the bell, and we'd be out!

438
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:17,000
-Really?
-Yes!

439
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:20,458
There it is! Let's go to the light now!

440
01:15:20,541 --> 01:15:23,041
What white light? What bell?

441
01:15:23,125 --> 01:15:25,625
How come I don't hear or see any of these?

442
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:31,208
How did you get here?

443
01:15:40,625 --> 01:15:44,583
Gofei, I thought you were dead.

444
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,000
That's why I…

445
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,500
Mom! We're running out of time!
Do something!

446
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,833
Cousin, what do we do now?
Are we leaving or not?

447
01:17:22,458 --> 01:17:23,916
Hey!

448
01:17:31,083 --> 01:17:33,333
You guys go ahead! I'm staying!

449
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:45,375
Just go!

450
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:49,166
-Hurry!
-May!

451
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:54,041
May!

452
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,916
May!

453
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:12,083
-Auntie!
-Chongkwai!

454
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,416
-Chongkwai!
-Auntie!

455
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:06,708
Teddy!

456
01:20:30,875 --> 01:20:35,333
I told you.
This is a curse you can't overcome!

457
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,708
Interested in this book?

458
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:32,375
What if I give you
a discount? You like that?
