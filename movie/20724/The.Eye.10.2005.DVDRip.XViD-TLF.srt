1
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,701
- What's that?! - Very gross!

2
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:42,440
- Wow! - Cool shot!

3
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,511
Are we there already?

4
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,677
Yes! Let's go

5
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:51,512
Move!

6
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,630
Funny...

7
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,928
Why do we stop here?

8
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,368
Bye

9
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:25,417
Oh, shit!

10
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,428
Oh, shit! You moron!
How dare you taping this?

11
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,362
- Cut that out! - Okay, okay

12
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,475
You heard me!

13
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:56,882
Give me some

14
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,951
This is the best time for horror stories

15
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,754
Ever heard about the story
of the All Souls' Day?

16
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,056
Depends on which year's
All Souls' Day, right?

17
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,195
Exactly!

18
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,329
There is this one concerning...

19
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,136
...my friend's uncle who owns a newsstand

20
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,831
On the last All Souls' Day and...

21
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,932
right at his stall, he has...

22
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,100
...an encounter!

23
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,942
It was past 4 am.

24
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,306
Still dark

25
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,244
He was piling the papers like usual

26
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:35,854
Hi there, Mr. Chan!

27
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:42,055
Do me a favor!

28
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:44,192
Call an ambulance

29
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,092
Granny here...

30
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,093
She... she said she's not feeling well...

31
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,849
How about that?! Scary?!

32
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,724
Hell no

33
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,226
Listen to mine!

34
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:21,766
This story happened to the god-sister...

35
00:08:21,934 --> 00:08:23,196
...of my friend's brother

36
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,269
They lived at the Jordan Firemen's Quarter

37
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:30,507
It was an evening 2 years ago

38
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,568
It was cold...

39
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,377
...about 8 degrees Celsius

40
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,149
The god-sister slept till 2am...

41
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:42,042
...only to hear people drilling outside

42
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,524
She thought... how strange

43
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,322
It's far too cold and early...

44
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,798
...for the firemen to drill now

45
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,995
So she got up to take a look

46
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:17,213
Too bad she did

47
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,048
Because...!

48
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:30,364
One of the Japanese soldiers spotted her

49
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,728
He yelled at her...

50
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,305
pulled out his samurai sword and...

51
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,538
...charged right at her!

52
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:38,875
Was the girl killed?

53
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,546
Nah

54
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,874
She went nuts afterwards though

55
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,343
Listen!

56
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,917
There is this true story, super gross!

57
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,546
A friend of mine was listening to
a ghost story and...

58
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:52,680
She died choking!

59
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,689
Cut down the snack or you'll die!

60
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,267
Come on! Cheers... cheers!

61
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,337
Your horror stories are all second-handed

62
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,409
Frankly, 'ever had an encounter before?

63
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,843
You guys should read more often!

64
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,422
What's that?

65
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,360
Huh?

66
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,123
This is the 10 ways...

67
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,394
...to encounter ghosts
from Thai's ancient rites

68
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,636
You can't find this book just anywhere

69
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,566
One evening, I took the wrong bus

70
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:46,736
Then got off at the wrong stop

71
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,146
A book store was still open

72
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,247
So I went in for directions

73
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,190
Anyone in? Hello?

74
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,585
THE TEN ENCOUNTERS

75
00:11:55,281 --> 00:12:00,378
Pay first and read later... hmm...

76
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,316
How much is it?

77
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,089
It's karma that brings you to this book

78
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,127
I'll give you a discount then

79
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,158
How about 500 bahts?

80
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,697
You must be kidding!

81
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,294
Too cheap, aye?

82
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:23,038
Then pay me the full price

83
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,101
Here's your 500

84
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,307
Listen up, kiddo

85
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,542
Don't you ever turn to the last page
of the book

86
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,377
Or else misfortune will come to you!

87
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,421
You'll regret it if you don't believe me!

88
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,798
Still, I cannot avoid misfortune!

89
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,967
Don't you ever turn to the last page!

90
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:20,925
Fix Price: 100 bahts

91
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,696
Sale Price: 50 baths? Bastard!

92
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,967
Moron...

93
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:30,905
Even an old man can fool you!

94
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,712
Men, this book is no bullshit though

95
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,403
The rituals are authentic

96
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,049
And I have 2 real-live cases on hand
to back it up!

97
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,087
The first one is
'the condemned cornea transplant'

98
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,024
The second one is for...

99
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,660
...women only
- to attempt suicide while pregnant!

100
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,096
I think...

101
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:57,291
...I've heard these 2 cases previously

102
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,137
Me too...

103
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,831
You see?

104
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,001
What's this? Yoga?

105
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:10,171
It's "Peek-a-stoop",
a Thai custom still practiced today!

106
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,077
Chongkwai

107
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,740
What are the other ways?

108
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,645
Let me see

109
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,318
Comb your hair at midnight and...

110
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,685
...the ghost you desire will appear
in the mirror

111
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,288
Next

112
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,895
Gees... something wrong with his eyes?

113
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,956
The book says

114
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,033
Smudge the graveyard soil
over your eyes and...

115
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,965
...you'll be exposed to the world
of the spirits!

116
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,370
Aren't there any... simpler and safer ways?

117
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,835
Sure! Simpler way...

118
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,037
Open an umbrella indoors

119
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,613
You'll score for sure!

120
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,611
So you mean

121
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,983
If we follow the instructions

122
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,248
...we'll get to see ghosts for sure

123
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,517
It depends

124
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:54,353
Different players have...

125
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,790
...different success rates

126
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,664
Why not try it out then?

127
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,931
Damn right!

128
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,966
We sure need a game to get through the night!

129
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,672
Well... why not?!

130
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,132
Given there are different success rates...

131
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,869
...we might not get to see them after all, right?

132
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,579
...Right

133
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,483
Then listen carefully

134
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,846
Once the game has started

135
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,315
You can't quit playing no matter what happens

136
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,617
Or else, misfortune will come to you

137
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:28,853
You've heard me

138
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,222
Now let's begin!

139
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:34,355
Let's try the most convenient way!

140
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,199
A GLASS OF SPIRIT

141
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,225
Thai's "A Glass of Spirit"...

142
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,237
Chinese's "Plate Genie" & "Witchy Board"
of the West...

143
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,772
...are all alike

144
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:46,708
That is: Invite a ghost
to spell out his messages

145
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,607
Gees... it's moving...

146
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,115
You moron! That's not funny!

147
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,115
- God... it's here! - Stop shuffling!

148
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,393
Reak...

149
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:42,096
chan...

150
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:45,701
ma...

151
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:49,702
tum...

152
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,140
mai...

153
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:55,645
- Why are you calling me? - Ah!

154
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:57,841
Hey!

155
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,154
Mom! Why are you still up?

156
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,861
You're scaring my friends!

157
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,860
Serves you right!

158
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,030
You guys are killing my ears!

159
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:18,229
It's late already! Go to bed now!

160
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,131
Okay, after you

161
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:23,630
Sorry guys

162
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,767
My mom did some heavy channeling last night

163
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,106
She needs to rest... we'd better be quiet

164
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,048
So your mom is a spiritual medium?!

165
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,845
No wonder she looks kind of weird

166
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,289
Late Dinner Alert

167
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,797
Thai people believe that...

168
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,903
...crossroads emit a lot of negative power

169
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,903
They are the favorite hangouts for stray spirits

170
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,905
To catch a glimpse of them

171
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:01,138
Go to an intersection after midnight with...

172
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,480
...a meal for 3, bowls and chopsticks

173
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,411
Our target...

174
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,915
...the hungry ghosts

175
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,247
Tap the bowl with chopsticks and...

176
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,292
...hungry ghosts will come for the food

177
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,258
Is it really going to work?

178
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,425
Of course! Believe me, sure thing!

179
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,533
When you see them, don't scream, huh!

180
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,862
Look who's talking! Just don't flee before me!

181
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,269
Once you start tapping the bowl, do not stop!

182
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,703
If you stop, the ghosts will see you

183
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,179
You don't want to risk being possessed, okay?

184
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,339
Let's roll!

185
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,783
What is it?

186
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,111
What's the matter?

187
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,423
Stay cool, keep on tapping

188
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:24,626
What did you see?

189
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:37,068
What is it?! What's going on?!

190
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:41,877
What did you see?

191
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,077
I didn't see a thing!

192
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,015
- What is it? - Did you see that?

193
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:47,683
Stay cool...!

194
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,215
Keep tapping!

195
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,043
What?!

196
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,512
- What's wrong? - What did you see?

197
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,150
- What did you see? - What now?

198
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,612
...I see "them"!

199
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,986
Keep tapping!

200
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,168
Stay cool! Tap!

201
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:04,792
What's wrong?!

202
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,868
Tap!

203
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,375
I see nothing!

204
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,917
Hey! I didn't get to see anything!

205
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:34,517
What is it that you see, Gofei?

206
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,879
- Over there! - But there's nothing there!

207
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,006
It's not fair!
Everybody got to see it except me!

208
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,309
Told you we all have different reception
of ghosts

209
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:39,707
Maybe you're just the type
who can't see them!

210
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,847
Chongkwai, are there any other ways?

211
00:23:45,323 --> 00:23:46,722
Don't you guys chicken out now!

212
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,321
I've got to see ghosts tonight!

213
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:55,688
HIDE N' SEEK

214
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:58,862
Play Hide n' Seek at midnight
carrying a black cat

215
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,494
Ghosts will come join us and...

216
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,970
...block one of us from our view

217
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,401
We then let go of the black cat

218
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,577
The cat can make the ghost appear before us

219
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:08,971
So, not only will we find that missing person

220
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:10,814
We can also... see the ghost!

221
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,813
I quit! Come back out!

222
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:51,883
I quit!

223
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,179
Papa! What's this stinky water? Papa...

224
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,349
Where is he?

225
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,454
What now?

226
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,928
I think a ghost is blocking Kofei

227
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,930
It's okay, it's okay...
I'm letting the cat go now

228
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:55,673
Ebony, lead the way!

229
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:05,176
Kofei! Kofei!

230
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,668
- Kofei! - Over there!

231
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,824
Ebony... seems... dead!

232
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,829
Even the cat is dead?

233
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,463
What do we do now?!
What happened to Kofei?!

234
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,599
What do we do?! Where the hell is he?!

235
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,709
- Kofei! - Kofei!

236
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,511
Kofei, we quit the game! Come back out!

237
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,778
Kofei, call it off!

238
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:29,801
- Kofei! - Kofei!

239
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,001
Kofei!

240
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,680
Kofei!

241
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,206
Hello? Kofei! Kofei!? Hello?

242
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:20,147
April, you okay? The phone didn't even ring!

243
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,353
No, it did ring!

244
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:33,626
Don' worry too much! The police will follow

245
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,596
We will find Kofei for sure!

246
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,036
It's all you fault

247
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:57,418
You'd better go back to Hong Kong first

248
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:02,192
The police might not be able to help this time

249
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:04,962
- But auntie... - Just listen to me

250
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,928
Leave while you still can

251
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,165
Someone could be setting you up

252
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,564
I don't think you can defend yourselves!

253
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:26,775
THE EYE MASK

254
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,396
April!

255
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,128
Don't!

256
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,967
April!

257
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,199
April, are you okay?

258
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:04,438
April! Close your eyes,
don't open them, not now!

259
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,640
Close them tight... listen to me!

260
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,218
You'll be in trouble if you open them now!

261
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:12,712
We're here for you! You'll be okay!

262
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,324
Hold on for just one more sec

263
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,501
Okay, now you can open your eyes

264
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,535
- Hey, April! - April, 'you all right?

265
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:27,963
It hurts!

266
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:35,639
It was so scary! My eyes, they fell out!

267
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,972
No way

268
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,181
Your eyes are still there

269
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,011
Don't worry, everything's okay now!

270
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,988
You guys were only lucky to save her in time!

271
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:56,491
She almost slipped into the limbo world!

272
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:58,795
If she did, she'd be trapped forever!

273
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:07,371
Chongkwai!
You should know better not to play with fire!

274
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,573
You're not a child anymore!

275
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,345
What did auntie say?

276
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,645
Does she know where Kofei is?

277
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,146
My mom blamed me for teaching you...

278
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:18,952
...the usage of graveyard soil

279
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,489
I nearly caused you trapped in the limbo world

280
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,454
I'm so sorry

281
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,623
I never thought things would turn out like this!

282
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,632
There're too many things that you don't notice

283
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,965
There are other dimensions in this world!

284
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,733
Do you understand?

285
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,810
Apart from our human world...

286
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:44,539
...there are numerous unknown dimensions

287
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,780
April was lucky not to slip into the limbo world

288
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:55,558
When I was a kid, I saw this young woman

289
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:58,695
She entered the limbo world by mistake

290
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,188
Let me out! Let me out!

291
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,807
Now you know!

292
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,882
Always stay away from black magic

293
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,949
When things get out of hand...

294
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:25,917
...you won't be able to
survive the consequences

295
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,785
But where is Kofei now?

296
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,994
Who knows?

297
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,832
Just don't stay here!
Go back to Hong Kong now!

298
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:46,037
No, I won't! I won't leave without Kofei!

299
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,015
Cous

300
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:01,590
Wouldn't it be kind of low if we leave?

301
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,521
If we leave, yes, it is low

302
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,759
Then we shouldn't do this!

303
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,002
But then...

304
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,301
...the cab is here already

305
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:23,406
Low or not low...
we can discuss that on the way!

306
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,989
Scumbags!
How could they ditch April like this?!

307
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,419
You call them your friends?!

308
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,689
I didn't talk to Ted
after we're back to Hong Kong

309
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,192
He didn't call me either

310
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,770
Maybe he just wants to forget
about what happened

311
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:52,539
Me too

312
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,941
But I know it's not possible

313
00:36:56,747 --> 00:37:00,615
For the first two weeks, Chongkwai did call

314
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,716
I didn't dare ask him about April though

315
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,416
I wonder how she is now...

316
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:08,042
I pretend everything's normal... I go to school

317
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,052
I play, I eat, I went out

318
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:16,120
Damn right, everything is normal

319
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:17,820
So what am I pretending?

320
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,460
Mister!

321
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:54,506
Anyone in?

322
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:11,854
"The Ten Encounters"...

323
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,556
A GLASS OF SPIRIT

324
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,427
That man has gotta have something
to do with Kofei!

325
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,264
He even drew the 5 of us playing
the damn game!

326
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,762
Bonehead!

327
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:27,899
It's obvious that he's cast a spell on all of you!

328
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:32,338
You guys just can't overcome this on your own!

329
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:14,910
Midnite comb

330
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:44,672
THE FORBIDDEN shade

331
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,180
What's wrong with you?!

332
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,984
It's only a ball!

333
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:41,533
Peek-a-stoop

334
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,226
It's disturbing! Just answer it!
Maybe it's urgent!

335
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,194
Okay!

336
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,136
Teddy? This time I really saw it!

337
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:50,329
You saw ghosts again? Where is it this time?

338
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,801
Right outside my front door!

339
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,110
Have a drink and you won't remember it

340
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,276
Don't play dumb anymore-it's no use!

341
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,247
There is really a ghost
playing ball right outside!

342
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,714
Just come over now!

343
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:04,911
Are... are you sure?

344
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,214
100 percents!

345
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:09,883
I did the Peek-a-stoop bending over
and I saw "him"!

346
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:11,425
I am so very sure!

347
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:13,462
Then... I... then...

348
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,756
Cut the crap and come over now!

349
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:16,895
Okay, I will

350
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:18,895
Well, I must go...

351
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,530
Where' you going?

352
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:30,077
May? It's Chongkwai! April has vanished!

353
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:32,180
What?

354
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,741
Already 2 people among us have disappeared

355
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:37,877
My mom wants you guys to be careful!

356
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,055
Why is it still so crowded so late at night?

357
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:41,776
Unit 12C

358
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:56,485
Mister, have you seen my report card?

359
00:54:58,828 --> 00:54:59,590
You little damn thing!

360
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:10,933
Sorry

361
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,369
I thought you were a ghost!

362
00:55:12,575 --> 00:55:15,476
Don't cry... I'm sorry!

363
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,023
So what if there are ghosts?

364
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,434
Messing with us?

365
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,720
What' you doing?!

366
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:36,056
Where am I?!

367
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:38,998
It's dangerous here

368
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:47,536
Teddy...!

369
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:52,338
Thank god you're here!

370
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:57,780
Don't cry... come sit down first

371
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,320
We are dead meat

372
01:01:06,062 --> 01:01:07,859
I see ghosts all the time!

373
01:01:08,398 --> 01:01:10,559
Our problem has not ended
just there in Thailand

374
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:13,258
Remember what Chongkwai said?

375
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,496
Once we've started the game

376
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:19,572
We just can't quit playing until it's all over!

377
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,839
Looks like we must return to Thailand...

378
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,107
...before we can settle everything

379
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,920
Ai? Where's that girl?

380
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,124
What are you looking for?

381
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:41,261
My Friend, the girl who came in with me!

382
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,398
The one from Thailand!

383
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:45,328
We share the same ride together, remember?

384
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:48,936
It's okay now! Come out!

385
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,836
I think... I only saw you...

386
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,500
...coming in alone!

387
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:31,139
Why are you watching these tapes?

388
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,891
Don't tell me...

389
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:21,262
...she's here!

390
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:28,226
But... I can't see her now!

391
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:36,477
Wanna try and look between your legs?

392
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:41,981
But how?

393
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,118
BEND-

394
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,351
O-

395
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:46,419
- VER

396
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,163
We shouldn't be doing this! Too risky!

397
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,321
Our lives are at stake anyway!

398
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:20,126
This method could be our last resort!

399
01:07:20,836 --> 01:07:21,962
Cousin

400
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,632
Let's think it over!

401
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,938
You're not in this with me, right? Suit yourself!

402
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:29,669
Wait!

403
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:32,303
That's not what I mean

404
01:07:33,182 --> 01:07:34,308
I'm in

405
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,396
The last frontier

406
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:50,088
Death

407
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:01,940
To advance your death

408
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,274
You have to play dead wearing
a used funeral suit...

409
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,611
...and then you can infiltrate the limbo world

410
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:12,652
Your time there is limited
and you must leave on time

411
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:14,319
Once you hear me ringing a bell...

412
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:17,221
...enter the stream of white light right away!

413
01:08:17,526 --> 01:08:19,756
It's your only way out; don't stall

414
01:08:19,895 --> 01:08:21,192
Or you'd never come back!

415
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,245
Darn...

416
01:08:38,714 --> 01:08:40,841
I still can't fall asleep

417
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:44,509
What a drag...

418
01:08:48,491 --> 01:08:49,583
Well then...

419
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:50,555
...let me help you!

420
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:03,903
- Where are we? - Don't know

421
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:16,077
Darn...

422
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:19,051
- I'm kind of scared - I...

423
01:09:19,555 --> 01:09:21,386
...I'm scared too!

424
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:22,620
Wait!

425
01:09:23,225 --> 01:09:24,283
A ghost!

426
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:27,157
But he is smiling!

427
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:29,757
That's right! Chongkwai said...

428
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:32,366
If we don't meddle with them,
they won't bother us!

429
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,595
This one is kind of cute!

430
01:09:38,774 --> 01:09:40,935
Hey, they seem quite friendly too!

431
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,474
There

432
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:46,513
There

433
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,006
Up there!

434
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:16,509
Something's not right!
It's getting crowded here!

435
01:10:17,012 --> 01:10:19,810
And they aren't smiling; not so friendly either

436
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:28,085
Quick, think of something!

437
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,256
Cannot!

438
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:35,992
Has Chongkwai ever said that...

439
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:38,393
...ghosts are afraid of the verve in our breath?

440
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:39,493
He said that?

441
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,330
Well...

442
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:47,937
Gee, it works!

443
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:57,445
Man, you stink!

444
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,203
Get up! Let's go!

445
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,858
They've stopped hunting us

446
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:16,028
How' you doing, Ted?

447
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:17,759
I need to rest!

448
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,499
So do I

449
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:32,912
Be careful, cousin!

450
01:12:34,983 --> 01:12:38,714
You found me, how boring! I quit!

451
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,081
Kofei!

452
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,826
Thank god you're alright!
We've finally found you!

453
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,925
Calm down, girl!
You didn't see me for only an hour!

454
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,026
Where were you guys?

455
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,829
- Listen! You were gone for a month!
- A month?!

456
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,197
We messed up!

457
01:12:56,338 --> 01:13:00,001
A ghost has blocked you
from our view all these while

458
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:04,010
We play dead to come here for you
in the limbo world

459
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:07,114
Huh? This is...

460
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:10,675
This is the limbo world?

461
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:11,786
Yes!

462
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,488
It's all over! I'm darn pooped

463
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:23,325
Same here

464
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:27,126
Kofei, you're new here

465
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,999
Greet them with your breath!

466
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,569
My breath?

467
01:13:30,839 --> 01:13:31,601
Yes!

468
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:32,933
What... do you mean?

469
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:35,473
They're afraid of it

470
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:37,104
But how?

471
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:05,005
I really can't do this anymore! I'm breathless!

472
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:08,638
Show them your specialty!

473
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,870
You can still fart, can't you?

474
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:13,676
Kofei!

475
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,580
- Where are you? - April?

476
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,481
- I've come to stay with you! - April?!

477
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:21,589
- Kofei! - It's April!

478
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:22,815
April! I'm here!

479
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,723
Kofei? Is that you?!

480
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:25,860
Yes! It's April!

481
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:26,893
Yes! It's April!

482
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:28,860
- Kofei! - April!

483
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,330
Come with me now! Hurry!

484
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,336
Don't look back!

485
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:09,904
You hear that?

486
01:15:10,038 --> 01:15:10,800
I do!

487
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:13,237
Do you hear that? We are safe now!

488
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:14,808
- It's Chongkwai! - It is!

489
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:15,773
What about him?

490
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:18,374
He said, run to the white light once
we hear the bell

491
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:19,572
And we'd be out of here!

492
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,305
Really?

493
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:21,312
Yes!

494
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:25,248
There it is! Let's go to the light now!

495
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:26,649
What white light? What bell?

496
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,850
How come I don't hear or see any of these?

497
01:15:33,962 --> 01:15:35,259
How did you come here?

498
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:46,197
Kofei

499
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,467
I thought you were dead

500
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:50,945
That's why I...

501
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,206
Mom! We're running out of time!
Do something!

502
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,229
Cous, what do we do now?
Are we leaving or not?

503
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,207
Hey!

504
