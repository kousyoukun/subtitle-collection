麦克
Michael

17
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:38,753
亲爱的麦克，很显然是你 他们还能派谁过来？
Dear Michael. Of course it's you. Who else could they send?

18
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,252
还有谁值得信任？
Who else could be trusted?

19
00:00:40,423 --> 00:00:43,153
我也知道你大老远地跑来很辛苦，而且 你马上就要开始工作了
And I know it's a long way and you're ready to go to work.

20
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,625
但请听我说，等等、再等等、再… 让我把话说完
All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just... Just please hear me out.

21
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:49,993
因为这不是什么小打小闹，也不是旧病复发 更不是什么胡搅蛮缠
Because this is not an episode, relapse, fuckup.

22
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,726
求你了，麦克，我求求你
I'm begging you, Michael, I'm begging you.

23
00:00:52,903 --> 00:00:55,736
相信我吧，这不仅仅只是疯狂
Try and make believe this is not just madness...

24
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,932
…因为这绝不只是疯狂
...because this is not just madness.

25
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:01,540
两周之前，我从这栋楼里出来，对吧？
Two weeks ago, I came out of the building, okay?

26
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:04,237
我跑过第六大街，有辆车等在那里…
I'm running across 6th Avenue, there's a car waiting...

27
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:07,611
…我必须在38分钟内到达机场，我边走边说
...I got exactly 38 minutes to get to the airport, and I'm dictating.

28
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:10,549
我那慌里慌张的助手也手忙脚乱地在记事本上…
There's this panicked associate sprinting along beside me...

29
00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:13,247
…写个不停，突然她叫了起来
...scribbling in a notepad, and she starts screaming.

30
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:16,359
我猛地意识到我们正站在大街中央…
And I realize we're standing in the middle of the street...

31
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:20,520
…信号一变，汹涌的车辆向我们冲过来
...the light's changed and there's this wall of serious traffic speeding towards us.

32
00:01:20,698 --> 00:01:22,723
我僵住了，无法动弹
And I freeze. I can't move.

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,528
我突然被一种无法抵制的感觉所吞蚀
I'm suddenly consumed with the overwhelming sensation...

34
00:01:25,704 --> 00:01:27,729
…我被些薄膜状的东西盖住了
...that I'm covered with some sort of film.

35
00:01:27,906 --> 00:01:32,502
它粘在我的头发上和脸上，它有点像蛋清 又像是某种涂层
And it's in my hair, in my face. And it's like a glaze, like a coating.

36
00:01:32,678 --> 00:01:35,442
起初我想，“噢，上帝呀，我知道这是什么了
And at first I thought, "Oh, my God, I know what this is.

37
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:38,048
这是羊膜， 是流动的羊水
This is some sort of amniotic, embryonic fluid.

38
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,912
我正处于产后那湿漉漉的时刻
I'm drenched in afterbirth.

39
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:42,748
我刚刚破茧而出，我重生了”
I've breached the chrysalis. I've been reborn."

40
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:46,221
但随后，汹涌的车流、涌动的人群、 轿车、卡车、警笛的尖叫
But then, the traffic, the stampede, the cars, the trucks, the horns...

41
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:50,420
…还有这可怜女人的尖叫，我想，“不　 这不是重生
...this poor woman screaming, and I'm thinking, "No. This is not rebirth.

42
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:53,464
这只是一些恢复过程中的奇妙幻觉
This is some kind of giddy illusion of renewal...

43
00:01:53,633 --> 00:01:56,397
…只是大限将至之前的幻觉”
...that happens in the final moment before death."

44
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:00,165
然后我意识到“不、不、不，这一切都错了”…
And then I realize, "No, no, no, this is completely wrong"...

45
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:03,310
…因为我回头再看那栋大楼…
...because I looked back at the building...

46
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:06,105
…我突然醒悟了
...and I had the most stunning moment of clarity.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,373
麦克，我…我意识到…
I realized, Michael...

48
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:12,576
…我出来了，但不是通过 肯纳、巴赫和莱迪恩的大门…
...that I had emerged, not through the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...

49
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:16,053
不是我们那巨大无比的法律事务所的大门
...not through the portals of our vast and powerful law firm...

50
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:19,022
…而是通过一个有机体的屁眼…
...but from the asshole of an organism...

51
00:02:19,194 --> 00:02:23,824
…这屁眼的唯一功能就是排出有毒物质…
...whose sole function is to excrete the poison...

52
00:02:23,999 --> 00:02:27,366
…弹药和脱叶剂来给那些更大…
...the ammo, the defoliant necessary for other larger...

53
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:31,098
…更强的公司用来摧毁人类文明的奇迹
...more powerful organisms to destroy the miracle of humanity.

54
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:35,142
而在我生命中最美好的时刻…
And that I had been coated in this patina of shit...

55
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,506
…我也被涂上了一层这铜绿色的大便
...for the best part of my life.

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,514
那东西的恶臭和污秽将使我的余生 变得毫无意义
And the stench of it, the stain of it would take the rest of my life to undo.

57
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:42,946
你知道我做了些什么吗？
And you know what I did?

58
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,851
我深深地、彻底地吸了口气，把我那想法 放到一边，我放下了它
I took a deep, cleansing breath and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.

59
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:51,427
我对自已说：“很显然，这种强烈的感觉
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be, as potent a feeling as this is...

60
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:55,793
和我今天见证的东西一样真实，但它需要等待
...as true a thing as I believe that I have witnessed today, it must wait.

61
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:58,434
它必须经受住时间的考验”
It must stand the test of time."

62
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,629
现在，麦克，时候到了
And, Michael, the time is now.

63
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:07,110
我想我能告诉的都已经告诉你了
I'm not sure what else I can tell you that I haven't already.

64
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:09,803
给我讲讲U/North公司的事，巴里 他们可是你们的客户
Tell me about U/North, Barry. They're your clients.

65
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:14,213
告诉我为什么你们大半夜的还在 处理一件已经进行了6年的案子
So you tell me why you're settling a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.

66
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:17,082
因为不管你愿不愿意，我都在报道这件事
Because I'm writing this story whether you like it or not.

67
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:18,587
你到底想怎么样？
What does that exactly mean?

68
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:21,158
给我报点儿料
Give me something I can print.

69
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,930
我们找到了97个
We found 97.

70
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,638
那个《华尔街日报》的婊子打到了我的手机上
I've got that cunt from The Wall Street Journal on my cell phone.

71
00:03:39,813 --> 00:03:41,974
她不肯善罢甘休
She will not go away.

72
00:03:45,453 --> 00:03:46,943
我是马蒂・巴赫，能帮上你什么忙吗？
Marty Bach. How can I help you?

73
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:50,215
马蒂，你好，我是布里奇特・克雷恩，我们 打算明天刊登一篇…
Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein. We're going with a story tomorrow...

74
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,622
…有关U/North公司除草剂事件解决方案 的报导，你对此有何评论？
...about a settlement in the U/North defoliant case. You wanna comment?

75
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:57,162
你所说的这桩诉讼，到现在已经审理了6年…
Case you're referring to is now, as it has been for the past six years...

76
00:03:57,331 --> 00:03:59,196
…一直悬而未决
...pending and unresolved.

77
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,961
在我们的客户上法庭…
Till such time as our client has their day in court...

78
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:05,629
…或者原告撤诉之前我都无可奉告
...or the plaintiffs drop the suit, I'll have nothing of value to tell you.

79
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:08,868
得了，马蒂，你是最了解这件案子的人，我知道 你现在正在处理这件案子
Come on, Marty, you're closing the U/North case. You're settling.

80
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:13,504
我还知道你那里现在有600人在忙这个案子
I know that. I know you're up there with 600 people jamming this thing through.

81
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,116
我所知道的是，你的截稿时间已经过了20分钟
Here's what I know. Your deadline was 20 minutes ago.

82
00:04:16,285 --> 00:04:19,777
不管你是在忙着把故事写完还是忙着联系撤稿
So you're fishing for a story or trying to get out of writing a retraction.

83
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,447
无论是哪一样，我都祝你好运
In either case, I wish you the best of luck.

84
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,585
凯伦・克劳德死哪儿去了？
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,070
我跟
I'll see the turn.

86
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,613
不跟
Check.

87
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,387
不跟
Check.

88
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,125
不跟
Check.

89
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:30,286
半注，两百
Half the pot. Two hundred.

90
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,159
两百胜
Two hundred to go.

91
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:44,540
你不记得我了，哈？
You don't remember me, huh?

92
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,041
我们在一起玩过好几次
We played together a couple times.

93
00:05:48,216 --> 00:05:50,309
在鲍威利区那个电灯屋
That lamp place on Bowery.

94
00:05:50,485 --> 00:05:53,147
是那个家伙的商品陈列室吧？全是灯和 其他乱七八糟的
That guy's showroom? All the lamps and shit?

95
00:05:53,756 --> 00:05:55,724
- 星河 - 对，就是那儿
- The Galaxy. - That's it.

96
00:05:55,891 --> 00:05:59,088
你那时候还开了个餐馆，对吗？
You had a restaurant you were opening, right?

97
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:02,492
我过去的合伙人投标中了，负责管道
My old partner bid that job, the plumbing.

98
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:06,065
- 你不记得我了？ - 我记得你
- You don't remember me? - I remember you.

99
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:08,499
因为那之后我瘦了不少
Because I lost a lot of weight since then.

100
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,002
你也买了不少头发啊
You bought some hair too.

101
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,472
用的是你的钱
With your money.

102
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,741
那么，餐馆现在怎么样了？
So, what happened with the bar?

103
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:18,676
看来你经营的不善啊，哈？
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

104
00:06:18,848 --> 00:06:23,012
操，哥们儿，还不如去听拉里.金(CNN主持人)呢 不玩了，回家看他妈的电视去
Shit, man. I want to listen to Larry King, I go home and put the fucking TV on.

105
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:25,655
那地点不错
That was a good location.

106
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:28,656
是呀，我的合伙人也是这么跟我说的
Yeah, that's what my partner kept telling me.

107
00:06:29,193 --> 00:06:30,626
到你了
Action's on you.

108
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,025
我下底注
I bet the pot.

109
00:06:35,766 --> 00:06:37,597
欢迎下次光临
Good to see you again.

110
00:07:10,403 --> 00:07:11,392
喂？
Hello?

111
00:07:11,572 --> 00:07:12,834
- 是麦克吗？ - 沃尔特吧
- Michael. - Walter.

112
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:16,238
麦克，谢天谢地，总算找到你了 听着，我有点事情
Michael, thank God, there you are. Look, I got a situation.

113
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,506
出了个大事，明白么？我的一个客户 他刚刚打电话给我，他开车撞了个人
A big problem, all right? A client of mine, he just called, he hit a guy with his car.

114
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,581
他觉得他撞了，他觉得他撞了个人
He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.

115
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,739
就刚才？
Just now?

116
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:26,579
是的，就刚才，10、15分钟前 在他开车回家的路上
Yeah, just now. Ten, 15 minutes ago. He's driving home.

117
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:28,814
他现在在家，他在家里等你
He's home now. He's there waiting.

118
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,150
住哪儿？
Where?

119
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,159
西切斯特，我现在在百慕大这，我刚睡着 就被他叫醒了
Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda. He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.

120
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,353
他有没有喝酒？
Is he drunk?

121
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,397
没有，我一开口也是这么问他的 他精神很好，很清醒
No. It's the first thing I asked him. He's good, he's sober.

122
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,056
告诉他不要接任何电话了
Tell him to stay off the phone.

123
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:42,499
好的，你会去吧？你能去那儿吗？
All right. But you're on it? You can get up there?

124
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,434
这个家伙可是一个大客户
Because this guy, he's a huge client.

125
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,168
我大部分业务都是和他做的，好么？
This is half my book, this guy, okay?

126
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,776
我正走向车子
I'm walking to the car now.

127
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:52,311
好的，那么这样，我给他回个电话把地址搞到
Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back and I'll get the address.

128
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:56,076
你只要在路上就行了，我会给你带来更多的细节
Just let me know you're on the way, and I'll get back to you with the details.

129
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:57,685
好吧，我马上开车去
All right. I'll be in the car.

130
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:54,042
看看他们都做了些什么吧，你看 他们把路给升级了
What they did, see, they changed the grade there.

131
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:56,011
他们加宽了街道
They widened the street.

132
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:59,083
我想肯定有人告诉他们这个改进不错
I'm sure somebody told them that that was an improvement.

133
00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:03,746
但现在，你看，一到阴天下雨或者碰上大雾 在这些新的拐角处
But now, you see, when it rains and when there is fog, and with this new angle...

134
00:09:03,924 --> 00:09:07,519
…他们搞的这些新的…这些…这些…
...and they've got these new... These... These...

135
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:09,788
这些高压钠灯，晃死人了
These sodium lamps, it's blinding.

136
00:09:09,964 --> 00:09:13,229
- 就那个拐角，很刺眼 - 他们会想办法解决的
- That corner there. It is blinding. - They'll have to work that out.

137
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,233
不只是今晚，我都和他们说了好几年了
And it's not just tonight. I've been saying this for years.

138
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:21,033
我说，我们讨论过那个拐弯多少次了?戴尔?
I mean, how many times have we talked about that corner? Dell?

139
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,473
格林先生，我们没有多少时间
Mr. Greer, we don't have a lot of time here.

140
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:28,582
那么周边环境、路况，所有这些情况 你都不感兴趣喽?
So the circumstances, the road conditions, none of this holds any interest for you?

141
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,651
我感兴趣的是找到一个能在15分钟内到达的
What interests me is finding the strongest criminal attorney...

142
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,412
…优秀刑事辩护律师
...that can be here in 15 minutes.

143
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,823
哇噢，听起来好像不妙呀
Well, that sounds ominous.

144
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,553
在西切斯特，我们有些很好的关系
We have some good relationships up here in Westchester.

145
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:42,664
那么，你是干什么的？干什么的？ 你不是律师？
So, what are you? What are you? You're not a lawyer?

146
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,629
- 不是你要的那种 - 那你是哪种？
- Not the kind you need. - What kind is that?

147
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,789
执业庭审律师
A trial lawyer.

148
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,831
有人能办理好这事，但我处理不了
Somebody who can see this through. That's not what I do.

149
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:52,567
好吧，看来我还是只能把沃尔特找回来处理了
Okay. I think we're gonna have to pull Walter back in on this.

150
00:09:52,743 --> 00:09:55,735
我会给沃尔特打电话，把他搅和进来
I wanna get Walter back on the phone, get him back into the mix.

151
00:09:55,913 --> 00:09:59,644
因为，和你直说了吧，我不喜欢现在这样
Because, I'll be frank with you, I don't like the way this is going.

152
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:03,479
先生，我们没时间等沃尔特了，你的选择范围 正在快速地减小
Sir, we don't have time for Walter. Your options are gonna get smaller quickly.

153
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,713
什么选择范围？一个选项我都没听到！
What options? I'm not hearing any options!

154
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,118
我建议你还是到本地警局自首...
I suggest you go local...

155
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:10,159
…然后会有人来处理好这件事的
...and I'm telling you there are people here I like for this.

156
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:12,387
好极了。就那样吗？你就是这样帮我解决 问题的吗？
Great. That's it? That's what you got for me?

157
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:14,589
嘿，你相信吗？
Hey, you believe this?

158
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,064
12年来，我一直都是你们肯纳、巴赫 事务所的客户
I have been a client at Kenner, Bach for 12 years!

159
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:20,966
你认为我每月给你们付钱就是为了 有朝一日能出庭受审？
You think I paid that retainer every month for a place at the back of the line?

160
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,439
格林先生，你在周日晚上离开一起事故的现场…
Mr. Greer, you left the scene of an accident on a slow weeknight...

161
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,805
…离州警局只有6英里远
...six miles from the state police barracks.

162
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:29,209
如果真要受审的话，你也快了
If there's a line, you're right up front.

163
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:32,248
我随时都可以再找个律师，我不需要你了
I can get a lawyer any time I want. I don't need you for that.

164
00:10:32,418 --> 00:10:36,320
我们在这儿傻坐了45分钟就等来了这么 一个白痴建议！
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes waiting for a goddamn referral!

165
00:10:36,489 --> 00:10:38,252
我不知道沃尔特给了你什么承诺…
I don't know what Walter promised you...

166
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:41,883
一位天才员工！沃尔特在电话里是这么说的 就在20分钟前
A miracle worker! That's Walter on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

167
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:45,156
原话要听么，啊？“挺住，我会派一个天才来帮助你”
Direct quote, okay? "Hang tight. I'm sending you a miracle worker."

168
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:46,959
- 喔，那他说错了 - 哪儿说错了？
- Well, he misspoke. - About what?

169
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,727
关于你是公司的救火员那部分？ 还是你根本就不在行?
That you're the firm's fixer? Or that you're good at it?

170
00:10:49,903 --> 00:10:51,370
埃里奥特
Elliot.

171
00:10:51,772 --> 00:10:54,832
那个家伙突然跑出来！在大马路上！
The guy was running! In the street!

172
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:59,742
你设想一下，大雾、路灯、还有那些转弯…
You take that, you add the fog, you add the lamps, you add the angle...

173
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:04,741
那个家伙大半夜的在街上跑个什么劲儿啊？！
What the fuck is he doing running in the middle of the street at midnight?!

174
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:07,114
你倒是说呀！
You answer me that!

175
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:22,835
说车被人偷了怎么样？
What if someone had stolen the car?

176
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,170
这种事常有的
Happens all the time.

177
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:29,436
警察们最喜欢处理这种交通肇事逃逸
Cops like hit-and-runs.

178
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:31,637
他们会快速利落地去办
They work them hard, they clear them fast.

179
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:35,011
现在犯罪现场调查部门正在从防撞护栏 取走油漆样本
Right now there's a B.C.I. Unit pulling paint chips off a guard rail.

180
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,517
明天，他们就会开始寻找谁拥有涂有这种 定制颜料的
Tomorrow, they're gonna be looking for the owner of a custom-painted...

181
00:11:38,688 --> 00:11:40,918
…那辆手排档美洲虎XJ-12
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-12.

182
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,683
还有你撞到的那个家伙？
And the guy you hit?

183
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,227
如果他看到了车牌的话，就更快了
If he got a look at the plates, it won't even take that long.

184
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,162
这样就玩完了
There's no play here.

185
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:54,301
再没有什么拐弯，也没有放香槟的房间
There's no angle. There's no champagne room.

186
00:11:54,471 --> 00:11:57,133
我也不是什么天才，我就是个看门的
I'm not a miracle worker, I'm a janitor.

187
00:11:57,809 --> 00:11:59,367
道理很简单
The math on this is simple.

188
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:02,536
麻烦越少，我处理起来就越容易
The smaller the mess, the easier it is for me to clean up.

189
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,812
警察打来的，是吗？
That's the police, isn't it?

190
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:09,385
不是
No.

191
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,882
他们是不会打的
They don't call.

192
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:17,994
喂
Hello.

193
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:21,363
杰瑞，我是麦克・克莱顿
Jerry, it's Michael Clayton.

194
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,002
对，是的，不好意思吵醒你了
Yeah, look, I'm sorry to wake you up.

195
00:12:24,337 --> 00:12:27,067
不，我在你的隔壁
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

196
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,305
你有笔吗？
You got a pen?

197
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:04,925
四天前

198
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:13,905
妈妈，我的牌在哪儿？
Mom, where's my cards?

199
00:16:18,953 --> 00:16:20,784
我的牌在哪儿呢？
Where's my cards?

200
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:36,334
我的另一幅牌在这儿不？
Is my other deck in here?

201
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:37,903
你吃了吗？
Did you eat?

202
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:39,973
爸爸已经在下面等着了
Dad's down there waiting already.

203
00:16:40,142 --> 00:16:42,007
洗手间里有几副牌
There were cards in our bathroom.

204
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:43,440
吃了，我吃的瓦夫饼
Yes, I had a waffle.

205
00:16:43,613 --> 00:16:46,480
那怎么可能，家里的瓦夫饼早就吃完了
Since we're out of waffles, I don't see how that's possible.

206
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:47,980
那是个奇迹
It's a miracle.

207
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,278
带了手套没？
Gloves?

208
00:17:00,097 --> 00:17:01,086
亨利！
Henry!

209
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,268
快点
Come on.

210
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:10,603
上车
Get in.

211
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:14,208
坐好了？
Got it?

212
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,611
因此实际上没人能确定他们身处何地…
So no one's even sure exactly where they are...

213
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:25,950
…因为那里没有边界没有地标或其它什么标记
...because there's no borders or landmarks or anything.

214
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,855
至于城镇么？那根本算不上什么城镇
And the town? It's not even a town really.

215
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:32,225
那只不过是个大家聚在一起藏起来的小营地
It just is this camp where all these people have gathered to hide.

216
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:33,387
好
Right.

217
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:37,023
所有这些逃兵和被军队赶出来的人
All these deserters and guys that got cut off from their armies.

218
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:40,365
所有这些人都躲在森林里，努力活下去
All these people that are hiding in the woods, trying to stay alive.

219
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:42,439
这就是他们归宿
This is where they all came.

220
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:45,601
那里有盗贼、黑魔导士、佣兵…
There's Thieves, Gray Mages, Unbidden Warriors...

221
00:17:45,779 --> 00:17:47,804
…暗禽、河童、还有穴居魔
...Dark Avians, Riverwynders and Sappers.

222
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:51,144
- 像这样的角色一共有15种，明白么？ - 明白
- There's, like, 15 different characters, okay? - Okay.

223
00:17:51,618 --> 00:17:53,347
谁都没有盟友
And nobody has any alliances.

224
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,785
你甚至不能告诉别人你是谁，因为你不知道…
You can't even say who you are because, you don't know...

225
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,947
…现在和你说话的这个人…
...maybe the person you're talking to...

226
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:01,617
会不会就是你战场上的宿敌
...maybe they're like your mortal enemy in the wars.

227
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,492
所以那里的每个人都只能自顾自
So it's just completely like everybody for themselves.

228
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:05,996
听起来好耳熟啊
Sounds familiar.

229
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:09,102
真的很棒，真的，你该读读
It's really good. I'm serious, you should really read it.

230
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,433
好的，不过我看完了以后 估计你就会迷上了什么别的玩意儿
Right. But by the time I finish it, you'll be on to something else.

231
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:15,370
- 你敢和我打赌吗？ - 不知道，你想赌多少？
- How much you wanna bet? - I don't know. How much you got?

232
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,375
- 乘车卡带了么？ - 放储物柜里了
- You got your bus pass? - It's in my locker.

233
00:18:18,547 --> 00:18:21,414
你根本就不打算看它，对吗？
You're not even gonna look at it, are you?

234
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,016
- 那本书吗？ - 是的
- The book? - Yes.

235
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,584
星期六把它带来，我会…
Bring it on Saturday, I'll...

236
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:27,984
我早就带了，放在你厨房里了，红色封面的
I did already. I left it in your kitchen. It's got a red cover.

237
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,282
好吧
Okay.

238
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,859
好吧，到了
Well, here we go.

239
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,724
去吧，好好教教那些人，知道么？
Go. Teach these people something, would you?

240
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:41,360
- 回见，爸爸 - 好的，孩子
- See you later, Dad. - Yeah, kiddo.

241
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:44,906
谢谢
Thanks.

242
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:54,708
第52号拍品，各种各样的搅拌碗，什么型号都有
Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls, assorted sizes.

243
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,854
30美元起，30美元，有人出30美元了
Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars. Thirty dollars I have.

244
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:01,115
你可以出价40，40了，50，后面有人出60了
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50. Sixty dollars back there.

245
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:03,522
现在60，有人出70吗？70了
Sixty dollars, get me to 70. I got 70 dollars.

246
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:06,220
70美元，现在70了，那里有人出80
Seventy dollars, I have now, 70. Eighty dollars there.

247
00:19:06,397 --> 00:19:08,797
80，这位先生出80，80美元
Eighty dollars, this gentleman here. Eighty dollars.

248
00:19:08,967 --> 00:19:11,697
90美元了，还有人出100吗？100了
Ninety dollars there. Give me 100. One hundred I have now.

249
00:19:23,315 --> 00:19:25,613
他跟我说你还差点儿
He says you're still gonna be short.

250
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:29,511
差多少?
How short?

251
00:19:29,688 --> 00:19:33,089
6万块，加上扣点，7万5
Sixty. Plus the points, 75 thousand.

252
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,320
- 那就是酒和其他东西的价钱？ - 你觉得该是多少？
- That's liquor and everything? - What'd you think it was gonna be?

253
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:39,488
我不知道，可能更少，三两万吧
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

254
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,534
他用了1500块就买走了我那四千块的冰箱
He took 1500 on a refrigerator I paid four grand for.

255
00:19:43,703 --> 00:19:45,330
你开个价
Make a bid.

256
00:19:47,073 --> 00:19:49,564
你不会告诉我说你连7万5都没有吧？
Are you telling me you don't have the 75 thousand?

257
00:19:49,744 --> 00:19:51,803
说真的，没有
Just lying around, no.

258
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:56,406
我们都知道这事实际上我该找你弟弟谈
We both know it's your brother I should be talking to.

259
00:19:56,584 --> 00:19:57,608
算了吧
Forget that.

260
00:19:57,785 --> 00:20:02,085
麦克，你看，你要帮他收拾残局 这是你自己选的
Michael, look, you wanna front this, that's up to you.

261
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:05,487
但是债务还清之前，提米依然是欠款人
But Timmy's name stays in the book till we're clear.

262
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:10,261
如果我知道他在哪儿，我就没必要这么 一直问下去了
If I know where he is, I don't have to keep asking.

263
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:14,129
他呆在远郊，他老婆把他领回来了 但我不知道他在哪儿
He's upstate. His wife took him back. I don't know where he is.

264
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:16,100
他肯定还有点儿值钱的
He's gotta have something.

265
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:17,761
他就剩老婆和两个孩子了
He's got the two kids with her.

266
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,603
他还有珍妮弗，那被他把肚子搞大的 可乐促销员
He's got Jennifer, the coke-dealing waitress that he knocked up.

267
00:20:21,778 --> 00:20:26,442
他还有4个从我妹妹车库里偷走的米其林轮胎
He's got four Michelin radials that he stole from my sister's garage.

268
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,513
你出个价吧
Make an offer.

269
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:36,322
我曾有个酒鬼老婆，她既年轻又漂亮
I had a wife who was a drunk. She was a beautiful girl, young girl.

270
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:41,055
但就那样生活？后来有个戒酒计划 她参加了，戒了…2年
But live like that? Even they do a program... She did, I think, once, two years.

271
00:20:41,232 --> 00:20:43,223
后来计划没有了呢？别提了
And then they slip? Forget it.

272
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,766
就像你身上捆着个炸弹
It's like you're strapped to a bomb.

273
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,931
我还有多少时间？
What's my timeframe here?

274
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,264
我不知道
I don't know.

275
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,434
我想那不是个问题
I didn't think it'd be a problem.

276
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,570
我会问问的
I'll ask.

277
00:21:24,111 --> 00:21:26,306
- 早啊，麦克 - 早，卡尔
- Hey, Michael. - Morning, Carl.

278
00:21:26,946 --> 00:21:28,946
肯纳、巴赫和莱迪恩律师事务所

279
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:37,819
我不知道，戴尔，我不知道你想让我 施压到什么程度
I don't know. Del, I don't know how hard you want me to press here.

280
00:21:37,991 --> 00:21:39,982
让我知道他有多大能耐
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

281
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,493
好吧，我现在还不知道他能有多能耐
Well, I'm not sure how brave he can be right now.

282
00:21:42,664 --> 00:21:44,996
我们只是刚刚确认了听证会的时间表
We just got a confirmation hearing scheduled.

283
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,565
她有可能知道吗？
Any chance she knows that?

284
00:21:46,734 --> 00:21:50,363
喔，都上报了，谁知道呢？可能有人 读给她听吧
Well, it was in the paper. Who knows? Maybe she got someone to read it to her.

285
00:21:50,538 --> 00:21:53,063
她昨天给他老婆打电话了，打到他家里
She called his wife yesterday. She's calling his house.

286
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:54,469
这可糟透了
This is a total nightmare.

287
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:56,770
是的，我猜她无非是想要那套房子
Well, my guess is she's gonna want the condo.

288
00:21:56,946 --> 00:21:58,004
不是吧，那也太疯狂了
Come on, that's insane.

289
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,707
好吧，我还能和你说什么呢？别和算计好了的 婊子斗
Well, what can I tell you? Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

290
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,078
简直难以置信
It's just unbelievable.

291
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:06,517
嗯，这样吧，了解他的底限，然后告诉我
All right. Well, find out his pain threshold and get back to me.

292
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:08,589
或者你要他直接打电话给我
Or you can tell him to call me directly.

293
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:10,748
好的，听你的，我来搞定
All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.

294
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:12,087
好的，就这样，谢谢
Thanks.

295
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:13,889
嘿，马蒂现在在哪儿？
Hey, where are we with Marty?

296
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,388
我们给他留言了
We left word.

297
00:22:16,566 --> 00:22:18,727
等一下，再说一次，孩子有多大了？
Hold on. Go back. How old is the kid?

298
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:20,893
他不是“孩子”了，都22了
He's not a kid. He's 22.

299
00:22:21,071 --> 00:22:22,732
- 是在迈阿密吗？ - 不是，比斯坎湾
- This is Miami? - Nope. Key Biscayne.

300
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,396
他们指控他…
And they charged him.

301
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:27,873
说他过失伤人，我的委托人…
Reckless endangerment. My client...

302
00:22:28,045 --> 00:22:33,483
我想他们实际上是想要…想要调查那名律师
I think really what they want, they want a reality check on the attorney down there.

303
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,710
- 好吧 - 韦恩说你有些门路？
- Yeah. - Wayne said you have some connections?

304
00:22:35,886 --> 00:22:38,411
- 好的，让我拿支笔 - 谢谢
- Yeah, let me get a pen. - Thank you.

305
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,216
现在，如果她直接给移民局打电话 那她就哪儿也去不了了
Now, if she calls the INS directly, she's gonna get nowhere.

306
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:43,622
预约都不行么？
Even with the appointment?

307
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,286
移民局是这么说的，埃文 就像被交通管制了一样
It's retail, Evan. It's like the DMV over there.

308
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,798
除非能得到地区主管的同意，否则没人能离开
Unless they get a call from a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

309
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,526
但你的人不是可以吗？
But your guy can do that?

310
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,034
他已经离任了
He's a former commissioner.

311
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,140
那么现在没人能帮我了？因为干什么都没用了
None of this comes back to me? Because that doesn't do any good.

312
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,401
不，不是，我就是你唯一能够咨询的人
No, look, I'm gonna be the one that's asking.

313
00:22:58,578 --> 00:23:00,910
- 你能等两分钟吗？ - 当然可以
- Can you hang on a minute? - Yeah, sure.

314
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,012
我们要正在进行合并吗？
Are we merging?

315
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,679
马蒂・巴赫在伦敦
Marty Bach's in London.

316
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:09,947
起初是说他在亚特兰大，然后娜拉说 他就在这栋楼里
They said he was in Atlanta, then Lara said he was in the building.

317
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:12,250
所以我就给他打了过去，我知道你想和他见面
So I called back. I know you want this meeting.

318
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,985
现在，她告诉我实情了，他确实在伦敦
Now she tells me the truth. He's really in London.

319
00:23:15,162 --> 00:23:18,359
那我们的确是在进行合并了？ 我是说，大家都在这么说
So are we merging? I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

320
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,659
那些英国佬？这次是来真的了
All these Brits? That this time it's for real.

321
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,631
好像我知道似的
Like I would know.

322
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,498
我不知道
I don't know.

323
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:28,334
但就算是真的，我是说，就算是合并了 对我们也没多大的影响，对吧？
But even if we are, I mean, even if they merged, it wouldn't affect us, right?

324
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,770
有电话里来了
Your phone's ringing.

325
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,113
埃文？
Evan?

326
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:36,646
嘿，好的，我打算这么办
Hey. Okay, here's what I'll do.

327
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:39,787
我给他打个电话下周安排一次会面
Let me give him a call and set up a meeting for next week.

328
00:23:39,954 --> 00:23:42,354
我会把她带来，介绍一下…
I'll walk her in, I'll make the introduction...

329
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:46,085
目前，U/North公司拥有7万名员工…
At the moment, U/North currently has 70,000 employees...

330
00:23:46,262 --> 00:23:49,288
…分布在全世界62个国家
...in 62 countries around the world.

331
00:23:50,866 --> 00:23:52,493
覆盖全球
Around the planet.

332
00:23:53,636 --> 00:23:57,367
运作在62个国家，覆盖全球
Operating in 62 countries around the planet.

333
00:23:58,474 --> 00:24:03,207
在世界范围内进驻到60多个国家
At work in more than 60 countries around the globe.

334
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:09,051
我们拥有...我们现在拥有...我们拥有...
We have... We have, right now... We have...

335
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:12,450
U/North公司目前拥有7万5千名员工
At U/North right now, we've got 75,000 employees...

336
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:15,386
分布在全球60余个国家
...in over 60 countries around the planet.

337
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,323
我们是一个非常成功的多元化的公司
We are a very successful and highly diversified company...

338
00:24:18,496 --> 00:24:20,225
…因此你可以想像…
...so you can imagine...

339
00:24:20,398 --> 00:24:23,834
…我们每天要面对大量不同种类的法律问题
...the volume and the variety of legal issues we have to deal with is...

340
00:24:24,001 --> 00:24:25,468
数量巨大的
Overwhelming.

341
00:24:27,438 --> 00:24:28,871
实在是太多了
It's just enormous.

342
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:32,672
因此你可以想像法律问题的…
So you can imagine, the volume of legal issues...

343
00:24:33,979 --> 00:24:36,243
数量是十分巨大的
It's quite substantial.

344
00:24:36,415 --> 00:24:39,009
作为法律总顾问，我所要做的…
And as general counsel, what I do...

345
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:41,379
…我们内部部门要做的…
...what our in-house department does...

346
00:24:41,553 --> 00:24:46,820
…就是分析问题的大小或者看准时机
...is to analyze the dimension of the problem or the opportunity...

347
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:49,324
…来提出仲裁…
...to determine the jurisdiction...

348
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:51,726
…把我们的业务外包给…
...and to outsource our business...

349
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:55,356
…那些我们认为对公司最有帮助的企业和个人
...to those firms and talents that we think can help us the most.

350
00:24:55,768 --> 00:24:58,396
那么面对这么大的压力和工作量…
So with all that pressure and workload...

351
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:01,904
…你是如何在工作和生活之间平衡的呢？
...how do you keep a balance between work and life?

352
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:03,542
平衡？
Balance?

353
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:09,378
我想…有些东西…
I think that's... That's something that...

354
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:12,883
…你会耗尽毕生精力去探寻的，对吗？
...you search for your whole life, isn't it?

355
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,851
实际上，那是一种变换着的平衡
It's a shifting balance, really.

356
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:19,186
这是，你知道，你..你试着去...
It's, you know, you... You try to...

357
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,659
当你真的喜欢你的事业时…
When you really are enjoying what it is you do...

358
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,696
…谁还会在乎什么平衡呢？
...who needs balance?

359
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,291
这就是你的平衡，这就是你的平衡
There's your balance. There's your balance.

360
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,429
当你真的喜欢你的事业时，那就是你的 平衡所在
When you're really enjoying what it is you do, there is your balance.

361
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:34,768
当丹要我担任...
When Don asked me to take...

362
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,411
当丹・杰弗瑞带上…丹・杰弗瑞带我…
When Don Jeffries brought... Don Jeffries brought me...

363
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,549
12年前丹.杰瑞弗把我带到这儿来…
Don Jeffries brought me in here 12 years ago...

364
00:25:40,716 --> 00:25:43,810
…给予我信任，悉心指导我
...trusted me, mentored me.

365
00:25:43,986 --> 00:25:46,955
欢迎我加入U/North这个大家庭
Welcomed me into the U/North family.

366
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:51,457
当他升到董事会后，我做梦都没…
And when he moved up to the boardroom, I never really...

367
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:55,789
…没想过我会有机会坐到他的位置上
...dreamt that I would have the opportunity to move into his position.

368
00:25:55,966 --> 00:25:58,730
但，这是不是很有挑战性？当然
But, is it challenging? Yes.

369
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:04,568
我想在最初的几个月里的确有点磕磕绊绊
And I think that it's possible that those first few months were a little shaky.

370
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:09,838
但当你意识到你所学的让你有备而来 你就会把握住方向
But then you realize that you've been taught to be ready, and you take the helm.

371
00:26:10,014 --> 00:26:14,007
因为如果你没有准备好承担相应的责任…
Because if you're not comfortable with that level of responsibility...

372
00:26:14,185 --> 00:26:16,016
…那你就不适合坐这个位置
...you're in the wrong place.

373
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:21,284
这是你的部门，你有能力在关键时刻做出决定…
It's your department, your capacity to make tough decisions in real time, and...

374
00:26:22,126 --> 00:26:23,889
我们正在录节目
We're in the middle of an interview.

375
00:26:24,063 --> 00:26:26,031
他们说这是紧急情况
They said it was urgent.

376
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:29,500
老天
Jesus.

377
00:26:30,202 --> 00:26:31,999
上帝啊
For chrissake.

378
00:26:33,572 --> 00:26:35,437
你是说他这么做了，在…？
You're saying he did this in...?

379
00:26:35,608 --> 00:26:36,666
噢，天啊
Oh, my God.

380
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,504
- 巴里 - 等一下
- Barry. - Hang on.

381
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:45,144
亚瑟・伊顿刚刚在密尔沃基的证人室里 脱了个精光
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked in a deposition room in Milwaukee.

382
00:26:47,153 --> 00:26:48,484
哦，麦克…
Oh, Michael...

383
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:52,318
…我深深地、彻底地吸了口气，把我那想法 放到一边，我放下了它
...I took a deep, cleansing breath and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.

384
00:26:52,492 --> 00:26:57,293
我对自已说：“很显然，这种强烈的感觉…
I said to myself, "As clear as this may be, as potent a feeling as this is...

385
00:26:57,465 --> 00:27:01,231
…和我今天见证的东西一样真实，但它需要等待
...as true a thing as I believe that I have witnessed today, it must wait.

386
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:04,394
它必须经受住时间的考验”
It must stand the test of time."

387
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:07,336
现在，麦克，时候到了
And, Michael, the time is now.

388
00:27:07,508 --> 00:27:10,966
就此时、今天、这里、这房子、这空气…
This moment, today, here, this room, this air...

389
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:15,549
…还有这点，特别是这点，麦克，你也来了
...and this, especially this, Michael, that you're here.

390
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,514
这就是原因
There's a reason.

391
00:27:17,686 --> 00:27:19,381
你就是一个原因，麦克
A reason it's you, Michael.

392
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:24,048
当然，你会对它有些感觉，它是如何拼凑 又是如何聚集的
Surely, you have some sense of that, how it pulls together, how it gathers.

393
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,957
看门人麦克，幕后英雄，隐藏罪恶的守护者
Nurse Michael, the secret hero, the keeper of the hidden sins.

394
00:27:28,131 --> 00:27:30,395
看在上帝份上，麦克，告诉我这你都明白
Tell me you can see that, Michael, for God's sake.

395
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,701
但是，我要说，是的，是，是的，裸体 在停车场，我承认
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes. The nudity, the parking lot, I admit it.

396
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:39,569
那是…那是…是个错误，那很无聊、很软弱
It was... It was... It was a mistake. It was wrong. It was lame.

397
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,836
很明显的，那些药剂，根本就不起作用…
It was obvious. And therapeutically, it was completely useless...

398
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:46,380
…但我发誓，我会在这里不要这老脸…
...because I swear, I could stand here and tear off my fucking skin...

399
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:51,281
…就是因为不能忍受那些鬼东西存在
...and I could not get down to where this thing is living.

400
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:55,186
6年了，麦克，6年来我一直在吸收这些毒素
Six years, Michael. Six years I've absorbed this poison.

401
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:58,624
400多人作证，100多人提出动议，5次改变 审判地点…
Four hundred depositions, a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

402
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:01,231
…8万5千份卷宗
...85,000 documents in discovery.

403
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:05,597
6年来不停地谋划、拖延与惊恐 我又得到了什么？
Six years of scheming and stalling and screaming, and what have I got?

404
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:10,230
耗费了我12%生命来维护这该死的 除草剂公司的声誉！
I've spent 12 percent of my life defending the reputation of a deadly weed killer!

405
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:12,501
- 我们说好了的，亚瑟 - 有天晚上
- We had an agreement, Arthur. - One night.

406
00:28:12,677 --> 00:28:15,612
有天晚上，知道吧？我发现马蒂在我的办公室里
One night, right? I look up and there's Marty in my office.

407
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,112
拿着香槟酒
He's got some champagne.

408
00:28:17,283 --> 00:28:22,050
他说我们已经为U/North提供了3万小时的 收费服务，他想庆祝一下
He tells me we just hit 30,000 billable hours on U/North and he wants to celebrate.

409
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:25,748
一小时后，我发现自己在切尔西区的 一家妓院里…
So an hour later, I find myself in a whorehouse in Chelsea...

410
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:29,326
…两个红发的立陶宛女人在我下身 轮流给我吹喇叭
...with two Lithuanian redheads taking turns sucking my dick.

411
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:33,592
我躺在那里，想多爽一会儿，我想…
I'm laying there and I'm trying not to come and I wanna...

412
00:28:33,767 --> 00:28:36,065
我想多“挺”一会儿，所以我就开始计算别的
I wanna make it last, so I start doing the math.

413
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:39,467
我想“3万小时，那是多久呀，24乘以30
I think, "Thirty thousand hours, what is that? That's 24 times 30.

414
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:44,736
一个月是720小时，一年是8760小时…”
That's 720 hours in a month, 8760 hours in a year..."

415
00:28:44,912 --> 00:28:46,470
- 亚瑟 - 不，等等，等等，听我说！
- Arthur. - No, wait, wait, wait!

416
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:49,980
那是多少年呀！那可是多少条命啊！
Because it's years! It's lives!

417
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:52,984
这些数字让我发晕，你知道…
And the numbers are making me dizzy and, you know...

418
00:28:53,154 --> 00:28:57,352
…现在，我不再考虑怎么多“挺”一会儿了 我开始试着不要再思考下去，但我停不下来
...now, instead of trying not to come, I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

419
00:28:57,525 --> 00:28:58,924
我想，这是我吗？
I mean, is this me?

420
00:28:59,093 --> 00:29:03,427
我是个被送到这里来吃喝玩乐…
Am I this freak organism that has been sent here to sleep and eat...

421
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,797
…然后为那个让人毛骨悚然的致癌链式分子 做辩护的大傻瓜么？
...and defend this one horrific chain of carcinogenic molecules?

422
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:09,961
难道这就是我的命运？我的定数？
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

423
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:12,369
- 听着，你答应过我 - 是吗，麦克？
- Listen, you promised me. - Is that it, Michael?

424
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:15,510
这就是我长期努力的目标？ 两个立陶宛娘们儿给我吹喇叭？
Is that my grail? Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

425
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:18,237
这就是我的多项选择的正确答案吗？
Is that the correct answer to the multiple choice of me?

426
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:21,612
你想不吃药，也可以，但你得先给我打电话
You wanna go off your medication, that's fine. But you call me first.

427
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:23,446
- 那是我们约好的 - 告我去啊
- That was our agreement. - Sue me.

428
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,814
你们俩没事吧？
We okay in there?

429
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:28,519
我们俩没事，没事
We're fine. We're fine.

430
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,188
除草剂杀死了他们，麦克
They killed them, Michael.

431
00:29:34,365 --> 00:29:37,562
那些小农庄，家族农场
Those small farms, the family farms.

432
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,260
你有…你有…你有见过安娜吗？
Did you...? Did you...? Did you meet Anna?

433
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:41,462
没有
No.

434
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:44,733
你得去看看她，你得去找她谈谈 她很了不起，麦克
You gotta see her, you gotta talk to her. She's a miracle, Michael.

435
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,900
她可是造物主创造的最完美的小精灵
She's God's perfect little creature.

436
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:50,513
为了那5千万美元的费用，我花去了12%的生命…
And for 50 million dollars in fees, I've spent 12 percent of my life...

437
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:54,311
…毁掉了完美的安娜还有她那已故的父母 和奄奄一息的哥哥
...destroying perfect Anna and her dead parents and her dying brother.

438
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:56,249
你最后一次吃这些是什么时候？
When did you last take one of these?

439
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:59,151
不，不，不，这玩意儿我还有 这一切都是有原因的
No. I'm not losing this. Everything is finally significant.

440
00:29:59,324 --> 00:30:01,758
这是个美好的世界，我什么都不想换了
The world is a beautiful place. I'm not trading that.

441
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:05,192

- Lf it's real, the pill won't kill it. - I have blood on my hands.

我是湿婆（印度教的主神之一 世界的毁灭者和重建者），死亡之神
I am Shiva, the god of death.

446
00:30:17,276 --> 00:30:20,268
让我们离开密尔沃基吧，以后再说这个
Let's get out of Milwaukee, we'll talk about it.

447
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:26,412
我们从医院回来之后，大家都哭了…
We came back from the hospital and everybody was crying...

...and we were in shock, but we still... We had to milk.

449
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,225
奶牛可不会等你，是吧？

450
00:30:33,393 --> 00:30:34,382
不会

How do I turn it off?

去密尔沃基？去听证会？
To Milwaukee? For a deposition?

504
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,960
我们以为已经解决了，有一些传言 所以我们觉得事情已经妥了
We thought there was a settlement. There's been some rumors.

505
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:54,732
是这样，这事非常简单，亚瑟没有按量服药
Okay. Look, it's very simple. Arthur has a chemical imbalance.

506
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:58,776
他应该坚持吃药，但他没有
He's supposed to be taking his medication. He's fallen behind on that.

507
00:33:58,945 --> 00:34:01,436
现在他正在好转中，三四天后他就会好的
He's on the mend. He'll be fine in three or four days.

508
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:05,779
现在，我给你们说清楚 这屋子里发生的一切都不要透露出去
Now, I wanna make this crystal clear. What happened here stays in this room.

509
00:34:05,953 --> 00:34:08,922
一点一滴信息都不能泄露
This is not a piece of information you wanna be out in front of.

510
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:12,389
还有人有问题吗，有就马上说
Anybody has a problem with that, I need to know right now.

511
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:14,892
很好
All right.

512
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,594
我们今晚就得在这儿过了
We're stuck here overnight.

513
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:20,064
如果可能的话我明天就送他回家
I'm gonna take him home tomorrow if I can.

514
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:22,203
谁负责听证会的时间表？
Who's in charge of the deposition schedule?

515
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,031
- 我 - 我们现在进行到什么程度了？
- I am. - Where do we stand with that?

516
00:34:24,206 --> 00:34:26,401
我想我们可能停住了，我们不知道下一步 该做些什么
I guess it's on hold. We didn't know what to do.

517
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:28,634
没有停下来的事，你继续做你们该做的
Nothing is on hold. Keep doing what you were.

518
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:31,074
对方想谈些什么的话，他们可以纽约打电话
Other side wants to talk, they can call New York.

519
00:34:31,246 --> 00:34:34,306
- 我要他的公文包 - 亚瑟的？不知道…没看见
- I need his briefcase. - Arthur's? I don't... I didn't see it.

520
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:37,578
- 他说就在房间里 - 可能朱迪拿走了吧
- He said it was in the room. - It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

521
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:39,546
找到它
Find it.

522
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:49,828
所有这些人，都开始有这些梦了，对吧？
So all these people, they all start having these dreams, okay?

523
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,403
你知道什么叫“幻象探索”么？嗯，就像那些 纳瓦霍人（美洲印第安人的一支）那样
You know what a vision quest is? You know, for, like, Navajos and stuff?

524
00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:57,836
嗯，我知道，就像…
Yeah. I think so. Like a...

525
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,073
就像一个特别的梦
Like a special dream.

526
00:35:00,244 --> 00:35:04,806
不同之处就在于所有人都做一样的梦
Except this is like a whole bunch of people having the same dream.

527
00:35:04,983 --> 00:35:08,384
这个梦让他们大家都到同一个地方
They're all having this dream that they should go to this one place.

528
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:10,578
他们不知道为什么要这样做
They don't know why or anything.

529
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:13,883
但他们就是有种非去那里不可的感觉
They just have this feeling that they have to go there.

530
00:35:14,058 --> 00:35:15,923
他们是召唤的一群人
That they've been summoned.

531
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,322
那就是其中的一章
That's the chapter.

532
00:35:17,495 --> 00:35:20,464
真的，就叫做“召唤与征服”
Seriously, that's what it's called: "Summons to Conquest."

533
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:21,930
这是标题
That's the title.

534
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:27,767
嗯，但他们知道么？他们知道他们的梦 都一样吗？
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know they're all having the same dream?

535
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,908
不知道，这就是精彩的地方
No. That's what's so cool.

536
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,376
他们都觉得只有自己才有
They all think it's just them.

537
00:35:32,545 --> 00:35:36,606
也许他们可能已经疯了，但他们就是不想承认
That maybe they're, like, going crazy or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

538
00:35:36,783 --> 00:35:38,910
是呀，但其实他们没有发疯，对吗？
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

539
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:42,577
不，一切都是真的，他们没有疯
No. It's real. It's really happening.

540
00:35:42,756 --> 00:35:46,385
是的，都是真的，不是么？
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

541
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:52,258
有东西比他们更为强大，而他们还没有准备好…
Something larger than themselves and they're not ready, are they...

542
00:35:52,433 --> 00:35:54,230
…他们会察觉到么？
...to hear it?

543
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,302
是的，不久之后他们就会
Yeah. But later they will.

544
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:59,303
如果你想看这本书的话，我就不再透露情节了
So if you're gonna read it, I don't wanna spoil it.

545
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,739
你在干什么，和谁说话呢？
What are you doing? Who you talking to?

546
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,878
我给我爸爸打电话，他的一个朋友接的
I called my dad. It's a friend of his.

547
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:08,311
- 谁？ - 伊顿先生，你不认识他
- Who? - Mr. Edens. You don't know him.

548
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:11,145
- 喂，喂 - 亨利，已经11点多了
- Hello? Hello? - Henry, it's after 11.

549
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,117
我得马上挂了
I gotta get off now.

550
00:36:13,288 --> 00:36:17,281
不，等下，那本书，我想看看，书名是什么
No. Wait, wait. The book. I need the book. The title.

551
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:20,123
书名是 《王国与征服》
The book is Realm and Conquest.

552
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:22,058
《王国与征服》
Realm and Conquest.

553
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:25,291
- 单行本，红色封面的 - 亨利，把电话给我
- It's Book One, with the red cover. - Henry, give me the phone.

554
00:36:25,468 --> 00:36:28,028
我得挂了，告诉我爸我给他打电话了，好吗？
I gotta go. Tell my dad I called. Okay?

555
00:36:28,905 --> 00:36:33,308
好，好的，谢…谢，谢谢你，亨利，谢谢你
Yeah. Yeah. Thank... Thank... Thank... Thank you, Henry, thank you.

556
00:36:37,513 --> 00:36:40,949
《王国与征服》，谢谢
Realm and Conquest. Thank you.

557
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:06,200
凯伦？你好，我是麦克・克莱顿
Karen? Hi, I'm Michael Clayton.

558
00:37:06,378 --> 00:37:07,845
- 你迟到了 - 我知道
- You're late. - I know.

559
00:37:08,013 --> 00:37:10,538
对不起，这事比我们预想的要复杂
I'm sorry, it was more complicated than we thought.

560
00:37:10,716 --> 00:37:12,411
他在哪儿？五点半我们就在这儿了
Where is he? We've been here since 5:30.

561
00:37:12,585 --> 00:37:14,746
- 他睡了 - 那么，把他叫起来
- He's asleep. - Well, wake him up.

562
00:37:14,921 --> 00:37:17,185
那可不行，我们刚让他安静下来
That's not gonna happen. We just got him sedated.

563
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,716
只要他接受日常的药物治疗…
Once he gets back on his regular medication...

564
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:22,827
…不多时间他就能回来
...then it's just a matter of time.

565
00:37:22,995 --> 00:37:25,759
- 你有看那段录像么？那盘带子？ - 我听说了
- Have you seen the video? The tape? - I heard about it.

566
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:28,501
那之后发生的事情更糟
What happened after is worse.

567
00:37:28,669 --> 00:37:32,571
那可是停车场，人们停车开车的地方
This is in the parking lot, okay? People running for their cars.

568
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,866
他在那里就穿了双袜子，别的没了
He's there in his socks, nothing else.

569
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:38,705
“对不起，很抱歉，我再也不想和这疾病为伍了
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I will not sit with this sickness any longer.

570
00:37:38,879 --> 00:37:41,677
我再也不能助长这疾病了”
I cannot aid this sickness any longer."

571
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:43,441
这话什么意思？
What does this mean?

572
00:37:43,851 --> 00:37:45,409
我也不清楚
I'm not sure.

573
00:37:45,586 --> 00:37:48,214
你整晚和他在一起，他说了些什么？
You've been with him the whole evening. What's he saying?

574
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:50,186
他没说什么有用的
He wasn't really making much sense.

575
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:51,916
你这解释我可不能接受
This is totally unacceptable.

576
00:37:52,093 --> 00:37:55,028
这可是价值30亿美元的集体诉讼
This is a 3-billion-dollar class-action lawsuit.

577
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:57,130
到了早上，我不得不给我老板汇报
In the morning, I have to call my board.

578
00:37:57,299 --> 00:38:01,861
告诉他们我们这案子的首席辩护律师被逮逋了
I have to tell them that the architect of our entire defense has been arrested...

579
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:06,202
…因为他在暴风雪中裸奔，并在停车场追赶原告
...for running naked in a snowstorm, chasing the plaintiffs through a parking lot.

580
00:38:06,376 --> 00:38:08,173
我能理解
I understand.

581
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,270
他说的那疾病到底是什么？
What sickness is he talking about?

582
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:14,076
- 不知道，可能是什么别的东西 - 那好，是什么？
- I don't know. It could be anything. - Well, give me one.

583
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,547
冻伤吧
Frostbite.

584
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,679
你觉得这很好玩吗？
You think this is funny?

585
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:20,119
你看，他的妻子病了，去年去世的
Look, his wife was sick and she died last year.

586
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:24,751
他的女儿不理他了，他很孤独，他现在的 生活就只有你的案子
His daughter doesn't talk to him. He's all alone. All he does is your case.

587
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,625
他忘了吃药，度过了糟糕的一天，仅此而已
He skipped his pills. He had a bad day. That's it.

588
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:30,494
看来你是这方面的权威喽？
And you're somehow the authority on this?

589
00:38:31,202 --> 00:38:33,727
他上次发病是在八年前，当时我在场
His last episode was eight years ago. I was there.

590
00:38:33,905 --> 00:38:36,738
我帮他回到家，看着他好转，就这样
I helped bring him home. I watched him get better. That's it.

591
00:38:36,908 --> 00:38:40,674
行了，凯伦，你雇佣他不是因为他有抑郁证
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy because of his low-key regularity...

592
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:43,838
…你雇他是因为他是最棒的，因为他的才智…
...you hired him because he's a killer, because he's brilliant...

593
00:38:44,016 --> 00:38:46,678
…因为他在这个案子上足够执着努力…
...because he's crazy enough to grind away on this case...

594
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:49,616
- …6年来无休止地工作着 - 打断下，我们可是给了他工钱的
...for six years without a break. - We pay for his time.

595
00:38:49,789 --> 00:38:51,814
我知道你想要个解释
I thought you wanted an explanation.

596
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:54,721
到了早上，我会给马蒂・巴赫打电话的
In the morning, I'm calling Marty Bach.

597
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:57,920
然后么，你也知道的，谢谢你，麦克
But, then, you know that. Thank you, Michael.

598
00:39:03,803 --> 00:39:05,896
他大部分时候很平静
He was mostly just quiet.

599
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:08,940
我听到他的动静，15分钟前我给他吃了药
I heard him moving around, I gave him a pill 15 minutes ago.

600
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:11,600
- 他吃了？ - 说到做到，对吧？
- He took it? - A deal's a deal, right?

601
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:13,508
干的不错，埃斯顿
A super job, Elston.

602
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,343
你去纽约吧，如果需要入场券或其它什么东西 和我说就行
You get to New York, you need tickets to the game or anything, you let me know.

603
00:39:17,518 --> 00:39:18,951
我会把这事办好的
I'll do that for sure.

604
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:40,968
你见过她了吗？
Did you see her?

605
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,471
- 谁？ - 安娜
- Who? - Anna.

606
00:39:44,013 --> 00:39:45,412
没有
No.

607
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:50,142
没有，我没见到她，她可能回农场了
No, I didn't see her. She probably went back to the farm.

608
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,681
嗯，我们需要她
Well, we need her.

609
00:39:54,524 --> 00:39:59,325
马蒂，还有其他的几个人，他们不会明白的
Marty, even then, and the rest of them, they won't understand.

610
00:40:00,397 --> 00:40:03,924
那么如果有人能够给他们解释的话 那人就是你了，亚瑟
Well, if anybody can explain it to them, it's you, Arthur.

611
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:07,830
不，他们已经迷失方向了
No, they're lost.

612
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,065
- 他们已经得到他们想要的了 - 别想了，伙计
- They have what they want. - Let it go, man.

613
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,073
这就是你想要的？
This what you wanted?

614
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,169
当个看门的？
To be a janitor?

615
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:19,707
像这样生活下去？就这样？
Live like this? All this?

616
00:40:20,518 --> 00:40:22,179
做你该做的？
Do what you do?

617
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,987
不可能的
It can't be.

618
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:26,882
那是…
It's...

619
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,688
那是种负担，这就是我一直想告诉你的
It's a burden, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

620
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,457
就是…就是这种感觉
That's... That's how it feels.

621
00:40:34,399 --> 00:40:39,098
我知道我们是被召唤的
Well, I know that we've been summoned.

622
00:40:40,874 --> 00:40:42,705
早点睡吧
Get some sleep.

623
00:40:58,592 --> 00:40:59,616
喂
Hello?

624
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:03,593
你好，我想找韦恩？
Yes. Hi, I'm looking for Verne?

625
00:41:04,632 --> 00:41:05,963
你有号码吗？
You have a number?

626
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:09,227
丹・杰弗瑞给的我这个号码 他说我什么时间打都行
Don Jeffries gave me the number. He said I could call at any time.

627
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:11,268
不，我是指帐号
No. The account number.

628
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:15,637
帐号？我有，等一下，我看看
The code? I do. I have it right here. One moment.

629
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:19,570
稍等片刻
Excuse me one moment.

630
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:23,643
找到了，12-BKR-6
It's right here. 12-BKR-6.

631
00:41:23,818 --> 00:41:25,877
12-BKR-6
12-BKR-6.

632
00:41:27,323 --> 00:41:29,314
你是韦恩吗？
Am I speaking with Verne?

633
00:41:30,426 --> 00:41:31,723
是的，我是
It's Mr. Verne.

634
00:41:31,894 --> 00:41:35,227
韦恩先生，不好意思，这么晚打扰你
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so late.

635
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:37,389
丹说我可以…
Don said that I could...

636
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:41,331
我不是很清楚这东西的用法
I'm not exactly sure how this works.

637
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:43,495
你现在能上网收电子邮件吗？
Do you have e-mail at your current location?

638
00:41:43,674 --> 00:41:44,902
我有
I do.

639
00:41:45,075 --> 00:41:47,236
- 你现在一个人吗？ - 是的
- Are you alone? - I am.

640
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:52,243
这样，我会给你上传一个我们常用的小加密包
Okay, I'm gonna upload you a little encryption package we like to use.

641
00:41:52,416 --> 00:41:53,815
那上面写的很清楚
It's pretty self-explanatory.

642
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:55,281
- 好的 - 好
- Okay. - Okay.

643
00:41:55,452 --> 00:41:58,421
不过你得等几分钟，我得到办公桌那里去，别挂
But you have to give me a minute to get to my desk. Hold on.

644
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:00,285
好的，谢谢你
Okay. Thank you.

645
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,525
（内部使用） 北地联合克林泰特除草剂内部研究备忘录229号

646
00:42:10,525 --> 00:42:12,025
229号内部研究备忘录

647
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,025
清楚所有已上市的克林泰特…

648
00:42:16,526 --> 00:42:18,526
…能够对人体组织造成伤害…

649
00:42:19,526 --> 00:42:21,526
…无色，无味…潜在的致命威胁

650
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,212
我想知道的是…
What I was wondering is...

651
00:42:27,386 --> 00:42:30,219
…我是不是有续租六年的优先选择权
...I have an option on the lease for six more years.

652
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:33,052
我在想有没有办法可解除那种情况
I was wondering if there's any way I could lay that off.

653
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:36,218
这租约还有价值么？
Is the lease worth anything?

654
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:42,190
8万9一个月，那…
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's...

655
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:45,366
没有装修，但有…
The fixtures are gone, but there's...

656
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:50,271
但还有吧台，还有厨房，那地方不错
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen, it's a great space.

657
00:42:51,846 --> 00:42:53,404
可是还有…
But there's a...

658
00:42:57,718 --> 00:43:00,812
好，我明白了，不，我明白了
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

659
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:04,684
好的，好，我会的
Okay, yeah, I will.

660
00:43:05,327 --> 00:43:06,851
好，谢了
All right. Thanks.

661
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:18,798
好了，亚瑟
Come on, Arthur.

662
00:43:21,411 --> 00:43:22,708
亚瑟！
Arthur!

663
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:25,272
亚瑟，开门
Arthur, open the door.

664
00:43:28,851 --> 00:43:30,716
亚瑟，快开门！
Arthur, open the door!

665
00:43:33,557 --> 00:43:35,957
亚瑟，快他妈的把门打开！
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

666
00:43:37,261 --> 00:43:38,523
亚瑟，开…！
Arthur, op...!

667
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:41,423
快他娘的开门！
Open the fucking door!

668
00:43:47,805 --> 00:43:49,272
亚瑟！
Arthur!

669
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:52,703
该死的，亚瑟！快他妈的…！
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking...!

670
00:44:03,154 --> 00:44:04,348
亚瑟？！
Arthur?!

671
00:44:07,533 --> 00:44:09,033
相信吧，这绝不只是疯狂

672
00:44:15,668 --> 00:44:17,499
- 韦恩先生么，你好 - 你好，丹尼
- Mr. Verne, hey. - Hey, Danny.

673
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,934
你的人来早了，我还在收拾其他的包
You guys are early. I was pulling the other bags.

674
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:22,974
你可以把它们放在后面，计划有变，抱歉
You can put them back. There's been a change of plans, sorry.

675
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:25,043
- 我们准备好了么？ - 是的
- We ready? - Yep.

676
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:31,241
天啊
For chrissake.

677
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,283
丹・杰弗瑞签署的？
Don Jeffries signed this?

678
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,314
这真是他的签名？
That's really his signature?

679
00:44:36,491 --> 00:44:38,459
正本在哪儿？
Where's the original?

680
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:43,689
5年前库房失火了，我们损失了很多档案
We had a warehouse fire five years ago. We lost a number of documents.

681
00:44:49,804 --> 00:44:52,671
这玩意儿怎么会在亚瑟的包里？
What the hell is this doing in Arthur's bag?

682
00:44:53,308 --> 00:44:54,832
那个，我也不知道，马蒂
Well, I don't know, Marty.

683
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,969
我还希望你能告诉我些事情呢
That's something I was hoping you might be able to tell me.

684
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,311
我们要找什么？
What are we looking for?

685
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:09,685
如果提到了U/North公司，就放在一边 任何提到U/North的材料
If it says U/North, pull it aside. Anything that says U/North.

686
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:12,651
这儿真是一团糟
What a mess this is.

687
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,528
我这儿所有的…
I want all this...

688
00:45:19,469 --> 00:45:23,565
…所有的东西，打包后送到办公室去
...everything here, I want it all packed up and sent up to the house.

689
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,074
一切还好么，麦克？
Any luck, Michael?

690
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:30,907
他3点在纽华克机场上了辆出租 在西四大街下了车…
He booked a limo from Newark Airport at 3, got out at West Fourth Street...

691
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:33,049
…给了司机一张百元大钞当小费，走掉了
...tipped the driver 100 bucks and walked away.

692
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:34,411
你去过他的公寓了么？
Did you try his apartment?

693
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:35,745
- 他搬家了 - 我知道
- He moved. - I know.

694
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,286
那是间阁楼，没有门卫，我按了门铃，没人
It's a loft. No doorman. I rang, nobody answered.

695
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:41,119
- 我打电话，他开了答录机 - 那么说他不知去向了
- I called, I got the machine. - So he could be anywhere.

696
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:44,285
亚瑟住在城里不是什么好事，住什么狗屁阁楼
Arthur downtown is not a good idea. Some goddamn loft.

697
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:47,193
- 他女儿在哪儿？ - 我不知道，西班牙或者是印度
- Where's his daughter? - I don't know. Spain, India.

698
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:50,493
马尔斯，比她爸爸还疯狂
Mars. She's crazier than he'll ever be.

699
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:52,500
巴里接手U/North的事情
Barry's taking over on U/North.

700
00:45:52,671 --> 00:45:54,468
我们又有不少罪要受了
We got a lot of groveling to do.

701
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,733
你可不怎么受凯伦・克劳德的欢迎
You didn't exactly charm Karen Crowder.

702
00:45:56,909 --> 00:45:58,137
我被踢开了
I was punting.

703
00:45:58,311 --> 00:46:00,973
你在这儿做好准备，掌控好局面
You gotta saddle up here and get things under control.

704
00:46:01,147 --> 00:46:02,136
做好什么准备？
Saddle up?

705
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:05,375
他需要立即接受医生诊断，他需要被 允许住院治疗
He needs to be under a doctor's care. He needs to be admitted.

706
00:46:05,551 --> 00:46:07,883
- 住哪儿？ - 这很重要么？
- Where? - Does that really matter?

707
00:46:08,054 --> 00:46:10,955
麦克，U/North想知道他已经被控制住了
Michael, U/North needs to know he's under control.

708
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:14,491
他要在医院里，他们被吓坏了 他们需要恢复信心
He's in a facility. They've been shook up. They need to be reassured.

709
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,856
- 没那么容易的 - 为什么没那么容易？
- It's not gonna be that easy. - Why the hell not?

710
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:20,830
因为纽约的法律对于进行非自愿的精神治疗 要求很严格
Because the laws in New York are pretty tough on involuntary commitment.

711
00:46:21,001 --> 00:46:22,559
你看了那狗屁录影带了么？
Did you see this fucking tape?

712
00:46:22,736 --> 00:46:25,432
我不和你吵，巴里，我在你说这是怎么回事
I'm not arguing with you, Barry. I'm telling you how it is.

713
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:28,735
知道么，伙计们？我们这里有600个律师
You know what, guys? We got 600 lawyers in this place.

714
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,402
我们为什么不去找一个更了解精神病强制 治疗法的人来呢？
Why don't we find out which one knows about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

715
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,242
我现在就可以告诉你为什么，因为他是亚瑟
I can tell you that right now. It's Arthur.

716
00:46:46,896 --> 00:46:48,921
我在门这儿，准备好进去了
I'm at the door. We're good to go.

717
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,762
好的，收到，每5分钟通话一次，明白么？
Yeah, roger that. Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

718
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,097
5分钟一次，收到
Every five minutes, copy that.

719
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:34,303
你好，这里是亚瑟的答录机
Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.

720
00:47:34,479 --> 00:47:37,744
如果你要留言，请在铃声后开始
If you wish to leave a message, please do so after the tone.

721
00:47:38,884 --> 00:47:41,148
亚瑟，快接电话
Arthur, pick up the phone.

722
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,723
亚瑟，快接电话，和我说话
Arthur, pick up the phone and talk to me.

723
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,529
不干？不打算接？
No? Not gonna do it?

724
00:47:51,331 --> 00:47:54,425
不管昨天早上发生了什么，忘掉它，没关系的
What happened yesterday morning, forget it. It doesn't matter.

725
00:47:54,601 --> 00:47:56,660
总有一天我们会一笑置之的
Someday you and I are gonna laugh about it.

726
00:47:56,836 --> 00:47:58,303
但你一定要给我回电话
But you gotta call me back.

727
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:00,871
你要快点儿给我回电话，亚瑟
You gotta call me back soon, Arthur.

728
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,142
我告诉你为什么
I'll tell you what.

729
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,302
因为那是你自己说的，这事有些部分 确实是很疯狂
Because you said it yourself. Part of this is definitely madness.

730
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,846
还有一部分是化学药品的原因，我们都清楚
And there's a chemical part. We both know it.

731
00:48:09,216 --> 00:48:11,241
如果你打算对此采取某些行动…
But if you're willing to start with that...

732
00:48:11,418 --> 00:48:14,546
…我非常愿意去协助你，我会告诉你，是的…
...then I'm more than willing to meet you halfway and say, yes...

733
00:48:14,722 --> 00:48:18,180
…这情况很糟，这案子也很糟 U/North也不是什么好鸟
...this situation sucks. This case sucks. U/North sucks.

734
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,954
我们可以一起行动，好么，亚瑟？ 你听到了么？
We can start with that. All right, Arthur? You hear me?

735
00:48:21,129 --> 00:48:22,790
你那时候说的对
You're right about what we are.

736
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:26,934
我是说你疯了，说你的行为失去了控制
I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying that your behavior is out of control.

737
00:48:27,102 --> 00:48:28,694
但我要告诉你，你说的对
But I'm telling you you're right.

738
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,328
你说过，我们是看门人，我承认
You called it. We're janitors, I get it.

739
00:48:34,276 --> 00:48:36,210
但我们为此而来，亚瑟
But we came to this, Arthur.

740
00:48:37,146 --> 00:48:40,206
我们一起做过决定，那不是容易的事
We made decisions. It didn't happen overnight.

741
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:44,479
你不能突然停下来说：“就这样吧 游戏结束了，我进入了神迹”
You can't just suddenly stop and say, "That's it, game over. I'm into miracles."

742
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:47,218
亚瑟，求求你
Arthur. Come on.

743
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:50,986
该死的，拿起电话来和我说话
Goddamn it, pick up the phone and talk to me.

744
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,493
因为无论你是怎么想的那都很重要…
Because whatever else you think is so important...

745
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:56,394
…你要让我帮助你，因为我会和你谈…
...you better let me help you, because I'm telling you...

746
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:00,764
…直来直去的，看门人和看门人之间 你不用孤军奋战
...janitor to janitor, I don't see anybody else with a broom on the horizon.

747
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:03,371
是我，伙计，我是…
It's me, buddy. I'm the...

748
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:07,534
收件箱已满，您的信息不能被录制
Mailbox is full. Your message cannot be recorded.

749
00:50:08,043 --> 00:50:10,511
- 喂 - 喂，安娜在么？
- Hello? - Hello. Is Anna there?

750
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,044
稍等
Hang on.

751
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:16,974
安娜！
Anna!

752
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:21,080
她上哪儿去了？安娜！
Where is she? Anna!

753
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,388
- 安娜！ - 安娜！
- Anna! - Anna!

754
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:28,660
安娜，有你的电话！
Anna, you've got a phone call!

755
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:33,393
上哪儿去了？安娜！
Where is she? Anna!

756
00:50:44,782 --> 00:50:45,874
喂
Hello?

757
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:48,477
安娜，你好，是我，亚瑟
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

758
00:50:48,652 --> 00:50:51,212
- 你好 - 你休息得好么？
- Hey. - Did you get some sleep?

759
00:50:51,655 --> 00:50:53,213
还行吧
I guess.

760
00:50:53,391 --> 00:50:55,359
你考虑过我们说的事了么？
Did you think about what we said?

761
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:58,155
- 是的 - 你没告诉别人，是么？
- Yeah. - You didn't tell anybody, did you?

762
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:02,857
没有，我姐姐在监视我，但那很正常
No. My sister's spying on me, but that's normal.

763
00:51:03,034 --> 00:51:05,730
好，因为我就是那个意思
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

764
00:51:05,904 --> 00:51:08,304
我知道，我知道，只是…
I know. I know. It's just...

765
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:13,241
…这件案子里有450个人
...there's, like, 450 people in this lawsuit.

766
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,206
你为什么选中我呢？
Why are you choosing me?

767
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:19,882
我也不知道，大概是疯了吧？
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

768
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:21,610
确实是
That's for sure.

769
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,755
我是说，真的…？那真的有关系么？
I mean, does it...? Does it really matter?

770
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:28,087
我说，那不是我们所期待的么？遇见某个人？
I mean, isn't it what we wait for? To meet someone? And they're...

771
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:29,558
他们就像…就像透镜…
They're like a lens...

772
00:51:29,729 --> 00:51:33,392
…你透过他们看世界，突然世界都变了…
...and suddenly you're looking through them and everything changes...

773
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,558
…一切都改变了
...and nothing can ever be the same again.

774
00:51:35,735 --> 00:51:37,396
你跟谁说话呢？
Who you talking to?

775
00:51:37,571 --> 00:51:40,301
找我的，明白吗？也有电话找我的
It's for me, okay? I get calls too.

776
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:41,907
那个人？
That guy?

777
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:45,568
还是那个，还是那个
Same guy. Same guy.

778
00:51:46,214 --> 00:51:47,579
抱歉
Sorry.

779
00:51:48,616 --> 00:51:52,916
不，没…没关系，我妈妈过去也听我打电话
No. That's... That's okay. My mother used to listen to my calls.

780
00:51:53,087 --> 00:51:55,783
她觉得我什么都做不好
She can't believe I can do anything on my own.

781
00:51:55,957 --> 00:51:57,424
嗯，会改变的
Well, that'll change.

782
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,457
我想也是
I guess.

783
00:51:59,628 --> 00:52:02,654
是的，你看，我们可以给她看些东西
Yeah, but, see, that's something we can show her.

784
00:52:02,831 --> 00:52:05,959
让她知道你能行
That you can do something.

785
00:52:06,134 --> 00:52:09,262
如果你需要，我们可以…我们可以一起干
That we could... We could do that together if you want. I mean...

786
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:11,702
我是说，我是说我可以帮助你
I mean that I can help you do that.

787
00:52:12,642 --> 00:52:15,270
周一我可以搞到1万2
I can get you 12 by Monday.

788
00:52:15,445 --> 00:52:17,504
1万2太少了，不怎么好
Twelve's weak. Twelve looks bad.

789
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,147
什么意思？
How do you figure that?

790
00:52:19,315 --> 00:52:22,876
他们看看7万5，再看看你，他们想知道 是哪里出了问题
They look at 75 and they look at you and they wonder what the problem is.

791
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:25,145
而你就给了1万2，这会让他们很紧张的
You say 12. That's gonna make people nervous.

792
00:52:25,321 --> 00:52:28,256
才过了2天，给我点回旋的余地
This was the day before yesterday. Let me get my ducks in order.

793
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:29,653
车值多少？
What's the car worth?

794
00:52:29,827 --> 00:52:32,022
租的，是公司的
It's a lease. It's the firm's.

795
00:52:32,196 --> 00:52:36,098
那么？你去银行，把公寓抵押了，再申请贷款
So? You go to the bank. You've got the apartment. You refinance.

796
00:52:36,267 --> 00:52:38,895
不行，三个月前我就那么干过了
I can't. I did that three months ago.

797
00:52:39,837 --> 00:52:41,532
你是不是又赌牌去了？
Are you back at the tables?

798
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:44,640
看来我得重操旧业了，我没什么闲钱了
Like I need that kind of action. I don't have enough going on.

799
00:52:47,812 --> 00:52:49,837
希望你是在和我说笑呢
I hope you're kidding.

800
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:54,076
要是他发现你用他的钱玩牌，你就完了
If he finds out you're playing cards with his money, there's no dialogue after that.

801
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:57,678
行行好吧
Do everyone a favor.

802
00:52:57,889 --> 00:53:02,292
快把你的藏宝图拿出来挖宝吧
Get out the treasure map and start digging.

803
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:04,552
你有一周的时间
You got a week.

804
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:08,696
- 你好，麦克，还好么？ - 你好，辛迪，我很好
- Hey, Michael. How are you? - Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

805
00:53:08,868 --> 00:53:12,167
请进，他一早上都在打电话，有什么新消息？
Come in. He's been on the phone all morning. What else is new?

806
00:53:12,338 --> 00:53:14,363
我一直在试着让他离开15分钟
I am trying to get him out in 15 minutes.

807
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,974
- 他在楼上么？ - 他把所有的起居室都占了
- Is he upstairs? - He's taken over the living room.

808
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:19,044
你们俩小家伙干啥呢？快下来
What are you guys doing? Get down here.

809
00:53:19,212 --> 00:53:23,979
索罗约，我告诉过你看好孩子，让他们在楼下玩
Soroyo, I told you to keep an eye on these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

810
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:39,989
马蒂？
Marty?

811
00:53:42,236 --> 00:53:45,103
你知道他在干什么吗？他在帮他们打官司
You know what he's doing? He's making their case.

812
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:48,640
我看了他的文件，我看了这个…
I'm going through his files here, I'm reading this...

813
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:50,676
…他在把案子办成针对U/North的
...he's building a case against U/North.

814
00:53:50,846 --> 00:53:52,837
- 没人会允许他这么做的 - 允许他？
- Nobody's gonna let him do that. - Let him?

815
00:53:53,015 --> 00:53:54,414
谁能阻止他？
Who the hell's gonna stop him?

816
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:57,612
你知道我刚听说了什么吗？他在给原告打电话
You know what I just heard? He's calling these plaintiffs.

817
00:53:57,786 --> 00:54:01,984
比如作证的那个女的，他现在在联系这些人
This woman from the deposition, he's calling these people now.

818
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:05,093
他拿到的这些卷宗，简直是他妈的噩梦
He's got these discovery documents. This is a fucking nightmare.

819
00:54:05,261 --> 00:54:08,822
我试着联系他，留不了言，他的答录机满了
I tried him. Can't even leave a message. He's got the machine jammed up.

820
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,524
- 那是他的公文包么？ - 是啊
- Is that his briefcase? - Yeah.

821
00:54:12,102 --> 00:54:13,899
- 怎么了？ - 我们一直在找它
- Why? - We've been looking for it.

822
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,597
我也不知道，它就和他办公室里的 其他破烂一起出现了
I don't know. It came up here with all the other stuff from his office.

823
00:54:17,775 --> 00:54:21,506
你肯定不相信他那儿有多少破烂
You can't believe the crap he's got in here.

824
00:54:22,546 --> 00:54:23,570
我说，马蒂…
Listen, Marty...

825
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:27,881
…我在这儿欠了点钱
...l'm in a bind here.

826
00:54:29,053 --> 00:54:31,783
我得借点钱，8万块
I need a loan. I need 80 grand.

827
00:54:32,957 --> 00:54:35,289
- 我还以为你都解决了呢 - 还没有
- I thought you were done with that. - It's not that.

828
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,293
不是赌牌欠的，那个不欠了，是餐馆的钱
It's not the cards. It's none of that. It's the restaurant.

829
00:54:38,463 --> 00:54:40,055
8万块
Eighty thousand.

830
00:54:40,232 --> 00:54:41,699
很抱歉突然来打扰你
I'm sorry to jump you like this.

831
00:54:41,867 --> 00:54:44,631
两周来我一直试着和你会面
I've been trying to get a meeting with you for two weeks.

832
00:54:45,404 --> 00:54:48,703
还有不管应不应该，我都知道了合并的事
And I know about the merger, whether I'm supposed to or not.

833
00:54:49,107 --> 00:54:50,802
合并的事还没有定论
There's nothing final on the merger.

834
00:54:50,977 --> 00:54:53,912
嗯，那就是为什么我现在问你 你是我的生活来源
Well, that's why I'm asking you now. You're my meal ticket.

835
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,742
一旦你退出了，就剩我和巴里还有一屋子的 陌生人…
Once you're out, it's me and Barry with strangers...

836
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:58,816
…我得能解释我究竟干了些什么
...and I'm trying to explain what I do.

837
00:54:58,985 --> 00:55:02,045
所有人都知道你的价值有多大，大家都知道
Everybody knows how valuable you are. Everybody who needs to know.

838
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:03,882
我都45了，现在还穷得一个子儿也没有
I'm 45 years old and I'm broke.

839
00:55:04,057 --> 00:55:06,753
我冲锋陷阵了12年，什么也没得着
I've been riding shotgun for 12 years and I got no equity.

840
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:08,519
很抱歉，我觉得心里没底
I'm sorry, I don't feel reassured.

841
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:10,720
没人让你去开酒吧啊
Nobody told you to go into the bar business.

842
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:13,458
我开酒吧是为了给自己留条后路啊， 留着养老啊
I only opened it so I'd have something else, a way out.

843
00:55:13,634 --> 00:55:15,295
我不知道原来你这么不开心
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

844
00:55:15,469 --> 00:55:18,495
我跟你说过多少次了，把我调回诉讼团队里
How many times did I ask you to put me back on a litigation team?

845
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:20,333
- 多少次啊？ - 人人都能出庭辩护
- How many? - Anybody can go to court.

846
00:55:20,507 --> 00:55:21,735
你觉得那样很特别么？
You think that's special?

847
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:24,572
- 我擅长那个 - 很好，很多人也擅长那个
- I was good at it. - Wonderful. So are a lot of people.

848
00:55:25,046 --> 00:55:28,413
这件事上，你所做的，很不错
At this, what you do, you're great.

849
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:32,849
看在上帝的份上，你有些东西是别人没有的 你有一个合适的职位
For chrissakes, you got something everybody wants. You have a niche.

850
00:55:33,021 --> 00:55:36,013
你占有一席之地，你为自己挣得了一个 合适的位置
You made a place. You made a niche for yourself.

851
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:40,252
如果你还恋旧的话…“你该看看我在皇后区 当检察官时干的”
And if it's nostalgia..."You should've seen me when I was a DA back in Queens."

852
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:43,830
我给你个忠告：忘掉它吧
- Let me give you a serious piece of advice: Leave it there.

853
00:55:43,999 --> 00:55:47,992
上帝不允许你像记忆中的那么好了，我看也是
God forbid you're not as good as you remember. I've seen that happen too.

854
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:51,396
但我不是来这听忠告的，不是么？
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

855
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,273
那这算怎么回事？我借给你钱 要不你就不帮我搞定亚瑟？
So this is what? I give you the loan or you don't help out with Arthur?

856
00:55:55,445 --> 00:55:57,037
- 我可没说 - 没说？
- I never said that. - No?

857
00:55:57,214 --> 00:55:58,545
也许你该那么说
Maybe you should have.

858
00:55:58,715 --> 00:56:03,379
我不知道你打算怎么处理这事，但这件事 就像癌症一样
I don't know how you're gonna take care of this, but this, this is cancer.

859
00:56:03,553 --> 00:56:06,716
如果我们不迅速地控制住局面，赶快清理干净的话…
This is something, we don't get it reined in and cleaned up soon...

860
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:09,017
…那么一切都完了，一切
...everything's vulnerable. Everything.

861
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:13,160
- 你想跟我说什么？ - 我全靠你了
- What are you telling me? - That I'm counting on you.

862
00:56:13,531 --> 00:56:17,490
我在和你说到下周的这个时候 亚瑟要在掌控之中…
I'm telling you that by this time next week, Arthur will be under control...

863
00:56:17,668 --> 00:56:21,229
…然后大家就都会记得你那无穷的价值的
...and everybody who needs to will have been reminded of your infinite value.

864
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:22,702
上帝啊，马蒂
Jesus, Marty.

865
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:24,373
嘿
Hey.

866
00:56:24,543 --> 00:56:26,568
你什么时候变得他妈的这么软弱了？
When did you get so fucking delicate?

867
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:29,237
我要迟到了
I'm late.

868
00:57:08,889 --> 00:57:11,949
你为什么不找吉奈叔叔请警察来帮忙呢？
Why don't you just call Uncle Gene and get the cops to help you?

869
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:14,152
不是那么回事
It's not that kind of a problem.

870
00:57:15,797 --> 00:57:18,197
- 我们干这个要多长时间？ - 我不知道
- How much longer are we doing this? - I don't know.

871
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:34,013
如果他回来取车，你就拨这个电话告诉我
If he comes back to get his car, you call that number and let me know.

872
00:57:34,183 --> 00:57:37,311
- 多谢了，非常感谢 - 好的，不客气
- Thank you very much. I appreciate it. - Okay. You're welcome.

873
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:47,687
如果我们不是去看电影，你为什么不直说呢？
If we're not gonna get to the movie, why don't you just say so?

874
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:50,628
- 什么？ - 我要回家
- What? - I wanna go home.

875
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,598
别闹，亨利
Come on, Henry.

876
00:57:56,006 --> 00:57:56,995
等下！
Hold up!

877
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:01,909
呆在车里，把门锁好
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

878
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,517
亚瑟！亚瑟！
Arthur! Arthur!

879
00:58:06,684 --> 00:58:08,015
等等
Wait up.

880
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:12,254
麦克，天啊，你吓了我一跳
Michael. Jeez. You scared me.

881
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:16,388
- 送货去？ - 不，不，不是
- Making a delivery? - No, no, no.

882
00:58:17,229 --> 00:58:19,857
挺搞笑，不是，不是那么回事
Very funny. No, nothing like that.

883
00:58:20,032 --> 00:58:23,627
给，拿一根，拿着，还…还热呢
Here, take one, please. Really. It's... It's still warm.

884
00:58:23,802 --> 00:58:25,429
这是我吃过的最香的面包
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

885
00:58:29,476 --> 00:58:31,205
欢迎回来
So welcome home.

886
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:35,314
我知道，宾馆的事，很抱歉
I know, the hotel. I'm sorry.

887
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:37,848
我感觉有点儿压抑
I was beginning to feel a little overwhelmed.

888
00:58:38,018 --> 00:58:39,849
- 你现在感觉好些了么？ - 是啊
- But you're feeling better now? - Yeah.

889
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,511
- 好多了，确实 - 还没好到能给我回电话
- Much better, definitely. - Not enough to call me back.

890
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:45,920
嗯，那个，在打电话之前，我想…
Well, I was trying to gather my thoughts...

891
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:49,688
整理好我的思路，就是这么回事
...before I called you, and that's what I was doing.

892
00:58:50,331 --> 00:58:51,730
那件事怎么样？
And how's that going?

893
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:54,367
很好，非常好，就是…
Yes, it's good, very good. I just...

894
00:58:54,669 --> 00:59:00,073
嗯，就是我需要把思路理得更清晰些 那就是…
Well, I just need to make my thoughts a little bit more precise. That's...

895
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:01,538
那就是我的目标
That's my goal.

896
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:05,077
和这感觉一样的是你知道它会怎么发展
As good as this feels, you know where it goes.

897
00:59:05,247 --> 00:59:06,646
不，不，你错了
No. No. You're wrong.

898
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:09,909
这感觉之所以好，是因为我不知道它会 怎么发展
What makes this feel good is that I don't know where it goes.

899
00:59:11,086 --> 00:59:14,249
我怎么跟你说呢，亚瑟？你听我的吗？
How do I talk to you, Arthur? So you hear me?

900
00:59:14,423 --> 00:59:18,951
像个孩子？像个混球？还是好像一切都好？
Like a child? Like a nut? Like everything's fine?

901
00:59:19,128 --> 00:59:22,894
你有什么秘密？因为我需要你听我说
What's the secret? Because I need you to hear me.

902
00:59:23,066 --> 00:59:25,830
- 嗯，我什么都听的 - 那么听着这个
- Well, I hear everything. - Then hear this.

903
00:59:26,269 --> 00:59:30,228
你需要帮助，在事情无法挽回之前，你需要帮助
You need help. Before this goes too far, you need help.

904
00:59:30,406 --> 00:59:31,634
你的牌很好
You got great cards here.

905
00:59:31,808 --> 00:59:35,141
要是你能把衣服穿好，你爱他妈干什么 就干什么
If you keep your clothes on, you can do any goddamn thing you want.

906
00:59:35,312 --> 00:59:38,543
你想不干了，你就可以不干了 你想烤面包，烤去呗
You want out, you're out. You wanna bake bread, go with God.

907
00:59:38,716 --> 00:59:41,412
这一大堆破事里你就办错了一件…
There's only one wrong answer in this whole goddamn pile...

908
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:43,348
…但你还护着短儿不承认
...and you've got your arms around it.

909
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,819
- 好吧，我说了我很抱歉 - 你觉得那旅馆很压抑？
- Well, I said I was sorry. - You thought the hotel was overwhelming?

910
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:49,550
你让这案子难过，他们就会打断你的腿
You piss on this case, they'll cut you off at the knees.

911
00:59:49,728 --> 00:59:52,993
- 我不知道你在说什么 - 我在给你收拾烂摊子
- I don't know what you're talking about. - I'm covering for you.

912
00:59:53,164 --> 00:59:56,656
我跟他们说一切都好，你很好 一切都会好的，大家都很好
I'm telling them everything's fine. You're fine. Everybody's cool.

913
00:59:56,835 --> 01:00:00,066
我到处给人讲“天才的价值”的故事
I'm out running this "price of genius" story to anybody who'll listen.

914
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:04,470
但今天早上我一起来，就听说你和这个 威斯康星来的姑娘联系上了
And then I wake up this morning and I hear you're calling this girl from Wisconsin...

915
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:06,508
…还有什么该死的文件和其他一些破烂儿
...messing with documents and whatever else.

916
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:09,204
- 你怎么知道的？ - 他们掌控着一切
- How can you know that? - They're gonna take everything.

917
01:00:09,382 --> 01:00:12,874
你的合伙身份、你的流通股 他们会吊销你的执照
Your partnership, your equity. They're gonna pull your license.

918
01:00:13,052 --> 01:00:15,213
- 你怎么知道我给安娜打了电话？ - 马蒂告诉我的
- How do you know I called Anna? - Marty told me.

919
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:19,154
- 那么，他怎么知道的？ - 我不知道，我可没胡扯！
- Well, how does he know? - I don't know. I don't give a shit!

920
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:24,797
- 你在窃听我的电话 - 天啊，亚瑟
- You're tapping my phone. - Jesus, Arthur.

921
01:00:24,965 --> 01:00:26,830
那么解释一下，告诉我马蒂怎么知道的！
Then explain it. Tell me how Marty knows!

922
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,869
因为你晃着小弟弟追着个姑娘跑过了 整个停车场
Because you're chasing a girl through a parking lot with your dick hanging out.

923
01:00:32,038 --> 01:00:34,871
你觉得她不会拿起电话打给她的律师么？
You think she didn't get off the phone and dial her attorney?

924
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:36,906
不，她不会那么做的，我清楚这一点
No. She wouldn't do that. I know that.

925
01:00:37,078 --> 01:00:40,070
真的？你认为你的判断力已经达到 “艺术欣赏”的水平了么？
Really? You think your judgment is state-of-the-art right now?

926
01:00:41,549 --> 01:00:45,849
他们准备要亮底牌了，你得停下来好好想想
They're putting everything on the table. You need to stop and think this through.

927
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:47,544
我会帮你一起想的
I'll help you think this through.

928
01:00:47,722 --> 01:00:49,952
我会找人帮你想想的
I'll find somebody to help you think it through.

929
01:00:50,625 --> 01:00:54,288
别这样，你这样会便宜了他们
Don't do this. You're making it easy for them.

930
01:00:55,964 --> 01:00:59,127
麦克，我非常喜欢你的为人
Michael, I have great affection for you.

931
01:00:59,301 --> 01:01:03,601
你过着丰富多彩的生活，但你只是个跑腿的 不是辩护律师
You lead a very rich and interesting life, but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

932
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:06,037
如果你想要控告我…
If you wanted to have me committed...

933
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:10,076
你最好让我呆在威斯康星州，那里有逮捕记录
...you should have kept me in Wisconsin, where the arrest report, the videotape...

934
01:01:10,246 --> 01:01:12,908
…录像带和目击证人来证明我有不当行为…
...and eyewitness accounts of my inappropriate behavior...

935
01:01:13,082 --> 01:01:15,050
…那里才有审判管辖权
...would have had jurisdictional relevance.

936
01:01:15,218 --> 01:01:17,618
我在纽约州没有任何犯罪记录
I have no criminal record in the state of New York.

937
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:23,321
对于非自愿监禁的唯一判断标准就是威胁性
And the single determining criterion for involuntary incarceration is danger.

938
01:01:23,494 --> 01:01:26,861
被告是否对自己或者他人造成了威胁？
Is the defendant a danger to himself or others?

939
01:01:27,031 --> 01:01:29,727
你觉得你整明白了吗？
You think you got the horses for that?

940
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:32,630
好了，祝你好运，愿上帝保佑你 但我要告诉你：
Well, good luck and God bless. But I tell you this:

941
01:01:33,904 --> 01:01:38,034
你绝对不会愿意在法庭上见到我的
The last place you want to see me is in court.

942
01:01:38,877 --> 01:01:40,708
我不是你的敌人
I'm not the enemy.

943
01:01:41,213 --> 01:01:43,238
那你是谁？
Then who are you?

944
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:57,795
我们发现种子
We find the seed.

945
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,894
我们保育土壤
We shape the soil.

946
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,933
我们加速收获
We speed the harvest.

947
01:02:11,111 --> 01:02:13,045
我们抚育星球
We feed the planet.

948
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:26,520
我们发现种子
We find the seed.

949
01:02:30,632 --> 01:02:32,497
我们保育土壤
We shape the soil.

950
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:37,738
我们加速收获
We speed the harvest.

951
01:02:39,941 --> 01:02:41,169
我们抚育星球
We feed the planet.

952
01:02:59,462 --> 01:03:01,259
这小子干啥呢？
What the hell is he doing?

953
01:03:18,816 --> 01:03:20,545
我们发现种子
We find the seed.

954
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,851
您现在访问的是肯纳、巴赫和莱迪恩事务所 亚瑟・伊顿的语音信箱
You've reached the voicemail of Arthur Edens at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

955
01:03:26,023 --> 01:03:27,888
请在提示音后留言
Please leave your message after the tone.

956
01:03:28,694 --> 01:03:29,854
好啊！
Yes!

957
01:03:30,195 --> 01:03:34,063
是我啊，大伙，大家都在听吗？
Here we are, all together. Is everyone listening?

958
01:03:34,232 --> 01:03:37,668
这就是你们期待已久的时刻 一页非常特别的报告
This is the moment you've been waiting for. A very special piece of paper.

959
01:03:37,836 --> 01:03:41,363
让我们用充满病态和恶意的掌声欢迎…
So let's have a big, paranoid, malignant round of applause...

960
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:46,807
北地联合克林泰特内部研究备忘录229号
...for United Northfield Culcitate Internal Research Memorandum 229.

961
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:50,245
1991年1月19日发布
June 19th, 1991.

962
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:52,143
“结论如下：
"Conclusion:

963

是基于小型农庄在寒冷气候下的 即时成本―利益分析”
...by small farms in colder climates demands immediate cost-benefit analysis."

965
01:04:01,261 --> 01:04:04,230
你们这帮家伙想不想听点儿法律建议？
Would you guys like a little bit of legal advice?

966
01:04:04,398 --> 01:04:07,265
永远不要让科学家把“出乎意料”…
Never let a scientist use the words "unanticipated"...

967
01:04:07,434 --> 01:04:10,528
…和“即时”放在一个句子里
...and "immediate" in the same sentence.

968
01:04:10,704 --> 01:04:12,535
明白了吧？好的
Okay? Okay.

969
01:04:12,706 --> 01:04:15,140
“内部土地试验显示…
"In-house field studies have indicated...

970
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:20,042
…小型短期农庄人类活动所必需的井水…
...that small short-season farms dependent on well water for human consumption...

…其中的毒素颗粒有聚集到…
...are at risk for toxic particulate concentrations at levels...

972
01:04:24,552 --> 01:04:28,454
…能够对人体组织造成损害的程度的风险”
...significant enough to cause serious human tissue damage."

973
01:04:28,623 --> 01:04:31,023
这个么，绕了半天，就是要说…
Well, this is a long way of saying that...

974
01:04:31,192 --> 01:04:34,525
你都不用离开房子就能被我们的产品干掉了
...you don't even have to leave your house to be killed by our product.

975
01:04:34,697 --> 01:04:36,756
我们把毒药直接送到你们家厨房
We'll pipe it into your kitchen sink.

976
01:04:37,299 --> 01:04:40,063
- “克林泰特它无味、无色而且不易凝结… - 把电话给我
- " Culcitate's great market advantage... - Give me the phone.

977
01:04:40,236 --> 01:04:43,137
…这所谓的巨大市场优势…
...that it is tasteless, colorless and does not precipitate...

978
01:04:43,305 --> 01:04:45,967
…有可能掩盖并加强…
...has the potential to mask and intensify...

979
01:04:46,142 --> 01:04:48,702
…露天放置导致的潜在致命威胁”
...these potentially lethal exposures."

980
01:04:48,879 --> 01:04:50,676
现在，我喜欢这东西了
Now, I love this.

981
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:52,747
这不仅是个伟大的产品…
Not only is this a great product...

982
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:56,613
…还是个超级癌症制造系统
...it is a superb cancer delivery system.

983
01:04:56,787 --> 01:04:59,517
“克林泰特产品化学成分的改变…
"Chemical modifications of the Culcitate product...

984

...the addition of a detector molecule, such as an odorant or colorant...

985
01:05:04,062 --> 01:05:08,931
…将会需要自上而下地重新设计克林泰特的 整个生产工序
...would require a top-down redesign of the Culcitate manufacturing process.

986
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,193
这方面的花费，由于太过巨大…
These costs, while assumed to be significant...

987
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:14,167
…将不在此处进行计算”
...were not summarized here."

988
01:05:14,338 --> 01:05:16,272
这个么，笼统地说，意思就是：
Which, loosely translated, means:

989
01:05:16,441 --> 01:05:20,502
“这玩意儿改好要破好大一笔财 而我就是个实验室里的小喽…
"It's going to cost a fortune to go back on this, and I'm just an asshole in a lab...

990
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:23,807
…因此有没有别人能做个决定啊？”
...so could someone else please make the decision?"

991
01:05:24,116 --> 01:05:27,677
“很明显，这份内部研究文档的发布…
"Clearly, the release of these internal research documents...

992
01:05:27,853 --> 01:05:30,549
…将会动摇克林泰特的有效市场份额…
...would compromise the effective marketing of Culcitate...

993
01:05:31,223 --> 01:05:34,420
…因此必须被定为…
...and must be kept within the protective confines...

994
01:05:34,594 --> 01:05:37,688
北地联合公司的商业机密”
...of United-Northfield's trade secret language."

995
01:05:38,998 --> 01:05:43,594
你们不需要我给你们解释了吧
You don't need me to tell you what that means.

996
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,167
再见
Goodbye.

997
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,400
- 看来我要… - 是
- It seemed to warrant my coming to... - Yes.

998
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:54,841
你必须要控制住局势
You have to contain this.

999
01:05:56,584 --> 01:05:58,814
- 控制住？ - 对
- Contain? - Right.

1000
01:05:59,353 --> 01:06:01,412
好吧，那是我的问题
Well, that's my question.

1001
01:06:02,189 --> 01:06:06,523
我们…？我们有什么解决方案么？
What are the? What's the option that we're looking at?

1002
01:06:06,695 --> 01:06:08,526
对于这个情况
Along those lines.

1003
01:06:08,697 --> 01:06:11,723
你是说那些文件、数据？我不知…
You're talking about the paper, the data? I don't...

1004
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:17,071
嗯，我在想是不是还有其他选择
Well, I'm wondering if there is some other option.

1005
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,104
我是说有什么我没想到的？
I mean something I'm not thinking of?

1006
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:21,809
我们什么都能干
We deal in absolutes.

1007
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,879
好的，我明白，我明白了
Okay. I understand that. I do.

1008
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:30,485
那些材料、资料，我又不是律师 我们试试看，尽力吧
The material, the papers, I'm not a lawyer. We try, we do what we can.

1009
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,484
嗯，其他手段呢？
Well, the other way?

1010
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:36,389
其他手段
Is the other way.

1011
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:42,788
- 也许你该把丹找来处理这事 - 不
- Maybe you wanna bring Don in on this. - No.

1012
01:06:42,966 --> 01:06:46,458
这事和丹没关系，他很忙，这和他没关系
This is nothing to do with Don. He's busy. This is nothing to do with Don.

1013
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,208
你觉得可行么？
Do you think it's doable?

1014
01:06:56,681 --> 01:06:59,946
嗯，我们有些好主意，你说行动，我们就行动
Yeah. We have some good ideas. You say move, we move.

1015
01:07:00,118 --> 01:07:03,212
如果这主意看起来不怎么好，我们就按兵不动 再想想看
If the ideas don't look so good, we back off, reassess...

1016
01:07:03,388 --> 01:07:04,719
好吧
Okay.

1017
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:12,253
你的意思是“好吧，你明白了” 还是“好吧，行动”？
Is that, "Okay, you understand," or "Okay, proceed"?

1018
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:18,799
你1岁？你2岁？你3岁？
Are you 1? Are you 2? Are you 3?

1019
01:07:18,971 --> 01:07:22,099
你4岁？你5岁？你6岁？
Are you 4? Are you 5? Are you 6?

1020
01:07:22,274 --> 01:07:24,469
- 你7岁？你8岁？你9岁？ - 行了
- Are you 7? Are you 8? Are you 9? - Come on.

1021
01:07:24,644 --> 01:07:27,078
行了，行了，我说了，嘿！
Come, come on. Come on, I said. Hey!

1022
01:07:27,948 --> 01:07:29,813
别说了
Come on.

1023
01:07:29,983 --> 01:07:31,644
好了，爸爸，许愿吧
Go on, Dad, make a wish.

1024
01:07:31,818 --> 01:07:33,752
要是愿望成真，我就爽死了
If I get what I wish for, it'll kill me.

1025
01:07:34,554 --> 01:07:37,216
你是个狂人，不可思议
You're a maniac. Unbelievable.

1026
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,324
帮我一把，埃迪，哈？
Give me a hand, Eddie, huh?

1027
01:07:41,762 --> 01:07:43,627
好的，埃迪
All right, Eddie.

1028
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:47,097
嗯，不是我自己做的，不好吃别赖我
Now, I did not make this myself and I don't wanna hear any complaints.

1029
01:07:47,268 --> 01:07:48,701
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1030
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,633
你有时间吃蛋糕么？
You have time for cake?

1031
01:07:51,138 --> 01:07:53,402
有，有啊，我吃一块再走
Yeah, yeah. I'll take one to go.

1032
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:54,563
要走了？
You going in?

1033
01:07:56,311 --> 01:07:58,472
- 我已经迟到了 - 该死
- I'm late already. - Shit.

1034
01:07:58,647 --> 01:08:00,046
你俩不是都没钱了吧？
You're not both running out?

1035
01:08:00,215 --> 01:08:01,978
我有点儿状况
I got a situation.

1036
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:03,811
- 你挺不住了 - 你要走了
- You can't hang? - You're going in.

1037
01:08:03,986 --> 01:08:06,352
- 是啊，我要轮班 - 我也有
- Yeah. I got a shift. - So do I.

1038
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:09,490
得了吧，伙计，好几个月你都没来了
Come on, man. You haven't been up here in months.

1039
01:08:09,658 --> 01:08:12,593
要是你现在就回去，米奇（麦克的昵称） 亨利要留在这儿
If you go back now, Mickey, Henry's staying here.

1040
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:15,128
好吧，你可以开车送他回去
Good. You can drive him home.

1041
01:08:15,298 --> 01:08:16,731
就呆一个小时
Just stay for an hour.

1042
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,097
姑娘们才干这事呢
The girls did all this stuff.

1043
01:08:20,003 --> 01:08:21,402
他那时候就睡着了
He'll be asleep by then.

1044
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,368
提米给我打电话了
Timmy's been calling me.

1045
01:08:31,348 --> 01:08:32,872
他不敢跟你谈
He's afraid to talk to you.

1046
01:08:33,050 --> 01:08:34,176
他是不敢
He should be.

1047
01:08:34,351 --> 01:08:36,945
- 清仓不怎么顺利，是吧？ - 他是这么跟你说的？
- It closed out bad, right? - Is that what he told you?

1048
01:08:37,121 --> 01:08:39,089
孩子们都吓坏了
The kids are freaking out.

1049
01:08:39,456 --> 01:08:40,821
亲戚们也吓坏了
The in-laws are freaking out.

1050
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:44,818
帕米害怕得哭个不停
Pammy can't stop crying long enough to start freaking out.

1051
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:48,659
- 她把他领回去了 - 那能怎样？去他妈的老婆孩子？
- She took him back. - So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1052
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:51,461
不，去他妈的提米，一切都没完，明白么？
No. Fuck Timmy. And nothing's closed, okay?

1053
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:55,333
我把所有东西都卖了，但我们还是差点儿 所以别老提什么帕米和孩子
I sold everything and we're still short. So don't talk about Pammy and the kids.

1054
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,565
我全担下来了
I got my hands full.

1055
01:08:57,008 --> 01:09:00,444
这事要是你，他就不会这么懒
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1056
01:09:01,714 --> 01:09:03,739
好了，他病了，行了吧？
Yeah, he's sick, all right?

1057
01:09:04,917 --> 01:09:08,148
- 他有病，那是种病 - 这观点挺新鲜
- He's sick. It's a sickness. - There's a fresh perspective.

1058
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:12,587
最近我看到不少人旧瘾复发，到处都是
I've seen a lot of people falling off the wagon lately. It's going around.

1059
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:15,354
你是在说我么？
Is that pointed at me?

1060
01:09:17,664 --> 01:09:20,394
我什么时候见过你？我怎么知道你都在忙啥？
When do I see you? How do I know what you're up to?

1061
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,933
我有一年多没赌钱了
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1062
01:09:23,103 --> 01:09:25,594
我有10个月没进过扑克室了
I haven't been in a card room in 10 months.

1063
01:09:25,772 --> 01:09:28,832
我把宝押在了酒吧上，押在了提米身上 结果他给我搞砸了
I gambled on the bar. I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1064
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:30,567
那就是我的大买卖，行了吧？
That was my big play, all right?

1065
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:34,579
我把养老的钱都投进去了，现在没了 我穷困潦倒
I put up my walk-away money and it's gone and I'm scrambling.

1066
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:37,343
好了，好了
Okay. Okay.

1067
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:40,354
冷静点儿，我听着呢
Cool down. I hear you.

1068
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:47,318
我也被耍了
I'd be pissed off too.

1069
01:09:53,602 --> 01:09:55,229
等1个小时就好
Just hang for an hour.

1070
01:09:56,138 --> 01:09:58,197
- 好么？ - 好吧
- Okay? - Yeah.

1071
01:10:32,508 --> 01:10:34,908
准备好了？好，抬
Ready? And, lift.

1072
01:10:35,078 --> 01:10:37,410
预备，走
Ready and go.

1073
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:02,430
擦擦
Wipe.

1074
01:11:11,616 --> 01:11:13,516
你可以扎了
You better hit it.

1075
01:11:47,087 --> 01:11:48,452
搞定了
We're good.

1076
01:12:22,791 --> 01:12:25,919
好的，我找到了，这是他的号码
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1077
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:28,121
穆林大夫，看你的运气了
Dr. Mullien. See if you have any more luck.

1078
01:12:28,298 --> 01:12:30,232
好吧，如果我能，我一有机会就去
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1079
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,494
有医疗补助的，我们都有，我可以给你文件…
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circles. I can pull the file...

1080
01:12:33,670 --> 01:12:35,535
让他走吧，斯蒂芬，他有约会
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1081
01:12:35,705 --> 01:12:37,969
我和一个疯狂律师有约
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1082
01:12:38,141 --> 01:12:40,735
- 晚上别工作了，米奇 - 你看起来很疲倦
- Take a night off, Mickey. - You look tired.

1083
01:12:40,912 --> 01:12:42,903
- 我没事，回见 - 好好的
- I'm okay. See you soon. - Be good.

1084
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,310
- 好了，再见 - 再见，亨利
- All right. Bye. - Bye, Hen.

1085
01:12:45,483 --> 01:12:47,178
- 再见，爸爸 - 再见
- Bye, Pop. - Bye.

1086
01:12:57,229 --> 01:12:59,595
- 提米叔叔，你好啊！ - 你怎么样啊，亨利？
- Uncle Timmy, hey! - How you doing, Henry?

1087
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:01,096
亨利，快上车
Henry, get in the car.

1088
01:13:03,769 --> 01:13:05,202
见到你很高兴，亨利
Good to see you, Hen.

1089
01:13:07,105 --> 01:13:09,869
- 你想要什么？ - 我已经戒酒8天了
- What do you want? - I've been sober eight days now.

1090
01:13:10,877 --> 01:13:14,540
出来见几个面，我想让你知道
Been back at the meetings. I wanted you to know.

1091
01:13:14,714 --> 01:13:16,341
在孩子面前？
In front of the kid?

1092
01:13:16,516 --> 01:13:20,008
米奇，求你了，我知道我曾经有多坏，我发誓
Mickey, please. I know how bad I did, I swear.

1093
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,615
我不知道该怎么走上正轨，我满脑子想的 都是这个
I don't know how to make it right again. It's all I think about.

1094
01:13:25,124 --> 01:13:27,422
我该怎么做？我知道干什么
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1095
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:31,054
把轮胎还给斯蒂芬娜
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1096
01:13:36,337 --> 01:13:39,306
- 他哭了？ - 不知道
- Is he crying? - I don't know.

1097
01:13:39,473 --> 01:13:41,304
因为吸了毒，是么？
Because of drugs, right?

1098
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:43,272
差不多就那玩意儿
That and everything else.

1099
01:14:14,645 --> 01:14:16,112
怎么了？
What?

1100
01:14:18,382 --> 01:14:19,747
你提米叔叔…
Your Uncle Timmy...

1101
01:14:20,417 --> 01:14:25,912
我是说，在他最风光的时候 也没有像你这样坚强
...and I mean this, on his best day, is never as tough as you.

1102
01:14:26,957 --> 01:14:30,120
我不是说他哭了，或者吸毒什么的
I'm not talking about crying or the drugs or anything.

1103
01:14:30,294 --> 01:14:33,388
我是在说他的心，内心里，你明白么？
I'm talking about in his heart, in his heart. You understand me?

1104
01:14:34,465 --> 01:14:38,333
他就会胡诌，吹的天花乱坠的
And all his charming bullshit, this Big Tim, Uncle, Boss bullshit...

1105
01:14:38,503 --> 01:14:40,698
…我知道你爱他，我知道为什么
...and I know you love him, and I know why.

1106
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:42,669
但当你看见他那熊样…
But when you see him like that...

1107
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:45,604
…你不必担心，你不会成为那样的人的
...you don't have to worry. That's not how it'll be for you.

1108
01:14:45,778 --> 01:14:48,338
你不会成为那种天天慨叹…
You're not gonna be someone that goes through life...

1109
01:14:48,514 --> 01:14:52,109
…为什么自己老是踩到臭狗屎的人
...wondering why shit keeps falling out of the sky around them.

1110
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:54,684
我知道，我知道这一点
I know that. I know it.

1111
01:14:54,853 --> 01:14:56,150
明白么？
Okay?

1112
01:15:00,392 --> 01:15:04,556
每次我看着你我都能看出这一点来 我现在就能看到
I see it every time I look at you. I see it right now.

1113
01:15:06,866 --> 01:15:09,596
我不知道你是从哪儿获得的，但你确实有
I don't know where you got it from, but you got it.

1114
01:15:11,304 --> 01:15:12,635
明白么？
Okay?

1115
01:15:25,853 --> 01:15:27,150
喂
Hello?

1116
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:41,067
邻居过来了，他们在修理楼下的阁楼
The neighbors came by. They're renovating the loft downstairs.

1117
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:45,866
他们发现有水流从他的盥洗室流到下面
They had water flooding from his bathroom down to their place.

1118
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:51,510
他的前门、紧急通道，都被他锁得严严实实
His front door, fire escape, he had everything locked up pretty good.

1119
01:15:51,681 --> 01:15:56,015
我的人花了10分钟才进去，还不得不把门砸掉
It took our guys 10 minutes. They had to knock the thing down.

1120
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:59,954
到处都是药丸
There's pills all over the place.

1121
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:05,820
完全就是自杀的现场
Just the scene alone is pretty definitive for suicide.

1122
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:08,930
然后我问了一些最近处理过这种事的…
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1123
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:12,694
你的老熟人，因此…
...who ran down these problems he'd been having lately, so...

1124
01:16:15,038 --> 01:16:18,201
- 有遗言么？ - 没有，他们看过了
- Is there a note? - No. They looked.

1125
01:16:18,776 --> 01:16:23,338
可能是个意外或者他本打算写遗言但没写成
It could be an accident or he was gonna write a note and just messed up.

1126
01:16:24,415 --> 01:16:25,712
我能进去么？
Can I get in there?

1127
01:16:25,884 --> 01:16:28,910
他的住处？现在不行，已经封闭了
His place? Not now. It's sealed.

1128
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:33,785
一旦现场封闭，一切都冻结了，我们会试着 联系他的女儿
Once the seal goes up, it's frozen. We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1129
01:16:33,958 --> 01:16:37,086
我想她在欧洲，但她就要回来了
I guess she's off in Europe. But she's gotta come in.

1130
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,790
还要等尸检官的毒物报告检测结果
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back with a toxicology report.

1131
01:16:40,966 --> 01:16:44,663
至少要花几周的时间，只能那样了
That's a couple of weeks at least that it's gotta stay like that.

1132
01:16:45,104 --> 01:16:46,469
抱歉
Sorry.

1133
01:16:48,507 --> 01:16:49,974
没事
Sure.

1134
01:16:56,249 --> 01:16:57,238
好吧
Okay.

1135
01:17:01,488 --> 01:17:06,084
我认识你弟弟，我妻子在皇后区那边做事
I know your brother a little. My wife works the 190 out in Queens.

1136
01:17:07,728 --> 01:17:08,888
代我向他问好
I'll tell him hello.

1137
01:17:09,063 --> 01:17:11,088
如果有什么新情况，我会和你联系的
If something comes in, I'll get back to you.

1138
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:13,331
好的，谢谢你
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1139
01:17:13,501 --> 01:17:15,298
对您的损失感到很难过
I'm sorry for your loss.

1140
01:17:33,789 --> 01:17:36,383
- 麦克 - 杰夫
- Michael. - Jeff.

1141
01:17:36,558 --> 01:17:38,025
这真难过
This is tough.

1142
01:17:38,194 --> 01:17:39,786
是，是啊，他在这儿么？
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1143
01:17:51,342 --> 01:17:53,537
沉默寡言的混球
Dumb son of a bitch.

1144
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:55,170
多么可怕
What a thing.

1145
01:17:55,346 --> 01:17:57,576
- 稍等 - 我都不知道…
- Hold on. - I don't even know...

1146
01:17:57,748 --> 01:17:59,648
- 真抱歉 - 嗯，没关系
- I'm so sorry. - Yeah. All right.

1147
01:17:59,817 --> 01:18:03,048
我都没机会和他聊聊
I didn't even get a chance to talk to him.

1148
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,678
那个该死的老疯子
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1149
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:10,217
多大的损失啊，他到底在想什么？
What a waste. What the hell was he thinking?

1150
01:18:10,896 --> 01:18:12,727
马蒂？我得处理一下这事
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1151
01:18:12,898 --> 01:18:14,422
去，去吧
Go. Go.

1152
01:18:15,166 --> 01:18:16,497
你还好吧？
You okay?

1153
01:18:17,235 --> 01:18:18,998
嗯，还好
Yeah, I'm fine.

1154
01:18:20,272 --> 01:18:22,331
来，咱们喝一杯
Come on, let's get you a drink.

1155
01:18:25,177 --> 01:18:29,409
我一直在回味这件事，比如，是不是 我给他的压力太大了？
I just keep replaying all this back. Like, did I push him too hard?

1156
01:18:29,582 --> 01:18:30,810
不可能
Not a chance.

1157
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:32,780
我一直没法和他沟通
I just couldn't get through to him.

1158
01:18:32,952 --> 01:18:36,115
得了，你把他吓死了？算了吧 那家伙倔得像头牛
What, you scared him to death? Come on. The man was a bull.

1159
01:18:36,589 --> 01:18:40,218
- 不是那样的 - 他后来为什么屈服了？为什么他…？
- Never happened. - Why does he fold, then? Why does he?

1160
01:18:42,262 --> 01:18:44,127
那一定是场意外
It's gotta be an accident.

1161
01:18:44,298 --> 01:18:45,856
不，不可能，亚瑟会没留下便条？
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1162
01:18:46,033 --> 01:18:49,002
他连撒个尿都要写个备忘录呢，一定是意外
He couldn't piss without leaving a memo. Has to be an accident.

1163
01:18:49,169 --> 01:18:51,433
我不相信，我搞不明白
I don't get that. I don't understand that either.

1164
01:18:51,605 --> 01:18:53,835
前一分钟他还打算控制全世界…
One minute he's gonna take on the whole world...

1165
01:18:54,007 --> 01:18:57,033
…12小时之后，他却自行了断了，为什么呢？
...and then 12 hours later, he's sucking down pills. Why?

1166
01:18:57,211 --> 01:18:58,610
为什么？
Why?

1167
01:19:00,048 --> 01:19:03,245
因为所有人都是他妈的不可理喻的，“为什么？”
Because people are fucking incomprehensible. "Why?"

1168
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:10,579
我认识亚瑟30年了
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1169
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,721
好日子啊
Good years.

1170
01:19:14,263 --> 01:19:18,427
如果我够诚实，我现在的感觉是什么？
And what I feel right now, if I'm honest?

1171
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:23,761
我说不出来，太糟了
I can't even say, it's so awful.

1172
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:26,568
你能说的
You can say it.

1173
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:31,012
我们只不过比他幸运些
We caught a lucky break.

1174
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:36,315
确实啊，不是么？
We did, didn't we?

1175
01:19:41,024 --> 01:19:44,460
马蒂？我们得去一下办公室
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1176
01:19:44,628 --> 01:19:46,357
- 他们同意了？ - 原则上
- They accepted? - In principle.

1177
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,363
丹・杰弗瑞要我们半小时内听电话
Don Jeffries wants us on the phone in half an hour.

1178
01:19:49,533 --> 01:19:52,434
我试着解释亚瑟的事，但他们没有什么同情心
I tried to explain about Arthur, but they're short on sympathy.

1179
01:19:52,603 --> 01:19:54,503
等一下，U/North自己处理呢？
Wait a minute. U/North is settling?

1180
01:19:54,672 --> 01:19:58,733
他们看到了一线希望，他们想试试 这是他们的事，我们能干什么？
They see a window. They wanna try. It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1181
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:03,607
你尽力了，麦克，我们都尽力了
You did what you could, Michael. We all did.

1182
01:20:05,017 --> 01:20:06,348
这是…
It's...

1183
01:20:06,518 --> 01:20:08,179
这就是我们得到的
It's what we got.

1184
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:12,154
- 你需要送一下么？ - 不，谢了，我很好
- You need a ride? - No, thanks, I'm fine.

1185
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:45,948
喂
Hello.

1186
01:20:46,127 --> 01:20:48,721
喂，你好，我找安娜・凯泽森
Hello. Hi. I'm looking for Anna Kysersun.

1187
01:20:48,897 --> 01:20:49,989
你是谁？
Who is this?

1188
01:20:50,165 --> 01:20:53,657
麦克・克莱顿，我是纽约的一名律师 我是从亚瑟那里得到你的号码的
Michael Clayton. I'm an attorney in New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1189
01:20:53,835 --> 01:20:56,702
- 你们可真有种阿 - 什么？
- You have got some nerve. - Excuse me?

1190
01:20:56,871 --> 01:21:00,671
你们让她飞到纽约去，还把她一个人留在机场？
You get her all the way to New York City and then leave her at the airport?

1191
01:21:01,077 --> 01:21:02,669
她是个单纯的人
This is not a complicated person.

1192
01:21:02,845 --> 01:21:05,678
这姑娘从来没去过比密尔沃基远的地方
This is a girl who's never been farther than Milwaukee.

1193
01:21:05,848 --> 01:21:07,839
- 等一下，等等 - 不，你等着
- Wait a minute. Now, wait. - No, you wait.

1194
01:21:08,017 --> 01:21:12,249
她明天就要回家了，她回来以后，你们要是再…
She's coming home tomorrow and when she does, if you call here again...

1195
01:21:12,421 --> 01:21:14,719
你是说她现在在纽约么？
Are you telling me she's in New York right now?

1196
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:17,182
这还是个小姑娘，你听着没有？
This is a young girl, do you hear me?

1197
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,794
她现在就在城里？
She's in the city right now?

1198
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:21,521
你是什么人？
What kind of people are you?

1199
01:21:21,698 --> 01:21:24,724
听着，等我一会儿，就一会儿
Listen. You just stay on the phone one second. One second.

1200
01:21:57,436 --> 01:21:58,664
安娜
Anna.

1201
01:22:01,073 --> 01:22:02,563
安娜？
Anna?

1202
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:06,345
我叫麦克・克莱顿，是亚瑟的一个朋友
My name's Michael Clayton. I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1203
01:22:06,513 --> 01:22:09,175
我问了你姐姐，她说你在这儿
I spoke with your sister. She told me you were here.

1204
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:12,348
请开开门，安娜
Please open the door, Anna.

1205
01:22:23,664 --> 01:22:25,359
你怎么看？
What are you thinking?

1206
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:31,469
不知道，我望风，你去搜他的车，找点儿线索
I don't know. I'll watch the door. You check his car. Let's get some details.

1207
01:22:34,308 --> 01:22:37,573
他没有详细说是怎么回事
He didn't want to say exactly what it was.

1208
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:43,281
就说我来了之后，他会来接我…
Just that when I got here, he would pick me up...

1209
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:45,817
…然后给我看些东西，我会见到…
...and show me, and I would see...

1210
01:22:46,788 --> 01:22:49,655
…能使整件案子翻盘的东西
...that it was something that would win the whole case.

1211
01:22:52,862 --> 01:22:54,727
即使在今天早上…
Even this morning...

1212
01:22:54,897 --> 01:22:56,489
…我是说，我想：
...I mean, I thought:

1213
01:22:58,034 --> 01:23:02,698
“好吧，如果我到了机场没有票的话我就明白了
"Okay, if I get to the airport and the ticket's not there, then I'll know.

1214
01:23:02,872 --> 01:23:07,969
好了，你很蠢，你可以回家了”
Okay, you're stupid, and you can go home now."

1215
01:23:10,581 --> 01:23:15,416
但确实有票，他付过钱了，好像是800块…
But it was there and he paid, like, 800 dollars...

1216
01:23:15,586 --> 01:23:18,248
…一张头等舱
...for a first-class ticket.

1217
01:23:18,422 --> 01:23:19,889
我只是…
And I just...

1218
01:23:23,828 --> 01:23:25,762
我上了飞机
I got on the plane.

1219
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:30,467
我相信他了
I believed him.

1220
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:39,904
你有没有觉得他可能在某种程度上来说 感到失望了？
You think maybe he was in some way disappointed?

1221
01:23:40,746 --> 01:23:44,739
这么说吧，他知道你告诉了其他人这一切…
Let's say that he knew that you told somebody else about all of this...

1222
01:23:44,917 --> 01:23:48,353
…然后，我也说不大大好，在某些程度上 他对你那样做感到失望？
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way, he was disappointed by that?

1223
01:23:49,455 --> 01:23:52,356
- 但我没那么做 - 你一定是跟别人说了
- But I didn't. - You must have told somebody else.

1224
01:23:52,524 --> 01:23:54,082
没有
No.

1225
01:23:55,262 --> 01:23:57,423
他让我发誓了
He made me promise.

1226
01:23:58,932 --> 01:24:03,301
你没跟别人讲这件事？一个都没有？
You didn't tell anybody else about this? Not one other person?

1227
01:24:04,437 --> 01:24:05,836
没有
No.

1228
01:24:10,611 --> 01:24:13,546
他其实是真疯了，不是么？
He really was crazy, wasn't he?

1229
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:29,162
- 你是说这个么？ - 让我看看
- You talking about this? - Let me see.

1230
01:24:30,666 --> 01:24:32,327
- 你知道这是什么吗？ - 知道
- You know what that is? - Yeah.

1231
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:36,328
你就说帮个“小忙”，这可比“小忙”大多了
You said a favor. That's more than a favor.

1232
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:38,666
好了，没人知道这是从哪儿来的
Well, nobody's gonna know where it came from.

1233
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:42,476
- 是你那事耽搁了么？ - 你什么意思？
- Are you that jammed up? - What are you talking about?

1234
01:24:42,645 --> 01:24:45,273
谁需要这玩意儿？是餐馆的事，是吧？
Who asked for this? It's the restaurant, right?

1235
01:24:45,448 --> 01:24:47,939
是你的某个债主么？“给我搞个封条”
One of these guys you owe? "Get me a seal."

1236
01:24:48,117 --> 01:24:49,744
你真的想知道么？
You really wanna know?

1237
01:26:07,068 --> 01:26:09,298
这事越来越有意思了
This just gets better and better.

1238
01:26:10,938 --> 01:26:12,530
我们干点儿什么呢？
What are we doing?

1239
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:00,200
“最佳打印”委托印刷清单

1240
01:28:14,203 --> 01:28:15,227
别动！
Freeze!

1241
01:28:15,404 --> 01:28:18,134
呆着别动，你个混蛋！别动！
Right there, asshole! Don't move!

1242
01:28:18,307 --> 01:28:20,571
- 好吧，我没恶意，我是个朋友！ - 举起手来！
- It's all right, I'm a friend! - Get your hands up!

1243
01:28:20,743 --> 01:28:23,268
快把手举起来！快点儿！
Get your hands up now! Now!

1244
01:28:23,446 --> 01:28:25,380
- 你手里是什么？ - 是本书
- What's in your hand? - It's a book.

1245
01:28:25,549 --> 01:28:28,416
放下！快放下！快点儿！
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1246
01:28:28,585 --> 01:28:31,884
- 转过来，慢点儿 - 好的，好的，转了
- Turn around. Slowly. - All right. All right. Okay.

1247
01:28:32,055 --> 01:28:33,886
- 这儿还有谁？ - 没别人了
- Who else is here? - Nobody.

1248
01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:36,491
- 我在问你，这儿还有谁？ - 没有别人了！
- I said, who else is here? - Nobody's here!

1249
01:28:36,660 --> 01:28:38,059
查一下那边
Check in there.

1250
01:28:38,863 --> 01:28:42,162
你要是敢动，就打爆你的头
You move, I'll take your head off.

1251
01:29:12,031 --> 01:29:16,468
现在我欠这家伙和我部门里他那混蛋老婆的情
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife... Who's a complete piece of shit in my unit.

1252
01:29:16,636 --> 01:29:18,729
- 现在我把命都押上了 - 很抱歉
- Now I owe them both my balls. - I'm sorry.

1253
01:29:18,905 --> 01:29:20,896
- 你了解我的 - 不是说“没人会知道的”么
- You know I am. - "Nobody will know it's me."

1254
01:29:21,074 --> 01:29:24,134
他们要是发现了怎么办，发现是我 给的你那该死的…
You know what happens they don't bury this, that I gave you this?

1255
01:29:24,311 --> 01:29:25,676
很糟糕，我知道了
It's bad. I know it.

1256
01:29:25,846 --> 01:29:28,906
我还有18个月就工作满20你年了 你的举动让我的退休金岌岌可危
I'm 18 months away from my 20. You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1257
01:29:29,083 --> 01:29:31,051
- 你终于说到“重点”了 - 那不是什么重点！
- You made your point. - It's not a point!

1258
01:29:31,218 --> 01:29:33,584
- 谁报的警？ - 什么？
- Who called 911? - What?

1259
01:29:33,887 --> 01:29:36,822
大楼空无一人，我是轻手轻脚的 我都没呆多长时间
The building was empty. I was quiet. I wasn't there very long.

1260
01:29:36,991 --> 01:29:39,425
谁叫警察来的？这些你有没有想过这事…？
Who called it in? Does that make sense to you...?

1261
01:29:39,593 --> 01:29:41,151
这事结了
This never happened.

1262
01:29:42,464 --> 01:29:44,489
你让警察觉得你是个律师
You got these cops thinking you're a lawyer.

1263
01:29:44,666 --> 01:29:46,725
你让律师觉得你是个警察
You got these lawyers thinking you're a cop.

1264
01:29:46,901 --> 01:29:51,031
你把大伙都骗了，不是么？除你之外所有人
You got everybody fooled, don't you? Everybody but you.

1265
01:29:51,206 --> 01:29:53,299
你很清楚自己是个什么东西
You know exactly what you are.

1266
01:30:06,922 --> 01:30:08,446
我们给你打过6次电话
We tried calling you six times.

1267
01:30:08,624 --> 01:30:10,751
但你的答录机一定是坏了还是怎么的
But your machine must be busted or something.

1268
01:30:12,596 --> 01:30:14,086
这是我们最好的技术
We gave it our best shot.

1269
01:30:15,432 --> 01:30:17,923
我们的红色封面用完了，库存只有2000…
We ran out of red covers. We only had 2000 in stock...

1270
01:30:18,101 --> 01:30:19,966
…因此剩下的1000我们用了蓝色的
...so we did the other thousand in blue.

1271
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:28,209
（内部使用） 北地联合克林泰特除草剂内部研究备忘录229号

1272
01:30:41,392 --> 01:30:42,882
没什么问题吧？
Is everything all right?

1273
01:30:43,062 --> 01:30:44,290
啊，没问题
It's fine, yeah.

1274
01:30:44,997 --> 01:30:48,057
嗯，你开车了么？因为后面还有25箱…
You have a van or something? Because I have 25 boxes back there...

1275
01:30:48,233 --> 01:30:51,293
帮我个忙，看好它们
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1276
01:30:51,470 --> 01:30:53,700
我下周回来把这些都拉走
I'll come back and pick everything up next week.

1277
01:30:53,872 --> 01:30:55,931
- 真的么？谢了，伙计 - 好的
- Seriously? Thanks, man. - Yeah.

1278
01:31:16,497 --> 01:31:17,862
喂
Hello.

1279
01:31:22,937 --> 01:31:26,236
丹，你们先走，我随后就到
Don. You go ahead. I'll catch up to you.

1280
01:31:26,807 --> 01:31:28,104
什么？
What?

1281
01:31:35,517 --> 01:31:37,678
你认识麦克・克莱顿么？
Do you know Michael Clayton?

1282
01:31:37,853 --> 01:31:39,343
认识，怎么了？
Yeah, why?

1283
01:31:39,521 --> 01:31:41,284
我们遇到了新情况
We have a situation.

1284
01:32:01,077 --> 01:32:02,635
嘿，他们找到你了吗？
Hey, did they find you?

1285
01:32:02,813 --> 01:32:05,839
- 谁找我？ - 马蒂，我想他们还在
- Who? - Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1286
01:32:14,024 --> 01:32:15,355
马蒂
Marty.

1287
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:18,889
你电话关机了，好多事都找不着你
Your phone's off. There's too much going on for your phone to be off.

1288
01:32:19,063 --> 01:32:21,054
- 我要单独聊聊 - 你看，那个，我们要晚了…
- I need a minute. - Yeah, well, we're late...

1289
01:32:21,232 --> 01:32:22,859
我们昨天晚上还没做完呢
We never got to finish last night.

1290
01:32:23,034 --> 01:32:25,161
你是最后走的吗？看起来气色很差
Did you close the place? You look like hell.

1291
01:32:25,336 --> 01:32:28,396
- 不是，你走之后我就走了 - 如果是那样的话
- No, I left right after you left. - Lf you say so.

1292
01:32:28,573 --> 01:32:31,269
我们忙了一晚上，我们必须发表一项声明
We've been here all night. We had to make an announcement.

1293
01:32:31,442 --> 01:32:34,707
简！我需要那个，给我个信封
Jean! I need the thing, the envelope.

1294
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:38,077
我本想让你加入进来，但找不到你 我只好做了决定
I wanted your input. I couldn't get you. I had to pull the trigger.

1295
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:41,185
我让鲍勃・奈斯特和金，可能是用错了
I put Bob Nast and Kim, probably a mistake.

1296
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:44,686
他们打算这周末举办一个追悼仪式
They're gonna pull together a memorial service by the end of the week.

1297
01:32:44,857 --> 01:32:47,121
我跟他们说了需要帮忙就找你
I told them to call you if they need any help.

1298
01:32:47,626 --> 01:32:50,390
不、不，不是，另一个，另一个
No, no, no. The other one. The other one.

1299
01:32:50,964 --> 01:32:53,262
我们今早给你开了张支票
So we cut you a check this morning.

1300
01:32:53,433 --> 01:32:56,732
但有些附加条件，巴里…
There's some strings attached. And Barry...

1301
01:32:56,903 --> 01:33:01,033
这事没商量，巴里必须参与进来
There's no way around this, Barry's gonna have to be involved.

1302
01:33:04,812 --> 01:33:07,246
如果亚瑟是在追查某件事情呢？
What if Arthur was on to something?

1303
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:09,076
你什么意思？追查什么？
What do you mean? On to what?

1304
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,117
U/North，如果他没疯？如果他是对的呢？
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy? What if he was right?

1305
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:14,447
什么对了？我们站错了队？
Right about what? That we're on the wrong side?

1306
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:17,056
站错了队，走错了路，一切，一切都不对
Wrong side, wrong way, everything, all of it.

1307
01:33:17,225 --> 01:33:20,160
这事新鲜么？这案子从第一天起就臭不可闻
This is news? This case reeked from day one.

1308
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:22,320
你都呆了15年了，还要我告诉你我们是 怎么赚钱的吗？
I gotta tell you how we pay the rent?

1309
01:33:22,497 --> 01:33:25,227
他们会怎么做？如果他把事实公之于众呢？
What would they do? What would they do if he went public?

1310
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,801
他们会怎么做？你他妈的傻了吧？ 他们已经这么做了
What would they do? Are you fucking soft? They're doing it.

1311
01:33:28,971 --> 01:33:31,405
如果我们不能在24小时内彻底解决这事…
We don't straighten the settlement out in 24 hours...

1312
01:33:31,573 --> 01:33:33,632
…他们就会拒绝支付900万的律师费
...they're gonna withhold $9 million in fees.

1313
01:33:33,809 --> 01:33:36,778
然后他们还会公布亚瑟在密尔沃基 跳脱衣舞的录像
Then they'll pull out the video of Arthur doing his flashdance.

1314
01:33:36,946 --> 01:33:38,675
他们会起诉我们玩忽职守
They'll sue us for legal malpractice.

1315
01:33:38,848 --> 01:33:42,511
除了这些之外，与伦敦的合并案也会告吹…
Except there won't be anything to win because the London merger will be dead...

1316
01:33:42,685 --> 01:33:45,347
…大伙就只能回家喝西北风去了
...and we'll be selling off the goddamn furniture.

1317
01:33:45,822 --> 01:33:47,517
这是8万块
That's 80.

1318
01:33:48,024 --> 01:33:49,821
我们管它就叫奖金
We're calling it a bonus.

1319
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,685
你以现在的年薪续约3年
Three-year contract at your current numbers.

1320
01:33:52,863 --> 01:33:54,490
那奖金是将给那个的
That's assuming this all works out.

1321
01:33:54,665 --> 01:33:55,825
你现在就办了？
You're doing this now?

1322
01:33:57,501 --> 01:34:00,834
我说，我同意这么办，好吧？但有条件的
Look, I agreed to this, okay? But there's rules now.

1323
01:34:01,005 --> 01:34:03,872
你想要合同，就得签订一份保密协议
You want the contract, you sign a confidentiality agreement.

1324
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:06,134
协议内容不能更改，同时具有追溯效力
It's gonna be bulletproof and retroactive.

1325
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:08,039
因为马蒂这人很友善，不愿意说…
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1326
01:34:08,213 --> 01:34:12,013
…但就你对这地方的了解，客户和 在这儿工作的员工…
...but with all you know about this place, the clients and people who work here...

1327
01:34:12,183 --> 01:34:14,743
…都会对你要价8万块感到有点儿奇怪
...it makes it a little weird when you ask for 80 grand.

1328
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,116
我要是勒索别人，第一个先找你…
If I was gonna shake anybody down, I'd come to you...

1329
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:20,952
…而且肯定不会只要8万块 这是你的意思还是他的？
...and it wouldn't be for 80 grand. Is this him or you?

1330
01:34:21,126 --> 01:34:23,720
- 如果我错了，我道歉 - 你他妈的完全错了
- Lf I'm wrong, I apologize. - You're way the fuck wrong.

1331
01:34:23,896 --> 01:34:25,124
随你便好了
So there you go.

1332
01:34:25,298 --> 01:34:26,959
够了，你俩，行了吧？
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1333
01:34:27,833 --> 01:34:29,994
他是个混蛋，但他清楚地知道这一点
He's an asshole, but he knows it.

1334
01:34:30,403 --> 01:34:33,668
你呢，是公认的（混蛋），好了吧？ 大家都高兴了？
And you're on the record. Okay? Everybody happy?

1335
01:34:34,307 --> 01:34:37,003
- 丹・杰弗瑞来了 - 我们就到
- Don Jeffries is here. - We're on the way.

1336
01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:41,906
和鲍勃・奈斯特联系一下，看看 他们需要帮忙不
Call Bob Nast. Just see if they need help with this thing.

1337
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:46,850
欢迎回来
You're welcome.

1338
01:35:39,743 --> 01:35:42,109
你说是1万2，这可是7万5啊
You said 12. This is 75.

1339
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:44,440
嗯，别激动，你要来一杯吗？
Well, don't get too excited. You want a drink?

1340
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:46,480
不，我上班呢
No. I'm working.

1341
01:35:48,919 --> 01:35:52,446
现在我们扯平了，那么，不用干别的了
So we're square, then. No bad blood.

1342
01:35:52,623 --> 01:35:54,318
你只是在尽自己的职责罢了
You're just doing your job.

1343
01:35:54,492 --> 01:35:55,959
是啊
That's right.

1344
01:35:56,894 --> 01:35:58,623
保重，盖比
Take it easy, Gabe.

1345
01:35:59,631 --> 01:36:00,996
你也一样
Michael.

1346
01:36:12,744 --> 01:36:14,177
不跟
Check.

1347
01:36:16,015 --> 01:36:17,277
不跟
Check.

1348
01:36:17,617 --> 01:36:20,347
- 不跟 - 半注，两百
- Check. - Half the pot. Two hundred.

1349
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,817
两百胜
Two hundred to go.

1350
01:36:59,194 --> 01:37:00,957
那么，餐馆现在怎么样了
So, what happened with the bar?

1351
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,155
看来你经营的不善啊，哈？
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1352
01:37:25,655 --> 01:37:28,419
你干什么？你才刚来
What are you doing? You just got here.

1353
01:37:28,592 --> 01:37:30,526
这哥们儿才玩了9手，这就走了
Guy plays nine hands, walks away.

1354
01:37:30,694 --> 01:37:34,858
我把你吓跑了？我干了什么？ 是我把你吓跑了吗？
I scare you away? What did I do? Did I scare you away?

1355
01:38:10,637 --> 01:38:11,695
快走
Get out.

1356
01:38:13,072 --> 01:38:15,199
快离开车子
Get out of the car now.

1357
01:38:16,943 --> 01:38:17,932
- 沃尔特？ - 麦克
- Walter? - Michael.

1358
01:38:18,111 --> 01:38:20,306
- 麦克，谢天谢地，总算找到你 - 嗯
- Michael. Thank God you're there. - Yeah.

1359
01:38:24,718 --> 01:38:26,652
你还有8秒…
You have eight...

1360
01:38:27,555 --> 01:38:30,285
…6、5…
...six, five...

1361
01:38:30,457 --> 01:38:32,789
…4、3…
...four, three...

1362
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:34,587
快走
Get out of the car.

1363
01:38:38,033 --> 01:38:41,059
- 告诉他不要接任何电话了 - 好的，你会去吧？
- Tell him to stay off the phone. - All right. But you're on it?

1364
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,103
我没被发现吧？
Am I clean?

1365
01:38:43,271 --> 01:38:44,499
接着走
Just keep walking.

1366
01:38:44,673 --> 01:38:46,903
收到，我没被发现吧？
You copy. Am I clean?

1367
01:38:47,108 --> 01:38:50,100
走就是了，他正朝他的车走去
Just keep moving. He's walking to the car.

1368
01:38:50,645 --> 01:38:54,206
你只要在路上就行了，我会给你带来更多的细节
- To let him know you're on the way. I'll get back to you with the details.

1369
01:38:54,383 --> 01:38:56,817
- 给我2分钟 - 我马上开车去
- Just give me two minutes. - I'll be in the car.

1370
01:39:00,523 --> 01:39:03,959
我没安完，是放上了，但不知道能不能用
I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.

1371
01:39:32,123 --> 01:39:35,684
不是很好，有点儿杂波，他就在前边，但是…
It's loose. I got a pulse. He's up there somewhere, but...

1372
01:39:37,462 --> 01:39:39,396
我来看看能不能增强下信号
Let's find a way to boost the signal.

1373
01:39:46,972 --> 01:39:50,169
- 我不知道沃尔特给了你什么承诺… - 一位天才员工！
- I don't know what Walter promised you... - A miracle worker!

1374
01:39:50,342 --> 01:39:53,573
沃尔特在电话里是这么说的，20分钟前 原话要听么，啊？
That's Walter on the phone, 20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1375
01:39:53,746 --> 01:39:55,577
“挺住，我会派一个天才来帮助你”
"I'm sending you a miracle worker."

1376
01:39:55,749 --> 01:39:57,410
- 喔，那他说错了 - 哪儿说错了？
- Well, he misspoke. - About what?

1377
01:39:57,584 --> 01:40:01,111
关于你是公司的救火员那部分？ 还是你根本就不在行?
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer? Or that you're any good at it?

1378
01:40:06,893 --> 01:40:08,827
我们走，有信号了
We're up. Just got a signal.

1379
01:40:32,688 --> 01:40:35,054
对面路上没有车过来，他在干什么？
There's nothing back this way. What's he doing?

1380
01:40:35,223 --> 01:40:36,417
也许他迷路了
Maybe he's lost.

1381
01:40:36,591 --> 01:40:38,388
- 等一下 - 他来了
- Wait a minute. - That's him.

1382
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:42,959
他一个人，是吧？
He was alone, right?

1383
01:40:43,132 --> 01:40:45,930
- 是，我觉得是 - 确定点儿，是还是不是？
- Yeah, I think so. - Call it, yes or no?

1384
01:40:48,371 --> 01:40:49,998
我们得转回去
We gotta turn around.

1385
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:21,865
什么情况？
Talk to me.

1386
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:23,598
有点儿乱
It's strobing.

1387
01:41:23,775 --> 01:41:26,175
不，走得对，我想我们走得对，接着开
No, we're good. I think we're good. Just keep going.

1388
01:41:41,994 --> 01:41:43,586
不，他转弯了，不知道为什么他转弯了
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1389
01:41:43,763 --> 01:41:45,128
- 哪儿？ - 他在…
- Where? - He took...

1390
01:41:45,632 --> 01:41:47,600
- 他转左了 - 哪儿有左啊
- He took a left. - I don't have a left.

1391
01:41:57,577 --> 01:42:00,512
- 东面，他在东南面 - 什么，我们跟丢了？
- East. He's southeast. - What, so we missed it?

1392
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:02,808
- 可能是图像有问题 - 别着急
- Or the grid is wrong. - Hang on.

1393
01:42:12,994 --> 01:42:15,690
- 我们得回到第一下 - 第一下什么？哪算第一下？
- We gotta go back to one. - One is what? Where's our one?

1394
01:42:15,898 --> 01:42:18,890
直走半英里，一直开，开就是了
Half a mile straight ahead. Just keep driving. Just go.

1395
01:42:25,774 --> 01:42:28,402
现实我们接近了，但那是西面，不是东边
It says we're closing. But that's west. It can't be west.

1396
01:42:28,577 --> 01:42:29,635
信号还是图像的为问题？
The signal or the grid?

1397
01:42:29,812 --> 01:42:32,542
- 可能都有，减弱了 - 该死的
- It's both. It just keeps dropping out. - Goddamn it.

1398
01:43:23,769 --> 01:43:25,236
把电话给我
Give me the cell.

1399
01:43:27,773 --> 01:43:29,468
我们的信号很好
Our signal's good.

1400
01:45:07,379 --> 01:45:08,641
怎么了？
What?

1401
01:45:11,284 --> 01:45:12,979
谢了，米奇
Thanks, Mickey.

1402
01:45:13,152 --> 01:45:14,813
带我离开这儿
Just get me out of here.

1403
01:45:22,528 --> 01:45:26,259
我要这个的会议时间安排表，越快越好 最晚周四
I wanna get a meeting scheduled on this, soon as we can. Thursday at the latest.

1404
01:45:26,433 --> 01:45:30,062
我觉得我们得找个来自裁决组的人 麦克戴尔可以…
I think we should have someone from the equity group there. Maybe McDonnell...

1405
01:45:30,237 --> 01:45:31,727
- 嗯？ - 你听说了么？
- Yeah? - Did you hear?

1406
01:45:31,905 --> 01:45:34,430
- 是啊，听说了，U/North结案了 - 不是，是麦克・克莱顿的事
- Yeah, yeah. They closed U/North. - No. Michael Clayton.

1407
01:45:34,875 --> 01:45:35,933
什么？
What?

1408
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:39,011
汽车炸弹，远郊，今天早晨，他被杀了
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning. He was killed.

1409
01:45:40,047 --> 01:45:41,071
什么？
What?

1410
01:45:42,751 --> 01:45:44,582
天啊
Holy shit.

1411
01:45:58,768 --> 01:46:03,705
U/North公司依然坚持认为这场诉讼是…
It has been and it remains the U/North position...

1412
01:46:03,873 --> 01:46:07,969
证据不足而且毫无道理可言的
...that this lawsuit is baseless and without merit.

1413
01:46:08,144 --> 01:46:12,205
基于原告方要求支付超过30亿美元的赔偿金…
Our reluctance to negotiate was anchored by this belief...

1414
01:46:12,382 --> 01:46:17,547
…我们的态度和以前一样，甚至更坚决…
...and reinforced by the plaintiffs' demand for settlement...

1415
01:46:17,721 --> 01:46:20,281
…不愿谈判
...in excess of 3 billion dollars.

1416
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:23,915
但今天我们聚集在这里…
The reason that we are all here today is...

1417
01:46:24,094 --> 01:46:27,962
…是因为本案的一些关键因素已经发生了变化
...that several key elements in the case have changed.

1418
01:46:28,966 --> 01:46:33,403
你们手中都有一份计划中的一揽子解决方案…
You all have a tentative proposal packet...

1419
01:46:34,005 --> 01:46:37,964
…上面标出了细节，关键之处在于这点：
...which outlines the details, but the bottom line is this:

1420
01:46:38,142 --> 01:46:40,906
在过去的几个月里，有消息指出…
Over the past several months we had gotten word...

1421
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:44,412
…原告的耐心开始不足…
...that the plaintiffs were growing impatient...

1422
01:46:44,583 --> 01:46:48,417
…他们正在修改要求赔偿金的数目
...and were in the process of revising their settlement numbers.

1423
01:46:48,921 --> 01:46:50,388
我们也了解到…
We also learned...

1424
01:46:50,556 --> 01:46:54,492
…原告的律师费上限为32%…
...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees were capped at 32 percent...

1425
01:46:54,660 --> 01:46:56,753
…最高4亿美元…
...up to 400 million dollars...

1426
01:46:57,196 --> 01:47:01,428
…超过的部分，律师费将降为24%
...above which, their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1427
01:47:01,601 --> 01:47:06,163
因此我们知道这种两难的境地让他们…
So we knew that there would be this motivational dead zone for them...

1428
01:47:06,339 --> 01:47:07,670
…止步不前
...in the middle there.

1429
01:47:08,441 --> 01:47:10,136
最后…
Finally...

1430
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:14,644
…我们的财务部门告知我们他们计算出了
...our finance team informed us that they had run the numbers...

1431
01:47:14,815 --> 01:47:16,646
…赔偿金及税款的总额…
...and that the tax benefit...

1432
01:47:16,817 --> 01:47:20,048
…如果我们能将赔偿金控制在6亿美元以下…
...provided that we bring the settlement in under 600 million...

1433
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:22,655
…在这一财政年度内…
...and within this fiscal year...

1434
01:47:22,823 --> 01:47:28,693
…公司业绩就可以弥补赔偿金带来的损失
...that the write-off on this settlement would essentially pay for itself.

1435
01:47:29,196 --> 01:47:33,394
你们面前的一揽子解决方案，就我看来…
The package that you have before you represents, in my judgment...

1436
01:47:33,835 --> 01:47:38,636
…是公司在目前情况下的最好选择
...the strongest possible position for our company under the circumstances.

1437
01:47:38,807 --> 01:47:40,502
同时，作为首席顾问…
And, as chief counsel...

1438
01:47:40,675 --> 01:47:43,940
…我建议你们通过这一方案
...it is my recommendation that this proposal be confirmed.

1439
01:47:45,013 --> 01:47:48,540
谢谢你，凯伦，我们需要几分钟时间来 讨论一下这个问题
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us a few minutes to talk about it.

1440
01:47:48,718 --> 01:47:50,982
好的，我在外面等
Certainly. I'll be right outside.

1441
01:47:53,389 --> 01:47:54,378
嗯…
Well...

1442
01:48:17,514 --> 01:48:19,345
里面情况怎么样？
How'd it go in there?

1443
01:48:22,387 --> 01:48:24,582
吓坏了吧，哈？
Pretty freaky, huh?

1444
01:48:24,756 --> 01:48:27,725
你看见亚瑟了么？他就在附近出没
Did you see Arthur? He's wandering around here somewhere.

1445
01:48:30,261 --> 01:48:33,526
我开玩笑呢，放松点儿
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1446
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:38,797
你收到这个了吗？这备忘录写的不错 虽然年头久了点儿，但内容很好
You got one of these? It's a great memo. It's an oldie but a goodie.

1447
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:43,441
我让你心跳加速了，是不是？
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1448
01:48:43,609 --> 01:48:45,736
我不知道你这样做是想干什么
I don't know what it is you think you're doing.

1449
01:48:45,911 --> 01:48:47,276
你觉得我这样做是想干什么？
What do you think I'm doing?

1450
01:48:47,446 --> 01:48:49,243
案子结了，我们和解了
The suit's over. We have a deal.

1451
01:48:49,416 --> 01:48:52,112
不管那是什么，现在都没用了
Whatever that is, it's meaningless at this point.

1452
01:48:52,285 --> 01:48:55,948
你这么认为？这样啊，我还以为你只是 提出一个建议方案呢
You think? I must have gotten it wrong. I thought you had a tentative proposal.

1453
01:48:56,122 --> 01:48:58,317
我还没想到这些钱都是你给的呢
I didn't realize you'd signed all those checks.

1454
01:48:58,491 --> 01:49:01,790
这是个累赘，我有上千本，我拿它们怎么办？
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these. What am I gonna do with them?

1455
01:49:01,962 --> 01:49:03,293
我要给马蒂打电话
I'm calling Marty.

1456
01:49:03,463 --> 01:49:05,829
好，好啊，打吧，那会是个很好的开始
Good. Good. Do it. That's a great place to start.

1457
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,798
让我们看看是谁告诉他亚瑟和安娜・凯泽森联系
Let's find out who told him Arthur was calling Anna Kysersun.

1458
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:10,801
让我们看看是谁窃听的电话
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1459
01:49:10,972 --> 01:49:14,772
这本备忘录，我对其真实性有异议 我强烈怀疑…
This memorandum, even if it's authentic, which I doubt, I highly doubt...

1460
01:49:14,942 --> 01:49:18,378
- 我知道你对亚瑟做了些什么 - 这是受保护的文件，它属于U/North公司
- I know what you did to Arthur. - It's protected. It belongs to U/North.

1461
01:49:18,546 --> 01:49:21,310
- 我知道是你杀了他 - 这是律师和客户之间的隐私
- I know you killed him. - It's attorney-client privilege.

1462
01:49:21,483 --> 01:49:25,146
凯伦，你看，现在，事情不该是这样的
See, now, that's just not the way to go here, Karen.

1463
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:28,016
对于一个这么聪明的人来说，你有点儿 不知所措了，是不是？
For such a smart person, you really are lost, aren't you?

1464
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:29,521
谈话结束
This conversation is over.

1465
01:49:29,691 --> 01:49:33,127
我不是你该除掉的人，我是你该收买的人
I'm not the guy that you kill. I'm the guy that you buy.

1466
01:49:33,295 --> 01:49:35,820
你他妈的瞎到连我是什么人都没看出来？
Are you so fucking blind you don't even see what I am?

1467
01:49:35,998 --> 01:49:39,490
我是你整个儿环节上最容易的一环 你还想做了我？
I'm the easiest part of your whole goddamn problem and you're gonna kill me?

1468
01:49:39,802 --> 01:49:42,930
你不知道我谁么？我是救火队员，我是跑腿的
Don't you know who I am? I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1469
01:49:43,106 --> 01:49:46,507
我经手的人从顺手牵羊的主妇到 贪赃枉法的国会议员…
I do everything from shoplifting housewives to bent congressmen...

1470
01:49:46,676 --> 01:49:48,576
…你还想做了我？
...and you're gonna kill me?

1471
01:49:49,512 --> 01:49:52,345
你想要什么，凯伦？告诉我
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1472
01:49:52,516 --> 01:49:56,213
你想要枪支携带证明？还是想要关于 内线交易传票的警告
You want a carry permit? You want a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1473
01:49:56,387 --> 01:50:00,221
我8万块和一纸合同就把亚瑟卖了 你还想做了我？
I sold out Arthur for 80 grand and a contract and you're gonna kill me?

1474
01:50:01,725 --> 01:50:03,158
你想要什么？
What do you want?

1475
01:50:03,327 --> 01:50:04,851
我想要什么？
What do I want?

1476
01:50:05,029 --> 01:50:06,621
我要更多
I want more.

1477
01:50:07,131 --> 01:50:08,894
我要不干了
I want out.

1478
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:11,695
有这个，我什么都要
And with this, I want everything.

1479
01:50:13,471 --> 01:50:14,699
开个价吧？
Is there a number?

1480
01:50:14,873 --> 01:50:16,465
我的要价是10
Ten is a number.

1481
01:50:16,641 --> 01:50:18,666
10？10什么？
Ten? Ten what?

1482
01:50:20,712 --> 01:50:22,202
1000万？
Ten million?

1483
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:25,816
你觉得我上哪儿搞那1000万去？
Where do you think I'm gonna get 10 million dollars?

1484
01:50:26,385 --> 01:50:28,285
你知道这东西哪点好么？
You know what's great about this?

1485
01:50:28,454 --> 01:50:30,752
你看到结尾了吗？你看到谁签署的了吗？
Did you read it to the end? You see who signed it?

1486
01:50:31,324 --> 01:50:33,224
咱们一起进去问问丹・杰弗瑞…
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1487
01:50:33,392 --> 01:50:36,384
…看看他觉得这个价怎么样
...if he wants to pass the hat for a worthy cause.

1488
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:40,630
还有很多需要商量的内容…
This would have to be a longer conversation...

1489
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:42,928
…我们在别处继续谈
...and would have to take place somewhere else.

1490
01:50:43,103 --> 01:50:44,593
哪儿？我车里？
Where? My car?

1491
01:50:46,173 --> 01:50:47,197
好吧
All right.

1492
01:50:48,375 --> 01:50:51,401
简单点儿，5就行了
I'm gonna make it easy. Let's make it 5.

1493
01:50:51,578 --> 01:50:53,375
5百万我就能忘了亚瑟
Five and I'll forget about Arthur.

1494
01:50:55,750 --> 01:51:00,517
5百万容易些，好，5百万可以商量
Five is easier. Yeah, 5 is something that we could talk about.

1495
01:51:00,688 --> 01:51:04,419
好，还有5百万是为了忘记那468个…
Good. And then the other 5 is to forget about the 468 people...

1496
01:51:04,592 --> 01:51:06,685
…被你的除草剂害了的受害者
...that you knocked off with your weed killer.

1497
01:51:06,861 --> 01:51:09,227
就到这儿吧，我会和丹谈谈…
Let me finish up this meeting. I'll talk to Don...

1498
01:51:09,397 --> 01:51:11,991
我看起来是来谈判的吗？！
Do I look like I'm negotiating?!

1499
01:51:12,167 --> 01:51:13,498
凯伦？
Karen?

1500
01:51:14,203 --> 01:51:16,068
- 等一下 - 一切都好么？
- One second. - Everything okay?

1501
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:18,428
好吧
Yes.

1502
01:51:19,441 --> 01:51:23,241
1000万美元，我选银行，离岸帐户，立即支付
Ten million dollars. Bank of my choosing. Offshore. Immediately.

1503
01:51:23,412 --> 01:51:24,538
- 好的 - 说一遍！
- Yes. - Say it!

1504
01:51:24,713 --> 01:51:28,581
1000万美元，你选帐户，马上就给
Ten million dollars, your account, the moment this meeting is through.

1505
01:51:28,752 --> 01:51:31,050
- 凯伦！大家都等着呢 - 我就来，丹
