1
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:35,902
<i>Michael.</i>

2
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,006
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.</i>
<i>Who else could they send?</i>

3
00:00:39,174 --> 00:00:40,505
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

4
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:43,406
<i>And I know it's a long way</i>
<i>and you're ready to go to work.</i>

5
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:46,878
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just--</i>
<i>Just please hear me out.</i>

6
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,246
<i>Because this is not an episode,</i>
<i>relapse, fuckup.</i>

7
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:52,979
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

8
00:00:53,155 --> 00:00:55,988
<i>Try and make believe</i>
<i>this is not just madness...</i>

9
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:59,184
<i>...because this is not just madness.</i>

10
00:00:59,528 --> 00:01:01,792
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>I came out of the building, okay?</i>

11
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:04,489
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,</i>
<i>there's a car waiting...</i>

12
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:07,863
<i>...I got exactly 38 minutes to get</i>
<i>to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

13
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,800
<i>There's this panicked associate</i>
<i>sprinting along beside me...</i>

14
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:13,498
<i>...scribbling in a notepad,</i>
<i>and she starts screaming.</i>

15
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:16,610
<i>And I realize we're standing</i>
<i>in the middle of the street...</i>

16
00:01:16,778 --> 00:01:20,771
<i>...the light's changed and there's this wall</i>
<i>of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

17
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:22,974
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

18
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:25,779
<i>I'm suddenly consumed</i>
<i>with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

19
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:27,979
<i>...that I'm covered</i>
<i>with some sort of film.</i>

20
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:32,752
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.</i>
<i>And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

21
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,692
<i>And at first I thought,</i>
<i>''Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

22
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:38,298
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,</i>
<i>embryonic fluid.</i>

23
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,162
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

24
00:01:40,335 --> 00:01:42,997
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.</i>
<i>I've been reborn. ''</i>

25
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:46,470
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,</i>
<i>the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

26
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:50,669
<i>...this poor woman screaming,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking, ''No. This is not rebirth.</i>

27
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,713
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion</i>
<i>of renewal...</i>

28
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:56,646
<i>...that happens in</i>
<i>the final moment before death. ''</i>

29
00:01:56,818 --> 00:02:00,413
<i>And then I realize,</i>
<i>''No, no, no, this is completely wrong''...</i>

30
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:03,558
<i>...because I looked back</i>
<i>at the building...</i>

31
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,353
<i>...and I had the most stunning</i>
<i>moment of clarity.</i>

32
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:08,621
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

33
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:12,824
<i>...that I had emerged, not through</i>
<i>the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

34
00:02:13,001 --> 00:02:16,300
<i>...not through the portals</i>
<i>of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

35
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:19,269
<i>...but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

36
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:24,071
<i>...whose sole function is</i>
<i>to excrete the poison...</i>

37
00:02:24,246 --> 00:02:27,613
<i>...the ammo, the defoliant necessary</i>
<i>for other larger...</i>

38
00:02:27,783 --> 00:02:31,344
<i>...more powerful organisms</i>
<i>to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

39
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,388
<i>And that I had been coated</i>
<i>in this patina of shit...</i>

40
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:37,752
<i>...for the best part of my life.</i>

41
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:41,760
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it</i>
<i>would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

42
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,192
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

43
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:47,096
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath</i>
<i>and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

44
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,672
<i>I said to myself, ''As clear as this may be,</i>
<i>as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

45
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,038
<i>...as true a thing as I believe</i>
<i>that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

46
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,679
<i>It must stand the test of time. ''</i>

47
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,873
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

48
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:07,354
I'm not sure what eIse I can teII you
that I haven't aIready.

49
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,047
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.</i>
<i>They're your clients.</i>

50
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:14,457
<i>So you tell me why you're settling</i>
<i>a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

51
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,325
<i>Because I'm writing this story</i>
<i>whether you like it or not.</i>

52
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:18,830
What does that exactIy mean?

53
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,401
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

54
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,173
We found 97.

55
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:39,880
I've got that cunt from
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> on my ceII phone.

56
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,216
She wiII not go away.

57
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:47,184
Marty Bach. How can I heIp you?

58
00:03:47,362 --> 00:03:50,456
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.</i>
<i>We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

59
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:53,863
<i>...about a settlement in the U/North</i>
<i>defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

60
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:57,403
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

61
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:59,437
...pending and unresoIved.

62
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:02,202
TiII such time as our cIient
has their day in court...

63
00:04:02,377 --> 00:04:05,869
...or the pIaintiffs drop the suit,
I'II have nothing of vaIue to teII you.

64
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:09,108
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing</i>
<i>the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

65
00:04:09,284 --> 00:04:13,744
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with</i>
<i>600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

66
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:16,356
Here's what I know.
Your deadIine was 20 minutes ago.

67
00:04:16,525 --> 00:04:20,017
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

68
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:22,686
In either case,
I wish you the best of Iuck.

69
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:25,824
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

70
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,306
I'II see the turn.

71
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:23,848
Check.

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,622
Check.

73
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,360
Check.

74
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,521
HaIf the pot. Two hundred.

75
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,394
Two hundred to go.

76
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:44,774
You don't remember me, huh?

77
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,275
We pIayed together a coupIe times.

78
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,543
That Iamp pIace on Bowery.

79
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,381
That guy's showroom?
AII the Iamps and shit?

80
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:55,957
-The GaIaxy.
-That's it.

81
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:59,321
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

82
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:02,725
My oId partner bid that job,
the pIumbing.

83
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,298
-You don't remember me?
-I remember you.

84
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,732
Because I Iost a Iot of weight since then.

85
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:11,234
You bought some hair too.

86
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:13,704
With your money.

87
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:16,973
So, what happened with the bar?

88
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:18,908
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

89
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,244
Shit, man. I want to Iisten to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

90
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:25,886
That was a good Iocation.

91
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,887
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept teIIing me.

92
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,857
Action's on you.

93
00:06:31,493 --> 00:06:33,256
I bet the pot.

94
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,828
Good to see you again.

95
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:11,621
HeIIo?

96
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,062
<i>-Michael.</i>
-WaIter.

97
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:16,466
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.</i>
<i>Look, I got a situation.</i>

98
00:07:16,638 --> 00:07:20,734
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,</i>
<i>he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

99
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:22,809
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

100
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:23,967
Just now?

101
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:26,807
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 1 5 minutes ago.</i>
<i>He's driving home.</i>

102
00:07:26,982 --> 00:07:29,041
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

103
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:30,377
Where?

104
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:34,386
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.</i>
<i>He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

105
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:35,580
Is he drunk?

106
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:38,624
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.</i>
<i>He's good, he's sober.</i>

107
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:40,283
TeII him to stay off the phone.

108
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:42,726
<i>All right. But you're on it?</i>
<i>You can get up there?</i>

109
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,660
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

110
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,394
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

111
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,002
I'm waIking to the car now.

112
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,537
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back</i>
<i>and I'll get the address.</i>

113
00:07:52,707 --> 00:07:56,302
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

114
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:57,911
AII right. I'II be in the car.

115
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,264
<i>What they did, see,</i>
<i>they changed the grade there.</i>

116
00:08:54,436 --> 00:08:56,233
They widened the street.

117
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:59,305
I'm sure somebody toId them
that that was an improvement.

118
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:03,968
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angIe...

119
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:07,740
...and they've got these new--
These-- These--

120
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,009
These sodium Iamps, it's bIinding.

121
00:09:10,185 --> 00:09:13,450
-That corner there. It is bIinding.
-They'II have to work that out.

122
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:16,454
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

123
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:21,254
I mean, how many times have we taIked
about that corner? DeII?

124
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:23,693
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a Iot of time here.

125
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:28,802
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this hoIds any interest for you?

126
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,871
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminaI attorney...

127
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,632
...that can be here in 1 5 minutes.

128
00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:37,042
WeII, that sounds ominous.

129
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:39,772
We have some good reIationships
up here in Westchester.

130
00:09:39,948 --> 00:09:42,883
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a Iawyer?

131
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,848
-Not the kind you need.
-What kind is that?

132
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,008
A triaI Iawyer.

133
00:09:46,388 --> 00:09:49,050
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

134
00:09:49,224 --> 00:09:52,785
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
puII WaIter back in on this.

135
00:09:52,961 --> 00:09:55,953
I wanna get WaIter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

136
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:59,862
Because, I'II be frank with you,
I don't Iike the way this is going.

137
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:03,697
Sir, we don't have time for WaIter.
Your options are gonna get smaIIer quickIy.

138
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,931
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

139
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:07,335
I suggest you go IocaI...

140
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:10,376
...and I'm teIIing you there are
peopIe here I Iike for this.

141
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:12,604
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

142
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,806
Hey, you beIieve this?

143
00:10:14,983 --> 00:10:17,281
I have been a cIient at Kenner, Bach
for 1 2 years!

144
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:21,183
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a pIace at the back of the Iine?

145
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:24,655
Mr. Greer, you Ieft the scene of an accident
on a sIow weeknight...

146
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:27,021
...six miIes from
the state poIice barracks.

147
00:10:27,195 --> 00:10:29,425
If there's a Iine,
you're right up front.

148
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:32,464
I can get a Iawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

149
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:36,536
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referraI!

150
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,467
I don't know what WaIter
promised you--

151
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,098
A miracIe worker! That's WaIter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

152
00:10:42,277 --> 00:10:45,371
Direct quote, okay? ''Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracIe worker.''

153
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,174
-WeII, he misspoke.
-About what?

154
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,942
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

155
00:10:50,118 --> 00:10:51,585
EIIiot.

156
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:55,046
The guy was running! In the street!

157
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:59,956
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the Iamps, you add the angIe....

158
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:04,955
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middIe of the street at midnight?!

159
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:07,328
You answer me that!

160
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:23,048
What if someone had stoIen the car?

161
00:11:26,154 --> 00:11:27,382
Happens aII the time.

162
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,648
Cops Iike hit-and-runs.

163
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:31,849
They work them hard,
they cIear them fast.

164
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:35,223
Right now there's a B.C.I. unit
puIIing paint chips off a guard raiI.

165
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:38,729
Tomorrow, they're gonna be Iooking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

166
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,130
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-1 2.

167
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,894
And the guy you hit?

168
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:46,438
If he got a Iook at the pIates,
it won't even take that Iong.

169
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:51,373
There's no pIay here.

170
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,512
There's no angIe.
There's no champagne room.

171
00:11:54,682 --> 00:11:57,344
I'm not a miracIe worker, I'm a janitor.

172
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,577
The math on this is simpIe.

173
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:02,746
The smaIIer the mess,
the easier it is for me to cIean up.

174
00:12:03,892 --> 00:12:08,022
That's the poIice, isn't it?

175
00:12:08,196 --> 00:12:09,595
No.

176
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,092
They don't caII.

177
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:18,203
HeIIo.

178
00:12:19,274 --> 00:12:21,572
Jerry, it's MichaeI CIayton.

179
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:24,211
Yeah, Iook, I'm sorry to wake you up.

180
00:12:24,546 --> 00:12:27,276
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

181
00:12:28,216 --> 00:12:29,513
You got a pen?

182
00:16:12,006 --> 00:16:14,099
Mom, where's my cards?

183
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:20,978
Where's my cards?

184
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,527
Is my other deck in here?

185
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,096
Did you eat?

186
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:40,166
Dad's down there waiting aIready.

187
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,199
There were cards in our bathroom.

188
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,632
Yes, I had a waffIe.

189
00:16:43,805 --> 00:16:46,672
Since we're out of waffIes,
I don't see how that's possibIe.

190
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,172
It's a miracIe.

191
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:53,470
GIoves?

192
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:01,277
Henry!

193
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,459
Come on.

194
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,794
Get in.

195
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,398
Got it?

196
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:22,801
<i>So no one's even sure</i>
<i>exactly where they are...</i>

197
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:26,140
...because there's no borders
or Iandmarks or anything.

198
00:17:26,314 --> 00:17:29,044
And the town?
It's not even a town reaIIy.

199
00:17:29,217 --> 00:17:32,414
It just is this camp where aII these peopIe
have gathered to hide.

200
00:17:32,587 --> 00:17:33,576
Right.

201
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:37,212
AII these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

202
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,554
AII these peopIe that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay aIive.

203
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:42,628
This is where they aII came.

204
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:45,789
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

205
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,992
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

206
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:51,332
-There's, Iike, 1 5 different characters, okay?
-Okay.

207
00:17:51,806 --> 00:17:53,535
And nobody has any aIIiances.

208
00:17:53,708 --> 00:17:56,973
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

209
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:59,135
...maybe the person you're taIking to...

210
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,804
...maybe they're Iike your mortaI enemy
in the wars.

211
00:18:01,983 --> 00:18:04,679
So it's just compIeteIy Iike
everybody for themseIves.

212
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:06,183
Sounds famiIiar.

213
00:18:06,354 --> 00:18:09,289
It's reaIIy good.
I'm serious, you shouId reaIIy read it.

214
00:18:09,457 --> 00:18:12,620
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'II be on to something eIse.

215
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,557
-How much you wanna bet?
-I don't know. How much you got?

216
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:18,561
-You got your bus pass?
-It's in my Iocker.

217
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:21,600
You're not even gonna Iook at it,
are you?

218
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,202
-The book?
-Yes.

219
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,770
Bring it on Saturday, I'II....

220
00:18:24,939 --> 00:18:28,170
I did aIready. I Ieft it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

221
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,468
Okay.

222
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:32,044
WeII, here we go.

223
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,909
Go. Teach these peopIe something,
wouId you?

224
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,545
-See you Iater, Dad.
-Yeah, kiddo.

225
00:18:43,658 --> 00:18:45,091
Thanks.

226
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:54,892
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,</i>
<i>assorted sizes.</i>

227
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:58,038
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.</i>
<i>Thirty dollars I have.</i>

228
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,299
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty doIIars back there.

229
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,705
Sixty doIIars, get me to 70.
I got 70 doIIars.

230
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:06,403
Seventy doIIars, I have now, 70.
Eighty doIIars there.

231
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,980
Eighty doIIars, this gentIeman here.
Eighty doIIars.

232
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,880
Ninety doIIars there. Give me 1 00.
One hundred I have now.

233
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:25,795
He says you're stiII gonna be short.

234
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:29,693
How short?

235
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,271
Sixty. PIus the points, 75 thousand.

236
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:36,501
-That's Iiquor and everything?
-What'd you think it was gonna be?

237
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,669
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

238
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:43,715
He took 1 500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

239
00:19:43,884 --> 00:19:45,511
Make a bid.

240
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:49,745
Are you teIIing me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

241
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:51,983
Just Iying around, no.

242
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:56,586
We both know it's your brother
I shouId be taIking to.

243
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:57,788
Forget that.

244
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:02,265
MichaeI, Iook, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

245
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,667
But Timmy's name stays in the book
tiII we're cIear.

246
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,440
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

247
00:20:10,611 --> 00:20:14,308
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

248
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:16,279
He's gotta have something.

249
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,940
He's got the two kids with her.

250
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:21,782
He's got Jennifer, the coke-deaIing waitress
that he knocked up.

251
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:26,620
He's got four MicheIin radiaIs
that he stoIe from my sister's garage.

252
00:20:27,928 --> 00:20:29,691
Make an offer.

253
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:36,500
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautifuI girI, young girI.

254
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,232
But Iive Iike that? Even they do a program--
She did, I think, once, two years.

255
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:43,400
And then they sIip? Forget it.

256
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,943
It's Iike you're strapped to a bomb.

257
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:49,108
What's my timeframe here?

258
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,441
I don't know.

259
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:53,610
I didn't think it'd be a probIem.

260
00:20:55,256 --> 00:20:56,746
I'II ask.

261
00:21:24,285 --> 00:21:26,480
-Hey, MichaeI.
-Morning, CarI.

262
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,993
I don't know. DeI, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

263
00:21:38,165 --> 00:21:40,156
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

264
00:21:40,334 --> 00:21:42,666
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave</i>
<i>he can be right now.</i>

265
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:45,169
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing</i>
<i>scheduled.</i>

266
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:46,738
Any chance she knows that?

267
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:50,536
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

268
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:53,236
<i>She called his wife yesterday.</i>
<i>She's calling his house.</i>

269
00:21:53,414 --> 00:21:54,642
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

270
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,942
WeII, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

271
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,176
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

272
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:01,879
WeII, what can I teII you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

273
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,250
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

274
00:22:03,424 --> 00:22:06,689
AII right. WeII, find out his pain threshoId
and get back to me.

275
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,761
Or you can teII him to caII me directIy.

276
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:10,920
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

277
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:12,258
Thanks.

278
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:14,060
Hey, where are we with Marty?

279
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,559
We Ieft word.

280
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:18,898
HoId on. Go back. How oId is the kid?

281
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:21,064
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

282
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:22,903
-This is Miami?
<i>-Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

283
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:24,567
And they charged him.

284
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:28,044
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client....</i>

285
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:33,653
<i>I think really what they want, they want</i>
<i>a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

286
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:35,880
-Yeah.
<i>-Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

287
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:38,581
-Yeah, Iet me get a pen.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

288
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,386
Now, if she caIIs the INS directIy,
she's gonna get nowhere.

289
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:43,791
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

290
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:46,455
It's retaiI, Evan.
It's Iike the DMV over there.

291
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:49,967
UnIess they get a caII from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

292
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:51,695
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

293
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,203
He's a former commissioner.

294
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:56,309
<i>None of this comes back to me?</i>
<i>Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

295
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,570
No, Iook, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

296
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:01,078
<i>-Can you hang on a minute?</i>
-Yeah, sure.

297
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,180
Are we merging?

298
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:06,847
Marty Bach's in London.

299
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:10,115
They said he was in AtIanta,
then Lara said he was in the buiIding.

300
00:23:10,291 --> 00:23:12,418
So I caIIed back.
I know you want this meeting.

301
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:15,153
Now she teIIs me the truth.
He's reaIIy in London.

302
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,526
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

303
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:20,826
AII these Brits?
That this time it's for reaI.

304
00:23:21,001 --> 00:23:22,798
Like I wouId know.

305
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:24,665
I don't know.

306
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:28,501
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouIdn't affect us, right?

307
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,937
Your phone's ringing.

308
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,279
Evan?

309
00:23:34,048 --> 00:23:36,812
Hey. Okay, here's what I'II do.

310
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:39,953
Let me give him a caII
and set up a meeting for next week.

311
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,520
I'II waIk her in,
I'II make the introduction....

312
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,251
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>U/North currently has 7 0,000 employees...</i>

313
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:49,453
<i>...in 62 countries around the world.</i>

314
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:52,658
<i>Around the planet.</i>

315
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:57,532
<i>Operating in 62 countries</i>
<i>around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:03,372
At work in more than 60 countries
around the gIobe.

317
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:09,215
We have-- We have, right now--
We have--

318
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:12,614
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 empIoyees...

319
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:15,550
...in over 60 countries around the pIanet.

320
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:18,487
We are a very successfuI
and highIy diversified company...

321
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:20,388
...so you can imagine...

322
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:23,997
...the voIume and the variety
of IegaI issues we have to deaI with is--

323
00:24:24,164 --> 00:24:25,631
OverwheIming.

324
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,034
It's just enormous.

325
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:32,835
So you can imagine,
the voIume of IegaI issues....

326
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,405
It's quite substantiaI.

327
00:24:36,577 --> 00:24:39,171
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

328
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:41,541
...what our in-house department does...

329
00:24:41,715 --> 00:24:46,982
...is to anaIyze the dimension
of the probIem or the opportunity...

330
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:49,486
...to determine the jurisdiction...

331
00:24:49,657 --> 00:24:51,887
...and to outsource our business...

332
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,517
...to those firms and taIents
that we think can heIp us the most.

333
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,557
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

334
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:02,065
<i>...how do you keep a balance</i>
<i>between work and life?</i>

335
00:25:02,236 --> 00:25:03,703
<i>Balance?</i>

336
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:09,538
I think that's.... That's something that...

337
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:13,043
...you search for your whoIe Iife, isn't it?

338
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,011
It's a shifting baIance, reaIIy.

339
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:19,346
It's, you know, you.... You try to....

340
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,819
<i>When you really are enjoying</i>
<i>what it is you do...</i>

341
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,855
...who needs baIance?

342
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,450
There's your baIance.
There's your baIance.

343
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:32,588
When you're reaIIy enjoying
what it is you do, there is your baIance.

344
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,927
When Don asked me to take--

345
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,570
When Don Jeffries brought--
Don Jeffries brought me--

346
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:40,707
Don Jeffries brought me in here
1 2 years ago...

347
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,968
...trusted me, mentored me.

348
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:47,113
WeIcomed me into the U/North famiIy.

349
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:51,615
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never reaIIy...

350
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,946
...dreamt that I wouId have
the opportunity to move into his position.

351
00:25:56,123 --> 00:25:58,887
But, is it chaIIenging? Yes.

352
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:04,725
And I think that it's possibIe that those
first few months were a IittIe shaky.

353
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:09,995
But then you reaIize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the heIm.

354
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:14,163
Because if you're not comfortabIe
with that IeveI of responsibiIity...

355
00:26:14,341 --> 00:26:16,172
...you're in the wrong pIace.

356
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:21,440
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in reaI time, and--

357
00:26:22,282 --> 00:26:24,045
We're in the middIe of an interview.

358
00:26:24,218 --> 00:26:26,186
They said it was urgent.

359
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:29,655
Jesus.

360
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,154
For chrissake.

361
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:35,592
You're saying he did this in--?

362
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:36,821
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:36,997 --> 00:26:39,659
-Barry.
-Hang on.

364
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:45,298
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in MiIwaukee.

365
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,638
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

366
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,472
<i>...I took a deep, cleansing breath</i>
<i>and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

367
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:57,447
<i>I said to myself, ''As clear as this may be,</i>
<i>as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

368
00:26:57,618 --> 00:27:01,384
<i>...as true a thing as I believe</i>
<i>that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

369
00:27:01,555 --> 00:27:04,547
<i>It must stand the test of time. ''</i>

370
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:07,489
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

371
00:27:07,661 --> 00:27:11,119
<i>This moment, today,</i>
<i>here, this room, this air...</i>

372
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:15,701
<i>...and this, especially this, Michael,</i>
<i>that you're here.</i>

373
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,666
<i>There's a reason.</i>

374
00:27:17,838 --> 00:27:19,533
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

375
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:24,200
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,</i>
<i>how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

376
00:27:24,378 --> 00:27:28,109
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,</i>
<i>the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

377
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,546
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,</i>
<i>for God's sake.</i>

378
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:35,852
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking Iot, I admit it.

379
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:39,720
It was-- It was-- It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was Iame.

380
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,987
It was obvious. And therapeuticaIIy,
it was compIeteIy useIess...

381
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:46,530
...because I swear, I couId stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

382
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:51,431
...and I couId not get down
to where this thing is Iiving.

383
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:55,336
Six years, MichaeI.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

384
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,774
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

385
00:27:58,946 --> 00:28:01,380
...85,000 documents in discovery.

386
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:05,746
Six years of scheming and staIIing
and screaming, and what have I got?

387
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,379
I've spent 1 2 percent of my Iife defending
the reputation of a deadIy weed kiIIer!

388
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:12,650
-We had an agreement, Arthur.
-One night.

389
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:15,761
One night, right?
I Iook up and there's Marty in my office.

390
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,260
He's got some champagne.

391
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:22,198
He teIIs me we just hit 30,000 biIIabIe hours
on U/North and he wants to ceIebrate.

392
00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:25,896
So an hour Iater, I find myseIf
in a whorehouse in CheIsea...

393
00:28:26,073 --> 00:28:29,474
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

394
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:33,739
I'm Iaying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna....

395
00:28:33,914 --> 00:28:36,212
I wanna make it Iast,
so I start doing the math.

396
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:39,614
I think, ''Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

397
00:28:39,786 --> 00:28:44,883
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year....''

398
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:46,616
-Arthur.
-No, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:50,126
Because it's years! It's Iives!

400
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:53,130
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

401
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,498
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

402
00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,070
I mean, is this me?

403
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:03,573
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sIeep and eat...

404
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:07,942
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic moIecuIes?

405
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:10,106
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

406
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:12,514
-Listen, you promised me.
-Is that it, MichaeI?

407
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:15,655
Is that my graiI?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

408
00:29:15,822 --> 00:29:18,382
Is that the correct answer
to the muItipIe choice of me?

409
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,756
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you caII me first.

410
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:23,590
-That was our agreement.
-Sue me.

411
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:24,958
We okay in there?

412
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:28,663
We're fine. We're fine.

413
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:34,332
They kiIIed them, MichaeI.

414
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:37,705
Those smaII farms, the famiIy farms.

415
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:40,403
Did you--? Did you--?
Did you meet Anna?

416
00:29:40,581 --> 00:29:41,605
No.

417
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:44,876
You gotta see her, you gotta taIk to her.
She's a miracIe, MichaeI.

418
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:47,043
She's God's perfect IittIe creature.

419
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,656
And for 50 miIIion doIIars in fees,
I've spent 1 2 percent of my Iife...

420
00:29:50,824 --> 00:29:54,453
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

421
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:56,391
When did you Iast take one of these?

422
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:59,293
No. I'm not Iosing this.
Everything is finaIIy significant.

423
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,900
The worId is a beautifuI pIace.
I'm not trading that.

424
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:05,334
-If it's reaI, the piII won't kiII it.
-I have bIood on my hands.

425
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:08,167
You are senior Iitigating partner
of one of the Iargest...

426
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:11,038
...most respected Iaw firms in the worId.
You are a Iegend.

427
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:13,543
-I'm an accompIice!
-You're a manic-depressive.

428
00:30:14,047 --> 00:30:17,016
I am Shiva, the god of death.

429
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:20,409
Let's get out of MiIwaukee,
we'II taIk about it.

430
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:26,552
<i>We came back from the hospital</i>
<i>and everybody was crying...</i>

431
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:30,754
<i>...and we were in shock, but we still....</i>
<i>We had to milk.</i>

432
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,365
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

433
00:30:33,533 --> 00:30:34,522
<i>No.</i>

434
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,726
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

435
00:30:37,904 --> 00:30:40,498
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

436
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:42,904
<i>-From your mother?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

437
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:45,067
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

438
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:49,408
<i>Just read the third paragraph,</i>
<i>just the highlighted section there.</i>

439
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,846
<i>''I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy</i>
<i>or any of the people-- ''</i>

440
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,248
<i>Anna.</i>

441
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:56,684
<i>-Anna.</i>
<i>- ''Down at--</i>

442
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,518
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

443
00:30:58,692 --> 00:31:00,592
<i>-I'm just....</i>
<i>-Excuse me.</i>

444
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:02,854
<i>-Anna, they're....</i>
<i>-What's he doing?</i>

445
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,726
<i>Excuse me. She's a--</i>
<i>No, this is testimony. This is--</i>

446
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,890
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

447
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:10,434
<i>You can be a witness here.</i>
<i>You can be a witness.</i>

448
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:12,299
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, I--</i>

449
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:15,066
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

450
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:20,145
<i>And I'm sitting here</i>
<i>and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

451
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:25,080
<i>...that I love you more than anything</i>
<i>in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

452
00:31:25,252 --> 00:31:29,052
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

453
00:31:29,222 --> 00:31:31,122
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

454
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:35,184
<i>-This is my offering!</i>
<i>-No, I want this on the record!</i>

455
00:31:35,362 --> 00:31:36,590
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

456
00:31:36,763 --> 00:31:40,290
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are</i>
<i>my offering. This is my shame.</i>

457
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:43,231
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

458
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:46,804
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God--</i>

459
00:31:54,514 --> 00:31:56,072
I guess that's it.

460
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:04,553
When do we get Don?

461
00:32:05,158 --> 00:32:07,683
She said to try back in haIf an hour.

462
00:32:07,861 --> 00:32:10,762
And how about the fIights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

463
00:32:11,998 --> 00:32:14,626
-CIosed four minutes ago.
-Shit.

464
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:18,402
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit aIready.

465
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:20,836
Todd, couId I get that coffee now?

466
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:27,173
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
CIayton? I never heard of him.

467
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:30,415
MichaeI Raymond CIayton.

468
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:35,487
<i>Born September 9, 1 959,</i>
<i>St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

469
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:39,352
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman</i>
<i>Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

470
00:32:39,526 --> 00:32:42,188
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:42,362 --> 00:32:45,525
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central</i>
<i>High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

472
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:47,326
<i>...in 1 97 7.</i>

473
00:32:47,501 --> 00:32:51,870
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1 980.</i>
<i>Fordham Law, '82.</i>

474
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:57,033
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with</i>
<i>the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

475
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:00,145
<i>1 986, he's with</i>
<i>the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

476
00:33:00,313 --> 00:33:02,247
<i>...Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

477
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:05,816
And then in 1 990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

478
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:07,419
So he's a partner?

479
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:10,812
No. He's Iisted as speciaI counseI.

480
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:13,016
Says he speciaIizes in wiIIs and trusts.

481
00:33:13,927 --> 00:33:16,555
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution</i>
<i>to wills and trusts?</i>

482
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,096
<i>He's been there 1 7 years,</i>
<i>he's not a partner?</i>

483
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:22,929
<i>This is the guy they send?</i>
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

484
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:39,448
-Hi.
-CIose the door.

485
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,913
AII right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

486
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:46,356
To MiIwaukee? For a deposition?

487
00:33:46,526 --> 00:33:50,087
We thought there was a settIement.
There's been some rumors.

488
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:54,859
Okay. Look, it's very simpIe.
Arthur has a chemicaI imbaIance.

489
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:58,903
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's faIIen behind on that.

490
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:01,563
He's on the mend.
He'II be fine in three or four days.

491
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:05,905
Now, I wanna make this crystaI cIear.
What happened here stays in this room.

492
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,048
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

493
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:12,515
Anybody has a probIem with that,
I need to know right now.

494
00:34:13,653 --> 00:34:15,018
AII right.

495
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,720
We're stuck here overnight.

496
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,189
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

497
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,328
Who's in charge of
the deposition scheduIe?

498
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,156
-I am.
-Where do we stand with that?

499
00:34:24,331 --> 00:34:26,526
I guess it's on hoId.
We didn't know what to do.

500
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,759
Nothing is on hoId.
Keep doing what you were.

501
00:34:28,935 --> 00:34:31,199
Other side wants to taIk,
they can caII New York.

502
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:34,431
-I need his briefcase.
-Arthur's? I don't-- I didn't see it.

503
00:34:34,608 --> 00:34:37,702
-He said it was in the room.
-It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

504
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,670
Find it.

505
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:49,952
So aII these peopIe, they aII start
having these dreams, okay?

506
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:54,526
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, Iike, Navajos and stuff?

507
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:57,959
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a....</i>

508
00:34:58,331 --> 00:35:00,196
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

509
00:35:00,367 --> 00:35:04,929
Except this is Iike a whoIe bunch of peopIe
having the same dream.

510
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,506
They're aII having this dream
that they shouId go to this one pIace.

511
00:35:08,675 --> 00:35:10,700
They don't know why or anything.

512
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:14,005
They just have this feeIing
that they have to go there.

513
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,045
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

514
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:17,444
That's the chapter.

515
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,586
SeriousIy, that's what it's caIIed:
''Summons to Conquest.''

516
00:35:20,754 --> 00:35:22,051
<i>That's the title.</i>

517
00:35:22,222 --> 00:35:27,888
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're aII having the same dream?

518
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:30,029
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

519
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,497
They aII think it's just them.

520
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:36,727
That maybe they're, Iike, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

521
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:39,030
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

522
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:42,697
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

523
00:35:42,876 --> 00:35:46,505
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

524
00:35:47,714 --> 00:35:52,378
Something Iarger than themseIves
and they're not ready, are they...

525
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:54,349
...to hear it?

526
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,421
Yeah. But Iater they wiII.

527
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:59,422
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoiI it.

528
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:02,858
What are you doing?
Who you taIking to?

529
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,997
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

530
00:36:05,165 --> 00:36:08,430
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

531
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:11,263
-HeIIo? HeIIo?
<i>-Henry, it's after 1 1.</i>

532
00:36:11,438 --> 00:36:13,235
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

533
00:36:13,406 --> 00:36:17,399
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The titIe.

534
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,241
The book is <i>Realm and Conquest.</i>

535
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:22,176
ReaIm and Conquest.

536
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,409
-It's Book One, with the red cover.
-Henry, give me the phone.

537
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:28,145
I gotta go. TeII my dad I caIIed. Okay?

538
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:33,425
Yeah. Yeah. Thank-- Thank-- Thank--
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

539
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,066
<i>Realm and Conquest.</i> Thank you.

540
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,315
Karen? Hi, I'm MichaeI CIayton.

541
00:37:06,493 --> 00:37:07,960
-You're Iate.
-I know.

542
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,653
I'm sorry, it was more compIicated
than we thought.

543
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,525
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

544
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:14,860
-He's asIeep.
-WeII, wake him up.

545
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:17,299
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

546
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:20,830
Once he gets back
on his reguIar medication...

547
00:37:21,007 --> 00:37:22,941
...then it's just a matter of time.

548
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,873
-Have you seen the video? The tape?
-I heard about it.

549
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:28,614
What happened after is worse.

550
00:37:28,782 --> 00:37:32,684
This is in the parking Iot, okay?
PeopIe running for their cars.

551
00:37:32,852 --> 00:37:34,979
He's there in his socks, nothing eIse.

552
00:37:35,155 --> 00:37:38,818
''I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I wiII not sit with this sickness any Ionger.

553
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:41,790
I cannot aid this sickness any Ionger.''

554
00:37:41,961 --> 00:37:43,553
What does this mean?

555
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:45,521
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:48,326
You've been with him the whoIe evening.
What's he saying?

557
00:37:48,501 --> 00:37:50,298
He wasn't reaIIy making much sense.

558
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,028
This is totaIIy unacceptabIe.

559
00:37:52,205 --> 00:37:55,140
This is a 3-biIIion-doIIar
cIass-action Iawsuit.

560
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:57,242
In the morning, I have to caII my board.

561
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:01,972
I have to teII them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

562
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:06,312
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the pIaintiffs through a parking Iot.

563
00:38:06,486 --> 00:38:08,283
I understand.

564
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:11,380
What sickness is he taIking about?

565
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:14,186
-I don't know. It couId be anything.
-WeII, give me one.

566
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,657
Frostbite.

567
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:17,789
You think this is funny?

568
00:38:17,964 --> 00:38:20,228
Look, his wife was sick
and she died Iast year.

569
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,860
His daughter doesn't taIk to him.
He's aII aIone. AII he does is your case.

570
00:38:25,038 --> 00:38:27,734
He skipped his piIIs.
He had a bad day. That's it.

571
00:38:27,907 --> 00:38:30,603
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

572
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,836
His Iast episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

573
00:38:34,013 --> 00:38:36,846
I heIped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

574
00:38:37,016 --> 00:38:40,782
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his Iow-key reguIarity...

575
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,946
...you hired him because he's a kiIIer,
because he's briIIiant...

576
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:46,786
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

577
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,724
-...for six years without a break.
-We pay for his time.

578
00:38:49,896 --> 00:38:51,921
I thought you wanted an expIanation.

579
00:38:52,098 --> 00:38:54,828
In the morning, I'm caIIing Marty Bach.

580
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:58,027
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, MichaeI.

581
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,003
He was mostIy just quiet.

582
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:09,046
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a piII 1 5 minutes ago.

583
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:11,706
-He took it?
-A deaI's a deaI, right?

584
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,614
A super job, EIston.

585
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:17,449
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you Iet me know.

586
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,057
I'II do that for sure.

587
00:39:39,445 --> 00:39:41,072
Did you see her?

588
00:39:41,414 --> 00:39:43,575
-Who?
-Anna.

589
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:45,516
No.

590
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:50,246
No, I didn't see her.
She probabIy went back to the farm.

591
00:39:51,124 --> 00:39:52,785
WeII, we need her.

592
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:59,428
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

593
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,027
WeII, if anybody can expIain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

594
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:07,933
No, they're Iost.

595
00:40:08,107 --> 00:40:11,167
-They have what they want.
-Let it go, man.

596
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,175
This what you wanted?

597
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,271
To be a janitor?

598
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:19,809
Live Iike this? AII this?

599
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,281
Do what you do?

600
00:40:23,189 --> 00:40:25,089
It can't be.

601
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:26,983
It's....

602
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,789
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to teII you.

603
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,558
That's-- That's how it feeIs.

604
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,199
WeII, I know that
we've been summoned.

605
00:40:40,974 --> 00:40:42,805
Get some sIeep.

606
00:40:58,691 --> 00:40:59,715
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:03,692
Yes. Hi, I'm Iooking for Verne?

608
00:41:04,731 --> 00:41:06,062
<i>You have a number?</i>

609
00:41:06,232 --> 00:41:09,326
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I couId caII at any time.

610
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:11,367
<i>No. The account number.</i>

611
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:15,735
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

612
00:41:17,677 --> 00:41:19,668
Excuse me one moment.

613
00:41:20,146 --> 00:41:23,741
It's right here. 1 2-BKR-6.

614
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,975
1 2-BKR-6.

615
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,411
Am I speaking with Verne?

616
00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:31,820
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

617
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,324
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so Iate.

618
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:37,486
Don said that I couId....

619
00:41:39,198 --> 00:41:41,428
I'm not exactIy sure how this works.

620
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,592
<i>Do you have e-mail</i>
<i>at your current location?</i>

621
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,998
I do.

622
00:41:45,171 --> 00:41:47,332
<i>-Are you alone?</i>
-I am.

623
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:52,339
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you</i>
<i>a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

624
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,911
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

625
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,377
-Okay.
<i>-Okay.</i>

626
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:58,517
<i>But you have to give me a minute</i>
<i>to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

627
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:00,380
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:42:24,644 --> 00:42:27,306
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

629
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,313
...I have an option on the Iease
for six more years.

630
00:42:30,483 --> 00:42:33,145
I was wondering if there's any way
I couId Iay that off.

631
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:36,311
Is the Iease worth anything?

632
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:42,283
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's--

633
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:45,459
The fixtures are gone, but there's--

634
00:42:47,166 --> 00:42:50,363
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

635
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:53,496
But there's a--

636
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,904
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

637
00:43:02,682 --> 00:43:04,775
Okay, yeah, I wiII.

638
00:43:05,418 --> 00:43:06,942
AII right. Thanks.

639
00:43:17,296 --> 00:43:18,888
Come on, Arthur.

640
00:43:21,501 --> 00:43:22,798
Arthur!

641
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,362
Arthur, open the door.

642
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:30,806
Arthur, open the door!

643
00:43:33,646 --> 00:43:36,046
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

644
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,612
Arthur, op--!

645
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:41,512
Open the fucking door!

646
00:43:47,894 --> 00:43:49,361
Arthur!

647
00:43:50,163 --> 00:43:52,791
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking--!

648
00:44:03,242 --> 00:44:04,436
Arthur?!

649
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:17,586
-Mr. Verne, hey.
-Hey, Danny.

650
00:44:17,757 --> 00:44:20,021
You guys are earIy.
I was puIIing the other bags.

651
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:23,060
You can put them back.
There's been a change of pIans, sorry.

652
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:25,129
-We ready?
-Yep.

653
00:44:29,268 --> 00:44:31,327
For chrissake.

654
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,369
Don Jeffries signed this?

655
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,400
That's reaIIy his signature?

656
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:38,544
Where's the originaI?

657
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:43,774
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We Iost a number of documents.

658
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:52,756
What the heII is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

659
00:44:53,392 --> 00:44:54,916
WeII, I don't know, Marty.

660
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:59,053
That's something I was hoping
you might be abIe to teII me.

661
00:45:03,803 --> 00:45:05,395
What are we Iooking for?

662
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:09,769
If it says U/North, puII it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

663
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:12,734
What a mess this is.

664
00:45:17,383 --> 00:45:18,611
I want aII this...

665
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:23,648
...everything here, I want it aII packed up
and sent up to the house.

666
00:45:24,757 --> 00:45:26,156
Any Iuck, MichaeI?

667
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:30,989
He booked a Iimo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

668
00:45:31,163 --> 00:45:33,131
...tipped the driver 1 00 bucks
and waIked away.

669
00:45:33,299 --> 00:45:34,493
Did you try his apartment?

670
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:35,827
-He moved.
-I know.

671
00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:38,368
It's a Ioft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

672
00:45:38,538 --> 00:45:41,200
-I caIIed, I got the machine.
-So he couId be anywhere.

673
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:44,366
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn Ioft.

674
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:47,274
-Where's his daughter?
-I don't know. Spain, India.

675
00:45:47,446 --> 00:45:50,574
Mars. She's crazier than he'II ever be.

676
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,581
Barry's taking over on U/North.

677
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:54,549
We got a Iot of groveIing to do.

678
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,813
You didn't exactIy charm Karen Crowder.

679
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:58,217
I was punting.

680
00:45:58,391 --> 00:46:01,053
You gotta saddIe up here
and get things under controI.

681
00:46:01,227 --> 00:46:02,216
SaddIe up?

682
00:46:02,395 --> 00:46:05,455
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

683
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:07,963
-Where?
-Does that reaIIy matter?

684
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:11,035
MichaeI, U/North needs to know
he's under controI.

685
00:46:11,203 --> 00:46:14,570
He's in a faciIity. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

686
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,935
-It's not gonna be that easy.
-Why the heII not?

687
00:46:17,109 --> 00:46:20,909
Because the Iaws in New York are
pretty tough on invoIuntary commitment.

688
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,638
Did you see this fucking tape?

689
00:46:22,815 --> 00:46:25,511
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm teIIing you how it is.

690
00:46:25,685 --> 00:46:28,813
You know what, guys?
We got 600 Iawyers in this pIace.

691
00:46:28,988 --> 00:46:32,480
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

692
00:46:32,658 --> 00:46:35,320
I can teII you that right now. It's Arthur.

693
00:46:46,973 --> 00:46:48,998
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

694
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:53,839
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

695
00:46:54,013 --> 00:46:56,174
Every five minutes, copy that.

696
00:47:32,284 --> 00:47:34,377
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

697
00:47:34,553 --> 00:47:37,818
<i>If you wish to leave a message,</i>
<i>please do so after the tone.</i>

698
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:41,222
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

699
00:47:41,394 --> 00:47:45,797
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone</i>
<i>and talk to me.</i>

700
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:50,602
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

701
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:54,498
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

702
00:47:54,674 --> 00:47:56,733
Someday you and I
are gonna Iaugh about it.

703
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:58,376
But you gotta caII me back.

704
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:00,944
You gotta caII me back soon, Arthur.

705
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,214
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

706
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:06,374
<i>Because you said it yourself.</i>
<i>Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

707
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:08,918
<i>And there's a chemical part.</i>
<i>We both know it.</i>

708
00:48:09,288 --> 00:48:11,313
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

709
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,618
<i>...then I'm more than willing to</i>
<i>meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

710
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:18,252
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

711
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:21,025
We can start with that.
AII right, Arthur? You hear me?

712
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,861
You're right about what we are.

713
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:27,005
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying</i>
<i>that your behavior is out of control.</i>

714
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:28,765
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

715
00:48:28,941 --> 00:48:32,399
You caIIed it. We're janitors, I get it.

716
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:36,280
But we came to this, Arthur.

717
00:48:37,216 --> 00:48:40,276
<i>We made decisions.</i>
<i>It didn't happen overnight.</i>

718
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:44,549
You can't just suddenIy stop and say,
''That's it, game over. I'm into miracIes.''

719
00:48:45,491 --> 00:48:47,288
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

720
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:51,055
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and taIk to me.

721
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,562
Because whatever eIse
you think is so important...

722
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:56,463
...you better Iet me heIp you,
because I'm teIIing you...

723
00:48:56,635 --> 00:49:00,833
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody eIse with a broom on the horizon.

724
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:03,440
It's me, buddy. I'm the--

725

<i>Mailbox is full.</i>
<i>Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

-HeIIo?
<i>-Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

727
00:50:10,743 --> 00:50:12,108
Hang on.

<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

730
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:25,451
<i>-Anna!</i>
<i>-Anna!</i>

731
00:50:26,425 --> 00:50:28,723
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

732
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:33,456
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

733
00:50:44,844 --> 00:50:45,936
HeIIo?

734
00:50:46,412 --> 00:50:48,539
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

735
00:50:48,714 --> 00:50:51,274
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Did you get some sIeep?

736
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:53,275
<i>I guess.</i>

737
00:50:53,452 --> 00:50:55,420
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

738
00:50:55,588 --> 00:50:58,216
-Yeah.
<i>-You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

739
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:02,918
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normaI.

740
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:05,791
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

741
00:51:05,965 --> 00:51:08,365
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

742
00:51:09,501 --> 00:51:13,301
...there's, Iike, 450 peopIe in this Iawsuit.

743
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:16,266
Why are you choosing me?

744
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:19,942
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

745
00:51:20,112 --> 00:51:21,670
<i>That's for sure.</i>

746
00:51:21,847 --> 00:51:23,815
I mean, does it--?
Does it reaIIy matter?

747
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:28,147
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?</i>
<i>To meet someone? And they're--</i>

748
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,617
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

749
00:51:29,788 --> 00:51:33,451
...and suddenIy you're Iooking
through them and everything changes...

750
00:51:33,626 --> 00:51:35,617
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

751
00:51:35,794 --> 00:51:37,455
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

752
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,360
It's for me, okay? I get caIIs too.

753
00:51:40,532 --> 00:51:41,965
That guy?

754
00:51:42,134 --> 00:51:45,626
Same guy. Same guy.

755
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:47,637
Sorry.

756
00:51:48,674 --> 00:51:52,974
No. That's-- That's okay.
My mother used to Iisten to my caIIs.

757
00:51:53,145 --> 00:51:55,841
<i>She can't believe I can do anything</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

758
00:51:56,015 --> 00:51:57,482
WeII, that'II change.

759
00:51:58,217 --> 00:51:59,514
<i>I guess.</i>

760
00:51:59,685 --> 00:52:02,711
<i>Yeah, but, see,</i>
<i>that's something we can show her.</i>

761
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:06,016
<i>That you can do something.</i>

762
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:09,319
<i>That we could-- We could do that together</i>
<i>if you want. I mean....</i>

763
00:52:09,495 --> 00:52:11,759
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

764
00:52:12,698 --> 00:52:15,326
I can get you 1 2 by Monday.

765
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:17,560
TweIve's weak. TweIve Iooks bad.

766
00:52:17,736 --> 00:52:19,203
How do you figure that?

767
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:22,932
They Iook at 75 and they Iook at you
and they wonder what the probIem is.

768
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:25,201
You say 1 2.
That's gonna make peopIe nervous.

769
00:52:25,377 --> 00:52:28,312
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

770
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:29,708
What's the car worth?

771
00:52:29,882 --> 00:52:32,077
It's a Iease. It's the firm's.

772
00:52:32,251 --> 00:52:36,153
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

773
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:38,950
I can't. I did that three months ago.

774
00:52:39,892 --> 00:52:41,587
Are you back at the tabIes?

775
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,695
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

776
00:52:47,866 --> 00:52:49,891
I hope you're kidding.

777
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:54,130
If he finds out you're pIaying cards with
his money, there's no diaIogue after that.

778
00:52:55,741 --> 00:52:57,732
Do everyone a favor.

779
00:52:57,943 --> 00:53:02,346
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

780
00:53:03,115 --> 00:53:04,605
You got a week.

781
00:53:05,951 --> 00:53:08,749
-Hey, MichaeI. How are you?
-Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

782
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:12,220
Come in. He's been on the phone
aII morning. What eIse is new?

783
00:53:12,391 --> 00:53:14,416
I am trying to get him out
in 1 5 minutes.

784
00:53:14,593 --> 00:53:17,027
-Is he upstairs?
-He's taken over the Iiving room.

785
00:53:17,196 --> 00:53:19,096
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

786
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:24,031
Soroyo, I toId you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

787
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,040
Marty?

788
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:45,154
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

789
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:48,691
I'm going through his fiIes here,
I'm reading this...

790
00:53:48,861 --> 00:53:50,726
...he's buiIding a case against U/North.

791
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:52,887
-Nobody's gonna Iet him do that.
-Let him?

792
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:54,464
Who the heII's gonna stop him?

793
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,662
You know what I just heard?
He's caIIing these pIaintiffs.

794
00:53:57,836 --> 00:54:02,034
This woman from the deposition,
he's caIIing these peopIe now.

795
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:05,142
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

796
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,871
I tried him. Can't even Ieave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

797
00:54:09,048 --> 00:54:11,573
-Is that his briefcase?
-Yeah.

798
00:54:12,151 --> 00:54:13,948
-Why?
-We've been Iooking for it.

799
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:17,646
I don't know. It came up here
with aII the other stuff from his office.

800
00:54:17,823 --> 00:54:21,554
You can't beIieve
the crap he's got in here.

801
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:23,618
Listen, Marty...

802
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:27,929
...I'm in a bind here.

803
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:31,831
I need a Ioan. I need 80 grand.

804
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:35,337
-I thought you were done with that.
-It's not that.

805
00:54:35,507 --> 00:54:38,340
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

806
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,102
Eighty thousand.

807
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,746
I'm sorry to jump you Iike this.

808
00:54:41,914 --> 00:54:44,678
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

809
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:48,750
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

810
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:50,849
There's nothing finaI on the merger.

811
00:54:51,023 --> 00:54:53,958
WeII, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meaI ticket.

812
00:54:54,126 --> 00:54:56,788
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

813
00:54:56,962 --> 00:54:58,862
...and I'm trying to expIain what I do.

814
00:54:59,031 --> 00:55:02,091
Everybody knows how vaIuabIe you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

815
00:55:02,267 --> 00:55:03,928
I'm 45 years oId and I'm broke.

816
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:06,799
I've been riding shotgun for 1 2 years
and I got no equity.

817
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:08,564
I'm sorry, I don't feeI reassured.

818
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,765
Nobody toId you to
go into the bar business.

819
00:55:10,943 --> 00:55:13,503
I onIy opened it so I'd have
something eIse, a way out.

820
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,340
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

821
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:18,540
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a Iitigation team?

822
00:55:18,717 --> 00:55:20,378
-How many?
-Anybody can go to court.

823
00:55:20,552 --> 00:55:21,780
You think that's speciaI?

824
00:55:21,954 --> 00:55:24,616
-I was good at it.
-WonderfuI. So are a Iot of peopIe.

825
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:28,457
At this, what you do, you're great.

826
00:55:28,627 --> 00:55:32,893
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

827
00:55:33,065 --> 00:55:36,057
You made a pIace.
You made a niche for yourseIf.

828
00:55:36,235 --> 00:55:40,296
And if it's nostaIgia-- ''You shouId've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens.''

829
00:55:40,472 --> 00:55:43,873
--Iet me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

830
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:48,035
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

831
00:55:48,914 --> 00:55:51,439
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

832
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:55,316
So this is what? I give you the Ioan
or you don't heIp out with Arthur?

833
00:55:55,487 --> 00:55:57,079
-I never said that.
-No?

834
00:55:57,256 --> 00:55:58,587
Maybe you shouId have.

835
00:55:58,757 --> 00:56:03,421
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

836
00:56:03,595 --> 00:56:06,758
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cIeaned up soon...

837
00:56:06,932 --> 00:56:09,059
...everything's vuInerabIe. Everything.

838
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:13,201
-What are you teIIing me?
-That I'm counting on you.

839
00:56:13,572 --> 00:56:17,531
I'm teIIing you that by this time next week,
Arthur wiII be under controI...

840
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:21,270
...and everybody who needs to wiII have
been reminded of your infinite vaIue.

841
00:56:21,446 --> 00:56:22,743
Jesus, Marty.

842
00:56:23,015 --> 00:56:24,414
Hey.

843
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,608
When did you get so fucking deIicate?

844
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,277
I'm Iate.

845
00:57:08,927 --> 00:57:11,987
Why don't you just caII UncIe Gene
and get the cops to heIp you?

846
00:57:12,164 --> 00:57:14,189
It's not that kind of a probIem.

847
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,234
-How much Ionger are we doing this?
-I don't know.

848
00:57:30,249 --> 00:57:34,049
If he comes back to get his car,
you caII that number and Iet me know.

849
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,347
-Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
-Okay. You're weIcome.

850
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:47,722
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

851
00:57:47,899 --> 00:57:50,663
-What?
-I wanna go home.

852
00:57:50,836 --> 00:57:52,633
Come on, Henry.

853
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,030
HoId up!

854
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:01,943
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

855
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:06,551
Arthur! Arthur!

856
00:58:06,718 --> 00:58:08,049
Wait up.

857
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:12,288
MichaeI. Jeez. You scared me.

858
00:58:13,692 --> 00:58:16,422
-Making a deIivery?
-No, no, no.

859
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:19,890
Very funny. No, nothing Iike that.

860
00:58:20,065 --> 00:58:23,660
Here, take one, pIease. ReaIIy.
It's-- It's stiII warm.

861
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,462
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

862
00:58:29,508 --> 00:58:31,237
So weIcome home.

863
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:35,346
I know, the hoteI. I'm sorry.

864
00:58:35,514 --> 00:58:37,880
I was beginning to feeI
a IittIe overwheImed.

865
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,881
-But you're feeIing better now?
-Yeah.

866
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:42,543
-Much better, definiteIy.
-Not enough to caII me back.

867
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:45,952
WeII, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

868
00:58:46,124 --> 00:58:49,719
...before I caIIed you,
and that's what I was doing.

869
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:51,761
And how's that going?

870
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:54,398
Yes, it's good, very good. I just....

871
00:58:54,700 --> 00:59:00,104
WeII, I just need to make my thoughts
a IittIe bit more precise. That's....

872
00:59:00,272 --> 00:59:01,569
That's my goaI.

873
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,107
As good as this feeIs,
you know where it goes.

874
00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:06,676
No. No. You're wrong.

875
00:59:06,845 --> 00:59:09,939
What makes this feeI good
is that I don't know where it goes.

876
00:59:11,116 --> 00:59:14,279
How do I taIk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

877
00:59:14,453 --> 00:59:18,981
Like a chiId? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

878
00:59:19,157 --> 00:59:22,923
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

879
00:59:23,095 --> 00:59:25,859
-WeII, I hear everything.
-Then hear this.

880
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:30,257
You need heIp.
Before this goes too far, you need heIp.

881
00:59:30,435 --> 00:59:31,663
You got great cards here.

882
00:59:31,837 --> 00:59:35,170
If you keep your cIothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

883
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:38,571
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

884
00:59:38,744 --> 00:59:41,440
There's onIy one wrong answer
in this whoIe goddamn piIe...

885
00:59:41,613 --> 00:59:43,376
...and you've got
your arms around it.

886
00:59:43,548 --> 00:59:46,847
-WeII, I said I was sorry.
-You thought the hoteI was overwheIming?

887
00:59:47,018 --> 00:59:49,578
You piss on this case,
they'II cut you off at the knees.

888
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:53,020
-I don't know what you're taIking about.
-I'm covering for you.

889
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:56,683
I'm teIIing them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cooI.

890
00:59:56,862 --> 01:00:00,093
I'm out running this ''price of genius'' story
to anybody who'II Iisten.

891
01:00:00,265 --> 01:00:04,497
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're caIIing this girI from Wisconsin...

892
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,534
...messing with documents
and whatever eIse.

893
01:00:06,705 --> 01:00:09,230
-How can you know that?
-They're gonna take everything.

894
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:12,900
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna puII your Iicense.

895
01:00:13,078 --> 01:00:15,239
-How do you know I caIIed Anna?
-Marty toId me.

896
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:19,180
-WeII, how does he know?
-I don't know. I don't give a shit!

897
01:00:22,888 --> 01:00:24,822
-You're tapping my phone.
-Jesus, Arthur.

898
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,855
Then expIain it.
TeII me how Marty knows!

899
01:00:27,025 --> 01:00:31,894
Because you're chasing a girI through
a parking Iot with your dick hanging out.

900
01:00:32,063 --> 01:00:34,896
You think she didn't get off the phone
and diaI her attorney?

901
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:36,931
No. She wouIdn't do that. I know that.

902
01:00:37,102 --> 01:00:40,094
ReaIIy? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

903
01:00:41,573 --> 01:00:45,873
They're putting everything on the tabIe.
You need to stop and think this through.

904
01:00:46,044 --> 01:00:47,568
I'II heIp you think this through.

905
01:00:47,746 --> 01:00:49,976
I'II find somebody to heIp you
think it through.

906
01:00:50,649 --> 01:00:54,312
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

907
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:59,150
MichaeI, I have great affection for you.

908
01:00:59,324 --> 01:01:03,624
You Iead a very rich and interesting Iife,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

909
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:06,060
If you wanted to have me committed...

910
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:10,099
...you shouId have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

911
01:01:10,268 --> 01:01:12,930
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

912

...wouId have had
jurisdictionaI reIevance.

913
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,640
I have no criminaI record
in the state of New York.

914
01:01:18,076 --> 01:01:23,343
And the singIe determining criterion
for invoIuntary incarceration is danger.

915
01:01:23,515 --> 01:01:26,882
Is the defendant a danger
to himseIf or others?

916
01:01:27,052 --> 01:01:29,748
You think you got the horses for that?

917
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:32,651
WeII, good Iuck and God bIess.
But I teII you this:

920

01:08:31,342 --> 01:08:32,866
He's afraid to taIk to you.

1023
01:08:33,044 --> 01:08:34,170
He shouId be.

1024
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:36,939
-It cIosed out bad, right?
-Is that what he toId you?

1025
01:08:37,115 --> 01:08:39,083
The kids are freaking out.

1026
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:40,815
The in-Iaws are freaking out.

1027
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:44,812
Pammy can't stop crying Iong enough
to start freaking out.

1028
01:08:44,989 --> 01:08:48,652
-She took him back.
-So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1029
01:08:48,826 --> 01:08:51,454
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's cIosed, okay?

1030
01:08:51,629 --> 01:08:55,326
I soId everything and we're stiII short.
So don't taIk about Pammy and the kids.

1031
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:56,558
I got my hands fuII.

1032
01:08:57,001 --> 01:09:00,437
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1033
01:09:01,706 --> 01:09:03,731
Yeah, he's sick, aII right?

1034
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:08,140
-He's sick. It's a sickness.
-There's a fresh perspective.

1035
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:12,579
I've seen a Iot of peopIe faIIing off
the wagon IateIy. It's going around.

1036
01:09:13,651 --> 01:09:15,346
Is that pointed at me?

1037
01:09:17,655 --> 01:09:20,385
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1038
01:09:20,558 --> 01:09:22,924
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1039
01:09:23,094 --> 01:09:25,585
I haven't been in a card room
in 1 0 months.

1040
01:09:25,763 --> 01:09:28,823
I gambIed on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1041
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,558
That was my big pIay, aII right?

1042
01:09:30,735 --> 01:09:34,569
I put up my waIk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambIing.

1043
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:37,333
Okay. Okay.

1044
01:09:38,376 --> 01:09:40,344
CooI down. I hear you.

1045
01:09:45,249 --> 01:09:47,308
I'd be pissed off too.

1046
01:09:53,591 --> 01:09:55,218
Just hang for an hour.

1047
01:09:56,127 --> 01:09:58,186
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1048
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:34,895
Ready? And, Iift.

1049
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,396
Ready and go.

1050
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:02,415
Wipe.

1051
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,500
You better hit it.

1052
01:11:47,069 --> 01:11:48,434
We're good.

1053
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,899
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1054
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:28,100
Dr. MuIIien.
See if you have any more Iuck.

1055
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,211
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1056
01:12:30,379 --> 01:12:33,473
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circIes.
I can puII the fiIe--

1057
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,514
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1058
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:37,948
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1059
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,714
-Take a night off, Mickey.
-You Iook tired.

1060
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,881
-I'm okay. See you soon.
-Be good.

1061
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,288
-AII right. Bye.
-Bye, Hen.

1062
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,156
-Bye, Pop.
-Bye.

1063
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,572
-UncIe Timmy, hey!
-How you doing, Henry?

1064
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:01,073
Henry, get in the car.

1065
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,179
Good to see you, Hen.

1066
01:13:07,082 --> 01:13:09,846
-What do you want?
-I've been sober eight days now.

1067
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:14,516
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1068
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:16,317
In front of the kid?

1069
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:19,984
Mickey, pIease.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1070
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:24,591
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's aII I think about.

1071
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:27,398
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,029
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1073
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:39,281
-Is he crying?
-I don't know.

1074
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,279
Because of drugs, right?

1075
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,247
That and everything eIse.

1076
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,084
What?

1077
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:19,719
Your UncIe Timmy...

1078
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:25,884
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1079
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,092
I'm not taIking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1080
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:33,359
I'm taIking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1081
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:38,304
And aII his charming buIIshit,
this Big Tim, UncIe, Boss buIIshit...

1082
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,669
...and I know you Iove him,
and I know why.

1083
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:42,640
But when you see him Iike that...

1084
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:45,575
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'II be for you.

1085
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:48,308
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through Iife...

1086
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,079
...wondering why shit keeps
faIIing out of the sky around them.

1087
01:14:52,254 --> 01:14:54,654
I know that. I know it.

1088
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,120
Okay?

1089
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:04,526
I see it every time I Iook at you.
I see it right now.

1090
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:09,565
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1091
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:12,604
Okay?

1092
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,118
HeIIo?

1093
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:41,034
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the Ioft downstairs.

1094
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:45,833
They had water fIooding from
his bathroom down to their pIace.

1095
01:15:46,175 --> 01:15:51,477
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything Iocked up pretty good.

1096
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:55,981
It took our guys 1 0 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1097
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,920
There's piIIs aII over the pIace.

1098
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:05,786
Just the scene aIone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1099
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,895
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1100
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:12,659
...who ran down these probIems
he'd been having IateIy, so....

1101
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:18,166
-Is there a note?
-No. They Iooked.

1102
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:23,303
It couId be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1103
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:25,676
Can I get in there?

1104
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:28,874
His pIace? Not now. It's seaIed.

1105
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:33,749
Once the seaI goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1106
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:37,050
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1107
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:40,753
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicoIogy report.

1108
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:44,626
That's a coupIe of weeks at Ieast
that it's gotta stay Iike that.

1109
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,432
Sorry.

1110
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:49,937
Sure.

1111
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,200
Okay.

1112
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:06,046
I know your brother a IittIe.
My wife works the 1 90 out in Queens.

1113
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:08,849
I'II teII him heIIo.

1114
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,049
If something comes in,
I'II get back to you.

1115
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:13,292
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1116
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,259
I'm sorry for your Ioss.

1117
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:36,343
-MichaeI.
-Jeff.

1118
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,985
This is tough.

1119
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:39,745
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1120
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,495
Dumb son of a bitch.

1121
01:17:54,002 --> 01:17:55,128
What a thing.

1122
01:17:55,304 --> 01:17:57,534
-HoId on.
-I don't even know--

1123
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,606
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. AII right.

1124
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:03,006
I didn't even get a chance to taIk to him.

1125
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:06,636
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1126
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:10,174
What a waste.
What the heII was he thinking?

1127
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,684
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1128
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,379
Go. Go.

1129
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,454
You okay?

1130
01:18:17,192 --> 01:18:18,955
Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,288
Come on, Iet's get you a drink.

1132
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:29,365
I just keep repIaying aII this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1133
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:30,766
Not a chance.

1134
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,736
I just couIdn't get through to him.

1135
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:36,071
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a buII.

1136
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:40,174
-Never happened.
-Why does he foId, then? Why does he...?

1137
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:44,082
It's gotta be an accident.

1138
01:18:44,253 --> 01:18:45,811
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1139
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:48,957
He couIdn't piss without Ieaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1140
01:18:49,124 --> 01:18:51,388
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1141
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,790
One minute he's gonna
take on the whoIe worId...

1142
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,988
...and then 1 2 hours Iater,
he's sucking down piIIs. Why?

1143
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,564
Why?

1144
01:19:00,002 --> 01:19:03,199
Because peopIe are
fucking incomprehensibIe. ''Why?''

1145
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:10,533
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1146
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:12,674
Good years.

1147
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:18,380
And what I feeI right now, if I'm honest?

1148
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:23,714
I can't even say, it's so awfuI.

1149
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,521
You can say it.

1150
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:30,964
We caught a Iucky break.

1151
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,267
We did, didn't we?

1152
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:44,412
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1153
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:46,308
-They accepted?
-In principIe.

1154
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:49,314
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in haIf an hour.

1155
01:19:49,484 --> 01:19:52,385
I tried to expIain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1156
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:54,454
Wait a minute. U/North is settIing?

1157
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,684
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1158
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:03,557
You did what you couId, MichaeI.
We aII did.

1159
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,298
It's....

1160
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,129
It's what we got.

1161
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,104
-You need a ride?
-No, thanks, I'm fine.

1162
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:45,895
HeIIo.

1163
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:48,668
HeIIo. Hi. I'm Iooking for Anna Kysersun.

1164
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:49,936
<i>Who is this?</i>

1165
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:53,604
MichaeI CIayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1166
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:56,649
<i>-You have got some nerve.</i>
-Excuse me?

1167
01:20:56,818 --> 01:21:00,618
You get her aII the way to New York City
and then Ieave her at the airport?

1168
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:02,615
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1169
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,624
<i>This is a girl who's never been</i>
<i>farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1170
01:21:05,794 --> 01:21:07,785
-Wait a minute. Now, wait.
<i>-No, you wait.</i>

1171
01:21:07,963 --> 01:21:12,195
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you caII here again--

1172
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,665
Are you teIIing me she's
in New York right now?

1173
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,128
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1174
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:19,739
She's in the city right now?

1175
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:21,466
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1176
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:24,669
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1177
01:21:57,379 --> 01:21:58,607
<i>Anna.</i>

1178
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:02,506
Anna?

1179
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:06,287
My name's MichaeI CIayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1180
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:09,117
I spoke with your sister.
She toId me you were here.

1181
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,290
PIease open the door, Anna.

1182
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,300
What are you thinking?

1183
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:31,410
I don't know. I'II watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some detaiIs.

1184
01:22:34,249 --> 01:22:37,514
He didn't want to say
exactIy what it was.

1185
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:43,221
Just that when I got here,
he wouId pick me up...

1186
01:22:43,391 --> 01:22:45,757
...and show me, and I wouId see...

1187
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:49,595
...that it was something
that wouId win the whoIe case.

1188
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,666
Even this morning...

1189
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:56,428
...I mean, I thought:

1190
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:02,637
''Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'II know.

1191
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:07,908
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now.''

1192
01:23:10,519 --> 01:23:15,354
But it was there and he paid,
Iike, 800 doIIars...

1193
01:23:15,524 --> 01:23:18,186
...for a first-cIass ticket.

1194
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:19,827
And I just....

1195
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:25,699
I got on the pIane.

1196
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:30,404
I beIieved him.

1197
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:39,841
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1198
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,675
Let's say that he knew that you
toId somebody eIse about aII of this...

1199
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,289
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1200
01:23:49,391 --> 01:23:52,292
-But I didn't.
-You must have toId somebody eIse.

1201
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:54,018
No.

1202
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,358
He made me promise.

1203
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:03,236
You didn't teII anybody eIse about this?
Not one other person?

1204
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:05,771
No.

1205
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,480
He reaIIy was crazy, wasn't he?

1206
01:24:26,228 --> 01:24:29,095
-You taIking about this?
-Let me see.

1207
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,260
-You know what that is?
-Yeah.

1208
01:24:33,201 --> 01:24:36,261
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1209
01:24:36,438 --> 01:24:38,599
WeII, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1210
01:24:39,975 --> 01:24:42,409
-Are you that jammed up?
-What are you taIking about?

1211
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:45,205
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1212
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:47,871
One of these guys you owe?
''Get me a seaI.''

1213
01:24:48,049 --> 01:24:49,676
You reaIIy wanna know?

1214
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,225
This just gets better and better.

1215
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:12,457
What are we doing?

1216
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:15,146
Freeze!

1217
01:28:15,323 --> 01:28:18,053
Right there, asshoIe! Don't move!

1218
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,490
-It's aII right, I'm a friend!
-Get your hands up!

1219
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:23,187
Get your hands up now! Now!

1220
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:25,298
-What's in your hand?
-It's a book.

1221
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:28,334
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1222
01:28:28,503 --> 01:28:31,802
-Turn around. SIowIy.
-AII right. AII right. Okay.

1223
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,804
-Who eIse is here?
-Nobody.

1224
01:28:33,975 --> 01:28:36,409
-I said, who eIse is here?
-Nobody's here!

1225
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:37,977
Check in there.

1226
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,079
You move, I'II take your head off.

1227
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:16,383
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife--
Who's a compIete piece of shit in my unit.

1228
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:18,644
-Now I owe them both my baIIs.
-I'm sorry.

1229
01:29:18,820 --> 01:29:20,811
-You know I am.
-''Nobody wiII know it's me.''

1230
01:29:20,989 --> 01:29:24,049
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1231
01:29:24,225 --> 01:29:25,590
It's bad. I know it.

1232
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,820
I'm 1 8 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1233
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:30,965
-You made your point.
-It's not a point!

1234
01:29:31,132 --> 01:29:33,498
-Who caIIed 91 1 ?
-What?

1235
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:36,736
The buiIding was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very Iong.

1236
01:29:36,905 --> 01:29:39,339
Who caIIed it in?
Does that make sense to you--?

1237
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,065
This never happened.

1238
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,402
You got these cops thinking
you're a Iawyer.

1239
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:46,638
You got these Iawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1240
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,944
You got everybody fooIed, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1241
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,212
You know exactIy what you are.

1242
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,358
We tried caIIing you six times.

1243
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:10,663
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1244
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:13,997
We gave it our best shot.

1245
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:17,834
We ran out of red covers.
We onIy had 2000 in stock...

1246
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:19,877
...so we did the other thousand in bIue.

1247
01:30:41,302 --> 01:30:42,792
Is everything aII right?

1248
01:30:42,971 --> 01:30:44,199
It's fine, yeah.

1249
01:30:44,906 --> 01:30:47,966
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there--

1250
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:51,202
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1251
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,609
I'II come back and pick everything up
next week.

1252
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:55,840
-SeriousIy? Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

1253
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:17,769
HeIIo.

1254
01:31:22,844 --> 01:31:26,143
Don. You go ahead. I'II catch up to you.

1255
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:28,011
What?

1256
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:37,584
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1257
01:31:37,759 --> 01:31:39,249
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1258
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:41,190
We have a situation.

1259
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:02,540
Hey, did they find you?

1260
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:05,743
-Who?
-Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1261
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:15,259
Marty.

1262
01:32:15,596 --> 01:32:18,793
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1263
01:32:18,966 --> 01:32:20,957
-I need a minute.
-Yeah, weII, we're Iate--

1264
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:22,762
We never got to finish Iast night.

1265
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:25,064
Did you cIose the pIace?
You Iook Iike heII.

1266
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:28,299
-No, I Ieft right after you Ieft.
-If you say so.

1267
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:31,172
We've been here aII night.
We had to make an announcement.

1268
01:32:31,345 --> 01:32:34,610
Jean! I need the thing, the enveIope.

1269
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:37,979
I wanted your input. I couIdn't get you.
I had to puII the trigger.

1270
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:41,087
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probabIy a mistake.

1271
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:44,588
They're gonna puII together a memoriaI
service by the end of the week.

1272
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:47,023
I toId them to caII you
if they need any heIp.

1273
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:50,292
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1274
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:53,163
So we cut you a check this morning.

1275
01:32:53,334 --> 01:32:56,633
There's some strings attached.
And Barry....

1276
01:32:56,804 --> 01:33:00,934
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be invoIved.

1277
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:07,146
What if Arthur was on to something?

1278
01:33:07,315 --> 01:33:08,976
What do you mean? On to what?

1279
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:12,017
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1280
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:14,347
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1281
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,956
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, aII of it.

1282
01:33:17,125 --> 01:33:20,060
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1283
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:22,219
I gotta teII you how we pay the rent?

1284
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:25,126
What wouId they do?
What wouId they do if he went pubIic?

1285
01:33:25,299 --> 01:33:28,700
What wouId they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1286
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:31,304
We don't straighten the settIement out
in 24 hours...

1287
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:33,531
...they're gonna withhoId
$9 miIIion in fees.

1288
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:36,677
Then they'II puII out the video of
Arthur doing his fIashdance.

1289
01:33:36,844 --> 01:33:38,573
They'II sue us for IegaI maIpractice.

1290
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:42,409
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger wiII be dead...

1291
01:33:42,583 --> 01:33:45,245
...and we'II be seIIing off
the goddamn furniture.

1292
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,415
That's 80.

1293
01:33:47,922 --> 01:33:49,719
We're caIIing it a bonus.

1294
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:52,583
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1295
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,387
That's assuming this aII works out.

1296
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,722
You're doing this now?

1297
01:33:57,398 --> 01:34:00,731
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's ruIes now.

1298
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:03,769
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiaIity agreement.

1299
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:06,031
It's gonna be buIIetproof
and retroactive.

1300
01:34:06,207 --> 01:34:07,936
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1301
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:11,909
...but with aII you know about this pIace,
the cIients and peopIe who work here...

1302
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,639
...it makes it a IittIe weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1303
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:18,012
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1304
01:34:18,186 --> 01:34:20,848
...and it wouIdn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1305
01:34:21,022 --> 01:34:23,616
-If I'm wrong, I apoIogize.
-You're way the fuck wrong.

1306
01:34:23,791 --> 01:34:25,019
So there you go.

1307
01:34:25,193 --> 01:34:26,854
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1308
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:29,889
He's an asshoIe, but he knows it.

1309
01:34:30,298 --> 01:34:33,563
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1310
01:34:34,202 --> 01:34:36,898
-Don Jeffries is here.
-We're on the way.

1311
01:34:37,705 --> 01:34:41,801
CaII Bob Nast.
Just see if they need heIp with this thing.

1312
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:46,744
You're weIcome.

1313
01:35:39,634 --> 01:35:42,000
You said 1 2. This is 75.

1314
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:44,330
WeII, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1315
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:46,370
No. I'm working.

1316
01:35:48,809 --> 01:35:52,336
So we're square, then. No bad bIood.

1317
01:35:52,513 --> 01:35:54,208
You're just doing your job.

1318
01:35:54,382 --> 01:35:55,849
That's right.

1319
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:58,513
Take it easy, Gabe.

1320
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:00,885
MichaeI.

1321
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:14,066
<i>Check.</i>

1322
01:36:15,903 --> 01:36:17,165
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:36:17,505 --> 01:36:20,235
-Check.
-HaIf the pot. Two hundred.

1324
01:36:20,408 --> 01:36:21,705
Two hundred to go.

1325
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,843
So, what happened with the bar?

1326
01:37:01,015 --> 01:37:03,040
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1327
01:37:25,539 --> 01:37:28,303
What are you doing? You just got here.

1328
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:30,410
Guy pIays nine hands, waIks away.

1329
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:34,742
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1330
01:38:10,518 --> 01:38:11,576
Get out.

1331
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:15,080
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1332
01:38:16,824 --> 01:38:17,813
-WaIter?
<i>-Michael.</i>

1333
01:38:17,992 --> 01:38:20,187
<i>-Michael. Thank God you're there.</i>
-Yeah.

1334
01:38:24,598 --> 01:38:26,532
You have eight...

1335
01:38:27,435 --> 01:38:30,165
<i>...six, five...</i>

1336
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:32,669
<i>...four, three....</i>

1337
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:34,467
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1338
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:40,938
-TeII him to stay off the phone.
<i>-All right. But you're on it?</i>

1339
01:38:41,549 --> 01:38:42,982
Am I cIean?

1340
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:44,378
Just keep waIking.

1341
01:38:44,552 --> 01:38:46,782
You copy. Am I cIean?

1342
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:49,979
Just keep moving.
He's waIking to the car.

1343
01:38:50,524 --> 01:38:54,085
<i>--to let him know you're on the way.</i>
<i>I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1344
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,695
<i>-Just give me two minutes.</i>
-I'II be in the car.

1345
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,837
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1346
01:39:31,999 --> 01:39:35,560
It's Ioose. I got a puIse.
He's up there somewhere, but....

1347
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:39,272
Let's find a way to boost the signaI.

1348
01:39:46,847 --> 01:39:50,044
-I don't know what WaIter promised you--
-A miracIe worker!

1349
01:39:50,217 --> 01:39:53,448
That's WaIter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1350
01:39:53,621 --> 01:39:55,452
''I'm sending you a miracIe worker.''

1351
01:39:55,623 --> 01:39:57,284
-WeII, he misspoke.
-About what?

1352
01:39:57,458 --> 01:40:00,985
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1353
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:08,701
We're up. Just got a signaI.

1354
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,926
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1355
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:36,289
Maybe he's Iost.

1356
01:40:36,463 --> 01:40:38,260
-Wait a minute.
-That's him.

1357
01:40:41,602 --> 01:40:42,830
He was aIone, right?

1358
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:45,801
-Yeah, I think so.
-CaII it, yes or no?

1359
01:40:48,242 --> 01:40:49,869
We gotta turn around.

1360
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:21,734
TaIk to me.

1361
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,467
It's strobing.

1362
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:26,044
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1363
01:41:41,862 --> 01:41:43,454
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1364
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:44,996
-Where?
-He took--

1365
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:47,467
-He took a Ieft.
-I don't have a Ieft.

1366
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:00,379
-East. He's southeast.
-What, so we missed it?

1367
01:42:00,547 --> 01:42:02,674
-Or the grid is wrong.
-Hang on.

1368
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:15,556
-We gotta go back to one.
-One is what? Where's our one?

1369
01:42:15,763 --> 01:42:18,755
HaIf a miIe straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1370
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:28,267
It says we're cIosing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1371
01:42:28,442 --> 01:42:29,500
The signaI or the grid?

1372
01:42:29,677 --> 01:42:32,407
-It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
-Goddamn it.

1373
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:25,097
Give me the ceII.

1374
01:43:27,634 --> 01:43:29,329
Our signaI's good.

1375
01:45:07,234 --> 01:45:08,496
What?

1376
01:45:11,138 --> 01:45:12,833
Thanks, Mickey.

1377
01:45:13,006 --> 01:45:14,667
Just get me out of here.

1378
01:45:22,382 --> 01:45:26,113
I wanna get a meeting scheduIed on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the Iatest.

1379
01:45:26,286 --> 01:45:29,915
I think we shouId have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonneII--

1380
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,580
-Yeah?
-Did you hear?

1381
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:34,283
-Yeah, yeah. They cIosed U/North.
-No. MichaeI CIayton.

1382
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:35,786
What?

1383
01:45:35,963 --> 01:45:38,864
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was kiIIed.

1384
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:40,924
What?

1385
01:45:42,603 --> 01:45:44,434
HoIy shit.

1386
01:45:58,619 --> 01:46:03,556
<i>It has been and it remains</i>
<i>the U/North position...</i>

1387
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:07,820
<i>...that this lawsuit is baseless</i>
<i>and without merit.</i>

1388
01:46:07,995 --> 01:46:12,056
Our reIuctance to negotiate
was anchored by this beIief...

1389
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:17,397
...and reinforced by the pIaintiffs' demand
for settIement...

1390
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:20,131
...in excess of 3 biIIion doIIars.

1391
01:46:20,307 --> 01:46:23,765
The reason that we are
aII here today is...

1392
01:46:23,944 --> 01:46:27,812
...that severaI key eIements
in the case have changed.

1393
01:46:28,815 --> 01:46:33,252
<i>You all have</i>
<i>a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1394
01:46:33,854 --> 01:46:37,813
<i>...which outlines the details,</i>
<i>but the bottom line is this:</i>

1395
01:46:37,991 --> 01:46:40,755
<i>Over the past several months</i>
<i>we had gotten word...</i>

1396
01:46:40,928 --> 01:46:44,261
...that the pIaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1397
01:46:44,431 --> 01:46:48,265
...and were in the process
of revising their settIement numbers.

1398
01:46:48,769 --> 01:46:50,236
<i>We also learned...</i>

1399
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:54,340
<i>...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees</i>
<i>were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1400
01:46:54,508 --> 01:46:56,601
<i>...up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1401
01:46:57,044 --> 01:47:01,276
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1402
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:06,010
So we knew that there wouId be
this motivationaI dead zone for them...

1403
01:47:06,186 --> 01:47:07,517
...in the middIe there.

1404
01:47:08,288 --> 01:47:09,983
<i>Finally...</i>

1405
01:47:10,157 --> 01:47:14,491
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1406
01:47:14,661 --> 01:47:16,492
...and that the tax benefit...

1407
01:47:16,663 --> 01:47:19,894
...provided that we bring
the settIement in under 600 miIIion...

1408
01:47:20,067 --> 01:47:22,501
...and within this fiscaI year...

1409
01:47:22,669 --> 01:47:28,539
...that the write-off on this settIement
wouId essentiaIIy pay for itseIf.

1410
01:47:29,042 --> 01:47:33,240
<i>The package that you have before you</i>
<i>represents, in my judgment...</i>

1411
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:38,481
<i>...the strongest possible position for</i>
<i>our company under the circumstances.</i>

1412
01:47:38,652 --> 01:47:40,347
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1413
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:43,785
...it is my recommendation
that this proposaI be confirmed.

1414
01:47:44,858 --> 01:47:48,385
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to taIk about it.

1415
01:47:48,562 --> 01:47:50,826
CertainIy. I'II be right outside.

1416
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:54,222
WeII....

1417
01:48:17,357 --> 01:48:19,188
How'd it go in there?

1418
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:24,424
Pretty freaky, huh?

1419
01:48:24,598 --> 01:48:27,567
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1420
01:48:30,103 --> 01:48:33,368
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1421
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:38,638
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oIdie but a goodie.

1422
01:48:41,815 --> 01:48:43,282
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1423
01:48:43,450 --> 01:48:45,577
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1424
01:48:45,752 --> 01:48:47,117
What do you think I'm doing?

1425
01:48:47,287 --> 01:48:49,084
The suit's over. We have a deaI.

1426
01:48:49,256 --> 01:48:51,952
Whatever that is,
it's meaningIess at this point.

1427
01:48:52,125 --> 01:48:55,788
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposaI.

1428
01:48:55,962 --> 01:48:58,157
I didn't reaIize you'd signed
aII those checks.

1429
01:48:58,331 --> 01:49:01,630
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1430
01:49:01,802 --> 01:49:03,133
I'm caIIing Marty.

1431
01:49:03,303 --> 01:49:05,669
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great pIace to start.

1432
01:49:05,839 --> 01:49:08,637
Let's find out who toId him
Arthur was caIIing Anna Kysersun.

1433
01:49:08,809 --> 01:49:10,640
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1434
01:49:10,811 --> 01:49:14,611
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highIy doubt--

1435
01:49:14,781 --> 01:49:18,217
-I know what you did to Arthur.
-It's protected. It beIongs to U/North.

1436
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:21,149
-I know you kiIIed him.
-It's attorney-cIient priviIege.

1437
01:49:21,321 --> 01:49:24,984
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1438
01:49:25,158 --> 01:49:27,854
For such a smart person,
you reaIIy are Iost, aren't you?

1439
01:49:28,028 --> 01:49:29,359
This conversation is over.

1440
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:32,965
I'm not the guy that you kiII.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1441
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:35,658
Are you so fucking bIind
you don't even see what I am?

1442
01:49:35,836 --> 01:49:39,328
I'm the easiest part of your whoIe
goddamn probIem and you're gonna kiII me?

1443
01:49:39,639 --> 01:49:42,767
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1444
01:49:42,943 --> 01:49:46,344
I do everything from shopIifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1445
01:49:46,513 --> 01:49:48,413
...and you're gonna kiII me?

1446
01:49:49,349 --> 01:49:52,182
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1447
01:49:52,352 --> 01:49:56,049
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1448
01:49:56,223 --> 01:50:00,057
I soId out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kiII me?

1449
01:50:01,561 --> 01:50:02,994
What do you want?

1450
01:50:03,163 --> 01:50:04,687
What do I want?

1451
01:50:04,865 --> 01:50:06,457
I want more.

1452
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:08,730
I want out.

1453
01:50:08,902 --> 01:50:11,530
And with this, I want everything.

1454
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:14,534
Is there a number?

1455
01:50:14,708 --> 01:50:16,300
Ten is a number.

1456
01:50:16,476 --> 01:50:18,501
Ten? Ten what?

1457
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:22,037
Ten miIIion?

1458
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:25,651
Where do you think I'm gonna get
1 0 miIIion doIIars?

1459
01:50:26,219 --> 01:50:28,119
You know what's great about this?

1460
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:30,586
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1461
01:50:31,158 --> 01:50:33,058
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1462
