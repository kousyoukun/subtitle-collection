1
00:00:19,503 --> 00:00:20,902
<i>Michael.</i>

2
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,006
<i>Dear Michael. Of course it's you.</i>
<i>Who else could they send?</i>

3
00:00:24,173 --> 00:00:25,505
<i>Who else could be trusted?</i>

4
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,405
<i>And I know it's a long way</i>
<i>and you're ready to go to work.</i>

5
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:31,878
<i>All I'm saying is wait, just wait, just--</i>
<i>Just please hear me out.</i>

6
00:00:32,048 --> 00:00:35,246
<i>Because this is not an episode,</i>
<i>relapse, fuckup.</i>

7
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:37,978
<i>I'm begging you, Michael,</i>
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

8
00:00:38,155 --> 00:00:40,987
<i>Try and make believe</i>
<i>this is not just madness...</i>

9
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:44,183
<i>...because this is not just madness.</i>

10
00:00:44,527 --> 00:00:46,792
<i>Two weeks ago,</i>
<i>I came out of the building, okay?</i>

11
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,489
<i>I'm running across 6th Avenue,</i>
<i>there's a car waiting...</i>

12
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:52,862
<i>...I got exactly 38 minutes to get</i>
<i>to the airport, and I'm dictating.</i>

13
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:55,799
<i>There's this panicked associate</i>
<i>sprinting along beside me...</i>

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,498
<i>...scribbling in a notepad,</i>
<i>and she starts screaming.</i>

15
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:01,609
<i>And I realize we're standing</i>
<i>in the middle of the street...</i>

16
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:05,771
<i>...the light's changed and there's this wall</i>
<i>of serious traffic speeding towards us.</i>

17
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:07,974
<i>And I freeze. I can't move.</i>

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,778
<i>I'm suddenly consumed</i>
<i>with the overwhelming sensation...</i>

19
00:01:10,953 --> 00:01:12,978
<i>...that I'm covered</i>
<i>with some sort of film.</i>

20
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:17,751
<i>And it's in my hair, in my face.</i>
<i>And it's like a glaze, like a coating.</i>

21
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:20,691
<i>And at first I thought,</i>
<i>''Oh, my God, I know what this is.</i>

22
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,298
<i>This is some sort of amniotic,</i>
<i>embryonic fluid.</i>

23
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,162
<i>I'm drenched in afterbirth.</i>

24
00:01:25,334 --> 00:01:27,996
<i>I've breached the chrysalis.</i>
<i>I've been reborn. ''</i>

25
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,469
<i>But then, the traffic, the stampede,</i>
<i>the cars, the trucks, the horns...</i>

26
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:35,668
<i>...this poor woman screaming,</i>
<i>and I'm thinking, ''No. This is not rebirth.</i>

27
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,712
<i>This is some kind of giddy illusion</i>
<i>of renewal...</i>

28
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,646
<i>...that happens in</i>
<i>the final moment before death. ''</i>

29
00:01:41,817 --> 00:01:45,412
<i>And then I realize,</i>
<i>''No, no, no, this is completely wrong''...</i>

30
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:48,558
<i>...because I looked back</i>
<i>at the building...</i>

31
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:51,352
<i>...and I had the most stunning</i>
<i>moment of clarity.</i>

32
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,621
<i>I realized, Michael...</i>

33
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:57,824
<i>...that I had emerged, not through</i>
<i>the doors of Kenner, Bach & Ledeen...</i>

34
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,300
<i>...not through the portals</i>
<i>of our vast and powerful law firm...</i>

35
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,269
<i>...but from the asshole of an organism...</i>

36
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:09,070
<i>...whose sole function is</i>
<i>to excrete the poison...</i>

37
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:12,612
<i>...the ammo, the defoliant necessary</i>
<i>for other larger...</i>

38
00:02:12,782 --> 00:02:16,343
<i>...more powerful organisms</i>
<i>to destroy the miracle of humanity.</i>

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,388
<i>And that I had been coated</i>
<i>in this patina of shit...</i>

40
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,752
<i>...for the best part of my life.</i>

41
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:26,759
<i>And the stench of it, the stain of it</i>
<i>would take the rest of my life to undo.</i>

42
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,192
<i>And you know what I did?</i>

43
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:32,096
<i>I took a deep, cleansing breath</i>
<i>and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

44
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:36,671
<i>I said to myself, ''As clear as this may be,</i>
<i>as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

45
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,038
<i>...as true a thing as I believe</i>
<i>that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

46
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,679
<i>It must stand the test of time. ''</i>

47
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,872
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

48
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,354
I'm not sure what eIse I can teII you
that I haven't aIready.

49
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:55,046
<i>Tell me about U/North, Barry.</i>
<i>They're your clients.</i>

50
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:59,456
<i>So you tell me why you're settling</i>
<i>a six-year-old case on the fly at midnight.</i>

51
00:02:59,628 --> 00:03:02,324
<i>Because I'm writing this story</i>
<i>whether you like it or not.</i>

52
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:03,830
What does that exactIy mean?

53
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,401
<i>Give me something I can print.</i>

54
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:15,173
We found 97.

55
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:24,879
I've got that cunt from
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> on my ceII phone.

56
00:03:25,055 --> 00:03:27,216
She wiII not go away.

57
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,183
Marty Bach. How can I heIp you?

58
00:03:32,361 --> 00:03:35,455
<i>Marty, hi. It's Bridget Klein.</i>
<i>We're going with a story tomorrow...</i>

59
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,862
<i>...about a settlement in the U/North</i>
<i>defoliant case. You wanna comment?</i>

60
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:42,402
Case you're referring to is now,
as it has been for the past six years...

61
00:03:42,572 --> 00:03:44,437
...pending and unresoIved.

62
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:47,201
TiII such time as our cIient
has their day in court...

63
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,868
...or the pIaintiffs drop the suit,
I'II have nothing of vaIue to teII you.

64
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:54,108
<i>Come on, Marty, you're closing</i>
<i>the U/North case. You're settling.</i>

65
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:58,743
<i>I know that. I know you're up there with</i>
<i>600 people jamming this thing through.</i>

66
00:03:58,921 --> 00:04:01,355
Here's what I know.
Your deadIine was 20 minutes ago.

67
00:04:01,524 --> 00:04:05,016
So you're fishing for a story or
trying to get out of writing a retraction.

68
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:07,685
In either case,
I wish you the best of Iuck.

69
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:10,824
Where the fuck is Karen Crowder?

70
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,305
I'II see the turn.

71
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:08,848
Check.

72
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,622
Check.

73
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,360
Check.

74
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,521
HaIf the pot. Two hundred.

75
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:17,394
Two hundred to go.

76
00:05:28,512 --> 00:05:29,774
You don't remember me, huh?

77
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,274
We pIayed together a coupIe times.

78
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:35,543
That Iamp pIace on Bowery.

79
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:38,380
That guy's showroom?
AII the Iamps and shit?

80
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:40,956
-The GaIaxy.
-That's it.

81
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:44,321
You had a restaurant
you were opening, right?

82
00:05:44,494 --> 00:05:47,725
My oId partner bid that job,
the pIumbing.

83
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,298
-You don't remember me?
-I remember you.

84
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,732
Because I Iost a Iot of weight since then.

85
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,233
You bought some hair too.

86
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,704
With your money.

87
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,973
So, what happened with the bar?

88
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,908
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

89
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,244
Shit, man. I want to Iisten to Larry King,
I go home and put the fucking TV on.

90
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:10,886
That was a good Iocation.

91
00:06:11,053 --> 00:06:13,887
Yeah, that's what my partner
kept teIIing me.

92
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:15,857
Action's on you.

93
00:06:16,492 --> 00:06:18,255
I bet the pot.

94
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,827
Good to see you again.

95
00:06:55,632 --> 00:06:56,620
HeIIo?

96
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,062
<i>-Michael.</i>
-WaIter.

97
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:01,466
<i>Michael, thank God, there you are.</i>
<i>Look, I got a situation.</i>

98
00:07:01,637 --> 00:07:05,733
<i>A big problem, all right? A client of mine,</i>
<i>he just called, he hit a guy with his car.</i>

99
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:07,809
<i>He thinks he did. He thinks he hit him.</i>

100
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:08,966
Just now?

101
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,807
<i>Yeah, just now. Ten, 1 5 minutes ago.</i>
<i>He's driving home.</i>

102
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:14,040
<i>He's home now. He's there waiting.</i>

103
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,377
Where?

104
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:19,386
<i>Westchester. I'm down here in Bermuda.</i>
<i>He just got me up. I'm half asleep here.</i>

105
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:20,579
Is he drunk?

106
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:23,624
<i>No. It's the first thing I asked him.</i>
<i>He's good, he's sober.</i>

107
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:25,283
TeII him to stay off the phone.

108
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,725
<i>All right. But you're on it?</i>
<i>You can get up there?</i>

109
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,660
<i>Because this guy, he's a huge client.</i>

110
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:32,394
<i>This is half my book, this guy, okay?</i>

111
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:34,002
I'm waIking to the car now.

112
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,536
<i>Okay. Look, look, let me call him right back</i>
<i>and I'll get the address.</i>

113
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:41,302
<i>Just let me know you're on the way,</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

114
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:42,911
AII right. I'II be in the car.

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,264
<i>What they did, see,</i>
<i>they changed the grade there.</i>

116
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,232
They widened the street.

117
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:44,304
I'm sure somebody toId them
that that was an improvement.

118
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:48,967
But now, you see, when it rains and when
there is fog, and with this new angIe...

119
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:52,740
...and they've got these new--
These-- These--

120
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,009
These sodium Iamps, it's bIinding.

121
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:58,450
-That corner there. It is bIinding.
-They'II have to work that out.

122
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,453
And it's not just tonight.
I've been saying this for years.

123
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:06,254
I mean, how many times have we taIked
about that corner? DeII?

124
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,692
Mr. Greer, we don't have
a Iot of time here.

125
00:09:08,865 --> 00:09:13,802
So the circumstances, the road conditions,
none of this hoIds any interest for you?

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,870
What interests me is finding
the strongest criminaI attorney...

127
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,631
...that can be here in 1 5 minutes.

128
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,042
WeII, that sounds ominous.

129
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:24,772
We have some good reIationships
up here in Westchester.

130
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:27,883
So, what are you? What are you?
You're not a Iawyer?

131
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,847
-Not the kind you need.
-What kind is that?

132
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:31,008
A triaI Iawyer.

133
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:34,049
Somebody who can see this through.
That's not what I do.

134
00:09:34,224 --> 00:09:37,784
Okay. I think we're gonna have to
puII WaIter back in on this.

135
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:40,952
I wanna get WaIter back on the phone,
get him back into the mix.

136
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,861
Because, I'II be frank with you,
I don't Iike the way this is going.

137
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:48,697
Sir, we don't have time for WaIter.
Your options are gonna get smaIIer quickIy.

138
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,931
What options?
I'm not hearing any options!

139
00:09:51,106 --> 00:09:52,335
I suggest you go IocaI...

140
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,375
...and I'm teIIing you there are
peopIe here I Iike for this.

141
00:09:55,544 --> 00:09:57,604
Great. That's it?
That's what you got for me?

142
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,806
Hey, you beIieve this?

143
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:02,280
I have been a cIient at Kenner, Bach
for 1 2 years!

144
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:06,182
You think I paid that retainer every month
for a pIace at the back of the Iine?

145
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:09,654
Mr. Greer, you Ieft the scene of an accident
on a sIow weeknight...

146
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:12,020
...six miIes from
the state poIice barracks.

147
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,424
If there's a Iine,
you're right up front.

148
00:10:14,596 --> 00:10:17,464
I can get a Iawyer any time I want.
I don't need you for that.

149
00:10:17,634 --> 00:10:21,535
We're not sitting here for 45 minutes
waiting for a goddamn referraI!

150
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:23,466
I don't know what WaIter
promised you--

151
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,097
A miracIe worker! That's WaIter
on the phone, 20 minutes ago.

152
00:10:27,277 --> 00:10:30,370
Direct quote, okay? ''Hang tight.
I'm sending you a miracIe worker.''

153
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,173
-WeII, he misspoke.
-About what?

154
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:34,942
That you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're good at it?

155
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:36,585
EIIiot.

156
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:40,046
The guy was running! In the street!

157
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:44,956
You take that, you add the fog,
you add the Iamps, you add the angIe....

158
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:49,955
What the fuck is he doing running in
the middIe of the street at midnight?!

159
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,327
You answer me that!

160
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:08,048
What if someone had stoIen the car?

161
00:11:11,153 --> 00:11:12,381
Happens aII the time.

162
00:11:12,554 --> 00:11:14,648
Cops Iike hit-and-runs.

163
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:16,849
They work them hard,
they cIear them fast.

164
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:20,222
Right now there's a B.C.I. unit
puIIing paint chips off a guard raiI.

165
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:23,729
Tomorrow, they're gonna be Iooking
for the owner of a custom-painted...

166
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:26,129
...hand-rubbed Jaguar XJ-1 2.

167
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:27,894
And the guy you hit?

168
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:31,437
If he got a Iook at the pIates,
it won't even take that Iong.

169
00:11:34,644 --> 00:11:36,373
There's no pIay here.

170
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:39,511
There's no angIe.
There's no champagne room.

171
00:11:39,682 --> 00:11:42,344
I'm not a miracIe worker, I'm a janitor.

172
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,576
The math on this is simpIe.

173
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:47,745
The smaIIer the mess,
the easier it is for me to cIean up.

174
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:53,022
That's the poIice, isn't it?

175
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,595
No.

176
00:11:55,431 --> 00:11:57,091
They don't caII.

177
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:03,202
HeIIo.

178
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,572
Jerry, it's MichaeI CIayton.

179
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:09,211
Yeah, Iook, I'm sorry to wake you up.

180
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:12,275
No. I'm in the neighborhood.

181
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,513
You got a pen?

182
00:15:57,005 --> 00:15:59,099
Mom, where's my cards?

183
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:05,977
Where's my cards?

184
00:16:20,196 --> 00:16:21,527
Is my other deck in here?

185
00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:23,096
Did you eat?

186
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:25,166
Dad's down there waiting aIready.

187
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,198
There were cards in our bathroom.

188
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,631
Yes, I had a waffIe.

189
00:16:28,804 --> 00:16:31,672
Since we're out of waffIes,
I don't see how that's possibIe.

190
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,172
It's a miracIe.

191
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,470
GIoves?

192
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:46,277
Henry!

193
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:52,459
Come on.

194
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:55,794
Get in.

195
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,397
Got it?

196
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,800
<i>So no one's even sure</i>
<i>exactly where they are...</i>

197
00:17:07,977 --> 00:17:11,140
...because there's no borders
or Iandmarks or anything.

198
00:17:11,314 --> 00:17:14,044
And the town?
It's not even a town reaIIy.

199
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:17,413
It just is this camp where aII these peopIe
have gathered to hide.

200
00:17:17,586 --> 00:17:18,576
Right.

201
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:22,211
AII these deserters and guys
that got cut off from their armies.

202
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,554
AII these peopIe that are hiding
in the woods, trying to stay aIive.

203
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,627
This is where they aII came.

204
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,788
There's Thieves, Gray Mages,
Unbidden Warriors...

205
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,991
...Dark Avians,
Riverwynders and Sappers.

206
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:36,332
-There's, Iike, 1 5 different characters, okay?
-Okay.

207
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,535
And nobody has any aIIiances.

208
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,972
You can't even say who you are
because, you don't know...

209
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,134
...maybe the person you're taIking to...

210
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,804
...maybe they're Iike your mortaI enemy
in the wars.

211
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,679
So it's just compIeteIy Iike
everybody for themseIves.

212
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,182
Sounds famiIiar.

213
00:17:51,354 --> 00:17:54,288
It's reaIIy good.
I'm serious, you shouId reaIIy read it.

214
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:57,619
Right. But by the time I finish it,
you'II be on to something eIse.

215
00:17:57,792 --> 00:18:00,557
-How much you wanna bet?
-I don't know. How much you got?

216
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:03,560
-You got your bus pass?
-It's in my Iocker.

217
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,599
You're not even gonna Iook at it,
are you?

218
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:08,201
-The book?
-Yes.

219
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,769
Bring it on Saturday, I'II....

220
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:13,170
I did aIready. I Ieft it in your kitchen.
It's got a red cover.

221
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,468
Okay.

222
00:18:14,644 --> 00:18:17,044
WeII, here we go.

223
00:18:17,212 --> 00:18:19,909
Go. Teach these peopIe something,
wouId you?

224
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,545
-See you Iater, Dad.
-Yeah, kiddo.

225
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,090
Thanks.

226
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,892
<i>Lot 52, lot of assorted mixing bowls,</i>
<i>assorted sizes.</i>

227
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:43,038
<i>Thirty dollars to start. Thirty dollars.</i>
<i>Thirty dollars I have.</i>

228
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:46,298
You can get me to 40. I got 40. And 50.
Sixty doIIars back there.

229
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,704
Sixty doIIars, get me to 70.
I got 70 doIIars.

230
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,403
Seventy doIIars, I have now, 70.
Eighty doIIars there.

231
00:18:51,579 --> 00:18:53,980
Eighty doIIars, this gentIeman here.
Eighty doIIars.

232
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,880
Ninety doIIars there. Give me 1 00.
One hundred I have now.

233
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:10,795
He says you're stiII gonna be short.

234
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,692
How short?

235
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:18,270
Sixty. PIus the points, 75 thousand.

236
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,500
-That's Iiquor and everything?
-What'd you think it was gonna be?

237
00:19:21,676 --> 00:19:24,669
I don't know. Less. Thirty. Twenty.

238
00:19:24,846 --> 00:19:28,714
He took 1 500 on a refrigerator
I paid four grand for.

239
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:30,510
Make a bid.

240
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:34,744
Are you teIIing me you don't have
the 75 thousand?

241
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,982
Just Iying around, no.

242
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,586
We both know it's your brother
I shouId be taIking to.

243
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,788
Forget that.

244
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:47,265
MichaeI, Iook, you wanna front this,
that's up to you.

245
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:50,666
But Timmy's name stays in the book
tiII we're cIear.

246
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,440
If I know where he is,
I don't have to keep asking.

247
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,307
He's upstate. His wife took him back.
I don't know where he is.

248
00:19:59,481 --> 00:20:01,278
He's gotta have something.

249
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,940
He's got the two kids with her.

250
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,781
He's got Jennifer, the coke-deaIing waitress
that he knocked up.

251
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:11,619
He's got four MicheIin radiaIs
that he stoIe from my sister's garage.

252
00:20:12,928 --> 00:20:14,691
Make an offer.

253
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:21,500
I had a wife who was a drunk.
She was a beautifuI girI, young girI.

254
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,231
But Iive Iike that? Even they do a program--
She did, I think, once, two years.

255
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,400
And then they sIip? Forget it.

256
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,942
It's Iike you're strapped to a bomb.

257
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,107
What's my timeframe here?

258
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,441
I don't know.

259
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,609
I didn't think it'd be a probIem.

260
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:41,746
I'II ask.

261
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,480
-Hey, MichaeI.
-Morning, CarI.

262
00:21:19,728 --> 00:21:22,992
I don't know. DeI, I don't know
how hard you want me to press here.

263
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:25,155
Let me know how brave he wants to be.

264
00:21:25,334 --> 00:21:27,665
<i>Well, I'm not sure how brave</i>
<i>he can be right now.</i>

265
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:30,169
<i>We just got a confirmation hearing</i>
<i>scheduled.</i>

266
00:21:30,338 --> 00:21:31,738
Any chance she knows that?

267
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:35,536
<i>Well, it was in the paper. Who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe she got someone to read it to her.</i>

268
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,236
<i>She called his wife yesterday.</i>
<i>She's calling his house.</i>

269
00:21:38,413 --> 00:21:39,642
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>

270
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,942
WeII, my guess is
she's gonna want the condo.

271
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,175
<i>Come on, that's insane.</i>

272
00:21:43,352 --> 00:21:46,878
WeII, what can I teII you?
Don't piss off a motivated stripper.

273
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,250
<i>It's just unbelievable.</i>

274
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:51,689
AII right. WeII, find out his pain threshoId
and get back to me.

275
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:53,760
Or you can teII him to caII me directIy.

276
00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:55,920
<i>All right, I hear you. Let me get into it.</i>

277
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:57,258
Thanks.

278
00:21:57,432 --> 00:21:59,059
Hey, where are we with Marty?

279
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,558
We Ieft word.

280
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,897
HoId on. Go back. How oId is the kid?

281
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,064
<i>He's not a kid. He's 22.</i>

282
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:07,903
-This is Miami?
<i>-Nope. Key Biscayne.</i>

283
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,567
And they charged him.

284
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:13,044
<i>Reckless endangerment. My client....</i>

285
00:22:13,214 --> 00:22:18,653
<i>I think really what they want, they want</i>
<i>a reality check on the attorney down there.</i>

286
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,880
-Yeah.
<i>-Wayne said you have some connections?</i>

287
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,580
-Yeah, Iet me get a pen.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

288
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:27,385
Now, if she caIIs the INS directIy,
she's gonna get nowhere.

289
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:28,790
<i>Even with the appointment?</i>

290
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:31,454
It's retaiI, Evan.
It's Iike the DMV over there.

291
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:34,967
UnIess they get a caII from
a district supervisor, then nobody moves.

292
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,694
<i>But your guy can do that?</i>

293
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:38,202
He's a former commissioner.

294
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:41,308
<i>None of this comes back to me?</i>
<i>Because that doesn't do any good.</i>

295
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:43,569
No, Iook, I'm gonna be
the one that's asking.

296
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:46,077
<i>-Can you hang on a minute?</i>
-Yeah, sure.

297
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:49,180
Are we merging?

298
00:22:50,152 --> 00:22:51,846
Marty Bach's in London.

299
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,115
They said he was in AtIanta,
then Lara said he was in the buiIding.

300
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,417
So I caIIed back.
I know you want this meeting.

301
00:22:57,593 --> 00:23:00,153
Now she teIIs me the truth.
He's reaIIy in London.

302
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,526
So are we merging?
I mean, that's what everyone's saying.

303
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,826
AII these Brits?
That this time it's for reaI.

304
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,798
Like I wouId know.

305
00:23:08,436 --> 00:23:09,664
I don't know.

306
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:13,500
But even if we are, I mean, even if
they merged, it wouIdn't affect us, right?

307
00:23:14,276 --> 00:23:15,936
Your phone's ringing.

308
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,278
Evan?

309
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:21,811
Hey. Okay, here's what I'II do.

310
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,952
Let me give him a caII
and set up a meeting for next week.

311
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:27,519
I'II waIk her in,
I'II make the introduction....

312
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:31,250
<i>At the moment,</i>
<i>U/North currently has 7 0,000 employees...</i>

313
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:34,452
<i>...in 62 countries around the world.</i>

314
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,657
<i>Around the planet.</i>

315
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,531
<i>Operating in 62 countries</i>
<i>around the planet.</i>

316
00:23:43,638 --> 00:23:48,372
At work in more than 60 countries
around the gIobe.

317
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:54,214
We have-- We have, right now--
We have--

318
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:57,614
At U/North right now,
we've got 75,000 empIoyees...

319
00:23:57,786 --> 00:24:00,549
...in over 60 countries around the pIanet.

320
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,487
We are a very successfuI
and highIy diversified company...

321
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,387
...so you can imagine...

322
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,997
...the voIume and the variety
of IegaI issues we have to deaI with is--

323
00:24:09,163 --> 00:24:10,631
OverwheIming.

324
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,034
It's just enormous.

325
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,835
So you can imagine,
the voIume of IegaI issues....

326
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:21,404
It's quite substantiaI.

327
00:24:21,576 --> 00:24:24,171
<i>And as general counsel, what I do...</i>

328
00:24:24,346 --> 00:24:26,540
...what our in-house department does...

329
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:31,981
...is to anaIyze the dimension
of the probIem or the opportunity...

330
00:24:32,153 --> 00:24:34,486
...to determine the jurisdiction...

331
00:24:34,656 --> 00:24:36,886
...and to outsource our business...

332
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:40,517
...to those firms and taIents
that we think can heIp us the most.

333
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:43,557
<i>So with all that pressure and workload...</i>

334
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:47,065
<i>...how do you keep a balance</i>
<i>between work and life?</i>

335
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,702
<i>Balance?</i>

336
00:24:51,272 --> 00:24:54,538
I think that's.... That's something that...

337
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,042
...you search for your whoIe Iife, isn't it?

338
00:24:58,212 --> 00:25:01,010
It's a shifting baIance, reaIIy.

339
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:04,346
It's, you know, you.... You try to....

340
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,818
<i>When you really are enjoying</i>
<i>what it is you do...</i>

341
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,855
...who needs baIance?

342
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:13,450
There's your baIance.
There's your baIance.

343
00:25:13,628 --> 00:25:17,587
When you're reaIIy enjoying
what it is you do, there is your baIance.

344
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,926
When Don asked me to take--

345
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:22,569
When Don Jeffries brought--
Don Jeffries brought me--

346
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:25,707
Don Jeffries brought me in here
1 2 years ago...

347
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:28,968
...trusted me, mentored me.

348
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:32,113
WeIcomed me into the U/North famiIy.

349
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:36,615
And when he moved up to the boardroom,
I never reaIIy...

350
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:40,945
...dreamt that I wouId have
the opportunity to move into his position.

351
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:43,886
But, is it chaIIenging? Yes.

352
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:49,724
And I think that it's possibIe that those
first few months were a IittIe shaky.

353
00:25:49,897 --> 00:25:54,994
But then you reaIize that you've been
taught to be ready, and you take the heIm.

354
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:59,163
Because if you're not comfortabIe
with that IeveI of responsibiIity...

355
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,172
...you're in the wrong pIace.

356
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:06,440
It's your department, your capacity to
make tough decisions in reaI time, and--

357
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:09,045
We're in the middIe of an interview.

358
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:11,185
They said it was urgent.

359
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:14,654
Jesus.

360
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,153
For chrissake.

361
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:20,592
You're saying he did this in--?

362
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:21,820
Oh, my God.

363
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,659
-Barry.
-Hang on.

364
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:30,298
Arthur Edens just stripped down naked
in a deposition room in MiIwaukee.

365
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:33,637
<i>Oh, Michael...</i>

366
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:37,471
<i>...I took a deep, cleansing breath</i>
<i>and I set that notion aside. I tabled it.</i>

367
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:42,446
<i>I said to myself, ''As clear as this may be,</i>
<i>as potent a feeling as this is...</i>

368
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:46,384
<i>...as true a thing as I believe</i>
<i>that I have witnessed today, it must wait.</i>

369
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:49,547
<i>It must stand the test of time. ''</i>

370
00:26:49,724 --> 00:26:52,489
<i>And, Michael, the time is now.</i>

371
00:26:52,661 --> 00:26:56,118
<i>This moment, today,</i>
<i>here, this room, this air...</i>

372
00:26:56,298 --> 00:27:00,701
<i>...and this, especially this, Michael,</i>
<i>that you're here.</i>

373
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,665
<i>There's a reason.</i>

374
00:27:02,837 --> 00:27:04,532
<i>A reason it's you, Michael.</i>

375
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:09,200
<i>Surely, you have some sense of that,</i>
<i>how it pulls together, how it gathers.</i>

376
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:13,108
<i>Nurse Michael, the secret hero,</i>
<i>the keeper of the hidden sins.</i>

377
00:27:13,281 --> 00:27:15,546
<i>Tell me you can see that, Michael,</i>
<i>for God's sake.</i>

378
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,852
But, I mean, yeah, yes, yes.
The nudity, the parking Iot, I admit it.

379
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:24,720
It was-- It was-- It was a mistake.
It was wrong. It was Iame.

380
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,987
It was obvious. And therapeuticaIIy,
it was compIeteIy useIess...

381
00:27:28,163 --> 00:27:31,529
...because I swear, I couId stand here
and tear off my fucking skin...

382
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:36,431
...and I couId not get down
to where this thing is Iiving.

383
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:40,336
Six years, MichaeI.
Six years I've absorbed this poison.

384
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:43,773
Four hundred depositions,
a hundred motions, five changes of venue...

385
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:46,380
...85,000 documents in discovery.

386
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:50,746
Six years of scheming and staIIing
and screaming, and what have I got?

387
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,378
I've spent 1 2 percent of my Iife defending
the reputation of a deadIy weed kiIIer!

388
00:27:55,557 --> 00:27:57,650
-We had an agreement, Arthur.
-One night.

389
00:27:57,826 --> 00:28:00,760
One night, right?
I Iook up and there's Marty in my office.

390
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,259
He's got some champagne.

391
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:07,198
He teIIs me we just hit 30,000 biIIabIe hours
on U/North and he wants to ceIebrate.

392
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:10,895
So an hour Iater, I find myseIf
in a whorehouse in CheIsea...

393
00:28:11,073 --> 00:28:14,473
...with two Lithuanian redheads
taking turns sucking my dick.

394
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:18,739
I'm Iaying there and I'm trying not
to come and I wanna....

395
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:21,211
I wanna make it Iast,
so I start doing the math.

396
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:24,614
I think, ''Thirty thousand hours,
what is that? That's 24 times 30.

397
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:29,883
That's 720 hours in a month,
8760 hours in a year....''

398
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:31,615
-Arthur.
-No, wait, wait, wait!

399
00:28:31,792 --> 00:28:35,125
Because it's years! It's Iives!

400
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:38,130
And the numbers are making me dizzy
and, you know...

401
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,498
...now, instead of trying not to come,
I'm trying not to think, and I can't stop.

402
00:28:42,671 --> 00:28:44,069
I mean, is this me?

403
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:48,573
Am I this freak organism that has been
sent here to sIeep and eat...

404
00:28:48,743 --> 00:28:52,942
...and defend this one horrific chain
of carcinogenic moIecuIes?

405
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:55,105
Is that my destiny? Is that my fate?

406
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,513
-Listen, you promised me.
-Is that it, MichaeI?

407
00:28:57,685 --> 00:29:00,654
Is that my graiI?
Two Lithuanian mouths on my cock?

408
00:29:00,821 --> 00:29:03,382
Is that the correct answer
to the muItipIe choice of me?

409
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,756
You wanna go off your medication,
that's fine. But you caII me first.

410
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:08,589
-That was our agreement.
-Sue me.

411
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:09,958
We okay in there?

412
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:13,663
We're fine. We're fine.

413
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:19,332
They kiIIed them, MichaeI.

414
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:22,704
Those smaII farms, the famiIy farms.

415
00:29:22,877 --> 00:29:25,403
Did you--? Did you--?
Did you meet Anna?

416
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,605
No.

417
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:29,875
You gotta see her, you gotta taIk to her.
She's a miracIe, MichaeI.

418
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:32,042
She's God's perfect IittIe creature.

419
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,655
And for 50 miIIion doIIars in fees,
I've spent 1 2 percent of my Iife...

420
00:29:35,824 --> 00:29:39,452
...destroying perfect Anna
and her dead parents and her dying brother.

421
00:29:39,627 --> 00:29:41,391
When did you Iast take one of these?

422
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:44,292
No. I'm not Iosing this.
Everything is finaIIy significant.

423
00:29:44,465 --> 00:29:46,900
The worId is a beautifuI pIace.
I'm not trading that.

424
00:29:47,068 --> 00:29:50,334
-If it's reaI, the piII won't kiII it.
-I have bIood on my hands.

425
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:53,166
You are senior Iitigating partner
of one of the Iargest...

426
00:29:53,342 --> 00:29:56,038
...most respected Iaw firms in the worId.
You are a Iegend.

427
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,542
-I'm an accompIice!
-You're a manic-depressive.

428
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,016
I am Shiva, the god of death.

429
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:05,409
Let's get out of MiIwaukee,
we'II taIk about it.

430
00:30:06,887 --> 00:30:11,551
<i>We came back from the hospital</i>
<i>and everybody was crying...</i>

431
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:15,753
<i>...and we were in shock, but we still....</i>
<i>We had to milk.</i>

432
00:30:15,931 --> 00:30:18,365
<i>The cows won't wait, will they?</i>

433
00:30:18,532 --> 00:30:19,521
<i>No.</i>

434
00:30:20,234 --> 00:30:22,726
<i>And when you went to the barn?</i>

435
00:30:22,903 --> 00:30:25,498
<i>We found the note. My sister found it.</i>

436
00:30:25,673 --> 00:30:27,903
<i>-From your mother?</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

437
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,067
<i>Could you read it for us, please?</i>

438
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:34,407
<i>Just read the third paragraph,</i>
<i>just the highlighted section there.</i>

439
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,846
<i>''I don't want you blaming Ned Hardy</i>
<i>or any of the people-- ''</i>

440
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:39,248
<i>Anna.</i>

441
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,683
<i>-Anna.</i>
<i>- ''Down at--</i>

442
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:43,518
<i>It's all right, Anna, go on.</i>

443
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:45,592
<i>-I'm just....</i>
<i>-Excuse me.</i>

444
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,854
<i>-Anna, they're....</i>
<i>-What's he doing?</i>

445
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,726
<i>Excuse me. She's a--</i>
<i>No, this is testimony. This is--</i>

446
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:52,890
<i>Excuse me, I have an objection.</i>

447
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:55,433
<i>You can be a witness here.</i>
<i>You can be a witness.</i>

448
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,298
<i>I am not a witness to this, sir, I--</i>

449
00:30:57,471 --> 00:31:00,066
<i>Anna, I love you.</i>

450
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:05,144
<i>And I'm sitting here</i>
<i>and I'm listening to you and I swear...</i>

451
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:10,079
<i>...that I love you more than anything</i>
<i>in the world. And this is my moment.</i>

452
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:14,051
<i>This strange conference-table moment.</i>

453
00:31:14,221 --> 00:31:16,122
<i>Turn off that camera!</i>

454
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:20,183
<i>-This is my offering!</i>
<i>-No, I want this on the record!</i>

455
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:21,589
<i>How do I turn it off?</i>

456
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:25,289
<i>This is my offering. My clothes are</i>
<i>my offering. This is my shame.</i>

457
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,230
<i>My credentials! I'm ashamed!</i>

458
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:31,804
<i>And I love you, and I swear to God--</i>

459
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,071
I guess that's it.

460
00:31:48,256 --> 00:31:49,553
When do we get Don?

461
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:52,682
She said to try back in haIf an hour.

462
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:55,761
And how about the fIights?
What's the story at O'Hare?

463
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,625
-CIosed four minutes ago.
-Shit.

464
00:32:01,001 --> 00:32:03,402
There is a foot of snow
in Detroit aIready.

465
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:05,836
Todd, couId I get that coffee now?

466
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:12,173
Who is this guy they sent from New York?
CIayton? I never heard of him.

467
00:32:13,981 --> 00:32:15,414
MichaeI Raymond CIayton.

468
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:20,487
<i>Born September 9, 1 959,</i>
<i>St. Joseph's Hospital, Bronx, New York.</i>

469
00:32:20,654 --> 00:32:24,352
<i>Father is NYPD patrolman</i>
<i>Raymond Xavier Clayton.</i>

470
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:27,188
<i>Mother, Alice Mary Clayton.</i>

471
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,525
<i>Graduates Washingtonville Central</i>
<i>High School, Orange County, New York...</i>

472
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,326
<i>...in 1 97 7.</i>

473
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,869
<i>Graduates St. John's University, 1 980.</i>
<i>Fordham Law, '82.</i>

474
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:42,032
<i>'82 through '86, he's ADA with</i>
<i>the Queens district attorney's office.</i>

475
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,144
<i>1 986, he's with</i>
<i>the Joint Manhattan-Queens...</i>

476
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:47,247
<i>...Organized Crime Task Force.</i>

477
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:50,816
And then in 1 990, he starts
at Kenner, Bach & Ledeen.

478
00:32:50,986 --> 00:32:52,419
So he's a partner?

479
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,811
No. He's Iisted as speciaI counseI.

480
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,016
Says he speciaIizes in wiIIs and trusts.

481
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:01,555
<i>He goes from criminal prosecution</i>
<i>to wills and trusts?</i>

482
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,096
<i>He's been there 1 7 years,</i>
<i>he's not a partner?</i>

483
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:07,929
<i>This is the guy they send?</i>
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

484
00:33:22,183 --> 00:33:24,448
-Hi.
-CIose the door.

485
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,913
AII right. So nobody, none of you,
had any idea he was coming?

486
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,355
To MiIwaukee? For a deposition?

487
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:35,086
We thought there was a settIement.
There's been some rumors.

488
00:33:35,262 --> 00:33:39,858
Okay. Look, it's very simpIe.
Arthur has a chemicaI imbaIance.

489
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:43,903
He's supposed to be taking his medication.
He's faIIen behind on that.

490
00:33:44,071 --> 00:33:46,563
He's on the mend.
He'II be fine in three or four days.

491
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,904
Now, I wanna make this crystaI cIear.
What happened here stays in this room.

492
00:33:51,078 --> 00:33:54,047
This is not a piece of information
you wanna be out in front of.

493
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:57,514
Anybody has a probIem with that,
I need to know right now.

494
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,018
AII right.

495
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,719
We're stuck here overnight.

496
00:34:02,891 --> 00:34:05,188
I'm gonna take him
home tomorrow if I can.

497
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,327
Who's in charge of
the deposition scheduIe?

498
00:34:07,494 --> 00:34:09,155
-I am.
-Where do we stand with that?

499
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:11,525
I guess it's on hoId.
We didn't know what to do.

500
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,759
Nothing is on hoId.
Keep doing what you were.

501
00:34:13,934 --> 00:34:16,199
Other side wants to taIk,
they can caII New York.

502
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:19,431
-I need his briefcase.
-Arthur's? I don't-- I didn't see it.

503
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:22,702
-He said it was in the room.
-It might be the stuff Jody grabbed.

504
00:34:23,077 --> 00:34:24,670
Find it.

505
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:34,952
So aII these peopIe, they aII start
having these dreams, okay?

506
00:34:35,123 --> 00:34:39,525
You know what a vision quest is?
You know, for, Iike, Navajos and stuff?

507
00:34:39,693 --> 00:34:42,958
<i>Yeah. I think so. Like a....</i>

508
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,195
<i>Like a special dream.</i>

509
00:34:45,367 --> 00:34:49,929
Except this is Iike a whoIe bunch of peopIe
having the same dream.

510
00:34:50,105 --> 00:34:53,505
They're aII having this dream
that they shouId go to this one pIace.

511
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,699
They don't know why or anything.

512
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:59,005
They just have this feeIing
that they have to go there.

513
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,045
<i>That they've been summoned.</i>

514
00:35:01,215 --> 00:35:02,443
That's the chapter.

515
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:05,585
SeriousIy, that's what it's caIIed:
''Summons to Conquest.''

516
00:35:05,753 --> 00:35:07,050
<i>That's the title.</i>

517
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:12,887
Yeah, but do they know? Do they know
they're aII having the same dream?

518
00:35:13,061 --> 00:35:15,028
<i>No. That's what's so cool.</i>

519
00:35:15,563 --> 00:35:17,496
They aII think it's just them.

520
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:21,726
That maybe they're, Iike, going crazy
or something, so they don't wanna admit it.

521
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:24,030
Yeah, but they're not crazy, are they?

522
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:27,697
<i>No. It's real. It's really happening.</i>

523
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:31,505
Yeah, it is happening, isn't it?

524
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:37,378
Something Iarger than themseIves
and they're not ready, are they...

525
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,349
...to hear it?

526
00:35:39,521 --> 00:35:41,420
Yeah. But Iater they wiII.

527
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:44,422
So if you're gonna read it,
I don't wanna spoiI it.

528
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:47,858
What are you doing?
Who you taIking to?

529
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:49,996
<i>I called my dad. It's a friend of his.</i>

530
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:53,429
<i>-Who?</i>
<i>-Mr. Edens. You don't know him.</i>

531
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,262
-HeIIo? HeIIo?
<i>-Henry, it's after 1 1.</i>

532
00:35:56,438 --> 00:35:58,235
<i>I gotta get off now.</i>

533
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:02,398
No. Wait, wait. The book.
I need the book. The titIe.

534
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:05,240
The book is <i>Realm and Conquest.</i>

535
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,175
ReaIm and Conquest.

536
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:10,409
-It's Book One, with the red cover.
-Henry, give me the phone.

537
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,144
I gotta go. TeII my dad I caIIed. Okay?

538
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:18,425
Yeah. Yeah. Thank-- Thank-- Thank--
Thank you, Henry, thank you.

539
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,065
<i>Realm and Conquest.</i> Thank you.

540
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:51,315
Karen? Hi, I'm MichaeI CIayton.

541
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:52,960
-You're Iate.
-I know.

542
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:55,652
I'm sorry, it was more compIicated
than we thought.

543
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:57,525
Where is he?
We've been here since 5:30.

544
00:36:57,699 --> 00:36:59,860
-He's asIeep.
-WeII, wake him up.

545
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:02,298
That's not gonna happen.
We just got him sedated.

546
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,829
Once he gets back
on his reguIar medication...

547
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:07,940
...then it's just a matter of time.

548
00:37:08,108 --> 00:37:10,873
-Have you seen the video? The tape?
-I heard about it.

549
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,614
What happened after is worse.

550
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:17,684
This is in the parking Iot, okay?
PeopIe running for their cars.

551
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,978
He's there in his socks, nothing eIse.

552
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:23,818
''I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I wiII not sit with this sickness any Ionger.

553
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,789
I cannot aid this sickness any Ionger.''

554
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,552
What does this mean?

555
00:37:28,963 --> 00:37:30,521
I'm not sure.

556
00:37:30,697 --> 00:37:33,326
You've been with him the whoIe evening.
What's he saying?

557
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,297
He wasn't reaIIy making much sense.

558
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,027
This is totaIIy unacceptabIe.

559
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:40,139
This is a 3-biIIion-doIIar
cIass-action Iawsuit.

560
00:37:40,307 --> 00:37:42,242
In the morning, I have to caII my board.

561
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:46,972
I have to teII them that the architect
of our entire defense has been arrested...

562
00:37:47,148 --> 00:37:51,311
...for running naked in a snowstorm,
chasing the pIaintiffs through a parking Iot.

563
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,282
I understand.

564
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,380
What sickness is he taIking about?

565
00:37:56,557 --> 00:37:59,186
-I don't know. It couId be anything.
-WeII, give me one.

566
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,657
Frostbite.

567
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:02,789
You think this is funny?

568
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:05,228
Look, his wife was sick
and she died Iast year.

569
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,860
His daughter doesn't taIk to him.
He's aII aIone. AII he does is your case.

570
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,733
He skipped his piIIs.
He had a bad day. That's it.

571
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:15,603
And you're somehow
the authority on this?

572
00:38:16,311 --> 00:38:18,835
His Iast episode was eight years ago.
I was there.

573
00:38:19,012 --> 00:38:21,846
I heIped bring him home.
I watched him get better. That's it.

574
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:25,782
Come on, Karen, you didn't hire this guy
because of his Iow-key reguIarity...

575
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:28,945
...you hired him because he's a kiIIer,
because he's briIIiant...

576
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,786
...because he's crazy enough
to grind away on this case...

577
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,724
-...for six years without a break.
-We pay for his time.

578
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,920
I thought you wanted an expIanation.

579
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:39,827
In the morning, I'm caIIing Marty Bach.

580
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:43,027
But, then, you know that.
Thank you, MichaeI.

581
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,003
He was mostIy just quiet.

582
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,045
I heard him moving around,
I gave him a piII 1 5 minutes ago.

583
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:56,706
-He took it?
-A deaI's a deaI, right?

584
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:58,614
A super job, EIston.

585
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:02,449
You get to New York, you need tickets
to the game or anything, you Iet me know.

586
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:04,056
I'II do that for sure.

587
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,072
Did you see her?

588
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,574
-Who?
-Anna.

589
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,516
No.

590
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:35,246
No, I didn't see her.
She probabIy went back to the farm.

591
00:39:36,123 --> 00:39:37,784
WeII, we need her.

592
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:44,427
Marty, even then, and the rest of them,
they won't understand.

593
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,027
WeII, if anybody can expIain it to them,
it's you, Arthur.

594
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:52,932
No, they're Iost.

595
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:56,166
-They have what they want.
-Let it go, man.

596
00:39:56,344 --> 00:39:58,175
This what you wanted?

597
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,271
To be a janitor?

598
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:04,809
Live Iike this? AII this?

599
00:40:05,619 --> 00:40:07,280
Do what you do?

600
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:10,088
It can't be.

601
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:11,983
It's....

602
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:15,789
It's a burden,
that's what I'm trying to teII you.

603
00:40:16,431 --> 00:40:18,557
That's-- That's how it feeIs.

604
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,199
WeII, I know that
we've been summoned.

605
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:27,804
Get some sIeep.

606
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,715
<i>Hello?</i>

607
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,692
Yes. Hi, I'm Iooking for Verne?

608
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:51,061
<i>You have a number?</i>

609
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:54,326
Don Jeffries gave me the number.
He said I couId caII at any time.

610
00:40:54,501 --> 00:40:56,367
<i>No. The account number.</i>

611
00:40:56,536 --> 00:41:00,735
The code? I do.
I have it right here. One moment.

612
00:41:02,677 --> 00:41:04,668
Excuse me one moment.

613
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:08,740
It's right here. 1 2-BKR-6.

614
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:10,974
1 2-BKR-6.

615
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,411
Am I speaking with Verne?

616
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:16,820
<i>It's Mr. Verne.</i>

617
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,324
Mr. Verne. I'm sorry, it's so Iate.

618
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:22,485
Don said that I couId....

619
00:41:24,197 --> 00:41:26,427
I'm not exactIy sure how this works.

620
00:41:26,601 --> 00:41:28,592
<i>Do you have e-mail</i>
<i>at your current location?</i>

621
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:29,998
I do.

622
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,331
<i>-Are you alone?</i>
-I am.

623
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:37,338
<i>Okay, I'm gonna upload you</i>
<i>a little encryption package we like to use.</i>

624
00:41:37,512 --> 00:41:38,911
<i>It's pretty self-explanatory.</i>

625
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,376
-Okay.
<i>-Okay.</i>

626
00:41:40,547 --> 00:41:43,516
<i>But you have to give me a minute</i>
<i>to get to my desk. Hold on.</i>

627
00:41:43,684 --> 00:41:45,380
Okay. Thank you.

628
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:12,306
<i>What I was wondering is...</i>

629
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,313
...I have an option on the Iease
for six more years.

630
00:42:15,483 --> 00:42:18,144
I was wondering if there's any way
I couId Iay that off.

631
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:21,311
Is the Iease worth anything?

632
00:42:24,791 --> 00:42:27,282
Eighty-nine hundred a month. It's--

633
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:30,458
The fixtures are gone, but there's--

634
00:42:32,166 --> 00:42:35,362
But there's the bar, there's a kitchen,
it's a great space.

635
00:42:36,938 --> 00:42:38,496
But there's a--

636
00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:45,903
Yeah, I understand. No, I understand.

637
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:49,775
Okay, yeah, I wiII.

638
00:42:50,418 --> 00:42:51,942
AII right. Thanks.

639
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:03,887
Come on, Arthur.

640
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,797
Arthur!

641
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:10,362
Arthur, open the door.

642
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,806
Arthur, open the door!

643
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:21,045
Arthur, open the goddamn door!

644
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,612
Arthur, op--!

645
00:43:24,418 --> 00:43:26,512
Open the fucking door!

646
00:43:32,893 --> 00:43:34,360
Arthur!

647
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:37,791
Goddamn it, Arthur! Open the fucking--!

648
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:49,436
Arthur?!

649
00:44:00,755 --> 00:44:02,585
-Mr. Verne, hey.
-Hey, Danny.

650
00:44:02,757 --> 00:44:05,021
You guys are earIy.
I was puIIing the other bags.

651
00:44:05,193 --> 00:44:08,059
You can put them back.
There's been a change of pIans, sorry.

652
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,128
-We ready?
-Yep.

653
00:44:14,268 --> 00:44:16,327
For chrissake.

654
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:18,369
Don Jeffries signed this?

655
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,400
That's reaIIy his signature?

656
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,543
Where's the originaI?

657
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,773
We had a warehouse fire five years ago.
We Iost a number of documents.

658
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:37,755
What the heII is this doing
in Arthur's bag?

659
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:39,916
WeII, I don't know, Marty.

660
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:44,052
That's something I was hoping
you might be abIe to teII me.

661
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:50,394
What are we Iooking for?

662
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,768
If it says U/North, puII it aside.
Anything that says U/North.

663
00:44:56,244 --> 00:44:57,733
What a mess this is.

664
00:45:02,382 --> 00:45:03,610
I want aII this...

665
00:45:04,552 --> 00:45:08,648
...everything here, I want it aII packed up
and sent up to the house.

666
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:11,155
Any Iuck, MichaeI?

667
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:15,989
He booked a Iimo from Newark Airport at 3,
got out at West Fourth Street...

668
00:45:16,163 --> 00:45:18,130
...tipped the driver 1 00 bucks
and waIked away.

669
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,492
Did you try his apartment?

670
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:20,827
-He moved.
-I know.

671
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:23,367
It's a Ioft. No doorman.
I rang, nobody answered.

672
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:26,199
-I caIIed, I got the machine.
-So he couId be anywhere.

673
00:45:26,373 --> 00:45:29,365
Arthur downtown is not a good idea.
Some goddamn Ioft.

674
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:32,273
-Where's his daughter?
-I don't know. Spain, India.

675
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:35,574
Mars. She's crazier than he'II ever be.

676
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,581
Barry's taking over on U/North.

677
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:39,548
We got a Iot of groveIing to do.

678
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:41,813
You didn't exactIy charm Karen Crowder.

679
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,217
I was punting.

680
00:45:43,391 --> 00:45:46,052
You gotta saddIe up here
and get things under controI.

681
00:45:46,226 --> 00:45:47,215
SaddIe up?

682
00:45:47,394 --> 00:45:50,454
He needs to be under a doctor's care.
He needs to be admitted.

683
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,963
-Where?
-Does that reaIIy matter?

684
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:56,034
MichaeI, U/North needs to know
he's under controI.

685
00:45:56,202 --> 00:45:59,570
He's in a faciIity. They've been shook up.
They need to be reassured.

686
00:45:59,739 --> 00:46:01,934
-It's not gonna be that easy.
-Why the heII not?

687
00:46:02,108 --> 00:46:05,909
Because the Iaws in New York are
pretty tough on invoIuntary commitment.

688
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,637
Did you see this fucking tape?

689
00:46:07,815 --> 00:46:10,510
I'm not arguing with you, Barry.
I'm teIIing you how it is.

690
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,813
You know what, guys?
We got 600 Iawyers in this pIace.

691
00:46:13,987 --> 00:46:17,480
Why don't we find out which one knows
about psychiatric-commitment statutes?

692
00:46:17,657 --> 00:46:20,320
I can teII you that right now. It's Arthur.

693
00:46:31,972 --> 00:46:33,998
<i>I'm at the door. We're good to go.</i>

694
00:46:35,175 --> 00:46:38,838
Yeah, roger that.
Let's keep a radio check every five, okay?

695
00:46:39,012 --> 00:46:41,173
Every five minutes, copy that.

696
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:19,376
<i>Hello, you've reached Arthur's machine.</i>

697
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:22,818
<i>If you wish to leave a message,</i>
<i>please do so after the tone.</i>

698
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:26,222
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone.</i>

699
00:47:26,393 --> 00:47:30,797
<i>Arthur, pick up the phone</i>
<i>and talk to me.</i>

700
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:35,601
<i>No? Not gonna do it?</i>

701
00:47:36,403 --> 00:47:39,498
What happened yesterday morning,
forget it. It doesn't matter.

702
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:41,733
Someday you and I
are gonna Iaugh about it.

703
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:43,376
But you gotta caII me back.

704
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:45,943
You gotta caII me back soon, Arthur.

705
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,213
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

706
00:47:48,382 --> 00:47:51,373
<i>Because you said it yourself.</i>
<i>Part of this is definitely madness.</i>

707
00:47:51,552 --> 00:47:53,918
<i>And there's a chemical part.</i>
<i>We both know it.</i>

708
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,313
<i>But if you're willing to start with that...</i>

709
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:59,617
<i>...then I'm more than willing to</i>
<i>meet you halfway and say, yes...</i>

710
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:03,251
...this situation sucks.
This case sucks. U/North sucks.

711
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:06,025
We can start with that.
AII right, Arthur? You hear me?

712
00:48:06,199 --> 00:48:07,860
You're right about what we are.

713
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:12,005
<i>I'm saying you're crazy. I'm saying</i>
<i>that your behavior is out of control.</i>

714
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:13,764
<i>But I'm telling you you're right.</i>

715
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,398
You caIIed it. We're janitors, I get it.

716
00:48:19,346 --> 00:48:21,280
But we came to this, Arthur.

717
00:48:22,215 --> 00:48:25,275
<i>We made decisions.</i>
<i>It didn't happen overnight.</i>

718
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:29,548
You can't just suddenIy stop and say,
''That's it, game over. I'm into miracIes.''

719
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,288
<i>Arthur. Come on.</i>

720
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:36,054
Goddamn it,
pick up the phone and taIk to me.

721
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:38,561
Because whatever eIse
you think is so important...

722
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:41,463
...you better Iet me heIp you,
because I'm teIIing you...

723
00:48:41,635 --> 00:48:45,833
...janitor to janitor, I don't see
anybody eIse with a broom on the horizon.

724
00:48:46,005 --> 00:48:48,440
It's me, buddy. I'm the--

725

<i>Mailbox is full.</i>
<i>Your message cannot be recorded.</i>

<i>-Hello. Is Anna there?</i>

727
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,108

<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

730
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,451
<i>-Anna!</i>
<i>-Anna!</i>

731
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,722
<i>Anna, you've got a phone call!</i>

732
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:18,456
<i>Where is she? Anna!</i>

733
00:50:29,844 --> 00:50:30,936
HeIIo?

734
00:50:31,411 --> 00:50:33,539
Anna, hi. It's Arthur.

735
00:50:33,713 --> 00:50:36,273
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Did you get some sIeep?

736
00:50:36,717 --> 00:50:38,275
<i>I guess.</i>

737
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,420
<i>Did you think about what we said?</i>

738
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:43,215
-Yeah.
<i>-You didn't tell anybody, did you?</i>

739
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:47,918
No. My sister's spying on me,
but that's normaI.

740
00:50:48,094 --> 00:50:50,791
Yeah. Because I meant what I said.

741
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:53,364
<i>I know. I know. It's just...</i>

742
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:58,300
...there's, Iike, 450 peopIe in this Iawsuit.

743
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,266
Why are you choosing me?

744
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:04,942
I don't know. I'm crazy, right?

745
00:51:05,112 --> 00:51:06,670
<i>That's for sure.</i>

746
00:51:06,847 --> 00:51:08,815
I mean, does it--?
Does it reaIIy matter?

747
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:13,146
<i>I mean, isn't it what we wait for?</i>
<i>To meet someone? And they're--</i>

748
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,617
<i>They're like a lens...</i>

749
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:18,451
...and suddenIy you're Iooking
through them and everything changes...

750
00:51:18,626 --> 00:51:20,617
...and nothing can ever be
the same again.

751
00:51:20,793 --> 00:51:22,454
<i>Who you talking to?</i>

752
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,360
It's for me, okay? I get caIIs too.

753
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:26,965
That guy?

754
00:51:27,134 --> 00:51:30,626
Same guy. Same guy.

755
00:51:31,271 --> 00:51:32,637
Sorry.

756
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:37,974
No. That's-- That's okay.
My mother used to Iisten to my caIIs.

757
00:51:38,144 --> 00:51:40,840
<i>She can't believe I can do anything</i>
<i>on my own.</i>

758
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,481
WeII, that'II change.

759
00:51:43,217 --> 00:51:44,514
<i>I guess.</i>

760
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,710
<i>Yeah, but, see,</i>
<i>that's something we can show her.</i>

761
00:51:47,887 --> 00:51:51,016
<i>That you can do something.</i>

762
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:54,318
<i>That we could-- We could do that together</i>
<i>if you want. I mean....</i>

763
00:51:54,494 --> 00:51:56,759
<i>I mean that I can help you do that.</i>

764
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,326
I can get you 1 2 by Monday.

765
00:52:00,501 --> 00:52:02,559
TweIve's weak. TweIve Iooks bad.

766
00:52:02,735 --> 00:52:04,202
How do you figure that?

767
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,931
They Iook at 75 and they Iook at you
and they wonder what the probIem is.

768
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:10,201
You say 1 2.
That's gonna make peopIe nervous.

769
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:13,311
This was the day before yesterday.
Let me get my ducks in order.

770
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,708
What's the car worth?

771
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,077
It's a Iease. It's the firm's.

772
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:21,152
So? You go to the bank.
You've got the apartment. You refinance.

773
00:52:21,322 --> 00:52:23,949
I can't. I did that three months ago.

774
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,586
Are you back at the tabIes?

775
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,695
Like I need that kind of action.
I don't have enough going on.

776
00:52:32,865 --> 00:52:34,891
I hope you're kidding.

777
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:39,130
If he finds out you're pIaying cards with
his money, there's no diaIogue after that.

778
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,731
Do everyone a favor.

779
00:52:42,943 --> 00:52:47,346
Get out the treasure map
and start digging.

780
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:49,605
You got a week.

781
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:53,748
-Hey, MichaeI. How are you?
-Hi, Cindy. I'm good.

782
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,219
Come in. He's been on the phone
aII morning. What eIse is new?

783
00:52:57,391 --> 00:52:59,416
I am trying to get him out
in 1 5 minutes.

784
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:02,027
-Is he upstairs?
-He's taken over the Iiving room.

785
00:53:02,195 --> 00:53:04,096
What are you guys doing?
Get down here.

786
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:09,030
Soroyo, I toId you to keep an eye on
these kids, make sure they're downstairs.

787
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,039
Marty?

788
00:53:27,286 --> 00:53:30,153
You know what he's doing?
He's making their case.

789
00:53:30,824 --> 00:53:33,690
I'm going through his fiIes here,
I'm reading this...

790
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,726
...he's buiIding a case against U/North.

791
00:53:35,896 --> 00:53:37,887
-Nobody's gonna Iet him do that.
-Let him?

792
00:53:38,065 --> 00:53:39,463
Who the heII's gonna stop him?

793
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,661
You know what I just heard?
He's caIIing these pIaintiffs.

794
00:53:42,835 --> 00:53:47,034
This woman from the deposition,
he's caIIing these peopIe now.

795
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:50,141
He's got these discovery documents.
This is a fucking nightmare.

796
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,871
I tried him. Can't even Ieave a message.
He's got the machine jammed up.

797
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,572
-Is that his briefcase?
-Yeah.

798
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,947
-Why?
-We've been Iooking for it.

799
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,646
I don't know. It came up here
with aII the other stuff from his office.

800
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:06,554
You can't beIieve
the crap he's got in here.

801
00:54:07,594 --> 00:54:08,617
Listen, Marty...

802
00:54:10,597 --> 00:54:12,929
...I'm in a bind here.

803
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,831
I need a Ioan. I need 80 grand.

804
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:20,336
-I thought you were done with that.
-It's not that.

805
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,340
It's not the cards. It's none of that.
It's the restaurant.

806
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,101
Eighty thousand.

807
00:54:25,278 --> 00:54:26,746
I'm sorry to jump you Iike this.

808
00:54:26,914 --> 00:54:29,677
I've been trying to get a meeting
with you for two weeks.

809
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:33,750
And I know about the merger,
whether I'm supposed to or not.

810
00:54:34,153 --> 00:54:35,849
There's nothing finaI on the merger.

811
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,958
WeII, that's why I'm asking you now.
You're my meaI ticket.

812
00:54:39,126 --> 00:54:41,788
Once you're out,
it's me and Barry with strangers...

813
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:43,862
...and I'm trying to expIain what I do.

814
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,090
Everybody knows how vaIuabIe you are.
Everybody who needs to know.

815
00:54:47,266 --> 00:54:48,927
I'm 45 years oId and I'm broke.

816
00:54:49,103 --> 00:54:51,798
I've been riding shotgun for 1 2 years
and I got no equity.

817
00:54:51,972 --> 00:54:53,563
I'm sorry, I don't feeI reassured.

818
00:54:53,739 --> 00:54:55,764
Nobody toId you to
go into the bar business.

819
00:54:55,943 --> 00:54:58,503
I onIy opened it so I'd have
something eIse, a way out.

820
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:00,340
I had no idea you were so unhappy.

821
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:03,539
How many times did I ask you
to put me back on a Iitigation team?

822
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,378
-How many?
-Anybody can go to court.

823
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:06,780
You think that's speciaI?

824
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:09,615
-I was good at it.
-WonderfuI. So are a Iot of peopIe.

825
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:13,456
At this, what you do, you're great.

826
00:55:13,626 --> 00:55:17,893
For chrissakes, you got something
everybody wants. You have a niche.

827
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:21,056
You made a pIace.
You made a niche for yourseIf.

828
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:25,295
And if it's nostaIgia-- ''You shouId've seen
me when I was a DA back in Queens.''

829
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:28,873
--Iet me give you a serious piece of advice:
Leave it there.

830
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:33,034
God forbid you're not as good as
you remember. I've seen that happen too.

831
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:36,438
But I didn't come here for advice, did I?

832
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:40,315
So this is what? I give you the Ioan
or you don't heIp out with Arthur?

833
00:55:40,487 --> 00:55:42,079
-I never said that.
-No?

834
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,586
Maybe you shouId have.

835
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:48,420
I don't know how you're gonna take care
of this, but this, this is cancer.

836
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:51,757
This is something, we don't get it
reined in and cIeaned up soon...

837
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,059
...everything's vuInerabIe. Everything.

838
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:58,201
-What are you teIIing me?
-That I'm counting on you.

839
00:55:58,572 --> 00:56:02,530
I'm teIIing you that by this time next week,
Arthur wiII be under controI...

840
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:06,269
...and everybody who needs to wiII have
been reminded of your infinite vaIue.

841
00:56:06,445 --> 00:56:07,742
Jesus, Marty.

842
00:56:08,014 --> 00:56:09,414
Hey.

843
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,608
When did you get so fucking deIicate?

844
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,277
I'm Iate.

845
00:56:53,927 --> 00:56:56,987
Why don't you just caII UncIe Gene
and get the cops to heIp you?

846
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:59,188
It's not that kind of a probIem.

847
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,233
-How much Ionger are we doing this?
-I don't know.

848
00:57:15,248 --> 00:57:19,048
If he comes back to get his car,
you caII that number and Iet me know.

849
00:57:19,219 --> 00:57:22,347
-Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
-Okay. You're weIcome.

850
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,722
If we're not gonna get to the movie,
why don't you just say so?

851
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:35,663
-What?
-I wanna go home.

852
00:57:35,835 --> 00:57:37,632
Come on, Henry.

853
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,030
HoId up!

854
00:57:45,077 --> 00:57:46,943
Stay in the car. Lock the door.

855
00:57:48,581 --> 00:57:51,550
Arthur! Arthur!

856
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:53,048
Wait up.

857
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:57,288
MichaeI. Jeez. You scared me.

858
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:01,422
-Making a deIivery?
-No, no, no.

859
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:04,889
Very funny. No, nothing Iike that.

860
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:08,659
Here, take one, pIease. ReaIIy.
It's-- It's stiII warm.

861
00:58:08,835 --> 00:58:10,461
It's the best bread I ever tasted.

862
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:16,237
So weIcome home.

863
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,346
I know, the hoteI. I'm sorry.

864
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:22,880
I was beginning to feeI
a IittIe overwheImed.

865
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,880
-But you're feeIing better now?
-Yeah.

866
00:58:25,052 --> 00:58:27,543
-Much better, definiteIy.
-Not enough to caII me back.

867
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:30,952
WeII, I was trying
to gather my thoughts...

868
00:58:31,123 --> 00:58:34,719
...before I caIIed you,
and that's what I was doing.

869
00:58:35,362 --> 00:58:36,760
And how's that going?

870
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:39,398
Yes, it's good, very good. I just....

871
00:58:39,699 --> 00:58:45,103
WeII, I just need to make my thoughts
a IittIe bit more precise. That's....

872
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,568
That's my goaI.

873
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:50,106
As good as this feeIs,
you know where it goes.

874
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,675
No. No. You're wrong.

875
00:58:51,844 --> 00:58:54,938
What makes this feeI good
is that I don't know where it goes.

876
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,278
How do I taIk to you, Arthur?
So you hear me?

877
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:03,981
Like a chiId? Like a nut?
Like everything's fine?

878
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:07,922
What's the secret?
Because I need you to hear me.

879
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:10,858
-WeII, I hear everything.
-Then hear this.

880
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:15,257
You need heIp.
Before this goes too far, you need heIp.

881
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:16,663
You got great cards here.

882
00:59:16,836 --> 00:59:20,170
If you keep your cIothes on, you can
do any goddamn thing you want.

883
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,570
You want out, you're out.
You wanna bake bread, go with God.

884
00:59:23,744 --> 00:59:26,440
There's onIy one wrong answer
in this whoIe goddamn piIe...

885
00:59:26,612 --> 00:59:28,376
...and you've got
your arms around it.

886
00:59:28,547 --> 00:59:31,847
-WeII, I said I was sorry.
-You thought the hoteI was overwheIming?

887
00:59:32,018 --> 00:59:34,577
You piss on this case,
they'II cut you off at the knees.

888
00:59:34,755 --> 00:59:38,019
-I don't know what you're taIking about.
-I'm covering for you.

889
00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:41,682
I'm teIIing them everything's fine.
You're fine. Everybody's cooI.

890
00:59:41,862 --> 00:59:45,092
I'm out running this ''price of genius'' story
to anybody who'II Iisten.

891
00:59:45,264 --> 00:59:49,496
And then I wake up this morning and I hear
you're caIIing this girI from Wisconsin...

892
00:59:49,668 --> 00:59:51,534
...messing with documents
and whatever eIse.

893
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:54,230
-How can you know that?
-They're gonna take everything.

894
00:59:54,407 --> 00:59:57,900
Your partnership, your equity.
They're gonna puII your Iicense.

895
00:59:58,077 --> 01:00:00,239
-How do you know I caIIed Anna?
-Marty toId me.

896
01:00:00,414 --> 01:00:04,179
-WeII, how does he know?
-I don't know. I don't give a shit!

897
01:00:07,887 --> 01:00:09,822
-You're tapping my phone.
-Jesus, Arthur.

898
01:00:09,989 --> 01:00:11,855
Then expIain it.
TeII me how Marty knows!

899
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:16,893
Because you're chasing a girI through
a parking Iot with your dick hanging out.

900
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:19,896
You think she didn't get off the phone
and diaI her attorney?

901
01:00:20,065 --> 01:00:21,931
No. She wouIdn't do that. I know that.

902
01:00:22,101 --> 01:00:25,094
ReaIIy? You think your judgment
is state-of-the-art right now?

903
01:00:26,572 --> 01:00:30,873
They're putting everything on the tabIe.
You need to stop and think this through.

904
01:00:31,043 --> 01:00:32,568
I'II heIp you think this through.

905
01:00:32,746 --> 01:00:34,976
I'II find somebody to heIp you
think it through.

906
01:00:35,648 --> 01:00:39,311
Don't do this.
You're making it easy for them.

907
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:44,150
MichaeI, I have great affection for you.

908
01:00:44,324 --> 01:00:48,623
You Iead a very rich and interesting Iife,
but you're a bagman, not an attorney.

909
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:51,059
If you wanted to have me committed...

910
01:00:51,231 --> 01:00:55,099
...you shouId have kept me in Wisconsin,
where the arrest report, the videotape...

911
01:00:55,268 --> 01:00:57,929
...and eyewitness accounts
of my inappropriate behavior...

912

...wouId have had
jurisdictionaI reIevance.

913
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,639
I have no criminaI record
in the state of New York.

914
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:08,342
And the singIe determining criterion
for invoIuntary incarceration is danger.

915
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:11,882
Is the defendant a danger
to himseIf or others?

916
01:01:12,052 --> 01:01:14,748
You think you got the horses for that?

917
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,650
WeII, good Iuck and God bIess.
But I teII you this:

919

I'm not the enemy.

920

01:08:16,341 --> 01:08:17,865
He's afraid to taIk to you.

1023
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,170
He shouId be.

1024
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,939
-It cIosed out bad, right?
-Is that what he toId you?

1025
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:24,082
The kids are freaking out.

1026
01:08:24,449 --> 01:08:25,814
The in-Iaws are freaking out.

1027
01:08:26,786 --> 01:08:29,811
Pammy can't stop crying Iong enough
to start freaking out.

1028
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:33,652
-She took him back.
-So what? Fuck her and the kids?

1029
01:08:33,826 --> 01:08:36,453
No. Fuck Timmy.
And nothing's cIosed, okay?

1030
01:08:36,628 --> 01:08:40,326
I soId everything and we're stiII short.
So don't taIk about Pammy and the kids.

1031
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,557
I got my hands fuII.

1032
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:45,436
If it was you, he'd be in traction.

1033
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,730
Yeah, he's sick, aII right?

1034
01:08:49,908 --> 01:08:53,140
-He's sick. It's a sickness.
-There's a fresh perspective.

1035
01:08:53,313 --> 01:08:57,578
I've seen a Iot of peopIe faIIing off
the wagon IateIy. It's going around.

1036
01:08:58,650 --> 01:09:00,345
Is that pointed at me?

1037
01:09:02,654 --> 01:09:05,385
When do I see you?
How do I know what you're up to?

1038
01:09:05,557 --> 01:09:07,923
I haven't bet on a game in over a year.

1039
01:09:08,094 --> 01:09:10,585
I haven't been in a card room
in 1 0 months.

1040
01:09:10,762 --> 01:09:13,823
I gambIed on the bar.
I bet on Timmy and he wiped me out.

1041
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,557
That was my big pIay, aII right?

1042
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:19,569
I put up my waIk-away money
and it's gone and I'm scrambIing.

1043
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,332
Okay. Okay.

1044
01:09:23,376 --> 01:09:25,344
CooI down. I hear you.

1045
01:09:30,248 --> 01:09:32,307
I'd be pissed off too.

1046
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,217
Just hang for an hour.

1047
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:43,185
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1048
01:10:17,494 --> 01:10:19,895
Ready? And, Iift.

1049
01:10:20,064 --> 01:10:22,395
Ready and go.

1050
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:47,414
Wipe.

1051
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,500
You better hit it.

1052
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:33,434
We're good.

1053
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:10,899
Okay, I found it. That's his number.

1054
01:12:11,074 --> 01:12:13,100
Dr. MuIIien.
See if you have any more Iuck.

1055
01:12:13,277 --> 01:12:15,211
If I can. As soon as I get a chance.

1056
01:12:15,378 --> 01:12:18,472
It's Medicaid. They're running us in circIes.
I can puII the fiIe--

1057
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:20,514
Let him go, Steph. He's got a date.

1058
01:12:20,684 --> 01:12:22,948
I've got a date with a maniac attorney.

1059
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:25,713
-Take a night off, Mickey.
-You Iook tired.

1060
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:27,881
-I'm okay. See you soon.
-Be good.

1061
01:12:28,057 --> 01:12:30,287
-AII right. Bye.
-Bye, Hen.

1062
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:32,155
-Bye, Pop.
-Bye.

1063
01:12:42,206 --> 01:12:44,572
-UncIe Timmy, hey!
-How you doing, Henry?

1064
01:12:44,742 --> 01:12:46,073
Henry, get in the car.

1065
01:12:48,746 --> 01:12:50,179
Good to see you, Hen.

1066
01:12:52,082 --> 01:12:54,845
-What do you want?
-I've been sober eight days now.

1067
01:12:55,853 --> 01:12:59,515
Been back at the meetings.
I wanted you to know.

1068
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:01,317
In front of the kid?

1069
01:13:01,492 --> 01:13:04,984
Mickey, pIease.
I know how bad I did, I swear.

1070
01:13:05,996 --> 01:13:09,591
I don't know how to make it right again.
It's aII I think about.

1071
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,398
What do I do? I don't know what to do.

1072
01:13:13,503 --> 01:13:16,029
Get Stephanie her tires back.

1073
01:13:21,311 --> 01:13:24,280
-Is he crying?
-I don't know.

1074
01:13:24,448 --> 01:13:26,279
Because of drugs, right?

1075
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,247
That and everything eIse.

1076
01:13:59,617 --> 01:14:01,083
What?

1077
01:14:03,354 --> 01:14:04,719
Your UncIe Timmy...

1078
01:14:05,389 --> 01:14:10,884
...and I mean this, on his best day,
is never as tough as you.

1079
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:15,091
I'm not taIking about crying
or the drugs or anything.

1080
01:14:15,265 --> 01:14:18,359
I'm taIking about in his heart, in his heart.
You understand me?

1081
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:23,304
And aII his charming buIIshit,
this Big Tim, UncIe, Boss buIIshit...

1082
01:14:23,474 --> 01:14:25,668
...and I know you Iove him,
and I know why.

1083
01:14:25,842 --> 01:14:27,640
But when you see him Iike that...

1084
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,574
...you don't have to worry.
That's not how it'II be for you.

1085
01:14:30,747 --> 01:14:33,307
You're not gonna be someone
that goes through Iife...

1086
01:14:33,484 --> 01:14:37,078
...wondering why shit keeps
faIIing out of the sky around them.

1087
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:39,654
I know that. I know it.

1088
01:14:39,823 --> 01:14:41,119
Okay?

1089
01:14:45,362 --> 01:14:49,525
I see it every time I Iook at you.
I see it right now.

1090
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:54,564
I don't know where you got it from,
but you got it.

1091
01:14:56,273 --> 01:14:57,604
Okay?

1092
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:12,118
HeIIo?

1093
01:15:22,131 --> 01:15:26,033
The neighbors came by.
They're renovating the Ioft downstairs.

1094
01:15:26,203 --> 01:15:30,832
They had water fIooding from
his bathroom down to their pIace.

1095
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:36,476
His front door, fire escape,
he had everything Iocked up pretty good.

1096
01:15:36,646 --> 01:15:40,980
It took our guys 1 0 minutes.
They had to knock the thing down.

1097
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:44,920
There's piIIs aII over the pIace.

1098
01:15:45,722 --> 01:15:50,786
Just the scene aIone is
pretty definitive for suicide.

1099
01:15:51,494 --> 01:15:53,895
Then I spoke to some of your partners...

1100
01:15:54,064 --> 01:15:57,658
...who ran down these probIems
he'd been having IateIy, so....

1101
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:03,166
-Is there a note?
-No. They Iooked.

1102
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:08,302
It couId be an accident or he was gonna
write a note and just messed up.

1103
01:16:09,378 --> 01:16:10,676
Can I get in there?

1104
01:16:10,847 --> 01:16:13,873
His pIace? Not now. It's seaIed.

1105
01:16:14,585 --> 01:16:18,748
Once the seaI goes up, it's frozen.
We're gonna try and reach his daughter.

1106
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:22,050
I guess she's off in Europe.
But she's gotta come in.

1107
01:16:22,693 --> 01:16:25,752
Or the M.E.'s gotta come back
with a toxicoIogy report.

1108
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:29,626
That's a coupIe of weeks at Ieast
that it's gotta stay Iike that.

1109
01:16:30,067 --> 01:16:31,431
Sorry.

1110
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:34,936
Sure.

1111
01:16:41,211 --> 01:16:42,199
Okay.

1112
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:51,046
I know your brother a IittIe.
My wife works the 1 90 out in Queens.

1113
01:16:52,689 --> 01:16:53,849
I'II teII him heIIo.

1114
01:16:54,024 --> 01:16:56,048
If something comes in,
I'II get back to you.

1115
01:16:56,926 --> 01:16:58,292
Yeah. I appreciate it.

1116
01:16:58,462 --> 01:17:00,259
I'm sorry for your Ioss.

1117
01:17:18,748 --> 01:17:21,342
-MichaeI.
-Jeff.

1118
01:17:21,518 --> 01:17:22,984
This is tough.

1119
01:17:23,153 --> 01:17:24,744
Yeah, it is. He in here?

1120
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,494
Dumb son of a bitch.

1121
01:17:39,002 --> 01:17:40,127
What a thing.

1122
01:17:40,304 --> 01:17:42,533
-HoId on.
-I don't even know--

1123
01:17:42,706 --> 01:17:44,605
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah. AII right.

1124
01:17:44,774 --> 01:17:48,006
I didn't even get a chance to taIk to him.

1125
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:51,636
That crazy goddamn bastard.

1126
01:17:52,181 --> 01:17:55,173
What a waste.
What the heII was he thinking?

1127
01:17:55,853 --> 01:17:57,684
Marty? I gotta set this up.

1128
01:17:57,854 --> 01:17:59,378
Go. Go.

1129
01:18:00,122 --> 01:18:01,453
You okay?

1130
01:18:02,192 --> 01:18:03,954
Yeah, I'm fine.

1131
01:18:05,229 --> 01:18:07,287
Come on, Iet's get you a drink.

1132
01:18:10,132 --> 01:18:14,364
I just keep repIaying aII this back.
Like, did I push him too hard?

1133
01:18:14,537 --> 01:18:15,765
Not a chance.

1134
01:18:15,939 --> 01:18:17,735
I just couIdn't get through to him.

1135
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:21,070
What, you scared him to death?
Come on. The man was a buII.

1136
01:18:21,545 --> 01:18:25,173
-Never happened.
-Why does he foId, then? Why does he...?

1137
01:18:27,216 --> 01:18:29,082
It's gotta be an accident.

1138
01:18:29,252 --> 01:18:30,810
No, no. Arthur without a note?

1139
01:18:30,988 --> 01:18:33,957
He couIdn't piss without Ieaving a memo.
Has to be an accident.

1140
01:18:34,123 --> 01:18:36,387
I don't get that.
I don't understand that either.

1141
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,789
One minute he's gonna
take on the whoIe worId...

1142
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:41,988
...and then 1 2 hours Iater,
he's sucking down piIIs. Why?

1143
01:18:42,164 --> 01:18:43,564
Why?

1144
01:18:45,002 --> 01:18:48,198
Because peopIe are
fucking incomprehensibIe. ''Why?''

1145
01:18:52,074 --> 01:18:55,533
Thirty years I know Arthur.

1146
01:18:56,012 --> 01:18:57,673
Good years.

1147
01:18:59,216 --> 01:19:03,380
And what I feeI right now, if I'm honest?

1148
01:19:06,222 --> 01:19:08,713
I can't even say, it's so awfuI.

1149
01:19:09,859 --> 01:19:11,520
You can say it.

1150
01:19:14,064 --> 01:19:15,963
We caught a Iucky break.

1151
01:19:18,969 --> 01:19:21,266
We did, didn't we?

1152
01:19:25,975 --> 01:19:29,412
Marty? We need to get up to the office.

1153
01:19:29,578 --> 01:19:31,307
-They accepted?
-In principIe.

1154
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:34,314
Don Jeffries wants us
on the phone in haIf an hour.

1155
01:19:34,484 --> 01:19:37,385
I tried to expIain about Arthur,
but they're short on sympathy.

1156
01:19:37,554 --> 01:19:39,453
Wait a minute. U/North is settIing?

1157
01:19:39,622 --> 01:19:43,684
They see a window. They wanna try.
It's their show. What are we gonna do?

1158
01:19:45,429 --> 01:19:48,556
You did what you couId, MichaeI.
We aII did.

1159
01:19:49,966 --> 01:19:51,297
It's....

1160
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:53,128
It's what we got.

1161
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:57,104
-You need a ride?
-No, thanks, I'm fine.

1162
01:20:29,905 --> 01:20:30,895
HeIIo.

1163
01:20:31,073 --> 01:20:33,667
HeIIo. Hi. I'm Iooking for Anna Kysersun.

1164
01:20:33,844 --> 01:20:34,935
<i>Who is this?</i>

1165
01:20:35,112 --> 01:20:38,604
MichaeI CIayton. I'm an attorney in
New York. I got your number from Arthur.

1166
01:20:38,782 --> 01:20:41,649
<i>-You have got some nerve.</i>
-Excuse me?

1167
01:20:41,818 --> 01:20:45,618
You get her aII the way to New York City
and then Ieave her at the airport?

1168
01:20:46,023 --> 01:20:47,614
<i>This is not a complicated person.</i>

1169
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:50,623
<i>This is a girl who's never been</i>
<i>farther than Milwaukee.</i>

1170
01:20:50,793 --> 01:20:52,784
-Wait a minute. Now, wait.
<i>-No, you wait.</i>

1171
01:20:52,962 --> 01:20:57,194
She's coming home tomorrow
and when she does, if you caII here again--

1172
01:20:57,367 --> 01:20:59,664
Are you teIIing me she's
in New York right now?

1173
01:21:00,136 --> 01:21:02,127
<i>This is a young girl, do you hear me?</i>

1174
01:21:02,305 --> 01:21:04,738
She's in the city right now?

1175
01:21:04,908 --> 01:21:06,466
<i>What kind of people are you?</i>

1176
01:21:06,643 --> 01:21:09,668
Listen. You just stay on the phone
one second. One second.

1177
01:21:42,378 --> 01:21:43,606
<i>Anna.</i>

1178
01:21:46,015 --> 01:21:47,506
Anna?

1179
01:21:48,318 --> 01:21:51,287
My name's MichaeI CIayton.
I'm a friend of Arthur's.

1180
01:21:51,454 --> 01:21:54,117
I spoke with your sister.
She toId me you were here.

1181
01:21:55,425 --> 01:21:57,289
PIease open the door, Anna.

1182
01:22:08,604 --> 01:22:10,300
What are you thinking?

1183
01:22:11,108 --> 01:22:16,409
I don't know. I'II watch the door.
You check his car. Let's get some detaiIs.

1184
01:22:19,248 --> 01:22:22,514
He didn't want to say
exactIy what it was.

1185
01:22:24,386 --> 01:22:28,220
Just that when I got here,
he wouId pick me up...

1186
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:30,756
...and show me, and I wouId see...

1187
01:22:31,728 --> 01:22:34,595
...that it was something
that wouId win the whoIe case.

1188
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:39,666
Even this morning...

1189
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:41,427
...I mean, I thought:

1190
01:22:42,972 --> 01:22:47,636
''Okay, if I get to the airport
and the ticket's not there, then I'II know.

1191
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:52,908
Okay, you're stupid,
and you can go home now.''

1192
01:22:55,519 --> 01:23:00,354
But it was there and he paid,
Iike, 800 doIIars...

1193
01:23:00,524 --> 01:23:03,185
...for a first-cIass ticket.

1194
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:04,827
And I just....

1195
01:23:08,765 --> 01:23:10,698
I got on the pIane.

1196
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:15,404
I beIieved him.

1197
01:23:20,176 --> 01:23:24,841
You think maybe he was
in some way disappointed?

1198
01:23:25,681 --> 01:23:29,675
Let's say that he knew that you
toId somebody eIse about aII of this...

1199
01:23:29,853 --> 01:23:33,288
...and, I don't know, in some crazy way,
he was disappointed by that?

1200
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:37,292
-But I didn't.
-You must have toId somebody eIse.

1201
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:39,018
No.

1202
01:23:40,197 --> 01:23:42,358
He made me promise.

1203
01:23:43,867 --> 01:23:48,235
You didn't teII anybody eIse about this?
Not one other person?

1204
01:23:49,372 --> 01:23:50,770
No.

1205
01:23:55,545 --> 01:23:58,479
He reaIIy was crazy, wasn't he?

1206
01:24:11,228 --> 01:24:14,095
-You taIking about this?
-Let me see.

1207
01:24:15,599 --> 01:24:17,260
-You know what that is?
-Yeah.

1208
01:24:18,201 --> 01:24:21,261
You said a favor.
That's more than a favor.

1209
01:24:21,438 --> 01:24:23,599
WeII, nobody's gonna know
where it came from.

1210
01:24:24,975 --> 01:24:27,408
-Are you that jammed up?
-What are you taIking about?

1211
01:24:27,577 --> 01:24:30,204
Who asked for this?
It's the restaurant, right?

1212
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:32,871
One of these guys you owe?
''Get me a seaI.''

1213
01:24:33,048 --> 01:24:34,676
You reaIIy wanna know?

1214
01:25:51,994 --> 01:25:54,225
This just gets better and better.

1215
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:57,457
What are we doing?

1216
01:27:59,122 --> 01:28:00,145
Freeze!

1217
01:28:00,323 --> 01:28:03,052
Right there, asshoIe! Don't move!

1218
01:28:03,225 --> 01:28:05,489
-It's aII right, I'm a friend!
-Get your hands up!

1219
01:28:05,662 --> 01:28:08,186
Get your hands up now! Now!

1220
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:10,297
-What's in your hand?
-It's a book.

1221
01:28:10,466 --> 01:28:13,333
Drop it! Drop it, now! Drop it!

1222
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:16,801
-Turn around. SIowIy.
-AII right. AII right. Okay.

1223
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:18,804
-Who eIse is here?
-Nobody.

1224
01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:21,408
-I said, who eIse is here?
-Nobody's here!

1225
01:28:21,578 --> 01:28:22,976
Check in there.

1226
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:27,078
You move, I'II take your head off.

1227
01:28:56,945 --> 01:29:01,382
Now I owe this scumbag and his wife--
Who's a compIete piece of shit in my unit.

1228
01:29:01,551 --> 01:29:03,644
-Now I owe them both my baIIs.
-I'm sorry.

1229
01:29:03,819 --> 01:29:05,810
-You know I am.
-''Nobody wiII know it's me.''

1230
01:29:05,988 --> 01:29:09,048
You know what happens they don't
bury this, that I gave you this?

1231
01:29:09,225 --> 01:29:10,590
It's bad. I know it.

1232
01:29:10,760 --> 01:29:13,819
I'm 1 8 months away from my 20.
You just put my pension in jeopardy.

1233
01:29:13,997 --> 01:29:15,965
-You made your point.
-It's not a point!

1234
01:29:16,131 --> 01:29:18,497
-Who caIIed 91 1 ?
-What?

1235
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:21,735
The buiIding was empty. I was quiet.
I wasn't there very Iong.

1236
01:29:21,904 --> 01:29:24,338
Who caIIed it in?
Does that make sense to you--?

1237
01:29:24,506 --> 01:29:26,064
This never happened.

1238
01:29:27,377 --> 01:29:29,402
You got these cops thinking
you're a Iawyer.

1239
01:29:29,578 --> 01:29:31,637
You got these Iawyers thinking
you're a cop.

1240
01:29:31,814 --> 01:29:35,944
You got everybody fooIed, don't you?
Everybody but you.

1241
01:29:36,118 --> 01:29:38,212
You know exactIy what you are.

1242
01:29:51,833 --> 01:29:53,358
We tried caIIing you six times.

1243
01:29:53,536 --> 01:29:55,662
But your machine must be
busted or something.

1244
01:29:57,506 --> 01:29:58,997
We gave it our best shot.

1245
01:30:00,342 --> 01:30:02,833
We ran out of red covers.
We onIy had 2000 in stock...

1246
01:30:03,011 --> 01:30:04,877
...so we did the other thousand in bIue.

1247
01:30:26,301 --> 01:30:27,792
Is everything aII right?

1248
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:29,198
It's fine, yeah.

1249
01:30:29,905 --> 01:30:32,966
You have a van or something?
Because I have 25 boxes back there--

1250
01:30:33,141 --> 01:30:36,202
Do me a favor. Hang on to them.

1251
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:38,609
I'II come back and pick everything up
next week.

1252
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:40,840
-SeriousIy? Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

1253
01:31:01,404 --> 01:31:02,769
HeIIo.

1254
01:31:07,844 --> 01:31:11,143
Don. You go ahead. I'II catch up to you.

1255
01:31:11,713 --> 01:31:13,011
What?

1256
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:22,583
<i>Do you know Michael Clayton?</i>

1257
01:31:22,759 --> 01:31:24,248
<i>Yeah, why?</i>

1258
01:31:24,426 --> 01:31:26,189
We have a situation.

1259
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:47,539
Hey, did they find you?

1260
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:50,743
-Who?
-Marty. I don't think they've gone in yet.

1261
01:31:58,927 --> 01:32:00,259
Marty.

1262
01:32:00,595 --> 01:32:03,792
Your phone's off. There's too much
going on for your phone to be off.

1263
01:32:03,966 --> 01:32:05,957
-I need a minute.
-Yeah, weII, we're Iate--

1264
01:32:06,135 --> 01:32:07,761
We never got to finish Iast night.

1265
01:32:07,936 --> 01:32:10,064
Did you cIose the pIace?
You Iook Iike heII.

1266
01:32:10,238 --> 01:32:13,298
-No, I Ieft right after you Ieft.
-If you say so.

1267
01:32:13,475 --> 01:32:16,171
We've been here aII night.
We had to make an announcement.

1268
01:32:16,345 --> 01:32:19,609
Jean! I need the thing, the enveIope.

1269
01:32:19,782 --> 01:32:22,979
I wanted your input. I couIdn't get you.
I had to puII the trigger.

1270
01:32:23,152 --> 01:32:26,087
I put Bob Nast and Kim,
probabIy a mistake.

1271
01:32:26,255 --> 01:32:29,587
They're gonna puII together a memoriaI
service by the end of the week.

1272
01:32:29,759 --> 01:32:32,023
I toId them to caII you
if they need any heIp.

1273
01:32:32,528 --> 01:32:35,292
No, no, no.
The other one. The other one.

1274
01:32:35,864 --> 01:32:38,162
So we cut you a check this morning.

1275
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:41,632
There's some strings attached.
And Barry....

1276
01:32:41,804 --> 01:32:45,934
There's no way around this,
Barry's gonna have to be invoIved.

1277
01:32:49,712 --> 01:32:52,145
What if Arthur was on to something?

1278
01:32:52,314 --> 01:32:53,975
What do you mean? On to what?

1279
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:57,016
U/North. What if he wasn't crazy?
What if he was right?

1280
01:32:57,185 --> 01:32:59,346
Right about what?
That we're on the wrong side?

1281
01:32:59,521 --> 01:33:01,956
Wrong side, wrong way,
everything, aII of it.

1282
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:05,060
This is news?
This case reeked from day one.

1283
01:33:05,228 --> 01:33:07,219
I gotta teII you how we pay the rent?

1284
01:33:07,395 --> 01:33:10,126
What wouId they do?
What wouId they do if he went pubIic?

1285
01:33:10,298 --> 01:33:13,699
What wouId they do? Are you fucking soft?
They're doing it.

1286
01:33:13,869 --> 01:33:16,304
We don't straighten the settIement out
in 24 hours...

1287
01:33:16,471 --> 01:33:18,530
...they're gonna withhoId
$9 miIIion in fees.

1288
01:33:18,707 --> 01:33:21,676
Then they'II puII out the video of
Arthur doing his fIashdance.

1289
01:33:21,844 --> 01:33:23,573
They'II sue us for IegaI maIpractice.

1290
01:33:23,746 --> 01:33:27,408
Except there won't be anything to win
because the London merger wiII be dead...

1291
01:33:27,582 --> 01:33:30,244
...and we'II be seIIing off
the goddamn furniture.

1292
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:32,414
That's 80.

1293
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:34,719
We're caIIing it a bonus.

1294
01:33:35,557 --> 01:33:37,582
Three-year contract
at your current numbers.

1295
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:39,386
That's assuming this aII works out.

1296
01:33:39,561 --> 01:33:40,721
You're doing this now?

1297
01:33:42,398 --> 01:33:45,730
Look, I agreed to this, okay?
But there's ruIes now.

1298
01:33:45,902 --> 01:33:48,769
You want the contract,
you sign a confidentiaIity agreement.

1299
01:33:48,938 --> 01:33:51,030
It's gonna be buIIetproof
and retroactive.

1300
01:33:51,207 --> 01:33:52,935
Because Marty's too nice to say it...

1301
01:33:53,109 --> 01:33:56,908
...but with aII you know about this pIace,
the cIients and peopIe who work here...

1302
01:33:57,078 --> 01:33:59,639
...it makes it a IittIe weird
when you ask for 80 grand.

1303
01:34:00,315 --> 01:34:03,011
If I was gonna shake anybody down,
I'd come to you...

1304
01:34:03,185 --> 01:34:05,847
...and it wouIdn't be for 80 grand.
Is this him or you?

1305
01:34:06,021 --> 01:34:08,615
-If I'm wrong, I apoIogize.
-You're way the fuck wrong.

1306
01:34:08,791 --> 01:34:10,019
So there you go.

1307
01:34:10,193 --> 01:34:11,854
Enough. Okay? Everybody.

1308
01:34:12,728 --> 01:34:14,889
He's an asshoIe, but he knows it.

1309
01:34:15,297 --> 01:34:18,563
And you're on the record.
Okay? Everybody happy?

1310
01:34:19,202 --> 01:34:21,898
-Don Jeffries is here.
-We're on the way.

1311
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:26,801
CaII Bob Nast.
Just see if they need heIp with this thing.

1312
01:34:30,378 --> 01:34:31,743
You're weIcome.

1313
01:35:24,634 --> 01:35:27,000
You said 1 2. This is 75.

1314
01:35:27,168 --> 01:35:29,329
WeII, don't get too excited.
You want a drink?

1315
01:35:29,505 --> 01:35:31,369
No. I'm working.

1316
01:35:33,809 --> 01:35:37,336
So we're square, then. No bad bIood.

1317
01:35:37,512 --> 01:35:39,207
You're just doing your job.

1318
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:40,849
That's right.

1319
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:43,512
Take it easy, Gabe.

1320
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:45,885
MichaeI.

1321
01:35:57,632 --> 01:35:59,065
<i>Check.</i>

1322
01:36:00,903 --> 01:36:02,164
<i>Check.</i>

1323
01:36:02,505 --> 01:36:05,234
-Check.
-HaIf the pot. Two hundred.

1324
01:36:05,408 --> 01:36:06,704
Two hundred to go.

1325
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:45,842
So, what happened with the bar?

1326
01:36:46,015 --> 01:36:48,039
You just had to be a rock star, huh?

1327
01:37:10,538 --> 01:37:13,302
What are you doing? You just got here.

1328
01:37:13,475 --> 01:37:15,409
Guy pIays nine hands, waIks away.

1329
01:37:15,578 --> 01:37:19,742
I scare you away? What did I do?
Did I scare you away?

1330
01:37:55,518 --> 01:37:56,576
Get out.

1331
01:37:57,953 --> 01:38:00,079
<i>Get out of the car now.</i>

1332
01:38:01,823 --> 01:38:02,813
-WaIter?
<i>-Michael.</i>

1333
01:38:02,992 --> 01:38:05,186
<i>-Michael. Thank God you're there.</i>
-Yeah.

1334
01:38:09,597 --> 01:38:11,532
You have eight...

1335
01:38:12,435 --> 01:38:15,164
<i>...six, five...</i>

1336
01:38:15,337 --> 01:38:17,668
<i>...four, three....</i>

1337
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,466
<i>Get out of the car.</i>

1338
01:38:22,912 --> 01:38:25,938
-TeII him to stay off the phone.
<i>-All right. But you're on it?</i>

1339
01:38:26,548 --> 01:38:27,981
Am I cIean?

1340
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:29,377
Just keep waIking.

1341
01:38:29,551 --> 01:38:31,782
You copy. Am I cIean?

1342
01:38:31,987 --> 01:38:34,979
Just keep moving.
He's waIking to the car.

1343
01:38:35,524 --> 01:38:39,085
<i>--to let him know you're on the way.</i>
<i>I'll get back to you with the details.</i>

1344
01:38:39,261 --> 01:38:41,694
<i>-Just give me two minutes.</i>
-I'II be in the car.

1345
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,837
<i>I didn't finish. It's in, but I don't know.</i>

1346
01:39:16,998 --> 01:39:20,560
It's Ioose. I got a puIse.
He's up there somewhere, but....

1347
01:39:22,337 --> 01:39:24,271
Let's find a way to boost the signaI.

1348
01:39:31,846 --> 01:39:35,043
-I don't know what WaIter promised you--
-A miracIe worker!

1349
01:39:35,216 --> 01:39:38,448
That's WaIter on the phone,
20 minutes ago. Direct quote, okay?

1350
01:39:38,621 --> 01:39:40,452
''I'm sending you a miracIe worker.''

1351
01:39:40,622 --> 01:39:42,283
-WeII, he misspoke.
-About what?

1352
01:39:42,457 --> 01:39:45,984
About the fact that you're the firm's fixer?
Or that you're any good at it?

1353
01:39:51,766 --> 01:39:53,701
We're up. Just got a signaI.

1354
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,926
There's nothing back this way.
What's he doing?

1355
01:40:20,095 --> 01:40:21,288
Maybe he's Iost.

1356
01:40:21,462 --> 01:40:23,260
-Wait a minute.
-That's him.

1357
01:40:26,601 --> 01:40:27,829
He was aIone, right?

1358
01:40:28,002 --> 01:40:30,801
-Yeah, I think so.
-CaII it, yes or no?

1359
01:40:33,242 --> 01:40:34,868
We gotta turn around.

1360
01:41:05,106 --> 01:41:06,734
TaIk to me.

1361
01:41:06,908 --> 01:41:08,466
It's strobing.

1362
01:41:08,644 --> 01:41:11,043
No, we're good. I think we're good.
Just keep going.

1363
01:41:26,862 --> 01:41:28,453
No, he turned. Somehow he turned.

1364
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:29,996
-Where?
-He took--

1365
01:41:30,498 --> 01:41:32,466
-He took a Ieft.
-I don't have a Ieft.

1366
01:41:42,444 --> 01:41:45,378
-East. He's southeast.
-What, so we missed it?

1367
01:41:45,546 --> 01:41:47,673
-Or the grid is wrong.
-Hang on.

1368
01:41:57,859 --> 01:42:00,555
-We gotta go back to one.
-One is what? Where's our one?

1369
01:42:00,762 --> 01:42:03,755
HaIf a miIe straight ahead.
Just keep driving. Just go.

1370
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:13,266
It says we're cIosing.
But that's west. It can't be west.

1371
01:42:13,442 --> 01:42:14,500
The signaI or the grid?

1372
01:42:14,676 --> 01:42:17,407
-It's both. It just keeps dropping out.
-Goddamn it.

1373
01:43:08,630 --> 01:43:10,096
Give me the ceII.

1374
01:43:12,634 --> 01:43:14,328
Our signaI's good.

1375
01:44:52,234 --> 01:44:53,496
What?

1376
01:44:56,137 --> 01:44:57,832
Thanks, Mickey.

1377
01:44:58,006 --> 01:44:59,667
Just get me out of here.

1378
01:45:07,381 --> 01:45:11,113
I wanna get a meeting scheduIed on this,
soon as we can. Thursday at the Iatest.

1379
01:45:11,286 --> 01:45:14,914
I think we shouId have someone from
the equity group there. Maybe McDonneII--

1380
01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:16,579
-Yeah?
-Did you hear?

1381
01:45:16,757 --> 01:45:19,283
-Yeah, yeah. They cIosed U/North.
-No. MichaeI CIayton.

1382
01:45:19,728 --> 01:45:20,786
What?

1383
01:45:20,962 --> 01:45:23,863
Car bomb. Upstate. This morning.
He was kiIIed.

1384
01:45:24,899 --> 01:45:25,923
What?

1385
01:45:27,603 --> 01:45:29,434
HoIy shit.

1386
01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:48,555
<i>It has been and it remains</i>
<i>the U/North position...</i>

1387
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:52,819
<i>...that this lawsuit is baseless</i>
<i>and without merit.</i>

1388
01:45:52,994 --> 01:45:57,055
Our reIuctance to negotiate
was anchored by this beIief...

1389
01:45:57,231 --> 01:46:02,396
...and reinforced by the pIaintiffs' demand
for settIement...

1390
01:46:02,570 --> 01:46:05,131
...in excess of 3 biIIion doIIars.

1391
01:46:05,306 --> 01:46:08,765
The reason that we are
aII here today is...

1392
01:46:08,944 --> 01:46:12,811
...that severaI key eIements
in the case have changed.

1393
01:46:13,814 --> 01:46:18,252
<i>You all have</i>
<i>a tentative proposal packet...</i>

1394
01:46:18,854 --> 01:46:22,813
<i>...which outlines the details,</i>
<i>but the bottom line is this:</i>

1395
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:25,755
<i>Over the past several months</i>
<i>we had gotten word...</i>

1396
01:46:25,927 --> 01:46:29,261
...that the pIaintiffs were
growing impatient...

1397
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:33,265
...and were in the process
of revising their settIement numbers.

1398
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:35,235
<i>We also learned...</i>

1399
01:46:35,404 --> 01:46:39,340
<i>...that the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees</i>
<i>were capped at 32 percent...</i>

1400
01:46:39,507 --> 01:46:41,600
<i>...up to 400 million dollars...</i>

1401
01:46:42,043 --> 01:46:46,275
...above which,
their fees dropped to 24 percent.

1402
01:46:46,448 --> 01:46:51,010
So we knew that there wouId be
this motivationaI dead zone for them...

1403
01:46:51,185 --> 01:46:52,516
...in the middIe there.

1404
01:46:53,287 --> 01:46:54,983
<i>Finally...</i>

1405
01:46:55,157 --> 01:46:59,490
...our finance team informed us
that they had run the numbers...

1406
01:46:59,661 --> 01:47:01,492
...and that the tax benefit...

1407
01:47:01,662 --> 01:47:04,894
...provided that we bring
the settIement in under 600 miIIion...

1408
01:47:05,067 --> 01:47:07,501
...and within this fiscaI year...

1409
01:47:07,668 --> 01:47:13,538
...that the write-off on this settIement
wouId essentiaIIy pay for itseIf.

1410
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:18,239
<i>The package that you have before you</i>
<i>represents, in my judgment...</i>

1411
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:23,480
<i>...the strongest possible position for</i>
<i>our company under the circumstances.</i>

1412
01:47:23,652 --> 01:47:25,346
<i>And, as chief counsel...</i>

1413
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:28,784
...it is my recommendation
that this proposaI be confirmed.

1414
01:47:29,858 --> 01:47:33,385
Thank you, Karen. If you just give us
a few minutes to taIk about it.

1415
01:47:33,561 --> 01:47:35,826
CertainIy. I'II be right outside.

1416
01:47:38,233 --> 01:47:39,221
WeII....

1417
01:48:02,356 --> 01:48:04,188
How'd it go in there?

1418
01:48:07,229 --> 01:48:09,423
Pretty freaky, huh?

1419
01:48:09,597 --> 01:48:12,567
Did you see Arthur?
He's wandering around here somewhere.

1420
01:48:15,103 --> 01:48:18,368
I'm kidding. Lighten up.

1421
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:23,637
You got one of these? It's a great memo.
It's an oIdie but a goodie.

1422
01:48:26,814 --> 01:48:28,282
Got your heart racing, don't I?

1423
01:48:28,449 --> 01:48:30,577
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing.

1424
01:48:30,752 --> 01:48:32,117
What do you think I'm doing?

1425
01:48:32,287 --> 01:48:34,083
The suit's over. We have a deaI.

1426
01:48:34,256 --> 01:48:36,952
Whatever that is,
it's meaningIess at this point.

1427
01:48:37,125 --> 01:48:40,787
You think? I must have gotten it wrong.
I thought you had a tentative proposaI.

1428
01:48:40,962 --> 01:48:43,157
I didn't reaIize you'd signed
aII those checks.

1429
01:48:43,331 --> 01:48:46,630
That's a drag. I got a thousand of these.
What am I gonna do with them?

1430
01:48:46,801 --> 01:48:48,132
I'm caIIing Marty.

1431
01:48:48,302 --> 01:48:50,668
Good. Good. Do it.
That's a great pIace to start.

1432
01:48:50,838 --> 01:48:53,636
Let's find out who toId him
Arthur was caIIing Anna Kysersun.

1433
01:48:53,809 --> 01:48:55,640
Let's find out who tapped those phones.

1434
01:48:55,810 --> 01:48:59,610
This memorandum, even if it's authentic,
which I doubt, I highIy doubt--

1435
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:03,216
-I know what you did to Arthur.
-It's protected. It beIongs to U/North.

1436
01:49:03,385 --> 01:49:06,149
-I know you kiIIed him.
-It's attorney-cIient priviIege.

1437
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:09,984
See, now, that's just not
the way to go here, Karen.

1438
01:49:10,158 --> 01:49:12,854
For such a smart person,
you reaIIy are Iost, aren't you?

1439
01:49:13,028 --> 01:49:14,359
This conversation is over.

1440
01:49:14,529 --> 01:49:17,965
I'm not the guy that you kiII.
I'm the guy that you buy.

1441
01:49:18,132 --> 01:49:20,658
Are you so fucking bIind
you don't even see what I am?

1442
01:49:20,836 --> 01:49:24,328
I'm the easiest part of your whoIe
goddamn probIem and you're gonna kiII me?

1443
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:27,766
Don't you know who I am?
I'm a fixer. I'm a bagman.

1444
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:31,344
I do everything from shopIifting housewives
to bent congressmen...

1445
01:49:31,512 --> 01:49:33,412
...and you're gonna kiII me?

1446
01:49:34,349 --> 01:49:37,181
What do you need, Karen? Lay it on me.

1447
01:49:37,351 --> 01:49:41,048
You want a carry permit? You want
a heads-up on an insider-trading subpoena?

1448
01:49:41,222 --> 01:49:45,056
I soId out Arthur for 80 grand
and a contract and you're gonna kiII me?

1449
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:47,993
What do you want?

1450
01:49:48,162 --> 01:49:49,686
What do I want?

1451
01:49:49,864 --> 01:49:51,457
I want more.

1452
01:49:51,966 --> 01:49:53,729
I want out.

1453
01:49:53,902 --> 01:49:56,529
And with this, I want everything.

1454
01:49:58,305 --> 01:49:59,533
Is there a number?

1455
01:49:59,707 --> 01:50:01,300
Ten is a number.

1456
01:50:01,475 --> 01:50:03,501
Ten? Ten what?

1457
01:50:05,546 --> 01:50:07,037
Ten miIIion?

1458
01:50:07,215 --> 01:50:10,650
Where do you think I'm gonna get
1 0 miIIion doIIars?

1459
01:50:11,219 --> 01:50:13,118
You know what's great about this?

1460
01:50:13,287 --> 01:50:15,586
Did you read it to the end?
You see who signed it?

1461
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:18,057
Let's go in and ask Don Jeffries...

1462
