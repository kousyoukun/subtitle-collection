1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,500
Michael, dear Michael, your you are the only one in
who can trust, already you that you the occupied raisins

2
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,700
but he/she waits, he/she waits a moment, I need
that you help me then this is not an episode.

3
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:37,900
Relax you, cono, I am begging you Michael, it tries
of believing that this is not madness, because it is not it.

4
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:48,600
Two weeks ago, I left the building, it was
well, he/she had little time to arrive at the airport

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:57,500
and a woman suddenly began to scream me, and me
I gave bill that we were in the mean of the street,

6
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:05,900
there was a violent traffic, I froze,
I could not move, suddenly I wasted away

7
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,000
with the startling sensation of
to be covered for a movie,

8
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,400
it felt it in the head, the one
hair, in the face, the clothes...

9
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Me you that it is all this Michael,
it is a force for which I am influenced

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,200
he/she has a cause, I have been
purifying, he/she was reborning...

11
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,300
Then, the traffic, the stampede of
cars, trucks, people screaming, mermaids

12
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,400
and I thought, no, this is not a rebirth, this
it is a sick illusion of what I know that it happens

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,800
in the final moment
before the rebirth.

14
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:47,400
And then I thought, no, I am mistaken, then
I looked toward behind, to the building, and I had the more

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,000
overwhelming moment of clarity, I realized that
it had not emerged the doors of the building from among

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:08,400
but of the anus of an organism that had excreted
the poison, the garbage, the necessary spoil

17
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,000
to make grow to this organism that is the one
more powerful to put an end to the human race.

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:19,900
And I had come out of that piece of
shit in the most important day in my life

19
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,900
because I understood that all that was
making should wait, so that I faced

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,400
a destination of time and
I change, and the moment is now.

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,700
How it is that you decided that if
had he/she already told you to make?

22
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:58,400
I understood that it was the best thing, because that
history will come out you like or not.

23
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,700
What is what that means?

24
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,000
It means that I can leave whenever.

25
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,100
I found the 87.

26
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,700
I have to the telephone to that of Wall
Street Journal that cannot escape.

27
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
Marty Buck in that I can help her?

28
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,700
Marty, how's it going? it is Briggite Clay, tomorrow I am
briendo the history of the case that you take, gives me alg

29
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,700
It is a case that has been being returned for 6 years,
without being solved. Until our moment

30
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,500
client has gone several times to court
without anything feasible, I don't have nothing else.

31
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,900
We go Marty, I am soaked in the case
and you know that I manage that, you that you are there

32
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,200
now with a heap of people
what I want to know screaming.

33
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,600
This is what I know, your edition closing
it was 20 min ago. so I wish you the best thing.

34
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,100
Why cono is this filled this way?

35
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,100
I see your bet.

36
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,100
Step.

37
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,200
Step.

38
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,600
Step.

39
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,500
It is closed. 200. 20 more to win.

40
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,900
Don't you remind me, hey?

41
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,000
We play a couple of times together.

42
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,600
In that place in the tower,
in the living room of exhibitions...

43
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,400
- In "Galaxy."
- Exact.

44
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:45,700
You had a restaurant in that
then certain? Don't you remind me?

45
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,900
I don't remind you.

46
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,900
It seems that you have lost
some money.

47
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,600
I have also lost some hair

48
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,900
iEra your money!

49
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,800
What did it pass with the bar? Him
did you have to sell hey?

50
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,500
Shit if he/she wanted to listen Larry
King, I leave home and I light the puto TV.

51
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,700
That era a good lease.

52
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,500
If, that was what my partner told me.

53
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
It is for you another time.

54
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello.

55
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,800
- Michael?
- Walter.

56
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,700
Michael, thanks to God that these there, I have
a great problem, a client has just called

57
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,900
saying that it hit to a type with the car.
- Right now?

58
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,300
- If, he/she makes as 20 min. it is in their house waiting
- Where?

59
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,200
You the control now, still
I am half sleeping.

60
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,900
- Was it drunk?
- No, up to where I know it was sober.

61
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,000
- Then I hope you call me.
- Michael, be in charge of, this he/she is a great client.

62
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,300
- I go right now toward the car.
- He/she looks, now I go you to envíar the address.

63
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,400
Then you call me to know that you are in
I walk, and later you give me the details.

64
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
I will be in the car.

65
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,500
I have these lights that are wider in the
remain silent. Somebody told me that they were the best.

66
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:52,300
But when it rains, or there is fog, the light that
they give, it changes you the angle, they blind you completely

67
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,400
- Not I believe that that will work.
that of tonight, how many times we have not spoken

68
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,300
Sr. Greed, we don't have a lot of time.

69
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,300
It means that the circumstances and those
ondiciones of the time not important som for you

70
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,900
Take into account that the authorities
they can arrive in the next 50 min.

71
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,600
That doesn't sound very well.

72
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,400
- We have good you relate here.
- And what is that you make.?

73
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,600
- Lawyer's type?
- Not of the type that you. he/she needs.

74
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,900
- Of what type is it?
- A lawyer of tribunals.

75
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,800
Somebody can see this
from their point, but me not.

76
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,800
I believe that it is time that Walter appears.
I want that Walter is who is in charge of.

77
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,600
I don't feel comfortable with you. neither me
it likes like the situation is unwrapped.

78
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,200
Not we have time for Walter their
options are to value them quickly.

79
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,300
What options? iNo
I am listening none!

80
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I make him/her a suggestion, I know people
here that it can be in charge of of the case.

81
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,400
With which that is what has
for my, can you believe it?

82
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,000
I am an associate client for 20 years, he/she believes
that paying my quotas every month, now

83
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,000
simply they can me
to put at the end of the line.

84
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Sr. Greed, You. he/she abandoned the scene in
a calm night, to only 6 miles

85
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,700
of the station of policemen. Believe me,
You. he/she has the whole spot of guilty.

86
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:15,700
I can get a lawyer when me of the desire
I don't need it for anything. Not I have waited 45 min.

87
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,200
to listen a damned affray.

88
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,300
- Look, I don't know that Walter promised him/her but...
- A type that makes miracles.

89
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,700
That was what told me to the telephone, he/she makes 20 min.
, I will send you to a type that makes miracles.

90
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,500
- Not he/she spoke well.
That you will help me, because not him these making

91
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:41,600
iEl type was running, in the street!
You have that of the lights, the rain, the angle...

92
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,500
What cono toward running in the
do remain silent to midnight? Respond me that.

93
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:09,100
How's it going if somebody is stolen
the car? That could work.

94
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,100
The police would arrive running until
here, X would clear quickly.

95
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,500
With the marks of painting, tomorrow they will be
looking for the owner of the exclusive colored car

96
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:28,600
to the pleasure, that, together with the type that you hit,
and the badges, he/she would not take a lot of time.

97
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,800
This is not a game, not
it cares the angle neither the rest.

98
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,400
Not I am the type that ago
miracles, I am as a porter.

99
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,600
The mathematics is made, I am
here, to clean what is dirty.

100
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:52,800
- That is... the police?
- No, they don't call.

101
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Hello.

102
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:11,300
Jill is Michael Clayton. He/she looks, I sit down it, not,
am I in the neighborhood, do you have with which to score?.

103
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,800
FOUR DAYS BEFORE

104
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,600
Mom, where are my postcards?

105
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,900
Where are my postcards?

106
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,800
- Is my video I play here?
- Have you eaten something?

107
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,100
- If, I already had breakfast.
- But if you have just left the bathroom.

108
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,300
- I already ate up my cereal.
- From when you eat so quick?

109
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,700
It is a miracle.

110
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,100
He/she hears...

111
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,200
iHenry!

112
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,700
We go.

113
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,600
He/she enters.

114
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,800
Care.

115
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,400
Those lands don't belong to anybody,
because there are not limits neither opposite neither anything.

116
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,700
And they have to all the
people tied in the town.

117
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:23,000
The other ones hide in the forests for
to save their lives, there it is where they are well.

118
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:32,300
There is bewitching, soldiers, warriors
indestructible, and more, they are 15 different characters

119
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,500
And none has alliances with the other one.

120
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:45,700
You cannot even say who are, because perhaps
the other one is the enemy, and they take you as prisoner

121
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100
- I find that family.
- It is very good, I speak seriously, you should read it.

122
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,800
- You should take it to the house.
- How much do I space you have?

123
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,200
It depends of as much as you have.

124
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,500
- You will be able to me to say later.
- Révisaré in my pigeonhole.

125
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,500
- I no longer know where I go him to
to put. - The book? - If.

126
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,200
- Take it to the house on Saturday.
- I already made it, I left it in the kitchen and they discovered it.

127
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,200
Here we go, teach them to
this people what you have.

128
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,800
- I will see you then.
- OK.

129
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,800
Thank you.

130
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,600
I not Object. 52, bowls of
to mix, we begin with 30...

131
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,600
He/she says that it is still sure.

132
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,600
How sure?

133
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,800
- 65 thousand.
- With liquidity and everything?

134
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,800
- How more it could be?
minus, 30, 20, 15 thousand and I am dry, I paid 4 thousand po

135
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Make a piece.

136
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,900
Do you want to tell me that you don't have 65 thousand?

137
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,700
Right now I don't have them.

138
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,900
You know well that he/she is your brother who aqí should be
- I know it.

139
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:51,300
Michael, looks, if you where it is,
I don't have to continue asking.

140
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,500
- I already discovered, their wife doesn't know where you/he/she is.
- She has to have something.

141
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:04,200
If, the one had two children with her, he/she has Jennifer
the salesperson of coca that has been stolen 3 radios

142
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:10,500
of the garage of my
it mates... Make me an offer.

143
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,400
I had a wife that was drunk, young
and beautiful, I pass a two year-old program,

144
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,600
and when you came out him/her
he/she forgot to the two days...

145
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:34,100
- How long do I have?
- I don't know it, I don't believe that it is a problem...

146
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,200
- Good day Mike.
- Good day Carl.

147
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,400
Not I know, but, I don't have idea of as much as they want that
press, neither how brave they want to show themselves...

148
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,600
Alone we have to confirm
who will be the elect of the month.

149
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,100
Her that knows?

150
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,100
Good, it is in the
does it press, who does know?...

151
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,500
My intuition tells me that they go her
to leave outside of the condominium.

152
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,000
We go, like you will say that.

153
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,000
Good, we can allege that
it is won the life like nudist.

154
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,100
You are incredible.

155
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,700
We will discover of this
assembly, and you call me of turn.

156
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,400
- Where were we with Marty?
- We leave it to Warren.

157
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,600
- Does he/she wait, does he/she repeat, how old is the boy?
- Not he/she is a boy he/she has 22.

158
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,800
- Is that Miami?
- No, Key Biscaine.

159
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,700
- And did they accuse him?
- Of high danger.

160
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,700
I believe that what you/they really want is
a change in the lawyer's declaration.

161
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,000
- Allow me to send you some connections...
- I will score, he/she waits. - If, thank you.

162
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,600
- If he/she called directly to INS he/she won't go to any side.
- Still with the concerted appointment?

163
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,600
The evidence is retained, he/she would have to speak
with their supervisor, and everybody still.

164
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,700
- But, You. can they make that?
- Is a formal petition?

165
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,500
- I can call again and...
- He/she looks, I am me who he/she wants to ask...

166
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,900
- Can you wait a moment?
- If, clear.

167
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Are we annexing ourselves?

168
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,100
Marty returned to London.

169
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,700
First said that it was in Atlanta, so
I called of turn, he/she knew that you wanted this meeting,

170
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,500
and now he/she told me the truth,
it is truly in London.

171
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,800
Then we are annexing Ourselves?
That is what all say, with everything

172
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,200
this situation seems
that now he/she goes seriously.

173
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,900
- I don't really know it.
- But if this way outside would not affect us or if?

174
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,400
The telephone is sounding.

175
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:20,900
Kevin, if, this is what I will make,
I will make you a call next week...

176
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,400
At this time we have 70 thousand employees,
and representations in 62 countries.

177
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,900
Around the planet... Operating
in 62 countries around the planet.

178
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,000
Working in more than 60
countries around the world...

179
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,900
We have, we have now...

180
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,100
At this time we have 75 thousand employees
in more than 60 countries around the planet

181
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,000
We are very successful in the handling of companies,
so it will imagine, the volume and variety

182
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,700
of legal problems with
those that we have to try...

183
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,600
Startling...

184
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,500
So it can imagine the one
volume of legal matters...

185
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,400
It is very substantial...

186
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:26,500
And general consultant's position that is it that
I make, good, that makes our department

187
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,700
it is to analyze the focus of the problem or the
opportunity to determine the jurisdiction

188
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,800
and to take our business toward those
instances to those that can help us well.

189
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,700
Then, with all that pressure, and that flow of
do I work, how do they balance career and personal life?

190
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:52,900
I believe that that is... something that
searches during all your life...

191
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,400
it is question of alternating
limits... you attempt...

192
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:08,900
When you are really focused, what
is that faces? who does need limits?

193
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,100
There your limits are, when really
you enjoy that faces, those they are your limits.

194
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:24,900
Don Jeffrey brought me here 12 years ago,
it trusted my, it was my mentor, he/she gave me the

195
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:34,200
welcome to the family "OR North ", and when
he/she moved to the address, I never thought really

196
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
that he/she would have the opportunity
of taking their position.

197
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:46,600
What if it is a challenge? If, I think that it is possible
ue trembles at the beginning, but then you give yourself cuant

198
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,700
that you are really clever, and you take
it makes aware, because still when you don't sit down cómod

199
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,700
with the level of responsibility, it doesn't mean that
you are in the mistaken place, it is your department

200
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
your capacity, to take
serious decisions in realtime...

201
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,300
Why amid the interview?

202
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,100
They said that it was urgent.

203
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,100
God.

204
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Oh for the Love of God.

205
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,600
You say that he/she made it outside.

206
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,100
- Oh My God.
- Gary.

207
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,600
A moment.

208
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:27,400
My client this discussing nude,
on a deposition in Milwaukee.

209
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,900
Michael, I have taken a deep respiration, me him
that I tell myself to myself it is so clear, as him

210
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:45,900
that I witnessed in today's day, I should
to face this destination of time and destruction

211
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:52,800
Michael, the time is now, this moment,
today, here, this room, this air,

212
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:01,400
and especially Michael your presence here.
There is a reason, and you are your Michael, I am sure

213
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:09,900
I sit down it inside, our crop, the
people of the hidden sense, tell me that you can see it

214
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,400
Michael for the Love of God.

215
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,800
If, if, the nudism in the parking, I admit it
that was an error, it was mistaken, it was obvious

216
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,000
and seemingly it was useless completamentamente,
because Michael believes me, I can tolerate here

217
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,500
until I am fallen the skin. Not me
I will give in to dress this thing.

218
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:39,300
Six years, six years of this poison, 400
depositions, 100 more, 5 measure changes,

219
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:46,400
85 documents without revising, 6 years of robbery, and
to steal and screams, and what is what I have?

220
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,200
The more I have to wait
defending the reputation of that dead one.

221
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,600
- We had an agreement Arthur.
- One night, certain?

222
00:27:54,100 --> 00:28:00,900
I saw the face of Marty in my office, with one
otellla of champagne, telling me uqe wanted he/she takes place

223
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:10,200
there we were with thrown two prostitutes,
while they took turns to suck me the hooter

224
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:17,700
I wanted to stay calmed, to seem with
class, so I began to make my numbers...

225
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:30,900
- Arthur...
- No, he/she doesn't wait, because they are years, they are lives...

226
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:39,500
The numbers get dizzy me, it was about staying
calmed, of not thinking, and it could not stop, he/she thought

227
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,900
I am me, or I am this strange organism that you/they sent
here to sleep and to eat, and I defended this

228
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,700
my thought of
to face my destination...

229
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:58,800
- Your you promised me...
Michael, is that my right, two prostitutes hit to my

230
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,000
- Not you want to take your medicine, iestá well! but
you should call me first, our era agreement.

231
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:09,900
- We are very there inside.
- We are well.

232
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:21,700
they killed, those small peasants. You have seen to
- No.

233
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,800
You have to see it, to look for him/her a Dr. her
it is a miracle, he/she is a perfect creature.

234
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,900
I spent 50 million dollars, half of my life,
destroying perfect Ana, their dead parents

235
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,800
and their dying brother.
- When was the last time that you took these?

236
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,200
The world is this way more beautiful and
illuminated, I don't need to take those.

237
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,700
- These pills won't harm you.
- iTengo bleeds in my hands!

238
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,600
You are one of the signature lawyers but
respectable in the world, you are a legend.

239
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,700
- I was an accomplice.
- You are a depressive maniac.

240
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,300
- I tremble before the god of the death.
- We will give a turn and to speak of this.

241
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:09,700
We return of the hospital, and
all were like in shock...

242
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:20,900
- And when they went to the place...
We find a body, my sister found it.

243
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,600
- He/she found your mother...
- If.

244
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:30,000
You could please read this, alone
the paragraphs that are stood out.

245
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:42,500
- Not I want them to accuse from this to anybody more...
- Anna please continues...

246
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,600
What is that ago?

247
00:30:50,500 --> 00:31:01,400
I sing you, I bless you, and you
I say that I love you and I swear you...

248
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,200
I believe that that is everything.

249
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,900
- When can we begin?
- He/she said that he/she would return in half hour.

250
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:58,900
Here, four minutes before beginning...

251
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,400
Please he/she brings the coffee now.

252
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,600
Who this type is Clayton Of
Had New York never heard of the one?

253
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:15,800
Michael Raymond Clayton, born the 9 of septiembr
of 1959 in the Hospital of Jersey, New York

254
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:24,200
Their father was police, called Raymod Clayton, the
mother Mary Alice Clayton. He/she graduated of high school

255
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:31,900
in Washington, and he/she comes to N. York in 1977,
Graduated in the University Jones. Of the 82 at the 86

256
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:40,700
he/she worked in the office of Lawyers of Queens,
in 1986 it enters in the lines of the fight against

257
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,800
the crime in the city of Manhatthan.
- Is partner then?

258
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:58,500
qílo special consultant, specializes in testament
- He/she has made that work and he/she is not still partner.

259
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:04,200
That is man's class of the one that
you wonder: " Who is this type?"

260
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,700
He/she closes the door.

261
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,000
Nobody, nobody had
does he/she devise that the one came?

262
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,900
To Milwaukee for a sworn declaration?

263
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:38,200
This is very simple, he/she has a desbalance
chemical and this taking medication, with luck

264
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,700
we will have a margin of two or three
days. Now allow me to put it very clear,

265
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,800
What happens here, stays in this habitacón,
this it is not an information that one will be able to share

266
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,600
if somebody has some problem
that he/she says it now. Well.

267
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,600
I will be here the whole night and
some tomorrow if I can.

268
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Who is in charge of the chronogram of the declaration
- Me.

269
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
- How do we go with her?
- I believe that it is loose, we don't know that to make.

270
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,200
Anything is loose, stay in what you were
making, the other one leaves he/she will speak with N York.

271
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,800
- I need the suitcase.
- When I was there, I didn't see it.

272
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,400
- Neither it is in the room?
- Perhaps Judy took it.

273
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,000
Find it.

274
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:32,300
What are people? You know that that
is it a to look for to the guardian spirit?

275
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:44,800
- If, I believe that it is as a special dream.
it is as if a lot of people were in the same suo

276
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,800
They don't know that it means alone
they have the feeling of going there.

277
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,600
That is the I surrender of the one
Thursday, about the conquest.

278
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
- They know
do they share the same dream?

279
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:16,300
No, that it is the good part that you/they are been able to
until returning crazy, and they don't want to admit it.

280
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,800
- But they are not crazy or if?
- No, it is real.

281
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:32,800
If, this happening, truth? something bigger
that them for what you/they are not prepared.

282
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,700
- What do you make, to who you speak to him/her?
- I called to a friend your you don't know it.

283
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,600
- Hello.
- I have to hang now.

284
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:03,700
- No, does he/she wait, which is it the I title of the book?
- "Realm and Conquest" is red on the outside.

285
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,500
- Give me the telephone.
- I have to leave, we speak to each other then.

286
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,200
If, thank you Henry, thank you.

287
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,000
- Hello I am Michael Clayton.
- You arrive late.

288
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,300
I know it, it is that it is more complicated of that than I thought
- Where is the, should he/she come at 5:30 o'clock?

289
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,900
- He/she is sleeping.
- Good, wake up him.

290
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:02,100
That won't happen it is very sedado. Once
return with their regular treatment, we will have time

291
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,100
- Has he/she seen it is video?
- I listened of her.

292
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:13,900
What did it pass after what said? This is not
normal, a people running toward the cars

293
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,000
dressing alone a couple of stockings. "I sit down it
a lot, a lot, I won't be able to keep the secret

294
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,700
What a much more time" that means?
- Not I am sure.

295
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,400
- Were you with the the whole time, what did he/she tell you?
- Not he/she had much sense...

296
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,400
This is completely unacceptable. It is
of an action of 3 trillion dollars.

297
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,200
In the morning I should call to my commission, for
to tell him/her that the support of our defense

298
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,100
it was arrested to run nude during
a storm of snow, in a parking.

299
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,400
I understand.

300
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,400
- Of what illness are you speaking?
- I don't know it can be it any thing.

301
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,000
- Give me one.
- It bit him a bug.

302
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,700
- Do you believe that this is amusing?
- Their sick wife died last year,

303
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,500
their daughter doesn't speak to him/her, you/he/she is very
alone, everything that makes it is your case.

304
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,900
- You jumped their medication, he/she had a bad day, it is everything.
- Do you have some type of authority in this?

305
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:18,300
8 years ago I was there, I helped him in the house,
and I saw it improve. You didn't hire him for a lunatic

306
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:25,500
to regulate, you made it because he/she is a murderer, it is
brilliant, and because this the sufficiently insane thing

307
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,800
as to tolerate their condemnation without
to take a rest for 6 years.

308
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,900
- Excuse but the pay is high.
- But you wanted an explanation.

309
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,700
In case he/she wants
to cooperate, he/she already knows as making it.

310
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,800
It is more than quiet, since
he/she took the pill he/she makes 50 min.

311
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,000
- Does it seem that it is quite strong hey?
A super drug, any thing that happens, me ago

312
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,400
I will make it sure.

313
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,600
- Did you dress her?
- To the one who?

314
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,700
- Anna.
- No.

315
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,500
- I have not seen it.
- You need to make it.

316
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:43,000
- She won't understand because they arrested me.
- NOT I believe that he/she has it to you to explain.

317
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,400
- Everything is lost, they have what you/they wanted.
- Allow it to happen.

318
00:39:51,100 --> 00:40:04,700
Is this what you want, to be a porter? To live
this way. Make what you know how to make. Not it can be...

319
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:17,700
It is a passage what I am about telling you, as
Sally Field said... I know that we have been...

320
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,100
He/she sleeps a little.

321
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,100
- Hello.
- If, this Vern somewhere around?

322
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,300
- Who did give him/her Not this.?
Flock gave it to me, he/she told me that he/she could call in cualquien

323
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,000
- Does he/she have the code?
- Here this.

324
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:08,500
Excuse, here I have it, 12 B K
R 6. Can it communicate with Vern?

325
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,700
- With SR. Vern.
- If, SR. Vern, is that it is very late.

326
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,500
He/she doesn't tell him/her that I addressed familiarly him. Not I am
very sure of like this works.

327
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:24,800
- You Have. the Email of the office?
- I have it.

328
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,200
favor gives me a moment to arrive until the desk
- OK, thank you.

329
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,900
...marketing of Culcitate...

330
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,000
...I damage in the human fabric...

331
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,200
...exhibition potentially lethal...

332
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:13,800
I wondered if, he/she had some opportunity
of an adjustment of time in the condemnation...

333
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,500
There is a bar, a kitchen, great space...

334
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,000
What do you make Arthur?

335
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,100
iArthur!

336
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,900
Arthur abbre the door.

337
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,800
Arthur opens the door.

338
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,700
iArthur opens the damned door!

339
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,900
iArthur! iAbre the jodida door!

340
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,300
MAKE BELIEVE THAT THIS NOT IS SIMPLE MADNESS.

341
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,000
- Sr. Roland how's it going?
- They arrived early, it was there behind.

342
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,000
- Please, leave everything, there is
change of plans. - Seriously? - If.

343
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,700
For the Love of God. Don Jeffreys
it signed this, it is really their signature.

344
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:22,100
- Where is the original?
- We had a fire, and we lost it.

345
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,000
What cono it is it that
this making with Arthur?

346
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,100
I don't know it Marty, I thought that
perhaps your you could tell me.

347
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,900
- What is what we are looking for?
- Any thing that he/she says OR North.

348
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,500
I want everything that
pack everything and they send it to me.

349
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,200
Here Michael are.

350
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:12,500
He/she requested a limousine for those
three toward the Airport of Newark.

351
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,800
It is a Loft there are not doors neither walls.

352
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,800
Basically it can be where he/she wants.

353
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,100
Not it was a good idea
to take it to that Loft.

354
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:27,000
- Where can it stop?
- Not I know, Spain, India.

355
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:36,600
Lars, is a lunatic that it cares where
this. We will have problems, and you know it.

356
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,200
He/she was taking care of it.

357
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,500
a small problem to maintain the things under
- A small problem?

358
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,000
He needs to be assisted of
immediate, to be treated immediately.

359
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,900
- If, where?
- Does that maybe care?

360
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:53,600
Michael, you know that where only this first floor control
it is in an installation, he/she needs to be comforted.

361
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,800
- That won't be so easy.
- Why not?

362
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,200
Because the laws in the state of N. York is
very hard with those made involuntary.

363
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:04,100
- Not you did dress it is to tape?
- Not I discuss with you, I tell you like it is.

364
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:11,600
For that don't discover which are
the worst made psychiatric.

365
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,400
I can say it, he/she is Arthur.

366
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,700
This is the it schemes of messages, if
he/she wants to leave one, make it after the tone...

367
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,200
Arthur lifts the telephone.

368
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,300
Arthur, catches the telephone and you speak to me.

369
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,900
No, you won't make it.

370
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,600
Arthur forgets what yesterday passed in the
tomorrow, it doesn't care, some day we will laugh at that

371
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,300
but you have to call me
of turn, soon.

372
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:47,900
Arthur, your you know that this is
a madness both we know it,

373
00:47:50,700 --> 00:48:01,300
If, the situation stinks and the case and OR north also,
Arthur listens to me that I tell you that these in him

374
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:07,300
certain about what we are, said that
you were crazy and outside of control, but I am of

375
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,500
agreement in that we are porters.

376
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:22,900
We arrive to this, we make decisions that I happen
in the night that you decided to change the miracles.

377
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:34,800
Arthur, we go, he/she catches the telephone, he/she speaks with me,
because what is that these thinking, you have

378
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,300
that to leave me that he/she helps you, of porter
to porter, I don't do more anybody with one

379
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:43,900
broom in the horizon, I am me, partner...

380
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:49,600
- Hello.
- Hello Ana is?

381
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,400
A moment.

382
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,500
iAnna!

383
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,000
Anna has a call.

384
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,400
- Hello.
- Ana hello, he/she is Arthur.

385
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,200
- Were you sleeping?
- If.

386
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,000
- Did you think of what we speak?
- If.

387
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:42,200
- Have not you told to anybody?
- No, my sister thinks that you/he/she is normal.

388
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,300
- Because I didn't lie in anything of loq ue I said.
- I know it.

389
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,700
Alone that 4050 people, in this,
why did you choose me to my?

390
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:00,900
- Not him you, am I crazy, not?
- Sure.

391
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:11,000
I really care this, he/she waited to know
to somebody, and suddenly you looked at me and everything changed

392
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,800
anything was again or same later.

393
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Is it for my OK? also receipt calls.

394
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:31,500
- I sit down it.
- Not it cares, my mother made me the same thing.

395
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:48,300
This is something that we can share,
that we can make together if your you want.

396
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:56,200
- I have you 12 for Monday.
- 12 won't be enough.

397
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,900
- And what did it happen?
- They look for 65, they come you and they say there is not problem"

398
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,600
but now you appear with 12
and people become nervous.

399
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,800
But that was yesterday, I have to put
in order my taxes and everything.

400
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,300
- And the car?
- It is leased.

401
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,700
Good, you can go to the bank, you have
the apartment, you have to finance.

402
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,800
- Me liked hubisese to make it three months ago.
- Were you betting?

403
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,800
I wanted to leave it but
it was stronger than me.

404
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:32,900
- You have to help me.
If you knew how to play letters with their money, iarreglatelas

405
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:43,400
Do us a favor to all,
jump of that and he/she begins to pay.

406
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:56,800
It was to the telephone all the
tomorrow, 50 minutes, it is up...

407
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,100
Marty?

408
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:28,600
You know that he/she makes, this cooking the case, revise
in all these papers, it is founding a case

409
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,700
against OR North.
- Not he/she can make that.

410
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,800
Why not? Who
will demons stop them?

411
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:43,400
That woman from the tomb will be a
perfect plaintiff, is a nightmare.

412
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,900
I have been about leaving a
message in the answering machine.

413
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:53,000
- Is that the handbag?
- We were looking for it in their office.

414
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:59,800
Not I know, it was with the restoi of the documents,
he/she could not believe the garbage that there is there.

415
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,500
I need a loan.
I owe some big ones.

416
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,600
- Not I can believe that you have bet.
- Not it is that, it is the restaurant.

417
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,900
- 8 thousand.
to make this but I won't obtain a credo so

418
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:29,700
- You about the coalition that should not be.
- Not there is such a coalition.

419
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:37,300
For that reason I am requesting it to you. Not I want
that no stranger knows about my situation.

420
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:43,000
- Everybody knows it Michael.
- I am 45 years old and I am in crash.

421
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,200
I have loaded a he/she arms for 12 years and not
I am an equal, I am not comforted.

422
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Nobody told you that you
you put in that business.

423
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,300
I opened it to look for an exit.

424
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,500
NOT I have idea of for
that you are so unhappy.

425
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
How many times I requested you that
me pisieras in the commission?

426
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,600
- Anyone can go to the court.
- iYo was good in that!

427
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:06,800
As a lot of people. In
this makes, you are brilliant.

428
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:14,500
For heaven's sake Michael has something that all
they want, you have made yourself of a place for you.

429
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:22,000
But you are not as and you wanted to return to your
comfortable life in Queens, I tell you a thing, he/she leaves that

430
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,900
I have seen cases like yours before.
- But I have never disappointed you.

431
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,600
He/she looks, I give you the loan, and
you solve Arthur's problem.

432
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:37,700
- iYo didn't say that!
- No, perhaps you didn't have to say it.

433
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:45,000
Not I know as you these occupying of this, but
this, is cancer, we will be in problems

434
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,800
if we don't get rid of
this as soon as possible.

435
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,400
- What do you tell me?
- For this date of next week

436
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,300
Arthur will be in control of everything, and
they will go to you everybody who he/she needs you.

437
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:16,300
He/she hears, as you have become so delicate...

438
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,500
Dad, I need you to throw a help...

439
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,400
- How much do we lack?
- Not you.

440
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:11,900
If it returns, he/she calls to that
number and you tell it to me.

441
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,200
- Ok.
- Thank you, I thank him/her for it.

442
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,900
If we don't go to the cinema for
that you don't say it and already.

443
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
- What?
- I want to leave home.

444
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,400
Calm down.

445
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,400
He/she waits.

446
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,200
Stay here and he/she closes the door.

447
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,500
Arthur.

448
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:46,900
He/she waits.

449
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,900
You scared me.

450
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,400
- Do you make a delivery?
- No, not.

451
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,800
No, anything of that, takes, he/she takes this.

452
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,200
This hot one still,
it is the one better than I have eaten.

453
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,200
Welcome to house.

454
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,400
You that of the hotel, I sit down it.

455
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,600
I felt a little overwhelmed.

456
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,500
- Do you feel better now?
- If, if better.

457
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,000
But he/she doesn't stop to call me.

458
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,400
It was being about organizing my ideas.

459
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,700
Before calling yourself, that toward.

460
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,400
- How does that go?
- Well, very well.

461
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,900
Alone I need to think it better.

462
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,200
That is my goal.

463
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,500
Although it feels well,
you know to where we go.

464
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,500
No, no, these mistaken one, that that you
well it is that one doesn't know to where he/she goes.

465
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,100
How do I speak to you so that you listen to me?

466
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
As to a boy, or an idiot,
as that all this well.

467
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,500
Which the secret is because
do I need you to listen to me?

468
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,100
I listen everything.

469
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,700
Because he/she listens this. You need help,

470
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,200
...before it is too much
take, you need help.

471
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,700
You have green card here, if you have
clothes can make what you want.

472
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,500
If you want to leave, you can make it,
if you want to make bread, you can make it.

473
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:19,400
Alone there is an exposed one in all this,

474
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,500
...you have your tied arms.

475
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,300
I said that it felt it.

476
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,300
You believe that that of the hotel is overwhelming.

477
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,000
It follows jodiendo the case
and they cut you a piece.

478
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,700
NOT you that you speak.

479
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,700
Let us get tired of covering, of
to tell them that all this well.

480
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,100
That all will be well, I am the one
that he/she is counting that history,

481
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,600
...that all listen and me
I wake up today and I listen that,

482
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,700
...you called to this girl of Wisconcin
and that these changing the documents.

483
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,800
- And God knows that but...
- How do you know that?

484
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,100
They can take off everything, your part
in the society, your interests.

485
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,900
- They can take off the license.
- How do you taste like who calls?

486
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,600
- How do you know that I told him/her?
- Marty told it to me.

487
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,200
- Do you deny it?
- How do you know it?

488
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,200
Not you and I don't care it.

489
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,800
They are recording my calls.

490
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,300
I want you to explain to me it,
say I eat up Marty he/she knows it.

491
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,700
Because you entered to a
parking, behind of a girl,

492
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,100
...for a parking,
with your polla hanging.

493
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,000
Not you believe that it would hang with you
and would he/she call to anyone?

494
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,700
She would not make that, him you.

495
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,700
You believe that your trial is now the best.

496
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,100
This everything in game.

497
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:24,500
You have to think it well all.

498
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:28,100
I will help you in that, I will look for
to somebody that helps you.

499
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,700
Not make this, him him
these making but easy.

500
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,700
Michael, I have you a lot of affection.

501
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,800
And your you take a life
very interesting and rich.

502
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,900
But you are not an of the heap a lawyer.

503
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,500
If your intention was
to stay committed.

504
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,300
Me taenias that to have
left in Winsconsin.

505
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,600
Where the reports, those are
recordings in video, the witnesses.

506
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:53,200
And with an appropriate behavior,
he/she had had artificial relevance.

507
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,700
NOT I have any report
in the state of New York.

508
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,100
And a single approach for a
imprisonment is dangerous.

509
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,300
He/she is maybe the accused, a watering
for the same one or for others?

510
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,200
Do you believe that you have everything for that reason?

511
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,000
Good, good luck for that reason,
and that God blesses you, but...

512
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,100
The last place that me
you want to see it is in the court.

513
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,600
Not I am the enemy.

514
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,900
Then who are?

515
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,800
We find the seed.

516
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,900
We fix the floor

517
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,500
We accelerate the crop.

518
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,400
We feed to the planet.

519
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:39,300
What devils ago?

520
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,800
It has communicated with the mail of
voice, please leave its message.

521
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,100
If, here we are.

522
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,000
All listening are? Well
they have been waiting for this reason.

523
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:15,800
A very special piece
of this document.

524
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,800
So demos some hot applause,

525
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,500
...for UNFC, the memorandum
of investigation 229.

526
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,600
Of June 19 of 1991, conclusions.

527
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:34,500
The inadvertent decrecimiento of
the crops for small farms.

528
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,400
It requires immediately
benefit and analysis.

529
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,400
Do they want some legal advice?

530
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,500
Never let a scientist to use
the inadvertent and immediate words,

531
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,400
...in the same sentence, ok, ok.

532
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:56,800
The local studies indicate that those
small crops depend on the water.

533
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,300
And that the human consumption this in watering
for the consumption of toxic particles.

534
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,400
At levels, able to make
severe damages in the fabric.

535
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,500
This is a form but he/she abuts of saying,

536
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,400
...that they don't have to leave of
he/she marries so that the dull thing a product.

537
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,500
We will put it in the one
sink of their kitchen.

538
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,800
It is an advantage in the market.

539
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,300
It is not toilet, insipid
he/she has color and he/she doesn't throw.

540
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,900
It is able to mask and to intensify,

541
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,100
...these lethal intense exhibitions.

542
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,700
I like this, and not
alone it is a great product,

543
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,200
...it is an I magnify system
of cancer supply.

544
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,600
Chemical modifications
of this product,

545
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:41,800
...or the addition of a molecule
as a deodorant or a coloring.

546
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,200
It would require another design
of another producer.

547
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,600
These causes that don't seem to be
significant, they are not summarized here.

548
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,400
In other words, it cost
a fortune make it again.

549
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,100
It is almost impossible.

550
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,100
So somebody would rot
but to take this dedición.

551
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,900
Clearly the revelation of
these external documents,

552
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,100
...it would commit the effect
in the market of the product.

553
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,300
And it would not agree with
the protocols of UNFTSL.

554
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,800
You don't need me
to know that it is that.

555
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,100
Good-bye.

556
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,500
- It seems that...
- If.

557
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:33,100
You have to stop this.

558
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,700
- To stop?
- If.

559
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,700
That is my question.

560
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:43,800
What that option has?

561
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,000
In those lines.

562
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,800
Languages of the paper, of the data?

563
01:05:50,500 --> 01:05:53,700
Good I wonder if there is another option.

564
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
Something in what I have not thought.

565
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,900
We face sure things.

566
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,100
Ok, I understand that, I make it.

567
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
With the material, the papers, not
I am a lawyer but we can try,

568
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,200
...of making something.

569
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,200
And the other form?

570
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,800
This is the other form.

571
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,700
Maybe you want to involve to Don.

572
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,500
This doesn't have anything to do with the one.

573
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,100
The this busy one, doesn't have anything to see.

574
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,800
Do you believe that one can make?

575
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:37,400
If, we have good ideas,
if you say that if we make it.

576
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:41,400
And if it doesn't seem well, us
we toss behind and we see...

577
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,000
Ok.

578
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,900
This well? This well that we proceed?

579
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,000
We go, we go.

580
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,500
We go, we go.

581
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:09,200
Pope, requests a desire.

582
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,600
I fear that what requests me kills.

583
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,200
Do you have time for him cake?

584
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,700
If, if, give me something.

585
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,100
Do you go it stops there?

586
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:36,000
- If, I already go late.
- Shit.

587
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,000
Not say bad word.

588
01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:40,400
- I have a problem.
- And the other ones?

589
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,100
- Your you will go.
- If?

590
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,400
- I have a shift.
- Me also.

591
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:47,200
We go non leaves in months.

592
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,900
It returns, Henry stays here.

593
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,700
Well, you bring it of turn.

594
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:55,500
Alone you stay a little but.

595
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,300
To see this.

596
01:07:57,900 --> 01:07:59,600
It will ALREADY be sleeping for that.

597
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,600
This alone.

598
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:11,100
- He/she is you afraid.
- It would should.

599
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,300
- That is not so bad.
- Did he/she already tell you?

600
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,800
The boys are crazy, all they are.

601
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:21,500
Pamy doesn't stop to cry.

602
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,800
Hey she picked up it.

603
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,100
And what? For the children.

604
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,000
No, no, to the devil with the one.

605
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,400
Anything this closed one, I sold
everything less the walls.

606
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,900
So you don't speak to me
of Pammy and the boys.

607
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,900
I have my full hands.

608
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:38,700
If you were your you would be tired.

609
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,400
If, the this sick person, very sick.

610
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,400
That is another form of seeing it.

611
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,000
I have seen a lot of people fail lately.

612
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:53,100
What does that have to do with me?

613
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,000
When do I see you? In that walk?

614
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,600
Not I have played in but of one year,
and I have not run in 10 months.

615
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:07,600
I play in the bar, accent that me
clean the swig that it is everything.

616
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:11,300
I put my money of leaving
and you ends up, that was everything.

617
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,700
Ok, ok.

618
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:24,400
I also bother myself.

619
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,500
Alone you stay for one hour, ok.

620
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,000
Clever.

621
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,200
Lift it, clever.

622
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,500
Cleaner.

623
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:50,400
Better you make it.

624
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,600
We finish.

625
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,400
That is their number, the doctor
Murian, see if he/she has but.

626
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,200
Well, I will see what has.

627
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,300
Alone it is that I don't arrive to anything, if
you want I give you the complete file.

628
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,300
That will be enough.

629
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,500
I have to fight with
a maniac lawyer.

630
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,800
- Tomato the free night.
- You are tired.

631
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,900
Well, good-bye.

632
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,700
- Good-bye suckles.
- Good-bye.

633
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,500
- Hello uncle Timmy.
- How do you go Henry?

634
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,600
Timmy enters in the car.

635
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,300
Good to see you.

636
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,400
What do you want?

637
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:49,100
I take sober 8 days,
I returned to the meetings.

638
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,800
He/she wanted you to know it.

639
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,600
Before the boy?

640
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,500
You the bad thing that I made, I swear him.

641
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:01,100
One doesn't eat to fix it
it is all that I think.

642
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,400
What do I make, me not you?

643
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:08,000
Give Sthephany what plays him/her.

644
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,600
- This crying?
- Not you.

645
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,700
- For the drugs?
- For that reason and everything the rest.

646
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:53,200
What?

647
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:57,200
Your uncle Timmy.

648
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,300
And I say that that in their best day,

649
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,200
...it was as good as your.

650
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,600
Not I speak of the cry for those
you drug, but of their heart.

651
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,800
Do you understand me? Always
I say ugly things of the one.

652
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,800
Shit, you that you want it and you for that.

653
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:21,200
When you see this way it, not
you have to worry.

654
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:23,000
Because it won't be this way for you.

655
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:27,600
Not you will be one of those that asks
for that passes him/her all the bad one.

656
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,200
That him you, him you.

657
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,300
OK?

658
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,800
I see it every time that
I look at you, right now.

659
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,100
Not you of the one who him
you took out but you have it.

660
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,200
Ok?

661
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,500
Hello.

662
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,800
The neighbors came, they are
renovating the apartment of below.

663
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:22,200
The water of their bathroom, him
it filtered that of them.

664
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,700
The alante door and the one of
emergency, all very closed one was.

665
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,800
I take them 10 minutes to
my boys to be able to enter.

666
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,500
There were pills for where he/she wants.

667
01:15:38,100 --> 01:15:42,000
It seemed alone, very
definitive for the suicide.

668
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:48,700
And speak with their partner
on these things that he/she said.

669
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,500
Is there a note?

670
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,400
No, anything.

671
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:59,600
He/she can that it is an accident
or he/she will make it and he/she was not able to.

672
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:03,200
Am I able to he/she enters?

673
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,900
Now, no, this sealed.

674
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,400
When the stamp takes off this frozen one.

675
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,600
We will be about finding to the
daughter but I believe that this in Europe.

676
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,700
But she has to come,

677
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:17,900
...or to wait for the one
report toxicological.

678
01:16:18,100 --> 01:16:21,500
At least two weeks but
that he/she will have to be this way.

679
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:23,500
I sit down it.

680
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,700
Ok.

681
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:40,200
I know their brother.

682
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:43,300
My wife works for
where the one walks in Queens.

683
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,900
I will tell it to him.

684
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,700
If one knows something, he/she called it.

685
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,100
If, it would appreciate it.

686
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:52,500
I sit down their lost one.

687
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,800
It is very hard.

688
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,500
Prostitute's son.

689
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,500
He/she waits.

690
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,900
I sit down it.

691
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,400
He/she wanted to speak with the one.

692
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,100
Damned crazy.

693
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:46,800
In that thought?

694
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:50,500
I have to fix this.

695
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:53,500
These well?

696
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,900
If, I am well.

697
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:58,900
We go for a swig.

698
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:06,700
I continue thinking in as
I pressed it too much.

699
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,700
Maybe you scares.

700
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,400
To scare him like to be killed?

701
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:13,900
We go, it was a bull.

702
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,200
Why for that made it?

703
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,700
He/she has to be an accident.

704
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,200
Without a note, the one didn't go to
to urinate without leaving a report.

705
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:27,300
Not I understand,

706
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:31,500
...in a moment this well
and to the other one this this way, why?

707
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:39,000
Why? Because people don't understand.

708
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:42,200
Why?

709
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:46,900
For 30 years I met him.

710
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,800
Good years.

711
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,500
And what I sit down now, honestly,

712
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,500
...I am not able to him neither to say, it is horrible.

713
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,900
Dilo.

714
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:07,700
We dig him/her the tomb.

715
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,500
Did we make it not?

716
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,600
Good morning, we have
that to enter in the office.

717
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,600
- Did they accept?
- In principle.

718
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,900
Don Jeffers loves us
to speak in half hour.

719
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,500
It is about explaining to him/her
that of Arthur but not...

720
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,300
Does he/she wait, you this making the agreement?

721
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,400
If they come an opportunity
they attempted it, they will make it.

722
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,900
You made what you could
Mike, all we made it.

723
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,800
It is what we have.

724
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,400
- Do you need him to take you?
- No, I am well.

725
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:23,300
Hello.

726
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:25,200
I am looking for Ana.

727
01:20:25,900 --> 01:20:27,000
Who does speak to me?

728
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,800
My name is Michael Clayton,
I am lawyer from New York.

729
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,900
- Arthur gave me his number.
- You don't have shame.

730
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,700
Do excuse?

731
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:37,100
It takes it to New York and
then he/she leaves it in the airport.

732
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,000
This is not a city person.

733
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:42,900
It is a chilca that never
it had left Milwake.

734
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,200
- Wait, wait.
- No, you wait.

735
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:48,800
She will return tomorrow and when
arrive if he/she calls again...

736
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,500
This saying that this
in New York right now?

737
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,000
He/she is a young boy, he/she understands me.

738
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,200
Her this here now?

739
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:58,300
What person are you?

740
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,800
Stay in the telephone for one second.

741
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Ana is Mchael, Arthur's friend.

742
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,400
Speak with your sister and her
he/she told me that you were here. -

743
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:48,700
Please he/she opens the door.

744
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,300
Of what do you think?

745
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:07,200
I watch over the door and your
it looks for well in the car.

746
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:13,600
He/she never told me what was exactly.

747
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,700
Alone that when it would arrive,

748
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:23,700
...the it would pick up me
and I would see that it was...

749
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,600
...that it was something that
it would win the whole case.

750
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,700
This morning I thought,

751
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,100
...I go to the airport and the one
passage not this there, I will know it.

752
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:44,200
You are entupida, you can leave now home.

753
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,500
He was there and I pay 800 dollars,

754
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:55,100
...for a passage of first.

755
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:57,200
And me...

756
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,800
...mount me in the airplane.

757
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:12,100
I believed him/her.

758
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:16,300
You believe that it was
disappointed in some form?

759
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:23,600
Or that your you had told him/her this to
another person and was it disappointed?

760
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,300
- I made it.
- Didn't you say it to anybody?

761
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,800
No, the he/she made me promise him/her.

762
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,500
You didn't tell to anybody but
on this other person.

763
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,600
No.

764
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,800
Was he crazy, not?

765
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,100
- I sit down this.
- Allow me to see.

766
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:08,700
Do you know what is?

767
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,000
You said a favor, that is but.

768
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,800
Nobody will know of where he/she came.

769
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,100
- These crazy one?
- Of who you speak?

770
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,700
Who did this request?
Is a restaurant, not?

771
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:25,500
Do you want to know in fact?

772
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,200
This becomes better and well.

773
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:48,800
What do we make?

774
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:54,000
Still. don't move.

775
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:56,600
This well, I am a friend of the one.

776
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,300
Put their hands on high, now.

777
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,700
- What does he/she have in the hands?
- It is a book.

778
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,900
Loose it, loose it now.

779
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:07,700
- Turn you, smoothly.
- This well.

780
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,200
- Who but this here?
- Nobody.

781
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:12,100
- I said that who but.
- Nobody but.

782
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,400
He/she looks there inside.

783
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,300
He/she moves and I shoot to the head.

784
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:52,400
Now the idiot and their wife,
they are shitting in my unit.

785
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,400
- Now jodiendome are.
- I sit down it, truly.

786
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,400
Nobody will know that I am me, you know
that it happens if we don't hide this.

787
01:28:58,700 --> 01:29:00,800
- Me you...
- It is bad him you.

788
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,100
Alone they lack 18 months for my
jubilation and you have put it in danger.

789
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:07,200
- I already understood you.
- Not there is anything to understand.

790
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:08,900
Who do call to the police?

791
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,200
What?

792
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,800
The building was empty, me
I didn't make noise and I was not a lot.

793
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,300
Who do call? That
does he/she make sense for you?

794
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,000
That never step.

795
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:20,600
You have these policemen
thinking that you are a lawyer.

796
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:23,400
And to the lawyers thinking that you are
a policeman, you have all you deceive you.

797
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,800
All less to you.

798
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:28,600
Your you know what you are well.

799
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:45,000
We are about calling it several times,

800
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,100
...but their it schemes
it should be broken or something.

801
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,000
We made it the best thing
possible. WARNINGS OF IT CONQUERS

802
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,800
And we run out of the mask
red, alone we had 2000.

803
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,400
So we made the other ones 1000 in blue.

804
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,900
- This all well?
- Well.

805
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:24,300
He/she has a van or something
because I have 25 box there behind?

806
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,300
Wait, I return later for the rest.

807
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:32,000
- Seriously? Thank you.
- If.

808
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,500
Don, continuous, I go later.

809
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,600
What?

810
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,600
- Do You Know Michael Clayton?
- If, why?

811
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:16,800
We have a problems.

812
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:41,300
Marty was looking for you.

813
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:54,900
Your telephone this broken one, you should assist him.

814
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:56,900
- I need one minute.
- We are late already.

815
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,400
We could never finish last night.

816
01:31:58,900 --> 01:32:01,100
When they closed the one
place? It seemed the hell.

817
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:02,700
NO, it was after you left.

818
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:07,200
No, we were here the whole night,
we had to make an announcement.

819
01:32:07,300 --> 01:32:09,700
I need the thing, the envelope.

820
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,800
He/she loved you in the entrance
so that monitorearas everything.

821
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,200
I Put to Bob, and Kim,
probably an error.

822
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:20,300
They were about organizing a wake
for the end of the week.

823
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,500
I told them that they called you
if they needed help.

824
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,200
No, no, the other one.

825
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,200
So we take out your check this morning.

826
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,500
Some additional things.

827
01:32:31,700 --> 01:32:35,700
And Barry, is not another form,
the one will have to make it.

828
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:42,200
And if Arthur was in something?

829
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,900
What do you mean, in what?

830
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,700
Your you know, and if it was not
crazy and if taenia reason.

831
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:50,500
Taenia reason on that that
we are in the mistaken side.

832
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,700
Mistaken side, via mistaken, everything.

833
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:55,800
This is new, this
case is from the day 1.

834
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,600
In 15 years I have you that
to say as paying the rent.

835
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:01,200
But that they would make if they find out this?

836
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:04,300
What they would make, you are
idiot? They are making it.

837
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:09,000
If we don't get ready it they removed
millions d and dollars in taxes.

838
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:12,500
And then they will put the video
of Arthur dancing in Milwake.

839
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,700
And they will demand us for legal fraud.

840
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:18,100
Except that there won't be anything, then
for then it was not anything.

841
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:20,400
Because we will have sold until the furniture.

842
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,200
This is 80.

843
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:25,400
You call it an extra.

844
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,000
You have a contract of 3
years, assuming that it works.

845
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,100
Will we make this now?

846
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:36,600
He/she looks, I agreed,
but now there are rules.

847
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,500
If you want the contract, you signed
a contract of confidentiality,

848
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,900
...that it will be very good and retroactive.

849
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:43,900
Because Marty is very
pleasant to say it.

850
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,400
But with all that you know
of this place and the clients,

851
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:50,300
...and of people that works here, it is
a little strange when you come and you request 80.

852
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,400
Not he/she would go with another person, but with you
Barry and it would not be for 80 anything but.

853
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,100
Are you responsible for this reason?

854
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,900
- If I make a mistake...
- These very mistaken one.

855
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:00,500
There you have.

856
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:02,500
It is already enough, ok, coarse.

857
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,800
He is an idiot, but the him
he/she knows, although the contract is this way.

858
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,700
Ok, all happy ones?

859
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,400
- I already arrive John.
- I go it stops there.

860
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:17,000
He/she calls to Bob, to see if
he/she needs help with this.

861
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:22,400
Of anything.

862
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:17,400
You said 12, here there are 75.

863
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:19,700
Be not moved a lot,
do you want a swig?

864
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:20,800
No.

865
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,400
This well, all well.

866
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,100
Single faces your work.

867
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:31,600
Likewise.

868
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:33,900
Take care.

869
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:54,500
Check.

870
01:35:54,700 --> 01:35:56,200
- Check.
- Peon.

871
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,100
A but.

872
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,500
What step with Bond? Taenia
that to be a rock star.

873
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,500
What do you make? You have just arrived.

874
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,300
Do I harass I put you demasiando fear?

875
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,200
What did I make, did I put you fear?

876
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,400
Salt.

877
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,200
Salt of the car now.

878
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:53,500
- Walter.
- Michael.

879
01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:56,300
Thanks to God that these there.

880
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:04,900
You have 10, 6, 5...

881
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:09,400
...4, 3, salt of the car.

882
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:14,800
Did you stay there?

883
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:17,900
- If, well.
- Am I clean?

884
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,700
- It continues walking.
- Copied, I am clean.

885
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,300
It continues moving, the one
he/she walks until the car.

886
01:38:26,200 --> 01:38:30,200
Alone you tell me where these and I will call you
with the details, give me two minutes.

887
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:32,600
This well will be in the car.

888
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,900
It is the but not you.

889
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,200
We will lose it.

890
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,200
I have a sign, the this here.

891
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:14,200
We have to find the sign.

892
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:23,700
Not you that Walter promised you...

893
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,900
A miraculous worker, that
it has been for 20 minutes Walter.

894
01:39:28,200 --> 01:39:31,000
He said that you are a
miraculous worker.

895
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,300
Him you mistakes.

896
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:35,700
On what? That you are a don
nobody, or that you are not good for anything.

897
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,200
Light it, I have a sign.

898
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,700
Not it is here, how ago?

899
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:13,800
- Maybe he/she got lost.
- That is the one.

900
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:19,400
- Is the not?
- If that believes.

901
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:21,000
Tell me, if or not.

902
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:25,300
We have to veer.

903
01:40:55,900 --> 01:40:58,200
This hurrying.

904
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,600
We are well, alone it continues.

905
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,600
Now you veers, it turns.

906
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:22,000
- Where?
- To the left.

907
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:23,600
Not I have left.

908
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,600
What step, did we lose it?

909
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,500
Me not you.

910
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:50,300
We have to return,
to find it before it veers.

911
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,700
- Where?
- 1 kilometer behind.

912
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:03,700
He/she says that we are close, this in
green, but it cannot be to the West.

913
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:06,400
- Is it the sign or the map?
- Both, are bad.

914
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:07,700
Curse.

915
01:42:59,300 --> 01:43:00,500
Give me your cellular one.

916
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,500
The sign this well.

917
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,700
What?

918
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,200
- Thank You Mike.
- Alone you take out me of here.

919
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,300
He/she looks, I need and schedule of those
meetings, as quick as he/she can.

920
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:03,200
I believe that we have that
to have somebody of the group.

921
01:45:05,700 --> 01:45:07,100
Do you already know?

922
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,700
- If, they closed the contract.
- No, that of Michael Clayton.

923
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,300
What?

924
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:14,100
A bomb in the car,
this morning, they killed him.

925
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:18,800
What? Shit.

926
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:38,300
It has been and it continues being our position,

927
01:45:38,600 --> 01:45:42,600
...that this demand doesn't have
I base and without grouper.

928
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,700
We refuse ourselves to
to negotiate, for this reason.

929
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,000
And also helped by the plaintiff,

930
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:54,900
...that it demanded a
arrangement of 3 thousand millions.

931
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:57,600
The reason for which we are here today,

932
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,500
...it is that many elements
in the case they have changed.

933
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:07,400
All have many proposals,

934
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,500
...that they describe the details.

935
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,600
But in summary it is this,

936
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:17,500
...in the last months, we knew that
the plaintiffs were impatient.

937
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:23,000
And that they were in the process
of revising, their number.

938
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,000
We also knew that the payment of their,

939
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:31,200
...lawyers were of a
30%, almost 4000 millions.

940
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:35,500
Then their payments fell at the 24%,

941
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,600
Finally, our group
financial I inform us,

942
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:52,100
...that they had calculated with
the impuestados benefit.

943
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,100
Taking in all would make
an arrangement less than 600 millions,

944
01:46:55,300 --> 01:46:57,400
...and in this fiscal year,

945
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:02,900
...and that the arrangement would be paid alone.

946
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,200
The package that you/they have
before you,

947
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:11,400
...it represents in my trial, the
position but strong of our company.

948
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:18,000
And I eat boss of the Council,
I recommend that it is accepted.

949
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,500
Thank you Karen, single damages some minutes.

950
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:25,400
This well, I will be out.

951
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:29,900
Good.

952
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,500
How was that there inside?

953
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:58,700
Does it scare not?

954
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,200
Arthur walks somewhere around you know.

955
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:08,300
I am joking, calm down.

956
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:11,900
Do you have one of these, is buenísimo?

957
01:48:12,700 --> 01:48:14,300
It is old but good.

958
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:18,800
I have your heart in the mouth.

959
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,600
Not you that he/she believes that ago.

960
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:22,100
What do you believe your?

961
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,900
This you ends up, we have a treatment.

962
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,800
Not it cares what is
that, no longer cares.

963
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,900
Does that believe? Let us make a mistake,
I thought that taenias a proposal.

964
01:48:31,400 --> 01:48:35,200
I didn't give myself hill that you signed those
check, I have thousands of these.

965
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:36,600
What will I make with them?

966
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:39,500
- I Will Call to Marty.
- Well, make it.

967
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:43,700
We will begin somewhere around, we will ask him/her
who he/she told him/her that Arthur called to Ana.

968
01:48:43,900 --> 01:48:45,800
Let us discover who record their calls.

969
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,800
This report, although it is
I authenticate, what I doubt...

970
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,500
You what you made to Arthur.

971
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,700
This protected belongs to the company.

972
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:54,700
You that you killed him.

973
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,300
It is a case of pled client.

974
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,200
You see, it is not this way like you should proceed here.

975
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,200
To be so intelligent, these lost one.

976
01:49:03,100 --> 01:49:04,500
This conversation you ends up.

977
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:08,100
Not I am the type that
you kill, I am the one that you buy.

978
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:10,500
These so blind one that you don't see what I am.

979
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,900
I am the part but easy
of all your problem.

980
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:16,100
And you will kill me, you don't know who am.

981
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:18,200
I fix everything, I am a bad type.

982
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,600
I make of everything from robbery to
housewives to until senators.

983
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:26,300
And you will kill me, what
do you need Karen you tell it to me?

984
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:30,000
You want to know but,
information of inside?

985
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,100
I sold him/her that to Arthur for 80
thousand and for a 3 year-old contract.

986
01:49:34,300 --> 01:49:35,700
And your you will kill me.

987
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:40,700
- What do you want?
- What do I want? But.

988
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,700
I want to leave, with this, I want everything.

989
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:50,600
- Do you have a number?
- 10 are the number.

990
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,900
10, 10 what?

991
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:56,900
10 millions?

992
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:00,700
Of where you believe that I will take out
10 million dollars?

993
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:05,300
The good thing of this, if you read it until
the end, do you see who sign it?

994
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:10,200
We go there inside and let us ask him/her
to Don if he/she wants to continue with this.

995
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:15,200
We will have to continue conversing,

996
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:17,600
...and we will continue in another place.

997
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,300
Where in my car?

998
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:25,200
Ok, I will make it to you but easy, let us say that 5.

999
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,100
5 and I forget Arthur.

1000
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:34,900
5 are but easy, if of
5 if we can speak.

1001
01:50:35,600 --> 01:50:36,600
Well,

1002
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:39,700
...and the other ones 5 are for
to forget to 468 people,

1003
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:41,700
...that you killed with your product.

1004
01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:46,000
- Allow me to finish this meeting...
- Does it seem that I negotiate?

1005
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:50,000
- Karen.
- One second.

1006
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:52,900
- All well?
- If.

1007
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:58,100
10 millions, in the bank
that I want, out.

1008
01:50:58,300 --> 01:50:59,400
Repeat it.

1009
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:03,300
10 millions, your bill,
when it finishes the meeting.

1010
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,800
- Karen all wait.
- I Go Don.

1011
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,700
- You have a treatment.
- You are an idiot.

1012
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:12,900
- What?
- These jodida.

1013
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,400
- What do you mean?
- He/she guesses.

1014
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,400
- Does something happen?
- Not I understand.

1015
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:19,300
Allow me to take a picture while I make it.

1016
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:22,500
- Not he/she does want the money?
- No, stay it, you needed it.

1017
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,600
- You this bothering?
- Am I bothering you?

1018
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:28,700
Karen has all
waiting for you... who are?

1019
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:31,700
I am Sheba, the goddess of the death.

1020
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Rum, I need here now to security.

1021
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:37,500
There we go.

1022
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,400
Catch to that type.

1023
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:43,800
What do they make?

1024
01:51:44,200 --> 01:51:46,300
We are detectives of the police.

1025
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,400
Did you record all that?

1026
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:02,300
If, I have it.

1027
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,500
- These well?
- Alone I need air.

1028
01:52:09,500 --> 01:52:14,600
Sure, alone you stay close.

1029
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,300
What do we make?

1030
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,200
Give me a turn of 50 dollars.

1031
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:40,000
Alone it manages.
