00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,970
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for coming.

2
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:57,058
I am the Lorax.
I speak for the trees.

3
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:00,019
And I'd like to say
a few words, if you please.

4
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,731
Regarding the story
that you're about to see

5
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:05,859
it actually happened.
Just take it from me.

6
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,070
But there's more to this story
than what's on the page,

7
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:12,365
so please pay attention
while I set the stage.

8
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,830
<i>We open in Thneedville, a city they
say that was plastic and fake,</i>

9
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,832
<i>and they liked it that way!</i>

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,961
<i>A town without nature,
not one living tree.</i>

11
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:26,713
<i>So, what happened to them?</i>

12
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:30,175
<i>Cue the music! Let's see.</i>

13
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,519
<i>Buzz. Buzz.</i>

14
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:09,631
<i>In Thneedville,
it's a brand new dawn</i>

15
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:15,011
<i>With brand new cars
and houses and lawns</i>

16
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:18,056
<i>Here in
Got-all-that-we-need-ville</i>

17
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:23,853
<i>In Thneedville,
we manufacture our trees</i>

18
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:30,527
<i>Each one is made
in factories</i>

19
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:33,446
<i>And uses 96 batteries</i>

20
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,619
<i>In Thneedville,
the air's not so clean</i>

21
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,872
<i>So we buy it fresh</i>

22
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,166
<i>It comes out this machine!</i>

23
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,044
<i>In Satisfaction's-
guaranteed-ville</i>

24
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:53,550
<i>In Thneedville,
we don't want to know</i>

25
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,639
<i>Where the smog and trash
and chemicals go</i>

26
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:03,935
<i>I just went swimming,
and now I glow</i>

27
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,647
<i>In Thneedville,
we have fun year round</i>

28
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:11,109
<i>We surf and snowboard
right in town</i>

29
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:14,946
<i>We thank the Lord
for all we've got</i>

30
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:18,825
<i>Including this
brand new parking lot!</i>

31
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:25,081
<i>Parking lot!</i>

32
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:32,005
<i>Oh, look,
it's Aloysius O'Hare</i>

33
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,550
<i>Aloysius O'Hare</i>

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,971
<i>The man who found
a way to sell air</i>

35
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,473
<i>And became a zillionaire</i>

36
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,644
Hip-hip-hooray!

37
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,023
<i>In Thneedville,
we love living this way</i>

38
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:53,901
<i>It's like living in paradise</i>

39
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,904
<i>It's perfect!
And that's how it will stay</i>

40
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,072
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

41
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,742
<i>Here in
Love-the-life-we-lead-ville</i>

42
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,619
<i>Destined-to-succeed-ville</i>

<i>We-are-all-agreed-ville</i>

44
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:07,957
<i>We love it here in...</i>

45
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,586
<i>Thneedville!</i>

46
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:52,543
Yes!

47
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,393
Oh, hi, Ted.

48
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:11,979
Oh, hey, Audrey. Hi.

49
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,899
Did your ball land
in my backyard again?

50
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,526
What? No.

51
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,569
A model airplane,
this time.

52
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,989
Hey, do you want to
see something cool?

53
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,157
Come on.

54
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,290
Whoa!

55
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,590
Did you...

56
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,759
Did you paint this?

57
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,761
Do you like it?
What?

58
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:47,682
Are you kidding?
This is amazing!

59
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,016
What are those?

60
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,228
Those are trees.
Real ones.

61
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,606
They used to grow
all around here.

62
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:59,402
And people said that
the touch of their tufts

63
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,029
was softer than
anything, even silk.

64
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,866
And they smelled
like butterfly milk!

65
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:07,160
Wow! What does
that even mean?

66
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,661
I know, right?

67
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,039
Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,710
What I want more than anything
in the whole world is to see

69
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:18,254
a real living tree

70
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,131
growing in my backyard.

71
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:23,259
So if, say... I'm just
thinking out loud here.

72
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:26,095
If a guy somehow
got you one...

73
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,473
I'd probably
marry him on the spot.

74
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:31,309
I bet that sounds crazy.
Does that sound crazy?

75
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,394
No! Not crazy.

76
00:06:33,853 --> 00:06:35,813
Not crazy at all.

77
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:45,698
Ted, honey,
don't play with your food.

78
00:06:45,865 --> 00:06:47,158
You, either, Mom.

79
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:56,793
So, Mom, do you happen to
know if there's any place

80
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,378
where I could
get a real tree?

81
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,298
Ted, we already have a tree.
It's the latest model.

82
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:04,759
Yeah, but I mean
a real one

83
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,929
that grows out of
the ground or whatever.

84
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,514
You know, a real tree.

85
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,640
Really?

86
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:13,559
You would rather
have some dirty, messy

87
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:16,229
lump of wood that just
sticks out of the ground?

88
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,688
And it does what? I don't
even know what it does.

89
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:18,898
What's its purpose?

90
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,274
Look at what we've got.

91
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:23,653
It's the Oak-amatic. The only
tree with its own remote.

92
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:26,781
Summer, autumn, winter,

93
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,074
and disco!

94
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,539
Mom? Come on, Ted. Get into it.

95
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:35,581
Dance with the tree.

96
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:37,750
Oh, it hurts, Mom. Please stop.

97
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:40,378
So, anyway...

98
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,338
Let's just say
I need a tree.

99
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,006
Where would I go?
What do I do?

100
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:47,218
Then you know what? You
need to find the Once-ler.

101
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,303
The What?

102
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:54,642
Mom, it's not really the time for
one of your magical fables, okay?

103
00:07:54,934 --> 00:07:57,019
That's right, I forgot.

104
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:00,690
I'm old and can't even
remember to put my teeth in.

105
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,733
Stand down.
That's not what I meant.

106
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,777
No, really,
I forgot my teeth.

107
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,655
Would you be a dear
and go get them for me?

108
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,657
Sure, Mom.

109
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,456
Okay, here's the deal.

110
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,668
The Once-ler is the man who knows
what happened to the trees.

111
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,087
You want one,
you need to find him.

112
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,840
The Once-ler?
Mmm-hmm.

113
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,342
Okay. Grammy,
is this a real thing

114
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,802
that we're talking
about now?

115
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,596
Oh, he's real all right.

116
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,681
Well, where
can I find him?

117
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:40,438
Far outside of town
where the grass never grows

118
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:44,233
and the wind smells slow
and sour when it blows.

119
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,823
And no birds ever sing,
excepting old crows.

120
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,119
Quit doing that.

121
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,663
That's the place
where the Once-ler lives.

122
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,082
Wait, outside of town?

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,629
People used to say
if you brought him 15 cents,

124
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,838
<i>a nail</i>

125
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:10,009
<i>and the shell of a great,
great, great grandfather snail,</i>

126
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,805
<i>he would tell you everything.</i>

127
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,836
Hmm.

128
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,829
Mr. O'Hare,
what we've got for you

129
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:22,206
is something that is
going to take O'Hare Air

130
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,041
to the next level.

131
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,127
Now, Mr. O'Hare,
I know what you're thinking.

132
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,337
One, "I've gotten rich
selling people air that's

133
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,506
"fresher than
the stinky stuff outside."

134
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,216
Two, and here is
the important one,

135
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,719
"How can I possibly make
even more money?"

136
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:36,721
We can tell you, sir!
We can tell you.

137
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:39,557
Check out this
commercial, huh?

138
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,520
Well, here goes
another lame Saturday.

139
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:48,065
Dude, I don't think so!

140
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:50,568
Huh!

141
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:52,737
Hey!

142
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,490
Man!

143
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,575
Oh, yeah!

144
00:10:58,617 --> 00:10:59,618
What!

145
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,623
Yeah!

146
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:08,085
<i>O'Hare purified air.
Freshness to go.</i>

147
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,545
<i>Please breathe responsibly.</i>

148
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:10,713
Ah?

149
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,548
Oh, my goodness. Yeah!
Love it

150
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,050
You got to be kidding me.

151
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,095
You really think people are
stupid enough to buy this?

152
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:22,016
Our research shows that if you put
something in a plastic bottle,

153
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,100
people will buy it.

154
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,185
Exactly. And...

155
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,395
And what's more, when
we build a new factory

156
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,063
to make
the plastic bottles,

157
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,649
the air quality is
just going to get worse.

158
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,860
Which will make people
want our air even more,

159
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,904
and drive sales where?

160
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,071
Through the roof!

161
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:40,785
So, in other words,
the more smog in the sky,

162
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,954
the more people will buy.

163
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:49,752
See, that's why he's the genius!
It even rhymes!

164
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:52,588
I'm aware it rhymes.

165
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:54,632
Coats. Big.

166
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,217
What do you two
knuckleheads want?

167
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,760
I'm in the middle
of a meeting!

168
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:01,806
What?

169
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,599
Why is he leaving town?

170
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:05,643
No one ever leaves town!

171
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:07,770
See what he's up to.

172
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,407
Whoa!

173
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,377
Huh?

174
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,630
Whoa! Whoa.

175
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,260
Oh, man.

176
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,780
Whoa!

177
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,323
All right.

178
00:15:03,237 --> 00:15:04,238
Okay.

179
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,324
What the...

180
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:08,909
Whoa!

181
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,626
Who are you?

182
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,212
Who are you and what
are you doing here?

183
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,798
I'm Ted. I'm Ted.

184
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:25,676
I can't breathe.
Are you the Once-ler?

185
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,011
Oh, man.
Didn't you read the signs?

186
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,431
No one is
supposed to come here.

187
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,725
Get out of here
and leave me alone!

188
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,810
And don't let the boot
hit you on the way out.

189
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:35,894
The boot?

190
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:37,813
Hello!

191
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:38,897
Ow!

192
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:42,192
Listen! People say that if
someone brings you this stuff

193
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,361
that you will tell
them about trees.

194
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:45,738
No, no, no!

195
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:49,616
Trees?

196
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,201
Yeah, real ones.

197
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,037
You know,
that grow out of the ground?

198
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:56,623
Hello?

199
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:58,167
Sorry, it's just...

200
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,794
Well, I didn't think anyone
still cared about trees.

201
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:04,381
Well, that's me. The guy
who still cares. I'm here.

202
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,759
Hey! What?

203
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,303
Do you want to
know about trees?

204
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,722
About what happened
to them?

205
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,809
Why they're all gone?
It's because of me.

206
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:16,894
Wait, what?

207
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,985
It's because of me!

208
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:30,699
And my invention,
the Thneed.

209
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:35,245
It was an amazing product that
could do the job of a thousand.

210
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:37,623
All right.

211
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,708
Sounds ridiculous,
but I mean, that's cool.

212
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,085
You're darn right
it was cool!

213
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,131
It all started
a long time ago.

214
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:48,383
Can we start not
so long ago, maybe?

215
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,676
Do you want a tree?

216
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:51,220
Yes, yes.

217
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:56,934
Then it all started
a long, long time ago.

218
00:16:57,893 --> 00:17:00,604
<i>I was a young man
leaving home.</i>

219
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:04,316
Well, here I go, Mom. Off to
change the world with my Thneed.

220
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,903
I'm actually doing it!

221
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,656
Yes, but just
remember, Oncie,

222
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:13,575
if somehow your invention
ends up a failure

223
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,828
instead of a success,

224
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,372
oh, it wouldn't
surprise me at all!

225
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,458
Nice wheels.

226
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,043
Burn!

227
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,212
Ow!

228
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,463
Yeah, "Burn!"

229
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,842
But you will see, okay? I'm
going to prove you all wrong.

230
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:31,385
Come on, Melvin!

231
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,346
<i>So, there I was
at the very bottom.</i>

232
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:36,723
<i>With nothing
but a wagon, a mule,</i>

233
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:41,103
<i>and a completely irrational
sense of optimism.</i>

234
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,192
<i>I was searching the globe,</i>

235
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:50,779
<i>obsessed with finding the
perfect material for my Thneed.</i>

236
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,243
<i>But I 'd had
absolutely no success.</i>

237
00:17:56,493 --> 00:18:01,290
<i>Until one day, I found paradise.</i>

238
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,457
Oh!

239
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,918
We're going to be
there soon, I'm sure.

240
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,253
Whoa!

241
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:20,058
This is the most
beautiful place,

242
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,144
okay, I have ever seen.

243
00:18:23,854 --> 00:18:25,063
Oh.

244
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,690
Ta-da!

245
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,359
Whoa!

246
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,809
Yeah

247
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,853
<i>This is it</i>

248
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,233
<i>This is the place</i>

249
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:15,238
<i>These Truffula trees
are just what I need</i>

250
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:20,410
<i>Gonna chop one down
and make my Thneed</i>

251
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,288
<i>But first...</i>

252
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,752
Now you!

253
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:32,756
That's great!

254
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,728
<i>So now our
friendship can begin</i>

255
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,106
<i>Hand in hand,
and wing and fin</i>

256
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:51,858
<i>There's nothing
you and I can't do</i>

257
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,903
<i>So let's all make
my dreams come true</i>

258
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,551
Hey, guys!

259
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:21,054
Come on, where is
my back-up chorus?

260
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,474
What?

261
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:28,019
Ah-ha! Oh.

262
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:36,361
Ooh!

263
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,101
<i>Hey, hey, wait.
Wait a minute.</i>

264
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,352
Excuse me?

265
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,022
Yeah, that's awesome.

266
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,233
Feeding junk food to forest animals?
That's great.

267
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,527
But, uh, is there
a musical number

268
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:19,029
where you show me
how to get a tree?

269
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,489
Because I would
love to hear that one.

270
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:23,533
Oh, yes. Right after the
musical number about the kid

271
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,452
who kept
interrupting the story,

272
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,370
and was never
heard from again.

273
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,081
Right, got it. Proceed.

274
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,460
All right, here we go.

275
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:36,963
About to make a Thneed,
about to change the world.

276
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:10,705
Check it out, guys...

277
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:13,250
Where did everybody go?

278
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,218
Little did I know that by
chopping down that tree

279
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:28,223
I had just summoned a mystical
creature as old as time itself.

280
00:22:28,932 --> 00:22:32,686
The legendary,
slightly annoying

281
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:34,980
guardian of the forest.

282
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,357
The Lorax.

283
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:35,976
Hey!
Whoo!

284
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,812
Did you
chop down this tree?

285
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,272
Uh... No.

286
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,650
Who did it?

287
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,568
What's that?

288
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:48,571
I think he did it.

289
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,492
Leave!
Vacate the premises!

290
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:54,744
Take your ax
and get out!

291
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,163
And who are you?

292
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,459
I'm the Lorax!
Guardian of the forest.

293
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,586
I speak for the trees.

294
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,674
So you're telling me,
you just didn't see me

295
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,592
magically appear
out of that stump?

296
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,720
With all the lightning
and thunder and stuff.

297
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:12,929
You didn't see
any of that?

298
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,890
No, but that sounds amazing.
Can I see some of that?

299
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:20,020
Uh, yeah, I could show you.
But that's not how it works.

300
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:21,479
Okay. Um...

301
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,106
Didn't really happen.

302
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,900
Oh, I know what you want!

303
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:32,365
I've got one of these for the
cutest little guy I ever saw!

304
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:35,160
Yummy, yummy,
yummy, yummy, yummy...

305
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:38,288
How dare you!
Give me that!

306
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:40,290
Mmm.

307
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,500
I'm going to eat this,

308
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,794
but I am highly
offended by it.

309
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:54,012
What are you... Hey, Mustache!
Will you stop that?

310
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,182
What's your deal, man?

311
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,642
Pull them right out Time
for you to go, Beanpole!

312
00:25:59,851 --> 00:26:01,978
Just going to put them right back in.
We can do this all day.

313
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:09,569
Stop right there! Stop it!

314
00:26:11,071 --> 00:26:16,076
So you would hammer one of
nature's innocent creatures?

315
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,828
What? No!

316
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,831
I would never hit this little guy.
You, on the other hand,

317
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,333
I would
gladly pound you

318
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,168
and your mustache
into the ground!

319
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:30,173
Behold! The intruder
and his violent ways.

320
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:33,343
Shame on you.
For shame!

321
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,513
All right, you know what?
That's it!

322
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,515
You listen to me,
you furry meatloaf.

323
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,101
I'm going to chop down as
many trees as I need. Okay?

324
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,520
Newsflash!
Not going anywhere!

325
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,689
End of story.

326
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:48,983
Then you
leave me no choice.

327
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,282
If you're not gone by the time
the sun sets on this valley,

328
00:26:56,366 --> 00:27:00,620
all the forces of nature
will be unleashed upon you

329
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,208
and curse you until
the end of your days!

330
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,212
You have been warned.

331
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,595
Thanks.
Yeah, okay.

332
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,056
You have been warned.

333
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,351
But I didn't listen
to his warning.

334
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,770
And you won't believe
what happened that night.

335
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:26,896
What?

336
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,149
If you want to hear more,
come back tomorrow.

337
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:31,568
Hey, wait, wait! Tomorrow?

338
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,111
Whoa!

339
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:34,904
Whoa-ho-ho.

340
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,114
Are you serious right now?

341
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,825
Ah! You live in
the middle of nowhere!

342
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,494
It stinks out here.
Don't make me come back!

343
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,163
I guess you don't really want
to hear the rest of the story.

344
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,087
No, no.

345
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:54,173
I do. I really do. I want to
hear the story. I just...

346
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:57,260
Nah! You don't have
what it takes. Goodbye.

347
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,929
Wait, wait!
I have what it takes.

348
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,810
It's all right. It's
okay, I'll come back.

349
00:28:05,894 --> 00:28:07,061
It's no problem.

350
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:11,065
See, here I am, leaving.
Walking away now.

351
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:12,692
I'll see you tomorrow.

352
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:14,485
Mmm.

353
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,865
Maybe. Just maybe.

354
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,459
What did you
wish for, Audrey?

355
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:30,877
Well, I would
love to tell you,

356
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,964
but, sadly, according to the
universal wish laws, I cannot

357
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,426
I know
what she wished for.

358
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,315
Was it, perhaps...

359
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,318
This?

360
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,995
Ted, you didn't.

361
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,290
Oh, no. I totally did.

362
00:29:09,457 --> 00:29:12,335
Happy birthday, Audrey.

363
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,254
Kiss him! Kiss him!

364
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,519
Ted.

365
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,020
Ted. Tedster.
Huh!

366
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:34,357
You're kissing the
cereal again, hon. What?

367
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,318
I just...
I like this cereal.

368
00:29:37,402 --> 00:29:38,653
What one is this?
Yeah!

369
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,363
Okay.

370
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,199
Well, I'll make sure to buy
extra next time for you.

371
00:29:43,408 --> 00:29:46,119
All right, cool. Hey, I got to run.
I got to go do a thing.

372
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,870
So, I'll see you guys.

373
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,039
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

374
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,874
You're not going
anywhere, young man.

375
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,377
It's Sunday. You
know what that means?

376
00:29:54,544 --> 00:29:57,463
Family time, and we're
all playing board games!

377
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,548
But...

378
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,801
Hmm.

379
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,219
Mmm?

380
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,054
Oh, man.

381
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,056
Mom, seriously,
every turn?

382
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,766
Hey, back off!

383
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:11,561
Ooh!

384
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,856
No.
Okay! Family time is over.

385
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,192
It is now personal time.
I'll be in my room.

386
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:22,030
Okay, dear. Have fun.

387
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,909
I knew
I could break her.

388
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:28,244
Go.
Huh?

389
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,495
Go see him!

390
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:30,913
Oh, yeah!

391
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,376
You rule!
Thank you, Grammy.

392
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,257
Whoa!

393
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,857
Hey! Ted, right?

394
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,444
Um, Mr. O'Hare?

395
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,822
So, I hear you have
become interested in trees.

396
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:06,616
What's that all about?

397
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:08,242
Oh. Um...

398
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,703
Where did you hear that?

399
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:11,871
Oh.

400
00:31:11,954 --> 00:31:13,706
Teddy, there's not much
that goes on in Thneedville

401
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,541
that I don't know about.

402
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:19,504
Here's the deal, I make a living
selling fresh air to people.

403
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,215
Trees?
They make it for free.

404
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:25,134
So, when I hear
people talking about them,

405
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:28,679
I consider it kind of
a threat to my business.

406
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,599
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

407
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,684
You listen to me, boy.

408
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:37,396
Don't go poking around in
things you don't understand

409
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,649
or I'll be your
worst nightmare.

410
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:42,652
I'm Frankenstein's head
on a spider's body!

411
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,904
Yeah, um...

412
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,990
Okay, my mom is expecting me.
So, I'm just going to...

413
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:52,954
Of course, of course. Now, go
back to your family game time.

414
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,832
Grandma just
finished her turn.

415
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:57,750
How did you know?

416
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,711
Please. I have
eyes everywhere.

417
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:06,926
Huh!

418
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,470
You got a beautiful
town here, Ted.

419
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:13,015
Lots of fun stuff to occupy
your short attention span.

420
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:15,309
Why, I can't
think of any reason

421
00:32:15,476 --> 00:32:20,189
you would ever want to
go outside of town again.

422
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:21,274
Even

423
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:31,242
Okay! Good talk.
Really good talk.

424
00:32:56,601 --> 00:32:57,602
Oh, no.

425
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,645
Look out!

426
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:06,569
Hey, man? You know, you need
to change that door bell.

427
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,363
Oh, you missed me.
What?

428
00:33:09,697 --> 00:33:13,826
You're already back. Clearly,
you missed me a little. Right?

429
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:17,872
No, I didn't. I'm just here
to hear the end of the story.

430
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,665
Why are you so interested
in trees anyway?

431
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:21,209
Why aren't you
like other kids,

432
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:23,628
break dancing and
wearing bell-bottoms,

433
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:25,880
and playing
the Donkey Kongs?

434
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:29,717
Yeah, right, right.
I don't know.

435
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:34,472
Uh, I just thought it would be kind
of cool to have one, you know?

436
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,848
Huh?

437
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:37,475
It's a girl, isn't it?

438
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,518
What? No!

439
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,521
Really? Because when a guy
does something stupid once,

440
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:44,190
well, that's because
he's a guy.

441
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,859
But if he does
the same stupid thing twice,

442
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,654
it's usually to
impress some girl.

443
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:51,656
Hey, she is not some girl!

444
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,784
She's a woman,
in high school.

445
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,079
And she loves trees.
And I'm going to get her one.

446
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,497
Aw!

447
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,542
How nice to see someone so
undeterred by things like reality.

448
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:04,669
Thank you.

449
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,796
All right,
but where did we leave off?

450
00:34:28,276 --> 00:34:30,611
Now that's a Thneed.

451
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,531
Nothing unmanly
about knitting. No, sir.

452
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:56,804
Look at that...

453
00:34:58,264 --> 00:34:59,265
Oh!

454
00:34:59,348 --> 00:35:01,392
Who taught you guys
how to steal a bed?

455
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:07,898
Shh!

456
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,795
Okay, nice and easy.

457
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,930
Nice work, you guys. Couldn't
have done it without you.

458
00:35:42,475 --> 00:35:45,811
You got to be kidding me.
Can he swim?

459
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,772
Of course he can't swim!

460
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:50,733
Hang on, Pipsqueak!
I'm coming to get you!

461
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,907
Hey, you fishies!
Stop that bed!

462
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,205
Whoo! Whoo!

463
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,711
Jump, jump!

464
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,089
Come on, get up there.
Come on.

465
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,175
Go, go! A little bit more!
A little bit more!

466
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,262
Now what?

467
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,265
Mmm-mmm.

468
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:25,935
Get up there.

469
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:30,189
Okay, Pipsqueak,
give me your hand.

470
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:31,315
Come on,
reach out for the Lorax.

471
00:36:35,111 --> 00:36:36,403
Where did you go?

472
00:36:39,657 --> 00:36:40,950
Bar-ba-loots.

473
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:50,626
Oh, that's bad.

474
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:56,799
Hey, Beanpole, wake up!

475
00:37:06,225 --> 00:37:08,185
What's happening?
Where am I?

476
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,730
Hey! We got trouble,
and it's coming up fast!

477
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,401
Whoo!

478
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:17,027
We're in a river!

479
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,422
Whew!

480
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,886
Oh, no.

481
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,557
Just do something!

482
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:49,310
Help is on the way!

483
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:53,939
No, no!

484
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:56,859
Just a minute!

485
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:19,340
Oh, no!

486
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,470
Wake up! Wake up!

487
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,640
Yuck!

488
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:33,729
Clear!

489
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:35,189
Ah!

490
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,777
I was heading
into the light,

491
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,779
and you pulled me
right back and here I am!

492
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:43,405
You saved my life!

493
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:46,408
Yeah, I know. Well, no,
it's not that big a deal.

494
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,660
It is a big deal!

495
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,914
Look, I almost went over
that waterfall! Wait...

496
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,376
On my bed. How did my
bed get in the river?

497
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:58,128
Uh... About that...

498
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:02,841
Actually... I put your
bed in the water.

499
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,052
I didn't
mean you any harm.

500
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,596
I just wanted to
calmly float you away.

501
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:11,100
Look, everyone here
needs the trees

502
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:13,268
and you're
chopping them down!

503
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:17,398
So, we've got
a big problem.

504
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,530
All right, look.

505
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:29,118
I hereby swear that I will
never chop down another tree.

506
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:31,745
I promise.

507
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:35,457
Thank you. But I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

508
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,002
Good. Now, I've got
a big day tomorrow

509
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,920
so I'm going to
get some sleep.

510
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,134
Right after
I find my bed.

511
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:06,947
Ow!

512
00:40:07,031 --> 00:40:09,241
Okay, what are you...

513
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:13,037
Question, what are
they doing here?

514
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:17,833
And follow up, if I may,
what are you doing here?

515
00:40:18,751 --> 00:40:20,961
Well, after
the incident last night,

516
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,797
we found one of your socks
and came here to return it.

517
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,508
But when we got here,
you were asleep. What?

518
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,093
Ew!

519
00:40:28,177 --> 00:40:30,596
Exactly. And sleeping
is the body's way

520
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,015
of telling
other people to go away.

521
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:36,143
I know,
but you looked so cozy.

522
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:40,105
And it was cold outside, and we
just fell asleep. No harm done.

523
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,567
"No harm done"?
"No harm done"? Okay.

524
00:40:44,693 --> 00:40:48,447
Okay, I put my lips on those.
Well, I used to, anyway.

525
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:51,950
Ew.

526
00:40:52,034 --> 00:40:54,411
Did you just...
In my bowl!

527
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,291
Why do you have
one of these?

528
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,710
You don't even
have a mustache.

529
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:04,963
Okay, that's it!

530
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,049
What? I thought
we made a deal last night.

531
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,425
Yes, we did.

532
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,886
And I said I wouldn't
chop down any more trees.

533
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:13,013
And I said I was going
to keep an eye on you.

534
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,140
I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

535
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,269
Breakfast is overrated.

536
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:24,483
You know what?
I got work to do. Yeah.

537
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:28,862
I got to go into town
and sell my Thneed.

538
00:41:30,114 --> 00:41:31,782
You chopped down
one of my trees

539
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,575
to make that
piece of garbage?

540
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:34,827
Look at that...

541
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,581
"Garbage"? Oh, no.
Oh, no! You do not get it.

542
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,167
This is
a revolutionary product

543
00:41:42,251 --> 00:41:44,628
that will change
the world as we know it.

544
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,713
It has a million uses!

545
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,509
Look at this.
It's a swimsuit!

546
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:53,178
Mud tracked all over your
floor by uninvited guests?

547
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:56,306
Well, the Thneed sure
comes in handy for that!

548
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:58,809
But wait, there's more!

549
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,561
Thanks to its
all-natural microfibers,

550
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,105
the Thneed is
super-absorbent!

551
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:04,773
It also works as a hat.

552
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:07,818
Of course, you probably
want to wring it out first.

553
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,112
Go ahead,
knock yourself out.

554
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:12,823
But nobody is going
to buy that thing.

555
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,449
Good to know.

556
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:18,996
Well, fortunately, you are not
the target market, weirdo.

557
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:20,622
You're bringing a guitar?

558
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,541
Oh, yeah.
I got a little jingle.

559
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,252
I'm gonna blow some minds,
gonna sell some Thneeds!

560
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:26,461
Yeah.

561
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:32,176
<i>Everybody
needs a Thneed</i>

562
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,803
<i>A fine thing
that all people...</i>

563
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,848
Sit down, go on.

564
00:42:38,307 --> 00:42:40,809
Unfortunately, I didn't
sell it the first day.

565
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,895
<i>The Thneed is good</i>

566
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,063
<i>The Thneed is great...</i>

567
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:46,148
Hey!

568
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,153
Or the second day.

569
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:53,530
Hey!

570
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:56,241
<i>Or the third,
or fourth, or fifth day.</i>

571
00:42:56,783 --> 00:42:59,578
Okay, that one
hit the tender spot.

572
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:01,830
<i>Until finally...</i>

573
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:03,457
That's it!
You know what?

574
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,001
I'm done with this thing.

575
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,794
Aw.

576
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:10,339
My family was right.
I quit!

577
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:20,807
Hey. Cool hat.

578
00:43:21,058 --> 00:43:23,393
Oh, my gosh!
I totally want one.

579
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,938
That thing makes me
like you more.

580
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,324
Hey! Where's your Thneed,
did you sell it?

581
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,369
Hey.No,no.
Didn't sell it.

582
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:43,288
Turns out, it's ahead
of its time, I guess.

583
00:43:43,372 --> 00:43:46,750
Hey, you gave it your best shot.
Right? What more can you do?

584
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,877
Come on, take a seat,
we'll deal you in.

585
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,545
What are we playing?

586
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:54,424
I'm playing poker. He's playing Go Fish.
And I think he's hungry.

587
00:43:56,009 --> 00:43:57,094
Oh.

588

Who is up for ninths?

00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,569
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

592
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:16,905
Whoa!

593
00:44:16,989 --> 00:44:18,532
All right, pass them over.

594
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,075
Yeah, see?

595
00:44:20,534 --> 00:44:22,202
What's going on?

596
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:33,130
Oh, no.

help I can get. Don't worry.

00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:48,663
So, has he told you
how to get a tree yet?

615

Actually, no.

616

to that part really soon.

00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:10,102
You know me, just cruising.
Putting out the vibe.

Just me and my thoughts.

Oh, is this the girl
you're always talking about?

Grandma!
Stop making things up.

Okay, got to run! Bye.

Okay, Grammy,

00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,988
I'm so sorry. So sorry.

630
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:05,490
Did not wanna see that.

Thank you, Ted.

640
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:47,824
Now, picture this.

00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:53,455
<i>Sun shining,
a blue sky, a perfect day.</i>

00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,120
What a dump.

645
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,498
Hey, Aunt Grizelda!

646
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,418
Hey, Chet,
check this out!

647
00:48:40,502 --> 00:48:41,544
Go long!

648
00:48:42,254 --> 00:48:44,130
No, Brett,
that's actually not a...

649
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:45,257
Okay.

650
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,967
Go long! Go long!

651
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,510
I got it! I got it!

652
00:48:51,388 --> 00:48:52,389
Got it!

653
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:55,684
He totally ran
into that tree!

654
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:57,644
Ow!

655
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,605
Oncie, is that you?

656
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,982
Mom!

657
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:06,820
There he is! There's my big,
suddenly successful son!

658
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:11,533
We always knew you would
make it, Oncie. Right?

659
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,661
Hey! I love this guy!

660
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:18,039
But you always said I wouldn't
amount to anything, remember?

661
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,167
Hush your mouth. I was just
trying to motivate you!

662
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,211
I am really glad
that you clarified that

663
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:26,298
because it actually hurt my
feelings for a really long time.

664
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:30,719
Anyway, you're all here, you all
work for me, and that's cool.

665
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,220
So, let's get to work.

666
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:34,889
Brett, Chet,
set up the RV!

667
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:37,392
Would you stop
throwing that bear?

668
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:10,884
Time out. Back up. Stop. Don't move an inch.
Nobody's moving in here.

669
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,177
You got to go. Goodbye.

670
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,764
So, who invited
the giant, furry peanut?

671
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,098
You calling me
a peanut, huh?

672
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:18,433
I'll go right up
your nose!

673
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,019
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

674
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,228
You wouldn't
hit a woman.

675
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:24,564
That's a woman?

676
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,359
Okay.
Everyone, cool it.

677
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,527
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot here.

678
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,864
Um, family, this is my friend...
Acquaintance.

679
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:36,701
Yeah, acquaintance. Very good
acquaintance, the Lorax.

680
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:39,454
He speaks for the trees.
That's right.

681
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:42,290
And on behalf
of the trees, get out!

682
00:50:43,625 --> 00:50:48,254
Will you just be nice!
This is my family.

683
00:50:48,338 --> 00:50:49,381
And I'm going to
need their help

684
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:51,800
if my company is
going to get bigger. Okay?

685
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,093
Bigger?

686
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:56,679
Yeah, this isn't some
rinky-dink operation anymore.

687
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,057
I got plans. Big plans!

688
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:03,812
A vision of a world filled with Thneeds.
It's going to be huge!

689
00:51:05,939 --> 00:51:07,357
Which way
does a tree fall?

690
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,359
Uh, down?

691
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,404
A tree falls
the way it leans.

692
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:15,698
Be careful
which way you lean.

693
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:28,753
I mean, look at this.
It's amazing.

694
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,631
I am so proud of me.

695
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:35,510
Oncie, we've got us
a little problem.

696
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:36,928
Problem?

697
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,304
Mmm-hmm.

698
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,599
See, we're not making
Thneeds fast enough.

699
00:51:41,808 --> 00:51:45,145
Harvesting the tufts
takes too long!

700
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:55,029
Well, what else can we do?

701
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:59,409
Well, and this
just came to me,

702
00:51:59,576 --> 00:52:02,662
we could always start
chopping down the trees.

703
00:52:03,288 --> 00:52:04,289
What?

704
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:07,459
Now you're thinking.
That would speed things up!

705
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,252
But...
No "but"s, Oncie.

706
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,795
You're running
a business now.

707
00:52:11,004 --> 00:52:12,755
You have to do what's
best for the company,

708
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:14,382
and your momma.

709
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:20,221
Well, I guess it couldn't hurt
to chop down a few trees.

710
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,726
You've made me so proud, Oncie.
Come here!

711
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,604
Hey! I love this guy!

712
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:40,742
No! No, no, no!
Stop it! Please, stop.

713
00:52:41,326 --> 00:52:44,078
Take that, you stupid tree!

714
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,377
Where do you
think you're going?

715
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,797
Excuse me, sir. I need
to talk with your boss.

716
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,134
Oh, I'm sorry,

717
00:52:58,301 --> 00:53:01,596
but Mr. Once-ler's
not seeing anyone right now.

718
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:02,972
Yeah, well,
he'll see me. So...

719
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:04,557
Hey, keep your
paws off me!

720
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:06,684
Give me a reason, Shorty.

721
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,436
Hey, you broke
your promise.

722
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,938
You're better than this.

723
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:12,815
You gotta stop!
This is bad!

724
00:53:13,191 --> 00:53:15,818
Have a nice day!

725
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,448
Bad?

726
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:23,952
I'm not bad, I'm the good guy here.
He just doesn't get it.

727
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:25,954
Do you think I'm bad?

728
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,622
Thank you!

729
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,583
I mean, something good
finally happens to me,

730
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:33,920
and he just has to come along
and rain on my parade.

731
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,547
What's his problem?

732
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,131
See?

733
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:42,679
Yeah, bad! Right.

734
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,901

744

<i>That almost
every creature knows</i>

745
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:19,924
<i>Called survival of the fittest</i>

748

<i>How bad could I possibly be?
Let's see!</i>

786
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:59,399
<i>All the customers are buying</i>

787

00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,684
What are you doing here?

796
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:20,688
Happy yet? You fill that
hole deep down inside you?

797
00:57:20,855 --> 00:57:22,815
Or do you
still need more?

798
00:57:22,899 --> 00:57:25,610
Look, if you've got a problem
with what I'm doing,

799
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:30,573
why haven't you used your
quote-unquote powers to stop me?

I told you,
that's not how it works.

00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:38,247
Right, I forgot.
You're a fraud.

802
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,209
I need you
to get out. Now!

803
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,253
Why? Do I make
you uncomfortable?

804
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:46,214
Remind you of
the promises you made?

805
00:57:46,589 --> 00:57:48,257
The man you used to be?

806
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:49,383
You know what?

807
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:52,929
You can just shut your mustache.
My conscience is clear.

808
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,764
I have done
nothing illegal.

809
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:57,433
I have my rights, and I
intend to keep on biggering

810
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,645
and biggering, and turning more
Truffula trees into Thneeds.

811
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,982
And nothing is
going to stop me!

812
00:58:21,374 --> 00:58:23,167
Well, that's it.

813
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,419
The very last one.

814
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,923
That may stop you.

815
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:51,779
Somebody sure made
a bundle on that thing.

816
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:55,283
I wonder what the next million
dollar invention's going to be.

817
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,208
Yeah, I wonder...

818
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:18,639
Son, you have
let me down.

819
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:21,642
Brett, you are now
my favorite child.

820
00:59:40,786 --> 00:59:42,872
Hey, look,
I don't want any trouble.

821
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:47,043
And you won't get any.
Not from them.

822
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:50,963
Thanks to you and your hacking,
and smogging and glupping,

823
00:59:51,047 --> 00:59:53,049
they can't
live here anymore.

824
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:02,892
So, I'm sending them off.

825
01:00:03,059 --> 01:00:04,560
Hopefully,
they'll be able to find

826
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:06,520
a better place
out there somewhere.

827
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:11,484
Melvin?

828
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,029
Melvin...

829
01:00:16,072 --> 01:00:17,406
Hey, Pipsqueak...

830
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:22,870
Hey...

831
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:37,486
So, this is
really all your fault.

832
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,447
You destroyed everything.

833
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:41,532
Yes.

834
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,035
And each day
since the Lorax left,

835
01:01:44,118 --> 01:01:47,288
I've sat here regretting
everything I've done,

836
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:51,792
staring at that word,
"unless,"

837
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:55,546
and wondering
what it meant.

838
01:01:55,713 --> 01:01:57,465
But now I'm thinking...

839
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,924
Well, maybe
you're the reason

840
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,343
the Lorax left
that word there.

841
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:04,680
Me? Why would he
leave that for me?

842
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:08,309
Because unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,

843
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,603
nothing is
going to get better.

844
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:13,064
It's not.

845
01:02:31,332 --> 01:02:33,542
The last Truffula seed.

846
01:02:34,877 --> 01:02:37,046
You need to plant it, Ted.

847
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:40,549
Yeah, but, nobody cares
about trees anymore.

848
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,051
Then make them care.

849
01:02:42,343 --> 01:02:45,638
Plant the seed in the middle of
town, where everyone can see.

850
01:02:46,013 --> 01:02:48,224
Change the way things are.

851
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,935
I know it may seem
small and insignificant,

852
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:53,354
but it's not about
what it is,

853
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:55,689
it's about
what it can become.

854
01:02:55,898 --> 01:02:57,233
That's not just a seed,

855
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,361
any more than
you're just a boy.

856
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:09,870
I won't let you down.

857
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,207
I know.

858
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:56,959
Hey, Audrey!

859
01:03:57,418 --> 01:03:58,586
Audrey!

860
01:03:59,587 --> 01:04:00,629
Ted?

861
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:02,882
What are you doing?
Meet me at my house.

862
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,216
Wait, but...

863
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,718
My house, okay?

864
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,430
Got to plant the seed.

865
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:12,099
Okay, we're going
to need water.

866
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,226
And uh,
something to dig with.

867
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:16,270
Um, what do I have...
Ted?

868
01:04:16,562 --> 01:04:18,564
Mom, I'm busy, Mom.

869
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,482
Theodore Wiggins,
get down here right now,

870
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,526
and I am not
kidding with you!

871
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,243
Ted, I would like
you to meet Mr. O'Hare,

872
01:04:31,327 --> 01:04:33,787
the most powerful
man in town.

873
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:36,749
There he is!

874
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,250
Hello, Ted.

875
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,169
Uh...

876
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:42,963
Hi. Isn't he clever, Mr. O'Hare?

877
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:45,799
He knows his own
name and everything.

878
01:04:47,468 --> 01:04:50,721
You know what I would love
right now, Mrs. Wiggins?

879
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,806
A delicious cookie.

880
01:04:54,642 --> 01:04:55,726
Wonderful.

881
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,770
Teddy and I'll
stay here and talk.

882
01:04:57,853 --> 01:05:00,564
Sure, why don't you go
ahead and adopt him?

883
01:05:01,232 --> 01:05:04,693
I'm just kidding. That was a joke.
I was just joking.

884
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,238
I'll get your cookie.

885
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,658
I know you have it, Ted.

886
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:12,993
So, let's put an end
to this nonsense, shall we?

887
01:05:14,578 --> 01:05:15,746
Hand it over.

888
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:17,039
I'm sorry...

889
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,333
I don't know what
you're talking about.

890
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:21,252
Really? Well, then...

891
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:23,837
I guess you wouldn't mind
us checking your room.

892
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:24,964
No,no,no!

893
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,924
Morty! McGurk!
Find the seed!

894
01:05:27,007 --> 01:05:28,259
No, you can't go up there!

895
01:05:28,342 --> 01:05:29,969
Guys, this is
ridiculous. Stop!

896
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:32,930
Hey!

897
01:05:33,347 --> 01:05:34,932
No, you can't
come in my room!

898
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:37,393
Find it!

899
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:44,692
Find it!

900
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,819
What is going on here?

901
01:05:46,986 --> 01:05:50,614
This doesn't involve you!
Get back downstairs!

902
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,074
Excuse me, down there!

903
01:05:52,157 --> 01:05:54,410
I don't care who you are,
you little crazy baby-man!

904
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:57,746
Get out of my house now.
This is outrageous.

905
01:05:58,038 --> 01:06:00,291
Fine. Sorry.

906
01:06:00,666 --> 01:06:03,585
Must have been a misunderstanding.
We'll be leaving now.

907
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:06,505
And my apologies, Ted.

908
01:06:09,174 --> 01:06:10,467
You be safe.

909
01:06:13,137 --> 01:06:14,596
Mind telling me
what's going on here?

910
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,140
The seed! Where is it?

911
01:06:16,223 --> 01:06:17,224
Seed?

912
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:20,060
Where's Grammy?

913
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,231
It's alive!

914
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:29,945
I remember you.

915
01:06:30,863 --> 01:06:32,698
Ted, what...

916
01:06:40,664 --> 01:06:41,707
Audrey!

917
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:46,336
Hey, did you want to
Well,okay!

918
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,381
Ted, what is this about?

919
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:51,592
It's about this.

920
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:53,427
Wait, wait, wait.

921
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:56,263
Is that... Yes. The
last Truffula seed.

922
01:06:56,430 --> 01:06:58,474
And you're going to help me plant
it right in the middle of town

923
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,309
where everyone can see it.

924
01:07:00,642 --> 01:07:02,394
I could just
kiss you right now!

925
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,441
We don't have
time for that.

926
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:09,610
I don't know,
we have a little time.

927
01:07:11,153 --> 01:07:13,781
But, you know what, let's just go.
Let's go. Forget about it.

928
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:43,310
Maniac!
Hey!

929
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:46,647
Ah!

930
01:07:48,857 --> 01:07:49,900
Here it comes!

931
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,905
I'm going for it.

932
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,424
Oh, hello!

933
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,690
Ted, big scary blimp coming.

934
01:08:41,368 --> 01:08:42,369
Whoa!

935
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:45,164
<i>You won't get away
with this, boy!</i>

936
01:08:45,664 --> 01:08:46,707
Bam!

937
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,969
<i>Go faster, you idiot!</i>

938
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,096
Yeah!

939
01:09:01,513 --> 01:09:03,307
Step on it, Ted!

940
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:05,100
Whoa!

941
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:16,153
You're fired!

942
01:09:16,778 --> 01:09:19,406
Whoa! Ted, look out!

943
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:26,079
Nobody beats Aloysius O...
Ted...

944
01:09:37,549 --> 01:09:38,967
This is not good.

945
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:41,053
How's it doing?

946
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,019
Whoa-ho-ho!

947
01:09:51,772 --> 01:09:52,773
Loser!

948
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,900
Oh, really?

949
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,111
Oh, no. The seed!

950
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:02,616
Get that seed!

951
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,041
Hang on! Here we go!

952
01:10:14,127 --> 01:10:15,170
Grammy!

953
01:10:23,387 --> 01:10:25,973
Seriously, how cool
is your grandma?

954
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:34,481
No!

955
01:10:38,068 --> 01:10:39,111
Come on!

956
01:10:39,945 --> 01:10:41,029
Yeah, that's right.

957
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,656
There it is!

958
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:55,168
Hey! Watch the road,
you meathead!

959
01:10:55,335 --> 01:10:56,336
Ah!

960
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:03,510
Hey, ow, ow!

961
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:05,512
Oh, come on!

962
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:16,606
What the...

963
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:20,485
Get it unstuck,
get it unstuck!

964
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,281
Bring it on, Teddy!

965
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,075
You don't have the guts!

966
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:28,869
Ted!

967
01:11:36,418 --> 01:11:37,878
Grammy!

968
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:44,384
Whoo-hoo!
Yes!

969
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,263
Hey, hey, hey!

970
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,931
Hey! It's Mr. O...

971
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,852
Take that, shorty!

972
01:12:11,453 --> 01:12:13,663
Okay, we have to get
this in the ground.

973
01:12:13,914 --> 01:12:16,458
But where?
There's no dirt anywhere.

974
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:21,630
No, Grammy...

975
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:28,428
Hey, get out of there!

976
01:12:30,222 --> 01:12:31,223
Ah!

977
01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:35,060
Hey!

978
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:38,355
What?

979
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:42,275
See, what did
I tell you? Easy. Huh?

980
01:12:42,734 --> 01:12:45,153
Hey, they broke
O'Hare's head!

981
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,447
What do you think
you're doing, kid?

982
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:51,076
Um, I'm looking for
a place to plant a tree.

983
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:52,244
A real one.

984
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,870
Why would we
need a tree?

985
01:12:53,954 --> 01:12:55,956
Exactly.

986
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:00,252
Oh, man.

987
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:01,962
Folks...

988
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:06,299
The last thing you
want around here is trees.

989
01:13:06,466 --> 01:13:08,009
They're filthy!

990
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:14,182
Spewing that sticky, nasty
sap all over the place.

991
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:19,229
They bring poisonous ants
and stinging bees.

992
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,939
Hey!
Ouch.

993
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,524
Think about the kids.

994
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:27,195
And, I just thought,
you know, they make leaves!

995
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:28,572
You know that, right?

996
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:30,574
Then these leaves,
they just fall.

997
01:13:30,657 --> 01:13:32,450
They just fall
wherever they want!

998
01:13:33,702 --> 01:13:35,912
Come on! We know why you're
really against trees.

999
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:38,290
Because they
produce fresh air.

1000
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,624
For free!

1001
01:13:39,708 --> 01:13:41,334
Oh!

1002
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:45,172
I am wounded!
You have lied!

1003
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:48,925
It is not a lie!
It's called photosynthesis.

1004
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,261
Come on.
She's making that up!

1005
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:54,139
That's a
made-up word, people!

1006
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:58,101
Thneedville is perfect
just the way it is.

1007
01:13:58,268 --> 01:14:00,270
We don't need trees!

1008
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,856
That boy has a seed.

1009
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,859
We need to stop him!
Who's with me? Come on!

1010
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,235
O'Hare is right!

1011
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:09,613
Seeds will ruin us all!
Stop it!

1012
01:14:10,739 --> 01:14:13,366
Last chance, kid.
Hand it over!

1013
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,202
Where do you think
you're going?

1014
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,786
Come on, let's go!

1015
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,997
Get in, get in!

1016
01:14:20,832 --> 01:14:22,125
Hey!

1017
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,085
Stop that maniac!

1018
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:28,715
Excuse me, excuse me.
Watch out!

1019
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,639
Ted, you're going
to hit the wall!

1020
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,682
Yeah. I know.

1021
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,875
Wow. Did you see that?

1022
01:15:04,584 --> 01:15:06,962
Who does this kid
think he is, huh?

1023
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:10,340
I am Ted Wiggins.

1024
01:15:11,049 --> 01:15:13,301
And I speak for the trees.

1025
01:15:13,969 --> 01:15:18,640
And the fact is, things aren't
perfect here in Thneedville.

1026
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,350
And they're only
going to get worse,

1027
01:15:20,433 --> 01:15:22,727
unless we do
something about it,

1028
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,480
unless we change our ways.

1029
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:28,942
And we can start
by planting this!

1030
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:40,870
Okay. Come on, now.
Everything is fine.

1031
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:42,831
Right?

1032
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:46,710
I say we tell this kid
what we think about that seed!

1033
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:51,339
People, come on!

1034
01:15:55,135 --> 01:15:57,220
You! Get out there right now

1035
01:15:57,304 --> 01:16:01,224
and get these people on my
side, or else you're fired!

1036
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:05,145
Go on, tell them
what you think.

1037
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:12,777
<i>You don't know me,
but my name's Cy</i>

1038
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:17,741
<i>I'm just
the O'Hare delivery guy</i>

1039
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:22,120
<i>But it seems like
trees might be worth a try</i>

1040
01:16:22,370 --> 01:16:25,832
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1041
01:16:28,877 --> 01:16:30,211
<i>My name is Dan</i>

1042
01:16:30,295 --> 01:16:31,504
<i>And my name's Rose</i>

1043
01:16:31,588 --> 01:16:34,299
<i>Our son Wesley kind of glows</i>

1044
01:16:34,549 --> 01:16:37,344
<i>And that's not good,
so we suppose</i>

1045
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:39,179
<i>We should let it grow</i>

1046
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,723
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1047
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,726
<i>You can't reap
what you don't sow</i>

1048
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:47,187
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1049
01:16:47,437 --> 01:16:49,689
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1050
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:52,317
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1051
01:16:52,567 --> 01:16:54,235
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1052
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:56,738
<i>My name's Marie,
and I am three!</i>

1053
01:16:57,072 --> 01:17:00,033
<i>I would really
like to see a tree</i>

1054
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,204
<i>I say let it grow</i>

1055
01:17:04,287 --> 01:17:07,707
<i>I'm Grammy Norma I'm old,
and I've got gray hair</i>

1056
01:17:08,083 --> 01:17:11,252
<i>But I remember when
trees were everywhere</i>

1057
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,922
<i>And no one
had to pay for air</i>

1058
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:15,799
<i>So I say let it grow</i>

1059
01:17:15,882 --> 01:17:18,218
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1060
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:21,513
<i>Like it did so long ago</i>

1061
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:23,848
<i>It is just one tiny seed</i>

1062
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,351
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1063
01:17:26,434 --> 01:17:29,104
<i>It's time to change
the life we lead</i>

1064
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:30,980
<i>Time to let it grow</i>

1065
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:34,401
<i>My name's O'Hare,
I'm one of you</i>

1066
01:17:34,609 --> 01:17:39,364
<i>I live here
in Thneedville, too</i>

1067
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:42,992
<i>The things you say
just might be true</i>

1068
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,454
<i>It could be time to start anew</i>

1069
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:51,626
<i>And maybe change
my point of view</i>

1070
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:55,046
Nah! I say let it die!

1071
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:57,340
<i>Let if die, let if die</i>

1072
01:17:57,590 --> 01:17:59,259
<i>Let it shrivel up and...</i>

1073
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,094
Come on, who's with me?

1074
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:02,887
Nobody.

1075
01:18:03,763 --> 01:18:05,265
<i>You greedy dirt-bag-'</i>

1076
01:18:06,141 --> 01:18:08,017
<i>Let it grow, let it grow</i>

1077
01:18:08,101 --> 01:18:11,146
<i>Let the love inside you show</i>

1078
01:18:11,229 --> 01:18:13,690
<i>Plant a seed inside the Earth</i>

1079
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:15,817
<i>Just one way to know its worth</i>

1080
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,570
<i>Let's celebrate
the world's rebirth</i>

1081

<i>We say let it grow</i>

1082
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:25,577

01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:29,122

1085
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:33,918
<i>But it's all we really need</i>

1086
01:18:34,002 --> 01:18:36,171
<i>It's time to
banish all your greed</i>

1087
01:18:36,254 --> 01:18:39,090
<i>Imagine Thneedville
flowered and treed</i>

1088
01:18:39,174 --> 01:18:44,179
<i>Let this be our solemn creed</i>

1089
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:46,931
Thank you, Ted.

1090
01:18:48,099 --> 01:18:51,519
<i>We say let it grow</i>

1091
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:54,105

<i>We say let it grow</i>

1093
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,361

01:20:17,689 --> 01:20:19,440
You done good, Beanpole.

1099
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:22,318
You done good.

1100
01:20:35,957 --> 01:20:38,626
By the way,
nice mustache.
