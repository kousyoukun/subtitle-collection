1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,468
If you've ever been afraid of anything,

2
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:06,499
This song's for you

3
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:07,934
I know you're feeling me

4
00:00:07,934 --> 00:00:10,970
If you ever wanted to do something big

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,721
But then you stopped just couldn't handle it

6
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:17,821
You can take a chance that it'll be all right

7
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:19,521
Come on come on come on come on come on

8
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:21,261
Come on you know it's time

9
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:23,131
Just pu-pu-push it down

10
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:24,871
And then you'll win the fight

11
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:26,531
You're better than this you're better than that

12
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:28,371
Come on let's make it right

13
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:31,771
Nothing's getting in my way now

14
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:34,841
Nothing ever will again

15
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:38,481
And if you're with me come on say now

16
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,911
We're gonna make it

17
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:42,611
Hey we're gonna take what we can

18
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:46,321
You're gonna sit up and let them know

19
00:00:46,351 --> 00:00:49,697
Just find the courage to get up and go

20
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:53,121
You're not gonna take it slow

21
00:00:53,357 --> 00:00:55,557
If you know what I'm sayin'

22
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:56,997
There's no time for waitin'

23
00:00:57,027 --> 00:01:00,128
A wish comes true every day

24
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:03,570
It's happening.

25
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,267
Today's the day

26
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:02,589
You know it is

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,867
Make it happen

28
00:01:04,907 --> 00:01:06,337
I know you can

29
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,507
You know you want to do just something big

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,836
Sorry Joey.

31
00:01:09,507 --> 00:01:11,407
Just take the plunge

32
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:14,777
It can happen to me

33
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,307
It can happen to you

34
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,107
Go on go on go on go on go on

35
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:19,477
Go make your wish come true

36
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:21,617
It's just the chance you got

37
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,417
To do what you want to

38
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:25,057
You're better than this, you're better than that.

39
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,157
You're gonna make it through

40
00:01:27,187 --> 00:01:29,827
Nothing's getting in my way now

41
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:33,200
Nothing ever will again

42
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:37,441
I love him.

43
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:39,981
Mm-hmm. 16. Yeah.

44
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:42,511
Today as a matter of fact.

45
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,708
You're gonna sit up and let them know

46
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:48,324
Just find the courage, get up and go

47
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:51,951
Surprise!

48
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,491
Happy Birthday Abby.

49
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:56,491
Oh my baby's 16. I can't believe it.

50
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:57,661
Bob are you crying?

51
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:59,531
What? No Sue.

52
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,931
I've got an eyelash in my eye. Oh.

53
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,331
Look it's your first 16th birthday picture.

54
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,201
Ech Dad.

55
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,871
What? I like it.

56
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:09,741
It's going to go on our family Web page.

57
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:11,241
- No.  - Come on sweetheart.

58
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,571
Make a wish.

59
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:14,641
Okay.

60
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:16,911
You know what I wish?

61
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:21,181
I wish my dear sweet family would finally understand

62
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:24,021
they can't just barge into my room any time they want.

63
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,991
I'm not a kid anymore.

64
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:28,691
I need privacy and boundaries.

65
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:30,661
I need my own space.

66
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,721
I've been looking forward to this day all my life

67
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:36,691
and now that it's here I wish you would all just get out

68
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,661
and stop spoiling it.

69
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,631
Love you.

70
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:50,041
I don't know.

71
00:02:53,981 --> 00:02:56,581
Mm. Ow. Ow! Eww.

72
00:02:59,581 --> 00:03:02,551
I'm 16 finally.

73
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,561
Today is going to be magical.

74
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:04,841
Told you she wouldn't like it.

75
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:06,381
I don't understand her.

76
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,981
She's probably nervous about her Sweet 16 party.

77
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:11,481
Oh Bob the party lights. They're in the garage.

78
00:04:11,521 --> 00:04:13,021
I'm on it.

79
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:14,451
Wow. Thanks.

80
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,451
Ah-ah. It's for your sister.

81
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,621
Too yellow.

82
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,661
Too blue.

83
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,091
Too pink.

84
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:27,831
Too nighttime.

85
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,101
Too daytime.

86
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:32,361
Too...15.

87
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:35,831
Perfect.

88
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,401
Hey Abs.

89
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:38,541
Hello. Knock much?

90
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,411
What?

91
00:04:43,441 --> 00:04:46,011
Mom made you a special birthday breakfast.

92
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,651
Aw that's sweet. Just put it over there.

93
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:53,321
Not you. The food.

94
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,991
Two secs.

95
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:56,751
This is your breakfast

96
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:57,851
Da na na na no

97
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:59,921
But I'm gonna eat it

98
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:03,261
You do realize that's not a real guitar.

99
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,991
Da na na now

100
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:07,361
- Mike! - Whoa.

101
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:09,861
Can I have a loan?

102
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,931
No you cannot have a loan.

103
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:15,041
I have been saving up for my Sweet 16 party tonight.

104
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,741
The best Sweet 16 party ever.

105
00:05:18,771 --> 00:05:20,941
Ah yes. Wish number 15.

106
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,941
What?

107
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,441
Abby's 16 wishes.

108
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:26,241
When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever.

109
00:05:26,281 --> 00:05:27,711
Hey that's private.

110
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:29,181
Yeah not really.

111
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:31,921
You honestly thought you'd get all this today?

112
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,081
I'm an essentially hopeful person.

113
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,621
The first one's hilarious.

114
00:05:36,621 --> 00:05:39,441
When I am sixteen, I'll meet Joey Lockhart.

115
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:42,031
The Joey Lockhart.

116
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:45,361
He's an international pop star with about a bazillion fans.

117
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,561
Why would you even wish that?

118
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,901
- I was 7.  - You were delusional.

119
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:53,001
You were 5 and wore a cape to school.

120
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:57,701
The other wishes are more realistic like wish number 3.

121
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:01,241
When I am sixteen, I'll decorate my room the way I want.

122
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:06,011
No no no.

123
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,611
Sassy.

124
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,951
Mm not a good idea Abs.

125
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,181
Why not?

126
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:17,321
If you decorate your room the way you dress ouch.

127
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:18,451
Ucch.

128
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:20,761
And what's with the mug shot on 16?

129
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,061
It's not a mug shot.

130
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,231
It's Logan Buchanan.

131
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,231
Your crushed on the quarterback?

132
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:30,171
For your information he's also in the drama club

133
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,801
and once attended Chess Masters.

134
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,501
I know. I was there.

135
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,011
He wanted to buy my chem notes.

136
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,441
He's perfect.

137
00:06:36,471 --> 00:06:39,881
And if I get my wish he'll talk to me today.

138
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:48,181
Aah! Ha ha ha!

139
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:50,251
Ohh. Krista Cook.

140
00:06:50,281 --> 00:06:51,421
Cool car.

141
00:06:51,451 --> 00:06:53,351
It's perfect! I love it!

142
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:55,351
It's not cool. It's terrible.

143
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,151
I don't know what I did to deserve this.

144
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:02,061
Why was Krista of all people born on the same day I was?

145
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,391
Yeah that must be annoying

146
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:06,161
how she always gets better stuff than you for her birthday.

147
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,301
I don't know why she hates me so much.

148
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,501
Ever since the third grade

149
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:16,101
she's always trying to ruin my birthday.

150
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:18,701
Which is also her birthday.

151
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,341
Why are you still here? Get out.

152
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,711
Dibs on the bathroom.

153
00:07:27,441 --> 00:07:28,741
Excuse you.

154
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,651
Golden hair a perfect face

155
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:38,321
There's something missing

156
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:41,251
Are you theirs?

157
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,891
Hard and sad

158
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,261
That someone's listening

159
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,721
Come on Abs. You've been in there for a year.

160
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,961
32 minutes.

161
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,361
Most girls take twice that.

162
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:57,301
Hold your horses.

163
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,951
Perfect.

164
00:08:18,991 --> 00:08:20,591
It's all yours.

165
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:27,131
Shouldn't have skipped breakfast.

166
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:36,081
Today is going to be perfect and nothing

167
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:40,861
not even Krista Cook is going to ruin it.

168
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,071
Wow. it's a major infestation.

169
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:24,641
Looks like it's been building for about oh 16 years

170
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,481
by the looks of it.

171
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,941
How long will it take to get them out?

172
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,781
Several days. A year at the most.

173
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,081
A year?

174
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:32,911
Oh.

175
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,781
I managed to save this.

176
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:35,951
Ohh.

177
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:44,821
This can't be happening not to me not today.

178
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,191
Daddy I left some clothes in my gym locker.

179
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:49,661
Please please please drive me to school.

180
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,811
I don't think so Pumpkin.

181
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:08,381
Sweet. Hey Krista.

182
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:11,311
Hey can I ride?

183
00:10:11,351 --> 00:10:12,821
Hop in.

184
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,381
Buckle up.

185
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,861
Great. I'll just take the bus.

186
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:33,361
By myself on my birthday.

187
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,971
Hmm.

188
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,221
Here.

189
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:59,261
Mm.

190
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,991
Thanks Jay.

191
00:11:02,031 --> 00:11:03,561
You look pathetic.

192
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,601
Nice to know I can count on you to state the obvious.

193
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:10,201
Sorry about your house.

194
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,971
How'd you know?

195
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,841
Krista texted the entire junior class.

196
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,571
That's just peachy.

197
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:20,811
What's this?

198
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:23,141
Happy Birthday?

199
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,411
Not really.

200
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,481
Come on.

201
00:11:28,581 --> 00:11:31,281
It's beautiful Jay. Where's the other half?

202
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,151
Best friends forever.

203
00:11:37,191 --> 00:11:39,061
Oh Jay that's sweet.

204
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,491
Do you like it?

205
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:41,561
I love it.

206
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:44,691
It's the best thing that's happened to me all day.

207
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:45,831
That bad huh?

208
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:47,201
Yes.

209
00:11:47,231 --> 00:11:49,561
I've been planning for this day for eight years.

210
00:11:50,901 --> 00:11:52,731
I mean this was supposed to be the day

211
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:55,171
I started acquiring all of the wonderful things

212
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:57,001
that come with being grown up...

213
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,271
things like freedom and privacy and respect.

214
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,481
But what do I get?

215
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:04,011
Wasps. Wasps.

216
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:07,451
Even my backyard is infested.

217
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:10,081
Where am I going to have my Sweet 16 party?

218
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,351
You could use my basement.

219
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:14,391
Ew. No.

220
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:15,551
All right.

221
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:17,761
Well the day is young.

222
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,721
Good things could still happen.

223
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:22,361
Like what? Like taking the bus?

224
00:12:22,391 --> 00:12:24,231
I hate taking the bus.

225
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:27,331
This is the worst birthdays in the history of birthdays.

226
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,741
Today wasn't supposed to be like this.

227
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,711
Today was supposed to be... magical.

228
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:55,481
Abigail Jensen?

229
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,791
Y-Y-Yes.

230
00:12:57,821 --> 00:12:59,251
This is for you.

231
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,431
Happy Birthday sweetie.

232
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:17,971
- Don't open it. - Why?

233
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:21,071
Real mail is delivered to your house not your bus stop.

234
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:23,181
- So?  - It could be a bomb.

235
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:26,581
It's not a bomb. It's a birthday present.

236
00:13:26,611 --> 00:13:27,811
And I'm opening it.

237
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:37,921
"Make a wish light a candle

238
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:40,561
and watch your Sweet 16 birthday wishes come true."

239
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:42,961
Great.

240
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:44,261
Candles.

241
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,991
Not even a stupid gift card.

242
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:47,531
Wait there's something else.

243
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,901
Hold this.

244
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:55,001
What are you doing?

245
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,971
Read wish number 8.

246
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,971
"When I'm 16..."

247
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:01,471
"I'll have my own car, preferably red."

248
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,671
I'm lighting one of these candles.

249
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,541
What if something bad happens?

250
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:07,181
What if something good happens?

251
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:09,751
And look if it's a joke

252
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:12,081
the worst that can happen is we take the bus.

253
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:13,121
Here.

254
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,401
Ladies and gentlemen

255
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,201
Joey Lockhart

256
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:44,881
You Abby Jensen?

257
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,011
Yes.

258
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,151
Hurry up

259
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,611
Put on my pretty shoes

260
00:14:53,321 --> 00:14:54,551
Hurry up

261
00:14:54,581 --> 00:14:56,221
Happy Birthday Abby.

262
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:57,951
Fairytales come true.

263
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:58,951
Thanks.

264
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:03,561
Here we are just us girls

265
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:06,861
All of the stuff having fun

266
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:09,531
In the princess world

267
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:12,461
The princess world

268
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:15,871
The princess world

269
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:26,911
Oh what just happened?

270
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:30,551
I've had a crush on him since I was 7.

271
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,651
When I'm 16 I'll meet Joey Lockhart.

272
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:34,951
What are you talking about?

273
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,451
It's wish number 1.

274
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:38,421
Look Jay. The candles work.

275
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,821
Yeah but we're still stuck taking the bus.

276
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,321
Maybe not.

277
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,091
I lit candle number 1 and wish number 1 on my list came true.

278
00:15:49,131 --> 00:15:50,831
I think the numbers on the candles

279
00:15:50,861 --> 00:15:53,561
correspond with the numbers on my wish list.

280
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:55,031
Give me number 8.

281
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:06,411
When I'm 16 I'll have my own car preferably red.

282
00:16:10,181 --> 00:16:11,311
No way.

283
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,651
Way.

284
00:16:16,121 --> 00:16:17,481
Check it out.

285
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:21,381
Gosh this is fun.

286
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:24,221
I can't believe it. This is my dream car.

287
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:26,021
It's all yours sweetie. Want to drive?

288
00:16:26,061 --> 00:16:27,291
- Yes. - No.

289
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:29,021
Come on. I have my permit.

290
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:30,231
My dad lets me practice

291
00:16:30,261 --> 00:16:31,731
in the Hasty Mart parking lot all the time.

292
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:34,261
Yeah at midnight when it's empty.

293
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:36,731
Abby when a total stranger drives up to you on the street

294
00:16:36,771 --> 00:16:38,801
and offers you a car you can't just take it.

295
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,641
She's not a total stranger. You look very familiar.

296
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:43,571
Well we're not doing this.

297
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:45,471
- Why not? - Yeah why not?

298
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:48,641
Because... you don't have a driver's license

299
00:16:48,681 --> 00:16:50,111
until you take the test after school.

300
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:53,251
Good point. I'll drive. You two get in.

301
00:16:53,281 --> 00:16:54,911
What? Not until you tell us who you are.

302
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:58,281
I'm Celeste. I'm here to make Abby's 16 wishes come true.

303
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:02,491
Oh. Well that explains pretty much exactly nothing.

304
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,021
Come on Jay. This is the most

305
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:09,161
wonderful amazing magical thing that's ever happened to me.

306
00:17:10,591 --> 00:17:12,591
50 years from now when you're looking back at your life

307
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,261
don't you want to be able to say

308
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,361
you had the guts to get in the car?

309
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:20,971
I'm going to regret this.

310
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:24,801
Yes! Get your stuff. Come on. Get in the car.

311
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,641
All right go go go.

312
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:34,401
Just so we're clear you're some kind of magical being

313
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:35,511
like an elf or a fairy?

314
00:17:35,551 --> 00:17:37,281
Sure. Why not?

315
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:38,431
You don't sound so sure.

316
00:17:38,431 --> 00:17:39,521
Jay.

317
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:41,021
You just do birthdays or other events too?

318
00:17:41,051 --> 00:17:42,481
He babbles when he's nervous.

319
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:46,021
Why don't you relax Jay and enjoy the ride?

320
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:49,191
Hold on.

321
00:17:52,391 --> 00:17:55,301
Whoa! Mommy!

322
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:01,871
That was awesome.

323
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:03,571
Have we landed yet? What's it look like?

324
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:05,241
- What does what look like?  - Her home planet.

325
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:06,801
Sorry Jay.

326
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:10,741
The only alien planet you'll be visiting today is high school.

327
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:19,031
I already have my license. My dad has connections at the DMV.

328
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,151
Yo Logan check out that ride.

329
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,721
Hey Jensen did you get new wheels too?

330
00:18:36,701 --> 00:18:38,901
Yeah. These are my new wheels

331
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:45,871
which I bought myself for my birthday which is today.

332
00:18:45,911 --> 00:18:46,911
Cool.

333
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:50,181
No way this is yours.

334
00:18:50,211 --> 00:18:53,051
What can I say? I'm a saver not a spender like you.

335
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,571
Oh man. I got to make some bank.

336
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:09,191
Come on.

337
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:12,921
- What are you doing?  - Saving you from more humiliation.

338
00:19:13,571 --> 00:19:15,031
What? I'm not humiliated.

339
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:16,501
This is the best birthday ever.

340
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,801
Look. Wish number 15.

341
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:20,701
When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever.

342
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,171
If the candles keep working like this

343
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:24,171
my party's going to be sick.

344
00:19:25,371 --> 00:19:28,171
Hey party tonight at my house. You're all invited.

345
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,251
Come on.

346
00:19:37,281 --> 00:19:38,381
Come on. It's okay.

347
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:39,951
It's okay.

348
00:19:48,531 --> 00:19:50,831
- Want to make some cash?  - Yes.

349
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,431
Put these up everywhere.

350
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:55,571
Meet me at the voting table after first period.

351
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,671
Okay. You go find some real clothes to wear.

352
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,871
I'll tell Miss Hackl you got a late time okay?

353
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:05,911
Thanks Jay.

354
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,341
When I'm 16 I'll have the cutest clothes in school.

355
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,601
Oh... For me? Thank you.

356
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:39,971
Okay.

357
00:20:43,241 --> 00:20:45,971
Wish number 2. All right.

358
00:20:51,081 --> 00:20:52,151
Okay.

359
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:03,051
What?

360
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:17,441
What's going on? Come on.

361
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:24,511
- Uh Miss Duffy.  -Jensen.

362
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,781
I'll take that.

363
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,851
Keep it up Theodore and you'll be president one day.

364
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:43,281
- You really think so?  - Absolutely.

365
00:21:46,951 --> 00:21:48,191
So you can tell the future too?

366
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:49,951
Oh no. Just gave Ted hope.

367
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:51,021
Come on in.

368
00:21:54,561 --> 00:21:55,931
So what's up sweetie?

369
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,931
What's up? You know what's up.

370
00:21:57,961 --> 00:22:00,631
That's why you're here pretending to be the counselor.

371
00:22:00,661 --> 00:22:02,561
Why didn't that stupid candle light?

372
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,231
- Because of the rules.  - The rules?

373
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,861
Oh boy. You don't get out much do you?

374
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,131
What are you talking about?

375
00:22:10,171 --> 00:22:12,941
The candles are magic and all magic has rules.

376
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,741
One candle and one wish per hour.

377
00:22:15,771 --> 00:22:17,971
You lit candle number 1 at 7:58 this morning

378
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:19,811
and Joey Lockhart showed up.

379
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,141
Then you lit candle number 8 at precisely 8 A.M.

380
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:26,321
Your wishes were two minutes apart but within different hours.

381
00:22:26,351 --> 00:22:29,081
Oh. So now I have to wait...

382
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,751
- 27 minutes... - before I make another wish.

383
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:34,461
Great. You could have printed that on the box you know.

384
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,291
Any other magic candle rules I should know about?

385
00:22:38,331 --> 00:22:41,301
Only one but it's a doozy.

386
00:22:41,331 --> 00:22:44,131
The magic in the candles expires at midnight tonight

387
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:46,401
so no more wishes after then.

388
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:49,611
Oh and all the wishes you've made by then become permanent.

389
00:22:49,641 --> 00:22:51,411
- At midnight. - Yeah.

390
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:54,541
So at midnight that gorgeous car out there is mine forever?

391
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:55,711
Absolutely.

392
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:59,781
And in 26 1/2 minutes I'll have cuter clothes than Krista Cook.

393
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:01,681
Yeah.

394
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,791
She really can't stand you.

395
00:23:03,821 --> 00:23:06,761
Oh. You know about that?

396
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:13,931
I shouldn't do this but...

397
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:17,301
Read for yourself.

398
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:24,571
Oh no. I couldn't.

399
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,101
Well maybe just a page or two.

400
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,571
I suggest 10 23 and 37.

401
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:33,881
Oh. Be a little more careful where you light those puppies.

402
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,181
Thanks.

403
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:51,431
Whoa. Good stuff?

404
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,001
You have no idea.

405
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:05,541
Thanks for voting for me.

406
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:06,981
Krista!

407
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:10,211
I know you've loathed me since we were 8 years old

408
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,491
but I didn't know you've been keeping score.

409
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:15,981
- Where did you get that?  - From the Birthday Fairy.

410
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,151
Right. Give it to me.

411
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,921
When we were 10 I had my first sleepover

412
00:24:20,951 --> 00:24:22,351
so you decided to have one too

413
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:25,091
but you paid everybody to come to yours.

414
00:24:26,561 --> 00:24:28,861
You have no right to read that. It's mine.

415
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:30,731
Well then why is it all about me?

416
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:34,861
When we were 12 I entered the school talent show

417
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:36,131
with my baton twirling act.

418
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,801
So you entered too. Juggling 12 batons.

419
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,371
Every year you competed with me and every year you've won.

420
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:44,241
You've tortured me since the third grade.

421
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:45,411
Can you just give it a rest?

422
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,741
Don't play innocent with me. You know what you did.

423
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:49,371
And for this

424
00:24:49,371 --> 00:24:51,881
I'm going to make sure nobody comes to your party.

425
00:24:51,911 --> 00:24:54,081
Here.

426
00:24:54,111 --> 00:24:55,211
What's this?

427
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:58,081
It's an invitation to my Sweet 16 birthday party tonight.

428
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,581
Everybody's going to be there.

429
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:03,891
Now if you'll excuse me I have some campaigning to do.

430
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,591
Krista you don't need to campaign.

431
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:08,791
You're the only name on the ballot running for president.

432
00:25:08,831 --> 00:25:10,491
Well then I'm sure to win.

433
00:25:10,531 --> 00:25:11,961
Why are you doing this?

434
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,301
You're not even interested in student government.

435
00:25:13,331 --> 00:25:14,601
And you are?

436
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:17,861
- Well I...  - I didn't think so.

437
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:20,801
Hey Krista.

438
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,541
So they said you needed help with something?

439
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:27,341
- Hand these out for me.  - Sure.

440
00:25:27,371 --> 00:25:28,341
Thanks.

441
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:35,281
She's doing it. She's ruining my birthday.

442
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:36,381
Again.

443
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:39,481
Just don't let her get to you.

444
00:25:39,511 --> 00:25:41,051
You're right Jay.

445
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,721
I'm going to put an end to her reign of terror.

446
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,400
Right about now.

447
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,230
List. Okay.

448
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,670
When I'm 16 I'll have the cutest clothes in school.

449
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Hi-hi.

450
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,810
- Celeste it's beautiful. - I know right?

451
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,980
I've been waiting for you to make this wish.

452
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,980
I just love shopping especially when it's free.

453
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,750
I don't even know where to start.

454
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,190
That's what I'm here for.

455
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,750
Now close your eyes and let me work my magic.

456
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,460
Ever since the third grade whatever I did Krista did better.

457
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,860
She's never satisfied unless she's winning and I'm losing.

458
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:53,945
But today I decided

459
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,565
she's not going to make me miserable anymore.

460
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:02,765
I have a plan and this wish it's the first part.

461
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:04,335
Would you say Krista Cook always has

462
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,735
the cutest clothes in school?

463
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,745
And shoes and handbags.

464
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:10,975
Not anymore.

465
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:29,195
That top is not an original you-know-who is it?

466
00:27:29,225 --> 00:27:32,335
- It is.  - Shut up.

467
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:36,235
Oh those shoes are so to die for. I hate you.

468
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:38,735
- Want to have lunch near us? - Sure.

469
00:27:38,775 --> 00:27:41,835
Yay. I totally just want to sit next to that handbag.

470
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:43,905
You mean this handbag?

471
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:49,375
I got it for my birthday last year.

472
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:50,975
You're not all that Jensen.

473
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,885
Yoo-hoo Abby!

474
00:27:57,985 --> 00:27:59,685
I'm so sorry.

475
00:27:59,725 --> 00:28:01,285
Give me that old thing.

476
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:05,495
This one's so hot it hasn't even come out yet.

477
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,225
Thank you so much.

478
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,825
I'll just ship you the rest of the collection

479
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:11,565
when the infestation's over.

480
00:28:11,595 --> 00:28:13,065
Auf Wiedersehen.

481
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:30,715
I know what you're doing and it's not going to work.

482
00:28:32,185 --> 00:28:35,045
I'm just trying to have the best birthday of my entire life.

483
00:28:35,085 --> 00:28:37,585
Well good luck with that because it's not over yet.

484
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:02,675
All right everybody. On the track in five.

485
00:29:02,705 --> 00:29:04,735
Late again Jensen.

486
00:29:06,775 --> 00:29:09,175
Yes Miss Duffy I am late.

487
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:12,115
I had to go back to my locker for this.

488
00:29:13,175 --> 00:29:15,015
I see.

489
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,485
That's still no excuse for tardiness

490
00:29:16,515 --> 00:29:18,985
but that is a beautiful bag.

491
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:23,485
- It's for you.  - Me?

492
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:25,195
I was saving it for your Christmas present

493
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:29,925
but look it matches your track suit perfectly.

494
00:29:29,965 --> 00:29:31,435
Ha ha! It actually does.

495
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:32,365
Happy Monday.

496
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,635
Well Happy Monday to me.

497
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:38,835
Well ladies what do you say instead of running killer laps

498
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:41,265
we all have a nice friendly game of volleyball?

499
00:29:42,935 --> 00:29:44,005
Way to go Abby.

500
00:30:06,725 --> 00:30:08,525
Come on. We need her.

501
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:09,665
Jensen!

502
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,695
Get out here!

503
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:20,235
When I'm 16 I'll beat Krista at something, anything,

504
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:22,005
everything...

505
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:46,465
Play ball!

506
00:30:54,535 --> 00:30:56,335
You sure you're ready for this?

507
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,005
Why shouldn't I be sure?

508
00:30:58,035 --> 00:31:00,345
Because you're the least athletic person I know.

509
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,175
Not anymore. I got the birthday mojo.

510
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:04,845
Duck!

511
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,715
1-zip.

512
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,045
You tried to hit me.

513
00:31:09,085 --> 00:31:12,455
It's called spiking. It's how you win.

514
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:15,325
Play ball!

515
00:31:44,315 --> 00:31:46,715
MVP! MVP!

516
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:50,885
Hey, are you all right? I'm going to call the nurse okay?

517
00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:52,015
Just hanging there.

518
00:31:52,055 --> 00:31:56,255
MVP! MVP! MVP!

519
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:05,765
Oh well look who's awake.

520
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:10,535
- How are you feeling? - I'm fine.

521
00:32:10,565 --> 00:32:12,275
I had a weird nightmare.

522
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,705
Oh honey that was real. Abby Jensen creamed you.

523
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:17,605
Oh and you're wanted in the principal's office.

524
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:34,425
- Yeah, that's classical.  - Yeah that's so true, so true.

525
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,445
- Makes my day.  -Y eah.

526
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:39,165
You wanted to see me, Mr. Smith?

527
00:32:39,195 --> 00:32:41,465
Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:32:41,505 --> 00:32:45,235
Big news, Cook. The election's over.

529
00:32:45,275 --> 00:32:48,275
How can it be over? A lot of people haven't voted yet.

530
00:32:49,405 --> 00:32:53,715
Actually we had a 100% voter turnout.

531
00:32:57,555 --> 00:32:58,785
What's going on here?

532
00:33:03,695 --> 00:33:08,495
Good morning students!

533
00:33:08,525 --> 00:33:10,495
I'm very pleased to announce

534
00:33:10,535 --> 00:33:14,165
the winner of the most votes for the Student Body President

535
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:18,235
is Abby Jensen!

536
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,075
Yes!

537
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:24,975
I just want to thank everyone who voted for me

538
00:33:24,975 --> 00:33:26,715
and made this dream possible.

539
00:33:26,795 --> 00:33:30,735
No! It's not possible. Her name isn't even on the ballot.

540
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:37,385
Let... go.

541
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,525
That is all.

542
00:33:45,355 --> 00:33:46,865
Abby was a write-in.

543
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:55,865
Better luck next time Krista.

544
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:25,025
Ha! I finally beat Krista Cook.

545
00:34:25,055 --> 00:34:28,625
- Had a little help.  -I  know. Isn't it amazing?

546
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:30,455
This day just keeps getting better and better.

547
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:31,725
Yeah for you.

548
00:34:31,765 --> 00:34:32,765
I know right?

549
00:34:36,015 --> 00:34:38,125
Can we just do this experiment? We both need extra credit.

550
00:34:39,205 --> 00:34:40,365
Nah.

551
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:41,605
I'll just give the teacher

552
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,335
some strappy sandals and a pashmina.

553
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:48,475
- No. Just give it a rest.  - What's wrong with you?

554
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,105
I don't know. This whole wish thing.

555
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:52,565
You're changing too fast Abby. I can't keep up.

556
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:53,895
What do you mean?

557
00:34:53,935 --> 00:34:56,705
You've always been allergic to volunteer work.

558
00:34:56,735 --> 00:34:58,835
And now all of a sudden you're Student Body President?

559
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:00,105
What can I say?

560
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:03,105
The people spoke and they wanted me.

561
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:06,145
The candles spoke and you have no idea what you just wished for.

562
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:07,505
Yes I do.

563
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:11,545
Being president is like an honor.

564
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:14,215
Being president is an important job Abby.

565
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,185
It should do to someone who really wants it.

566
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,745
Oh like who? Like Krista?

567
00:35:19,215 --> 00:35:20,215
No.

568
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:23,515
Well I'm sure I'll do just fine.

569
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,135
I'll have you to help me.

570
00:35:25,755 --> 00:35:28,025
Come on. You can't be mad at me.

571
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,155
Why not?

572
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:31,435
Because it's my birthday.

573
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,525
Because we're best friends.

574
00:35:38,135 --> 00:35:40,845
Because I'm Student Body President

575
00:35:40,955 --> 00:35:43,635
and I get free lunch. Ta-da!

576
00:35:44,545 --> 00:35:45,575
No way.

577
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:48,075
Way way. Every day.

578
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:50,915
Now hand over your goofy glasses

579
00:35:50,945 --> 00:35:53,985
and let your commander in chief buy you a sandwich.

580
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:58,825
- What kind of sandwich?   - Any kind you want.

581
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:06,515
Come on.

582
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:09,335
There she is!

583
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:13,375
You see? Ha ha. They love me.

584
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:15,075
What have you done now?

585
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:17,275
Wish number 10.

586
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:21,345
I looked in the mirror and I was tired of being invisible.

587
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,045
When I'm 16 I'll be popular.

588
00:36:24,075 --> 00:36:25,615
Oh hi Joey.

589
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:27,985
Abby smile!

590
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:29,945
Sure I'll sign it.

591
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:34,585
I loved that wish.

592
00:36:35,335 --> 00:36:36,705
Right.

593
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:43,095
Okay people make a hole!

594
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,255
Here she comes!

595
00:36:44,295 --> 00:36:45,325
Back up. Come on.

596
00:36:45,365 --> 00:36:46,925
Thank you. Okay.

597
00:36:46,965 --> 00:36:48,125
Peeps.

598
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:54,305
And I don't have to do a thing. Just show up.

599
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,045
They're planning your birthday party.

600
00:36:57,085 --> 00:36:58,515
Mm-hmm.

601
00:37:01,215 --> 00:37:03,115
Their dads are business partners.

602
00:37:03,155 --> 00:37:05,155
Apparently they own half of Vegas.

603
00:37:05,185 --> 00:37:07,055
They're throwing my party at one of their hotels.

604
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:11,985
Not to rain on your birthday parade Abs but Vegas?

605
00:37:12,025 --> 00:37:14,325
That's not really your style.

606
00:37:14,355 --> 00:37:15,925
And your basement is?

607
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:17,755
Hey I have foosball.

608
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:20,025
Good point.

609
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:23,565
Look this is my one and only Sweet 16 birthday party.

610
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:25,775
I... I want it to be spectacular.

611
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:30,215
I don't have anything to wear.

612
00:37:30,245 --> 00:37:32,085
Well we both have a free period right now.

613
00:37:32,115 --> 00:37:34,015
Let's go buy you a dress.

614
00:37:34,055 --> 00:37:37,915
We can't. The wasps are holding my party money hostage.

615
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,125
I'll supply you the cash.

616
00:37:39,155 --> 00:37:40,785
You'd do that?

617
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:41,925
Sure.

618
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:44,225
Jay you're the best.

619
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:00,435
We can't go.

620
00:38:00,465 --> 00:38:02,675
I don't have my license yet.

621
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:08,345
A reading from the Wish List of Abigail Jensen.

622
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,775
Wish number 7... When I'm 16...

623
00:38:10,775 --> 00:38:12,495
I'll get my driver's license.

624
00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:39,445
Abigail Louise Jensen?

625
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:41,915
Yes.

626
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:43,945
This is highly unusual.

627
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:51,785
My driver's license!

628
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:55,825
And there ya go.

629
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:57,345
Thank you so much!

630
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:05,835
Oh lighten up Harry.

631
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:08,705
You needed to get out of that cubicle anyway.

632
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:10,475
But we really don't do this kind of thing.

633
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:11,735
I know.

634
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:14,175
But wasn't it fun?

635
00:39:14,205 --> 00:39:15,675
My cubicle was fun.

636
00:39:19,745 --> 00:39:21,545
My baby

637
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:23,215
Goin' for a ride

638
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:35,125
Ride and ride and ride

639
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,195
Ride and ride and ride...

640
00:39:42,835 --> 00:39:44,675
- Jay?  - Yes Abs.

641
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:47,605
This is now officially the best 16th birthday

642
00:39:47,645 --> 00:39:49,655
in the history of 16th birthdays.

643
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,215
Abby you can't afford a hanger here.

644
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:56,545
Not true.

645
00:39:56,585 --> 00:39:58,085
Since I don't have to pay for my own party

646
00:39:58,115 --> 00:40:00,645
I'm spending every penny I saved on the perfect dress.

647
00:40:02,915 --> 00:40:03,915
Come on!

648
00:40:11,925 --> 00:40:13,755
- What do you think?  - It's nice.

649
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:16,535
No. Too disco.

650
00:40:26,105 --> 00:40:28,075
What about this one?

651
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:32,415
You're... It's beautiful.

652
00:40:32,445 --> 00:40:34,985
But do you think Logan will like it?

653
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,545
How should I know?

654
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:37,655
Touchy.

655
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,285
Why don't you just light No. 16 right now

656
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:40,715
and make the stupid wish?

657
00:40:40,755 --> 00:40:42,385
Poof. Logan Buchanan is yours.

658
00:40:42,425 --> 00:40:43,355
It doesn't work that way.

659
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:44,655
Uh yes it does.

660
00:40:44,695 --> 00:40:46,355
It's worked that way all day.

661
00:40:46,395 --> 00:40:48,525
No, I want Logan to like me for me

662
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:52,495
not because I put some magic birthday spell on him.

663
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:53,895
I'm trying this on.

664
00:40:56,765 --> 00:40:58,065
And these.

665
00:41:18,615 --> 00:41:21,985
I'll take these.

666
00:41:22,015 --> 00:41:23,955
I really feel for you.

667
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:27,285
Wasting your time on kids like that.

668
00:41:27,325 --> 00:41:28,525
A customer's a customer.

669
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:30,625
Oh trust me.

670
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,355
They won't be buying anything.

671
00:41:34,395 --> 00:41:37,065
Look Jay. It's perfect isn't it?

672
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:38,665
Sure.

673
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:41,735
Well I love it and I think Logan's going to love it too.

674
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,435
Good. Sold.

675
00:41:43,465 --> 00:41:45,305
Can we go now?

676
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,825
Don't be so grumpy.

677
00:41:48,075 --> 00:41:49,175
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:51,275
This is a store not a playground.

679
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:52,945
Exactly.

680
00:41:52,985 --> 00:41:54,045
I like this one.

681
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:55,315
I'm sure you do.

682
00:41:55,355 --> 00:41:57,555
Why don't you kids just come back with your parents?

683
00:41:57,585 --> 00:41:59,855
We're not kids. I'm 16.

684
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:01,225
Congratulations.

685
00:42:01,255 --> 00:42:02,285
Now give me the dress.

686
00:42:02,325 --> 00:42:04,225
No we're buying it!

687
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:06,265
Jay show her your money.

688
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:13,565
- My wallet...  - You out.

689
00:42:13,605 --> 00:42:15,705
But. No no no, you can't.

690
00:42:15,735 --> 00:42:17,175
Watch me.

691
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:20,005
But we're customers!

692
00:42:20,045 --> 00:42:21,405
No you're children.

693
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:24,075
Get that dress off now.

694
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:45,065
Wish number 9...

695
00:42:56,945 --> 00:43:01,785
When I'm 16 people will stop treating me like a kid.

696
00:43:13,995 --> 00:43:16,495
When I'm 16 people will stop treating me like a kid.

697
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:34,915
Um excuse me where's my friend?

698
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,715
There was a boy here

699
00:43:36,745 --> 00:43:39,485
but he left with a girl in the cutest little yellow car...

700
00:43:39,515 --> 00:43:42,145
Wait. He left with Krista?

701
00:43:42,185 --> 00:43:43,855
It appears so.

702
00:43:43,885 --> 00:43:46,925
Turn around.

703
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:48,385
That outfit is all wrong.

704
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,055
It's far too young for you.

705
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,855
And suddenly really tight.

706
00:43:51,895 --> 00:43:55,525
Let's get you into something more age appropriate.

707
00:43:55,565 --> 00:43:58,965
Let's try these.

708
00:43:58,995 --> 00:44:01,735
But I don't have any money.

709
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:05,235
Oh we'll just put them on your charge account.

710
00:44:05,275 --> 00:44:09,375
I have a charge account?

711
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:11,075
Is everything all right Miss Jensen?

712
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:12,345
Oh yeah.

713
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:14,795
Everything is just fine.

714
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:20,315
It's a picture perfect world

715
00:44:20,355 --> 00:44:23,325
A picture perfect world

716
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,275
This time we're doing it our way

717
00:44:28,315 --> 00:44:29,545
Thank you so much.

718
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:31,815
We've got a new perspective

719
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:34,915
It's time for us to make the grade

720
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:36,955
Head in a new direction

721
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:40,725
So it's a picture perfect world we live in

722
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:42,485
Starting today

723
00:44:42,525 --> 00:44:46,195
It's a picture perfect world we're given

724
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:49,065
Make no mistake

725
00:44:49,095 --> 00:44:51,335
The sun's in the sky

726
00:44:59,805 --> 00:45:01,835
Sorry Miss Duffy.

727
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,635
Do we know each other?

728
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:06,205
Yeah.

729
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,945
Ah you're the new substitute teacher

730
00:45:07,975 --> 00:45:10,875
which means I don't have to babysit those little monsters.

731
00:45:10,915 --> 00:45:13,015
They're all yours.

732
00:45:47,265 --> 00:45:48,065
Jay!

733
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:56,525
I'll be right back.

734
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:58,125
Oh great.

735
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,095
Leave me to wrangle the blob all alone.

736
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:03,365
Okay go.

737
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:11,705
Yes?

738
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:12,805
Get out here!

739
00:46:15,575 --> 00:46:16,875
What's wrong with you?

740
00:46:16,905 --> 00:46:18,275
Excuse me?

741
00:46:18,305 --> 00:46:21,115
You left me stranded on my birthday.

742
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,145
What kind of a best friend does that?

743
00:46:23,185 --> 00:46:25,585
Best friend? What are you talking about?

744
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,285
Oh hi. My name is Abby Jensen.

745
00:46:27,315 --> 00:46:29,255
Have we met?

746
00:46:29,285 --> 00:46:31,785
Yeah. A long time ago I think.

747
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:32,785
Shut up.

748
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:34,425
Stop it.

749
00:46:34,455 --> 00:46:35,395
I'm not your best friend.

750
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:40,665
I'm a sophomore. You're a... woman.

751
00:46:40,695 --> 00:46:43,295
Thank you but I'm just four months older than you.

752
00:46:43,335 --> 00:46:45,335
Yeah in dog years.

753
00:46:45,365 --> 00:46:48,005
Listen I'm in the middle of an important experiment...

754
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,975
And I'm in the middle of an important birthday!

755
00:46:50,005 --> 00:46:51,345
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

756
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:55,075
- No wait...  - Let go.

757
00:46:59,545 --> 00:47:00,515
Jay Kepler!

758
00:47:00,555 --> 00:47:02,615
You're the worst best friend ever!

759
00:47:04,585 --> 00:47:05,655
I don't understand.

760
00:47:05,685 --> 00:47:07,685
Am I being expelled?

761
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:10,995
I'm sure they'll explain everything.

762
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,365
Mom? Dad?

763
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:15,095
What's the truck for?

764
00:47:15,135 --> 00:47:16,145
Are we moving?

765
00:47:17,135 --> 00:47:18,405
Just come with us.

766
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,575
Not until somebody tells me what's going on?

767
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:25,875
Abby you can't go to high school anymore.

768
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:27,275
What? Why not?

769
00:47:27,315 --> 00:47:28,445
Because it's time you grow up.

770
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:29,745
- Bob.  - What?

771
00:47:29,785 --> 00:47:31,115
Sweetheart while the house is being fumigated

772
00:47:31,155 --> 00:47:32,455
there just really isn't room for you.

773
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:33,355
So your dad and I were talking...

774
00:47:33,355 --> 00:47:34,515
We found you an apartment...

775
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,755
A what?

776
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:37,895
An apartment.

777
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:38,925
To live in.

778
00:47:39,655 --> 00:47:40,955
By myself?

779
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,440
It's a very safe neighborhood.

780
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:56,610
Is that what you call it?

781
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,040
I call it pricey.

782
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,940
Your dad and I paid the security deposit

783
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,710
but the first month's rent is your responsibility.

784
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,850
Okay I'll get the last load.

785
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,220
You're going to need a full-time job.

786
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,520
I circled some good ones...

787
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,460
What? No. I can't go to school and have a job.

788
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,990
Oh well if you're ready for college... Bob!

789
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,260
Yeah!

790
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:22,300
She wants to go to college!

791
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,730
No not yet!

792
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,700
Never mind.

793
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:25,800
Ok.

794
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,430
Mom I'm just a kid!

795
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,010
I can't live here by myself!

796
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,440
Abby don't be so dramatic.

797
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,640
Lots of girls your age have their own apartments.

798
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,970
I moved out when I was 18.

799
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:36,170
But I'm not 18.

800
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:37,340
No you're 21.

801
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,340
22 today.

802
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:40,180
Happy Birthday sweetheart.

803
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,950
What are you talking about?

804
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:43,280
Let's go Sue.

805
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,780
No! Don't go!

806
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,940
Just remember we did this out of love...

807
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:47,890
Yeah tough love.

808
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,950
Bob!

809
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,420
You'll be fine Pumpkin.

810
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,430
Dad Dad...

811
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:02,640
- Mom...  - Come and visit anytime.

812
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:03,520
Except Wednesdays.

813
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:04,900
Wednesday is our bowling night.

814
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,560
High school memories?

815
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,250
No.

816
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,460
When I'm 16 people will stop treating me like a kid.

817
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,980
Let's get you into something more age appropriate.

818
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,280
You're the new substitute teacher.

819
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,020
Stop it! I'm not your best friend.

820
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:00,890
I'm a sophomore.

821
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,850
You're a... woman.

822
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:06,620
- No you're 21.  - 22 today.

823
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,460
Happy Birthday sweetheart.

824
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:10,560
Oh no.

825
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:11,830
No no no.

826
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,000
This isn't what I wanted!

827
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,970
Celeste!

828
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,470
Celeste I need to talk to you!

829
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,680
Right now!

830
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,480
The list.

831
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:41,930
There's gotta be a wish.

832
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,670
That's it! Wish number 3.

833
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,530
That should do it.

834
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,180
When I'm 16 I'll decorate my room the way I want.

835
00:50:59,410 --> 00:51:00,610
Yoo-hoo!

836
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:02,910
Decorator's Delight!

837
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,350
- Celeste! I'm so glad you're here...  - Me too.

838
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,290
Okay. Nice.

839
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,360
Lots of potential.

840
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,060
- I need your help.  - You sure do.

841
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:14,590
- Maybe some wallpaper...  - No no wallpaper.

842
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,090
Paint then.

843
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:17,090
Let's look at some samples.

844
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,230
No listen to me.

845
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,960
Your magic candles made a mistake.

846
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,130
Candles don't make mistakes.

847
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,830
- People do.  - No.

848
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:25,700
I made a wish but it wasn't really my wish.

849
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,500
How about some curtains?

850
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:28,640
No!

851
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:29,740
Oo bad decision.

852
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:30,770
You need privacy.

853
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,540
You're alone.

854
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,720
- You're a woman... - No I'm not!

855
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,680
I'm not a woman!

856
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,050
I'm 16 years old!

857
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:40,890
I made a wish... wish number 9.

858
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,180
I didn't want to be an adult!

859
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:44,660
I just wanted to be treated like one!

860
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:46,250
The candles have their own logic.

861
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,520
They don't always give you what you want.

862
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:49,030
Sometimes they give you what you need.

863
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,000
And sweetie you need drapes pronto.

864
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,970
I don't need drapes!

865
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,670
I need my life back!

866
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,870
I just wished away my friends

867
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,510
my Sweet 16 party my senior prom...

868
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,040
I missed graduation!

869
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,810
I need to take that wish back!

870
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:08,810
Oh sweetie.

871
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:10,950
I'm afraid that's not possible.

872
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,520
The candles and your wishes go together.

873
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:16,150
Since there's no do-over wish on your list...

874
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:19,690
I'm afraid when midnight comes this is your life.

875
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:22,990
But...

876
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,300
Decorator's Delight.

877
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,000
Uh-huh.

878
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,400
On my way.

879
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,690
Slipcover emergency.

880
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:32,720
Gotta run.

881
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:35,500
What? No no no!

882
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:37,740
Wait!

883
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,680
Celeste Celeste...

884
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,620
You trying to run out on the rent?

885
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,320
- No!  - Good.

886
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,040
First month is due in three days.

887
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:53,320
Pay up or move out.

888
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,860
Move out.

889
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,660
Move out.

890
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:12,500
Stupid wishes!

891
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,040
Why did I ever write you down!

892
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,050
I'll just change one.

893
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,170
Ha!

894
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:53,670
Gotcha!

895
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,420
I hate sushi and I always will!

896
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,830
Hey...

897
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,130
What about you Wish No. 14?

898
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:24,300
When I'm 16, my parents will understand me.

899
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,910
There you are sweetheart.

900
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,530
Mom don't you ever knock?

901
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,710
I need privacy.

902
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,740
What?

903
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,140
Privacy. I need privacy.

904
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,280
Hold on a minute.

905
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,210
Bob come here a minute.

906
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,710
Tell your dad.

907
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,550
I need privacy.

908
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:41,680
One more time.

909
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,180
I need privacy. I need privacy.

910
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,020
I don't understand a word she's saying. Do you?

911
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:47,120
No. Then again I never do.

912
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,190
This has to work.

913
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:13,370
Please understand.

914
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,090
- Abby!  - Hi Daddy.

915
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,290
Honey look who it is.

916
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,390
- Hello sweetheart.  - Hi Mom.

917
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,260
Shouldn't you be at your own place unpacking those boxes?

918
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:36,950
Yeah but I missed you guys.

919
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,530
Aw that's sweet.

920
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,290
But we're kind of busy right now.

921
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,670
Your turn dear.

922
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,990
What's the use?

923
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,110
22 cards in my hand and I still can't play!

924
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,260
Can't this wait?

925
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:52,310
Of course it can.

926
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,010
What's up?

927
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,080
Well um...

928
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:03,390
I have something important to discuss with you

929
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:11,060
and I thought if you really listen to me you might understand.

930
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,860
Bob.

931
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:17,170
What? I'm listening.

932
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,270
We're listening.

933
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,630
Even if it sounds crazy?

934
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,900
I listen to your father all the time.

935
00:56:22,910 --> 00:56:24,100
What's that supposed to mean?

936
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,440
Go on sweetheart.

937
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:33,450
When I woke up this morning I was 16 years old.

938
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:39,950
I thought this was going to be the best day of my life.

939
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:45,890
Then this Birthday Fairy appeared and gave me these.

940
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:53,000
Would you look at this hon.

941
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,700
Well that brings back memories doesn't it?

942
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,810
What? What memories?

943
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,510
Your father took me to the Lucky Duck Chinese Restaurant

944
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,480
on the night you were born.

945
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,310
I had the orange chicken.

946
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:05,340
We thought it was an omen.

947
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,350
We always felt so lucky

948
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,520
to have a daughter as wonderful as you are.

949
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:11,650
Really?

950
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,450
Really.

951
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:21,250
Then you'll understand when I say I need to come back

952
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,280
and live with you and go back to school..

953
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,640
I'm not ready to have my own apartment and my own job.

954
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,640
Please tell me you understand.

955
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:34,180
Abby look behind you.

956
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,690
Ever since you were a little girl

957
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:39,750
all you wanted was to be exactly what you are now.

958
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:44,490
Beautiful and independent.

959
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,790
I remember the day this photo was taken.

960
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,660
You wanted a grown-up birthday party.

961
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:53,870
All dressed up in my high heels and pearls.

962
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,400
You were never happier.

963
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,840
But being grown up is different

964
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:00,240
than dreaming about it isn't it?

965
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,940
Yes.

966
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,840
We understand you.

967
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,510
You do?

968
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:07,950
Of course.

969
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:09,550
You're scared your childhood is over and with it

970
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,780
- all the best times of your life. - Yes!

971
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,690
You probably want to just turn back the clock and start over.

972
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:15,650
Yes! Yes!

973
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,110
That's exactly what I want to do!

974
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,390
We know how that feels.

975
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:23,560
Then I'm still your little girl?

976
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,200
You'll always be our little girl Pumpkin...

977
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,240
Look! Wasps!

978
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,300
Time to go Pumpkin.

979
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,010
Drive safe.

980
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,680
And don't forget these.

981
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,150
But I thought you guys understood.

982
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,510
We do understand adulthood could be tough.

983
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,250
Sometimes it gets a little buggy.

984
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,290
Bye now sweetheart!

985
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,930
Love you!

986
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,470
So that's what that feels like.

987
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,060
Hi Logan.

988
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,200
Hey.

989
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:34,470
Cool ride.

990
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:37,170
Yeah you said that this morning.

991
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:38,800
Huh?

992
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:43,010
So... what are you doing here?

993
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,740
Party.

994
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,580
Right.

995
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:51,350
I wasn't invited.

996
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,550
Huh.

997
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,820
- Hey!  - Yeah?

998
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:01,890
- Will you do something for me?  - Sure.

999
01:00:01,930 --> 01:00:04,730
Take a picture of me with your car.

1000
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,170
Okay okay.

1001
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,470
Thanks.

1002
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,690
It's what I want when I'm your age.

1003
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,670
There ya go.

1004
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,110
Cool.

1005
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,550
Oh man that's hot.

1006
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,680
I can't wait to show Krista!

1007
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,070
Joey Lockhart!

1008
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:45,970
Get off of me!

1009
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:47,440
Get off!

1010
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,910
You have to believe me Jay.

1011
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,390
You're my best friend and it's my 16th birthday

1012
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:52,400
and I got these magic candles at the bus stop

1013
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:55,010
and this big car pulled up and Joey Lockhart got out

1014
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:59,140
- and kissed me...  - I don't know her. Okay.

1015
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:01,720
You were there! You saw him!

1016
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:03,290
Let go.

1017
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,620
Not until you listen to me. Give me five minutes.

1018
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:12,130
Four.

1019
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:18,300
Okay.

1020
01:01:18,340 --> 01:01:20,640
I know this is hard to believe

1021
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:24,610
but we're best friends and I can prove it.

1022
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,580
So?

1023
01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:30,810
Look at your key ring.

1024
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:54,670
"Happy Sweet 16. Love Jay."

1025
01:01:56,740 --> 01:01:58,580
You gave this to me this morning.

1026
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:00,810
For my 16th birthday.

1027
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:14,650
Abby.

1028
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,660
You remember?

1029
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,590
I think so.

1030
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:21,560
So you believe me?

1031
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:23,730
Yeah.

1032
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,130
I do.

1033
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:37,140
He believes me!

1034
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,370
Whoa.

1035
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:39,780
Volume.

1036
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:47,080
But this doesn't change anything.

1037
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:51,990
And when midnight comes I'm stuck like this forever.

1038
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,590
Here lemme see the list.

1039
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:02,360
Here ya go.

1040
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:13,870
- Okay you've used 1 2 7 8 9...  - Skip ahead.

1041
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:15,840
I can't believe you wasted a wish on sushi.

1042
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,440
I was 8.

1043
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,910
I had a very unsophisticated palate.

1044
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,510
Had?

1045
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,720
You're a great best friend Jay.

1046
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,220
I know.

1047
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,460
C'mon.

1048
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:38,660
Most of these are kind of useless

1049
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,360
since you're already an adult.

1050
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:46,380
That leaves 15 and Logan Buchanan...

1051
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:48,800
Yeah about that...

1052
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,770
15 was always my favorite.

1053
01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:56,410
"When I'm 16 I'll have the best party ever."

1054
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:04,420
But you're not 16 anymore.

1055
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:18,260
Hey.

1056
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:22,000
I kinda have to make an appearance at Krista's party.

1057
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:25,570
Do you maybe want to come with me?

1058
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,660
Not as my date or anything.

1059
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:30,980
No.

1060
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:33,780
Of course not.

1061
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,420
Well?

1062
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,790
I'd love to go with you Jay.

1063
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,760
Okay.

1064
01:05:01,005 --> 01:05:03,417
Great party.

1065
01:05:03,417 --> 01:05:04,455
Ladies first.

1066
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:19,450
Mike?

1067
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,550
Give a shout-out to my big sis Abby everybody.

1068
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,750
You're super old Abs but you're still cool!

1069
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,690
So Mike can really play?

1070
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,360
Yeah.

1071
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,550
Something just clicked with him this year.

1072
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:34,490
He got serious about playing guitar.

1073
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,690
He's getting paid really well for this gig.

1074
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:43,350
Wait. Did I miss something?

1075
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,970
I mean besides senior year?

1076
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,570
Jay you're here!

1077
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:51,210
Hi! I'm so glad you could make it!

1078
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,770
Yeah.

1079
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:55,710
I'm... Abby Jensen.

1080
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,010
I know silly.

1081
01:05:57,050 --> 01:05:59,010
We're neighbors?

1082
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,920
Yes. Neighbors.

1083
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,450
Your party looks awesome.

1084
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,450
Thanks to your parents.

1085
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:07,590
They found all these amazing decorations in their garage

1086
01:06:07,590 --> 01:06:09,760
after their house was infested by wasps.

1087
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:12,820
I guess they were left over from your Sweet 16 Party

1088
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,760
but never got used for some reason.

1089
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,870
So they just gave them to me!

1090
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,070
- Lucky you.  - I know right?

1091
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,370
And you're just in time for the big celebration.

1092
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,080
Thanks for coming everybody!

1093
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,690
Man this is a dream come true for me.

1094
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,520
What's happening?

1095
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:37,690
Jay Kepler ladies and gentlemen.

1096
01:06:37,690 --> 01:06:40,890
Our new Student Body President!

1097
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,460
Thank you.

1098
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:49,230
I want to recognize my campaign manager Krista Cook.

1099
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,610
What all of you don't know is that I really wanted this

1100
01:06:54,610 --> 01:06:57,540
but I was too afraid to try.

1101
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,480
I couldn't have done it without your help Krista.

1102
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:03,810
Thank you so much!

1103
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,450
1 2 3 4...

1104
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:07,720
- Have fun okay?  - Mm-hmm.

1105
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,560
So you're Student Body President?

1106
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:17,890
Yep.

1107
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:20,800
I was Student Body President.

1108
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,160
Oh yeah.

1109
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,500
Weird.

1110
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:26,250
I thought with me out of the way Krista would win for sure.

1111
01:07:26,290 --> 01:07:27,850
Krista?

1112
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:30,250
She's hates competition.

1113
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:31,350
Krista?

1114
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,630
Our Krista.

1115
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:33,730
Yeah.

1116
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,500
I think without you in her life

1117
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:38,600
she just didn't have a reason to compete for anything.

1118
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,900
She's kind super helpful

1119
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:42,730
a good listener and a great friend.

1120
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,940
You guys would like each other.

1121
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,810
If y'know you were the same age right?

1122
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,100
Look around it's dead of night

1123
01:08:12,130 --> 01:08:15,370
You've been losing every fight

1124
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:20,240
Your hope is feeling broken

1125
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:21,780
Your feet are rough

1126
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,750
They're scraped and bruised

1127
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:27,780
But still have strength to take you through

1128
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:32,590
Into the dawn

1129
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,860
Just close your eyes

1130
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:36,260
This was supposed to be my party.

1131
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:37,930
...and push right through

1132
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:40,800
I know it's tough right now

1133
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:44,130
This was meant for you

1134
01:08:44,170 --> 01:08:46,870
When the clouds are gone

1135
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:50,040
Not a shadow in sight

1136
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:56,050
You'll be drenched in the sun with open eyes

1137
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:58,520
Oh oh oh...

1138
01:09:01,990 --> 01:09:04,800
Oh oh oh...

1139
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,200
Now at the beach the waves still crash

1140
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:13,870
The tide can grab and pull you back

1141
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:18,940
And the sun may be covered in gray

1142
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,810
The sand will itch the salt can burn

1143
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:26,150
The hurricane will take its turn

1144
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:30,750
Until the dawn

1145
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:36,260
Just close your eyes and push right through

1146
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:39,430
I know it's tough right now

1147
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:42,440
This was meant for you

1148
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:45,370
When the clouds are gone

1149
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,510
Not a storm in sight

1150
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:54,650
You'll be drenched in the sun with open eyes

1151
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,610
So close your eyes shut them tight

1152
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,950
Let it be and it will fade away

1153
01:10:25,980 --> 01:10:28,120
Fade away

1154
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,490
Push on through there's strength in you

1155
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,120
Let it be and wish it all away

1156
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:39,530
All away

1157
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,400
So close your eyes shut them tight

1158
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:48,340
Let it be and it will fade away

1159
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:56,240
Push on through there's strength in you

1160
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,650
Let it be and wish it all away

1161
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:08,520
With open eyes opened wide it's all good

1162
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,890
Now watch it fade away

1163
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:16,130
Day by day

1164
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:21,570
Just close your eyes and push right through

1165
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,000
I know it's tough right now

1166
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:27,940
But this was meant for you

1167
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:33,710
When the clouds are gone not a storm in sight

1168
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:39,650
You'll be drenched in the sun with open eyes

1169
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,560
Large pepperoni pineapple for Jensen.

1170
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,170
I didn't order a pizza.

1171
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,470
I know.

1172
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,240
I just thought you could use a friend.

1173
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,710
Oh sweetie.

1174
01:12:13,010 --> 01:12:14,710
Dry those tears.

1175
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:17,810
I'm starving.

1176
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,250
You are?

1177
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,720
Sure us magical beings have to eat too.

1178
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,020
This day didn't go like I thought it would.

1179
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,720
I can't believe I wasted my wishes on things

1180
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,090
like beating Krista Cook.

1181
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,620
Yeah.

1182
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,890
She's pretty nice now that she is not out to destroy you.

1183
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:35,130
Don't rub it in.

1184
01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:37,260
She's a really good friend to Jay.

1185
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,930
Better than I was.

1186
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:41,530
I didn't even know he wanted to be Student Body President.

1187
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,870
How could I have been so thoughtless?

1188
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:46,770
All I could think about

1189
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,610
was having parties and clothes and popularity.

1190
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,870
I can't believe those things were so important to me.

1191
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,540
You were 16.

1192
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:58,480
But I didn't appreciate it.

1193
01:12:58,510 --> 01:13:01,180
Ever since I was little I wanted to grow up.

1194
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,650
I thought it was the only way to get what I wanted.

1195
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:09,050
I guess I didn't realize what I already had.

1196
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,500
You still have this little number.

1197
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,280
Wish 16.

1198
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:34,580
All those years I saved it for something really special.

1199
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:39,550
Of all the wishes on this list

1200
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,950
this is the one I wish I could change.

1201
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:59,390
Wow that gum is still really fresh.

1202
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,300
Maybe the rules don't know about gum.

1203
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:17,750
There's only one way to find out.

1204
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:48,510
I wish I could start this whole day over again.

1205
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,950
Surprise!

1206
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:01,060
Happy Birthday Abby.

1207
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:02,120
Look.

1208
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,160
Your first 16th birthday picture.

1209
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:11,270
This is a great picture!

1210
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,000
This is the best picture I've ever seen in my entire life!

1211
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,700
Thank you thank you thank you!

1212
01:15:15,740 --> 01:15:17,610
You're welcome Pumpkin.

1213
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,310
Make a wish sweetheart?

1214
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:24,480
I wish for exactly this.

1215
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:27,410
Everything is perfect.

1216
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:33,150
Wasps!

1217
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:35,220
Yeah.

1218
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,520
I saw one crawl up the AC vent.

1219
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:40,930
No not one. Thousands!

1220
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,590
Nesting up there for 16 years!

1221
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:45,430
Sweetheart we know.

1222
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:47,130
No you don't know. You can't possibly know

1223
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,490
that the house is going to be totally infested

1224
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,300
and the wasps will take over the cars

1225
01:15:50,330 --> 01:15:52,470
and you and Dad'll have to live in the driveway

1226
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,340
but then Joey Lockhart will come and kiss me

1227
01:15:54,370 --> 01:15:55,770
and I will get candles and wishes

1228
01:15:55,810 --> 01:15:57,740
and some really gorgeous clothes

1229
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:00,480
and everything will look like it will be okay.

1230
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:01,850
But then I will make a really stupid wish

1231
01:16:01,880 --> 01:16:03,320
that I didn't mean to make

1232
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,660
and I will have to grow up and live alone and miss my party

1233
01:16:05,690 --> 01:16:07,220
and this will turn into the worst 16th birthday

1234
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:08,860
in the history of 16th birthdays!

1235
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,600
You have to call the exterminator now!

1236
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,570
Okey dokey.

1237
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,940
All done.

1238
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:20,870
Whoo that was some wasps' nest.

1239
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,010
Celeste?

1240
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,070
Hi Abby.

1241
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:24,340
You know her.

1242
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,180
Yeah we just met this morning.

1243
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:28,380
When Abby called me.

1244
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,480
You're very lucky I showed up when I did.

1245
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:33,950
So the wasps are all gone.

1246
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:36,790
Like they never happened.

1247
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:39,020
Everything is going to be okay?

1248
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:41,390
Better than okay.

1249
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:43,430
Wait. What do I owe ya?

1250
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:45,630
Consider it a Sweet 16 gift.

1251
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:47,900
Happy Birthday Abby.

1252
01:16:47,930 --> 01:16:49,350
Thank you.

1253
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:51,100
For everything.

1254
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,290
Well, go on down and start making that special birthday breakfast

1255
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:01,460
you have planned for me Mom.

1256
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:02,890
I'll be right there.

1257
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,560
Hey!

1258
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,700
This is for you.

1259
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,600
I was saving it for my Sweet 16 party

1260
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:44,970
but I think you need it more.

1261
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:45,900
Whoa!

1262
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:48,210
For what?

1263
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,640
A real guitar.

1264
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:52,310
I think you're really talented.

1265
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,150
Thank you Abs.

1266
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:00,850
I love you Mike.

1267
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,460
Thanks for the yummy breakfast Mom and Dad.

1268
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:08,790
Love you!

1269
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,800
Love you too.

1270
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:16,400
Krista! Krista! Wait!

1271
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,340
Get back.

1272
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,800
We need to talk.

1273
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,510
I have nothing to say to you.

1274
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:23,740
I have one quick question.

1275
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:26,150
No you cannot have a ride.

1276
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,050
I don't want a ride.

1277
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,820
I want to understand.

1278
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,820
What did I ever do to you?

1279
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:34,590
Go away.

1280
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:35,890
No.

1281
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,860
Not until you answer me.

1282
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:40,530
Why don't you like me?

1283
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:45,530
You really don't know do you?

1284
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,530
Not a clue.

1285
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,640
It was in third grade.

1286
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,380
Jay and I were best friends.

1287
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,800
Then you moved to town.

1288
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,880
It was my birthday.

1289
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,690
Jay and I made a pact...

1290
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:15,860
Cheese!

1291
01:19:15,890 --> 01:19:17,090
Best friends forever!

1292
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,960
Yeah!

1293
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:28,640
I stole your best friend.

1294
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:33,010
On my birthday.

1295
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:36,410
After that Jay and I did everything together.

1296
01:19:36,450 --> 01:19:38,280
Without me.

1297
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:40,710
That must have been so horrible for you.

1298
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:42,780
It was.

1299
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:45,050
I can't imagine how you felt.

1300
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:47,220
How I felt?

1301
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:51,130
I felt like a loser.

1302
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:56,860
Krista if I could turn back the clock and change that day

1303
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,570
I would.

1304
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:03,570
I am so sorry.

1305
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,610
You are?

1306
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:11,610
Any chance you can forgive me?

1307
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:14,780
I don't know.

1308
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:17,250
I made my own vow that day.

1309
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,790
- Which was... - I vowed to win at everything

1310
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:25,990
so you'd never get anything you wanted ever again.

1311
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:28,900
Wow.

1312
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:31,000
You did a great job.

1313
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:33,500
Thank you.

1314
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:40,810
Hey imagine if you used your powers for good instead of evil.

1315
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,040
Like what?

1316
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,380
Do you really want to be Student Body President?

1317
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:49,460
Honestly? No.

1318
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,800
It's exhausting having to win all the time.

1319
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,210
Well, if you want to drop out

1320
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,710
I know somebody who would love to take your place.

1321
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,110
Hey Krista.

1322
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:09,280
Hey... Abby?

1323
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,450
Boys.

1324
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:12,690
Cool ride!

1325
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,390
Thanks!

1326
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:17,360
Weird.

1327
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:23,370
You're a terrible best friend.

1328
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,000
- No I'm not. - Yes you are.

1329
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:27,470
I had to take the bus by myself. Where were you?

1330
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,910
I got a ride.

1331
01:21:31,940 --> 01:21:33,880
You two? In one vehicle?

1332
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:35,480
And it didn't like explode?

1333
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:36,680
Nope.

1334
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:38,780
We have a surprise for you.

1335
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:39,950
Why? It's not my birthday.

1336
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:42,350
- No it's mine... - And mine...

1337
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:46,360
And all we want is for your dream to come true.

1338
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:47,820
What dream?

1339
01:21:49,890 --> 01:21:51,840
You're now the only person running

1340
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,040

Let's hear it for the hosts of this little party

1349
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:19,820
Abby and Krista!

1350
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:26,990
Happy Sweet 16 to the both of you

1351
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,650
- Look who's here. - Huh?

1352
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,750
Look!

1353
01:22:46,780 --> 01:22:51,490
Logan Buchanan he's so gorgeous!

1354
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,550
You really like him don't you?

1355
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,790
Yeah.

1356
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:57,060
I thought you liked him to make me suffer.

1357
01:22:57,090 --> 01:22:59,320
Making you suffer was a bonus but

1358
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,930
I would have liked him anyway.

1359
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:06,530
Well I happen to know he really likes you too.

1360
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,400
- Really? - Really.

1361
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,210
Go talk to him.

1362
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,710
About what?

1363
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,650
Ask him about the red sports car he wants to drive someday.

1364
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,820
Okay.

1365
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:30,430
Hi Logan.

1366
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:32,660
Thanks a lot for coming.

1367
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,100
Thanks. You look great.

1368
01:23:34,130 --> 01:23:35,530
Thank you.

1369
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:58,750
Happy Birthday Abby.

1370
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:01,090
Yes it is.

1371
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,530
It is now officially the best 16th birthday

1372
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,060
in the history of 16th birthdays.

1373
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,270
Good.

1374
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,680
Check it out.

1375
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:20,810
Happy Birthday Abby!

1376
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:28,280
Just take a chance don't think it's your choice

1377
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:32,900
Wake up don't you hear my voice

1378
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:40,160
I'd swim through broken glass just to define

1379
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:45,230
You left me there freaked out and swept aside

1380
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:49,140
I think it's all been said before

1381
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:51,740
So many times before

1382
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:12,790
So... are you going to start a new wish list.

1383
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:16,860
No.

1384
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,830
No more wish lists.

1385
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,320
Really? Why not?

1386
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:26,620
Because I have everything I could ever want right here.

1387
01:25:37,060 --> 01:25:39,830
I don't want to grow up

1388
01:25:39,860 --> 01:25:42,700
Don't want to figure this out

1389
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:45,700
I know you set me up

1390
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,440
Don't want this dragging you down

1391
01:25:48,470 --> 01:25:51,070
I don't want to grow up

1392
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:53,740
Don't want to figure this out

1393
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,750
I know you set me up

1394
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:00,180
Don't want this dragging you down

1395
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:13,850
If you ever been  afraid of anything

1396
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:15,050
This song's for you

1397
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:16,980
I know you're feeling me

1398
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:20,450
If you ever wanted to something big

1399
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:23,860
But then you stopped just couldn't handle it

1400
01:26:23,890 --> 01:26:27,060
If you take a chance then it'll be all right

1401
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:29,290
Come on come on come on

1402
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,530
You know it's time

1403
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:31,960
Just pu-pu-push it down

1404
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,660
And then you'll win the fight

1405
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,330
You're better than this you're better than that

1406
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:37,100
Come on let's make it right

1407
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:40,640
Nothing's getting in my way now

1408
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:44,210
Nothing ever will again

1409
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,310
If you're with me come on say now

1410
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:49,110
We're gonna make it

1411
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:51,180
We're gonna take what we can

1412
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:55,520
You're gonna sit up and let them know

1413
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:58,460
Just find the courage get up and go

1414
01:26:58,490 --> 01:27:02,290
Oh no we're not gonna take it slow

1415
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,900
If you know what I'm sayin'

1416
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:06,230
There's no time for waitin'

1417
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:08,300
A wish comes true every day

1418
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:11,900
I wish I could...

1419
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:17,940
That's okay keep going.

1420
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:24,450
When I'm 16 I will have my own car preferably red.

1421
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,020
You don't get that wish.

1422
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,320
I didn't know what it was.

1423
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,190

1424

1428
01:27:56,550 --> 01:27:58,250

1429
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:03,650

1430
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,390

1431
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:09,620
Who's the cutest?

1432
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:10,790

1433
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:18,470
Okay I got it.

1434
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:20,700
What?

1435
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,010
Since I'm not paying for my own party

1436
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:22,970
I don't have to spend...

1437
01:28:23,010 --> 01:28:24,040
What?

1438
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:25,410
When I'm 15... What?

1439
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,540
Nope.

1440
01:28:27,780 --> 01:28:29,550
Work it! Work it!

1441
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:38,920
Hey Mark!

1442
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,290
Is he a good dancer?

1443
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:43,880
That was a "not". That was a "not".
