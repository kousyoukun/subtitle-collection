1
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:29,197
This is the worst storm yet.

2
00:01:29,514 --> 00:01:31,068
Yeah, almost
every night

3
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:32,344
for the last three months.

4
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:34,088
Well, it sure ain't natural.

5
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,879
I'm getting away from this
lightning while I still can.

6
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,624
Ah, you'll be soaked to the bone
before you get ten yards.

7
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,045
Well I'd better
be soaked than barbecued.

8
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,914
What if we ran for it?

9
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:08,247
It's impossible
to make it to the main road.

10
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:10,915
Maybe we can make it
to the old willows place?

11
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:12,424
Are you out of your mind?

12
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,871
Do you actually
believe in them monsters?

13
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:17,064
But the newspaper
story said...

14
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,281
Oh, act your age, Mac.

15
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:26,868
Here's the house.

16
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:29,332
Don't look good to me.

17
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,833
Ah, you're just spooked.

18
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:34,105
Well, spooked or not, that
place just don't look healthy.

19
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:37,156
It hasn't been lived in
in 15 years, it's deserted.

20
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,657
It is, huh?

21
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,636
Thought you said
this place was deserted?

22
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:50,595
Well, it's supposed
to be. I don't get it.

23
00:02:57,147 --> 00:02:59,646


24
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,899
what do you want?

25
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,147
Let's get out of here.

26
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:05,147
Uh, we didn't
think anybody lived here.

27
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:06,704
It was all his idea.

28
00:03:06,947 --> 00:03:08,952
We thought maybe
we could get out of the rain.

29
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:10,823
It looks like
it's going to last all night.

30
00:03:10,947 --> 00:03:12,228
It's pretty bad out there.

31
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:13,662
Oh no, you can't stay.

32
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:14,662
Oh, be reasonable.

33
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:16,661
You can't stay.

34
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:18,172
We might catch pneumonia.

35
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:20,283
You're not welcome in my house.

36
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,784
Go away, now, go, go, go.

37
00:03:23,795 --> 00:03:24,965
Lobo!

38
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:28,805
Lobo! No, no!

39
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,053
The monster!

40
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,376
Now you believe
those newspaper stories?

41
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,376
Do you hear that, lobo?
You're the monster.

42
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:38,385
Perhaps, one day
you will meet the monster.

43
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,386
Heh, heh, heh.

44
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,614
Wait, wait!
I can't run anymore.

45
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:40,612
We gotta keep going.

46
00:05:41,277 --> 00:05:43,032
That was the monster.

47
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:46,088
Well, I wouldn't give to see a
couple of cops right about now.

48
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,096
Come on.

49
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,097


50
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:27,577


51
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:29,577


52
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:17,580
you, get these straps off of me.

53
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:23,335
Let me loose, do you hear me?

54
00:07:24,256 --> 00:07:25,457
Lobo hears,

55
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:27,688
but he cannot speak.

56
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,492
Lobo is mute.

57
00:07:31,756 --> 00:07:34,862
Because of
the storm, I was afraid

58
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,532
we were not going
to have guests tonight.

59
00:07:40,522 --> 00:07:44,132
Lobo, you're too
rough with my patient.

60
00:07:51,032 --> 00:07:54,307
Already, he tires
of our humble hospitality.

61
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:56,079
I said, let me out of here.

62
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,799
At the moment,
i am afraid it is impossible.

63
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:00,614
Who are you?

64
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,614
Vornoff, Dr. Eric vornoff.

65
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,063
The name will
mean little to you.

66
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,363
what are you doing to me?

67
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:55,890
You will be soon
as big as a giant.

68
00:08:58,813 --> 00:09:01,570
Strength of 20 men.

69
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,217
Or, like all the others,

70
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:07,963
dead.

71
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,377
Turn off the switch.

72
00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,631
Isn't it strange, lobo?

73
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:23,647
Our friend always returns home
after his long, tiresome swim.

74
00:10:58,815 --> 00:10:59,905
What's your name?

75
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:01,553
You find out.

76
00:11:01,553 --> 00:11:04,352
We will.
Hey, watch that cigarette.

77
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:07,772
What were
you doing in the swamp?

78
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:08,514
What's it to you?

79
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,872
That's enough of that, buster.

80
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,752
No tank town jail
can hold me.

81
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,622
I'll be out of this
here rat trap in 24 hours.

82
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,262
That's what you think.

83
00:11:18,849 --> 00:11:21,045
Vagrancy will
hold you for 72 hours.

84
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:22,528
Take him downstairs
and book him.

85
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:23,686
All right, let's go.

86
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,511
Let go of me, I said.

87
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:28,211
You can't do that to me.
Let go.

88
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:41,098
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

89
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,647
What do you mean,
where do I think I'm going?

90
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,443
I've got captain
Robbins' newspapers.

91
00:11:44,647 --> 00:11:45,763
You have, have you?

92
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,851
And since when you don't leave
the captain's papers with me?

93
00:11:47,851 --> 00:11:49,922
Since the captain told
me to bring 'em in myself.

94
00:11:49,923 --> 00:11:51,640
When you read 'em first,
you mess 'em up.

95
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,241
Hold your tongue
and give me those papers

96
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:55,383
or I'll have you locked up
for peddling without a license.

97
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:57,383
I got a license.

98
00:11:57,657 --> 00:12:00,157
Want to bet I can
make it expire all of a sudden?

99
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:21,455
Come in.

100
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:26,922
Here's the late
editions, captain.

101
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,922
Look, why can't
i work on this case?

102
00:12:28,923 --> 00:12:30,283
Get back to your desk.

103
00:12:31,246 --> 00:12:32,246
Yes, sir.

104
00:12:32,695 --> 00:12:34,465
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?

105
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:36,914
I told the boy to bring
the papers in himself.

106
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:38,637
Yes, sir.
But if you ask me...

107
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:39,888
I didn't.

108
00:12:40,422 --> 00:12:41,422
Yes, sir.

109
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,407
- And kelton.
Yes, sir?

110
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:44,899
Where's lieutenant Craig?

111
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,332
In his office, I think.

112
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,153
Send him in.

113
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:48,857
Yes, sir, right away, sir.

114
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,353


115
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:32,383
come in.

116
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,875
Hi, captain.

117
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,635
Hello, dick, sit down.

118
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,320
Seen today's papers?

119
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:40,216
Is there anyone who hasn't?

120
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:43,448
Well, there's the one
nice thing about birds.

121
00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:45,444
They never cause
anybody any trouble.

122
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:48,219
Your girlfriend
writes a good story.

123
00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:50,331
She thinks so.
Anything new.

124
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:51,331
No.

125
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:55,081
12 disappearances around this place
and nothing to go on.

126
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:57,036
And nothing this time either.

127
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,110
Been around that swamp so many
times, I'm getting web-footed.

128
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,600
It's been fired recently.

129
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,115
It's been fired
several times recently.

130
00:14:07,496 --> 00:14:09,904
jake long's wife identified
it a little while ago.

131
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:13,354
The coat belonged to
Ralph mcrae, his partner.

132
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:17,085
They went hunting by
marsh lake and never returned.

133
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,307
Not much left of it.

134
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:20,044
Boys found
it floating in the lake.

135
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:21,249
What about the rifle?

136
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:23,664
About a mile from
the old willows place.

137
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:24,665
All ties together.

138
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,170
But it doesn't prove anything.

139
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,972
You think there's anything
in these monster stories?

140
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:30,408
Your girlfriend does.

141
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,473
What about you?

142
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:33,482
The police
don't believe in monsters.

143
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:34,830
Facts are our business.

144
00:14:34,831 --> 00:14:37,041
Facts and only facts,
and don't you forget it.

145
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,971
I'm telling you,
the captain isn't seeing nobody.

146
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,053
Now please be a good girl,
miss lawton, and go.

147
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:45,176
Captain Robbins, will you tell
this junior g-man to let me go?

148
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,675
Kelton.
Yes, sir.

149
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:47,859
Let her go.

150
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,690
Just as you say, captain.

151
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:53,685
It used to
be a newspaper reporter

152
00:14:53,686 --> 00:14:55,646
could get information
around this place.

153
00:14:56,468 --> 00:14:57,967
What in the world do you mean?

154
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,679
Now, he makes like a comic.

155
00:14:59,968 --> 00:15:01,968
Dick Craig, I don't put
much stock

156
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,477
in the future success
of our married life

157
00:15:03,478 --> 00:15:05,983
if already you're
holding out secrets on me.

158
00:15:05,984 --> 00:15:07,978
You've been dodging me
all day.

159
00:15:08,427 --> 00:15:09,743
Where'd you
get an idea like that?

160
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,711
You mean you
haven't been dodging me?

161
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:14,211
No.
And all those times I called.

162
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:16,830
And kelton said the line
was busy, it really was?

163
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:17,855
Yes.

164
00:15:18,368 --> 00:15:21,432
Ok, let's have the story
on lake marsh and the monster.

165
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:24,790
Uh... monster, monster... aaah.

166
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,134
I thought so.

167
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:27,979
There is no
such thing as monsters,

168
00:15:27,979 --> 00:15:29,768
this is the 20th century.

169
00:15:29,768 --> 00:15:30,987
Don't count on it.

170
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:32,603
Monsters, I mean.

171
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:33,635
Now, Janet.

172
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:35,612
Don't you "now, Janet" me.

173
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,113
And you can count
our engagement off.

174
00:15:37,114 --> 00:15:38,902
- You don't mean that.
Yes, I do.

175
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:39,902
No, she doesn't.

176
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:41,923
I most certainly do.

177
00:15:41,924 --> 00:15:43,585
Well, then, give him back
the ring.

178
00:15:43,585 --> 00:15:44,277
What?

179
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:46,612
If you're throwing over the
marriage, give him back the ring.

180
00:15:46,664 --> 00:15:47,519
Now, chief, I...

181
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,055
Captain.
Give him back the rock.

182
00:15:50,056 --> 00:15:51,466
It's the only fair thing.

183
00:15:52,066 --> 00:15:55,099
I'd rather throw it
in lake marsh first.

184
00:15:55,711 --> 00:15:57,711
Besides, we've got
to leave our personal lives

185
00:15:57,712 --> 00:15:58,633
out of our business lives.

186
00:15:58,658 --> 00:15:59,712
As it should be.

187
00:15:59,712 --> 00:16:01,211
As I've been saying
all along.

188
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:04,494
Dog! Now, what about
the monster story?

189
00:16:04,495 --> 00:16:05,505
Well, that's your own story.

190
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,301
You wrote it
and you're stuck with it.

191
00:16:07,495 --> 00:16:09,721
There's no
such thing as monsters.

192
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:12,422
But two more men
have vanished up at lake marsh.

193
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:14,570
That makes
12 in three months.

194
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,080
Everything points
to an inhuman violence.

195
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:20,296
Or do you still stick to
the alligator devouring routine?

196
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:21,382
Oh!

197
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,383
You're withholding
news from the public.

198
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,795
Janet, you may not
believe this,

199
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:28,022
but you got
all the story there is.

200
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,065
You're right,
i don't believe it.

201
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:31,863
Well, nevertheless,
it's the truth.

202
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:36,362
Except for the monster, figment
of your very vivid imagination.

203
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,362
While we've got
nothing more to go on

204
00:16:38,363 --> 00:16:39,862
than what you reported
to the paper.

205
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:43,637
The figment of my imagination
is something I believe

206
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,860
and you haven't
been able to disprove it.

207
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,335
We've conducted
every possible search.

208
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,735
Monsters, it's fantastic.
You know that.

209
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:55,071
Our business
is dealing in facts, evidence.

210
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,426
Can't you see that?

211
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:59,451
Men disappearing. Huh.

212
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,407
There's plenty
of quicksand out there.

213
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:03,907
Yeah,
12 went down in the same place.

214
00:17:03,908 --> 00:17:06,157
Well, we're doing
our best to solve it.

215
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:07,938
Maybe your
best isn't good enough.

216
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,437
- Janet!
No, I mean it.

217
00:17:09,438 --> 00:17:10,758
No clues.

218
00:17:10,783 --> 00:17:13,187
What's this, a dancing costume?

219
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:15,570
And this, a pogo stick?

220
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,577
Well, I've got to admit
those we're found at the lake.

221
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,892
But remember,
they were in your own story.

222
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:23,311
No human did this.

223
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:24,849
So you say.

224
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:29,874
Well, looks like I've run
into a dead end around here.

225
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:34,307
Ok, if you boys wanna
play a game of secrets.,

226
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:35,898
there's nothing
left for me to do

227
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,210
but take a run out
to lake marsh myself.

228
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,136
Over my dead body.

229
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,626
That could be arranged.

230
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:46,105
Goodbye.

231
00:17:53,753 --> 00:17:56,061
She's just crazy
enough to do what she says.

232
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:58,071
- You know what, captain?
What?

233
00:17:58,072 --> 00:17:59,791
I think you're right.

234
00:18:33,825 --> 00:18:34,825
Hi, tillie.

235
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:37,189
Hi, Janet.
Long time no see.

236
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:39,708
Tillie, do you remember
a couple of years ago

237
00:18:39,709 --> 00:18:40,824
in the real estate section

238
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,824
when the old willows
place out on lake marsh

239
00:18:42,849 --> 00:18:45,349
was up for sale,
against back taxes?

240
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,358
Seems to me that was around
November or December of '48.

241
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,979
- Wanna see the files?
Yes.

242
00:18:52,004 --> 00:18:53,469
Just a minute.

243
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:57,533
Here they are.

244
00:18:58,588 --> 00:19:01,129
October to December, '48.

245
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,424
In the top file there.

246
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,629
I won't be long.

247
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,630
Take your time I ain't going
anyplace, and neither are they.

248
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:26,610
Find what you wanted, Janet?

249
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,481
Yes, thanks. Sorry to leave
such a mess for you.

250
00:19:28,481 --> 00:19:30,481
Well, that's
what I get paid for.

251
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,697
Be a dear, tillie.
Call the boss.

252
00:19:32,698 --> 00:19:34,052
Tell him I'll be gone
the rest of the day,

253
00:19:34,053 --> 00:19:36,052
- I'll report in later.
Sure thing.

254
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,496
On something hot?

255
00:19:37,497 --> 00:19:39,007
Oh, it could be.

256
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:40,708
Oh, and dick.

257
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:43,708
Call him at headquarters,
break my dinner date with him.

258
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,209
Tell him I... I have
an ulcer or something.

259
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,718
Leave it to me. I fix.

260
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,219
Ok.

261
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:54,218
- Hi, Janet.
Oh, hi, Marge.

262
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:55,789
Janet. Still
on the monster hunt?

263
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,930
What do you think?

264
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,485
I think the boss has been
looking for you all day.

265
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:03,351
Something about the police
wanting those monster stories 86'd.

266
00:20:03,352 --> 00:20:05,272
You've got
the whole town in a panic.

267
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,492
I didn't hear you.

268
00:20:06,492 --> 00:20:08,609
- I said...
I know what you said.

269
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,227
But I didn't hear you.

270
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,923
I get it. See you later.

271
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,104
Lieutenant Craig has
been working on the case

272
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,174
a long time, professor.

273
00:20:39,387 --> 00:20:41,386
I'd like him to hear
what you just told me.

274
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:43,321
I should be happy
to cooperate.

275
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:44,612
Oh, hello, dick.

276
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,829
Professor Vladimir strowski,
lieutenant Craig.

277
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,918
Glad to meet you, professor.

278
00:20:49,943 --> 00:20:51,103
How do you do?

279
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,620
Professor, will you
bring him up to date?

280
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:58,711
Lieutenant Craig, have you
ever heard of loch ness?

281
00:20:59,235 --> 00:21:01,998
I think so. That's
a lake in Scotland, isn't it?

282
00:21:01,998 --> 00:21:05,164
Mm. Then perhaps
you are familiar

283
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:07,633
with the loch ness monster.

284
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,794
Vaguely.

285
00:21:09,794 --> 00:21:13,066
A few years ago, I was
called in by the British police

286
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:17,035
to investigate the appearance
of a monster at loch ness.

287
00:21:17,335 --> 00:21:19,391
Well, they thought
that it was some creature

288
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:21,586
left over from a bygone age.

289
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,376
I am considered
an authority on the subject

290
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,386
of prehistoric monsters.

291
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:33,374
However, I must admit
that my investigation failed

292
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,325
to get the desired results,

293
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,475
in that I did not
see the monster myself.

294
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:40,161
But others did.

295
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:41,933
There are sworn statements.

296
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,335
Professor, is it
your theory that perhaps

297
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,855
the loch ness monster crossed
the ocean and came to the swamp?

298
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:52,677
I consider that possibility
extremely remote.

299
00:21:53,457 --> 00:21:56,636
But the cases
do bear a certain similarity,

300
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:59,647
in that there are
so many varied descriptions

301
00:21:59,648 --> 00:22:02,182
of this so-called monster.

302
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:06,408
And I thought perhaps, with
my knowledge of such things,

303
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,648
and with your
permission, of course,

304
00:22:08,918 --> 00:22:12,694
that I might be able to shed
some light on this mystery.

305
00:22:13,526 --> 00:22:16,194
That is the reason
for my presence here.

306
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:18,320
What do you think, dick?

307
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,404
Well, there's no denying
we need help of some sort.

308
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,624
And you'll keep your findings
secret for the time being?

309
00:22:26,227 --> 00:22:27,387
As you will.

310
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,610
And you don't
mind a little company?

311
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:32,220
How do you mean, company?

312
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,511
Lieutenant Craig.

313
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,011
At times, the police
can be quite useful.

314
00:22:37,214 --> 00:22:40,562
I should be most happy to have
lieutenant Craig's assistance.

315
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:44,295
How soon can you be ready to leave
for lake marsh, lieutenant Craig?

316
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:45,596
I'm ready.

317
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:48,873
Well, I suggest
we wait until morning.

318
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,471
There was a storm
brewing when I came in.

319
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,542
And it is
so close to nightfall.

320
00:22:54,543 --> 00:22:55,543
According to reports,

321
00:22:55,544 --> 00:22:59,214
the monster
strikes only at night.

322
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,502
Undoubtedly true, but
the preliminary investigation

323
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:05,875
should take
place in daylight.

324
00:23:06,003 --> 00:23:10,053
The night,
the monster, all in good time.

325
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:12,588
Sounds logical.

326
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:13,753
Whatever you say.

327
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:17,753
Now, gentlemen, since I just
arrived in town this afternoon,

328
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:19,254
if you will excuse me,

329
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,143
i should like
to return to my hotel.

330
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:23,529
Certainly, sir.

331
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:24,764
Good day, captain.

332
00:23:24,765 --> 00:23:25,990
Professor.

333
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:33,773
Until morning, lieutenant Craig.

334
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:34,986
I'll be here.

335
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:44,621
Strange sort of bird.

336
00:23:46,511 --> 00:23:47,571
Where do I meet him?

337
00:23:48,198 --> 00:23:49,405
Here, ten o'clock.

338
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:51,488
That will give
him plenty of daylight.

339
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,187
Well, see you later.

340
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,678
Hmm, got a date?

341
00:23:55,594 --> 00:23:56,594
What do you think?

342
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:58,562
I'll say you don't.

343
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:00,765
I don't?

344
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:02,197
Girl from her office called in.

345
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:06,098
Said that Janet had a headache
or some such thing.

346
00:24:06,198 --> 00:24:08,051
If she's
gone to lake marsh alone.

347
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:09,817
I'll take her across my knee,

348
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:11,150
if it's the last thing I do.

349
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,472
Well, it probably would be.

350
00:24:13,776 --> 00:24:14,985
Watch him, dick.

351
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:16,018
Strowski?

352
00:24:16,043 --> 00:24:17,275
Just a hunch.

353
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:18,553
Right.

354
00:25:04,104 --> 00:25:05,604


355
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:25,658
you are all right now, my dear.

356
00:26:26,873 --> 00:26:28,343
What?

357
00:26:30,343 --> 00:26:31,337
Who... who are you?

358
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:34,749
I'm... I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.

359
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:37,346
You had a severe shock.

360
00:26:37,682 --> 00:26:38,760
Oh.

361
00:26:39,846 --> 00:26:41,213
How did I get here?

362
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,825
Oh.

363
00:26:44,216 --> 00:26:46,720
That's not
important for the moment.

364
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:50,653
What you need now is rest.

365
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,655
Rest.

366
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:58,945
You will sleep.

367
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,955
Sleep.

368
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:09,955
For the lovely young lady,

369
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,743
sleep.

370
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:42,985
Well, here we are
at the fork in the road.

371
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,994
Like they say
in all good westerns,

372
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,339
which way to go?

373
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:50,201
Well, that's
the road to the willows place.

374
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:51,995
Let's take a chance on that one.

375
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,877
Ok. You know,
i get to hate this swamp more

376
00:27:54,877 --> 00:27:56,613
every time I come out here.

377
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:59,616
You just weren't
born for swamp duty, Marty.

378
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,973
Yeah, I guess you're right.

379
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:02,973
I'd like to
transfer to a department

380
00:28:02,984 --> 00:28:04,489
as far away
from here as possible.

381
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,999
The wind and the rain.

382
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,484
Gives this place a gleam
that just isn't natural.

383
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,591
The ground
alive with crawling things,

384
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:16,449
crawling death.

385
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,129
You're right there, Marty.

386
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,755
This swamp
is a monument to death.

387
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:24,762
Snakes, alligators, quicksand,

388
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:27,479
all bent on one thing.

389
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:28,856
Destruction.

390
00:28:34,949 --> 00:28:37,449
Something strange
about all this rain.

391
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:39,580
The lightning's
been going crazy too.

392
00:28:39,959 --> 00:28:40,959
Maybe it's like the papers said.

393
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,458
All these atom bomb explosions
distorted the atmosphere.

394
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:45,459
Maybe.

395
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:47,968
You know, if I was
this professor strowski guy,

396
00:28:47,969 --> 00:28:50,264
i wouldn't come out in
this swamp without a guide.

397
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:53,262
You know, that's
the one thing I can't figure.

398
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:57,584
He comes to the office
with all these monster stories,

399
00:28:58,479 --> 00:29:00,474
makes an appointment
to come out here with us,

400
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:02,709
then he goes off by himself.

401
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,479
Are you sure he came out here?

402
00:29:06,489 --> 00:29:07,867
Where else could he go?

403
00:29:08,763 --> 00:29:11,602
Well, let's get at it.
Hm.

404
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:46,333
Janet's car?

405
00:29:46,333 --> 00:29:48,534
Yeah,
there's not a trace of her.

406
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:50,008
Well, maybe
after the accident

407
00:29:50,009 --> 00:29:51,612
she found her way down to the
road and then back into town.

408
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:53,111
I've gotta be sure.

409
00:29:53,112 --> 00:29:54,813
Look, there's a coffee joint
about ten miles back,

410
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:55,815
let's go and check.

411
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,292
- Let's go.
Ok.

412
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,084
Where did you find her car?

413
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:22,707
Not a sign of her?

414
00:31:24,171 --> 00:31:25,671
Where's strowski?

415
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:28,813
I told you not
to let him out of your sight.

416
00:31:28,814 --> 00:31:30,313
Right, captain.

417
00:31:30,814 --> 00:31:32,660
I don't like
the looks of things.

418
00:31:33,986 --> 00:31:35,853
Well, get back to strowski.

419
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:38,080
I'll get word to you later.

420
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:39,212
Yeah.

421
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,396
You look worried, dick.

422
00:31:43,923 --> 00:31:44,923
No one.

423
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:49,122
Captain Robbins,
her apartment, her office.

424
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:51,727
No one has heard from
her since yesterday afternoon.

425
00:31:52,434 --> 00:31:54,748
Captain Robbins
is checking further.

426
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,437
Ok, but what do we do?

427
00:31:56,437 --> 00:31:58,875
Orders, find strowski.

428
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:19,175
Ah, get me the city desk.

429
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:22,493
Hello, Jim.

430
00:32:22,602 --> 00:32:24,915
Yeah, about the lawton girl.

431
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,468
Uh, he just called me too.

432
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,266
Who saw her
last around your office?

433
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,623
Don't be afraid of lobo.

434
00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:52,059
He's as gentle as a kitten.

435
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,279
Put the tray down here.

436
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,199
 That is all.

437
00:33:01,367 --> 00:33:02,445
Get out.

438
00:33:09,416 --> 00:33:11,883
I said, get out!

439
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:37,119
that is all.

440
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,291
Now come, my dear.

441
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,970
Some cream or sugar?

442
00:33:46,879 --> 00:33:48,869
You didn't
have your breakfast yet.

443
00:33:49,174 --> 00:33:50,758
Now it's past noon.

444
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:52,664
You must be hungry.

445
00:33:53,621 --> 00:33:54,664
What happened to me?

446
00:33:55,106 --> 00:33:57,758
Your automobile, an accident.

447
00:33:58,346 --> 00:34:00,989
Lobo brought you here.
To me.

448
00:34:01,144 --> 00:34:03,560
What is this place?
And who are you?

449
00:34:04,644 --> 00:34:07,614
Don't you remember
i told you last night?

450
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:09,510
Did you tell me?

451
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,447
Yes, I'm Dr. Eric vornoff.

452
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,081
Oh. This is
the old willows place.

453
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,541
Yes.

454
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:23,833
How did you know?

455
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,833
I checked our real estate files.

456
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:28,146
A Dr. Eric vornoff
bought the willows place

457
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:30,722
in November of 1948.

458
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:35,311
You are a newspaper reporter,
huh?

459
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:36,312
Yes.

460
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:39,666
My name seems
to mean much to you.

461
00:34:40,671 --> 00:34:44,312
Well, actually it wasn't
your name I was interested in.

462
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,770
Through
the mysteries of lake marsh,

463
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,164
and the willows place
being right on the lake.

464
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,280
I looked in the files
to see what happened to it.

465
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:55,100
Your name was
there as the purchaser.

466
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,404
I thought perhaps
you might have heard

467
00:34:57,404 --> 00:34:58,836
something about the monster.

468
00:34:58,837 --> 00:35:02,151
Oh, my dear miss lawton. I...

469
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,162
When did I tell you my name?

470
00:35:05,477 --> 00:35:06,661
You didn't.

471
00:35:07,477 --> 00:35:09,817
But since you were unconscious,

472
00:35:10,987 --> 00:35:13,749
i took the Liberty
looking into your purse.

473
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,962
You must have
seen my press card.

474
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,737
Yes, I did.

475
00:35:18,268 --> 00:35:20,960
Well, since you knew the answers
already, why the third degree?

476
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:22,940
And who or what
was that monster?

477
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:25,439
Oh, he's quite human.

478
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,939
I discovered him in
the wilderness of Tibet.

479
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,673
He has been quite
useful to me... at times.

480
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:43,595
But now, since
your tiring experience,

481
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,946
i think we have talked too much.

482
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:48,398
I'm not the least bit tired.

483
00:35:50,726 --> 00:35:53,016
But you are tired.

484
00:35:59,236 --> 00:36:03,746
You are so tired.

485
00:36:05,924 --> 00:36:07,121
Strange.

486
00:36:08,484 --> 00:36:09,650
Suddenly, I...

487
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,946
I do feel very tired.

488
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:19,413
Yes.

489
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:25,132
Very tired.

490
00:36:28,122 --> 00:36:30,460
Very tired.

491
00:36:42,227 --> 00:36:46,375
Lobo! Take the girl
to my quarters.

492
00:38:50,817 --> 00:38:53,250
My dear professor strowski.

493
00:38:54,327 --> 00:38:59,727
Well, it has been
a very long time.

494
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:01,279
Vornoff.

495
00:39:01,591 --> 00:39:02,962
It is you.

496
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:05,295
You can see.

497
00:39:06,107 --> 00:39:08,117
In Paris,
i missed you by a month.

498
00:39:08,118 --> 00:39:09,606
In London, a week.

499
00:39:09,607 --> 00:39:11,696
At loch ness,
by only one day.

500
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:15,310
The monster of lake marsh
sounded again like you.

501
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,330
Why the sudden interest in me,
professor strowski?

502
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,830
Your experiments
in atomic energy, of course.

503
00:39:26,494 --> 00:39:32,061
Ah, so my dear country
now believes in my work.

504
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,657
And that it can be a success.

505
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,061
Our government wants
you to return, vornoff,

506
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,339
to continue your research
and experiments there,

507
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,742
where you can have
everything at your disposal.

508
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:46,300
Why do you laugh?

509
00:39:46,735 --> 00:39:49,007
Surely this is not
a laughing matter?

510
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,852
My dear professor strowski.

511
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:57,636
20 years ago,
i was banned from my homeland.

512
00:39:58,415 --> 00:40:01,017
Parted from my wife and son,

513
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:03,445
never to see them again.

514
00:40:04,012 --> 00:40:05,074
Why?

515
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:09,511
Because I suggested
to use the atom elements

516
00:40:09,512 --> 00:40:11,864
for producing super beings.

517
00:40:13,021 --> 00:40:16,817
Beings of unthinkable
strength and size.

518
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:21,922
I was classed as a madman,

519
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,072
a charlatan,

520
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,650
outlawed in the world of science

521
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,670
which previously
honored me as a genius.

522
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,465
Now, here in this
forsaken jungle hell,

523
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:40,680
i have proven
that I'm all right!

524
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:45,136
Now, professor strowski,

525
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:49,390
it is no laughing matter.

526
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:54,317
Yes. Yes, indeed
it was a tragic error.

527
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:58,306
But, as soon as I had learned
how correct your findings were,

528
00:40:58,401 --> 00:40:59,869
always have been,

529
00:40:59,894 --> 00:41:01,911
I informed those in authority.

530
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:05,901
Vornoff, I have
searched for you everywhere,

531
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,313
everywhere I hear
stories of monsters.

532
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:11,856
Now, I am here,

533
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:14,442
sent to bring you home.

534
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:17,713
Home?

535
00:41:31,348 --> 00:41:33,044
I have no home.

536
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,096
Hunted, despised,

537
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,042
living like an animal,

538
00:41:45,138 --> 00:41:48,074
the jungle is my home.

539
00:41:49,647 --> 00:41:52,456
But I will show the world

540
00:41:52,647 --> 00:41:54,782
that I can be its master.

541
00:41:56,657 --> 00:42:01,120
I will perfect
my own race of people.

542
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:08,122
A race of atomic supermen
which will conquer the world.

543
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:15,284
Yes. Yes, of course.

544
00:42:15,754 --> 00:42:18,780
A truly great master race,

545
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:22,598
such as I convinced my superiors
only you could create.

546
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:25,076
One with which our government

547
00:42:25,077 --> 00:42:28,077
can rule the world
without debate.

548
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:32,653
You misunderstand me, strowski.

549
00:42:34,078 --> 00:42:37,525
I don't intend to return home.

550
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,061
My plans are for myself.

551
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,552
Are you mad, vornoff?

552
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:49,486
One is always considered mad,

553
00:42:50,531 --> 00:42:54,816
when one discovers something
that others cannot grasp.

554
00:43:00,721 --> 00:43:03,597
Our government ordered
me to bring you back.

555
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,845
I'm afraid you will
find that rather difficult.

556
00:43:09,377 --> 00:43:14,020
You see, vornoff,
i did not come alone.

557
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:17,021
Neither did I,
my dear strowski.

558
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:19,541
Bring him along, lobo.

559
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,469
Come, come.

560
00:43:26,494 --> 00:43:27,954
Hurry!

561
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:35,631
You are a fool, vornoff.

562
00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:37,759
You... you may... you may kill me,

563
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,920
but others will come.
Silence.

564
00:43:39,761 --> 00:43:41,260
You will never get
away with this.

565
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:42,463
Put him in there.

566
00:43:42,488 --> 00:43:45,046
Vornoff! Vornoff! No! No!

567
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,103
Help! Help!

568
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:58,766
Vornoff! Vornoff!

569
00:43:58,953 --> 00:44:00,199
Vornoff!

570
00:44:04,633 --> 00:44:08,139
Now, professor strowski,

571
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:12,864
you will get a much closer view
of the product of my genius.

572
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,332
The alleged
monster of lake marsh.

573
00:44:26,223 --> 00:44:27,722
Vornoff! Vornoff!

574
00:44:27,723 --> 00:44:29,080
Vornoff! Vornoff!

575
00:44:29,223 --> 00:44:34,125
Your country offers fame
and fortune for my return,

576
00:44:35,078 --> 00:44:39,365
but my price is
so much more great.

577
00:44:44,221 --> 00:44:47,221
You will disappear,
professor strowski,

578
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,873
just as all the others
have disappeared.

579
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:04,741


580
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:13,899
vornoff! Vornoff!

581
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
It's a rental car.

582
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,599
Think it's the one
strowski used?

583
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,017
I'd make book it is.

584
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,980
It's getting dark now.

585
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:54,610
You take the car,
and go down to the beach.

586
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:56,906
I'll go through the swamp
to the old willows place.

587
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:57,918
Ok.

588
00:45:57,918 --> 00:45:59,752
Oh, here.
You'd better take this with you.

589
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:00,745
Right.

590
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,253
- Oh, Marty?
- Yeah?

591
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:04,753
You see anything suspicious,
you know where I am.

592
00:46:04,754 --> 00:46:07,254
Trouble is, everything
in this swamp is suspicious.

593
00:48:10,662 --> 00:48:12,022
What can I do for you, sir?

594
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:14,521
Captain Robbins, homicide.

595
00:48:14,522 --> 00:48:17,819
Why, captain I haven't murdered
anyone in a month of Sundays.

596
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:20,433
Did Janet lawton stop by here
late yesterday afternoon?

597
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:23,076
Oh, just a like a policeman,
no sense of humor.

598
00:48:23,077 --> 00:48:24,946
Yes, she stopped by
late in the afternoon.

599
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:25,919
Remember the time?

600
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:27,051
Well, not to the second.

601
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:30,480
She came in around two,
and left around 3:30.

602
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:32,306
Then again,
that isn't so late, is it?

603
00:48:32,307 --> 00:48:33,307
What'd she want?

604
00:48:33,308 --> 00:48:34,936
She was looking
for information.

605
00:48:34,937 --> 00:48:36,168
That I'm sure of.

606
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:37,669
Do you happen to know
what that information was?

607
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,680
Well, sure.

608
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,474
- Well?
Well, what?

609
00:48:40,474 --> 00:48:41,607
Must we play games?

610
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:42,935
I didn't know we were.

611
00:48:42,943 --> 00:48:44,930
What was miss lawton
looking for in the files?

612
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:46,930
Oh, well, why didn't you
ask that in the first place

613
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:48,931
instead of all
your chit-chat?

614
00:48:49,642 --> 00:48:52,142
She was looking over
the real estate files

615
00:48:52,152 --> 00:48:55,366
in October, November
and December of 1948.

616
00:48:55,578 --> 00:48:57,951
In particular, the sale
of the old willows place,

617
00:48:58,078 --> 00:48:59,490
out on lake marsh.

618
00:49:00,066 --> 00:49:01,722
Did she find what
she was looking for?

619
00:49:01,723 --> 00:49:04,727
Well I guess she did. At least,
she found the sales notice.

620
00:49:04,728 --> 00:49:06,722
I saw it myself
after she rushed out.

621
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:09,432
She left the paper open
at the November 26th date.

622
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:10,175
Wanna see it?

623
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,433
Why, very much.

624
00:49:11,443 --> 00:49:14,003
Well, it's right up there.
I haven't had time to put it back yet.

625
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,732
Yeah, Dr. Eric vornoff.

626
00:49:23,312 --> 00:49:24,812
Give me all you have on him.

627
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:29,042
I'll hang on.

628
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,157
Are we ready for the girl?

629
00:50:37,055 --> 00:50:38,055
Here.

630
00:50:39,324 --> 00:50:41,010
Oh, lovely.

631
00:51:42,973 --> 00:51:44,800
Strap her to the table.

632
00:51:46,756 --> 00:51:48,315
Do as I command you.

633
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:52,458
I'll teach you to disobey.

634
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,339
You will obey.

635
00:51:56,487 --> 00:51:57,936
Strap her in.

636
00:51:58,487 --> 00:52:02,129
Strap her in, I command you.

637
00:52:55,645 --> 00:52:57,746
Get the equipment ready.

638
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:13,868
It will hurt just for a moment,

639
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:17,665
and then you will emerge a woman

640
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:20,551
of super strength and beauty.

641
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,584
The bride of the atom.

642
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,684
You are insane.

643
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:26,990
My paper knows where I am.

644
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,158
You can't hurt me
and get away with it.

645
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:32,279
As soon as my experiments
are completed,

646
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,318
no one can ever touch me,

647
00:53:34,343 --> 00:53:36,886
I will make the law.

648
00:53:37,861 --> 00:53:40,891
Either way,
whether I succeed or fail,

649
00:53:41,871 --> 00:53:44,036
it will not
hurt you very long.

650
00:53:44,036 --> 00:53:46,459
Let me go! Let me go!

651
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:48,576
You heard what she said.

652
00:53:51,902 --> 00:53:53,167
Who are you?

653
00:53:53,168 --> 00:53:54,440
For one thing, the police.

654
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,255
Now turn her loose
and make it fast.

655
00:53:57,647 --> 00:54:00,072
You have the advantage
for the moment.

656
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:02,072
Stop talking
and turn her loose.

657
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,164
Dick.

658
00:54:12,137 --> 00:54:13,647
Take him out, quickly.

659
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:47,309
Where's lieutenant Craig?

660
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,081
We found strowski's
car down the road.

661
00:54:49,082 --> 00:54:50,582
Lieutenant took off
through the swamp.

662
00:54:50,591 --> 00:54:52,472
Sent me down here to
the beach to wait for him.

663
00:54:52,473 --> 00:54:53,373
Where was he heading?

664
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:54,498
Old willows place.

665
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,998
- Kelton.
Yes, sir.

666
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,499
Now, this is
your first time out.

667
00:54:57,524 --> 00:54:59,793
- Don't mess up the operation.
Yes, sir.

668
00:55:00,257 --> 00:55:01,508
I mean no, sir.

669
00:55:01,892 --> 00:55:03,389
martin,
you stay with me.

670
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:04,463
Yes, sir.

671
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:05,716
Come on.

672
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,719
I'm sure my experiments

673
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,219
on the young lady
will interest you.

674
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,457
I'll live to see you hang.

675
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,575
There are much more
important things to attend.

676
00:55:39,404 --> 00:55:42,043
I hope the straps
are not cutting.

677
00:55:43,414 --> 00:55:46,699
Such lovely skin
should not be marred.

678
00:56:24,478 --> 00:56:26,478
Lobo, stop.

679
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,222
Stop. Stop, I command!

680
00:56:33,745 --> 00:56:35,245
Stop!

681
00:56:41,755 --> 00:56:43,255


682
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:12,848
easy, Janet.

683
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,870
Janet, get me the gun.

684
00:57:53,084 --> 00:57:54,177
Easy.

685
00:59:13,664 --> 00:59:14,895
I've gotta stop him.

686
00:59:14,895 --> 00:59:16,893
You can't, he'll kill you.

687
00:59:16,894 --> 00:59:18,518
He probably will anyway.

688
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:25,588
Stay here.

689
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:28,972
Turn that thing off.

690
01:00:45,297 --> 01:00:46,419
Lobo!

691
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:51,056
No! No!

692
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:53,585
Stop.

693
01:00:54,182 --> 01:00:55,682
I beg you!

694
01:01:09,211 --> 01:01:10,550
stop!

695
01:01:41,493 --> 01:01:43,493
Kelton,
you station yourself here.

696
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:45,267
You men surround the house.

697
01:01:46,001 --> 01:01:47,500
martin, you come with me.

698
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:48,623
All right, captain.

699
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:52,018
- Ready?
Right.

700
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,117
look, the place is on fire.

701
01:04:02,118 --> 01:04:04,233
Let's get out of here
before we get roasted.

702
01:04:11,128 --> 01:04:13,128
Ca... captain, look!

703
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:24,314
What do you suppose
that was?

704
01:04:24,315 --> 01:04:25,812
Well, whatever
it is, get it.

705
01:04:25,813 --> 01:04:27,823
Oh, wait a minute.
Here comes dick.

706
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:33,383
He's got Janet.

707
01:04:33,408 --> 01:04:34,453
Get him!

708
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:36,985
No, don't shoot!
You might hit Janet.

709
01:04:36,985 --> 01:04:38,085
Let's go.

710
01:04:46,454 --> 01:04:47,636
- Marty.
Yeah?

711
01:04:47,636 --> 01:04:48,636
Give me a gun.

712
01:04:48,862 --> 01:04:50,124
Here you go.

713
01:05:16,156 --> 01:05:18,656
There he goes!

714
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:20,166
Can I suggest
something, captain?

715
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,165
No!
Now get on up over that ledge.

716
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:23,205
Get up over on top of him.

717
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:24,494
That's what I was gonna suggest.

718
01:05:24,494 --> 01:05:25,494
Well, stop the chattering.

719
01:05:25,495 --> 01:05:26,994
- Get in action.
Yes, sir.

720
01:05:33,504 --> 01:05:35,155
Now he's clear.
Give it to him.

721
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:50,534
I think it's broken.
Don't move, buddy.

722
01:08:06,074 --> 01:08:08,717
he tampered in god's domain.
