1
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,105
So, Nick...

2
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,046
...this is it?

3
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,611
As promised.

4
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:31,356
Let's do it.

5
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,015
I have a plane to catch.

6
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,275
You know, Sonny...

7
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,319
...you're wrong about him.
He's clean, man.

8
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,048
We're about to find out.

9
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,097
Put your guns down.

10
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,375
Hello, Sascha.

11
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,917
I'm Sonny Ekvall.

12
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,452
You work for me.

13
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,984
Nicholas, what is all this?

14
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,052
Caught a little heat.

15
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,993
One of our guys
is double-dealing with the Feds.

16
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,293
It's no big deal.
Just procedure.

17
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:50,766
-A polygraph.
-Nick was against this.

18
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,495
I see.

19
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,573
He says you are one of my family.

20
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:59,106
But he always did bring home strays.

21
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,939
That is why I am here.

22
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:06,375
Are you friend or foe?

23
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,077
I'm a friend.

24
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,953
Sascha Petrosevitch.

25
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,788
You are Russian.

26
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:19,056
Yeah, I'm Russian.
You got a problem with that?

27
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,065
I am an equal opportunities employer.

28
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,762
As long as you are working the scene
making me money...

29
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,928
...what do I care?

30
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:32,738
Who did you work for before
you landed in my lap?

31
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,171
Me.

32
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,782
-Doing what?
-I ran a highland crew...

33
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,853
...got popped,
did a nickel in Angola.

34
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,649
Just trying to get into
something simple.

35
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:49,818
I run the biggest crime syndicate
from Eastern Europe...

36
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:52,226
...to the Pacific Rim.

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,068
-That is simple?
-Cars are simple.

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,938
You work for any
law enforcement agencies?

39
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:07,238
Sometimes I work for the ClA,
the KGB...

40
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:12,578
...the U.S. Marshals, when I got a little
bit of spare time...

41
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,381
...I do a little something
for the Eastern Stasi.

42
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,162
You left out the FBl.

43
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:33,704
-Are you FBl?
-I boost cars. That's all.

44
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,276
I am a soldier trained in the art
of killing, not interrogation.

45
00:04:39,812 --> 00:04:42,440
Nick likes you.
He's a good boy.

46
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,915
He's like a little brother to me.
So for him, I make an exception.

47
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,611
But now, my patience is at the end.

48
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,820
Are you FBl?

49
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,331
No.

50
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,441
Welcome to my family, Sascha.

51
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,176
I told you.

52
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,283
Make sure the boat leaves tonight.

53
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,309
It's time, man.

54
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,149
-Time for what?
-To take that ring off.

55
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,747
She's a memory, Sasch.

56
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,484
You felt the loss.

57
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,355
Cried the tears.

58
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,655
There's nothing more to do, man.

59
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,129
I just can't let her go.

60
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,699
I respect that.

61
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,362
I feel that.

62
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,337
Anyway...

63
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,278
...I got a job.

64
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,345
You want it?

65
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:23,548
Yeah.

66
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:49,231
Yo, Sasch, stop playing!
Stop driving so fast!

67
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,271
Come on! Watch this!

68
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,955
Watch the forklift!

69
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,861
-Yeah, you like that.
-No, I don't like this.

70
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,306
Oh, my God.

71
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,634
I'm sorry about
what went down tonight.

72
00:07:55,808 --> 00:08:00,302
I told Sonny you was one of us,
but he runs the show his way.

73
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,711
-What's a Blue Book on these wheels?
-About 1 98 grand.

74
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:07,979
-That makes my 5% worth what?
-9600. Give or take.

75
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,952
I'll take half now,
half when I deliver, right?

76
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:13,591
You'll get it when we get there.

77
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,057
Half now, Nicholas,
or we give this back.

78
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,866
-How long we known each other?
-Two and a half years.

79
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,005
So for about two...

80
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,301
...two and a half years...

81
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,604
...I've been asking you
to call me Nick.

82
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,312
-I like Nicholas, all right?
-No, it's not all right.

83
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,024
It's all right. Put a little thug in it.
Maybe you'll get your money.

84
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,188
I love Nicholas, all right?

85
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,352
-Was that good?
-No, check it out.

86
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,690
Read my lips.

87
00:08:52,098 --> 00:08:54,498
-All right.
-All right.

88
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,658
-How was that?
-See how I'm doing that?

89
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:59,532
All right. See what I'm getting at?

90
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,297
I think....

91
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,408
That's tough for me.

92
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:06,470
You whiter than I thought.

93
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,287
-Stop playing.
-I'm a bad man, you know that.

94
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:31,597
Stop the car!

95
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,983
I'm gonna kick your ass one day.

96
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,587
What are you guys doing?
Back to work!

97
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,883
We're putting these cars
on the road in 37 minutes.

98
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,926
-Where's my money?
-Hey, I'm good for it.

99
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,757
-You know me.
-And you know me.

100
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,661
Now, I want my 9600 or I'm gonna
take this big goddamn hammer...

101
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,303
-Hey, come on.
-...and have some fun.

102
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,939
Hey, Sasch. Sasch.

103
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,969
-You know you're crazy, right?
-Cuckoo crazy.

104
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,741
-You expecting somebody?
-No.

105
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,115
Get this car out of here.

106
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:39,729
-Nicholas Frazier?
-Who wants to know?

107
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:44,199
Special Agent Williams.
I'm with the FBl.

108
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,545
Maybe you've heard of us?

109
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:54,810
Yeah, I've heard of you.

110
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,790
That's no way to start.
Put your guns down. Let's talk.

111
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,019
I don't talk to pigs without my lawyer.

112
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,789
I'm a lawyer.
You want my advice?

113
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:10,197
Put the guns down. I'm looking
to bring down Sonny Ekvall.

114
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,861
You wanna negotiate?
I'll cut you a sweet deal.

115
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,304
Witness protection.
No time served.

116
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,968
Ekvall's not for sale.

117
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,674
You ever done hard time, Nick?

118
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,740
Ever been somebody's bitch?

119
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,513
You got big balls for a woman,
you know that?

120
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:37,152
And you've got exactly five
seconds to put the guns down.

121
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,595
Otherwise, people are gonna die.
You want that on your conscience?

122
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,396
-Nobody's gotta die tonight.
-I'm not talking to you!

123
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,033
That's one, Nick.

124
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:53,239
-You know, Sonny has a rule.
-What's that?

125
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,107
That's two, Nick.

126
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,009
Three!

127
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,146
Nobody gets taken alive.

128
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,582
-Four!
-That's a bad rule, man.

129
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,780
Five!
Put the goddamn guns down, now!

130
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:08,449
-Put the gun down, man.
-It's a nice night to die.

131
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:54,364
BP's dropping fast.
We gotta get this guy out of flat line!

132
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,728
He's going into cardiac arrest!

133
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,233
Clear!

134
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:03,106
Clear!

135
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:06,938
One, two, three!

136
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:12,108
One, two, three, four, five!

137
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,154
One, two, three, four, five!

138
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:38,135
We got a pulse!

139
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:20,712
I can't believe I ended up in this
situation. This is bullshit.

140
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,206
My friend.

141
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,749
Sasch?
How you been, man?

142
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,686
-I've been better. How you feel?
-It's like I'm seeing a ghost.

143
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,690
Give me some love, man!

144
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,956
-Thought you was dead.
-For a while, but I'm back.

145
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,196
I'm sorry about what happened
in the warehouse.

146
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,393
I lost it. I went ballistic.

147
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,437
Forget it.
Where'd you come from?

148
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,141
They sent me down from
the SHU, Pelican Bay.

149
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,972
-What about you?
-lnfirmary, San Quentin.

150
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:24,775
-Got another five years in this rat hole.
-I got two.

151
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,750
Well, are we all right?
Or we got issues?

152
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:31,788
-What're you talking about?
-You might be pissed off.

153
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,154
I don't wanna spend
the next five years...

154
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,127
...wondering if my nigger
want to slit me from ear to ear.

155
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,629
You're my man.

156
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,826
When you get inside, you're gonna
have issues. They won't be with me.

157
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,528
You all right?

158
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,075
I'll see you on the inside.

159
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,323
-What are you packing?
-It's my leg.

160
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,557
I'm gonna ask again.
What are you packing?

161
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:15,063
This.

162
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,369
You wanna play rough?
I can play rough.

163
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,202
Sorry, I'm not into men.

164
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,764
You don't know who I am?

165
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,770
Just doing my job, boss.

166
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,634
-You gonna like this.
-That's enough.

167
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,782
You gonna learn to respect me.

168
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,152
My kids hit harder than that.

169
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,085
Chump.

170
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,197
What you bringing
into my island, ese?

171
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,808
My knee. It's titanium.

172
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,471
-Which one?
-Left.

173
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,796
You got a hard head, homeboy.

174
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,602
Do yourself a favor.
Keep it on your shoulders.

175
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,777
All right. Back to work.

176
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:13,648
The attorney general
and Federal Bureau of Prisons...

177
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,653
...welcome you to the U.S. Federal
Penitentiary at Alcatraz.

178
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:21,190
Mr. Hubbard, Robert Kennedy
closed Alcatraz in 1 963...

179
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:25,294
...claiming it was
cruel and inhumane--

180
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:29,366
Actually, he closed it in June of '62.
What's your question?

181
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:33,733
Some say the new Alcatraz is a step
back in criminal warehousing...

182
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:38,206
...especially now with the inauguration
of your new execution chamber.

183
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,605
How do you respond?

184
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:43,305
Our society has become
more violent and more corrupt.

185
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:47,441
One out of every 30 men
in the United States is....

186
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:51,586
-What's the word I'm looking for?
-Criminally challenged.

187
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,157
"Criminally challenged."
That's the catch phrase now.

188
00:19:56,328 --> 00:20:01,698
-You're not answering the question.
-I think we have a generational gap.

189
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:05,564
Perhaps my younger associate
can help clear things up.

190
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,433
Give them a good sound bite, Donny.

191
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,842
Alcatraz is a bad place
for bad people.

192
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:17,539
If there's any discomfort here,
that's how it should be.

193
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,560
Fresh meat, dog!

194
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:03,394
Welcome to la Isla de los Alcatraces.

195
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,122
The lsland of Pelicans.

196
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:11,861
You've been transferred here as part
of a work program to retrofit my island.

197
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:16,406
But your free time will be spent
in a six-by-nine-foot cell.

198
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:17,906
I urge you:

199
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:22,274
Unplug. Kick your feet up.

200
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,750
You will leave a big chunk
of your lives here.

201
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:31,021
Mi nombre es Juan Ruiz Escarzaga.

202
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:36,559
My first summertime job was walking
a super-maximum tier 30 years ago.

203
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:39,196
I walked it for over 1 5 years.

204
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:44,097
Been spit on, stabbed, burned.

205
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:48,139
And I'm still standing.

206
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,203
You think you're hard.

207
00:21:51,276 --> 00:21:53,369
I'm harder.

208
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,975
You think you're mean.

209
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,309
I'm meaner.

210
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,920
Alcatraz es mi casa.

211
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:07,684
You are my guest.
I expect you to act like one.

212
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,759
Son of a bitch!

213
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:13,955
-What hole are you on, Little Joe?
-Seventeen.

214
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,532
How you hitting it?

215
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:23,533
Like a mother. Just can't putt.

216
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:29,279
Little Joe here has a constructive
way of passing his free time.

217
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:33,680
I suggest you find something
of the same. Be creative.

218
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:38,915
Remember, this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

219
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,582
Ain't that right, Twitch?

220
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,720
Same old, same old, man.

221
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,231
Get a new rap, comprende?

222
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,835
I like my rap.

223
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,201
And here's the end of it.

224
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:01,612
You got two libros in your bundle.

225
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:06,674
The rules and regs,
and the King James Bible.

226
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:09,912
I highly recommend
you read them both.

227
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:16,519
Now for those stupid enough
to think about escaping, go ahead.

228
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,858
Climb the razor wire.
Do the breaststroke.

229
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,658
Freeze your ass off.

230
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:26,495
If the bay doesn't kill you,
we'll pick you up in a Zodiac...

231
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,037
...and add five years
to your sentence.

232
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:35,070
There's only one way
off this rock, homeys.

233
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,273
And that key is under my pillow.

234
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:45,289
I'm a fair man. You come to me
with a problem, I'll listen.

235
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:49,960
Dead man walking.

236
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,397
This man is about to make history.

237
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:08,603
He will be the first to die
in Alcatraz's execution chamber.

238
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,807
It is unfortunately my duty
to carry this out...

239
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,748
...at midnight tonight.

240
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,684
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
Jane McPherson has just landed...

241
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:27,025
...at New Alcatraz to witness
the execution of Lester McKenna.

242
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,895
She is the judge
who sentenced McKenna...

243
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:34,767
...in the now infamous heist of almost
$200 million of U.S. gold brick.

244
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,207
Here's the twist: McKenna stashed
the gold before he was apprehended.

245
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:43,347
He vowed never to divulge
its whereabouts...

246
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:48,384
...which led to the treasure hunt by
the FBI that's gone on for 17 years.

247
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:53,354
Now it's looking like McKenna just
might take his secret to the grave.

248
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,653
Reporting live from Pier 39
on Fisherman's Wharf...

249
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,763
...I'm Kelly Lange
from San Francisco.

250
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,475
Hey, Mark.

251
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,474
Hey, William.

252
00:25:13,945 --> 00:25:17,574
Here we are.
Now, let's check in your guns.

253
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:21,412
-I think we'll keep our guns.
-Then get off my island.

254
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,720
-It's okay, Juan. I'll sign off on it.
-No, Frank. I won't.

255
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:28,951
I don't care if she is
a supreme court justice.

256
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:31,493
-No disrespect intended.
-None taken.

257
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,960
This is my island.

258
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,261
As long as it's my watch,
only me and my boys go strapped.

259
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,565
What is it they call you?

260
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:46,568
-El Fuego.
-The fire?

261
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:53,181
Do what he says.

262
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,956
Yo, Sasch!

263
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,861
Yeah.

264
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,332
I really messed things up
this time, didn't l?

265
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:23,767
Yes, you did.

266
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:31,074
I'm starting to miss the love
from the streets.

267
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:33,774
That's gonna be an issue, isn't it?

268
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:39,049
What you think, man? I can't
do no five years in this joint.

269
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,818
Here, player. Read a book.

270
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:45,459
What's this, man?

271
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:49,324
-When Lovers Collide.
-It's a good book.

272
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,059
You can't be serious.

273
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:56,071
Petrosevitch, get up.
Someone wants to see you.

274
00:28:58,636 --> 00:28:59,762
Hello, Jenny.

275
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,430
-Please identify yourself.
-Kestner, Damon J.

276
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:06,805
Voice and handprint
recognition confirmed.

277
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:22,955
-How much time do you need?
-Phones are easy. Alarms worry me.

278
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,154
I gotta crack the firewall,
decode and override.

279
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,459
I don't care how you do it.
Do it in 90 seconds.

280
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,070
-Tie me off.
-Ninety seconds.

281
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,936
-Welcome to Slaughterhouse Five.
-Why they call it that?

282
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,574
A man can be executed five ways.
Lethal injection's the most popular...

283
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:51,916
...followed by gas chamber, hanging,
firing squad and my favorite:

284
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,148
Electrocution.

285
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:59,695
We do it all here in this totally
soundproof isolation chamber.

286
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:02,424
We even let
the condemned man choose.

287
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,967
-Who is that?
-Number 1 1 37.

288
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,729
What's he doing here?

289
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:13,208
When a man asks for someone
to spend his last hour with, you do it.

290
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:19,974
Access granted.
Security protocols disabled.

291
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:22,681
Take me up!

292
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,526
-49er Six to 49er One.
-This is One. Over.

293
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:38,863
-That was a hell of a sunset.
-They're always nice before a storm.

294
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:09,264
-You believe in God, Sascha?
-Most of the time.

295
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:12,767
Ever fly in your dreams?

296
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:19,034
-Who is this guy?
-I'm a man with 50 minutes to live.

297
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,735
What does that have to do with me?

298
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:28,182
Change the view, will you?
I'm tired of this one.

299
00:31:28,353 --> 00:31:31,550
-What would you prefer, Lester?
-The desert.

300
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,624
-How does that sound?
-Hot.

301
00:31:34,792 --> 00:31:38,250
The rumor is you went
half past dead and came back.

302
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,956
Took a ride on the flat line
for 22 minutes...

303
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,624
...and lived to tell.

304
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:49,435
Thought we could play some cards
and talk about that.

305
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,927
Whoever wired this place was good,
but you're the best.

306
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,504
Exactly.
49er One to 49er Six. You ready?

307
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,302
If you're waiting on us,
you're back and up.

308
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:26,738
Let's party, boys.

309
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,722
-Excuse me, sir. I need to talk to you.
-What's up?

310
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,962
-I can't reach the control center.
-What about the alarms?

311
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:51,363
I ran a systems check.
The radar's reading normal.

312
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,333
-Cell houses?
-No breaches.

313
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:58,806
The storm must have knocked out
the phone lines. Okay. Gracias.

314
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,002
Billy Ray, check it out.

315
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,272
I'm with y'all. I'm one of y'all.

316
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:44,180
-Sorry.
-Check this out. Let me out of here.

317
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:47,875
-Cell house secured.
-That's my girl.

318
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:55,792
Hey, what's up, doll?
Give me one of them pistols, man.

319
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,958
-What's that?
-What's it look like?

320
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,499
It's the suit I promised you.

321
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:09,332
It's not first-class,
but it's a good knockoff.

322
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,280
You know, I volunteered for this.

323
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:24,115
I got tired of parading in and out of
court, hawking appeals, filing writs.

324
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,416
What am I doing?
I'm displacing blame.

325
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,153
So I decided to accept
my karmic payback.

326
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:33,422
Now I'm not so sure.

327
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:36,465
Dying's not the hard part.

328
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,335
It's knowing that your life
doesn't belong to you.

329
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:45,841
That your death has an exact time and
date takes all the mystery out of it.

330
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:50,547
Thought about doing it myself,
but I couldn't.

331
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:56,545
What's waiting on the other side?

332
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,616
Not too many people
know that, Lester.

333
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,557
Come on. Be generous.
My time's precious.

334
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:09,256
Tell me how it feels
to be embraced by the light.

335
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:12,493
Do your loved ones come for you?

336
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:38,762
Got any jacks?

337
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,824
Anybody hit?

338
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:46,026
Seven's down.

339
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:51,498
He's your man.

340
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,674
Sleep tight, friend.

341
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,979
-Wanna know why I'm in that chair?
-No.

342
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:08,989
I hit a U.S. money train...

343
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,961
...and ripped off 200 million worth
of U.S. gold brick.

344
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:19,835
-You must have done more than that.
-The deal went sideways on me.

345
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:25,533
Train got accidentally derailed.
Five U.S. Treasury agents got killed.

346
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,372
Feds have been coming all week...

347
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:34,245
...promising me serenity
if I tell them where I hid it.

348
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,854
You think God'll go easier
on me if I do?

349
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:42,320
I think you must have done
something very bad...

350
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:46,657
...and now you're gonna pay
for it with your life.

351
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,299
But I think God will forgive you.

352
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:57,731
-Air 49er, what's your air to ground?
-I got zero visibility.

353
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,241
-Give me a ballpark ETA.
-My ETA's been pushed.

354
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:05,075
-We're getting close. Push back.
-I'm on my way.

355
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:16,387
Lester, there is someone
here to see you.

356
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,521
Hello, Lester.

357
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:28,601
"Whosoever sheds man's blood,
by man shall his blood be shed."

358
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,738
Genesis 9, verse 6.

359
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:36,175
You read that the day you decided
my life wasn't worth living.

360
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:39,077
The jury decided. I presided.

361
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,350
It's okay.

362
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:59,699
You're a long way from Pennsylvania
Avenue. Why'd you make the trip?

363
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:03,771
Because of that ruling
I made 1 7 years ago.

364
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:09,878
You want my forgiveness.
That's why you came, isn't it?

365
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:19,555
It was my job to sentence you.

366
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:24,559
Now that your death warrant's come
down, it's my job to see it through.

367
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,960
Well, that's very honorable of you.

368
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:31,961
Goodbye, Lester.

369
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,275
Let's go, Petrosevitch.

370
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,928
What the hell?

371
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,432
Any last words?

372
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:50,211
Thanks for the suit.

373
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,596
-What's that?
-What the hell?

374
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,700
Nice suit.

375
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:20,241
-Show us what you got.
-Get your ass up there.

376
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,005
-Come on, man.
-Come on. Come on.

377
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:31,086
-Oh, dude.
-Damn.

378
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,750
Your turn, Little Joe.

379
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,662
My big black ass up that rope?

380
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,960
Goddamn, Joe.

381
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:47,160
What about you, you little bitch?
Give it a try, let's go!

382
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:51,775
-Up!
-No. Not me.

383
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,069
That's not what I'm gonna do.

384
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:58,446
But you, you know,
you should climb on up there.

385
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,414
I'm gonna go over here myself...

386
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,578
...and watch you fall
and bust your ass...

387
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:09,426
...you little bitch.

388
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:16,592
-What are you doing, man?
-Let it go!

389
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,471
49er One to Air 49er.
What's your 20? Over.

390
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:35,745
According to radar, I'm over you.
But I'm in a total whiteout.

391
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,913
Take your eyes off of the radar
and look for the lighthouse.

392
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,354
No!

393
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,397
What's going on up there?

394
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,697
I think we just lost our ride.

395
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:33,307
Oh, man. You all see this?

396
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,128
Please identify yourself.

397
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,493
-Kestner, Damon J.
-Access denied.

398
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,964
You gotta say it louder.

399
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,160
Kestner, Damon J.

400
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:04,503
Voice and handprint
recognition confirmed.

401
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,327
Let me handle this guy.

402
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:38,365
Make sure he's dead.

403
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:44,878
Let it be. It's blood money.

404
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,874
Got yourself born again
since you came to prison?

405
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:52,045
I found God, yes.

406
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,884
There is no God.

407
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:56,185
I told you no last week.

408
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,195
If you're going to kill me, do it.
I'm dead already.

409
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:17,276
Are you going to take me
to the gold? Yes or no?

410
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,714
Yes or no?

411
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:36,092
I can't kill you, Lester.

412
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,995
I need you.

413
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:42,767
But there's a lot of innocent
people here I just don't need.

414
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,472
I'm what shrinks call sociopathic.
Know what that means?

415
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:54,811
It means I can kill everybody
in this room and not feel bad about it.

416
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,582
But you...

417
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,952
...you had to find God
to get over your guilt.

418
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,561
But God is dead.

419
00:46:08,866 --> 00:46:14,304
And so is everybody in this room
if you don't take me where I wanna go.

420
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,493
What you got?

421
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:47,660
Coast Guard reports a
helicopter went down.

422
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,238
-Any word from Alcatraz?
-Phones are down.

423
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:51,396
Convenient.

424
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:54,476
-A cell house was compromised.
-Which one?

425
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,876
E-Block. It's temporary while
they retrofit the main house.

426
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:59,879
-ls he in there?
-Cell A-5.

427
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,245
-Who?
-We got a man in deep cover.

428
00:47:02,419 --> 00:47:04,512
-As a prisoner?
-Yeah.

429
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,987
What kind of man signs up for that?

430
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,256
Hey, mama. You got
that blue stuff working, huh?

431
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:09,903
49er Six to 49er One.
I think it's time for plan B.

432
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,208
-How bad?
-Total loss.

433
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:15,277
All right, get back here.

434
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:18,471
Sexy little thing, you.

435
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:25,918
Let me see that gun, mama.

436
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:32,088
-Let's get ready for the FBl.
-Right.

437
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:48,036
We got something.

438
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:00,253
-What is it?
-Cellular transmission.

439
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:03,587
-Start the trace. Put them on speaker.
-You're live.

440
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,160
This is Special Agent Williams, FBl.

441
00:51:06,329 --> 00:51:09,492
Let's not be so formal,
Special Agent Williams.

442
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,863
-I like first names.
-All right. My name's Ellen.

443
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:15,630
-Let's talk hostages.
-I've got 1 0.

444
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:18,001
-How many women?
-Three.

445
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,406
-Show good faith. Let the women go.
-Relax, Ellen.

446
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,175
Everything in time.

447
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,973
Tell me what you're doing.

448
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:32,053
You a bad boy who didn't get
enough love from his mother?

449
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:35,919
Maybe trying to prove a point?
Teach Uncle Sam a lesson?

450
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,755
Oh, no. I love America.

451
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,193
-Then what's your cause?
-Me.

452
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,926
-And who are you?
-Who I am is not important.

453
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,735
But who I have...

454
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,274
...and what you're gonna
give me for her is.

455
00:52:29,412 --> 00:52:31,937
Easy, now. I'm just
looking for my men.

456
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,541
They're all dead.

457
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,247
Get her, and throw her down here.

458
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:39,752
Who are you?

459
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,720
Eleven-thirty-seven.

460
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,587
Eleven-thirty-seven?

461
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:46,688
Bust her, Sasch!

462
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:10,879
Little Joe!

463
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,554
Yo, Nick.

464
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:18,292
-You got this little freak handled?
-I got her.

465
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:20,520
Yo, we got your back, dog.

466
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,751
What's the matter, baby girl,
you don't like me?

467
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:51,122
I thought you liked me.
Come on, you little freak.

468
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,633
Nice shooting, Ma.

469
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:35,464
You just shot up a room full of cans.

470
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:39,337
Why don't we put the guns down...

471
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:42,910
...and do this like men?

472
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:52,218
You first.

473
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,835
-I'm telling you.
-You all right?

474
00:56:19,008 --> 00:56:20,942
I'm all right, man...

475
00:56:21,344 --> 00:56:23,244
...but we got issues.

476
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:31,017
You listen carefully. Here's what you'll
give us in exchange for the hostages.

477
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:35,624
A helicopter ride off this rock
and a fueled jet waiting...

478
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,454
...to take us
to an undisclosed location.

479
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:41,756
I can't approve those
demands without authorization.

480
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,929
-Then get authorized.
-I need time.

481
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:47,865
You're boring me
with these stall tactics.

482
00:56:48,037 --> 00:56:52,474
Put your playbook down, and give
the attorney general a wakeup call.

483
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,907
-What if he doesn't meet your demands?
-I start target practice.

484
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,038
And don't try that Waco, Texas
Special-Op stuff, either...

485
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,286
-...or I'll light this justice up.
-Light her up?

486
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,388
Let me give you the visual.

487
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:12,151
As we speak, Miss McPherson's
strapped to the electric chair.

488
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:17,232
All I have to do is flip a switch
and, well, she's dead.

489
00:57:17,667 --> 00:57:20,500
Dead by the tool of her trade.

490
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:26,302
Now send me my helicopter
before I start filling body bags.

491
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:32,005
Put Special Ops on a "Will notify."
Find out who the phone's registered to.

492
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,275
Computer's printing it out now.

493
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,786
-Nothing's ever easy, huh?
-Not today.

494
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,587
Hang on to this.

495
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,598
-Come on, dog.
-Do it, dog.

496
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,870
You ain't gonna make it.

497
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,840
Yo, you bust a cap
in that freaky bitch, or what?

498
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,477
Or what.

499
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,780
-We lost 3, 4 and 5.
-How?

500
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,083
Prisoner 1 1 37.

501
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:27,001
Who's 1 1 37?

502
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:29,628
A major pain in your ass.

503
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:33,338
You think you're funny now?

504
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,711
Sascha, is that you?

505
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:44,649
How does one of the FBl's
finest marksmen...

506
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:48,382
-...shoot an undercover agent?
-I don't have time for this.

507
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:51,823
Some nut says he's gonna waste
a supreme court justice.

508
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,223
Give me the 41 1.

509
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:57,264
These guys are 1 0, 1 5 strong,
minus the three I took out.

510
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,264
-Do they have McPherson?
-I don't know.

511
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:03,428
But I'll tell you one thing,
they're very heavily armed.

512
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,129
Hey.

513
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,405
-What's going on?
-Welcome to the party.

514
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,979
-Glad you could make it.
-What are you doing, Donny?

515
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,549
Put your weapons down!

516
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:22,256
About time you boys grew some hair
on your chest. Now what?

517
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:23,925
Put your weapons down.

518
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:32,894
Don't stop now. You started out
with such authority...

519
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:37,263
-...such conviction. Keep it going.
-Here's how it's gonna go.

520
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,241
You're gonna unstrap Miss McPherson
and we're gonna walk her out of here.

521
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:45,176
What do you think, Miss Jane?

522
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,713
Do it now!

523
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:07,936
You gave it a try, boys.
I can respect that.

524
01:00:08,137 --> 01:00:10,298
But I don't take orders.

525
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,875
Happy you wore that body armor?

526
01:00:22,051 --> 01:00:25,748
What am I doing here?
Well, let me see.

527
01:00:25,922 --> 01:00:29,585
I'm gonna dig up $200 million
worth of U.S. gold brick...

528
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:34,091
...take an early retirement south
of the border. Work on my tan.

529
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,231
-You want in?
-I'm not dirty.

530
01:00:36,432 --> 01:00:39,799
-Well, I am.
-Why? You were treated good.

531
01:00:40,003 --> 01:00:44,702
65G a year and a watch when I'm 60
won't get me a piece of the rock.

532
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:50,073
I want the American dream, Frank.
And I'm gonna get it.

533
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:53,439
Donald Robert Johnson, age 33.

534
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,585
Served in Kuwait and Bosnia,
three tours.

535
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,517
Purple Heart. He was shot four times.

536
01:00:59,689 --> 01:01:03,147
Suffers from Gulf War Syndrome.
Honorary discharge.

537
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:07,659
Last 1 8 months, working at the Federal
Bureau of Prisons. Can you help?

538
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,855
-I can try.
-Without compromising...

539
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:13,298
-...the life of Jane McPherson?
-I'll use a soft hammer.

540
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:17,303
-You don't own one.
-Besides me, what are your options?

541
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,975
-Special Ops.
-They'll see them coming.

542
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:23,635
-I could meet their demands.
-What if they kill her anyway?

543
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:27,442
I'll be pushing pencils
for the rest of my career.

544
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,781
-Sounds like I'm all you've got.
-This is heavy, Sascha.

545
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:33,114
I'll be in touch.

546
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,954
This some tasty stuff, dog.
Come peep it out.

547
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,685
Look at this.

548
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,558
Put that down before
you hurt somebody.

549
01:01:42,765 --> 01:01:44,494
I got no beef with you.

550
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,896
Put it down before you
blow your dick off.

551
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:50,561
How's he gonna do that, Joe?
Target's too small.

552
01:01:52,909 --> 01:01:55,901
Mine's bigger than yours,
little big-city boy.

553
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,677
-You know you got problems?
-What's the problem?

554
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:05,081
-Twitch wants to blow something up.
-He wanna blow some shit up.

555
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:07,950
-You wanna blow something up?
-Hell, yeah.

556
01:02:08,124 --> 01:02:11,924
Put this on your shoulder.
Put your index finger here.

557
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,029
Line that up nice.
Right about like that.

558
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:18,029
-Sayonara, you little busters.
-Let her rip.

559
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,671
Get him out of here, man.

560
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:35,945
You all right?

561
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:39,748
-Told you about pushing buttons.
-What a rush.

562
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:53,260
All right, boys. Pick your poison.

563
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:57,873
-So we giving these wackos guns?
-We need all the help we can get.

564
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:01,401
-What happened up in the chopper?
-Radioed for backup.

565
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,736
-Hey, Sasch.
-Yeah?

566
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,640
You like that?

567
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,217
Think I can do some damage
with this one?

568
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:11,717
-This mine?
-Take it.

569
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:13,719
Oh, you the man, Sasch.

570
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,382
-Twitch is in the house.
-This weapon was made for you.

571
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,927
-Small and compact.
-Little and mean.

572
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:25,362
This some crazy shit, Sasch.

573
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:29,164
-Cuckoo crazy.
-Way beyond that.

574
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,101
Why are you doing this?

575
01:03:34,076 --> 01:03:37,273
Little late in the game
for that, isn't it?

576
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,044
Haven't you been paying attention?

577
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:42,343
Well, we know you want the gold.

578
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:44,577
But you're more than greedy.

579
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:49,581
There must be some reason for that.
What happened to you?

580
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:54,361
Feel like I should be laying on
a couch with a box of Kleenex.

581
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:57,397
Talking about how my father beat me.

582
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,663
-Or about how my mother raped me.
-Did they?

583
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:10,169
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

584
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:17,145
Tell me, how many candles did they
put on your birthday cake this year?

585
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:20,551
I know it's not polite to ask
a woman her age...

586
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:24,784
...but you're not hung up on
superficial things like that, right?

587
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:28,089
Youngest supreme court justice ever.

588
01:04:28,264 --> 01:04:31,859
One of only three women
ever appointed.

589
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:35,928
You're gonna be in the
history books one day.

590
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:39,400
I'm 53.

591
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,539
Fifty-three.

592
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,942
You sure are an attractive 53 too.

593
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:54,889
Little long in the tooth for my taste,
but let me see.

594
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,152
Yes.

595
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:02,354
You have kept your bait fresh.

596
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:07,067
You're probably pretty smart too.

597
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,199
So tell me...

598
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:15,773
...why have you
never been married?

599
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:19,113
No one ever asked me.

600
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:23,116
Too busy burning bras?

601
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:28,223
Getting your panties in a twist over
women's rights, equal pay, pro-choice.

602
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:30,621
Fighting the cause, right?

603
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,489
And all that time...

604
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,766
...you forgot about love,
didn't you?

605
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:45,471
And your biological clock
stopped ticking.

606
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:50,640
Your fields went fallow.

607
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,077
And now, in the autumn
of your historic life...

608
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:04,351
...you ain't got nothing.

609
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:07,661
Do you, Miss Jane?

610
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:10,354
Not even a dog.

611
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:18,301
I have my work.

612
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:23,803
That's my story. What's yours?

613
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:29,942
Sorry to disappoint you after your
candor and all the tears falling down.

614
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,611
There is no deep psychological
reason for my behavior.

615
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,659
I just saw a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I took it.

616
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:37,819
I just saw a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity and I took it.

617
01:07:02,718 --> 01:07:03,980
We've got her!

618
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,850
Come on. Come on. Come on down!

619
01:07:09,925 --> 01:07:11,688
Get these doors open!

620
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,853
-Take Lester and get out!
-I'm not leaving without you.

621
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:20,798
Please help me. Get me out of here.

622
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,493
Get them open now!

623
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:24,530
I'll be back!

624
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:31,212
Give me that rifle!

625
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:33,512
Come on.

626
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:35,842
Bring her up.

627
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,542
-Something wrong out there?
-Nope. Everything's peachy.

628
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:11,913
Then why am I talking to you?
Who are you?

629
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:13,884
I'm second in command.

630
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:16,047
Where's our helicopter?

631
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,625
We've still got 36 minutes.

632
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:22,491
You're a woman, which means
you know we don't like to wait.

633
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:25,759
So get the chopper airborne now.

634
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,931
Or I will fry this lily-white bitch.

635
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,472
Send the chopper.

636
01:11:25,914 --> 01:11:30,544
-Don't even think about it!
-Your clip's dry, 1 1 37. You know it.

637
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:31,978
Do you think so?

638
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,755
Yeah. You'd have used it
by now if it wasn't.

639
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:37,991
Are you sure?

640
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:40,728
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

641
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,332
That's right. Magazine's dry.

642
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,664
Question is, do I still have
one in the tube?

643
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:52,039
I say you're dry.

644
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,938
Make your move.

645
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:11,250
-That's a nice bluff.
-Wasn't a bluff. It was a misfire.

646
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,022
Where's Lester?

647
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,021
Find him yourself.

648
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,961
Sweet dreams, partner.

649
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,582
Damn!

650
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,023
Yo, Sasch. You need to holler at me.

651
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,854
-Later.
-No, now.

652
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:49,828
-I need to know what's going on.
-Watch my back like usual.

653
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:53,900
I got your back. That's a given.
I need to know the game plan.

654
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,004
I'm on a tight clock, man.
I don't got time.

655
01:12:57,172 --> 01:13:02,235
Are you hiding something from me?
I get the feeling like you are.

656
01:13:04,413 --> 01:13:09,544
Nothing. I'm trying to save the life
of the supreme court justice.

657
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:12,653
-There's more.
-Now's not the time, brother.

658
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:14,718
Yes, it is.

659
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:20,693
I'm undercover.

660
01:13:23,866 --> 01:13:25,993
FBl.

661
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:31,204
-But you passed the lie detector test.
-Anybody can do that.

662
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,941
All this time, you've been
setting up on me.

663
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,414
I believed in you.

664
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:51,054
I trusted you.

665
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,793
I've let you into my family.
I vouched for you.

666
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,762
And you betrayed me?

667
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,269
It's not that simple.

668
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:08,136
Don't do it.

669
01:14:17,519 --> 01:14:19,487
Well, I'm sorry.

670
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:31,556
I thought we were friends, Sasch.

671
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:38,729
We are. You can bet
your life on that.

672
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:53,546
-ls the helicopter here?
-Yeah. Where's Lester?

673
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,656
I've got him.

674
01:15:03,365 --> 01:15:05,925
You've got something of mine, 1 1 37.

675
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:07,761
I want it back.

676
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,438
I'll swap you.
Lester for the judge.

677
01:15:12,374 --> 01:15:16,504
-What do you want the judge for?
-She's my ticket out of here.

678
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:20,546
You give me Lester, and we'll
let you thumb a ride with us.

679
01:15:20,949 --> 01:15:25,045
Hitchhiking's dangerous. Didn't
your mama ever tell you that?

680
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:32,055
-When and where?
-Main cell house, 1 5 minutes.

681
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,894
Fifteen minutes.

682
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:43,027
Unstrap the judge.

683
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:55,040
Get fired up, boys. He took the bait.

684
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:02,346
Hey, how do I look?

685
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:06,922
Like a big-ass prom queen.

686
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:16,164
You sure you want to do this?

687
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:20,364
My destiny is in God's hands.
I'm cool with that.

688
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:26,443
Now, I want to tell you
about a place I used to go.

689
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:30,176
It's an alpine lake called Trinity,
west of Shasta.

690
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,780
There's a little cove on the
north bank, tucked away.

691
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:38,351
You should take a trip there
when this is over.

692
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,130
Trinity Lake, west of Shasta.

693
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,792
Take the trip.

694
01:16:57,346 --> 01:17:00,440
-It's him.
-What the hell's going on out there?

695
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,779
-I got everything under control.
-Any good news?

696
01:17:03,986 --> 01:17:08,116
I'm trading the condemned man
for McPherson. You happy?

697
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:09,312
Thrilled.

698
01:17:09,491 --> 01:17:11,584
Give them their chopper.

699
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:16,662
I already did all that. I'm sorry
I'm yelling. I'm a little edgy.

700
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:19,095
Don't worry. I got it handled.

701
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,648
Hey. You got room for two in there?

702
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,451
There is now.

703
01:17:55,570 --> 01:18:00,007
You know, you gotta break
a few things down to me, man.

704
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:07,708
What am I doing here? Earning
your trust, maintaining my cover.

705
01:18:08,684 --> 01:18:10,652
You already screwed that up.

706
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,820
The Bureau thought
if we did time together...

707
01:18:13,989 --> 01:18:18,050
...you'd trust me with more
information back out on the streets.

708
01:18:21,329 --> 01:18:23,354
You want Sonny that bad?

709
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:26,891
My wife's dead because of him.

710
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:32,468
She died after one of his men jacked my
car and put four bullets in her chest.

711
01:18:34,109 --> 01:18:37,340
You bet your life I want him that bad.

712
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,009
I'm sorry, man. I didn't know.

713
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:45,519
I don't know.

714
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:50,423
She was the best part of me.

715
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:11,235
-All right. Put this helmet on.
-What's this do?

716
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,780
-Whatever you look at, you can shoot.
-Yeah?

717
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:18,918
Targeting eyepiece activated.

718
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,290
This is just like a video game.

719
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,070
I'm gonna make this real simple.

720
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:47,174
You send us the judge,
we'll send you Lester.

721
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:59,577
Start walking.

722
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,349
-Go with God, my brother.
-Always.

723
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,746
-Get him out of here.
-Got her, boss.

724
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,181
-Let's move.
-Go. Go, go, go.

725
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,210
Let's go, boys.

726
01:22:26,007 --> 01:22:29,875
All right, homeys, you did good.

727
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,070
Real good.

728
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:36,974
Now give up your guns,
or two things can happen.

729
01:22:37,152 --> 01:22:40,713
You get killed, or you get caught.

730
01:22:42,157 --> 01:22:43,454
Comprende?

731
01:22:44,192 --> 01:22:49,562
He's right. They kept their word,
now let's keep ours. Let them go.

732
01:23:01,609 --> 01:23:03,634
Comprende this!

733
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,345
Cease fire!

734
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,418
Y'all want some?

735
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,982
We going! Come on, man!

736
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:10,969
God!

737
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:31,590
Cover me!

738
01:24:37,172 --> 01:24:39,231
We got a problem.

739
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,538
Acquiring target.

740
01:24:51,586 --> 01:24:53,315
You mother--

741
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:56,720
-Problem solved.
-You're bad.

742
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:13,467
Yeah. Yeah!

743
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:19,606
-We gotta do something.
-Stay here or jump for that rope.

744
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,043
Either way, we die.

745
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:26,652
I guess we're going for the rope.

746
01:25:30,925 --> 01:25:32,222
Get out of there!

747
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:02,485
Pretty good, 1 1 37.

748
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,784
But not good enough.

749
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:08,789
Drop it!

750
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:10,589
I said, drop it!

751
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:18,031
Oh, hell, yeah!

752
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,510
That's what you get, bitch!

753
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:44,527
Let's see if you got the sack
to finish the job.

754
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:48,461
Don't do it.

755
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:17,393
-I got something--
-Put the gun down. Now.

756
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:24,566
McPherson's in the last cell
on the right.

757
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,172
Come on!

758
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:29,139
We all right.
Everything's good in the 'hood.

759
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:48,221
-Did we get them?
-Yeah, we got them.

760
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:53,830
-I'm gonna miss you, Sasch.
-Don't say that, man.

761
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:56,036
It's a nice night to die.

762
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:59,935
Just hang in there.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

763
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:02,599
Get me the hell out of here.

764
01:28:02,777 --> 01:28:06,338
You just hang in there for me.
You hear?

765
01:28:06,848 --> 01:28:08,679
Sascha.

766
01:28:13,054 --> 01:28:14,885
That's not McPherson.

767
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:22,727
They switched her with one
of the hostages. He still has her.

768
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,999
This is FBI Air Unit
Charlie Bravo 4804...

769
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:29,728
...requesting you follow us
back to San Francisco.

770
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:31,269
We've got company.

771
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:41,045
-Sorry your girlfriend died.
-Casualties of war.

772
01:28:41,215 --> 01:28:45,743
-You're not just a prisoner, are you?
-No, I'm not. Undercover FBl.

773
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:51,449
-You picked the wrong prison.
-Don't get cocky. I got what you want.

774
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:54,626
-I got what you need.
-Don't do it.

775
01:28:54,796 --> 01:28:58,163
Turn that helicopter around
or she goes for a swim.

776
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:02,633
You wanna go for a swim?
I think she wants to go for a swim.

777
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:06,301
Say goodbye.

778
01:32:02,049 --> 01:32:05,678
Almas nalgas, homeboy.
Someone here to see you.

779
01:32:49,297 --> 01:32:51,162
-Talk.
-How you feeling?

780
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:54,200
Eight broken ribs...

781
01:32:54,769 --> 01:32:59,001
...a broken leg, a broken arm.
How'd you think I was feeling?

782
01:32:59,173 --> 01:33:03,439
Well, for the record,
I couldn't have done it without you.

783
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,778
I heard you busted Sonny.

784
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:12,818
That's what I started out to do.
I usually like to finish what I start.

785
01:33:12,987 --> 01:33:15,046
Did you find the gold?

786
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:20,727
-Did you get some for me?
-I got something better.

787
01:33:20,895 --> 01:33:23,591
-What's that?
-I spoke with McPherson.

788
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:26,289
-I had her look at your file.
-And?

789
01:33:26,467 --> 01:33:28,992
She knocked your sentence back.

790
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:31,367
To what?

791
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:35,473
How fast can you get out
of those clothes?

792
01:33:43,784 --> 01:33:47,880
-You better not be playing me.
-You know me. I ain't playing.

793
01:33:48,055 --> 01:33:49,818
You serious?

794
01:33:49,991 --> 01:33:53,154
That's what I'm talking about!

795
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:58,822
Now, Nicholas, do we have issues,
or are we all right?

796
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,128
Hell, no, we ain't all right.

797
01:34:06,774 --> 01:34:08,071
We all right.

798
01:34:29,630 --> 01:34:31,655
-What's up, girl?
-Hey, Twitch.

799
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:36,166
-"Hey"? You don't miss your boo?
-I miss you every day, Twitch.

800
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,932
Dang, girl. Act like it.
After all I've been through.

801
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:44,271
Please believe this. You gotta
believe it. It was cracking!

802
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:48,347
It was down in here. Bullets flying.
I'm ducking bullets.

803
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:51,280
Bad guys die.
I'm a good guy this time.

804
01:34:51,452 --> 01:34:55,411
I'm a hero. I'm big.
I'm getting out soon.

805
01:34:55,589 --> 01:34:58,490
That's real! Me and the warden,
we like this.

806
01:34:58,659 --> 01:35:02,288
Twitch, the warden don't know you.
Your name is Bernard.

807
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:06,160
-Don't talk about that.
-I'm stopping this Twitch mess.

808
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:08,494
You keep hopping the same stuff.

809
01:35:08,669 --> 01:35:12,730
-I'm tired of these fake-ass diamonds.
-They look real to me.

810
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,137
What's more real than Twitch?

811
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:19,541
-What's more real than Twitch Dog?
-Twitch Dog coming home.

812
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,581
I'm coming home.
Put your hand on the glass.

813
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,513
Put your hand on the glass.

814
01:35:24,685 --> 01:35:28,246
-Close your eyes.
-You're aggressive behind glass.

815
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:32,756
Put your hand on the glass.
I want you to close your eyes.

816
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,896
Close your eyes.
I want you to feel me.

817
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:41,228
I'm coming home soon. I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go, okay?

818
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:43,461
-Anywhere?
-Anywhere.

819
01:35:43,637 --> 01:35:47,471
-And I'm gonna buy you anything.
-Anything, Twitch?

820
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:51,077
I met a million-dollar man.
I'm hitting his house.

821
01:35:51,245 --> 01:35:54,146
When you come home,
you be on the up and up.

822
01:35:54,315 --> 01:35:58,547
-Why you wanna hit the man?
-What the hell is you looking at?

823
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:00,448
-Twitch!
-You in my zone!

824
01:36:00,621 --> 01:36:02,919
Bernard, here. See, here.

825
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:07,288
You ain't never seen a lovely lady
before? You ill hustling.

826
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,053
Twitch! Keep it here.

827
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:14,566
Here! Keep it focused. That's why
you're in here. You didn't listen.

828
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:20,173
I'm with you, baby. You know.
I'll be home, now. You wait for me.

829
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:23,867
You remember that time
we was by the beaches?

830
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:27,411
You remember what we used
to do back in the day?

831
01:36:27,581 --> 01:36:29,549
That's what I'm saying!

832
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:33,847
Wiggle it for me. Show me some.
What the hell you looking at?

833
01:36:34,021 --> 01:36:37,980
Do the damn thing. Don't make
me go old school with you.

834
01:36:38,159 --> 01:36:39,421
Do the damn thing.

835
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:42,153
Go ahead, girl.
Make them wiggle.
