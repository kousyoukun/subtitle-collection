00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:09,736
NADJA IN PARlS

2
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,122
<i>I live at the Cité Universitaire,</i>
<i>at the Germany House.</i>

3
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,258
<i>l'm American and  Yugoslavian,</i>

4
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,359
<i>born in Belgrade,</i>
<i>American by adoption.</i>

5
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:43,172
<i>The Cité Universitaire reminds me</i>
<i>of American high schools.</i>

6
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,311
<i>It has the same</i>
<i>relaxed atmosphere.</i>

7
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,371
<i>Another difference.:</i>

8
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,214
<i>There are people here</i>
<i>from all over the world.</i>

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,824
<i>The grass is not off limits,</i>
<i>which is rare in France.</i>

10
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:08,159
<i>You can walk and sit on it.</i>

11
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,706
<i>There's a large park</i>

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,876
<i>with playing fields</i>
<i>and tennis courts.</i>

13
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:32,257
<i>l don't participate in any sport</i>

14
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,316
<i>except for track.</i>

15
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,358
<i>Well, l run.</i>

16
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,276
<i>The trouble is,</i>

17
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,174
<i>we're so comfortable here,</i>
<i>we don't want to leave.</i>

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,407
<i>Everything I need</i>
<i>for work or play</i>

19
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,086
<i>can be found right here.</i>

20
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:16,566
<i>Entertainment abounds,</i>
<i>such as concerts</i>

21
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,703
<i>and films.</i>

22
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,864
<i>Each house has its</i>
<i>own theater troupe.</i>

23
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,109
<i>This one is rehearsing a play</i>
<i>by Lope de Vega.</i>

24
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:36,744
I told you to wait
until he finished his line.

25
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:44,523
<i>The Latin Quarter</i>
<i>is five minutes away by subway.</i>

26
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:47,291
<i>I'm writing a thesis on Proust.</i>

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,095
<i>That's the official reason</i>
<i>for my stay in Paris.</i>

28
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:57,436
<i>It allows me the freedom</i>
<i>to organize my time as l wish.</i>

29
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,373
<i>Actually,</i>
<i>my visits to the Sorbonne</i>

30
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,241
<i>are short and infrequent.</i>

31
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,323
<i>Before returning</i>
<i>to the Cité Universitaire,</i>

32
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,788
<i>I like to stroll</i>
<i>through the Left Bank,</i>

33
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,190
<i>full of antique shops</i>
<i>and bookstores.</i>

34
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:30,709
<i>What amazes me in France</i>
<i>are the open-air book displays.</i>

35
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:35,178
<i>You can browse freely</i>

36
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,077
<i>without anyone bothering you.</i>

37
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:56,226
<i>Then I sit at a table</i>
<i>outside a café.</i>

38
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,936
<i>The French love</i>
<i>to linger here for hours.</i>

39
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,670
<i>I stay only for a while.</i>

40
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,009
- Is this what you ordered?
- Yes, thank you.

41
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,215
<i>I have no specific aim.</i>
<i>I just sit.</i>

42
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:27,391
<i>I'm not waiting for anyone.</i>
<i>I simply want to be there.</i>

43
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,329
<i>I don't read. I observe.</i>

44
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,405
<i>I observe the street,</i>

45
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,200
<i>the way people walk,</i>

46
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,707
<i>the way they look at things.</i>

47
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:53,483
<i>I know</i>
<i>Saint-Germain-des-Prés well.</i>

48
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,029
<i>It's the neighborhood</i>
<i>that first caught my eye</i>

49
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:03,202
<i>when I arrived in France.</i>

50
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:11,700
<i>I suppose it's become gentrified</i>
<i>since Juliette Greco's day,</i>

51
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:15,608
<i>but you see an interesting</i>
<i>mix of faces there.</i>

52
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,384
<i>I feel more at ease</i>
<i>in Montparnasse.</i>

53
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:28,156
<i>The place is nothing special,</i>
<i>but it's a nice crowd.</i>

54
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,303
<i>People come here to talk,</i>

55
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,471
<i>not to see and be seen.</i>

56
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,436
<i>A certain intimacy</i>
<i>is quickly established.</i>

57
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:47,807
<i>I've made a lot of friends here</i>
<i>among the bohemians, painters,</i>

58
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,506
<i>and writers,</i>
<i>both Parisian and foreign.</i>

59
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,980
<i>It's easy to talk the night away.</i>

60
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,387
<i>The people I spend time with here</i>
<i>are usually older than me</i>

61
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,620
<i>and unconcerned</i>
<i>with the petty worries of student life.</i>

62
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,631
<i>It was they</i>
<i>who introduced me to modern art.</i>

63
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:13,228
<i>For me, who never made it</i>
<i>past Picasso's Blue Period,</i>

64
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,597
<i>it's a bit overwhelming.</i>

65
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:18,709
<i>I'm intrigued by all the theories,</i>

66
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:22,711
<i>but in the end,</i>
<i>they don't really influence me.</i>

67
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,914
<i>I head straight for what I like,</i>

68
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,280
<i>leaving the rest to other people.</i>

69
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:54,808
<i>Some things I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever be able to take seriously.</i>

70
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,151
<i>But all these people in Saint-Germain</i>
<i>and Montparnasse,</i>

71
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:13,889
<i>no matter how different</i>
<i>they may be,</i>

72
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,660
<i>belong to the same world.</i>

73
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,869
<i>I often feel the need</i>
<i>to get away from them</i>

74
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,509
<i>and escape the narrow confines</i>
<i>of Intellectual Paris.</i>

75
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:37,545
<i>I knew there was a park</i>
<i>at the far end of Paris.</i>

76
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:46,755
<i>I went there one day on my own,</i>
<i>and I return from time to time.</i>

77
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,934
<i>It's the Buttes-Chaumont.</i>

78
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,936
<i>I like this place</i>
<i>because it's empty and wild.</i>

79
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,978
<i>I know the streams are man-made</i>

80
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,172
<i>and the rocks are cement,</i>

81
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,317
<i>but it doesn't matter.</i>

82
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:24,101
<i>Nearby is the working-class</i>
<i>neighborhood of Belleville.</i>

83
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:28,866
<i>I've begun to explore it,</i>
<i>spending entire days there at a time.</i>

84
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:36,143
<i>When I'm hungry,</i>
<i>I head for a pastry shop.</i>

85
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,915
I'd like that one.

86
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,448
What's it called?

87
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,355
A <i>briwat.</i>

88
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:51,726
- How much?
- Sixty cents.

89
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,331
<i>One thing that's always surprised me</i>
<i>about the French</i>

90
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,934
<i>is the importance</i>
<i>they attach to food.</i>

91
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,170
<i>At noon, you must eat.</i>

92
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:08,970
<i>Once I heard a student spend</i>
<i>five minutes describing to a friend</i>

93
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:15,245
<i>the incredible steak he'd had</i>
<i>in a restaurant the night before.</i>

94
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,920
<i>I'm drawn to the outdoor markets.</i>

95
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,858
<i>You usually only see</i>
<i>the elderly there.</i>

96
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,267
<i>This part of Paris</i>
<i>is looked down upon</i>

97
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,464
<i>because it lacks historical interest.</i>

98
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:40,442
<i>I like its peeling signs,</i>

99
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,137
<i>its small, tree-filled squares.</i>

100
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,137
<i>This old lady comes here</i>
<i>every day at the same time</i>

101
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:16,247
<i>to sit on the same bench</i>
<i>and read a tattered newspaper</i>

102
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,576
<i>retrieved from a garbage can.</i>

103
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,154
A glass of red.

104
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,746
That's no good.
Bad for the liver.

105
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:54,381
You shouldn't drink it.
- I'm used to it.

106
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,247
lt doesn't bother me either.

107
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,127
<i>Sometimes a sudden storm</i>
<i>keeps me from leaving.</i>

108
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:23,511
Come on, it's legit.
My wife and kids will be there.

109
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:26,844
You don't work on Sundays.
- lt's on Sunday?

110
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,248
I live close by.
I've got a car.

111
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,313
It'll be fun.

112
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,023
Will you come?

113
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,163
<i>People know I'm a foreigner here,</i>

114
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,526
<i>but they accept me.</i>

115
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,997
<i>They don't see me</i>
<i>as an outsider.</i>

116
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,500
<i>I discovered</i>
<i>a world without problems,</i>

117
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,273
<i>a simpler world,</i>
<i>more typically French.</i>

118
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,882
<i>It really helped me</i>

119
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:04,022
<i>let go of the superficial things</i>
<i>in my life.</i>

120
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,402
<i>What typifies Paris</i>

121
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,005
<i>is its endless variety.</i>

122
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,403
<i>You can easily slip</i>
<i>from one milieu to another.</i>

123
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,009
<i>It's a city that's truly open,</i>

124
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,478
<i>where you end up learning more about</i>
<i>yourself than you learn about the city.</i>

125
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:34,616
<i>I don't intend to stay, of course.</i>

126
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,519
<i>But I hope</i>
<i>I never lose touch with Paris.</i>

127
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,188
<i>My stay here</i>
<i>will leave its mark on me.</i>

128
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,496
<i>That's not surprising,</i>
<i>because this just might be</i>

129
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,439
<i>the most important period</i>
<i>in one's life,</i>

130
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,508
<i>when one shakes off</i>
<i>past influences</i>

131
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,541
<i>and one's true personality is formed.</i>
