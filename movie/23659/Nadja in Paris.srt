00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,500
NADJA IN PARIS

2
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,800
I live at the Cité Universitaire,
at the Germany House.

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm American and Yugoslavian,

4
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,100
born in Belgrade,
American by adoption.

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,900
The Cité Universitaire reminds me
of American high schools.

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,000
It has the same
relaxed atmosphere.

7
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,100
Another difference:

8
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,900
There are people here
from all over the world.

9
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,500
The grass is not off limits,
which is rare in France.

10
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,900
You can walk and sit on it.

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,400
There's a large park

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
with playing fields
and tennis courts.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't participate in any sport

14
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,000
except for track.

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,100
Well, I run.

16
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,000
The trouble is,

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,900
we're so comfortable here,
we don't want to leave.

18
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,100
Everything I need
for work or play

19
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,800
can be found right here.

20
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,300
Entertainment abounds,
such as concerts

21
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,400
and films.

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,600
Each house has its
own theater troupe.

23
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,800
This one is rehearsing a play
by Lope de Vega.

24
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I told you to wait
until he finished his line.

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,200
The Latin Quarter
is five minutes away by subway.

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm writing a thesis on Proust.

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,800
That's the official reason
for my stay in Paris.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,200
It allows me the freedom
to organize my time as I wish.

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,100
Actually,
my visits to the Sorbonne

30
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,000
are short and infrequent.

31
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,000
Before returning
to the Cité Universitaire,

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,500
I like to stroll
through the Left Bank,

33
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,900
full of antique shops
and bookstores.

34
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,400
What amazes me in France
are the open-air book displays.

35
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,900
You can browse freely

36
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,800
without anyone bothering you.

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,900
Then I sit at a table
outside a café.

38
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,700
The French love
to linger here for hours.

39
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,400
I stay only for a while.

40
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,700
- Is this what you ordered?
- Yes, thank you.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,900
I have no specific aim.
I just sit.

42
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,100
I'm not waiting for anyone.
I simply want to be there.

43
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't read. I observe.

44
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,100
I observe the street,

45
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,900
the way people walk,

46
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,400
the way they look at things.

47
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,200
I know
Saint-Germain-des-Prés well.

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,700
It's the neighborhood
that first caught my eye

49
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,900
when I arrived in France.

50
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,400
I suppose it's become gentrified
since Juliette Greco's day,

51
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,300
but you see an interesting
mix of faces there.

52
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,100
I feel more at ease
in Montparnasse.

53
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,900
The place is nothing special,
but it's a nice crowd.

54
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,000
People come here to talk,

55
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
not to see and be seen.

56
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,200
A certain intimacy
is quickly established.

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,500
I've made a lot of friends here
among the bohemians, painters,

58
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,200
and writers,
both Parisian and foreign.

59
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,700
It's easy to talk the night away.

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,100
The people I spend time with here
are usually older than me

61
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,300
and unconcerned
with the petty worries of student life.

62
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,300
It was they
who introduced me to modern art.

63
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,900
For me, who never made it
past Picasso's Blue Period,

64
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
it's a bit overwhelming.

65
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm intrigued by all the theories,

66
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,400
but in the end,
they don't really influence me.

67
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,600
I head straight for what I like,

68
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,000
leaving the rest to other people.

69
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,500
Some things I don't think
I'll ever be able to take seriously.

70
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,900
But all these people in Saint-Germain
and Montparnasse,

71
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
no matter how different
they may be,

72
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,400
belong to the same world.

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,600
I often feel the need
to get away from them

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,200
and escape the narrow confines
of Intellectual Paris.

75
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,300
I knew there was a park
at the far end of Paris.

76
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I went there one day on my own,
and I return from time to time.

77
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,700
It's the Buttes-Chaumont.

78
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,700
I like this place
because it's empty and wild.

79
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,700
I know the streams are man-made

80
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
and the rocks are cement,

81
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,000
but it doesn't matter.

82
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,800
Nearby is the working-class
neighborhood of Belleville.

83
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,600
I've begun to explore it,
spending entire days there at a time.

84
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,900
When I'm hungry,
I head for a pastry shop.

85
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,600
I'd like that one.

86
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,200
What's it called?

87
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,100
A briwat.

88
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,400
- How much?
- Sixty cents.

89
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
One thing that's always surprised me
about the French

90
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,700
is the importance
they attach to food.

91
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,900
At noon, you must eat.

92
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,700
Once I heard a student spend
five minutes describing to a friend

93
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,000
the incredible steak he'd had
in a restaurant the night before.

94
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm drawn to the outdoor markets.

95
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,600
You usually only see
the elderly there.

96
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,000
This part of Paris
is looked down upon

97
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
because it lacks historical interest.

98
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,200
I like its peeling signs,

99
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,900
its small, tree-filled squares.

100
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,900
This old lady comes here
every day at the same time

101
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,000
to sit on the same bench
and read a tattered newspaper

102
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
retrieved from a garbage can.

103
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
A glass of red.

104
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,500
That's no good.
Bad for the liver.

105
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,100
You shouldn't drink it.
- I'm used to it.

106
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,000
It doesn't bother me either.

107
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,800
Sometimes a sudden storm
keeps me from leaving.

108
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,200
Come on, it's legit.
My wife and kids will be there.

109
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,600
You don't work on Sundays.
- It's on Sunday?

110
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,000
I live close by.
I've got a car.

111
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It'll be fun.

112
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Will you come?

113
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,900
People know I'm a foreigner here,

114
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
but they accept me.

115
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,700
They don't see me
as an outsider.

116
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,200
I discovered
a world without problems,

117
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,000
a simpler world,
more typically French.

118
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,600
It really helped me

119
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,700
let go of the superficial things
in my life.

120
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,100
What typifies Paris

121
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,700
is its endless variety.

122
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,100
You can easily slip
from one milieu to another.

123
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,700
It's a city that's truly open,

124
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,200
where you end up learning more about
yourself than you learn about the city.

125
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,300
I don't intend to stay, of course.

126
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,200
But I hope
I never lose touch with Paris.

127
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,900
My stay here
will leave its mark on me.

128
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,200
That's not surprising,
because this just might be

129
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,200
the most important period
in one's life,

130
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,200
when one shakes off
past influences

131
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,300
and one's true personality is formed.
