00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,029
<i>I live at the Cité Universitaire,
at the Germany House.</i>

5
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,327
<i>I'm American and Yugoslavian,</i>

6
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,415
<i>born in Belgrade,
American by adoption.</i>

7
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:43,253
<i>The Cité Universitaire reminds me
of American high schools.</i>

8
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:46,381
<i>It has the same
relaxed atmosphere.</i>

9
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,343
<i>Another difference:</i>

10
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:53,596
<i>There are people here
from all over the world.</i>

11
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:04,899
<i>The grass is not off limits,
which is rare in France.</i>

12
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:08,153
<i>You can walk and sit on it.</i>

13
00:01:10,363 --> 00:01:13,783
<i>The grounds are extensive,</i>

14
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,911
<i>with playing fields
and tennis courts.</i>

15
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,385
<i>I don't participate in any sport</i>

16
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,429
<i>except for track.</i>

17
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:36,473
<i>Well, I run.</i>

18
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:51,446
<i>The trouble is...</i>

19
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,491
<i>we're so comfortable here,
we don't want to leave.</i>

20
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:58,536
<i>Everything I need for work or play</i>

21
00:01:59,037 --> 00:02:01,206
<i>can be found right here.</i>

22
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:16,638
<i>Entertainment abounds,
such as concerts</i>

23
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,807
<i>and films.</i>

24
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:23,978
<i>Each house has
its own theater troupe.</i>

25
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:28,149
<i>This one is rehearsing a play
by Lope de Vega.</i>

26
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,866
I told you to wait
until he finished his line.

27
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:44,666
<i>The Latin Quarter
is five minutes away by subway.</i>

28
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,418
<i>I'm writing a thesis on Proust.</i>

29
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:51,130
<i>That's the official reason
for my stay in France.</i>

30
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:57,470
<i>It allows me the freedom
to organize my time as I wish.</i>

31
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,350
<i>Actually, my visits to the Sorbonne
are short and infrequent.</i>

32
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:11,401
<i>Before returning
to the Cité Universitaire,</i>

33
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:13,903
<i>I like to stroll
through the Left Bank,</i>

34
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,282
<i>full of antique shops
and bookstores.</i>

35
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:30,837
<i>What amazes me in France
are the open-air book displays.</i>

36
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,258
<i>You can browse freely</i>

37
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:38,219
<i>without anyone bothering you.</i>

38
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:56,362
<i>Then I sit at a table
outside a café.</i>

39
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,078
<i>The French love
to linger here for hours.</i>

40
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,540
<i>I stay only for a while.</i>

41
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:14,881
- Is this what you ordered?
- Yes, thank you.

42
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,509
<i>I have no specific aim.</i>

43
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,345
<i>I just sit.</i>

44
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,393
<i>I'm not waiting for anyone.
I simply want to be there.</i>

45
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:30,438
<i>I don't read. I observe.</i>

46
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:33,524
<i>I observe the street,</i>

47
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,194
<i>the way people walk,</i>

48
00:04:36,486 --> 00:04:38,821
<i>the way they look at things.</i>

49
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,628
<i>I know
Saint-Germain-des-Prés well.</i>

50
00:04:56,798 --> 00:05:00,134
<i>It's the neighborhood
that first caught my eye</i>

51
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,304
<i>when I arrived in France.</i>

52
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,813
<i>I suppose it's become gentrified
since Juliette Greco's day,</i>

53
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,733
<i>but you see
an interesting mix of faces there.</i>

54
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:23,491
<i>I feel more at ease
in Montparnasse.</i>

55
00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:28,496
<i>The place is nothing special,
but it's a nice crowd.</i>

56
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,380
<i>People come here to talk,</i>

57
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,757
<i>not to see and be seen.</i>

58
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:42,844
<i>A certain intimacy
is quickly established.</i>

59
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:47,932
<i>I've made a lot of friends here
among the bohemians, painters,</i>

60
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:51,644
<i>and writers,
both Parisian and foreign.</i>

61
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:56,107
<i>It's easy to talk the night away.</i>

62
00:05:56,274 --> 00:06:00,528
<i>The people I spend time with here
are usually older than me</i>

63
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:04,615
<i>and unconcerned
with the petty worries of student life.</i>

64
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,745
<i>It was they
who introduced me to modern art.</i>

65
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:13,374
<i>For me, who never made it
past Picasso's Blue Period,</i>

66
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,710
<i>it's a bit overwhelming.</i>

67
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:18,713
<i>I'm intrigued by all the theories,</i>

68
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:22,800
<i>but in the end,
they don't really influence me.</i>

69
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:26,054
<i>I head straight for what I like,</i>

70
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,681
<i>leaving the rest to others.</i>

71
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:54,916
<i>Some things I don't think
I'll ever be able to take seriously.</i>

72
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:11,265
<i>But all these people in Saint-Germain
and Montparnasse,</i>

73
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:14,018
<i>no matter how different
they may be,</i>

74
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:16,771
<i>belong to the same world.</i>

75
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:24,987
<i>I often feel the need
to get away from them</i>

76
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,617
<i>and escape the narrow confines
of Intellectual Paris.</i>

77
00:07:33,663 --> 00:07:37,667
<i>I knew there was a park
at the far end of Paris.</i>

78
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:46,843
<i>I went there one day on my own,
and I return from time to time.</i>

79
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:48,970
<i>It's the Buttes-Chaumont.</i>

80
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:54,058
<i>I like this place
because it's empty and wild.</i>

81
00:07:59,147 --> 00:08:02,150
<i>I know the streams are man-made</i>

82
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,318
<i>and the rocks are cement,</i>

83
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:06,445
<i>but it doesn't matter.</i>

84
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:24,213
<i>Nearby is the working-class
neighborhood of Belleville.</i>

85
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,968
<i>I've begun to explore it,
spending entire days there at a time.</i>

86
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,267
<i>When I'm hungry,
I head for a pastry shop.</i>

87
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:40,021
I'd like that one.

88
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,566
What's it called?

89
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,486
A <i>briwat.</i>

90
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,866
- How much?
- Sixty cents.

91
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,452
<i>One thing that's always surprised me
about the French</i>

92
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,038
<i>is the importance
they attach to food.</i>

93
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,292
<i>At noon, you must eat.</i>

94
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:09,050
<i>Once I heard a student spend
five minutes describing to a friend</i>

95
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:15,389
<i>the incredible steak he'd had
in a restaurant the night before.</i>

96
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,062
<i>I'm drawn to the outdoor markets.</i>

97
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:24,899
<i>You usually only see
the elderly there.</i>

98
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:34,367
<i>This part of Paris
is looked down upon</i>

99
00:09:34,492 --> 00:09:36,744
<i>because it lacks historical interest.</i>

100
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,539
<i>I like its peeling signs,</i>

101
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:43,251
<i>its small, tree-filled squares.</i>

102
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,279
<i>This old lady comes here
every day at the same time</i>

103
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:16,200
<i>to sit on the same bench
and read a tattered newspaper</i>

104
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,619
<i>retrieved from a garbage can.</i>

105
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,298
A glass of red.

106
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,860
That's no good.
Bad for the liver.

107
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:54,488
You shouldn't drink it.
- I'm used to it.

108
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,368
It doesn't bother me either.

109
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:09,253
<i>Sometimes a sudden storm
keeps me from leaving.</i>

110
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:23,642
Come on, it's legit.
My wife and kids will be there.

111
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:26,979
You don't work on Sundays.
- It's on Sunday?

112
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,357
I live close by. I've got a car.

113
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:32,360
It'll be fun.

114
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:35,154
Will you come?

115
00:11:37,365 --> 00:11:39,200
<i>People know I'm a foreigner here,</i>

116
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,619
<i>but they accept me.</i>

117
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,122
<i>They don't see me as an outsider.</i>

118
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:52,588
<i>I discovered
a world without problems,</i>

119
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:56,384
<i>a simpler world,
more typically French.</i>

120
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,221
<i>It really helped me let go</i>

121
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:04,058
<i>of the superficial things in my life.</i>

122
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,488
<i>What typifies Paris</i>

123
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,116
<i>is its endless variety.</i>

124
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,536
<i>You can easily slip
from one milieu to another.</i>

125
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,122
<i>It's a city that's truly open,</i>

126
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:30,584
<i>where you end up learning more about
yourself than you learn about the city.</i>

127
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,755
<i>I don't intend to stay, of course.</i>

128
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,634
<i>But I hope
I never lose touch with Paris.</i>

129
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:46,308
<i>My stay here
will leave its mark on me.</i>

130
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:52,606
<i>That's not surprising,
because this just might be</i>

131
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,568
<i>the most important period
in one's life,</i>

132
00:12:55,734 --> 00:12:58,612
<i>when one shakes off
past influences...</i>

133
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:02,658
<i>and one's true personality is formed.</i>
