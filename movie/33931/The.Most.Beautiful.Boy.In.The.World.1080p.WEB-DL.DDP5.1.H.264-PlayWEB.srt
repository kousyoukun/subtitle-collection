1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,280
一天，小秋正在睡觉。
One day, Pelle was sleeping.

2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,200
实际上，天很黑。
It was actually dark.

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,560
但是父亲不在那里。
But Father wasn't there.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,280
于是他走到妈妈的床前。
So he went over to Mother's bed.

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,640
但是妈妈也不在那里。
But Mother wasn't there either.

6
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,320
妈妈和爸爸在哪里?
Where are Mother and Father?

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
——妈妈!——来到这里。
- Mummy! - Come here.

8
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,960
这是你对着它说话的方式Björn。像这样。
This is how you speak into it, Björn. Like this.

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,320
你会说“妈妈”吗?说“妈妈”。
Can you say "Mummy"? Say "Mummy".

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,600
不，你把花糟蹋了。
No, you're spoiling the flower.

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,280
不，不，你不能玩它!
No, no - you're not to play with it!

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,120
再见，现在去睡觉吧。
Goodbye - off to bed now.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,640
1962年11月16日。
It's 16 November, 1962.

14
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,280
——你好吗?——嗨,Bjorn !
- Hello? - Hi, Björn!

15
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,640
你好吗，亲爱的?
How are you, sweetheart?

16
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,280
-也没那么好。——不是吗?
- Well, not all that good. - Aren't you?

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
-妈妈在家吗?——没有。
- Is Mum home? - No.

18
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,960
那是1970年2月一个阴冷刺骨的日子。
It's a bitter cold gloomy February day in 1970.

19
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,840
电影导演卢奇诺·维斯康蒂正在去斯德哥尔摩的路上。
The film director Luchino Visconti is on his way to Stockholm.

20
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
电影界最杰出的人物之一，
One of cinema's most outstanding figures,

21
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
他的艺术和血统都很有名。
he's known both for his artistry and his lineage.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
他是意大利北部的贵族。他是共产主义者，但他有仆人。
He's from the nobility of northern Italy. He's a Communist, yet he has servants.

23
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,680
而且他是公开的同性恋。
And he's openly gay.

24
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
维斯康蒂出来了，追求纯粹的美
Visconti is out, seeking pure beauty -

25
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,240
一个将在他的新电影中扮演主角的男孩身上有完美的美。
perfect beauty in a boy who is to play the lead in his new film.

26
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,640
我看不见他的眼睛。它们是什么颜色的?
I can't see his eyes. What colour are they?

27
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,920
看这里。
Look over here.

28
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
绿色的。
Green.

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,120
他看起来很可爱——一张漂亮的脸。
He looks lovely - a beautiful face.

30
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,720
告诉他拍些照片。
Tell him to take some pictures.

31
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,360
多年来，他一直在旅行，在匈牙利，波兰，芬兰，俄罗斯寻找。
For years, he's travelled, searching - in Hungary, Poland, Finland, Russia.

32
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
在斯德哥尔摩大Hôtel旁边的一间大公寓里
In a large apartment next to the Grand Hôtel in Stockholm

33
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,200
一群男孩聚在一起，满心期待。
a group of boys have gathered, full of anticipation.

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,920
他是个童星。-他是个童星，是吗?
- He is a child actor. - A child actor, is he?

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
你见过你觉得有用的人吗?
Have you seen anyone you think might work?

36
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,000
不,还没有。有些很不错，但我们还没找到靶心。
No, not yet. Some are really sweet, but we've not got a bullseye yet.

37
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,920
门就要开了。
The door is about to open.

38
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,360
一个男孩站在门后，还不知道
A boy, stood behind the door, doesn't yet know

39
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,560
他的整个人生都将改变。
that his entire life is about to change.

40
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,480
他的脸将成为全世界的偶像。
His face is to become an icon - all over the world.

41
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,880
他多大了?年长的,对吧?
How old is he? Older, right?

42
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,240
-是的，有一点。他是15。——大。15 ?非常漂亮。把你的头。
- Yes, a little. He's 15. - Big. 15? Very beautiful. Turn your head.

43
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,920
在概要文件。
In profile.

44
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,760
-他在这张照片里很漂亮。-你带照片了吗?
- He's very beautiful in this photo. - Did you bring any photographs?

45
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,520
不。
No.

46
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,480
你能绕着房间走一圈吗?
Can you walk round the room in a circle?

47
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,400
他是该死的高。
He's damn tall.

48
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,880
——漂亮!让他脱衣服。-你能赤裸上身吗?
- Beautiful! Ask him to undress. - Could you bare your torso?

49
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,120
——什么?-你能赤裸上身吗?
- What? - Can you bare your torso?

50
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
-所以你是半裸的——半裸的?
- So you're half-naked. - Half-naked?

51
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,880
-也看着摄像机。-看着镜头笑一笑。
- Look into the camera, too. - Look into the camera and smile a little.

52
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,600
-很漂亮…-四处走走。
- Very beautiful... - Walk around a bit.

53
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,880
让他停下来。拍一个大特写，非常近!
Ask him to stop. Get a big close-up, really tight!

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,760
转到相机。
Turn to camera.

55
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,840
非常非常接近。四分之三，不是全脸。
Very, very close. Three-quarter shot, not full face.

56
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,600
-对着镜头微笑。-对着镜头微笑。
- Smile into the camera. - Look into the camera and smile.

57
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,560
-你笑起来真可爱!——谢谢。我们需要拍照。
- You have a lovely smile! - Thank you. We need to take pictures.

58
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,760
马里奥!我们也来拍特写吧
Mario! Let's take close-ups, too -

59
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,600
左右侧影，他的脸，和完整的，赤裸的躯干。
profile right and left, his face, and full on, with naked torso.

60
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
他有一张漂亮的脸。
He has a beautiful face.

61
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,120
欢迎来到租户协会。你将有三个选择。
Welcome to Tenants' Association. You'll be given three options.

62
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,920
选择最适合你需要的。
Choose the one that best suits your needs.

63
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,240
我需要法律建议。
Well, I need legal advice.

64
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,800
我该怎么办?我对这些东西一无所知。
What do I do? I know nothing about this stuff.

65
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,120
解释一下发生了什么，你需要什么帮助，
Explain what's happened and what you need assistance with,

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,320
我会尽我所能帮你
and I'll do what I can to help.

67
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,720
你可以说我受到了驱逐的威胁…
You could say I'm being threatened with eviction...

68
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,880
-…合同终止。——正确的。
- ...with termination of contract. - Right.

69
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,120
在房东的信Björn中，
In the landlord's letter, Björn,

70
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,840
上面说你对其他房客构成了威胁，因为你没关煤气炉。
it says that you're a danger to other tenants, since you left the gas stove on.

71
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,600
——这是废话!-当然，但你看这里…
- That's bullshit! - Sure, but look here...

72
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,120
-我不是粗心。我每次都检查!-但这都是她担心的
- I am not careless. I check it every time! - But it's all part of her concern.

73
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,360
因为一个肮脏的厨房风扇…
Because a filthy kitchen fan...

74
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,280
-…被油覆盖，很容易着火。-我知道。
- ...covered in oil, can easily catch fire. - I realise that.

75
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,520
这就是为什么你是个危险人物。你必须保持它的清洁。
That is why you are a danger. You have to keep it clean.

76
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,240
现在的问题是解释你为什么躺在床上，
Now, it's a matter of explaining why you were lying on the bed,

77
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,840
煤气灶开着。因为她知道。
with the gas burner on. Because she knows that.

78
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,240
为什么你不在家的时候煤气灶是开着的。
And why the gas burner is on when you are not at home.

79
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,040
你的羽绒被……我把它…
Your duvet... I lifted it...

80
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,520
当我把它举起来的时候，它就解体了。
And while I held it up it just disintegrated.

81
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,840
它只是坍塌成小小的泡沫橡胶碎片
It just collapsed into little foam rubber fragments

82
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,080
老的，恶心的，我不知道是什么。
of old, disgusting, I don't know what.

83
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,520
等待……我这里还有个枕头。看!
Wait... I still have a pillow here. Look!

84
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,680
在这下面。看!
Underneath here. Look!

85
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,640
虫子就靠这个为生。这太令人恶心了。可怕的!
Bugs have been feeding on this. It's so bloody revolting. Horrible!

86
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,880
在它下面有一层这么厚的…
And under it there was a layer this thick...

87
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,880
我甚至不知道…纯粹的污秽。
I don't even know what... Pure filth.

88
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,280
它看起来像便便……
It looks like poo...

89
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,200
地毯甲虫或类似的恶心虫子
...from carpet beetles or revolting bugs like that.

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,800
该死的恶心!
Bloody disgusting!

91
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,640
-我的家对环境有害。——正确的。
- My home's an environmental hazard. - Right.

92
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
这是真的。
It's true.

93
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
“旋风”。我的标题是什么意思?
"Cyclone". What did I mean by that title?

94
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,520
哇…!
Wow...!

95
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,400
我逃离了丹麦那所可怕的寄宿学校
I had run away from this ghastly boarding school in Denmark

96
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,640
去了斯德哥尔摩，去了我的外祖父母那里。
and got to Stockholm, to my maternal grandparents.

97
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,520
我没有父母，真的。
I didn't have any parents, really.

98
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,680
这些都是奶奶照看的。
It was Granny that saw to all this stuff.

99
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,400
她把我的名字写下来做各种各样的事。
She put my name down for all sorts of things.

100
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,560
我不知道，我想我只是顺其自然。
I don't know - I suppose I just went along with it all.

101
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,520
她想要一个名人给她的孙子。
She wanted a celebrity for a grandchild.

102
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,560
我唯一确定的就是我想演奏音乐。
And all I was certain about was that I wanted to play music.

103
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,640
我真的不知道这一切有多大。
I didn't really have any concept of how big this all was.

104
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,760
当然，出国是件好事，
It was, of course, great to go abroad,

105
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,960
去一个我从未去过的国家
to a country I'd never been to,

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
做一些很酷的课外作业。
to do some kind of cool extra school-holiday work.

107
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,160
Ecco -稍微多一点…
Ecco - a little bit more...

108
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
请安静!
Quiet, please!

109
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,000
塔齐奥——那个漂亮的男孩雕像——
Tadzio - that beautiful sculpture of a boy -

110
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,680
由15岁的瑞典男孩Björn Andrésen扮演。
is played by Björn Andrésen, a 15-year-old Swedish boy.

111
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
当你开始找的时候，你知道自己要找什么吗?
Did you know exactly what you were after when you started looking?

112
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,600
是的,正是如此。就像他。
Yes, exactly that. Just like him.

113
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,520
-就像你有照片一样?——是的。他是我试过的第六个男孩。
- As if you'd had a photograph? - Yes. He was the sixth boy I'd tried.

114
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,880
我立刻意识到。
I knew immediately.

115
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,880
他金发碧眼，轮廓完美，灰色的眼睛。你能看见他灰色的眼睛吗?
He is blond, with a perfect profile and grey eyes. Can you see his grey eyes?

116
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,440
正如曼先生所写的，“水的颜色”。就像这双眼睛的颜色。
"The colour of water", as Mr Mann wrote. Just like the colour of these eyes.

117
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,760
他应该像雕像一样冷酷。他理解这个角色。他是完美的。
He's to be as cold as a statue. He's understood the part. He's perfect.

118
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,160
不会有陷入性行为的风险。那将是一个严重的错误。
There's no risk of slipping into sexuality. That would amount to a serious fault.

119
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,280
我正站在维斯康蒂旁边，这时一个金发男孩出现了。
I was standing next to Visconti, when this blond boy turned up.

120
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,360
这是显而易见的
It was plain to see

121
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,920
维斯康蒂的整个身体都活了过来
that Visconti's whole body came to life.

122
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,920
这个男孩长得非常漂亮，长着一张真正上镜的脸。
The boy was exquisitely beautiful, with a truly photogenic face.

123
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,400
他真是个难得的人才。
He was a real find.

124
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,880
他是一个有着特殊魅力的男孩。
He was a boy with a very special charisma.

125
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,280
他似乎脆弱。
He seems frail.

126
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
这在电影里真的很美。
And that's really beautiful in a film.

127
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,040
跟那样的孩子打交道你得非常小心。
You need to be very careful dealing with children like that.

128
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,040
《威尼斯之死》的故事发生在威尼斯附近丽都岛的一家经典酒店里:
"Death in Venice" is set at a classic hotel on the Lido, an island off Venice:

129
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
大Hôtel des Bains。
the Grand Hôtel des Bains.

130
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,880
这个故事是托马斯·曼写的，维斯康蒂多年来一直在琢磨。
The story, written by Thomas Mann, had preoccupied Visconti for years.

131
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,160
在这个古老的酒店里，他创造了一个世纪之交的完美环境。
With the ancient hotel, he creates a perfect turn-of-the-century setting.

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,800
对维斯康蒂来说，《威尼斯之死》是一个深刻的个人故事。
To Visconti, "Death in Venice" is a deeply personal narrative.

133
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,000
奶奶也来到了威尼斯。
Granny came along to Venice.

134
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,280
她带了一台超级8的电影摄像机，当然，她拍下了一切。
She'd brought a Super 8 cine camera and, of course, she shot everything.

135
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,800
维斯康蒂给了她一个小角色，这使她很高兴。
Visconti gave her a small part, which pleased her no end.

136
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,920
我还有一个家庭教师——米里亚姆。
I also had a governess - Miriam.

137
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
她注定要帮助我做功课。
She was meant to help me with my schoolwork.

138
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
你就像我的弟弟。
You were like a younger brother.

139
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,520
我本应该保护他们不受这个新世界的伤害，对我来说也是全新的。
whom I was supposed to protect against this new world, new to me as well.

140
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,960
这是我的工作，合同上写的。
That was my job, as stated in my contract.

141
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,880
我发现这很难。
I found it pretty hard going.

142
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,960
有人提到维斯康蒂发布了一个命令。
Someone mentioned that Visconti had issued an order.

143
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,280
记住，所有船员都是同性恋。
Remember, the whole crew were homosexuals.

144
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,880
命令任何人都不许看小塔齐奥。
An order that no one was as much as to to look at little Tadzio.

145
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,080
不知不觉中，我在某种意义上被“那个人”保护着。
Without my being aware of it, I was in a sense being protected by "the man".

146
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,360
这是一个爱情故事，一个纯洁的故事。
It's a love story, one that's pure.

147
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,160
既不是性的，也不是情色的。
It's neither sexual nor erotic.

148
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
这是一种更高层次的爱。比方说……
It's a higher form of love. Let's say...

149
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,880
-爱中的完美。-我想是在找制作人…
- Perfection within love. - I imagine, looking for producers...

150
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,640
一个上了年纪的作曲家和一个青春期男孩之间的爱情故事…
The story of the love between an aging composer and an adolescent boy...

151
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,240
-那可能会引起某些问题。——它了。
- That might cause certain problems. - It did.

152
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,760
有个制片人特别想找个女孩来代替塔齐奥。
One producer in particular wanted to cast a girl, to replace Tadzio.

153
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,960
“不,”我说,
"No," I said,

154
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,440
“我拒绝有一个塔齐亚。”它不符合作者的意图，对吧?
"I refuse to have a Tadzia." It wouldn't keep to the author's message, right?

155
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:19,960
你被用来阐述一个完全不是你的故事的故事。
You were to be used to illustrate a story that was in no way your story.

156
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,590
人们有点害怕维斯康蒂。他是个非常……
People were a bit scared of Visconti. He was a very...

157
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,240
他有很强的个性
He was a powerful personality

158
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,200
他说话时神情严肃，语气严厉。
with a severe look and a stern tone of voice when he spoke.

159
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,440
他很无情。
And he was ruthless.

160
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:49,590
就维斯康蒂给我的指示而言
Visconti's directing - as far as he gave me any -

161
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,960
大致可归纳为四个方向:
can be reduced to more or less four directions:

162
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,680
托马斯·曼描述塔齐奥有一头蜂蜜色的头发，
Thomas Mann describes Tadzio as having honey-coloured hair,

163
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
就像希腊神话中的神一样。
like a god in Greek mythology.

164
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,280
而这个男孩也不是真正的人类——更确切地说，他是一个死亡天使。
And the boy is not really human - rather, an angel of death.

165
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,760
1971年3月1日，《威尼斯之死》在伦敦举行全球首映，
On March 1, 1971, "Death in Venice" has its world premiere in London,

166
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,760
在女王和安妮公主面前
in the presence of the queen and Princess Anne.

167
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,480
这是维斯康蒂第一次
It is here that Visconti for the first time

168
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,640
Björn是世界上最漂亮的男孩。
declares Björn to be the most beautiful boy in the world.

169
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,000
详情请参阅Björn
The description is to stay with Björn

170
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,760
在他的余生。
for the rest of his life.

171
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,160
他是“世界上最漂亮的男孩”。
He is "the most beautiful boy in the world".

172
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,240
但两个月后，《威尼斯之死》在戛纳电影节上映
But two months later "Death in Venice" is shown at the Cannes Film Festival

173
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,040
一切都起飞了。
and everything takes off.

174
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,960
戛纳，1971年，这个仪式已经有25年了:
Cannes, 1971, a ritual that's already 25 years old:

175
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,800
正装，得体的微笑，摄影师欢迎明星。
Black tie, appropriate smiles, photographers welcoming the stars.

176
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,600
第25届电影节评审团，由卢奇诺·维斯康蒂陪同。
The 25th Festival jury, accompanied by Luchino Visconti.

177
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,000
节日宫挤满了人
There is a huge crowd at the Palais des Festivals -

178
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,080
今晚是电影节的开幕之夜。
tonight's the opening night of the Film Festival.

179
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,440
可以说真正的飓风
The true hurricane, so to speak,

180
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,520
在戛纳电影节上加快了速度。
picked up speed at the Cannes Festival.

181
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,080
那是真正的马戏团开始的时候。
That's when the real circus started.

182
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,680
维斯康蒂几乎总是最受欢迎的，
Visconti is, as almost always, one of the favourites,

183
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,200
这次和他在威尼斯的死有关
this time with his Death in Venice.

184
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,160
我的眼睛里有盏灯。我看不出!现在好多了，谢谢。
There's a lamp right in my eyes. I can't see! Ah, better now, thanks.

185
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,000
背光的更好…问题吗?
Backlighting's better... Questions?

186
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,320
-我可以问你一个问题吗，维斯康蒂先生?-当然可以。
- May I ask you a question, Mr Visconti? - By all means.

187
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,480
人们几乎不需要再一次指出德克·博加德(Dirk Bogarde)的威力。
One need hardly point out, yet again, the prowess of Dirk Bogarde.

188
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,440
—但是我们不知道Björn Andrésen。-我会给你Björn Andrésen的故事…
- But Björn Andrésen was unknown to us. - I'll give you the Björn Andrésen story...

189
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,720
．..与他的许可。他的法语不太好，但他知道这一切
...with his permission. He's not too good at French, but he knows all this:

190
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,960
我到了斯德哥尔摩
I'd got to Stockholm

191
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,680
第一天我开始试镜年轻的瑞典男孩。
and on the first day I started screen-testing young Swedish boys.

192
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,760
第五个走进房间的男孩是Björn Andrésen先生。
The fifth boy to enter the room was Monsieur Björn Andrésen.

193
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,000
我很确定他配塔齐奥是对的。我毫不怀疑。
And I was absolutely sure he was right for Tadzio. I had no doubt whatsoever.

194
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,760
我把他从头到脚的每一寸都拍了下来。你还记得!
I had every inch of him photographed, from top to toe... You remember!

195
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,920
我们发现达秋!
We'd found Tadzio!

196
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,880
他那时候更漂亮。他现在老了。
He was even more beautiful back then. He has aged now.

197
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,200
他现在太高了。他的头发太长了。那时候他比现在漂亮多了。
He's too tall now. His hair's too long. He was a more beautiful boy back then.

198
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,960
虽然他不知道，但他在改变。他可能会成为一个英俊的男人。
Not that he knows, but he's changing. He might become a handsome man.

199
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,720
但就目前而言，嗯……
But for the moment, well...

200
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
他正处于尴尬的年龄。
He's at an awkward age.

201
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,200
他现在15岁了……
He is fifteen now...

202
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,480
不,十六岁。他现在很老了。
No, sixteen. He is very old now.

203
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,040
继续下去!
Move it along!

204
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
我吓坏了。
I was pretty terrified.

205
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,480
感觉就像一群蝙蝠在我周围，几乎每时每刻都是。
It felt like swarms of bats around me, pretty much all the time.

206
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,960
这是一场活生生的噩梦。
It was a living nightmare.

207
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,640
突然间，我觉得人们都在仰望我。
Suddenly, I felt that people were looking up to me.

208
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,400
我承认。
And acknowledging me.

209
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,840
甚至奉承我。
Even sucking up to me.

210
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,560
“这是什么鬼东西?”为什么大家突然都喜欢上我了?”
"What the hell's this? How come everyone suddenly likes me?"

211
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,520
这不是强烈自尊的良好基础，
That's not a good basis for strong self-esteem,

212
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,000
因为你知道你不能相信一个人真的喜欢你。
since you know you can't trust someone's genuinely liking you.

213
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,840
此外，维斯康蒂已经宣布我是
Moreover, Visconti had declared me to be

214
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,880
“世界上最漂亮的男孩”。
"the most beautiful boy in the world".

215
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,960
我本来打算化个漂亮的妆，但现在看起来糟透了。
I'd planned to have great makeup on, but now it all looks crap.

216
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,000
真见鬼!好吧，没人会注意到的。
Heck! Oh well, no one'll notice.

217
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,240
在那里!
There!

218
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
正确的。好吧……
Right. Okay...

219
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,440
-我看起来还好吗?-你看起来棒极了。
- Do I look all right? - You look great.

220
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,760
你应该穿黑袜子。你不能穿那个。
You should have black socks. You can't wear those.

221
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,040
我可以穿上我的靴子。
I can put my boots on.

222
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,800
-不，你不能这样!-不，好吧。
- No, you can't have it like that! - No, all right.

223
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,560
——Bjorn !-好的，我来开门。
- Björn! - Okay, I'll open.

224
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,960
——你好!-嗨。
- Hello! - Hi.

225
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,080
-你看起来很好!——我?
- You do look fine! - Do I?

226
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,440
-嗨。-嗨。我是杰西卡。
- Hi. - Hi. I'm Jessica.

227
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
-我是伊娃。——嗨,伊娃。
- And I'm Eva. - Hi, Eva.

228
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,520
我上次来的时候不是这样的。煤气灶开着。
It didn't look like this on my last visit. The gas burner was on.

229
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,680
-是的，我知道。-这完全是…嗯,你知道的。
- Yes, I realise. - And it was utterly... Well, you know.

230
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,760
是的。
Yes.

231
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,720
我以前总是开着煤气灶……
I always used to have a gas burner on...

232
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,680
．..在冬天的几个月。
...during the winter months.

233
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,040
-当你坐在厨房的时候。——当然。
- When you sat in the kitchen. - Of course.

234
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,560
但除此之外，当外面很冷的时候。
But otherwise, too, when it's been really cold outdoors.

235
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,440
但这并不正常，
But that's hardly normal,

236
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,800
鉴于这块砖已经加热得很好了。
seeing as the block is reasonably well heated.

237
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,800
-你要牛奶吗，伊娃?-不,谢谢。
- Do you take milk, Eva? - No thanks.

238
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,600
——糖吗?-不，就是这样。
- Sugar? - No, as it is.

239
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
-这样可以吗?-是的，谢谢。
- Is this okay? - Yes, thank you.

240
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,240
-顺便问一下，你是谁?——我是杰西卡。我比约恩的女朋友。
- Who are you, by the way? - I'm Jessica. I'm Björn's girlfriend.

241
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,560
啊,好吧!是你昨天给我打电话的。正确的。
Ah, okay! You're the one who called me yesterday. Right.

242
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,240
所以，首先…上周一……
So, first and foremost... Last Monday...

243
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,000
我真不知道该怎么解释发生的事。
I don't really know how to explain what happened...

244
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,800
你无法解释这件事，因为它以前从未发生过。这是所有。
You can't explain it, as it had never happened before. That's all.

245
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,320
没错,就是这样。我不缺乏判断力。
Exactly, that's it. I'm not lacking in powers of judgement.

246
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,240
当然，当我离开公寓或上床睡觉时，我会关掉煤气。
Of course I turn the gas off when I leave the flat or go to bed.

247
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,600
不过公寓的状况……你的正直和正直之间只有一线之隔
The state of the flat, though... There's a fine line between your integrity

248
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,240
至于你想要什么样的公寓和你作为房客的责任。
as to having your flat the way you want it and your obligations as a tenant.

249
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,800
作为房东，这可能会让你感到安慰:
This may come as a comfort to you, as a landlord:

250
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,160
在这所公寓里连一只动物也找不到。这个怎么样Björn!
There isn't a single animal to be found in this flat. How about that Björn!

251
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
一个虫子也没有!
Not a single bug or insect!

252
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,240
——神奇的考虑……-我很高兴注意到这点。
- Amazing, considering... - I'm happy to note that.

253
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,920
-我把他们抽死了-但现在我们在阳台上抽烟。
- I smoked them to death. - But now we smoke out on the balcony.

254
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,200
Björn是一个真正正派有序的人。
Björn is truly a decent well-ordered person.

255
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,600
我相信他是。一切都会好的。
I'm sure he is. Everything will be fine.

256
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,960
这些年来他没有打扰过任何邻居。
He hasn't disturbed any neighbours in all these years.

257
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,560
从这个意义上说，你表现得很好。
You're well-behaved in that sense.

258
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,080
不会有事的。
It will be fine.

259
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,200
我们还得把这扇门打扫一下。
We need to clean this door, too.

260
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,800
哇!
Wow!

261
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,240
你相信吗?
Can you believe it!

262
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,560
哦,比约恩!我的天啊，真是松了一口气!
Oh, Björn! My God, what a relief!

263
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
——正确的。让我们喝醉!——是的,喝醉了。
- Right. Let's get drunk! - Yes, drunk.

264
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,480
血腥的腌渍。
Bloody soused.

265
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
-这是我们应得的，十天的清洁。-见鬼，我要抽根烟!
- We've earned it, for ten days' cleaning. - Hell, I need a cig!

266
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
——是的。——现在!
- Yup. - Now!

267
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,200
一个新床。你真的需要一个。
A new bed. You really need one.

268
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,000
没有人应该像你一样被迫睡觉。
Nobody should be made to sleep the way you've had to.

269
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,240
——没有。——我的爱人…
- No. - My sweetheart...

270
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,920
当你觉得自己不像人的时候就会这样。
That's what happens when you don't feel like a human being.

271
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
我的亲爱的。
My darling.

272
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,440
现在我又觉得自己是个人了。
Now I feel like a human being again.

273
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,560
嘿…
Hey...

274
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,800
-眼泪是什么味道?-我不知道。
- What do those tears taste like? - I don't know.

275
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,440
premiere-night宴会……
The premiere-night banquet...

276
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,760
可以说，“你已经完成了你的使命”。
"You've served your purpose", as it were.

277
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,440
“我们现在有了我们的电影。所以你可以对这孩子为所欲为。”
"We've got our film now. So you can do what you want with the boy."

278
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,080
奶奶已经上床睡觉了。
Granny had gone to bed.

279
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,880
可以说，她把我托付给了他们。
She had placed me in their care, so to speak.

280
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,000
我不知道我们的结局是什么。
I had no idea where we'd ended up.

281
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,160
我从没去过夜总会，更不是同性恋俱乐部。
I'd never been to a nightclub, and definitely not a gay club.

282
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,440
此外，卢奇诺也在那里。
Moreover, Luchino was there.

283
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,520
我记得的是……
What I remember is...

284
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,560
地狱…!红色天鹅绒墙壁。光滑的黑色颜料……
Hell...! Red velvet walls. Glossy black paint...

285
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,240
我从来没有经历过这样的事情。
I'd never experienced anything like that.

286
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,080
贪婪的,
Voracious looks,

287
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,440
湿润的嘴唇，滚动的舌头……
wet lips, rolling tongues...

288
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,040
在他们的脑海里，他们好像在给我口交。
It felt as though, in their minds, they were giving me a blowjob.

289
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,520
所以我一饮而尽
So I drank, drink after drink,

290
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,960
只要是我能弄到的东西，我都不介意。
whatever I could lay my hands on, just to shut it out.

291
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,640
我不记得我是怎么回家的了。
I don't remember how I got home.

292
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,840
他扮演的塔齐奥让他一夜成名。全世界都想要他。
His role as Tadzio makes him famous overnight. The entire world wants him.

293
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,920
但维斯康蒂与Björn的合同将Björn束缚住了
But Visconti's contract with Björn ties Björn down

294
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,840
世界上最漂亮的男孩的角色
to the role of the Most Beautiful Boy in the World.

295
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,600
三年来，维斯康蒂“拥有”Björn的脸。
For three years, Visconti "owns" Björn's face.

296
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,520
我从各种报纸上剪下了Björn上的文章。
I've cut out articles on Björn from various newspapers.

297
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
在一些照片中，他看起来很不开心。
In some photos, he looks so unhappy.

298
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,200
是的，我非常孤独。
Yes, I was damned lonely.

299
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,720
那里有成群的记者——一定是在首映之后——
There were hordes of journalists - it must have been after the premiere -

300
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,960
在你的门外。
outside your door.

301
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,040
一袋袋的邮件已经送到了。
Sackfuls of mail had been delivered...

302
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,440
——来自日本。——主要是日本。
- From Japan. - Mainly Japan.

303
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,840
也有男人寄来的邮件，对你很着迷。
There was mail from men, too, that were fascinated by you.

304
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,440
我还记得那些日子
What I remember from those days

305
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,360
奶奶对整件事的兴奋……
was the difference between Granny's excitement about the whole business...

306
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,760
——是吗?-…还有你对此缺乏激情。
- Yes? - ...and your lack of excitement about it.

307
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,400
她成了“Björn Andrésen的奶奶”。
She became "Björn Andrésen's Granny".

308
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,640
是的，那当然是真的。
Yes, that's certainly true.

309
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
你以前经常从奶奶家跑出来。
You used to run away from Granny's place.

310
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,240
那里的国内冲突太多了。
There were so many conflicts at home there.

311
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,800
就好像电影接管了一切。
It was as if the film took over.

312
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,560
就好像你被卷入了龙卷风而无法保护自己。
As if you were drawn into a tornado without being able to defend yourself.

313
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,720
完全正确。
Exactly.

314
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,160
然后你去了日本，我不知道那里发生了什么。
Then you went to Japan, and I don't really know what happened there.

315
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,080
从那以后，我们就再也没见过面。
And after that, we never saw each other again.

316
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,280
在看了维斯康蒂的电影《威尼斯之死》之后，
After watching Death in Venice, Visconti's film,

317
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,520
我周围的人都成了Björn的粉丝。
everyone around me became fans of Björn.

318
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,520
每个人都在谈论“Björn, Björn”。
Everybody talked about "Björn, Björn".

319
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,520
那是大约50年前，半个世纪以前的事了。
That was almost 50 years ago, half a century ago.

320
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,000
也许是因为西方人在这里还很少见，
Maybe it was because Westerners were still uncommon here,

321
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,240
但是人们都疯了。
but people went wild.

322
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,840
他以第一位西方偶像的身份来到日本。
He arrives in Japan as the first idol from the West.

323
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,720
所有的准备。还有《威尼斯之死》风格的服装。
All's been prepared. There are Death-in-Venice style outfits.

324
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,040
索尼的主要生产商已经录得资金支持
Sony's leading producer has already recorded backings

325
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,320
为Björn将要演唱的流行歌曲。摄制组已经准备就绪，
for pop numbers that Björn is to sing. And a film crew is standing by,

326
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,800
等着用他做广告——他的脸，没错。
waiting to use him for a commercial - his face, that is.

327
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
我想:“这不可能发生!”
I thought: "This can't be happening!"

328
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,280
就像有一层超现实的薄膜
It's like there's this surreal membrane

329
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,800
把你和世界隔离开来。
separating you from the rest of the world.

330
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,960
他们在屋顶上挂着横幅和海报，上面写着“欢迎，Björn”。
They were on the roof with streamers and posters saying "Welcome, Björn".

331
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,600
他们拿着剪刀，随时准备把我的头发剪下来。
They had scissors, ready to snip off locks of my hair.

332
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
这就像一个超现实的梦。
It was like a surreal dream.

333
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,600
我很确定这就是电梯。
I'm pretty bloody sure this was the lift.

334
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,080
我认得那些按钮。
I recognise the pushbuttons.

335
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,920
在1971年，触摸按钮还没有被普遍使用。
In 1971, touch buttons weren't in common use.

336
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,480
肯定是这个电梯。好吧……
It was definitely this lift. Okay...

337
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,800
716，是房间号吗?
716, was that the room number?

338
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,480
——早上好。——早上好!
- Good morning. - Good morning...!

339
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,760
枪击发生前他没有得到任何信息。
He wasn't given any information before the shooting started.

340
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,600
他别无选择，只能按要求去做。
He had no choice but to do as he was told.

341
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,600
我确实觉得这对他来说很难，
I do feel that it was hard on him,

342
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,160
但当时的气氛不允许我们考虑他对这一切的感受。
but the atmosphere didn't allow us to consider how he felt about it all.

343
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,840
他们给了我两三粒红色药丸…
They gave me two or three red pills...

344
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,160
．..那是为了让我感觉好点。
...that were meant to make me feel better.

345
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,200
你不喜欢这种情况。摆这样的姿势
You didn't like this situation. To pose in this way.

346
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,880
在《威尼斯之死》中，Björn体现了“bishonen”的概念。
In Death in Venice, Björn embodies the concept of "bishonen".

347
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:44,000
它有同性恋的一面。
There is a homosexual aspect to it.

348
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,670
-然后是音乐会。-你做了多少个?
- Then there was the concert. - How many numbers did you do?

349
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,880
我不知道。我有这些红色的药丸…
I don't know. I got these red pills...

350
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,160
-我真的很震惊。——哦,是的。这是在1971年。
- I'm really shocked. - Oh yes. This was back in 1971.

351
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,120
我不管，这是他妈的虐待儿童。
I don't care, it's goddam child abuse.

352
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,960
在我的困惑中，我只是说:“好吧……”
In my confusion I just said: "Okay..."

353
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,080
-是什么?安非他命吗?-一点也不模糊。
- What was it? Amphetamine? - Not the foggiest.

354
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,240
——Stesolid ?-我完全不知道!
- Stesolid? - I've no bloody idea!

355
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,920
不管怎样，你站在舞台上，他们告诉你…
But anyway, you're up there on stage, and they're telling you...

356
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,800
等等，我得消化一下。等等!
Wait, I just need to absorb this. Wait!

357
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
-我讲得太快了?-不，这太让人心烦了。等待……
- I'm going too fast? - No, it's so upsetting. Wait...

358
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,000
-这都是50年前的事了-但这让我很伤心。
- Hey, this was nearly 50 years ago. - But it makes me sad.

359
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,600
-你不必难过。-但我知道。这让我很伤心。
- You needn't feel sad. - But I do. It makes me sad.

360
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
我只是觉得这太可怕了。
I just think it's so bloody awful.

361
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,800
我们第一次见面时，我就眼花缭乱了。我无法相信存在这样一个人。
The first time we met, I was dazzled. I couldn't believe such a person existed.

362
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,400
他的表情有些神秘。
There was something mysterious in his expression.

363
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,360
他很聪明。
He had a brightness to him.

364
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,880
但尽管他只是个十几岁的少年，我也能感觉到他的阴暗面。
But although he was only a teenager, I could also sense a dark side.

365
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,520
这给了他一种立体的吸引力。我还记得它是如何吸引我的。
It gave him a three-dimensional appeal. I remember how it really attracted me.

366
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,520
他是最初的偶像。他开创了偶像文化。
He was the original idol. He started the whole idol culture.

367
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,480
他也有黑暗的一面，尽管他得到了维斯康蒂的承认。
He had this dark side too, although he was acknowledged by Visconti.

368
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,920
这对Björn来说是一种财富，但对他来说却是一种负担。
That was an asset for Björn, at the same time a burden to him.

369
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,800
日本也有像黑泽明这样的演员
There are actors like that in Japan, who had Kurosawa's recognition

370
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,640
并因此在整个职业生涯中饱受折磨。
and suffered throughout their careers due to it.

371
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,720
这听起来有点夸张，但可以称之为他的命运。
This may sound exaggerated, but one could call it his fate.

372
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,440
所以我们告诉他我们很想和他一起录制唱片。
So, we told him that we'd really love to cut a record with him.

373
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,360
我为爱而生
I was born for love

374
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,200
那天我就在那里
Upon that day there I was

375
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,480
日语不是一门容易学的语言。
Japanese is not an easy language.

376
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,520
但他的听觉很好，很快就自然而然地学会了唱日语。
Yet he had a great ear and soon learned to sing Japanese naturally.

377
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,200
为什么我们在一起，世界百花盛开?
Why do the world's flowers blossom when we are together?

378
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,560
索尼想用这首歌中的一首做日本商业广告。
Sony wanted to use one of the songs for a Japanese commercial.

379
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,080
为哭泣的你…
For you who cried...

380
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,920
心脏跳动。
The heart beats.

381
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,880
爱唤醒。
Love awakens.

382
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,240
明治巧克力。Excel !
Meiji Chocolate. Excel!

383
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,840
一阵骚动在我的心头
A stirring in my heart

384
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,440
我是否感受到了这份爱
had me feeling this love

385
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,000
尽管如此，它是纯粹的
Nonetheless it was pure

386
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
为你流下了甜蜜的眼泪
For you who cried those sweet tears

387
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,400
杰西卡!
Jessica!

388
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,670
——杰西卡?——是吗?
- Jessica? - Yes?

389
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,520
时间是什么?
What's the time?

390
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,200
-你得起来了。-杰斯…
- You need to get up. - Jess...

391
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,520
杰西卡……
Jessica...

392
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,670
杰西卡!
Jessica!

393
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,880
-是十一点吗…还是12 ?- 11。
- Was it at eleven...or twelve? - Eleven.

394
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,640
这是15分。
It's quarter past.

395
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,520
当谈到少女漫画时，
When it comes to shojo manga, comics for girls,

396
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,960
一张漂亮的脸是最重要的。
a beautiful face is the most important thing.

397
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,160
当这部电影上映时，
When the film was released,

398
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,080
我惊讶地发现竟然存在这样一个人。
I was amazed to find out that such a person even existed.

399
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,960
我不敢相信有人能长得那么漂亮。
I couldn't believe that anyone could be that beautiful.

400
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,080
一个人出生了，他们长大了在他们的生命中有一个时刻
A human is born, they grow up and there is a moment in their life

401
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,920
当它们的美丽盛开时。
when their beauty is in full bloom.

402
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,880
这部电影成功地抓住了他，
This film managed to catch him,

403
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,640
就在他最美丽的那一刻。
in that exact moment when he was at the most beautiful he would ever be.

404
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,560
下午好。很高兴见到你。
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.

405
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,160
Björn的脸启发了整整一代的漫画漫画家。
Björn's face was to inspire a whole generation of manga cartoonists.

406
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,040
1971年，池田理代子是一位年轻的激进女权主义者。
In 1971, Riyoko Ikeda was a young, radical feminist.

407
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,320
她成为了日本最伟大的漫画家之一。
She became one of Japan's greatest manga artists.

408
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,480
我认为所有漫画家都在更深层次上受到他的启发。
I think all we manga artists are inspired by him on a deeper level.

409
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,080
我们每个人，只是方式不同。
Each one of us, but in different ways.

410
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,160
在我的漫画《凡尔赛玫瑰》中，奥斯卡夫人，
Lady Oscar in my manga, "The Rose of Versailles",

411
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,520
是一个打扮成男孩的女孩。
is a girl who dresses as a boy.

412
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,520
这个角色完全基于Björn。他是榜样。
The character is entirely based on Björn. He was the model.

413
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:30,200
我已经画了四四十五年了。
I've been drawing it for forty or forty-five years.

414
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,080
这样做,安德烈。我不希望你出什么事。
Do that, André. I don't want anything to happen to you.

415
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,840
我要,奥斯卡。
I'm going, Oscar.

416
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,720
如果爱就是受苦，那就让我受苦吧
If to love is to suffer let me suffer

417
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,360
直到你明白的那一天
until the day you understand

418
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,040
意识到我的感受
and realise how I feel

419
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,120
你是光，我是影…
You're the light and I'm the shadow...

420
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,480
他的脸上有一种悲伤。
There is a kind of sadness in his face.

421
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,480
我们所看到的只是Björn Andrésen的外观。
All we did see was the appearance of Björn Andrésen.

422
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,960
所以我一直在想，我们对他的看法……
So I always wondered if our perception of him...

423
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
．..实际上伤害了他。
...actually hurt him.

424
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,840
但现在我觉得我们也看到了他内心的自我。
But now I feel that we also saw his inner self.

425
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,280
我从未认为自己是个演员。
I have never seen myself as an actor.

426
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,160
事情已经发生了。
Things have just happened.

427
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,600
我上过戏剧学校。我有很多选角机会，一旦我离开
I went to drama school. I got a lot of casting, once I'd left -

428
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,560
好的电影部分，电视工作，舞台工作。
good film parts, TV work, stage work.

429
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:16,560
我的事业进展顺利。但这对我没有帮助……
Everything went well in terms of my career. But it didn't help me...

430
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,200
．..我内心的黑暗。
...with my inner darkness.

431
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,040
我想没人看过这个。
I don't think anyone has ever watched this.

432
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,080
我还记得最后一次见到她的情景。
I remember the last time I saw her.

433
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,760
她一定是下了10路电车。
She must have got off the number 10 tram.

434
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,200
一天，我们在去学校的路上，她站在那里挥手告别。
We were on our way to school one day and there she stood, waving away.

435
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,960
我们也向他们挥手。她挥手。
We waved back. And she waved.

436
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,560
我们也挥了挥手。就在那时，我想:
And we waved back. Even at that point, I thought:

437
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,920
“这是我最后一次见到她。”
"This is the last time I'll ever see her."

438
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,680
人们都想知道巴布罗去了哪里。
People were wondering where Barbro had got to.

439
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,200
有人会说:“她当修女了。”
Someone would say: "She's become a nun."

440
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,760
或者:“她出国了。”诸如此类。
Or: "She's gone abroad." Stuff like that.

441
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,040
只要不是真话。
Anything but the truth.

442
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,720
在这里，妈妈不见了。她还没有被找到。
Here, Mum has disappeared. She hasn't been found yet.

443
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:42,840
是我们在阿道夫·弗雷德里克音乐学校的老师莉丝贝丝·阿克塞尔松写道:
It was our teacher, Lisbeth Axelsson, at Adolf Fredrik's Music School who wrote:

444
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:50,040
Björn Andrésen很难集中注意力，而且非常健谈。
"Björn Andrésen has much difficulty concentrating and is very talkative.

445
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,440
在某种程度上，这同样适用于安妮克。感激帮助。”
"To some extent, the same applies to Annike. Grateful for help."

446
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,920
我想是因为……
I think it was because...

447
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,320
．..我们深受影响……
...we were deeply affected...

448
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,560
．..很明显，妈妈失踪了，我们不知道发生了什么。
...obviously, by Mum's disappearance, and we didn't know what had happened.

449
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,000
我们都是1955年出生的。
We were both of us born in 1955.

450
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,520
你出生在一月，而我出生在十二月。
You were born in January, and I was born in December.

451
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,960
我们有同一个母亲，但有不同的父亲。
We have the same mother, but different fathers.

452
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,720
在丹麦，他们称之为“半双胞胎”。
In Denmark, they call that "semi twins".

453
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,040
在我们的童年，你和我都很亲密
Throughout our childhood you and I were closer

454
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,400
比我对任何朋友，或你对任何朋友都要重要。
than I was to any friend or you were to any of your friends.

455
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
我们真的很亲密。
We were really close.

456
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,000
我不记得没有你的日子。一直都只有我们两个人。
I don't ever remember being without you. It was always just the two of us.

457
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,040
我记得有一天，爷爷奶奶家的门铃响了。
I remember one day the doorbell ringing at Granny and Grandpa's house.

458
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,320
我走了出去。我想你也在场。两个警察站在那里。
I went out. I think you were there too. Two policemen were standing there.

459
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,600
他们告诉我们…
And they told us...

460
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,520
他们发现妈妈死在树林里。
They had found Mum dead in the woods.

461
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,600
从那以后，从那天起，从那一刻起，
And ever since, since that day, since that hour,

462
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,040
再也没有人提起妈妈。没有一个字提到她。
no one ever mentioned Mum again. Not a single word was said about her.

463
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,920
在我的记忆中，从来没有人跟我说过妈妈的事
Nobody ever spoke to me, or as I remember it, to us, about Mum -

464
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,480
关于她的死，关于她的存在，或者关于我们的感受。
about her having died, her having existed at all, or about how we were feeling.

465
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,960
一个字也没有，从来没有。
Not a single word, ever.

466
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,320
她是个探索者。
She was a seeker.

467
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,560
一个波希米亚人，一个艺术灵魂，就像他们说的。
A bohemian, an artistic soul, as they say.

468
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,640
她是个摄影师，写诗，画画，还是个记者。
She was a photographer, she wrote poetry, she painted, she was a journalist.

469
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,880
她有个画廊…
She had an art gallery...

470
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,240
除此之外，她还为迪奥做过模特!
And, added to all that, she even did modelling for Dior!

471
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,480
她带我和妹妹去欧洲旅行了一年
She took my sister and me on a year-long trip through Europe

472
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,640
在我们开始上学之前。
before we'd even started going to school.

473
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,560
她的闺蜜席尔瓦也来了。
And her woman chum came too - Silva.

474
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,280
妈妈最大的秘密是Björn的爸爸是谁。
Mum's biggest secret was who Björn's father was.

475
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,720
这是她的秘密。
That was something she kept secret.

476
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,880
妈妈有提过什么吗
Did Mum ever mention anything

477
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,640
任何可能是我父亲的人?因为我还是不知道。
about anyone who might have been my dad? Because I still don't know.

478
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,640
-你还不知道?哦,天哪!——“哦,亲爱的”?
- You still don't know? Oh, dear! - "Oh, dear"?

479
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,680
-算了吧!-我看到…
- Just forget about it! - I see...

480
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,000
-我就这么忘了吗?-是的，我想是的。
- I'm just to forget about it? - Yes, I think so.

481
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,000
-但这是个有趣的话题。——正确的。
- But it's an interesting subject. - Right.

482
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,360
-可她从没跟你提过他?-不，不是关于谁不幸的是。
- Yet she never told you about him? - No, not about who it was. Unfortunately.

483
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,000
我明白了…
I see...

484
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,920
对吧……
Right....

485
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,320
——嗨,Bjorn !-你好。
- Hi, Björn! - Hello there.

486
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,040
等一下，我这就把咖啡放进微波炉里。
Hang on - I'll just put my coffee in the microwave.

487
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,440
-昨晚怎么样?——好。我自己去的。
- How did it go last night? - Fine. I went on my own.

488
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,680
和…彼得呢?
And... What about Peter?

489
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,840
——对不起?-那彼得呢?
- Sorry? - What about Peter?

490
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,960
——彼得?-你写了一个叫彼得的人。
- Peter who? - You wrote about someone called Peter.

491
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,800
——彼得……?-是的。
- Peter...? - Yeah.

492
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,840
“感激你的陪伴”。
Who "appreciates your company".

493
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,600
-你是说彼得·迪克森!——好的。
- Oh, you mean Peter Dixon! - Okay.

494
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,080
我们几天前在卡门餐厅。至少他很感激我。
We were at the Carmen restaurant a few days ago. At least he appreciates me.

495
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,480
你不想和我出去玩，所以我和我的朋友出去玩。
You didn't want to hang out with me, so I hang out with my friends instead.

496
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,160
-我不应该吗?
- Mm. - Shouldn't I?

497
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,240
我不确定。你写道你的生活中有了一个新的男人。
I'm not sure. You write that there's a new man in your life.

498
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,000
正确的。我在想我是不是应该去。还是我们应该这么做?
Right. I'm wondering if I should go for that. Or is it we that should?

499
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,200
还有别人，他对我是认真的。
There is someone else and he's serious about me.

500
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,240
那我是不是该放过这个机会，让你一直疑神疑鬼?
So, should I let that chance go while you're acting the paranoid geezer?

501
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,200
你把密码屏蔽掉这样我们到地球另一边的时候我就看不见了。
You shield the entry code so I won't see when we're on the far side of the planet.

502
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,280
我们一起在同一个浴缸里洗澡。我帮你锉指甲。我们睡一张床。
And we bath together in the same tub. I file your nails for you. We share a bed.

503
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,320
我们碰了对方的身体，你却仍然对进入密码保密。
We touch each other's bodies, yet you still keep your entry code secret.

504
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,040
所以我想知道你是不是我的真命天子，
So I wonder if you're the right man for me,

505
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,200
当有另一个男人真心想要我的时候。
when there's another man who really wants me.

506
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,720
那么，我真的应该为你而战吗?这是我的大问题。
So, should I really go for you? That's my big question.

507
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,880
尤其是当你表现得像头猪的时候!
Especially when you behave like a damn pig!

508
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,040
-我哪里表现得像猪了?-以什么方式?你是猪，Björn!
- In what way have I behaved like a pig? - In what way? You are a pig, Björn!

509
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,440
你在日本是头猪。总是用我的手机。什么都不付钱。
You were a pig in Japan. Always using my phone. Not paying for anything.

510
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,400
把我软禁在酒店房间里两天。
Keeping me more or less under house arrest in the hotel room for two days.

511
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,440
-等等，这些都不是…-连密码都不给我!
- Wait a minute, none of this... - Not even giving me your entry code!

512
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,320
我为你做了那么多，你这个忘恩负义的混蛋!
I have done so much for you, you ungrateful bloody bastard!

513
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,240
好吧……
Okay...

514
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,000
好吧，我该怎么解决这个问题?
Okay, how am I to sort this out?

515
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,920
1917年以后所有非婚生子女
All children born out of wedlock after 1917

516
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,920
分配了一名儿童福利官员，通常是一名女性。
were allocated a child welfare officer, who was most often a woman.

517
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,240
这些军官是用来供养这位未婚母亲的
These officers were meant to support the unmarried mother

518
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,000
也能帮助确定父亲是谁。
and also help establish who the father was.

519
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,200
这是你的档案。
This is the file on you.

520
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,200
我们还有另一份文件，来自警方的记录。
We have another file, too, from police records this time.

521
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,200
是关于你母亲的失踪。
It's about your mother's disappearance.

522
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,080
——好的。好吧。——是的。
- Okay. All right. - Yes.

523
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,120
当然，阅读起来有些困难。
It can be somewhat tough to read, naturally.

524
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,200
如果你现在想看，就看你自己了
So it's up to you if you want to look at it now

525
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,280
或者复印一份，在自己安静的家里阅读。
or have copies made, to read in the peace and quiet of your own home.

526
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,200
像这样的警方调查记录
In police investigation records like these

527
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,880
经常有照片
there are often photographs -

528
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,240
比如这里，你母亲被发现的现场的照片。
for example here, shots of the scene where your mother was found.

529
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,520
我暂时把它们拿掉了
I've removed them for the time being

530
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,040
因为我不想让他们突然和你对着干
as I don't want them suddenly to confront you.

531
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,320
你想得真周到。
That's very considerate of you.

532
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,280
它们确实存在，但我把它们分开了。
They do exist, but I've kept them separate.

533
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,160
这是描述事物的文字。
So, this is text describing things.

534
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,600
事后……
Post-mortem...

535
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,240
死亡证明
DEATH CERTIFICATE

536
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,800
从那天起，我就在脑海里看到了这一切。
I've seen all this in my mind's eye ever since that day.

537
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,520
但这太直白了。
But this is too explicit.

538
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,520
你能送我出去吗?——当然。
- Would you show me out, please? - Of course.

539
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,920
“据报1966年5月2日星期一19时30分
"On Monday, 2 May 1966, at 19:30 hrs, it was reported

540
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:32,680
"在斯特恩农场附近的树林里发现了一具女性尸体"
"that the body of a female had been found in the woodlands near Stene Farm"

541
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
她躲在茂密的杉树叶子下面
"She was concealed under dense fir foliage

542
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,680
“她右侧躺着，头靠在树根上。
"lying on her right side, her head on a root.

543
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,240
她光着头。
"Her head was bare.

544
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,920
“然而，为了保护自己，她把衣领拉到了头上。”
"However, for protection she had pulled her coat collar up over her head."

545
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,200
手提包里的文件确认了这位女士的身份
"Documents in the handbag identified the woman

546
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:59,280
作为Barbro Elisabeth夫人Andrésen，
"as Mrs Barbro Elisabeth Andrésen,

547
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,080
“去年10月被报失踪。”
"reported missing since October last year."

548
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,800
10月17日,1962年。
17 October, 1962.

549
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,720
秘密……
SECRET...

550
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,040
——阿姨。——你好吗?
- Auntie here. - Hello?

551
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,400
安妮克星期六会来看我吗?
Is Annike coming over to see me on Saturday?

552
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,160
你不觉得他们应该过来吗?
Don't you think they should come over?

553
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,200
你打电话问我:“你好吗?”
You call me and ask: "How are you?"

554
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,200
还有:“孩子们睡着了吗?或者在别的什么地方?”
And: "Are the children asleep, or maybe out somewhere?"

555
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,120
还有:“我能跟他们说话吗?”——是吗?
- And: "Could I speak to them?" - Yes?

556
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,880
你也可以跟我说，对吧?
You could just as well speak to me, right?

557
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,040
你对事情想得太多了。不要把事情复杂化。
You brood too much about things. Don't complicate it all.

558
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,640
-这么说太荒谬了。-说什么?
- That's a ridiculous thing to say. - Saying what?

559
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,520
事情不是这样的!我只能做我自己。
It doesn't work like that! I can only be the way I am.

560
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,200
当人们不允许我做我自己的时候……
And when people don't allow me to be myself...

561
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,720
-…这让我感到奇怪和“错误”。-谁不允许你?
- ...it makes me strange and "wrong". - Who doesn't allow you?

562
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,520
比如你，别让我做我自己。
You, for example, don't let me be myself.

563
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,920
-你想让我变成某种样子。我完全不明白你的意思。
- You want me to be a certain way. - I don't see what you mean at all.

564
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,520
我今天真的不明白你在说什么。不客气。
I really don't understand you today. Not at all.

565
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,000
-那我们挂断好吗?-不妨。
- Shall we hang up then? - Might as well.

566
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,440
好吧。再见。
Okay. Bye.

567
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,040
“安静，不要再说严厉的话。
"Be still, no more harsh words.

568
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,480
“我已经所剩无几了。不要为我哭泣。
"There's not much left of me. Don't cry over me.

569
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,960
“已经没有什么火需要扑灭了。别看我。
"There's no longer any fire to put out. Don't look at me.

570
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,880
“我快崩溃了。我随时都可能崩溃。
"I'm about to crumble. I'll fall apart at any moment.

571
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,240
“我不想让你看到我崩溃。
"I don't want you to see me fall apart.

572
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,240
“不要为我哭泣。现在没有火可以扑灭了。
"Don't cry for me. There's no fire left to put out now.

573
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,040
“我已经放弃了我曾经拥有的一切。
"I've given away all I ever had.

574
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,000
“我没有保存任何东西来维持生活。
"I haven't kept anything to live by.

575
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,640
“这就是为什么我越来越不为人知。
"That's why I'm becoming more and more invisible.

576
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:36,040
“但我不会死的。剩下的是:一扇门。
"But I'm not going to die. What remains: a door.

577
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,280
“除了在自己心里留下一个房间，我还能做什么呢?”
"What else can I do but leave a room within myself?

578
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,600
“我没有死，我只是消失了。
"I don't die, I just disappear.

579
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,880
“也许，我的担心——我将重新唤起确信和怀疑。
"Perhaps, my worry - I'll reawaken to certainty and doubt.

580
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,000
“那我就回来找你。”
"Then I will return, to look for you."

581
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:14,040
从某种意义上说，这可能是她的告别信。
That was probably, in a sense, her farewell letter.

582
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,880
她坐在自己的房间里
She sat in her room

583
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,840
她面前放着一瓶廉价红酒和一包切斯特菲尔德啤酒。
with a bottle of cheap red wine and a packet of Chesterfield in front of her.

584
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,000
她连续不断。
She chain-smoked.

585
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,560
她只是静静地坐在那里，凝视着窗外，直到夜幕降临。
She just sat there in silence, staring out of the window, into the night.

586
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,560
我还记得站在她身后的情景。
I can recall standing behind her.

587
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,880
我记得当时心里想:
I remember thinking:

588
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,600
“等我长大了，我要去救妈妈。”
"When I grow up, I'm going to save Mum."

589
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,080
当他…
We don't see each other when he's...

590
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,960
．..在他的最低。
...at his lowest.

591
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,520
当我还是个孩子的时候，
When I was a child,

592
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,160
有很长一段时间他不接电话。
there were long periods when he didn't answer the phone.

593
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,040
不过现在我长大了，他可能会接电话。
Though now that I'm older, he might pick up.

594
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,680
但他会告诉我“现在不是时候”。
But he'll tell me it's "not a good time at the moment".

595
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,200
爸爸的生活有些细节是孩子不应该知道的。
There are details about Dad's life that a child shouldn't be aware of.

596
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,640
在我14岁左右的时候，
And when I was 14, or so,

597
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,960
爸爸开始打开这扇门，他告诉了我一些事情。
Dad started to open this door a little, and he told me things.

598
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,520
我想大概是那个时候吧
I think it was around that time

599
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,000
我对《威尼斯之死》有了更多的了解
that I found out more about the Death in Venice film.

600
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:36,360
我觉得这和他妈妈的死有很大关系
I think a lot has to do with his mum's death.

601
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,000
这让你想知道……如果她还活着，机能正常，
It makes you wonder... If she'd been alive, functioning normally,

602
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,720
怎么……?
how would...?

603
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,320
威尼斯之死对他的打击可能没那么大
The whole Death in Venice experience probably wouldn't have hit him as hard,

604
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:58,760
如果他有一个可以信任的父母，一个可以陪伴他的人。
if he'd had a mum or dad he could trust - someone there for him.

605
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,000
理论上，他是个了不起的父亲。但在实践中，它就是不起作用。
In theory, he's an amazing dad. But in practice, it just doesn't work.

606
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,160
我希望他能在场
I wanted him to be there,

607
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:15,480
爱我，和我一起玩，从头到尾，
to love me and play with me, the whole time,

608
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,240
任何女儿都希望自己的父亲是这样的。
like any daughter would want her dad to be.

609
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,560
事实上，在某个时刻，你似乎消失了。
Actually, at one juncture you seemed to have disappeared.

610
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,600
我们甚至一度以为你已经死了。
We even thought you might be dead at one point.

611
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,350
今天，我们非常高兴地欢迎Björn Andrésen
Today, we take great pleasure in welcoming Björn Andrésen

612
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:41,720
接受我们法国观众的独家采访
for an exclusive interview for our French audience.

613
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,680
你可能记得他是年轻的塔齐奥的化身，
You might remember him as the guy who incarnated the young Tadzio,

614
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,200
卢奇诺·维斯康蒂的著名电影《威尼斯之死》
in Luchino Visconti's famous film Death in Venice.

615
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,240
对我们来说，这几乎是一个神话人物。
To us, it was an almost mythical character.

616
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,560
在我们的记忆中，我们保留着这个俊俏少年的形象。
In our memories, we retain the image of this magnificent young teenage boy.

617
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:08,640
在这一点上，它是否促成了与男性的不同关系?
At that point, did it contribute to a different relationship with men?

618
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,480
-从我这边?——是的。
- From my side? - Yes.

619
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,240
比如同性恋群体。你觉得他们对你感兴趣吗?
Like the gay community, for example. Did you feel they were interested in you?

620
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,520
-他们看着你…-哦,是的。
- That they looked at you... - Oh, yes.

621
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,390
你成了这个神话，这个男性美的象征。
That you became this myth, this symbol of male beauty.

622
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,200
好吧，让我开始…
Well, let me start...

623
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,720
有什么问题吗?如果有任何变化，之前还是之后?
What's the question? If there was any change, before or after?

624
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,600
因为同性恋群体…
Because the gay community...

625
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,880
它开始。我是说，我一直很…
It started there. I mean, I've been quite...

626
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,350
1976年我来这里拍电影。
I came here in 1976 to do a film.

627
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:53,320
结果不了了之，但我还是呆了一年。
It came to nothing, but I stayed for a year.

628
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:58,600
有个杜兰特先生，他付了所有的钱。
A Monsieur Durant, among others, paid for everything.

629
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,240
他在塞纳街给我找了间公寓，一切都安排好了。
He'd found me an apartment on Rue de Seine, everything arranged.

630
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,560
他付了所有的钱。
He paid for it all.

631
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,560
我一定是太天真了
I must have been bloody naive,

632
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,720
因为这有点像:“哇!每个人都太好了。”
because it was sort of like: "Wow! Everyone's so nice."

633
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,240
我收到了很长很长的爱情诗。
I received these really long, long, long love poems.

634
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,960
比如“Björn, je t'aime”，你知道。
Like "Björn, je t'aime", you know.

635
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,560
昂贵的午餐，晚餐，礼物。
Expensive lunches, expensive dinners, gifts.

636
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,760
他们都很有钱。
They all had really fat wallets.

637
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,920
我不认为他们对我是出于好心。
I don't think they treated me out of the kindness of a bleeding heart.

638
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,480
而是一种存在感……
It was rather a sense of being...

639
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,320
我觉得自己就像个四处游荡的奖杯。
I felt like some kind of wandering trophy.

640
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,840
我在想，如果你在巴黎待了那么久，他们又支持你……
I was thinking, if you're in Paris for that long and they support you...

641
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,390
你拿到钱了吗?你们多久见一次面?
Did you get any money? How often did you meet?

642
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,960
- - - - - -钱吗?我每周有零用钱。——不!你在开玩笑!
- Money? I got weekly pocket money. - No! You're joking!

643
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,240
- 500法郎。——不!
- 500 francs. - No!

644
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,680
1976年每周500法郎?
500 francs a week in 1976?

645
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,320
-关于这个，是的。-你知道那有多重要吗?
- About that, yes. - Do you realise how much that was?

646
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,280
也许你是一个小吉祥物，一个很酷的人
Maybe you were a little mascot, someone cool to be seen with -

647
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,720
在马克西姆酒店和丽都酒店
at Maxim's and the Lido.

648
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,080
-世界上最漂亮的男孩。-是的，“le petit garçon de Mort à Venise”
- The most beautiful boy in the world. - Yes, "le petit garçon de Mort à Venise."

649
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,960
我是一个性对象，或者说是一个对象。大的游戏。
I was a sex object, or an object anyway. Big game.

650
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,080
可以说，他们为你的公司付了钱。
They paid for your company, as it were.

651
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,800
看在上帝的份上，我从来没有自己的钱，
For God's sake - I never had any money of my own,

652
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,320
至少在我周游世界的时候不会。
at least not when I was travelling round the world.

653
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,200
我太自以为是了。
It was so into my own ego.

654
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,560
如果当时我知道今天的情况，我肯定不会去巴黎。
If I'd known then what I know today, I'd have said no to Paris.

655
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,000
但这是非常重要的，Björn…
But it's of major importance, Björn...

656
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,920
．..就今天的你和你如何看待自己而言，
...in terms of who you are today and of how you see yourself,

657
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,800
那些破碎的梦想，
and of those shattered dreams,

658
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,920
什么没发生，什么发生了。
and of what didn't happen, and what did.

659
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,480
你不是一个简单的人Björn。
You're not an uncomplicated person, Björn.

660
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,080
你是très compliqué。
Tu es très compliqué.

661
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,680
亲爱的Bjorn……
Beloved Björn...

662
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,920
-我一生的挚爱-我值得吗?
- The love of my life. - Do I deserve to be?

663
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,520
你做的事情。
You do.

664
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,840
-你好!嘿,亲爱的。
-Hi! -Hello, sweetie.

665
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,840
-最近怎么样?-和往常一样。
- How are things? - Same as usual.

666
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,200
同样的像往常一样吗?向上或向下?
Same as usual? Up or down?

667
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,320
想尿尿，怕火车，没力气。
In need of a pee, scared of trains, lacking in strength.

668
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:18,040
——一个小…-听起来很熟悉。
- A little... - That sounds familiar.

669
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,840
你知道吗，到今年12月，我已经离开这里11年了?
Do you realise it's eleven years, this December, since I was last here?

670
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,350
不要说!
Don't say that!

671
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,840
真的有那么久了吗?我是说，这地方看起来…
Has it really been that long? I mean, this place looked...

672
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,920
没有人来看我。
I haven't had anyone visiting.

673
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,920
直到一年前，
Not until just over a year ago,

674
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,320
杰西卡帮我打扫的时候
when Jessica helped me clean the place up.

675
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,480
都挤在一起!
All squeezed together!

676
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:00,200
-对"世界上最丑的婴儿"-是在"出生"下面吗?
- Right, "the ugliest baby in the world." - Is it in here, under "Births"?

677
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,560
-在那儿!——是的。
- There it is! - Yup.

678
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,350
“世界上最丑的孩子，我们美妙的女儿。”
"The ugliest baby in the world, our wonderful daughter."

679
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,120
谢谢!
Thanks!

680
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,280
你的内容。
You're content there.

681
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:26,480
成为父亲是最可怕的事情。父亲应该做什么?
Becoming a father was the scariest thing ever. What are fathers supposed to do?

682
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:34,680
几个月前我进了戏剧学校。
I'd got into drama school a few months earlier.

683
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:41,520
我觉得我必须尽我所能做到最好。
I felt I had to do the best I possibly could.

684
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,840
我最大的愿望是
And my biggest wish was

685
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:51,240
你就不用经历我小时候所经历的
that you wouldn't have to go through what I went through as a child.

686
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:57,120
要维持一个家庭，你需要两个人。
For a family to work, you need to be two people.

687
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,040
这就是它崩溃的地方。喝了太多酒…
That's where it fell apart. Too much alcohol and...

688
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,840
但我觉得我是个更健康的成年人
But I think I'm a healthier adult

689
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,320
因为你们分居，而不是住在一起
due to your living apart, than if you'd lived together.

690
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,120
-艾文到了。——是的。
- Elvin's arrived here. - Yes.

691
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,040
这就是我们成为“好家庭”的时候。
That's when we became "the Good family".

692
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,560
-我们成了“好家庭”?——是的。
- We became "the Good family"? - Yes.

693
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:32,240
当我还是个孩子，甚至是十几岁的时候，你经常说，经常说:
When I was a child, even into my teens, you often said, very often:

694
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:37,640
“如果你想知道什么，尽管问我。”
"If there's ever anything you want to know, just ask me."

695
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,280
当你喝醉的时候…它是如此的神秘-
When you were drunk, too... It was so cryptic -

696
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,760
我一直不知道你的问题是什么意思。
I never knew what questions you meant.

697
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,760
你是想让我知道发生了什么事吗?
Was it that you wanted me to know what had happened?

698
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,560
我不想让你孤单。
I didn't want you to be lonely.

699
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,920
还有，不管你想知道什么…
Also, whatever you wanted to know...

700
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:08,560
．..我会告诉你，即使不是实话，至少也要告诉你我的说法。
...I'd tell you, if not the truth, then at least my side of the story.

701
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,320
你是如此美丽!
You're so beautiful!

702
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,400
对不起。大男孩不哭。
Sorry. Big boys don't cry.

703
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,520
我每次见到你，你都哭。总有些东西会感动你。
You cry almost every time I see you. Something always moves you.

704
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,000
-是的，我是个敏感的家伙。-是的，那就做一个吧!
- Yes, I'm a sensitive bugger. - Yes, be one then!

705
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,880
-我说什么了?-“我说什么?”
- What said I? - "What said I?"

706
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,200
你知道吗，妈妈?
Do you know something, Mummy?

707
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,880
艾文死了。他在花丛中。在天空中。
Elvin died. He's in the flowers. In the sky.

708
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,520
在这张照片。
In the picture.

709
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,920
在乐高。
In the Lego.

710
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,560
这一切都是同时发生的。
And it all happened at once.

711
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,920
-你觉得很难吗?——嗯。
- Do you find it hard? - Mm-hmm.

712
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,960
-我拿了你的刀。-不，你说了。
- I took your knife. - Yes, you did.

713
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,880
“这一切都是同时发生的。”
"And it all happened at once."

714
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:23,320
那是1987年8月11日，罗宾三岁生日的第二天。
It was 11 August, 1987, the day after Robine's third birthday.

715
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,240
在艾文死后差不多三个月。
Almost three months after Elvin died.

716
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:40,680
我已经出去了。
I'd been out.

717
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,080
那是5月17日。
It was 17 May.

718
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,520
我在外面玩了很晚，我回到家，就睡着了。
I'd had a late night out, and I come home, and I fall asleep.

719
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:59,400
她要带罗宾去幼儿园。
She's taking Robine to kindergarten.

720
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,440
她把他放在我旁边的床上。
And she lays him next to me in bed.

721
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,040
我睡得太少了。
I've had far, far too little sleep.

722
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,160
我醉得一塌糊涂。
And I'm as drunk as hell.

723
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,480
他躺在我旁边，我睡着了。
He's lying next to me, and I fall asleep.

724
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,520
晕了过去。
Passed out.

725
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:38,240
我被一声尖叫吵醒了，是她。
I'm woken up by a scream, and it's her.

726
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:51,160
我能看见他躺在那里。他的嘴唇是蓝色的。
I can see him lying there. His lips are blue.

727
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:59,000
然后我们拼命地，徒劳地，试图……
Then we desperately, and in vain, try to...

728
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:05,200
．..他复活。
...resuscitate him.

729
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,960
他们的诊断是婴儿猝死综合症
Their diagnosis is sudden infant death syndrome.

730
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,320
但我的诊断是缺乏爱。
But my diagnosis is lack of love.

731
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:32,320
我不能胜任。他必须承担太多的责任。
I wasn't up to it. And he had to take far too much responsibility.

732
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:38,560
在他小小的肩膀上，他承载着我们全家的幸福。
On his tiny shoulders, he bore the whole of our family's happiness.

733
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,520
但随着他的离去，一切都结束了。
But things gave way, with him.

734
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:07,120
罗宾不仅失去了她的弟弟。她也失去了父亲。
Robine didn't only lose her little brother. She lost her father as well.

735
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,800
我陷入了抑郁和酗酒之中。
I descended into depression and alcohol.

736
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,240
自我毁灭……
Self-destruction...

737
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,440
．..所有你能想到的方式。
...in all ways imaginable.

738
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,680
这是一场自我炫耀。"可怜的我，我，我" -我，我，我。
It was an ego trip. "Poor me, me, me" - I, me, mine.

739
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,480
然后你就变回孩子了。
And then you're back to being a child.

740
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,800
一个孩子不能照顾自己的孩子。
A child can't look after a child.

741
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,350
我们在一起8个月。
We had eight months together.

742
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,480
他会……多大了?
He would have been... How old?

743
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,480
他今天就32岁了。
He would have been 32 today.

744
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,560
我想知道他的话听起来会是什么样子……
I wonder how he'd have sounded...

745
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,880
．..他会有什么样的声音。
...what kind of voice he would've had.

746
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,520
他的表情怎么样?
What about his expression?

747
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:36,000
而这一切都取决于我作为一个父亲的表现。
And that would all have depended on how I'd acted as a father.

748
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,520
因为他是我的儿子。
Because he was my boy.

749
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,480
但事实是，我当时不在那里。
But the fact is, I wasn't there.

750
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,520
如果我不出去，如果我表现得像个成年人，他就会活着。
If I hadn't gone out, if I'd behaved like an adult instead, he would be alive.

751
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,880
如果我认真对待自己的责任，他今天应该还活着。
If I'd taken my responsibility seriously, he'd still be alive today.

752
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,840
但一切从一开始就错了。
But everything was wrong from the start.

753
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,720
我的生活。她的生活。
My life. Her life.

754
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,800
真正疯狂的是你已经习惯了。
What's really insane is that you get used to it.

755
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,280
你别指望……
You don't expect...

756
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,280
．..这就是生活。
...that much from life.

757
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,560
我真不知道该怎么表达。当你失去了那么多
I don't really know how to express it. When you've lost so much,

758
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:39,350
它以自己独特的方式让生活变得更容易。
it somehow, in its own special way, makes life easier to live.

759
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,560
好吧，我错过了，我错过了。好吧。
Okay - I missed this, I lost that. Okay.

760
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,920
我失去了太多其他的东西。
I've lost so much else.

761
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,520
艾文:3个月。罗宾:2年4个月。
Elvin: 3 months. Robine: 2 years, 4 months.

762
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,720
桑娜:24年零9个月。Björn: 31年11个月。
Sanna: 24 years, 9 months. Björn: 31 years, 11 months.

763
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,240
你曾经躺在草地上吗
Have you ever lain on the grass

764
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:51,440
想象你不是在看太空，
and imagined you're not looking into space,

765
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:55,880
但是你在观察下面是什么?
but you're observing what's down below?

766
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,080
这是一种非常令人敬畏的感觉。
It's a pretty awe-inspiring feeling.

767
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:09,680
我的意思是，当我们仰望星空时，我们是朝哪个方向看的?
I mean, when we look up at the stars, what direction are we looking in?

768
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:16,120
我们是在向外看、向内看、向上看还是向下看?
Are we looking outwards, inwards, upwards, or downwards?

769
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,560
我是说，我还在这，坐在这里，
I mean, I'm still around, I'm sitting here,

770
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,160
世间的一切都是极不确定的
and everything worldly is extremely uncertain

771
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,640
除非你有自己的信仰。
unless one has one's faith.

772
01:25:52,350 --> 01:25:57,880
当我看试镜时，
When I look at the screen test,

773
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,080
在《威尼斯之死》的试镜中
shot at his audition for Death in Venice,

774
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,320
我觉得很痛苦。
I find it painful.

775
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:10,280
我可以处理这一切的结果，也可以处理他现在的样子。
I can deal with what it all resulted in, and with the person he's become today.

776
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:18,320
但在电影中看到的——那个关键的转折点……
But witnessing it there on film - that crucial turning point...

777
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:23,320
当我看到他这么不自在，
When I see how very ill at ease he feels,

778
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:27,120
知道其他观众不知道的事情，
and, knowing things that other people watching this don't know,

779
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,600
关于他是谁…
about the person he is...

780
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:34,040
我们说的是一个非常敏感的男孩，非常害羞，
We're talking about an incredibly sensitive boy, really shy,

781
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,720
一个根本不想去的人。
who doesn't even want to be there.

782
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,840
然后他就得脱了衣服摆造型。
Then he's suddenly supposed to pose without his shirt.

783
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,480
裸露对他来说不是…
Nudity to him isn't...

784
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,880
他不想赤身裸体，也不想脱衣服。
He doesn't want to be naked, doesn't want to take his clothes off.

785
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,640
这是令人痛苦的。
That was painful to watch.

786
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:57,800
这就是我想要回到过去的地方问他奶奶她在做什么
That's where I want to go back in time and ask his granny what she's up to:

787
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,080
“住手!离这孩子远点。”
"Stop it! Leave the lad alone."

788
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,880
这是错误的。你不能这样对孩子。
It's wrong. You don't do that to children.

789
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,760
达秋……?达秋!
Tadzio...? Tadzio!

790
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,680
“安静，不要再说严厉的话。
"Be still, no more harsh words.

791
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,640
“我已经所剩无几了。
"There's not much left of me.

792
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,200
“不要为我哭泣。
"Don't cry over me.

793
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,720
“已经没有什么火需要扑灭了。
"There's no longer any fire to put out.

794
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,280
“我不再清楚自己是什么，不是什么。
"I no longer have a sense of what I am and what I'm not.

795
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,200
”我环顾四周。是我吗?
"I look around. Is that me?

796
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,640
“也?”
"Or that?"

797
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,440
达秋!
Tadzio!

798
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,640
“我变得越来越隐形了。
"I'm becoming more and more invisible.

799
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,520
“我已经放弃了我曾经拥有的一切。
"I've given away all I ever had.

800
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,560
“但我不会死的。
"But I'm not going to die.

801
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,240
“剩下的是一扇门。
"What remains: a door.

802
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,680
“我没有死，我只是消失了。
"I don't die, I just disappear.

803
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,000
“也许,我会唤醒。
"Maybe, I'll reawaken.

804
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,680
“那我就回去找你。”
"Then I will return to look for you."
