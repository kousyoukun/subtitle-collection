1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,280
One day, Pelle was sleeping.

2
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,200
It was actually dark.

3
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,560
But Father wasn't there.

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,280
So he went over to Mother's bed.

5
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,640
But Mother wasn't there either.

6
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,320
Where are Mother and Father?

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320
- Mummy!
- Come here.

8
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,960
This is how you speak into it, Björn.
Like this.

9
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,320
Can you say "Mummy"? Say "Mummy".

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,600
No, you're spoiling the flower.

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,280
No, no - you're not to play with it!

12
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,120
Goodbye - off to bed now.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,640
It's 16 November, 1962.

14
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,280
- Hello?
- Hi, Björn!

15
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,640
How are you, sweetheart?

16
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,280
- Well, not all that good.
- Aren't you?

17
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,400
- Is Mum home?
- No.

18
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,960
It's a bitter cold
gloomy February day in 1970.

19
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,840
The film director Luchino Visconti
is on his way to Stockholm.

20
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,120
One of cinema's
most outstanding figures,

21
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,680
he's known both for his artistry
and his lineage.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,680
He's from the nobility of northern Italy.
He's a Communist, yet he has servants.

23
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,680
And he's openly gay.

24
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,680
Visconti is out, seeking pure beauty -

25
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:05,240
perfect beauty in a boy
who is to play the lead in his new film.

26
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,640
I can't see his eyes.
What colour are they?

27
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,920
Look over here.

28
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Green.

29
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,120
He looks lovely - a beautiful face.

30
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,720
Tell him to take some pictures.

31
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,360
For years, he's travelled, searching -
in Hungary, Poland, Finland, Russia.

32
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
In a large apartment
next to the Grand Hôtel in Stockholm

33
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,200
a group of boys have gathered,
full of anticipation.

34
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,920
- He is a child actor.
- A child actor, is he?

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
Have you seen anyone
you think might work?

36
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,000
No, not yet. Some are really sweet,
but we've not got a bullseye yet.

37
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,920
The door is about to open.

38
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,360
A boy, stood behind the door,
doesn't yet know

39
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,560
that his entire life
is about to change.

40
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,480
His face is to become an icon -
all over the world.

41
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,880
How old is he? Older, right?

42
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,240
- Yes, a little. He's 15.
- Big. 15? Very beautiful. Turn your head.

43
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,920
In profile.

44
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,760
- He's very beautiful in this photo.
- Did you bring any photographs?

45
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,520
No.

46
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,480
Can you walk round the room in a circle?

47
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,400
He's damn tall.

48
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,880
- Beautiful! Ask him to undress.
- Could you bare your torso?

49
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,120
- What?
- Can you bare your torso?

50
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
- So you're half-naked.
- Half-naked?

51
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,880
- Look into the camera, too.
- Look into the camera and smile a little.

52
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,600
- Very beautiful...
- Walk around a bit.

53
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,880
Ask him to stop.
Get a big close-up, really tight!

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,760
Turn to camera.

55
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,840
Very, very close.
Three-quarter shot, not full face.

56
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,600
- Smile into the camera.
- Look into the camera and smile.

57
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,560
- You have a lovely smile!
- Thank you. We need to take pictures.

58
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,760
Mario! Let's take close-ups, too -

59
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,600
profile right and left, his face,
and full on, with naked torso.

60
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,840
He has a beautiful face.

61
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,120
Welcome to Tenants' Association.
You'll be given three options.

62
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,920
Choose the one
that best suits your needs.

63
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,240
Well, I need legal advice.

64
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,800
What do I do?
I know nothing about this stuff.

65
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,120
Explain what's happened
and what you need assistance with,

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,320
and I'll do what I can to help.

67
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,720
You could say
I'm being threatened with eviction...

68
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,880
- ...with termination of contract.
- Right.

69
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,120
In the landlord's letter, Björn,

70
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,840
it says that you're a danger to other
tenants, since you left the gas stove on.

71
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,600
- That's bullshit!
- Sure, but look here...

72
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,120
- I am not careless. I check it every time!
- But it's all part of her concern.

73
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,360
Because a filthy kitchen fan...

74
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,280
- ...covered in oil, can easily catch fire.
- I realise that.

75
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,520
That is why you are a danger.
You have to keep it clean.

76
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,240
Now, it's a matter of explaining
why you were lying on the bed,

77
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,840
with the gas burner on.
Because she knows that.

78
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,240
And why the gas burner is on
when you are not at home.

79
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,040
Your duvet... I lifted it...

80
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,520
And while I held it up
it just disintegrated.

81
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,840
It just collapsed
into little foam rubber fragments

82
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,080
of old, disgusting, I don't know what.

83
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,520
Wait... I still have a pillow here. Look!

84
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,680
Underneath here. Look!

85
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,640
Bugs have been feeding on this.
It's so bloody revolting. Horrible!

86
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,880
And under it
there was a layer this thick...

87
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,880
I don't even know what... Pure filth.

88
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,280
It looks like poo...

89
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,200
...from carpet beetles
or revolting bugs like that.

90
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Bloody disgusting!

91
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,640
- My home's an environmental hazard.
- Right.

92
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
It's true.

93
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
"Cyclone". What did I mean by that title?

94
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,520
Wow...!

95
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:19,400
I had run away from this ghastly
boarding school in Denmark

96
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,640
and got to Stockholm,
to my maternal grandparents.

97
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,520
I didn't have any parents, really.

98
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,680
It was Granny
that saw to all this stuff.

99
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,400
She put my name down
for all sorts of things.

100
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,560
I don't know - I suppose
I just went along with it all.

101
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,520
She wanted a celebrity for a grandchild.

102
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,560
And all I was certain about
was that I wanted to play music.

103
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,640
I didn't really have any concept
of how big this all was.

104
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,760
It was, of course, great to go abroad,

105
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,960
to a country I'd never been to,

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
to do some kind
of cool extra school-holiday work.

107
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,160
Ecco - a little bit more...

108
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,880
Quiet, please!

109
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,000
Tadzio
- that beautiful sculpture of a boy -

110
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,680
is played by Björn Andrésen,
a 15-year-old Swedish boy.

111
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,760
Did you know exactly what you were after
when you started looking?

112
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,600
Yes, exactly that. Just like him.

113
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,520
- As if you'd had a photograph?
- Yes. He was the sixth boy I'd tried.

114
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,880
I knew immediately.

115
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,880
He is blond, with a perfect profile and
grey eyes. Can you see his grey eyes?

116
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,440
"The colour of water", as Mr Mann wrote.
Just like the colour of these eyes.

117
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,760
He's to be as cold as a statue.
He's understood the part. He's perfect.

118
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,160
There's no risk of slipping into sexuality.
That would amount to a serious fault.

119
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:25,280
I was standing next to Visconti,
when this blond boy turned up.

120
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,360
It was plain to see

121
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,920
that Visconti's whole body
came to life.

122
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,920
The boy was exquisitely beautiful,
with a truly photogenic face.

123
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,400
He was a real find.

124
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,880
He was a boy
with a very special charisma.

125
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,280
He seems frail.

126
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,160
And that's really beautiful in a film.

127
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,040
You need to be very careful
dealing with children like that.

128
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,040
"Death in Venice" is set at a classic
hotel on the Lido, an island off Venice:

129
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,400
the Grand Hôtel des Bains.

130
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,880
The story, written by Thomas Mann,
had preoccupied Visconti for years.

131
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,160
With the ancient hotel, he creates
a perfect turn-of-the-century setting.

132
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,800
To Visconti, "Death in Venice"
is a deeply personal narrative.

133
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,000
Granny came along to Venice.

134
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,280
She'd brought a Super 8 cine camera
and, of course, she shot everything.

135
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,800
Visconti gave her a small part,
which pleased her no end.

136
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,920
I also had a governess - Miriam.

137
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
She was meant to help me
with my schoolwork.

138
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
You were like a younger brother.

139
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,520
whom I was supposed to protect against
this new world, new to me as well.

140
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,960
That was my job,
as stated in my contract.

141
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,880
I found it pretty hard going.

142
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,960
Someone mentioned
that Visconti had issued an order.

143
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,280
Remember, the whole crew
were homosexuals.

144
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,880
An order that no one was
as much as to to look at little Tadzio.

145
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:29,080
Without my being aware of it, I was
in a sense being protected by "the man".

146
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,360
It's a love story, one that's pure.

147
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,160
It's neither sexual nor erotic.

148
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,800
It's a higher form of love. Let's say...

149
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,880
- Perfection within love.
- I imagine, looking for producers...

150
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,640
The story of the love between an aging
composer and an adolescent boy...

151
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,240
- That might cause certain problems.
- It did.

152
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,760
One producer in particular wanted
to cast a girl, to replace Tadzio.

153
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,960
"No," I said,

154
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,440
"I refuse to have a Tadzia." It wouldn't
keep to the author's message, right?

155
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:19,960
You were to be used to illustrate a story
that was in no way your story.

156
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,600
People were a bit scared of Visconti.
He was a very...

157
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,240
He was a powerful personality

158
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,200
with a severe look
and a stern tone of voice when he spoke.

159
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,440
And he was ruthless.

160
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,600
Visconti's directing
- as far as he gave me any -

161
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,960
can be reduced
to more or less four directions:

162
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,680
Thomas Mann describes Tadzio
as having honey-coloured hair,

163
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,600
like a god in Greek mythology.

164
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,280
And the boy is not really human -
rather, an angel of death.

165
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,760
On March 1, 1971, "Death in Venice"
has its world premiere in London,

166
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,760
in the presence of the queen
and Princess Anne.

167
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,480
It is here that Visconti for the first time

168
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,640
declares Björn to be
the most beautiful boy in the world.

169
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,000
The description is to stay with Björn

170
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,760
for the rest of his life.

171
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,160
He is "the most beautiful boy
in the world".

172
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,240
But two months later "Death in Venice"
is shown at the Cannes Film Festival

173
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,040
and everything takes off.

174
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,960
Cannes, 1971,
a ritual that's already 25 years old:

175
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,800
Black tie, appropriate smiles,
photographers welcoming the stars.

176
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,600
The 25th Festival jury,
accompanied by Luchino Visconti.

177
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,000
There is a huge crowd
at the Palais des Festivals -

178
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,080
tonight's the opening night
of the Film Festival.

179
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,440
The true hurricane, so to speak,

180
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,520
picked up speed at the Cannes Festival.

181
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,080
That's when the real circus started.

182
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,680
Visconti is, as almost always,
one of the favourites,

183
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,200
this time with his Death in Venice.

184
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,160
There's a lamp right in my eyes.
I can't see! Ah, better now, thanks.

185
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,000
Backlighting's better... Questions?

186
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,320
- May I ask you a question, Mr Visconti?
- By all means.

187
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,480
One need hardly point out, yet again,
the prowess of Dirk Bogarde.

188
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,440
- But Björn Andrésen was unknown to us.
- I'll give you the Björn Andrésen story...

189
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,720
...with his permission. He's not too good
at French, but he knows all this:

190
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,960
I'd got to Stockholm

191
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,680
and on the first day I started
screen-testing young Swedish boys.

192
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,760
The fifth boy to enter the room
was Monsieur Björn Andrésen.

193
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,000
And I was absolutely sure he was right
for Tadzio. I had no doubt whatsoever.

194
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,760
I had every inch of him photographed,
from top to toe... You remember!

195
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,920
We'd found Tadzio!

196
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,880
He was even more beautiful back then.
He has aged now.

197
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:18,200
He's too tall now. His hair's too long.
He was a more beautiful boy back then.

198
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,960
Not that he knows, but he's changing.
He might become a handsome man.

199
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,720
But for the moment, well...

200
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,760
He's at an awkward age.

201
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,200
He is fifteen now...

202
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,480
No, sixteen. He is very old now.

203
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,040
Move it along!

204
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,880
I was pretty terrified.

205
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:53,480
It felt like swarms of bats around me,
pretty much all the time.

206
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,960
It was a living nightmare.

207
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Suddenly, I felt
that people were looking up to me.

208
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,400
And acknowledging me.

209
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,840
Even sucking up to me.

210
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,560
"What the hell's this? How come
everyone suddenly likes me?"

211
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,520
That's not a good basis
for strong self-esteem,

212
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,000
since you know you can't trust
someone's genuinely liking you.

213
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:39,840
Moreover, Visconti
had declared me to be

214
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,880
"the most beautiful boy in the world".

215
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,960
I'd planned to have great makeup on,
but now it all looks crap.

216
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,000
Heck! Oh well, no one'll notice.

217
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,240
There!

218
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
Right. Okay...

219
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,440
- Do I look all right?
- You look great.

220
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,760
You should have black socks.
You can't wear those.

221
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,040
I can put my boots on.

222
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,800
- No, you can't have it like that!
- No, all right.

223
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,560
- Björn!
- Okay, I'll open.

224
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,960
- Hello!
- Hi.

225
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,080
- You do look fine!
- Do I?

226
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,440
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Jessica.

227
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
- And I'm Eva.
- Hi, Eva.

228
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,520
It didn't look like this on my last visit.
The gas burner was on.

229
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,680
- Yes, I realise.
- And it was utterly... Well, you know.

230
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,760
Yes.

231
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,720
I always used to have a gas burner on...

232
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,680
...during the winter months.

233
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,040
- When you sat in the kitchen.
- Of course.

234
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,560
But otherwise, too,
when it's been really cold outdoors.

235
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,440
But that's hardly normal,

236
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,800
seeing as the block
is reasonably well heated.

237
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,800
- Do you take milk, Eva?
- No thanks.

238
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,600
- Sugar?
- No, as it is.

239
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
- Is this okay?
- Yes, thank you.

240
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,240
- Who are you, by the way?
- I'm Jessica. I'm Björn's girlfriend.

241
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,560
Ah, okay! You're the one
who called me yesterday. Right.

242
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,240
So, first and foremost... Last Monday...

243
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,000
I don't really know
how to explain what happened...

244
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,800
You can't explain it, as it had never
happened before. That's all.

245
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:49,320
Exactly, that's it. I'm not lacking
in powers of judgement.

246
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,240
Of course I turn the gas off
when I leave the flat or go to bed.

247
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,600
The state of the flat, though...
There's a fine line between your integrity

248
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,240
as to having your flat the way you want it
and your obligations as a tenant.

249
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,800
This may come as a comfort to you,
as a landlord:

250
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,160
There isn't a single animal to be found
in this flat. How about that Björn!

251
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
Not a single bug or insect!

252
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,240
- Amazing, considering...
- I'm happy to note that.

253
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,920
- I smoked them to death.
- But now we smoke out on the balcony.

254
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,200
Björn is truly
a decent well-ordered person.

255
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm sure he is. Everything will be fine.

256
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,960
He hasn't disturbed any neighbours
in all these years.

257
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,560
You're well-behaved in that sense.

258
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,080
It will be fine.

259
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,200
We need to clean this door, too.

260
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,800
Wow!

261
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,240
Can you believe it!

262
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,560
Oh, Björn! My God, what a relief!

263
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,480
- Right. Let's get drunk!
- Yes, drunk.

264
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,480
Bloody soused.

265
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
- We've earned it, for ten days' cleaning.
- Hell, I need a cig!

266
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,120
- Yup.
- Now!

267
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,200
A new bed. You really need one.

268
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,000
Nobody should be made to sleep
the way you've had to.

269
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,240
- No.
- My sweetheart...

270
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,920
That's what happens
when you don't feel like a human being.

271
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,720
My darling.

272
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,440
Now I feel like a human being again.

273
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,560
Hey...

274
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,800
- What do those tears taste like?
- I don't know.

275
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,440
The premiere-night banquet...

276
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,760
"You've served your purpose", as it were.

277
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,440
"We've got our film now. So you
can do what you want with the boy."

278
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,080
Granny had gone to bed.

279
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,880
She had placed me in their care,
so to speak.

280
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,000
I had no idea where we'd ended up.

281
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,160
I'd never been to a nightclub,
and definitely not a gay club.

282
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,440
Moreover, Luchino was there.

283
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,520
What I remember is...

284
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Hell...! Red velvet walls.
Glossy black paint...

285
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,240
I'd never experienced anything like that.

286
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,080
Voracious looks,

287
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,440
wet lips, rolling tongues...

288
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,040
It felt as though, in their minds,
they were giving me a blowjob.

289
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,520
So I drank, drink after drink,

290
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,960
whatever I could lay my hands on,
just to shut it out.

291
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,640
I don't remember how I got home.

292
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:01,840
His role as Tadzio makes him famous
overnight. The entire world wants him.

293
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,920
But Visconti's contract with Björn
ties Björn down

294
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,840
to the role
of the Most Beautiful Boy in the World.

295
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,600
For three years,
Visconti "owns" Björn's face.

296
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,520
I've cut out articles on Björn
from various newspapers.

297
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,760
In some photos, he looks so unhappy.

298
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:35,200
Yes, I was damned lonely.

299
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,720
There were hordes of journalists
- it must have been after the premiere -

300
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,960
outside your door.

301
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,040
Sackfuls of mail had been delivered...

302
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,440
- From Japan.
- Mainly Japan.

303
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,840
There was mail from men, too,
that were fascinated by you.

304
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,440
What I remember from those days

305
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,360
was the difference between Granny's
excitement about the whole business...

306
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,760
- Yes?
- ...and your lack of excitement about it.

307
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,400
She became "Björn Andrésen's Granny".

308
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,640
Yes, that's certainly true.

309
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,000
You used to run away
from Granny's place.

310
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,240
There were so many conflicts
at home there.

311
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,800
It was as if the film took over.

312
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,560
As if you were drawn into a tornado
without being able to defend yourself.

313
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,720
Exactly.

314
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,160
Then you went to Japan, and I don't
really know what happened there.

315
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,080
And after that,
we never saw each other again.

316
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,280
After watching Death in Venice,
Visconti's film,

317
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,520
everyone around me
became fans of Björn.

318
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:14,520
Everybody talked about "Björn, Björn".

319
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,520
That was almost 50 years ago,
half a century ago.

320
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,000
Maybe it was because Westerners
were still uncommon here,

321
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,240
but people went wild.

322
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:36,840
He arrives in Japan
as the first idol from the West.

323
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,720
All's been prepared.
There are Death-in-Venice style outfits.

324
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,040
Sony's leading producer
has already recorded backings

325
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,320
for pop numbers that Björn is to sing.
And a film crew is standing by,

326
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:54,800
waiting to use him for a commercial -
his face, that is.

327
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
I thought: "This can't be happening!"

328
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,280
It's like there's this surreal membrane

329
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,800
separating you from the rest of the world.

330
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:17,960
They were on the roof with streamers
and posters saying "Welcome, Björn".

331
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,600
They had scissors,
ready to snip off locks of my hair.

332
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,480
It was like a surreal dream.

333
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,600
I'm pretty bloody sure
this was the lift.

334
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,080
I recognise the pushbuttons.

335
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,920
In 1971, touch buttons
weren't in common use.

336
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,480
It was definitely this lift. Okay...

337
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,800
716, was that the room number?

338
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,480
- Good morning.
- Good morning...!

339
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,760
He wasn't given any information
before the shooting started.

340
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,600
He had no choice
but to do as he was told.

341
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:22,600
I do feel that it was hard on him,

342
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,160
but the atmosphere didn't allow us
to consider how he felt about it all.

343
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,840
They gave me two or three red pills...

344
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,160
...that were meant
to make me feel better.

345
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,200
You didn't like this situation.
To pose in this way.

346
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,880
In Death in Venice, Björn embodies
the concept of "bishonen".

347
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:44,000
There is a homosexual aspect to it.

348
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,680
- Then there was the concert.
- How many numbers did you do?

349
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,880
I don't know. I got these red pills...

350
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:08,160
- I'm really shocked.
- Oh yes. This was back in 1971.

351
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,120
I don't care, it's goddam child abuse.

352
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,960
In my confusion I just said: "Okay..."

353
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,080
- What was it? Amphetamine?
- Not the foggiest.

354
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,240
- Stesolid?
- I've no bloody idea!

355
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,920
But anyway, you're up there on stage,
and they're telling you...

356
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,800
Wait, I just need to absorb this. Wait!

357
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,840
- I'm going too fast?
- No, it's so upsetting. Wait...

358
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,000
- Hey, this was nearly 50 years ago.
- But it makes me sad.

359
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,600
- You needn't feel sad.
- But I do. It makes me sad.

360
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,000
I just think it's so bloody awful.

361
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,800
The first time we met, I was dazzled.
I couldn't believe such a person existed.

362
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,400
There was something mysterious
in his expression.

363
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,360
He had a brightness to him.

364
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,880
But although he was only a teenager,
I could also sense a dark side.

365
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,520
It gave him a three-dimensional appeal.
I remember how it really attracted me.

366
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,520
He was the original idol.
He started the whole idol culture.

367
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,480
He had this dark side too, although
he was acknowledged by Visconti.

368
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,920
That was an asset for Björn,
at the same time a burden to him.

369
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:42,800
There are actors like that in Japan,
who had Kurosawa's recognition

370
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,640
and suffered throughout their careers
due to it.

371
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,720
This may sound exaggerated,
but one could call it his fate.

372
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,440
So, we told him that we'd really love
to cut a record with him.

373
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,360
I was born for love

374
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,200
Upon that day
there I was

375
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,480
Japanese is not an easy language.

376
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Yet he had a great ear and soon
learned to sing Japanese naturally.

377
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,200
Why do the world's flowers blossom
when we are together?

378
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,560
Sony wanted to use one of the songs
for a Japanese commercial.

379
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,080
For you who cried...

380
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,920
The heart beats.

381
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,880
Love awakens.

382
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,240
Meiji Chocolate. Excel!

383
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,840
A stirring in my heart

384
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,440
had me feeling this love

385
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,000
Nonetheless it was pure

386
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
For you who cried those sweet tears

387
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,400
Jessica!

388
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,680
- Jessica?
- Yes?

389
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,520
What's the time?

390
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,200
- You need to get up.
- Jess...

391
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,520
Jessica...

392
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,680
Jessica!

393
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,880
- Was it at eleven...or twelve?
- Eleven.

394
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,640
It's quarter past.

395
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,520
When it comes to shojo manga,
comics for girls,

396
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,960
a beautiful face
is the most important thing.

397
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,160
When the film was released,

398
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,080
I was amazed to find out
that such a person even existed.

399
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,960
I couldn't believe
that anyone could be that beautiful.

400
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,080
A human is born, they grow up
and there is a moment in their life

401
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,920
when their beauty is in full bloom.

402
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,880
This film managed to catch him,

403
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:27,640
in that exact moment when he was
at the most beautiful he would ever be.

404
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,560
Good afternoon. Nice to meet you.

405
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,160
Björn's face was to inspire a whole
generation of manga cartoonists.

406
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,040
In 1971, Riyoko Ikeda
was a young, radical feminist.

407
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,320
She became one of Japan's
greatest manga artists.

408
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,480
I think all we manga artists are inspired
by him on a deeper level.

409
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,080
Each one of us, but in different ways.

410
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,160
Lady Oscar in my manga,
"The Rose of Versailles",

411
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,520
is a girl who dresses as a boy.

412
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,520
The character is entirely based
on Björn. He was the model.

413
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:30,200
I've been drawing it
for forty or forty-five years.

414
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,080
Do that, André.
I don't want anything to happen to you.

415
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,840
I'm going, Oscar.

416
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,720
If to love is to suffer
let me suffer

417
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,360
until the day
you understand

418
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,040
and realise how I feel

419
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,120
You're the light
and I'm the shadow...

420
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,480
There is a kind of sadness in his face.

421
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,480
All we did see was the appearance
of Björn Andrésen.

422
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,960
So I always wondered
if our perception of him...

423
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
...actually hurt him.

424
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:27,840
But now I feel
that we also saw his inner self.

425
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,280
I have never seen myself as an actor.

426
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:52,160
Things have just happened.

427
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,600
I went to drama school.
I got a lot of casting, once I'd left -

428
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,560
good film parts, TV work, stage work.

429
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:16,560
Everything went well in terms
of my career. But it didn't help me...

430
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:20,200
...with my inner darkness.

431
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,040
I don't think anyone
has ever watched this.

432
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,080
I remember the last time I saw her.

433
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,760
She must have got off
the number 10 tram.

434
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,200
We were on our way to school one day
and there she stood, waving away.

435
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,960
We waved back. And she waved.

436
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,560
And we waved back.
Even at that point, I thought:

437
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,920
"This is the last time I'll ever see her."

438
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,680
People were wondering
where Barbro had got to.

439
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,200
Someone would say:
"She's become a nun."

440
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:14,760
Or: "She's gone abroad."
Stuff like that.

441
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,040
Anything but the truth.

442
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,720
Here, Mum has disappeared.
She hasn't been found yet.

443
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:42,840
It was our teacher, Lisbeth Axelsson, at
Adolf Fredrik's Music School who wrote:

444
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:50,040
"Björn Andrésen has much difficulty
concentrating and is very talkative.

445
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,440
"To some extent, the same applies
to Annike. Grateful for help."

446
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,920
I think it was because...

447
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,320
...we were deeply affected...

448
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,560
...obviously, by Mum's disappearance,
and we didn't know what had happened.

449
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,000
We were both of us born in 1955.

450
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,520
You were born in January,
and I was born in December.

451
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,960
We have the same mother,
but different fathers.

452
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,720
In Denmark, they call that "semi twins".

453
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:39,040
Throughout our childhood
you and I were closer

454
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,400
than I was to any friend
or you were to any of your friends.

455
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
We were really close.

456
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,000
I don't ever remember being without you.
It was always just the two of us.

457
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,040
I remember one day the doorbell ringing
at Granny and Grandpa's house.

458
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,320
I went out. I think you were there too.
Two policemen were standing there.

459
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,600
And they told us...

460
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,520
They had found Mum dead in the woods.

461
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,600
And ever since,
since that day, since that hour,

462
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:40,040
no one ever mentioned Mum again.
Not a single word was said about her.

463
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,920
Nobody ever spoke to me,
or as I remember it, to us, about Mum -

464
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,480
about her having died, her having existed
at all, or about how we were feeling.

465
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,960
Not a single word, ever.

466
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,320
She was a seeker.

467
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,560
A bohemian,
an artistic soul, as they say.

468
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:22,640
She was a photographer, she wrote
poetry, she painted, she was a journalist.

469
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,880
She had an art gallery...

470
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,240
And, added to all that,
she even did modelling for Dior!

471
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:38,480
She took my sister and me
on a year-long trip through Europe

472
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,640
before we'd even started going to school.

473
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,560
And her woman chum came too - Silva.

474
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,280
Mum's biggest secret was
who Björn's father was.

475
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,720
That was something she kept secret.

476
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,880
Did Mum ever mention anything

477
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,640
about anyone who might have been
my dad? Because I still don't know.

478
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:18,640
- You still don't know? Oh, dear!
- "Oh, dear"?

479
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:21,680
- Just forget about it!
- I see...

480
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,000
- I'm just to forget about it?
- Yes, I think so.

481
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:29,000
- But it's an interesting subject.
- Right.

482
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,360
- Yet she never told you about him?
- No, not about who it was. Unfortunately.

483
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,000
I see...

484
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,920
Right....

485
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,320
- Hi, Björn!
- Hello there.

486
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,040
Hang on - I'll just put my coffee
in the microwave.

487
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,440
- How did it go last night?
- Fine. I went on my own.

488
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:06,680
And... What about Peter?

489
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,840
- Sorry?
- What about Peter?

490
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,960
- Peter who?
- You wrote about someone called Peter.

491
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,800
- Peter...?
- Yeah.

492
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,840
Who "appreciates your company".

493
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,600
- Oh, you mean Peter Dixon!
- Okay.

494
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:30,080
We were at the Carmen restaurant a few
days ago. At least he appreciates me.

495
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,480
You didn't want to hang out with me,
so I hang out with my friends instead.

496
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:37,160
- Mm.
- Shouldn't I?

497
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:42,240
I'm not sure. You write
that there's a new man in your life.

498
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,000
Right. I'm wondering if I should go
for that. Or is it we that should?

499
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,200
There is someone else
and he's serious about me.

500
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:58,240
So, should I let that chance go
while you're acting the paranoid geezer?

501
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:04,200
You shield the entry code so I won't see
when we're on the far side of the planet.

502
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,280
And we bath together in the same tub.
I file your nails for you. We share a bed.

503
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:13,320
We touch each other's bodies, yet
you still keep your entry code secret.

504
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,040
So I wonder if you're
the right man for me,

505
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,200
when there's another man
who really wants me.

506
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,720
So, should I really go for you?
That's my big question.

507
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,880
Especially when you behave
like a damn pig!

508
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:32,040
- In what way have I behaved like a pig?
- In what way? You are a pig, Björn!

509
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:37,440
You were a pig in Japan. Always using
my phone. Not paying for anything.

510
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,400
Keeping me more or less under house
arrest in the hotel room for two days.

511
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,440
- Wait a minute, none of this...
- Not even giving me your entry code!

512
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,320
I have done so much for you,
you ungrateful bloody bastard!

513
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,240
Okay...

514
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,000
Okay, how am I to sort this out?

515
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,920
All children born out of wedlock
after 1917

516
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,920
were allocated a child welfare officer,
who was most often a woman.

517
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,240
These officers were meant
to support the unmarried mother

518
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,000
and also help establish
who the father was.

519
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,200
This is the file on you.

520
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:08,200
We have another file, too,
from police records this time.

521
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,200
It's about your mother's disappearance.

522
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,080
- Okay. All right.
- Yes.

523
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,120
It can be somewhat tough
to read, naturally.

524
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:25,200
So it's up to you
if you want to look at it now

525
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:29,280
or have copies made, to read
in the peace and quiet of your own home.

526
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:33,200
In police investigation records like these

527
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,880
there are often photographs -

528
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,240
for example here, shots of the scene
where your mother was found.

529
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,520
I've removed them for the time being

530
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,040
as I don't want them
suddenly to confront you.

531
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,320
That's very considerate of you.

532
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:53,280
They do exist,
but I've kept them separate.

533
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,160
So, this is text describing things.

534
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,600
Post-mortem...

535
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,240
DEATH CERTIFICATE

536
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:09,800
I've seen all this in my mind's eye
ever since that day.

537
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,520
But this is too explicit.

538
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,520
- Would you show me out, please?
- Of course.

539
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,920
"On Monday, 2 May 1966, at 19:30 hrs,
it was reported

540
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:32,680
"that the body of a female had been
found in the woodlands near Stene Farm"

541
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,640
"She was concealed
under dense fir foliage

542
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,680
"lying on her right side,
her head on a root.

543
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:45,240
"Her head was bare.

544
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,920
"However, for protection she had pulled
her coat collar up over her head."

545
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,200
"Documents in the handbag
identified the woman

546
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:59,280
"as Mrs Barbro Elisabeth Andrésen,

547
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:03,080
"reported missing
since October last year."

548
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,800
17 October, 1962.

549
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,720
SECRET...

550
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,040
- Auntie here.
- Hello?

551
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,400
Is Annike coming over to see me
on Saturday?

552
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,160
Don't you think they should come over?

553
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:27,200
You call me and ask: "How are you?"

554
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,200
And: "Are the children asleep,
or maybe out somewhere?"

555
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,120
- And: "Could I speak to them?"
- Yes?

556
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,880
You could just as well
speak to me, right?

557
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,040
You brood too much about things.
Don't complicate it all.

558
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,640
- That's a ridiculous thing to say.
- Saying what?

559
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:53,520
It doesn't work like that!
I can only be the way I am.

560
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:57,200
And when people don't allow me
to be myself...

561
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,720
- ...it makes me strange and "wrong".
- Who doesn't allow you?

562
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,520
You, for example,
don't let me be myself.

563
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:10,920
- You want me to be a certain way.
- I don't see what you mean at all.

564
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,520
I really don't understand you today.
Not at all.

565
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,000
- Shall we hang up then?
- Might as well.

566
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,440
Okay. Bye.

567
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,040
"Be still, no more harsh words.

568
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,480
"There's not much left of me.
Don't cry over me.

569
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,960
"There's no longer any fire to put out.
Don't look at me.

570
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,880
"I'm about to crumble.
I'll fall apart at any moment.

571
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,240
"I don't want you to see me fall apart.

572
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,240
"Don't cry for me.
There's no fire left to put out now.

573
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:22,040
"I've given away all I ever had.

574
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,000
"I haven't kept anything to live by.

575
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,640
"That's why I'm becoming
more and more invisible.

576
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:36,040
"But I'm not going to die.
What remains: a door.

577
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,280
"What else can I do
but leave a room within myself?

578
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:45,600
"I don't die, I just disappear.

579
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:51,880
"Perhaps, my worry - I'll reawaken
to certainty and doubt.

580
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:56,000
"Then I will return,
to look for you."

581
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:14,040
That was probably, in a sense,
her farewell letter.

582
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,880
She sat in her room

583
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,840
with a bottle of cheap red wine and
a packet of Chesterfield in front of her.

584
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:03,000
She chain-smoked.

585
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:07,560
She just sat there in silence,
staring out of the window, into the night.

586
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:14,560
I can recall standing behind her.

587
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,880
I remember thinking:

588
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,600
"When I grow up,
I'm going to save Mum."

589
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,080
We don't see each other when he's...

590
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,960
...at his lowest.

591
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:49,520
When I was a child,

592
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,160
there were long periods
when he didn't answer the phone.

593
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,040
Though now that I'm older,
he might pick up.

594
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:02,680
But he'll tell me
it's "not a good time at the moment".

595
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:09,200
There are details about Dad's life
that a child shouldn't be aware of.

596
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:14,640
And when I was 14, or so,

597
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,960
Dad started to open this door a little,
and he told me things.

598
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,520
I think it was around that time

599
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,000
that I found out more
about the Death in Venice film.

600
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:36,360
I think a lot has to do
with his mum's death.

601
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,000
It makes you wonder...
If she'd been alive, functioning normally,

602
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:45,720
how would...?

603
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:52,320
The whole Death in Venice experience
probably wouldn't have hit him as hard,

604
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:58,760
if he'd had a mum or dad he could trust -
someone there for him.

605
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,000
In theory, he's an amazing dad.
But in practice, it just doesn't work.

606
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,160
I wanted him to be there,

607
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:15,480
to love me and play with me,
the whole time,

608
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,240
like any daughter
would want her dad to be.

609
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,560
Actually, at one juncture
you seemed to have disappeared.

610
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,600
We even thought
you might be dead at one point.

611
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,360
Today, we take great pleasure
in welcoming Björn Andrésen

612
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,720
for an exclusive interview
for our French audience.

613
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:47,680
You might remember him as the guy
who incarnated the young Tadzio,

614
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:51,200
in Luchino Visconti's
famous film Death in Venice.

615
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:55,240
To us, it was
an almost mythical character.

616
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,560
In our memories, we retain the image
of this magnificent young teenage boy.

617
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:08,640
At that point, did it contribute
to a different relationship with men?

618
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:12,480
- From my side?
- Yes.

619
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,240
Like the gay community, for example.
Did you feel they were interested in you?

620
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:20,520
- That they looked at you...
- Oh, yes.

621
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:26,400
That you became this myth,
this symbol of male beauty.

622
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,200
Well, let me start...

623
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:34,720
What's the question?
If there was any change, before or after?

624
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,600
Because the gay community...

625
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:41,880
It started there.
I mean, I've been quite...

626
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:50,360
I came here in 1976 to do a film.

627
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,320
It came to nothing,
but I stayed for a year.

628
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:58,600
A Monsieur Durant, among others,
paid for everything.

629
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:04,240
He'd found me an apartment
on Rue de Seine, everything arranged.

630
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:06,560
He paid for it all.

631
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,560
I must have been bloody naive,

632
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,720
because it was sort of like:
"Wow! Everyone's so nice."

633
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:27,240
I received these really long, long, long
love poems.

634
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:29,960
Like "Björn, je t'aime", you know.

635
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,560
Expensive lunches,
expensive dinners, gifts.

636
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:38,760
They all had really fat wallets.

637
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:45,920
I don't think they treated me
out of the kindness of a bleeding heart.

638
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,480
It was rather a sense of being...

639
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,320
I felt like some kind of wandering trophy.

640
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:00,840
I was thinking, if you're in Paris
for that long and they support you...

641
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:06,400
Did you get any money?
How often did you meet?

642
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:10,960
- Money? I got weekly pocket money.
- No! You're joking!

643
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,240
- 500 francs.
- No!

644
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,680
500 francs a week in 1976?

645
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:22,320
- About that, yes.
- Do you realise how much that was?

646
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:27,280
Maybe you were a little mascot,
someone cool to be seen with -

647
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,720
at Maxim's and the Lido.

648
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:34,080
- The most beautiful boy in the world.
- Yes, "le petit garçon de Mort à Venise."

649
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,960
I was a sex object,
or an object anyway. Big game.

650
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,080
They paid for your company, as it were.

651
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:46,800
For God's sake -
I never had any money of my own,

652
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:50,320
at least not when I was travelling
round the world.

653
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,200
It was so into my own ego.

654
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:59,560
If I'd known then what I know today,
I'd have said no to Paris.

655
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:13,000
But it's of major importance, Björn...

656
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:19,920
...in terms of who you are today
and of how you see yourself,

657
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:22,800
and of those shattered dreams,

658
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,920
and of what didn't happen, and what did.

659
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,480
You're not
an uncomplicated person, Björn.

660
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,080
Tu es très compliqué.

661
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,680
Beloved Björn...

662
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:55,920
- The love of my life.
- Do I deserve to be?

663
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:58,520
You do.

664
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,840
-Hi!
-Hello, sweetie.

665
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:07,840
- How are things?
- Same as usual.

666
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,200
Same as usual? Up or down?

667
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:15,320
In need of a pee, scared of trains,
lacking in strength.

668
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,040
- A little...
- That sounds familiar.

669
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,840
Do you realise it's eleven years,
this December, since I was last here?

670
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,360
Don't say that!

671
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,840
Has it really been that long?
I mean, this place looked...

672
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,920
I haven't had anyone visiting.

673
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,920
Not until just over a year ago,

674
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:42,320
when Jessica helped me
clean the place up.

675
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,480
All squeezed together!

676
01:14:55,120 --> 01:15:00,200
- Right, "the ugliest baby in the world."
- Is it in here, under "Births"?

677
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,560
- There it is!
- Yup.

678
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,360
"The ugliest baby in the world,
our wonderful daughter."

679
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:12,120
Thanks!

680
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,280
You're content there.

681
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:26,480
Becoming a father was the scariest thing
ever. What are fathers supposed to do?

682
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:34,680
I'd got into drama school
a few months earlier.

683
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:41,520
I felt I had to do the best
I possibly could.

684
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:44,840
And my biggest wish was

685
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:51,240
that you wouldn't have to go through
what I went through as a child.

686
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:57,120
For a family to work,
you need to be two people.

687
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:02,040
That's where it fell apart.
Too much alcohol and...

688
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:06,840
But I think I'm a healthier adult

689
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,320
due to your living apart,
than if you'd lived together.

690
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,120
- Elvin's arrived here.
- Yes.

691
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:21,040
That's when we became
"the Good family".

692
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,560
- We became "the Good family"?
- Yes.

693
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:32,240
When I was a child, even into my teens,
you often said, very often:

694
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:37,640
"If there's ever anything
you want to know, just ask me."

695
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:41,280
When you were drunk, too...
It was so cryptic -

696
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,760
I never knew what questions you meant.

697
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:49,760
Was it that you wanted me to know
what had happened?

698
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,560
I didn't want you to be lonely.

699
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,920
Also, whatever you wanted to know...

700
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:08,560
...I'd tell you, if not the truth,
then at least my side of the story.

701
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,320
You're so beautiful!

702
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,400
Sorry. Big boys don't cry.

703
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:26,520
You cry almost every time I see you.
Something always moves you.

704
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:31,000
- Yes, I'm a sensitive bugger.
- Yes, be one then!

705
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,880
- What said I?
- "What said I?"

706
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:41,200
Do you know something, Mummy?

707
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:47,880
Elvin died. He's in the flowers.
In the sky.

708
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,520
In the picture.

709
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:53,920
In the Lego.

710
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,560
And it all happened at once.

711
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,920
- Do you find it hard?
- Mm-hmm.

712
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,960
- I took your knife.
- Yes, you did.

713
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,880
"And it all happened at once."

714
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:23,320
It was 11 August, 1987,
the day after Robine's third birthday.

715
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,240
Almost three months after Elvin died.

716
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:40,680
I'd been out.

717
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:43,080
It was 17 May.

718
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,520
I'd had a late night out,
and I come home, and I fall asleep.

719
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:59,400
She's taking Robine to kindergarten.

720
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,440
And she lays him next to me in bed.

721
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:10,040
I've had far, far too little sleep.

722
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,160
And I'm as drunk as hell.

723
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:26,480
He's lying next to me, and I fall asleep.

724
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,520
Passed out.

725
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:38,240
I'm woken up by a scream, and it's her.

726
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,160
I can see him lying there.
His lips are blue.

727
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:59,000
Then we desperately,
and in vain, try to...

728
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,200
...resuscitate him.

729
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:18,960
Their diagnosis is
sudden infant death syndrome.

730
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,320
But my diagnosis is
lack of love.

731
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,320
I wasn't up to it. And he had to take
far too much responsibility.

732
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:38,560
On his tiny shoulders, he bore
the whole of our family's happiness.

733
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:44,520
But things gave way, with him.

734
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:07,120
Robine didn't only lose her little brother.
She lost her father as well.

735
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,800
I descended into depression and alcohol.

736
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,240
Self-destruction...

737
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:20,440
...in all ways imaginable.

738
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:25,680
It was an ego trip.
"Poor me, me, me" - I, me, mine.

739
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:31,480
And then you're back to being a child.

740
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:38,800
A child can't look after a child.

741
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,360
We had eight months together.

742
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:04,480
He would have been... How old?

743
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,480
He would have been 32 today.

744
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,560
I wonder how he'd have sounded...

745
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,880
...what kind of voice he would've had.

746
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,520
What about his expression?

747
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:36,000
And that would all have depended
on how I'd acted as a father.

748
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,520
Because he was my boy.

749
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,480
But the fact is, I wasn't there.

750
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:57,520
If I hadn't gone out, if I'd behaved
like an adult instead, he would be alive.

751
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,880
If I'd taken my responsibility seriously,
he'd still be alive today.

752
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,840
But everything was wrong from the start.

753
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,720
My life. Her life.

754
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,800
What's really insane
is that you get used to it.

755
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,280
You don't expect...

756
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:27,280
...that much from life.

757
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:32,560
I don't really know how to express it.
When you've lost so much,

758
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:39,360
it somehow, in its own special way,
makes life easier to live.

759
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:46,560
Okay - I missed this, I lost that. Okay.

760
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,920
I've lost so much else.

761
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,520
Elvin: 3 months.
Robine: 2 years, 4 months.

762
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,720
Sanna: 24 years, 9 months.
Björn: 31 years, 11 months.

763
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:47,240
Have you ever lain on the grass

764
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:51,440
and imagined
you're not looking into space,

765
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:55,880
but you're observing
what's down below?

766
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,080
It's a pretty awe-inspiring feeling.

767
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:09,680
I mean, when we look up at the stars,
what direction are we looking in?

768
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:16,120
Are we looking outwards, inwards,
upwards, or downwards?

769
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,560
I mean, I'm still around, I'm sitting here,

770
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,160
and everything worldly
is extremely uncertain

771
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:38,640
unless one has one's faith.

772
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:57,880
When I look at the screen test,

773
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,080
shot at his audition
for Death in Venice,

774
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,320
I find it painful.

775
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:10,280
I can deal with what it all resulted in,
and with the person he's become today.

776
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:18,320
But witnessing it there on film -
that crucial turning point...

777
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:23,320
When I see how very ill at ease he feels,

778
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:27,120
and, knowing things that other people
watching this don't know,

779
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,600
about the person he is...

780
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:34,040
We're talking about
an incredibly sensitive boy, really shy,

781
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:36,720
who doesn't even want to be there.

782
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,840
Then he's suddenly supposed to pose
without his shirt.

783
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:44,480
Nudity to him isn't...

784
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,880
He doesn't want to be naked,
doesn't want to take his clothes off.

785
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,640
That was painful to watch.

786
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:57,800
That's where I want to go back in time
and ask his granny what she's up to:

787
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,080
"Stop it! Leave the lad alone."

788
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:05,880
It's wrong. You don't do that to children.

789
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:35,760
Tadzio...? Tadzio!

790
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,680
"Be still, no more harsh words.

791
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:17,640
"There's not much left of me.

792
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,200
"Don't cry over me.

793
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,720
"There's no longer any fire to put out.

794
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:35,280
"I no longer have a sense
of what I am and what I'm not.

795
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:43,200
"I look around. Is that me?

796
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:45,640
"Or that?"

797
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,440
Tadzio!

798
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:57,640
"I'm becoming more and more invisible.

799
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,520
"I've given away all I ever had.

800
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,560
"But I'm not going to die.

801
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:11,240
"What remains: a door.

802
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:16,680
"I don't die, I just disappear.

803
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,000
"Maybe, I'll reawaken.

804
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:26,680
"Then I will return to look for you."
