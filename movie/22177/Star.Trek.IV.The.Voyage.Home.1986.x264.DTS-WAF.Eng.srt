1
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,140
What do you make of it?

2
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,950
It appears to be a probe from an intelligence unknown to us.

3
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,920
Transmit "peace" and "hello" in all known languages.

4
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,720
Get me Starfleet Command. Ready, Captain.

5
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,630
This is U.S.S. Saratoga patrolling sector five, neutral zone.

6
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,400
We're tracking a probe headed for the Terran solar system.

7
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,980
Attempts to communicate have been negative.

8
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,960
Continue tracking,

9
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,880
we will advise.

10
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,950
Roger, Starfleet.

11
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,030
Six, five, four, three, two, one...

12
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,130
Hold the image. Hold!

13
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,790
Behold the quintessential devil in these matters:

14
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,110
James T. Kirk.

15
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,370
He murdered a Klingon crew and stole their vessel.

16
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,640
But here is the real plot.

17
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,880
While we negotiated peace,

18
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,410
Kirk was developing the Genesis torpedo.

19
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,460
It was conceived by Kirk's son, and tested by the Admiral himself.

20
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,960
This energy created what is called, euphemistically, the Genesis Planet.

21
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,430
A base from which to launch the annihilation of the Klingon people.

22
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,040
We demand the extradition of Kirk. We demand justice.

23
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,650
Klingon justice is a unique point of view.

24
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,520
Genesis was perfectly named. The creation of life, not death.

25
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,760
The Klingons shed the first blood, attempting to possess its secrets.

26
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,430
Vulcans are the intellectual puppets of this Federation.

27
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,070
Klingons destroyed U.S.S. Grissom. Your men killed Kirk's son.

28
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,580
Do you deny these events? We deny nothing.

29
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,940
We must preserve our race. By committing murder?

30
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,610
Silence!

31
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,780
There will be no further outbursts from the floor.

32
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,120
I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.

33
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,130
Personal bias. His son was saved by Kirk.

34
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,660
Mr. Ambassador,

35
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,000
the Council's deliberations are over.

36
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,940
Kirk goes unpunished?

37
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,880
Admiral Kirk has been charged with violating Starfleet regulations.

38
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,070
Starfleet regulations? That's outrageous!

39
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,350
Remember this well: There shall be no peace as long as Kirk lives.

40
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,530
Captain's log, stardate 8390.

41
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,540
Three months of Vulcan exile.

42
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,890
Dr. McCoy decided upon a name

43
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,650
for our captured Klingon vessel.

44
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,550
Like the mutineers of 500 years ago, we, too, have a hard choice to make.

45
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,860
Dr. McCoy? Aye, sir.

46
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,560
Mr. Scott? Aye, sir.

47
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,580
Uhura? Aye, sir.

48
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,990
Chekov? Aye, sir.

49
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,590
Sulu? Aye, sir.

50
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,170
The commander and the crew of the late Starship Enterprise

51
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:45,270
have voted to return to Earth,

52
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:51,810
to face the consequences of their actions in the rescue of Capt. Spock.

53
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,150
Thank you all. Repair stations, please.

54
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,090
Mr. Scott, how soon can we be underway?

55
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,260
One more day. Damage control is easy.

56
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,190
Reading Klingon is hard.

57
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,240
It's bad enough to be court-martialed,

58
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,810
but to have to go home in this Klingon flea trap...

59
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,380
This flea trap has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.

60
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,670
I just wish we could cloak the stench.

61
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,840
Computer, resume testing.

62
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,390
Who said, "Logic is the cement of our civilization with

63
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,050
which we ascend from chaos"?

64
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,210
T'plana-Hath, matron of Vulcan philosophy.

65
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,510
What is the molecular formula of aluminum sulphite crystal?

66
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
Queen takes knight, rook takes queen, pawn takes rook. Checkmate.

67
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,820
Correct.What contribution to bioengineering was made on Klendth?

68
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,820
The universal atmospheric compensator.

69
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,050
Starship sensors indicate

70
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,390
it is being pursued so closely, it occupies the pursuer's space.

71
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,730
Identify object. Klingon mummification glyph.

72
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,030
What historic event took place on Earth in 1987?

73
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,270
What is Kiri-Kin-Tha's first law? Nothing unreal exists.

74
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,140
Adjust this sine wave so that antineutrons can pass through it.

75
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,910
What is Gadolinium?

76
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,560
How do you feel?

77
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:52,260
I do not understand the question. What is it, Spock?

78
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,470
I do not understand, Mother. You're half human.

79
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,870
The computer knows that. The question is irrelevant.

80
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:08,950
The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way.

81
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,180
You may not understand feelings...

82
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,880
but as my son,

83
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,990
you have them.

84
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,760
As you wish, since you deem them of value.

85
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,970
But I cannot wait here to find them... Why?

86
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,490
Where must you go?

87
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,900
I must go to Earth, to offer testimony.

88
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,010
You do this for friendship. I do it because I was there.

89
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,470
Spock... Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?

90
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,950
I would accept that as an axiom.

91
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,320
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake

92
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,930
made by your flawed, feeling,

93
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,220
human friends.

94
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,220
They have sacrificed their futures because they believed

95
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:59,890
that the good of the one, you, was more important to them.

96
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:05,770
Humans make illogical decisions. They do indeed.

97
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,380
Here it comes now.

98
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,430
What's causing that?

99
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,190
A powerful amplification wave.

100
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,660
Can we isolate the wave?

101
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,100
No, it's impacting on our systems.

102
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:42,440
Yellow alert. Shields up. Reduce closing speed.

103
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,670
Thrusters have been neutralized. Emergency thrusters.

104
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,380
No response.

105
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,990
Emergency lights.

106
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,140
Damage report? Systems down. Reserve power only.

107
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,070
Starfleet Command, this is Saratoga. Can you hear me?

108
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,300
Come in, please.

109
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,550
Thank you, sir.

110
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,290
Status report, Admiral. Not good, Mr. President.

111
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,760
The probe is heading for us, damaging everything in its path.

112
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,700
The Klingons have lost two vessels.

113
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,940
Two starships and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.

114
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,600
Neutralized? How? We don't know.

115
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,790
Get me the Yorktown.

116
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:02,220
Emergency channel 0130. Code red.

117
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,470
Since contact with the alien probe,

118
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,290
all attempts to regain power have failed.

119
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,960
It's using forms of energy

120
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,960
we do not understand.

121
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,110
Can you protect us? We're launching everything.

122
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,300
We are trying to deploy a makeshift solar sail

123
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:30,010
to generate enough power to keep us alive.

124
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,330
Systems report. Communications systems all ready.

125
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,880
Communications officer, as ready as she'll ever be.

126
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,260
Guidance has a functional interface

127
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,950
with the Federation memory bank.

128
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,550
Weapons systems and cloaking device are operational.

129
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,920
I'm impressed.

130
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,140
We're in an enemy vessel.

131
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,990
I did not wish to be shot down.

132
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,160
Engine room, report.

133
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,430
We're ready. The dilithium sequencer is now a little less primitive.

134
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,200
And I've replaced the Klingon food packs.

135
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,470
They were giving me a sour stomach. Is that what it was?

136
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,170
Prepare for departure. Everybody not going to Earth had better get off.

137
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:38,910
Saavik... this is goodbye. Yes, Admiral.

138
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,390
Thank you.

139
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,590
Sir, I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.

140
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,070
David died most bravely. He saved Spock.

141
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,730
He saved us all. I thought you should know.

142
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,650
Good day, Capt. Spock. May your journey be free of incident.

143
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:13,450
Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.

144
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,890
Permission to come aboard, Admiral.

145
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,530
Jim, Spock. Don't you remember?

146
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,040
It would not be proper to refer to you as Jim while you're in command.

147
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:35,370
Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform.

148
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,270
Station.

149
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,120
Is this a good idea? What?

150
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,420
Him, back at his post like nothing happened.

151
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,000
He's not exactly working on all thrusters.

152
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,100
It'll come back to him. Are you sure?

153
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,440
That's what I thought.

154
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,710
Mr. Sulu, take us home.

155
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,950
Thrusters functional.

156
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,430
One quarter impulse power.

157
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,850
Space dock, this is Starfleet.

158
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,020
Launch all vessels.

159
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,360
Space dock doors are inoperative. All systems are non-functional.

160
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,040
Engage reserve power.

161
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,300
Starfleet, this is space dock. We have lost all internal power.

162
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,930
Estimating planet Earth, 1.6 hours at present speed.

163
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,730
Continue on course. Any sign of Federation escort?

164
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,630
No, sir, and no Federation vessels on patrol.

165
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,740
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the com channels?

166
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,900
Very active. Multi-phasic transmissions. Almost a gibberish.

167
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,810
Let me see if I can sort it out.

168
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,120
Hi. Busy?

169
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,690
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

170
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,430
It sure is nice to have your Katra back in your head,

171
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,030
and not mine.

172
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,110
I may have carried your soul,

173
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:48,540
but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.

174
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,000
My shoes?

175
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,200
Forget it.

176
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:00,770
Perhaps we could cover a little philosophical ground.

177
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,890
Life, death, life. Things of that nature.

178
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,550
I've not yet reviewed the philosophical disciplines.

179
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,710
Come on. You really have gone

180
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:15,290
where no man has gone before.

181
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,930
Tell me what it felt like.

182
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,170
We have no frame of reference.

183
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,100
You're joking. A joke is a humorous story.

184
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:32,180
I have to die to discuss your insights on death?

185
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,650
I'm receiving a number of distress calls.

186
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,720
I don't doubt it.

187
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,220
Juneau, Alaska. Clouds increasing to 95%.

188
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,450
Tokyo, total cloud coverage.

189
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,290
Leningrad has lost all electrical power.

190
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,490
Cloud coverage 100%. Temperature decreasing rapidly.

191
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,160
What is Earth's total cloud coverage? 78.6%.

192
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,060
Starfleet emergency. Red alert.

193
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,610
Switch to planetary power reserves.

194
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,820
Even with all planetary reserves

195
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,050
we cannot survive without the sun.

196
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,320
I'm well aware of that.

197
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,930
Ambassador Sarek, I'm afraid you're trapped here with us.

198
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,040
There's no way we can answer this probe.

199
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,140
It's difficult to answer when one does not understand the question.

200
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,510
Perhaps you should transmit a planetary distress signal...

201
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,020
...while we still have time.

202
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,830
Admiral? What is it?

203
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:33,330
Overlapping distress calls and a message from the Federation.

204
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,300
On screen.

205
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,080
This is the President of the United Federation of Planets.

206
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,610
Do not approach Earth.

207
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:51,520
The transmissions of an orbiting probe are critically damaging this planet.

208
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,390
It is ionizing our atmosphere. All power sources have failed.

209
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,760
Earth-orbiting starships are powerless. The probe is vaporizing our oceans.

210
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,740
We cannot survive unless a way can be found to respond to the probe.

211
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,310
Further communications may not be possible.

212
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,600
Save your energy. Save yourselves.

213
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,850
Avoid the planet Earth at all costs. Farewell.

214
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,150
Let's hear the probe's transmission.

215
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,040
Yes, sir. On speakers.

216
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,160
What do you make of that? Most unusual.

217
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,200
An unknown form of energy of great power and intelligence,

218
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,770
unaware that its transmissions are disruptive.

219
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:23,470
I find it illogical that its intentions be hostile.

220
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,810
You think this is its way of saying, "Hi, there!" to Earth?

221
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,400
Only human arrogance would assume

222
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,580
the message must be meant for man.

223
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,520
You're suggesting the transmission is meant

224
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,200
for a life form other than man?

225
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,030
It is a possibility. The President did say it was directed at Earth's oceans.

226
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,090
The president did say it was directed at Earth's oceans.

227
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,980
Can you modify the signals accounting for density,

228
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,180
temperature and salinity.

229
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,180
I can try, sir.

230
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,440
I think I have it.

231
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,310
This is what it would sound like underwater?

232
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,370
Yes, sir.

233
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,190
Fascinating.

234
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:49,630
If my suspicion is correct, there can be no response to this message.

235
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,930
Where are you going? To test my theory.

236
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,510
Bones, you stay here. No way, I want to keep an eye on him.

237
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:20,430
As suspected, the transmissions are the songs sung by whales.

238
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,340
Whales? Specifically, humpback whales.

239
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,940
That's crazy.

240
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,030
Who would send a probe to talk to a whale?

241
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,040
Whales were on Earth far earlier than man.

242
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,150
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted.

243
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,250
They died out in the 21st century.

244
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:46,410
The alien probe could be here to determine

245
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,980
why they lost contact.

246
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,930
Could the humpback's answer to this call be simulated?

247
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,090
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.

248
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,450
Can the species be found elsewhere?

249
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,910
Humpbacks were indigenous

250
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,140
to Earth.

251
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,310
Then we have no choice.

252
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,950
We must destroy the probe.

253
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,110
To attempt to do so would be futile.

254
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,190
We can't just turn away. There must be an alternative.

255
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:24,930
There is one possibility.

256
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,590
We could attempt to find some whales.

257
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,300
You just said there aren't any, except on Earth of the past.

258
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,690
That is exactly what I said.

259
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,200
Well, in that case... Wait just a damn minute.

260
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,740
Spock, start your computations for time warp.

261
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,640
Bones, come with me.

262
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,730
We need that power to keep medical facilities functioning.

263
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:07,500
All underground storage systems have been shut down.

264
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,900
How long is this bay? About 60 feet.

265
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,000
Can you enclose it to hold water? Are you planning to take a swim?

266
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,160
Off the deep end. We've got to find some humpbacks.

267
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,470
Humpbacked people? Whales.

268
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,140
45-50 feet long, about 40 tons each.

269
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,910
You're going to try time travel in this rust bucket?

270
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,870
You'd have to slingshot around the sun to

271
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,580
pick up enough speed.

272
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:02,560
Would you prefer to do nothing? I prefer common sense.

273
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,070
We go back in time, find some whales,

274
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:08,030
then bring them forward in time,

275
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,930
and hope to hell they tell this probe to clear off?

276
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,470
That's crazy! You have a better idea?

277
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,370
Computation is in progress. Uhura, get me Starfleet Command.

278
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,380
I'm picking up a faint transmission from Admiral Kirk.

279
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,030
On screen.

280
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:43,760
Starfleet Command, this is Admiral James T. Kirk.

281
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:51,400
We have intercepted and analyzed the call of the probe.

282
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,340
Go to reserve power.

283
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,210
It is our opinion that only the extinct humpback whale

284
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:02,150
can give a proper response to the probe.

285
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,190
Stabilize.

286
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,250
Emergency reserve.

287
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,660
We are going to attempt time travel.

288
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,800
We are computing our trajectory at this time.

289
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,270
Get him back!

290
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,420
Ready to engage computer.

291
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,060
What's our target in time? Late 20th century.

292
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,920
Can you be more specific?

293
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,790
I've had to programme

294
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,250
some of the variables from memory.

295
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,370
What are the variables? Availability of fuel. Mass of the vessel.

296
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,870
Probable location of whales. In this case, the Pacific Basin.

297
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:00,600
You programmed that from memory? I have.

298
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,480
"Angels and ministers defend us." "Hamlet", act 1, scene IV.

299
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,420
No doubt about your memory. Prepare for warp speed.

300
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,780
Shields, Mr. Chekov. Shields.

301
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,390
May fortune favor the foolish.

302
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,530
Warp speed, Mr. Sulu.

303
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,200
Warp 2.

304
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,870
Warp 3. Steady as she goes.

305
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:42,180
Warp 4.

306
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:49,490
Warp 5.

307
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,490
Warp 6.

308
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,760
Warp 7.

309
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,770
Warp 8. Heat shields at maximum.

310
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,340
Warp 9!

311
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:12,310
9.2, 9.3... We need breakaway speed.

312
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,650
9.5 9.6 9.7...

313
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,580
9.8...

314
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,460
Now!

315
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,530
I should never have left him.

316
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:07,340
Jim, where are we?

317
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,200
You're talking about the end of everybody on Earth.

318
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,820
Mr. Sulu...

319
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:12,300
Mr. Sulu.

320
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:23,400
Aye, sir. What is our condition?

321
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,280
The breaking thrusters have fired. Picture, please.

322
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,090
Earth... But when? Spock?

323
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:47,200
Judging by atmospheric pollution, the latter half of the 20th century.

324
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,720
Well done, Spock.

325
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,140
We may be visible to them.

326
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,310
Quite right. Engage cloaking device.

327
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:09,650
Crossing the terminator into night. The west coast of North America.

328
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:15,530
I am receiving whale song. Put them on speakers.

329
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,940
This is strange.

330
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,050
The song is coming directly from San Francisco.

331
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:38,650
From the city? That doesn't make sense.

332
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,720
We have a serious problem.

333
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:50,760
It's these Klingon crystals. The time travel drained them.

334
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,200
They're decrystalizing. Give me a round figure.

335
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,980
24 hours, staying cloaked.

336
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,170
After that we're visible and dead in the water.

337
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:07,440
We haven't the power to break out of Earth's gravity or get home.

338
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,730
We can't stop now.

339
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,140
Can't we recrystalize the dilithium?

340
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,490
We can't even do that in the 23rd century.

341
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:30,060
Admiral, there may be a 20th century possibility.

342
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,840
I recall there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors.

343
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,010
They resulted in toxic side-effects

344
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,210
and were replaced in the fusion era.

345
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,790
But at this time, we may be able to find some.

346
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,560
But you said they were toxic.

347
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,930
We collect only high-energy photons.

348
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,690
These photons would recrystalize the dilithium structure... theoretically.

349
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,580
Where would we find these reactors?

350
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,770
They were used in naval vessels.

351
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,450
San Francisco. I was born there.

352
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,180
It doesn't look all that different.

353
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:24,160
Set us down in Golden Gate Park. Aye, sir. Descending.

354
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,630
Uhura and Chekov are assigned the uranium problem.

355
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,850
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Scott and Mr. Sulu

356
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,930
will convert us a whale tank.

357
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,270
Oh, joy!

358
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,440
while Spock and I attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.

359
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,430
I'll have bearing and distance, sir.

360
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:47,940
Be very careful, this is terra incognita.

361
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,090
Many of their customs will take us by surprise.

362
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,460
None of these people have ever seen an extraterrestrial.

363
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,990
This is a primitive and paranoid culture.

364
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,360
Take a phaser and a communicator.

365
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,830
Radio silence except in emergencies.

366
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,010
Remove your rank insignia.

367
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,230
Any questions? All right.

368
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,350
Let's do our job and get out of here.

369
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,870
Our own world is waiting for us.

370
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,540
Commence landing procedure. Aye, sir.

371
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,630
Were you two fighting again? I thought you made up.

372
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:14,200
Why are you two always fighting? I like the way she fights.

373
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,370
I told her I wasn't spending $60

374
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:19,640
on a damn toaster oven.

375
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,300
What did she say to that? Well...

376
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,170
What the hell was that?

377
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:09,380
Did you see that? No, and neither did you.

378
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:26,540
Bearing to the whales? 283 degrees, 15.2 kilometers.

379
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,080
Everybody remember where we parked.

380
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,830
Watch where you're going, dumb-ass!

381
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,200
Double dumb-ass on you!

382
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,280
It's a miracle our race survived.

383
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,780
They're still using money.

384
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:23,290
Spock. The rest of you stay here.

385
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,170
Break up, you look like a cadet review.

386
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,190
18th century American. Quite valuable.

387
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,700
You do want to part with them? How much will you give me?

388
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,590
Those were a gift from Dr. McCoy.

389
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:09,640
And they will be again.

390
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:14,480
How much? The lenses aren't intact.

391
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,990
I'll give you $100. Is that a lot?

392
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,760
That's all there is. Don't splurge.

393
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,930
All set? Good hunting.

394
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,380
Thanks to your restored memory,

395
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,440
and a little bit of good luck,

396
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,170
we're walking around San Francisco looking for humpback whales.

397
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,340
How will you solve this problem? Simple logic will suffice.

398
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,710
I will make use of this map.

399
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,950
I have the distance and bearing from Uhura.

400
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:57,250
If we juxtapose our coordinates,

401
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,060
we should be able to find our destination 283.7 degrees...

402
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,540
We'll find what we're looking for

403
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,900
at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito.

404
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,330
two humpback whales, George and Gracie.

405
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:13,810
How do you know this? Simple logic.

406
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,910
What does "exact change" mean?

407
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,130
How do we convert this tank?

408
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:42,460
If I had transparent aluminum... You're years too early for that.

409
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,800
Let's find their equivalent. But where?

410
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:59,620
Did you find it? Yes, now we need directions.

411
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,370
Now we need directions.

412
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,630
Excuse me, can you direct me to the naval base in Alameda?

413
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,890
It's where they keep the nuclear vessels.

414
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:19,930
Nuclear vessels.

415
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:27,980
Excuse us... We are looking for nuclear vessels.

416
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,780
Can you tell me where the naval base is in Alameda?

417
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,790
Hello, we are looking for the nuclear vessels in Alameda.

418
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:40,360
Can you help us? Where is the Alameda naval base?

419
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,990
Where are the nuclear vessels? Across the bay in Alameda.

420
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,040
That's what I said, Alameda.

421
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:03,780
Excuse me.

422
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:09,220
Excuse me, would you mind stopping that noise?

423
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,830
Excuse me, would you mind stopping that damn noise?

424
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:43,020
Admiral, may I ask you a question? Don't call me Admiral.

425
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,320
You used to call me Jim. What's your question?

426
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:55,230
Your use of language has altered since our arrival.

427
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,770
It is currently laced with more colorful metaphors.

428
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,240
"Double dumb-ass on you." The profanity?

429
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,820
That's the way they talk.

430
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,280
Nobody pays any attention unless you swear.

431
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:13,580
Look at the literature of the period. For example?

432
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:18,890
The works of Jacqueline Susann. The novels of Harold Robbins.

433
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,830
"The Giants".

434
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:37,770
The next showing of "The World of Whales" begins in five minutes.

435
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,950
Here I go.

436
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,520
Good morning,

437
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,300
I'm your guide this morning.

438
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,020
I'm Dr. Gillian Taylor.

439
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,940
I'm assistant director of

440
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,830
the Maritime Cetacean Institute.

441
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:06,170
The Cetacean Institute is the only museum devoted to whales.

442
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,240
We have a great deal to offer,

443
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:14,540
but that is small compared to what we don't know about whales.

444
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,520
One commonly held misconception is that whales are fish.

445
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,620
They're not. They're mammals like you and me.

446
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:26,280
Warm blooded, breathing air and producing milk to nurse their young.

447
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,930
Do whales attack people? No.

448
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:34,470
Most whales don't have teeth, they have a gum-like tissue

449
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:39,660
that strains tiny shrimp for food, and that is the limit of their hostility.

450
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,210
Unfortunately, their principal enemy is far more aggressive.

451
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,580
You mean man? To put it mildly.

452
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:52,240
Men have always harvested whales for a variety of purposes,

453
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,620
most of which can be synthesized.

454
00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:00,990
100 years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, man did plenty of damage.

455
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,690
But that is nothing compared to what he has achieved in this century.

456
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:10,070
Mankind has hunted whales to the brink of extinction.

457
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:15,110
Virtually gone is the blue whale, the largest creature on Earth.

458
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,540
Despite all attempts to ban whaling, there are still countries and pirates

459
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,980
currently engaged in the slaughter of these creatures.

460
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:30,250
Humpback whales, once numerous, now number about 10,000 specimens.

461
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,590
Those that are taken are no longer fully grown.

462
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:39,830
In addition, many of the female whales are killed with their unborn calves.

463
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,200
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.

464
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,710
Whoever said the human race was logical?

465
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:53,370
If you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the institute's pride and joy.

466
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,930
This is the largest seawater tank in the world.

467
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,120
It contains the only two humpback whales in captivity.

468
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:24,610
They are mature humpbacks weighing 45,000 pounds each.

469
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:29,720
They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here.

470
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,950
We call them George and Gracie.

471
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:38,430
It's perfect. A male and female in a tank.

472
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,760
We can beam them up together.

473
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,400
Beautiful, aren't they? And extremely intelligent.

474
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:55,010
If you'll follow me, please.

475
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,040
Despite all they're teaching us,

476
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,010
we have to return them to the open sea.

477
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,540
We simply don't have enough money

478
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,630
to feed them two tons of shrimp a day.

479
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,800
How soon? Soon.

480
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,690
It's too bad, because they're really quite friendly.

481
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,000
I've grown quite attached to them.

482
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:29,940
Now here's a much better way to see George and Gracie. Underwater.

483
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:45,320
What you're hearing is recorded whale song, sung by the male.

484
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:51,120
He'll sing anywhere from 6 to 30 minutes.

485
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,290
In the ocean, other whales will pick up the song and pass it on.

486
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,130
The songs change every year. We don't know their purpose.

487
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,470
Are they a navigational signal?

488
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,520
Are they part of the mating ritual?

489
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,750
Or is it pure communication beyond our comprehension?

490
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,930
Frankly, we just don't know.

491
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,160
Maybe he's singing to that man.

492
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,630
What the hell?! Excuse me, wait right here.

493
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,440
Excuse me, please.

494
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,680
What were you doing in there? Yes, speak up.

495
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,940
Attempting the hell to communicate.

496
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,490
You have no right to be here!

497
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,570
You heard the lady.

498
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,050
If we assumed that these whales are ours to do with

499
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:05,040
as we please,

500
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:08,970
we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.

501
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,570
I don't know what's going on,

502
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,280
but get out now, or I call the cops.

503
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,080
That's not necessary. We're trying to help.

504
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:21,880
Your friend was messing up my whales.

505
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:25,150
They like you, but they are not the hell your whales.

506
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,820
I suppose they told you that. The hell they did.

507
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:32,360
Right.

508
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,970
Spock Yes? About those colorful metaphors that we discussed.

509
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,980
You haven't quite got the knack of it.

510
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,730
Why not? You haven't quite got the knack of it.

511
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:53,040
I see. it's not always necessary to tell the truth.

512
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,320
I cannot tell a lie. I don't mean lie.

513
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,550
But you could exaggerate. You've done it before.

514
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,560
Can't you remember? The hell I can't.

515
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,570
What else did you learn? Their species is unhappy with man.

516
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:17,300
Are they going to help us? I communicated our intentions.

517
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:27,590
It's all right. I know. They didn't mean any harm.

518
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:42,460
I heard there was some excitement. Just a couple of kooks.

519
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:45,300
How are you doing? I'm fine.

520
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:50,710
Don't tell me fish stories, I've known you too long.

521
00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:54,370
Bob, it's tearing me apart.

522
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:59,540
I feel the same, but we're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

523
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,480
If we keep them here or let them go,

524
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,990
we're still risking their lives.

525
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:06,630
I know.

526
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,230
They're not human beings. Their intelligence is...

527
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:15,430
My compassion is not limited to

528
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,640
my estimation of one's intelligence.

529
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,260
Team leader, this is team two. I have the co-ordinates of the reactor.

530
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,270
Kirk here. We have found the nuclear vessel.

531
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:52,340
Well done. Admiral, it is the Enterprise.

532
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,050
Understood. What's your plan?

533
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:04,210
We will beam in tonight and collect the photons. No one will know.

534
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:07,180
Understood and approved.

535
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:10,050
Kirk out.

536
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:18,810
There she is. If we play our cards right,

537
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,570
we can find out about the whales.

538
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,210
How will playing cards help? It's Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.

539
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:32,870
Where are you fellas heading? Back to San Francisco.

540
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,180
You came all this way just for a swim?

541
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:42,550
I won't try to explain. I'll buy that.

542
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,920
What about him? He's harmless.

543
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:48,980
Back in the 60s, he was part of

544
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,830
the free-speech movement at Berkeley.

545
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:55,990
He did a little too much LDS. LDS?

546
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,280
I'll give you a lift.

547
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,920
I have a notorious weakness

548
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,470
for hard-luck cases.

549
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,010
We don't want to be any trouble. You've already been that. Come on.

550
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,900
Thank you very much.

551
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:25,660
Don't try anything. I've got a tire iron right where I can get at it.

552
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:34,130
So, you were at Berkeley? I was not.

553
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,900
Memory problems, too. Where are you from?

554
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:41,140
Iowa. A landlubber.

555
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:45,010
What the hell were you guys really trying to do back there?

556
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,250
Was it some kind of macho thing? I really hate that macho stuff.

557
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,660
Can I ask you a question? Go ahead.

558
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:01,600
What's going to happen when you release the whales?

559
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,110
They'll have to take their chances. What does that mean exactly?

560
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:14,240
They'll be at risk from whale hunters just like all other humpbacks.

561
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:17,780
What did you mean with all that stuff about extinction?

562
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:25,150
He meant what you said on the tour, that humpbacks may well disappear.

563
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,760
That's not what he said, farmboy.

564
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,130
"We would be as guilty

565
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:32,480
as those who caused,

566
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,300
" past tense, "their extinction."

567
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,840
I have a photographic memory. I see words.

568
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,700
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?

569
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:49,710
Are you some dipshit army guy trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes?

570
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,580
No dipshit. Good, I'd have let you off here.

571
00:56:56,990 --> 00:57:00,160
Gracie is pregnant.

572
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:04,860
Who are you? Don't jerk me around. How do you know that?

573
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:08,800
We can't tell you that. Let me finish.

574
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,100
We're not in the military and we intend no harm to the whales.

575
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:20,210
We may be able to help you in ways you couldn't possibly imagine.

576
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,370
Or believe, I'll bet. Very likely.

577
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:29,220
You're not catching us at our best. That much is certain.

578
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:38,500
I think we'd all be a lot happier discussing this over dinner.

579
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,830
What do you say?

580
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,240
Do you guys like Italian?

581
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,640
No. Yes.

582
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:57,010
Yes, I love Italian... and so do you.

583
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:16,960
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager.

584
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:21,200
I'm terribly sorry. There's been an awful mix-up.

585
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:25,280
I was never told about your visit.

586
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,210
I tried to clear things up.

587
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:31,210
I explained that you'd come from Edinburgh

588
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,130
to study Plexicorp's manufacturing,

589
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:37,920
but they don't know anything about it.

590
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,960
Don't know anything about it?

591
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:45,500
I've come millions of miles. Thousands!

592
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:52,630
I was invited on an inspection. I demand to see the owners.

593
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,850
Dr. Nichols has offered to

594
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:59,870
take us around the plant personally.

595
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:03,210
He has? With pleasure.

596
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:09,020
That's different. Gregory.

597
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:16,790
May my assistant join us? Of course.

598
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:22,030
Don't bury yourself in the part.

599
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:29,300
Hi. A good-looking ship. Huey 204, isn't it?

600
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,680
Right on, do you fly? Here and there.

601
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,580
I flew something similar in my Academy days.

602
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:41,420
Then this must be old stuff to you. Yes...

603
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,060
But interesting. Can I ask you a few questions?

604
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,100
This is a fine place you have here.

605
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:00,000
Thank you. Your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.

606
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,600
Back home we call him the miracle worker.

607
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,320
May I offer you something?

608
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,400
May I offer something to you?

609
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes? You're still working with polymers.

610
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,530
What else would I be working with?

611
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,700
What else indeed?

612
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,560
How thick would a piece of

613
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,900
your plexiglas need to be,

614
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:30,500
at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?

615
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:36,300
Six inches. We have it in stock. I've noticed.

616
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,800
Now, suppose...

617
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:45,000
...I were to show you a way to manufacture a wall

618
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:51,000
that would do the same job, but be only one inch thick.

619
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,100
Would that be worth something? You're joking.

620
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,700
Perhaps the professor could use your computer.

621
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,700
Computer...

622
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,300
Computer!

623
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,600
Hello, computer. Just use the keyboard.

624
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:23,200
A keyboard, how quaint!

625
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:58,600
Transparent aluminum? That's the ticket, laddie.

626
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,100
It would take years to figure out the dynamics of this matrix.

627
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:08,000
Yes, but you would be rich beyond the dreams of avarice.

628
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:14,000
So, is it worth something to you, or should I punch up "clear"?

629
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,600
No.

630
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,000
Not now, Madeline.

631
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,400
What exactly did you have in mind?

632
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,800
A moment alone, please.

633
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:44,600
Do you realize that if we give him the formula,

634
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,500
we're altering the future?

635
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:51,700
Why? How do we know he didn't invent the thing?

636
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,800
Yeah.

637
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,040
Won't you change your mind?

638
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:12,600
What is wrong with the one I have?

639
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,200
A little joke. Goodbye, old friend. Wait a minute.

640
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,800
Nobody knows that Gracie is pregnant.

641
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,800
Gracie does. I'll be right here.

642
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:33,200
Is he just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?

643
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,900
It's his way.

644
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,500
Do you trust me? Implicitly.

645
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:01,600
Large mushroom and pepperoni, with extra onions and a Michelob.

646
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:08,100
Great choice. And you, sir? Make that two.

647
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:17,500
How does a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?

648
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:25,300
Just lucky, I guess. You're upset about losing the whales.

649
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,200
You're very perceptive.

650
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,020
How will that be done, exactly?

651
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,300
They'll be flown to Alaska.

652
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,720
They'll be released there.

653
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,300
That's the last you'll see of them?

654
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,160
See, yes.

655
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,700
But we'll tag them

656
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:49,800
with special transmitters and monitor them.

657
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,100
I could take those whales somewhere...

658
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:01,200
...where they'd never be hunted.

659
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,110
You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco

660
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,000
without a lift.

661
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,610
If I'm so inept,

662
01:05:15,610 --> 01:05:17,200
how come we're having dinner?

663
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,600
I'm a sucker for hard-luck cases. Cheers.

664
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:30,700
Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy

665
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:36,300
who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you "Admiral".

666
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:43,800
Where could you take them... my whales?

667
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,130
Where would they be safe? It's not a matter of where,

668
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:50,100
but when.

669
01:05:50,300 --> 01:05:54,100
It would have to be right now. Why?

670
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:59,100
No humpback born in captivity has ever survived.

671
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:05,280
But they won't be safe at sea because of

672
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,100
all the hunting this time of year.

673
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,500
So you see, that, as they say, is that.

674
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,600
Damn.

675
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:28,100
What is that? You have a pocket pager.

676
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:33,200
Are you a doctor?

677
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,570
I told you not to call me.

678
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:39,900
Sorry, I thought you'd like to know.

679
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:45,900
We're beaming them in now. All right. Good luck. Kirk out.

680
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,300
You want to try it from the top? Tell me when the whales are leaving.

681
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,400
Who are you? Who do you think I am?

682
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,600
Don't tell me! You're from outer space.

683
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,700
I'm from Iowa, I work in outer space.

684
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:11,700
I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into this.

685
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,400
The truth? I am all ears.

686
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:29,400
Okay... the truth.

687
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,500
I am from the late 23rd century.

688
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:42,500
I've come back in time

689
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,600
to bring two humpback whales with me, in an attempt to...

690
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,300
...repopulate the species.

691
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:57,800
Why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?

692
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:03,300
You want the details? Oh, I wouldn't miss this.

693
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:09,700
When are the whales being released? Okay, what the hell.

694
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,900
Your friend was right. Gracie is pregnant, very pregnant.

695
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:18,290
At noon tomorrow, in a media circus,

696
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,500
the whales get shipped out.

697
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:25,500
Noon tomorrow? Are we leaving?

698
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,400
We don't have much time. Could we have that to go?

699
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:33,400
Sure. Who gets the bad news? They don't use money in your time?

700
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:34,920
Well, we don't.

701
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,800
How long? It depends on the shielding.

702
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,500
Well, Admiral, that was the briefest dinner I've ever had,

703
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:53,900
and certainly the biggest fish story I've ever heard.

704
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:58,500
Tell me something. The whale's transmitter, what's the frequency?

705
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:04,300
Sorry, that's classified. Look, I don't have a clue who you are.

706
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,500
You wouldn't want to show me around your spaceship, would you?

707
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,200
That wouldn't be my first choice. Well, there we are.

708
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:23,000
I am here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century.

709
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,430
I can go to the open sea to get them.

710
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,900
I'd rather have yours.

711
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:33,200
It's better for me. It's better for you. It's better for them.

712
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:37,500
Think about it.

713
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,900
Who are you? Think about it.

714
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:49,100
Don't take too long. I'm out of time.

715
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:52,900
This is where I'll be. Here?

716
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:57,300
In the park. Right.

717
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,700
The tank will be finished by morning. That's cutting it close.

718
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,600
What about team two? We're waiting for them to call.

719
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:53,800
Damn! We've been so lucky. Two perfect whales right here.

720
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,750
Now we might lose them.

721
01:11:56,750 --> 01:11:58,900
Then our mission would fail.

722
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:03,800
Our mission? You're talking about the end of every life on Earth.

723
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
You're half human. Haven't you got any feelings about that?

724
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:41,900
There it is again. That's too weird. Commander.

725
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,600
Aren't you running the test program?

726
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:47,500
We're getting a power drain.

727
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,500
It must be coming from inside the ship.

728
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,700
Commander Rogerson. Yes, Chief,

729
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,400
we're tracking that, too. What is it?

730
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:08,400
Scotty, we're ready for beam-out.

731
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:12,300
Scotty, can you hear me?

732
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,800
Confirmed. Roger that.

733
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,800
This is Commander Rogerson.

734
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:30,400
We have an intruder in number four M.M.R.

735
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:37,500
Scotty, do you read? Lass, I can hardly hear you.

736
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Power is down to minimal. I'll bring you in one at a time.

737
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,000
Take the collector. You go first.

738
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,700
Stand by.

739
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:06,500
Scotty.

740
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:09,600
Hello?

741
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:15,400
Come in, please.

742
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,200
Scotty, how soon?

743
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:25,900
Chekov, you're breaking up. Please signal again.

744
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:31,800
Can you hear me? Now would be a good time.

745
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,500
Freeze!

746
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:38,000
Chekov!

747
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,500
I've lost him.

748
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:46,600
Commander Pavel Chekov. Starfleet. United Federation of Planets.

749
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:53,100
Right, Commander, is there anything you want to tell us?

750
01:14:53,300 --> 01:15:00,300
Like what? Who you are and what these are?

751
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:04,400
I am Pavel Chekov, a commander in Starfleet.

752
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,700
Service number: 656-5827 D.

753
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,000
Let's take it from the top. The top of what?

754
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,000
Name? My name?

755
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:20,300
Play games with me, and you're through.

756
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:24,400
I am? May I go now?

757
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,500
What do you think? He's a Russkie.

758
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,630
Of course he's a Russkie,

759
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:36,500
but he's a retard or something.

760
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:42,400
Don't move. Okay, give us the ray gun.

761
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,500
If you don't lie on the floor, I will have to stun you.

762
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:51,400
Okay, stun me. I'm very sorry.

763
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,500
It must be the radiation.

764
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,100
Gangway!

765
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,100
Hit the deck!

766
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:04,100
Man down. Get a corpsman over here.

767
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,700
Any luck? Nothing. I shouldn't have left him.

768
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,500
You did what was necessary. Keep trying, you'll find him.

769
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,000
Scotty, you promised an estimate on the crystals.

770
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:25,850
It'll be well into tomorrow.

771
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,200
You've got to do better.

772
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:34,700
I'll try, sir. He's in a wee bit of a snit.

773
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,800
He's a man of deep feelings. What's new?

774
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,300
They left last night.

775
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,100
We thought it would be easier on you this way.

776
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:25,700
You sent them away without even letting me say goodbye!

777
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:34,700
Admiral! Admiral Kirk!

778
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,400
Admiral Kirk!

779
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,000
Admiral Kirk!

780
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:13,900
Admiral Kirk, can you hear me?

781
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:19,700
They're gone. I need your help. Are you in there?

782
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:23,500
Admiral, we have a problem.

783
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:28,800
Admiral Kirk!

784
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:35,100
Admiral Kirk! Can you hear me?

785
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,000
Oh, my God!

786
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,000
Hello, Alice. Welcome to wonderland.

787
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:01,800
It's true! Yes, it is.

788
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I'm glad you're here, but you picked a hell of a time to drop in.

789
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:12,700
Is this real? Yes, take a look.

790
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:22,700
Storage tanks for your whales. They're gone.

791
01:21:22,900 --> 01:21:26,000
Gone? They were taken last night.

792
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:30,800
They're in Alaska by now. Damn!

793
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,300
But you can go find them, right? I can't go anywhere.

794
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:42,300
What kind of a spaceship is this? It's a spaceship with a missing man.

795
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:47,000
Full power has been restored. Thank you, Mr. Spock.

796
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,400
Doctor, welcome aboard.

797
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:55,400
Admiral, are you there? Uhura, what's wrong?

798
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,500
I've located Chekov. They're taking him to emergency surgery.

799
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:04,000
Where? Mercy Hospital.

800
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:08,100
The Mission District. His condition is critical.

801
01:22:08,300 --> 01:22:11,100
He's not expected to survive.

802
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:21,300
Let me go in there. Don't leave him in the hands of 20th-century medicine.

803
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:27,100
I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.

804
01:22:29,900 --> 01:22:35,200
Is that the logical thing to do? No, but it is the human thing to do.

805
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,800
Right. Will you help us?

806
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,800
How? We'll have to look like physicians.

807
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,100
We'll try down here. You check there.

808
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:06,000
What's the matter? Kidney dialysis.

809
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:11,100
Dialysis? What is this, the Dark Ages?

810
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:18,100
Here, swallow that. If you have any problems, call me.

811
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:25,000
Here, I've got it.

812
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,500
Let's go.

813
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:35,070
He's being held in the security corridor one flight up.

814
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:36,600
His condition is critical.

815
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,100
Excuse me, we'll take that.

816
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:49,400
Hold the door. Emergency.

817
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,400
I was there. I heard the whole thing.

818
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,800
Weintraub said radical chemotherapy.

819
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,650
What about Gottlieb?

820
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:03,400
He talked about image therapy.

821
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,900
Unbelievable! You have a different view?

822
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:12,100
It sounds like the Spanish inquisition. Bad day.

823
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,400
Out of the way. We have orders...

824
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,620
Damn it! This is an acute case

825
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,900
of upper-abdominal distension.

826
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,300
Get out of the way!

827
01:24:30,500 --> 01:24:33,500
What did you say she's got? Cramps.

828
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,200
You aren't masked! Who are these people?

829
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:44,900
I don't know. What are you doing?

830
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:49,200
Tearing of the meningeal artery. What's your degree in, dentistry?

831
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,700
How do you explain slow pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?

832
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,500
A funduscopic examination... ...is unrevealing.

833
01:24:56,700 --> 01:25:00,600
An evacuation of the haematoma will relieve the pressure.

834
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,300
Drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired.

835
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:10,200
Put away your butcher knives and let me save this patient.

836
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:16,100
I'll have you removed. Such unprofessional behavior...

837
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:21,100
Into that little room. What is that? A gun?

838
01:25:21,250 --> 01:25:24,400
What is this? I've no idea.

839
01:25:32,700 --> 01:25:34,900
He melted the lock.

840
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:39,200
We're dealing with medievalism here.

841
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:44,900
Chemotherapy! Funduscopic examinations!

842
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:53,800
Chekov, wake up.

843
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,700
Pavel, can you hear me?

844
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:09,000
He's coming around. Pavel, talk to me.

845
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,800
Name? Rank?

846
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,900
Chekov, Pavel.

847
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Rank: Admiral.

848
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,000
How's the patient? He's going to make it.

849
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:32,200
You came in with a she. One little mistake.

850
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Get us out of here.

851
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,800
They've taken the patient.

852
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,200
Hold it!

853
01:26:57,900 --> 01:27:01,500
Not now, Pavel. Hold it.

854
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:12,200
The doctor gave me a pill and I grew a new kidney.

855
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,400
It's fully functional!

856
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:41,900
Freeze.

857
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,700
Where would the whales be by now? Do you have a chart?

858
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:53,220
Just give me the radio frequency.

859
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,000
What? I'm coming with you.

860
01:27:56,300 --> 01:27:58,510
Our next stop is the 23rd century.

861
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:00,600
So, I've got nobody here.

862
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:06,600
I've got to help those whales. I've got no time to argue.

863
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:13,200
The radio frequency, please. 401 megahertz.

864
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:17,800
Thank you... for everything.

865
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,800
Scotty, beam me up.

866
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,200
Surprise.

867
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,800
Spock, where the hell's the power? One damn minute, Admiral.

868
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I'm trying to remember how this worked. I got used to a Huey.

869
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:43,500
You tricked me. You need me.

870
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:46,500
Take a seat. Now, Mr. Sulu.

871
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,800
What was that?

872
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,700
Cloaking device is stable. All systems normal.

873
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:15,900
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing: Five by zero. Helm: Steady.

874
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:20,200
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer 310.

875
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,900
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz.

876
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,100
10,000, Admiral.

877
01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:31,000
Full impulse power.

878
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:35,300
310 to the Bering Sea. ETA: 12 minutes.

879
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:42,100
Are the whale tanks secure? Aye, but we're beaming up 400 tons.

880
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:45,400
It's not just the whales, it's the water.

881
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,700
Yes, of course.

882
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,900
Any contact? Negative.

883
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:07,300
You appear to have a problem. Your perception is correct.

884
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:10,780
In order to return us to the exact moment

885
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:13,200
we left the 23rd century

886
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,700
I calculated the time elapsed in relation to the acceleration curve.

887
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:21,600
Naturally. So what's your problem?

888
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:29,600
Acceleration is no longer a constant. Then take your best shot.

889
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,100
Best shot? Guess, Spock.

890
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:37,300
Your best guess. Guessing is not in my nature.

891
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:42,000
Well, nobody's perfect.

892
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,200
That's it! Affirmative. Contact with the whales.

893
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,300
Bearing: 327. Range: 600 nautical.

894
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:15,600
Put it on the screen. How can you do that?

895
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:29,900
I have a signal closing in on the whales, bearing 328 degrees.

896
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:33,100
Let's see it.

897
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:42,000
What kind of ship is that? A whaling ship. Are we too late?

898
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,900
Full-power descent. Aye, sir.

899
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,300
Ten seconds, sir.

900
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,900
All right, Scotty. Ten seconds, Admiral.

901
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:25,900
Five, four, three...

902
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:29,600
...two, one.

903
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:58,300
Admiral, there be whales here!

904
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:06,200
Well done. Do we have warp speed? Full power now, sir.

905
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,400
If you will, Mr. Sulu. Aye, sir. Warp speed.

906
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:20,400
Mr. Sulu, I'm going to take our guest to look at her whales.

907
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,180
How does the variable mass of whales

908
01:35:22,180 --> 01:35:24,500
fit into our re-entry program?

909
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:29,200
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures...

910
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,200
I will make a guess. A guess?

911
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,400
You, Spock? That's extraordinary.

912
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,800
I don't think he understands. No.

913
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,300
He feels safer about your guesses than most people's facts.

914
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:58,200
You're saying it is a compliment? It is.

915
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,500
Then I will make the best guess I can.

916
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:18,100
"They say the sea is cold, but the sea contains the hottest blood of all."

917
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:25,200
"Whales Weep Not", D.H. Lawrence.

918
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,200
It's ironic. When man was killing these creatures,

919
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:38,800
he was destroying his own future.

920
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,120
The beasties seem happy to see you.

921
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,800
I hope you like our aquarium.

922
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:52,700
A miracle, Mr. Scott. A miracle? That's yet to come.

923
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,800
What does that mean?

924
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,200
We might not make it. You should have stayed where you belong.

925
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:06,500
I belong here. I am a whale biologist.

926
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:09,900
Suppose by some miracle you do get them through?

927
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:15,200
Who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales?

928
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,500
Admiral, you'd better get up there. We're having a power fall off.

929
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:25,800
Stay with them. I'm on my way.

930
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:32,000
Hold on tight.

931
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,600
Warp 7.5.

932
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:45,000
7.9. Shields at maximum.

933
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:49,000
That's all I can give you.

934
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:55,000
Can we make breakaway speed? I cannot guarantee it.

935
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:59,100
I shall compensate by altering our trajectory.

936
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:05,100
Warp 8... 8.1. Maximum speed.

937
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:11,500
I need thruster control. Thrusters at Spock's command.

938
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:18,200
Steady... Steady! Now!

939
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,300
Did breaking thrusters fire? They did, Admiral.

940
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,900
Then where the hell are we?

941
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:57,600
The probe.

942
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:05,800
Condition report. Computers are non-functional.

943
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,700
The mains are down. Aux. Power is not responding.

944
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,500
Switch to manual control. I have no control, sir.

945
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:23,600
Where are we? Out of control and blind as a bat.

946
01:39:23,800 --> 01:39:26,900
Get him back.

947
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:35,200
Look! They're heading for the bridge.

948
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:52,500
Keep the nose up if you can.

949
01:40:09,700 --> 01:40:12,700
We're in the water. Blow the hatch.

950
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:21,700
Now all we have to do is get the whales out of here.

951
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:25,400
Scotty, do you hear me?

952
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:29,600
Move! See to the safety of all hands.

953
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:07,900
Lassie, get my arm. I've got it.

954
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,300
Admiral, help! I'm here, Scotty.

955
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:27,900
You're going to be all right. The whales are trapped.

956
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:31,700
There's no power to the bay door. Explosive override?

957
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:34,900
It's underwater. We can't reach it.

958
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:38,300
You go on ahead. Close the hatch.

959
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,300
You'll be trapped. Go on!

960
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Do you see them?

961
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,900
There!

962
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:44,400
Why don't they answer? Why don't they sing?

963
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:06,900
Mr. President, we have power.

964
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:19,900
The Council is now in session.

965
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:23,700
If you will all take your seats.

966
01:48:23,900 --> 01:48:27,200
Bring in the accused.

967
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:42,500
Capt. Spock, you do not stand accused.

968
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:46,400
Mr. President, I stand with my shipmates.

969
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:49,100
As you wish.

970
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:51,800
The charges are...

971
01:48:52,100 --> 01:48:57,800
Conspiracy. Assault on Federation officers.

972
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Theft of Federation property, namely the Starship Enterprise.

973
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:07,400
Sabotage of the U.S.S. Excelsior.

974
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:14,600
Destruction of Federation property, specifically the U.S.S. Enterprise.

975
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:22,100
And finally, disobeying direct orders of the Starfleet Commander.

976
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:27,300
Admiral Kirk, how do you plead?

977
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:32,300
On behalf of all of us, I'm authorized to plead guilty.

978
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,300
So entered.

979
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:43,100
Because of mitigating circumstances, all charges but one are dismissed.

980
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:48,600
The charge of disobeying orders of a superior officer

981
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,900
is directed solely at Admiral Kirk.

982
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:58,800
I'm sure the Admiral will recognize the necessity for discipline?

983
01:50:00,200 --> 01:50:03,300
I do, sir. James T. Kirk...

984
01:50:03,500 --> 01:50:09,700
It is the judgment of this council that you be reduced in rank to captain.

985
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:13,300
As a consequence of your new rank,

986
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:19,500
you will be given the duties for which you have demonstrated great ability.

987
01:50:19,700 --> 01:50:22,800
The command of a starship.

988
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,900
Silence.

989
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:35,000
You and your crew have saved this planet from its own short-sightedness.

990
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:38,600
We are forever in your debt.

991
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,800
I'm so happy for you.

992
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,900
Thank you so much.

993
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,100
Wait a minute, where are you going? You have your ship, I have mine.

994
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:31,100
Science vessel. I've got 300 years of learning to do.

995
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:35,800
You mean, this is goodbye? Why does it have to be goodbye?

996
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:41,200
Like they say in your century, I don't even have your phone number.

997
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:50,000
How will I find you? Don't worry... I'll find you.

998
01:51:55,500 --> 01:51:58,600
See you around the galaxy.

999
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,300
Father.

1000
01:52:14,500 --> 01:52:19,200
I am returning to Vulcan within the hour. I'd like to take my leave of you.

1001
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:26,900
It was kind of you to make this effort. It was no effort. You are my son.

1002
01:52:27,100 --> 01:52:33,000
Besides, I am most impressed with your performance in this crisis.

1003
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,900
Most kind.

1004
01:52:36,100 --> 01:52:40,600
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet.

1005
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,900
It is possible that judgment was incorrect.

1006
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:49,000
Your associates are people of good character.

1007
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:52,200
They are my friends.

1008
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,800
Yes, of course.

1009
01:52:57,100 --> 01:53:02,200
Any message for your mother? Yes.

1010
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,900
Tell her... I feel fine.

1011
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:15,300
Live long and prosper, Father. Live long and prosper, my son.

1012
01:53:45,900 --> 01:53:50,000
The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe.

1013
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:56,100
We'll get a freighter. I'm counting on "Excelsior".

1014
01:53:56,300 --> 01:54:00,700
Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?

1015
01:54:00,900 --> 01:54:06,400
A ship is a ship. Whatever you say, sir. Thy will be done.

1016
01:54:32,500 --> 01:54:36,700
My friends... we've come home.

1017
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:54,600
Helm ready, Captain. All right, let's see what she's got.
