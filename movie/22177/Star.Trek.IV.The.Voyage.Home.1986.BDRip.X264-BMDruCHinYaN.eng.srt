1
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:23,772
What do you make of it?

2
00:03:26,492 --> 00:03:30,537
It appears to be a probe from an
intelligence unknown to us.

3
00:03:30,747 --> 00:03:34,329
Transmit ''peace'' and ''hello''
in all known languages.

4
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,792
- Get me Starfleet command.
- Ready, captain.

5
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:44,167
This is U.S.S. Saratoga patrolling
sector five, neutral zone.

6
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:48,964
We're tracking a probe
headed for the Terran solar system.

7
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:53,511
Attempts to communicate
have been negative.

8
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,476
Continue tracking, we will advise.

9
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,477
Roger, Starfleet.

10
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:21,797
Six, five, four, three, two, one...

11
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:47,695
hold the image. hold!

12
00:04:48,866 --> 00:04:54,702
Behold the quintessential devil
in these matters: James T. kirk.

13
00:04:54,914 --> 00:05:00,039
he murdered a klingon crew
and stole their vessel.

14
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:03,123
But here is the real plot.

15
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:10,053
While we negotiated peace, kirk
was developing the Genesis torpedo.

16
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:15,388
It was conceived by kirk's son,
and tested by the Admiral himself.

17
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:20,429
This energy created what is called,
euphemistically, the Genesis Planet.

18
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:26,153
A base from which to launch
the annihilation of the klingon people.

19
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:30,609
We demand the extradition of kirk.
We demand justice.

20
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:35,154
klingon justice
is a unique point of view.

21
00:05:41,377 --> 00:05:46,751
Genesis was perfectly named.
The creation of life, not death.

22
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:53,133
The klingons shed the first blood,
attempting to possess its secrets.

23
00:05:53,347 --> 00:05:58,056
Vulcans are the intellectual puppets
of this Federation.

24
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:03,643
klingons destroyed U.S.S. Grissom.
Your men killed kirk's son.

25
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:08,152
- Do you deny these events?
- We deny nothing.

26
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:12,656
- We must preserve our race.
- By committing murder?

27
00:06:14,786 --> 00:06:16,280
Silence!

28
00:06:17,205 --> 00:06:20,324
There will be no further outbursts
from the floor.

29
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:24,586
I have come to speak
on behalf of the accused.

30
00:06:24,796 --> 00:06:28,628
Personal bias.
his son was saved by kirk.

31
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:34,714
Mr Ambassador,
the counciI's deliberations are over.

32
00:06:34,931 --> 00:06:36,555
kirk goes unpunished?

33
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:42,520
Admiral kirk has been charged
with violating Starfleet regulations.

34
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,645
Starfleet regulations?
That's outrageous!

35
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:53,028
Remember this well: There shall be
no peace as long as kirk lives.

36
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:10,168
Captain's log, stardate 8390.

37
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,790
Three months of Vulcan exile.

38
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:19,298
Dr McCoy decided upon a name
for our captured klingon vessel.

39
00:07:21,352 --> 00:07:26,014
Like the mutineers of 500 years ago,
we, too, have a hard choice to make.

40
00:07:26,232 --> 00:07:33,729
Dr Mccoy, Mr Scott, Uhura,
chekov, Sulu...

41
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:36,154
Aye, sir.

42
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:41,658
The commander and the crew
of the late Starship Enterprise

43
00:07:41,873 --> 00:07:44,743
have voted to return to Earth,

44
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,001
to face the consequences of their
actions in the rescue of capt. Spock.

45
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:55,258
Thank you all.
Repair stations, please.

46
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,673
Mr Scott, how soon
can we be underway?

47
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,893
One more day.
Damage control is easy.

48
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,855
Reading klingon is hard.

49
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:14,937
It's bad enough
to be court-martialled,

50
00:08:15,156 --> 00:08:18,073
but to have to go home
in this klingon flea trap...

51
00:08:18,284 --> 00:08:23,954
This flea trap has a cloaking device
that cost us a lot.

52
00:08:45,728 --> 00:08:48,765
computer, resume testing.

53
00:08:53,027 --> 00:08:55,316
T'plana-hath,
matron of Vulcan philosophy.

54
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,444
What is the molecular formula
of aluminium sulphite crystal?

55
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:05,825
Queen takes knight, rook takes
queen, pawn takes rook. Checkmate.

56
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,282
Correct.

57
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:13,163
The universal
atmospheric compensator.

58
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,381
- ldentify object.
- klingon mummification glyph.

59
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,633
What historic event took place
on Earth in 1987?

60
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,135
- What is kiri-kin-Tha's first law?
- nothing unreal exists.

61
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:32,810
Adjust this sine wave so that
antineutrons can pass through it.

62
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:35,481
What is Gadolinium?

63
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:38,067
How do you feel?

64
00:09:41,534 --> 00:09:43,242
How do you feel?

65
00:09:47,373 --> 00:09:51,205
- I do not understand the question.
- What is it, Spock?

66
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:58,082
- I do not understand, Mother.
- You're half human.

67
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:02,512
- The computer knows that.
- The question is irrelevant.

68
00:10:03,347 --> 00:10:08,424
The retraining of your mind
has been in the Vulcan way.

69
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:15,608
You may not understand feelings...
but as my son, you have them.

70
00:10:15,818 --> 00:10:19,104
As you wish,
since you deem them of value.

71
00:10:19,322 --> 00:10:24,529
But I cannot wait here
to find them... I must go to Earth.

72
00:10:24,744 --> 00:10:30,367
- To offer testimony.
- You do this for friendship.

73
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:32,077
- I do it because I was there.

74
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:38,959
Spock...Does the good of the many
outweigh the good of the one?

75
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,879
I would accept that as an axiom

76
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:44,879
Then you stand here alive
because of a mistake

77
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:48,798
made by your flawed,
feeling, human friends.

78
00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:52,805
They have sacrificed their futures
because they believed

79
00:10:53,022 --> 00:10:58,479
that the good of the one, you,
was more important to them.

80
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:05,398
- humans make illogical decisions.
- They do indeed.

81
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,953
here it comes now.

82
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:31,806
- What's causing that?
- A powerful amplification wave.

83
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:36,765
- can we isolate the wave?
- no, it's impacting on our systems.

84
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:42,064
Yellow alert. Shields up.
Reduce closing speed.

85
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,194
- Thrusters have been neutralised.
- Emergency thrusters.

86
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:47,903
no response.

87
00:11:50,788 --> 00:11:53,742
Emergency lights.

88
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:58,620
- Damage report?
- Systems down. Reserve power only.

89
00:12:05,386 --> 00:12:08,589
Starfleet command, this is Saratoga.
can you hear me?

90
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:12,851
come in, please.

91
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,443
Thank you, sir.

92
00:12:29,994 --> 00:12:33,908
- Status report, Admiral.
- not good, Mr President.

93
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:40,326
The probe is heading for us,
damaging everything in its path.

94
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:43,334
The klingons have lost two vessels.

95
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,504
Two starships and three smaller
vessels have been neutralised.

96
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,136
- neutralised? how?
- We don't know.

97
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:53,388
Get me the Yorktown.

98
00:12:55,812 --> 00:13:00,141
Emergency channel 0 1 30. Code red.

99
00:13:02,193 --> 00:13:09,109
Since contact with the alien probe, all
attempts to regain power have failed.

100
00:13:09,325 --> 00:13:12,409
It's using forms of energy
we do not understand.

101
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,285
- can you protect us?
- We're launching everything.

102
00:13:18,626 --> 00:13:22,754
We are trying to deploy
a makeshift solar sail

103
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:29,583
to generate enough power
to keep us alive.

104
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,864
- Systems report.
- communications systems all ready.

105
00:13:51,075 --> 00:13:54,824
communications officer,
as ready as she'll ever be.

106
00:13:55,663 --> 00:14:00,539
Guidance has a functional interface
with the Federation memory bank.

107
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,002
Weapons systems
and cloaking device are operational.

108
00:14:04,213 --> 00:14:06,336
I'm impressed.

109
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:11,840
We're in an enemy vessel.
I did not wish to be shot down.

110
00:14:12,055 --> 00:14:13,798
Engine room, report.

111
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,973
We're ready. The dilithium sequencer
is now a little less primitive.

112
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:22,935
And I've replaced
the klingon food packs.

113
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,981
- They were giving me a sour stomach.
- Is that what it was?

114
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:31,655
Prepare for departure. Everybody
not going to Earth had better get off.

115
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:37,987
- Saavik... this is goodbye.
- Yes, Admiral.

116
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,913
Thank you.

117
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:47,203
Sir, I have not had the opportunity
to tell you about your son.

118
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:53,673
David died most bravely.
he saved Spock.

119
00:14:53,888 --> 00:14:57,423
he saved us all.
I thought you should know.

120
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:09,234
Good day, capt. Spock.
May your journey be free of incident.

121
00:15:09,445 --> 00:15:11,983
Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.

122
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:19,369
Permission to come aboard, Admiral.

123
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,242
Jim, Spock. Don't you remember?

124
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,540
It would not be proper to refer to you
as Jim while you're in command.

125
00:15:28,756 --> 00:15:35,008
Also, I must apologise for my attire.
I seem to have misplaced my uniform.

126
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,848
Station.

127
00:15:44,021 --> 00:15:46,559
- Is this a good idea?
- What?

128
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:50,190
him, back at his post
like nothing happened.

129
00:15:50,403 --> 00:15:54,697
he's not exactly
working on all thrusters.

130
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:58,659
- It'll come back to him.
- Are you sure?

131
00:16:05,043 --> 00:16:07,415
That's what I thought.

132
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:14,290
Mr Sulu, take us home.

133
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:18,465
Thrusters functional.

134
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:29,102
One quarter impulse power.

135
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:56,758
Space dock, this is Starfleet.
Launch all vessels.

136
00:16:56,969 --> 00:17:02,640
Space dock doors are inoperative.
All systems are non-functional.

137
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,889
Starfleet, this is space dock.
We have lost all internal power.

138
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:05,495
Estimating planet Earth,
1 .6 hours at present speed.

139
00:18:05,705 --> 00:18:09,240
continue on course.
Any sign of Federation escort?

140
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:13,243
no, sir,
and no Federation vessels on patrol.

141
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,213
That's odd.
Uhura, what's on the com channels?

142
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:24,262
Very active. Multi-phasic
transmissions. Almost a gibberish.

143
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:27,428
Let me see if I can sort it out.

144
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,726
hi. Busy?

145
00:18:31,939 --> 00:18:34,395
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.

146
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:42,607
It sure is nice to have your katra
back in your head, and not mine.

147
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:48,116
I may have carried your soul,
but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.

148
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,074
My shoes?

149
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:54,161
Forget it.

150
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:00,290
Perhaps we could cover
a little philosophical ground.

151
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,638
Life, death, life.
Things of that nature.

152
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:08,133
I've not yet reviewed
the philosophical disciplines.

153
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:14,685
come on. You really have gone
where no man has gone before.

154
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:20,937
- Tell me what it feIt like.
- We have no frame of reference.

155
00:19:22,323 --> 00:19:27,744
- You're joking.
- A joke is a humorous story.

156
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:31,738
I have to die
to discuss your insights on death?

157
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:35,291
I'm receiving
a number of distress calls.

158
00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:37,958
I don't doubt it.

159
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:10,703
Juneau, Alaska.
clouds increasing to 95%.

160
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:16,032
Tokyo, total cloud coverage.

161
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:19,787
Leningrad has lost all electrical power.

162
00:20:20,006 --> 00:20:23,920
cloud coverage 1 00%.
Temperature decreasing rapidly.

163
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:28,596
- What is Earth's total cloud coverage?
- 7 8.6% .

164
00:20:28,806 --> 00:20:35,094
Starfleet emergency. Red alert.
Switch to planetary power reserves.

165
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:46,565
Even with all planetary reserves
we cannot survive without the sun.

166
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,822
I'm well aware of that.

167
00:20:52,997 --> 00:20:57,326
Ambassador Sarek, I'm afraid
you're trapped here with us.

168
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:01,078
There's no way
we can answer this probe.

169
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:06,173
It's difficuIt to answer when one
does not understand the question.

170
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:14,385
Perhaps you should transmit
a planetary distress signal...

171
00:21:15,478 --> 00:21:17,934
..while we still have time.

172
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:28,324
- Admiral?
- What is it?

173
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:33,076
Overlapping distress calls
and a message from the Federation.

174
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:42,536
This is the President
of the United Federation of Planets.

175
00:21:42,755 --> 00:21:45,080
Do not approach Earth.

176
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:51,135
The transmissions of an orbiting probe
are critically damaging this planet.

177
00:21:51,347 --> 00:21:57,966
It is ionising our atmosphere.
All power sources have failed.

178
00:21:58,187 --> 00:22:04,356
Earth-orbiting starships are powerless.
The probe is vaporising our oceans.

179
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:09,278
We cannot survive unless a way
can be found to respond to the probe.

180
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,859
Further communications
may not be possible.

181
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,238
Save your energy. Save yourselves.

182
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:24,496
Avoid the planet Earth at all costs.
Farewell.

183
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,191
Let's hear the probe's transmission.

184
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:53,656
Yes, sir. On speakers.

185
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:10,673
- What do you make of that?
- Most unusual.

186
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:14,669
An unknown form of energy
of great power and intelligence,

187
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:18,340
unaware that its transmissions
are disruptive.

188
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,726
I find it illogical
that its intentions be hostile.

189
00:23:21,938 --> 00:23:27,394
You think this is its way
of saying, ''hi, there!'' to Earth?

190
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:35,155
Only human arrogance would assume
the message must be meant for man.

191
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:39,829
You're suggesting the transmission
is meant for a life form other than man?

192
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,875
It is a possibility. The President did
say it was directed at Earth's oceans.

193
00:23:54,595 --> 00:24:01,843
can you modify the signals accounting
for density, temperature and salinity.

194
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,805
I can try, sir.

195
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:28,995
I think I have it.

196
00:24:30,923 --> 00:24:33,794
This is what
it would sound like underwater?

197
00:24:41,434 --> 00:24:43,806
Fascinating.

198
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:49,145
lf my suspicion is correct, there
can be no response to this message.

199
00:24:49,358 --> 00:24:52,443
- Where are you going?
- To test my theory.

200
00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:57,066
- Bones, you stay here.
- no way, I want to keep an eye on him.

201
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:20,469
As suspected, the transmissions
are the songs sung by whales.

202
00:25:21,933 --> 00:25:25,883
- Whales?
- Specifically, humpback whales.

203
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:30,397
That's crazy. Who would send
a probe to talk to a whale?

204
00:25:30,608 --> 00:25:34,606
Whales were on Earth
far earlier than man.

205
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:38,605
1 0 million years earlier.
humpbacks were heavily hunted.

206
00:25:38,825 --> 00:25:41,695
They died out in the 21 st century.

207
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:48,625
The alien probe could be here
to determine why they lost contact.

208
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:54,375
could the humpback's answer
to this call be simulated?

209
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,540
The sounds, but not the language.
We would be responding in gibberish.

210
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:04,716
- can the species be found elsewhere?
- humpbacks were indigenous to Earth.

211
00:26:07,395 --> 00:26:12,520
Then we have no choice.
We must destroy the probe.

212
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:16,601
To attempt to do so
would be futile.

213
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:20,735
We can't just turn away.
There must be an alternative.

214
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:27,154
There is one possibility.
We could attempt to find some whales.

215
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:33,494
You just said there aren't any,
except on Earth of the past.

216
00:26:33,713 --> 00:26:37,793
ln that case...
Wait just a damn minute.

217
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:43,252
Spock, start your computations
for time warp.

218
00:26:43,473 --> 00:26:46,224
Bones, come with me.

219
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:02,319
We need that power to keep
medical facilities functioning.

220
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:07,195
All underground storage systems
have been shut down.

221
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,346
- how long is this bay?
- About 60 feet.

222
00:27:33,564 --> 00:27:38,606
- can you enclose it to hold water?
- Are you planning to take a swim?

223
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,568
- Off the deep end.
- We've got to find some humpbacks.

224
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:46,067
- humpbacked people?
- Whales.

225
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:49,737
45-50 feet long, about 40 tons each.

226
00:27:49,956 --> 00:27:53,372
You're going to try time travel
in this rust bucket?

227
00:27:53,584 --> 00:27:58,330
You'd have to slingshot around
the sun to pick up enough speed.

228
00:27:58,548 --> 00:28:01,169
- Would you prefer to do nothing?
- I prefer common sense.

229
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:07,633
We go back in time, find some whales,
then bring them forward in time,

230
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,261
and hope to hell
they tell this probe to clear off?

231
00:28:12,478 --> 00:28:15,052
- That's crazy!
- You have a better idea?

232
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:22,068
- computation is in progress.
- Uhura, get me Starfleet command.

233
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:36,001
I'm picking up a faint transmission
from Admiral kirk.

234
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,120
On screen.

235
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:43,211
Starfleet Command,
this is Admiral James T. kirk.

236
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:51,015
We have intercepted
and analysed the call of the probe.

237
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,384
Go to reserve power.

238
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:57,600
It is our opinion that only
the extinct humpback whale

239
00:28:57,815 --> 00:29:00,733
can give a proper response
to the probe.

240
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,983
Stabilise. Emergency reserve.

241
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,319
We are going to attempt time travel.

242
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,372
We are computing our trajectory
at this time.

243
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:20,626
Get him back!

244
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:37,386
Ready to engage computer.

245
00:29:38,439 --> 00:29:42,651
- What's our target in time?
- Late 20th century.

246
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,905
I've had to programme
some of the variables from memory.

247
00:29:47,115 --> 00:29:51,990
- What are the variables?
- Availability of fuel. Mass of the vessel.

248
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:56,450
Probable location of whales.
ln this case, the Pacific Basin.

249
00:29:56,666 --> 00:30:00,165
- You programmed that from memory?
- I have.

250
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:05,087
- ''Angels and ministers defend us.''
- ''hamlet'', act 1 , scene lV.

251
00:30:06,092 --> 00:30:10,386
no doubt about your memory.
Prepare for warp speed.

252
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:16,344
- Shields, Mr chekov.
- Shields.

253
00:30:17,854 --> 00:30:20,309
May fortune favour the foolish.

254
00:30:22,483 --> 00:30:23,859
Warp speed, Mr Sulu.

255
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:33,865
Warp 2.

256
00:30:34,829 --> 00:30:38,661
- Warp 3.
- Steady as she goes.

257
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,792
Warp 4.

258
00:30:46,507 --> 00:30:47,836
Warp 5.

259
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,337
Warp 6.

260
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:56,348
Warp 7.

261
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:02,393
- Warp 8.
- heat shields at maximum.

262
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:05,854
Warp 9!

263
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:11,941
- 9.2, 9.3...
- We need breakaway speed.

264
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:17,199
9.5, 9.6, 9.7...

265
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:18,907
9.8...

266
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:30,086
now!

267
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,445
I should never have left him.

268
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:05,582
Jim, where are we?

269
00:32:07,797 --> 00:32:11,380
y ou're talking about
the end of everybody on Earth.

270
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:01,722
Mr Sulu...

271
00:33:09,942 --> 00:33:11,982
Mr Sulu.

272
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:22,989
- Aye, sir.
- What is our condition?

273
00:33:24,832 --> 00:33:30,835
- The breaking thrusters have fired.
- Picture, please.

274
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:40,715
Earth...
But when? Spock?

275
00:33:40,932 --> 00:33:46,804
Judging by atmospheric pollution,
the latter half of the 20th century.

276
00:33:47,021 --> 00:33:53,771
- Well done, Spock.
- We may be visible to them.

277
00:33:53,986 --> 00:33:56,904
Quite right. Engage cloaking device.

278
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:09,282
- crossing the terminator into night.
- The west coast of north America.

279
00:34:10,253 --> 00:34:15,211
- I am receiving whale song.
- Put them on speakers.

280
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:26,509
This is strange.

281
00:34:26,728 --> 00:34:30,725
The song is coming
directly from San Francisco.

282
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:38,276
From the city?
That doesn't make sense.

283
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,360
We have a serious problem.

284
00:34:45,496 --> 00:34:50,372
It's these klingon crystals.
The time travel drained them.

285
00:34:50,585 --> 00:34:54,713
- They're decrystalising.
- Give me a round figure.

286
00:34:54,922 --> 00:35:01,636
24 hours, staying cloaked. After that
we're visible and dead in the water.

287
00:35:01,846 --> 00:35:06,757
We haven't the power to break out
of Earth's gravity or get home.

288
00:35:06,976 --> 00:35:11,638
We can't stop now.
can't we recrystalise the dilithium?

289
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:15,059
We can't even do that
in the 23rd century.

290
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:29,574
Admiral, there may be
a 20th century possibility.

291
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:34,287
I recall there was a dubious
flirtation with nuclear fission reactors.

292
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:40,708
They resulted in toxic side-effects
and were replaced in the fusion era.

293
00:35:40,927 --> 00:35:43,928
But at this time,
we may be able to find some.

294
00:35:45,681 --> 00:35:51,518
- But you said they were toxic.
- We collect only high-energy photons.

295
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:58,348
These photons would recrystalise
the dilithium structure... theoretically.

296
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:04,323
- Where would we find these reactors?
- They were used in naval vessels.

297
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:15,075
San Francisco. I was born there.

298
00:36:15,294 --> 00:36:17,750
It doesn't look all that different.

299
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:23,800
- Set us down in Golden Gate Park.
- Aye, sir. Descending.

300
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:29,223
Uhura and chekov
are assigned the uranium problem.

301
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:34,511
Dr Mccoy, Mr Scott and Mr Sulu
will convert us a whale tank.

302
00:36:34,731 --> 00:36:36,889
Oh, joy!

303
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:43,360
capt. Spock and I will attempt
to trace these whale songs.

304
00:36:43,573 --> 00:36:47,522
Be very careful,
this is terra incognita.

305
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,199
Many of their customs
will take us by surprise.

306
00:36:56,919 --> 00:37:01,047
none of these people
have ever seen an extraterrestrial.

307
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,580
This is a primitive
and paranoid culture.

308
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:37,827
Take a phaser and a communicator.

309
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:43,584
Radio silence except in emergencies.
Remove your rank insignia.

310
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,923
Any questions? All right.

311
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,345
Let's do our job and get out of here.
Our own world is waiting for us.

312
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:56,721
- commence landing procedure.
- Aye, sir.

313
00:38:04,487 --> 00:38:09,363
Were you two fighting again?
I thought you made up.

314
00:38:09,575 --> 00:38:13,787
- Why are you two always fighting?
- I like the way she fights.

315
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:19,073
I told her I wasn't spending $60
on a damn toaster oven.

316
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:21,749
- What did she say to that?
- Well...

317
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:53,698
What the hell was that?

318
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,674
- Did you see that?
- no, and neither did you.

319
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:26,067
- Bearing to the whales?
- 283 degrees, 1 5.2 kilometres.

320
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:28,898
Everybody remember where we parked.

321
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:51,625
Watch where you're going, dumb-ass!

322
00:39:52,887 --> 00:39:55,212
Double dumb-ass on you!

323
00:40:13,032 --> 00:40:17,528
- It's a miracle our race survived.
- They're still using money.

324
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:21,953
Spock. The rest of you stay here.

325
00:40:25,461 --> 00:40:29,839
Break up,
you look like a cadet review.

326
00:40:54,991 --> 00:40:59,154
1 8th century American.
Quite valuable.

327
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,202
- You do want to part with them?
- how much will you give me?

328
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:07,959
- Those were a gift from Dr Mccoy.
- And they will be again.

329
00:41:09,672 --> 00:41:14,049
- how much?
- The lenses aren't intact.

330
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:19,599
- I'll give you $1 00.
- Is that a lot?

331
00:41:23,603 --> 00:41:26,473
That's all there is. Don't splurge.

332
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:29,771
All set? Good hunting.

333
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:37,943
Thanks to your restored memory,
and a little bit of good luck,

334
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,702
we're walking around San Francisco
looking for humpback whales.

335
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:46,698
- how will you solve this problem?
- Simple logic will suffice.

336
00:41:46,918 --> 00:41:49,325
I will make use of this map.

337
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:54,591
I have the distance and bearing
from Uhura.

338
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:02,429
283.7 degrees...

339
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:08,929
We'll find what we're looking for
at the cetacean lnstitute in Sausalito.

340
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:11,390
- how do you know this?
- Simple logic.

341
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:25,866
What does ''exact change'' mean?

342
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:35,626
how do we convert this tank?

343
00:42:35,842 --> 00:42:41,962
- lf I had transparent aluminium...
- You're years too early for that.

344
00:42:42,181 --> 00:42:46,309
- Let's find their equivalent.
- But where?

345
00:42:57,071 --> 00:43:01,614
- Did you find it?
- Yes, now we need directions.

346
00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:08,910
Excuse me, can you direct me
to the naval base in Alameda?

347
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:13,461
It's where they keep
the nuclear vessels.

348
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,842
nuclear vessels.

349
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:27,516
- Excuse us...
- We are looking for nuclear vessels.

350
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:32,353
can you tell me
where the naval base is in Alameda?

351
00:43:32,565 --> 00:43:36,397
hello, we are looking
for the nuclear vessels in Alameda.

352
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:39,481
- can you help us?
- Where is the Alameda naval base?

353
00:43:39,697 --> 00:43:47,574
- Where are the nuclear vessels?
- Across the bay in Alameda.

354
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:50,790
That's what I said, Alameda.

355
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:01,834
Excuse me.

356
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:07,974
Excuse me, would you mind
stopping that noise?

357
00:44:14,732 --> 00:44:18,397
Excuse me, would you mind
stopping that damn noise?

358
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,301
- Admiral, may I ask you a question?
- Don't call me Admiral.

359
00:44:44,387 --> 00:44:50,757
You used to call me Jim.
What's your question?

360
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:54,688
Your use of language
has altered since our arrival.

361
00:44:54,897 --> 00:44:59,275
It is currently laced
with more colourful metaphors.

362
00:44:59,485 --> 00:45:02,522
- ''Double dumb-ass on you.''
- The profanity?

363
00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:08,859
That's the way they talk. nobody pays
any attention unless you swear.

364
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:13,158
- Look at the literature of the period.
- For example?

365
00:45:13,374 --> 00:45:19,128
The works of Jacqueline Susann.
The novels of harold Robbins.

366
00:45:19,338 --> 00:45:21,415
''The Giants''.

367
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:35,641
The next showing of ''The World
of Whales'' begins in five minutes.

368
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,899
here I go.

369
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,575
Good morning, I'm your guide
this morning. I'm Dr Gillian Taylor.

370
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:59,503
I'm assistant director
of the Maritime cetacean lnstitute.

371
00:46:00,421 --> 00:46:05,664
The cetacean lnstitute
is the only museum devoted to whales.

372
00:46:05,885 --> 00:46:08,756
We have a great deal to offer,

373
00:46:08,971 --> 00:46:14,048
but that is small compared
to what we don't know about whales.

374
00:46:14,268 --> 00:46:18,136
One commonly held misconception
is that whales are fish.

375
00:46:18,356 --> 00:46:21,108
They're not.
They're mammals like you and me.

376
00:46:21,317 --> 00:46:25,896
Warm blooded, breathing air and
producing milk to nurse their young.

377
00:46:26,114 --> 00:46:29,529
- Do whales attack people?
- no.

378
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:33,610
Most whales don't have teeth,
they have a gum-like tissue

379
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,251
that strains tiny shrimp for food,
and that is the limit of their hostility.

380
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,624
Unfortunately, their principal enemy
is far more aggressive.

381
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,090
- You mean man?
- To put it mildly.

382
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:51,877
Men have always harvested whales
for a variety of purposes,

383
00:46:52,098 --> 00:46:55,265
most of which can be synthesised.

384
00:46:55,476 --> 00:47:00,553
1 00 years ago, using hand-thrown
harpoons, man did plenty of damage.

385
00:47:00,773 --> 00:47:04,308
But that is nothing compared to what
he has achieved in this century.

386
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:09,687
Mankind has hunted whales
to the brink of extinction.

387
00:47:09,907 --> 00:47:14,569
Virtually gone is the blue whale,
the largest creature on Earth.

388
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:19,200
Despite all attempts to ban whaling,
there are still countries and pirates

389
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:23,497
currently engaged in the slaughter
of these creatures.

390
00:47:23,713 --> 00:47:29,798
humpback whales, once numerous,
now number about 1 0,000 specimens.

391
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:33,095
Those that are taken
are no longer fully grown.

392
00:47:33,306 --> 00:47:39,309
ln addition, many of the female whales
are killed with their unborn calves.

393
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,724
To hunt a species to extinction
is not logical.

394
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,811
Whoever said the human race
was logical?

395
00:47:47,653 --> 00:47:52,814
lf you'll follow me, I'll introduce you
to the institute's pride and joy.

396
00:48:05,254 --> 00:48:08,090
This is the largest
seawater tank in the world.

397
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:12,712
It contains the only
two humpback whales in captivity.

398
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:24,219
They are mature humpbacks
weighing 45,000 pounds each.

399
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:29,479
They wandered into San Francisco Bay
as calves and were brought here.

400
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:32,233
We call them George and Gracie.

401
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:37,942
It's perfect.
A male and female in a tank.

402
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:41,448
We can beam them up together.

403
00:48:46,921 --> 00:48:51,049
Beautiful, aren't they?
And extremely intelligent.

404
00:48:51,259 --> 00:48:53,298
lf you'll follow me, please.

405
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:04,891
Despite all they're teaching us,
we have to return them to the open sea.

406
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:10,349
We simply don't have enough money
to feed them two tons of shrimp a day.

407
00:49:11,446 --> 00:49:14,363
- how soon?
- Soon.

408
00:49:14,574 --> 00:49:18,239
It's too bad, because
they're really quite friendly.

409
00:49:18,453 --> 00:49:21,489
I've grown quite attached to them.

410
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,291
now here's a much better way to see
George and Gracie. Underwater.

411
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:44,888
What you're hearing is recorded
whale song, sung by the male.

412
00:49:46,064 --> 00:49:50,690
he'll sing anywhere
from 6 to 30 minutes.

413
00:49:50,902 --> 00:49:54,235
ln the ocean, other whales will
pick up the song and pass it on.

414
00:49:55,031 --> 00:49:59,242
The songs change every year.
We don't know their purpose.

415
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,867
Are they a navigational signal?

416
00:50:07,335 --> 00:50:10,122
Are they part of the mating ritual?

417
00:50:11,672 --> 00:50:16,548
Or is it pure communication
beyond our comprehension?

418
00:50:17,637 --> 00:50:20,128
Frankly, we just don't know.

419
00:50:20,348 --> 00:50:22,803
Maybe he's singing to that man.

420
00:50:28,314 --> 00:50:32,359
What the hell?!
Excuse me, wait right here.

421
00:50:38,074 --> 00:50:41,525
Excuse me, please.

422
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:50,325
- What were you doing in there?
- Yes, speak up.

423
00:50:51,421 --> 00:50:56,415
- Attempting the hell to communicate.
- You have no right to be here!

424
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,550
You heard the lady.

425
00:51:00,304 --> 00:51:04,468
lf we assumed that these whales
are ours to do with as we please,

426
00:51:04,684 --> 00:51:07,471
we would be as guilty as those
who caused their extinction.

427
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,936
I want you guys out of here
before I call the cops.

428
00:51:15,153 --> 00:51:17,644
We were only trying to help.

429
00:51:17,864 --> 00:51:21,529
Your friend
was messing up my whales.

430
00:51:21,743 --> 00:51:24,779
They like you,
but they are not the hell your whales.

431
00:51:24,996 --> 00:51:29,457
- I suppose they told you that.
- The hell they did.

432
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:30,996
Right.

433
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:39,718
Spock, about those colourful
metaphors we discussed.

434
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:48,424
Don't use them any more.
You haven't quite got the knack of it.

435
00:51:48,644 --> 00:51:52,938
And another thing, it's not
always necessary to tell the truth.

436
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:55,854
- I cannot tell a lie.
- I don't mean lie.

437
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:59,900
But you could exaggerate.
You've done it before.

438
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:03,317
- can't you remember?
- The hell I can't.

439
00:52:04,952 --> 00:52:10,113
- What else did you learn?
- Their species is unhappy with man.

440
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:16,003
- Are they going to help us?
- I communicated our intentions.

441
00:52:21,928 --> 00:52:27,135
It's all right. I know.
They didn't mean any harm.

442
00:52:35,733 --> 00:52:40,976
- I heard there was some excitement.
- Just a couple of kooks.

443
00:52:42,448 --> 00:52:44,939
- how are you doing?
- I'm fine.

444
00:52:45,159 --> 00:52:48,611
Don't tell me fish stories,
I've known you too long.

445
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:52,745
Bob, it's tearing me apart.

446
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:59,121
I feel the same, but we're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.

447
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:03,504
lf we keep them here or let them go,
we're still risking their lives.

448
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,297
I know.

449
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:10,720
They're not human beings.
Their intelligence is...

450
00:53:10,935 --> 00:53:17,554
My compassion is not limited to
my estimation of one's intelligence.

451
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:41,830
- Team leader, this is team two.
- I have the co-ordinates of the reactor.

452
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,877
- kirk here.
- We have found the nuclear vessel.

453
00:53:47,096 --> 00:53:52,007
- Well done.
- Admiral, it is the Enterprise.

454
00:53:55,354 --> 00:53:58,142
Understood. What's your plan?

455
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,771
We will beam in tonight and collect
the photons. no one will know.

456
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:06,736
Understood and approved.

457
00:54:06,949 --> 00:54:08,989
kirk out.

458
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:21,171
There she is. lf we play our cards right,
we can find out about the whales.

459
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:26,885
- how will playing cards help?
- It's Robin hood and Friar Tuck.

460
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:32,425
- Where are you fellas heading?
- Back to San Francisco.

461
00:54:33,518 --> 00:54:36,803
You came all this way just for a swim?

462
00:54:38,147 --> 00:54:42,145
- I won't try to explain.
- I'll buy that.

463
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:45,527
- What about him?
- he's harmless.

464
00:54:45,738 --> 00:54:50,032
Back in the 60s, he was part of the
free-speech movement at Berkeley.

465
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:54,192
- he did a little too much LDS.
- LDS?

466
00:54:56,124 --> 00:55:00,999
I'll give you a lift. I have a notorious
weakness for hard-luck cases.

467
00:55:01,212 --> 00:55:06,088
- We don't want to be any trouble.
- You've already been that. come on.

468
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:20,518
Thank you very much.

469
00:55:20,732 --> 00:55:24,147
Don't try anything. I've got
a tire iron right where I can get at it.

470
00:55:28,281 --> 00:55:32,278
- So, you were at Berkeley?
- I was not.

471
00:55:33,911 --> 00:55:37,530
- Memory problems, too.
- Where are you from?

472
00:55:37,749 --> 00:55:39,788
- lowa.
- A landlubber.

473
00:55:40,877 --> 00:55:44,577
What the hell were you guys
really trying to do back there?

474
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:50,468
Was it some kind of macho thing?
I really hate that macho stuff.

475
00:55:51,804 --> 00:55:55,505
- can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

476
00:55:56,601 --> 00:55:59,767
What's going to happen
when you release the whales?

477
00:56:01,064 --> 00:56:06,769
- They'll have to take their chances.
- What does that mean exactly?

478
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:12,941
They'll be at risk from whale hunters
just like all other humpbacks.

479
00:56:14,035 --> 00:56:18,033
What did you mean
with all that stuff about extinction?

480
00:56:18,247 --> 00:56:24,665
he meant what you said on the tour,
that humpbacks may well disappear.

481
00:56:24,879 --> 00:56:26,872
That's not what he said, farmboy.

482
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:33,804
''We would be as guilty as those who
caused,'' past tense, ''their extinction.''

483
00:56:34,013 --> 00:56:36,967
I have a photographic memory.
I see words.

484
00:56:38,309 --> 00:56:41,345
Are you sure it isn't time
for a colourful metaphor?

485
00:56:43,898 --> 00:56:49,402
Are you some dipshit army guy trying
to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes?

486
00:56:50,154 --> 00:56:55,196
- no dipshit.
- Good, I'd have let you off here.

487
00:56:56,703 --> 00:56:58,031
Gracie is pregnant.

488
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:04,494
Who are you? Don't jerk me around.
how do you know that?

489
00:57:04,711 --> 00:57:08,329
We can't tell you that.
Let me finish.

490
00:57:08,548 --> 00:57:12,332
We're not in the military
and we intend no harm to the whales.

491
00:57:13,886 --> 00:57:19,889
We may be able to help you in ways
you couldn't possibly imagine.

492
00:57:20,101 --> 00:57:22,722
- Or believe, I'll bet.
- Very likely.

493
00:57:24,313 --> 00:57:28,810
- You're not catching us at our best.
- That much is certain.

494
00:57:31,988 --> 00:57:38,073
I think we'd all be a lot happier
discussing this over dinner.

495
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:40,325
What do you say?

496
00:57:45,376 --> 00:57:46,835
Do you guys like ltalian?

497
00:57:48,046 --> 00:57:50,168
- no.
- Yes.

498
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:56,716
Yes, I love ltalian...
and so do you.

499
00:58:11,944 --> 00:58:16,487
Professor Scott,
I'm Dr nichols, plant manager.

500
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:20,779
I'm terribly sorry.
There's been an awful mix-up.

501
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:25,171
I was never told about your visit.

502
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:31,174
I tried to clear things up. I explained
that you'd come from Edinburgh

503
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:37,974
to study Plexicorp's manufacturing,
but they don't know anything about it.

504
00:58:38,189 --> 00:58:40,312
Don't know anything about it?

505
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:45,732
- I've come millions of miles.
- Thousands!

506
00:58:45,947 --> 00:58:52,993
I was invited on an inspection.
I demand to see the owners.

507
00:58:53,204 --> 00:58:59,823
Dr nichols has offered to take us
around the plant personally.

508
00:59:00,044 --> 00:59:03,164
- he has?
- With pleasure.

509
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,964
- That's different.
- Gregory.

510
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,685
- May my assistant join us?
- Of course.

511
00:59:18,479 --> 00:59:21,053
Don't bury yourself in the part.

512
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:29,069
hi. A good-looking ship.
huey 204, isn't it?

513
00:59:29,282 --> 00:59:33,529
- Right on, do you fly?
- here and there.

514
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:37,493
I flew something similar
in my Academy days.

515
00:59:37,707 --> 00:59:41,372
- Then this must be old stuff to you.
- Yes...

516
00:59:41,586 --> 00:59:45,370
But interesting.
can I ask you a few questions?

517
00:59:51,512 --> 00:59:54,715
This is a fine place you have here.

518
00:59:54,932 --> 00:59:59,393
Thank you. Your knowledge
of engineering is most impressive.

519
00:59:59,604 --> 01:00:03,222
Back home
we call him the miracle worker.

520
01:00:03,441 --> 01:00:09,064
- May I offer you something?
- May I offer something to you?

521
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,741
- Yes?
- You're still working with polymers.

522
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:19,325
- What else would I be working with?
- What else indeed?

523
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,498
how thick would a piece
of your plexiglas need to be,

524
01:00:24,712 --> 01:00:30,335
at 60 feet by 1 0 feet to withstand
pressure of 1 8,000 cubic feet of water?

525
01:00:30,968 --> 01:00:36,045
- Six inches. We have it in stock.
- I've noticed.

526
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:39,515
now, suppose...

527
01:00:39,727 --> 01:00:44,722
..I were to show you
a way to manufacture a wall

528
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:50,694
that would do the same job,
but be only one inch thick.

529
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:55,861
- Would that be worth something?
- You're joking.

530
01:00:56,369 --> 01:00:59,370
Perhaps the professor
could use your computer.

531
01:01:02,083 --> 01:01:04,122
computer...

532
01:01:05,253 --> 01:01:07,292
computer!

533
01:01:12,885 --> 01:01:16,965
- hello, computer.
- Just use the keyboard.

534
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:22,013
A keyboard, how quaint!

535
01:01:52,633 --> 01:01:56,963
- Transparent aluminium?
- That's the ticket, laddie.

536
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:02,559
It would take years to figure out
the dynamics of this matrix.

537
01:02:02,768 --> 01:02:07,596
Yes, but you would be rich
beyond the dreams of avarice.

538
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:13,569
So, is it worth something to you,
or should I punch up ''clear''?

539
01:02:13,779 --> 01:02:15,274
no.

540
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:19,947
not now, Madeline.

541
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:31,126
What exactly did you have in mind?

542
01:02:31,339 --> 01:02:33,664
A moment alone, please.

543
01:02:40,473 --> 01:02:44,553
Do you realise
that if we give him the formula,

544
01:02:44,769 --> 01:02:47,141
we're altering the future?

545
01:02:47,355 --> 01:02:50,605
Why? how do we know
he didn't invent the thing?

546
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:56,399
Yeah.

547
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:12,371
- Won't you change your mind?
- What is wrong with the one I have?

548
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:18,928
- A little joke. Goodbye, old friend.
- Wait a minute.

549
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:22,470
nobody knows that Gracie is pregnant.

550
01:03:22,682 --> 01:03:25,255
Gracie does. I'll be right here.

551
01:03:29,063 --> 01:03:32,930
Is he just going to hang around
the bushes while we eat?

552
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:35,190
It's his way.

553
01:03:53,045 --> 01:03:56,296
- Do you trust me?
- lmplicitly.

554
01:03:57,383 --> 01:04:01,879
Large mushroom and pepperoni,
with extra onions and a Michelob.

555
01:04:02,096 --> 01:04:06,639
- Great choice. And you, sir?
- Make that two.

556
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:17,273
how does a nice girl like you
get to be a cetacean biologist?

557
01:04:18,237 --> 01:04:24,987
- Just lucky, I guess.
- You're upset about losing the whales.

558
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,952
You're very perceptive.

559
01:04:32,043 --> 01:04:38,046
- how will that be done, exactly?
- They'll be flown to Alaska.

560
01:04:38,257 --> 01:04:41,922
- They'll be released there.
- That's the last you'll see of them?

561
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:49,594
See, yes. But we'll tag them with
special transmitters and monitor them.

562
01:04:53,231 --> 01:04:56,813
I could take
those whales somewhere...

563
01:04:58,569 --> 01:05:00,894
..where they'd never be hunted.

564
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:11,831
You can't even get from Sausalito
to San Francisco without a lift.

565
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:16,912
lf I'm so inept,
how come we're having dinner?

566
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,750
I'm a sucker for hard-luck cases.
cheers.

567
01:05:25,805 --> 01:05:30,383
Besides, I want to know why
you travel around with that ditzy guy

568
01:05:30,601 --> 01:05:33,555
who knows that Gracie is pregnant
and calls you ''AdmiraI''.

569
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,520
Where could you take them...
my whales?

570
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:49,909
- Where would they be safe?
- It's not a matter of where, but when.

571
01:05:50,121 --> 01:05:53,786
- It would have to be right now.
- Why?

572
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,949
no humpback born in captivity
has ever survived.

573
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:05,381
But they won't be safe at sea because
of all the hunting this time of year.

574
01:06:08,014 --> 01:06:11,180
So you see,
that, as they say, is that.

575
01:06:14,979 --> 01:06:16,307
Damn.

576
01:06:22,987 --> 01:06:27,815
What is that?
You have a pocket pager.

577
01:06:29,827 --> 01:06:31,238
Are you a doctor?

578
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:39,624
- I told you not to call me.
- Sorry, I thought you'd like to know.

579
01:06:39,837 --> 01:06:44,832
- We're beaming them in now.
- All right. Good luck. kirk out.

580
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:54,014
- You want to try it from the top?
- Tell me when the whales are leaving.

581
01:06:56,395 --> 01:06:59,147
- Who are you?
- Who do you think I am?

582
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:03,349
Don't tell me!
You're from outer space.

583
01:07:03,569 --> 01:07:06,440
I'm from lowa, I work in outer space.

584
01:07:06,656 --> 01:07:11,898
I was close. I knew outer space
was going to come into this.

585
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:15,282
- The truth?
- I am all ears.

586
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:28,716
Okay... the truth.

587
01:07:35,226 --> 01:07:38,227
I am from the late 23rd century.

588
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:40,810
I've come back in time...

589
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:46,438
..to bring two humpback whales
with me, in an attempt to...

590
01:07:48,072 --> 01:07:49,981
..repopulate the species.

591
01:07:51,951 --> 01:07:56,328
Why didn't you say so?
Why all the coy disguises?

592
01:07:58,457 --> 01:08:03,001
- You want the details?
- Oh, I wouldn't miss this.

593
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:09,417
- When are the whales being released?
- Okay, what the hell.

594
01:08:09,635 --> 01:08:13,715
Your friend was right.
Gracie is pregnant, very pregnant.

595
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:20,266
At noon tomorrow, in a media circus,
the whales get shipped out.

596
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,023
- noon tomorrow?
- Are we leaving?

597
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:28,935
- We don't have much time.
- could we have that to go?

598
01:08:29,155 --> 01:08:34,611
- Sure. Who gets the bad news?
- They don't use money in your time?

599
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:33,207
- how long?
- It depends on the shielding.

600
01:09:43,104 --> 01:09:48,145
Well, Admiral, that was
the briefest dinner I've ever had,

601
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:53,317
and certainly the biggest fish story
I've ever heard.

602
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:58,193
Tell me something. The whale's
transmitter, what's the frequency?

603
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:04,073
Sorry, that's classified. Look,
I don't have a clue who you are.

604
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:09,287
You wouldn't want to show me
around your spaceship, would you?

605
01:10:09,505 --> 01:10:13,882
- That wouldn't be my first choice.
- Well, there we are.

606
01:10:17,096 --> 01:10:22,636
I am here to bring two humpbacks
into the 23rd century.

607
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:26,600
I can go to the open sea to get them.
I'd rather have yours.

608
01:10:27,773 --> 01:10:32,898
It's better for me. It's better for you.
It's better for them.

609
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:36,736
Think about it.

610
01:10:42,622 --> 01:10:45,658
- Who are you?
- Think about it.

611
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:48,829
Don't take too long. I'm out of time.

612
01:10:49,045 --> 01:10:51,666
- This is where I'll be.
- here?

613
01:10:53,591 --> 01:10:55,999
- ln the park.
- Right.

614
01:11:40,555 --> 01:11:43,176
- The tank will be finished by morning.
- That's cutting it close.

615
01:11:43,391 --> 01:11:48,895
- What about team two?
- We're waiting for them to call.

616
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:53,399
Damn! We've been so lucky.
Two perfect whales right here.

617
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:58,604
- now we might lose them.
- Then our mission would fail.

618
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:03,401
Our mission? You're talking about
the end of every life on Earth.

619
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:08,862
You're half human. haven't you got
any feelings about that?

620
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:40,938
- There it is again.
- That's too weird. commander.

621
01:12:41,949 --> 01:12:47,192
- Aren't you running the test program?
- We're getting a power drain.

622
01:12:47,413 --> 01:12:50,118
It must be coming
from inside the ship.

623
01:12:53,044 --> 01:12:58,085
commander Rogerson. Yes, chief,
we're tracking that, too. What is it?

624
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:07,846
Scotty, we're ready for beam-out.

625
01:13:08,434 --> 01:13:10,890
Scotty, can you hear me?

626
01:13:12,271 --> 01:13:14,941
confirmed. Roger that.

627
01:13:19,487 --> 01:13:23,271
This is commander Rogerson.

628
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:29,078
We have an intruder
in number four M.M.R.

629
01:13:30,414 --> 01:13:37,212
- Scotty, do you read?
- Lass, I can hardly hear you.

630
01:13:38,756 --> 01:13:43,383
Power is down to minimal.
I'll bring you in one at a time.

631
01:13:43,594 --> 01:13:46,132
Take the collector. You go first.

632
01:13:53,104 --> 01:13:54,432
Stand by.

633
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,400
Scotty.

634
01:14:06,492 --> 01:14:08,485
hello?

635
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:14,454
come in, please.

636
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:18,410
Scotty, how soon?

637
01:14:19,338 --> 01:14:23,466
chekov, you're breaking up.
Please signal again.

638
01:14:25,678 --> 01:14:30,470
- can you hear me?
- now would be a good time.

639
01:14:32,185 --> 01:14:34,261
Freeze!

640
01:14:34,478 --> 01:14:36,186
chekov!

641
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:40,225
I've lost him.

642
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:45,817
commander Pavel chekov. Starfleet.
United Federation of Planets.

643
01:14:47,867 --> 01:14:52,778
Right, commander, is there
anything you want to tell us?

644
01:14:52,997 --> 01:14:59,082
- Like what?
- Who you are and what these are?

645
01:15:00,171 --> 01:15:04,169
I am Pavel chekov,
a commander in Starfleet.

646
01:15:04,383 --> 01:15:07,468
Service number: 656-5827 D.

647
01:15:09,347 --> 01:15:13,676
- Let's take it from the top.
- The top of what?

648
01:15:13,893 --> 01:15:16,847
- name?
- My name?

649
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:20,017
Play games with me,
and you're through.

650
01:15:20,233 --> 01:15:22,521
I am? May I go now?

651
01:15:27,073 --> 01:15:30,193
- What do you think?
- he's a Russkie.

652
01:15:30,409 --> 01:15:36,495
Of course he's a Russkie,
but he's a retard or something.

653
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:42,122
- Don't move.
- Okay, give us the ray gun.

654
01:15:42,338 --> 01:15:46,336
lf you don't lie on the floor,
I will have to stun you.

655
01:15:47,009 --> 01:15:50,710
- Okay, stun me.
- I'm very sorry.

656
01:15:57,812 --> 01:15:59,354
It must be the radiation.

657
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:20,832
Gangway!

658
01:16:32,889 --> 01:16:34,217
hit the deck!

659
01:16:59,707 --> 01:17:03,041
Man down.
Get a corpsman over here.

660
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:11,504
- Any luck?
- nothing. I shouldn't have left him.

661
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:15,847
You did what was necessary.
keep trying, you'll find him.

662
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:21,762
Scotty, you promised an estimate
on the crystals.

663
01:17:23,147 --> 01:17:28,901
- It'll be well into tomorrow.
- You've got to do better.

664
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:33,781
I'll try, sir.
he's in a wee bit of a snit.

665
01:17:35,076 --> 01:17:37,364
- he's a man of deep feelings.
- What's new?

666
01:18:14,574 --> 01:18:19,864
They left last night. We thought
it would be easier on you this way.

667
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:24,575
You sent them away without
even letting me say goodbye!

668
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:33,648
Admiral! Admiral kirk!

669
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:36,818
Admiral kirk!

670
01:19:51,504 --> 01:19:54,754
Admiral kirk!

671
01:20:09,188 --> 01:20:13,731
Admiral kirk, can you hear me?

672
01:20:15,236 --> 01:20:19,399
They're gone. I need your help.
Are you in there?

673
01:20:20,157 --> 01:20:23,194
Admiral, we have a problem.

674
01:20:29,208 --> 01:20:34,119
Admiral kirk!

675
01:20:34,338 --> 01:20:39,546
Admiral kirk!
Can you hear me?

676
01:20:40,887 --> 01:20:43,045
Oh, my God!

677
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:56,643
hello, Alice.
Welcome to wonderland.

678
01:20:56,861 --> 01:21:01,487
- It's true!
- Yes, it is.

679
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:07,987
I'm glad you're here, but you picked
a hell of a time to drop in.

680
01:21:08,206 --> 01:21:11,788
- Is this real?
- Yes, take a look.

681
01:21:17,298 --> 01:21:21,082
- Storage tanks for your whales.
- They're gone.

682
01:21:22,845 --> 01:21:25,632
- Gone?
- They were taken last night.

683
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:30,973
- They're in Alaska by now.
- Damn!

684
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:35,896
- But you can go find them, right?
- I can't go anywhere.

685
01:21:36,108 --> 01:21:42,028
- What kind of a spaceship is this?
- It's a spaceship with a missing man.

686
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,652
- Full power has been restored.
- Thank you, Mr Spock.

687
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:49,158
Doctor, welcome aboard.

688
01:21:50,581 --> 01:21:55,077
- Admiral, are you there?
- Uhura, what's wrong?

689
01:21:55,294 --> 01:22:00,170
I've located chekov. They're
taking him to emergency surgery.

690
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:04,333
- Where?
- Mercy Hospital.

691
01:22:04,554 --> 01:22:07,757
- The Mission District.
- His condition is critical.

692
01:22:08,808 --> 01:22:10,884
he's not expected to survive.

693
01:22:13,104 --> 01:22:19,771
Let me go in there. Don't leave him
in the hands of 20th-century medicine.

694
01:22:19,986 --> 01:22:26,819
I suggest that Dr Mccoy is correct.
We must help chekov.

695
01:22:29,662 --> 01:22:34,822
- ls that the logical thing to do?
- no, but it is the human thing to do.

696
01:22:36,377 --> 01:22:39,580
Right. Will you help us?

697
01:22:39,797 --> 01:22:43,249
- how?
- We'll have to look like physicians.

698
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:53,304
We'll try down here. You check there.

699
01:23:02,778 --> 01:23:05,614
- What's the matter?
- kidney dialysis.

700
01:23:05,823 --> 01:23:10,284
Dialysis?
What is this, the Dark Ages?

701
01:23:11,287 --> 01:23:18,583
here, swallow that.
lf you have any problems, call me.

702
01:23:21,589 --> 01:23:23,665
here, I've got it.

703
01:23:25,718 --> 01:23:27,212
Let's go.

704
01:23:30,848 --> 01:23:36,721
he's being held in the security corridor
one flight up. his condition is critical.

705
01:23:36,938 --> 01:23:39,689
Excuse me, we'll take that.

706
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:49,650
hold the door. Emergency.

707
01:23:49,867 --> 01:23:53,070
I was there. I heard the whole thing.

708
01:23:53,287 --> 01:23:56,407
Weintraub said radical chemotherapy.

709
01:23:56,624 --> 01:24:02,912
- What about Gottlieb?
- he talked about image therapy.

710
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:06,381
- Unbelievable!
- You have a different view?

711
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:12,013
- It sounds like the Spanish inquisition.
- Bad day.

712
01:24:16,727 --> 01:24:19,135
- Out of the way.
- We have orders...

713
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:25,605
Damn it! This is an acute case
of upper-abdominal distension.

714
01:24:26,946 --> 01:24:29,022
Get out of the way!

715
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:33,114
- What did you say she's got?
- cramps.

716
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,950
You aren't masked!
Who are these people?

717
01:24:39,167 --> 01:24:43,959
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

718
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:48,877
- Tearing of the meningeal artery.
- What's your degree in, dentistry?

719
01:24:49,093 --> 01:24:52,213
how do you explain slow pulse,
low respiratory rate and coma?

720
01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:56,130
- A funduscopic examination...
- ..is unrevealing.

721
01:24:56,350 --> 01:25:00,265
An evacuation of the haematoma
will relieve the pressure.

722
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:05,984
Drilling holes in his head is not the
answer. The artery must be repaired.

723
01:25:06,194 --> 01:25:09,894
Put away your butcher knives
and let me save this patient.

724
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:15,777
- I'll have you removed.
- Such unprofessional behaviour...

725
01:25:15,995 --> 01:25:18,866
- lnto that little room.
- What is that? A gun?

726
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:23,874
- What is this?
- I've no idea.

727
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:34,421
he melted the lock.

728
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:37,556
We're dealing with medievalism here.

729
01:25:39,435 --> 01:25:44,430
chemotherapy!
Funduscopic examinations!

730
01:25:50,863 --> 01:25:53,401
chekov, wake up.

731
01:25:56,494 --> 01:25:59,364
Pavel, can you hear me?

732
01:26:03,584 --> 01:26:08,792
- he's coming around.
- Pavel, talk to me.

733
01:26:11,259 --> 01:26:13,500
name? Rank?

734
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:16,637
chekov, Pavel.

735
01:26:17,807 --> 01:26:21,757
Rank: Admiral.

736
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:27,608
- how's the patient?
- he's going to make it.

737
01:26:27,817 --> 01:26:31,150
- You came in with a she.
- One little mistake.

738
01:26:33,948 --> 01:26:36,154
Get us out of here.

739
01:26:37,785 --> 01:26:40,739
They've taken the patient.

740
01:26:49,213 --> 01:26:51,005
hold it!

741
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,298
- not now, Pavel.
- hold it.

742
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:12,432
The doctor gave me a pill
and I grew a new kidney.

743
01:27:12,653 --> 01:27:14,064
It's fully functional!

744
01:27:40,389 --> 01:27:41,718
Freeze.

745
01:27:45,686 --> 01:27:49,470
- Where would the whales be by now?
- Do you have a chart?

746
01:27:49,690 --> 01:27:55,693
- Just give me the radio frequency.
- What? I'm coming with you.

747
01:27:55,905 --> 01:28:00,199
- Our next stop is the 23rd century.
- So, I've got nobody here.

748
01:28:00,409 --> 01:28:06,199
- I've got to help those whales.
- I've got no time to argue.

749
01:28:06,457 --> 01:28:12,958
- The radio frequency, please.
- 401 megahertz.

750
01:28:14,048 --> 01:28:17,084
Thank you... for everything.

751
01:28:18,761 --> 01:28:21,596
Scotty, beam me up.

752
01:28:22,139 --> 01:28:24,179
Surprise.

753
01:28:30,398 --> 01:28:36,187
- Spock, where the helI's the power?
- One damn minute, Admiral.

754
01:28:36,404 --> 01:28:39,689
I'm trying to remember how
this worked. I got used to a huey.

755
01:28:39,907 --> 01:28:43,276
- You tricked me.
- You need me.

756
01:28:43,494 --> 01:28:46,246
- Take a seat.
- now, Mr Sulu.

757
01:28:57,717 --> 01:28:59,508
What was that?

758
01:29:05,641 --> 01:29:11,477
cloaking device is stable.
All systems normal.

759
01:29:11,689 --> 01:29:15,521
Maintaining impulse climb.
Wing: five by zero. helm: steady.

760
01:29:15,735 --> 01:29:19,815
Advise reaching 1 0,000.
Steer 31 0.

761
01:29:20,031 --> 01:29:24,491
Uhura, scan for the whales.
401 megahertz.

762
01:29:24,702 --> 01:29:26,742
1 0,000, Admiral.

763
01:29:27,872 --> 01:29:30,279
Full impulse power.

764
01:29:30,500 --> 01:29:35,078
31 0 to the Bering Sea.
ETA: 1 2 minutes.

765
01:29:35,296 --> 01:29:41,833
- Are the whale tanks secure?
- Aye, but we're beaming up 400 tons.

766
01:29:42,053 --> 01:29:45,054
It's not just the whales, it's the water.

767
01:29:45,264 --> 01:29:47,304
Yes, of course.

768
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:53,559
- Any contact?
- negative.

769
01:30:00,821 --> 01:30:07,026
- You appear to have a problem.
- Your perception is correct.

770
01:30:07,245 --> 01:30:13,283
ln order to return us to the exact
moment we left the 23rd century

771
01:30:13,501 --> 01:30:17,333
I calculated the time elapsed
in relation to the acceleration curve.

772
01:30:17,547 --> 01:30:21,295
naturally. So what's your problem?

773
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:29,390
- Acceleration is no longer a constant.
- Then take your best shot.

774
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,850
- Best shot?
- Guess, Spock.

775
01:30:33,688 --> 01:30:37,057
- Your best guess.
- Guessing is not in my nature.

776
01:30:37,275 --> 01:30:40,726
Well, nobody's perfect.

777
01:31:03,843 --> 01:31:07,841
- That's it!
- Affirmative. contact with the whales.

778
01:31:08,055 --> 01:31:10,926
Bearing: 327. Range: 600 nautical.

779
01:31:11,142 --> 01:31:15,389
- Put it on the screen.
- how can you do that?

780
01:31:24,697 --> 01:31:29,692
I have a signal closing in
on the whales, bearing 328 degrees.

781
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:32,069
Let's see it.

782
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:41,661
- What kind of ship is that?
- A whaling ship. Are we too late?

783
01:31:49,222 --> 01:31:53,385
- Full-power descent.
- Aye, sir.

784
01:33:11,596 --> 01:33:12,924
Ten seconds, sir.

785
01:34:12,156 --> 01:34:15,572
- All right, Scotty.
- Ten seconds, Admiral.

786
01:34:20,456 --> 01:34:25,663
Five, four, three...

787
01:34:25,878 --> 01:34:28,452
..two, one.

788
01:34:54,282 --> 01:34:57,982
Admiral, there be whales here!

789
01:35:00,163 --> 01:35:05,999
- Well done. Do we have warp speed?
- Full power now, sir.

790
01:35:06,627 --> 01:35:10,246
- lf you will, Mr Sulu.
- Aye, sir. Warp speed.

791
01:35:15,803 --> 01:35:20,015
Mr Sulu, I'm going to take our guest
to look at her whales.

792
01:35:20,224 --> 01:35:24,269
how does the variable mass of whales
fit into our re-entry program?

793
01:35:24,478 --> 01:35:28,856
Mr Scott cannot
give me exact figures...

794
01:35:29,066 --> 01:35:32,151
- I will make a guess.
- A guess?

795
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:38,116
You, Spock? That's extraordinary.

796
01:35:46,417 --> 01:35:49,453
- I don't think he understands.
- no.

797
01:35:49,670 --> 01:35:53,882
he feels safer about your guesses
than most people's facts.

798
01:35:54,091 --> 01:35:57,875
- You're saying it is a compliment?
- It is.

799
01:35:58,095 --> 01:36:02,259
Then I will make the best guess I can.

800
01:36:11,442 --> 01:36:16,982
''They say the sea is cold, but the sea
contains the hottest blood of all.''

801
01:36:20,243 --> 01:36:24,490
''Whales Weep not'', D.h. Lawrence.

802
01:36:30,753 --> 01:36:34,917
It's ironic. When man
was killing these creatures,

803
01:36:35,132 --> 01:36:38,252
he was destroying his own future.

804
01:36:39,345 --> 01:36:45,549
The beasties seem happy to see you.
I hope you like our aquarium.

805
01:36:45,768 --> 01:36:50,845
- A miracle, Mr Scott.
- A miracle? That's yet to come.

806
01:36:53,568 --> 01:36:55,359
What does that mean?

807
01:36:55,570 --> 01:37:00,860
We might not make it. You should
have stayed where you belong.

808
01:37:01,075 --> 01:37:05,025
I belong here.
I am a whale biologist.

809
01:37:06,497 --> 01:37:09,582
Suppose by some miracle
you do get them through?

810
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:14,253
Who in the 23rd century knows
anything about humpback whales?

811
01:37:18,384 --> 01:37:22,216
Admiral, you'd better get up there.
We're having a power fall off.

812
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:25,550
Stay with them.
I'm on my way.

813
01:37:28,978 --> 01:37:31,730
hold on tight.

814
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:38,066
Warp 7.5.

815
01:37:39,864 --> 01:37:44,407
- 7.9.
- Shields at maximum.

816
01:37:46,078 --> 01:37:48,783
That's all I can give you.

817
01:37:48,998 --> 01:37:54,787
- can we make breakaway speed?
- I cannot guarantee it.

818
01:37:55,004 --> 01:37:58,753
I shall compensate
by altering our trajectory.

819
01:37:58,966 --> 01:38:04,305
Warp 8... 8.1 . Maximum speed.

820
01:38:05,389 --> 01:38:11,225
- I need thruster control.
- Thrusters at Spock's command.

821
01:38:13,147 --> 01:38:17,893
Steady... Steady! now!

822
01:38:39,173 --> 01:38:44,001
- Did breaking thrusters fire?
- They did, Admiral.

823
01:38:47,431 --> 01:38:49,720
Then where the hell are we?

824
01:38:54,897 --> 01:38:56,937
The probe.

825
01:39:01,362 --> 01:39:05,574
- condition report.
- computers are non-functional.

826
01:39:05,783 --> 01:39:09,484
The mains are down.
Aux. power is not responding.

827
01:39:13,124 --> 01:39:16,409
- Switch to manual control.
- I have no control, sir.

828
01:39:18,337 --> 01:39:23,332
- Where are we?
- Out of control and blind as a bat.

829
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:25,590
Get him back.

830
01:39:30,641 --> 01:39:35,019
- Look!
- They're heading for the bridge.

831
01:39:49,160 --> 01:39:52,196
keep the nose up if you can.

832
01:40:09,263 --> 01:40:10,757
We're in the water. Blow the hatch.

833
01:40:16,771 --> 01:40:21,314
now all we have to do
is get the whales out of here.

834
01:40:21,526 --> 01:40:25,274
Scotty, do you hear me?

835
01:40:25,488 --> 01:40:29,272
Move! See to the safety of all hands.

836
01:41:03,484 --> 01:41:07,945
- Lassie, get my arm.
- I've got it.

837
01:41:09,866 --> 01:41:13,365
- Admiral, help!
- I'm here, Scotty.

838
01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:27,465
- You're going to be all right.
- The whales are trapped.

839
01:41:27,675 --> 01:41:31,376
- There's no power to the bay door.
- Explosive override?

840
01:41:31,596 --> 01:41:34,550
It's underwater. We can't reach it.

841
01:41:34,765 --> 01:41:38,763
You go on ahead. close the hatch.

842
01:41:38,978 --> 01:41:41,813
- You'll be trapped.
- Go on!

843
01:43:06,566 --> 01:43:08,190
Do you see them?

844
01:43:29,088 --> 01:43:30,417
There!

845
01:43:39,348 --> 01:43:44,010
Why don't they answer?
Why don't they sing?

846
01:47:03,219 --> 01:47:04,761
Mr President, we have power.

847
01:48:16,292 --> 01:48:18,830
The council is now in session.

848
01:48:19,921 --> 01:48:22,708
lf you will all take your seats.

849
01:48:23,716 --> 01:48:25,376
Bring in the accused.

850
01:48:38,564 --> 01:48:42,265
capt. Spock, you do not stand accused.

851
01:48:42,485 --> 01:48:46,103
Mr President,
I stand with my shipmates.

852
01:48:46,322 --> 01:48:48,730
As you wish.

853
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:51,571
The charges are...

854
01:48:51,786 --> 01:48:57,539
conspiracy.
AssauIt on Federation officers.

855
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:02,827
Theft of Federation property,
namely the Starship Enterprise.

856
01:49:03,047 --> 01:49:07,045
Sabotage of the U.S.S. Excelsior.

857
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:14,306
Destruction of Federation property,
specifically the U.S.S. Enterprise.

858
01:49:14,517 --> 01:49:20,057
And finally, disobeying direct orders
of the Starfleet commander.

859
01:49:21,858 --> 01:49:25,024
Admiral kirk, how do you plead?

860
01:49:27,154 --> 01:49:32,030
On behalf of all of us,
I'm authorised to plead guilty.

861
01:49:33,619 --> 01:49:35,078
So entered.

862
01:49:35,288 --> 01:49:42,833
Because of mitigating circumstances,
all charges but one are dismissed.

863
01:49:43,629 --> 01:49:48,256
The charge of disobeying orders
of a superior officer

864
01:49:48,467 --> 01:49:51,552
is directed solely at Admiral kirk.

865
01:49:52,847 --> 01:49:58,470
I'm sure the Admiral will recognise
the necessity for discipline?

866
01:50:00,021 --> 01:50:03,105
- I do, sir.
- James T. kirk...

867
01:50:03,316 --> 01:50:09,484
It is the judgement of this council
that you be reduced in rank to captain.

868
01:50:09,697 --> 01:50:12,983
As a consequence of your new rank,

869
01:50:13,201 --> 01:50:19,239
you will be given the duties for which
you have demonstrated great ability.

870
01:50:19,457 --> 01:50:21,580
The command of a starship.

871
01:50:26,005 --> 01:50:28,543
Silence.

872
01:50:28,758 --> 01:50:34,677
You and your crew have saved this
planet from its own short-sightedness.

873
01:50:34,889 --> 01:50:38,340
We are forever in your debt.

874
01:51:14,053 --> 01:51:16,093
I'm so happy for you.

875
01:51:17,223 --> 01:51:19,595
Thank you so much.

876
01:51:22,395 --> 01:51:26,772
- Wait a minute, where are you going?
- You have your ship, I have mine.

877
01:51:26,983 --> 01:51:30,767
Science vessel.
I've got 300 years of learning to do.

878
01:51:30,987 --> 01:51:35,483
- You mean, this is goodbye?
- Why does it have to be goodbye?

879
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:41,287
Like they say in your century,
I don't even have your phone number.

880
01:51:42,790 --> 01:51:49,789
- how will I find you?
- Don't worry... I'll find you.

881
01:51:55,219 --> 01:51:57,461
See you around the galaxy.

882
01:52:12,153 --> 01:52:13,980
Father.

883
01:52:14,197 --> 01:52:18,905
I am returning to Vulcan
within the hour.

884
01:52:19,118 --> 01:52:25,322
- It was kind of you to make this effort.
- It was no effort. You are my son.

885
01:52:26,834 --> 01:52:31,829
Besides, I am most impressed
with your performance in this crisis.

886
01:52:32,924 --> 01:52:34,334
Most kind.

887
01:52:35,760 --> 01:52:39,710
As I recall,
I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet.

888
01:52:40,640 --> 01:52:43,843
It is possible
that judgement was incorrect.

889
01:52:44,936 --> 01:52:48,102
Your associates
are people of good character.

890
01:52:50,149 --> 01:52:51,893
They are my friends.

891
01:52:53,569 --> 01:52:55,313
Yes, of course.

892
01:52:57,532 --> 01:53:01,114
- Any message for your mother?
- Yes.

893
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:04,789
Tell her... I feel fine.

894
01:53:08,835 --> 01:53:15,003
- Live long and prosper, Father.
- Live long and prosper, my son.

895
01:53:45,663 --> 01:53:49,743
The bureaucratic mentality
is the only constant in the universe.

896
01:53:51,002 --> 01:53:55,711
- We'll get a freighter.
- I'm counting on ''Excelsior''.

897
01:53:55,923 --> 01:54:00,301
Why in God's name
would you want that bucket of bolts?

898
01:54:00,511 --> 01:54:06,135
- A ship is a ship.
- Whatever you say, sir.

899
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:36,421
My friends... we've come home.

900
01:54:46,474 --> 01:54:54,268
- helm ready, captain.
- All right, let's see what she's got.
