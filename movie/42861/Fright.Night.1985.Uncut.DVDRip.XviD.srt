1
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,800
What was that?

2
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
Just a child of the night,
Jonathan.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,280
Come.

4
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,200
sit here beside me
on the veranda.

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,800
It's chilly out here.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, no, it isn't.

7
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,400
It's beautiful.

8
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,680
I love the night so.

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,680
I've never seen you look
so beautiful before, Nina.

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,480
so pale.

11
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,320
so...

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
Iuminescent.

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,080
so...

14
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,600
Yes?

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,801
- Your lips are so red.
- Are they?

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Would you like to kiss them?

17
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,800
Why are you looking at me
so strangely, Nina?

18
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:53,000
Not you, Jonathan.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,480
Your neck.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,081
Has anyone ever told you...

21
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:02,200
it was beautiful?

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,520
- No.
- Come.

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,681
Lay your head on my breast.

24
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:21,881
stop...

25
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,801
you creature of the night!

26
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,401
Who are you who interrupts
my nightly feeding?

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,320
I... am...

28
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,481
Peter Vincent...

29
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,880
vampire killer!

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,001
Keep away!
Keep away from me!

31
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,001
And now your host...

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,921
Peter Vincent.

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,001
Fright Night!

34
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,481
This is Peter Vincent...

35
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:29,680
bringing you
Fright Night Theatre.

36
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,481
Charley!
Peter Vincent's on.

37
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:34,320
Forget Peter Vincent.

38
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:35,921
But you love him.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,920
But I love you more.

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,880
Tonight's journey into horror is...

41
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,601
Blood Castle.

42
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:49,280
It will keep you
on the edge of yourseat.

43
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:51,681
- Stop it.
- I know it will.

44
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,921
It is one of my favourites.

45
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:56,081
And for a very good reason.

46
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,080
I star in it.

47
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:09,921
Fright Night!

48
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:14,081
Charley, I said stop it!

49
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,281
Jesus, Amy,
give me a break!

50
00:04:17,521 --> 00:04:19,600
We've been going together
almost a year.

51
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,081
All I ever hear is
"Charley, stop it."

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,921
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:33,521
Me too.

54
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:35,601
I'm just scared, that's all.

55
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,801
Let's get into bed.

56
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:54,201
You mean it?

57
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:31,681
Charley...

58
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,001
I'm ready.

59
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:35,281
Amy, you're not gonna
believe this.

60
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:38,001
There are two guys in theyard
carrying a coffin.

61
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:41,521
We have pledged ourselves
to evil.

62
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:43,281
Sure.

63
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,401
And they're on the moors,
right?

64
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,801
- Amy, I'm serious.
- So am I.

65
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:49,921
Do you want to make love
or not?

66
00:05:54,801 --> 00:05:58,001
Amy, quick, come here.
You gotta see this.

67
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,801
Okay, maybe it wasn't a coffin...

68
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,081
but I saw two guys carrying
something into that house.

69
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,601
I don't understand you.

70
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,481
First you want to make love,
and then you don't.

71
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,121
What's wrong?

72
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:15,202
Nothing, Mom.

73
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:16,721
Come in here, you two.

74
00:06:20,321 --> 00:06:22,602
Are you kids having
a lovers' spat?

75
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:24,601
No, Mom.
Nothing like that.

76
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:26,801
Well, there's nothing
wrong with it.

77
00:06:26,881 --> 00:06:28,721
The divorce rate is 76% higher...

78
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:31,401
among couples who don't argue
before marriage.

79
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:34,802
- We're in high school!
- Never hurts to plan ahead.

80
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:39,521
Amy, will you remind your mother we're
playing poker at her house thisweekend?

81
00:06:39,602 --> 00:06:41,402
Yes, Mrs Brewster.

82
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,801
Good night, Charley.

83
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:45,522
Yeah, good night.

84
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:49,401
- Good night, Mrs Brewster.
- Good night.

85
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:51,002
Thanks for helping
with Charley's homework

86
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:52,481
Anytime.

87
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,522
See you tomorrow, Charley?

88
00:07:01,402 --> 00:07:04,601
Charley, that wasn't very nice,
not walking Amy to the front door.

89
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:06,482
There are people next door.

90
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:08,881
I guess the new owner's
moving in.

91
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,002
- What new owner?
- Didn't I tell you?

92
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,921
Bob Hoskins said he finally
got rid ofthe place.

93
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,401
- Who'd he sell it to?
- Some fella who fixes up houses.

94
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:19,402
Supposed to be very attractive.

95
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,721
I just hope he knows what
he's getting into with this house.

96
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:24,882
It's gonna take a lot of work--

97
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:28,722
A man was found murdered tonight
behind the railroad yards.

98
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:32,002
Details are pending,
awaiting notification of next of kin.

99
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:36,481
Thank you, Mr Smith.
Have a good weekend.

100
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,722
That bastard!

101
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:41,521
Why didn't he tell us
he was gonna spring a pop quiz?

102
00:07:41,602 --> 00:07:45,682
That's the point to a pop quiz--
to surprise you.

103
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:47,521
Thanks, teach.

104
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,002
Hey, Amy.

105
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,522
Did she finally find out
whatyou're really like?

106
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:55,001
Buzz off, Evil.

107
00:07:55,121 --> 00:07:57,401
Oh. Call me
anything you want.

108
00:07:57,522 --> 00:07:59,921
You're the one failing trig,
not me.

109
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,202
Is this 99 Oak?

110
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,481
No, that's next door.

111
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,482
Thanks.

112
00:08:42,482 --> 00:08:45,202
- Hey, Mom?
- Yeah. I'm in here.

113
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:49,281
Have you seen
the new guy next door?

114
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:51,802
No, but he's got
a live-in carpenter.

115
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,921
With my luck,
he's probably gay.

116
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:55,402
I don't think so.

117
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:58,321
- Why? What do you know that I don't?
- Oh, nothing.

118
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,081
I gotta go study.

119
00:09:00,202 --> 00:09:02,402
Study? You?

120
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:40,402
Hi.

121
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,922
I'm really sorry
about the other night.

122
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,482
It was my fault, not yours.

123
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:49,802
It was?

124
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:53,522
Look, Amy, I loveyou.

125
00:09:55,202 --> 00:09:57,522
I never wanna fight
with you again.

126
00:09:57,602 --> 00:09:59,922
I'm so glad we're getting this
straightened out.

127
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:03,082
- Police have reported a second murder.
- I've been miserable the past two days.

128
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,282
The second victim,
whose body was found this morning...

129
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:07,282
was a known prostitute.

130
00:10:07,402 --> 00:10:09,682
Not talkin' to you
on the phone--

131
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,602
Charley, are you
listening to me?

132
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:15,801
The mutilated corpse was found under
the North Creek bridge by the old mill.

133
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:17,282
There are no leads--

134
00:10:17,402 --> 00:10:20,802
- Know what I heard on the police band?
- What?

135
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:23,522
That wasn't the only murder.

136
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:25,522
The second in two days.

137
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:28,922
And get this--

138
00:10:29,002 --> 00:10:32,322
both of 'em
had their heads chopped off.

139
00:10:32,402 --> 00:10:33,922
Can you believe it?

140
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:35,802
You're sick

141
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:52,322
You're so cool, Brewster!

142
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,922
I can't stand it!

143
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,482
Hey, kid!

144
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:36,082
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'.

145
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,682
Oh, yeah?

146
00:11:37,803 --> 00:11:40,722
Well, just make sure
that it stays that way...

147
00:11:40,802 --> 00:11:42,082
kid.

148
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:08,322
Mom, get up! I can't believe
what's happening next door!

149
00:14:08,403 --> 00:14:10,203
- What?
- He has fangs.

150
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:12,483
The guy who bought the house
has fangs.

151
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:16,083
Fangs. That's lovely.
I have to get up at 7:00 tomorrow.

152
00:14:21,202 --> 00:14:23,122
Fangs? Charley!

153
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,803
You forgot something.

154
00:15:54,803 --> 00:15:57,523
This microwave never melts
the marshmallows right.

155
00:15:57,603 --> 00:15:59,523
Drink that.

156
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,723
I don't need hot cocoa.
I didn't have a nightmare.

157
00:16:02,803 --> 00:16:05,123
They did kill a girl
over there.

158
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:08,003
- How late did you stay up studying?
- Mom, I'm not sick!

159
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,923
The guy did have fangs.

160
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,403
A bat did fly over my head and a second
later he stepped out of the shadows.

161
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,283
Don't you see what that means?

162
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,723
Wait, let me guess.

163
00:16:16,803 --> 00:16:17,803
What?

164
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,603
He's a vampire!

165
00:16:21,283 --> 00:16:22,403
A what?

166
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:27,283
A vampire! Haven't you listened
to anything I've said?

167
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:32,603
Charley, is this
some sort of a trick..

168
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,483
to get me back?

169
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:38,483
Forget it.
I'm going to the police.

170
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:41,403
You can't tell the police that.
They'll lock you up.

171
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:44,323
All right, I won't tell them
he's a vampire.

172
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,283
But I sure am gonna tell them
about the two women.

173
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,483
You're sure about this now?

174
00:17:09,683 --> 00:17:11,804
- Yes?
- Mr Dandrige?

175
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:14,404
No, I'm his roommate,
Billy Cole.

176
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:17,923
Lieutenant Lennox, Homicide.
Do you mind if we come in?

177
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:20,083
No, not at all.
Come on in.

178
00:17:27,683 --> 00:17:29,803
This is quite a place
you have here.

179
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,883
- Yeah. We're restoring it.
- Where is Mr Dandrige?

180
00:17:33,003 --> 00:17:34,603
He's away on business.

181
00:17:34,684 --> 00:17:37,683
- Can I help you?
- There was a murder last night.

182
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:41,004
Your neighbour Charley thinks
he saw the victim in this house.

183
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:43,683
That's impossible.
I was here with jerry last night.

184
00:17:43,803 --> 00:17:46,403
-Therewas nobody else here.
- That's a lie.

185
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:49,323
I saw him carry her body out
in a plastic bag.

186
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:51,684
What do you say to that?

187
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:55,124
Kid's crazy. I took some bags out,
but they were full oftrash.

188
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:56,204
Amy?

189
00:17:56,323 --> 00:17:57,923
Here, let me show you.

190
00:17:58,004 --> 00:18:02,083
Look, the bag I saw
had a body in it, not trash.

191
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,483
You actually see the body,
Charley?

192
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:08,684
- Well, no, but--
- Okay.

193
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:12,483
Let me take you out back I'll show you
the bags I put in the garbage.

194
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:15,603
- Okay, let's see them.
- I can prove he's lying!

195
00:18:17,803 --> 00:18:19,524
Let's look in the basement
instead.

196
00:18:19,603 --> 00:18:21,324
What's down there, Charley?

197
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:23,924
Yes, Charley.
What's down there?

198
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,684
Obviously the boy's
made a mistake, Officer.

199
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:33,323
A coffin! That's what's down there.
I saw them carry it in.

200
00:18:34,324 --> 00:18:35,403
What?

201
00:18:35,523 --> 00:18:38,204
Jerry Dandrige is in it,
sleeping the sleep ofthe undead.

202
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,203
What are you talking about?

203
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,324
- He's a vampire.
- Uh-oh!

204
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:48,484
I saw him last night. He had fangs,
and he bit her on the neck

205
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,323
For heaven's sake!

206
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:52,083
- Come on.
- What?

207
00:18:52,204 --> 00:18:54,683
Wait!
We can't just leave like this!

208
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,004
I got a coffin for you!

209
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:59,004
I don't care what you say!

210
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:03,203
Lieutenant,
please listen to me!

211
00:19:03,323 --> 00:19:06,803
Look, I'm telling you,
Jerry Dandrige is a vampire.

212
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:09,123
Sure, and I'm Dirty Harry.
Listen.

213
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:13,124
If I ever catch your ass at the station
again, I'm throwing it in jail forever!

214
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:16,004
Lieutenant,
just listen to me for a second!

215
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:18,804
I know it's crazy!
I know that, but--

216
00:19:18,884 --> 00:19:20,483
Look, Lieutenant--

217
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:42,084
Oh, my God.

218
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:09,323
Evil!

219
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:15,124
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

220
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,123
The vampire knows
I know about him.

221
00:20:17,204 --> 00:20:19,804
Or at least he will
when he wakes up tonight.

222
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:21,324
What are you talking about?

223
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:23,404
A vampire is living
next door to me...

224
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:26,204
and he's gonna kill me
if I don't protect myself.

225
00:20:28,004 --> 00:20:30,404
- What?
- I haven't got time to explain.

226
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:33,604
Just tell me what to do
to protect myself.

227
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:35,684
Very funny, Brewster.

228
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:38,004
Evil, please!
I'm not kidding!

229
00:20:38,084 --> 00:20:41,204
- Tell me what to do!
- Don't call me Evil any more!

230
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:44,804
Why should I help you anyway?

231
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:46,883
Look, I've got eight bucks.

232
00:20:47,004 --> 00:20:49,124
Help me and it's yours.

233
00:20:51,003 --> 00:20:54,204
Far be it from me
to turn down a fool's money.

234
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:04,004
Where and when doyou expect
the vampire to attack?

235
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,924
In my bedroom, tonight.

236
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:13,124
Start with this.

237
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:18,324
But you must have total faith in it
for it to work

238
00:21:18,404 --> 00:21:20,324
Then get some garlic.

239
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,684
Links of the stuff you can wear around
your neck and hang from your window.

240
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:27,524
If he comes for you,
that'll be the way. Then--

241
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:30,684
Oh, of course!
There's holy water!

242
00:21:30,804 --> 00:21:34,885
But you gotta get a priest
to say a blessing over it first.

243
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:38,604
- That's it?
- I'm afraid so.

244
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:41,924
But your best protection
right now, Charles...

245
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:45,324
is that a vampire
cannot enter your house...

246
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:49,404
without being invited
by the rightful owner first.

247
00:21:49,524 --> 00:21:51,924
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

248
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:54,804
Thank you. Thank you.

249
00:22:10,004 --> 00:22:14,084
Charley, could you come here, please?
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

250
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:16,724
Yeah, Mom.

251
00:22:20,884 --> 00:22:23,124
Charley, this is
our next-door neighbour...

252
00:22:23,204 --> 00:22:24,884
Jerry Dandrige.

253
00:22:35,284 --> 00:22:36,605
Hello, Charley.

254
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:44,484
Charley, don't be rude.
Shake hands.

255
00:22:54,084 --> 00:22:57,924
- What's he doing here?
- I invited him for a drink

256
00:22:58,005 --> 00:22:59,684
You what?

257
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:02,204
I invited him over.
Why?

258
00:23:02,324 --> 00:23:03,684
What's the matter, Charley?

259
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:07,124
Afraid I'd never come over
without being invited first?

260
00:23:08,084 --> 00:23:09,684
You're quite right.

261
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,084
Of course, now that
I've been made welcome...

262
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:15,005
I'll probably drop by
quite a bit.

263
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,005
In fact,
anytime I feel like it.

264
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:23,004
With your mother's
kind permission, of course.

265
00:23:23,124 --> 00:23:25,285
Oh, jerry, anytime.

266
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:30,804
It's nice that someone interesting has
finally moved into the neighbourhood.

267
00:23:33,004 --> 00:23:34,885
Charley, are you all right?

268
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:38,804
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine.

269
00:23:40,324 --> 00:23:42,484
I just gotta get back
to my trig.

270
00:23:42,604 --> 00:23:44,085
Nice to meet you.

271
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:47,284
See you.

272
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:49,005
Soon.

273
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,125
We wouldn't want towake
your mother, would we?

274
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,006
Then I'd have to kill her too.

275
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:24,605
Right?

276
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:52,325
Do you realize how much trouble
you've caused me?

277
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,485
Spying on me.

278
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:57,406
Almost disturbing my sleep
this afternoon.

279
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,805
Telling policemen about me!

280
00:28:11,406 --> 00:28:13,925
You deserve to die, boy.

281
00:28:18,006 --> 00:28:21,806
Of course, I could give you
something I don't have.

282
00:28:21,925 --> 00:28:23,285
A choice.

283
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,725
Forget about me, Charley.

284
00:28:27,805 --> 00:28:30,005
Forget about me,
and I'll forget about you.

285
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:31,925
What do you say, Charley?

286
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:45,526
Fool.

287
00:30:02,326 --> 00:30:03,686
Charley!

288
00:30:18,086 --> 00:30:20,406
Charley, can you hear me?

289
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:29,206
Charley, is thatyou?

290
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:32,006
My door is stuck

291
00:30:42,806 --> 00:30:46,206
- What is going on?
- Nothing. I just had a nightmare.

292
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:50,486
I had one last night.
It was awful.

293
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:54,606
I was at this white sale
and suddenly realized I was stark naked.

294
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:57,526
- Now what is it?
- Nothing.

295
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,406
Just raccoons
in the garbage again.

296
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,925
- Go back to sleep.
- But what about your nightmare?

297
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,486
- Do you want a Valium?
- I'm fine now.

298
00:31:04,606 --> 00:31:07,005
- Honest.
- I do need my sleep.

299
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:10,726
I start the night shift tomorrow.
3:00 in the morning.

300
00:31:10,806 --> 00:31:13,606
- It's so bad for my complexion.
- Good night, Mom.

301
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:04,726
I know you're there, Charley.

302
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:06,406
I can see you.

303
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,406
What's the matter, Charley?

304
00:32:17,526 --> 00:32:19,286
scared?

305
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:24,006
You started this, Charley,
and I'm gonna finish it.

306
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:29,287
I just destroyed your car,
Charley.

307
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:34,206
But that's nothing compared
to what I'm gonna do to you...

308
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:37,927
tomorrow night.

309
00:32:44,486 --> 00:32:46,606
Once again, your host...

310
00:32:46,726 --> 00:32:48,406
Peter Vincent.

311
00:32:48,487 --> 00:32:50,807
Good evening, horror fans.

312
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:53,806
Did you know
there are a lot of people...

313
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:56,326
who do not believe in vampires?

314
00:32:57,206 --> 00:32:58,606
But I do...

315
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,327
because I know they exist.

316
00:33:02,406 --> 00:33:07,127
I have fought them
in all their guises--

317
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:10,886
man, wolves, bats--

318
00:33:11,006 --> 00:33:15,286
and I have always won!

319
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:18,606
That is why they call me...

320
00:33:18,726 --> 00:33:21,127
the great vampire killer.

321
00:33:22,887 --> 00:33:24,326
Now...

322
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:27,526
watch me do it.

323
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,086
Go, Peter.

324
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:44,727
Go.

325
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:59,527
Mr Vincent,
could I talk to you for a minute?

326
00:33:59,606 --> 00:34:02,206
Please, Mr Vincent.
It's very, very important.

327
00:34:02,326 --> 00:34:05,527
- What do you want me to sign?
- Pardon me?

328
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:07,526
You do want my autograph,
don't you?

329
00:34:08,606 --> 00:34:11,806
No, sir, I was curious about
what you said last night on TV...

330
00:34:11,887 --> 00:34:13,686
about believing in vampires.

331
00:34:13,807 --> 00:34:15,606
What about it?

332
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:17,207
Were you serious?

333
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,407
Oh, absolutely.

334
00:34:21,207 --> 00:34:23,886
Unfortunately,
none of your generation seems to be.

335
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:25,407
What do you mean?

336
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:29,127
I have just been fired because nobody
wants to see vampire killers any more...

337
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,726
or vampires either.

338
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:33,527
Apparently all they want
are demented madmen...

339
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:37,127
running around in ski masks
hacking up young virgins.

340
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:38,487
Excuse me.

341
00:34:40,206 --> 00:34:42,007
I believe in vampires.

342
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:49,127
That's nice.

343
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:54,006
If only there had been more of you,
perhaps my ratings would've been higher.

344
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:57,687
In fact, I have one
living next door to me.

345
00:34:57,807 --> 00:34:59,607
Would you help me kill him?

346
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:03,606
Pardon me?

347
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,127
You know that murder
a few days ago?

348
00:35:06,207 --> 00:35:07,687
Yes.

349
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:11,807
The guy who lives next door to me
did it, and he's a vampire.

350
00:35:13,527 --> 00:35:17,206
If this is your idea of a joke,
I am not amused.

351
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,287
Mr Vincent, I am not joking.

352
00:35:19,406 --> 00:35:21,527
I am deadly serious.

353
00:35:22,607 --> 00:35:25,407
Well, if you would excuse me--

354
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:29,406
But, Mr Vincent,
you have to believe me.

355
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:33,207
I'm telling the truth.
You just said you believed in vampires.

356
00:35:33,287 --> 00:35:35,286
I lied.

357
00:35:35,407 --> 00:35:37,287
Now, if you will leave me alone--

358
00:35:37,407 --> 00:35:39,207
You have to listen to me!

359
00:35:39,286 --> 00:35:41,687
The vampire tried
to kill me last night...

360
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,887
and trashed my car
when he didn't succeed.

361
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:48,807
He's gonna be back tonight.
If I don't get help, he's gonna kill me.

362
00:35:48,886 --> 00:35:50,727
Mr Vincent!

363
00:35:50,806 --> 00:35:53,207
Just listen to me for a second.

364
00:35:53,287 --> 00:35:54,727
No! Wait!

365
00:35:54,807 --> 00:35:56,887
Please, Mr Vincent!
Wait!

366
00:36:03,006 --> 00:36:06,407
- What are you doing here?
- What about you? You just dumped him.

367
00:36:06,487 --> 00:36:09,887
- It's none of your business.
- So you do like him.

368
00:36:10,006 --> 00:36:11,407
Anybody home?

369
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:21,287
Wow.

370
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:29,127
What's all this for?

371
00:36:29,207 --> 00:36:31,207
Self-defence.

372
00:36:31,287 --> 00:36:33,407
Not that I think I'll need it.

373
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,287
He'll be dead before nightfall.

374
00:36:35,407 --> 00:36:37,887
- Who will be?
- Dandrige.

375
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:41,687
I'm waiting for the guy he liveswith to
leave, then I'm gonna find his coffin...

376
00:36:41,807 --> 00:36:43,687
and pound this
through his heart.

377
00:36:45,207 --> 00:36:46,727
That's murder, Charley.

378
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,527
You can't murder a vampire, Amy.

379
00:36:51,607 --> 00:36:54,127
They're dead. Remember?

380
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:59,007
Listen.
I just taped this.

381
00:37:02,407 --> 00:37:04,327
Amy.

382
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:06,207
What are we gonna do?

383
00:37:06,327 --> 00:37:08,327
This is just like Fright Night.

384
00:37:08,407 --> 00:37:12,327
Nowforthe news. Anotheryoung woman's
body was discovered this morning...

385
00:37:12,407 --> 00:37:14,207
in back of the sheridan Mall--

386
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:15,887
I don't have any choice.

387
00:37:16,887 --> 00:37:18,887
Somebody has to stop him.

388
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:23,407
It's gonna be dangerous
going into that house all alone.

389
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:28,607
You'll need all the help
you can get.

390
00:37:29,287 --> 00:37:31,607
Somebody like Peter Vincent,
for instance?

391
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:33,127
I tried him already.

392
00:37:34,207 --> 00:37:36,887
Well, let us try again
before you do anything.

393
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,408
There's not enough time, Amy.

394
00:37:39,527 --> 00:37:42,327
Well, what happens
if you go into that house alone...

395
00:37:42,407 --> 00:37:44,127
and he gets you?

396
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:46,007
Who's gonna stop him then?

397
00:37:46,128 --> 00:37:50,207
Yeah. Then he'll be able to suck his way
through the entire town.

398
00:37:51,527 --> 00:37:53,887
Not that it would be
much of a loss.

399
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,327
Charley, it's gonna be dark soon.

400
00:37:57,887 --> 00:38:00,727
You don't want to go
into that house then, doyou?

401
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:03,128
No, you're right there.

402
00:38:07,407 --> 00:38:10,007
- All right, try him again.
- Great.

403
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:13,288
You promise you're not gonna
do anything till you hear from us?

404
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,128
Okay. Come on.

405
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:22,007
You don't believe me,
doyou?

406
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,407
I love you, Charley.

407
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:26,887
Hey, Amy, come on!

408
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:45,807
Yes?

409
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,808
Mr. Vincent,
could we talk to you for a moment?

410
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:51,688
I'm afraid now
is not the best time.

411
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:54,487
Please.
It's very important.

412
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:59,407
Well, if you would just...

413
00:38:59,527 --> 00:39:02,327
wait there for one moment--

414
00:39:03,687 --> 00:39:04,887
Come in!

415
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:10,007
What can I do for you?

416
00:39:11,408 --> 00:39:12,808
An autograph, perhaps?

417
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:17,287
Perhaps an interview
for your school newspaper?

418
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:19,528
I'm afraid this is
much more important.

419
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:22,487
Really?

420
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,527
What could be more important
than my autograph?

421
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:29,207
Saving a boy's life.

422
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,527
Oh. Yes.

423
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:35,288
I can see where that
could be more important.

424
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:39,528
Perhaps you would care to explain.

425
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:43,528
Remember a fruitcake kid
named Charley Brewster?

426
00:39:43,607 --> 00:39:44,888
He said he saw you.

427
00:39:46,327 --> 00:39:48,888
The one who believes
a vampire lives next to him.

428
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:51,687
Oh, yes.
You know, he is insane.

429
00:39:53,128 --> 00:39:54,888
Oh, my dear...

430
00:39:55,008 --> 00:39:57,407
I do hope he's not
a friend of yours.

431
00:39:57,528 --> 00:40:00,488
Yeah, she's got the hots
for the creep.

432
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:01,888
Amy!

433
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:04,127
We need your help to stop him.

434
00:40:04,208 --> 00:40:06,887
He really believes
his next-door neighbour is a vampire...

435
00:40:07,007 --> 00:40:08,888
and he's planning to kill him.

436
00:40:09,008 --> 00:40:11,287
With a stake through the heart.

437
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:15,687
Are you two serious?

438
00:40:16,887 --> 00:40:18,208
Oh, my dear.

439
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:21,608
Your friend needs a psychiatrist,
not a vampire killer.

440
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,208
- Please, Mr Vincent.
- I'm afraid not.

441
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:27,288
You see, Hollywood beckons.

442
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:31,688
I have just been offered
a starring role in a major film.

443
00:40:31,808 --> 00:40:34,727
I have even had to quit
Fright Night.

444
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,807
- I'll give you money.
- How much?

445
00:40:36,888 --> 00:40:38,808
I have a $500 savings bond.

446
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:40,128
I'll take it.

447
00:40:41,808 --> 00:40:47,207
Now, how are we going to cure
your little friend...

448
00:40:47,288 --> 00:40:49,127
ofthis delusion?

449
00:40:49,807 --> 00:40:51,688
I got it all figured out.

450
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:54,128
We all go next door
to the neighbour...

451
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,207
and you perform some kind of
vampire test on him...

452
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,287
to pronounce him human.

453
00:40:59,407 --> 00:41:02,808
You know.
Like in Orgy of the Damned?

454
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:05,688
Where you looked in the mirror...

455
00:41:05,808 --> 00:41:10,488
the guy didn't have a reflection,
so then you knew he was a vampire.

456
00:41:11,608 --> 00:41:13,008
Oh, yes.

457
00:41:15,408 --> 00:41:17,808
That was one
of my favourite roles.

458
00:41:21,288 --> 00:41:23,808
Do you know...

459
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:25,688
I still...

460
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:28,608
have the prop.

461
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:00,488
It's for you.

462
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,288
Yes, this is jerry Dandrige.

463
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,808
I see.

464
00:42:14,888 --> 00:42:16,208
Well, yes, of course.

465
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:19,288
I'm always willing
to help young people...

466
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:22,408
but I'm afraid that crosses
are out ofthe question.

467
00:42:22,488 --> 00:42:26,408
You see,
I've been reborn recently.

468
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:28,328
He's a reborn Christian.

469
00:42:28,408 --> 00:42:30,728
He thinks crosses
would be sacrilegious.

470
00:42:30,808 --> 00:42:34,729
- Ask him how he feels about holy water.
- How about holy water?

471
00:42:34,808 --> 00:42:36,128
No. Won't do either.

472
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:39,688
Tell him it's ordinary tap water.
All he has to do is sip it.

473
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:45,888
Oh, yes. Yes. Okay.
That sounds fine.

474
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:50,208
But don't bring him over
until 6:00 tomorrow.

475
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:52,328
I'll be out until then.

476
00:42:55,888 --> 00:42:58,888
Seems we don't have to go out
tonight after all.

477
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:03,128
His friends are bringing him over
tomorrow night...

478
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:05,288
to prove to him that I'm not...

479
00:43:06,328 --> 00:43:07,688
a vampire.

480
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:14,888
It's 6:10. He said
he was gonna be here at 6:00.

481
00:43:15,008 --> 00:43:17,288
He said he'd be here.
He'll be here.

482
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,688
Here he comes!

483
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:28,889
Thank you.
Charley Brewster, I presume.

484
00:43:29,008 --> 00:43:30,888
Peter Vincent, vampire killer.

485
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:34,008
I cannot tell you
how much I appreciate this.

486
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:35,889
Good evening.
Now, down to business.

487
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:40,208
Where is the lair of the suspected
creature ofthe night?

488
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,288
There.

489
00:43:43,208 --> 00:43:45,008
Oh, yes.
I see what you mean.

490
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:49,008
There is
a distinct possibility.

491
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:52,089
Now, shall we go?

492
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:54,488
Wait.
Where's your stakes and hammers?

493
00:43:54,608 --> 00:43:56,488
I left them in my bag.

494
00:43:56,609 --> 00:43:58,408
You're not going in there
without them.

495
00:43:58,488 --> 00:44:02,609
But I have to prove that he is a vampire
before I kill him, Charley.

496
00:44:02,728 --> 00:44:05,288
Look, I know he's a vampire!

497
00:44:05,408 --> 00:44:08,208
I am the one
who has to know, Charley.

498
00:44:08,328 --> 00:44:10,088
How are you gonna do that?

499
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:12,489
This is holy water.

500
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,008
If a drop touches him,
he will blister.

501
00:44:15,129 --> 00:44:17,289
I have asked him to drink it...

502
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:20,008
while we all watch.

503
00:44:20,088 --> 00:44:21,529
He readily agreed.

504
00:44:21,608 --> 00:44:24,888
But if I'm right and you prove
he is a vampire...

505
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,329
he'll kill us all.

506
00:44:26,408 --> 00:44:28,088
No, hewon't, Charley.

507
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,208
After all, I am here to protect you,
and I am Peter Vincent!

508
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:33,209
I know, Mr Vincent, but--

509
00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:35,689
Hey! Peter Vincent.

510
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:38,488
Billy Cole.

511
00:44:38,608 --> 00:44:39,608
This is a pleasure.

512
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:42,608
Won't you all come in?

513
00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:49,009
And Charley.

514
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:59,289
Hey,jer! They're here.

515
00:45:01,128 --> 00:45:03,288
Perhaps he didn't hear you.

516
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,689
He heard me, all right.

517
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,288
Mr Vincent.

518
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:29,928
I've seen all your films...

519
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:32,729
and I've found them...

520
00:45:32,808 --> 00:45:34,008
very amusing.

521
00:45:34,089 --> 00:45:36,088
Oh. Thank you.

522
00:45:37,689 --> 00:45:39,609
And who are these two...

523
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:43,289
attractive young people?

524
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,088
Ed Thompson.

525
00:45:47,409 --> 00:45:49,009
Amy Peterson.

526
00:46:08,809 --> 00:46:10,009
Charmed.

527
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:16,089
Isn't that what vampires
are supposed to do, Charley?

528
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,688
- Please.
- That's some vampire, Brewster.

529
00:46:20,809 --> 00:46:22,489
God, he's neat.

530
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:35,689
Please excuse the mess.
I haven't finished unpacking.

531
00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:38,409
Where do you keep your coffin?
Or do you have more than one?

532
00:46:38,488 --> 00:46:40,009
Charley!

533
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,089
It's all right, Mr Vincent.

534
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:45,009
I'm quite used to it by now.

535
00:46:45,129 --> 00:46:48,809
As you may or may not know, Charley even
brought the police over a few days ago.

536
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,329
Charley, you didn't!

537
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:54,329
Damn right I did. Only they didn't
believe me any more than any of you.

538
00:46:55,609 --> 00:46:56,809
But you'll believe me soon.

539
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:58,729
Give him the holy water.

540
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,209
Charley, there's no reason
to be rude about this.

541
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:05,809
It's perfectly all right,
MrVincent.

542
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:09,689
Where is it?

543
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:19,129
And are you sure
that this is holy water?

544
00:47:20,089 --> 00:47:21,209
Positive.

545
00:47:22,209 --> 00:47:25,009
I saw Father Scanlon
bless it myself.

546
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:29,129
Get ready to run.
I'll protect you.

547
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:41,290
Bottoms up.

548
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:57,289
There.

549
00:47:57,409 --> 00:47:58,889
Satisfied?

550
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:01,529
Totally.

551
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:06,089
Well, now, Charley,
you saw that.

552
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:10,729
Are you convinced now
that Mr Dandrige is not a vampire?

553
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:12,489
It can't be.

554
00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:14,809
But, Charley, you saw it.

555
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,889
You know as well as I do that
no vampire can drink blessed water.

556
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:21,929
Then it wasn't blessed.

557
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,089
Arey ou calling me a liar,
young man?

558
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,529
Ifhe's not a vampire...

559
00:48:27,609 --> 00:48:28,889
have him touch this.

560
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,289
You've made
a fool of yourself once.

561
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:38,089
There's no reason
to compound the error.

562
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:41,210
You've already caused your friends
quite enough pain.

563
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:50,489
You wouldn't want to cause them
any more, would you?

564
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,410
No, of course not.

565
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,130
Then you're finally convinced
I'm not a vampire either?

566
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,490
Right?

567
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:14,889
Yes.

568
00:49:15,009 --> 00:49:18,329
Well, I'm glad that's settled.

569
00:49:19,529 --> 00:49:22,890
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, Mr Vincent.

570
00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:25,689
-You've been a great help.
- Glad to be of service.

571
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:29,809
It was very nice meeting both of you.
Feel free to drop by anytime.

572
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:32,090
You'll always be welcome.

573
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,410
I'd like that, Mr Dandrige.

574
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:36,009
Please call me jerry.

575
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:38,010
Let's get out of here.

576
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:40,210
That goes for you too, Ed.

577
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:43,610
I expect we have a lot of the same
interests-- horror movies, the occult.

578
00:49:47,009 --> 00:49:49,009
Something wrong, Mr Vincent?

579
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:52,729
I just felt a little--

580
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:59,410
It was just my clumsiness.

581
00:50:01,809 --> 00:50:03,129
Are you sure?

582
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,609
I'm positive.

583
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,489
We have been taking up
much too much of your time.

584
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:11,409
Thank you so much.
Come along now, everybody.

585
00:50:12,889 --> 00:50:14,730
Thank you. Bye-bye.

586
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:20,490
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

587
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,289
- Then why are you shaking?
- I'm not shaking.

588
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,129
You saw something that convinced you
he was a vampire, didn'tyou?

589
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:30,009
- Of course not!
- Please, Mr Vincent.

590
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,089
You have to tell me.

591
00:50:32,209 --> 00:50:33,530
All right!

592
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,009
He didn't cast a reflection
in my mirror.

593
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,089
- Satisfied now?
- You have to call the police!

594
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,530
Shit!

595
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,810
Where are you goin',
pencil dick?

596
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:49,130
- Home!
- No way.

597
00:50:49,209 --> 00:50:51,289
We walkAmy home first.

598
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:56,410
Looks just like her,
doesn't she?

599
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:03,530
One good thing--

600
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:06,391
they'll never believe him now.

601
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,272
No?

602
00:51:20,272 --> 00:51:22,112
- Let's cut through here.
- No way!

603
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:25,311
We want people and lights.
The more, the better.

604
00:51:25,392 --> 00:51:28,512
Listen, Brewster,
vampires don't exist.

605
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:30,511
Haven't you figured that outyet?

606
00:51:30,592 --> 00:51:32,512
What if you're wrong, Evil?

607
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:35,392
What if Dandrige is a vampire
and he thinks you know it?

608
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:38,512
Would you walk down
that alley then?

609
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:42,591
Oh, fuck you, Brewster.

610
00:51:42,672 --> 00:51:45,072
Evil, just stick with us,
all right?

611
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:47,992
Forget it!
You may be chicken shit, but I'm not.

612
00:51:50,391 --> 00:51:52,191
- What'll we do?
- Let him go.

613
00:51:52,272 --> 00:51:55,592
No vampire's gonna want him anyway.
Probably give him blood poisoning.

614
00:52:01,712 --> 00:52:03,592
Jesus! I warned him!

615
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:06,512
He got me, Charley!
He bit me!

616
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:11,192
You know what you're gonna
have to do now, don'tyou?

617
00:52:11,312 --> 00:52:12,792
Kill me.

618
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,512
Kill me, Charley...

619
00:52:14,592 --> 00:52:17,472
before I turn into a vampire...

620
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,471
and giveyou a hickey!

621
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:22,992
You asshole!

622
00:52:24,792 --> 00:52:27,712
You really believed me,
you poor dope!

623
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,192
You'll get yours someday.

624
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,392
Oh, yeah ? When?
When I'm bit by a vampire?

625
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:35,992
There are no such things
as vampires, fruitcake!

626
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:24,112
Charley, Amy, is thatyou?

627
00:53:30,112 --> 00:53:32,272
It's not working.
I'm not scared.

628
00:54:49,312 --> 00:54:50,593
Hello, Edward.

629
00:54:53,073 --> 00:54:55,472
You don't have to be
afraid of me.

630
00:54:56,792 --> 00:54:58,592
I know what it's like
being different.

631
00:55:00,193 --> 00:55:02,393
Only they won't
pick on you any more...

632
00:55:03,392 --> 00:55:04,512
or beat you up.

633
00:55:06,392 --> 00:55:07,713
I'll see to that.

634
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:12,273
All you have to do
is take my hand.

635
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:14,392
Here, Edward.

636
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:16,272
Take my hand.

637
00:55:39,192 --> 00:55:40,992
What was that?

638
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:46,592
Just Evil
messing around again.

639
00:55:46,713 --> 00:55:50,712
Cut it out, Evil!
It's not funny!

640
00:55:50,793 --> 00:55:53,992
Amy, what if Evil
was really in trouble?

641
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:57,393
You're not gonna let him
sucker you in again, are you?

642
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:10,913
Don't tell me
this is a power outage.

643
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,993
Well, what else would it be?

644
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:03,873
Hey! You can't come in here!

645
00:57:16,113 --> 00:57:18,393
- Who are you calling?
- The police.

646
00:57:20,193 --> 00:57:21,313
Who is it?

647
00:57:21,393 --> 00:57:22,592
Me. Evil Ed.

648
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,072
- What do you want?
- There's a vampire out here.

649
00:57:25,193 --> 00:57:26,673
Let me in.

650
00:57:32,513 --> 00:57:33,992
What are we going to do?

651
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:37,593
What are you gonna do?

652
00:57:44,272 --> 00:57:45,873
Not me!

653
00:57:55,073 --> 00:57:58,273
I used to admire you.
You know that?

654
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,273
But, of course...

655
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,273
that was before...

656
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:05,473
I found out
what a fake you were!

657
00:58:05,593 --> 00:58:07,713
Peter Vincent...

658
00:58:07,793 --> 00:58:09,593
the great vampire killer!

659
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:40,113
What have you done to me?

660
00:58:40,193 --> 00:58:41,393
Back!

661
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:49,793
The masterwill kill you
for this.

662
00:58:49,873 --> 00:58:52,113
But not fast.

663
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:55,714
Slowly. Oh, so slowly.

664
00:58:55,793 --> 00:58:56,913
Back

665
00:58:58,273 --> 00:59:00,114
I say back!

666
00:59:06,593 --> 00:59:08,513
He doesn't believe me!

667
00:59:08,593 --> 00:59:12,913
I'm scared, Charley.
I'm really scared.

668
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:15,713
I am not going to let him
get you, Amy.

669
00:59:16,793 --> 00:59:18,593
I promise.

670
00:59:20,193 --> 00:59:22,393
You got Peter Vincent's number?

671
00:59:22,513 --> 00:59:27,473
He doesn't care about us!
I paid him to be there today.

672
00:59:27,593 --> 00:59:30,193
It doesn't matter, Amy.

673
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:33,993
We don't have any choice.
Now give me his number.

674
01:00:54,994 --> 01:00:56,914
Look, you've gotta help us.

675
01:00:56,993 --> 01:00:59,473
Dandrige has me and Amy
trapped in this club downtown.

676
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:01,194
No, Charley. I'm sorry.

677
01:01:01,314 --> 01:01:03,193
I just can't do that.

678
01:01:03,313 --> 01:01:06,913
You've gotta come. You're the only one
who knows what's going on.

679
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:45,314
Let her go.

680
01:03:53,194 --> 01:03:55,474
Filthy son of a bitch!

681
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:02,274
Shouldn't lose
your temper, Charley.

682
01:04:04,194 --> 01:04:05,714
It isn't polite.

683
01:04:05,794 --> 01:04:08,114
You can't kill me here.

684
01:04:09,194 --> 01:04:12,514
I don't wanna kill you, Charley.

685
01:04:12,594 --> 01:04:15,394
I want you to bring Peter Vincent
to my house-- just the two of you.

686
01:04:15,474 --> 01:04:19,714
That is, ifyou everwant
to see Amy again.

687
01:04:28,274 --> 01:04:30,274
- Let her go!
- I got him.

688
01:04:30,395 --> 01:04:33,074
- She's mine.
- You want chicken, go someplace else.

689
01:04:33,194 --> 01:04:35,074
- Out of my way.
- Move me.

690
01:04:39,474 --> 01:04:41,074
Leon!

691
01:05:57,595 --> 01:06:00,674
- Peter, open the door!
- Who is it?

692
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:02,675
It's me. Charley Brewster.
Let me in.

693
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:07,994
- Are you one of them?
- What are you talking about?

694
01:06:08,114 --> 01:06:11,475
Here. Grab this.

695
01:06:17,595 --> 01:06:19,194
Come on.

696
01:06:20,194 --> 01:06:21,995
We don't have very much time.

697
01:06:22,114 --> 01:06:24,394
Dandrige chased me and Amy
all over town.

698
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:26,914
He trapped us in a nightclub.

699
01:06:27,994 --> 01:06:30,194
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

700
01:06:30,275 --> 01:06:32,394
- You can't!
- just watch me.

701
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:34,674
But Dandrige has Amy!

702
01:06:34,795 --> 01:06:36,795
He's gonna kill her
unlesswe come to his house.

703
01:06:36,914 --> 01:06:40,275
Oh, my God. The police.
I'll call the police.

704
01:06:40,395 --> 01:06:43,715
No, Peter. No!
They won't believe you. I've tried.

705
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:47,314
Peter, it's just us.

706
01:06:48,595 --> 01:06:50,994
We're gonna have to save Amy.

707
01:06:51,075 --> 01:06:52,914
I can't.

708
01:07:00,275 --> 01:07:01,594
I...

709
01:07:04,515 --> 01:07:07,594
was paid to be there today.

710
01:07:07,715 --> 01:07:09,595
I know.

711
01:07:10,595 --> 01:07:12,394
And you still want me
to help you?

712
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:14,795
Yes!

713
01:07:14,915 --> 01:07:18,515
You're Peter Vincent,
the great vampire killer!

714
01:07:18,594 --> 01:07:20,914
That is a character in a movie!

715
01:07:22,515 --> 01:07:24,395
That isn't even my real name.

716
01:07:24,515 --> 01:07:26,915
I'm terrified.

717
01:07:28,915 --> 01:07:31,194
I'm sorry, Charley, but I am.

718
01:07:36,595 --> 01:07:39,995
I can't do it alone, Peter.

719
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:44,514
If you don't help,
Amy is gonna die.

720
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:46,395
Me too, probably.

721
01:07:49,475 --> 01:07:51,315
Please, Peter.

722
01:07:55,715 --> 01:07:58,395
I'm sorry, Charley.

723
01:08:36,795 --> 01:08:40,675
She's someone I knew
a long time ago.

724
01:08:54,675 --> 01:08:56,315
Where am I?

725
01:09:00,115 --> 01:09:01,875
Where's Charley?

726
01:09:04,995 --> 01:09:06,115
Where?

727
01:11:48,196 --> 01:11:50,595
Peter Vincent.
Ready to do battle with the undead.

728
01:11:50,676 --> 01:11:52,115
This is serious.

729
01:11:52,196 --> 01:11:54,995
I am serious. Here.
Hold this. Go on.

730
01:11:58,596 --> 01:12:00,796
Let's see.
Flashlight, stakes, hammer.

731
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,675
Ah, yes. Cross.

732
01:12:02,795 --> 01:12:04,995
What about Billy Cole?
How are you gonna stop him?

733
01:12:05,076 --> 01:12:08,115
I'm going to use this.
It is from Orgy ofthe Damned.

734
01:12:08,196 --> 01:12:11,596
What if he's not human?
Bullets aren't gonna stop him then.

735
01:12:11,676 --> 01:12:14,516
He walks around in the daylight,
now, doesn't he?

736
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:15,876
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

737
01:12:15,996 --> 01:12:19,316
Well, then.
He is human. Come on.

738
01:12:19,395 --> 01:12:21,076
You don't have to do this.

739
01:12:21,196 --> 01:12:23,075
- I want to thank you--
- Not now.

740
01:12:28,916 --> 01:12:30,676
What's wrong?

741
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:35,196
Nothing. Nothing at all.

742
01:12:39,076 --> 01:12:41,475
Are you crazy?

743
01:12:41,595 --> 01:12:43,395
Not the front door.

744
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:45,476
Let's go around the back
and sneak in.

745
01:12:51,195 --> 01:12:52,995
Too late.

746
01:12:56,275 --> 01:12:59,596
I am Peter Vincent...

747
01:12:59,715 --> 01:13:01,475
the great vampire killer.

748
01:13:21,716 --> 01:13:23,476
This way.

749
01:13:37,596 --> 01:13:39,476
Did you hear something?

750
01:13:41,076 --> 01:13:42,516
No.

751
01:13:44,196 --> 01:13:47,476
Let's come back at dawn.
You see, he'll be asleep then.

752
01:13:47,596 --> 01:13:49,596
We'll have a better chance
of getting Amy.

753
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,076
And Amy will be dead by then too.
Now come on.

754
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:13,996
Welcome to Fright Night.

755
01:14:23,996 --> 01:14:25,876
For real.

756
01:14:27,076 --> 01:14:28,516
Where's Amy?

757
01:14:28,596 --> 01:14:30,796
Up here.

758
01:14:30,916 --> 01:14:33,316
All you have to do
is get by me.

759
01:14:36,916 --> 01:14:39,476
Back, spawn of Satan!

760
01:14:44,596 --> 01:14:46,796
Oh, really?

761
01:15:03,397 --> 01:15:05,877
You have to have faith...

762
01:15:05,997 --> 01:15:08,116
for this to work on me...

763
01:15:08,197 --> 01:15:10,196
Mr Vincent.

764
01:15:17,797 --> 01:15:19,876
Stop!

765
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:21,077
Back

766
01:15:30,796 --> 01:15:32,276
We're gonna make it.

767
01:15:55,396 --> 01:15:57,076
Mrs Brewster!

768
01:16:02,596 --> 01:16:04,596
Operator, get me the--

769
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:15,196
Thank God.
The phone wires have been cut.

770
01:16:18,596 --> 01:16:19,996
I know.

771
01:16:22,117 --> 01:16:23,877
I did it!

772
01:16:25,876 --> 01:16:27,717
Where is Charley's mother?

773
01:16:32,996 --> 01:16:37,717
Well, apparently
she's working nights.

774
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:41,477
But she left a note.

775
01:16:50,996 --> 01:16:55,076
His dinner's in the oven!

776
01:20:12,397 --> 01:20:14,677
You wanted her.
There she is.

777
01:20:17,397 --> 01:20:20,118
Here. You're gonna need it.

778
01:20:20,197 --> 01:20:22,117
Just before dawn.

779
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:25,318
What haveyou done to her?

780
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:37,398
I'm gonna have to break
the door down.

781
01:22:37,478 --> 01:22:39,477
You make as much noise
asyou can.

782
01:22:41,478 --> 01:22:43,798
Help!

783
01:22:43,877 --> 01:22:45,878
Let me out!

784
01:22:47,317 --> 01:22:50,918
Please! Open the door!
Help! Somebody!

785
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:54,278
I think she just opened her eyes.

786
01:23:00,197 --> 01:23:01,997
All right. Grab her.
Let's get out ofhere.

787
01:23:02,117 --> 01:23:04,398
We can't. Look

788
01:23:08,198 --> 01:23:09,797
Oh, my God.

789
01:23:12,518 --> 01:23:14,278
Something wrong?

790
01:23:14,398 --> 01:23:17,798
Yes. We have a visitor.

791
01:23:19,397 --> 01:23:21,718
Is it too late to save her?

792
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:23,078
No.

793
01:23:24,278 --> 01:23:27,077
Not if we kill Dandrige
before dawn.

794
01:23:28,197 --> 01:23:29,798
Are you sure?

795
01:23:29,878 --> 01:23:32,198
So far, everything has been
like it was in movies.

796
01:23:32,278 --> 01:23:34,918
Now we just have to keep hoping.

797
01:23:37,798 --> 01:23:39,598
Let's go.

798
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:55,998
Well, what do we have here?

799
01:23:57,878 --> 01:23:59,717
Vampire killers?

800
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:05,398
Stop or I'll shoot.

801
01:24:07,398 --> 01:24:08,598
I mean it.

802
01:24:08,678 --> 01:24:10,598
Don't force me to shoot.

803
01:24:22,798 --> 01:24:23,798
Stop!

804
01:24:26,598 --> 01:24:28,118
We have him.

805
01:24:31,478 --> 01:24:33,398
Do you?

806
01:24:37,798 --> 01:24:39,718
What did he mean by that?

807
01:24:40,678 --> 01:24:43,198
Nothing.
He was just bluffing.

808
01:26:44,118 --> 01:26:45,399
She's worse!

809
01:26:45,478 --> 01:26:47,879
Come on.
We're running out oftime.

810
01:27:00,678 --> 01:27:02,519
Amy.

811
01:27:03,798 --> 01:27:05,119
Awake.

812
01:27:06,598 --> 01:27:09,478
I command you...

813
01:27:09,598 --> 01:27:13,318
to awake!

814
01:27:19,799 --> 01:27:24,599
Show me how much
you love me, Amy.

815
01:27:25,599 --> 01:27:27,999
Kill them...

816
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,678
both!

817
01:27:37,799 --> 01:27:39,478
He's on the roof.

818
01:27:39,598 --> 01:27:41,398
I'm going up there.

819
01:28:11,199 --> 01:28:13,319
He's not up here.

820
01:28:13,399 --> 01:28:15,199
Look out!

821
01:28:17,598 --> 01:28:19,479
He's going downstairs.

822
01:28:32,398 --> 01:28:35,479
So.

823
01:28:47,799 --> 01:28:48,998
Stay back

824
01:28:53,999 --> 01:28:55,199
Back

825
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:09,718
You have to have faith
for that to work..

826
01:29:09,799 --> 01:29:12,879
Mr Vincent!

827
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:15,119
Remember?

828
01:29:56,599 --> 01:30:01,599
You're out oftime,
Mr Dandrige.

829
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:03,719
Look overyour shoulder.

830
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:17,479
Back!

831
01:30:56,879 --> 01:30:59,479
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Quick He's in the basement.

832
01:31:09,879 --> 01:31:12,600
Quick his coffin has got to be
down here somewhere.

833
01:31:30,599 --> 01:31:31,999
What was that?

834
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:34,680
You keep searching.
I'll check it out.

835
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:52,679
Amy?

836
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:54,800
It's me.

837
01:31:54,879 --> 01:31:56,119
I know.

838
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:17,119
I found it.

839
01:32:18,999 --> 01:32:20,880
Don't be frightened, Charley.

840
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,680
Hurry. Get it open!

841
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:24,200
He's locked it
from the inside.

842
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,119
What's wrong?

843
01:32:29,599 --> 01:32:32,879
Don't you want me any more?

844
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:42,280
It's not my fault, Charley.

845
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,520
You promised
you wouldn't let him get me!

846
01:32:46,599 --> 01:32:48,799
You promised!

847
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,000
Charley, watch out!

848
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,000
Amy!

849
01:37:19,201 --> 01:37:21,720
Look! We've been
going in a circle.

850
01:37:21,801 --> 01:37:23,800
We're right back
where we started from.

851
01:37:23,881 --> 01:37:28,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fright Night Theatre.

852
01:37:28,281 --> 01:37:30,400
This is Peter Vincent...

853
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,321
back once more with you...

854
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:35,801
as host of Fright Night.

855
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:40,601
I thought I'd let the vampires
rest for a little while.

856
01:37:43,201 --> 01:37:44,601
Right, Charley?

857
01:37:46,121 --> 01:37:50,120
Tonight, the threat comes
not from beyond the grave...

858
01:37:50,201 --> 01:37:53,081
but from beyond the stars...

859
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:57,201
as alien beings stalk
an unwary summer camp...

860
01:37:57,321 --> 01:38:00,921
in Mars Wants Flesh.

861
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:03,881
I do not star in it.

862
01:38:25,601 --> 01:38:27,000
Is something wrong?

863
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:33,880
Nothing.

864
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,681
Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!
