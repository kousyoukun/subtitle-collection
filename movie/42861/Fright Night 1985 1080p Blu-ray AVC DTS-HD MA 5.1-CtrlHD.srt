165
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,716
Charley, are you
listening to me?

166
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,301
<i>MAN ON TV: The badly
mutilated corpse</i>

167

169
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,641
You know what I heard
on the police band last night?

170
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,309
What?

171
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,478
That wasn't
the only murder.

172
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,147
The second in two days.

173
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,650
And get this...

174
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:53,070
Both of them had
their heads chopped off.

175
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,906
(CHUCKLES)
Can you believe it?

176
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:57,491
You're sick.

177
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,662
Hey!

00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:03,372

What are you doing?

184
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,595
Nothing.

185
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,888
Oh, yeah?

186
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:06,101
Well, just make sure
it stays that way, kid.

What, what, what?

193
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,592
He has fangs!
The guy who bought the house has fangs.

Oh, fangs. That's lovely Charley!

What are you...

This microwave never melts

205
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,327
Drink that.

Mom, I don't need hot cocoa.
I didn't have a nightmare.

They did kill
a girl over there.

How late did you
stay up studying?

Mom, I'm not sick!

210
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,008
The guy did have fangs, and
a bat did fly over my head.

211
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,427
And a second later he
stepped out of the shadows.

212
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,928
Don't you see
what that means?

213
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,055
Wait let me guess. What?

214
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,933
He's a vampire.

215
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:00,353
A What?

216
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:04,107
A Vampire! Damn it, haven't you
listened to anything I have said?

217
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:11,698
Charley, is this some sort
of a trick to get me back?

218
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,452
Forget it.
I'm going to the police.

219
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,954
Charley, you can't go to the
police with a story like that.

220
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,039
They'll lock you up.

221
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,708
All right, then I won't
tell them he's a vampire.

222
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,878
But I'll tell them
about the two women.

Yes?

No, come on in.

LENNOX: Quite a place
you have here.

231
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,091
BILLY: Yeah,
we're restoring it.

232
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,926
Where is
Mr. Dandrige?

233
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,262
He's away on business.
ls there anything I can help with?

234
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,264
A murder occurred
last night.

235
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,518
Charley lives next door, thinks
he saw the victim in this house.

236
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:25,563
Jerry and I were
the only people here.

237
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,484
That's a lie. He carried her
body out in a plastic bag.

238
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,903
What do you say
to that, Mr. Cole?

239
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,655
The kid's crazy,
officer.

240
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,074
I took some bags
of trash out last night.

241
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,284
Amy.
BILLY: Let me show you.

242
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:42,413
The bag I saw had a body in it.
Not trash.

243
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,959
You actually
see the body, Charley?

244
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,419
No, but---

245
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,966
I'll show you the bags
I put in the garbage.

246
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,009
Okay, let's see them.

247
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,886
Look I can prove
he's lying!

248
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,182
Look in the basement.

249
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,934
What's down there,
Charley?

250
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,854
Yes, Charley.
What's down there?

251
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,860
Obviously,
the boy's made a mistake.

252
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,488
A coffin.
I saw them carry it in.

253
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:17,699
What?

254
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,367
You'll find
Jerry Dandrige in it,

255
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,785
sleeping the sleep
of the undead!

256
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,287
Ooh!
(LAUGHS)

257
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,874
What are you saying?

258
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:27,667
He's a vampire.

259
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,504
I saw him in that room last night.
He had fangs, and he bit her neck.

260
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,965
For heaven's sake!
Come on.

261
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:37,051
We can't leave
like this!

262
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,179
LENNOX: I've got
a coffin for you.

263
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,896
Lieutenant, please,
please listen to me.

264
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,690
Jerry Dandrige
is a vampire.

265
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,942
Sure, and I'm Dirty Harry.
Now let me tell you something, kid.

266
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,361
If I ever catch your ass
at the station again,

267
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,405
I'm throwing it
in jail forever!

268
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,033
Lieutenant, please.
Just listen to me.

269
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:04,037
I know its crazy,
but... Lieutenant!

00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,174
Evil! Evil!

274
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:02,011
To what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

275
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,515
The vampire knows I know about
him, or he will tonight.

276
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,976
(CHUCKLING) What are
you talking about?

277
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,436
A vampire lives
next door to me.

278
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,772
He'll kill me unless
I protect myself.

279
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,900
(LAUGHS) What?

280
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,361
Evil, I can't explain.

281
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,613
Tell me how
to protect myself.

282
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,116
Very funny.

283
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:26,661
I'm not kidding.
Tell me what to do.

284
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,496
Don't call me Evil!

285
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,250
Why should I help you?

286
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,963
I've got eight bucks.
Help me and it's yours.

287
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:42,302
Far be it for me to turn
down a fool's money.

288
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:46,347
Now...

289
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,520
Where and when do you expect
the vampire to attack?

290
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,480
In my bedroom tonight.

291
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:01,321
Start With this.

292
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,197
But...

293
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:08,036
You must have total faith
in it for it to work.

294
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,831
Put links of garlic
around your neck

295
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:13,666
and hang some
from your window.

296
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,169
If he comes for you,
that will be the way.

297
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,505
Then there's holy water,

298
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:23,926
but a priest has to say
a blessing over it first.

299
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:29,349
That's it?
I'm afraid so.

300
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,768
Your best protection now,
Charles,

301
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:37,523
is that a vampire cannot enter
your house without being invited

302
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,692
by the rightful owner first.

303
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,528
Are you sure?
Positive!

304
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,865
Thank you.

305
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,258
JUDY: Charley,
could you come down here?

306
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,760
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

307
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,762
(WHISTLING) Yeah, mom.

308
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:10,598
(HUMMING)

309
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:16,354
Charley, this is our
neighbor, Jerry Dandrige.

310
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,242
Hello, Charley.

311
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,500
Well, Charley, don't be rude.
Shake hands.

312
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,303
What's he doing here?

313
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:51,305
I invited him for drinks.

314
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,307
What?

315
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,602
I invited him over.
Why?

316
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,937
What's wrong?

317
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,481
Afraid I'd never come
without being invited?

318
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,734
You're right.

319
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,612
Now that I've been
made welcome,

320
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,364
I'll probably
drop by quite a bit.

321
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,452
In fact, anytime
I feel like it.

322
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:17,957
With your mother's
kind permission, of course.

323
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,209
Oh, anytime.

for instance?

489
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,842
ED: Yeah!
I tried him already.

490
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:08,096
Well, why don't you let us try
again before you do anything.

491
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,724
There's not enough time, Amy!

492
00:39:10,724 --> 00:39:15,228
What if you go into that
house alone and he gets you?

493
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:17,564
Who's gonna stop him then?

494
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,568
Yeah, then he'll be able to suck
his way through the entire town.

495
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,781
But it wouldn't be
much of a loss.

496
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:29,451
Charley, it's going
to be dark soon.

497
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:32,871
You don't want to go into
that house then, do you?

498
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,624
No. You're right there.

499
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,213
All right,
we'll try him again.

500
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,297
Great!

501
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,216
Now, you promise you're
not gonna do anything

00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,718
till you
hear from us, okay?

503
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,055
Okay. Come on.

do you?

I love you, Charley.

Mr. Vincent, could we
talk to you for a moment?

511
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:26,133
Oh, well, I'm afraid
now is not the best time.

00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,342
Please.

513
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:29,261
It's very important.

(STUTTERING) If you would just
wait there for one moment,

516
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,688
Come in!

00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:44,025
Now, what can
I do for you?

(STAMMERING)

519
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,779
An autograph, perhaps,

520
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:52,784
or perhaps an interview
for your school newspaper?

521
00:40:52,868 --> 00:40:55,036
I'm afraid this is
much more important.

522
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,415
Really?

523
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,462
What could be more important
than my autograph?

Saving a boy's life.

Oh, yes.

526
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,511
I can see where that
could be more important.

527
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:16,308
Perhaps you would
care to explain.

528
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,353
You remember a fruitcake kid
named Charley Brewster?

529
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:21,521
He said he came
to see you.

530
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,981
No.

531
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,650
He's the one that believes a vampire
is living next door to him.

532
00:41:26,026 --> 00:41:28,487
Oh, yes. You know,
he is insane.

533
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:34,534
Oh, my dear, I do hope
he's not a friend of yours.

534
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:37,662
Yeah, she's got
the hots for the creep.

Amy!

536
00:41:39,456 --> 00:41:41,041
We need your help
to stop him, Mr. Vincent.

537
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,544
See, he really does believe his
next door neighbor is a vampire

538
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,837
and he's planning
to kill him.

539
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:49,174
Yeah. With a stake
through the heart.

540
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,512
Are you two serious?

541
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:59,726
Your friend needs a psychiatrist,
not a vampire killer.

542
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,269
Please, Mr. Vincent.

543
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:02,687
I'm afraid not.

00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:06,024
You see,

I have a $500

549

I'll take it.

550
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:25,126
Now, how are we
going to cure

551
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,046
your little friend
of his delusion?

552
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,216
I got it all
figured out.

553
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,218
We all go next door
to the neighbor,

554
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:37,222
and you perform some kind
of vampire test on him

555
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,057
to pronounce him human.

the guy didn't have
a reflection,

559
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,236
and then you knew
he was a vampire.

Yes.

561
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,577
That was one of
my favorite roles.

Well, yes.
Yes, of course.

I'm always willing
to help young people,

but I'm afraid that crosses
are out of the question.

would be sacrilegious.

about holy water?

How about holy water?

No.

Tell him it's just ordinary tap water.

Oh, I left that
in my bag.

You're not going in
there without them!

Look, I know
he's a vampire!

I am the one
who has to know, Charley.

609

How're you gonna do that?

610

This is holy water.

611
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:03,094
If a drop touches him,
he will blister.

612
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:08,141
In this case, I've asked him to
drink it while we all watch.

He readily agreed.

614

Yeah, but, Mr. Vincent, if I am right
and you prove he is a vampire,

he's gonna kill us all
right then and there.
