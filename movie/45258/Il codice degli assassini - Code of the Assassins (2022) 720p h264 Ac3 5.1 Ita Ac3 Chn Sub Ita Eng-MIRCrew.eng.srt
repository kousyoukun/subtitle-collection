<i>One of the 4 assassins of the Ghost Valley.</i>

4
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:45,134
<i>I entered the Valley under the recommendation of...</i>

5
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,292
<i>My master Commander Gui Chou...</i>

6
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,449
<i>to become one of the Valley's 12 generation of assassins.</i>

7
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,006
<i>During one of the unrests.</i>

8
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,002
<i>I lost my air while protecting the Valley.</i>

9
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,999
<i>The overlord of the Valley, Golden Mask...</i>

10
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:03,356
<i>gave me an artitect...</i>

<i>The Arm of Asura.</i>

12
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,017
<i>Everyone who has joined the Valley...</i>

13
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,856
<i>has the same goal.</i>

14
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:24,215
<i>Revenge.</i>

15
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:26,812
<i>When I was young...</i>

16
00:02:26,853 --> 00:02:27,771
<i>My father</i>

<i>a copper map depicting hidden ancient treasures.</i>

19
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:37,002
<i>My entire clan of 37 relatives were massacred for it.</i>

20
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:41,197
<i>The map has been lost.</i>

21
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,995
<i>The search for the map...</i>

22
00:02:44,236 --> 00:02:46,608
<i>has led to bloodbaths across the realm.</i>

23
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:47,391
<i>Now.</i>

24
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:49,829
<i>The treasure map has been found.</i>

25
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,785
<i>is this some kind of conspiracy?</i>

26
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,743
<i>Who is behind it?</i>

27
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>I have to avenge...</i>

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,377
<i>my murdered family.</i>

29
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:03,176
<i>It has to be me...</i>

30
00:03:03,776 --> 00:03:04,974
<i>who unravel...</i>

31
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:07,931

<i>East Mulberry</i>

00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:02,675
My lord...

34
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:04,075
I have investigaded.

35
00:04:04,555 --> 00:04:07,111
The copper map pf lost ancient treasures has vanished...

36
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,269
is now in the possession of the Governor of Border City.

37
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,547
Then why didn't he turn it in?

38
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,465
I sent my messengers to him twice...

39
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:15,343
But both times he retused to.

40
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:17,181
If the map were taken by a nostile state.

41
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,460
They can retrileve the treasure...

42
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:20,738
and will launch an invasion.

43
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,654
Then...

44
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:26,692
Brother.

45
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:28,730
You have no cause for concern.

46
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,487
If tou had listened to my advice and struck first.

47
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:34,004
We'd have been the overlord of the realm.

48
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:35,124
Prince Rui. That is not true.

49
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,642
Zhao Chuang.

50
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,838
Don't forget.

51
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,238
I was the one who promoted you...

52
00:04:41,278 --> 00:04:43,036
to the rank of General in the Forbidden Army.

53
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,829
I'd have thought it was some big deal.

54
00:04:57,542 --> 00:04:58,540
My lord.

55
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,658
Please don't worry.

56
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:03,335
Governor Gu is a greedy man.

57
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,374
I, Zhao Chuang...

58
00:05:04,415 --> 00:05:05,693
am willing to travel there on my own...

59
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:07,171
and bribe him with a rarge sum.

60
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,729
So that the copper map...

61
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,009
can be returned to my lord.

62
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:12,047
General Zhao.

63
00:05:13,086 --> 00:05:14,684
If you go there on your own.

64
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:16,921
It'd be a very dangerous mission.

65
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,840
For the safety of our country...

66
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,839
It is...

67
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,477
my obligation to do so.

68

69
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,976
My lord.

70
00:05:43,097 --> 00:05:44,774
Lady Fleur has been waiting.

71
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,049
It looks really nice.

72
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:51,727
Be careful with the thread.

73
00:05:53,126 --> 00:05:54,804
You're always so clumsy.

74
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:56,842
How about this thread?

75
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:57,561
It is good.

76
00:05:58,361 --> 00:05:59,678
My lady, how about this?

77
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,398
This one will do.

78
00:06:00,998 --> 00:06:02,516
Ming, get me a pearl.

79
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:03,715
Is this suiable?
Yes.

80
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:05,473
My lady, you've put so much care and effort...

81
00:06:05,514 --> 00:06:06,472
into embroidering this royal robe.

82
00:06:06,593 --> 00:06:07,431
I've said before...

83
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:09,349
T must craft it with my own hands.

84
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:11,627
The lord is lucky.

85
00:06:16,663 --> 00:06:17,301
My lord.

86
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:22,176
I've found out that.

87
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:24,095
The country of East Mulberry will issue a secret decree.

88
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,613
Chai Sheng will send Zhao Chuang...

89
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:27,451
to the Governor of their Border City.

90
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,729
The trip is to receover the lost treasure map.

91
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:31,887
Zhao Chuang.

92
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,764
People call him "the silent wolf".

93
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,162
The reticent ones...

94
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,480
are often only reiuctant to speak their minds.

95
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,557
He was able to win Chai Sheng's trust.

96
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,236
shows that he shouldn't be underestimated.

97
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:43,515
Should we....

98
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:44,954
elimmate him as soon as possible.

99
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,152
To elimmate him...

100
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,110
one doesn't need to do so in the name of South Pagoda.

101
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,386
Don't worry.

102
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:55,024
I will deliver this map...

103
00:06:55,064 --> 00:06:56,342
to you without issue.

104
00:07:02,776 --> 00:07:04,614
Back in the day, people have forewarned me.

105
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,892
Said that you're a scarlet woman.

106
00:07:07,212 --> 00:07:08,889
And warned me not to be with you.

107
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:12,086
You're starting to regret it.

I can't imagine Prince Rui...

00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,806
would pay a visit to tramps like us.

112

Golden Mask. I have

113
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:38,703
a favour to ask.

114
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,796
Your highness has an army of thousands.

115
00:08:42,197 --> 00:08:44,314
You don't need our involvement.

116
00:08:45,034 --> 00:08:46,911
What I'm asking your grace...

117
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:49,428
is something I'm not at liberty to do.

118
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:51,826
When the deed is done.

119
00:08:52,507 --> 00:08:56,222
I'll make sureto repay you with our assitance.

120
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:59,259
I want you to retrieve...

121
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,617
A copper treasure map from my governor.

122
00:09:02,337 --> 00:09:03,495
And then...

123
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:10,527
Assassinate the General of may Forbidden Army.

124
00:09:10,648 --> 00:09:11,527
Zhao Chuang.

125
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:19,959
God have mercy.

126
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,956
I, Zhao Chuang, pray to god.

127
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:23,307
To protect and ensure...

The last commandment from the Valley.

135
00:10:10,988 --> 00:10:14,024
Let go of hatred and prevail in righteousness.

136
00:10:14,065 --> 00:10:16,902
Now Prince Rui asks us for a favour.

137
00:10:17,262 --> 00:10:19,299
The Valley can leverage his might...

138
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,656
and do some good in these turbulent times.

139
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:24,294
It's not hard to kill Zhao Chuang.

140
00:10:24,934 --> 00:10:26,332
But for the copper map...

141
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,130
It's been a matter of dispute for years.

142
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,695
If your grace doesn't mind my old age.

143
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,003
I willing to get to the bottom of this myself.

Who we will send...

145
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,597
will be announced at the lantern festival tomorrow night.

146
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,554
Buts don't involve your pupil in this no matter what.

147
00:10:43,636 --> 00:10:46,072
The copper map caused the annihiration of his entire family.

148
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,069
I don't want him to complicate things.

149
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,547
The map appearing at this time.

150
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,623

I knew you'd be here to watch to play.

156
00:11:44,055 --> 00:11:45,133
I bought some smoke for you on the way.

157
00:11:45,573 --> 00:11:46,651
Try it.

158
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,129
If you like it, I'll get you more.

159

I still haven't found my family's murderer.

165
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,789
Therer's got to be a huge plot behind it

166
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:11,306
The treasure map is my only lead.

167
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:12,785
I must take it back.

168
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:15,063
You know.

169
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,780
Why do I want to see the play?

170
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,738
Because all I wanted was to watch in the audience.

171
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:23,534
Instead of being forced to take to the stage.

172
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,892
But this drama of the treasure map...

173
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,929
has been unfolding for decades.

174
00:12:30,368 --> 00:12:32,366
I don't want my pupil...

175
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,162
to be forced to take to the stage.

176
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:38,639
I know that the Valley...

177
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,597
will send someone to find the whereabouts of the map.

178
00:12:41,038 --> 00:12:42,475
I hope master...

179
00:12:43,475 --> 00:12:44,714
will send me.

180
00:12:45,314 --> 00:12:45,712
Master.

181
00:12:45,713 --> 00:12:47,351
It's about time for the riddles

182
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,586
We give out 108 prizes for riddles everyday here at Glass Beach.

183
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:53,025
It's the right time.

184
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:55,302
The person who will carry out this mission...

185
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:58,500
will be announced by Golden Mask's people at the lantern festival.

186
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,646
The winner today is...

187
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:14,483
Mountain Ghost

188
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,596
A mission of the importance...

189
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:24,018
how can they send Mountain Ghost.

190
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,751
No one can stop me.

191
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:32,345
I've made a promise to myself...

192
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:34,143
on my first day in the Valley...

193
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:36,741
I'll leave the Valley as soon as
I've the chance to avenge my family.

194
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:39,698
To find a world that truly belongs to me.

195
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:41,417
At the moment...

196
00:13:41,577 --> 00:13:43,254
I'm excited beyond reason.

197
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:46,116
I don't know whether it's because I'm about to find.
Clues for me to take my revenge

198
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,248
Or because I see the bright lights of the future.

199
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:56,122
<i>Dragon Temple</i>

200
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,834
You! You maneuver the dragon body.

201
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:04,993
Give me a chance.

202
00:14:05,034 --> 00:14:07,031
Can I try the head this time?

203
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:11,906
Here.

204
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:13,344
Your change.

205
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,662
Pancakes.

206
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,460
Hot pancakes.

207
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:35,162
Don't underestimate me.

208
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:36,801
They can me the Oracle.

209
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:38,439
If I say you're to live, you will not die.

210
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,638
If I say you're to die, there's no way you can live.

211
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,918
Wait a minute.

212
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:42,295
Do we...

213
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:44,653
know each other?

214
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:49,368
When will this blizzard end?

215
00:15:56,642 --> 00:15:58,119
Come on, the dragon dance is about to start.

216
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:58,599
Come.

217
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,958
Come here, the dragon dance is about to start.

218
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,437
Come on.

219
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,197
Hurry up

220
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:02,835
Come here, the dragon dance is about to start.

221
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,564
Governor Gu.

222
00:16:33,605 --> 00:16:34,883
You have to understand.

223
00:16:35,403 --> 00:16:37,281
The news that you have the treasure map in your possession...

224
00:16:37,402 --> 00:16:38,599
is now widely known.

225
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:40,916
Lord Chai...

226
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,913
is offering you 100 catty of gold...

227
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:47,030
in exchange of the copper treasure map.

228
00:16:50,229 --> 00:16:52,266
Why do you think I'd be willing to give it up?

229
00:16:53,705 --> 00:16:56,141
You've seen the map.

230
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,179
The treasures it depicts...

231
00:16:58,261 --> 00:17:00,097
are hidden in the capital.

232
00:17:00,338 --> 00:17:02,216
You won't be able to take them on your own.

233
00:17:21,877 --> 00:17:23,178
<i>Mountain Ghost</i>

234
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:37,900
Fine.

235
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:55,443
Give me.

236
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,413
Who are you?

237
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:10,107
Blue Asura.

238
00:20:10,228 --> 00:20:11,106
I'll take it from here.

239
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,649
- You go ahead and grab the treasure map.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:58,519
Blue Asura.

241
00:21:58,959 --> 00:21:59,718
That's me.

242
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:10,667
Who are you?

243
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,127
Don't follow me.

244
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:31,006
Don't go.

245
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:32,924
You aren't following orders.

246
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:41,915
You'd like to see the dragon dance?

247
00:22:57,421 --> 00:22:58,938
I'll play with you next time.

248
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:26,072
Close the city gate.

249
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:26,950
I want to take them alive.

250
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:28,069
Yes, sir.

251
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,548
Go ahead, I'm fine.

252
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:30,028
Yes, sir.

253
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,876
Governor Gu, sorry to have kept you waiting.

254
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:23,593
Meng Die.

255
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:35,521
You attacked him...

256
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:37,400
and destroyed my leads.

257
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:40,877
I know you're from my Valley, in disguise

258
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:30,946
You know who I am?

259
00:27:31,546 --> 00:27:32,904
You're from my Valley.

260
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,463
Blue Asura.

261
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,218
Obey your orders.

262
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:51,765
Did the Valley send you?

263
00:28:04,913 --> 00:28:06,750
<i>White</i>

264
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,828
Is that White Judge?

265
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,498
<i>White Judge</i>

266
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:21,216
Blue Asura.

267
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,054
You have the nerve to break the Valley's rule.

268
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:26,371
Causing the death of 5 brothers from the Valley.

269
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:28,649
Give me the copper map.

270
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:29,847
And return to the Valley with me.

271
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:34,043
We've been double-crossed.

272
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:37,319
That's the standards...

273
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,198
of a pupil of the Commander.

274
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:40,277
Don't criticise my master.

275
00:28:40,317 --> 00:28:41,955
So what if I criticise him?

276
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,849
I, Judge...

277
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:45,792
have the authority to declare him guilty.

278
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:46,870
Can you beat him in a fight?

279
00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:48,502
- How can you declare him guilty?
- Who said so?

280
00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:49,508
I said so.

281
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:52,904
The both of you.

282
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:54,462
Which one of you is a better fighter?

283
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:56,101
Me, of course.

284
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:03,733
White Judge.

285
00:29:03,894 --> 00:29:05,316
Do you have the guts to spar with me?

286
00:29:05,372 --> 00:29:06,011
What kind of weapon?

287
00:29:06,691 --> 00:29:07,769
On her count of three.

288
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,207
We'll each throw our dart...

289
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:12,508
- See who is quicker.
- Agree.

290
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:13,995
You asked for trouble.

291
00:29:33,025 --> 00:29:33,943
One...

292
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:35,781
Slow down.

293
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:43,014
Two...

294
00:29:46,771 --> 00:29:47,290
Three.

295
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:03,153
You little bastard.

296
00:30:03,195 --> 00:30:05,352
There's an assassin.

297
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:07,550
Capture the assassin.

298
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,908
Cone on, catch him.

299
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:10,067
You go over there...

300
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:10,506
Yes, sir.

301
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:11,465
You go there.

302
00:30:11,507 --> 00:30:11,985
Yes, sir.

303
00:30:12,026 --> 00:30:12,784
Over there, hurry.

304
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:19,897
Here's your beveraga, sir.

305
00:30:21,297 --> 00:30:22,750
Waiter, where my drink?

306
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:51,825
Master.

307
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:54,822
The word in the Valley is...

308
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:57,660
Your attempt to retrive the treasure map...

309
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,137
has put 5 of your Valley brothers in harm's way.

310
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,694
Golden Mask has made a ruling...

311
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,251
You didn't just break the rules...

312
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,128
But you are a traitor to the Valley.

313
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:13,204
Master.

314
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:17,639
It's not that simple.

315
00:31:20,357 --> 00:31:22,034
There must be secrets inside the pearl.

316
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:27,110
Jun-yuan.

317
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,147
I advise you to stop.

318
00:31:30,228 --> 00:31:31,066
No.

319
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,144
I must find out the secret of the treasure map.

320
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:36,900
If I capture you.

321
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,138
I'd betray my heart.

322
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:40,856
But if I don't capture you...

323
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:43,733
I'd betray the Valley.

324
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:46,490
What do you want me to do?

325
00:31:49,648 --> 00:31:51,525
Unless my machete cannot...

326
00:31:52,206 --> 00:31:54,282
take you down.

327
00:31:58,679 --> 00:31:59,917
I swing my blade...

328
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:01,316
and hit you in the stomach.

329
00:32:04,273 --> 00:32:04,792
Master...

330
00:32:04,873 --> 00:32:05,791
My legs...

331
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:07,550
kick you.

332
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,506
But when I'm about to turn around.

333
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:12,744
You hit my right arm with your dart.

334
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:14,342
Throw your dart.

335
00:32:17,141 --> 00:32:17,939
Your dart.

336
00:32:30,567 --> 00:32:31,365
Take me hostage.

337
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,444
The woman who carry out missions for the Valley.

338
00:32:33,924 --> 00:32:34,602
Run.

339
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:36,959
I certainly can't...

340
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,318
capture a traitor like you at the expense of...

341
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,636
sacrificing the more important mission for the Valley.

342
00:32:41,636 --> 00:32:43,034
That's why, all I can do...

343
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:44,592
is to let you go.

344
00:33:00,457 --> 00:33:01,775
Master.

345
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,493
Take care of yourself.

346
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:08,089
Black Judge is next.

347
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:11,245
You be careful.

348
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,839
Let me take a look...

349
00:33:57,879 --> 00:33:59,557
what the Valley asks you to do.

350
00:34:04,713 --> 00:34:07,389
<i>Take the treasure map from Governor Gu.</i>

351
00:34:07,431 --> 00:34:09,827
<i>Deliver it to the Pavilion of the Eight Gods.</i>

352
00:34:09,867 --> 00:34:12,304
<i>The Valley will arrange for receipt.</i>

353
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,178
What is your name?

354
00:34:20,098 --> 00:34:21,456
Qin Shengsheng.

355
00:34:21,816 --> 00:34:22,854
How did you know

356
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,052
I'd be going to Dragon Temple today?

357
00:34:25,612 --> 00:34:26,970
I didn't know.

358
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:30,047
I was sitting at a fortune teller's stall.

359
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:32,125
I drew a fortune stick.

360
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,679
Was it accurate?

361
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,035
The ones in the past were accurate.

362
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,192
I don't know about future ones.

363
00:34:44,393 --> 00:34:45,551
That's right.

364
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,429
For assassins like us...

365
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:50,706
The future is unpredictable.

366
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,338
Mind if I read the poem of the fortune stick?

367
00:35:04,693 --> 00:35:05,571
I've thrown it away.

368
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:14,602
But I remember the poem.

369
00:35:16,002 --> 00:35:17,855
<i>Alone and adrift.</i>

370
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,436
<i>Hoping for the weather to clear.</i>

371
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,514
<i>Years go by in a putt of smoke.</i>

372
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:25,831
<i>Snowflakes fly and I ask why.</i>

373
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:28,508
<i>Drfting along the stream.</i>

374
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,943
<i>Finally meeting a hero for one night's drink into oblivion.</i>

375
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:36,700
<i>But what if we're not destined for each other.</i>

376
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:40,776
<i>And the fear of parting becomes my new sorrow.</i>

377
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,447
How did you end up in the Ghost Valley?

378
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,723
My parents abandoned me when I was young.

379
00:35:54,283 --> 00:35:55,921
I was persecuted.

380
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:57,719
But the Valley saved me.

381
00:36:02,635 --> 00:36:04,073
I heard that your arm was chopped off...

382
00:36:04,473 --> 00:36:06,869
by your lover in the Valley.

383
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:08,149
Is that true?

384
00:36:14,063 --> 00:36:15,541
She did it against her will.

385
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,459
We were all victims.

386
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,298
Who told you?

387
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:21,096
Everyone in the Valley knows.

388
00:36:21,296 --> 00:36:22,414
I don's want to talk about this anymore.

389
00:36:22,455 --> 00:36:23,014
What happened to her?

390
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:24,452
She died.

391
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,769
I want to know.

392
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:30,087
Why can's you forget her.

393
00:36:30,846 --> 00:36:32,924
Even after she'd chopped your arm off?

394
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:39,797
She told me before she died.

395
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:42,154
As long as I have the Arm of Asura with me.

396
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:44,592
She's there with me.

397
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,556
Why did anyone know the Valley's mission ahead of time.

398
00:37:21,037 --> 00:37:22,594
Those four Warriors from the West.

399
00:37:22,795 --> 00:37:24,552
Set their eyes on me as their taget.

400
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,829
How did they know I'd be involved?

401
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,626
It seemed like a trap set for me.

402
00:37:33,304 --> 00:37:36,100
I'm sure Qin saved me with her music

403
00:37:37,221 --> 00:37:38,898
But why didn't she admit to it.

404
00:37:39,937 --> 00:37:41,895
I only went to draw a fortune stick.

405
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:46,091
Is she a friend or foe?

406
00:38:49,308 --> 00:38:50,625
I should go.

407
00:38:59,018 --> 00:39:00,057
I saw you yesterday.

408
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,054
You seemed to enjoy this rice ball.

409
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,893
So I asked the shop to make some.

410
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:06,610
You can eat them on your journey.

411
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:17,799
There sure is enough.

412
00:39:25,751 --> 00:39:27,109
I hope...

413
00:39:30,946 --> 00:39:32,304
As long as the rise balls are there.

414
00:39:33,264 --> 00:39:34,542
I there with you.

415
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,892
<i>Drifting along the stream.</i>

416
00:39:46,131 --> 00:39:48,088
<i>A hero yearns for drunken oblivion for one night.</i>

417
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:51,045
<i>But I fear we're not destined for each other.</i>

418
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:54,442
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow.</i>

419
00:40:21,056 --> 00:40:22,454
I won't say farewell.

420
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,478
Come and take a look.

421
00:40:53,824 --> 00:40:56,300
<i>Divine Tea Room</i>

422
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,077
Thank you sir.

423
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:02,953
You hired someone from the Ghost Valley.

424
00:42:03,673 --> 00:42:04,632
That is to say...

425
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:07,149
I am the person you hired.

426
00:42:08,428 --> 00:42:10,426
So why do you need all this hassle.

427
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:12,503
Prince Rui.

428
00:42:14,023 --> 00:42:15,941
Did your overlord tell you this?

429
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,617
At this juncture...

430
00:42:19,298 --> 00:42:21,655
There are not that many who can afford to hire from the Valley.

431
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,252
Meng and Lady Fleur in South Pagoda.

432
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:25,810
But in East Mulberry...

433
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:28,768
It must be Chai Sheng and Prince Rui.

434
00:42:29,328 --> 00:42:30,686
Many desire the treasure map.

435
00:42:31,286 --> 00:42:33,482
But the one who desire Zhao Chang's head.

436
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:36,520
Might only be Prince Rui.

437
00:42:40,316 --> 00:42:41,874
Then what I want...

438
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,432
is ready.

439
00:42:58,579 --> 00:42:59,856
I want to ask you a question.

440
00:43:00,297 --> 00:43:01,375
In Dragon Temple the other day...

441
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:03,533
The Warrior from the West who killed 5 of my Valley brothers.

442
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:05,011
Who sent him?

443
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,047
If I say I don't know.

444
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,045
Would you believe me?

445
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:14,922
If I say...

446
00:43:14,922 --> 00:43:16,759
This belongs to my family.

447
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,437
I won't give it to you.

448
00:43:19,038 --> 00:43:19,956
Would you believe me?

449
00:43:39,537 --> 00:43:40,696
Don't put the blame on me.

450
00:43:41,416 --> 00:43:43,732
We had to be prepared.

451
00:43:48,808 --> 00:43:50,925
I'm not affillated with her in any way.

452
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:00,316
Not affillated.

453
00:44:01,875 --> 00:44:03,272
On the count of three.

454
00:44:03,714 --> 00:44:05,511
If you don't surrender the treasure map.

455
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:07,509
I'd make some changes...

456
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,147
to her face.

457
00:44:10,946 --> 00:44:12,024
One...

458
00:44:17,419 --> 00:44:18,857
Two...

459
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:43,552
Didn't you say you're not affillated with me?

460
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:44,991
Don't move if you want to live.

461
00:45:17,919 --> 00:45:18,557
Who is he?

462
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,276
Black Judge.

463
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:21,035
Who?

464
00:45:21,356 --> 00:45:22,194
Black Judge.

465
00:45:35,422 --> 00:45:36,659
<i>Black Judge</i>

466
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:57,239
Qi Jun-yuan.

467
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,916
You can tell this Valley peasant...

468
00:45:59,997 --> 00:46:01,514
What I'm here to do?

469
00:46:01,556 --> 00:46:02,993
To enforce the family law.

470
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:06,269
I understand very well.

471
00:46:06,351 --> 00:46:08,268
When someone gathers strength.

472
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,945
They can't help but think about the future.

473
00:46:11,785 --> 00:46:13,423
I'm looking forward to the future.

474
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:16,020
But this treasure map...

475
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,017
is a piece of my past.

476
00:46:22,415 --> 00:46:25,051
You grew up under my watch in Valley.

477
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:28,767
I don;t take pleasure in destroying your Master's efforts.

478
00:46:29,767 --> 00:46:32,204
I am going to make an exception for you today.

479
00:46:32,764 --> 00:46:34,601
If you don't return with me to the Valley.

480
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,438
We will fight to the death.

481
00:46:39,637 --> 00:46:40,356
Then.

482
00:46:45,432 --> 00:46:46,429
You stay away.

483
00:46:58,259 --> 00:46:59,177
Black Judge.

484
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:01,734
I will use my Arm of Asura.

485
00:47:01,775 --> 00:47:04,851
To face off your Yin Yang Umbrella.

486
00:47:24,432 --> 00:47:25,550
Go and look into the street.

487
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:27,868
Why is it suddenly so quiet?

488
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:38,577
The people have fled.

489
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,492
Check from the windows for the east and west...

490
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:45,890
to see how many troops have they sent.

491
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:57,359
Not fewer than 300.

492
00:47:57,799 --> 00:47:59,277
I didn't expect Chai Kang...

493
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,315
to have such backups.

494
00:48:07,949 --> 00:48:09,866
Since it was Chai Kang who hired me from the Valley.

495
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:11,984
It shouldn't be him who mobilised the East Mulberry troops.

496
00:48:12,304 --> 00:48:14,262
Meng abd Lady Fleur are also aware of the treasure map.

497
00:48:14,302 --> 00:48:15,581
But they haven't made their wisnes know.

498
00:48:15,621 --> 00:48:17,818
I think they are the ones who've sent the troops.

499
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,125
After all...

500
00:48:31,406 --> 00:48:33,802
South Pagoda's iron cavalry is challenging the Valley.

501
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:36,799
We can't ever let them besmirch our name.

502
00:48:37,799 --> 00:48:38,917
What do you say?

503
00:48:48,868 --> 00:48:49,666
My lady...

504
00:48:51,186 --> 00:48:52,423
All is ready.

505
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,578
Take them alive.

506
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:55,201
This is the Ghost Valley.

507
00:52:00,276 --> 00:52:01,914
Black Judge is a force to be reckoned with.

508
00:56:04,591 --> 00:56:06,189
Please let me stay.

509
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:06,417
I'll block the way so that you can go.

510
00:57:09,046 --> 00:57:10,388
Go.

511
00:57:13,283 --> 00:57:14,521
I'm telling you to go.

512
00:57:14,761 --> 00:57:16,239
You won't make it if you don't go now.

513
00:57:55,081 --> 00:57:57,558
<i>I'm fine, don't worry about me.</i>

514
00:58:14,222 --> 00:58:15,260
My lord.

515
00:58:19,777 --> 00:58:21,054
General Zhao.

516
00:58:21,695 --> 00:58:24,850
I've found the mole in East Mulberry.

517
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:39,715
It's my brother

518
00:58:41,235 --> 00:58:43,872
THey hired someone from the Valley to assassinate you.

519
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:46,749
My lord.

520
00:58:47,388 --> 00:58:48,466
No, it can't be.

521
00:58:48,548 --> 00:58:50,305
It must be a misunderstanding.

522
00:58:50,745 --> 00:58:52,542
Prince Rui has alway been so kind to me.

523
00:58:53,343 --> 00:58:55,539
He gave me my promotion into the cabinet.

524
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:05,309
General Zhao.

525
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:08,587
I have it here all the correspondence...

526
01:00:09,427 --> 01:00:11,184
between the ministers in the cabinet.

527
01:00:12,743 --> 01:00:14,700
After they were copied.

528
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,818
I go through...

529
01:00:18,377 --> 01:00:20,375
each and every one of them.

530
01:00:21,575 --> 01:00:24,850
It includes the correspondence between my brother and the Valley.

531
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:30,604
Here...

532
01:00:30,806 --> 01:00:32,243
are all the letters from my brother...

533
01:00:32,683 --> 01:00:34,001
and yours.

534
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:49,386
For so many years...

535
01:00:50,265 --> 01:00:53,022
You've written to your wife without fail.

536
01:00:53,823 --> 01:00:55,899
A person who takes care of his family...

537
01:00:57,059 --> 01:00:58,497
is more reliable.

538
01:01:01,175 --> 01:01:02,492
All these years...

539
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,131
I've been playing a game of chess...

540
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:05,489
with Meng.

541
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,926
If I make my next move correctly.

542
01:01:08,927 --> 01:01:10,804
I'll come out the victor.

543
01:01:11,604 --> 01:01:12,322
Zhao Chuang.

544
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:15,080
You have to make this last move for me.

545
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,558
This is the most important move.

546
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:19,036
My lord.

547
01:01:19,477 --> 01:01:20,315
Don't worry.

548
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:23,672
I'll send my people to take care of your wife.

549
01:01:33,862 --> 01:01:35,739
What does your lordship...

550
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,857
want me to do?

551
01:02:04,951 --> 01:02:06,868
Unshackle him.

552
01:02:07,669 --> 01:02:09,426
They came to see me of their own will.

553
01:02:09,866 --> 01:02:11,543
That's why you could capture them.

554
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:15,276
- Leave us for now.
- Yes.

555
01:02:32,963 --> 01:02:35,999
What a handsome pair of assassins the Valley has delivered.

556
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:44,830
When I look at you.

557
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:47,627
I see my younger self.

558
01:02:50,425 --> 01:02:51,583
I'm nothing like you.

559
01:02:52,504 --> 01:02:54,061
I've been an orphan since I was young.

560
01:03:16,999 --> 01:03:18,796
Qi Jun-yuan, have you ever thought.

561
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,673
While the Ghost Valley has a considerable reputation.

562
01:03:22,034 --> 01:03:24,391
Assassinations can only change the situation now.

563
01:03:25,191 --> 01:03:27,268
Buts can't change people's fate.

564
01:03:32,264 --> 01:03:35,835
- So you chose to be a Buddhist.
- Yes.

565
01:03:36,739 --> 01:03:38,664
Because I made a mistake.

566
01:03:46,050 --> 01:03:47,807
For the sake of may future.

567
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:50,005
I sacritice my past.

568
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,598
So I pray every day...

569
01:03:58,237 --> 01:04:00,115
to ask for guidance to amend.

570
01:04:00,955 --> 01:04:02,872
Did you get any answers?

571
01:04:10,905 --> 01:04:11,863
Yes, I did.

572
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:18,457
I was enlightened with a phrase.

573
01:04:20,295 --> 01:04:21,373
Revenge.

574
01:04:26,889 --> 01:04:29,725
So now I dare not to ask for anything.

575
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:32,762
I just hope my man and my child would be protected.

576
01:04:39,236 --> 01:04:40,235
Lady Fleur.

577
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:42,952
Do you know why I came to see you?

578
01:04:43,632 --> 01:04:45,789
It's because you have something to ask me.

579
01:04:48,907 --> 01:04:51,463
Now the treasure map has been returned to me.

580
01:04:52,343 --> 01:04:54,340
I'll hire you to do something for me.

581
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,097
Returned to you.

582
01:04:57,978 --> 01:04:58,936
Of course.

583
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:01,374
If I didn't arrange for it to be kept by Governor Gu.

584
01:05:01,454 --> 01:05:04,139
How could a man of mediocrity like him
get his hands on the map.

585
01:05:07,009 --> 01:05:08,726
What do you want to hire me to do?

586
01:05:09,766 --> 01:05:12,187
When I hire an assassin, it's of course to assassinate.

587
01:05:13,483 --> 01:05:15,599
I used the treasure map as bait...

588
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,277
to arrange a meeting with Chai Sheng in the Snow Pavilion.

589
01:05:18,398 --> 01:05:21,833
Ostensibly to discuss with him how to find the treasures.

590
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:24,310
When the time comes...

591
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,148
I want you to assassinate Chai Sheng.

592
01:05:30,345 --> 01:05:32,543
Why would I do such a thing for you?

593
01:05:33,982 --> 01:05:35,379
Because I can tell you...

594
01:05:35,421 --> 01:05:37,098
what you want to know.

595
01:05:37,738 --> 01:05:39,335
What do I want to know?

596
01:05:48,927 --> 01:05:50,525
The treasure map.

597
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:53,361
And the truth about the annihilation of your clan.

598
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,309
I, Chai Sheng of East Mulberry...

599
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,747
will form a brotherly alliance with...

600
01:06:07,947 --> 01:06:09,745
The Lord of South Pagoda.

601
01:06:10,105 --> 01:06:12,862
We will join hands to find the ancient treasures.

602
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,060
If I desire otherwise.

603
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,138
The wrath of the heavens and men will be upon me.

604
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:20,255
Heaven and earth will destroy me.

605
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:22,972
I, Meng Xu of South Pagoda...

606
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:26,009
with form a brotherly alliance with...

607
01:06:26,289 --> 01:06:27,647
Lord Chai Sheng of East Mulberry.

608
01:06:28,087 --> 01:06:29,246
If I desire otherwise.

609
01:06:29,606 --> 01:06:31,963
I will die by sword.

610
01:06:50,346 --> 01:06:50,944
In a moment.

611
01:06:51,425 --> 01:06:52,901
I'll call for you. When you tell me to leave, I'll leave.

612
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:54,260
When I tell you to grab it, you grab.

613
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:56,618
Today...

614
01:06:56,619 --> 01:06:59,495
We are brothers and allies.

615
01:06:59,576 --> 01:07:01,892
I'd like to invite your wife for a song...

616
01:07:02,133 --> 01:07:04,371
to celebrate this momentous day.

617
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:12,482
When the time comes, I'll sing a song.

618
01:07:12,723 --> 01:07:15,120
When the opportinity comes for you to assassinate Chai Sheng.

619
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:16,877
I'll give you a signal.

620
01:07:20,595 --> 01:07:23,152
<i>If the love is true.</i>

621
01:07:23,193 --> 01:07:26,988
<i>We wouldn't lament we've met too late.</i>

622
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:32,183
<i>I just hope to see you, with no regrets.</i>

623
01:07:32,503 --> 01:07:36,019
<i>Love and honour are fading like a tide...</i>

624
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:39,256
<i>and more colourful than wilted howers.</i>

625
01:07:39,536 --> 01:07:43,691
<i>But I fear loneliness and dashed hopes.</i>

626
01:07:44,131 --> 01:07:46,688
<i>Love is like a dream.</i>

627
01:07:47,128 --> 01:07:49,565
<i>It doesn't matter if it didn't last.</i>

628
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:52,802
<i>If our hearts are strong.</i>

629
01:07:52,883 --> 01:07:55,559
<i>Love will never fade.</i>

630
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:58,476
<i>Parting brings destruction.</i>

631
01:07:58,757 --> 01:08:01,593
<i>I yearn for us to meet again.</i>

632
01:08:01,714 --> 01:08:04,829
<i>Love is in my heart.</i>

633
01:08:05,151 --> 01:08:07,667
<i>It won't go away.</i>

634
01:08:07,988 --> 01:08:10,185
<i>If the love is true.</i>

635
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:14,580
<i>We wouldn't lament we've met too late.</i>

636
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:18,057
<i>I just hope to see you, with no regrets.</i>

637
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:19,975
What does my lord want me to do...

638
01:08:20,495 --> 01:08:22,212
and now to do it.

639
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:25,290
Assassinate Meng Xu.

640
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:43,951
General Zhao.

641
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:47,587
I'll deliver this chalice to the lord.

642
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,222
I think I've seen you somewhere before?

643
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,616
Your memory deceives you.

644
01:08:59,376 --> 01:09:01,093
We've never met.

645
01:09:13,123 --> 01:09:17,677
Capture the assassin.

646
01:09:18,077 --> 01:09:19,116
Someone is trying to kill his lordship.

647
01:09:19,156 --> 01:09:20,833
Protect the lord.

648
01:09:21,035 --> 01:09:22,472
Catch the assassin.

649
01:09:22,513 --> 01:09:23,950
Protect his lordship.

650
01:09:56,599 --> 01:09:58,396
Where did these skillful assassins come from?

651
01:10:13,622 --> 01:10:14,420
Help.

652
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:20,974
My lord, it's dangerous.

653
01:11:09,326 --> 01:11:10,204
Master.

654
01:11:11,764 --> 01:11:13,401
It's the person you brought.

655
01:11:21,714 --> 01:11:22,712
Lord Meng.

656
01:11:28,986 --> 01:11:29,984
Lord Meng.

657
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:35,779
Don't worry.

658
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:38,216
It's over now.

659
01:11:38,777 --> 01:11:40,294
It's finally over.

660
01:12:27,288 --> 01:12:28,006
My lord.

661
01:12:28,566 --> 01:12:29,405
My lord.

662
01:13:17,597 --> 01:13:18,436
Who is it?

663
01:13:40,135 --> 01:13:41,812
Lady Fleur, you come to me so late at night.

664
01:13:42,373 --> 01:13:43,651
What instructions do you have for me?

665
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:45,489
Don't worry.

666
01:13:46,369 --> 01:13:47,487
There's no one outside.

667
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:00,394
You shouldn't have come to see me at this time.

668
01:14:00,555 --> 01:14:02,992
If someone sees you, our plan will be ruined.

669
01:14:32,243 --> 01:14:33,720
It's been decades.

670
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:36,837
I've thought about you everyday.

671
01:14:46,548 --> 01:14:48,186
I know you blame me.

672
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:52,142
I've promised you not to kill Meng Xu.

673
01:14:53,342 --> 01:14:55,099
But the situation has changed.

674
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:56,658
I has to do it.

675
01:14:58,497 --> 01:14:59,734
Don't worry.

676
01:15:00,055 --> 01:15:01,693
The situation will be resolved very soon.

677
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:04,090
Before long we'll be together again.

678
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:05,968
See?

679
01:15:06,609 --> 01:15:08,046
You're the mastermind.

680
01:15:08,447 --> 01:15:10,244
You asked me to make that copper map...

681
01:15:10,285 --> 01:15:12,082
of a treasure that didn't exist.

682
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:13,681
So that so many people...

683
01:15:14,081 --> 01:15:15,079
have plotted around us...

684
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,718
for so many years.

685
01:15:19,236 --> 01:15:20,314
But...

686
01:15:21,354 --> 01:15:23,470
Whatever the outcome.

687
01:15:24,151 --> 01:15:26,548
It doesn't make up for what we've lost.

688
01:15:36,219 --> 01:15:38,575
Do you still miss our doughter?

689
01:15:44,371 --> 01:15:46,288
How can I not miss her.

690
01:15:49,926 --> 01:15:50,644
I know.

691
01:15:51,643 --> 01:15:53,161
To make Meng Xu take you under his wing.

692
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,758
I forced you to abandon her.

693
01:16:03,712 --> 01:16:04,869
Ghost Valley...

694
01:16:05,989 --> 01:16:07,427
has tried to assassinate you.

695
01:16:08,467 --> 01:16:10,424
But why is it following your orders?

696
01:16:29,486 --> 01:16:30,404
Do you remember...

697
01:16:31,404 --> 01:16:32,362
13 years ago..

698
01:16:32,402 --> 01:16:34,679
What we want to take refuge separately.

699
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,837
The question you asked me then?

700
01:16:38,437 --> 01:16:41,952
If in future, you can only choose between me and the realm.

701
01:16:41,953 --> 01:16:43,231
How would you choose?

702
01:16:43,352 --> 01:16:44,389
Of course I'd choose you.

703
01:16:45,349 --> 01:16:46,508
I said I'd choose you.

704
01:16:47,108 --> 01:16:48,226
What are you talking about?

705
01:16:52,422 --> 01:16:53,221
I said...

706
01:16:53,422 --> 01:16:54,660
I'm pleased.

707
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:10,844
You asked why is Valley or No Malice following my order.

708
01:17:12,003 --> 01:17:13,640
It's because Lord Chai Sheng...

709
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:18,156
is holding the decree of their real plan.

710
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:44,530
I'm waiting for you here.

711
01:17:46,209 --> 01:17:47,886
Would you believe me?

712
01:17:55,959 --> 01:17:57,477
We meet again.

713
01:17:58,117 --> 01:17:59,954
I'm grateful to you for accepting my invitation.

714
01:18:00,355 --> 01:18:02,232
If I didn't want you to come here.

715
01:18:02,592 --> 01:18:05,149
Why would I lie to your men?

716
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:06,667
Your lordship.

717
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:09,264
The decree about the Ghost Valley is here.

718
01:18:11,983 --> 01:18:13,061
That's wonderful.

719
01:18:14,141 --> 01:18:15,738
I'd have found you soon anyway.

720
01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:18,255
General Zhao.

721
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:20,653
I want to know...

722
01:18:22,332 --> 01:18:25,289
Was it you who hired the Valley to assassinate Meng Xu?

723
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,735
<i>I've commissioned Ghost Valley.</i>

724
01:18:31,683 --> 01:18:33,681
What is your link to the Valley?

725
01:18:36,199 --> 01:18:36,837
Your lordship.

726
01:18:37,557 --> 01:18:38,236
Your servant...

727
01:18:39,196 --> 01:18:40,634
would like to borrow your pen.

728
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:04,610
Do you know why...

729
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:07,175
I was always writing to my wife?

730
01:19:07,767 --> 01:19:09,165
Because I knew very well...

731
01:19:09,685 --> 01:19:11,482
You would spy on the letters.

732
01:19:12,403 --> 01:19:13,400
That is why...

733
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:16,038
I wrote whatever you wanted to read.

734
01:19:17,678 --> 01:19:18,555
The other day...

735
01:19:19,236 --> 01:19:21,049
When you said you'd send men...

736
01:19:21,121 --> 01:19:22,408
to look after my wife.

737
01:19:22,593 --> 01:19:24,549
I wasn't afraid at all.

738
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:26,308
Because the wife I wrote to...

739
01:19:28,027 --> 01:19:29,584
doesn't exist.

740
01:19:37,218 --> 01:19:39,174
He acted as a loyal minister and a gentleman.

741
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:41,772
For so many years, it must have been hard.

742
01:19:46,808 --> 01:19:48,165
Do you know why...

743
01:19:48,406 --> 01:19:50,524
You're still alive?

744
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:53,480
It's because I need you to take the blame for me.

745
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:55,159
Assassin!

746
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:56,518
Someone is killing my lord.

747
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:57,357
Assassin!

748
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:57,836
Hurry.

749
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:58,755
Hurry up.

750
01:19:58,836 --> 01:19:59,515
Someone is trying to kill his lordship.

751
01:19:59,516 --> 01:20:00,474
Master.

752
01:20:08,347 --> 01:20:09,984
Someone wants us to destroy each other.

753
01:20:10,624 --> 01:20:12,541
Meets me at the Red Chamber Theatre

754
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,257
<i>Red Chamber Theatre</i>

755
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:39,794
Jun-yuan.

756
01:22:05,469 --> 01:22:06,507
Commander.

757
01:22:07,428 --> 01:22:10,383
I said I'd do some good in these turbulent times.

758
01:22:10,943 --> 01:22:11,982
Believe me.

759
01:22:12,742 --> 01:22:14,059
I'm very close to success.

760
01:22:16,898 --> 01:22:17,896
Commander.

761
01:22:18,536 --> 01:22:20,374
I appreciate your contribution over the years...

762
01:22:20,414 --> 01:22:22,491
to the Valley.

763
01:22:23,252 --> 01:22:24,729
The sacrifice you make today...

764
01:22:25,769 --> 01:22:27,167
is worthwhile.

765
01:22:30,244 --> 01:22:31,762
I'm old.

766
01:22:33,121 --> 01:22:35,038
It's time for me to go.

767
01:22:37,038 --> 01:22:38,675
In exchange for the efforts.

768
01:22:39,954 --> 01:22:42,911
I've made for the Valley for decades.

769
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,189
Golden Mask.

770
01:22:45,549 --> 01:22:46,827
I beg you...

771
01:22:48,187 --> 01:22:50,464
Allow me the last dignity...

772
01:22:51,903 --> 01:22:53,341
as an assassin.

773
01:23:04,889 --> 01:23:05,808
Commander.

774
01:23:06,888 --> 01:23:07,726
I'd say...

775
01:23:08,686 --> 01:23:10,004
farawell.

776
01:23:30,025 --> 01:23:30,743
Master.

777
01:23:32,063 --> 01:23:33,101
Master.

778
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:34,779
Master.

779
01:23:42,412 --> 01:23:44,050
It's Golden Mask.

780
01:23:48,766 --> 01:23:53,401
He has Zhao's prayer beads on him.

781
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,537
It's because I can tell you...

782
01:24:16,578 --> 01:24:17,616
the truth about the map...

783
01:24:17,657 --> 01:24:19,854
and the annihillation of your Qi clan.

784
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:27,366
I've been trying to find the truth about the death of the Qi clan.

785
01:24:27,687 --> 01:24:29,085
But at this moment...

786
01:24:29,205 --> 01:24:30,643
For revenge and for my own future.

787
01:24:31,044 --> 01:24:32,601
As the Blue Asura of Ghost Valley.

788
01:24:32,642 --> 01:24:35,894
All the more reason for me to solve this plot.

789
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:36,836
Golden Mask.

790
01:24:37,398 --> 01:24:39,914
Master taught us to kill with the machete.

791
01:24:40,395 --> 01:24:41,752
What kind of weapon do you use?

792
01:24:42,672 --> 01:24:44,589
I don't use a weapon.

793
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:46,507
I use...

794
01:24:47,108 --> 01:24:48,225
A plot.

795
01:24:49,105 --> 01:24:49,744
A plot...

796
01:24:50,264 --> 01:24:52,382
can change an entire era.

797
01:24:53,381 --> 01:24:55,418
Can the plot be unraveled?

798
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:57,768
If you want to solve this plot.

799
01:24:57,816 --> 01:24:59,206
You'd have to come up with...

800
01:24:59,415 --> 01:25:00,805
another plot.

801
01:25:13,521 --> 01:25:14,399
I announce...

802
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,036
General Zhao to receive the Commander's Seal.

803
01:25:18,636 --> 01:25:19,434
I announce...

804
01:25:19,435 --> 01:25:23,110
General Zhao enters the palace...

805
01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:27,267
I congratlate your ladyship for becoming the ruler
of South Pagoda.

806
01:25:27,387 --> 01:25:28,625
Wait untill I receive the Commander's Seal.

807
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,142
East Mulberry will be ours too.

808
01:25:31,503 --> 01:25:32,701
I urge your ladyship to come...

809
01:25:33,262 --> 01:25:36,177
and withness our dream becoming realty.

810
01:26:01,233 --> 01:26:02,111
My lord.

811
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:03,590
My lord.

812
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,387
I've said...

813
01:26:08,785 --> 01:26:10,184
I like...

814
01:26:11,383 --> 01:26:14,659
watching you embroider thr royal robe.

815
01:26:15,939 --> 01:26:16,737
Even thoughn...

816
01:26:16,778 --> 01:26:18,096
I know...

817
01:26:20,334 --> 01:26:22,531
The robe wasn't for me.

818
01:26:47,707 --> 01:26:48,944
Your servant, Zhao Chuang.

819
01:26:49,385 --> 01:26:51,862
Pledge allegiance to the young master.

820
01:26:57,377 --> 01:26:58,215
Wait.

821
01:27:01,093 --> 01:27:02,371
General Zhao.

822
01:27:03,771 --> 01:27:04,689
South Pagoda and East Mulberry...

823
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:06,686
have form an alliance.

824
01:27:08,486 --> 01:27:10,523
I have to remind you...

825
01:27:11,123 --> 01:27:12,561
to behalf of the two lords.

826
01:27:13,122 --> 01:27:15,198
I hope when you receive the Commander's Seal.

827
01:27:15,599 --> 01:27:18,475
You won't forget your pledge to protect the young master.

828
01:27:19,035 --> 01:27:19,954
I, Zhao Chuang...

829
01:27:20,474 --> 01:27:22,831
have never broken a promise in my life.

830
01:27:32,902 --> 01:27:35,298
Have you never broken a promise?

831
01:27:52,282 --> 01:27:54,439
Do you dare to swear to Buddha?

832
01:28:08,905 --> 01:28:11,622
I swear to Buddha...

833
01:28:11,983 --> 01:28:13,979
I will always and forever be loyal to the young master...

834
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,778
and to protect East Mulberry.

835
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:17,296
If I betray this vow...

836
01:28:17,577 --> 01:28:18,935
I'm willing to be punisned.

837
01:28:18,975 --> 01:28:20,733
To be banisned to hell everatter.

838
01:28:41,433 --> 01:28:42,151
Report to...

839
01:28:42,591 --> 01:28:43,190
General Zhao.

840
01:28:43,231 --> 01:28:44,389
There is a cover invasion from assassins.

841
01:28:44,430 --> 01:28:45,947
What? Assassins!

842
01:28:47,587 --> 01:28:48,704
There are assassins here.

843
01:28:49,385 --> 01:28:51,142
Protect his lordship.

844
01:28:52,222 --> 01:28:53,060
Close the gate.

845
01:29:08,406 --> 01:29:08,925
General.

846
01:29:08,965 --> 01:29:10,922
An unknown enemy has set off...

847
01:29:10,964 --> 01:29:12,625
all the explosives in our arsenal.

848
01:29:13,601 --> 01:29:15,878
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

849
01:29:15,918 --> 01:29:17,484
Who is shouting.

850
01:29:19,595 --> 01:29:20,633
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

851
01:29:20,674 --> 01:29:21,153
It can't be.

852
01:29:21,233 --> 01:29:21,992
How can it be?

853
01:29:22,392 --> 01:29:23,190
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

854
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:25,428
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

855
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:27,545
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

856
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:29,424
It must be Qi Jun-yuan.

857
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:31,022
Deploy my Forbidden Army.

858
01:29:31,263 --> 01:29:31,782
Yes, sir.

859
01:29:32,581 --> 01:29:33,620
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

860
01:29:34,499 --> 01:29:35,538
Zhao Chuang staged a mutiny.

861
01:29:42,132 --> 01:29:42,851
Zhao Chuang.

862
01:29:42,891 --> 01:29:43,930
How dare you bring a sword into the palace.

863
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:45,009
Protect the young lord.

864
01:29:45,049 --> 01:29:45,808
It's really him.

865
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:54,079
Protect the royal heir and read him to safety.

866
01:30:38,236 --> 01:30:39,754
Wait untill I receive the Commander's Seal.

867
01:30:40,194 --> 01:30:42,990
I will deploy the troops to destroy the Ghost Valley.

868
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:48,105
Ask Qi Jun-yuan to come out.

869
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:57,855
Die!

870
01:30:57,856 --> 01:30:58,894
Die!

871
01:31:22,072 --> 01:31:23,350
Traitor.

872
01:31:46,487 --> 01:31:49,084
I knew you'd harm the young master.

873
01:31:50,124 --> 01:31:52,361
My hand was forced by the Ghost Valley.

874
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,438
You've said...

875
01:31:57,437 --> 01:31:59,833
You'd choose me, between the realm and me.

876
01:32:00,834 --> 01:32:02,670
Now I ask you to leave with me.

877
01:32:03,111 --> 01:32:04,549
Would you do it?

878
01:32:04,589 --> 01:32:05,667
I can't.

879
01:32:07,387 --> 01:32:08,664
I promised...

880
01:32:08,746 --> 01:32:10,702
to help you calm the chaos.

881
01:32:12,582 --> 01:32:15,538
But now our plan has lost its meaning.

882
01:32:16,178 --> 01:32:18,135
Because you've changed.

883
01:32:21,852 --> 01:32:22,459
Yes.

884
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,929
But the change in me...

885
01:32:25,249 --> 01:32:26,967
was made to accommodate the time.

886
01:32:28,086 --> 01:32:29,284
Indeed.

887
01:32:30,444 --> 01:32:31,921
We've both changed.

888
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:36,716
I've lost my past.

889
01:32:40,154 --> 01:32:42,271
I can't see a future for us.

890
01:32:44,629 --> 01:32:46,867
I can't face myself.

891
01:32:48,865 --> 01:32:50,823
But I can start afresn.

892
01:33:17,157 --> 01:33:17,875
Fleur.

893
01:33:19,435 --> 01:33:20,352
Fleur.

894
01:33:23,071 --> 01:33:23,989
You... is this...

895
01:33:24,110 --> 01:33:26,667
Is this your new beginning?

896
01:33:29,185 --> 01:33:32,021
You've left me all by myselt.

897
01:33:36,858 --> 01:33:39,254
I will definitely...

898
01:33:39,455 --> 01:33:40,852
complete...

899
01:33:41,053 --> 01:33:43,649
complete our plan.

900
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:47,486
You see?

901
01:33:47,527 --> 01:33:49,164
The Commander's Seal is in the box.

902
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:50,722
I'll show you.

903
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:26,806
You didn't foresee you'd be trapped.

904
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,473
Perhaps you forgot.

905
01:34:40,593 --> 01:34:43,350
It was you who taught me to plot.

906
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:45,788
Golden Mask.

907
01:34:47,666 --> 01:34:49,663
I've actually never understood.

908
01:34:50,903 --> 01:34:52,540
What is the relationship between...

909
01:34:52,742 --> 01:34:54,419
Golden Mask and Zhao Chuang.

910
01:34:55,059 --> 01:34:56,457
In fact it's very simple.

911
01:34:58,016 --> 01:35:00,373
You are the same person.

912
01:35:01,253 --> 01:35:03,809
For so long you pretended to be a loyal minister.

913
01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,008
It couldn't be easy.

914
01:35:05,768 --> 01:35:07,166
If you're Golden Mask.

915
01:35:08,845 --> 01:35:10,163
Then Lady Fleur...

916
01:35:10,324 --> 01:35:11,921
must be the Queen of Fire who has been...

917
01:35:11,922 --> 01:35:13,519
missing from the Valley for years.

918
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:15,158
You asked my family, the Qi...

919
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:17,235
to make a copper map...

920
01:35:17,277 --> 01:35:18,554
for treasures that didn't exist.

921
01:35:19,235 --> 01:35:21,551
So as to start a war between South Pagoda and East Mulberry.

922
01:35:21,792 --> 01:35:24,188
You surrendered to Chai Sheng amid the chaos.

923
01:35:24,469 --> 01:35:25,907
And Lady Fleur...

924
01:35:25,988 --> 01:35:27,665
attached herself to Meng Xu.

925
01:35:28,226 --> 01:35:31,821
You arranged for the Valley brothers to assassinate yourself.

926
01:35:31,942 --> 01:35:33,380
So that you can stage...

927
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:35,258
a scene of a loyal minister being assassinated...

928
01:35:35,338 --> 01:35:37,216
to win Chai Sheng's trust.

929
01:35:38,376 --> 01:35:39,614
You knew very well.

930
01:35:39,814 --> 01:35:42,211
I wouldn't give up avenging my clan.

931
01:35:42,492 --> 01:35:45,831
So you put the blame of taking the map and treachery on me.

932
01:35:45,888 --> 01:35:47,086
So that the entire Valley...

933
01:35:47,127 --> 01:35:49,603
would focus on me, the traitor.

934
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,121
Then you used the map as bait...

935
01:35:52,801 --> 01:35:55,078
to lure the South Pagoda and East Mulberry leaders to meet.

936
01:35:55,439 --> 01:35:56,316
And assassinated them both...

937
01:35:56,797 --> 01:35:58,275
at the meeting.

938
01:35:58,635 --> 01:35:59,993
When you received the Commander's Seal.

939
01:36:00,114 --> 01:36:01,351
You led the East Mulberry army...

940
01:36:01,393 --> 01:36:03,110
to destroy the Ghost Valley.

941
01:36:04,670 --> 01:36:05,427
In that way...

942
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,505
You could cover up your treachery.

943
01:36:07,547 --> 01:36:09,143
You could advance your position...

944
01:36:09,225 --> 01:36:10,383
from the overlord of the Valley...

945
01:36:11,023 --> 01:36:12,701
into the overlord of the entire realm.

946
01:36:13,381 --> 01:36:14,259
Golden Mask.

947
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:17,975
Now I ask on behalf of my brothers in the Valley.

948
01:36:18,855 --> 01:36:20,733
How can you face us?

949
01:36:22,611 --> 01:36:23,889
Times have changed.

950
01:36:24,929 --> 01:36:28,365
I can't say I didn't try to change the world through the Valley.

951
01:36:28,885 --> 01:36:30,563
You can't change anything.

952
01:36:32,841 --> 01:36:34,718
Because you've changed.

953
01:36:36,517 --> 01:36:38,914
I'm Qi Jun-yuan with a mask on.

954
01:36:40,354 --> 01:36:42,391
Qi Jun-yuan with my mask off.

955
01:36:42,991 --> 01:36:44,709
Today I don't care whether you're Zhao Chuang...

956
01:36:44,749 --> 01:36:45,987
or Golden Mask.

957
01:36:46,268 --> 01:36:48,624
I will avenge my master and the Valley.

958
01:37:08,605 --> 01:37:09,843
Blue Asura.

959
01:37:10,084 --> 01:37:11,841
It's time to enforce the family law.

960
01:37:15,798 --> 01:37:17,355
I'm the one...

961
01:37:18,236 --> 01:37:19,153
to enforce family law.

962
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:34,119
Your Arm of Asura.

963
01:40:35,318 --> 01:40:36,676
It's time for me to take it back.

964
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:35,697
I didn't try to assassinate.

965
01:41:36,138 --> 01:41:37,135
What I used was...

966
01:41:37,696 --> 01:41:38,415
a plot.

967
01:41:39,614 --> 01:41:40,172
A plot...

968
01:41:40,933 --> 01:41:43,210
can change an entire era.

969
01:41:48,764 --> 01:41:50,202
I've promised myself.

970
01:41:50,683 --> 01:41:53,096
I'd leave the Valley as soon as I've made my revenge.

971
01:41:53,161 --> 01:41:54,958
To find my future.

972
01:41:56,357 --> 01:41:57,195
Ay this moment...

973
01:41:57,796 --> 01:41:59,873
I recall the snowy day...

974
01:42:00,992 --> 01:42:02,870
and what Qin said.

975
01:42:07,906 --> 01:42:09,663
When will this blizzard end?

976
01:42:24,569 --> 01:42:27,285
I don't understand why you brought me to the Valley.

977
01:42:27,686 --> 01:42:29,043
I've made my plans.

978
01:42:29,484 --> 01:42:30,882
Where do we go after we've left?

979
01:42:31,322 --> 01:42:32,920
You'd like it.

980
01:42:40,513 --> 01:42:41,911
Golden Mask and Crimson Mask...

981
01:42:41,952 --> 01:42:43,389
told me here...

982
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:44,828
Ghost Valley...

983
01:42:45,148 --> 01:42:47,106
will one day make the world...

984
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:48,904
a place without hatred.

985
01:42:58,136 --> 01:42:59,693
They are all lies.

986
01:43:00,893 --> 01:43:03,290
That's why they never took off their masks.

987
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:07,685
Let's go.

988
01:43:07,966 --> 01:43:08,884
Shengsheng.

989
01:43:10,043 --> 01:43:11,601
I remember my master had said...

990
01:43:12,601 --> 01:43:14,518
Crimson Mask gave away their child...

991
01:43:15,438 --> 01:43:17,995
for the sake of Golden Mask's undertaking.

992
01:44:02,231 --> 01:44:04,468
Shengsheng, I have to tell you.

993
01:44:04,948 --> 01:44:07,186
I made up that rumour.

994
01:44:12,141 --> 01:44:13,180
I've been thinking...

995
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:15,657
Why did we meet at the Dragon Temple.

996
01:44:19,933 --> 01:44:21,131
And your fortune stick.

997
01:44:21,213 --> 01:44:22,450
Drifting along the stream.

998
01:44:22,531 --> 01:44:24,856
Finally meeting a hero for one night's drink into oblivion.

999
01:44:24,968 --> 01:44:26,406
Why was the fortune so accurate.

1000
01:44:27,207 --> 01:44:28,963
I went to search for it at the Temple.

1001
01:44:31,442 --> 01:44:32,720
Did you find it?

1002
01:44:34,958 --> 01:44:35,797
How could I?

1003
01:44:35,838 --> 01:44:37,555
It didn't even exist.

1004
01:44:39,794 --> 01:44:40,791
Also.

1005
01:44:41,113 --> 01:44:43,069
When you pretended to be Lady Fleur.

1006
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:45,147
How did you know...

1007
01:44:45,228 --> 01:44:46,626
their child...

1008
01:44:46,707 --> 01:44:47,864
is a girl.

1009
01:44:48,545 --> 01:44:51,221
So now I dare not ask for anything.

1010
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:54,418
I just hope mu man and may child would be protected.

1011
01:44:55,338 --> 01:44:57,895
Do you still miss our daughter?

1012
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:03,808
I deduced...

1013
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:05,647
that you are the daughter of Golden Mask and Crimson Mask.

1014
01:45:06,327 --> 01:45:07,485
You followed me...

1015
01:45:09,045 --> 01:45:10,082
because you wanted to see...

1016
01:45:10,124 --> 01:45:11,561
how they've turned out?

1017
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,878
That's right

1018
01:45:15,518 --> 01:45:17,196
I've always known...

1019
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:20,032
they're Zhao Chuang and Lady Fleur.

1020
01:45:21,712 --> 01:45:23,029
So outside Dragon Temple...

1021
01:45:23,190 --> 01:45:24,548
I saved you with the music.

1022
01:45:25,109 --> 01:45:27,305
So that you'd continue to help me.

1023
01:45:28,025 --> 01:45:29,663
Tha's also why I reminded you to think about...

1024
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:31,821
the relationship between Zhao Chuang and Golden Mask.

1025
01:45:32,141 --> 01:45:33,539
Ghost Valley...

1026
01:45:34,379 --> 01:45:35,897
tried to assassinate you.

1027
01:45:36,497 --> 01:45:38,534
But why are they following your orders?

1028
01:45:40,972 --> 01:45:41,851
I think...

1029
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:44,248
You must have guessed.

1030
01:45:44,729 --> 01:45:47,381
I let Chai Kang capture me on purpose to return to you.

1031
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:54,637
Of course I knew.

1032
01:45:55,158 --> 01:45:56,396
I also knew.

1033
01:45:56,916 --> 01:45:58,873
You were captured by South Pagoda on purpose.

1034
01:46:01,552 --> 01:46:02,110
It didn't occur to me.

1035
01:46:02,151 --> 01:46:04,148
Apart from Golden Mask and Crimson Mask.

1036
01:46:04,229 --> 01:46:05,347
I'd have to face...

1037
01:46:05,508 --> 01:46:07,066
a trap set by you.

1038
01:46:07,865 --> 01:46:08,864
Shengsheng.

1039
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,978
Is this the ending you envisioned?

1040
01:46:59,334 --> 01:47:00,332
Shengsheng.

1041
01:47:01,013 --> 01:47:03,729
All plots have a cost.

1042
01:47:08,645 --> 01:47:10,602
Would you like to see me in future?

1043
01:47:18,834 --> 01:47:19,872
I'm sure.

1044
01:47:21,312 --> 01:47:23,749
I'll think of you everytime I have rice balls.

1045
01:47:27,506 --> 01:47:29,783
Can't we star afresn?

1046
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:33,427
I have to stay and rebuild Ghost Valley.

1047
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:34,578
The principe of the Valley.

1048
01:47:34,778 --> 01:47:35,537
Is to make the world...

1049
01:47:35,658 --> 01:47:36,815
turn away from the sorrows of parting and hatred...

1050
01:47:36,936 --> 01:47:38,573
to be without malice.

1051
01:47:38,734 --> 01:47:40,491
The Valley's belief is magnificent.

1052
01:47:40,933 --> 01:47:41,690
As long as the Valley exists.

1053
01:47:42,091 --> 01:47:42,850
There's hope...

1054
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:44,408
for this world.

1055
01:47:45,927 --> 01:47:47,245
If you stay in the Valley.

1056
01:47:49,164 --> 01:47:52,120
Wouldn't you become another Golden Mask?

1057
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:55,589
As long as I hold fast to my beliefs...

1058
01:47:55,597 --> 01:47:56,828
to have my intention remain unchanged...

1059
01:47:56,836 --> 01:47:59,473
to destroy any enermies to unravel any plots.

1060
01:48:00,752 --> 01:48:03,373
I am Qi Jun-yuan when I take on my mask.

1061
01:48:03,909 --> 01:48:06,154
When I put on my mask. I'm still...

1062
01:48:06,227 --> 01:48:07,385
Qi Jun-yuan.
