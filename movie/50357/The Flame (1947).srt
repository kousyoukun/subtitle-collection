I... Let's see.

347
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,734
Oh, here it is.

348
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,041

Never heard those
words before, huh?

356
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:08,322
No.

00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,374
You, Mr. MacAllister.

360
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:20,508
Oh, well.

361
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:25,948
I memorized them.
Thought they were so nice.

362
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:28,559
Whatever happened
to her, George?

363
00:27:28,603 --> 00:27:32,563
I don't know. I guess
she must be kicking
around Paris some place.

364
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:34,174
It's too bad you lost
track of her.

365
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:36,524
What was her name now?

366
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,134
Uh...

367
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:39,440
I don't know.
I don't remember.

368
00:27:40,354 --> 00:27:42,225
Why didn't you marry her?

369
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,662
And what did you do
with the money
that I sent you

370
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,012
for that particular purpose?

371
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:50,407
I... got rolled over
by a roulette wheel
on the way to church.

372
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,366
It's too bad
you didn't marry her.

373
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,498
Would have been good for you.

374
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,544
You know, it still might be.

00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,416
I'm in a magnanimous mood,

You find her

any business you name.

want to leave France

I'll put you in charge of
our organization over there.

Well, what do you say?

380
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,557
I'll think about it.

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,080
Good. Good.

00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:14,867
Oh, by the way,

make out a check.

I certainly can use it.

That's what I figured.

388
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,837
If getting married
puts you in
this kind of mood,

389
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,273
we should do it more often.

I hope you'll take my advice.

About what?

Find that girl and marry her.

00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,499
Yeah.

remember her name.

You got any?

00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,444
Yeah. Helen, I take it,

Yeah.

You ain't kidding.

491
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:05,799
She likes anything
that costs a lot of dough,

492
00:35:05,842 --> 00:35:07,061
if you know what I mean.

493
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:13,328
When I got it,
she even likes me.

494
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:14,634
That ain't often.

495
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:21,510
I don't know
what kind of trouble

496
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:22,990
you're having with
that dame of yours,

497
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,905
but she ain't two-timing you.

498
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:26,863
What makes you so sure?

499
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,301
Her face.

500
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,825
This dame's got class.

501
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:35,002
That's not the girl.

502
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:37,439
That's not the one, huh?
No.

503
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:43,576
That's not the dame
I saw coming in here
a couple of days ago?

504
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,143
And once before that?

No.

506
00:35:48,972 --> 00:35:50,931
I haven''t seen that girl
since I left Paris.

507
00:35:50,974 --> 00:35:52,019

Yes, that's right.

512
00:36:00,114 --> 00:36:02,899
That thing she wrote
on the picture.
It's in English.

513
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,988
What about it?
Lot of people in France
write English.

514
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:08,514
What are you
so jumpy about, pal?

515
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,779
I'm not jumpy.
Oh.

516
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,261
What's keeping you
from your torch?

00:47:33,459 --> 00:47:35,678
Decided that she rather
start with a bracelet.

So, I went without
my lunch for a whole month
