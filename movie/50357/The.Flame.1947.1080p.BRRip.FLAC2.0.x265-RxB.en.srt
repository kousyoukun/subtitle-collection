1
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,110
You didn't really expect to get away

2
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,690
with a thing like that, did you?

3
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,610
Frankly, officer, I didn't.

4
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,030
Then why try it?

5
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,240
If you don't care about yourself,
think about other people.

6
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,620
Drivin' through traffic
at 50 miles an hour.

7
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,910
Traffic?

8
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,330
You...

9
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,290
Oh.

10
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,710
I'm sorry, officer.

11
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,580
Now, you keep it up and
this'll be the last New Year's

12
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
you'll ever see.

13
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,590
Unpleasant thought, isn't it?

14
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,380
Isn't it, though?

15
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,010
Okay, go ahead, but take it easy.

16
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,340
I don't wanna hand out any
tickets tonight unless I have to.

17
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,340
Thanks.

18
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,700
Oh, Mr. MacAllister.

19
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,620
A letter for you, and a happy New Year.

20
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,540
Happy New Year, Mr. MacAllister.

21
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,640
Something wrong, Mr. Boss?

22
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,720
No.

23
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,640
You going to spend New Year Eve alone?

24
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,730
Yeah.

25
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,230
You want Chang to stay,

26
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,690
maybe mix drink, keep you company?

27
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,400
No, just close the
door from the outside.

28
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,700
Chang do something wrong?

29
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,030
You wish him unhappy New Year?

30
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,790
All right.

31
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,120
Happy New Year, Chang.

32
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,580
- Good night.
- No hurry, it's all right.

33
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,960
Chinese New Year not for a long time yet.

34
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,010
Operator?

35
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,090
Police department.

36
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,140
Thank you.

37
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,230
Police department?

38
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,440
My name is George MacAllister.

39
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,900
I live at 150 West 59th.

40
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:07,980
I just killed...

41
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,740
I just killed a man.

42
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,990
You'll find his body
at Rossmore Apartments,

43
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
East 7th,

44
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,210
apartment 14.

45
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,790
What's that?

46
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Yes.

47
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,890
Yeah, he's quite dead.

48
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,210
<i>My dear George,</i>

49
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,960
<i>I should have known sooner</i>

50
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,210
<i>that the hate that you
bore your half-brother</i>

51
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,090
<i>must one day bring you to this point.</i>

52
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,970
<i>Crime and passion are a bad
mixture at best, George.</i>

53
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,140
<i>When the passion is hate,</i>

54
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,270
<i>nothing but evil and violence can result.</i>

55
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,110
<i>It was shortly after Dr.
Mitchell had pronounced</i>

56
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,530
<i>his death sentence on your brother Barry,</i>

57
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,400
<i>giving him only a little
more time to live,</i>

58
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,110
<i>a few months at the most, he said,</i>

59
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,990
<i>and sent him deeper into the seclusion</i>

60
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,410
<i>of that place he called home</i>

61
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,080
<i>and deeper into the dark mood
that seemed to find comfort</i>

62
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,090
<i>only in that unhappy organ music of his.</i>

63
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,290
<i>Your Aunt Margaret was there,</i>

64
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,160
<i>and Barry,</i>

65
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,050
<i>and I, Carlotta Duval.</i>

66
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,940
Stop it, please, please!

67
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,940
Are you ill, Ms. Duval?

68
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,570
Don't you care for my music?

69
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,150
It's, it's your bedtime, that's all.

70
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,990
Why, it's just 8:30.

71
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,740
8:30?

72
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,660
Yes, it's 8:30 outside, but not here.

73
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,160
In this house, it's midnight all the time.

74
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,580
Aren't you being a
little dramatic, Ms. Duval?

75
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,880
Perhaps I am.

76
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Sorry.

77
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,750
Barry's music relaxes him.

78
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,510
Relaxes him?

79
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,930
It's killing him.

80
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,930
Ms. Duval.

81
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,720
Barry, my poor boy.

82
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,980
So it is my music.

83
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,100
I'm sorry, Mr. MacAllister.

84
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,730
That's all right.

85
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,030
But why don't you like it?

86
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,820
I don't like it for
what it's doing to you.

87
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,950
Those depressing dirges you
call music are as ugly as,

88
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,330
as what you're waiting for.

89
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,620
The girl is insane.

90
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,290
No, no, I'm not.

91
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,330
But I will be if I stay here any longer.

92
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,210
Just a moment, Ms. Duval.

93
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,670
It seems you have an opinion of me.

94
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,680
I'd like to hear it.

95
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,510
Yes, yes, I have an opinion of you.

96
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,350
Barry, let her go.

97
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,770
Ms. Duval, you're exciting him.

98
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,930
I warn you.

99
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,610
His pulse is very firm,

100
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,030
and it'll take more than my opinion

101
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,400
to get through that blanket of self-pity

102
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,910
you've thrown around yourself.

103
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,860
Self-pity?

104
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,620
Isn't a dying man entitled even to that?

105
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,910
A dying man?

106
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,290
To be a dying man, you
must first be a living man.

107
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,170
You're not living.

108
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,420
You have already abandoned life.

109
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,090
I'm going to call Dr. Mitchell.

110
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,090
I'll save you the trouble.

111
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,930
I'll call Dr. Mitchell

112
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,720
and ask him to send another nurse tonight.

113
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,600
Hello?

114
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Dr. Mitchell.

115
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,270
Ms. Duval speaking.

116
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,860
Dr. Mitchell, I'm quitting...

117
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,450
Hello, Uncle Joe.

118
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,910
Wrong?

119
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,910
Oh, no.

120
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,830
No, I think Ms. Duval
just wanted to report

121
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,580
that her patient is feeling
exceptionally well tonight.

122
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,420
Quitting?

123
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,500
No, I, I think she wanted

124
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,420
to quit giving me the
brown pills, the big ones.

125
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,090
Can you imagine, Ms. Duval?

126
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,510
He thought you were quitting.

127
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,850
No, Uncle Joe.

128
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,350
No, I think she's very happy here.

129
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,350
And as for myself,

130
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,310
I couldn't get along without her.

131
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,720
<i>She's very happy here.</i>

132
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,600
<i>As for myself,</i>

133
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,440
<i>I couldn't get along without her.</i>

134
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,490
Now do you like my music, Ms. Duval?

135
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,080
It's wonderful.

136
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,370
But why aren't you in bed?

137
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,080
I couldn't sleep.

138
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,170
Then I did upset you.

139
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,170
Yes.

140
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,920
Yes, you did.

141
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,800
I was thinking about you.

142
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,930
There's one thing I didn't
think about you, though.

143
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,600
Of course, I didn't know it then.

144
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,740
It was how lovely you would look

145
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,480
coming down a staircase wearing

146
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,480
just that.

147
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,490
But Mr. MacAllister,
you are not supposed to-

148
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,780
Not supposed to think about

149
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,740
fair ladies and romance, Ms. Duval?

150
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,330
That's exactly what I was thinking about.

151
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,960
Carlotta.

152
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,420
Yes, Mr. MacAllister?

153
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,260
I, uh, know I haven't much to offer you,

154
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,770
except companionship,

155
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,850
money, love.

156
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,360
It's not much to trade for the happiness

157
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,690
I know that you can give me

158
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:14,610
during whatever time is left.

159
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,080
Carlotta?

160
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,160
Yes?

161
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,460
Will you marry me?

162
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,460
You poor, poor man.

163
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,130
Now you'll never know I,

164
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,470
I would have married you if you
hadn't a penny to your name.

165
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,940
Kitten!

166
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,150
It worked, darling, it worked!

167
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,320
He went for it?

168
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,150
We'll be married Monday.

169
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,120
Great, where's the happy
event going to take place?

170
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,700
In his apartment here in New York?

171
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,740
No, he wants to be married
in the family chapel.

172
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,330
Oh, you're wonderful.

173
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:06,410
And I love you.

174
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,790
It's about time you said so.

175
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,250
Never doubt it.

176
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,040
It was my lucky day when I met Nurse Duval

177
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,250
at that French hospital.

178
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,380
Nurse Duval.

179
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,010
You know, you were the only
good thing that happened to me

180
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,550
in the whole war.

181
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,890
It was my lucky day, too.

182
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,600
Oh, it's good to be here.

183
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,310
If I could only stay forever.

184
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,180
Poor kitten,
you're tired, aren't you?

185
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,480
No, I'm not tired exactly,

186
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,350
at least not from the work.

187
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,480
It was a strain, darling.

188
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,520
It took such a long time,

189
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,070
I was about ready to propose to him.

190
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,110
Mm-mm, wouldn't have worked.

191
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,440
I know the guy.

192
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,200
I bet when the icy, impersonal Ms. Duval

193
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,610
finally let him have that burst of temper,

194
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,780
he fell off the organ bench.

195
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,990
Practically.

196
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,740
But I'm glad it's over.

197
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,040
I wasn't joking when I told him

198
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,950
I was going insane out there.

199
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,870
I wouldn't mind a wife
who's a little nuts,

200
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,460
as long as she has a few million dollars.

201
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,630
Come on.

202
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,090
This calls for a celebration.

203
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,050
Here, we'll bring to the
future Mrs. MacAllister

204
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,430
To the future which
Mrs. MacAllister, huh?

205
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,600
The Mrs. George MacAllister, of course.

206
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,140
Most certainly not the
wealthy widow MacAllister yet.

207
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,940
Don't, George.

208
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,320
What was that for?

209
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,110
Well, I don't know.

210
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,780
It's just that he doesn't seem so bad.

211
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,580
Well, you better take
another look at him.

212
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,120
But out of respect for your opinion,

213
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,330
I'll send the biggest wreath
I can find to his funeral.

214
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,200
Please don't, it's, it's bad enough

215
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,370
that our happiness depends on that.

216
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,790
Is it our fault that he's got a body

217
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,580
that doesn't wanna stay wrapped
around that penny-pinching,

218
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,920
shriveled up little
soul of his any longer?

219
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,960
No, no, of course not.

220
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,210
And don't be angry with me,

221
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,470
especially not just now,
but I have to leave.

222
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,590
I'm not angry, kitten.

223
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,430
But when am I gonna see you again?

224
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,100
It gets a little lonely up here.

225
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,640
I'll see you as soon as I can,

226
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,980
but see that you stay lonesome for me.

227
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,810
Don't go looking for new company.

228
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,900
Ah, kitten, you know your
Georgie better than that.

229
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,120
I certainly do know my Georgie.

230
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,160
I'm just teasing.

231
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,580
Hey, wait a minute.

232
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,330
Maybe I'm the one that should be worrying,

233
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,370
just a little?

234
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,710
No, darling.

235
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,580
With me, you're my love,

236
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,880
and Barry's my business.

237
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,380
Trust me.

238
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,130
I'll not mix the two.

239
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,110
<i>Only dazedly do I recall
the next few days.</i>

240
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,820
<i>The hours became a solid mold of anxiety,</i>

241
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,280
<i>anxiety over my ability to go through</i>

242
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,160
<i>with what we had planned,</i>

243
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,460
<i>over the normal details attending
marriage to a MacAllister,</i>

244
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,790
<i>and then it was Monday,
the day of the wedding.</i>

245
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,460
<i>And I stood before a mirror dressed</i>

246
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,340
<i>as I had once hoped to be
dressed for another wedding.</i>

247
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,720
All right?

248
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,340
Just as pretty as a picture.

249
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,600
There ain't no other word for it.

250
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,310
Just as pretty as a picture.

251
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,270
Oh, I'm glad.

252
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,310
Now, you'd better go and
help Mr. MacAllister.

253
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,850
Yessum, I sure will.

254
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,150
I'll do just that.

255
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,940
Something old, something new,

256
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,240
something borrowed, something blue.

257
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,620
Something borrowed.

258
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,530
I forgot.

259
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,200
Something borrowed?

260
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,330
You startled me.

261
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,220
Would this be suitable, do you think?

262
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,850
It's quite horrible.

263
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,850
Some might think it'd rather symbolic.

264
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm tired of your
insinuations, Ms. MacAllister.

265
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,650
If you have anything to say,

266
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,820
then say it, and be done with it.

267
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,570
I have only one thing to say, Ms. Duval.

268
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,280
Don't marry my nephew.

269
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,580
Your motives are obvious.

270
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,120
I must ask you to leave my room.

271
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:22,040
I have no desire to remain longer.

272
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,430
After you have repeated
our conversation to Barry,

273
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,350
I imagine he will want
me to move elsewhere.

274
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,770
I'll not repeat it to him.

275
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,350
And you may stay in this
house for as long as you wish.

276
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,770
I'm not afraid of you, Ms. MacAllister.

277
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,320
That is a great mistake. Ms. Duval.

278
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Come in.

279
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,930
Yes, Doctor.

280
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,060
What do you mean by that, "Yes, Doctor"?

281
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,270
Oh.

282
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,940
Quite a bit different from the uniform

283
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,360
I expected you to wear
when I sent you out here.

284
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,200
Haven't I seen Maggie, Ms.
MacAllister, wearing this?

285
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,240
She thought I should wear it.

286
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,290
Something borrowed.

287
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,500
Nasty looking thing.

288
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:42,170
Well, Ms. Duval, I expect you
know I didn't come up here

289
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,170
to inspect the bride's wedding gown.

290
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,880
I know why you came
up here, Dr. Mitchell.

291
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,300
Ms. MacAllister left no doubt in my mind

292
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,970
that my marriage to Barry

293
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,260
isn't meeting with general approval.

294
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
So?

295
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,270
I'll have to give you
the same answer I gave her.

296
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,610
Nothing is going to stop this wedding.

297
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,230
You don't have to be
antagonistic toward me, Carlotta.

298
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,570
I didn't come here to
tell you not to marry him.

299
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,490
I just wanted to tell you something about

300
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,990
this man you're getting.

301
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:18,790
You see, I've watched him
grow up in this world,

302
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,370
and now, I'm faced with the unhappy task

303
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,120
of supervising his departure from it.

304
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,920
No one can know how I feel about the job.

305
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,550
Thanks, George.

306
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,300
Nice of you to help.

307
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,390
And I thought it was nice of you

308
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,550
to ask me to your wedding.

309
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,060
Oh, but I really wanted you here.

310
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,730
See, I figured that, uh,

311
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,140
if you saw the happy,
eager look on my face,

312
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,060
contentment in my eyes,

313
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,400
might encourage even you to settle down.

314
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,990
Abandon hope, my dear brother.

315
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,610
I consider marriage settling up, not down.

316
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,830
Payment in full for
all the fun you've had.

317
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,370
Oh, then you don't approve
of my getting married?

318
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,830
Oh, now wait a minute.

319
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:02,960
Settling, I approve.

320
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,960
I just hate to think of your widow.

321
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,840
Practically a stranger getting
all that beautiful money.

322
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,920
Now, look, why don't you be a good guy

323
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,800
and put me back in your will?

324
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,050
Oh, no, no, I wouldn't
think of it, George.

325
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:17,760
Spoil our lovely relationship.

326
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,470
You see, you're the only relative I have

327
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,230
who isn't waiting for me
to join our ancestors.

328
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,560
Probably because you have
nothing to gain by it.

329
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,110
Uh, yeah, that's possible.

330
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
But I certainly would
like to be mentioned.

331
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,280
Oh, you're mentioned.

332
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,280
You get a dollar.

333
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,200
A dollar?

334
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,530
You could at least make a two.

335
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,740
Cab fare to the funeral.

336
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,000
You're making a mess out of that tie.

337
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Let me fix it.

338
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:48,920
This girl you're marrying, she's
after your money of course.

339
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,550
She's gonna get it, whether
she's after it, or not.

340
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,880
But if you think that's
what she's marrying me for,

341
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,970
you don't know her.

342
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
That's right.

343
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,800
But I've known a lot of women in my life.

344
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,100
They're all alike.

345
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,680
"This girl's different, I tell you."

346
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,930
"Her smile when she gives it is"

347
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,520
"an instant of complete happiness."

348
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,730
"The touch of her hands
is a lifetime of pleasure."

349
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,230
"To make her my wife
will be the achievement"

350
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:15,280
"of all the beautiful
dreams I've ever known."

351
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Oh, no.

352
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,660
Never felt that way about a woman, huh?

353
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,660
No.

354
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,330
And in all apologies for
your flowery description,

355
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,620
there is no such woman.

356
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,660
No?

357
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
No.

358
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,420
"My dear Barry, well,
it seems the bullet

359
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,470
"that got me in the leg
was only making a detour,

360
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,100
"and didn't have my name on it after all.

361
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,720
"I," let's see.

362
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Oh, here it is.

363
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Listen carefully.

364
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,020
"She's a nurse."

365
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,270
"This girl is different, I tell you."

366
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,570
"Her smile when she gives it is"

367
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,780
"an instant of complete happiness."

368
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,570
"The touch of her hands
is a lifetime of pleasure."

369
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,280
"To make her my wife
will be the achievement"

370
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:04,410
"of all the beautiful
dreams I've ever known."

371
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,160
Ever heard those words before, huh?

372
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
No.

373
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,540
"As ever, George."

374
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
George who?

375
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,380
You, Mr. MacAllister.

376
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,590
Oh, well.

377
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,300
I memorized them.

378
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,890
Thought they were so nice.

379
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,560
Whatever happened to her, George?

380
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,730
I don't know.

381
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,520
Guess she must be kicking
around Paris someplace.

382
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,070
It's too bad you lost track of her.

383
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,860
What was her name now?

384
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,240
I, uh, I don't know.

385
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,400
I don't remember.

386
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,320
Why didn't you marry her?

387
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,620
And what did you do with
the money that I sent you

388
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,030
for that particular purpose?

389
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,700
I, uh, got rolled
over by a roulette wheel

390
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,460
on the way to church.

391
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,420
It's too bad you didn't marry her.

392
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,790
Would've been good for you.

393
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,500
You know, it still might be.

394
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,210
I'm in a magnanimous mood, George.

395
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,430
You find her, and I'll stake
you to any business you name.

396
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,510
If she doesn't wanna leave France,

397
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,600
I'll put you in charge of
our organization over there.

398
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,680
Well, what do you say?

399
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:09,640
I'll think about it.

400
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,020
Good, good.

401
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,810
Oh, by the way, I had the
office make out a check,

402
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,070
sort of a wedding present in reverse

403
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,400
from me to you.

404
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,110
My, my.

405
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,780
$10,000?

406
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,450
Thanks, I certainly can use it.

407
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,370
That's what I figured.

408
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:28,950
If getting married puts
you in this kind of mood,

409
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,290
we should do it more often.

410
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,660
I hope you'll take my advice.

411
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,120
About what?

412
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,670
Find that girl and marry her.

413
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Yeah.

414
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,420
I'll see if I can remember her name.

415
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,510
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered together here

416
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,970
in the sight of God and in
the face of this company

417
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,730
to join together this man and
this woman in holy matrimony,

418
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,150
which is an honorable
estate, instituted of God,

419
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,820
signifying unto us the mystical union

420
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,030
that is betwixt Christ and his church,

421
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,860
which holy estate Christ adorned

422
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,530
and beautified with his presence

423
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,000
and first miracle that he
wrought in Cana of Galilee,

424
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,710
and is commended of St. Paul
to be honorable among all men,

425
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,210
and therefore is not by any to
be entered into unadvisedly,

426
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:22,840
or lightly, but reverently, discreetly,

427
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,390
advisedly, soberly, and in fear of God.

428
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,180
Into this holy estate,

429
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,640
these two persons present
come now to be joined.

430
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,600
If any man can show just cause

431
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,400
why they may not lawfully
be joined together,

432
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,520
let him now speak,

433
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,780
or else hereafter forever hold his peace.

434
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,740
Barry, will thou have this
woman to thy wedded wife,

435
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,450
to live together after God's ordinance

436
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,080
in the holy estate of matrimony?

437
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,250
Will thou love her, comfort her,

438
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,710
honor and keep her in
sickness and in health,

439
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,970
and forsaking all others
keep thee only unto her

440
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,630
so long as ye both shall live?

441
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,470
I will.

442
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,700
The Lord mercifully with
his favor look upon you

443
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,950
and fill you with all
spiritual benediction

444
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:37,040
and grace that you may so
live together in this life

445
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,750
that in the world to come,
you may have life everlasting.

446
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,750
Amen.

447
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,550
I wish you both much happiness.

448
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

449
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,940
Sorry.

450
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,230
Me too.

451
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,440
Good evening, Mr. MacAllister.

452
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,940
- Any messages?
- No, sir, except your bill.

453
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,990
I have it right here.

454
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,540
This includes the current month.

455
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,580
Well, get that worried
look off your face.

456
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,660
I'm gonna pray it.

457
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,710
You are?

458
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,710
Fine.

459
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:24,710
Although we never really
worry about your account.

460
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,760
I'll bet you don't.

461
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,260
Who's the guy over there?

462
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,930
I don't know.

463
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,480
Put the receipt in my box, will you?

464
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,520
Thank you, sir.

465
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,460
<i>With me,
darling, you're my love,</i>

466
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
<i>and Barry's my business.</i>

467
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,790
<i>Trust me, dear.</i>

468
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,410
Okay, let's have it.

469
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,250
What's on your mind?

470
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,120
What is this, a stick-up?

471
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:26,290
You know it's no stick-up!

472
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,340
What is it then?

473
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Every time I turn
around, I see your face.

474
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,210
It's my face, I'll
take it where I please.

475
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,840
If you don't want it
messed up, quit trailing me.

476
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,880
If anybody's trailing you, I
don't know anything about it.

477
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,640
I get troubles of my own
that don't include you.

478
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,970
Then what are you
casing my apartment for?

479
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,220
Your apartment?

480
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,230
Is your name Helene?

481
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,730
Do you work at the Chapeau Blanc?

482
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:46,980
Have I got a yen for you?

483
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
Helene?

484
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,820
Helene Anderson?

485
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
Yeah.

486
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,820
Oh, you know her, that's your angle.

487
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,120
No, I just heard she
moved into the apartment.

488
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,660
What are you watching her for?

489
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,410
She's a dame that needs watching.

490
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,000
Girlfriend?

491
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,870
Sometimes I wonder.

492
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,170
I've been out of town a while.

493
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,170
Checking up before checking in?

494
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,130
Something like that.

495
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,420
She wouldn't talk to me on the phone.

496
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,920
Just waiting around to find out why.

497
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:17,130
Oh.

498
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,130
Say, uh...

499
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,310
I'm sorry I jumped you the way I did.

500
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,220
I guess I'm a little nervous.

501
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,230
Nervous?

502
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
Yes.

503
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,610
You see, I'm having a little
romantic trouble myself.

504
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,610
Oh.

505
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,530
Now I know how you
feel, I tell you what.

506
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,450
Let's go up to my apartment.

507
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:37,410
We can have a couple of drinks.

508
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,240
Do us both good.

509
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,660
It's as good a place to wait as any.

510
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,370
Okay.

511
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,750
- Make yourself at home.
- Right.

512
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,040
Nice place you got here.

513
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,290
Thanks.

514
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,420
If I could support a layout like this,

515
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,460
I wouldn't have any worries about Helene.

516
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,500
What'll you have to drink?

517
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,670
Bourbon, you got any?

518
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:56,920
Yeah.

519
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,470
Helene, I take it, likes nice things.

520
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,470
Yeah.

521
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,850
You ain't kidding.

522
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,810
She likes anything that
costs a lot of dough,

523
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,020
if you know what I mean.

524
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,360
When I got it, she even likes me.

525
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
That ain't often.

526
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,620
I don't know what kind
of trouble you're having

527
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,280
with that dame of yours.

528
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,740
Bet she ain't two-timing you.

529
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,160
What makes you so sure?

530
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
Her face.

531
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,040
This dame's got class.

532
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,090
That's not the girl.

533
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,710
That's not the one, huh?

534
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,710
No.

535
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,220
That's not the dame I saw coming in here

536
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,640
a couple of days ago,

537
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,720
and once before that?

538
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,020
No.

539
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,060
I haven't seen that
girl since I left Paris.

540
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
Oh.

541
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,230
For all I know, she's still there.

542
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,230
French dame, huh?

543
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,490
Yes, that's right.

544
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,030
That autograph,

545
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,910
that thing she wrote on the picture,

546
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,910
it's in English.

547
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,740
Well, what about it?

548
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,450
A lot of people in France write English.

549
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,750
What are you so jumpy about, pal?

550
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,080
I'm not jumpy.

551
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Oh.

552
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,550
What's keeping you from your torch?

553
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,840
Oh.

554
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
Married, huh?

555
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,810
Yes, that's right.

556
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:27,810
She's married.

557
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,440
Say, Ernie, do me a favor, will you?

558
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,000
Go in the kitchen, and get me some ice.

559
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,570
- Ice?
- Yeah, over there.

560
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,900
Oh.

561
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,160
Wanna call her, huh?

562
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,380
<i>Hello?</i>

563
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,220
George.

564
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,800
What are you calling
for this time of night?

565
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,220
I just wanted to apologize

566
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,890
for running away from the
wedding and reception.

567
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,810
Would you put Barry,

568
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,480
or my brand-new
sister-in-law on the phone?

569
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,940
No.

570
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,940
I'll give them your message.

571
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
They've retired.

572
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,780
I see.

573
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,030
Good night, Aunt Maggie.

574
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,090
That's the trouble with having
a girlfriend who's married.

575
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:43,010
If her man answers, you gotta hang up.

576
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,260
Tell you what, Ernie.

577
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
What?

578
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,600
Let's go see Helene.

579
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,230
Helene?

580
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,860
Yes, Ms. Anderson.

581
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,900
You said her name was Helene, didn't you?

582
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,740
Why should you wanna go see her?

583
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,660
You said you didn't know her.

584
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,450
Well, I just feel like going someplace.

585
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,000
I feel as though I owe you
a little entertainment.

586
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,120
Oh.

587
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,790
Come on, I'll
take you both to dinner.

588
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,080
She's working, singing.

589
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,590
All right, we'll go there
and wait 'til she's through.

590
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,170
Between the two of us, we can convince her

591
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,130
that Ernie Hicks is a man of importance.

592
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:27,430

618
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,960
Very attractive.

619
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,920
The way guys go for her,

620
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,380
you can see why I gotta watch her.

621
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:30,840
I certainly can't say that I do.

622
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,800
She had a nice big smile for you.

623
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,640
That was for you,

624
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,800
the gold cuff links you're wearing,

625
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,550
and the good stuff in that suit.

626
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,430
She'll tell you the price of both of them

627
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,220
from 50 yards away.

628
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,390
Ernie, you're bitter.

629
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,890
You think she'll join us?

630
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,100
After one gander at you,
there's no doubt about it.

631
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,650
Hello, Ernie.

632
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,530
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

633
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:54,410
I sure missed you.

634
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,410
Oh, excuse me.

635
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,080
Ms. Anderson, I want
you to meet my friend,

636
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,620
Mr. MacAllister.

637
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,620
How do you do?

638
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,540
How do you do?

639
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,290
Sit down, won't you?

640
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,210
I sure missed you, kid.

641
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:10,090
You said that already.

642
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,840
Why wouldn't you see me
when I came back to town?

643
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,050
I told you over the phone.

644
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:15,260
I've been too busy with rehearsals.

645
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,300
I've heard it said about
great singers, Ms. Anderson,

646
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,760
after rehearsals come in the door,

647
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,350
romance flies out of the window.

648
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:23,060
Or was it vice versa?

649
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,360
Yes, I guess it was vice versa.

650
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,820
I guess.

651
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,730
Anyway, it's nice to have you join us.

652
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,570
Will you have dinner with us?

653
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,360
- Sure, I'd love to.
- Oh, swell.

654
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,320
This time, the dinner's on him.

655
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,410
Next time, it's on me.

656
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,030
Fine, after tonight, I
was going on a diet anyway.

657
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,160
Say, where did he pick you up?

658
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,120
I didn't pick him up, he picked me up.

659
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,500
That's right.

660
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,960
We're gonna have a lot of fun together.

661
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,630
We've got a lot in common,
Mr. MacAllister and I.

662
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,000
What's he talking about?

663
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,460
Oh, you're drunk and I'm hungry.

664
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,760
I think we better let
Mr. MacAllister order.

665
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:58,590
The menu's printed in French, kid.

666
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,760
He had a French girl in Paris.

667
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,600
How nice.

668
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,810
Oh, you better order some champagne.

669
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,180
Goes good with French food.

670
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,910
Thank you for a very pleasant evening.

671
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,950
It's been fun, especially meeting you.

672
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,790
My pleasure.

673
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,960
Oh, care for a nightcap?

674
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,540
No, thanks, past my bedtime.

675
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,540
I could use one.

676
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,170
It's past my bedtime, too.

677
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:33,670
Good night, Mr. MacAllister.

678
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,510
Good night.

679
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,590
See you around, Ernie.

680
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,140
Well, I'm gonna walk up, Ernie.

681
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,640
I'll take the elevator.

682
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:44,890
- Say, Ernie.
- Yeah?

683
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,060
About that news item.

684
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,520
You can understand why I
said it was a different girl.

685
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,770
Sure, sure.

686
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,400
Well, now that she's
married, it's all over,

687
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,610
and, well, you know-

688
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,530
- It's all over?
- Naturally.

689
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
Oh.

690
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,820
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention

691
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,490
seeing her come up here to anybody.

692
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:03,790
Consider it forgotten.

693
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,120
Atta boy, Ernie, thanks.

694
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,870
Here's something.

695
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,670
I think it might help you out with Helene.

696
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,670
Nah, no, no, no.

697
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,130
I wouldn't think of it.

698
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,050
I'll be seeing you.

699
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:29,100
- Who's there?
- It's me.

700
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,440
Hi, neighbor.

701
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,730
Howdy ma'am.

702
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,530
Long time no see.

703
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,280
Well, I decided I'd
have that nightcap alone,

704
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:41,110
but when I looked in my bar, no whiskey,

705
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,780
so I just ran up to
borrow a cup of bourbon

706
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,780
from my neighbor.

707
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,370
What are you looking for?

708
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:49,370
Mice.

709
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,210
Will you drink it here,
or take it with you?

710
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:56,000
I think I'll drink it here.

711
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,550
Mm, I've been wanting that all evening.

712
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,510
Couldn't wait any longer.

713
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,720
Me too.

714
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,680
Really?

715
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,560
Really.

716
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,030
What are you looking for?

717
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,030
My picture.

718
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:22,870
Where have you got it?

719
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:23,700
In the-

720
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:26,240
No, it's not in the kitchen, either.

721
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,990
It's right there in the desk.

722
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,250
I just left at there 'til
I got, um, a frame for it.

723
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:35,590
I forgive you.

724
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,710
It's a good thing it was in the drawer

725
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,710
when Ernie was here.

726
00:44:40,130 --> 00:44:42,220
Why didn't you tell me you knew him?

727
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,140
Ernie?

728
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,140
Yes, Ernie.

729
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,220
I forgot.

730
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,220
Of course, you know
he's slightly jealous.

731
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:52,640
Oh, he gives me a pain.

732
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,020
Say, how did you ever
get mixed up with him?

733
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,650
I don't know, I felt
sorry for him, I guess.

734
00:44:58,650 --> 00:44:59,570
He's nuts about you.

735
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,030
Oh, he is nuts period.

736
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,280
But he's a troublemaker,
and if you take my advice,

737
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,780
you'll brush him fast.

738
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:08,040
So why do you let him hang around?

739
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,210
I won't, Georgie, if,
if you don't want me to.

740
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:15,130
I wouldn't take the responsibility.

741
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,050
Just for that, I think I'll
take this and drink it alone.

742
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,300
Good idea, kitten.

743
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,970
But I didn't mean it, George.

744
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:26,510
I, I don't wanna go.

745
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:28,220
But-You need your beauty rest.

746
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,140
Good night, kitten, and happy hangover.

747
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:44,700
Celia, what's so
interesting out those windows?

748
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,700
Mr. and Mrs. MacAllister,
they're down by the sea,

749
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,660
that beautiful old sea on the high cliff.

750
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,540
On the point?

751
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,620
Yessum.

752
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,370
Ain't it wonderful, Ms. Margaret,

753
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,090
the change that's come over
him since he found her?

754
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,340
Ain't it, though?

755
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,380
That love bug sure is a
wonderful little creature.

756
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,590
He sure is.

757
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:07,930
He's one of God's chosen creatures
that little old love bug.

758
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,430
If you've finished down here,

759
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,690
you'd better start with the bedrooms.

760
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,730
- Yessum.
- And don't forget

761
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,190
to check on the linens.

762
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,190
Yessum.

763
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,530
That little old love
bug is still all right.

764
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,880
Barry, please, not so close.

765
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,750
It frightens me.

766
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,840
Don't worry, I'll be careful.

767
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,920
If the fall down there didn't kill me,

768
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,340
the climb back up would.

769
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,430
Then step back a little.

770
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:52,600
You love this,

771
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,970
the sea and the cliffs

772
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,270
and the rocks.

773
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,520
Don't you?

774
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:00,520
I do again, now that you're here.

775
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,240
Say, by the way, you're,

776
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,530
you're not the fisherman's little girl

777
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,990
that used to play over
these rocks with me?

778
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,660
No, why?

779
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,240
You have the same effect on me.

780
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,040
Was she a blonde?

781
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,120
I don't know.

782
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,080
Her hair was always so full of seaweed.

783
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:23,790
Yeah, we built beautiful,
wonderful air castles,

784
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,800
my little beachcomber and I.

785
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,760
I was going to buy her the whole world,

786
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,390
starting out with a marble
palace, a golden yacht.

787
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,510
But she was a realist,

788
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,060
decided she'd rather
start with a bracelet.

789
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,270
So I went without my
lunch for a whole month

790
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,480
and bought the bracelet.

791
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,360
Mm, I bet she loved it.

792
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,360
She never saw it.

793
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,070
George showed up that summer

794
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,070
and I lost my little beachcomber.

795
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,320
George stole your girl?

796
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,740
Oh, sure, George always stole my girls.

797
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,500
You know, by a peculiar coincidence,

798
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,290
I just happen to have
that bracelet with me.

799
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,710
Wear it, darling.

800
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,050
It's wonderful to regain something

801
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,680
you've loved and lost as a child.

802
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,430
You know what I mean?

803
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:15,810
Yes, yes, I do.

804
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:18,810
How?

805
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,850
Because of, because of Henry.

806
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,770
Oh, you had a little boyfriend, huh?

807
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,650
No, French poodle.

808
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,280
I hated the taxi cab that killed him.

809
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:36,490
No wonder you dislike George
for taking her from you.

810
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:39,040
Dislike George?

811
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,040
Whatever gave you that idea?

812
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,170
I, I don't know, I thought-

813
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,880
Because he's shiftless and lazy,

814
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,840
plays too much and works too little,

815
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,000
'cause he took my girls away from me?

816
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,800
For that I should dislike him?

817
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,380
Oh, nothing of the sort.

818
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:54,760
I've always liked George.

819
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,970
He's got a way with him.

820
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:00,810
Oh, I've always tried to
get him to settle down.

821
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,060
Almost succeeded once.

822
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:04,810
When was that?

823
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,440
When he was overseas.

824
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,320
Got a bullet in his leg,

825
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,940
fell head over heels
in love with the nurse

826
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:12,900
that took care of him,
wanted to marry her.

827
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,860
At least, that's what he wrote me.

828
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:17,410
Of course, I'm always
meddling in George's affairs.

829
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:18,410
Even on our wedding day,

830
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,370
I offered to set him up
in any business he'd name

831
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:23,210
if he'd find that girl and marry her.

832
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,670
He wouldn't, I, I suppose.

833
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,040
No, same old George.

834
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,630
Couldn't even remember her name.

835
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,630
Oh, darling, you're getting cold.

836
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,840
Here I am boring you
with a family skeleton.

837
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,350
Come on, I'll take you back to the house.

838
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,350
Oh, Barry, I, I've been thinking about

839
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,100
your New York apartment.

840
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,310
I'd like to fix it up a bit

841
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,900
in case we get to use it more often.

842
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,940
Well, that would be all right, but-

843
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:50,440
You'd rather I didn't?

844
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,690
Oh, no, of course not.

845
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,400
Go ahead and do it if you'd enjoy it.

846
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,530
I'll have Hammer bring the car.

847
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,690
I told Barry I was going shopping.

848
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,110
Hammer brought me in.

849
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:37,990
He didn't bring you here?

850
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:39,370
No, of course not.

851
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,740
I had him let me off at Barry's apartment.

852
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:43,830
Then I took a cab.

853
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:44,910
Smart girl.

854
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,370
Know how much I missed you?

855
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,340
What's the matter?

856
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:53,420
I don't know what's wrong with me.

857
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,260
I, I'm upset

858
00:50:56,170 --> 00:50:57,170
About what?

859
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,220
You don't mean to tell
me that my dear brother

860
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,270
isn't feeling well, I hope?

861
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,680
He's feeling all right,

862
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,020
but, well, George, he told
me some things about you,

863
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,940
and I had to see you.

864
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:12,400
Oh, I know I'm being foolish.

865
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:15,940
Tell me I'm being foolish, darling,

866
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,950
that they aren't so,

867
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,740
that I'm just upset because
I got too lonesome for you.

868
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,450
If they bother you,
kitten, they aren't so.

869
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,910
He said you wanted
to marry me in France.

870
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,920
You?

871
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,540
Well, he said a nurse in France.

872
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,050
I knew he meant me.

873
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,800
Well, say that's so.

874
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,260
If I hadn't been broke-
But he sent you money.

875
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,260
So what?

876
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,470
Then he did send you money?

877
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:45,850
Yeah, he sent a little.

878
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:48,980
But why didn't we get married?

879
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,480
What did you do with it?

880
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,480
I don't know.

881
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,150
Bought you some posies,
or something, I guess.

882
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,940
It wasn't enough to think about.

883
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,610
But we didn't need much.

884
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,160
Just a little and each other
would have been enough.

885
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,320
Well, look, honey, you're
making something out of nothing.

886
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,280
You are letting him fill your head

887
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:05,410
with a lot of doubts about me

888
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,950
when you know he hates my guts.

889
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:09,870
But he doesn't, George.

890
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:10,870
He likes you.

891
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,210
Look, honey, I've known him
a lot longer than you have.

892
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,470
Doesn't hate you, George.

893
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,260
He doesn't.

894
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,560
All right, kitten.

895
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
All right.

896
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,980
Anything you say.

897
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,320
But you gotta let me run the show.

898
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,400
Have I ever steered you wrong?

899
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,740
No.

900
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,860
No, of course not.

901
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,820
Then you gotta trust me.

902
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,990
Will you?

903
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,790
I do, of course I do.

904
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:49,870
It's just that it's more difficult

905
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,500
than I thought it would be out there.

906
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,120
I know.

907
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,500
It isn't exactly easy in here either,

908
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,210
but you mustn't doubt me.

909
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,420
Forgive me, darling.

910
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,970
I'm just confused.

911
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,600
And I better be going.

912
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,020
You wanna go?

913
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,480
Well, I've got to.

914
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,900
Hi, Georgie.

915
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,020
Look, Ernie,
I'd like to have you stay,

916
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:03,320
but I've gotta change and go out.

917
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,280
I won't interfere with your dressing.

918
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:08,490
Have something I wanna talk to you about.

919
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:09,660
All right, what
do you wanna talk about?

920
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,080
I'm in a hurry.

921
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,160
Going out, huh?

922
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,540
- Yeah.
- Oh.

923
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,370
Well, what is it?

924
00:54:16,370 --> 00:54:18,130
How many bedrooms you got here?

925
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,380
One.

926
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,300
Oh.

927
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,340
Is that your
idea of something important

928
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:24,420
to talk about?

929
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:27,680
Thought I might move in with you.

930
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,140
Second thought, my taste is
a little snappier than this.

931
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,390
What makes you think
I'd let you move in with me?

932
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:36,980
Well, seeing as we're
in business together,

933
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:39,020
I figured we might as well live together.

934
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,110
Since when are we in business together?

935
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:45,070
Since your brother's wife parked her car

936
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:46,740
in front of your brother's
apartment downtown

937
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,660
and took a cab up here.

938
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,070
I wouldn't if I were you, Georgie.

939
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:52,120
I should've spotted you
for a stinkin' blackmailer

940
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,370
the first time I saw you!

941
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:56,250
I wasn't a blackmailer then.

942
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:58,080
You'd almost say it was your idea,

943
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,380
what, with being followed.

944
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:01,340
That, and Helene.

945
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,340
Helene?

946
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:06,420
She won't have anything to do with me.

947
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,470
Seems she's got a yen for somebody else.

948
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,180
I can't help you there.

949
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,350
No?

950
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,970
No.

951
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,770
Oh, I think you can.

952
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:22,900
When I got money, Helene
feels different towards me.

953
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,230
I don't get you.

954
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,110
I offered you some money the other night.

955
00:55:27,110 --> 00:55:28,150
Why didn't you take it?

956
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,160
Small money, Georgie, small money.

957
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:35,200
You know, the minute I laid eyes on you,

958
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,450
I knew I was in business.

959
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,540
Big business.

960
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:43,340
That shocks you, doesn't it?

961
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,300
You'd be amazed how
talkative the servants are

962
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,710
out at your brother's place.

963
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,760
Why didn't you tell me he only had

964
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,140
a couple of months to live?

965
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,890
Or maybe less now that he's
married to your Carlotta.

966
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,190
I got too much money
invested in you, Georgie.

967
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:10,530
Pour me one, too.

968
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,960
<i>My mind was
a welter of confusion</i>

969
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,130
<i>after leaving your
apartment that afternoon.</i>

970
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,840
<i>It was the first time I had
ever really doubted you, George.</i>

971
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,550
<i>But I doubted myself too.</i>

972
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,970
<i>And I was frightened as
I approached the house.</i>

973
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,860
<i>I felt I couldn't possibly
face its occupants,</i>

974
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,740
<i>and to my mind, the very house itself</i>

975
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,030
<i>scowled disapproval of me.</i>

976
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,200
<i>I felt the wind shriek its hatred,</i>

977
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,250
<i>and the ocean, always
angry and threatening,</i>

978
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:02,960
<i>seemed to be reaching for me,</i>

979
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,670
<i>trying to drag me by force from this place</i>

980
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:09,630
<i>which Barry loved, and in
which I was an imposter.</i>

981
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:13,050
<i>I started for the house.</i>

982
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,050
<i>An impasse made me turn,</i>

983
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:19,430
<i>and then go toward the chapel.</i>

984
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:31,110
<i>As I stood inside the door,</i>

985
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:34,240
<i>I looked at the place
where we were married,</i>

986
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,410
<i>Barry and I.</i>

987
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,080
<i>Then I seemed to hear bells.</i>

988
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
<i>And a voice.</i>

989
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,800
<i>I pronounce
that they are man and wife.</i>

990
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,860
<i>I knelt there for a long time,</i>

991
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,110
<i>but peace would not come to me.</i>

992
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,280
<i>I'm sure that if I prayed,</i>

993
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,240
<i>my prayers were so confused,</i>

994
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,580
<i>I wondered if even God
could understand them.</i>

995
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:29,380
<i>I was about to leave, when
there was an awful crash.</i>

996
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,190
<i>At first, I thought the light unearthly,</i>

997
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:56,450
<i>and then I was hearing our
wedding music in my imagination</i>

998
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,700
<i>as I had heard the bells,</i>

999
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,370
<i>and the words of the minister.</i>

1000
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,080
<i>Then I realized the music I was hearing</i>

1001
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,410
<i>was coming from the house.</i>

1002
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:07,410
<i>But the sudden peace</i>

1003
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,080
<i>and clarity in my mind were not imagined.</i>

1004
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,420
<i>You weren't in my thoughts, George,</i>

1005
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,300
<i>as I hurried from the chapel.</i>

1006
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:25,720
<i>I went through the doorway
of the house, my house,</i>

1007
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,600
<i>and for the first time, it welcomed me.</i>

1008
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,940
<i>It was then I knew I had
to tell Barry about myself.</i>

1009
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,650
<i>The thought instead of
frightening me brought me comfort.</i>

1010
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,910
Please don't stop.

1011
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,090
Say, do you know that
the room lit up just now

1012
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,250
when you walked in?

1013
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,970
Tell me, what's the cause
of this new radiance?

1014
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:00,640
Clear conscience.

1015
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,640
A wife with a clear conscience?

1016
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,260
I never heard of such a thing.

1017
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:08,560
It's the clear conscience
I'm about to have.

1018
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:10,560
Barry,

1019
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,110
you really don't know much
about this new wife of yours.

1020
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,280
Doesn't that ever bother you?

1021
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,280
No.

1022
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,410
Say, what is this, a confession?

1023
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,540
Yes.

1024
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,370
Well, that probably means

1025
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:31,500
I'll have to bare my lurid past.

1026
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:33,670
No dice.

1027
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,170
Please be serious, dear.

1028
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,170
Serious about your past?

1029
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:41,340
Just some of it, Barry.

1030
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,430
There are some things
you have a right to know.

1031
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,770
You may not like me
quite as much, or at all,

1032
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,150
but that's a chance I have to take.

1033
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:57,230
I don't think I could
live with myself if I-

1034
01:00:57,230 --> 01:00:59,030
Say, you are serious, aren't you?

1035
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:01,030
Yes.

1036
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Carlotta,

1037
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,790
I know about you.

1038
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,080
You know what?

1039
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,130
All that I want to know.

1040
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,210
All that's important.

1041
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,500
You see, darling, every man has a picture

1042
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,380
of the woman he loves.

1043
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,970
Mine is a picture of a pretty little girl

1044
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,720
that grew into a lovely young woman,

1045
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,470
put on this earth for the sole purpose

1046
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:32,640
of bringing happiness into
the life of Barry MacAllister.

1047
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,730
Humor me, darling.

1048
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:38,860
Let me look at my picture.

1049
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,860
See what I see.

1050
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,360
But it's not exactly the truth.

1051
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,280
Hmm, of course it's not.

1052
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,740
You're such a good little girl,

1053
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,330
you wanna tell me all about the time

1054
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,040
you held hands with the neighbor boy.

1055
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,460
Don't do it.

1056
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,630
I know it may sound funny to you,

1057
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,380
but, well, even that,

1058
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,300
just don't do it.

1059
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,890
<i>That was Barry.</i>

1060
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,640
<i>I looked at him with new eyes then</i>

1061
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:12,140
<i>and in the days that followed.</i>

1062
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,930
<i>I even looked in him for all the things</i>

1063
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,390
<i>you had found hateful, George,</i>

1064
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:17,650
<i>and I looked in vain.</i>

1065
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,690
<i>They weren't there.</i>

1066
01:02:20,980 --> 01:02:24,990
<i>All I could find was kindness, gentleness,</i>

1067
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,030
<i>and appreciation for the little I gave.</i>

1068
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,710
What are you clucking about?

1069
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,630
Hotel service,
very bad, very dusty.

1070
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,750
Well, you've done
all the dusting up here.

1071
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,170
Finish it up and get out, will you?

1072
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,590
Yes, sir, all finished.

1073
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:49,600
Wait a minute.

1074
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,720
Chang?

1075
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,510
Yes, sir?

1076
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,060
I wanna give you a bit of advice.

1077
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,350
If you ever fall in love,

1078
01:02:58,190 --> 01:02:59,860
admit it to yourself right away.

1079
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,820
Don't wait until it's almost too late.

1080
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:06,240
Oh, that could not happen to Chang.

1081
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:09,700
Why not?

1082
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,660
Haven't you ever been in love?

1083
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:15,250
Oh yes, in love many times,

1084
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,290
once with girl.

1085
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,420
Hurt too much.

1086
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,170
Now, Chang fall in love
only with roast duck,

1087
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:26,550
weekly paycheck, riding streetcars,

1088
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:28,510
and going to movies.

1089
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:31,850
It's a sound idea.

1090
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:33,850
Only it won't help me any.

1091
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,640
Confucius have many helpful word

1092
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:39,690
for people in all kind
of trouble, except love.

1093
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,770
For them, he have only sympathy.

1094
01:03:45,070 --> 01:03:48,280
Chang would not like to be
in love with one so lovely

1095
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:52,030
and so good, as her face
show this one to be.

1096
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,030
Why?

1097
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,750
The better she is, the harder to lose.

1098
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,370
What makes you think I lost her?

1099
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:03,380
Someday, everybody lose everybody.

1100
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:08,800
That is why Chang never fall
in love with girl again.

1101
01:04:09,970 --> 01:04:13,260
If she mean all the world
to you and you lose her,

1102
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,930
then you have lost the whole world.

1103
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,860
If she mean more than life
to you and you lose her,

1104
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,190
then you have lost all of life.

1105
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:34,660
But if she mean more than your soul to you

1106
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:35,990
and you lose her,

1107
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,920
then you have lost your own soul.

1108
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:49,420
Confucius say that?

1109
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:51,840
Maybe Confucius.

1110
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,470
Maybe Walter Winchell.

1111
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,930
Chang remember only the words.

1112
01:05:00,270 --> 01:05:01,270
I go.

1113
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:03,020
Oh, I'll get it.

1114
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,190
Hi, neighbor.

1115
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,610
Hello, Helene.

1116
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:23,210
Confucius would be much confused.

1117
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:27,590
You shouldn't have come today.

1118
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,090
I'm in a stinkin' mood.

1119
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:30,460
Good, I'll get stinking with you.

1120
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,300
I don't mean drunk.

1121
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,630
- Oh.
- Just don't feel like

1122
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,680
entertaining anybody.

1123
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,600
Well, then I'll entertain you.

1124
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,760
Come on.

1125
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,890
Tell the neighbor lady what
my big baby's sulking about.

1126
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,730
I'm not sulking.

1127
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,440
I just feel like being alone.

1128
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:46,730
Can't you understand that?

1129
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,110
Ooh, you really are in a nasty mood.

1130
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:52,610
But I don't mind.

1131
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:00,540
Oh?

1132
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:09,210
So this is the reason my picture stays

1133
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,590
in the desk drawer, hmm?

1134
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:11,420
Don't be silly.

1135
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:12,920
That's only a girl I knew a long time ago.

1136
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:13,880
Don't you be silly.

1137
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,640
I read the social columns as
well as the funnies, dear.

1138
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,800
This picture isn't as good
as the one in the papers

1139
01:06:19,810 --> 01:06:21,220
when she married your brother.

1140
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,930
All right, so she's my brother's wife.

1141
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:24,390
What's wrong with that?

1142
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:27,850
"For George, with all my love."

1143
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,980
A very chummy family, aren't you?

1144
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:36,910
Get outta here, your little
tramp, before I throw you out.

1145
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,530
I'll go,

1146
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:40,660
and I'll remember what you called me, too.

1147
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,370
And while you're at it,
remember not to come back.

1148
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,790
George, I didn't mean anything.

1149
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:50,960
I want to stay.

1150
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:51,960
Well, I meant it.

1151
01:06:53,010 --> 01:06:54,460
Darling, please try to understand.

1152
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,510
I was jealous, and, well,

1153
01:06:57,470 --> 01:07:00,180
you're the one guy that
never called me a tramp.

1154
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,010
Well, beat it if you
don't wanna hear it again

1155
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,020
from the same guy.

1156
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,810
Oh, you'll be sorry for this, George.

1157
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,090
Do you wish to see me?

1158
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:41,970
Yes.

1159
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,100
Helene Anderson's the name.

1160
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:49,690
I don't believe we've met before.

1161
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:51,020
No, we haven't.

1162
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:52,560
But we have a, a mutual friend,

1163
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,650
and I thought we should know each other.

1164
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:55,690
A mutual friend?

1165
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,030
Yeah.

1166
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:01,280
Georgie.

1167
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:04,740
Georgie?

1168
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:06,700
You mean George MacAllister?

1169
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:08,460
I don't mean George Washington.

1170
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,920
Perhaps, Ms. Anderson,
you'd better tell me

1171
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,210
just why you're here.

1172
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:14,300
Sure, why not?

1173
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:22,010
I just came up to tell you
that Georgie is all yours,

1174
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,310
or, or didn't you know we'd
been dividing him up to now?

1175
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,720
I still don't know what you mean.

1176
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:29,350
Oh, snap out of it.

1177
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:31,310
I know you're French, but
you've got a pretty firm grip

1178
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,310
on this country's language.

1179
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,070
It's too bad you don't
know more about the men.

1180
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,440
He's a stinker, and you can have him.

1181
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:39,440
Is that plain?

1182
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:44,490
George is my husband's half-brother.

1183
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:46,740
I'm not interested in his personal life.

1184
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,500
Half-brother, that's all, hmm?

1185
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,500
Yes.

1186
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:55,750
"For George, with
all my love, Carlotta."

1187
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,460
Oh, and I hope you forgive me,

1188
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:01,010
I, I broke the glass in the picture.

1189
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:03,260
Oh.

1190
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,640
So this is blackmail then?

1191
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,100
No, it isn't blackmail.

1192
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:11,060
It's just that I want to
see a few other people

1193
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:12,850
get what's coming to them for a change,

1194
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,900
- and I intend to do it, too.
- Carlotta?

1195
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:18,480
Oh, I'm sorry, darling, I
didn't know you had company.

1196
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,230
That's all right, dear.

1197
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,650
This is Ms. Anderson, my husband.

1198
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:24,030
How do you do, Mr. MacAllister?

1199
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:25,280
How do you do?

1200
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,030
She, Helene just learned
where I was living, and-

1201
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,790
I figured she'd be very happy to see me.

1202
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:32,120
An old friend, eh?

1203
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,670
Fine.

1204
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,330
Are you a nurse too, Ms. Anderson?

1205
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,830
Why-

1206
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:38,540
You might say that

1207
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:42,260
we've taken care of the same
patients, hmm, Carlotta?

1208
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:45,340
- Yes.
- Good.

1209
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,720
I wish more of her friends would come...

1210
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,560
What's the matter darling?

1211
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,850
Aren't you feeling well?

1212
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:51,430
- You look pale.
- Pale?

1213
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,310
Oh, it's your imagination, dear.

1214
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:54,940
Just the same, I
better have Dr. Mitchell

1215
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,650
take a look at you the
next time he's here.

1216
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,230
Well, I imagine you
girls have a great deal

1217
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,150
to talk about, so-

1218
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:01,150
Yes.

1219
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,280
Yes, I could talk all day.

1220
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,370
Well, I'll be running along then.

1221
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:08,370
Good bye, dear.

1222
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:11,620
Nice meeting you, Ms. Anderson.

1223
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,580
Come see Carlotta again real soon.

1224
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,580
Please do.

1225
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,300
Well, I, I guess I'll
be running along, too.

1226
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,800
Ms. Anderson?

1227
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:30,010
Yes?

1228
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,390
Thank you.

1229
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,110
For telling you about George?

1230
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,110
No.

1231
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,070
Oh, for not telling him?

1232
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,740
Well, why should I?

1233
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,400
He's a nice guy.

1234
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,160
You ought to take good care of him.

1235
01:10:51,370 --> 01:10:53,080
Well, happy, happy.

1236
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,720
<i>Hello?</i>

1237
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,140
- Hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

1238
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,060
<i>You know who this is?</i>

1239
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,230
- Yes.
<i>- Celia!</i>

1240
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:17,940
Just a minute.

1241
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:23,230
Yes, George.

1242
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:24,070
What do you want?

1243
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,990
Where have you been?

1244
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,650
Why haven't you talked to me?

1245
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:28,650
Why haven't you been in town?

1246
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:31,120
I, I've been busy.

1247
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:32,660
This is dangerous and foolish.

1248
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,240
I know it's dangerous,
but I've gotta talk to you.

1249
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,250
This is important.

1250
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,250
We're in trouble.

1251
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,210
You must, Carlotta.

1252
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:42,210
It's important.

1253
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:45,210
Why not this afternoon?

1254
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,420
No, it's impossible.

1255
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,420
No, I can't.

1256
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:50,260
<i>Celia!</i>

1257
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,090
I can't talk anymore.

1258
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:53,600
All right, I'll try.

1259
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,850
Yes.

1260
01:11:54,850 --> 01:11:56,890
Yes, tomorrow afternoon.

1261
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:58,140
Yes.

1262
01:11:58,190 --> 01:11:59,190
All right.

1263
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,940
I promise.

1264
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:12,740
You didn't
ask her for the dough.

1265
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:13,740
Over the phone?

1266
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,330
Don't be stupid.

1267
01:12:16,330 --> 01:12:18,790
Suppose she can't get the money, or won't.

1268
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:21,580
She can and she will for you.

1269
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:25,050
Especially when she knows
how important it is.

1270
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,380
Why do you have to have it now?

1271
01:12:29,470 --> 01:12:30,970
Why can't you wait?

1272
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:31,970
It's Helene.

1273
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,300
All of a sudden, she's changed.

1274
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:36,970
She came back to me.

1275
01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:39,020
Do you understand that?

1276
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,940
I told her I was coming into some dough,

1277
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,480
an inheritance, I said it was.

1278
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,900
She agreed to marry me
right away tomorrow.

1279
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:48,610
Then we take off on our honeymoon.

1280
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,910
You better get me that
dough, George, fast.

1281
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:56,950
I'll see what I can do.

1282
01:12:56,950 --> 01:12:58,740
I can't promise anything.

1283
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:02,620
Well, maybe I better contact her direct.

1284
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:03,620
Wait!

1285
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,250
I'll get it.

1286
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:12,890
Okay, George.

1287
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:19,020
<i>Your call upset me,</i>

1288
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,810
<i>but I was certain your plea of trouble</i>

1289
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:22,350
<i>was simply an excuse to see me.</i>

1290
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:25,980
<i>I had no intention of keeping my promise</i>

1291
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,320
<i>to visit your apartment the
next day, Christmas Day.</i>

1292
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,570
<i>I was determined not to see you again.</i>

1293
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,990
<i>I never wanted to.</i>

1294
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:38,080
Come in.

1295
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,910
Mm, how pretty you look.

1296
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,750
Merry Christmas, darling.

1297
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:48,590
It's not Christmas yet, silly.

1298
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,760
It is for you.

1299
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:52,470
I wanna give you your present.

1300
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,220
But why don't
you put it under the tree?

1301
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:56,930
I can't wrap packages,
especially this one.

1302
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:58,930
Henry?

1303
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:06,850
Henry!

1304
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,030
Barry, you remembered!

1305
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,160
Oh, he's a darling!

1306
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,120
He seems to think the same about you.

1307
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,120
Oh, another thing, darling.

1308
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:23,040
I, I invited George out for
our little Christmas Eve party.

1309
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:26,290
- George?
- He called me at the office,

1310
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:28,790
seemed kind of lonesome, so
being Christmas and everything,

1311
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:29,790
I asked him out.

1312
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:40,970
Merry Xmas, mm-hmm.

1313
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:42,850
And that's a fact.

1314
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,260
Thanks.

1315
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,020
I know you play, Reverend McDonald.

1316
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,730
You must have a number
that'd be appropriate.

1317
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:27,520
I sure have, and it'll be a pleasure.

1318
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,350
Good.

1319
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:58,380
You were about to ask your
wife to dance, I presume?

1320
01:15:58,380 --> 01:15:59,220
I was?

1321
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,340
Uh, I mean, I was.

1322
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,180
Excuse me.

1323
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:19,860
Aunt Maggie?

1324
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:29,080
Merry Christmas, George.

1325
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:31,790
Be a merrier Christmas if you
let me dance with your wife.

1326
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:33,250
Aunt Maggie steps on my feet.

1327
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:35,000
You're so gallant, George.

1328
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,130
You can step on my feet
for a while, darling.

1329
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,270
You've been avoiding me all evening.

1330
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:52,940
I, I couldn't help it.

1331
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,520
Carlotta, I've gotta talk to you.

1332
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:57,780
But not here.

1333
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,280
All right then.

1334
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,820
Up there.

1335
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:22,930
No, don't, please.

1336
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,180
No one can see us here.

1337
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:27,350
You said you wanted to talk to me,

1338
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,810
that there was trouble.

1339
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,180
What, what kind of trouble?

1340
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,560
We're being blackmailed.

1341
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:37,190
Blackmailed?

1342
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:38,440
By who?

1343
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:40,030
Oh, by a guy by the
name of Bernie Hicks.

1344
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,110
You wouldn't know him.

1345
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,950
He saw you coming to my
apartment a couple of times,

1346
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:45,950
started checking.

1347
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:48,330
Checking?

1348
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,160
When?

1349
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,830
Oh, long time ago.

1350
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:55,210
I thought I could handle it.

1351
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:56,460
I didn't wanna worry you.

1352
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,420
I knew it'd be harder
for you to stay out here

1353
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:00,380
if you thought someone was watching us.

1354
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:03,260
Then why tell me now?

1355
01:18:05,470 --> 01:18:07,220
Because we are whipped, Carlotta.

1356
01:18:09,010 --> 01:18:11,720
Can't you see, when that
blackmailer learned our plan,

1357
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:12,980
we no longer had a plan.

1358
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:16,730
Oh, I've lost the money, that I know.

1359
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:22,570
But I don't wanna lose you too.

1360
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,410
What do you want me to do?

1361
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:29,490
Leave here tonight, now.

1362
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:31,160
Leave here?

1363
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,160
Why, I...

1364
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,210
I can't.

1365
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:37,250
Why can't you?

1366
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:40,670
Are you trying to tell me you love Barry?

1367
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:45,340
Don't you wanna come back to me?

1368
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:49,220
He's wonderful to me.

1369
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:51,390
I, I won't hurt him.

1370
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,140
Maybe you won't, but I might.

1371
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:56,690
You're mine, you belong to me,

1372
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:58,600
and you're going to come back to me,

1373
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:00,270
no matter what it takes.

1374
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,320
You understand?

1375
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,030
Well, what about it?

1376
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,950
I'll, let me think.

1377
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,240
Oh, there you are.

1378
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,580
Darling, some of the guests are leaving.

1379
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,910
I know you'd wanna say good night.

1380
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:17,540
Yes, yes, of course.

1381
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:19,420
George was just saying good night, too.

1382
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:20,250
Oh, nonsense.

1383
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,340
You're staying over for breakfast with us,

1384
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,540
aren't you, old man?

1385
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,550
Sure, sure.

1386
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,800
I was afraid you weren't
gonna ask me for a moment.

1387
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:35,720
<i>I couldn't
think of going to sleep.</i>

1388
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:38,770
<i>I knew the thoughts that
were going through your head,</i>

1389
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:41,150
<i>and I was afraid of what
you might do to Barry.</i>

1390
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:45,190
<i>The last vestige of my regard for you died</i>

1391
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:46,990
<i>when you told me of the blackmailer,</i>

1392
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,320
<i>for you were the only blackmailer, George.</i>

1393
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:55,040
<i>You were trying to blackmail
me into returning to you.</i>

1394
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:58,040
<i>Your words kept hammering in my head.</i>

1395
01:19:58,040 --> 01:20:00,460
<i>Maybe you won't, but I might.</i>

1396
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:02,840
<i>You're mine, you belong to me,</i>

1397
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:03,920
<i>and you're going to come back to me,</i>

1398
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:05,590
<i>no matter what it takes.</i>

1399
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,510
<i>You understand?</i>

1400
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,130
Why aren't you asleep?

1401
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:51,970
Because I'm not sleepy.

1402
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:54,390
Why aren't you asleep?

1403
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,020
Oh, I know you.

1404
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:03,650
You couldn't without kissing
little Georgie good night.

1405
01:21:05,020 --> 01:21:06,020
I...

1406
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:09,030
I was nervous and worried.

1407
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,030
And you had to kiss little
Georgie good night, didn't you?

1408
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,950
Yes, yes, that too.

1409
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:20,330
George, do you still
carry that gun with you?

1410
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,620
My little baby?

1411
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:23,620
Why, sure.

1412
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,170
Every place I go.

1413
01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:29,510
Let me have it.

1414
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,510
Why?

1415
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,550
I'd like to keep it for you.

1416
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:34,550
Oh, mm-mm.

1417
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:37,600
I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

1418
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,430
Really, I will.

1419
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:39,430
Ooh.

1420
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:43,730
You worried about Barry?

1421
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:51,150
I, I just don't want anything
to happen to either of you.

1422
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,280
You're in love with him, aren't you?

1423
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,200
Oh, George, why don't you go to bed?

1424
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:03,790
I want a straight answer.

1425
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:07,340
Are you in love with him?

1426
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:11,420
Well?

1427
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,010
No.

1428
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:16,010
No, George.

1429
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:19,390
That's good.

1430
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,180
Because if you had
fallen in love with him,

1431
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:27,310
I don't think baby here
would like it very much.

1432
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:31,780
Oh, but it's silly of me to think

1433
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:34,400
that you could fall in
love with anybody else.

1434
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,200
There's no one quite like Georgie.

1435
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:38,830
Don't drink anymore, George.

1436
01:22:39,910 --> 01:22:40,950
Please go to bed.

1437
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,330
You do wanna come back, don't you?

1438
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:15,570
Sure you do.

1439
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:03,990
<i>The next morning,
my decision had been made.</i>

1440
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:06,330
<i>I suddenly realized
that you would kill him</i>

1441
01:24:06,330 --> 01:24:07,710
<i>before you would give me up.</i>

1442
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:12,250
<i>But I was returning to you
without my heart and soul.</i>

1443
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:17,170
<i>I waited until Barry left and
then wrote him a short note.</i>

1444
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:22,680
<i>I couldn't tell him very
much, certainly not the truth,</i>

1445
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:26,010
<i>not after he had said-</i>

1446
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,220
<i>You're such a good little girl,</i>

1447
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:28,480
<i>you probably wanna tell me about the time</i>

1448
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,850
<i>you held hands with the neighbor boy.</i>

1449
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:31,850
<i>But don't do it.</i>

1450
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,860
<i>Oh, I, I know it may sound funny to you,</i>

1451
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,900
<i>but, well, even that,</i>

1452
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,530
<i>just don't do it.</i>

1453
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:43,780
<i>And so, I blamed my own weakness</i>

1454
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,540
<i>as a person unable to find happiness,</i>

1455
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,910
<i>and I asked him to forgive
me for running away.</i>

1456
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:55,670
For he is such a good man, Father.

1457
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:03,390
You understand why I must do this to him.

1458
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:09,020
Comfort him, and make him strong and well.

1459
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,190
And bless him, Father.

1460
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,440
Bless him every minute of every day.

1461
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,030
And dear Father,

1462
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,750
help me just a little bit, too.

1463
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:37,920
Please.

1464
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:42,920
Please?

1465
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,890
Amen.

1466
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,640
That was a lovely prayer, Carlotta.

1467
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:58,650
Dr. Mitchell, I, I
didn't know you were here.

1468
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,530
Forgive me.

1469
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:03,860
I started to speak and then
I didn't want to interrupt.

1470
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,780
But how do you happen to be in here?

1471
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:09,160
Oh, to tell the truth,
I often sit in here

1472
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,830
for a moment when I'm out this way.

1473
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:14,580
Nice quiet place to write prescriptions.

1474
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:16,670
Remember my Latin better in church.

1475
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,670
Oh, well, I'll leave you alone.

1476
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:20,670
No.

1477
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:22,880
Sit down a minute, please.

1478
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,140
I was going to the house.

1479
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,180
I wanted to talk to you about Barry.

1480
01:26:34,350 --> 01:26:35,440
He isn't worse?

1481
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,440
No.

1482
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:40,900
You must've prayed for him
many times before, Carlotta,

1483
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:42,940
because he's much better.

1484
01:26:42,940 --> 01:26:43,940
Much better.

1485
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,240
I'm so glad, Dr. Mitchell.

1486
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:48,240
Are you?

1487
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:51,990
Of course I am.

1488
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:54,080
Well, that's funny,

1489
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:57,460
because when you were praying
up there a minute ago,

1490
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,170
I almost got the impression

1491
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:03,340
you were leaving him, going away.

1492
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,760
Why, Carlotta?

1493
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:06,380
I thought you were happy here.

1494
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,090
I thought you meant this marriage.

1495
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:13,180
There are reasons, Dr. Mitchell, I...

1496
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,640
You don't know.

1497
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:16,560
I can't tell you.

1498
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,060
I know you've done
wonders for your husband.

1499
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,940
What else don't I know?

1500
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:27,030
Dr. Mitchell, I for many years,

1501
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:29,820
George and I-

1502
01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:32,370
I know, I know about you and George.

1503
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,620
You do?

1504
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,250
Quite a while.

1505
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:39,880
A doctor has to know a bit
about his favorite nurse.

1506
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:43,670
But, but why didn't
you say anything before?

1507
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:44,710
Why?

1508
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:46,090
I considered it.

1509
01:27:46,090 --> 01:27:47,090
Yes.

1510
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,470
I was just about to speak up

1511
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:53,260
when I looked at Barry's face

1512
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:56,850
and I realized he had found
the medicine he needed.

1513
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:02,650
And, well, I, I love Barry as my own son.

1514
01:28:04,150 --> 01:28:07,650
Dr. Mitchell, I, I'm so confused.

1515
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:09,400
You see, I love him, too.

1516
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:11,410
Then why are you going back to George?

1517
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:13,870
He's desperate.

1518
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,250
I'm afraid of what he might do to Barry.

1519
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:19,330
Did he threaten you?

1520
01:28:20,370 --> 01:28:21,370
Yes.

1521
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:25,670
Ah, he'd carry it out, too.

1522
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:29,340
Well, that leaves just
one thing for you to do.

1523
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:31,640
What?

1524
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,390
Uncle Joe's going to
recommend a sea voyage

1525
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:36,720
for his patient with his wife.

1526
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:40,190
Take him away, Carlotta,
for six months, a year,

1527
01:28:40,190 --> 01:28:42,350
10 years, if he's having fun.

1528
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,770
The Queen Elizabeth sails New Year's Eve.

1529
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:45,770
Be on it.

1530
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:48,110
With Barry?

1531
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:50,860
Is he well enough?

1532
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:51,860
For his honeymoon?

1533
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,910
Under your care, it looks as though

1534
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:56,370
he'll outlive the lot of us.

1535
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,580
Thank you.

1536
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:04,540
Thank you,

1537
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:05,460
Uncle Joe.

1538
01:29:26,610 --> 01:29:28,150
What are you doing here?

1539
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:32,110
I was merely making sure that
Celia had cleaned properly.

1540
01:29:33,070 --> 01:29:35,660
I'm taking care of Barry's room.

1541
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:38,240
I thought perhaps you were leaving.

1542
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,330
I was never more sure that I'm staying.

1543
01:29:56,470 --> 01:30:00,180
<i>Not until it was burning
did my happiness return,</i>

1544
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,640
<i>and even then, it was happiness
overshadowed by foreboding.</i>

1545
01:30:04,850 --> 01:30:06,520
<i>There was reason for foreboding.</i>

1546
01:30:07,690 --> 01:30:09,570
<i>Barry told me later that
you wanted to see him</i>

1547
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,690
<i>in his New York apartment
before we sailed,</i>

1548
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:14,860
<i>and that he had agreed to meet you alone.</i>

1549
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:17,830
<i>Then I knew I must burn this letter.</i>

1550
01:30:18,990 --> 01:30:20,620
<i>I'm pleading for my husband's life</i>

1551
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,040
<i>and our happiness, George.</i>

1552
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:26,290
But even as I write, I seem
to know it will do no good.

1553
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:29,590
There's a great fear in
me of what will happen

1554
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:30,920
when you and Barry meet.

1555
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:35,720
I beg of you, have mercy, George.

1556
01:30:39,180 --> 01:30:41,100
Late, kitten.

1557
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:42,220
A little late.

1558
01:30:53,240 --> 01:30:54,820
You all right, Mr. MacAllister?

1559
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:55,990
Why you call police?

1560
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:56,820
Homicide Bureau.

1561
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:59,410
I expected you, but not so soon.

1562
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:00,240
He's hurt.

1563
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,080
- We should call doctor.
- No.

1564
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,120
I'm all right.

1565
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,540
We, uh, found that guy.

1566
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,540
You were right.

1567
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:06,580
He is quite dead.

1568
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:08,540
Hey.

1569
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:09,380
Can't you see?

1570
01:31:09,380 --> 01:31:10,380
He's sick.

1571
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:15,550
You're not kidding.

1572
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:18,550
He's sick, all right.

1573
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:20,260
Got a bullet hole clean through him.

1574
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:21,430
If you wanna ask him any questions,

1575
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:23,520
you better do it here and fast.

1576
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,020
I'll call a doctor and an ambulance.

1577
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:28,900
Please, Mr. MacAllister,
you'll be all right.

1578
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:31,560
You tear your coat.

1579
01:31:31,570 --> 01:31:32,570
Ah, shut up.

1580
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:34,990
Try to remember, MacAllister.

1581
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:39,070
I hate to make you talk now,
but some things we gotta know.

1582
01:31:39,070 --> 01:31:40,570
Why did you kill him?

1583
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:41,370
What was the fight about?

1584
01:31:41,410 --> 01:31:43,160
- What happened?
- Homicide.

1585
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:46,250
Send a doctor and an ambulance
over to 150 West 59th.

1586
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,620
Yeah, and don't spare the horses.

1587
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:49,960
Uh, try to think,
MacAllister, what happened?

1588
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:55,260
What happened?

1589
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:03,930
I tore my coat.

1590
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,480
<i>Yes, I tore my coat.</i>

1591
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:17,190
<i>Although the tear in the
coat had nothing to do</i>

1592
01:32:17,190 --> 01:32:18,650
<i>with my errand there tonight.</i>

1593
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:21,740
<i>I wasn't thinking about anything</i>

1594
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:24,370
<i>when I stepped into that corridor</i>

1595
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:26,620
<i>except the job I had come there to do.</i>

1596
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,580
<i>He'd crossed me for the last time.</i>

1597
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,160
Nice layout.

1598
01:33:06,910 --> 01:33:09,080
I got it for Helene.

1599
01:33:09,080 --> 01:33:11,080
You're giving me the dough to pay for it.

1600
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,080
Money?

1601
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:13,830
I didn't bring any.

1602
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,300
I told you tonight was the deadline.

1603
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,300
I wasn't kidding.

1604
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:22,300
I know, pal.

1605
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,760
But things have happened.

1606
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:27,850
Our plans have changed a bit.

1607
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,390
My sense of humor ain't so good tonight.

1608
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,560
My plans haven't changed.

1609
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:34,440
Now, quit stalling.

1610
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,070
Give me the money now.

1611
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,530
I'll have to swim for it.

1612
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,780
Mrs. MacAllister and her
husband are sailing tonight

1613
01:33:40,780 --> 01:33:42,610
on the Queen Elizabeth.

1614
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:44,660
They'll be gone a long, long time.

1615
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,540
Oh.

1616
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:56,040
Where are you going?

1617
01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:59,380
To the docks to wish 'em bon voyage.

1618
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:07,510
Bon voyage, Ernie.

1619
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,000
Mr. MacAllister?

1620
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Mr. Boss?

1621
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:41,250
- Please.
- Yeah, snap out of it.

1622
01:34:41,260 --> 01:34:42,920
I got a couple of more questions.

1623
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:53,640
Don't, he's...

1624
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:59,860
Mr. MacAllister's answering
questions elsewhere now.

1625
01:35:58,750 --> 01:35:59,920
Excuse me, please.

1626
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,380
Mr. and Mrs. MacAllister?

1627
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,590
- Yes?
- Telegram, sir.

1628
01:36:02,590 --> 01:36:03,710
Oh, thank you.

1629
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:06,880
