3
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Bowto the board!
- This is the boy.

4
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Born here in the workhouse.
Moved to the parish farm.

5
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,500
Nine years old today.
Time to be moved back here.

6
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,500
What's your name, boy?

7
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,100
Oliver Twist.
- Boy! Listen to me!

8
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,100
You knowyou are an orphan, l suppose?
- What's that?

9
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,100
You knowyou've got no father or mother
and that you were brought up...

10
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,200
by the parish, don't you?
- What are you crying for?

11
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,400
l hope you say your prayers every night?
Pray for those who feed you...

12
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,300
and take care of you, like a...
like a Christian?

13
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, you have come here to be educated...
and to be taught a useful trade.

14
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
(Music)

15
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Learn from the boy next to you.
Learn to pick out the oakum.

16
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,100
What's oakum, sir?
- Stop asking so many questions!

17
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,600
Oakums are fibres you unpick
from the old rope then it's used again...

18
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,700
for ships of Her Majesty's Navy.
You're serving your country.

19
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Now get on with it!

20
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
(Music)

21
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,500
Tom, give it a rest,
we're trying to sleep!

22
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,700
Can't sleep! Too hungry!
- We're all hungry.

23
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,300
Yes, but l'm frightened.
- Frightened? Why?

24
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,400
Why? l'm so hungry l'm frightened
l'll eat the lad that sleeps next to me.

25
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,600
Oh Lord God, all the blessings
of this generous and bountiful meal...

26
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,700
that you has placed before us,
we give thanks. Amen.

27
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,300
(All)
Amen!

28
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,700
(Music)

29
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,700
Please, sir, l want some more.

30
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,000
What?
- Please, sir, l want some more.

31
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,800
Fetch the Beadle!

32
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,000
Begging your pardon, sir.

33
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

34
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,700
For more?

35
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,900
Do l understand that he asked for more
after he had eaten his supper?

36
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
He did, sir.

37
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,200
That boy will be hanged.

38
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,100
Woah.

39
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,300
L5 and a boy? Woah, woah!

40
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,400
When l says woah, it means woah!

41
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,100
Healthy apprentice...

42
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,000
for L5!

43
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,300
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.
- Yes, young boys have been smothered...

44
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,800
in chimneys before now.
- That's because they damp the straw...

45
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,600
before they light it in the chimney
to make them come out again.

46
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,200
Damp strawmakes smoke,
smoke sends the boy to sleep...

47
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,800
and that's what he wants.
Boys are very lazy, gentlemen,

48
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,200
but there's nothing like a good blaze
to make them come out in a run.

49
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
When they get stuck in the chimney...

50
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,900
roasting their feet makes 'em struggle
to extricate themselves. Yeah!

51
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,200
l suppose he's fond of chimney sweeping.
- He dotes on it, Your Worship.

52
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,200
Oh well, l will sign the indentures
to make him...

53
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mr... Mr Garmfield's apprentice.

54
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,100
My boy, my boy!

55
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,900
You look pale and alarmed.
What's the matter?

56
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,400
Please, sir, please, sir...
- What is it, my boy?

57
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,400
Please, sir, don't... don't...

58
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
Go on my boy, don't what?
- Please don't send me away...

59
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,600
with this dreadful man, sir.
- Oh of all the designing artfuls...

60
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,100
that l've ever seen!
- Hold your tongue, Beadle!

61
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Did Your Worship speak to me?
- Yes, hold your tongue.

62
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We refuse to sanction these indentures.

63
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Take the boy away and treat him kindly.

64
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,600
He seems to want it.

65
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,900
l have just taken the measures of the
two women that died last night, Mr Bumble.

66
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You'll make your fortune, Mr Sowerberry.
- Oh you think so?

67
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
The prices allowed, are very small.
- So are the coffins.

68
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,200
By the way, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

69
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,300
Liberal terms, Mr Sowerberry,
liberal terms!

70
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,900
As you are to meet your newmaster,
pull that cap off your eyes.

71
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,100
Hold your head up, sir.

72
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,500
Dry your eyes, sir.

73
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Ah ha! ls that you, Bumble?
- Well, what else, Mr Sowerberry?

74
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,800
l brought the orphan, Oliver Twist

75
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,100
So this is the orphan. is it?
Mrs Sowerberry, will you have...

76
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,700
the goodness to come here a moment,
my dear?

77
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,900
Oliver Twist! How comes an orphan
to have a name at all?

78
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
l invented it. - You, Mr Bumple?
Aye, Mr Sowerberry.

79
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,600
l name all our foundlings
in alphabetical order.

80
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,600
The last was S, Swibble l named him.

81
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,600
This was a T, Twist l named him.

82
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
Next one as comes will be Unwin,
and the next Wilkins,

83
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,500
and l've got names ready all through
the alphabet, right up to Z.

84
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
You're quite a literary character, sir.
- Well, well.

85
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Prhaps l may be.
- Mrs Sowerberry, this is the orphan...

86
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,000
from the workhouse.

87
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,900
Dear me, he's very small!
- But he'll grow, Mrs Sowerberry.

88
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,900
Yes, l dare say he will,
on our food and drink!

89
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Workhouse boys always cost more
to take than they're worth!

90
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,000
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

91
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,700
Here, Charlotte, give this boy some
of those cold bits...

92
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,700
that were put by for the dog.

93
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,300
You don't mind sleeping among the coffins,
l suppose? Well, it doesn't matter...

94
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,200
if you do or don't,
you can't sleep anywhere else.

95
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
(Music)

96
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,300
(Noah)
Open the door, will you?

97
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,100
You the newboy?
- Yes, sir.

98
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,200
How old are you?
- 10, sir.

99
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,000
l beg your pardon, sir, did you knock?
- l kicked.

100
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,500
Did you want a coffin, sir?
- You don't knowwho l am, l suppose?

101
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
No, sir.
- l'm Mr Noah Claypole,

102
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,500
and you're under me.
So take down the shutters!

103
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,200
l saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

104
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,900
ln the corner with you
and be quick about it.

105
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,400
They want you to mind the shop.
Do you hear?

106
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Do you hear, workhouse? ln the corner!
- Oh go on, Noah! Let the boy alone.

107
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,100
They am alone.
Why everybody's let him alone?

108
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,300
His mother, father and all his relations
has let him alone.

109
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,000
So he needs someone who don't!

110
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Supper! Aren't you done yet?

111
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:07,700
l've never known such an idle boy!
Get down them stairs!

112
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,500
Mr Sowerberry! Supper.

113
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,900
l've had a thought, my dear.
- Had a thought, you want to be careful,

114
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,700
Mr Sowerberry, you'll get brain fever!
- lt's about young Twist.

115
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:23,200
What about him?
- Avery good-looking boy.

116
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,100
He will be! He eats enough!
- There's an expression of melancholy...

117
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,800
in his face, my dear,
he would make a delightful mute, my love.

118
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,200
l don't mean a regular mute
to attend grown-up funerals, my dear,

119
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,600
but only for children's practice.

120
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,700
Look at him. Look at him!

121
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,000
Aworkhouse boy and a sneak!
Look at him!

122
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,600
Mark my words, l'll see him hung!
lt can't be too soon.

123
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,400
Workhouse, how's your mother?

124
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,900
She's dead.
- Oh. What did she die of, workhouse?

125
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Oh, you're going to cry, workhouse?

126
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,600
What set you off?
- Not you.

127
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,500
Not me, eh?
- No, not you.

128
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,200
And you'd better not say anything
about my mother.

129
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,500
Better not? About your mother?

130
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,300
Well, l'm very sorry and l pity you
very much, but you must know, workhouse,

131
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,000
your mother was a regular
right-down bad 'un.

132
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,700
What did you say?
- A regular right-down bad 'un.

133
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,700
lt's a good thing she died when she did
or she'd be hard-labouring...

134
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,000
or transported, or hung.
Which is most likely, isn't it, workhouse?

135
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,100
Help! He'll murder me!

136
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Help! Get off!
For God's sake, help me!

137
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,500
He's murdering me! Get off of me! Ow!
- Got him out! Out with him!

138
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
Get the door, Charlotte, shut him in!

139
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,300
Very violent indeed, sir.

140
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,700
And the Mrs said,
if Mr Bumble can spare the time,

141
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,100
then Mr Bumble's to flog him,
'cause the matter's out.

142
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,800
ln there!
- Oliver?

143
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,500
Let me out of here!
- Do you knowthis here voice, Oliver?

144
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Yes!
- Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

145
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,200
Ain't you trembling while l speak, sir?
- No!

146
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,300
He must be mad!
- lt's not madness, ma'am, it's meat!

147
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,300
Meat, ma'am, meat! You've over-fed him!
lf you'd kept this boy on gruel

148
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,100
this would never have happened.
- Dear, dear! This comes of being liberal.

149
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,300
What's all this?
- Oliver Twist has turned violent, sir.

150
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,900
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.
(Knocking)

151
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Nowthen, nowthen!
You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?

152
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,100
He called my mother names!
- Well, and what if he did,

153
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
you little ungrateful wretch!
She deserved what he said, and worse!

154
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,100
She didn't! lt's a lie!

155
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,300
Do something, Mr Sowerberry!
He called me a liar.

156
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,300
Do something!

157
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
(Dog's barking)

158
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
(Music)

159
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,700
l...

160
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,500
l beg your pardon, miss,
but would you be so kind...

161
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,500
Get off my land!
We don't want beggars here!

162
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Go on! Get off!
l'll put the dog on you!

163
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,300
l haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

164
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,200
Be careful, it's hot.

165
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,300
Seeing you gave me such a turn!

166
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,000
My eyes ain't what they were, but...

167
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,900
l just thought for a moment...

168
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Why are you on the road at all,
a little mite like you?

169
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,800
Where are you headed?
- London, ma'am.

170
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,700
London?

171
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
London?
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

172
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
(Music)

173
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,600
(Unintelligible)

174
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
(Music)

175
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Hello, my man! What's your game?

176
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,400
You're not from these parts.

177
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,200
Where are you from then?

178
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,600
l've been walking 7 days.
- 7 days?

179
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,000
Cor! l expect you want grub,

180
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,400
and you shall have it. l'm at a low
watermark myself just at the moment,

181
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,100
but l'll fork out and stump.
Come on, up with you, on your gins!

182
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,100
Bye the bye, my name is Jack Dawkins,
better known as the Artful Dodger.

183
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,800
Oliver Twist.

184
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,200
Why are you known as the Artful Dodger?

185
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,600
That's why.

186
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,900
Got any lodgings? Money?

187
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,300
l suppose you want some place
to sleep tonight, don't you?

188
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,700
(Music)

189
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,300
l suspect you were walking so long
to get away from the beak?

190
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,900
What's that mean?
- Don't you knowwhat a Beak is?

191
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,500
A bird's mouth, isn't it?
- You are green! A Beak's a magistrate.

192
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,800
Where've you been all your life?

193
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,900

There's two of you! Who's he?

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,500
This is him, Fagin,
my newfriend, Oliver Twist.

198
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,500
Well, well, Oliver Twist!

199
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
l hope l have the honour
of a more intimate acquaintance!

200
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,700
We're very glad to see you, Oliver. Very.
Dodger, take off the sausages...

201
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,700
and let's make a space at the table
for Oliver.

202
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,300
You're staring at the pocket
handkerchiefs, ain't you, my dear?

203
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,400
There's a good many of them, isn't there?
We just got them out ready for the wash.

Yes, Gawd almighty!

205
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,500
Hot!

206
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Nowthen, Oliver! What you must have
is a hot tin and water.

207

Warms the cockles. Hurry, drink it quick
'cause these gentleman wants the tumbler.

208
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:17,500
Such a nice lad! l have the feeling
he'll turn out a hard worker.

209
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,600
Yeah, a hard worker.

210
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,300
Oliver.

211
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,200
Oliver?

212
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,700
Clever dogs!

213
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,900
Clever dogs.

214
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,300
Ah, fine fellows.

215
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,400
Ah, fine fellows!

216
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,500
Fine fellows,

218
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,400
Fine fellows.

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,000
What do you watch me for? Why are you

220
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,300

221
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,400
l'm very sorry if l have disturbed you.
- Another way...

222
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Of course you were asleep, my dear.

223
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,500
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

224
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Did you see any of those pretty things?
- Yes, sir.

225
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,600
They... they're mine, Oliver,
my little property...

226
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,600
for my old age. lt's our secret.

227
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Do you understand, my dear?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,100
Can we go up now, sir?

229
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,300
Yeah!

230
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,600
l hope you've been at work this morning,
my dears! Good boys!

231
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,200
What you got, George?
- A couple of pocket books.

232
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,500
George, l don't know, George...

233
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,700
Not as heavy as they might be,
but very neat...

234
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,800
and nicely made.
lngenious workman, ain't 'e, Oliver?

235

236
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,700
Wipes!
- Wipes? Oh!

237
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,700
They're very good ones. Oh, very.

238
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,300
You haven't marked them well.

239
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,400
The marks should be picked out
with a needle. We'll teach Oliver...

240
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,900
howto do it. Shall us, Oliver?
- lf you please, sir.

241
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,900
You'd like to make pocket handkerchiefs
as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

242
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,600
Yes, if you're teaching me, sir.
- l never met anyone so green!

243
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,600
Nowthen boys! The game!

244
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
We're showing Oliver
howto make pocket handkerchiefs.

245
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,400
You'd like to play a game, wouldn't you?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
(Music)

247
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,100
What's the time, guv?
- Bedtime! 8 'o' clock.

248
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,900
Playing the game were we, Fagin?
- As is our custom, my dear.

249
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,500
He's new?. Who is he?
- Oh, this is Oliver.

250
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
Oliver, here's our very good friends
Beth and Nancy.

251
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,700
See, Dodger, you wanna learn from 'im!
He's got manners, 'e 'as.

252
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:11,400
A proper gentleman.
- We popped in through that cold inside.

253
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
As is your custom, my dear.
Charley!

254
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,600
Come on, Oliver, join us.
Or don't you sit with the common folk?

255
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:25,000
Nowyou want to be careful of this lot,
they'll have you picking pockets...

256
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,500
... cleaning out the marks,
just what we was teaching him, my dear?

257
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,500
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir?

258
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,600
You knowwho you're talking to, do you?
- What's your mother got to say...

259
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,600
about you being here, Oliver?
- l haven't got a mother. l'm an orphan.

260
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,600
You're in the right company then.

261
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,700
Come on, l'll teach you howto play.
lt's called Spec or Speculation.

262
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,800
Three cards each, and if the winner
turns up, it's trumps.

263
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,300
This is a pleasant life,
ain't it, my dear?

264
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,400
When l go out, sir?
- Soon.

265
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,900
Soon.

266
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,800
Let's see what you've learned.
Would you like that?

267
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,500
Oh yes, sir.

268
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,800
See if you can take this out...

269
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,000
without my feeling it.

270
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,800
ls it gone?

271
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:02,900
You're a clever boy, my dear!
l never saw a sharper lad.

272
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,000
Here's a shilling for you.

273
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:17,700
Make the Dodger and Charley your models.
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

274
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,000
He'll be a great man himself,
make you one too! You go on this way,

275
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,100
you'll be the greatest man of the time.
- Oh...

276
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,400
Thank you very much, sir.

277
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,700
(Music)

278
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,600
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir!
Stop, thieves!

279
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,600
Thief!

280
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,000
Stop him! Thief!! Stop, thief!

281
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,400
He didn't deserve it!
- Where's the gentleman?

282
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,000
There's the gentleman! ls this the boy?
- Yes, l'm afraid it is.

283
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,900
Afraid it is! Did you hear him?
- He's hurt himself...

284
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,900
Here, l did that, sir!
Hurt my knuckle against his mouth.

285
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,900
But l stopped him!
- Get up!

286
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,100
lt wasn't me, sir, it wasn't me!
- Oh course it wasn't, it never is!

287
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Now get up! - Don't hurt him!
Oh no, sir, l won't hurt him.

288
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:22,100
This way gentlemen.
- What's next?

289
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,500
That is my name and address, sir.
- Officer, who is this fellow?.

290
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:31,300
My name, sir, is Brown...
- Hold your tongue! What is this fellow...

291
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,200

- Oh no, he's not charged, Your Worship,

292
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,800
he appears against the boy.
- Before l'm sworn l must beg...

293
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,900
to say one word...
- Hold your tongue, sir!

294
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,400
l will not, sir!
- Hold your tongue this instant!

295
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:49,400
You're an insolent, impertinent fellow.
How dare you bully a magistrate!

296
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,400
Swear! l'll not hear another word.
- ''l do solemnly swear to tell the truth,

297
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,100
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help me God.''

298
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,500
Now, what's the charge against the boy?
Hold your tongue! Where is the policeman?

299
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,200
What is this? Are there any witnesses?
- None, Your Worship.

00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,300
The boy is ill.
- Oh yes, l dare say!

301
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,200
Come along you vagabond, none of your
tricks here. What's your name?

302
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,000
What's your name, you hardened scoundrel.
Officer, what's his name?

303
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:22,700
What's your name boy?
- ... some water...

304
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,400
He says his name is Sam Waters.
- Where does he live?

305
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,500
Anywhere he can, Your Worship.
- Stuff and nonsense!

306
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,600
Don't try to make a fool out of me!
- No, l think he really is ill...

307
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:40,100
l knowbetter, or my name's not Fang!
Stand away, Officer, he's shamming!

308
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:44,200
He stands committed for three months,
hard labour of course. Clear the office.

309
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,300
Stop, stop, stop, don't take him away!
- What is this, who is this?

310
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,400
Turn this man out!
- l will not be turned out. l will speak!

311
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,200
l sawit all! l own the bookshop.
l demand to be heard!

312
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,800
Well, what have you got to say?
- lt was not this boy!

313
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,300
Who was it then?
- The robbery was committed by two others

314
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,300
while the gentleman was reading. l saw
that this boy was perfectly amazed by it.

315
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,000
Why didn't you come before?
- l hadn't a soul to mind the shop.

316
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:17,700
Reading you say? A book l suppose?
- Yes, the very one he has in his hand.

317
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,600
Well, dear me l forgot all about it.
- Well, you're a nice one.

318
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,300
To prefer a charge
against an innocent boy!

319
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,700
l consider, sir, that you have obtained
that book under very suspicious,

320
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,700
disreputable circumstances. Bookseller,
do you want to press charges...

321
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,700
against this fellow?.
- Certainly not!

322
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,400
You may think yourself fortunate that the
owner of the book declines to prosecute.

323
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,700
The boy is discharged. Clear the office!
Clear the office! Clear the office!

324
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,400
Next case!
- Move along, sir, just move along!

325
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,300
There's a good gentlemen...

326
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:12,000
Call a coach. l'm sorry.

327
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,000
Got one, sir
- Thanks.

328
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,500
Will you drop me off?
- Of course!

329
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,900
lf you could just take his head, sir?
Where to, sir?

330
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,700
Pentonville.
- Pentonville.

331
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,500
Where is he? What's become of the boy?
Speak out or l'll throttle you..

332
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,500
The trags have got him.
Let go of me, will you?

333
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,000
Who pitched this here at me? Who done it?

334
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,400
Bullseye, come here you sneaking wally!

335
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
What are you stopping outside for?

336
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,500
Lay down!

337
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,800
What are you up to, Fagin?
You'll treating the boys again?

338
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,900
l wonder they don't murder you?
l would if l was them.

339
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,400
Don't speak so loud!
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

340
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,100
Give us a drink,
and mind you don't poison it!

341
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,200
Good stuff...
- So, Dodger, what's it all about?

342
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,100
The newboy. Come out with us
before he was rightly up to it.

343
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,300
Got nailed by the traps.
- You see, Bill, l'm afraid...

344
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,400
he may say something which will get us
into trouble.

345
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,800
You're blowed upon, Fagin, in a bad time!

346
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:00,800
And l'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game was up with us

347
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,900
it would come out rather worse for you
than it would for me, my dear.

348
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,900
There's only one thing for it,
someone's got to find out at the office...

349
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,900
what's being done to him.
Somebody's got to get hold of him somehow.

350
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:16,900
l ain't going in no police office!
- Ah, Harry, the very thing,

351
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,900
Beth will go, won't you my dear?
- l'm blessed if l will!

352
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,800
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?
- lt won't do.

353
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,600
There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.
- What do you mean by that?

354
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,600
Why you're just the very person for it.
Nobody knows anything about you!

355
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,200
And as l don't want them to neither,
it's rather more no than yes with me.

356
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,900
She'll go, Fagin.
- No, she won't, Fagin!

357
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,600
Can l help you, Miss?
- l'm looking for my little brother.

358
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,700
Nowwho would he be?
- Lovely little boy. Lovely manners.

359
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,200
Gentle as falling snow.
- We don't get many of those.

360
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,400
l think you'll be wanting Mr Fanscourt.

361
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,300
George. This here young lady is looking
for her brother. l think he's the one...

362
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,300
who fainted and managed to get away.
- Oh yeah, a gentleman took him away.

363
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,900
What gentleman? What gentleman?
- Well...

364
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
Lives in Pentonville l believe.

365
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,700
No wait, wait, wait.
His card's here somewhere.

366
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,700
Thank you, sir

367
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,700
(Music)

368
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,200
Mr Brownlow! Mr Brownlow!

369
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,700
(Music)

370
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:17,000
There's something in him
that touched my heart, Mrs Bedwin.

371
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,300
l can't explain it.
- l feel the same, sir.

372
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,700
Who is he? What is he?
You knownothing of him.

373
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:31,300
He had a fever. What of that?
Bad people have fever sometimes.

374
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,200
l knew a man in Jamaica who was hanged
for murdering his master.

375
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,100
He had a fever 6 times.
- l knowthere is goodness in him.

376
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,600
How do you knowit?
- Goodness and innocence.

377
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:46,500
l knewit the first moment l sawhim.
- He'll deceive you! Let you down...

378
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,400
at the first opportunity like all your
other good and innocent causes.

379
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,200
lf that boy's good and innocent,
l'll eat my own hat, sir!

380
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,100
How do you feel my, dear?
- Very happy, sir.

381
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,500
l'm very grateful to you, indeed, sir.
- Good boy.

382
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,100
Have you given him any nourishment,
Bedwin? Any slops?

383
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,100
Not slops, sir. Broth.
- A couple of glasses of port wine...

384
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,900
would have done him a great deal
more good, wouldn't they, Sam?

385
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
My name is Oliver, Sir.
- Oliver?

386
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:33,300
Oliver what? Oliver Waters?
- No, sir, Twist. Oliver Twist.

387
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:36,800
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

388
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,900
l never told him so, sir.
- You did not?

389
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,200
No, sir.

390
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,400
You're not angry with me, are you, sir?
- No, no!

391
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:51,300
Queer name: Oliver Twist.

392
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,900
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

393
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
There are a great number, sir.
l never saw so many.

394
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,700
Howwould you like to growup
a clever man, and write books? Hm?

395
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:13,500
Think l would rather read them, sir
- Wouldn't you like to be a book writer?

396
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,200
l think it would be a better thing
to be a bookseller, sir

397
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,300
You have said a very good thing!
Well, well!

398
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:28,200
We won't make an author of you while
there's an honest trade like...

399
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,200
bookselling or brick making to turn to.
- Are you going to send me away, sir?

400
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,600
No, my dear child, you need not be afraid
that l'm going to desert you,

401
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,700
unless you give me cause.
- l never will.

402
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,800
l hope not, because l feel strongly
disposed to trust you.

403
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
l don't have to wear those again.
- So you will, my dear.

404
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,000
There.

405
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:00,400
Hello. What's that?
- This is young Oliver Twist!

406
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:06,800
the bookseller's boy brought a package.
- Stop him! There's some books to go back.

407
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,400
ls that the boy with the fever?
- That's the boy!

408
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:40,200
No sign of him, sir.
- Oh dear, l'm very sorry for that.

409
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,500
Some books must be returned tonight.
- Why not send Oliver with them.

410
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,300
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.
- Yes, do let me take them,

411
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,000
if you please, sir! l'll run all the way.

412
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,400
You shall go, my dear.
Ask Mrs Bedwin to showyou the way.

413
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,700
And Oliver...
- Yes, sir?

414
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,600
Give the bookseller this.

415
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,500
Money l own him.

416
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:24,000
l won't be long, sir.

417
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,700
Howlong do you think it'll take him?
- You really expect him to come back?

418
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,200
You don't?
- With a L5 note in his pocket? No.

419
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:38,900
l do not. lf ever that boy returns
to this house, l'll eat my own head, sir.

420
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,100
And yours!

421
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,700
(Music)

422
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,100
Oh, my little brother!

423
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,900
lt's a miracle!
l've found him, l've found him!

424
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,900
Oh, Oliver, Oliver!
You're such a naughty boy...

425
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,600
to make me suffer such distress
on your account.

426
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,100
What's the matter, ma'am?
- He run away from his parents.

427
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:22,100
Hard-working respectable people. Joined
a set of thieves and bad characters.

428
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,100
Broke his mother's heart.
- The wretch! Go home you little brute.

429
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,100
l haven't got any parents!
l'm an orphan and l live in Pentonville!

430
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Oh hear him howhe braze it out!
- What, young Oliver?

431
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,300
You come home to your poor mother.
- l don't belong to them!

432
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,300
l don't knowthem! Help! Help!
- Help, help? l'll give you ''help, help'',

433
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,400
you little wretch. And these books...

434
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,200
have you been stealing them, have you?
Eh? You little villain.

435
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,300
That's right you give it to him.
Only way to bring him to his senses!

436
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,800
l will, Missus!
Come with me you little wretch!

437
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,500
lt'll do him good.

438
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,000
Look at him, Fagin!

439
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,100
Look at his togs, Fagin!

440
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:21,300
Delighted to see you looking so well,
my dear! Why didn't you write, my dear,

441
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:25,700
and say you was coming?
We'd have got something warm for supper.

442
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:29,700
Hello, Fagin. What's that? That's mine!
- No, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.

443
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,400
You shall have the books.
- lf that ain't mine and Nancy's...

444
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,100
then l'll take the boy back again.
- This is hardly fair, Bill.

445
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,600
Hardly fair, is it, Nancy?
- Hand over l tell you! Give it here,

446
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:46,000
you avarice old skeleton, give it here!
That's for our share of the trouble.

447
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:50,000
Not half enough neither! You may keep
the books if you're fond of reading.

448
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:54,400
lf you ain't, sell them!
- They're very pretty! Beautiful writing,

449
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,400
isn't it, Oliver?
- Send them back!

450
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:01,400
They belong to Mr Brandle. Send them back!
The books and the money. They'll think...

451
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,400
l've stolen them. Please send them back!
- The boy's right. You're right, Oliver,

452
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,400
you're right!
They will think you've stolen them!

453
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,700
Fetch the police! Fetch the police!
- Keep back your dog, Bill,

454
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,200
it'll tear the boy to pieces!
- Serve him right!

455
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,700
Fetch the police! Fetch the police!
- Step aside...

456
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,700
or l'll split your head against the wall.
- l don't care! That child shan't be...

457
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,400
torn down by the dog
unless you kill me first!

458
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,300
Bullseye! Get on! Bullseye!

459
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,700
(Music)

460
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:27,400
So you wanted to get away, my dear,
did you? Wanted to call for the police,

461
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,400
did you? We'll soon cure you of that!

462
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,700
l won't stand by and see this done, Fagin!
You've got the boy, what more do you want?

463
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:41,700
Keep quiet, Nancy, or l'll quieten you
for a good long time to come!

464
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,200
Oh you're a fine one for the boy
to make a friend of!

465
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:49,300
God Almighty help me, l am. He's a thief,
a liar, a devil, all that's bad...

466
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,400
from this night forth. Ain't that enough
for the old wretch without blows?

467
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,500
Come, come we must have civil words...
- Civil words?

468
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:01,500
Civil words, you old villain?
l thieved for you when l was a child...

469
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,500
not half as old as this!
- lt's your living.

470
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,500
Yes, and you're the wretch that drove me
to it and who will keep me doing it...

471
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,200
until l die.

472
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,100
Dodger, Charley, put Oliver to bed.
- Best to take them clothes off first.

473
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:22,100
They're too good to sleep in.
- Charley's right, this here suit...

474
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:26,800
cost more than fourpence ha'penny.
l never felt such lovely stuff.

475
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:33,800
l'm willing to lay odds that this is
the same stuff the Queen wears on Sundays.

476
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,500
Quick get him in, take it off.

477
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:44,800
Lift him up! Up he goes!

478
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:51,100
Get them shoes off!

479
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:27,900
Here's a something for your luncheon,
my dear.

480
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Shall we have a little chat, Oliver?

481
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,500
Shall us?

482
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:55,100
l expect you'd welcome the sound...

483
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:59,300
of a human voice again, eh, my dear?

484
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:09,300
Do you knowwhat l consider
the greatest sin in the world, my dear?

485
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,900
lngratitude.

486
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Yet for your guilty off. lngratitude

487
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:23,000
We took you in, we cherished you, if we
hadn't you might have died of hunger...

488
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:26,900
and how do you repay us? You run away,
you cry out for the police,

489
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
you cause us great anxiety and expense.

490
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,500
There was a lad once just like you,
l was a father to him and he ran away...

491
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:44,200
just like you and he went to the police
and can you guess howhe ended up?

492
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,400
They hanged him at the Old Bailey.

493
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:55,100
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true,

494
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,900
but all of it necessary to provide
for my safety and that of my friends.

495
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:06,100
Poor boy! Hanged!

496
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,400
lt's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.
Dawn, the gallows,

497
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,700
the rope, the noose. And you don't always
have to be guilty, you see, Oliver?

498
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:23,700
They hang you for anything these days.
Because they're so very fond of hanging.

499
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,700
But if you do as you're told
you'll be very good friends here.

500
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,600
You must feel free
to walk about now, Oliver.

501
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,900
Yes, feel free.

502
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,600
Yo, Oliver?
- Yes?

503
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,700
l'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straightaway.

504
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:11,000
Will you do that for me, my man?
- Alright, l'll be glad of the company.

505
01:07:11,100 --> 01:07:15,300
There's a good fellow. For a start-off
would you pan in my trotter cases?

506
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,400
ln plain English, clean my boots.

507
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,500
What a pity he ain't a prig.
- He don't knowwhat's good for him.

508
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,700
l suppose you don't knowwhat a prig is?
- Yes, l do it's a...

509
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,600
it's a thief. You're one, aren't you?
- Yes, l am.

510
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,600
And so we all are, down to the dog,
and he's the downiest one of the lot.

511
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,600
And the least given to peaching!
- He wouldn't so much as bark in a box...

512
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:48,700
for fear of committing himself.
- He's an out and out Christian he is!

513
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,100
Why don't you put yourself under Fagin?
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

514
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:59,200
Like the old gentleman in Pentonville.
Big house that. l had a peep at it l did.

515
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:03,200
Nice inside, was it?
- Yes, and l slept in a proper bed...

516
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:06,700
in my own room.
- Good stuff on the walls?

517
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,200
Yes, indeed.
- Put yourself under Fagin...

518
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,600
and you'll be able to retire to a property
just like that. And do the genteel.

519
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:21,300
No, he's scared he'll come to be scragged.
- l don't knowwhat that means.

520
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,800
lf you don't take pocket handkerchiefs
and watches, Ollie, some other cove will.

521
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:31,900
And you have the same right.
- To be sure, to be sure!

522
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:36,400
lt's your life in a nutshell, my dear.
Take the Dodger's word for it,

523
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:39,700
he understands the catechism of his trade.

524
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:52,600
Cabby!

525
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,500
l've come from Bill.
- For?

526
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,500
No harm.
- l don't believe it.

527
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,600
lf l could help you l would,
but l've not the power.

528
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,400
Now l've promised him you'll be good
and silent. lf you're not,

529
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,100
you'll only do yourself harm and me too.

530
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,500
Did he come quiet?
- Like a lamb.

531
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,400
Sit down!

532
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:54,800
And let me read you a lecture.

533
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,700
You knowwhat this is?
- Yes.

534
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,100
Well, then.

535
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,300
This is powder.

536
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,100
That here's a bullet.

537
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:27,700
And this is a little bit of an old hat
for watted.

538
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,700
Nowit's loaded.
- Yes, l can see it is.

539
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,200
lf you speak a word when you're out of
doors with me unless l speak to you,

540
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:48,300
this loading will go in your head
without notice. So,

541
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,900
if you do make up your mind to speak
without leave, says your prayers first.

542
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,700
The short and long of what you mean is:
if you're crossed by him,

543
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,700
you'll prevent him from ever telling
tales afterwards by shooting him...

544
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,500
through the head and you'll take
your chances swinging for it.

545
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:09,500
That's it! Women always put things
in the fewest words. Supper, Nancy!

546
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,500
Then a snoozer before starting.

547
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,200
Aha! My pal Bill!
The door's open, come in!

548
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,700
Don't make such a row!

549
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:57,000
Showus a glim, Toby.
- Barney, a glim! Showthe gentleman in!

550
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Barney?
- Wake up first, if convenient!

551
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,800
Mr Sykes! Come in, sir, come in!

552
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,200
Bill, my boy! Glad to see you.

553
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,500
Who's this?
- Only the boy.

554
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:45,100
One of Mr Fagin's lads?
- Yeah. lt's time.

555
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,200
Right. Barbaras for me, Barney.

556
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:01,200
They're loaded.
- Good.

557
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:11,100
The Persuaders?
- Got them.

558
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,600
Keys. Centre bits.

559
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,900
Darkies.

560
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:36,300
Nothing forgotten? Ah!

561
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,400
He's alright.

562
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,900
(Music)

563
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:38,200
l can't, l can't!
- You will!

564
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:43,000
lt's Mr Brownlow's house.

565
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,900
Have mercy on me! Don't make me steal
from him! Have mercy on me!

566
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,800
Come here!
- For God's sake...

567
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:23,100
Shut it! Get up,
or l'll strewyour brains on the grass.

568
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,900
(Music)

569
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:08,400
l'm putting you through there.
Go to the front door and unfasten it.

570
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:12,100
l can't. There's a bolt on the top.
l can't reach it.

571
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:16,000
Well, stand on a chair or something.
Just do it.

572
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,900
(Music)

573
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,800
To the door.
To the front door, damn you!

574
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,000
Who's there?

575
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,900
Mrs Bedwin? ls that you?

576
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,400
Save me! Save me, save me for God's sake!

577
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,400
Help!

578
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,600
Help! Police!

579
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,200
Give him here.

580
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:15,500
Damnation howhe bleeds!
- ls he hit bad?

581
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:18,400
He's gotta be hit worse!

582
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,200
Give me a pistol.
- Why?

583
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:29,500
We've got to get rid of him
or he'll squeal. We've got to do him in...

584
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,500
here, here, down here by the river.
- Bill, Bill!

585
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,800
Bill!
- Help, help!

586
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,900
Bill?
- Help!

587
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:56,800
Snap.

588
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,800
Snap.

589
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:02,900
Snap.

590
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:27,200
Well! How are you, Fagy?

591
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:32,600
Scarce, scarce! Where's Bill?

592
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:36,200
He's bleeding!
- What happened?

593
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:40,900
All in good time. l can't talk business
until l've eat and drank.

594
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,600
That's it.
- Where's Bill?

595
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:55,100
Produce the sustenance if you please!

596
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,300
He scares!

597
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,400
The crack failed.
- l smelt that. For the last time...

598
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,400
l'm asking, where's Bill?

599
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:18,600
Put him to bed. Give him a nip of gin.

600
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,800
The boy was about to blow on us, Fagin.

601
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,500
He was seen.
- Seen? Who was see him?

602
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:38,500
Two old ones. He shouted out,
Bill lost his head, fired his pistol...

603
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,000
And hit the boy?
- l don't know. lt was two shots.

604
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:46,700
Only one was Bill's. We made a run for it.
l had hold of the boy and Bill fell.

605
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,800
Fell. Was he hurt?
- No! Last seen he was swimming to London.

606
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,800
Bullseye.

607
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:04,300
l told you not to bring a soul here,
and nowyou've brought the devil.

608
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,500
You said to fetch him! His fever's high,
he don't remember nothing.

609
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,200
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

610
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,300
l'm as weak as water. Get us a drink.

611
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,700
What evil wind has blowed you here?

612
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:27,500
You, Bill, you. You said we need to speak!

613
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:36,100
What have you done with him? Where is he?
- Safe and sound.

614
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:40,200
The Dodger's minding him.
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

615
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,400
What about the boy, Bill?

616
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:53,000
We don't want anyone peaching on us,
do we? And as long as that boy's alive,

617
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,600
we're as good as hung.
- So what's to be done?

618
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,400
Nothing.
- Nothing?

619
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:03,500
Not till l'm better.
- Then what?

620
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:07,600
Then l'll do for him.
- How, Bill? Where?

621
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:12,100
Somewhere l'll find a river and drown him.
- The boy's weak, Bill.

622
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:15,600
He was wounded.
He can hardly stand let alone walk.

623
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:19,300
When he can walk tell me, l'll fetch him.

624
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,900
Now get out of here!
- Yes.

625
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,200
Yes.

626
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,200
Bill, you're right.

627
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,500
lt's for the best.

628
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,400
l'm burning up. Give me my physic,
where's my physic?

629
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,400
You look like a corpse come back
to life again. What's the matter?

630
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:52,100
Nothing.
What do you look at me so hard for?

631
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,200
What are you thinking of?
- Of many things, Bill. What's in that?

632
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:01,200
l'll tell you what it is. lf you haven't
caught the fever then there's...

633
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,900
omething more than usual in the wind,
and something dangerous too!

634
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,000
Give me my physic l say!

635
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,900
l ought to have cut...

636
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,900
her throat three months ago.

637
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,600
The fever's coming.

638
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,600
Here, it'll make you feel better.

639
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,000
Sit down.

640
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,400
Put on your own face or l'll alter it
so you won't knowit again.

641
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:09,900
(Music)

642
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,200
Wait.
- Yes?

643
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,400
Yes?
- Does Mr Brownlowlive here?

644
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:55,400
What do you want? Go round the back.
- l have information about Oliver Twist.

645
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,700
ls he alright? ls he safe?

646
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:05,900
Where is he?
- l will only talk to Mr Brownlow.

647
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
He's not here.
- The boy is innocent, tell him that.

648
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:14,400
Where is he?
- Safe.

649
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,600
But he may not be for long.
- Where is he?

650
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,100
Give Mr Brownlow a message. Tell him
to meet me on Sunday at midnight...

651
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,800
on London Bridge.
And if l'm not there...

652
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:43,800
tell him to come the next night
and the next. l'll be there. Tell him.

653
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,900
There, my dear, you look as good as new!

654
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,200
How do you feel?
- Tired, sir.

655
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,000
Well, it is long after midnight.
Shortly you'll sleep a good sleep.

656
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,800
But my meaning was,
how do you feel in yourself, Oliver?

657
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,900
Better, thank you, sir.
Only for the ache in my arm.

658
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,000
Come sit.

659
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,600
l have the very thing for such pains
as yours, my dear.

660
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,200
Undo the bandage.

661
01:27:31,300 --> 01:27:32,900
Oh!

662
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,200
lt's a nasty wound!

663
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:42,000
But my magic will do the trick,
you'll see, my dear.

664
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:46,000
This remedy is as older than time,
yes my dear.

665
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:50,900
Older than time.
lt was handed down from father to son,

666
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,200
father to son and it comes from...

667
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:01,000
Who can say where?

668
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,000
Thank you, sir, thank you.

669
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,800
For your kindness.
l will always remember it.

670
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:13,800
Well, yeah.

671
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,800
Always? Yes, always, my dear.

672
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:23,300
But who knows howlong that will be?

673
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:54,500
An hour this side of midnight.
Dark and heavy it is too.

674
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:59,900
A good night for business this.
- Ah, what a pity, Bill, my dear,

675
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,400
there's no one quite ready to be done.
- So when will the boy be well enough

676
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:09,000
to go on his travels then?
- Like l say, Bill, in a day or two.

677
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:12,100
lt's a pity, for l'm in a humour too.

678
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,400
Does me good to hear you.
You're not yourself tonight, Bill, eh?

679
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:20,000
Quite like yourself.
- Well, l don't feel like myself

680
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,600
when you lay that wicked old claw
on my shoulder, so take it away!

681
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,900
Hello, Nance. And where's the girl
going to this time of night?

682
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,500
Not far.
- What answer's that? Where are you going?

683
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,600
l say ''not far.''
- And l say ''where?''

684
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:46,600
And l say ''nowhere!''
- Then l do, ''nowhere!'' Sit down!

685
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:50,500
l'm not well. l want a breath of air.
- Put your head out the window!

686
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:54,400
There's not enough there,
l want it in the street.

687
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,900
Then you won't have it!

688
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:08,200
There!
Now stop quietly where you are, will you?

689
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,700
Do you knowwhat you're doing?
- Do l knowwhat?

690
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:23,800
You talking me in that way?
- You drive me on to something desperate.

691
01:30:23,900 --> 01:30:27,500
Nowlet me go! This minute, this instant!
- No!

692
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:32,800
Tell him to let me go, Fagin! lt'll be
better for him. Do you hear me?

693
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,500
l hear you.

694
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:42,000
And if l have to listen to you for half
a minute longer, the dog will have such...

695
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:46,000
a grip on your throat he'll be tearing
some of that screaming voice out!

696
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:50,100
What's come over you, what is it?
- Bill, let me go!

697
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,800
Let me go!
You don't knowwhat you're doing!

698
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:57,600
For only one hour!
- Cut my limbs off one by one...

699
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,300
if l don't find the girl stark raving mad!
Get up! Get up!

700
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,000
No!

701
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:13,800
And stay there!
- What a precious strange girl that is!

702
01:31:15,100 --> 01:31:19,000
You may say that, Bill!
- Why do you think she took it into her...

703
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:23,200
head to go out tonight for, do you think?
- Obstinacy, l suppose.

704
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:27,200
l thought l'd tamed her of that
and she's as bad as ever.

705
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,700
l think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood and it won't come out.

706
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,700
Well, if she's taking that way again,
l'll let her a little blood,

707
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,700
without troubling the doctor!

708
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,400
Well, now she's on the other tack!

709
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,500
Goodnight. ln two days, Bill...
come for the boy.

710
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:12,000
Bring him down. He should fall and break
his neck without anyone seeing it.

711
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,600
Showhim a light.

712
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:28,000
What is it, Nancy, dear?
The reason for all this?

713
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:31,700
What do you mean?
- That matter just now.

714
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:37,400
You have a friend in me Nance,
a staunch friend. You knowme well, Nance.

715
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:40,400
l knowyou well. Goodnight.

716
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,200
Trouble.

717
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,400
Dodger!

718
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:23,700
ls something up?

719
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,800
l...

720
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:34,200
l want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

721
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,800
What is it?
l ain't going in no police office.

722
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:43,600
Not the smallest danger in it,
not the smallest. l want someone dodged.

723
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:46,200
Who? An old one?
- Ayoung one.

724
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:48,300
Who is she?
- One of us

725
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,000
Who? Nancy?

726
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:56,200
What's she been up to?
- l'm not sure she's been up to anything,

727
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:59,200
that's why l want her dodged.

728
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:05,000
l want to knowto whom she talkes.
l want to knowwhere she goes,

729
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:08,200
what she sees, what she says.

730
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:14,300
Nancy. l don't know.
She's a good 'un is Nancy.

731
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,000
A pound, my dear. One whole pound.

732
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,500
Mr Brownlow?.

733
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:03,400
Yes.

734
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:10,400
l'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away! Followme!

735
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:26,800
This is far enough.
Why we can't speak up there?

736
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:30,500
l told you l'm afraid. l may be followed.

737
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:38,200
l am here because you told my housekeeper
that have some information...

738
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,200
concerning the boy Oliver Twist.
- So l have.

739
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,300
Tell me!
- He's being held by the devil.

740
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,800
And he's handing him over to another one
who means to...

741
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,600
l must knowmore.
ls it someone close to you?

742
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:56,300
Well, it is, well, it ain't...
- These men whoever they are,

743
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:00,000
must be delivered up by you.
- Bad as a life as he has led,

744
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
l've led a bad life too
and l will not turn upon him.

745
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:06,500
The other...

746
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:09,500
Fagin. He has the boy.
- Fagin?

747
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:13,500
Find Fagin. - Where is he?
Spitalfields.

748
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:19,100
That's all l'll say. l've said too much.
No one must ever knowwho told you.

749
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,400
Promise?
- l promise. Tomorrow l will put...

750
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:26,100
the matter before the police.
- No! You must do it tonight.

751
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:29,600
Just say Fagin and the traps will know...
- The traps?

752
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:33,200
The police.
- What can l do to serve you?

753
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:37,200
Nothing. You can do nothing.
l'm past all hope, indeed

754
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:41,900
Take this as a reward.
- No, l've not done this for money.

755
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,500
God Bless You. Goodnight!

756
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:51,000
Never, never say who told you.

757
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:05,000
You ok, chief?

758
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:09,800
What a shame it is! With his face he could
pick old ladies pockets in churches.

759
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,700
His face could be a fortune.

760
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,400
Are you changing your mind?
- No.

761
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,500
No. What has to be done has to be done.
- Fagin!

762
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:30,300
What's got into you Dodger?
- l have to see Fagin alone.

763
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,800
No, you can speak in front of Bill.
- No, l can't.

764
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:36,900
Yes, you can speak, Dodger, tell us!
- Nancy...

765
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,600
What about Nancy?
- l had him dodge Nancy.

766
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:44,700
What do you mean?
- Tell us, Dodger, you followed her?

767
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,800
Yes, to London Bridge.
- And what? What at London Bridge?

768
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,400
She met an old 'un, a gentleman, and...
- And...

769
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,400
Speak, will you!
- She peached!

770
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:01,000
She told him Fagin had Oliver!
And the old man wants to go to the traps.

771
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,600
Now, tonight.

772
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,100
Let me go! let me out!
Don't speak to me, it's not safe!

773
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,600
You won't be too violent, Bill?

774
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:36,900
Quick, boys! Every second the traps
could be at the door!

775
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,600
Quick! Quick! Quick!

776
01:38:42,900 --> 01:38:44,900
(Music)

777
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,000
Bill? What's the matter?

778
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

779
01:40:05,900 --> 01:40:10,500
lt's enough light for what l've got to do!
- What have l done?

780
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,700
Speak to me!
- You know!

781
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
You were watched tonight.
Every word you said was heard.

782
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:24,400
l never said your name, Bill. Never!

783
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,000
Never! Bill, Bill...

784
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,600
God have mercy!

785
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,200
Nance?

786
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:04,400
Nance?

787
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,900
(Music)

788
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:54,800
Hello, Fagy! Hello, lads!

789
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,900
What's the news, Tony, what's the news?
- l have it here, Fagin.

790
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
lt's all in ''The Chronicle''.
You're in it. Bill's in it,

791
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,600
Oliver's in it.
- ''The Chronicle''? Fancy that!

792
01:42:08,700 --> 01:42:11,700
You're famous, Fagin!
- Read it!

793
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,700
''More information has reached
a correspondent concerning the foul...

794
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,700
and bestial murder that took place
in Spitalfields and which has shocked...

795
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,800
and appalled the citizens of London.

796
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,800
lt is believed that the victim,
a young woman, nowidentified as Nancy,

797
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,700
was brutally beaten to death
by one William Sykes,

798
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:37,200
a well-known dangerous villain.

799
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,500
The motive is as yet unclear,
but your correspondent has learned...

800
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:45,400
that the murdered woman had informed
on her associate and on an...

801
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:48,400
infamous fence, Fagin,

802
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:53,100
who is nowwanted for the abduction
of a young boy Oliver Twist.

803
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,200
Neither Fagin nor Sykes are presently
in custody, but the police are engaged...

804
01:42:59,200 --> 01:43:03,200
on searching for them
throughout the city and beyond.

805
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:07,900
Sykes, according to the police
is usually accompanied...

806
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,800
by a fierce white dog.''

807
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,900
How about that, eh?

808
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:26,700
(Bill whistles)

809
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,000
Come! Come back here!

810
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,800
We're going back to London.

811
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:40,300
l have people to speak to.
Get to France.

812
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,600
Damn me we'll risk it.

813
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:23,800
Bullseye?
Don't you hear me when l whistle?

814
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:29,400
Have you gone deaf or something?
Come here.

815
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,700
l ain't going to harm you.
Come here, Bullseye.

816
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:40,900
Stop it.

817
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,600
Bullseye!

818
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,800
Bullseye! Bullseye!
Get back here! Get back here!

819
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,200
Damned!

820
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:10,100
lt's his dog! lt's his dog!

821
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,200
Here, boy! Here!

822
01:45:25,100 --> 01:45:28,800
There is a child in danger,
lnspector Blather, but you only seem...

823
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:32,900
interested in apprehending this man Sykes.
Your concern should be for the safety...

824
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:36,000
of the boy.
- Allowme to say, sir;

825
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,600
this is our usual way of doing business.
My thinking is this...

826
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:45,100
lf we get Sykes we get Fagin
and if we get Fagin...

827
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:48,100
Look, sir, we found the dog!

828
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:55,200
Are we going to sit here all night
waiting for the traps to find us?

829
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:58,300
He's right, we should do another flit.

830
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:03,700
(Knocking)
The traps!

831
01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:21,300
What?
- lt's him!

832
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:25,300
Don't let him in!
- We must.

833
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,000
Go on!

834
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:31,700
Go on!

835
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,700
Don't leave us in the dark!

836
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,900
(Music)

837
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,600
Damn you all!
Have you nothing to say to me?

838
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:45,500
Only safe for us to stop here, Bill.
- lf it's safe for you it's safe for me.

839
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:49,900
ls it...

840
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:53,600
The body, is it buried?

841
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,800
(Bullseye's barking)

842
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,000
Dodger, let him in quick.

843
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,600
Dodger! Do as l say!

844
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:15,600
Don't come near me, you monster!

845
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:21,700
You're my witnesses,
l'm not afraid of him.

846
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:27,000
And if they come here after him l'll give
him up. l'll tell them you're here!

847
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:31,000
He may kill me if he likes, but if l'm
here l'll give him up, if he was to be...

848
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:34,700
boiled alive, so l would!
- What, you young...

849
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:41,000
Take your hands off me!

850
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:49,500
Help, he's here! He's here, quick!
Help! Come on please!

851
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:58,000
Damn you all!
Do your worst, l'll cheat you yet!

852
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,800
Bill, no! He's our bargaining tool!
- Not yours, Fagin, mine!

853
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,000
Hold your fire, men!
- l'll let the boy go!

854
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:40,600
l'll let him drop! Don't shoot at me
or l'll let him go!

855
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,900
(Music)

856
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,500
We must give chase, sir!

857
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:17,900
(Music)

858
01:51:10,200 --> 01:51:12,800
Grab it! Grab it!

859
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:27,900
(Music)

860
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:33,100
(Mrs Bedwin)
Oliver! Oliver!

861
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,300
Oliver!

862
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,900
Here he is, sir.
- Come along my boy,

863
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Mr Grimwig has something to say to you.

864
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:54,500
Do the honours, Mrs Bedwin.
- Nowthen young man, l confess...

865
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,800
l misjudged you. Truth to tell,
l was afraid your benefactor...

866
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:02,900
would make me eat my hat!
But he's a good friend...

867
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:06,500
and has pardoned me.
- And one for Oliver.

868
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:10,200
And you too.
- Oh l don't know as l should, sir.

869
01:53:10,300 --> 01:53:13,300
You must!
- So l'll take the liberty,

870
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:17,200
if you'll allowme to salute you.
To Sam Waters.

871
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,900
Oliver Twist.
- Oliver Twist.

872
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:24,000
To Oliver Twist, yes

873
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:31,500
Oliver! My child, what's the matter?

874
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:34,600
Why are you so sad?

875
01:53:59,800 --> 01:54:03,500
Are you certain, Oliver,
that you wish to go through with this?

876
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:05,400
Yes, sir.

877
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,600
Yes?

878
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:03,600
ls the young gentleman to come too, sir?
lt's not a sight for children, sir.

879
01:55:03,700 --> 01:55:07,400
lt is not, indeed, my friend.
But this child has seen this man...

880
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:11,200
in the full career of his success
in villainy and it is his wish,

881
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:16,400
even at the cost of some pain and fear,
that he should see him now.

882
01:55:46,100 --> 01:55:47,700
18!

883
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:10,200
(Fagin prays)

884
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:29,100
Don't be frightened. Fagin?
- That's me, an old man, my lord.

885
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:34,400
Avery old man.
- There's somebody here wants to see you.

886
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:41,200
What right have they to butcher me?
- Speak to him now, quick if you please.

887
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:44,200
He gets worse as time goes on.
- Fagin?

888
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:49,900
You are kind to me.
- l'll be kind to you.

889
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:54,200
l'll be kind again.

890
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,700
l'm not afraid.
- Oliver!

891
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,700
Let me whisper to you.

892
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:16,800
Get me my box, Oliver,
with my pretty things

893
01:57:17,200 --> 01:57:19,800
for my old age in.

894
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,500
They're yours, yours!
- Yes, yes.

895
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:31,300
But shall we say a prayer together first.

896
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:36,400
Say only one upon your knees with me
and we can talk all morning.

897
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,700
Oliver, Oliver, you can say...
l'll give give you all the pretty things.

898
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,600
All yours.

899
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:51,400
Oh God, forgive this wretched man!
- That's right, that's right.

900
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:54,400
That'll help us on, if... if... if...

901
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:59,000
l shake and tremble
as we pass the gallows,

902
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:03,300
don't... don't say goodbye carry on.
Down, down, down.

903
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:07,900
Have you some more to say?
- Nothing more.

904
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:12,000
You better leave him.
- Pastor, pastor, pastor...

905
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:19,000
Pastor, pastor, pastor...
