1
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,638
片名：雾都孤儿

2
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:11,065
给各位理事鞠躬
Bow to the board.

3
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:14,075
就是这孩子
This is the boy.

4
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:18,377
在救济院出生，然后去了教区农场
Born here in the workhouse. Moved to the parish farm.

5
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,277

Nine years old today. Time to be moved back here.

6
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:23,781
你叫什么，孩子？
What's your name, boy?

7
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,985
- 奥利弗・忒斯特 - 什么？
-OIiver Twist. -What?

8
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:34,754
- 那孩子是个傻子 - 孩子，听我说
-That boy's a fool. -Boy. Listen to me.

9
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,355
我想，你知道自己是孤儿吧？
You know you are an orphan, I suppose.

10
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,932
- 你说什么？ - 这孩子是个傻子，可能早就是了
-What's that? -The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

11
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,330
你知道你无父无母...
You know you've got no father or mother...

12
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:45,200
...由教会养大，是吗？
...and that you were brought up by the parish, don't you?

13
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,967
- 是的，先生 - 你哭什么？
-Yes, sir. -What are you crying for?

14
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,940
我希望你每天晚上都做祷告
I hope you say your prayers every night.

15
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:54,912
替那些养育你，照顾你的人祈祷
Pray for those that feed you and take care of you...

16
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,311
...像一个基督徒...
...Iike a Christian.

17
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:58,418
- 是的，先生 - 好吧...
-Yes, sir. -Well...

18
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,520
...你上这儿来是接受教育...

19
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,054
...来学一门有用的手艺的
...and to be taught a useful trade.

20
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,304
这些东西放哪儿？
Here, where do you want these?

21
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,917
跟你旁边的孩子学
Learn from the boy next to you.

22
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,255
- 学什么，先生？ - 学拣麻絮
-What am I to Iearn, sir? -Learn to pick out the oakum.

23
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,794
麻絮是什么，先生？
What's oakum, sir?

24
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,562
你哪儿来这么多问题？！
Stop asking so many questions.

25
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:49,100
麻絮是从旧绳子里面挑出来的纤维
Oakum's the fibers you unpick from the old rope.

26
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:53,468
能再次用在女王陛下的船上
Then it's used again for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.

27
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,870
你是在为国效力
You're serving your country.

28
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,670
好了，干活吧
Now, get on with it.

29
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:35,049
汤姆，歇一歇好不好？ 我们还要睡觉呢
Tom, give it a rest, will you? We're trying to sleep.

30
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,251
- 睡不着，太饿了 - 我们都饿
-Can't sleep, too hungry. -We're all hungry.

31
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,924
是的，但我怕
Yes, but I'm frightened.

32
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,684
怕？为什么？
Frightened? Why?

33
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,357
什么？什么？
Why? Why?

34
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:53,057
我太饿了，我怕把旁边的小子吃了
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might eat the Iad that sleeps next to me.

35
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,161
主啊...
O Lord God...

36
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:33,364
...感谢你赐予我们...
...for the blessing of this generous and bountiful meal...

37
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,668
...如此丰盛的食物...
...that thou hast placed before us...

38
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:38,607
...感谢您的慷慨，阿门
...we give thanks. Amen.

39
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,180
阿门
Amen.

40
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:04,162
对不起，先生，我还要一点
PIease, sir. I want some more.

41
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,093
什么？
What?

42
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:10,794
对不起，先生，我还要
PIease, sir, I want some more.

43
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,210
快把执事找来！
Fetch the beadle!

44
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,518
尼姆金斯先生
Mr. Limbkins.

45
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,356
请原谅，先生
I beg your pardon, sir.

46
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,966
奥利弗・忒斯特还想要
OIiver Twist has asked for more.

47
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,833
还要？！
For more?!

48
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,768
镇静，邦布尔先生 清楚地回答我
Compose yourself, Mr. Bumble, and answer me distinctly.

49
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:50,570
你是说他吃了他的晚餐之后还要？
Do I understand that he asked for more after he had eaten his supper?

50
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,041
是的，先生
He did, sir.

51
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:58,009
那孩子以后准会被绞死
That boy will be hanged.

52
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:13,065
“5镑一个孩--”
"Five pounds and a b--"

53
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:20,498
我说“哇”，那就是“哇”
When I says "whoa," I means "whoa"!

54
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:24,606
“健...健康的...
"Health-- Healthy...

55
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:28,214
...学...学徒
...appren-- apprentice.

56
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,680
5镑”
Five pounds."

57
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,220
扫烟囱是个脏活
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

58
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:38,791
以前有小孩在烟囱里面憋死的
Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now.

59
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:42,225
那是因为要他们下来 可还没有点火...
That's because they damp the straw afore they Iight it in the chimney...

60
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,230
...他们就把稻草弄湿了 湿的稻草会生烟
...to make them come out again. Damp straw makes smoke.

61
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,562
烟会让孩子睡着，他们还巴不得呢
Smoke sends a boy to sleep, and that's what he wants.

62
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,762
小孩子都很懒的
Boys is very Iazy, gentlemen.

63
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:55,431
但一团火就能让他们上杆子跑出来 没有比这个更灵的了
But there's nothing Iike a good hot blaze to make them come out in a run.

64
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,639
而且很人道
It's humane too. Yes.

65
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,907
即使他们粘在烟囱上了
Because even if they've stuck in the chimney...

66
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:07,180
...脚板一热，他们就得赶紧下来
...roasting their feet makes them struggle to extricate theirselves.

67
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,720
是啊
Yes.

68
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,824
我想他喜欢扫烟囱这个活儿的吧？
I suppose he's fond of chimney sweeping?

69
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,256
没错，大人
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

70
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,191
好吧，那我就要签契约了...
Very well. I will sign the indentures...

71
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,362
...把他签给....
...to make him Mr....

72
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:24,629
甘菲尔先生做学徒
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

73
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:35,142
孩子
My boy.

74
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:41,084
孩子，你脸色苍白又惊慌失措
My boy, you Iook pale and alarmed.

75
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:42,449
出什么事了？
What's the matter?

76
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,925
求求您，先生，求求您，先生
PIease, sir. PIease, sir.

77
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,186
怎么了，孩子？
What is it, my boy?

78
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,159
- 别.... - 够了
-Don't.... -Now then.

79
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:52,492
别.... 别....
Don't.... Don't....

80
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:55,568
说吧，孩子，别什么？
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

81
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,933
求您别让这个可怕的人把我带走，先生
PIease don't send me away with this dreadful man, sir.

82
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:02,142
阴险狡猾的孤儿我见得多了....
Of all the designing orphans that I've ever seen....

83
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:05,040
- 闭嘴，执事 - 你是在跟我说话吗，大人？
-Hold your tongue, beadle. -Did Your Worship speak to me?

84
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,806
是的，闭嘴
Yes, hold your tongue.

85
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:12,013
不，不行
No. No, out of the question.

86
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,156
我拒绝签这张契约
We refuse to sanction these indentures.

87
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,823
把这孩子带走
Take the boy away.

88
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,526
好好待他
And treat him kindly.

89
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,359
看来他需要善待
He seems to want it.

90
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:45,514
我已经给昨晚去世的两位女士量好了尺寸
I've just taken the measure of the two women that died Iast night.

91
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,553
你要发财了，苏尔伯雷先生
You'II make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry.

92
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,050
您这么认为吗？
Think so?

93
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,393
理事会出的价钱太少啦
The prices allowed by the board are very small.

94
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,861
棺材不也不大吗？
So are the coffins.

95
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:04,168
顺便问一下，你知不知道有谁想找个仆童？
By the by, you don't know anybody who wants a boy, do you?

96
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:09,937
报酬很可观，苏尔伯雷先生，很可观
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry. Liberal terms.

97
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,378
现在你要见你的新师傅了...
Now, as you are to meet your new master...

98
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,581
...把帽子拉起来
...pull that cap off your eyes.

99
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,985
头抬起来，“先生”
Hold your head up, sir.

100
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:32,959
把眼睛擦干，“先生”
Dry your eyes, sir.

101
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:43,043
- 是你吗，邦布尔？ - 不会是别人，苏尔伯雷先生
-Is that you, Bumble? -No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

102
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:46,407
我把那个孤儿带来了 奥利弗・忒斯特
I've brought the orphan, OIiver Twist.

103
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,242
那么说他是那个孤儿？
So this is the orphan, is it?

104
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,884
苏尔伯雷太太...
Mrs. Sowerberry...

105
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,249
...能不能请你过来一下，亲爱的？
...will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?

106
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,017
奥利弗・忒斯特
OIiver Twist.

107
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,523
孤儿怎么会有名字？
How comes an orphan to have any name at all?

108
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,161
- 我给起的 - 你，邦布尔先生？
-I invented it. -You, Mr. Bumble?

109
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:03,955
我，苏尔伯雷先生
I, Mr. Sowerberry.

110
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:07,601
我按字母顺序给这些孤儿起名字
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.

111
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,497
最后一个是S
The Iast was S.

112
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,501
我给起了斯瓦布尔
Swubble, I named him.

113
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:15,472
这个是T，我给起了忒斯特
This was a T. Twist, I named him.

114
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:18,271
下一个是恩文...
Next one as comes will be Unwin...

115
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,175
...再下一个是维金斯
...and the next, Vilkins.

116
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:24,147
我把整个字母表的名字都准备好了 一直到Z
I've got names ready all through the alphabet, right up to Z.

117
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,753
哎呀，你可是个大文豪呢，先生
Why, you're quite a Iiterary character, sir.

118
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,150
嗯，嗯...
Well, well...

119
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:32,349
- ...没准就是呢 - 苏尔伯雷太太...
-...perhaps I may be. -Mrs. Sowerberry...

120
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,154
...这是救济院的孤儿
...this is the orphan from the workhouse.

121
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,865
天哪，他可真瘦小
Dear me, he's very small.

122
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,058
但他会长大的，苏尔伯雷太太 会长大的
But he'II grow, Mrs. Sowerberry. He'II grow.

123
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,763
是啊，在我这里吃的好喝得好 我敢说他肯定会的
Yes, I daresay he will. On our food and drink.

124
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:50,707
救济院的孩子吃得都比一般孩子多
Workhouse boys always cost more to keep than they're worth.

125
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,211
到楼下去，瘦皮猴
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

126
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,516
夏洛特...
Here, Charlotte...

127
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:00,381
...把我们给狗准备的冷饭给这孩子
...give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for the dog.

128
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:31,513
我猜你不会介意睡在棺材旁边
You don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose.

129
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,119
你介意不介意都一样...
Well, it doesn't much matter whether you do or don't...

130
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,813
...没别的地方给你睡
...for you can't sleep anywhere else.

131
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,727
开门？
Open the door, will you?

132
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,714
- 你是新来的小子？ - 是的，先生
-You the new boy? -Yes, sir.

133
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:14,046
- 你多大了？ - 10岁，先生
-How old are you? -Ten, sir.

134
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:18,385
我进来后要好好教训你一顿，救济院的小子
Then I'II whop you one when I get in, you workhouse brat.

135
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:37,504
请问，先生 是您敲门的吗？
I beg your pardon, sir. Did you knock?

136
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:38,906
是我踢的
I kicked.

137
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,547
您要买棺材吗，先生？
Did you want a coffin, sir?

138
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,479
- 我猜你不知道我是谁 - 不知道，先生
-You don't know who I am, I suppose. -No, sir.

139
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:48,122
我是诺亚・克雷波尔先生 你归我管
Well, I'm Mr. Noah CIaypole. And you're under me.

140
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,848
现在把窗板关上
Now, take down the shutters.

141
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:59,895
我从师傅的早餐里给你留了点熏肉
Saved a nice Iittle bit of bacon for you from the master's breakfast.

142
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:07,641
到角落去吃，动作快点
In the corner with you. And be quick about it.

143
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:11,005
他们等你看铺子呢，听到了吗？
They'II want you to mind the shop. Do you hear?

144
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,009
没听到吗，救济院的？ 到角落里去
Do you hear, Workhouse? In the corner.

145
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:15,648
老天啊，诺亚，别管这孩子了
Oh, Lord, Noah, Iet the boy alone.

146
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,613
别管他？
Let him alone?

147
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,753
谁愿意管他了？
Why, everybody's Iet him alone.

148
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:24,482
他的爸爸，妈妈，所有的亲戚都不管他了
His mother, father and all his relations has Iet him alone.

149
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,286
所有他需要有人来管了
So he needs someone who don't.

150
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:49,677
晚餐
Supper.

151
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:52,850
奥利弗，你还没做完吗？
OIiver, ain't you done yet?

152
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:58,218
我还从来没见过这么没用的孩子 到楼下去
I've never known such an idle boy. Get down them stairs.

153
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:59,791
苏尔伯雷先生...
Mr. Sowerberry...

154
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,689
...进晚餐了
...supper.

155
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:05,063
- 我有个想法，亲爱的 - 想法？
-I've had a thought, my dear. -Had a thought?

156
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,099
那你要小心了，苏尔伯雷先生 你会得脑膜炎的
You want to be careful, Mr. Sowerberry, you'II get brain fever.

157
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:11,829
- 是关于小忒斯特的 - 他怎么了？
-It's about young Twist. -What about him?

158
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,566
- 一个很好看的孩子 - 当然啦，他吃得可不少
-A very good-Iooking boy. -He will be. He eats enough.

159
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:20,337
他脸上有一种忧伤的表情，亲爱的
There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear.

160
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:24,109
他能成为一个出色的送殡人，亲爱的
He would make a delightful mute, my Iove.

161
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:30,481
我-- 我不是说参加成人葬礼的 一般送殡人...
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up funerals, my dear...

162
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:34,491
...是儿童出殡的
...but only for children's practice.

163
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,004
看看他
Look at him.

164
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:52,573
看看他
Look at him.

165
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:57,677
救济院的小鬼头，看啊
A workhouse boy and a sneak. Look at him.

166
00:18:57,885 --> 00:19:00,012
记住我的话，他会被绞死的
Mark my words, I'II see him hung.

167
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:02,853
不用多久
Can't be too soon.

168
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:08,684
救济院的，你妈妈呢？
Workhouse, how's your mother?

169
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,721
她死了
She's dead.

170
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,824
怎么死的？
What'd she die of, Workhouse?

171
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,837
你要哭了吗，救济院的？
You gonna cry, Workhouse?

172
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,477
- 什么事让你哭的？ - 不是你
-What set you off? -Not you.

173
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,545
- 不是我？ - 不是你
-Not me, eh? -No, not you.

174
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:32,215
你最好别说我妈妈的事
And you better not say anything about my mother.

175
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,390
最好？
Better not?

176
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,691
你妈妈的事？
About your mother?

177
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,862
我很抱歉，我很可怜你
Well, I'm very sorry, and I pity you very much.

178
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,724
但你必须知道，救济院的...
But you must know, Workhouse...

179
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:46,092
...你妈妈准不是个好东西
...your mother was a regular right-down bad one.

180
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:52,229
- 你说什么？ - 你妈妈不是个好东西
-What did you say? -A regular right-down bad one.

181
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,237
她死得正是时候...
It's a good thing she died when she did...

182
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,808
...不然的话，她准是在做苦工 或是被流放了
...or she'd be hard Iaboring or transported.

183
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:00,344
要么就是被绞死了，这个可能性最大 是吗，救济院的？
Or hung. Which is most Iikely, isn't it, Workhouse?

184
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,180
救命啊，夏洛特太太！
Help, Mrs. Charlotte!

185
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,149
他要杀了我了，救命啊！
He'II murder me. Help!

186
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,781
救命，走开！
Help. Get off!

187
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:14,092
老天啊，帮帮我！
For God's sake, help me!

188
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,390
太太，他要杀了我！
My missus, he's murdering me!

189
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,066
- 走开，走开！ - 把他拉开，夏洛特
-Get off. Get off me now! -Get him, Charlotte.

190
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,862
把他拉到外面去，快
Get him now. Go out with him. Come on.

191
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,233
- 救济院的魔鬼 - 我要教训教训你！
-Workhouse devil. -I'II Iearn you!

192
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,236
- 你这个小坏蛋！ - 把门打开，夏洛特
-You brat! -Get the door, Charlotte.

193
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:32,469
把他仍进去
In with him. In.

194
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,616
太凶残了，先生
Very violent indeed, sir.

195
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,887
太太说...
And the missus said...

196
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,721
...如果邦布尔先生能拨冗...
...if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

197
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,626
...就可以来教训他了...
...then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...

198
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,663
...因为师傅出去了
...because the master's out.

199
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,171
- 在这里面 - 奥利弗？
-In there. -OIiver?

200
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,240
让我出去！
Let me out of here!

201
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:06,174
- 听到我说话吗，奥利弗？ - 听到了
-Do you know this here voice, OIiver? -Yes.

202
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,972
你不怕吗？
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

203
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:10,742
听到我的说话，你不打颤吗？
Ain't you trembling while I speak, sir?

204
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:12,749
不！
No!

205
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,555
- 他准是疯了 - 不是疯了，是肉
-He must be mad. -It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.

206
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,625
- 肉？ - 肉，太太，肉
-Meat? -Meat, ma'am, meat.

207
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:23,023
你给他吃得太多了
You've overfed him.

208
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,063
如果你一直给他喝粥的话 就不会有这种事情了
If you'd kept this boy on gruel, this would never have happened.

209
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:29,532
天哪，真是好心没好报
Dear, dear. This comes of being Iiberal.

210
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,167
到底是怎么回事情？
What's all this?

211
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:35,001
奥利弗・忒斯特突然发狂了 苏尔伯雷先生
OIiver Twist has turned violent, Mr. Sowerberry.

212
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,939
看他把我的眼睛打的，先生
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

213
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,311
你呀，你呀！
Now then. Now then.

214
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:48,352
- 你是个好孩子，不是吗？ - 他侮辱我的妈妈
-You're a nice young fellow, ain't you? -He called my mother names.

215
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:52,583
要是他死了怎么办 你这个忘恩负义的家伙！
Well, and what if he did, you Iittle ungrateful wretch!

216
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:54,693
她活该，报应还不够呢
She deserved what he said and worse.

217
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,089
- 不是的！ - 是的！
-She didn't! -She did!

218
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,992
你说谎！
It's a Iie!

219
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:06,406
别干站着了，苏尔伯雷先生 他说我扯谎呢
Do something, Mr. Sowerberry. He called me a Iiar.

220
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,036
别干站着了！
Do something!

221
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,515
对不起，小姐...
I beg your pardon, miss...

222
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,846
...您能不能好心...？
...but would you be so kind--?

223
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,756
滚远点
Get off my Iand.

224
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,585
我不欢迎乞丐，滚！
I don't want no beggars here. Go on!

225
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:49,559
滚！ 要不我就放狗了！
Get off! Or I'II put the dog on you!

226
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:33,938
我没有多少，就这点也够救你的小命了
I haven't much, but you're more than welcome to it.

227
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,105
当心点，烫的
Be careful, it's hot.

228
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:51,118
一看到你我的心就一抽
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

229
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:55,761
我眼睛不好使了，但...
My eyes ain't what they were. But...

230
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:59,592
...我一时把你....
...I just thought for a moment....

231
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,402
你这么小，怎么一个人出门？
Why are you on the road at all, a Iittle mite Iike you?

232
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:15,311
- 你要去哪儿？ - 伦敦，夫人
-Where are you headed? -London, ma'am.

233
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:17,683
伦敦？
London?

234
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,716
伦敦
London.

235
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,915
哦，天哪，天哪
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

236
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,704
你好，小哥
Hello, my man.

237
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:54,711
你这是怎么了？
And what's your game?

238
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,841
你不住附近吧？
You're not from these parts?

239
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,379
打哪儿来的？
Where you from, then?

240
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,992
我已经走了7天了
I've been walking. Seven days.

241
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:10,254
7天？啊！
Seven days? Cor.

242
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:11,658
我猜你想吃东西吧？
I expect you want grub?

243
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:14,428
保准你能吃到
And you shall have it.

244
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:17,160
我现在手头也有点紧...
I'm at a Iow-water mark meself just at the moment...

245
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:19,869
...但我会想办法的
...but I'II fork out and stump.

246
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:22,838
来吧，站起来
Come on, up with you, on your pins.

247
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:32,343
这些不会再出来了吧？
And these won't get out again?

248
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,544
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

249
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,551
哦，顺便说一下...
Oh, by the by...

250
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:40,591
...我叫杰克・道金斯 大家都叫我机灵鬼
...my name is Jack Dawkins, better known as the Artful Dodger.

251
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:43,092
奥利弗・忒斯特
OIiver Twist.

252
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:47,224
你为什么叫机灵鬼？
Why are you known as the Artful Dodger?

253
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,768
这就是原因
That's why.

254
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:59,211
有住的地方吗？
Got any Iodgings?

255
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,176
钱呢？
Money?

256
00:30:01,748 --> 00:30:05,206
看来今晚你要找地方睡觉了，是吗？
I suppose you want someplace to sleep tonight, don't you?

257
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:43,252
蝾螈
Baby newt.

258
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:46,688
蝾螈，4便士一个
Buy a baby newt, 4 pennies.

259
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:51,764
你走这么远，不是铁嘴的命令吧
I expect you walking for so Iong was a beak's order.

260
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:55,492
- 铁嘴是什么？ - 你不知道铁嘴是什么？
-What does that mean? -Don't you know what a beak is?

261
00:30:55,702 --> 00:30:58,694
- 是鸟嘴吗？ - 啊，你还真是个雏儿
-A bird's mouth, isn't it? -Cor, you are green.

262
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:02,137
铁嘴就是治安推事，你到底是哪儿人啊？
A beak's a magistrate, my son. Where you been all your Iife?

263
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:03,969
你给我滚开！
Get off me, you!

264
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:06,146
你自找的，活该
That's it, you asked for it.

265
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,317
回来啊，我有话对你说

00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:19,776
快点喝，另一位先生还等着用杯子呢
Only, drink it quick because another of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

你看见什么了？ 说啊，孩子！

我再也睡不着了，先生

如果打扰了您，我非常抱歉

我只是想吓吓你

331
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,989

很不错
Very.

341
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:02,813
这个标记做得不好
You haven't marked them well.

342
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:07,952
得用针挑出来，我们--
The marks should be picked out with a needle. And we'II--

343
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:09,788

- 在玩游戏吗，费金？ - 老一套了，亲爱的
-PIaying the game, were we, Fagin? -As is our custom, my dear.

He's got manners, he has. A proper gentleman.

362
00:41:57,864 --> 00:41:59,923
外面太冷了，所以我们才进来
We popped in because we were that cold inside.

363
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:03,694

-Charley. -Come on, OIiver. Join us.

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,170
还是说你不愿意跟普通人坐一块儿？
Or don't you sit with the common folk?

366
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:12,907
你得多加小心，奥利弗
Now, you wanna be careful of this Iot, OIiver.

-They'II have you picking-- -Picking out the marks.

371
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:27,258
你到这儿来，你妈妈会怎么说？
What's your mother got to say about you being here?

372
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,894
我没有妈妈，我是孤儿
I haven't got a mother. I'm an orphan.

373
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:31,586
那你就来对地方了

00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:37,001
来吧，奥利弗，我来教你怎么玩
Come on, OIiver, I'II teach you how to play.

375
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:39,296
这叫做“偷机”
It's called Spec or Speculation.

376
00:42:39,505 --> 00:42:43,032
每人三张牌，他翻过来的那张...
Three cards each, and then the one he turns up...

377
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:45,211

378
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,315
这种日子是不是很快活啊，宝贝儿？
This is a pleasant Iife, ain't it, my dear?

379
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:05,557
- 我什么时候可以出去呢？ - 快了，快了
-When can I go out, sir? -Soon. Soon.

00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:14,865
- 喜欢吗？ - 喜欢，先生
-Would you Iike that? -Oh, yes, sir.

看你能不能在我不注意的情况下...
See if you can take this out...

384
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:21,940
...把它拿出来
...without my feeling it.

385
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:50,506
拿走了吗？
Is it gone?

386
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,447
你真是个聪明的孩子，宝贝儿
You're a clever boy, my dear.

387
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,776
我还没见过更聪明的
I never saw a sharper Iad.

388
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:05,954
这是一个先令，拿去吧
Here's a shilling for you.

389
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,356
跟机灵鬼还有查理学着点
Make the Dodger and Charley your models.

390
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:12,087
特别是机灵鬼，宝贝儿
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

391
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:15,790
他会是个大人物的，你也会
He'II be a great man himself, make you one too.

392
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:17,697
你就这么下去...
You go on this way...

393
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,737
...会成为了不起的大人物
...you'II be the greatest man of the time.

394
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:25,901
非常感谢，先生
Thank you very much, sir.

395

你是说那个宽边的？
You mean that one with the wide rim?

398
00:44:48,634 --> 00:44:50,363
太贵了
Too expensive.

399
00:45:39,886 --> 00:45:42,013
小偷！ 你的手帕，先生
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:56,152
- 是这个孩子吗？ - 恐怕是的
-Is this the boy, sir? -Yes, I'm afraid it is.

419
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,887
回答得真妙啊，“恐怕是的”
That's a good one. Did you hear him, "afraid it is"?

420
00:46:59,098 --> 00:47:02,397
- 可怜的家伙，自己受伤了 - 是的，是我干的，先生
-Poor fellow's hurt himself. -Yeah, I did that, sir.

-Get up! -It wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

423
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:12,109
当然不是，小偷都这么说
Of course it wasn't. It never is.

424
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:13,972
- 起来 - 别伤了他

不，先生，我不会的

- 下一个？ - 这是我的姓名和地址，先生
-What's next? -That is my name and address, sir.

哦，不，不是他，大人
Oh, no, no. He's not charged, Your Worship.

432
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:39,934
他是来指控这个孩子的
He appears against the boy.

433
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:41,731
- 让他发誓 - 在我发誓之前...

434
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,501

437
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,747
- 你竟敢辱骂推事 - 什么？
-How dare you bully a magistrate. -What?

438

让他发誓，我不想听他废话了 让他发誓
Swear this person. I'II not hear another word. Swear him.

-What's the charge against the boy? -I was at a bookstore when--

441
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:05,287
闭嘴！警察呢？
Hold your tongue! Where's the policeman?

442

警官，怎么回事情？ 有证人吗？
Policeman, what is this? Are there any witnesses?

443
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,265
- 没有，大人 - 这孩子在生病

444

是的，恐怕如此

445
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:16,366
过来，小乞丐，别在这里耍花样
Come along, you vagabond. None of your tricks here.

446
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:18,305
你叫什么？
What's your name?

447
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,538
你叫什么，你这个顽固的无赖？
What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?

448

- 警官，他叫什么名字？ - 你叫什么，孩子？
-Officer, what's his name? -What's your name, boy?

449

水，给我水

450
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,285
他的名字叫萨姆・沃特斯，大人

别耍我

不，我想他真的是病了，大人
No, I think he really is ill, Your Worship.

455
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:42,732
我比你清楚，否则我就不姓方
I know better, or my name's not Fang.

456
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:45,062
站到旁边去，他在装死
Stand away, officer. He's shamming.

457

即席判决他劳役三个月

退庭

459
00:48:49,976 --> 00:48:52,274
别，别！ 别带走他
Stop. Stop, stop! Don't take him away.

460
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:55,379
怎么回事？ 这人是谁？ 把他赶出去
What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out.

461
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:59,779
- 退庭 - 我不出去，我有话要说！
-CIear the office. -I will not be turned out! I will speak!

462
00:48:59,986 --> 00:49:02,045
我都看见了，我是书店老板
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

463
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:04,954
- 我要作证 - 你有什么要说的？
-I demand to be heard. -What have you got to say?

464
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:08,092
- 不是那个孩子 - 不是那个孩子？那是谁？
-It was not this boy. -Not this boy? Who was it, then?

465
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:11,286
在那位先生看书的时候 偷他东西的，是另外两个小孩
The robbery was committed by two others while the man was reading.

466
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:14,762
我看见了，看见这孩子都吓呆了
I saw it done. I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed by it.

467
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,264
你为什么不早来？
Why didn't you come before?

468
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:19,996
- 没人帮我看铺子 - 你说看书？
-I hadn't a soul to mind the shop. -Reading, you say?

469
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,798
那么说有书了
A book, I suppose.

470
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,004
是的，就攥在他手上呢
Yes, the very one he has in his hand.

471
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:27,011
天哪，我把这事给忘了
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.

472
00:49:27,213 --> 00:49:28,737
好啊，你也是个好人啊

473
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:32,509
指控无辜的孩子
To prefer a charge against an innocent boy.

474
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:35,750
我猜你是在一种极为可疑...
I consider, sir, that you've obtained that book...

475
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:38,947
...极不光彩的情况下取得这本书的
...under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances.

476
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:40,352
- 该死！ - 店主...
-Damn me! -Bookseller...

477
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,527
...你要指控他吗？
...do you want to press charges against him?

478
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:44,161
- 当然不 - 好吧...
-Certainly not. -Well...

479
00:49:45,364 --> 00:49:46,797
...你是不是觉得挺幸运的...

480
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:49,297
...书的主人拒绝指控你

481
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:50,762
对这孩子的指控取消
The boy is discharged.

482
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,164
- 退庭 - 岂有此理

483
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:54,703
退庭！ 退庭！

What's become of the boy? Speak out, or I'II throttle you!

506
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,666

The traps have got him! Let go of me, will you?!

507

508
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:17,420
谁扔的？谁往我头上扔的？

00:51:30,503 --> 00:51:34,030
怎么了，费金？ 又虐待这些孩子了？
What you up to, Fagin? III-treating the boys again?

513
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:38,139
我奇怪他们怎么还没杀了你 如果换了是我，早动手了
A wonder they don't murder you. I would, if I was them.

514
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:42,075
别这么大声，你似乎不高兴，比尔
Don't speak so Ioud. You seem out of sorts, Bill.

515

Give us a drink. And mind you don't poison it.

516
00:51:45,017 --> 00:51:46,746
查理

517
00:51:47,253 --> 00:51:49,346
好东西，比尔
Good stuff, Bill.

518
00:51:50,856 --> 00:51:52,255
机灵鬼...
So, Dodger...

519
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:55,256
- ...这是唱的哪一出啊？ - 一个新来的孩子

...I'm afraid he may say something which will get us into trouble.

523
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,805
你要被告发了，费金
You were blowed upon, Fagin.

524

...it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.

527
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,316
那只能这么着了
There's only one thing for it.

528
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,921
得找人到局子里去看看 看看他怎么样了
Somebody's gotta find out at the office what's being done to him.

529
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:27,092
总得有人去
Somebody's gotta get hold of him somehow.

530
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:30,456
我才不愿意靠近警察局呢 为谁都不去
I ain't going near no police office. Not for nobody, nohow.

531
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:33,663
我有主意了，贝特会去的
I have it, the very thing. Bet will go.

532
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:36,426
- 是不是啊，亲爱的？ - 如果我去的话，会遭雷劈的
-Won't you, my dear? -I'm blessed if I will.

533
00:52:36,635 --> 00:52:38,398
南希，亲爱的，你说呢？
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

534
00:52:38,604 --> 00:52:41,664
不行，你这套把戏行不通，费金
It won't do. There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.

535
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:43,637
- 你那是什么意思？ - 我说过了
-What do you mean by that? -What I say.

536
00:52:43,843 --> 00:52:45,743
你是最合适的
Why, you're just the very person for it.

537
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:47,776
这儿没人认识你
Nobody about here knows anything about you.

538
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,574
我也不想让他们认识
And as I don't want them to neither.

539
00:52:50,783 --> 00:52:52,978
我也不会同意的，比尔
It's rather more "no" than "yes" with me, Bill.

540
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:55,244
- 她会去的，费金 - 不，她不会，费金
-She'II go, Fagin. -No, she won't, Fagin.

541
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:57,445
她会去的，费金
Yes, she will, Fagin.

542
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:11,735
- 需要效劳吗，女士？ - 我在找我的弟弟
-Can I help you, miss? -I'm Iooking for my Iittle brother.

543
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:14,963
- 他是谁啊？ - 一个可爱的小男孩
-Now, who would he be? -A Iovely Iittle boy.

544
00:53:15,174 --> 00:53:18,405
很文雅，很有礼貌
Lovely manners. Gentle as falling snow.

545
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:21,276
不在我们这里
We don't get many of those.

546
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,108
也许你该试试方先生的法庭
I think you'II be wanting Mr. Fang's court.

547
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:33,787
乔治，这位年轻女士要找她的弟弟
George, this here young Iady is Iooking for her brother.

548
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,018
那个昏倒，后来走掉的
The one that fainted and got away with it.

549
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:38,526
是啊，被一位先生带走了
Oh, yeah. Gentleman took him away.

550
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,859
什么先生？老天爷啊，什么先生？
What gentleman? Gracious heavens, what gentleman?

551
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:44,661
我想是住在本顿维尔
Well, Iives in Pentonville, I believe.

552
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,168
哦，老天
Oh, my God.

553
00:53:47,706 --> 00:53:49,765
不，不，等等，等等
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,375
他还有张名片在这里
His card's here somewhere.

555
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:54,874
给
Here we are.

556
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:03,881
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

557
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,178
布朗罗先生
Mr. Brownlow.

558
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,477
布朗罗先生
Mr. Brownlow.

559
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:37,008
他身上有种东西...
There's something in him...

560
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:40,117
...触动了我，贝德温太太
...that touched my heart, Mrs. Bedwin.

561
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,344
说不清楚
Can't explain it.

562
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:45,318
我也有这种感觉，先生
I feel the same, sir.

563
00:55:45,524 --> 00:55:47,549
他是谁？干什么的？
Who is he? What is he?

564
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,523
你对他一无所知
You know nothing of him.

565
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:51,855
他发烧了，那又怎么了？
He had a fever. What of that?

566
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,788
坏人也会发烧的
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

567
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,798
我知道在牙买加有个家伙 因为谋杀主人而被绞死
I knew a man in Jamaica who was hanged for murdering his master.

568
00:55:58,003 --> 00:56:00,198
他发过6次烧
He had a fever six times.

569
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:03,565
- 我知道他身上有善良的品质 - 你怎么知道的？
-I know there is goodness in him. -How do you know it?

570
00:56:03,776 --> 00:56:05,300
善良和无辜
Goodness and innocence.

571
00:56:05,811 --> 00:56:08,336
- 我第一眼看到他就知道了 - 他会骗人的
-I knew it the first moment I saw him. -He'II deceive you.

572
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:10,481
一有机会就会让你失望...
Let you down at the first opportunity...

573
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:13,345
...就像你以前做的那些善事一样
...Iike all your other good and innocent causes.

574
00:56:13,552 --> 00:56:18,080
如果那孩子是善良无辜的 我就把自己的脑袋吃了，先生
If that boy's good and innocent, I'II eat my own head, sir.

575
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:29,162
感觉如果，亲爱的？
How do you feel, my dear?

576
00:56:29,368 --> 00:56:31,063
很高兴，先生
Very happy, sir.

577
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,229
- 非常感谢您，先生 - 好孩子
-And very grateful to you indeed, sir. -Good boy.

578
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:39,972
有没有给他吃过东西了 贝德温？吃过流食了吗？
Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops?

579
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:43,080
不是流食，先生，是肉汤
Not slops, sir. Broth.

580
00:56:43,716 --> 00:56:45,240
还有几杯葡萄酒...
A couple of glasses of port wine...

581
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:48,011
...对他的身体大有好处
...would have done him a great deal more good.

582
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,279
是吗，萨姆？
Wouldn't they, Sam?

583
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:52,457
我叫奥利弗，先生
My name is OIiver, sir.

584
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:54,489
奥利弗？
OIiver?

585
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:58,724
- 奥利弗什么？奥利弗・沃特斯？ - 不，先生，忒斯特，奥利弗・忒斯特
-OIiver what? OIiver Waters? -No, sir. Twist. OIiver Twist.

586
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:02,363
你为什么告诉推事，你叫沃特斯？
Why did you tell the magistrate your name was Waters?

587
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:04,433
我没这么告诉他，先生
I never told him so, sir.

588
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:08,272
- 你没有？ - 没有，先生
-You did not? -No, sir.

589
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:13,773
- 你不是在生我的气吧，先生？ - 不，没有
-You're not angry with me, are you? -No, no.

590
00:57:14,913 --> 00:57:16,471
奇怪的名字
Queer name.

591
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:17,910
奥利弗・忒斯特
OIiver Twist.

592
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:23,245
这里的书很多吧，孩子？
There are a great many books, are there not, my boy?

593
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,650
是非常多，先生
A great number, sir.

594
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:28,088
从来没看过这么多
Never saw so many.

595
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:32,793
你想长大成为一个智者...
How would you Iike to grow up a clever man...

596
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:34,966
...撰写书籍吗？
...and write books?

597
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,692
我宁可读书，先生
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

598
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:40,633
为什么不想当作家呢？
Wouldn't you Iike to be a book writer?

599
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,401
我想做一个卖书的也许更好，先生
I think it'd be a better thing to be a bookseller, sir.

600
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:50,971
你说得真不错
You have said a very good thing.

601
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:52,645
好吧
Well, well.

602
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:56,252
我们不会把你培养成作家 只要学门正当的手艺就行
We won't make an author of you while there's an honest trade to be Iearned...

603
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:58,616
...或者去学制砖
...or brickmaking to turn to.

604
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:02,123
- 你是要赶我走吗，先生？ - 不，我亲爱的孩子
-Are you going to send me away, sir? -No, my dear child.

605
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:05,057
你不必担心我抛弃你...
You need not be afraid that I am going to desert you...

606
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:07,732
- ...除非你给我这么做的理由 - 不会的，永远都不会，先生
-...unless you give me cause. -I never, never will, sir.

607
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,127
希望如此...
I hope not...

608
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:12,201
...因为我非常愿意相信你 我为此也感到奇怪
...because I feel strongly disposed to trust you.

609
00:58:12,404 --> 00:58:13,666
谢谢，先生
Thank you, sir.

610
00:58:23,182 --> 00:58:25,343
我很高兴不用再穿这些了
I'm pleased I won't have to wear those again.

611
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:27,280
我们也很高兴，亲爱的
So are we all, my dear.

612
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:31,450
给
There.

613
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,111
您们好
Hello.

614
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:31,976
他是谁啊？
What's that?

615
00:59:32,184 --> 00:59:34,049
这是小奥利弗・忒斯特
This is young OIiver Twist.

616
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:35,914
书店的伙计拿来一个包裹
The bookseller's boy brought a package.

617
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:39,613
哦，追上他，奥利弗 我还有些书要还回去
Oh, stop him, OIiver. There's some books to go back.

618
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:42,707
- 他就是那个得了感冒的孩子？ - 没错，就是
-Is that the boy who had the fever? -That's the boy.

619
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,199
当心点！
Mind out!

620
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:13,874
- 先生，没看到他 - 噢，真让人难过
-No sign of him, sir. -Oh, dear, I'm very sorry for that.

621
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,514
有几本书我很想今晚就还了
I particularly wished some books to be returned tonight.

622
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:20,413
为什么不让奥立弗去？ 让他去绝送对不会出问题
Why not send OIiver with them? He'II be sure to deliver them safely.

623
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,053
是的，您就交给我吧
Yes, do Iet me take them.

624
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:25,383
先生，如果你愿意的话，我可以跑过去
If you please, sir. I'II run all the way.

625
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,401
去吧，亲爱的
You shall go, my dear.

626
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:37,627
让贝德温太太告诉你怎么走
Ask Mrs. Bedwin to show you the way.

627
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:41,466
- 等等，奥立弗 - 是的，先生
-And, OIiver.... -Yes, sir?

628
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:44,508
把这个给书店老板
Give the bookseller this.

629
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,007
我欠他的钱
The money I owe him.

630
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:58,319
我马上回来,先生
I won't be Iong, sir.

631
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,919
- 你觉得这一去要多长时间？ - 你真觉得他会回来吗？
-How Iong do you think it'II take him? -You really expect him to come back?

632
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:08,361
- 你觉得不会？ - 带着5英镑？
-You don't? -With a ￡5 note in his pocket?

633
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:10,229
不，我不相信
No, I do not.

634
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,499
如果那个孩子回来的话...
If ever that boy returns to this house...

635
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:15,732
...我把自己的头吃掉，先生
...I'II eat my own head, sir.

636
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:18,371
还有你的头
And yours.

637
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,296
噢，弟弟！
Oh, my Iittle brother!

638
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:40,560
- 我没看错吧？ - 放开我，救命！
-I don't believe my eyes. -Let me go. Help!

639
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:44,635
- 上天有眼啊，我找到他了！ - 放开我！
-It's a miracle. Oh, I've found him. -PIease Iet me go.

640
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:47,602
- 噢，奥立弗，奥立弗 - 南希
-Oh, OIiver. OIiver. -Nancy.

641
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:51,140
你太调皮了，为了你我受了多少苦啊
You're such a naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your account.

642
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,437
- 放开我！ - 小姐，这是怎么回事？
-Let go of me! -What's the matter, ma'am?

643
01:01:53,647 --> 01:01:55,376
他离家出走了
He ran away from his parents.

644
01:01:55,582 --> 01:01:57,846
- 放开我！ - 他们勤勤恳恳、受人敬重...
-Get off me! -Hard-working, respectable people...

645
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:00,611
...而他倒和一帮小贼和坏蛋混在一起
...and joined a set of thieves and bad characters.

646
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,117
他妈妈的心可伤透了
Broke his mother's heart.

647
01:02:02,322 --> 01:02:04,790
- 可怜的孩子 - 回家吧，你这个小混蛋
Young wretch. Go home, you Iittle brute.

648
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:06,458
我没有爸妈！
I haven't got any parents.

649
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,423
我是孤儿！ 我住在本顿维尔
I'm an orphan. I Iive in Pentonville.

650
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:10,823
噢，别听他的，这也敢说啊
Oh, only hear him, how he braves it out.

651
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:13,261
- 什么？小奥立弗 - 是真的
-What? Young OIiver. -It's true.

652
01:02:15,268 --> 01:02:17,259
回到你可怜的妈妈身边去！
You come home to your poor mother.

653
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,530
他们不能管我！我不认识他们！ 救命啊！救命！
I don't belong to them! I don't know them! Help! Help!

654
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,934
“救命，救命”？
"Help, help"?

655
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:25,407
我来救你的命，你个小混蛋！
I'II give you "help, help," you Iittle wretch!

656
01:02:25,612 --> 01:02:27,170
这些书哪来的？
And these books.

657
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,076
是你偷来的？对吗？
Have you been a-stealing them, have you, eh?

658
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:33,719
- 你这个小混蛋 - 就是，你要好好教训他
-You Iittle villain. -That's right. You give it to him.

659
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,151
- 否则他还是不懂事 - 我会的，夫人
-Only way to bring him to his senses. -I will, missus.

660
01:02:37,357 --> 01:02:39,120
跟我走，你这个小混蛋
And you come with me, you Iittle wretch.

661
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:41,021
这样对他有好处
It'II do him good.

662
01:02:41,227 --> 01:02:43,695
- 这个男人是谁？救命啊！ - 大牛，看着他，好样的
-Who is this man? Help! -Bullseye, mind him, boy.

663
01:02:43,897 --> 01:02:46,365
- 看着他 - 救命，救命！
-Mind him. -Help! Help!

664
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,801
你看看他，费金
Look at him, Fagin.

665
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:52,198
谁来扶我一下
Hold me, somebody.

666
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:54,965
谁来扶我一下，我要笑歪了
Hold me, somebody, while I Iaugh it out.

667
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:57,268
你看他穿的，费金
Look at his togs, Fagin.

668
01:02:57,477 --> 01:03:00,105
很高兴看到你这么好，亲爱的
Delighted to see you Iooking so well, my dear.

669
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:02,941
为什么不提前写封信，说你要来啊？
Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you was coming?

670
01:03:03,149 --> 01:03:06,277
那样我们就可以弄点热菜晚上吃了
We'd have got something warm for supper.

671
01:03:06,486 --> 01:03:09,182
- 你好啊，费金，那是什么？ - 那是我的，费金
Hello, Fagin. What's that? That's mine, Fagin.

672
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:12,051
不不，亲爱的，那是我的，比尔，我的 那些书你拿去吧
Oh, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.

673
01:03:12,258 --> 01:03:14,920
如果你不给我和南希，那我就把孩子带回去
If that ain't mine and Nancy's, I'II take the boy back again.

674
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:16,390
来吧，拿过来
Come on, hand over, will you?

675
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:18,723
这太不公平了吧，比尔 不公平啊，南希
This is hardly fair, Bill. Hardly fair, Nancy.

676
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:22,333
我才不管公不公平，给我拿过来
Fair or not fair, hand over, I tell you.

677
01:03:22,535 --> 01:03:26,096
拿过来，你这个贪心的老骨头，拿来！
Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton. Give it here!

678
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:29,503
你给我们带来这么多麻烦 再拿这么多来都不够还！
That's for our share of the trouble, and not half enough neither.

679
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:33,379
如果你喜欢读书就留着吧，要么就卖掉
You may keep the books if you're fond of reading. If you ain't, sell them.

680
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,639
这些书真漂亮啊 字也很漂亮，是吗，奥立弗？
They're very pretty. Beautiful writing, isn't it, OIiver?

681
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:40,843
要送回去，这些书是布朗罗先生的！
Send them back. They belong to Mr. Brownlow.

682
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:42,885
这些书和钱都要送回去
Send them back. The books and the money.

683
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:44,817
他会以为是我偷了的
He'II think I stole them.

684
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:46,822
- 求你了，送回去吧 - 这孩子说的没错
-PIease send them back. -The boy's right.

685
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:50,588
没错，奥立弗，没错 他们会认为是你偷的
You're right, OIiver. You're right. They will think you've stolen them.

686
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:54,489
真是太好了，事情真是巧啊
It couldn't have happened better if we'd chosen our time.

687
01:03:54,701 --> 01:03:56,601
救命啊，警察！
Help! Help! Police!

688
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:59,101
叫警察？让你叫！
Fetch the police! The police!

689
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:02,398
管住这条狗，比尔 孩子会被它咬成几块的
Keep back the dog, Bill. He'II tear the boy to pieces.

690
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:05,510
- 那是活该 - 救命！叫警察！
-Serve him right. -Help! Fetch the police!

691
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:07,707
叫警察！
Fetch the police!

692
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:10,212
走开，否则我把你的头劈成两半！
Step aside, or I'II split your head against the wall.

693
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,509
我不在乎
I don't care.

694
01:04:11,718 --> 01:04:15,210
我不会让那条狗把孩子咬死 除非你先杀了我
That child shan't be torn down by the dog unless you kill me first.

695
01:04:17,123 --> 01:04:19,956
大牛，来，大牛！
Bullseye. Here. Bullseye!

696
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,000
机灵鬼！
Dodger!

697
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:31,834
跟着他！
Get after him!

698
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:37,869
放开我！
Take your hands off me!

699
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:11,909
你想逃吗，亲爱的？
So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?

700
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:14,376
想报警，对吗？
Wanted to call for the police, did you?

701
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,311
我们待会儿会好好治治你
We'II soon cure you of that.

702
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:21,752
我不能眼睁睁的看着你这样做，费金
I won't stand by and see this done, Fagin.

703
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:23,889
孩子你已经抓到了，你还想怎么样？
You got the boy. What more do you want?

704
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,150
别出声，南希 否则我会叫你以后都说不出话来
Keep quiet, Nancy, or I'II quieten you for a good Iong time to come.

705
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,328
就让他这样好了，随他去！
Let him be. Let him be!

706
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:31,724
你还真要做这孩子的好朋友啊
You're a fine one for the boy to make a friend of.

707
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,956
老天为证，我就是这样
God AImighty help me, I am.

708
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:37,603
他偷东西、撒谎、讨人厌，也就这样了
He's a thief, a Iiar, a devil, all that's bad from this night forth.

709
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:40,295
你这个老头还嫌打他不够吗？
Ain't that enough for the old wretch without blows?

710
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:43,408
好了，好了 我们讲话要文明点，文明点
Come, come, we must have civil words. Civil words.

711
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,909
文明？ 你跟我说文明？你这个老鬼！
Civil words? Civil words, you old villain!

712
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,946
我打小孩时起就帮你偷东西 还没有他一半岁数呢
I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this.

713
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,617
你总要活命吧
It's your Iiving.

714
01:05:51,818 --> 01:05:55,015
没错，是你这个老鬼逼我这样的
Yes, and you're the wretch that drove me to it...

715
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:59,385
让我走上这条路 日日夜夜，直到死为止！
...and who will keep me at it, day and night, till I die!

716
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:05,861
机灵鬼，查理，让奥立弗去睡吧
Dodger, Charley, put OIiver to bed.

717
01:06:06,065 --> 01:06:08,693
最好把那些衣服脱掉 穿这么好去睡觉太不像话了
Best to take them clothes off. They're too good to sleep in.

718
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:12,338
查理说得对 这套衣服要4个半便士呢
Charley's right. This here suit cost more than 4 pence ha'penny.

719
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:15,804
我从来没摸过这么舒服的料子 你呢，机灵鬼？
I never felt such Iovely stuff. Have you, Dodger?

720
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,141
我没穿过，不过我敢打赌...
Not me. But I'm willing to Iay odds...

721
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:21,905
...女王穿的衣服就是用这个料子的
...this is the same stuff the queen wears on Sundays.

722
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:25,975
快，抓住他
Quick, get him.

723
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,120
脱掉
Take it off.

724
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:32,051
把他抬起来
Lift him up.

725
01:06:32,258 --> 01:06:34,522
好了
Up he goes.

726
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:39,191
脱鞋子
Get them shoes off.

727
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:17,601
吃点午饭吧，亲爱的？
Little something for your Iuncheon, my dear?

728
01:07:34,787 --> 01:07:36,550
我们聊一会，好吗？
Shall we have a Iittle chat?

729
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:39,454
奥立弗？
OIiver?

730
01:07:39,692 --> 01:07:41,455
好不好？
Shall us?

731
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:46,588
我觉得你这么久没听过人说话...
I expect you'd welcome...

732
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:51,600
...应该会喜欢听到才对啊 对吗，亲爱的？
...the sound of a human voice again, eh, my dear?

733
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:58,506
你知不知道...
Do you know...

734
01:07:59,045 --> 01:08:03,379
...我觉得世上最大的罪过是什么，亲爱的？
...what I consider the greatest sin in the world, my dear?

735
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:07,012
忘恩负义
Ingratitude.

736
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:10,883
也就是你所犯的罪过...
And that's what you're guilty of...

737
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,149
...忘恩负义
...ingratitude.

738
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:16,726
我们带你回来，爱你 要不是我们，你早就饿死了
We took you in, we cherished you. If we hadn't, you'd have died of hunger.

739
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:18,590
你怎么报答我们呢？ 你逃跑了…
How do you repay us? You run away...

740
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:24,134
...还跑去叫警察 你让我们担心，还花费了不少
...you cry out for the police, you cause us great anxiety and expense.

741
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:31,275
过去也有个小家伙，很像你 我对他就像他爸爸一样好
There was a Iad once, just Iike you, and I was a father to him.

742
01:08:31,477 --> 01:08:33,945
可是他和你一样，也逃跑了 他确实找到了警察
He ran away, Iike you. He indeed went to the police.

743
01:08:34,147 --> 01:08:37,139
你知道他落得什么下场吗？
And can you guess how he ended up?

744
01:08:39,952 --> 01:08:42,420
他被吊死了...
They hanged him...

745
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:45,147
...就在老城法庭
...at the OId Bailey.

746
01:08:45,825 --> 01:08:50,762
我们提供了一些证据，虽然不全是真的...
Certain evidence was made available, not all of it precisely true...

747
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:55,590
...但足以保证我自己...
...but all of it necessary to provide for my own safety...

748
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,565
...和我朋友的安全
...and that of my friends.

749
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,534
就是这样，可怜的孩子
Yeah. Poor boy.

750
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,108
被吊死了
Hanged.

751
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:06,008
绞刑很吓人的，奥立弗
It's a terrible thing, hanging, OIiver.

752
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:08,339
天刚亮，在绞刑架上...
Dawn, the gallows...

753
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:10,846
...有绳子、有套索
...the rope, the noose.

754
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,348
你不一定要有罪，对吧，奥立弗
You don't always have to be guilty, you see, OIiver.

755
01:09:13,553 --> 01:09:15,214
这年头他们要吊死你可不讲什么道理
They hang you for anything these days.

756
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:18,356
因为他们很喜欢吊人
That's because they're so very fond of hanging.

757
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,267
但是如果你按我说的做...
But if you do as you're told...

758
01:09:30,803 --> 01:09:33,829
...我们还会是好朋友的
...we'II be very good friends yet.

759
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:46,578
奥立弗，你可以到处走走了
You must feel free to walk about now, OIiver.

760
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:49,911
没错，随便哪里
Yes, feel free.

761
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:00,398
- 来这里，奥立弗 - 什么事？
-Here, OIiver. -Yes?

762
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:03,697
你马上过来，为我打扮打扮
I'd Iike you to assist me in my toilet straightaway.

763
01:10:04,771 --> 01:10:08,764
- 可以帮一下忙吗，小伙子？ - 没问题，我我希望有人陪陪
-Will you do that for me, my man? -AII right. I'II be glad to have company.

764
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:13,412
这才是好小子嘛 来，先为我脚套上光
There's a good fellow. You may start by japanning my trotter-cases.

765
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:16,081
简单点说，就是帮我擦擦鞋
In plain English, clean my boots.

766
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:22,420
真可惜，他不是个三只手
What a pity he ain't a prig.

767
01:10:22,622 --> 01:10:25,022
他不知道什么才是好的
He don't know what's good for him.

768
01:10:25,224 --> 01:10:26,919
我看你不知道什么是三只手吧？
I suppose you don't know what a prig is.

769
01:10:27,126 --> 01:10:29,356
我知道的，三只手是....
Yes, I do. It's a....

770
01:10:29,562 --> 01:10:32,190
就是贼
It's a thief.

771
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:33,888
你就是三只手，对吗？
You're one, aren't you?

772
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,830
对，我是，我们都是 连那条狗都是...
Yes, I am. And so we all are. Down to the dog...

773
01:10:37,036 --> 01:10:38,799
...那狗摸起来舒服到家了
...and he's the downiest one of the Iot.

774
01:10:39,005 --> 01:10:40,973
它也从来不会告密
And the Ieast given to peaching.

775
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:43,199
最多只会在证人席上吠两下...
He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness box...

776
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:48,176
- ...也不敢说主人坏话 - 它可是地地道道的基督教徒呢
-...for fear of committing himself. -He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

777
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:50,906
你为什么要跟着费金，奥立弗？
Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, OIiver?

778
01:10:51,117 --> 01:10:52,948
否则你会立即发大财的
You'II make a fortune out of hand.

779
01:10:53,152 --> 01:10:56,986
像本顿维尔的老先生家，就是那个大房子
Like your old gentleman in Pentonville. Big house, that.

780
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:00,421
我偷偷看过里面，很漂亮嘛，对吧？
I had a peep at it, I did. Nice inside, was it?

781
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:05,029
是的，我还睡过真正的床，有自己的房间
Yes. And I slept in a proper bed. In my own room.

782
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:08,826
- 墙上的东西也不错，对吧？ - 确实是
-Good stuff on the walls, eh? -Yes. Indeed.

783
01:11:09,035 --> 01:11:10,502
根在费金后面...
Put yourself under Fagin...

784
01:11:10,703 --> 01:11:14,161
...你就没有那样的好房子啦
...and you'II be able to retire to a property just Iike that.

785
01:11:14,373 --> 01:11:16,341
也不能像以前那么风光了
And do the genteel.

786
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,601
不，他害怕，怕挨绳圈子
No, he's scared he'II come to be scragged.

787
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:20,369
我不知道你说什么
I don't know what that means.

788
01:11:24,851 --> 01:11:27,479
如果你不拿手帕和手表，诺利...
If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs and watches, Nolly...

789
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:31,014
...还有别的家伙会去拿 你会做的，别人也会做
...some other cove will. You have the same right to them as they have.

790
01:11:31,224 --> 01:11:33,954
当然啦，当然啦
To be sure. To be sure.

791
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,890
道理很简单，亲爱的，很简单
It all Iies in a nutshell, my dear, in a nutshell.

792
01:11:37,096 --> 01:11:38,393
要相信机灵鬼的话
Take the Dodger's word for it.

793
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:41,533
他可是相当懂行的
He understands the catechism of his trade.

794
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:54,877
车夫？
Cabby?

795
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:17,826
- 我从比尔哪儿来 - 为什么？
-I've come from Bill. -For what?

796
01:12:18,037 --> 01:12:21,529
- 反正不是坏事 - 我不信
-For no harm. -I don't believe it.

797
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,973
我要是能帮你的话早就帮了，就是没能力
If I could help you, I would, but I've not the power.

798
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:29,045
我答应过他要让你乖点，安静点
Now, I've promised him you'II be good and silent.

799
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:32,183
否则，你只会给自己添麻烦
If you're not, you'II only do yourself harm.

800
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:34,353
还给我添麻烦
And me too.

801
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:45,827
他没闹吧？
Did he come quiet?

802
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:48,023
像只小羊羔一样乖
Like a Iamb.

803
01:12:50,236 --> 01:12:52,067
坐下
Sit down.

804
01:12:56,809 --> 01:12:59,903
我来给你上一课
And Iet me read you a Iecture.

805
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:07,549
你知道这是什么吗？
You know what this is?

806
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:11,582
- 知道 - 好的
-Yes. -Well, then.

807
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:17,625
这是火药
This is powder.

808
01:13:25,237 --> 01:13:26,431
这是子弹
That here's a bullet.

809
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:33,307
这是从旧帽子上取下的一小块...
And this is a Iittle bit of an old hat...

810
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:35,570
...用来做弹塞
...for wadding.

811
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:46,320
- 这样就上好膛了 - 是的，我看到了，先生
-Now it's Ioaded. -Yes, I can see it is, sir.

812
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:49,359
我们出去的时候，除非我要跟你讲话...
If you speak a word when you're out of doors with me...

813
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:51,496
...如果你敢自己说一句话...
...unless I speak to you...

814
01:13:51,697 --> 01:13:54,894
...这颗子弹就立马钻进你脑袋里
...this Ioading will go in your head without notice.

815
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:58,798
就是说，如果你决定擅自开口说话...
So if you do make up your mind to speak without Ieave...

816
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:00,597
...那就先把祷告做了吧
...says your prayers first.

817
01:14:01,507 --> 01:14:04,670
让我明说了吧，你就是想说 要是让他搞砸了...
The short and Iong of what you mean is that if you're crossed by him...

818
01:14:04,877 --> 01:14:06,970
...你就会让他脑袋吃一颗子弹...
...you'II prevent him from telling tales after...

819
01:14:07,179 --> 01:14:09,113
...不让他把事情抖出去
...by shooting him through the head.

820
01:14:09,315 --> 01:14:11,681
这样你就碰上好运气，不用被吊死了
And you'II take your chance of swinging for it.

821
01:14:11,884 --> 01:14:15,445
没错，女人总是三两句话就能把事情说清楚
That's it. Women always put things in the fewest words.

822
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:17,747
晚饭，南希
Supper, Nancy.

823
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:20,118
动手前打会盹儿
And then a snooze afore starting.

824
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:51,615
好哥们，比尔
My pal Bill.

825
01:14:51,824 --> 01:14:54,486
门没关，进来吧
The door's open, come in.

826
01:14:56,595 --> 01:14:59,120
别嚷那么大声！
Don't make such a row.

827
01:15:02,468 --> 01:15:03,935
点盏灯，托比
Show us a glim, Toby.

828
01:15:04,136 --> 01:15:07,367
巴尼，点灯，带这位先生进来
Barney, a glim. Show the gentleman in.

829
01:15:07,707 --> 01:15:12,337
巴尼？起来啊，帮帮忙
Barney? Wake up first, if convenient.

830
01:15:23,656 --> 01:15:26,420
塞克斯先生，请进，请进
Mr. Sykes. Come in, sir, come in.

831
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:48,044
比尔，老兄，很高兴看到你
Bill, my boy. GIad to see you.

832
01:15:49,749 --> 01:15:51,683
这是...？
Who's...?

833
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,784
- 这是谁？ - 就是那个孩子
-Who's this? -Only the boy.

834
01:15:53,986 --> 01:15:57,251
- 费金先生的徒弟？ - 没错，时候到了
-One of Mr. Fagin's Iads? -Yeah. It's time.

835
01:15:57,456 --> 01:15:59,151
没错
Right.

836
01:16:00,493 --> 01:16:01,824
拿炮筒子来，巴尼
Barkers for me, Barney.

837
01:16:11,036 --> 01:16:13,630
- 上了膛的 - 好的
-They're Ioaded. -Good.

838
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:24,473
- 你的家伙呢？ - 拿好了
-The persuaders? -Got them.

839
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:30,384
钥匙、钻头
Keys, center bits.

840
01:16:34,794 --> 01:16:36,989
黑皮灯
Darkies.

841
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,674
没漏掉什么吧？
Nothing forgotten?

842
01:17:00,519 --> 01:17:02,578
好了，没声音了
Yeah, it's all quiet.

843
01:17:52,938 --> 01:17:55,998
不行的，不行的
I can't. I can't.

844
01:17:56,342 --> 01:17:58,037
你得去
You will.

845
01:17:58,244 --> 01:17:59,677
是布朗罗先生的房子
It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

846
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:31,238
求你了，别让我头他家的东西
Have mercy. Don't make me steal from him.

847
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:33,843
- 求求你了 - 来这儿
-Have mercy on me. -Come here.

848
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:36,412
看在上帝的份上，让我跑掉，死在田里算了
For God's sake, Iet me run away and die in the fields.

849
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:39,982
- 我再也不到伦敦来了 - 闭嘴
-I'II never come near London, never. -Shut it.

850
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:44,144
站起来，否则我让你脑浆溅到草地上去
Get up. Or I'II strew your brains on the grass.

851
01:19:24,763 --> 01:19:26,924
我把你放进去
I'm putting you through there.

852
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:29,930
你到前门去，把门开了
Go to the front door and unfasten it.

853
01:19:30,602 --> 01:19:33,901
不行，上面有门闩，我知道我够不着
I can't, there's a bolt at the top. I know it, I can't reach it.

854
01:19:34,106 --> 01:19:38,202
- 那就找张椅子什么的站上去 - 去啊
-Well, stand on a chair or something. -Just do it.

855
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,692
往前门去 往前门走啊，混帐
To the door. To the front door, damn you.

856
01:20:40,072 --> 01:20:41,266
谁啊？
Who's there?

857
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,510
贝德温太太？是你吗？
Mrs. Bedwin? Is that you?

858
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:01,817
过来，过来
Come here. Come here.

859
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:07,264
救我！救我！看在上帝的份上，救我！
Save me! Save me! Save me, for God's sake!

860
01:21:15,941 --> 01:21:17,533
救命
Help!

861
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:21,976
救命！警察！
Help! Police!

862
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:33,053
抬上来
Give him here.

863
01:21:39,098 --> 01:21:40,963
该死的，他流了这么多血
Oh, damnation, how he bleeds.

864
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,896
- 他伤得重吗？ - 应该让他伤得更重些
-Is he hit bad? -He's gotta be hit worse.

865
01:21:49,908 --> 01:21:51,432
- 把手枪给我 - 什么？
-Give me a pistol. -What?

866
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:54,969
我们得灭了他，免得他通风报信
We gotta get rid of him, or he'II squeal.

867
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,080
我们得干掉他
We gotta do him in.

868
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:00,475
这，就在河边这
Here, here. Down here by the river.

869
01:22:00,686 --> 01:22:03,553
但是，比尔！比尔！
But, Bill! Bill!

870
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:08,983
- 比尔？ - 救命啊！
-Bill? -Help!

871
01:22:09,194 --> 01:22:11,992
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

872
01:22:12,865 --> 01:22:15,959
- 比尔 - 救命！
-Bill. -Help!

873
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:25,701
拍
Snap.

874
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:28,940
拍
Snap.

875
01:22:30,516 --> 01:22:32,143
拍
Snap.

876
01:22:34,953 --> 01:22:36,545
拍
Snap.

877
01:22:39,124 --> 01:22:40,682
拍
Snap.

878
01:22:54,473 --> 01:22:56,407
好吗？
Well, well.

879
01:22:56,608 --> 01:22:58,166
你好吗，老费？
How are you, Fagey?

880
01:23:00,078 --> 01:23:03,479
走开，你们走开！比尔呢？
Scarce. Scarce! Where's Bill?

881
01:23:03,682 --> 01:23:05,946
- 他在流血 - 发生什么事了？
-He's-- He's bleeding. -What happened?

882
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:08,676
我会马上告诉你
AII in good time.

883
01:23:08,887 --> 01:23:12,618
不过我没吃饱喝足是不会谈正事的
I can't talk business till I've ate and drank.

884
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:22,059
南希，我说过了，走开，走开！
Nancy, I said, scarce. Scarce!

885
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:23,461
比尔哪去了？
Where's Bill?

886
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:25,728
赶快弄点吃的去，劳你大驾
Well, produce the sustenance, if you please.

887
01:23:25,938 --> 01:23:27,803
机灵鬼！
Dodger!

888
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,200
南希，走开！
Nancy, scarce!

889
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:38,573
- 计划泡汤了 - 我也猜到了
-The crack failed. -I smelt that.

890
01:23:38,784 --> 01:23:41,548
我最后问这一次，比尔哪里去了？
For the Iast time of asking, where's Bill?

891
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:45,116
机灵鬼
Dodger.

892
01:23:48,026 --> 01:23:51,052
扶他上床，给他喝口酒
Put him to bed, give him a nip of gin.

893
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:01,064
这小子差点就害死我们啦，老费
The boy was about to blow on us, Fagey.

894
01:24:01,373 --> 01:24:03,534
- 他被发现了 - 发现了？
-He was seen. -Seen?

895
01:24:03,742 --> 01:24:06,370
他被发现了？谁发现他了？
He was seen? Who saw him?

896
01:24:06,712 --> 01:24:09,237
两个老东西，他喊出声来了
Two old ones. He shouted out.

897
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:11,643
比尔傻掉了，开了枪
Bill Iost his head, fired his pistol....

898
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,318
- 打中了这孩子？ - 不知道，当时开了两枪
-And hit the boy? -I don't know. There was two shots.

899
01:24:14,519 --> 01:24:16,885
比尔只开了一枪
Only one was Bill's.

900
01:24:17,089 --> 01:24:20,547
我们只好逃命，我抱住这孩子，比尔跌倒了
We made a run for it. I had ahold of the boy, and Bill fell.

901
01:24:20,759 --> 01:24:22,488
跌倒了？他有没有受伤？
Fell? Was he hurt?

902
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:26,130
没有，后来他是游回伦敦的呢
No. Last seen, he was swimming to London.

903
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:30,969
大牛
Bullseye.

904
01:24:34,072 --> 01:24:36,370
我跟你说过的，不要带任何人进来
I told you not to bring a soul here.

905
01:24:36,575 --> 01:24:38,600
你现在倒把这个魔鬼带来了
Now you've brought the devil.

906
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:41,176
你叫我带他来的
You said to fetch him.

907
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,144
他脑子烧过了头，什么都记不得了
His fever is that high, he don't remember nothing.

908
01:24:44,349 --> 01:24:47,978
你很不舒服，对吗，比尔? 今天身体怎么样啊？
You're not well, are you, Bill? How do you feel today?

909
01:24:48,186 --> 01:24:50,313
我身子虚得很呢
I'm as weak as water.

910
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,183
给我们来点喝的
Get us a drink.

911
01:24:53,725 --> 01:24:58,389
- 什么破风把你吹到这里来了？ - 不是什么破风，亲爱的
-What evil wind has blowed you here? -No evil wind, my dear.

912
01:24:59,197 --> 01:25:02,530
是你，比尔，是你说要和我讲话的
You, Bill, you. You said we need to speak.

913
01:25:08,173 --> 01:25:10,073
你对那孩子做了什么？他在哪里？
What you done with that boy? Where is he?

914
01:25:10,275 --> 01:25:12,743
他好得很，机灵鬼在看着他
Safe and sound. The Dodger's minding him.

915
01:25:12,944 --> 01:25:16,539
他们现在形影不离呢
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

916
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:22,242
那孩子怎么啦，比尔？
What about the boy, Bill?

917
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,352
我们不想有谁告发我们，对吗？
We don't want anyone peaching on us, do we?

918
01:25:27,559 --> 01:25:30,619
只要那孩子还活着，我们就是被吊死的命
And as Iong as that boy's alive, we're as good as hung.

919
01:25:30,862 --> 01:25:33,353
那应该怎么办？
So, what's to be done?

920
01:25:35,267 --> 01:25:37,201
- 不要动手 - 不动手？
-Nothing. -Nothing?

921
01:25:37,402 --> 01:25:40,462
- 我还没好就不要动手 - 然后呢？
-Not till I'm better. -Then what?

922
01:25:41,306 --> 01:25:43,866
- 然后我就了结了他 - 怎么了结啊，在哪呢？
-Then I'II do for him. -How, Bill? Where?

923
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,802
到伦敦郊外找条河把他淹死掉
Outside of London somewhere. I'II find a river and I'II drown him.

924
01:25:48,013 --> 01:25:50,379
那孩子现在身子很弱，比尔，他受伤了
The boy's weak. Bill, he was wounded.

925
01:25:50,582 --> 01:25:53,016
他连站都站不稳，就不要说走路了
He can hardly stand, Iet alone walk.

926
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:56,244
他什么时候走得动了就告诉我，我去带他走
When he can walk, tell me. I'II fetch him.

927
01:25:57,656 --> 01:25:58,918
你走吧
Now, get out of here.

928
01:25:59,658 --> 01:26:01,353
好
Yes.

929
01:26:02,361 --> 01:26:03,988
好的
Yes.

930
01:26:04,229 --> 01:26:07,221
比尔，你说得没错
Bill, you're right.

931
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,331
我是出于好意啊
It's for the best.

932
01:26:16,842 --> 01:26:19,106
我浑身烧得利害
I'm burning up.

933
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:20,903
给我吃点药吧，我的药呢？
Give me me physic. Where's me physic?

934
01:26:23,281 --> 01:26:25,772
你怎么魂不守舍的？
You Iook Iike a corpse come back to Iife again.

935
01:26:25,984 --> 01:26:29,147
- 发生了什么事？ - 没事
-What's the matter? -Nothing.

936
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:32,017
你干吗这么狠地瞪着我？
What do you Iook at me so hard for?

937
01:26:32,224 --> 01:26:35,387
- 你在想什么？ - 想很多，比尔
-What you thinking of? -Of many things, Bill.

938
01:26:35,594 --> 01:26:37,653
- 问这个干嘛？ - 我来告诉你吧
-What odds in that? -I'II tell you what it is.

939
01:26:37,863 --> 01:26:39,626
你要不是害了感冒...
If you haven't caught the fever...

940
01:26:39,831 --> 01:26:42,891
...就是有些不寻常的事情发生了
...then there's something more than usual in the wind.

941
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:45,626
或者是很危险的事
And something dangerous too.

942
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,299
把药给我，我说
Give me me physic, I say.

943
01:26:51,977 --> 01:26:54,969
不，不，不
No, no, no.

944
01:26:55,547 --> 01:26:58,846
没有见过这么犟的女人...
There ain't a stauncher-hearted girl going...

945
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:02,646
...早知道就把她的脖子给割了
...or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.

946
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:07,658
她可能是发烧了吧，就是的
She's got a fever coming on. That's it.

947
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,174
来，喝了会好些
Here. Make you feel better.

948
01:27:39,157 --> 01:27:41,284
坐到这来
Sit aside me.

949
01:27:43,762 --> 01:27:47,823
拿出你平时的样子来，否则我给你变个样 让你自己都认不出来
Put on your own face, or I'II alter it so you won't know it again.

950
01:29:12,817 --> 01:29:15,047
- 等一下 - 好的，小姐
-Wait. -Ma'am.

951
01:29:33,004 --> 01:29:35,472
- 你好？ - 布朗罗先生是不是住在这里？
-Yes? -Does Mr. Brownlow Iive here?

952
01:29:35,674 --> 01:29:38,802
你是谁？你想干什么？你回去吧
Who are you? What do you want? Go around the back.

953
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,808
我想说说奥立弗・忒斯特的事
I have information about OIiver Twist.

954
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:48,181
他还好吗？他没有危险吧？
Is he all right? Is he safe?

955
01:29:49,354 --> 01:29:53,017
- 他在哪？ - 我只跟布朗罗先生说
-Where is he? -I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

956
01:29:53,224 --> 01:29:55,715
他不在
He's not here.

957
01:29:56,461 --> 01:29:58,292
告诉他，那孩子是无辜的
The boy's innocent, tell him that.

958
01:29:59,464 --> 01:30:02,331
- 他在哪里？ - 他很安全
-Where is he? -Safe.

959
01:30:03,735 --> 01:30:07,102
- 但是不会一直都那样 - 他在哪里？
-But he may not be for Iong. -Where is he?

960
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,342
替我给布朗罗先生留个口信
Give Mr. Brownlow a message.

961
01:30:20,552 --> 01:30:22,850
让他星期天凌晨...
Tell him to meet me on Sunday at midnight...

962
01:30:23,054 --> 01:30:25,284
- ...到伦敦桥和我碰面 - 凌晨？
-...on London Bridge. -Midnight?

963
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:27,117
如果我不在的话...
And if I'm not there...

964
01:30:27,325 --> 01:30:31,762
... 告诉他第二天，第三天晚上再去 我会在的，要告诉他
...then tell him to come the next night and the next. I'II be there. Tell him.

965
01:30:37,435 --> 01:30:41,201
看啊，亲爱的 你就像从来没有受过伤一样
There, my dear, you Iook as good as new.

966
01:30:41,706 --> 01:30:45,437
- 你感觉怎样？ - 累，先生
-How do you feel? -Tired, sir.

967
01:30:45,644 --> 01:30:46,838
哦，当然，当然
Well, yes, yes.

968
01:30:47,045 --> 01:30:50,537
早就过12点了 待会儿你就可以美美得睡一觉了
It is Iong after midnight. Shortly, you'II sleep a good sleep.

969
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:52,182
可是，我的意思是...
But my meaning was...

970
01:30:52,384 --> 01:30:54,716
...你身子感觉怎样，奥立弗？
...how do you feel in yourself, OIiver?

971
01:30:54,919 --> 01:30:57,183
好些了，谢谢你，先生
Better. Thank you, sir.

972
01:30:57,389 --> 01:31:01,382
- 就是手臂还痛 - 过来坐
-But for the ache in my arm. -Come sit.

973
01:31:03,862 --> 01:31:08,492
我有好东西可以对付它，亲爱的
I have the very thing for such pains as yours, my dear.

974
01:31:10,068 --> 01:31:11,330
解开绷带
Undo the bandage.

975
01:31:22,213 --> 01:31:24,841
噢，天啊
Oh, my God.

976
01:31:25,517 --> 01:31:28,315
伤得不轻啊
It's a nasty wound.

977
01:31:29,621 --> 01:31:33,318
我的妙方会治好它的 看着吧，亲爱的
But my magic will do the trick. You'II see, my dear.

978
01:31:33,525 --> 01:31:35,652
这种药...
This remedy...

979
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,794
...是祖传秘方，没错...
...is older than time. Yes...

980
01:31:37,996 --> 01:31:40,294
...亲爱的，是祖传秘方
...my dear, older than time.

981
01:31:40,498 --> 01:31:43,956
父亲传给儿子...
It was handed down from father to son...

982
01:31:44,169 --> 01:31:48,435
...父亲传给儿子，来自什么地方？
...father to son, and comes from...

983
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:52,840
没有谁知道
...who can say where?

984
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:59,443
谢谢你，先生，谢谢
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

985
01:31:59,651 --> 01:32:01,778
谢谢你的好意，我永远不会忘记的
For your kindness. I'II always remember it.

986
01:32:01,986 --> 01:32:03,283
这个...
Well....

987
01:32:04,089 --> 01:32:05,522
这个...
Well....

988
01:32:06,725 --> 01:32:08,192
永远不会
AIways.

989
01:32:08,393 --> 01:32:10,987
没错，永远不会，亲爱的
Yes, always, my dear.

990
01:32:13,398 --> 01:32:16,424
谁知道那会有多久啊
But who knows how Iong that will be.

991
01:32:44,896 --> 01:32:47,490
离凌晨还有一个钟头
An hour this side of midnight.

992
01:32:47,732 --> 01:32:50,166
这天还很阴沉
Dark and heavy it is too.

993
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:53,199
到此为止吧，晚安了
Good night for business, this.

994
01:32:53,404 --> 01:32:56,635
真可惜，比尔，亲爱的 我们还没成功过一次呢
What a pity, Bill, my dear, there's none quite ready to be done.

995
01:32:56,841 --> 01:32:58,502
对啊，这回你说对了
Yeah, for once, you're right.

996
01:32:58,977 --> 01:33:01,411
那孩子什么时候才能好起来，走那一段路呢？
When will the boy be well enough to go on his travels?

997
01:33:01,613 --> 01:33:06,073
- 我说过了，一两天就可以了 - 真可惜
-Like I say, Bill. In a day or two. -It's a pity.

998
01:33:06,284 --> 01:33:09,617
- 我也有这种感觉 - 听你这么说我就放心了
-For I'm in the humor to. -Does me good to hear you.

999
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:13,257
今晚你像你自己了，比尔 这样才像你自己嘛
You're Iike yourself tonight, Bill. Quite Iike yourself.

1000
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:16,723
你把这皱巴巴的爪子放在我肩上 我才不像自己呢...
I don't feel Iike myself when you Iay that withered claw on my shoulder...

1001
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:19,089
...给我松开
...so take it away.

1002
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:29,573
你好，南希
Hello, Nance.

1003
01:33:29,774 --> 01:33:31,867
这女孩这么晚到哪里去？
Where's the girl going to this time of night?

1004
01:33:32,277 --> 01:33:34,745
- 不远 - 这是什么话？
-Not far. -What answer's that?

1005
01:33:34,946 --> 01:33:37,676
- 你到哪里去？ - 我说了，不远
-Where you going? -I say, not far.

1006
01:33:37,882 --> 01:33:40,180
- 我问的是哪里？ - 我不知道哪里
-And I say, where? -I don't know where.

1007
01:33:40,385 --> 01:33:43,377
那我知道，哪儿都不要去，坐下
Then I do, nowhere. Sit down.

1008
01:33:43,588 --> 01:33:47,149
- 我不舒服，我想透透气 - 把脑袋伸到窗外去
-I'm not well. I want a breath of air. -Put your head out the window.

1009
01:33:47,358 --> 01:33:50,486
那还不够，我想到街上去
There's not enough there. I want it in the street.

1010
01:33:54,165 --> 01:33:56,690
那你就哪都不要去
Then you won't have it.

1011
01:34:01,973 --> 01:34:06,433
现在给我乖乖地呆在这里，行吗？
There. Now, stop quietly where you are, will you?

1012
01:34:11,749 --> 01:34:13,273
你知道你在干什么吗？
Do you know what you're doing?

1013
01:34:14,552 --> 01:34:16,577
我在干什么？
Do I know what I'm--?

1014
01:34:16,788 --> 01:34:19,814
我看你这个女人是疯掉了 敢这样对我说话？
I think this girl's Iost her senses. You talking to me in that way?

1015
01:34:20,024 --> 01:34:22,049
你要把我逼上绝路了
You'II drive me on to something desperate.

1016
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,728
让我走，行吗？就现在，就这次
Now, Iet me go, will you? This minute, this instant.

1017
01:34:24,929 --> 01:34:27,261
- 休想！ - 叫他让我走，费金
-No! -Tell him to Iet me go, Fagin.

1018
01:34:27,932 --> 01:34:31,231
这样是为他好，你听见了吗？
It'II be better for him. Do you hear me?

1019
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:35,864
好，我听见了
Aye, I hear you.

1020
01:34:37,108 --> 01:34:40,009
如果再过半分钟我还听见你嚷嚷...
And if I have to Iisten to you for half a minute Ionger...

1021
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:43,977
...那只狗就会让你出不了声！
...the dog will tear some of that screaming voice out!

1022
01:34:44,315 --> 01:34:47,113
你是怎么啦，你个贱货，怎么回事？
What's come over you, you jade? What is it?

1023
01:34:47,318 --> 01:34:49,183
比尔，让我走吧
Bill, Iet me go.

1024
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:53,623
让我走吧，你不知道自己在干什么
Let me go. You don't know what you're doing.

1025
01:34:53,825 --> 01:34:55,053
就去一个小时
For only one hour.

1026
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:59,060
这娘们要是还没疯到头 我就把我的手脚一只一只砍下来
Cut my Iimbs off one by one if I don't think the girl's stark raving mad.

1027
01:34:59,264 --> 01:35:02,995
- 起来，给我起来！ - 不！
-Get up. Get up! -No.

1028
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:11,202
给我呆在里面！
Now, stay there!

1029
01:35:14,145 --> 01:35:15,806
这个小娘们真够奇怪
What a precious, strange girl that is.

1030
01:35:16,014 --> 01:35:18,039
你说的没错，比尔，没错
You may say that, Bill, you may say that.

1031
01:35:18,249 --> 01:35:20,479
大晚上的她为什么要出去呢？
Why did she take it in her head to go out tonight?

1032
01:35:20,985 --> 01:35:23,783
固执，我看她很固执，亲爱的
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.

1033
01:35:24,122 --> 01:35:27,285
我还以为我把她驯乖了 可她还是那个样儿
I thought I tamed her of that. But she's as bad as ever.

1034
01:35:29,894 --> 01:35:33,091
我看她是染上我的热病了，还没好呢
I think she's got a touch of my fever in her blood and it won't come out.

1035
01:35:33,298 --> 01:35:34,788
还真像
Like enough.

1036
01:35:34,999 --> 01:35:37,991
如果她再敢那样做，我就给他放放血
Well, if she's taken that way again, I'II Iet her a Iittle blood.

1037
01:35:38,202 --> 01:35:41,171
就用不着看医生了
Without troubling the doctor.

1038
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:59,486
现在她又变了个花样
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1039
01:36:00,858 --> 01:36:02,257
晚安了
Good night.

1040
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:06,954
过两天来找那个孩子把
In two days, Bill, come for the boy.

1041
01:36:08,866 --> 01:36:10,959
点灯送客
Light him down.

1042
01:36:11,169 --> 01:36:14,969
他要是摔倒了没人见着，多可怜啊
It's a pity he should fall and break his neck without anyone seeing it.

1043
01:36:17,108 --> 01:36:18,473
给他点盏灯
Show him a Iight.

1044
01:36:27,852 --> 01:36:31,549
怎么啦，亲爱的南希，这样闹腾是为什么？
What is it, Nancy dear, the reason for all this?

1045
01:36:31,756 --> 01:36:33,986
- 你说什么？ - 刚才的事
-What do you mean? -That matter just now.

1046
01:36:34,192 --> 01:36:36,217
我不会告诉别人
We'II speak of this anon.

1047
01:36:36,427 --> 01:36:38,486
我们俩算是朋友吧，南希
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1048
01:36:38,696 --> 01:36:40,891
老朋友，你早就认识我了，南希
A staunch friend. You know me of old, Nance.

1049
01:36:41,432 --> 01:36:44,196
我很了解你，晚安
I know you well. Good night.

1050
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,039
机灵鬼...
Dodge...

1051
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:53,107
...抽一口
...pull it in.

1052
01:36:56,314 --> 01:36:59,374
我的杯子已经满了，你没看到吗？
My glass is full already, can't you see?

1053
01:37:05,523 --> 01:37:07,252
麻烦来啦
Trouble?

1054
01:37:10,828 --> 01:37:12,625
机灵鬼
Dodger.

1055
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,496
- 有没有老汤姆酒啊？ - 在十钟酒吧呢
-Let's find out where old Tom is, eh? -He's in the Ten Bells.

1056
01:37:18,703 --> 01:37:21,194
我们俩去弄点回家吧？
Shall we both take him home?

1057
01:37:21,672 --> 01:37:23,105
老实说...
Honestly...

1058
01:37:23,307 --> 01:37:25,935
...我没见着她
...I haven't seen her.

1059
01:37:27,145 --> 01:37:28,874
什么事？
Something up?

1060
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:33,079
我....
I....

1061
01:37:34,652 --> 01:37:40,488
我想你帮我一个忙 帮这个忙要很小心，很注意
I want you to do a piece of work for me that requires great care and caution.

1062
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:43,283
什么事？不要叫我去警局附近办事
What is it? I ain't going near no police office.

1063
01:37:43,494 --> 01:37:47,021
- 那不适合我去 - 办这件事一点危险也没有
-That don't suit me, that don't. -There's not the smallest danger in it.

1064
01:37:47,231 --> 01:37:50,325
一点都没有，我想你跟跟一个人
Not the smallest. I want someone dodged.

1065
01:37:50,535 --> 01:37:53,060
- 谁？一个老头？ - 年轻人
-Who, an old one? -Young one.

1066
01:37:53,271 --> 01:37:54,533
- 是谁？ - 我们的人
-Who is she? -One of us.

1067

谁呀？

1068
01:37:56,407 --> 01:37:58,341
南希？
Nancy?

1069
01:37:59,844 --> 01:38:02,608
- 她最近怎么啦？ - 我也不清楚她在干什么...
-What's she been up to? -Not sure she's been up to anything...

1070
01:38:02,814 --> 01:38:06,113
...亲爱的，所以我才叫你跟她啊
...my dear, that's why I want her dodged.

1071
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:10,952
她可能想跟人说我们的事，她不能说的
She may want to talk to people she shouldn't want to talk to.

1072
01:38:11,155 --> 01:38:16,115
我想知道她去了哪里，见了谁，说了什么
I want to know where she goes, who she sees, what she says.

1073
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,259
南希
Nancy.

1074
01:38:20,465 --> 01:38:23,093
我不知道，她是个好人，南希啊
I don't know. She's a good one, is Nancy.

1075
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:27,795
给你一个英镑，亲爱的，实打实一个英镑
A pound, my dear. One whole pound.

1076
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:10,047
布朗罗先生？
Mr. Brownlow?

1077
01:39:11,949 --> 01:39:13,644
是的
Yes.

1078
01:39:16,854 --> 01:39:19,948
我不敢在这里说，这边走，跟我来
I'm afraid to speak to you here. Come away. Follow me.

1079
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:36,439
已经够远了
This is far enough.

1080
01:39:36,641 --> 01:39:39,633
- 为什么不在这上面说？ - 我说过了，我害怕
-Why can't we speak up there? -I told you, I'm afraid.

1081
01:39:39,844 --> 01:39:41,971
可能有人跟踪我
I may be followed.

1082
01:39:46,717 --> 01:39:48,048
我到这儿来是因为...
I'm here because you told...

1083
01:39:48,252 --> 01:39:51,016
...你告诉我的管家 说你有奥立弗・忒斯特的消息
...my housekeeper you have information concerning OIiver Twist.

1084
01:39:51,222 --> 01:39:53,417
- 没错 - 告诉我吧
-So I have. -Tell me.

1085
01:39:55,092 --> 01:39:56,719
她在一个恶棍手中...
He's being held by the devil...

1086
01:39:56,928 --> 01:40:01,422
...很快要被送到另外一个恶人手上，他想....
...and he's handing him over to another what means to....

1087
01:40:01,632 --> 01:40:04,066
告诉我多一些，他是不是你身边的人？
I must know more. Is it someone close to you?

1088
01:40:05,102 --> 01:40:08,435
- 一个是，一个不是 - 不管这两个人是谁...
-One is. One ain't. -These men, whoever they are...

1089
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,199
- ...你都要说出来 - 我不会的
-...must be delivered up by you. -Never.

1090
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:16,506
他干尽坏事，我也没什么两样 我不会出卖他的
Bad a Iife as he has Ied, I've Ied a bad Iife too, and I will not turn upon him.

1091
01:40:17,114 --> 01:40:18,945
另外一个
The other.

1092
01:40:19,684 --> 01:40:22,847
- 费金，孩子在他手上 - 费金
-Fagin. He has the boy. -Fagin.

1093
01:40:23,054 --> 01:40:24,453
你要能找到费金，就找到那小孩了
Find Fagin, you'II find the boy.

1094
01:40:24,655 --> 01:40:27,055
- 他在哪里？ - 斯皮达菲
-Where is he? -Spitalfields.

1095
01:40:27,258 --> 01:40:30,318
我不能再说了，已经说太多了
That's all I'II say. I've said too much.

1096
01:40:30,728 --> 01:40:32,628
不要让别人知道是我告诉你的
No one must never know who told you.

1097
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:35,298
- 答应我 - 我答应你
-Promise. -I promise.

1098
01:40:35,499 --> 01:40:39,629
- 明天我就去警察局 - 不，今晚就要去
-Tomorrow I'II go to the police. -No, you must do it tonight.

1099
01:40:39,837 --> 01:40:41,828
说费金的名字，那些条子就会知道了
Just say Fagin, and the traps will know.

1100
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:45,065
- 条子？ - 警察
-The traps? -The police.

1101
01:40:45,276 --> 01:40:48,541
- 你要什么作为酬劳？ - 什么都不要
-What can I do to serve you? -Nothing.

1102
01:40:48,746 --> 01:40:52,045
你帮不了我，我已经完全失望了
You can do nothing. I am past all hope indeed.

1103
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,309
把这个收下吧
Take this as a reward.

1104
01:40:54,518 --> 01:40:57,885
不，我来这里不是为了钱
No, I've not done this for money.

1105
01:40:58,089 --> 01:40:59,488
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

1106
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,750
晚安，晚安
Good night. Good night.

1107
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,895
千万不要说是谁告诉你的
Never-- Never say who told you.

1108
01:41:17,808 --> 01:41:19,002
你看他
Look at him.

1109
01:41:20,811 --> 01:41:22,676
多可惜啊，看他那小脸蛋...
What a shame it is. With his face...

1110
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,075
...他可以在教堂掏老太太的口袋
...he could pick old Iadies' pockets in church.

1111
01:41:25,283 --> 01:41:28,684
这小脸蛋能帮我们发财呢
His face could be a fortune to us.

1112
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:31,378
你改变主意了？
You changing your mind?

1113
01:41:31,589 --> 01:41:33,181
没有

1114
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:35,918
不，比尔，必须要那样做
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1115
01:41:36,127 --> 01:41:38,027
费金！费金
Fagin! Fagin.

1116
01:41:43,434 --> 01:41:46,699
- 你怎么啦，机灵鬼？ - 我得和费金单独说
-What's got into you, Dodger? -I have to see Fagin alone.

1117
01:41:46,904 --> 01:41:48,599
不不，在比尔面前说没关系
No, no, you can speak in front of Bill.

1118
01:41:48,806 --> 01:41:52,242
- 不，不行 - 可以的，说啊，机灵鬼，说吧
-No, I can't. -Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

- 是南希 - 南希怎么啦？
-Nancy. -What about Nancy?

1120
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:57,612
他帮了我一个小忙，比尔 我让他跟踪了南希
He done a bit of work for me, Bill. I had him dodge Nancy.

1121
01:41:57,815 --> 01:41:59,407
你说什么？
What do you mean?

1122
01:41:59,617 --> 01:42:01,676
告诉我们，机灵鬼，你跟踪了她？
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1123
01:42:01,886 --> 01:42:04,047
是的，到了伦敦桥
Yes. To London Bridge.

1124
01:42:04,255 --> 01:42:06,621
然后呢？在伦敦桥上干什么了？
And what? What on London Bridge?

1125
01:42:06,957 --> 01:42:08,982
她和一个老东西见了面，是个老先生
She met an old one. A gentleman.

1126
01:42:09,193 --> 01:42:10,922
- 然后.... - 然后呢？
-And.... -And?

1127
01:42:11,128 --> 01:42:13,221
你倒是说啊！
Speak, will you?!

1128
01:42:14,065 --> 01:42:17,000
她出出卖了我们，她说了费金和奥立弗的名字
She peached. She told him Fagin had OIiver.

1129
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:21,228
老头要去找条子，就是今天晚上
And the old man was to go to the traps. Now, tonight.

-Let me go. Let me out! -Bill! Bill! A word--

-Don't speak to me, it's not safe! -Hear me speak a word!

1132

比尔，你不会....
Bill, you won't be....

1133
01:42:37,154 --> 01:42:39,349
你不会太过分吧，比尔?
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1134
01:42:52,203 --> 01:42:53,568
快走，孩子们，快走！
FIit, boys, flit!

1189
01:47:44,928 --> 01:47:46,190
怎么样？
How about that, eh?

1190
01:47:58,942 --> 01:48:01,934
来，回来
Come. Come back here.

1191

我们回伦敦去
We're going back to London.

1192
01:48:09,019 --> 01:48:11,010
我要跟别人说了

我要找费金要点钱，再到法国去
I'II force shiners out of Fagin, get to France.

1194
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:16,183
妈的，我们拼了
Damn me, we'II risk it.

1195
01:48:21,231 --> 01:48:23,131
他干了什么事？
Who's he done in?

1196
01:48:24,401 --> 01:48:27,734
- 他们说，他们说是个女的 - 他害了一个女的？
-They say-- They say it's a woman. -He's done in a woman?

1197
01:48:54,164 --> 01:48:56,098
大牛
Bullseye.

1198
01:48:57,267 --> 01:48:59,792
你没听到我吹口哨吗？
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1199
01:49:00,304 --> 01:49:02,704

01:49:16,854 --> 01:49:18,822
松口，我不是跟你玩

1205
01:49:19,022 --> 01:49:21,650
松口啊，你这臭东西！
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1206
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:23,759
大牛！
Bullseye!

1207
01:49:29,366 --> 01:49:31,129
大牛，大牛
Bullseye. Bullseye.

1208
01:49:31,568 --> 01:49:33,798
回来，回来
Get back here. Get back here.

1209
01:49:36,106 --> 01:49:37,767
妈的！
Damn it!

1210
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,841
看，这是他的狗
Look, it's his dog.

1211
01:49:45,048 --> 01:49:47,312
就是他的狗！
It's his dog!

1212
01:49:52,089 --> 01:49:53,454
过来，孩子
Here, boy.

1213
01:49:53,657 --> 01:49:55,625
- 来这 - 别靠近它
-Here. -Don't go near him.

1214
01:50:01,899 --> 01:50:04,595
有个孩子情况很危险，布拉瑟斯检察长...
There is a child in danger, Inspector BIathers...

1215
01:50:04,802 --> 01:50:06,292
...可是你现在好像只对...

1216
01:50:06,503 --> 01:50:08,528
...威廉・塞克斯这个人感兴趣
...in apprehending this man, William Sykes.

1217
01:50:08,739 --> 01:50:10,331
你应该多关心一下...
Your concern should be...

1218
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:12,736
- ...那孩子的安危啊 - 让我说句话...

...我们平时就是这样办事的
...this is our usual way of doing business.

1220
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,443
我是这样想的
My thinking is this:

1221
01:50:18,649 --> 01:50:21,379
如果我们逮到了塞克斯，费金就逃不掉了
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1222
01:50:21,585 --> 01:50:23,280
- 如果我们逮住了费金 - 我说
-And if we get Fagin-- -Look.

1223
01:50:24,121 --> 01:50:27,113
长官，找到那条狗了
Sir, we found the dog.

1224
01:50:29,259 --> 01:50:31,887
我们就在这里等着条子来抓吗？
Are we going to sit here waiting for the traps to find us?

1225
01:50:32,095 --> 01:50:35,189
- 闭嘴 - 不，他说的没错
-Shut it. -No, he's right.

1226
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:37,799
我们得再逃远点
We should do another flit.

1227
01:50:40,437 --> 01:50:42,405
是条子！
The traps!

1228
01:50:57,955 --> 01:50:59,217
什么？
What?

1229
01:50:59,656 --> 01:51:00,850
是他
It's him.

1230
01:51:01,792 --> 01:51:03,726
- 别让他进来 - 肯定要
-Don't Iet him in. -We must.

1231
01:51:05,762 --> 01:51:07,491
去啊
Go on.

1232
01:51:09,633 --> 01:51:11,498
去啊！
Go on!

1233
01:51:17,774 --> 01:51:20,265
给我们留点火啊
Don't Ieave us in the dark.

1234
01:52:16,433 --> 01:52:18,560
你们都是混蛋
Damn you all.

1235
01:52:19,202 --> 01:52:21,796
没话跟我说吗？
Have you nothing to say to me?

1236
01:52:22,172 --> 01:52:26,973
- 你到这里来太不安全了，比尔 - 对你不安全，对我安全
-Not safe for you to stop here, Bill. -If it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1237
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:32,648
那个…
Is it...?

1238
01:52:33,817 --> 01:52:35,341
尸体埋了吗？
The body, is it buried?

1239
01:52:43,694 --> 01:52:46,356
机灵鬼，快让他进来
Dodger, Iet him in quick.

1240
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:49,632
机灵鬼
Dodger.

1241
01:52:50,867 --> 01:52:52,494
照我说的做
Do as I say.

1242
01:52:56,473 --> 01:52:58,703
别靠近我，你这个怪物
Don't come near me, you monster.

1243
01:53:02,546 --> 01:53:04,673
你们都在这作证，我不怕他
You're my witnesses. I'm not afraid of him.

1244
01:53:06,116 --> 01:53:08,550
如果他们来要人，我不会保他
And if they come here after him, I'II give him up.

1245
01:53:08,752 --> 01:53:10,379
我会告诉他们你在这里
I'II tell them you're here.

1246
01:53:11,655 --> 01:53:15,022
他要杀我随他便，但是 只要我在这，我就会告发他
He may kill me if he Iikes, but if I'm here, I'II give him up.

1247
01:53:15,225 --> 01:53:17,819
就算他被活活烫死，我也要告发
If he was to be boiled alive, so I would.

1248
01:53:18,028 --> 01:53:20,258
你这个小…
Why, you Iittle--

1249
01:53:21,264 --> 01:53:22,754
放开我！
Get off me!

1250
01:53:22,966 --> 01:53:24,729
看我把你撕开几块！
Or I'II tear you Iimb from Iimb!

1251
01:53:30,874 --> 01:53:32,136
救命，他在这里！
Help, he's here!

1252
01:53:32,342 --> 01:53:34,572
- 他在这里，把门撞开！ - 在上面的窗边
-He's here. Break down the door! -Up at the window!

1253
01:53:34,778 --> 01:53:36,803
救命！上来啊，求求你们
Help! Come up, please!

1254
01:53:39,082 --> 01:53:41,277
- 那个就是比尔・塞克斯！ - 滚你们的！
-That's Bill Sykes! -Damn you all!

1255

随你们怎么办！我还是不服输！
Do your worst. I'II cheat you yet!

1256
01:53:54,998 --> 01:53:58,195
不，比尔，不要，我们留着他还有用
No! Bill, no. He's our bargaining tool.

1257
01:53:58,402 --> 01:54:01,428
不是你的，费金，是我的
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1258
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,398
比尔！
Bill!

1259
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:18,053
别开枪

我会让他掉下去
I'II Iet him drop.

1263
01:54:26,396 --> 01:54:28,864
不要乱来，否则我松手了！
Don't try nothing, or I'II Iet him go!

1264
01:54:32,702 --> 01:54:34,602
上来
Get up there.

1265
01:54:35,038 --> 01:54:37,097
过去，过去
Cross, cross.

01:54:40,343 --> 01:54:44,006
上去！上去
Up there. Up there.

1267
01:54:47,951 --> 01:54:51,580
抓住那里，抓住
Grab hold of there. Grab hold of it.

1268
01:55:00,797 --> 01:55:02,992
长官，我们追吧

1269
01:55:14,444 --> 01:55:16,105
下来
Get down.

1270
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:21,917
他们要逃了！
They're getting away!

1271
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:24,178
在那儿，在那儿！

格林维格先生有话要跟你说

Now then, young man, I confess I misjudged you.

说真的，我还怕你的恩人要我吃掉我的头呢
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor would make me eat my head.

不过他是我的好朋友，他原谅了我

-I don't know as I should, sir. -You must.

1288
01:58:08,518 --> 01:58:13,251
请允许我借此机会敬你一杯
So I'II take the Iiberty, if you'II allow me, to salute you.

1289
01:58:14,057 --> 01:58:16,958

1292
01:58:25,535 --> 01:58:29,938
怎么啦，奥立弗，孩子，怎么啦？
Why, OIiver. My child, what's the matter?

1293
01:58:30,540 --> 01:58:32,371
为什么那么难过？
Why are you so sad?

1294
01:58:59,602 --> 01:59:02,298
你确定要这样做吗？
Are you certain, OIiver, you wish to go through with this?

1295
01:59:02,505 --> 01:59:04,200

这位小先生也一起来吗？
Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?

1299
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:05,133
这里不适合小孩子看，先生
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1300
02:00:05,335 --> 02:00:08,634
当然不适合，朋友，但是这个小孩...
It is not indeed, my friend. But this child has seen this man...

1301
02:00:08,838 --> 02:00:11,102
...见过那个人的起起落落
...in the full career of his success and villainy.

1302
02:00:11,307 --> 02:00:14,333
这也是他的愿望，就算会留下痛苦和恐惧...
And it is his wish, even at the cost of some pain and fear...

1303
02:00:14,544 --> 02:00:16,910
