00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,638
片名：霧都孤兒

2
00:03:08,904 --> 00:03:11,065
給各位理事鞠躬
Bow to the board.

3
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:14,075
就是這孩子
This is the boy.

4
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:18,377
在救濟院出生，然後去了教區農場
Born here in the workhouse. Moved to the parish farm.

5
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,277

Nine years old today. Time to be moved back here.

6
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:23,781
你叫什麼，孩子？
What's your name, boy?

7
00:03:29,358 --> 00:03:30,985
- 奧利弗·忒斯特 - 什麼？
-OIiver Twist. -What?

8
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:34,754
- 那孩子是個傻子 - 孩子，聽我說
-That boy's a fool. -Boy. Listen to me.

9
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,355
我想，你知道自己是孤兒吧？
You know you are an orphan, I suppose.

10
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:39,932
- 你說什麼？ - 這孩子是個傻子，可能早就是了
-What's that? -The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

11
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,330
你知道你無父無母...
You know you've got no father or mother...

12
00:03:42,538 --> 00:03:45,200
...由教會養大，是嗎？
...and that you were brought up by the parish, don't you?

13
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:47,967
- 是的，先生 - 你哭什麼？
-Yes, sir. -What are you crying for?

14
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:50,940
我希望你每天晚上都做禱告
I hope you say your prayers every night.

15
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:54,912
替那些養育你，照顧你的人祈禱
Pray for those that feed you and take care of you...

16
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,311
...像一個基督徒...
...Iike a Christian.

17
00:03:56,518 --> 00:03:58,418
- 是的，先生 - 好吧...
-Yes, sir. -Well...

18
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,520
...你上這兒來是接受教育...

19
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:03,054
...來學一門有用的手藝的
...and to be taught a useful trade.

20
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:18,304
這些東西放哪兒？
Here, where do you want these?

21
00:04:34,756 --> 00:04:36,917
跟你旁邊的孩子學
Learn from the boy next to you.

22
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:41,255
- 學什麼，先生？ - 學揀麻絮
-What am I to Iearn, sir? -Learn to pick out the oakum.

23
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,794
麻絮是什麼，先生？
What's oakum, sir?

24
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,562
你哪兒來這麼多問題？！
Stop asking so many questions.

25
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:49,100
麻絮是從舊繩子裡面挑出來的纖維
Oakum's the fibers you unpick from the old rope.

26
00:04:49,304 --> 00:04:53,468
能再次用在女王陛下的船上
Then it's used again for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.

27
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,870
你是在為國效力
You're serving your country.

28
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:57,670
好了，幹活吧
Now, get on with it.

29
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:35,049
湯姆，歇一歇好不好？ 我們還要睡覺呢
Tom, give it a rest, will you? We're trying to sleep.

30
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:41,251
- 睡不著，太餓了 - 我們都餓
-Can't sleep, too hungry. -We're all hungry.

31
00:05:41,456 --> 00:05:43,924
是的，但我怕
Yes, but I'm frightened.

32
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:45,684
怕？為什麼？
Frightened? Why?

33
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,357
什麼？什麼？
Why? Why?

34
00:05:48,563 --> 00:05:53,057
我太餓了，我怕把旁邊的小子吃了
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might eat the Iad that sleeps next to me.

35
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,161
主啊...
O Lord God...

36
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:33,364
...感謝你賜予我們...
...for the blessing of this generous and bountiful meal...

37
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:35,668
...如此豐盛的食物...
...that thou hast placed before us...

38
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:38,607
...感謝您的慷慨，阿門
...we give thanks. Amen.

39
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,180
阿門
Amen.

40
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:04,162
對不起，先生，我還要一點
PIease, sir. I want some more.

41
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:08,093
什麼？
What?

42
00:08:08,303 --> 00:08:10,794
對不起，先生，我還要
PIease, sir, I want some more.

43
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,210
快把執事找來！
Fetch the beadle!

44
00:08:33,028 --> 00:08:34,518
尼姆金斯先生
Mr. Limbkins.

45
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:37,356
請原諒，先生
I beg your pardon, sir.

46
00:08:37,566 --> 00:08:39,966
奧利弗·忒斯特還想要
OIiver Twist has asked for more.

47
00:08:41,002 --> 00:08:42,833
還要？！
For more?!

48
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,768
鎮靜，邦布爾先生 清楚地回答我
Compose yourself, Mr. Bumble, and answer me distinctly.

49
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:50,570
你是說他吃了他的晚餐之後還要？
Do I understand that he asked for more after he had eaten his supper?

50
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:52,041
是的，先生
He did, sir.

51
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:58,009
那孩子以後準會被絞死
That boy will be hanged.

52
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:13,065
「5鎊一個孩--」
"Five pounds and a b--"

53
00:09:16,004 --> 00:09:20,498
我說「哇」，那就是「哇」
When I says "whoa," I means "whoa"!

54
00:09:22,911 --> 00:09:24,606
「健...健康的...
"Health-- Healthy...

55
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:28,214
...學...學徒
...appren-- apprentice.

56
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,680
5鎊」
Five pounds."

57
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,220
掃煙囪是個髒活
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

58
00:09:34,422 --> 00:09:38,791
以前有小孩在煙囪裡面憋死的
Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now.

59
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:42,225
那是因為要他們下來 可還沒有點火...
That's because they damp the straw afore they Iight it in the chimney...

60
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,230
...他們就把稻草弄濕了 濕的稻草會生煙
...to make them come out again. Damp straw makes smoke.

61
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,562
煙會讓孩子睡著，他們還巴不得呢
Smoke sends a boy to sleep, and that's what he wants.

62
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:51,762
小孩子都很懶的
Boys is very Iazy, gentlemen.

63
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:55,431
但一團火就能讓他們上桿子跑出來 沒有比這個更靈的了
But there's nothing Iike a good hot blaze to make them come out in a run.

64
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,639
而且很人道
It's humane too. Yes.

65
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:01,907
即使他們粘在煙囪上了
Because even if they've stuck in the chimney...

66
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:07,180
...腳板一熱，他們就得趕緊下來
...roasting their feet makes them struggle to extricate theirselves.

67
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,720
是啊
Yes.

68
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,824
我想他喜歡掃煙囪這個活兒的吧？
I suppose he's fond of chimney sweeping?

69
00:10:11,026 --> 00:10:13,256
沒錯，大人
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

70
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:16,191
好吧，那我就要簽契約了...
Very well. I will sign the indentures...

71
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:20,362
...把他簽給....
...to make him Mr....

72
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:24,629
甘菲爾先生做學徒
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

73
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:35,142
孩子
My boy.

74
00:10:36,818 --> 00:10:41,084
孩子，你臉色蒼白又驚慌失措
My boy, you Iook pale and alarmed.

75
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:42,449
出什麼事了？
What's the matter?

76
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:45,925
求求您，先生，求求您，先生
PIease, sir. PIease, sir.

77
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,186
怎麼了，孩子？
What is it, my boy?

78
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:50,159
- 別.... - 夠了
-Don't.... -Now then.

79
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:52,492
別.... 別....
Don't.... Don't....

80
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:55,568
說吧，孩子，別什麼？
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

81
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,933
求您別讓這個可怕的人把我帶走，先生
PIease don't send me away with this dreadful man, sir.

82
00:10:59,674 --> 00:11:02,142
陰險狡猾的孤兒我見得多了....
Of all the designing orphans that I've ever seen....

83
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:05,040
- 閉嘴，執事 - 你是在跟我說話嗎，大人？
-Hold your tongue, beadle. -Did Your Worship speak to me?

84
00:11:05,246 --> 00:11:07,806
是的，閉嘴
Yes, hold your tongue.

85
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:12,013
不，不行
No. No, out of the question.

86
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,156
我拒絕簽這張契約
We refuse to sanction these indentures.

87
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,823
把這孩子帶走
Take the boy away.

88
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,526
好好待他
And treat him kindly.

89
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,359
看來他需要善待
He seems to want it.

90
00:11:41,783 --> 00:11:45,514
我已經給昨晚去世的兩位女士量好了尺寸
I've just taken the measure of the two women that died Iast night.

91
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,553
你要發財了，蘇爾伯雷先生
You'II make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry.

92
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,050
您這麼認為嗎？
Think so?

93
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,393
理事會出的價錢太少啦
The prices allowed by the board are very small.

94
00:11:55,597 --> 00:11:57,861
棺材不也不大嗎？
So are the coffins.

95
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:04,168
順便問一下，你知不知道有誰想找個僕童？
By the by, you don't know anybody who wants a boy, do you?

96
00:12:06,274 --> 00:12:09,937
報酬很可觀，蘇爾伯雷先生，很可觀
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry. Liberal terms.

97
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,378
現在你要見你的新師傅了...
Now, as you are to meet your new master...

98
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,581
...把帽子拉起來
...pull that cap off your eyes.

99
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,985
頭抬起來，「先生」
Hold your head up, sir.

100
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:32,959
把眼睛擦乾，「先生」
Dry your eyes, sir.

101
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:43,043
- 是你嗎，邦布爾？ - 不會是別人，蘇爾伯雷先生
-Is that you, Bumble? -No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

102
00:12:43,244 --> 00:12:46,407
我把那個孤兒帶來了 奧利弗·忒斯特
I've brought the orphan, OIiver Twist.

103
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,242
那麼說他是那個孤兒？
So this is the orphan, is it?

104
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:50,884
蘇爾伯雷太太...
Mrs. Sowerberry...

105
00:12:51,086 --> 00:12:54,249
...能不能請你過來一下，親愛的？
...will you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?

106
00:12:55,356 --> 00:12:57,017
奧利弗·忒斯特
OIiver Twist.

107
00:12:57,225 --> 00:12:59,523
孤兒怎麼會有名字？
How comes an orphan to have any name at all?

108
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:02,161
- 我給起的 - 你，邦布爾先生？
-I invented it. -You, Mr. Bumble?

109
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:03,955
我，蘇爾伯雷先生
I, Mr. Sowerberry.

110
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:07,601
我按字母順序給這些孤兒起名字
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.

111
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,497
最後一個是S
The Iast was S.

112
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,501
我給起了斯瓦布爾
Swubble, I named him.

113
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:15,472
這個是T，我給起了忒斯特
This was a T. Twist, I named him.

114
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:18,271
下一個是恩文...
Next one as comes will be Unwin...

115
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,175
...再下一個是維金斯
...and the next, Vilkins.

116
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:24,147
我把整個字母表的名字都準備好了 一直到Z
I've got names ready all through the alphabet, right up to Z.

117
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,753
哎呀，你可是個大文豪呢，先生
Why, you're quite a Iiterary character, sir.

118
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,150
嗯，嗯...
Well, well...

119
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:32,349
- ...沒準就是呢 - 蘇爾伯雷太太...
-...perhaps I may be. -Mrs. Sowerberry...

120
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,154
...這是救濟院的孤兒
...this is the orphan from the workhouse.

121
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:38,865
天哪，他可真瘦小
Dear me, he's very small.

122
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,058
但他會長大的，蘇爾伯雷太太 會長大的
But he'II grow, Mrs. Sowerberry. He'II grow.

123
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,763
是啊，在我這裡吃的好喝得好 我敢說他肯定會的
Yes, I daresay he will. On our food and drink.

124
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:50,707
救濟院的孩子吃得都比一般孩子多
Workhouse boys always cost more to keep than they're worth.

125
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,211
到樓下去，瘦皮猴
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

126
00:13:55,049 --> 00:13:56,516
夏洛特...
Here, Charlotte...

127
00:13:56,718 --> 00:14:00,381
...把我們給狗準備的冷飯給這孩子
...give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for the dog.

128
00:14:28,783 --> 00:14:31,513
我猜你不會介意睡在棺材旁邊
You don't mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose.

129
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:34,119
你介意不介意都一樣...
Well, it doesn't much matter whether you do or don't...

130
00:14:34,322 --> 00:14:36,813
...沒別的地方給你睡
...for you can't sleep anywhere else.

131
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,727
開門？
Open the door, will you?

132
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:10,714
- 你是新來的小子？ - 是的，先生
-You the new boy? -Yes, sir.

133
00:16:10,918 --> 00:16:14,046
- 你多大了？ - 10歲，先生
-How old are you? -Ten, sir.

134
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:18,385
我進來後要好好教訓你一頓，救濟院的小子
Then I'II whop you one when I get in, you workhouse brat.

135
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:37,504
請問，先生 是您敲門的嗎？
I beg your pardon, sir. Did you knock?

136
00:16:37,712 --> 00:16:38,906
是我踢的
I kicked.

137
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,547
您要買棺材嗎，先生？
Did you want a coffin, sir?

138
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:44,479
- 我猜你不知道我是誰 - 不知道，先生
-You don't know who I am, I suppose. -No, sir.

139
00:16:44,686 --> 00:16:48,122
我是諾亞·克雷波爾先生 你歸我管
Well, I'm Mr. Noah CIaypole. And you're under me.

140
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,848
現在把窗板關上
Now, take down the shutters.

141
00:16:55,663 --> 00:16:59,895
我從師傅的早餐裡給你留了點燻肉
Saved a nice Iittle bit of bacon for you from the master's breakfast.

142
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:07,641
到角落去吃，動作快點
In the corner with you. And be quick about it.

143
00:17:07,842 --> 00:17:11,005
他們等你看鋪子呢，聽到了嗎？
They'II want you to mind the shop. Do you hear?

144
00:17:11,212 --> 00:17:13,009
沒聽到嗎，救濟院的？ 到角落裡去
Do you hear, Workhouse? In the corner.

145
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:15,648
老天啊，諾亞，別管這孩子了
Oh, Lord, Noah, Iet the boy alone.

146
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,613
別管他？
Let him alone?

147
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,753
誰願意管他了？
Why, everybody's Iet him alone.

148
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:24,482
他的爸爸，媽媽，所有的親戚都不管他了
His mother, father and all his relations has Iet him alone.

149
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:27,286
所有他需要有人來管了
So he needs someone who don't.

晚餐

151
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:52,850
奧利弗，你還沒做完嗎？
OIiver, ain't you done yet?

152
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:58,218
我還從來沒見過這麼沒用的孩子 到樓下去
I've never known such an idle boy. Get down them stairs.

153
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:59,791
蘇爾伯雷先生...

154
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,689
...進晚餐了
...supper.

155
00:18:02,196 --> 00:18:05,063
- 我有個想法，親愛的 - 想法？
-I've had a thought, my dear. -Had a thought?

156
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:08,099
那你要小心了，蘇爾伯雷先生 你會得腦膜炎的
You want to be careful, Mr. Sowerberry, you'II get brain fever.

157
00:18:08,302 --> 00:18:11,829
- 是關於小忒斯特的 - 他怎麼了？
-It's about young Twist. -What about him?

158
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,566
- 一個很好看的孩子 - 當然啦，他吃得可不少
-A very good-Iooking boy. -He will be. He eats enough.

159
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:20,337
他臉上有一種憂傷的表情，親愛的
There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear.

160
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:24,109
他能成為一個出色的送殯人，親愛的
He would make a delightful mute, my Iove.

161
00:18:24,986 --> 00:18:30,481
我-- 我不是說參加成人葬禮的 一般送殯人...
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to attend grown-up funerals, my dear...

162
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:34,491
...是兒童出殯的
...but only for children's practice.

163
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,004
看看他
Look at him.

164
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:52,573
看看他
Look at him.

165
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:57,677
救濟院的小鬼頭，看啊

166
00:18:57,885 --> 00:19:00,012
記住我的話，他會被絞死的
Mark my words, I'II see him hung.

167
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:02,853
不用多久
Can't be too soon.

168
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:08,684
救濟院的，你媽媽呢？
Workhouse, how's your mother?

169
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,721
她死了
She's dead.

170
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,824
怎麼死的？
What'd she die of, Workhouse?

171
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:19,837
你要哭了嗎，救濟院的？
You gonna cry, Workhouse?

172
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,477
- 什麼事讓你哭的？ - 不是你
-What set you off? -Not you.

173
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,545
- 不是我？ - 不是你
-Not me, eh? -No, not you.

174
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:32,215
你最好別說我媽媽的事
And you better not say anything about my mother.

175
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,390
最好？
Better not?

176
00:19:36,757 --> 00:19:38,691
你媽媽的事？
About your mother?

177
00:19:38,893 --> 00:19:41,862
我很抱歉，我很可憐你
Well, I'm very sorry, and I pity you very much.

178
00:19:42,063 --> 00:19:43,724
但你必須知道，救濟院的...
But you must know, Workhouse...

179
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:46,092
...你媽媽準不是個好東西
...your mother was a regular right-down bad one.

180
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:52,229
- 你說什麼？ - 你媽媽不是個好東西
-What did you say? -A regular right-down bad one.

181
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,237
她死得正是時候...
It's a good thing she died when she did...

182
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:56,808
...不然的話，她準是在做苦工 或是被流放了
...or she'd be hard Iaboring or transported.

183
00:19:57,011 --> 00:20:00,344
要麼就是被絞死了，這個可能性最大 是嗎，救濟院的？
Or hung. Which is most Iikely, isn't it, Workhouse?

184
00:20:03,417 --> 00:20:05,180
救命啊，夏洛特太太！
Help, Mrs. Charlotte!

185
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,149
他要殺了我了，救命啊！

186
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,781
救命，走開！

187
00:20:11,225 --> 00:20:14,092
老天啊，幫幫我！
For God's sake, help me!

188
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,390
太太，他要殺了我！
My missus, he's murdering me!

189
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:20,066
- 走開，走開！ - 把他拉開，夏洛特
-Get off. Get off me now! -Get him, Charlotte.

190
00:20:20,268 --> 00:20:22,862
把他拉到外面去，快
Get him now. Go out with him. Come on.

191
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:27,233
- 救濟院的魔鬼 - 我要教訓教訓你！
-Workhouse devil. -I'II Iearn you!

192
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:30,236
- 你這個小壞蛋！ - 把門打開，夏洛特
-You brat! -Get the door, Charlotte.

193
00:20:30,444 --> 00:20:32,469
把他仍進去
In with him. In.

194
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,616
太兇殘了，先生
Very violent indeed, sir.

195
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:45,887
太太說...
And the missus said...

196
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:48,721
...如果邦布爾先生能撥冗...
...if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

197
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,626
...就可以來教訓他了...
...then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...

198
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,663
...因為師傅出去了
...because the master's out.

199
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,171
- 在這裡面 - 奧利弗？
-In there. -OIiver?

200
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,240
讓我出去！
Let me out of here!

201
00:21:03,444 --> 00:21:06,174
- 聽到我說話嗎，奧利弗？ - 聽到了
-Do you know this here voice, OIiver? -Yes.

202
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,972
你不怕嗎？
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

203
00:21:08,182 --> 00:21:10,742
聽到我的說話，你不打顫嗎？
Ain't you trembling while I speak, sir?

204
00:21:10,952 --> 00:21:12,749
不！
No!

205
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,555
- 他準是瘋了 - 不是瘋了，是肉
-He must be mad. -It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.

206
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,625
- 肉？ - 肉，太太，肉
-Meat? -Meat, ma'am, meat.

207
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:23,023
你給他吃得太多了
You've overfed him.

208
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:26,063
如果你一直給他喝粥的話 就不會有這種事情了
If you'd kept this boy on gruel, this would never have happened.

209
00:21:26,267 --> 00:21:29,532
天哪，真是好心沒好報
Dear, dear. This comes of being Iiberal.

210
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:32,167
到底是怎麼回事情？
What's all this?

211
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:35,001
奧利弗·忒斯特突然發狂了 蘇爾伯雷先生
OIiver Twist has turned violent, Mr. Sowerberry.

212
00:21:35,209 --> 00:21:37,939
看他把我的眼睛打的，先生
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

213
00:21:42,116 --> 00:21:44,311
你呀，你呀！
Now then. Now then.

214
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:48,352
- 你是個好孩子，不是嗎？ - 他侮辱我的媽媽
-You're a nice young fellow, ain't you? -He called my mother names.

215
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:52,583
要是他死了怎麼辦 你這個忘恩負義的傢伙！
Well, and what if he did, you Iittle ungrateful wretch!

216
00:21:52,793 --> 00:21:54,693
她活該，報應還不夠呢
She deserved what he said and worse.

217
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:56,089
- 不是的！ - 是的！
-She didn't! -She did!

218
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,992
你說謊！
It's a Iie!

219
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:06,406
別乾站著了，蘇爾伯雷先生 他說我扯謊呢
Do something, Mr. Sowerberry. He called me a Iiar.

220
00:22:07,842 --> 00:22:09,036
別乾站著了！
Do something!

221
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:36,515
對不起，小姐...
I beg your pardon, miss...

222
00:25:37,218 --> 00:25:39,846
...您能不能好心...？
...but would you be so kind--?

223
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:42,756
滾遠點
Get off my Iand.

224
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,585
我不歡迎乞丐，滾！
I don't want no beggars here. Go on!

225
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:49,559
滾！ 要不我就放狗了！
Get off! Or I'II put the dog on you!

226
00:26:29,069 --> 00:26:33,938
我沒有多少，就這點也夠救你的小命了
I haven't much, but you're more than welcome to it.

227
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:37,105
當心點，燙的
Be careful, it's hot.

228
00:26:47,955 --> 00:26:51,118
一看到你我的心就一抽
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

229
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:55,761
我眼睛不好使了，但...
My eyes ain't what they were. But...

230
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:59,592
...我一時把你....
...I just thought for a moment....

231
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,402
你這麼小，怎麼一個人出門？
Why are you on the road at all, a Iittle mite Iike you?

232
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:15,311
- 你要去哪兒？ - 倫敦，夫人
-Where are you headed? -London, ma'am.

233
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:17,683
倫敦？
London?

234
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,716
倫敦
London.

235
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,915
哦，天哪，天哪
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

236
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,704
你好，小哥
Hello, my man.

237
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:54,711
你這是怎麼了？
And what's your game?

238
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,841
你不住附近吧？
You're not from these parts?

239
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,379
打哪兒來的？
Where you from, then?

240
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:06,992
我已經走了7天了
I've been walking. Seven days.

241
00:29:07,194 --> 00:29:10,254
7天？啊！
Seven days? Cor.

242
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:11,658
我猜你想吃東西吧？
I expect you want grub?

243
00:29:12,699 --> 00:29:14,428
保準你能吃到
And you shall have it.

244
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:17,160
我現在手頭也有點緊...
I'm at a Iow-water mark meself just at the moment...

245
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:19,869
...但我會想辦法的
...but I'II fork out and stump.

246
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:22,838
來吧，站起來
Come on, up with you, on your pins.

247
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:32,343
這些不會再出來了吧？
And these won't get out again?

248
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,544
非常感謝
Thank you very much.

249
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,551
哦，順便說一下...
Oh, by the by...

250
00:29:36,757 --> 00:29:40,591
...我叫傑克·道金斯 大家都叫我機靈鬼
...my name is Jack Dawkins, better known as the Artful Dodger.

251
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:43,092
奧利弗·忒斯特
OIiver Twist.

252
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:47,224
你為什麼叫機靈鬼？
Why are you known as the Artful Dodger?

253
00:29:47,868 --> 00:29:49,768
這就是原因
That's why.

254
00:29:57,311 --> 00:29:59,211
有住的地方嗎？
Got any Iodgings?

255
00:29:59,413 --> 00:30:01,176
錢呢？
Money?

256
00:30:01,748 --> 00:30:05,206
看來今晚你要找地方睡覺了，是嗎？
I suppose you want someplace to sleep tonight, don't you?

257
00:30:41,955 --> 00:30:43,252
蠑螈
Baby newt.

258
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:46,688
蠑螈，4便士一個
Buy a baby newt, 4 pennies.

259
00:30:48,328 --> 00:30:51,764
你走這麼遠，不是鐵嘴的命令吧
I expect you walking for so Iong was a beak's order.

260
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:55,492
- 鐵嘴是什麼？ - 你不知道鐵嘴是什麼？
-What does that mean? -Don't you know what a beak is?

261
00:30:55,702 --> 00:30:58,694
- 是鳥嘴嗎？ - 啊，你還真是個雛兒
-A bird's mouth, isn't it? -Cor, you are green.

262
00:30:58,906 --> 00:31:02,137
鐵嘴就是治安推事，你到底是哪兒人啊？
A beak's a magistrate, my son. Where you been all your Iife?

263
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:03,969
你給我滾開！
Get off me, you!

264

你自找的，活該

好啊，好啊，奧利弗·忒斯特

We're very glad to see you, OIiver. Very.

279

機靈鬼，把香腸拿下來...

281
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:54,587
你看的是手帕，親愛的？
You were staring at the pocket handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?

282
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:56,756
不少吧？
There's a good many of them, ain't there?

283
00:32:56,957 --> 00:32:59,084
我們準備挑出來洗一洗
We've just Iooked them out, ready for the wash.

289
00:33:15,976 --> 00:33:19,776
快點喝，另一位先生還等著用杯子呢
Only, drink it quick because another of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

290
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:43,897
他是個好孩子
He's such a nice Iad.

291
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:47,540
我有種感覺，他會是把好手的

00:36:21,228 --> 00:36:23,219
你幹嗎監視我？ 你怎麼會醒著的？
What do you watch me for? Why are you awake?

304
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,057
你看見什麼了？ 說啊，孩子！
What have you seen? Speak out, boy!

305
00:36:25,265 --> 00:36:27,392
快說，否則要你命！
Quick. Quick, or it's your Iife!

306
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:29,660
我再也睡不著了，先生
I wasn't able to sleep any Ionger, sir.

307
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,360
如果打擾了您，我非常抱歉
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

308
00:36:31,571 --> 00:36:33,436
- 剛才你沒醒吧？ - 沒有，先生
-You were not awake a moment ago? -No, sir.

309
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,801
- 真的嗎？ - 真的, 先生
-You sure? -Yes, sir.

310
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:42,042
你當然是睡著了，我知道的，寶貝兒
Of course you were asleep, my dear. I know that.

311
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:44,043
我只是想嚇嚇你
I only tried to frighten you.

312
00:36:44,618 --> 00:36:47,143
你是個勇敢的孩子，奧利弗
You're a brave boy, OIiver.

313
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:51,582
你看見那些漂亮的玩意兒了嗎，寶貝兒？
Did you see any of those pretty things, my dear?

314

那些都是我的，奧利弗 我的一點可憐的財產
They're mine, OIiver. My Iittle property.

317
00:36:59,232 --> 00:37:01,462
是我養老用的
For my old age.

318
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:03,895
這是我們的小秘密
It's our secret.

319
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:07,100
- 明白了嗎，寶貝兒？ - 明白了，先生
-You understand, my dear? -Yes, sir.

320
00:37:08,174 --> 00:37:09,903
我現在可以起來了嗎，先生？
Can I go up now, sir?

321
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:15,141
起來吧....
Now....

322
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:57,919
我希望你們早上沒偷懶，寶貝們
I hope you've been at work this morning, my dears.

323
00:37:58,124 --> 00:37:59,318
- 可賣力了 - 盡心盡力
-Hard. -As nails.

324
00:37:59,526 --> 00:38:00,891
好孩子
Good boys.

325
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:02,561
好孩子
Good boys.

326
00:38:02,762 --> 00:38:05,287
- 給我看看，你有些什麼，機靈鬼？ - 幾個皮夾子
-What you got, Dodger? -Couple of pocketbooks.

327
00:38:05,498 --> 00:38:07,693
- 高檔嗎？ - 還不錯
-Lined? -Pretty well.

328
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,761
好啊

329
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:23,415
機靈鬼

330
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:26,080
我不知道，機靈鬼
I don't know, Dodge.

331
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,989
嗯...
Well...

332
00:38:31,191 --> 00:38:33,489
...好像有點輕...
...not as heavy as they might be...

333
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:35,092
...但很乾淨...

334
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:37,991
...做工也不錯
...and nicely made.

335
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:40,826
真是個機靈鬼，是嗎，奧利弗？
Ingenious workman, ain't he, OIiver?

336
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:42,729
是的，先生
Indeed, sir.

337
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:45,302
查理，你呢，寶貝兒？
And, Charley, what have you got, my dear?

338
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:47,530
- 小手巾兒 - 小手巾兒？
-Wipes. -Wipes?

339
00:38:51,911 --> 00:38:54,436
貨色不錯
They're very good ones.

340
00:38:54,648 --> 00:38:56,479
很不錯
Very.

341
00:39:01,221 --> 00:39:02,813
這個標記做得不好
You haven't marked them well.

342
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:07,952
得用針挑出來，我們--
The marks should be picked out with a needle. And we'II--

343
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:09,788
我們教奧利弗怎麼做
We'II teach OIiver how to do it.

344
00:39:09,996 --> 00:39:11,861
- 可以嗎，奧利弗？ - 請吧，先生
-Shall us, OIiver? -If you please, sir.

345
00:39:12,065 --> 00:39:15,694
你願意跟查理·貝茨一樣做手帕 是這樣嗎？
You'd Iike to make handkerchiefs as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

346
00:39:15,902 --> 00:39:18,462
非常樂意，如果您教我的話，先生
Very much indeed, if you'II teach me, sir.

347
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:21,641
我還沒見過這麼嫩的雛兒
I've never met anyone so green.

348
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:40,589
好了，孩子們...
Now then, boys...

349
00:39:40,794 --> 00:39:42,523

...the game.

350
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,357

00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:48,500
...如何做手帕

352
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:52,872
你願意玩遊戲嗎？
You'd Iike to play a game, wouldn't you?

353
00:39:53,073 --> 00:39:54,802
是的，先生

354
00:41:20,827 --> 00:41:23,796
- 幾點了，老爹？ - 現在是...

355
00:41:23,997 --> 00:41:26,261
...8點

356
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:39,106
- 在玩遊戲嗎，費金？ - 老一套了，親愛的
-PIaying the game, were we, Fagin? -As is our custom, my dear.

357
00:41:39,312 --> 00:41:42,770
- 他是新來的吧，叫什麼？ - 他叫奧利弗
-He's new. Who's he? -Oh, this is OIiver.

358
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:44,540
奧利弗...
OIiver...

359
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:49,517
...這倆位是好朋友，貝特和南希
...these are our very good friends Bet and Nancy.

360
00:41:52,025 --> 00:41:54,186
看見了嗎，機靈鬼，你得好好跟他學學
See, Dodger, you wanna Iearn from him.

361
00:41:54,661 --> 00:41:57,459
他多有禮貌啊，一位真正的紳士
He's got manners, he has. A proper gentleman.

362
00:41:57,864 --> 00:41:59,923
外面太冷了，所以我們才進來
We popped in because we were that cold inside.

363
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:03,694
隨時歡迎，親愛的
As is your custom, my dear.

364
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,734
- 查理 - 來吧，奧利弗，坐這兒來
-Charley. -Come on, OIiver. Join us.

365
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,170
還是說你不願意跟普通人坐一塊兒？
Or don't you sit with the common folk?

366
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:12,907
你得多加小心，奧利弗
Now, you wanna be careful of this Iot, OIiver.

367
00:42:13,112 --> 00:42:15,637
- 他們會教你... - 教他挑標記
-They'II have you picking-- -Picking out the marks.

368
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:19,148
我們教的就是這個，奧利弗，是嗎？
Just what we was teaching him, ain't it, OIiver, my dear?

369
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,115
- 是的，先生 - 「是的，先生」？
-Yes, sir. -"Yes, sir"?

370
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:24,119
你知道是對誰在說話吧？
You know who you're talking to, do you?

371
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:27,258
你到這兒來，你媽媽會怎麼說？
What's your mother got to say about you being here?

372
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,894
我沒有媽媽，我是孤兒
I haven't got a mother. I'm an orphan.

373
00:42:30,096 --> 00:42:31,586
那你就來對地方了
You're in the right company, then.

374
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:37,001
來吧，奧利弗，我來教你怎麼玩
Come on, OIiver, I'II teach you how to play.

375
00:42:37,203 --> 00:42:39,296
這叫做「偷機」
It's called Spec or Speculation.

376
00:42:39,505 --> 00:42:43,032
每人三張牌，他翻過來的那張...
Three cards each, and then the one he turns up...

377
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:45,211
...就是王牌
...is trumps.

378
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,315
這種日子是不是很快活啊，寶貝兒？
This is a pleasant Iife, ain't it, my dear?

379
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:05,557
- 我什麼時候可以出去呢？ - 快了，快了
-When can I go out, sir? -Soon. Soon.

380
00:43:06,933 --> 00:43:08,594
我們...
Let's--

381
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:11,326
來看看你都學會了什麼
Let's see what you've Iearned.

382
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:14,865
- 喜歡嗎？ - 喜歡，先生
-Would you Iike that? -Oh, yes, sir.

383
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:18,641
看你能不能在我不注意的情況下...
See if you can take this out...

384
00:43:19,312 --> 00:43:21,940
...把它拿出來
...without my feeling it.

385
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:50,506
拿走了嗎？
Is it gone?

386
00:43:52,478 --> 00:43:55,447
你真是個聰明的孩子，寶貝兒
You're a clever boy, my dear.

387
00:43:55,648 --> 00:43:58,776
我還沒見過更聰明的
I never saw a sharper Iad.

388
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:05,954
這是一個先令，拿去吧
Here's a shilling for you.

389
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:10,356
跟機靈鬼還有查理學著點
Make the Dodger and Charley your models.

390
00:44:10,563 --> 00:44:12,087
特別是機靈鬼，寶貝兒
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

391
00:44:12,298 --> 00:44:15,790
他會是個大人物的，你也會
He'II be a great man himself, make you one too.

392
00:44:16,002 --> 00:44:17,697
你就這麼下去...
You go on this way...

393
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,737
...會成為了不起的大人物
...you'II be the greatest man of the time.

394
00:44:23,376 --> 00:44:25,901
非常感謝，先生
Thank you very much, sir.

395
00:44:33,686 --> 00:44:37,349
漂亮的蘋果，來看看漂亮的蘋果

396
00:44:40,994 --> 00:44:43,554
來啊，本市最大的捲心菜

你是說那個寬邊的？

太貴了

00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:53,920
- 那位先生呢？ - 先生來了

418
00:46:54,127 --> 00:46:56,152
- 是這個孩子嗎？ - 恐怕是的
-Is this the boy, sir? -Yes, I'm afraid it is.

419
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,887
回答得真妙啊，「恐怕是的」
That's a good one. Did you hear him, "afraid it is"?

420
00:46:59,098 --> 00:47:02,397
- 可憐的傢伙，自己受傷了 - 是的，是我幹的，先生
-Poor fellow's hurt himself. -Yeah, I did that, sir.

421
00:47:02,602 --> 00:47:06,333
關節打到了他嘴上，可我攔下他了
Hurt me knuckle against his mouth. But I stopped him.

422
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:09,474
- 起來！ - 不是我，先生，不是我
-Get up! -It wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

423
00:47:09,675 --> 00:47:12,109
當然不是，小偷都這麼說
Of course it wasn't. It never is.

424
00:47:12,311 --> 00:47:13,972
- 起來 - 別傷了他
-Now get up. -Don't hurt him.

425
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,445
不，先生，我不會的

00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:28,216
- 下一個？ - 這是我的姓名和地址，先生
-What's next? -That is my name and address, sir.

428

Oh, no, no. He's not charged, Your Worship.

432
00:47:38,137 --> 00:47:39,934
他是來指控這個孩子的
He appears against the boy.

433
00:47:40,139 --> 00:47:41,731
- 讓他發誓 - 在我發誓之前...

434
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:44,501

-I will not, sir! -Hold your tongue this instant.

436
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:50,280
你是個魯莽無禮的傢伙

437
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:52,747
- 你竟敢辱罵推事 - 什麼？
-How dare you bully a magistrate. -What?

讓他發誓，我不想聽他廢話了 讓他發誓
Swear this person. I'II not hear another word. Swear him.

-What's the charge against the boy? -I was at a bookstore when--

441

閉嘴！警察呢？
Hold your tongue! Where's the policeman?

442
00:48:05,498 --> 00:48:07,762
警官，怎麼回事情？ 有證人嗎？
Policeman, what is this? Are there any witnesses?

443
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,265
- 沒有，大人 - 這孩子在生病
-None, Your Worship. -The boy is ill.

444
00:48:10,469 --> 00:48:13,063
是的，恐怕如此
Oh, yes, I daresay.

445
00:48:13,272 --> 00:48:16,366
過來，小乞丐，別在這裡耍花樣
Come along, you vagabond. None of your tricks here.

446
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:18,305
你叫什麼？
What's your name?

447
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:21,538
你叫什麼，你這個頑固的無賴？

448
00:48:21,747 --> 00:48:24,841
- 警官，他叫什麼名字？ - 你叫什麼，孩子？
-Officer, what's his name? -What's your name, boy?

449
00:48:25,418 --> 00:48:27,784
水，給我水

450
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,285
他的名字叫薩姆·沃特斯，大人

00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:35,690
- 沒固定的地方，大人 - 廢話
-Anywhere he can, Your Worship. -Stuff and nonsense.

453
00:48:35,895 --> 00:48:37,453
別耍我
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

454
00:48:37,663 --> 00:48:39,654
不，我想他真的是病了，大人
No, I think he really is ill, Your Worship.

455
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:42,732
我比你清楚，否則我就不姓方
I know better, or my name's not Fang.

456
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:45,062
站到旁邊去，他在裝死
Stand away, officer. He's shamming.

457
00:48:46,138 --> 00:48:47,696
即席判決他勞役三個月

458
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:49,772
退庭
Hard Iabor, of course. CIear the office.

459
00:48:49,976 --> 00:48:52,274
別，別！ 別帶走他
Stop. Stop, stop! Don't take him away.

460
00:48:52,478 --> 00:48:55,379
怎麼回事？ 這人是誰？ 把他趕出去
What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out.

461
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:59,779
- 退庭 - 我不出去，我有話要說！
-CIear the office. -I will not be turned out! I will speak!

462
00:48:59,986 --> 00:49:02,045
我都看見了，我是書店老闆
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

463
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:04,954
- 我要作證 - 你有什麼要說的？
-I demand to be heard. -What have you got to say?

464
00:49:05,157 --> 00:49:08,092
- 不是那個孩子 - 不是那個孩子？那是誰？
-It was not this boy. -Not this boy? Who was it, then?

465
00:49:08,294 --> 00:49:11,286
在那位先生看書的時候 偷他東西的，是另外兩個小孩
The robbery was committed by two others while the man was reading.

466
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:14,762
我看見了，看見這孩子都嚇呆了
I saw it done. I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed by it.

467
00:49:14,967 --> 00:49:16,264
你為什麼不早來？
Why didn't you come before?

468
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:19,996
- 沒人幫我看鋪子 - 你說看書？
-I hadn't a soul to mind the shop. -Reading, you say?

469
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,798
那麼說有書了
A book, I suppose.

470
00:49:22,275 --> 00:49:24,004
是的，就攥在他手上呢
Yes, the very one he has in his hand.

471
00:49:25,111 --> 00:49:27,011
天哪，我把這事給忘了
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.

472
00:49:27,213 --> 00:49:28,737
好啊，你也是個好人啊
Well, you're a nice one.

473
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:32,509
指控無辜的孩子
To prefer a charge against an innocent boy.

474
00:49:32,952 --> 00:49:35,750
我猜你是在一種極為可疑...
I consider, sir, that you've obtained that book...

475
00:49:35,955 --> 00:49:38,947
...極不光彩的情況下取得這本書的
...under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances.

476
00:49:39,158 --> 00:49:40,352
- 該死！ - 店主...
-Damn me! -Bookseller...

477
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:42,527
...你要指控他嗎？
...do you want to press charges against him?

478
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:44,161
- 當然不 - 好吧...
-Certainly not. -Well...

479

...你是不是覺得挺幸運的...

480
00:49:46,999 --> 00:49:49,297
...書的主人拒絕指控你
...that the owner of the book declines to prosecute.

481
00:49:49,602 --> 00:49:50,762
對這孩子的指控取消
The boy is discharged.

482
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,164
- 退庭 - 豈有此理
-CIear the office. -Damn me.

483
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:54,703
退庭！ 退庭！

488
00:50:05,751 --> 00:50:08,618
小心腳下樓梯
Mind that step. Just mind that step there.

489

What's become of the boy? Speak out, or I'II throttle you!

The traps have got him! Let go of me, will you?!

507
00:51:12,618 --> 00:51:13,812
大牛！

508
00:51:14,019 --> 00:51:17,420
誰扔的？誰往我頭上扔的？

What you up to, Fagin? III-treating the boys again?

513
00:51:34,373 --> 00:51:38,139
我奇怪他們怎麼還沒殺了你 如果換了是我，早動手了
A wonder they don't murder you. I would, if I was them.

514
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:42,075
別這麼大聲，你似乎不高興，比爾
Don't speak so Ioud. You seem out of sorts, Bill.

515

...I'm afraid he may say something which will get us into trouble.

523
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:09,805
你要被告發了，費金
You were blowed upon, Fagin.

526
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:19,177
...你的損失恐怕比我們大，親愛的
...it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me, my dear.

527
00:52:20,019 --> 00:52:21,316
那只能這麼著了
There's only one thing for it.

528
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,921
得找人到局子裡去看看 看看他怎麼樣了
Somebody's gotta find out at the office what's being done to him.

529
00:52:25,124 --> 00:52:27,092
總得有人去
Somebody's gotta get hold of him somehow.

530
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:30,456
我才不願意靠近警察局呢 為誰都不去
I ain't going near no police office. Not for nobody, nohow.

531
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:33,663
我有主意了，貝特會去的
I have it, the very thing. Bet will go.

532
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:36,426
- 是不是啊，親愛的？ - 如果我去的話，會遭雷劈的
-Won't you, my dear? -I'm blessed if I will.

533
00:52:36,635 --> 00:52:38,398
南希，親愛的，你說呢？
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

534
00:52:38,604 --> 00:52:41,664
不行，你這套把戲行不通，費金
It won't do. There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.

535
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:43,637
- 你那是什麼意思？ - 我說過了
-What do you mean by that? -What I say.

536
00:52:43,843 --> 00:52:45,743
你是最合適的
Why, you're just the very person for it.

537
00:52:45,945 --> 00:52:47,776
這兒沒人認識你
Nobody about here knows anything about you.

538
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,574
我也不想讓他們認識
And as I don't want them to neither.

539
00:52:50,783 --> 00:52:52,978
我也不會同意的，比爾
It's rather more "no" than "yes" with me, Bill.

540
00:52:53,185 --> 00:52:55,244
- 她會去的，費金 - 不，她不會，費金
-She'II go, Fagin. -No, she won't, Fagin.

541
00:52:55,454 --> 00:52:57,445
她會去的，費金
Yes, she will, Fagin.

542
00:53:08,334 --> 00:53:11,735
- 需要效勞嗎，女士？ - 我在找我的弟弟
-Can I help you, miss? -I'm Iooking for my Iittle brother.

543
00:53:12,438 --> 00:53:14,963
- 他是誰啊？ - 一個可愛的小男孩
-Now, who would he be? -A Iovely Iittle boy.

544
00:53:15,174 --> 00:53:18,405
很文雅，很有禮貌
Lovely manners. Gentle as falling snow.

545
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:21,276
不在我們這裡
We don't get many of those.

546
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,108
也許你該試試方先生的法庭
I think you'II be wanting Mr. Fang's court.

547
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:33,787
喬治，這位年輕女士要找她的弟弟
George, this here young Iady is Iooking for her brother.

548
00:53:33,993 --> 00:53:36,018
那個昏倒，後來走掉的
The one that fainted and got away with it.

549
00:53:36,228 --> 00:53:38,526
是啊，被一位先生帶走了
Oh, yeah. Gentleman took him away.

550
00:53:38,731 --> 00:53:41,859
什麼先生？老天爺啊，什麼先生？
What gentleman? Gracious heavens, what gentleman?

551
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:44,661
我想是住在本頓維爾
Well, Iives in Pentonville, I believe.

552
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,168
哦，老天
Oh, my God.

553
00:53:47,706 --> 00:53:49,765
不，不，等等，等等
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:52,375
他還有張名片在這裡
His card's here somewhere.

555
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:54,874
給
Here we are.

556
00:54:01,754 --> 00:54:03,881
謝謝，先生
Thank you, sir.

557
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,178
布朗羅先生
Mr. Brownlow.

558
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,477
布朗羅先生
Mr. Brownlow.

559
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:37,008
他身上有種東西...
There's something in him...

560
00:55:37,216 --> 00:55:40,117
...觸動了我，貝德溫太太
...that touched my heart, Mrs. Bedwin.

561
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,344
說不清楚
Can't explain it.

562
00:55:42,554 --> 00:55:45,318
我也有這種感覺，先生
I feel the same, sir.

563
00:55:45,524 --> 00:55:47,549
他是誰？幹什麼的？
Who is he? What is he?

564
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,523
你對他一無所知
You know nothing of him.

565
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:51,855
他發燒了，那又怎麼了？
He had a fever. What of that?

566
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,788
壞人也會發燒的
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

567
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,798
我知道在牙買加有個傢伙 因為謀殺主人而被絞死
I knew a man in Jamaica who was hanged for murdering his master.

568
00:55:58,003 --> 00:56:00,198
他發過6次燒
He had a fever six times.

569
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:03,565
- 我知道他身上有善良的品質 - 你怎麼知道的？
-I know there is goodness in him. -How do you know it?

570
00:56:03,776 --> 00:56:05,300
善良和無辜
Goodness and innocence.

571
00:56:05,811 --> 00:56:08,336
- 我第一眼看到他就知道了 - 他會騙人的
-I knew it the first moment I saw him. -He'II deceive you.

572
00:56:08,547 --> 00:56:10,481
一有機會就會讓你失望...
Let you down at the first opportunity...

573
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:13,345
...就像你以前做的那些善事一樣
...Iike all your other good and innocent causes.

574
00:56:13,552 --> 00:56:18,080
如果那孩子是善良無辜的 我就把自己的腦袋吃了，先生
If that boy's good and innocent, I'II eat my own head, sir.

575
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:29,162
感覺如果，親愛的？
How do you feel, my dear?

576
00:56:29,368 --> 00:56:31,063
很高興，先生
Very happy, sir.

577
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:35,229
- 非常感謝您，先生 - 好孩子
-And very grateful to you indeed, sir. -Good boy.

578
00:56:36,275 --> 00:56:39,972
有沒有給他吃過東西了 貝德溫？吃過流食了嗎？
Have you given him any nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops?

579
00:56:40,179 --> 00:56:43,080
不是流食，先生，是肉湯
Not slops, sir. Broth.

580
00:56:43,716 --> 00:56:45,240
還有幾杯葡萄酒...
A couple of glasses of port wine...

581
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:48,011
...對他的身體大有好處
...would have done him a great deal more good.

582
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:50,279
是嗎，薩姆？
Wouldn't they, Sam?

583
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:52,457
我叫奧利弗，先生
My name is OIiver, sir.

584
00:56:52,658 --> 00:56:54,489
奧利弗？
OIiver?

585
00:56:54,993 --> 00:56:58,724
- 奧利弗什麼？奧利弗·沃特斯？ - 不，先生，忒斯特，奧利弗·忒斯特
-OIiver what? OIiver Waters? -No, sir. Twist. OIiver Twist.

586
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:02,363
你為什麼告訴推事，你叫沃特斯？
Why did you tell the magistrate your name was Waters?

587
00:57:02,568 --> 00:57:04,433
我沒這麼告訴他，先生
I never told him so, sir.

588
00:57:05,337 --> 00:57:08,272
- 你沒有？ - 沒有，先生
-You did not? -No, sir.

589
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:13,773
- 你不是在生我的氣吧，先生？ - 不，沒有
-You're not angry with me, are you? -No, no.

590
00:57:14,913 --> 00:57:16,471
奇怪的名字
Queer name.

591
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:17,910
奧利弗·忒斯特
OIiver Twist.

592
00:57:20,185 --> 00:57:23,245
這裡的書很多吧，孩子？
There are a great many books, are there not, my boy?

593
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:25,650
是非常多，先生
A great number, sir.

594
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:28,088
從來沒看過這麼多
Never saw so many.

595
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:32,793
你想長大成為一個智者...
How would you Iike to grow up a clever man...

596
00:57:32,998 --> 00:57:34,966
...撰寫書籍嗎？
...and write books?

597
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:37,692
我寧可讀書，先生
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

598
00:57:37,903 --> 00:57:40,633
為什麼不想當作家呢？
Wouldn't you Iike to be a book writer?

599
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,401
我想做一個賣書的也許更好，先生
I think it'd be a better thing to be a bookseller, sir.

600
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:50,971
你說得真不錯
You have said a very good thing.

601
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:52,645
好吧
Well, well.

602
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:56,252
我們不會把你培養成作家 只要學門正當的手藝就行
We won't make an author of you while there's an honest trade to be Iearned...

603
00:57:56,455 --> 00:57:58,616
...或者去學制磚
...or brickmaking to turn to.

604
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:02,123
- 你是要趕我走嗎，先生？ - 不，我親愛的孩子
-Are you going to send me away, sir? -No, my dear child.

605
00:58:02,327 --> 00:58:05,057
你不必擔心我拋棄你...
You need not be afraid that I am going to desert you...

606
00:58:05,264 --> 00:58:07,732
- ...除非你給我這麼做的理由 - 不會的，永遠都不會，先生
-...unless you give me cause. -I never, never will, sir.

607
00:58:07,933 --> 00:58:09,127
希望如此...
I hope not...

608
00:58:09,334 --> 00:58:12,201
...因為我非常願意相信你 我為此也感到奇怪
...because I feel strongly disposed to trust you.

609
00:58:12,404 --> 00:58:13,666
謝謝，先生
Thank you, sir.

610
00:58:23,182 --> 00:58:25,343
我很高興不用再穿這些了
I'm pleased I won't have to wear those again.

611
00:58:25,551 --> 00:58:27,280
我們也很高興，親愛的
So are we all, my dear.

612
00:58:29,721 --> 00:58:31,450
給
There.

613
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,111
您們好
Hello.

614
00:59:30,315 --> 00:59:31,976
他是誰啊？
What's that?

615
00:59:32,184 --> 00:59:34,049
這是小奧利弗·忒斯特
This is young OIiver Twist.

616
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:35,914
書店的夥計拿來一個包裹
The bookseller's boy brought a package.

617
00:59:36,121 --> 00:59:39,613
哦，追上他，奧利弗 我還有些書要還回去
Oh, stop him, OIiver. There's some books to go back.

618
00:59:39,613 --> 00:59:42,707
- 他就是那個得了感冒的孩子？ - 沒錯，就是
-Is that the boy who had the fever? -That's the boy.

619
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,199
當心點！
Mind out!

620
01:00:10,177 --> 01:00:13,874
- 先生，沒看到他 - 噢，真讓人難過
-No sign of him, sir. -Oh, dear, I'm very sorry for that.

621
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:16,514
有幾本書我很想今晚就還了
I particularly wished some books to be returned tonight.

622
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:20,413
為什麼不讓奧立弗去？ 讓他去絕送對不會出問題
Why not send OIiver with them? He'II be sure to deliver them safely.

623
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,053
是的，您就交給我吧
Yes, do Iet me take them.

624
01:00:22,255 --> 01:00:25,383
先生，如果你願意的話，我可以跑過去
If you please, sir. I'II run all the way.

625
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,401
去吧，親愛的
You shall go, my dear.

626
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:37,627
讓貝德溫太太告訴你怎麼走
Ask Mrs. Bedwin to show you the way.

627
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:41,466
- 等等，奧立弗 - 是的，先生
-And, OIiver.... -Yes, sir?

628
01:00:41,675 --> 01:00:44,508
把這個給書店老闆
Give the bookseller this.

629
01:00:47,948 --> 01:00:50,007
我欠他的錢
The money I owe him.

630
01:00:56,556 --> 01:00:58,319
我馬上回來,先生
I won't be Iong, sir.

631
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,919
- 你覺得這一去要多長時間？ - 你真覺得他會回來嗎？
-How Iong do you think it'II take him? -You really expect him to come back?

632
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:08,361
- 你覺得不會？ - 帶著5英鎊？
-You don't? -With a £5 note in his pocket?

633
01:01:08,568 --> 01:01:10,229
不，我不相信
No, I do not.

634
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,499
如果那個孩子回來的話...
If ever that boy returns to this house...

635
01:01:13,707 --> 01:01:15,732
...我把自己的頭吃掉，先生
...I'II eat my own head, sir.

636
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:18,371
還有你的頭
And yours.

637
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,296
噢，弟弟！
Oh, my Iittle brother!

638
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:40,560
- 我沒看錯吧？ - 放開我，救命！
-I don't believe my eyes. -Let me go. Help!

639
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:44,635
- 上天有眼啊，我找到他了！ - 放開我！
-It's a miracle. Oh, I've found him. -PIease Iet me go.

640
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:47,602
- 噢，奧立弗，奧立弗 - 南希
-Oh, OIiver. OIiver. -Nancy.

641
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:51,140
你太調皮了，為了你我受了多少苦啊
You're such a naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your account.

642
01:01:51,344 --> 01:01:53,437
- 放開我！ - 小姐，這是怎麼回事？
-Let go of me! -What's the matter, ma'am?

643
01:01:53,647 --> 01:01:55,376
他離家出走了
He ran away from his parents.

644
01:01:55,582 --> 01:01:57,846
- 放開我！ - 他們勤勤懇懇、受人敬重...
-Get off me! -Hard-working, respectable people...

645
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:00,611
...而他倒和一幫小賊和壞蛋混在一起
...and joined a set of thieves and bad characters.

646
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,117
他媽媽的心可傷透了
Broke his mother's heart.

647
01:02:02,322 --> 01:02:04,790
- 可憐的孩子 - 回家吧，你這個小混蛋
Young wretch. Go home, you Iittle brute.

648
01:02:04,991 --> 01:02:06,458
我沒有爸媽！
I haven't got any parents.

649
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,423
我是孤兒！ 我住在本頓維爾
I'm an orphan. I Iive in Pentonville.

650
01:02:08,628 --> 01:02:10,823
噢，別聽他的，這也敢說啊
Oh, only hear him, how he braves it out.

651
01:02:11,031 --> 01:02:13,261
- 什麼？小奧立弗 - 是真的
-What? Young OIiver. -It's true.

652
01:02:15,268 --> 01:02:17,259
回到你可憐的媽媽身邊去！
You come home to your poor mother.

653
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:20,530
他們不能管我！我不認識他們！ 救命啊！救命！
I don't belong to them! I don't know them! Help! Help!

654
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,934
「救命，救命」？
"Help, help"?

655
01:02:22,142 --> 01:02:25,407
我來救你的命，你個小混蛋！
I'II give you "help, help," you Iittle wretch!

656
01:02:25,612 --> 01:02:27,170
這些書哪來的？
And these books.

657
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,076
是你偷來的？對嗎？
Have you been a-stealing them, have you, eh?

658
01:02:30,283 --> 01:02:33,719
- 你這個小混蛋 - 就是，你要好好教訓他
-You Iittle villain. -That's right. You give it to him.

659
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,151
- 否則他還是不懂事 - 我會的，夫人
-Only way to bring him to his senses. -I will, missus.

660
01:02:37,357 --> 01:02:39,120
跟我走，你這個小混蛋
And you come with me, you Iittle wretch.

661
01:02:39,326 --> 01:02:41,021
這樣對他有好處
It'II do him good.

662
01:02:41,227 --> 01:02:43,695
- 這個男人是誰？救命啊！ - 大牛，看著他，好樣的
-Who is this man? Help! -Bullseye, mind him, boy.

663
01:02:43,897 --> 01:02:46,365
- 看著他 - 救命，救命！
-Mind him. -Help! Help!

664
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,801
你看看他，費金
Look at him, Fagin.

665
01:02:50,003 --> 01:02:52,198
誰來扶我一下
Hold me, somebody.

666
01:02:52,405 --> 01:02:54,965
誰來扶我一下，我要笑歪了
Hold me, somebody, while I Iaugh it out.

667
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:57,268
你看他穿的，費金
Look at his togs, Fagin.

668
01:02:57,477 --> 01:03:00,105
很高興看到你這麼好，親愛的
Delighted to see you Iooking so well, my dear.

669
01:03:00,313 --> 01:03:02,941
為什麼不提前寫封信，說你要來啊？
Why didn't you write, my dear, and say you was coming?

670
01:03:03,149 --> 01:03:06,277
那樣我們就可以弄點熱菜晚上吃了
We'd have got something warm for supper.

671
01:03:06,486 --> 01:03:09,182
- 你好啊，費金，那是什麼？ - 那是我的，費金
Hello, Fagin. What's that? That's mine, Fagin.

672
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:12,051
不不，親愛的，那是我的，比爾，我的 那些書你拿去吧
Oh, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine. You shall have the books.

673
01:03:12,258 --> 01:03:14,920
如果你不給我和南希，那我就把孩子帶回去
If that ain't mine and Nancy's, I'II take the boy back again.

674
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:16,390
來吧，拿過來
Come on, hand over, will you?

675
01:03:16,596 --> 01:03:18,723
這太不公平了吧，比爾 不公平啊，南希
This is hardly fair, Bill. Hardly fair, Nancy.

676
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:22,333
我才不管公不公平，給我拿過來
Fair or not fair, hand over, I tell you.

677
01:03:22,535 --> 01:03:26,096
拿過來，你這個貪心的老骨頭，拿來！
Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton. Give it here!

678
01:03:26,306 --> 01:03:29,503
你給我們帶來這麼多麻煩 再拿這麼多來都不夠還！
That's for our share of the trouble, and not half enough neither.

679
01:03:29,943 --> 01:03:33,379
如果你喜歡讀書就留著吧，要麼就賣掉
You may keep the books if you're fond of reading. If you ain't, sell them.

680
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,639
這些書真漂亮啊 字也很漂亮，是嗎，奧立弗？
They're very pretty. Beautiful writing, isn't it, OIiver?

681
01:03:37,851 --> 01:03:40,843
要送回去，這些書是布朗羅先生的！
Send them back. They belong to Mr. Brownlow.

682
01:03:41,054 --> 01:03:42,885
這些書和錢都要送回去
Send them back. The books and the money.

683
01:03:43,623 --> 01:03:44,817
他會以為是我偷了的
He'II think I stole them.

684
01:03:45,025 --> 01:03:46,822
- 求你了，送回去吧 - 這孩子說的沒錯
-PIease send them back. -The boy's right.

685
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:50,588
沒錯，奧立弗，沒錯 他們會認為是你偷的
You're right, OIiver. You're right. They will think you've stolen them.

686
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:54,489
真是太好了，事情真是巧啊
It couldn't have happened better if we'd chosen our time.

687
01:03:54,701 --> 01:03:56,601
救命啊，警察！
Help! Help! Police!

688
01:03:56,803 --> 01:03:59,101
叫警察？讓你叫！
Fetch the police! The police!

689
01:03:59,873 --> 01:04:02,398
管住這條狗，比爾 孩子會被它咬成幾塊的
Keep back the dog, Bill. He'II tear the boy to pieces.

690
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:05,510
- 那是活該 - 救命！叫警察！
-Serve him right. -Help! Fetch the police!

691
01:04:06,513 --> 01:04:07,707
叫警察！
Fetch the police!

692
01:04:07,914 --> 01:04:10,212
走開，否則我把你的頭劈成兩半！
Step aside, or I'II split your head against the wall.

693
01:04:10,417 --> 01:04:11,509
我不在乎
I don't care.

694
01:04:11,718 --> 01:04:15,210
我不會讓那條狗把孩子咬死 除非你先殺了我
That child shan't be torn down by the dog unless you kill me first.

695
01:04:17,123 --> 01:04:19,956
大牛，來，大牛！
Bullseye. Here. Bullseye!

696
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:29,000
機靈鬼！
Dodger!

697
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:31,834
跟著他！
Get after him!

698
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:37,869
放開我！
Take your hands off me!

699
01:05:09,008 --> 01:05:11,909
你想逃嗎，親愛的？
So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?

700
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:14,376
想報警，對嗎？
Wanted to call for the police, did you?

701
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,311
我們待會兒會好好治治你
We'II soon cure you of that.

702
01:05:18,885 --> 01:05:21,752
我不能眼睜睜的看著你這樣做，費金
I won't stand by and see this done, Fagin.

703
01:05:21,955 --> 01:05:23,889
孩子你已經抓到了，你還想怎麼樣？
You got the boy. What more do you want?

704
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,150
別出聲，南希 否則我會叫你以後都說不出話來
Keep quiet, Nancy, or I'II quieten you for a good Iong time to come.

705
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,328
就讓他這樣好了，隨他去！
Let him be. Let him be!

706
01:05:29,529 --> 01:05:31,724
你還真要做這孩子的好朋友啊
You're a fine one for the boy to make a friend of.

707
01:05:31,931 --> 01:05:33,956
老天為證，我就是這樣
God AImighty help me, I am.

708
01:05:34,167 --> 01:05:37,603
他偷東西、撒謊、討人厭，也就這樣了
He's a thief, a Iiar, a devil, all that's bad from this night forth.

709
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:40,295
你這個老頭還嫌打他不夠嗎？
Ain't that enough for the old wretch without blows?

710
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:43,408
好了，好了 我們講話要文明點，文明點
Come, come, we must have civil words. Civil words.

711
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:46,909
文明？ 你跟我說文明？你這個老鬼！
Civil words? Civil words, you old villain!

712
01:05:47,113 --> 01:05:49,946
我打小孩時起就幫你偷東西 還沒有他一半歲數呢
I thieved for you when I was a child not half as old as this.

713
01:05:50,150 --> 01:05:51,617
你總要活命吧
It's your Iiving.

714
01:05:51,818 --> 01:05:55,015
沒錯，是你這個老鬼逼我這樣的
Yes, and you're the wretch that drove me to it...

715
01:05:55,221 --> 01:05:59,385
讓我走上這條路 日日夜夜，直到死為止！
...and who will keep me at it, day and night, till I die!

716
01:06:02,095 --> 01:06:05,861
機靈鬼，查理，讓奧立弗去睡吧
Dodger, Charley, put OIiver to bed.

717
01:06:06,065 --> 01:06:08,693
最好把那些衣服脫掉 穿這麼好去睡覺太不像話了
Best to take them clothes off. They're too good to sleep in.

718
01:06:08,902 --> 01:06:12,338
查理說得對 這套衣服要4個半便士呢
Charley's right. This here suit cost more than 4 pence ha'penny.

719
01:06:12,539 --> 01:06:15,804
我從來沒摸過這麼舒服的料子 你呢，機靈鬼？
I never felt such Iovely stuff. Have you, Dodger?

720
01:06:16,276 --> 01:06:18,141
我沒穿過，不過我敢打賭...
Not me. But I'm willing to Iay odds...

721
01:06:18,344 --> 01:06:21,905
...女王穿的衣服就是用這個料子的
...this is the same stuff the queen wears on Sundays.

722
01:06:24,417 --> 01:06:25,975
快，抓住他
Quick, get him.

723
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,120
脫掉
Take it off.

724
01:06:30,857 --> 01:06:32,051
把他抬起來
Lift him up.

725
01:06:32,258 --> 01:06:34,522
好了
Up he goes.

726
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:39,191
脫鞋子
Get them shoes off.

727
01:07:15,235 --> 01:07:17,601
吃點午飯吧，親愛的？
Little something for your Iuncheon, my dear?

728
01:07:34,787 --> 01:07:36,550
我們聊一會，好嗎？
Shall we have a Iittle chat?

729
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:39,454
奧立弗？
OIiver?

730
01:07:39,692 --> 01:07:41,455
好不好？
Shall us?

731
01:07:44,097 --> 01:07:46,588
我覺得你這麼久沒聽過人說話...
I expect you'd welcome...

732
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:51,600
...應該會喜歡聽到才對啊 對嗎，親愛的？
...the sound of a human voice again, eh, my dear?

733
01:07:56,709 --> 01:07:58,506
你知不知道...
Do you know...

734
01:07:59,045 --> 01:08:03,379
...我覺得世上最大的罪過是什麼，親愛的？
...what I consider the greatest sin in the world, my dear?

735
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:07,012
忘恩負義
Ingratitude.

736
01:08:08,688 --> 01:08:10,883
也就是你所犯的罪過...
And that's what you're guilty of...

737
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,149
...忘恩負義
...ingratitude.

738
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:16,726
我們帶你回來，愛你 要不是我們，你早就餓死了
We took you in, we cherished you. If we hadn't, you'd have died of hunger.

739
01:08:16,929 --> 01:08:18,590
你怎麼報答我們呢？ 你逃跑了…
How do you repay us? You run away...

740
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:24,134
...還跑去叫警察 你讓我們擔心，還花費了不少
...you cry out for the police, you cause us great anxiety and expense.

741
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:31,275
過去也有個小傢伙，很像你 我對他就像他爸爸一樣好
There was a Iad once, just Iike you, and I was a father to him.

742
01:08:31,477 --> 01:08:33,945
可是他和你一樣，也逃跑了 他確實找到了警察
He ran away, Iike you. He indeed went to the police.

743
01:08:34,147 --> 01:08:37,139
你知道他落得什麼下場嗎？
And can you guess how he ended up?

744
01:08:39,952 --> 01:08:42,420
他被吊死了...
They hanged him...

745
01:08:42,622 --> 01:08:45,147
...就在老城法庭
...at the OId Bailey.

746
01:08:45,825 --> 01:08:50,762
我們提供了一些證據，雖然不全是真的...
Certain evidence was made available, not all of it precisely true...

747
01:08:51,631 --> 01:08:55,590
...但足以保證我自己...
...but all of it necessary to provide for my own safety...

748
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,565
...和我朋友的安全
...and that of my friends.

749
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:00,534
就是這樣，可憐的孩子
Yeah. Poor boy.

750
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,108
被吊死了
Hanged.

751
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:06,008
絞刑很嚇人的，奧立弗
It's a terrible thing, hanging, OIiver.

752
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:08,339
天剛亮，在絞刑架上...
Dawn, the gallows...

753
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:10,846
...有繩子、有套索
...the rope, the noose.

754
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:13,348
你不一定要有罪，對吧，奧立弗
You don't always have to be guilty, you see, OIiver.

755
01:09:13,553 --> 01:09:15,214
這年頭他們要吊死你可不講什麼道理
They hang you for anything these days.

756
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:18,356
因為他們很喜歡吊人
That's because they're so very fond of hanging.

757
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,267
但是如果你按我說的做...
But if you do as you're told...

758
01:09:30,803 --> 01:09:33,829
...我們還會是好朋友的
...we'II be very good friends yet.

759
01:09:42,949 --> 01:09:46,578
奧立弗，你可以到處走走了
You must feel free to walk about now, OIiver.

760
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:49,911
沒錯，隨便哪裡
Yes, feel free.

761
01:09:57,497 --> 01:10:00,398
- 來這裡，奧立弗 - 什麼事？
-Here, OIiver. -Yes?

762
01:10:00,933 --> 01:10:03,697
你馬上過來，為我打扮打扮
I'd Iike you to assist me in my toilet straightaway.

763
01:10:04,771 --> 01:10:08,764
- 可以幫一下忙嗎，小伙子？ - 沒問題，我我希望有人陪陪
-Will you do that for me, my man? -AII right. I'II be glad to have company.

764
01:10:08,975 --> 01:10:13,412
這才是好小子嘛 來，先為我腳套上光
There's a good fellow. You may start by japanning my trotter-cases.

765
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:16,081
簡單點說，就是幫我擦擦鞋
In plain English, clean my boots.

766
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:22,420
真可惜，他不是個三隻手
What a pity he ain't a prig.

767
01:10:22,622 --> 01:10:25,022
他不知道什麼才是好的
He don't know what's good for him.

768
01:10:25,224 --> 01:10:26,919
我看你不知道什麼是三隻手吧？
I suppose you don't know what a prig is.

769
01:10:27,126 --> 01:10:29,356
我知道的，三隻手是....
Yes, I do. It's a....

770
01:10:29,562 --> 01:10:32,190
就是賊
It's a thief.

771
01:10:32,398 --> 01:10:33,888
你就是三隻手，對嗎？
You're one, aren't you?

772
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:36,830
對，我是，我們都是 連那條狗都是...
Yes, I am. And so we all are. Down to the dog...

773
01:10:37,036 --> 01:10:38,799
...那狗摸起來舒服到家了
...and he's the downiest one of the Iot.

774
01:10:39,005 --> 01:10:40,973
它也從來不會告密
And the Ieast given to peaching.

775
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:43,199
最多只會在證人席上吠兩下...
He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness box...

776
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:48,176
- ...也不敢說主人壞話 - 它可是地地道道的基督教徒呢
-...for fear of committing himself. -He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

777
01:10:48,381 --> 01:10:50,906
你為什麼要跟著費金，奧立弗？
Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, OIiver?

778
01:10:51,117 --> 01:10:52,948
否則你會立即發大財的
You'II make a fortune out of hand.

779
01:10:53,152 --> 01:10:56,986
像本頓維爾的老先生家，就是那個大房子
Like your old gentleman in Pentonville. Big house, that.

780
01:10:57,190 --> 01:11:00,421
我偷偷看過裡面，很漂亮嘛，對吧？
I had a peep at it, I did. Nice inside, was it?

781
01:11:00,626 --> 01:11:05,029
是的，我還睡過真正的床，有自己的房間
Yes. And I slept in a proper bed. In my own room.

782
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:08,826
- 牆上的東西也不錯，對吧？ - 確實是
-Good stuff on the walls, eh? -Yes. Indeed.

783
01:11:09,035 --> 01:11:10,502
根在費金後面...
Put yourself under Fagin...

784
01:11:10,703 --> 01:11:14,161
...你就沒有那樣的好房子啦
...and you'II be able to retire to a property just Iike that.

785
01:11:14,373 --> 01:11:16,341
也不能像以前那麼風光了
And do the genteel.

786
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:18,601
不，他害怕，怕挨繩圈子
No, he's scared he'II come to be scragged.

787
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:20,369
我不知道你說什麼
I don't know what that means.

788
01:11:24,851 --> 01:11:27,479
如果你不拿手帕和手錶，諾利...
If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs and watches, Nolly...

789
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:31,014
...還有別的傢伙會去拿 你會做的，別人也會做
...some other cove will. You have the same right to them as they have.

790
01:11:31,224 --> 01:11:33,954
當然啦，當然啦
To be sure. To be sure.

791
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,890
道理很簡單，親愛的，很簡單
It all Iies in a nutshell, my dear, in a nutshell.

792
01:11:37,096 --> 01:11:38,393
要相信機靈鬼的話
Take the Dodger's word for it.

793
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:41,533
他可是相當懂行的
He understands the catechism of his trade.

794
01:11:53,012 --> 01:11:54,877
車伕？
Cabby?

795
01:12:14,834 --> 01:12:17,826
- 我從比爾哪兒來 - 為什麼？
-I've come from Bill. -For what?

796
01:12:18,037 --> 01:12:21,529
- 反正不是壞事 - 我不信
-For no harm. -I don't believe it.

797
01:12:22,708 --> 01:12:25,973
我要是能幫你的話早就幫了，就是沒能力
If I could help you, I would, but I've not the power.

798
01:12:26,178 --> 01:12:29,045
我答應過他要讓你乖點，安靜點
Now, I've promised him you'II be good and silent.

799
01:12:29,248 --> 01:12:32,183
否則，你只會給自己添麻煩
If you're not, you'II only do yourself harm.

800
01:12:32,385 --> 01:12:34,353
還給我添麻煩
And me too.

801
01:12:43,996 --> 01:12:45,827
他沒鬧吧？
Did he come quiet?

802
01:12:46,032 --> 01:12:48,023
像只小羊羔一樣乖
Like a Iamb.

803
01:12:50,236 --> 01:12:52,067
坐下
Sit down.

804
01:12:56,809 --> 01:12:59,903
我來給你上一課
And Iet me read you a Iecture.

805
01:13:06,218 --> 01:13:07,549
你知道這是什麼嗎？
You know what this is?

806
01:13:08,454 --> 01:13:11,582
- 知道 - 好的
-Yes. -Well, then.

807
01:13:15,361 --> 01:13:17,625
這是火藥
This is powder.

808
01:13:25,237 --> 01:13:26,431
這是子彈
That here's a bullet.

809
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:33,307
這是從舊帽子上取下的一小塊...
And this is a Iittle bit of an old hat...

810
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:35,570
...用來做彈塞
...for wadding.

811
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:46,320
- 這樣就上好膛了 - 是的，我看到了，先生
-Now it's Ioaded. -Yes, I can see it is, sir.

812
01:13:46,959 --> 01:13:49,359
我們出去的時候，除非我要跟你講話...
If you speak a word when you're out of doors with me...

813
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:51,496
...如果你敢自己說一句話...
...unless I speak to you...

814
01:13:51,697 --> 01:13:54,894
...這顆子彈就立馬鑽進你腦袋裡
...this Ioading will go in your head without notice.

815
01:13:55,101 --> 01:13:58,798
就是說，如果你決定擅自開口說話...
So if you do make up your mind to speak without Ieave...

816
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:00,597
...那就先把禱告做了吧
...says your prayers first.

817
01:14:01,507 --> 01:14:04,670
讓我明說了吧，你就是想說 要是讓他搞砸了...
The short and Iong of what you mean is that if you're crossed by him...

818
01:14:04,877 --> 01:14:06,970
...你就會讓他腦袋吃一顆子彈...
...you'II prevent him from telling tales after...

819
01:14:07,179 --> 01:14:09,113
...不讓他把事情抖出去
...by shooting him through the head.

820
01:14:09,315 --> 01:14:11,681
這樣你就碰上好運氣，不用被吊死了
And you'II take your chance of swinging for it.

821
01:14:11,884 --> 01:14:15,445
沒錯，女人總是三兩句話就能把事情說清楚
That's it. Women always put things in the fewest words.

822
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:17,747
晚飯，南希
Supper, Nancy.

823
01:14:17,957 --> 01:14:20,118
動手前打會盹兒
And then a snooze afore starting.

824
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:51,615
好哥們，比爾
My pal Bill.

825
01:14:51,824 --> 01:14:54,486
門沒關，進來吧
The door's open, come in.

826
01:14:56,595 --> 01:14:59,120
別嚷那麼大聲！
Don't make such a row.

827
01:15:02,468 --> 01:15:03,935
點盞燈，托比
Show us a glim, Toby.

828
01:15:04,136 --> 01:15:07,367
巴尼，點燈，帶這位先生進來
Barney, a glim. Show the gentleman in.

829
01:15:07,707 --> 01:15:12,337
巴尼？起來啊，幫幫忙
Barney? Wake up first, if convenient.

830
01:15:23,656 --> 01:15:26,420
塞克斯先生，請進，請進
Mr. Sykes. Come in, sir, come in.

831
01:15:45,177 --> 01:15:48,044
比爾，老兄，很高興看到你
Bill, my boy. GIad to see you.

832
01:15:49,749 --> 01:15:51,683
這是...？
Who's...?

833
01:15:51,884 --> 01:15:53,784
- 這是誰？ - 就是那個孩子
-Who's this? -Only the boy.

834
01:15:53,986 --> 01:15:57,251
- 費金先生的徒弟？ - 沒錯，時候到了
-One of Mr. Fagin's Iads? -Yeah. It's time.

835
01:15:57,456 --> 01:15:59,151
沒錯
Right.

836
01:16:00,493 --> 01:16:01,824
拿炮筒子來，巴尼
Barkers for me, Barney.

837
01:16:11,036 --> 01:16:13,630
- 上了膛的 - 好的
-They're Ioaded. -Good.

838
01:16:21,447 --> 01:16:24,473
- 你的傢伙呢？ - 拿好了
-The persuaders? -Got them.

839
01:16:28,621 --> 01:16:30,384
鑰匙、鑽頭
Keys, center bits.

840
01:16:34,794 --> 01:16:36,989
黑皮燈
Darkies.

841
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,674
沒漏掉什麼吧？
Nothing forgotten?

842
01:17:00,519 --> 01:17:02,578
好了，沒聲音了
Yeah, it's all quiet.

843
01:17:52,938 --> 01:17:55,998
不行的，不行的
I can't. I can't.

844
01:17:56,342 --> 01:17:58,037
你得去
You will.

845
01:17:58,244 --> 01:17:59,677
是布朗羅先生的房子
It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

846
01:18:29,441 --> 01:18:31,238
求你了，別讓我頭他家的東西
Have mercy. Don't make me steal from him.

847
01:18:31,443 --> 01:18:33,843
- 求求你了 - 來這兒
-Have mercy on me. -Come here.

848
01:18:34,046 --> 01:18:36,412
看在上帝的份上，讓我跑掉，死在田里算了
For God's sake, Iet me run away and die in the fields.

849
01:18:36,615 --> 01:18:39,982
- 我再也不到倫敦來了 - 閉嘴
-I'II never come near London, never. -Shut it.

850
01:18:40,185 --> 01:18:44,144
站起來，否則我讓你腦漿濺到草地上去
Get up. Or I'II strew your brains on the grass.

851
01:19:24,763 --> 01:19:26,924
我把你放進去
I'm putting you through there.

852
01:19:27,132 --> 01:19:29,930
你到前門去，把門開了
Go to the front door and unfasten it.

853
01:19:30,602 --> 01:19:33,901
不行，上面有門閂，我知道我夠不著
I can't, there's a bolt at the top. I know it, I can't reach it.

854
01:19:34,106 --> 01:19:38,202
- 那就找張椅子什麼的站上去 - 去啊
-Well, stand on a chair or something. -Just do it.

855
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:37,692
往前門去 往前門走啊，混帳
To the door. To the front door, damn you.

856
01:20:40,072 --> 01:20:41,266
誰啊？
Who's there?

857
01:20:43,042 --> 01:20:45,510
貝德溫太太？是你嗎？
Mrs. Bedwin? Is that you?

858
01:21:00,225 --> 01:21:01,817
過來，過來
Come here. Come here.

859
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:07,264
救我！救我！看在上帝的份上，救我！
Save me! Save me! Save me, for God's sake!

860
01:21:15,941 --> 01:21:17,533
救命
Help!

861
01:21:19,178 --> 01:21:21,976
救命！警察！
Help! Police!

862
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:33,053
抬上來
Give him here.

863
01:21:39,098 --> 01:21:40,963
該死的，他流了這麼多血
Oh, damnation, how he bleeds.

864
01:21:41,166 --> 01:21:43,896
- 他傷得重嗎？ - 應該讓他傷得更重些
-Is he hit bad? -He's gotta be hit worse.

865
01:21:49,908 --> 01:21:51,432
- 把手槍給我 - 什麼？
-Give me a pistol. -What?

866
01:21:52,478 --> 01:21:54,969
我們得滅了他，免得他通風報信
We gotta get rid of him, or he'II squeal.

867
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,080
我們得幹掉他
We gotta do him in.

868
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:00,475
這，就在河邊這
Here, here. Down here by the river.

869
01:22:00,686 --> 01:22:03,553
但是，比爾！比爾！
But, Bill! Bill!

870
01:22:06,458 --> 01:22:08,983
- 比爾？ - 救命啊！
-Bill? -Help!

871
01:22:09,194 --> 01:22:11,992
救命！救命！
Help! Help!

872
01:22:12,865 --> 01:22:15,959
- 比爾 - 救命！
-Bill. -Help!

873
01:22:24,109 --> 01:22:25,701
拍
Snap.

874
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:28,940
拍
Snap.

875
01:22:30,516 --> 01:22:32,143
拍
Snap.

876
01:22:34,953 --> 01:22:36,545
拍
Snap.

877
01:22:39,124 --> 01:22:40,682
拍
Snap.

878
01:22:54,473 --> 01:22:56,407
好嗎？
Well, well.

879
01:22:56,608 --> 01:22:58,166
你好嗎，老費？
How are you, Fagey?

880
01:23:00,078 --> 01:23:03,479
走開，你們走開！比爾呢？
Scarce. Scarce! Where's Bill?

881
01:23:03,682 --> 01:23:05,946
- 他在流血 - 發生什麼事了？
-He's-- He's bleeding. -What happened?

882
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:08,676
我會馬上告訴你
AII in good time.

883
01:23:08,887 --> 01:23:12,618
不過我沒吃飽喝足是不會談正事的
I can't talk business till I've ate and drank.

884
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:22,059
南希，我說過了，走開，走開！
Nancy, I said, scarce. Scarce!

885
01:23:22,267 --> 01:23:23,461
比爾哪去了？
Where's Bill?

886
01:23:23,669 --> 01:23:25,728
趕快弄點吃的去，勞你大駕
Well, produce the sustenance, if you please.

887
01:23:25,938 --> 01:23:27,803
機靈鬼！
Dodger!

888
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,200
南希，走開！
Nancy, scarce!

889
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:38,573
- 計劃泡湯了 - 我也猜到了
-The crack failed. -I smelt that.

890
01:23:38,784 --> 01:23:41,548
我最後問這一次，比爾哪裡去了？
For the Iast time of asking, where's Bill?

891
01:23:43,455 --> 01:23:45,116
機靈鬼
Dodger.

892
01:23:48,026 --> 01:23:51,052
扶他上床，給他喝口酒
Put him to bed, give him a nip of gin.

893
01:23:57,970 --> 01:24:01,064
這小子差點就害死我們啦，老費
The boy was about to blow on us, Fagey.

894
01:24:01,373 --> 01:24:03,534
- 他被發現了 - 發現了？
-He was seen. -Seen?

895
01:24:03,742 --> 01:24:06,370
他被發現了？誰發現他了？
He was seen? Who saw him?

896
01:24:06,712 --> 01:24:09,237
兩個老東西，他喊出聲來了
Two old ones. He shouted out.

897
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:11,643
比爾傻掉了，開了槍
Bill Iost his head, fired his pistol....

898
01:24:11,850 --> 01:24:14,318
- 打中了這孩子？ - 不知道，當時開了兩槍
-And hit the boy? -I don't know. There was two shots.

899
01:24:14,519 --> 01:24:16,885
比爾只開了一槍
Only one was Bill's.

900
01:24:17,089 --> 01:24:20,547
我們只好逃命，我抱住這孩子，比爾跌倒了
We made a run for it. I had ahold of the boy, and Bill fell.

901
01:24:20,759 --> 01:24:22,488
跌倒了？他有沒有受傷？
Fell? Was he hurt?

902
01:24:22,694 --> 01:24:26,130
沒有，後來他是游回倫敦的呢
No. Last seen, he was swimming to London.

903
01:24:29,001 --> 01:24:30,969
大牛
Bullseye.

904
01:24:34,072 --> 01:24:36,370
我跟你說過的，不要帶任何人進來
I told you not to bring a soul here.

905
01:24:36,575 --> 01:24:38,600
你現在倒把這個魔鬼帶來了
Now you've brought the devil.

906
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:41,176
你叫我帶他來的
You said to fetch him.

907
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,144
他腦子燒過了頭，什麼都記不得了
His fever is that high, he don't remember nothing.

908
01:24:44,349 --> 01:24:47,978
你很不舒服，對嗎，比爾? 今天身體怎麼樣啊？
You're not well, are you, Bill? How do you feel today?

909
01:24:48,186 --> 01:24:50,313
我身子虛得很呢
I'm as weak as water.

910
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,183
給我們來點喝的
Get us a drink.

911
01:24:53,725 --> 01:24:58,389
- 什麼破風把你吹到這裡來了？ - 不是什麼破風，親愛的
-What evil wind has blowed you here? -No evil wind, my dear.

912
01:24:59,197 --> 01:25:02,530
是你，比爾，是你說要和我講話的
You, Bill, you. You said we need to speak.

913
01:25:08,173 --> 01:25:10,073
你對那孩子做了什麼？他在哪裡？
What you done with that boy? Where is he?

914
01:25:10,275 --> 01:25:12,743
他好得很，機靈鬼在看著他
Safe and sound. The Dodger's minding him.

915
01:25:12,944 --> 01:25:16,539
他們現在形影不離呢
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

916
01:25:19,751 --> 01:25:22,242
那孩子怎麼啦，比爾？
What about the boy, Bill?

917
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,352
我們不想有誰告發我們，對嗎？
We don't want anyone peaching on us, do we?

918
01:25:27,559 --> 01:25:30,619
只要那孩子還活著，我們就是被吊死的命
And as Iong as that boy's alive, we're as good as hung.

919
01:25:30,862 --> 01:25:33,353
那應該怎麼辦？
So, what's to be done?

920
01:25:35,267 --> 01:25:37,201
- 不要動手 - 不動手？
-Nothing. -Nothing?

921
01:25:37,402 --> 01:25:40,462
- 我還沒好就不要動手 - 然後呢？
-Not till I'm better. -Then what?

922
01:25:41,306 --> 01:25:43,866
- 然後我就了結了他 - 怎麼了結啊，在哪呢？
-Then I'II do for him. -How, Bill? Where?

923
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,802
到倫敦郊外找條河把他淹死掉
Outside of London somewhere. I'II find a river and I'II drown him.

924
01:25:48,013 --> 01:25:50,379
那孩子現在身子很弱，比爾，他受傷了
The boy's weak. Bill, he was wounded.

925
01:25:50,582 --> 01:25:53,016
他連站都站不穩，就不要說走路了
He can hardly stand, Iet alone walk.

926
01:25:53,218 --> 01:25:56,244
他什麼時候走得動了就告訴我，我去帶他走
When he can walk, tell me. I'II fetch him.

927
01:25:57,656 --> 01:25:58,918
你走吧
Now, get out of here.

928
01:25:59,658 --> 01:26:01,353
好
Yes.

929
01:26:02,361 --> 01:26:03,988
好的
Yes.

930
01:26:04,229 --> 01:26:07,221
比爾，你說得沒錯
Bill, you're right.

931
01:26:11,069 --> 01:26:12,331
我是出於好意啊
It's for the best.

932
01:26:16,842 --> 01:26:19,106
我渾身燒得利害
I'm burning up.

933
01:26:19,311 --> 01:26:20,903
給我吃點藥吧，我的藥呢？
Give me me physic. Where's me physic?

934
01:26:23,281 --> 01:26:25,772
你怎麼魂不守舍的？
You Iook Iike a corpse come back to Iife again.

935
01:26:25,984 --> 01:26:29,147
- 發生了什麼事？ - 沒事
-What's the matter? -Nothing.

936
01:26:30,288 --> 01:26:32,017
你幹嗎這麼狠地瞪著我？
What do you Iook at me so hard for?

937
01:26:32,224 --> 01:26:35,387
- 你在想什麼？ - 想很多，比爾
-What you thinking of? -Of many things, Bill.

938
01:26:35,594 --> 01:26:37,653
- 問這個幹嘛？ - 我來告訴你吧
-What odds in that? -I'II tell you what it is.

939
01:26:37,863 --> 01:26:39,626
你要不是害了感冒...
If you haven't caught the fever...

940
01:26:39,831 --> 01:26:42,891
...就是有些不尋常的事情發生了
...then there's something more than usual in the wind.

941
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:45,626
或者是很危險的事
And something dangerous too.

942
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,299
把藥給我，我說
Give me me physic, I say.

943
01:26:51,977 --> 01:26:54,969
不，不，不
No, no, no.

944
01:26:55,547 --> 01:26:58,846
沒有見過這麼強的女人...
There ain't a stauncher-hearted girl going...

945
01:26:59,518 --> 01:27:02,646
...早知道就把她的脖子給割了
...or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.

946
01:27:04,222 --> 01:27:07,658
她可能是發燒了吧，就是的
She's got a fever coming on. That's it.

947
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:32,174
來，喝了會好些
Here. Make you feel better.

948
01:27:39,157 --> 01:27:41,284
坐到這來
Sit aside me.

949
01:27:43,762 --> 01:27:47,823
拿出你平時的樣子來，否則我給你變個樣 讓你自己都認不出來
Put on your own face, or I'II alter it so you won't know it again.

950
01:29:12,817 --> 01:29:15,047
- 等一下 - 好的，小姐
-Wait. -Ma'am.

951
01:29:33,004 --> 01:29:35,472
- 你好？ - 布朗羅先生是不是住在這裡？
-Yes? -Does Mr. Brownlow Iive here?

952
01:29:35,674 --> 01:29:38,802
你是誰？你想幹什麼？你回去吧
Who are you? What do you want? Go around the back.

953
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:41,808
我想說說奧立弗·忒斯特的事
I have information about OIiver Twist.

954
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:48,181
他還好嗎？他沒有危險吧？
Is he all right? Is he safe?

955
01:29:49,354 --> 01:29:53,017
- 他在哪？ - 我只跟布朗羅先生說
-Where is he? -I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

956
01:29:53,224 --> 01:29:55,715
他不在
He's not here.

957
01:29:56,461 --> 01:29:58,292
告訴他，那孩子是無辜的
The boy's innocent, tell him that.

958
01:29:59,464 --> 01:30:02,331
- 他在哪裡？ - 他很安全
-Where is he? -Safe.

959
01:30:03,735 --> 01:30:07,102
- 但是不會一直都那樣 - 他在哪裡？
-But he may not be for Iong. -Where is he?

960
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,342
替我給布朗羅先生留個口信
Give Mr. Brownlow a message.

961
01:30:20,552 --> 01:30:22,850
讓他星期天凌晨...
Tell him to meet me on Sunday at midnight...

962
01:30:23,054 --> 01:30:25,284
- ...到倫敦橋和我碰面 - 凌晨？
-...on London Bridge. -Midnight?

963
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:27,117
如果我不在的話...
And if I'm not there...

964
01:30:27,325 --> 01:30:31,762
... 告訴他第二天，第三天晚上再去 我會在的，要告訴他
...then tell him to come the next night and the next. I'II be there. Tell him.

965
01:30:37,435 --> 01:30:41,201
看啊，親愛的 你就像從來沒有受過傷一樣
There, my dear, you Iook as good as new.

966
01:30:41,706 --> 01:30:45,437
- 你感覺怎樣？ - 累，先生
-How do you feel? -Tired, sir.

967
01:30:45,644 --> 01:30:46,838
哦，當然，當然
Well, yes, yes.

968
01:30:47,045 --> 01:30:50,537
早就過12點了 待會兒你就可以美美得睡一覺了
It is Iong after midnight. Shortly, you'II sleep a good sleep.

969
01:30:50,749 --> 01:30:52,182
可是，我的意思是...
But my meaning was...

970
01:30:52,384 --> 01:30:54,716
...你身子感覺怎樣，奧立弗？
...how do you feel in yourself, OIiver?

971
01:30:54,919 --> 01:30:57,183
好些了，謝謝你，先生
Better. Thank you, sir.

972
01:30:57,389 --> 01:31:01,382
- 就是手臂還痛 - 過來坐
-But for the ache in my arm. -Come sit.

973
01:31:03,862 --> 01:31:08,492
我有好東西可以對付它，親愛的
I have the very thing for such pains as yours, my dear.

974
01:31:10,068 --> 01:31:11,330
解開繃帶
Undo the bandage.

975
01:31:22,213 --> 01:31:24,841
噢，天啊
Oh, my God.

976
01:31:25,517 --> 01:31:28,315
傷得不輕啊
It's a nasty wound.

977
01:31:29,621 --> 01:31:33,318
我的妙方會治好它的 看著吧，親愛的
But my magic will do the trick. You'II see, my dear.

978
01:31:33,525 --> 01:31:35,652
這種藥...
This remedy...

979
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,794
...是祖傳秘方，沒錯...
...is older than time. Yes...

980
01:31:37,996 --> 01:31:40,294
...親愛的，是祖傳秘方
...my dear, older than time.

981
01:31:40,498 --> 01:31:43,956
父親傳給兒子...
It was handed down from father to son...

982
01:31:44,169 --> 01:31:48,435
...父親傳給兒子，來自什麼地方？
...father to son, and comes from...

983
01:31:50,542 --> 01:31:52,840
沒有誰知道
...who can say where?

984
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:59,443
謝謝你，先生，謝謝
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

985
01:31:59,651 --> 01:32:01,778
謝謝你的好意，我永遠不會忘記的
For your kindness. I'II always remember it.

986
01:32:01,986 --> 01:32:03,283
這個...
Well....

987
01:32:04,089 --> 01:32:05,522
這個...
Well....

988
01:32:06,725 --> 01:32:08,192
永遠不會
AIways.

989
01:32:08,393 --> 01:32:10,987
沒錯，永遠不會，親愛的
Yes, always, my dear.

990
01:32:13,398 --> 01:32:16,424
誰知道那會有多久啊
But who knows how Iong that will be.

991
01:32:44,896 --> 01:32:47,490
離凌晨還有一個鐘頭
An hour this side of midnight.

992
01:32:47,732 --> 01:32:50,166
這天還很陰沉
Dark and heavy it is too.

993
01:32:50,401 --> 01:32:53,199
到此為止吧，晚安了
Good night for business, this.

994
01:32:53,404 --> 01:32:56,635
真可惜，比爾，親愛的 我們還沒成功過一次呢
What a pity, Bill, my dear, there's none quite ready to be done.

995
01:32:56,841 --> 01:32:58,502
對啊，這回你說對了
Yeah, for once, you're right.

996
01:32:58,977 --> 01:33:01,411
那孩子什麼時候才能好起來，走那一段路呢？
When will the boy be well enough to go on his travels?

997
01:33:01,613 --> 01:33:06,073
- 我說過了，一兩天就可以了 - 真可惜
-Like I say, Bill. In a day or two. -It's a pity.

998
01:33:06,284 --> 01:33:09,617
- 我也有這種感覺 - 聽你這麼說我就放心了
-For I'm in the humor to. -Does me good to hear you.

999
01:33:09,821 --> 01:33:13,257
今晚你像你自己了，比爾 這樣才像你自己嘛
You're Iike yourself tonight, Bill. Quite Iike yourself.

1000
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:16,723
你把這皺巴巴的爪子放在我肩上 我才不像自己呢...
I don't feel Iike myself when you Iay that withered claw on my shoulder...

1001
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:19,089
...給我鬆開
...so take it away.

1002
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:29,573
你好，南希
Hello, Nance.

1003
01:33:29,774 --> 01:33:31,867
這女孩這麼晚到哪裡去？
Where's the girl going to this time of night?

1004
01:33:32,277 --> 01:33:34,745
- 不遠 - 這是什麼話？
-Not far. -What answer's that?

1005
01:33:34,946 --> 01:33:37,676
- 你到哪裡去？ - 我說了，不遠
-Where you going? -I say, not far.

1006
01:33:37,882 --> 01:33:40,180
- 我問的是哪裡？ - 我不知道哪裡
-And I say, where? -I don't know where.

1007
01:33:40,385 --> 01:33:43,377
那我知道，哪兒都不要去，坐下
Then I do, nowhere. Sit down.

1008
01:33:43,588 --> 01:33:47,149
- 我不舒服，我想透透氣 - 把腦袋伸到窗外去
-I'm not well. I want a breath of air. -Put your head out the window.

1009
01:33:47,358 --> 01:33:50,486
那還不夠，我想到街上去
There's not enough there. I want it in the street.

1010
01:33:54,165 --> 01:33:56,690
那你就哪都不要去
Then you won't have it.

1011
01:34:01,973 --> 01:34:06,433
現在給我乖乖地呆在這裡，行嗎？
There. Now, stop quietly where you are, will you?

1012
01:34:11,749 --> 01:34:13,273
你知道你在幹什麼嗎？
Do you know what you're doing?

1013
01:34:14,552 --> 01:34:16,577
我在幹什麼？
Do I know what I'm--?

1014
01:34:16,788 --> 01:34:19,814
我看你這個女人是瘋掉了 敢這樣對我說話？
I think this girl's Iost her senses. You talking to me in that way?

1015
01:34:20,024 --> 01:34:22,049
你要把我逼上絕路了
You'II drive me on to something desperate.

1016
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,728
讓我走，行嗎？就現在，就這次
Now, Iet me go, will you? This minute, this instant.

1017
01:34:24,929 --> 01:34:27,261
- 休想！ - 叫他讓我走，費金
-No! -Tell him to Iet me go, Fagin.

1018
01:34:27,932 --> 01:34:31,231
這樣是為他好，你聽見了嗎？
It'II be better for him. Do you hear me?

1019
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:35,864
好，我聽見了
Aye, I hear you.

1020
01:34:37,108 --> 01:34:40,009
如果再過半分鐘我還聽見你嚷嚷...
And if I have to Iisten to you for half a minute Ionger...

1021
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:43,977
...那隻狗就會讓你出不了聲！
...the dog will tear some of that screaming voice out!

1022
01:34:44,315 --> 01:34:47,113
你是怎麼啦，你個賤貨，怎麼回事？
What's come over you, you jade? What is it?

1023
01:34:47,318 --> 01:34:49,183
比爾，讓我走吧
Bill, Iet me go.

1024
01:34:49,721 --> 01:34:53,623
讓我走吧，你不知道自己在幹什麼
Let me go. You don't know what you're doing.

1025
01:34:53,825 --> 01:34:55,053
就去一個小時
For only one hour.

1026
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:59,060
這娘們要是還沒瘋到頭 我就把我的手腳一隻一隻砍下來
Cut my Iimbs off one by one if I don't think the girl's stark raving mad.

1027
01:34:59,264 --> 01:35:02,995
- 起來，給我起來！ - 不！
-Get up. Get up! -No.

1028
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:11,202
給我呆在裡面！
Now, stay there!

1029
01:35:14,145 --> 01:35:15,806
這個小娘們真夠奇怪
What a precious, strange girl that is.

1030
01:35:16,014 --> 01:35:18,039
你說的沒錯，比爾，沒錯
You may say that, Bill, you may say that.

1031
01:35:18,249 --> 01:35:20,479
大晚上的她為什麼要出去呢？
Why did she take it in her head to go out tonight?

1032
01:35:20,985 --> 01:35:23,783
固執，我看她很固執，親愛的
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.

1033
01:35:24,122 --> 01:35:27,285
我還以為我把她馴乖了 可她還是那個樣兒
I thought I tamed her of that. But she's as bad as ever.

1034
01:35:29,894 --> 01:35:33,091
我看她是染上我的熱病了，還沒好呢
I think she's got a touch of my fever in her blood and it won't come out.

1035
01:35:33,298 --> 01:35:34,788
還真像
Like enough.

1036
01:35:34,999 --> 01:35:37,991
如果她再敢那樣做，我就給他放放血
Well, if she's taken that way again, I'II Iet her a Iittle blood.

1037
01:35:38,202 --> 01:35:41,171
就用不著看醫生了
Without troubling the doctor.

1038
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:59,486
現在她又變了個花樣
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1039
01:36:00,858 --> 01:36:02,257
晚安了
Good night.

1040
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:06,954
過兩天來找那個孩子把
In two days, Bill, come for the boy.

1041
01:36:08,866 --> 01:36:10,959
點燈送客
Light him down.

1042
01:36:11,169 --> 01:36:14,969
他要是摔倒了沒人見著，多可憐啊
It's a pity he should fall and break his neck without anyone seeing it.

1043
01:36:17,108 --> 01:36:18,473
給他點盞燈
Show him a Iight.

1044
01:36:27,852 --> 01:36:31,549
怎麼啦，親愛的南希，這樣鬧騰是為什麼？
What is it, Nancy dear, the reason for all this?

1045
01:36:31,756 --> 01:36:33,986
- 你說什麼？ - 剛才的事
-What do you mean? -That matter just now.

1046
01:36:34,192 --> 01:36:36,217
我不會告訴別人
We'II speak of this anon.

1047
01:36:36,427 --> 01:36:38,486
我們倆算是朋友吧，南希
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1048
01:36:38,696 --> 01:36:40,891
老朋友，你早就認識我了，南希
A staunch friend. You know me of old, Nance.

1049
01:36:41,432 --> 01:36:44,196
我很瞭解你，晚安
I know you well. Good night.

1050
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,039
機靈鬼...
Dodge...

1051
01:36:51,242 --> 01:36:53,107
...抽一口
...pull it in.

1052
01:36:56,314 --> 01:36:59,374
我的杯子已經滿了，你沒看到嗎？
My glass is full already, can't you see?

1053
01:37:05,523 --> 01:37:07,252
麻煩來啦
Trouble?

1054
01:37:10,828 --> 01:37:12,625
機靈鬼
Dodger.

1055
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:18,496
- 有沒有老湯姆酒啊？ - 在十鍾酒吧呢
-Let's find out where old Tom is, eh? -He's in the Ten Bells.

1056
01:37:18,703 --> 01:37:21,194
我們倆去弄點回家吧？
Shall we both take him home?

1057
01:37:21,672 --> 01:37:23,105
老實說...
Honestly...

1058
01:37:23,307 --> 01:37:25,935
...我沒見著她
...I haven't seen her.

1059
01:37:27,145 --> 01:37:28,874
什麼事？
Something up?

1060
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:33,079
我....
I....

1061
01:37:34,652 --> 01:37:40,488
我想你幫我一個忙 幫這個忙要很小心，很注意
I want you to do a piece of work for me that requires great care and caution.

1062
01:37:40,792 --> 01:37:43,283
什麼事？不要叫我去警局附近辦事
What is it? I ain't going near no police office.

1063
01:37:43,494 --> 01:37:47,021
- 那不適合我去 - 辦這件事一點危險也沒有
-That don't suit me, that don't. -There's not the smallest danger in it.

1064
01:37:47,231 --> 01:37:50,325
一點都沒有，我想你跟跟一個人
Not the smallest. I want someone dodged.

1065
01:37:50,535 --> 01:37:53,060
- 誰？一個老頭？ - 年輕人
-Who, an old one? -Young one.

1066
01:37:53,271 --> 01:37:54,533
- 是誰？ - 我們的人
-Who is she? -One of us.

1067
01:37:54,739 --> 01:37:56,206
誰呀？
Who?

1068
01:37:56,407 --> 01:37:58,341
南希？
Nancy?

1069
01:37:59,844 --> 01:38:02,608
- 她最近怎麼啦？ - 我也不清楚她在幹什麼...
-What's she been up to? -Not sure she's been up to anything...

1070
01:38:02,814 --> 01:38:06,113
...親愛的，所以我才叫你跟她啊
...my dear, that's why I want her dodged.

1071
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:10,952
她可能想跟人說我們的事，她不能說的
She may want to talk to people she shouldn't want to talk to.

1072
01:38:11,155 --> 01:38:16,115
我想知道她去了哪裡，見了誰，說了什麼
I want to know where she goes, who she sees, what she says.

1073
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,259
南希
Nancy.

1074
01:38:20,465 --> 01:38:23,093
我不知道，她是個好人，南希啊
I don't know. She's a good one, is Nancy.

1075
01:38:23,301 --> 01:38:27,795
給你一個英鎊，親愛的，實打實一個英鎊
A pound, my dear. One whole pound.

1076
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:10,047
布朗羅先生？
Mr. Brownlow?

1077
01:39:11,949 --> 01:39:13,644
是的
Yes.

1078
01:39:16,854 --> 01:39:19,948
我不敢在這裡說，這邊走，跟我來
I'm afraid to speak to you here. Come away. Follow me.

1079
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:36,439
已經夠遠了
This is far enough.

1080
01:39:36,641 --> 01:39:39,633
- 為什麼不在這上面說？ - 我說過了，我害怕
-Why can't we speak up there? -I told you, I'm afraid.

1081
01:39:39,844 --> 01:39:41,971
可能有人跟蹤我
I may be followed.

1082
01:39:46,717 --> 01:39:48,048
我到這兒來是因為...
I'm here because you told...

1083
01:39:48,252 --> 01:39:51,016
...你告訴我的管家 說你有奧立弗·忒斯特的消息
...my housekeeper you have information concerning OIiver Twist.

1084
01:39:51,222 --> 01:39:53,417
- 沒錯 - 告訴我吧
-So I have. -Tell me.

1085
01:39:55,092 --> 01:39:56,719
她在一個惡棍手中...
He's being held by the devil...

1086
01:39:56,928 --> 01:40:01,422
...很快要被送到另外一個惡人手上，他想....
...and he's handing him over to another what means to....

1087
01:40:01,632 --> 01:40:04,066
告訴我多一些，他是不是你身邊的人？
I must know more. Is it someone close to you?

1088
01:40:05,102 --> 01:40:08,435
- 一個是，一個不是 - 不管這兩個人是誰...
-One is. One ain't. -These men, whoever they are...

1089
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:11,199
- ...你都要說出來 - 我不會的
-...must be delivered up by you. -Never.

1090
01:40:11,409 --> 01:40:16,506
他幹盡壞事，我也沒什麼兩樣 我不會出賣他的
Bad a Iife as he has Ied, I've Ied a bad Iife too, and I will not turn upon him.

1091
01:40:17,114 --> 01:40:18,945
另外一個
The other.

1092
01:40:19,684 --> 01:40:22,847
- 費金，孩子在他手上 - 費金
-Fagin. He has the boy. -Fagin.

1093
01:40:23,054 --> 01:40:24,453
你要能找到費金，就找到那小孩了
Find Fagin, you'II find the boy.

1094
01:40:24,655 --> 01:40:27,055
- 他在哪裡？ - 斯皮達菲
-Where is he? -Spitalfields.

1095
01:40:27,258 --> 01:40:30,318
我不能再說了，已經說太多了
That's all I'II say. I've said too much.

1096
01:40:30,728 --> 01:40:32,628
不要讓別人知道是我告訴你的
No one must never know who told you.

1097
01:40:32,830 --> 01:40:35,298
- 答應我 - 我答應你
-Promise. -I promise.

1098
01:40:35,499 --> 01:40:39,629
- 明天我就去警察局 - 不，今晚就要去
-Tomorrow I'II go to the police. -No, you must do it tonight.

1099
01:40:39,837 --> 01:40:41,828
說費金的名字，那些條子就會知道了
Just say Fagin, and the traps will know.

1100
01:40:42,039 --> 01:40:45,065
- 條子？ - 警察
-The traps? -The police.

1101
01:40:45,276 --> 01:40:48,541
- 你要什麼作為酬勞？ - 什麼都不要
-What can I do to serve you? -Nothing.

1102
01:40:48,746 --> 01:40:52,045
你幫不了我，我已經完全失望了
You can do nothing. I am past all hope indeed.

1103
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:54,309
把這個收下吧
Take this as a reward.

1104
01:40:54,518 --> 01:40:57,885
不，我來這裡不是為了錢
No, I've not done this for money.

1105
01:40:58,089 --> 01:40:59,488
上帝保佑你
God bless you.

1106
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,750
晚安，晚安
Good night. Good night.

1107
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,895
千萬不要說是誰告訴你的
Never-- Never say who told you.

1108
01:41:17,808 --> 01:41:19,002
你看他
Look at him.

1109
01:41:20,811 --> 01:41:22,676
多可惜啊，看他那小臉蛋...
What a shame it is. With his face...

1110
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,075
...他可以在教堂掏老太太的口袋
...he could pick old Iadies' pockets in church.

1111
01:41:25,283 --> 01:41:28,684
這小臉蛋能幫我們發財呢
His face could be a fortune to us.

1112
01:41:29,353 --> 01:41:31,378
你改變主意了？
You changing your mind?

1113
01:41:31,589 --> 01:41:33,181
沒有
No.

1114
01:41:33,791 --> 01:41:35,918
不，比爾，必須要那樣做
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1115
01:41:36,127 --> 01:41:38,027
費金！費金
Fagin! Fagin.

1116
01:41:43,434 --> 01:41:46,699
- 你怎麼啦，機靈鬼？ - 我得和費金單獨說
-What's got into you, Dodger? -I have to see Fagin alone.

1117
01:41:46,904 --> 01:41:48,599
不不，在比爾面前說沒關係
No, no, you can speak in front of Bill.

1118
01:41:48,806 --> 01:41:52,242
- 不，不行 - 可以的，說啊，機靈鬼，說吧
-No, I can't. -Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

1119
01:41:52,443 --> 01:41:54,570
- 是南希 - 南希怎麼啦？
-Nancy. -What about Nancy?

1120
01:41:54,779 --> 01:41:57,612
他幫了我一個小忙，比爾 我讓他跟蹤了南希
He done a bit of work for me, Bill. I had him dodge Nancy.

1121
01:41:57,815 --> 01:41:59,407
你說什麼？
What do you mean?

1122
01:41:59,617 --> 01:42:01,676
告訴我們，機靈鬼，你跟蹤了她？
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1123
01:42:01,886 --> 01:42:04,047
是的，到了倫敦橋
Yes. To London Bridge.

1124
01:42:04,255 --> 01:42:06,621
然後呢？在倫敦橋上幹什麼了？
And what? What on London Bridge?

1125
01:42:06,957 --> 01:42:08,982
她和一個老東西見了面，是個老先生
She met an old one. A gentleman.

1126
01:42:09,193 --> 01:42:10,922
- 然後.... - 然後呢？
-And.... -And?

1127
01:42:11,128 --> 01:42:13,221
你倒是說啊！
Speak, will you?!

1128
01:42:14,065 --> 01:42:17,000
她出出賣了我們，她說了費金和奧立弗的名字
She peached. She told him Fagin had OIiver.

1129
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:21,228
老頭要去找條子，就是今天晚上
And the old man was to go to the traps. Now, tonight.

1130
01:42:27,278 --> 01:42:29,303
- 讓我走，讓我出去！ - 比爾！比爾！一句話！
-Let me go. Let me out! -Bill! Bill! A word--

1131
01:42:29,513 --> 01:42:33,711
- 別跟我說話，現在不安全！ - 聽我說一句話！
-Don't speak to me, it's not safe! -Hear me speak a word!

1132
01:42:34,051 --> 01:42:36,178
比爾，你不會....
Bill, you won't be....

1133
01:42:37,154 --> 01:42:39,349
你不會太過分吧，比爾?
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1134
01:42:52,203 --> 01:42:53,568
快走，孩子們，快走！
FIit, boys, flit!

1135
01:42:53,771 --> 01:42:56,569
你們還沒說出斯皮達菲 那些條子就要來到門口啦
The traps will be at the door afore you can say "Spitalfields."

1136
01:42:56,774 --> 01:42:57,934
快逃！快逃！快逃！
FIit! FIit! FIit!

1137
01:42:58,142 --> 01:42:59,700
逃！
FIit!

1138
01:43:00,144 --> 01:43:01,873
逃！
FIit!

1139
01:43:02,113 --> 01:43:03,774
逃！
FIit!

1140
01:43:03,981 --> 01:43:05,744
逃！
FIit!

1141
01:43:06,884 --> 01:43:08,579
逃！
FIit!

1142
01:43:11,021 --> 01:43:12,682
逃！
FIit!

1143
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:41,474
走
Come on.

1144
01:44:07,144 --> 01:44:09,339
是你啊
Oh, it's you.

1145
01:44:12,817 --> 01:44:14,409
比爾？
Bill?

1146
01:44:14,618 --> 01:44:16,518
什麼事？
What's the matter?

1147
01:44:24,728 --> 01:44:27,356
比爾，為什麼這樣看著我？
Bill, why do you Iook Iike that at me?

1148
01:44:29,066 --> 01:44:31,125
這點亮光夠我辦事了
There's enough Iight for what I've gotta do.

1149
01:44:31,335 --> 01:44:33,826
我，我做了什麼啊？
What--? What have I done?

1150
01:44:34,505 --> 01:44:37,440
- 告訴我 - 你心裡明白
-Speak to me. -You know.

1151
01:44:37,641 --> 01:44:40,041
你今晚被人看到了
You was watched tonight.

1152
01:44:40,444 --> 01:44:43,140
你說的每個字都被聽到了
Every word you said was heard.

1153
01:44:45,316 --> 01:44:47,841
我，我沒說你的名字，比爾
I-- I never said your name, Bill.

1154
01:44:48,052 --> 01:44:49,314
從來沒有
Never.

1155
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,714
從來沒有
Never.

1156
01:44:50,921 --> 01:44:52,946
比爾，比爾，比爾！
Bill. Bill. Bill!

1157
01:44:55,159 --> 01:44:56,990
噢，上帝，噢，上帝啊，饒了我吧！
Oh, God. Oh, God, have mercy!

1158
01:45:21,752 --> 01:45:23,652
南希？
Nance?

1159
01:45:28,325 --> 01:45:30,122
南希？
Nance?

1160
01:45:51,715 --> 01:45:53,740
我什麼都沒有做
I haven't done nothing.

1161
01:45:53,951 --> 01:45:56,181
走開，走開啊你
Go on, be off with you.

1162
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:21,077
你好，老費
Hello, Fagey.

1163
01:46:21,278 --> 01:46:23,508
你好啊，孩子們
Hello, Iads.

1164
01:46:25,015 --> 01:46:27,415
有什麼消息嗎，托比？有沒有消息？
What's the news, Toby? What's the news?

1165
01:46:27,618 --> 01:46:30,678

I have it here, Fagin. It's all in The Chronicle.

1207
01:49:29,366 --> 01:49:31,129
大牛，大牛

1208
01:49:31,568 --> 01:49:33,798
回來，回來
Get back here. Get back here.

1209

- 來這 - 別靠近它
-Here. -Don't go near him.

1214

1220

我是這樣想的
My thinking is this:

1221
01:50:18,649 --> 01:50:21,379
如果我們逮到了塞克斯，費金就逃不掉了
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1222
01:50:21,585 --> 01:50:23,280
- 如果我們逮住了費金 - 我說
-And if we get Fagin-- -Look.

1223
01:50:24,121 --> 01:50:27,113
長官，找到那條狗了
Sir, we found the dog.

1224
01:50:29,259 --> 01:50:31,887
我們就在這裡等著條子來抓嗎？
Are we going to sit here waiting for the traps to find us?

1225
01:50:32,095 --> 01:50:35,189
- 閉嘴 - 不，他說的沒錯
-Shut it. -No, he's right.

1226
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:37,799
我們得再逃遠點
We should do another flit.

1227
01:50:40,437 --> 01:50:42,405
是條子！

What?

1229
01:50:59,656 --> 01:51:00,850
是他
It's him.

1230
01:51:01,792 --> 01:51:03,726
- 別讓他進來 - 肯定要
-Don't Iet him in. -We must.

1231
01:51:05,762 --> 01:51:07,491
去啊

1232
01:51:09,633 --> 01:51:11,498
去啊！
Go on!

1233
01:51:17,774 --> 01:51:20,265
給我們留點火啊
Don't Ieave us in the dark.

1234
01:52:16,433 --> 01:52:18,560
你們都是混蛋
Damn you all.

1235
01:52:19,202 --> 01:52:21,796
沒話跟我說嗎？
Have you nothing to say to me?

1236
01:52:22,172 --> 01:52:26,973
- 你到這裡來太不安全了，比爾 - 對你不安全，對我安全
-Not safe for you to stop here, Bill. -If it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1237
01:52:31,181 --> 01:52:32,648
那個…
Is it...?

1238
01:52:33,817 --> 01:52:35,341
屍體埋了嗎？
The body, is it buried?

1239
01:52:43,694 --> 01:52:46,356
機靈鬼，快讓他進來
Dodger, Iet him in quick.

1240
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:49,632
機靈鬼

1241
01:52:50,867 --> 01:52:52,494
照我說的做
Do as I say.

1242
01:52:56,473 --> 01:52:58,703
別靠近我，你這個怪物
Don't come near me, you monster.

1243
01:53:02,546 --> 01:53:04,673
你們都在這作證，我不怕他
You're my witnesses. I'm not afraid of him.

1244
01:53:06,116 --> 01:53:08,550
如果他們來要人，我不會保他
And if they come here after him, I'II give him up.

1245
01:53:08,752 --> 01:53:10,379
我會告訴他們你在這裡
I'II tell them you're here.

1246
01:53:11,655 --> 01:53:15,022
他要殺我隨他便，但是 只要我在這，我就會告發他
He may kill me if he Iikes, but if I'm here, I'II give him up.

1247
01:53:15,225 --> 01:53:17,819
就算他被活活燙死，我也要告發
If he was to be boiled alive, so I would.

1248
01:53:18,028 --> 01:53:20,258
你這個小…
Why, you Iittle--

1249
01:53:21,264 --> 01:53:22,754
放開我！
Get off me!

1250
01:53:22,966 --> 01:53:24,729
看我把你撕開幾塊！
Or I'II tear you Iimb from Iimb!

1251
01:53:30,874 --> 01:53:32,136
救命，他在這裡！
Help, he's here!

1252
01:53:32,342 --> 01:53:34,572
- 他在這裡，把門撞開！ - 在上面的窗邊
-He's here. Break down the door! -Up at the window!

1253

Do your worst. I'II cheat you yet!

1256
01:53:54,998 --> 01:53:58,195
不，比爾，不要，我們留著他還有用
No! Bill, no. He's our bargaining tool.

1257
01:53:58,402 --> 01:54:01,428
不是你的，費金，是我的
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1258
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:05,398
比爾！

我會讓他掉下去
I'II Iet him drop.

1263
01:54:26,396 --> 01:54:28,864
不要亂來，否則我鬆手了！
Don't try nothing, or I'II Iet him go!

1264

01:54:40,343 --> 01:54:44,006
上去！上去
Up there. Up there.

1267
01:54:47,951 --> 01:54:51,580
抓住那裡，抓住
Grab hold of there. Grab hold of it.

1268
01:55:00,797 --> 01:55:02,992
長官，我們追吧

下來
Get down.

1299
02:00:02,699 --> 02:00:05,133
這裡不適合小孩子看，先生
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1300
02:00:05,335 --> 02:00:08,634
當然不適合，朋友，但是這個小孩...
It is not indeed, my friend. But this child has seen this man...

1301
02:00:08,838 --> 02:00:11,102
...見過那個人的起起落落
...in the full career of his success and villainy.

1302
02:00:11,307 --> 02:00:14,333
這也是他的願望，就算會留下痛苦和恐懼...
And it is his wish, even at the cost of some pain and fear...

1303
02:00:14,544 --> 02:00:16,910
...他也要看看他
...that he should see him now.

1304
02:00:49,479 --> 02:00:51,276
十八
Eighteen.

1305
02:01:06,429 --> 02:01:08,192
喂！
Hey!

1306
02:01:12,435 --> 02:01:13,697
好孩子
Good boy.

1307
02:01:13,903 --> 02:01:15,734
好孩子，查理
Good boy, Charley.

1308

做得好
Well done.

1309
02:01:25,482 --> 02:01:28,679
好樣兒的，查理，做得好，做得好
Good boy, Charley, well done. Well done.

1310
02:01:29,018 --> 02:01:31,452
- 帶著孩子去睡吧 - 不要害怕
-Take the boy away to bed. -Don't be frightened.

1311
02:01:31,654 --> 02:01:33,349
費金
Fagin.

1312
02:01:33,623 --> 02:01:35,420
我是，我就是這個老頭，大人
That's me. An old man, my Iord.

1313
02:01:35,625 --> 02:01:38,219
糟…糟老頭
A-- A very old-- OId man.

1314
02:01:38,828 --> 02:01:40,295
有人想看看你
Someone here wants to see you.

1315
02:01:40,730 --> 02:01:42,391
- 打啊！打死他們！ - 別害怕
-Strike! Strike them all dead! -Easy.

1316
02:01:42,599 --> 02:01:44,533
為什麼他們可以宰掉我？
What right have they to butcher me?

1317
02:01:44,734 --> 02:01:46,793
跟他說吧，請你快些
Speak to him now. Quick, if you please.

1318
02:01:47,003 --> 02:01:48,971
因為他越來越不行了
For he grows worse as the time goes on.

1319
02:01:51,174 --> 02:01:53,802
費金，你對我很好
Fagin, you were kind to me.

1320
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:55,375
是的，是的
Yes, yes.

1321
02:01:55,578 --> 02:01:57,239
我以後還會好
I'II be kind again.

1322
02:01:57,447 --> 02:01:59,472
我以後還會好
I'II be kind again.

1323
02:01:59,682 --> 02:02:02,082
我以後還會好
I'II be kind again.

1324
02:02:07,323 --> 02:02:10,156
- 我不怕 - 奧立弗！
-I'm not afraid. -OIiver!

1325
02:02:14,731 --> 02:02:18,167
我…想和你說句悄悄話
Let-- Let me whisper to you.

1326
02:02:20,403 --> 02:02:23,099
你記得那個箱子嗎，奧立弗？
You remember the box, OIiver?

1327
02:02:23,306 --> 02:02:26,400
裝滿了老頭子的好東西，奧立弗？
With my pretty things for my old age, OIiver?

1328
02:02:26,609 --> 02:02:29,772
我把它藏在前廳的煙囪上了
It's hid a Iittle way up the chimney in the top front room.

1329
02:02:29,979 --> 02:02:32,174
留給你，奧立弗

- 你的，但是我們要說說話 - 是的，是的
-Yours, but we must talk. -Yes, yes.

1331
02:02:35,652 --> 02:02:38,177
我們先禱告一下好嗎？
But shall we say a prayer together first?

1332
02:02:38,388 --> 02:02:39,582
請你
Do.

1333
02:02:39,789 --> 02:02:43,350
就做一次，和我一起跪下來 ...
Say only one, upon your knees, with me...

1334
02:02:43,560 --> 02:02:46,222
...做完我們談一個早上都行
...and we can talk all morning.

1335
02:02:46,829 --> 02:02:48,421
出去，出去
Outside. Outside.

1336
02:02:48,631 --> 02:02:51,395
你可以說我睡著了，他們會相信你的
You can say I've gone to sleep. They'II believe you.

你把我弄出去，那些好東西都是你的 親愛的，全是你的
You can get me out. The pretty things are yours, my dear, yours.

1338
02:02:55,905 --> 02:03:00,035
- 噢，上帝啊，饒恕這個可憐的人吧 - 沒錯，沒錯
-Oh, God, forgive this wretched man. -That's right, that's right.

1339
02:03:00,243 --> 02:03:01,437
這樣對我們有好處
That will help us on.

1340
02:03:01,644 --> 02:03:05,740
如果…如果…如果…我
If-- If-- If-- If I...

1341
02:03:05,949 --> 02:03:10,409
...上絞刑架的時候搖搖晃晃
...shake and tremble as we pass the gallows, don't-- Don't--

1342
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:14,586
你，你別介意，快點走，快，快，快

1347
