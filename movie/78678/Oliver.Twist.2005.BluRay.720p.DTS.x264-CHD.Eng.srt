1
00:03:09,287 --> 00:03:11,448
Bow to the board.

2
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,459
This is the boy.

3
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:18,760
Born here in the workhouse.
Moved to the parish farm.

4
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:22,660
Nine years old today.
Time to be moved back here.

5
00:03:22,866 --> 00:03:24,164
What's your name, boy?

6
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,367
-Oliver Twist.
-What?

7
00:03:31,574 --> 00:03:35,136
-That boy's a fool.
-Boy. Listen to me.

8
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,736
You know you are an orphan,
I suppose.

9
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,314
-What's that?
-The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

10
00:03:40,517 --> 00:03:42,711
You know you've got
no father or mother...

11
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,582
...and that you were brought up
by the parish, don't you?

12
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:48,348
-Yes, sir.
-What are you crying for?

13
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:51,321
I hope you say your prayers
every night.

14
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:55,292
Pray for those that feed you
and take care of you...

15
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:56,691
...Iike a Christian.

16
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:58,799
-Yes, sir.
-Well...

17
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,901
...you have come here
to be educated...

18
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:03,435
...and to be taught a useful trade.

19
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:18,683
Here, where do you want these?

20
00:04:35,135 --> 00:04:37,295
Learn from the boy next to you.

21
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:41,633
-What am I to learn, sir?
-Learn to pick out the oakum.

22
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:43,171
What's oakum, sir?

23
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,940
Stop asking so many questions.

24
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:49,477
Oakum's the fibers you unpick
from the old rope.

25
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:53,845
Then it's used again
for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.

26
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:56,247
You're serving your country.

27
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:58,046
Now, get on with it.

28
00:05:31,487 --> 00:05:35,424
Tom, give it a rest, will you?
We're trying to sleep.

29
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:41,626
-Can't sleep, too hungry.
-We're all hungry.

30
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,298
Yes, but I'm frightened.

31
00:05:44,499 --> 00:05:46,058
Frightened? Why?

32
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:48,731
Why? Why?

33
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:53,430
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might
eat the lad that sleeps next to me.

34
00:06:28,507 --> 00:06:30,532
O Lord God...

35
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:33,734
...for the blessing of this generous
and bountiful meal...

36
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:36,038
...that thou hast placed before us...

37
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:38,976
...we give thanks. Amen.

38
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:41,549
Amen.

39
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,527
Please, sir. I want some more.

40
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,457
What?

41
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:11,158
Please, sir, I want some more.

42
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,573
Fetch the beadle!

43
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:34,880
Mr. Limbkins.

44
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:37,718
I beg your pardon, sir.

45
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:40,328
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

46
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:43,195
For more?!

47
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,129
Compose yourself, Mr. Bumble,
and answer me distinctly.

48
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:50,931
Do I understand that he asked for
more after he had eaten his supper?

49
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,401
He did, sir.

50
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:58,371
That boy will be hanged.

51
00:09:10,025 --> 00:09:13,425
"Five pounds and a b--"

52
00:09:16,365 --> 00:09:20,858
When I says "whoa,"
I means "whoa"!

53
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,966
"Health-- Healthy...

54
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:28,574
...appren-- apprentice.

55
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:31,040
Five pounds."

56
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,580
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

57
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:39,150
Young boys have been smothered
in chimneys before now.

58
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:42,583
That's because they damp the straw
afore they light it in the chimney...

59
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:46,588
...to make them come out again.
Damp straw makes smoke.

60
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,920
Smoke sends a boy to sleep,
and that's what he wants.

61
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,120
Boys is very lazy, gentlemen.

62
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:55,788
But there's nothing like a good hot
blaze to make them come out in a run.

63
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,997
It's humane too. Yes.

64
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:02,263
Because even if they've
stuck in the chimney...

65
00:10:02,474 --> 00:10:07,536
...roasting their feet makes them
struggle to extricate theirselves.

66
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,076
Yes.

67
00:10:09,281 --> 00:10:11,181
I suppose he's fond of
chimney sweeping?

68
00:10:11,382 --> 00:10:13,612
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

69
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:16,547
Very well. I will sign the indentures...

70
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:20,718
...to make him Mr....

71
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:24,984
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

72
00:10:34,336 --> 00:10:35,496
My boy.

73
00:10:37,173 --> 00:10:41,440
My boy, you look pale and alarmed.

74
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:42,805
What's the matter?

75
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:46,280
Please, sir. Please, sir.

76
00:10:46,482 --> 00:10:48,540
What is it, my boy?

77
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:50,513
-Don't....
-Now then.

78
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:52,846
Don't.... Don't....

79
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:55,922
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

80
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:59,285
Please don't send me away
with this dreadful man, sir.

81
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:02,496
Of all the designing orphans
that I've ever seen....

82
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:05,394
-Hold your tongue, beadle.
-Did Your Worship speak to me?

83
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,160
Yes, hold your tongue.

84
00:11:09,704 --> 00:11:12,366
No. No, out of the question.

85
00:11:12,573 --> 00:11:16,508
We refuse to sanction
these indentures.

86
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:20,175
Take the boy away.

87
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,878
And treat him kindly.

88
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,712
He seems to want it.

89
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:45,864
I've just taken the measure of
the two women that died last night.

90
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,903
You'll make your fortune,
Mr. Sowerberry.

91
00:11:49,307 --> 00:11:51,401
Think so?

92
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:55,742
The prices allowed by the board
are very small.

93
00:11:55,947 --> 00:11:58,211
So are the coffins.

94
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:04,517
By the by, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

95
00:12:06,622 --> 00:12:10,285
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.
Liberal terms.

96
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,727
Now, as you are to meet
your new master...

97
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:24,929
...pull that cap off your eyes.

98
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:29,332
Hold your head up, sir.

99
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,307
Dry your eyes, sir.

100
00:12:39,455 --> 00:12:43,390
-ls that you, Bumble?
-No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

101
00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:46,754
I've brought the orphan,
Oliver Twist.

102
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:49,589
So this is the orphan, is it?

103
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,231
Mrs. Sowerberry...

104
00:12:51,432 --> 00:12:54,595
...will you have the goodness
to come here a moment, my dear?

105
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:57,362
Oliver Twist.

106
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,869
How comes an orphan
to have any name at all?

107
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:02,507
-I invented it.
-You, Mr. Bumble?

108
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,301
I, Mr. Sowerberry.

109
00:13:04,511 --> 00:13:07,946
I name all our foundlings
in alphabetical order.

110
00:13:08,147 --> 00:13:09,842
The last was S.

111
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:11,846
Swubble, I named him.

112
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,817
This was a T. Twist,
I named him.

113
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:18,615
Next one as comes
will be Unwin...

114
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:20,519
...and the next, Vilkins.

115
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:24,492
I've got names ready
all through the alphabet, right up to Z.

116
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:28,096
Why, you're quite
a literary character, sir.

117
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,494
Well, well...

118
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:32,692
-...perhaps I may be.
-Mrs. Sowerberry...

119
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:35,497
...this is the orphan
from the workhouse.

120
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,207
Dear me, he's very small.

121
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,400
But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.
He'll grow.

122
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:46,106
Yes, I daresay he will.
On our food and drink.

123
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:51,048
Workhouse boys always cost more
to keep than they're worth.

124
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:54,554
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

125
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,858
Here, Charlotte...

126
00:13:57,061 --> 00:14:00,723
...give this boy some of the cold bits
that were put by for the dog.

127
00:14:29,123 --> 00:14:31,852
You don't mind sleeping
among the coffins, I suppose.

128
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:34,459
Well, it doesn't much matter
whether you do or don't...

129
00:14:34,662 --> 00:14:37,152
...for you can't sleep anywhere else.

130
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:58,062
Open the door, will you?

131
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:11,047
-You the new boy?
-Yes, sir.

132
00:16:11,252 --> 00:16:14,379
-How old are you?
-Ten, sir.

133
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,718
Then I'll whop you one when I get in,
you workhouse brat.

134
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:37,835
I beg your pardon, sir.
Did you knock?

135
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:39,237
I kicked.

136
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:41,878
Did you want a coffin, sir?

137
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,809
-You don't know who I am, I suppose.
-No, sir.

138
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:48,452
Well, I'm Mr. Noah Claypole.
And you're under me.

139
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:51,178
Now, take down the shutters.

140
00:16:55,994 --> 00:17:00,225
Saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

141
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:07,971
In the corner with you.
And be quick about it.

142
00:17:08,171 --> 00:17:11,334
They'll want you to mind the shop.
Do you hear?

143
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:13,338
Do you hear, Workhouse?
In the corner.

144
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:15,976
Oh, Lord, Noah, let the boy alone.

145
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:17,943
Let him alone?

146
00:17:18,148 --> 00:17:20,083
Why, everybody's let him alone.

147
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:24,810
His mother, father and all
his relations has let him alone.

148
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,615
So he needs someone who don't.

149
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,004
Supper.

150
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,177
Oliver, ain't you done yet?

151
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:58,545
I've never known such an idle boy.
Get down them stairs.

152
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,117
Mr. Sowerberry...

153
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,015
...supper.

154
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:05,389
-I've had a thought, my dear.
-Had a thought?

155
00:18:05,592 --> 00:18:08,425
You want to be careful,
Mr. Sowerberry, you'll get brain fever.

156
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:12,155
-It's about young Twist.
-What about him?

157
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:15,891
-A very good-looking boy.
-He will be. He eats enough.

158
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:20,661
There's an expression of melancholy
in his face, my dear.

159
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:24,433
He would make a delightful mute,
my love.

160
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:30,806
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to
attend grown-up funerals, my dear...

161
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:34,815
...but only for children's practice.

162
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,327
Look at him.

163
00:18:51,703 --> 00:18:52,897
Look at him.

164
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:57,999
A workhouse boy and a sneak.
Look at him.

165
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,334
Mark my words, I'll see him hung.

166
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:03,175
Can't be too soon.

167
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:09,005
Workhouse, how's your mother?

168
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:12,043
She's dead.

169
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,146
What'd she die of, Workhouse?

170
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:20,159
You gonna cry, Workhouse?

171
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:23,798
-What set you off?
-Not you.

172
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:29,865
-Not me, eh?
-No, not you.

173
00:19:30,271 --> 00:19:32,535
And you better not say anything
about my mother.

174
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,710
Better not?

175
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,011
About your mother?

176
00:19:39,214 --> 00:19:42,182
Well, I'm very sorry,
and I pity you very much.

177
00:19:42,383 --> 00:19:44,044
But you must know, Workhouse...

178
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,411
...your mother was
a regular right-down bad one.

179
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,547
-What did you say?
-A regular right-down bad one.

180
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,555
It's a good thing she died
when she did...

181
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,126
...or she'd be hard laboring
or transported.

182
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,663
Or hung. Which is most likely,
isn't it, Workhouse?

183
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,499
Help, Mrs. Charlotte!

184
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,467
He'll murder me. Help!

185
00:20:09,073 --> 00:20:11,098
Help. Get off!

186
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,409
For God's sake, help me!

187
00:20:15,546 --> 00:20:17,707
My missus, he's murdering me!

188
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:20,382
-Get off. Get off me now!
-Get him, Charlotte.

189
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:23,179
Get him now. Go out with him.
Come on.

190
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:27,550
-Workhouse devil.
-I'll learn you!

191
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:30,553
-You brat!
-Get the door, Charlotte.

192
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,786
In with him. In.

193
00:20:41,304 --> 00:20:43,931
Very violent indeed, sir.

194
00:20:44,941 --> 00:20:46,203
And the missus said...

195
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:49,038
...if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

196
00:20:49,246 --> 00:20:51,941
...then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...

197
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:53,978
...because the master's out.

198
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:01,485
-ln there.
-Oliver?

199
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,554
Let me out of here!

200
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:06,488
-Do you know this here voice, Oliver?
-Yes.

201
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:08,286
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

202
00:21:08,497 --> 00:21:11,055
Ain't you trembling
while I speak, sir?

203
00:21:11,265 --> 00:21:13,063
No!

204
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:19,868
-He must be mad.
-It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.

205
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:21,938
-Meat?
-Meat, ma'am, meat.

206
00:21:22,141 --> 00:21:23,336
You've overfed him.

207
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:26,376
If you'd kept this boy on gruel,
this would never have happened.

208
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,845
Dear, dear.
This comes of being liberal.

209
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:32,479
What's all this?

210
00:21:32,685 --> 00:21:35,313
Oliver Twist has turned violent,
Mr. Sowerberry.

211
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:38,251
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

212
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:44,622
Now then. Now then.

213
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:48,663
-You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?
-He called my mother names.

214
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:52,894
Well, and what if he did,
you little ungrateful wretch!

215
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,003
She deserved what he said
and worse.

216
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:56,399
-She didn't!
-She did!

217
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,302
It's a lie!

218
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:06,716
Do something, Mr. Sowerberry.
He called me a liar.

219
00:22:08,153 --> 00:22:09,346
Do something!

220
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,812
I beg your pardon, miss...

221
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:40,144
...but would you be so kind--?

222
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:43,052
Get off my land.

223
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:45,881
I don't want no beggars here.
Go on!

224
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:49,855
Get off! Or I'll put the dog on you!

225
00:26:29,362 --> 00:26:34,231
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

226
00:26:34,668 --> 00:26:37,397
Be careful, it's hot.

227
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:51,409
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

228
00:26:52,117 --> 00:26:56,051
My eyes ain't what they were.
But...

229
00:26:56,255 --> 00:26:59,882
...I just thought for a moment....

230
00:27:07,132 --> 00:27:11,693
Why are you on the road at all,
a little mite like you?

231
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:15,602
-Where are you headed?
-London, ma'am.

232
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,974
London?

233
00:27:18,743 --> 00:27:21,006
London.

234
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:25,205
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

235
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:50,988
Hello, my man.

236
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,995
And what's your game?

237
00:28:56,634 --> 00:28:59,124
You're not from these parts?

238
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,663
Where you from, then?

239
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,276
I've been walking. Seven days.

240
00:29:07,477 --> 00:29:10,538
Seven days? Cor.

241
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:11,941
I expect you want grub?

242
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:14,712
And you shall have it.

243
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:17,443
I'm at a low-water mark meself
just at the moment...

244
00:29:17,854 --> 00:29:20,151
...but I'll fork out and stump.

245
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:23,119
Come on, up with you, on your pins.

246
00:29:30,065 --> 00:29:32,624
And these won't get out again?

247
00:29:32,834 --> 00:29:34,825
Thank you very much.

248
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:36,833
Oh, by the by...

249
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,872
...my name is Jack Dawkins,
better known as the Artful Dodger.

250
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:43,372
Oliver Twist.

251
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:47,503
Why are you known as
the Artful Dodger?

252
00:29:48,148 --> 00:29:50,049
That's why.

253
00:29:57,592 --> 00:29:59,490
Got any lodgings?

254
00:29:59,692 --> 00:30:01,455
Money?

255
00:30:02,027 --> 00:30:05,485
I suppose you want someplace
to sleep tonight, don't you?

256
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,529
Baby newt.

257
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:46,965
Buy a baby newt, 4 pennies.

258
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:52,040
I expect you walking for so long
was a beak's order.

259
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:55,768
-What does that mean?
-Don't you know what a beak is?

260
00:30:55,978 --> 00:30:58,970
-A bird's mouth, isn't it?
-Cor, you are green.

261
00:30:59,182 --> 00:31:02,413
A beak's a magistrate, my son.
Where you been all your life?

262
00:31:02,619 --> 00:31:04,245
Get off me, you!

263
00:31:04,455 --> 00:31:06,422
That's it, you asked for it.

264
00:31:10,225 --> 00:31:13,592
Come back here.
I wanna talk to you.

265
00:31:14,329 --> 00:31:16,193
Lucky heather.

266
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:35,506
--from where I am, mate,
I'm telling you.

267
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,250
Go home!

268
00:31:45,591 --> 00:31:47,753
Get off of that!

269
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,361
Go back home!

270
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:58,226
-Now then.
-Plummy and slam.

271
00:32:00,372 --> 00:32:03,637
-There's two of you. Who's he?
-A new pal.

272
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,741
-Where'd he come from?
-Greenland.

273
00:32:05,944 --> 00:32:09,538
-ls the old one there?
-Upstairs, sorting the wipes.

274
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:30,222
This is him, Fagin.
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

275
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:34,335
Well, well, Oliver Twist.

276
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:39,837
I hope I have the honor
of a more intimate acquaintance.

277
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,538
We're very glad to see you, Oliver.
Very.

278
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:46,145
Dodger, take off the sausages...

279
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:51,182
...and let's make a space
at the table for Oliver.

280
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,856
You were staring at the
pocket handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?

281
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,026
There's a good many of them,
ain't there?

282
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,353
We've just looked them out,
ready for the wash.

283
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,459
That's all, my dear.

284
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:04,626
Blow it.

285
00:33:06,366 --> 00:33:09,392
Hot. Blow it.

286
00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:12,299
Now then, Oliver,
what you must have...

287
00:33:12,773 --> 00:33:16,037
...is a hot gin and water.
Warms the cockles.

288
00:33:16,243 --> 00:33:20,042
Only, drink it quick because another
of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

289
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:44,164
He's such a nice lad.

290
00:33:44,371 --> 00:33:47,806
I have a feeling he'll turn out
a hard worker.

291
00:33:48,006 --> 00:33:50,372
Yeah, a hard worker.

292
00:34:15,733 --> 00:34:17,667
Oliver?

293
00:34:20,904 --> 00:34:22,962
Oliver?

294
00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:38,768
Clever dogs.

295
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:46,381
Clever dogs.

296
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:53,146
Fine fellows.

297
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:59,151
All fine fellows.

298
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:04,925
Fine fellows.

299
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:07,625
Fine fellows.

300
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:12,305
Fine fellows.

301
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:15,575
Fine fellows.

302
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:23,474
What do you watch me for?
Why are you awake?

303
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:25,312
What have you seen?
Speak out, boy!

304
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,646
Quick. Quick, or it's your life!

305
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,915
I wasn't able to sleep
any longer, sir.

306
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:31,614
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

307
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:33,690
-You were not awake a moment ago?
-No, sir.

308
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:36,055
-You sure?
-Yes, sir.

309
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:42,295
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I know that.

310
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:44,296
I only tried to frighten you.

311
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,396
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

312
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,835
Did you see any
of those pretty things, my dear?

313
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,739
Yes, sir.

314
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,805
They....

315
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:59,283
They're mine, Oliver.
My little property.

316
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:01,715
For my old age.

317
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:04,148
It's our secret.

318
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:07,353
-You understand, my dear?
-Yes, sir.

319
00:37:08,427 --> 00:37:10,155
Can I go up now, sir?

320
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:15,393
Now....

321
00:37:55,904 --> 00:37:58,168
I hope you've been at work
this morning, my dears.

322
00:37:58,372 --> 00:37:59,566
-Hard.
-As nails.

323
00:37:59,775 --> 00:38:01,140
Good boys.

324
00:38:01,342 --> 00:38:02,810
Good boys.

325
00:38:03,011 --> 00:38:05,536
-What you got, Dodger?
-Couple of pocketbooks.

326
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:07,941
-Lined?
-Pretty well.

327
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,009
Yeah.

328
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:23,662
Dodge.

329
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:26,327
I don't know, Dodge.

330
00:38:29,803 --> 00:38:31,236
Well...

331
00:38:31,437 --> 00:38:33,735
...not as heavy as they might be...

332
00:38:33,939 --> 00:38:35,338
...but very neat...

333
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,238
...and nicely made.

334
00:38:38,445 --> 00:38:41,073
Ingenious workman,
ain't he, Oliver?

335
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,976
Indeed, sir.

336
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:45,548
And, Charley, what have you got,
my dear?

337
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,775
-Wipes.
-Wipes?

338
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:54,682
They're very good ones.

339
00:38:54,894 --> 00:38:56,725
Very.

340
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,057
You haven't marked them well.

341
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:08,196
The marks should be picked out
with a needle. And we'll--

342
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,032
We'll teach Oliver how to do it.

343
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,105
-Shall us, Oliver?
-lf you please, sir.

344
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:15,938
You'd like to make handkerchiefs as
easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

345
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,706
Very much indeed,
if you'll teach me, sir.

346
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,884
I've never met anyone so green.

347
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,832
Now then, boys...

348
00:39:41,037 --> 00:39:42,764
...the game.

349
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:46,598
We'll show Oliver...

350
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:48,741
...how to make
pocket handkerchiefs.

351
00:39:51,145 --> 00:39:53,113
You'd like to play a game,
wouldn't you?

352
00:39:53,313 --> 00:39:55,043
Yes, sir.

353
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:24,031
-Got the time, guv?
-It's...

354
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:26,496
...8:00.

355
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:39,340
-Playing the game, were we, Fagin?
-As is our custom, my dear.

356
00:41:39,547 --> 00:41:43,003
-He's new. Who's he?
-Oh, this is Oliver.

357
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:44,774
Oliver...

358
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,751
...these are our very good friends
Bet and Nancy.

359
00:41:52,258 --> 00:41:54,420
See, Dodger,
you wanna learn from him.

360
00:41:54,895 --> 00:41:57,694
He's got manners, he has.
A proper gentleman.

361
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,157
We popped in
because we were that cold inside.

362
00:42:00,367 --> 00:42:03,928
As is your custom, my dear.

363
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:06,968
-Charley.
-Come on, Oliver. Join us.

364
00:42:07,173 --> 00:42:09,403
Or don't you sit
with the common folk?

365
00:42:10,342 --> 00:42:13,140
Now, you wanna be
careful of this lot, Oliver.

366
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:15,869
-They'll have you picking--
-Picking out the marks.

367
00:42:16,081 --> 00:42:19,380
Just what we was teaching him,
ain't it, Oliver, my dear?

368
00:42:19,584 --> 00:42:21,347
-Yes, sir.
-"Yes, sir"?

369
00:42:21,553 --> 00:42:24,351
You know who you're talking to,
do you?

370
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:27,490
What's your mother got to say
about you being here?

371
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:30,125
I haven't got a mother.
I'm an orphan.

372
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:31,817
You're in the right company, then.

373
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:37,232
Come on, Oliver,
I'll teach you how to play.

374
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,527
It's called Spec or Speculation.

375
00:42:39,735 --> 00:42:43,263
Three cards each,
and then the one he turns up...

376
00:42:43,474 --> 00:42:45,442
...is trumps.

377
00:42:53,951 --> 00:42:57,545
This is a pleasant life,
ain't it, my dear?

378
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:05,786
-When can I go out, sir?
-Soon. Soon.

379
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:08,823
Let's--

380
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:11,555
Let's see what you've learned.

381
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,093
-Would you like that?
-Oh, yes, sir.

382
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:18,869
See if you can take this out...

383
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:22,168
...without my feeling it.

384
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:50,732
Is it gone?

385
00:43:52,704 --> 00:43:55,673
You're a clever boy, my dear.

386
00:43:55,875 --> 00:43:59,003
I never saw a sharper lad.

387
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:06,179
Here's a shilling for you.

388
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:10,581
Make the Dodger and Charley
your models.

389
00:44:10,788 --> 00:44:12,312
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

390
00:44:12,523 --> 00:44:16,014
He'll be a great man himself,
make you one too.

391
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:17,921
You go on this way...

392
00:44:18,129 --> 00:44:20,962
...you'll be the greatest man
of the time.

393
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,124
Thank you very much, sir.

394
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:37,572
Lovely white apples.
Get your lovely apples.

395
00:44:41,216 --> 00:44:43,777
Biggest cabbages in town.
Come on.

396
00:44:45,521 --> 00:44:47,955
You mean that one
with the wide rim?

397
00:44:48,857 --> 00:44:50,585
Too expensive.

398
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,232
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

399
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:43,738
Stop, thief!

400
00:45:48,113 --> 00:45:49,307
Stop!

401
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,141
Thief!

402
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:54,150
-You're a thief!
-Get him!

403
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:56,853
-Stop him!
-Stop that boy!

404
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,682
Thief!

405
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:02,589
Stop, thief!

406
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,593
Thief!

407
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:08,657
Stop him!

408
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,227
Stop him!

409
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,500
Mind out.

410
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:18,732
Stop, thief!

411
00:46:21,576 --> 00:46:23,510
There, over there.

412
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,875
That way!

413
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:29,982
-Stop, thief! Stop!
-Thief!

414
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:48,565
-What's your name, boy?
-Give him some air.

415
00:46:49,403 --> 00:46:50,733
He's scared to death.

416
00:46:50,937 --> 00:46:54,135
-Where's the gentleman?
-Here's the gentleman now.

417
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:56,366
-ls this the boy, sir?
-Yes, I'm afraid it is.

418
00:46:56,575 --> 00:46:59,101
That's a good one.
Did you hear him, "afraid it is"?

419
00:46:59,313 --> 00:47:02,612
-Poor fellow's hurt himself.
-Yeah, I did that, sir.

420
00:47:02,816 --> 00:47:06,548
Hurt me knuckle against his mouth.
But I stopped him.

421
00:47:06,753 --> 00:47:09,688
-Get up!
-lt wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

422
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:12,322
Of course it wasn't. It never is.

423
00:47:12,525 --> 00:47:14,186
-Now get up.
-Don't hurt him.

424
00:47:14,393 --> 00:47:17,658
Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

425
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:21,834
This way, gentlemen.

426
00:47:21,834 --> 00:47:23,425
This way, gentlemen.

427
00:47:25,435 --> 00:47:28,429
-What's next?
-That is my name and address, sir.

428
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:31,108
Officer, who is this fellow?

429
00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:33,210
-My name is Brownlow.
-Hold your tongue.

430
00:47:33,411 --> 00:47:35,811
Officer, what's this fellow
charged with?

431
00:47:36,012 --> 00:47:38,139
Oh, no, no. He's not charged,
Your Worship.

432
00:47:38,348 --> 00:47:40,146
He appears against the boy.

433
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,942
-Swear him.
-Before I am sworn...

434
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:44,712
-...I must beg to say one word.
-Hold your tongue, sir.

435
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,912
-I will not, sir!
-Hold your tongue this instant.

436
00:47:48,123 --> 00:47:50,491
You're an insolent,
impertinent fellow.

437
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:52,957
-How dare you bully a magistrate.
-What?

438
00:47:53,163 --> 00:47:56,654
Swear this person.
I'll not hear another word. Swear him.

439
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:00,233
"l do solemnly swear to tell
the whole truth, so help me God."

440
00:48:00,436 --> 00:48:03,269
-What's the charge against the boy?
-I was at a bookstore when--

441
00:48:03,472 --> 00:48:05,497
Hold your tongue!
Where's the policeman?

442
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:07,971
Policeman, what is this?
Are there any witnesses?

443
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:10,474
-None, Your Worship.
-The boy is ill.

444
00:48:10,677 --> 00:48:13,272
Oh, yes, I daresay.

445
00:48:13,481 --> 00:48:16,575
Come along, you vagabond.
None of your tricks here.

446
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:18,514
What's your name?

447
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,746
What's your name,
you hardened scoundrel?

448
00:48:21,956 --> 00:48:25,050
-Officer, what's his name?
-What's your name, boy?

449
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,992
Some water. Some water.

450
00:48:28,195 --> 00:48:30,493
He says his name is Sam Waters,
Your Worship.

451
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:32,392
-Where does he live?
-Where do you live?

452
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,898
-Anywhere he can, Your Worship.
-Stuff and nonsense.

453
00:48:36,102 --> 00:48:37,662
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

454
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:39,863
No, I think he really is ill,
Your Worship.

455
00:48:40,074 --> 00:48:42,940
I know better,
or my name's not Fang.

456
00:48:43,143 --> 00:48:45,270
Stand away, officer. He's shamming.

457
00:48:46,346 --> 00:48:47,903
He stands committed
for three months.

458
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:49,979
Hard labor, of course.
Clear the office.

459
00:48:50,183 --> 00:48:52,481
Stop. Stop, stop!
Don't take him away.

460
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:55,585
What is this? Who is this?
Turn this man out.

461
00:48:55,787 --> 00:48:59,985
-Clear the office.
-I will not be turned out! I will speak!

462
00:49:00,194 --> 00:49:02,252
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

463
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:05,160
-I demand to be heard.
-What have you got to say?

464
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,298
-lt was not this boy.
-Not this boy? Who was it, then?

465
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,491
The robbery was committed by
two others while the man was reading.

466
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:14,967
I saw it done. I saw that this boy
was perfectly amazed by it.

467
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:16,469
Why didn't you come before?

468
00:49:17,106 --> 00:49:20,200
-I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.
-Reading, you say?

469
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:22,003
A book, I suppose.

470
00:49:22,479 --> 00:49:24,209
Yes, the very one
he has in his hand.

471
00:49:25,315 --> 00:49:27,216
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.

472
00:49:27,418 --> 00:49:28,941
Well, you're a nice one.

473
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:32,713
To prefer a charge
against an innocent boy.

474
00:49:33,156 --> 00:49:35,954
I consider, sir,
that you've obtained that book...

475
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,150
...under very suspicious
and disreputable circumstances.

476
00:49:39,362 --> 00:49:40,555
-Damn me!
-Bookseller...

477
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:42,730
...do you want to press charges
against him?

478
00:49:42,931 --> 00:49:44,364
-Certainly not.
-Well...

479
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:47,001
...think yourself fortunate...

480
00:49:47,202 --> 00:49:49,501
...that the owner of the book
declines to prosecute.

481
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:50,965
The boy is discharged.

482
00:49:51,172 --> 00:49:52,366
-Clear the office.
-Damn me.

483
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:54,906
Clear the office!
Clear the office!

484
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,101
Next case.

485
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:01,237
Come on. Move along, sir, please.
Just move along, sir.

486
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:02,973
There's a good gentleman, sir.

487
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:05,743
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

488
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:08,820
Mind that step.
Just mind that step there.

489
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:12,522
Make way for the law, sir.

490
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:17,154
-Careful. Careful with him.
-He seems very young too.

491
00:50:18,699 --> 00:50:19,960
Call a coach, pray.

492
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:23,135
-Yeah, right away, sir.
-I'm sorry.

493
00:50:24,638 --> 00:50:26,538
Poor boy.

494
00:50:31,077 --> 00:50:33,739
-Mind yourself, madam.
-Thank you, sir.

495
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,680
-Got one, sir.
-Thank you, officer.

496
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:38,874
Let me, sir.

497
00:50:39,085 --> 00:50:40,779
There we go.

498
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:45,282
-Will you drop me off, sir?
-Of course.

499
00:50:46,391 --> 00:50:47,586
All right.

500
00:50:47,792 --> 00:50:50,283
If you could just take his head, sir.

501
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:54,362
-Where to, sir?
-Pentonville.

502
00:50:54,565 --> 00:50:56,261
-Pentonville.
-Yes.

503
00:50:57,702 --> 00:50:58,269
Answer me! Where is he?

504
00:50:58,269 --> 00:50:58,894
Answer me! Where is he?

505
00:50:59,102 --> 00:51:01,628
What's become of the boy?
Speak out, or I'll throttle you!

506
00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:04,864
The traps have got him!
Let go of me, will you?!

507
00:51:12,815 --> 00:51:14,009
Bullseye!

508
00:51:14,216 --> 00:51:17,617
Who pitched this here at me?
Who done it?

509
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:23,117
Bullseye.
Come in, you sneaking warmint.

510
00:51:23,326 --> 00:51:25,987
What you stopping outside for?

511
00:51:27,029 --> 00:51:28,723
Lay down.

512
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,226
What you up to, Fagin?
Ill-treating the boys again?

513
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:38,335
A wonder they don't murder you.
I would, if I was them.

514
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:42,270
Don't speak so loud.
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

515
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:45,002
Give us a drink.
And mind you don't poison it.

516
00:51:45,213 --> 00:51:46,941
Charley.

517
00:51:47,448 --> 00:51:49,542
Good stuff, Bill.

518
00:51:51,053 --> 00:51:52,451
So, Dodger...

519
00:51:52,653 --> 00:51:55,452
-...what's it all about?
-A new boy.

520
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:57,749
Come out with us
afore he was rightly up to it.

521
00:51:58,125 --> 00:52:01,389
-Got nabbed by the traps.
-You see, Bill...

522
00:52:01,595 --> 00:52:06,622
...I'm afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

523
00:52:07,167 --> 00:52:10,000
You were blowed upon, Fagin.

524
00:52:10,204 --> 00:52:11,398
And about time.

525
00:52:11,604 --> 00:52:14,539
And I'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game was up with us...

526
00:52:14,742 --> 00:52:19,370
...it would come out rather worse
for you than it would for me, my dear.

527
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:21,509
There's only one thing for it.

528
00:52:21,713 --> 00:52:25,113
Somebody's gotta find out at the office
what's being done to him.

529
00:52:25,317 --> 00:52:27,284
Somebody's gotta
get hold of him somehow.

530
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:30,649
I ain't going near no police office.
Not for nobody, nohow.

531
00:52:30,988 --> 00:52:33,857
I have it, the very thing.
Bet will go.

532
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:36,619
-Won't you, my dear?
-I'm blessed if I will.

533
00:52:36,827 --> 00:52:38,590
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

534
00:52:38,796 --> 00:52:41,856
It won't do. There's no use
in trying it on, Fagin.

535
00:52:42,066 --> 00:52:43,829
-What do you mean by that?
-What I say.

536
00:52:44,034 --> 00:52:45,934
Why, you're just
the very person for it.

537
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:47,967
Nobody about here
knows anything about you.

538
00:52:48,172 --> 00:52:50,765
And as I don't want them to neither.

539
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:53,169
It's rather more "no" than "yes"
with me, Bill.

540
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:55,435
-She'll go, Fagin.
-No, she won't, Fagin.

541
00:52:55,646 --> 00:52:57,636
Yes, she will, Fagin.

542
00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:11,925
-Can I help you, miss?
-I'm looking for my little brother.

543
00:53:12,627 --> 00:53:15,152
-Now, who would he be?
-A lovely little boy.

544
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:18,595
Lovely manners.
Gentle as falling snow.

545
00:53:19,601 --> 00:53:21,465
We don't get many of those.

546
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,297
I think you'll be wanting
Mr. Fang's court.

547
00:53:30,745 --> 00:53:33,977
George, this here young lady
is looking for her brother.

548
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:36,207
The one that fainted
and got away with it.

549
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:38,715
Oh, yeah.
Gentleman took him away.

550
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:42,048
What gentleman? Gracious heavens,
what gentleman?

551
00:53:42,256 --> 00:53:44,850
Well, lives in Pentonville, I believe.

552
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,357
Oh, my God.

553
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,953
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:53:50,163 --> 00:53:52,563
His card's here somewhere.

555
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,061
Here we are.

556
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:04,068
Thank you, sir.

557
00:55:03,631 --> 00:55:05,362
Mr. Brownlow.

558
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:07,660
Mr. Brownlow.

559
00:55:35,528 --> 00:55:37,188
There's something in him...

560
00:55:37,397 --> 00:55:40,298
...that touched my heart,
Mrs. Bedwin.

561
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,525
Can't explain it.

562
00:55:42,734 --> 00:55:45,499
I feel the same, sir.

563
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:47,729
Who is he? What is he?

564
00:55:47,939 --> 00:55:49,703
You know nothing of him.

565
00:55:49,908 --> 00:55:52,034
He had a fever. What of that?

566
00:55:52,477 --> 00:55:54,967
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

567
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:57,978
I knew a man in Jamaica who was
hanged for murdering his master.

568
00:55:58,182 --> 00:56:00,377
He had a fever six times.

569
00:56:00,718 --> 00:56:03,745
-I know there is goodness in him.
-How do you know it?

570
00:56:03,955 --> 00:56:05,480
Goodness and innocence.

571
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,514
-I knew it the first moment I saw him.
-He'll deceive you.

572
00:56:08,726 --> 00:56:10,659
Let you down
at the first opportunity...

573
00:56:10,862 --> 00:56:13,523
...Iike all your other
good and innocent causes.

574
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:18,258
If that boy's good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

575
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:29,340
How do you feel, my dear?

576
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:31,241
Very happy, sir.

577
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:35,406
-And very grateful to you indeed, sir.
-Good boy.

578
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:40,149
Have you given him any nourishment,
Bedwin? Any slops?

579
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,256
Not slops, sir. Broth.

580
00:56:43,891 --> 00:56:45,416
A couple of glasses of port wine...

581
00:56:45,627 --> 00:56:48,187
...would have done him
a great deal more good.

582
00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:50,457
Wouldn't they, Sam?

583
00:56:50,666 --> 00:56:52,634
My name is Oliver, sir.

584
00:56:52,835 --> 00:56:54,665
Oliver?

585
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:58,899
-Oliver what? Oliver Waters?
-No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.

586
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:02,538
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

587
00:57:02,744 --> 00:57:04,608
I never told him so, sir.

588
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:08,446
-You did not?
-No, sir.

589
00:57:11,218 --> 00:57:13,948
-You're not angry with me, are you?
-No, no.

590
00:57:15,087 --> 00:57:16,646
Queer name.

591
00:57:16,857 --> 00:57:18,084
Oliver Twist.

592
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:23,419
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

593
00:57:23,628 --> 00:57:25,823
A great number, sir.

594
00:57:26,031 --> 00:57:28,262
Never saw so many.

595
00:57:30,702 --> 00:57:32,965
How would you like
to grow up a clever man...

596
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:35,139
...and write books?

597
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:37,865
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

598
00:57:38,077 --> 00:57:40,805
Wouldn't you like to be
a book writer?

599
00:57:42,013 --> 00:57:45,574
I think it'd be a better thing
to be a bookseller, sir.

600
00:57:47,651 --> 00:57:51,143
You have said a very good thing.

601
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:52,816
Well, well.

602
00:57:53,023 --> 00:57:56,423
We won't make an author of you while
there's an honest trade to be learned...

603
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:58,787
...or brickmaking to turn to.

604
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:02,293
-Are you going to send me away, sir?
-No, my dear child.

605
00:58:02,499 --> 00:58:05,228
You need not be afraid
that I am going to desert you...

606
00:58:05,435 --> 00:58:07,903
-...unless you give me cause.
-I never, never will, sir.

607
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:09,297
I hope not...

608
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:12,371
...because I feel strongly disposed
to trust you.

609
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:13,836
Thank you, sir.

610
00:58:23,352 --> 00:58:25,513
I'm pleased
I won't have to wear those again.

611
00:58:25,722 --> 00:58:27,451
So are we all, my dear.

612
00:58:29,891 --> 00:58:31,621
There.

613
00:59:28,445 --> 00:59:30,275
Hello.

614
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:32,141
What's that?

615
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:34,215
This is young Oliver Twist.

616
00:59:34,418 --> 00:59:36,079
The bookseller's boy
brought a package.

617
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:39,778
Oh, stop him, Oliver.
There's some books to go back.

618
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:43,083
-ls that the boy who had the fever?
-That's the boy.

619
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,475
Mind out!

620
01:00:10,453 --> 01:00:14,149
-No sign of him, sir.
-Oh, dear, I'm very sorry for that.

621
01:00:14,355 --> 01:00:16,789
I particularly wished some books
to be returned tonight.

622
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:20,687
Why not send Oliver with them?
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.

623
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:22,328
Yes, do let me take them.

624
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,657
If you please, sir.
I'll run all the way.

625
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,674
You shall go, my dear.

626
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:37,900
Ask Mrs. Bedwin
to show you the way.

627
01:00:39,146 --> 01:00:41,739
-And, Oliver....
-Yes, sir?

628
01:00:41,947 --> 01:00:44,782
Give the bookseller this.

629
01:00:48,221 --> 01:00:50,280
The money I owe him.

630
01:00:56,828 --> 01:00:58,591
I won't be long, sir.

631
01:01:00,231 --> 01:01:04,190
-How long do you think it'll take him?
-You really expect him to come back?

632
01:01:05,935 --> 01:01:08,632
-You don't?
-With a ¡ê5 note in his pocket?

633
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,501
No, I do not.

634
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:13,770
If ever that boy
returns to this house...

635
01:01:13,978 --> 01:01:16,003
...I'll eat my own head, sir.

636
01:01:17,447 --> 01:01:18,641
And yours.

637
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:37,565
Oh, my little brother!

638
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:40,829
-I don't believe my eyes.
-Let me go. Help!

639
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:44,905
-It's a miracle. Oh, I've found him.
-Please let me go.

640
01:01:45,107 --> 01:01:47,871
-Oh, Oliver. Oliver.
-Nancy.

641
01:01:48,077 --> 01:01:51,409
You're such a naughty boy to make me
suffer such distress on your account.

642
01:01:51,612 --> 01:01:53,705
-Let go of me!
-What's the matter, ma'am?

643
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:55,646
He ran away from his parents.

644
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:58,115
-Get off me!
-Hard-working, respectable people...

645
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,880
...and joined a set of thieves
and bad characters.

646
01:02:01,089 --> 01:02:02,386
Broke his mother's heart.

647
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,058
Young wretch.
Go home, you little brute.

648
01:02:05,259 --> 01:02:06,725
I haven't got any parents.

649
01:02:06,928 --> 01:02:08,691
I'm an orphan.
I live in Pentonville.

650
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,090
Oh, only hear him,
how he braves it out.

651
01:02:11,298 --> 01:02:13,528
-What? Young Oliver.
-It's true.

652
01:02:15,534 --> 01:02:17,526
You come home
to your poor mother.

653
01:02:17,736 --> 01:02:20,797
I don't belong to them!
I don't know them! Help! Help!

654
01:02:21,007 --> 01:02:22,200
"Help, help"?

655
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:25,674
I'll give you "help, help,"
you little wretch!

656
01:02:25,879 --> 01:02:27,437
And these books.

657
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:30,341
Have you been a-stealing them,
have you, eh?

658
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:33,984
-You little villain.
-That's right. You give it to him.

659
01:02:34,186 --> 01:02:37,416
-Only way to bring him to his senses.
-I will, missus.

660
01:02:37,623 --> 01:02:39,385
And you come with me,
you little wretch.

661
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:41,286
It'll do him good.

662
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:43,961
-Who is this man? Help!
-Bullseye, mind him, boy.

663
01:02:44,162 --> 01:02:46,629
-Mind him.
-Help! Help!

664
01:02:48,633 --> 01:02:50,065
Look at him, Fagin.

665
01:02:50,269 --> 01:02:52,462
Hold me, somebody.

666
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:55,229
Hold me, somebody,
while I laugh it out.

667
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,531
Look at his togs, Fagin.

668
01:02:57,741 --> 01:03:00,368
Delighted to see you
looking so well, my dear.

669
01:03:00,577 --> 01:03:03,204
Why didn't you write, my dear,
and say you was coming?

670
01:03:03,413 --> 01:03:06,541
We'd have got something warm
for supper.

671
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,445
Hello, Fagin. What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.

672
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,314
Oh, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.

673
01:03:12,521 --> 01:03:15,183
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.

674
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:16,652
Come on, hand over, will you?

675
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:18,984
This is hardly fair, Bill.
Hardly fair, Nancy.

676
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:22,596
Fair or not fair,
hand over, I tell you.

677
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:26,358
Give it here, you avaricious
old skeleton. Give it here!

678
01:03:26,568 --> 01:03:29,766
That's for our share of the trouble,
and not half enough neither.

679
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:33,642
You may keep the books if you're fond
of reading. If you ain't, sell them.

680
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:37,901
They're very pretty.
Beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?

681
01:03:38,113 --> 01:03:41,104
Send them back.
They belong to Mr. Brownlow.

682
01:03:41,316 --> 01:03:43,147
Send them back.
The books and the money.

683
01:03:43,885 --> 01:03:45,079
He'll think I stole them.

684
01:03:45,287 --> 01:03:47,083
-Please send them back.
-The boy's right.

685
01:03:47,289 --> 01:03:50,848
You're right, Oliver. You're right.
They will think you've stolen them.

686
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:54,750
It couldn't have happened better
if we'd chosen our time.

687
01:03:54,962 --> 01:03:56,863
Help! Help! Police!

688
01:03:57,064 --> 01:03:59,362
Fetch the police! The police!

689
01:04:00,133 --> 01:04:02,658
Keep back the dog, Bill.
He'll tear the boy to pieces.

690
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:05,770
-Serve him right.
-Help! Fetch the police!

691
01:04:06,772 --> 01:04:07,966
Fetch the police!

692
01:04:08,174 --> 01:04:10,471
Step aside, or I'll split
your head against the wall.

693
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:11,769
I don't care.

694
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:15,469
That child shan't be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first.

695
01:04:17,383 --> 01:04:20,215
Bullseye. Here. Bullseye!

696
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:29,258
Dodger!

697
01:04:29,793 --> 01:04:32,091
Get after him!

698
01:04:34,998 --> 01:04:38,126
Take your hands off me!

699
01:05:09,265 --> 01:05:12,165
So you wanted to get away,
my dear, did you?

700
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:14,631
Wanted to call for the police,
did you?

701
01:05:14,837 --> 01:05:17,567
We'll soon cure you of that.

702
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,007
I won't stand by
and see this done, Fagin.

703
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:24,144
You got the boy.
What more do you want?

704
01:05:24,344 --> 01:05:27,405
Keep quiet, Nancy, or I'll quieten you
for a good long time to come.

705
01:05:27,615 --> 01:05:29,583
Let him be. Let him be!

706
01:05:29,784 --> 01:05:31,979
You're a fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.

707
01:05:32,185 --> 01:05:34,210
God Almighty help me, I am.

708
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:37,857
He's a thief, a liar, a devil,
all that's bad from this night forth.

709
01:05:38,058 --> 01:05:40,549
Ain't that enough for the old wretch
without blows?

710
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,661
Come, come, we must have
civil words. Civil words.

711
01:05:43,863 --> 01:05:47,161
Civil words?
Civil words, you old villain!

712
01:05:47,366 --> 01:05:50,200
I thieved for you when I was a child
not half as old as this.

713
01:05:50,403 --> 01:05:51,870
It's your living.

714
01:05:52,072 --> 01:05:55,269
Yes, and you're the wretch
that drove me to it...

715
01:05:55,474 --> 01:05:59,637
...and who will keep me at it,
day and night, till I die!

716
01:06:02,347 --> 01:06:06,113
Dodger, Charley,
put Oliver to bed.

717
01:06:06,317 --> 01:06:08,945
Best to take them clothes off.
They're too good to sleep in.

718
01:06:09,153 --> 01:06:12,589
Charley's right. This here suit cost
more than 4 pence ha'penny.

719
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:16,056
I never felt such lovely stuff.
Have you, Dodger?

720
01:06:16,528 --> 01:06:18,391
Not me. But I'm willing to lay odds...

721
01:06:18,596 --> 01:06:22,155
...this is the same stuff
the queen wears on Sundays.

722
01:06:24,667 --> 01:06:26,225
Quick, get him.

723
01:06:26,437 --> 01:06:28,370
Take it off.

724
01:06:31,106 --> 01:06:32,300
Lift him up.

725
01:06:32,509 --> 01:06:34,771
Up he goes.

726
01:06:37,249 --> 01:06:39,441
Get them shoes off.

727
01:07:15,483 --> 01:07:17,848
Little something for your luncheon,
my dear?

728
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:36,795
Shall we have a little chat?

729
01:07:37,903 --> 01:07:39,699
Oliver?

730
01:07:39,937 --> 01:07:41,700
Shall us?

731
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:46,833
I expect you'd welcome...

732
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:51,844
...the sound of a human voice again,
eh, my dear?

733
01:07:56,954 --> 01:07:58,750
Do you know...

734
01:07:59,289 --> 01:08:03,623
...what I consider the greatest sin
in the world, my dear?

735
01:08:04,593 --> 01:08:07,255
Ingratitude.

736
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:11,127
And that's what you're guilty of...

737
01:08:11,335 --> 01:08:13,393
...ingratitude.

738
01:08:13,637 --> 01:08:16,970
We took you in, we cherished you. If
we hadn't, you'd have died of hunger.

739
01:08:17,174 --> 01:08:18,835
How do you repay us?
You run away...

740
01:08:19,042 --> 01:08:24,378
...you cry out for the police, you
cause us great anxiety and expense.

741
01:08:28,652 --> 01:08:31,517
There was a lad once, just like you,
and I was a father to him.

742
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,187
He ran away, like you.
He indeed went to the police.

743
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:37,382
And can you guess
how he ended up?

744
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:42,663
They hanged him...

745
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:45,389
...at the Old Bailey.

746
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:51,004
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true...

747
01:08:51,872 --> 01:08:55,831
...but all of it necessary to provide
for my own safety...

748
01:08:56,042 --> 01:08:57,806
...and that of my friends.

749
01:08:58,011 --> 01:09:00,775
Yeah. Poor boy.

750
01:09:01,381 --> 01:09:03,349
Hanged.

751
01:09:03,951 --> 01:09:06,248
It's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.

752
01:09:06,453 --> 01:09:08,580
Dawn, the gallows...

753
01:09:08,788 --> 01:09:11,085
...the rope, the noose.

754
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,588
You don't always have
to be guilty, you see, Oliver.

755
01:09:13,793 --> 01:09:15,453
They hang you for anything
these days.

756
01:09:15,661 --> 01:09:18,595
That's because they're
so very fond of hanging.

757
01:09:27,639 --> 01:09:30,506
But if you do as you're told...

758
01:09:31,042 --> 01:09:34,068
...we'll be very good friends yet.

759
01:09:43,186 --> 01:09:46,817
You must feel free
to walk about now, Oliver.

760
01:09:48,658 --> 01:09:50,149
Yes, feel free.

761
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,635
-Here, Oliver.
-Yes?

762
01:10:01,171 --> 01:10:03,934
I'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straightaway.

763
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:09,001
-Will you do that for me, my man?
-All right. I'll be glad to have company.

764
01:10:09,212 --> 01:10:13,649
There's a good fellow. You may start
by japanning my trotter-cases.

765
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:16,318
In plain English, clean my boots.

766
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:22,655
What a pity he ain't a prig.

767
01:10:22,858 --> 01:10:25,257
He don't know what's good for him.

768
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:27,153
I suppose you don't know
what a prig is.

769
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,590
Yes, I do. It's a....

770
01:10:29,797 --> 01:10:32,425
It's a thief.

771
01:10:32,633 --> 01:10:34,124
You're one, aren't you?

772
01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:37,064
Yes, I am. And so we all are.
Down to the dog...

773
01:10:37,272 --> 01:10:39,034
...and he's the downiest one
of the lot.

774
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,207
And the least given to peaching.

775
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:43,433
He wouldn't so much as bark
in a witness box...

776
01:10:43,643 --> 01:10:48,410
-...for fear of committing himself.
-He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

777
01:10:48,614 --> 01:10:51,139
Why don't you put yourself
under Fagin, Oliver?

778
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:53,180
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

779
01:10:53,386 --> 01:10:57,220
Like your old gentleman
in Pentonville. Big house, that.

780
01:10:57,423 --> 01:11:00,653
I had a peep at it, I did.
Nice inside, was it?

781
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:05,262
Yes. And I slept in a proper bed.
In my own room.

782
01:11:05,463 --> 01:11:09,058
-Good stuff on the walls, eh?
-Yes. Indeed.

783
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:10,734
Put yourself under Fagin...

784
01:11:10,935 --> 01:11:14,392
...and you'll be able to retire
to a property just like that.

785
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:16,572
And do the genteel.

786
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:18,833
No, he's scared
he'll come to be scragged.

787
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:20,601
I don't know what that means.

788
01:11:25,082 --> 01:11:27,710
If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs
and watches, Nolly...

789
01:11:28,185 --> 01:11:31,245
...some other cove will. You have
the same right to them as they have.

790
01:11:31,455 --> 01:11:34,185
To be sure. To be sure.

791
01:11:34,392 --> 01:11:37,121
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear,
in a nutshell.

792
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:38,624
Take the Dodger's word for it.

793
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:41,764
He understands the catechism
of his trade.

794
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,106
Cabby?

795
01:12:15,063 --> 01:12:18,054
-I've come from Bill.
-For what?

796
01:12:18,266 --> 01:12:21,757
-For no harm.
-I don't believe it.

797
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:26,201
If I could help you, I would,
but I've not the power.

798
01:12:26,405 --> 01:12:29,273
Now, I've promised him
you'll be good and silent.

799
01:12:29,476 --> 01:12:32,411
If you're not, you'll only do
yourself harm.

800
01:12:32,612 --> 01:12:34,581
And me too.

801
01:12:44,223 --> 01:12:46,053
Did he come quiet?

802
01:12:46,258 --> 01:12:47,249
Like a lamb.

803
01:12:50,462 --> 01:12:52,292
Sit down.

804
01:12:57,034 --> 01:13:00,129
And let me read you a lecture.

805
01:13:06,442 --> 01:13:07,773
You know what this is?

806
01:13:08,678 --> 01:13:11,805
-Yes.
-Well, then.

807
01:13:15,585 --> 01:13:17,850
This is powder.

808
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:26,654
That here's a bullet.

809
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:33,531
And this is a little bit
of an old hat...

810
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:35,794
...for wadding.

811
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:46,543
-Now it's loaded.
-Yes, I can see it is, sir.

812
01:13:47,181 --> 01:13:49,582
If you speak a word
when you're out of doors with me...

813
01:13:49,785 --> 01:13:51,719
...unless I speak to you...

814
01:13:51,919 --> 01:13:55,116
...this loading will go in your head
without notice.

815
01:13:55,322 --> 01:13:59,019
So if you do make up your mind
to speak without leave...

816
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,818
...says your prayers first.

817
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:04,892
The short and long of what you mean
is that if you're crossed by him...

818
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:07,191
...you'll prevent him
from telling tales after...

819
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,334
...by shooting him through the head.

820
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,901
And you'll take your chance
of swinging for it.

821
01:14:12,106 --> 01:14:15,665
That's it. Women always put things
in the fewest words.

822
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,967
Supper, Nancy.

823
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:20,338
And then a snooze afore starting.

824
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,833
My pal Bill.

825
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,704
The door's open, come in.

826
01:14:56,813 --> 01:14:59,339
Don't make such a row.

827
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:04,153
Show us a glim, Toby.

828
01:15:04,353 --> 01:15:07,583
Barney, a glim.
Show the gentleman in.

829
01:15:07,925 --> 01:15:12,554
Barney?
Wake up first, if convenient.

830
01:15:23,871 --> 01:15:26,636
Mr. Sykes. Come in, sir, come in.

831
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:48,258
Bill, my boy. Glad to see you.

832
01:15:49,963 --> 01:15:51,897
Who's...?

833
01:15:52,099 --> 01:15:53,997
-Who's this?
-Only the boy.

834
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:57,464
-One of Mr. Fagin's lads?
-Yeah. It's time.

835
01:15:57,670 --> 01:15:59,364
Right.

836
01:16:00,707 --> 01:16:02,037
Barkers for me, Barney.

837
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,843
-They're loaded.
-Good.

838
01:16:21,658 --> 01:16:24,685
-The persuaders?
-Got them.

839
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,596
Keys, center bits.

840
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,201
Darkies.

841
01:16:47,952 --> 01:16:49,886
Nothing forgotten?

842
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:02,788
Yeah, it's all quiet.

843
01:17:53,143 --> 01:17:56,203
I can't. I can't.

844
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,243
You will.

845
01:17:58,450 --> 01:17:59,883
It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

846
01:18:29,645 --> 01:18:31,442
Have mercy.
Don't make me steal from him.

847
01:18:31,647 --> 01:18:34,047
-Have mercy on me.
-Come here.

848
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,616
For God's sake, let me run away
and die in the fields.

849
01:18:36,819 --> 01:18:40,185
-I'll never come near London, never.
-Shut it.

850
01:18:40,388 --> 01:18:44,346
Get up. Or I'll strew your brains
on the grass.

851
01:19:24,964 --> 01:19:27,124
I'm putting you through there.

852
01:19:27,332 --> 01:19:30,130
Go to the front door
and unfasten it.

853
01:19:30,801 --> 01:19:34,101
I can't, there's a bolt at the top.
I know it, I can't reach it.

854
01:19:34,306 --> 01:19:38,401
-Well, stand on a chair or something.
-Just do it.

855
01:20:34,895 --> 01:20:37,888
To the door.
To the front door, damn you.

856
01:20:40,267 --> 01:20:41,461
Who's there?

857
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:45,705
Mrs. Bedwin? Is that you?

858
01:21:00,419 --> 01:21:02,011
Come here. Come here.

859
01:21:03,556 --> 01:21:07,458
Save me! Save me!
Save me, for God's sake!

860
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:17,726
Help!

861
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:22,168
Help! Police!

862
01:21:31,449 --> 01:21:33,246
Give him here.

863
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:41,156
Oh, damnation, how he bleeds.

864
01:21:41,358 --> 01:21:44,088
-ls he hit bad?
-He's gotta be hit worse.

865
01:21:50,099 --> 01:21:51,623
-Give me a pistol.
-What?

866
01:21:52,669 --> 01:21:55,160
We gotta get rid of him,
or he'll squeal.

867
01:21:55,371 --> 01:21:57,272
We gotta do him in.

868
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:00,666
Here, here. Down here by the river.

869
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:03,744
But, Bill! Bill!

870
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:09,173
-Bill?
-Help!

871
01:22:09,384 --> 01:22:12,181
Help! Help!

872
01:22:13,055 --> 01:22:16,148
-Bill.
-Help!

873
01:22:24,299 --> 01:22:25,890
Snap.

874
01:22:27,467 --> 01:22:29,128
Snap.

875
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:32,331
Snap.

876
01:22:35,141 --> 01:22:36,733
Snap.

877
01:22:39,311 --> 01:22:40,869
Snap.

878
01:22:54,659 --> 01:22:56,593
Well, well.

879
01:22:56,794 --> 01:22:58,352
How are you, Fagey?

880
01:23:00,263 --> 01:23:03,666
Scarce. Scarce!
Where's Bill?

881
01:23:03,869 --> 01:23:06,132
-He's-- He's bleeding.
-What happened?

882
01:23:06,337 --> 01:23:08,863
All in good time.

883
01:23:09,074 --> 01:23:12,804
I can't talk business
till I've ate and drank.

884
01:23:19,117 --> 01:23:22,245
Nancy, I said, scarce. Scarce!

885
01:23:22,452 --> 01:23:23,646
Where's Bill?

886
01:23:23,853 --> 01:23:25,913
Well, produce the sustenance,
if you please.

887
01:23:26,123 --> 01:23:27,989
Dodger!

888
01:23:28,191 --> 01:23:29,386
Nancy, scarce!

889
01:23:36,232 --> 01:23:38,757
-The crack failed.
-I smelt that.

890
01:23:38,968 --> 01:23:41,732
For the last time of asking,
where's Bill?

891
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:45,299
Dodger.

892
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:51,236
Put him to bed,
give him a nip of gin.

893
01:23:58,153 --> 01:24:01,247
The boy was about to blow on us,
Fagey.

894
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:03,717
-He was seen.
-Seen?

895
01:24:03,924 --> 01:24:06,552
He was seen? Who saw him?

896
01:24:06,894 --> 01:24:09,418
Two old ones.
He shouted out.

897
01:24:09,630 --> 01:24:11,824
Bill lost his head,
fired his pistol....

898
01:24:12,031 --> 01:24:14,501
-And hit the boy?
-I don't know. There was two shots.

899
01:24:14,702 --> 01:24:17,067
Only one was Bill's.

900
01:24:17,271 --> 01:24:20,727
We made a run for it.
I had ahold of the boy, and Bill fell.

901
01:24:20,941 --> 01:24:22,669
Fell? Was he hurt?

902
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:26,311
No. Last seen, he was swimming
to London.

903
01:24:29,181 --> 01:24:31,149
Bullseye.

904
01:24:34,251 --> 01:24:36,549
I told you not to bring a soul here.

905
01:24:36,754 --> 01:24:38,780
Now you've brought the devil.

906
01:24:38,989 --> 01:24:41,356
You said to fetch him.

907
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:44,323
His fever is that high,
he don't remember nothing.

908
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:48,158
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

909
01:24:48,366 --> 01:24:50,493
I'm as weak as water.

910
01:24:50,702 --> 01:24:52,363
Get us a drink.

911
01:24:53,904 --> 01:24:58,568
-What evil wind has blowed you here?
-No evil wind, my dear.

912
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:02,710
You, Bill, you.
You said we need to speak.

913
01:25:08,352 --> 01:25:10,252
What you done with that boy?
Where is he?

914
01:25:10,454 --> 01:25:12,921
Safe and sound.
The Dodger's minding him.

915
01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:16,717
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

916
01:25:19,929 --> 01:25:22,419
What about the boy, Bill?

917
01:25:24,868 --> 01:25:27,530
We don't want anyone
peaching on us, do we?

918
01:25:27,737 --> 01:25:30,797
And as long as that boy's alive,
we're as good as hung.

919
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:33,530
So, what's to be done?

920
01:25:35,443 --> 01:25:37,377
-Nothing.
-Nothing?

921
01:25:37,579 --> 01:25:40,638
-Not till I'm better.
-Then what?

922
01:25:41,483 --> 01:25:44,041
-Then I'll do for him.
-How, Bill? Where?

923
01:25:44,986 --> 01:25:47,979
Outside of London somewhere.
I'll find a river and I'll drown him.

924
01:25:48,189 --> 01:25:50,555
The boy's weak.
Bill, he was wounded.

925
01:25:50,757 --> 01:25:53,192
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

926
01:25:53,394 --> 01:25:56,419
When he can walk, tell me.
I'll fetch him.

927
01:25:57,831 --> 01:25:59,093
Now, get out of here.

928
01:25:59,833 --> 01:26:01,527
Yes.

929
01:26:02,536 --> 01:26:04,162
Yes.

930
01:26:04,403 --> 01:26:07,395
Bill, you're right.

931
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:12,506
It's for the best.

932
01:26:17,016 --> 01:26:19,279
I'm burning up.

933
01:26:19,485 --> 01:26:21,076
Give me me physic.
Where's me physic?

934
01:26:23,454 --> 01:26:25,945
You look like a corpse
come back to life again.

935
01:26:26,157 --> 01:26:29,321
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

936
01:26:30,461 --> 01:26:32,190
What do you look at me so hard for?

937
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:35,561
-What you thinking of?
-Of many things, Bill.

938
01:26:35,768 --> 01:26:37,826
-What odds in that?
-I'll tell you what it is.

939
01:26:38,037 --> 01:26:39,800
If you haven't caught the fever...

940
01:26:40,004 --> 01:26:43,063
...then there's something
more than usual in the wind.

941
01:26:43,274 --> 01:26:45,799
And something dangerous too.

942
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:49,471
Give me me physic, I say.

943
01:26:52,148 --> 01:26:55,140
No, no, no.

944
01:26:55,719 --> 01:26:59,018
There ain't a stauncher-hearted
girl going...

945
01:26:59,689 --> 01:27:02,817
...or I'd have cut her throat
three months ago.

946
01:27:04,394 --> 01:27:07,829
She's got a fever coming on.
That's it.

947
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:32,343
Here. Make you feel better.

948
01:27:39,324 --> 01:27:41,451
Sit aside me.

949
01:27:43,930 --> 01:27:47,990
Put on your own face, or I'll alter it
so you won't know it again.

950
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:15,209
-Wait.
-Ma'am.

951
01:29:33,164 --> 01:29:35,632
-Yes?
-Does Mr. Brownlow live here?

952
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:38,963
Who are you? What do you want?
Go around the back.

953
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:41,968
I have information
about Oliver Twist.

954
01:29:46,078 --> 01:29:48,343
Is he all right? Is he safe?

955
01:29:49,515 --> 01:29:53,178
-Where is he?
-I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

956
01:29:53,384 --> 01:29:55,875
He's not here.

957
01:29:56,621 --> 01:29:58,452
The boy's innocent, tell him that.

958
01:29:59,624 --> 01:30:02,490
-Where is he?
-Safe.

959
01:30:03,895 --> 01:30:07,262
-But he may not be for long.
-Where is he?

960
01:30:18,909 --> 01:30:20,500
Give Mr. Brownlow a message.

961
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,008
Tell him to meet me on Sunday
at midnight...

962
01:30:23,212 --> 01:30:25,442
-...on London Bridge.
-Midnight?

963
01:30:25,647 --> 01:30:27,275
And if I'm not there...

964
01:30:27,483 --> 01:30:31,919
...then tell him to come the next night
and the next. I'll be there. Tell him.

965
01:30:37,592 --> 01:30:41,358
There, my dear,
you look as good as new.

966
01:30:41,863 --> 01:30:45,593
-How do you feel?
-Tired, sir.

967
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:46,994
Well, yes, yes.

968
01:30:47,201 --> 01:30:50,693
It is long after midnight.
Shortly, you'll sleep a good sleep.

969
01:30:50,905 --> 01:30:52,337
But my meaning was...

970
01:30:52,539 --> 01:30:54,871
...how do you feel
in yourself, Oliver?

971
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:57,339
Better. Thank you, sir.

972
01:30:57,545 --> 01:31:01,538
-But for the ache in my arm.
-Come sit.

973
01:31:04,017 --> 01:31:08,646
I have the very thing for such pains
as yours, my dear.

974
01:31:10,223 --> 01:31:11,485
Undo the bandage.

975
01:31:22,368 --> 01:31:24,996
Oh, my God.

976
01:31:25,672 --> 01:31:28,469
It's a nasty wound.

977
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:33,471
But my magic will do the trick.
You'll see, my dear.

978
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,806
This remedy...

979
01:31:36,014 --> 01:31:37,947
...is older than time. Yes...

980
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:40,448
...my dear, older than time.

981
01:31:40,652 --> 01:31:44,110
It was handed down
from father to son...

982
01:31:44,323 --> 01:31:48,587
...father to son, and comes from...

983
01:31:50,694 --> 01:31:52,992
...who can say where?

984
01:31:55,932 --> 01:31:59,595
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

985
01:31:59,802 --> 01:32:01,929
For your kindness.
I'll always remember it.

986
01:32:02,137 --> 01:32:03,434
Well....

987
01:32:04,241 --> 01:32:05,674
Well....

988
01:32:06,877 --> 01:32:08,344
Always.

989
01:32:08,544 --> 01:32:11,137
Yes, always, my dear.

990
01:32:13,549 --> 01:32:16,575
But who knows how long
that will be.

991
01:32:45,044 --> 01:32:47,637
An hour this side of midnight.

992
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:50,314
Dark and heavy it is too.

993
01:32:50,548 --> 01:32:53,348
Good night for business, this.

994
01:32:53,552 --> 01:32:56,783
What a pity, Bill, my dear,
there's none quite ready to be done.

995
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:58,650
Yeah, for once, you're right.

996
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:01,559
When will the boy be well enough
to go on his travels?

997
01:33:01,762 --> 01:33:06,221
-Like I say, Bill. In a day or two.
-It's a pity.

998
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:09,764
-For I'm in the humor to.
-Does me good to hear you.

999
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:13,403
You're like yourself tonight, Bill.
Quite like yourself.

1000
01:33:13,606 --> 01:33:16,871
I don't feel like myself when you lay
that withered claw on my shoulder...

1001
01:33:17,076 --> 01:33:19,236
...so take it away.

1002
01:33:27,785 --> 01:33:29,719
Hello, Nance.

1003
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:32,013
Where's the girl going to
this time of night?

1004
01:33:32,422 --> 01:33:34,890
-Not far.
-What answer's that?

1005
01:33:35,091 --> 01:33:37,822
-Where you going?
-I say, not far.

1006
01:33:38,028 --> 01:33:40,326
-And I say, where?
-I don't know where.

1007
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:43,523
Then I do, nowhere. Sit down.

1008
01:33:43,733 --> 01:33:47,294
-I'm not well. I want a breath of air.
-Put your head out the window.

1009
01:33:47,503 --> 01:33:50,631
There's not enough there.
I want it in the street.

1010
01:33:54,309 --> 01:33:56,834
Then you won't have it.

1011
01:34:02,117 --> 01:34:06,577
There. Now, stop quietly
where you are, will you?

1012
01:34:11,893 --> 01:34:13,416
Do you know what you're doing?

1013
01:34:14,695 --> 01:34:16,719
Do I know what I'm--?

1014
01:34:16,931 --> 01:34:19,956
I think this girl's lost her senses.
You talking to me in that way?

1015
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:22,191
You'll drive me on
to something desperate.

1016
01:34:22,402 --> 01:34:24,871
Now, let me go, will you?
This minute, this instant.

1017
01:34:25,071 --> 01:34:27,403
-No!
-Tell him to let me go, Fagin.

1018
01:34:28,074 --> 01:34:31,372
It'll be better for him.
Do you hear me?

1019
01:34:32,912 --> 01:34:36,005
Aye, I hear you.

1020
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:40,151
And if I have to listen to you
for half a minute longer...

1021
01:34:40,352 --> 01:34:44,118
...the dog will tear some
of that screaming voice out!

1022
01:34:44,456 --> 01:34:47,254
What's come over you, you jade?
What is it?

1023
01:34:47,459 --> 01:34:49,325
Bill, let me go.

1024
01:34:49,863 --> 01:34:53,764
Let me go.
You don't know what you're doing.

1025
01:34:53,967 --> 01:34:55,194
For only one hour.

1026
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:59,201
Cut my limbs off one by one if I don't
think the girl's stark raving mad.

1027
01:34:59,404 --> 01:35:03,135
-Get up. Get up!
-No.

1028
01:35:10,147 --> 01:35:11,341
Now, stay there!

1029
01:35:14,285 --> 01:35:15,946
What a precious, strange girl that is.

1030
01:35:16,154 --> 01:35:18,179
You may say that, Bill,
you may say that.

1031
01:35:18,389 --> 01:35:20,618
Why did she take it in her head
to go out tonight?

1032
01:35:21,124 --> 01:35:23,921
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy,
I suppose, my dear.

1033
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:27,423
I thought I tamed her of that.
But she's as bad as ever.

1034
01:35:30,033 --> 01:35:33,229
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood and it won't come out.

1035
01:35:33,436 --> 01:35:34,925
Like enough.

1036
01:35:35,137 --> 01:35:38,129
Well, if she's taken that way again,
I'll let her a little blood.

1037
01:35:38,340 --> 01:35:41,308
Without troubling the doctor.

1038
01:35:56,825 --> 01:35:59,622
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1039
01:36:00,994 --> 01:36:02,394
Good night.

1040
01:36:02,596 --> 01:36:07,089
In two days, Bill,
come for the boy.

1041
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:11,094
Light him down.

1042
01:36:11,304 --> 01:36:15,104
It's a pity he should fall and break
his neck without anyone seeing it.

1043
01:36:17,243 --> 01:36:18,609
Show him a light.

1044
01:36:27,988 --> 01:36:31,683
What is it, Nancy dear,
the reason for all this?

1045
01:36:31,891 --> 01:36:34,120
-What do you mean?
-That matter just now.

1046
01:36:34,326 --> 01:36:36,350
We'll speak of this anon.

1047
01:36:36,562 --> 01:36:38,620
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1048
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:41,025
A staunch friend.
You know me of old, Nance.

1049
01:36:41,565 --> 01:36:44,329
I know you well. Good night.

1050
01:36:49,774 --> 01:36:51,172
Dodge...

1051
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:53,240
...pull it in.

1052
01:36:56,446 --> 01:36:59,507
My glass is full already,
can't you see?

1053
01:37:05,655 --> 01:37:07,383
Trouble?

1054
01:37:10,961 --> 01:37:12,756
Dodger.

1055
01:37:15,931 --> 01:37:18,628
-Let's find out where old Tom is, eh?
-He's in the Ten Bells.

1056
01:37:18,834 --> 01:37:21,325
Shall we both take him home?

1057
01:37:21,803 --> 01:37:23,235
Honestly...

1058
01:37:23,438 --> 01:37:26,065
...I haven't seen her.

1059
01:37:27,276 --> 01:37:29,005
Something up?

1060
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:33,209
I....

1061
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:40,617
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

1062
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:43,413
What is it?
I ain't going near no police office.

1063
01:37:43,623 --> 01:37:47,150
-That don't suit me, that don't.
-There's not the smallest danger in it.

1064
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:50,453
Not the smallest.
I want someone dodged.

1065
01:37:50,663 --> 01:37:53,188
-Who, an old one?
-Young one.

1066
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:54,660
-Who is she?
-One of us.

1067
01:37:54,868 --> 01:37:56,335
Who?

1068
01:37:56,536 --> 01:37:58,470
Nancy?

1069
01:37:59,973 --> 01:38:02,737
-What's she been up to?
-Not sure she's been up to anything...

1070
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:06,241
...my dear, that's why
I want her dodged.

1071
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:11,081
She may want to talk to people
she shouldn't want to talk to.

1072
01:38:11,283 --> 01:38:16,243
I want to know where she goes,
who she sees, what she says.

1073
01:38:18,623 --> 01:38:20,387
Nancy.

1074
01:38:20,593 --> 01:38:23,221
I don't know. She's a good one,
is Nancy.

1075
01:38:23,428 --> 01:38:27,921
A pound, my dear.
One whole pound.

1076
01:39:08,204 --> 01:39:10,171
Mr. Brownlow?

1077
01:39:12,072 --> 01:39:13,768
Yes.

1078
01:39:16,977 --> 01:39:20,071
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away. Follow me.

1079
01:39:34,628 --> 01:39:36,562
This is far enough.

1080
01:39:36,763 --> 01:39:39,755
-Why can't we speak up there?
-I told you, I'm afraid.

1081
01:39:39,967 --> 01:39:42,093
I may be followed.

1082
01:39:46,839 --> 01:39:48,170
I'm here because you told...

1083
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:51,137
...my housekeeper you have
information concerning Oliver Twist.

1084
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:53,539
-So I have.
-Tell me.

1085
01:39:55,214 --> 01:39:56,841
He's being held by the devil...

1086
01:39:57,049 --> 01:40:01,543
...and he's handing him over
to another what means to....

1087
01:40:01,754 --> 01:40:04,187
I must know more.
Is it someone close to you?

1088
01:40:05,223 --> 01:40:08,555
-One is. One ain't.
-These men, whoever they are...

1089
01:40:08,759 --> 01:40:11,320
-...must be delivered up by you.
-Never.

1090
01:40:11,529 --> 01:40:16,626
Bad a life as he has led, I've led a bad
life too, and I will not turn upon him.

1091
01:40:17,234 --> 01:40:19,065
The other.

1092
01:40:19,804 --> 01:40:22,968
-Fagin. He has the boy.
-Fagin.

1093
01:40:23,174 --> 01:40:24,572
Find Fagin, you'll find the boy.

1094
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:27,174
-Where is he?
-Spitalfields.

1095
01:40:27,377 --> 01:40:30,437
That's all I'll say.
I've said too much.

1096
01:40:30,847 --> 01:40:32,747
No one must never know
who told you.

1097
01:40:32,948 --> 01:40:35,416
-Promise.
-I promise.

1098
01:40:35,617 --> 01:40:39,747
-Tomorrow I'll go to the police.
-No, you must do it tonight.

1099
01:40:39,954 --> 01:40:41,946
Just say Fagin,
and the traps will know.

1100
01:40:42,157 --> 01:40:45,183
-The traps?
-The police.

1101
01:40:45,394 --> 01:40:48,659
-What can I do to serve you?
-Nothing.

1102
01:40:48,864 --> 01:40:52,162
You can do nothing.
I am past all hope indeed.

1103
01:40:52,368 --> 01:40:54,426
Take this as a reward.

1104
01:40:54,635 --> 01:40:58,001
No, I've not done this for money.

1105
01:40:58,206 --> 01:40:59,605
God bless you.

1106
01:40:59,806 --> 01:41:02,867
Good night. Good night.

1107
01:41:03,076 --> 01:41:06,012
Never-- Never say who told you.

1108
01:41:17,924 --> 01:41:19,118
Look at him.

1109
01:41:20,926 --> 01:41:22,791
What a shame it is. With his face...

1110
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:25,190
...he could pick old ladies' pockets
in church.

1111
01:41:25,398 --> 01:41:28,801
His face could be a fortune to us.

1112
01:41:29,469 --> 01:41:31,493
You changing your mind?

1113
01:41:31,705 --> 01:41:33,297
No.

1114
01:41:33,907 --> 01:41:36,034
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1115
01:41:36,242 --> 01:41:38,142
Fagin! Fagin.

1116
01:41:43,549 --> 01:41:46,813
-What's got into you, Dodger?
-I have to see Fagin alone.

1117
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:48,712
No, no, you can speak
in front of Bill.

1118
01:41:48,921 --> 01:41:52,356
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

1119
01:41:52,557 --> 01:41:54,683
-Nancy.
-What about Nancy?

1120
01:41:54,893 --> 01:41:57,726
He done a bit of work for me, Bill.
I had him dodge Nancy.

1121
01:41:57,928 --> 01:41:59,519
What do you mean?

1122
01:41:59,731 --> 01:42:01,789
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1123
01:42:01,999 --> 01:42:04,159
Yes. To London Bridge.

1124
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:06,733
And what?
What on London Bridge?

1125
01:42:07,069 --> 01:42:09,094
She met an old one. A gentleman.

1126
01:42:09,305 --> 01:42:11,034
-And....
-And?

1127
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:13,332
Speak, will you?!

1128
01:42:14,177 --> 01:42:17,112
She peached.
She told him Fagin had Oliver.

1129
01:42:17,313 --> 01:42:21,340
And the old man was
to go to the traps. Now, tonight.

1130
01:42:27,389 --> 01:42:29,414
-Let me go. Let me out!
-Bill! Bill! A word--

1131
01:42:29,623 --> 01:42:33,821
-Don't speak to me, it's not safe!
-Hear me speak a word!

1132
01:42:34,161 --> 01:42:36,288
Bill, you won't be....

1133
01:42:37,264 --> 01:42:39,460
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1134
01:42:52,313 --> 01:42:53,678
Flit, boys, flit!

1135
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:56,679
The traps will be at the door
afore you can say "Spitalfields."

1136
01:42:56,884 --> 01:42:58,043
Flit! Flit! Flit!

1137
01:42:58,252 --> 01:42:59,809
Flit!

1138
01:43:00,254 --> 01:43:01,983
Flit!

1139
01:43:02,223 --> 01:43:03,883
Flit!

1140
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:05,853
Flit!

1141
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:08,688
Flit!

1142
01:43:11,130 --> 01:43:12,791
Flit!

1143
01:43:40,057 --> 01:43:41,580
Come on.

1144
01:44:07,248 --> 01:44:09,443
Oh, it's you.

1145
01:44:12,923 --> 01:44:14,514
Bill?

1146
01:44:14,722 --> 01:44:16,622
What's the matter?

1147
01:44:24,831 --> 01:44:27,459
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

1148
01:44:29,169 --> 01:44:31,228
There's enough light
for what I've gotta do.

1149
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:33,929
What--? What have I done?

1150
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:37,544
-Speak to me.
-You know.

1151
01:44:37,745 --> 01:44:40,144
You was watched tonight.

1152
01:44:40,547 --> 01:44:43,243
Every word you said was heard.

1153
01:44:45,419 --> 01:44:47,944
I-- I never said your name, Bill.

1154
01:44:48,154 --> 01:44:49,417
Never.

1155
01:44:49,623 --> 01:44:50,816
Never.

1156
01:44:51,023 --> 01:44:53,048
Bill. Bill. Bill!

1157
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,091
Oh, God.
Oh, God, have mercy!

1158
01:45:21,851 --> 01:45:23,753
Nance?

1159
01:45:28,425 --> 01:45:30,222
Nance?

1160
01:45:51,813 --> 01:45:53,838
I haven't done nothing.

1161
01:45:54,049 --> 01:45:56,279
Go on, be off with you.

1162
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:21,174
Hello, Fagey.

1163
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,604
Hello, lads.

1164
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:27,511
What's the news, Toby?
What's the news?

1165
01:46:27,713 --> 01:46:30,774
I have it here, Fagin.
It's all in The Chronicle.

1166
01:46:30,983 --> 01:46:34,351
You're in it. Bill's in it.
Oliver's in it.

1167
01:46:34,555 --> 01:46:35,749
The Chronicle?

1168
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:39,489
Fancy that. You're famous, Fagin.

1169
01:46:39,692 --> 01:46:40,716
Read it.

1170
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:43,157
"More information has reached
your correspondent...

1171
01:46:43,362 --> 01:46:46,194
...concerning the foul
and bestial murder...

1172
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,799
...that took place in Spitalfields and
which has shocked and appalled...

1173
01:46:50,001 --> 01:46:51,195
...the citizens of London.

1174
01:46:52,904 --> 01:46:55,998
It is believed that the victim,
a young woman...

1175
01:46:56,207 --> 01:46:58,301
...now identified as Nancy...

1176
01:46:58,510 --> 01:47:01,273
...was brutally beaten to death...

1177
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,113
...by one William Sykes...

1178
01:47:04,314 --> 01:47:07,249
...a well-known, dangerous villain.

1179
01:47:07,451 --> 01:47:09,510
The motive is as yet unclear...

1180
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,517
...but your correspondent has learned
that the murdered woman...

1181
01:47:12,723 --> 01:47:14,554
...had informed on her associate...

1182
01:47:14,757 --> 01:47:17,727
...and on an infamous fence, Fagin...

1183
01:47:18,694 --> 01:47:23,962
...who is now wanted for the abduction
of a young boy, Oliver Twist.

1184
01:47:25,534 --> 01:47:28,661
Neither Fagin nor Sykes
are presently in custody...

1185
01:47:28,871 --> 01:47:31,499
...but the police are engaged
in searching for them...

1186
01:47:31,707 --> 01:47:34,039
...throughout the city and beyond.

1187
01:47:35,209 --> 01:47:37,234
Sykes, according to the police...

1188
01:47:37,445 --> 01:47:42,279
...is usually accompanied
by a fierce white dog."

1189
01:47:45,018 --> 01:47:46,280
How about that, eh?

1190
01:47:59,032 --> 01:48:02,024
Come. Come back here.

1191
01:48:05,205 --> 01:48:06,969
We're going back to London.

1192
01:48:09,110 --> 01:48:11,099
I'll have people to speak to.

1193
01:48:11,311 --> 01:48:15,042
I'll force shiners out of Fagin,
get to France.

1194
01:48:15,248 --> 01:48:16,272
Damn me, we'll risk it.

1195
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:23,220
Who's he done in?

1196
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:27,822
-They say-- They say it's a woman.
-He's done in a woman?

1197
01:48:54,251 --> 01:48:56,185
Bullseye.

1198
01:48:57,353 --> 01:48:59,878
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1199
01:49:00,390 --> 01:49:02,790
You gone deaf or something?

1200
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:05,685
Come here. Come on.

1201
01:49:07,563 --> 01:49:10,464
I ain't gonna harm you. Come on.
Come on, Bullseye.

1202
01:49:11,466 --> 01:49:13,592
Come here.

1203
01:49:13,802 --> 01:49:16,736
Stop it! I'm warning you.

1204
01:49:16,938 --> 01:49:18,907
Let go, I ain't playing with you!

1205
01:49:19,107 --> 01:49:21,734
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1206
01:49:21,943 --> 01:49:23,843
Bullseye!

1207
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:31,213
Bullseye. Bullseye.

1208
01:49:31,653 --> 01:49:33,882
Get back here. Get back here.

1209
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:37,851
Damn it!

1210
01:49:43,263 --> 01:49:44,925
Look, it's his dog.

1211
01:49:45,132 --> 01:49:47,396
It's his dog!

1212
01:49:52,172 --> 01:49:53,537
Here, boy.

1213
01:49:53,739 --> 01:49:55,708
-Here.
-Don't go near him.

1214
01:50:01,981 --> 01:50:04,677
There is a child in danger,
lnspector Blathers...

1215
01:50:04,884 --> 01:50:06,375
...but you only seem interested...

1216
01:50:06,586 --> 01:50:08,611
...in apprehending this man,
William Sykes.

1217
01:50:08,821 --> 01:50:10,413
Your concern should be...

1218
01:50:10,623 --> 01:50:12,818
-...for the safety of the boy.
-Allow me to say...

1219
01:50:13,024 --> 01:50:15,584
...this is our usual way
of doing business.

1220
01:50:16,761 --> 01:50:18,523
My thinking is this:

1221
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:21,460
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1222
01:50:21,665 --> 01:50:23,361
-And if we get Fagin--
-Look.

1223
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:27,192
Sir, we found the dog.

1224
01:50:29,339 --> 01:50:31,968
Are we going to sit here
waiting for the traps to find us?

1225
01:50:32,175 --> 01:50:35,269
-Shut it.
-No, he's right.

1226
01:50:35,479 --> 01:50:37,878
We should do another flit.

1227
01:50:40,517 --> 01:50:42,484
The traps!

1228
01:50:58,033 --> 01:50:59,295
What?

1229
01:50:59,734 --> 01:51:00,928
It's him.

1230
01:51:01,871 --> 01:51:03,804
-Don't let him in.
-We must.

1231
01:51:05,839 --> 01:51:07,568
Go on.

1232
01:51:09,711 --> 01:51:11,576
Go on!

1233
01:51:17,852 --> 01:51:20,343
Don't leave us in the dark.

1234
01:52:16,506 --> 01:52:18,633
Damn you all.

1235
01:52:19,275 --> 01:52:21,869
Have you nothing to say to me?

1236
01:52:22,244 --> 01:52:27,046
-Not safe for you to stop here, Bill.
-lf it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1237
01:52:31,254 --> 01:52:32,720
Is it...?

1238
01:52:33,889 --> 01:52:35,413
The body, is it buried?

1239
01:52:43,764 --> 01:52:46,426
Dodger, let him in quick.

1240
01:52:48,737 --> 01:52:49,705
Dodger.

1241
01:52:50,939 --> 01:52:52,567
Do as I say.

1242
01:52:56,544 --> 01:52:58,774
Don't come near me, you monster.

1243
01:53:02,616 --> 01:53:04,743
You're my witnesses.
I'm not afraid of him.

1244
01:53:06,185 --> 01:53:08,620
And if they come here after him,
I'll give him up.

1245
01:53:08,822 --> 01:53:10,448
I'll tell them you're here.

1246
01:53:11,724 --> 01:53:15,092
He may kill me if he likes,
but if I'm here, I'll give him up.

1247
01:53:15,295 --> 01:53:17,889
If he was to be boiled alive,
so I would.

1248
01:53:18,097 --> 01:53:20,328
Why, you little--

1249
01:53:21,333 --> 01:53:22,824
Get off me!

1250
01:53:23,035 --> 01:53:24,799
Or I'll tear you limb from limb!

1251
01:53:30,942 --> 01:53:32,205
Help, he's here!

1252
01:53:32,410 --> 01:53:34,640
-He's here. Break down the door!
-Up at the window!

1253
01:53:34,846 --> 01:53:36,872
Help! Come up, please!

1254
01:53:39,150 --> 01:53:41,345
-That's Bill Sykes!
-Damn you all!

1255
01:53:41,553 --> 01:53:43,578
Do your worst. I'll cheat you yet!

1256
01:53:55,065 --> 01:53:58,261
No! Bill, no.
He's our bargaining tool.

1257
01:53:58,469 --> 01:54:01,495
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1258
01:54:03,906 --> 01:54:05,464
Bill!

1259
01:54:16,685 --> 01:54:18,117
Don't fire.

1260
01:54:19,687 --> 01:54:21,622
-Don't fire.
-Hold your fire, men.

1261
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:24,019
-Hold your fire.
-I'll let the boy go.

1262
01:54:24,226 --> 01:54:26,252
I'll let him drop.

1263
01:54:26,462 --> 01:54:28,929
Don't try nothing,
or I'll let him go!

1264
01:54:32,767 --> 01:54:34,667
Get up there.

1265
01:54:35,103 --> 01:54:37,162
Cross, cross.

1266
01:54:40,407 --> 01:54:44,069
Up there. Up there.

1267
01:54:48,015 --> 01:54:51,644
Grab hold of there.
Grab hold of it.

1268
01:55:00,859 --> 01:55:03,054
We must give chase, sir.

1269
01:55:14,506 --> 01:55:16,166
Get down.

1270
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:21,978
They're getting away!

1271
01:55:22,181 --> 01:55:24,239
There, there. There he is!

1272
01:55:25,283 --> 01:55:26,544
Get him! Get him!

1273
01:55:26,751 --> 01:55:28,480
Damn it!

1274
01:56:01,817 --> 01:56:03,306
Grab it.

1275
01:56:03,518 --> 01:56:05,316
Grab it!

1276
01:57:25,229 --> 01:57:27,320
Oliver?

1277
01:57:27,530 --> 01:57:29,224
Oliver!

1278
01:57:31,768 --> 01:57:33,828
Oliver!

1279
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,507
-Here he is, sir.
-Come along, my boy.

1280
01:57:41,711 --> 01:57:45,510
Mr. Grimwig has something
to say to you.

1281
01:57:46,749 --> 01:57:48,215
Do the honors, Mrs. Bedwin.

1282
01:57:48,417 --> 01:57:53,218
Now then, young man,
I confess I misjudged you.

1283
01:57:53,422 --> 01:57:57,380
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor
would make me eat my head.

1284
01:57:58,527 --> 01:58:01,689
But he's a good friend
and has pardoned me.

1285
01:58:01,897 --> 01:58:04,456
-And one for Oliver.
-Thank you, sir.

1286
01:58:04,665 --> 01:58:06,327
-So--
-And you too, Mrs. Bedwin.

1287
01:58:06,534 --> 01:58:08,365
-I don't know as I should, sir.
-You must.

1288
01:58:08,568 --> 01:58:13,301
So I'll take the liberty,
if you'll allow me, to salute you.

1289
01:58:14,107 --> 01:58:17,008
-To Sam Waters.
-Oliver Twist.

1290
01:58:17,377 --> 01:58:20,541
Oliver Twist. To Oliver Twist.

1291
01:58:21,314 --> 01:58:23,077
Yes.

1292
01:58:25,585 --> 01:58:29,988
Why, Oliver.
My child, what's the matter?

1293
01:58:30,589 --> 01:58:32,420
Why are you so sad?

1294
01:58:59,648 --> 01:59:02,345
Are you certain, Oliver,
you wish to go through with this?

1295
01:59:02,551 --> 01:59:04,247
Yes, sir.

1296
01:59:04,454 --> 01:59:06,319
Certain.

1297
01:59:12,294 --> 01:59:14,159
Yes?

1298
01:59:59,440 --> 02:00:02,499
Is the young gentleman
to come too, sir?

1299
02:00:02,742 --> 02:00:05,176
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1300
02:00:05,378 --> 02:00:08,677
It is not indeed, my friend.
But this child has seen this man...

1301
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:11,144
...in the full career
of his success and villainy.

1302
02:00:11,349 --> 02:00:14,375
And it is his wish, even at the cost
of some pain and fear...

1303
02:00:14,586 --> 02:00:16,952
...that he should see him now.

1304
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:51,315
Eighteen.

1305
02:01:06,470 --> 02:01:08,232
Hey!

1306
02:01:12,474 --> 02:01:13,735
Good boy.

1307
02:01:13,943 --> 02:01:15,773
Good boy, Charley.

1308
02:01:15,977 --> 02:01:17,969
Well done.

1309
02:01:25,521 --> 02:01:28,717
Good boy, Charley, well done.
Well done.

1310
02:01:29,057 --> 02:01:31,490
-Take the boy away to bed.
-Don't be frightened.

1311
02:01:31,692 --> 02:01:33,387
Fagin.

1312
02:01:33,661 --> 02:01:35,458
That's me. An old man, my lord.

1313
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:38,256
A-- A very old-- Old man.

1314
02:01:38,865 --> 02:01:40,331
Someone here wants to see you.

1315
02:01:40,767 --> 02:01:42,427
-Strike! Strike them all dead!
-Easy.

1316
02:01:42,636 --> 02:01:44,569
What right have they to butcher me?

1317
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:46,829
Speak to him now.
Quick, if you please.

1318
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:49,008
For he grows worse
as the time goes on.

1319
02:01:51,211 --> 02:01:53,839
Fagin, you were kind to me.

1320
02:01:54,046 --> 02:01:55,411
Yes, yes.

1321
02:01:55,614 --> 02:01:57,275
I'll be kind again.

1322
02:01:57,483 --> 02:01:59,508
I'll be kind again.

1323
02:01:59,717 --> 02:02:02,117
I'll be kind again.

1324
02:02:07,357 --> 02:02:10,190
-I'm not afraid.
-Oliver!

1325
02:02:14,765 --> 02:02:18,201
Let-- Let me whisper to you.

1326
02:02:20,437 --> 02:02:23,133
You remember the box, Oliver?

1327
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:26,433
With my pretty things
for my old age, Oliver?

1328
02:02:26,642 --> 02:02:29,805
It's hid a little way up the chimney
in the top front room.

1329
02:02:30,012 --> 02:02:32,207
It's yours, Oliver.

1330
02:02:32,415 --> 02:02:35,473
-Yours, but we must talk.
-Yes, yes.

1331
02:02:35,685 --> 02:02:38,211
But shall we say a prayer
together first?

1332
02:02:38,421 --> 02:02:39,615
Do.

1333
02:02:39,823 --> 02:02:43,383
Say only one, upon your knees,
with me...

1334
02:02:43,593 --> 02:02:46,255
...and we can talk all morning.

1335
02:02:46,862 --> 02:02:48,454
Outside. Outside.

1336
02:02:48,665 --> 02:02:51,427
You can say I've gone to sleep.
They'll believe you.

1337
02:02:51,634 --> 02:02:55,729
You can get me out. The pretty
things are yours, my dear, yours.

1338
02:02:55,938 --> 02:03:00,068
-Oh, God, forgive this wretched man.
-That's right, that's right.

1339
02:03:00,276 --> 02:03:01,470
That will help us on.

1340
02:03:01,677 --> 02:03:05,772
If-- lf-- lf-- If l...

1341
02:03:05,981 --> 02:03:10,441
...shake and tremble as we pass
the gallows, don't-- Don't--

1342
02:03:10,851 --> 02:03:14,617
Don't you mind, hurry on.
Now, now, now.

1343
02:03:14,822 --> 02:03:17,484
-Have you more to say to him, sir?
-Nothing more.

1344
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:20,591
-You'd better leave him.
-Press on, press on, press on.

1345
02:03:20,793 --> 02:03:22,818
Press on, press on.

1346
02:03:23,030 --> 02:03:25,521
Softly. Softly. No, no!

1347
02:03:25,733 --> 02:03:27,064
It hurts!

1348
02:03:27,267 --> 02:03:29,291
Faster, faster!

1349
02:03:29,502 --> 02:03:31,436
Faster, faster!

1350
02:03:31,639 --> 02:03:35,539
Faster, faster, faster, faster!

1351
02:05:08,534 --> 02:05:12,458
THE END
