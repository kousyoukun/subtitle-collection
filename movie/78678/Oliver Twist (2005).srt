1
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,268
Bow to the board.

2
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,271
This is the boy.

3
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:11,567
Born here in the workhouse.
Moved to the parish farm.

4
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,445
Nine years old today.
Time to be moved back here.

5
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:16,947
What's your name, boy?

6
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,162
Oliver Twist.
What?

7
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,916
That boy's a fool.
Boy. Listen to me.

8
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,544
You know you are an orphan,
I suppose.

9
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,130
What's that?
The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

10
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,507
You know you've got
no father or mother...

11
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,385
and that you were brought up
by the parish, don't you?

12
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,138
Yes, sir.
What are you crying for?

13
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:44,141
I hope you say your prayers
every night.

14
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:48,103
Pray for those that feed you
and take care of you...

15
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,479
Iike a Christian.

16
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,607
Yes, sir.
Well...

17
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,692
you have come here
to be educated...

18
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,236
and to be taught a useful trade.

19
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,502
Here, where do you want these?

20
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:30,103
Learn from the boy next to you.

21
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:34,441
What am I to learn, sir?
Learn to pick out the oakum.

22
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,984
What's oakum, sir?

23
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,737
Stop asking so many questions.

24
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,282
Oakum's the fibers you unpick
from the old rope.

25
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:46,662
Then it's used again
for the ships of Her Majesty's navy.

26
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,039
You're serving your country.

27
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,833
Now, get on with it.

28
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:28,245
Tom, give it a rest, will you?
We're trying to sleep.

29
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:34,418
Can't sleep, too hungry.
We're all hungry.

30
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,087
Yes, but I'm frightened.

31
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,881
Frightened? Why?

32
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
Why? Why?

33
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,221
I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might
eat the lad that sleeps next to me.

34
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,342
O Lord God...

35
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,553
for the blessing of this generous
and bountiful meal...

36
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,847
that thou hast placed before us...

37
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,767
we give thanks. Amen.

38
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,353
Amen.

39
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,311
Please, sir. I want some more.

40
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,273
What?

41
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,942
Please, sir, I want some more.

42
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,372
Fetch the beadle!

43
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,674
Mr. Limbkins.

44
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,511
I beg your pardon, sir.

45
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,138
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

46
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,016
For more?!

47
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,936
Compose yourself, Mr. Bumble,
and answer me distinctly.

48
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:43,732
Do I understand that he asked for
more after he had eaten his supper?

49
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,192
He did, sir.

50
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:51,156
That boy will be hanged.

51
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,213
"Five pounds and a b--"

52
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,679
When I says "whoa,"
I means "whoa"!

53
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,766
"Health-- Healthy...

54
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,395
appren-- apprentice.

55
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,856
Five pounds."

56
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,401
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

57
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,947
Young boys have been smothered
in chimneys before now.

58
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,367
That's because they damp the straw
afore they light it in the chimney...

59
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:39,371
to make them come out again.
Damp straw makes smoke.

60
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,708
Smoke sends a boy to sleep,
and that's what he wants.

61
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,918
Boys is very lazy, gentlemen.

62
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:48,589
But there's nothing like a good hot
blaze to make them come out in a run.

63
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,800
It's humane too. Yes.

64
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:55,053
Because even if they've
stuck in the chimney...

65
00:09:55,262 --> 00:10:00,350
roasting their feet makes them
struggle to extricate theirselves.

66
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:01,894
Yes.

67
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,979
I suppose he's fond of
chimney sweeping?

68
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:06,398
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

69
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,359
Very well. I will sign the indentures...

70
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,530
to make him Mr....

71
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,784
Mr. Gamfield's apprentice.

72
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,295
My boy.

73
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:34,259
My boy, you look pale and alarmed.

74
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,594
What's the matter?

75
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,097
Please, sir. Please, sir.

76
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,350
What is it, my boy?

77
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,310
Don't....
Now then.

78
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,646
Don't.... Don't....

79
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,732
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

80
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:52,069
Please don't send me away
with this dreadful man, sir.

81
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,280
Of all the designing orphans
that I've ever seen....

82
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,200
Hold your tongue, beadle.
Did Your Worship speak to me?

83
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,953
Yes, hold your tongue.

84
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,165
No. No, out of the question.

85
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:09,294
We refuse to sanction
these indentures.

86
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,965
Take the boy away.

87
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,676
And treat him kindly.

88
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,512
He seems to want it.

89
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:38,657
I've just taken the measure of
the two women that died last night.

90
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,702
You'll make your fortune,
Mr. Sowerberry.

91
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,204
Think so?

92
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,542
The prices allowed by the board
are very small.

93
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,003
So are the coffins.

94
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:57,301
By the by, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

95
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:03,098
Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry.
Liberal terms.

96
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:15,527
Now, as you are to meet
your new master...

97
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,738
pull that cap off your eyes.

98
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,117
Hold your head up, sir.

99
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,121
Dry your eyes, sir.

100
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:36,215
ls that you, Bumble?
No one else, Mr. Sowerberry.

101
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:39,551
I've brought the orphan,
Oliver Twist.

102
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,387
So this is the orphan, is it?

103
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,056
Mrs. Sowerberry...

104
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,392
will you have the goodness
to come here a moment, my dear?

105
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,187
Oliver Twist.

106
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,689
How comes an orphan
to have any name at all?

107
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:55,317
I invented it.
You, Mr. Bumble?

108
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,110
I, Mr. Sowerberry.

109
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,739
I name all our foundlings
in alphabetical order.

110
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,658
The last was S.

111
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,660
Swubble, I named him.

112
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,622
This was a T. Twist,
I named him.

113
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:11,416
Next one as comes
will be Unwin...

114
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,335
and the next, Vilkins.

115
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:17,297
I've got names ready
all through the alphabet, right up to Z.

116
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,884
Why, you're quite
a literary character, sir.

117
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,302
Well, well...

118
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:25,514
perhaps I may be.
Mrs. Sowerberry...

119
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,308
this is the orphan
from the workhouse.

120
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,020
Dear me, he's very small.

121
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:34,189
But he'll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry.
He'll grow.

122
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:38,902
Yes, I daresay he will.
On our food and drink.

123
00:13:39,111 --> 00:13:43,866
Workhouse boys always cost more
to keep than they're worth.

124
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:47,369
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

125
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,663
Here, Charlotte...

126
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,542
give this boy some of the cold bits
that were put by for the dog.

127
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:24,656
You don't mind sleeping
among the coffins, I suppose.

128
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,284
Well, it doesn't much matter
whether you do or don't...

129
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:29,953
for you can't sleep anywhere else.

130
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,868
Open the door, will you?

131
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:03,839
You the new boy?
Yes, sir.

132
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:07,176
How old are you?
Ten, sir.

133
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:11,513
Then I'll whop you one when I get in,
you workhouse brat.

134
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,657
I beg your pardon, sir.
Did you knock?

135
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,034
I kicked.

136
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,703
Did you want a coffin, sir?

137
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,623
You don't know who I am, I suppose.
No, sir.

138
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:41,251
Well, I'm Mr. Noah Claypole.
And you're under me.

139
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,004
Now, take down the shutters.

140
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,013
Saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

141
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,771
In the corner with you.
And be quick about it.

142
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:04,149
They'll want you to mind the shop.
Do you hear?

143
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,151
Do you hear, Workhouse?
In the corner.

144
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,779
Oh, Lord, Noah, let the boy alone.

145
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,739
Let him alone?

146
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:12,908
Why, everybody's let him alone.

147
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:17,621
His mother, father and all
his relations has let him alone.

148
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,415
So he needs someone who don't.

149
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,813
Supper.

150
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,983
Oliver, ain't you done yet?

151
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:51,363
I've never known such an idle boy.
Get down them stairs.

152
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,906
Mr. Sowerberry...

153
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,825
supper.

154
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,203
I've had a thought, my dear.
Had a thought?

155
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,248
You want to be careful,
Mr. Sowerberry, you'll get brain fever.

156
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,960
It's about young Twist.
What about him?

157
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,714
A very good-looking boy.
He will be. He eats enough.

158
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,468
There's an expression of melancholy
in his face, my dear.

159
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,222
He would make a delightful mute,
my love.

160
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:23,604
I-- I don't mean a regular mute to
attend grown-up funerals, my dear...

161
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:27,608
but only for children's practice.

162
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,123
Look at him.

163
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,709
Look at him.

164
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,797
A workhouse boy and a sneak.
Look at him.

165
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,133
Mark my words, I'll see him hung.

166
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,969
Can't be too soon.

167
00:18:58,347 --> 00:19:01,808
Workhouse, how's your mother?

168
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,853
She's dead.

169
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,940
What'd she die of, Workhouse?

170
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,986
You gonna cry, Workhouse?

171
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,615
What set you off?
Not you.

172
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,663
Not me, eh?
No, not you.

173
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,332
And you better not say anything
about my mother.

174
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,503
Better not?

175
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,839
About your mother?

176
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:35,008
Well, I'm very sorry,
and I pity you very much.

177
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,844
But you must know, Workhouse...

178
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,221
your mother was
a regular right-down bad one.

179
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,352
What did you say?
A regular right-down bad one.

180
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,354
It's a good thing she died
when she did...

181
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,940
or she'd be hard laboring
or transported.

182
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,485
Or hung. Which is most likely,
isn't it, Workhouse?

183
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,323
Help, Mrs. Charlotte!

184
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:00,284
He'll murder me. Help!

185
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,912
Help. Get off!

186
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,207
For God's sake, help me!

187
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,502
My missus, he's murdering me!

188
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,172
Get off. Get off me now!
Get him, Charlotte.

189
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,008
Get him now. Go out with him.
Come on.

190
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,345
Workhouse devil.
I'll learn you!

191
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,348
You brat!
Get the door, Charlotte.

192
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:25,601
In with him. In.

193
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:36,737
Very violent indeed, sir.

194
00:20:37,738 --> 00:20:39,031
And the missus said...

195
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:41,867
if Mr. Bumble can spare the time...

196
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,745
then Mr. Bumble's to flog him...

197
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:46,788
because the master's out.

198
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,296
ln there.
Oliver?

199
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:56,381
Let me out of here!

200
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,301
Do you know this here voice, Oliver?
Yes.

201
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,094
Ain't you afraid of it, sir?

202
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,847
Ain't you trembling
while I speak, sir?

203
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:05,891
No!

204
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,689
He must be mad.
It's not madness, ma'am, it's meat.

205
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:14,733
Meat?
Meat, ma'am, meat.

206
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,151
You've overfed him.

207
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,196
If you'd kept this boy on gruel,
this would never have happened.

208
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,658
Dear, dear.
This comes of being liberal.

209
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,285
What's all this?

210
00:21:25,494 --> 00:21:28,121
Oliver Twist has turned violent,
Mr. Sowerberry.

211
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,041
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

212
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,422
Now then. Now then.

213
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,468
You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?
He called my mother names.

214
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:45,722
Well, and what if he did,
you little ungrateful wretch!

215
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,808
She deserved what he said
and worse.

216
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,226
She didn't!
She did!

217
00:21:49,434 --> 00:21:51,103
It's a lie!

218
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:59,528
Do something, Mr. Sowerberry.
He called me a liar.

219
00:22:00,946 --> 00:22:02,155
Do something!

220
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,613
I beg your pardon, miss...

221
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:32,950
but would you be so kind--?

222
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:35,869
Get off my land.

223
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:38,705
I don't want no beggars here.
Go on!

224
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:42,668
Get off! Or I'll put the dog on you!

225
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:27,045
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

226
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,215
Be careful, it's hot.

227
00:26:41,059 --> 00:26:44,229
Seeing you gave me such a turn.

228
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:48,859
My eyes ain't what they were.
But...

229
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,696
I just thought for a moment....

230
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:04,500
Why are you on the road at all,
a little mite like you?

231
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,420
Where are you headed?
London, ma'am.

232
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:10,797
London?

233
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:13,800
London.

234
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:18,013
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

235
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:43,807
Hello, my man.

236
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,811
And what's your game?

237
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,940
You're not from these parts?

238
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,485
Where you from, then?

239
00:28:57,196 --> 00:29:00,073
I've been walking. Seven days.

240
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:03,368
Seven days? Cor.

241
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:04,745
I expect you want grub?

242
00:29:05,787 --> 00:29:07,539
And you shall have it.

243
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:10,250
I'm at a low-water mark meself
just at the moment...

244
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,961
but I'll fork out and stump.

245
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,923
Come on, up with you, on your pins.

246
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:25,432
And these won't get out again?

247
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:27,643
Thank you very much.

248
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:29,645
Oh, by the by...

249
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:33,690
my name is Jack Dawkins,
better known as the Artful Dodger.

250
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:36,193
Oliver Twist.

251
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:40,322
Why are you known as
the Artful Dodger?

252
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,866
That's why.

253
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:52,292
Got any lodgings?

254
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,253
Money?

255
00:29:54,837 --> 00:29:58,298
I suppose you want someplace
to sleep tonight, don't you?

256
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:36,336
Baby newt.

257
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:39,798
Buy a baby newt, 4 pennies.

258
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:44,845
I expect you walking for so long
was a beak's order.

259
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,599
What does that mean?
Don't you know what a beak is?

260
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,768
A bird's mouth, isn't it?
Cor, you are green.

261
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:55,230
A beak's a magistrate, my son.
Where you been all your life?

262
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:57,065
Get off me, you!

263
00:30:57,274 --> 00:30:59,234
That's it, you asked for it.

264
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,408
Come back here.
I wanna talk to you.

265
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:08,994
Lucky heather.

266
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:28,305
from where I am, mate,
I'm telling you.

267
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,059
Go home!

268
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,567
Get off of that!

269
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:43,195
Go back home!

270
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,036
Now then.
Plummy and slam.

271
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:56,458
There's two of you. Who's he?
A new pal.

272
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,544
Where'd he come from?
Greenland.

273
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,339
ls the old one there?
Upstairs, sorting the wipes.

274
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:23,026
This is him, Fagin.
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

275
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:27,156
Well, well, Oliver Twist.

276
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:32,661
I hope I have the honor
of a more intimate acquaintance.

277
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,373
We're very glad to see you, Oliver.
Very.

278
00:32:36,582 --> 00:32:38,959
Dodger, take off the sausages...

279
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:44,006
and let's make a space
at the table for Oliver.

280
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,676
You were staring at the
pocket handkerchiefs, eh, my dear?

281
00:32:47,885 --> 00:32:49,845
There's a good many of them,
ain't there?

282
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,181
We've just looked them out,
ready for the wash.

283
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:54,266
That's all, my dear.

284
00:32:55,726 --> 00:32:57,436
Blow it.

285
00:32:59,188 --> 00:33:02,191
Hot. Blow it.

286
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,110
Now then, Oliver,
what you must have...

287
00:33:05,569 --> 00:33:08,864
is a hot gin and water.
Warms the cockles.

288
00:33:09,072 --> 00:33:12,868
Only, drink it quick because another
of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

289
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,975
He's such a nice lad.

290
00:33:37,184 --> 00:33:40,604
I have a feeling he'll turn out
a hard worker.

291
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:43,190
Yeah, a hard worker.

292
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,467
Oliver?

293
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,764
Oliver?

294
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,590
Clever dogs.

295
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,181
Clever dogs.

296
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:45,979
Fine fellows.

297
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:51,985
All fine fellows.

298
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:57,741
Fine fellows.

299
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:00,452
Fine fellows.

300
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,123
Fine fellows.

301
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:08,377
Fine fellows.

302
00:36:14,299 --> 00:36:16,301
What do you watch me for?
Why are you awake?

303
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,136
What have you seen?
Speak out, boy!

304
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,472
Quick. Quick, or it's your life!

305
00:36:20,681 --> 00:36:22,724
I wasn't able to sleep
any longer, sir.

306
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:24,434
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

307
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,520
You were not awake a moment ago?
No, sir.

308
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:28,856
You sure?
Yes, sir.

309
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:35,112
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I know that.

310
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:37,114
I only tried to frighten you.

311
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:40,200
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

312
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,663
Did you see any
of those pretty things, my dear?

313
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:46,540
Yes, sir.

314
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,625
They....

315
00:36:49,251 --> 00:36:52,087
They're mine, Oliver.
My little property.

316
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,548
For my old age.

317
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,967
It's our secret.

318
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:00,179
You understand, my dear?
Yes, sir.

319
00:37:01,263 --> 00:37:02,973
Can I go up now, sir?

320
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,228
Now....

321
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:50,979
I hope you've been at work
this morning, my dears.

322
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,397
Hard.
As nails.

323
00:37:52,606 --> 00:37:53,941
Good boys.

324
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:55,609
Good boys.

325
00:37:55,818 --> 00:37:58,362
What you got, Dodger?
Couple of pocketbooks.

326
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,781
Lined?
Pretty well.

327
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:05,828
Yeah.

328
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:16,463
Dodge.

329
00:38:16,922 --> 00:38:19,132
I don't know, Dodge.

330
00:38:22,636 --> 00:38:24,054
Well...

331
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,557
not as heavy as they might be...

332
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,141
but very neat...

333
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:31,061
and nicely made.

334
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:33,897
Ingenious workman,
ain't he, Oliver?

335
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:35,816
Indeed, sir.

336
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:38,360
And, Charley, what have you got,
my dear?

337
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:40,612
Wipes.
Wipes?

338
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,494
They're very good ones.

339
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,538
Very.

340
00:38:54,293 --> 00:38:55,878
You haven't marked them well.

341
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:01,008
The marks should be picked out
with a needle. And we'll--

342
00:39:01,216 --> 00:39:02,843
We'll teach Oliver how to do it.

343
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,928
Shall us, Oliver?
lf you please, sir.

344
00:39:05,137 --> 00:39:08,765
You'd like to make handkerchiefs as
easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

345
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:11,518
Very much indeed,
if you'll teach me, sir.

346
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:14,688
I've never met anyone so green.

347
00:39:31,872 --> 00:39:33,665
Now then, boys...

348
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,584
the game.

349
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,421
We'll show Oliver...

350
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,548
how to make
pocket handkerchiefs.

351
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,928
You'd like to play a game,
wouldn't you?

352
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:47,846
Yes, sir.

353
00:41:13,891 --> 00:41:16,852
Got the time, guv?
It's...

354
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,313
8:00.

355
00:41:27,946 --> 00:41:32,159
Playing the game, were we, Fagin?
As is our custom, my dear.

356
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:35,829
He's new. Who's he?
Oh, this is Oliver.

357
00:41:36,038 --> 00:41:37,581
Oliver...

358
00:41:38,332 --> 00:41:42,586
these are our very good friends
Bet and Nancy.

359
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,257
See, Dodger,
you wanna learn from him.

360
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,511
He's got manners, he has.
A proper gentleman.

361
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:52,971
We popped in
because we were that cold inside.

362
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,767
As is your custom, my dear.

363
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,770
Charley.
Come on, Oliver. Join us.

364
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,231
Or don't you sit
with the common folk?

365
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:05,943
Now, you wanna be
careful of this lot, Oliver.

366
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,695
They'll have you picking--
Picking out the marks.

367
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:12,199
Just what we was teaching him,
ain't it, Oliver, my dear?

368
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:14,159
Yes, sir.
"Yes, sir"?

369
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,162
You know who you're talking to,
do you?

370
00:42:17,913 --> 00:42:20,290
What's your mother got to say
about you being here?

371
00:42:20,499 --> 00:42:22,960
I haven't got a mother.
I'm an orphan.

372
00:42:23,168 --> 00:42:24,628
You're in the right company, then.

373
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:30,050
Come on, Oliver,
I'll teach you how to play.

374
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,344
It's called Spec or Speculation.

375
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:36,098
Three cards each,
and then the one he turns up...

376
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:38,267
is trumps.

377
00:42:46,775 --> 00:42:50,362
This is a pleasant life,
ain't it, my dear?

378
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:58,620
When can I go out, sir?
Soon. Soon.

379
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:01,623
Let's--

380
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,376
Let's see what you've learned.

381
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,921
Would you like that?
Oh, yes, sir.

382
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,675
See if you can take this out...

383
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,970
without my feeling it.

384
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,540
Is it gone?

385
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,504
You're a clever boy, my dear.

386
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:51,840
I never saw a sharper lad.

387
00:43:57,179 --> 00:43:59,014
Here's a shilling for you.

388
00:44:00,724 --> 00:44:03,393
Make the Dodger and Charley
your models.

389
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:05,145
Especially the Dodger, my dear.

390
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,857
He'll be a great man himself,
make you one too.

391
00:44:09,066 --> 00:44:10,734
You go on this way...

392
00:44:10,943 --> 00:44:13,779
you'll be the greatest man
of the time.

393
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,951
Thank you very much, sir.

394
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:30,379
Lovely white apples.
Get your lovely apples.

395
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:36,593
Biggest cabbages in town.
Come on.

396
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,764
You mean that one
with the wide rim?

397
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,392
Too expensive.

398
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:35,068
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

399
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:36,570
Stop, thief!

400
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,117
Stop!

401
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,952
Thief!

402
00:45:44,995 --> 00:45:46,955
You're a thief!
Get him!

403
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:49,666
Stop him!
Stop that boy!

404
00:45:49,875 --> 00:45:51,502
Thief!

405
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:55,422
Stop, thief!

406
00:45:55,964 --> 00:45:57,424
Thief!

407
00:45:59,801 --> 00:46:01,470
Stop him!

408
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:04,056
Stop him!

409
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:06,308
Mind out.

410
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,563
Stop, thief!

411
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:16,318
There, over there.

412
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,696
That way!

413
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:22,825
Stop, thief! Stop!
Thief!

414
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:41,385
What's your name, boy?
Give him some air.

415
00:46:42,219 --> 00:46:43,554
He's scared to death.

416
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:46,974
Where's the gentleman?
Here's the gentleman now.

417
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:49,184
ls this the boy, sir?
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

418
00:46:49,393 --> 00:46:51,937
That's a good one.
Did you hear him, "afraid it is"?

419
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:55,440
Poor fellow's hurt himself.
Yeah, I did that, sir.

420
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:59,361
Hurt me knuckle against his mouth.
But I stopped him.

421
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:02,531
Get up!
lt wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

422
00:47:02,698 --> 00:47:05,159
Of course it wasn't. It never is.

423
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:06,994
Now get up.
Don't hurt him.

424
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:10,497
Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

425
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:14,668
This way, gentlemen.

426
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:16,253
This way, gentlemen.

427
00:47:18,255 --> 00:47:21,258
What's next?
That is my name and address, sir.

428
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:23,927
Officer, who is this fellow?

429
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,013
My name is Brownlow.
Hold your tongue.

430
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:28,640
Officer, what's this fellow
charged with?

431
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:30,976
Oh, no, no. He's not charged,
Your Worship.

432
00:47:31,185 --> 00:47:32,978
He appears against the boy.

433
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,771
Swear him.
Before I am sworn...

434
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,524
I must beg to say one word.
Hold your tongue, sir.

435
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:40,736
I will not, sir!
Hold your tongue this instant.

436
00:47:40,944 --> 00:47:43,322
You're an insolent,
impertinent fellow.

437
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,782
How dare you bully a magistrate.
What?

438
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:49,495
Swear this person.
I'll not hear another word. Swear him.

439
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:53,040
"l do solemnly swear to tell
the whole truth, so help me God."

440
00:47:53,248 --> 00:47:56,084
What's the charge against the boy?
I was at a bookstore when--

441
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:58,337
Hold your tongue!
Where's the policeman?

442
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:00,797
Policeman, what is this?
Are there any witnesses?

443
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,300
None, Your Worship.
The boy is ill.

444
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:06,094
Oh, yes, I daresay.

445
00:48:06,303 --> 00:48:09,389
Come along, you vagabond.
None of your tricks here.

446
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:11,350
What's your name?

447
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:14,561
What's your name,
you hardened scoundrel?

448
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,856
Officer, what's his name?
What's your name, boy?

449
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,818
Some water. Some water.

450
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:23,320
He says his name is Sam Waters,
Your Worship.

451
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:25,197
Where does he live?
Where do you live?

452
00:48:25,405 --> 00:48:28,742
Anywhere he can, Your Worship.
Stuff and nonsense.

453
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,494
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

454
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:32,704
No, I think he really is ill,
Your Worship.

455
00:48:32,913 --> 00:48:35,749
I know better,
or my name's not Fang.

456
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,085
Stand away, officer. He's shamming.

457
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:40,712
He stands committed
for three months.

458
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,798
Hard labor, of course.
Clear the office.

459
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:45,300
Stop. Stop, stop!
Don't take him away.

460
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:48,428
What is this? Who is this?
Turn this man out.

461
00:48:48,595 --> 00:48:52,808
Clear the office.
I will not be turned out! I will speak!

462
00:48:53,016 --> 00:48:55,060
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

463
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,980
I demand to be heard.
What have you got to say?

464
00:48:58,188 --> 00:49:01,108
lt was not this boy.
Not this boy? Who was it, then?

465
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:04,319
The robbery was committed by
two others while the man was reading.

466
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:07,781
I saw it done. I saw that this boy
was perfectly amazed by it.

467
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:09,283
Why didn't you come before?

468
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:13,036
I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.
Reading, you say?

469
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:14,830
A book, I suppose.

470
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,040
Yes, the very one
he has in his hand.

471
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:20,043
Oh, dear me, I forgot all about it.

472
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:21,753
Well, you're a nice one.

473
00:49:21,962 --> 00:49:25,549
To prefer a charge
against an innocent boy.

474
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,760
I consider, sir,
that you've obtained that book...

475
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,972
under very suspicious
and disreputable circumstances.

476
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:33,390
Damn me!
Bookseller...

477
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,559
do you want to press charges
against him?

478
00:49:35,767 --> 00:49:37,186
Certainly not.
Well...

479
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:39,813
think yourself fortunate...

480
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:42,316
that the owner of the book
declines to prosecute.

481
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:43,775
The boy is discharged.

482
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:45,194
Clear the office.
Damn me.

483
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,738
Clear the office!
Clear the office!

484
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:49,907
Next case.

485
00:49:50,574 --> 00:49:54,077
Come on. Move along, sir, please.
Just move along, sir.

486
00:49:54,286 --> 00:49:55,787
There's a good gentleman, sir.

487
00:49:56,497 --> 00:49:58,582
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

488
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:01,627
Mind that step.
Just mind that step there.

489
00:50:03,128 --> 00:50:05,339
Make way for the law, sir.

490
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:09,968
Careful. Careful with him.
He seems very young too.

491
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:12,804
Call a coach, pray.

492
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:15,974
Yeah, right away, sir.
I'm sorry.

493
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:19,353
Poor boy.

494
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:26,568
Mind yourself, madam.
Thank you, sir.

495
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,488
Got one, sir.
Thank you, officer.

496
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,698
Let me, sir.

497
00:50:31,907 --> 00:50:33,617
There we go.

498
00:50:35,911 --> 00:50:38,121
Will you drop me off, sir?
Of course.

499
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:40,415
All right.

500
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,126
If you could just take his head, sir.

501
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:47,172
Where to, sir?
Pentonville.

502
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:49,091
Pentonville.
Yes.

503
00:50:50,509 --> 00:50:51,093
Answer me! Where is he?

504
00:50:51,093 --> 00:50:51,718
Answer me! Where is he?

505
00:50:51,927 --> 00:50:54,471
What's become of the boy?
Speak out, or I'll throttle you!

506
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,683
The traps have got him!
Let go of me, will you?!

507
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:06,817
Bullseye!

508
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:10,445
Who pitched this here at me?
Who done it?

509
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:15,951
Bullseye.
Come in, you sneaking warmint.

510
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,829
What you stopping outside for?

511
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:21,540
Lay down.

512
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:27,045
What you up to, Fagin?
Ill-treating the boys again?

513
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:31,175
A wonder they don't murder you.
I would, if I was them.

514
00:51:31,383 --> 00:51:35,095
Don't speak so loud.
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

515
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:37,848
Give us a drink.
And mind you don't poison it.

516
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,766
Charley.

517
00:51:40,267 --> 00:51:42,352
Good stuff, Bill.

518
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,272
So, Dodger...

519
00:51:45,481 --> 00:51:48,275
what's it all about?
A new boy.

520
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:50,569
Come out with us
afore he was rightly up to it.

521
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:54,198
Got nabbed by the traps.
You see, Bill...

522
00:51:54,406 --> 00:51:59,453
I'm afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

523
00:51:59,995 --> 00:52:02,831
You were blowed upon, Fagin.

524
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,208
And about time.

525
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:07,377
And I'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game was up with us...

526
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:12,216
it would come out rather worse
for you than it would for me, my dear.

527
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,343
There's only one thing for it.

528
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:17,930
Somebody's gotta find out at the office
what's being done to him.

529
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,098
Somebody's gotta
get hold of him somehow.

530
00:52:20,307 --> 00:52:23,477
I ain't going near no police office.
Not for nobody, nohow.

531
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:26,688
I have it, the very thing.
Bet will go.

532
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:29,441
Won't you, my dear?
I'm blessed if I will.

533
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,401
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

534
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,696
It won't do. There's no use
in trying it on, Fagin.

535
00:52:34,905 --> 00:52:36,657
What do you mean by that?
What I say.

536
00:52:36,865 --> 00:52:38,742
Why, you're just
the very person for it.

537
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:40,786
Nobody about here
knows anything about you.

538
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:43,580
And as I don't want them to neither.

539
00:52:43,789 --> 00:52:45,999
It's rather more "no" than "yes"
with me, Bill.

540
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,252
She'll go, Fagin.
No, she won't, Fagin.

541
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,462
Yes, she will, Fagin.

542
00:53:01,348 --> 00:53:04,768
Can I help you, miss?
I'm looking for my little brother.

543
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:07,980
Now, who would he be?
A lovely little boy.

544
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:11,441
Lovely manners.
Gentle as falling snow.

545
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:14,278
We don't get many of those.

546
00:53:14,486 --> 00:53:17,114
I think you'll be wanting
Mr. Fang's court.

547
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,790
George, this here young lady
is looking for her brother.

548
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:29,042
The one that fainted
and got away with it.

549
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:31,545
Oh, yeah.
Gentleman took him away.

550
00:53:31,753 --> 00:53:34,882
What gentleman? Gracious heavens,
what gentleman?

551
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:37,676
Well, lives in Pentonville, I believe.

552
00:53:37,885 --> 00:53:40,179
Oh, my God.

553
00:53:40,721 --> 00:53:42,764
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

554
00:53:42,973 --> 00:53:45,392
His card's here somewhere.

555
00:53:46,143 --> 00:53:47,895
Here we are.

556
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,904
Thank you, sir.

557
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,173
Mr. Brownlow.

558
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,467
Mr. Brownlow.

559
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:29,997
There's something in him...

560
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:33,125
that touched my heart,
Mrs. Bedwin.

561
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,335
Can't explain it.

562
00:55:35,544 --> 00:55:38,338
I feel the same, sir.

563
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,549
Who is he? What is he?

564
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:42,551
You know nothing of him.

565
00:55:42,718 --> 00:55:44,845
He had a fever. What of that?

566
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,806
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

567
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,809
I knew a man in Jamaica who was
hanged for murdering his master.

568
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,187
He had a fever six times.

569
00:55:53,562 --> 00:55:56,565
I know there is goodness in him.
How do you know it?

570
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:58,317
Goodness and innocence.

571
00:55:58,817 --> 00:56:01,361
I knew it the first moment I saw him.
He'll deceive you.

572
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,489
Let you down
at the first opportunity...

573
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,366
Iike all your other
good and innocent causes.

574
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:11,079
If that boy's good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

575
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,174
How do you feel, my dear?

576
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:24,051
Very happy, sir.

577
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:28,222
And very grateful to you indeed, sir.
Good boy.

578
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:32,976
Have you given him any nourishment,
Bedwin? Any slops?

579
00:56:33,185 --> 00:56:36,104
Not slops, sir. Broth.

580
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,232
A couple of glasses of port wine...

581
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,026
would have done him
a great deal more good.

582
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,278
Wouldn't they, Sam?

583
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:45,447
My name is Oliver, sir.

584
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:47,491
Oliver?

585
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,745
Oliver what? Oliver Waters?
No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.

586
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,374
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

587
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:57,417
I never told him so, sir.

588
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:01,255
You did not?
No, sir.

589
00:57:04,049 --> 00:57:06,760
You're not angry with me, are you?
No, no.

590
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:09,471
Queer name.

591
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,931
Oliver Twist.

592
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:16,228
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

593
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,647
A great number, sir.

594
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,108
Never saw so many.

595
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,779
How would you like
to grow up a clever man...

596
00:57:25,988 --> 00:57:27,948
and write books?

597
00:57:28,157 --> 00:57:30,701
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

598
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:33,620
Wouldn't you like to be
a book writer?

599
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:38,417
I think it'd be a better thing
to be a bookseller, sir.

600
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,964
You have said a very good thing.

601
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:45,632
Well, well.

602
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:49,261
We won't make an author of you while
there's an honest trade to be learned...

603
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:51,597
or brickmaking to turn to.

604
00:57:51,805 --> 00:57:55,142
Are you going to send me away, sir?
No, my dear child.

605
00:57:55,309 --> 00:57:58,061
You need not be afraid
that I am going to desert you...

606
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:00,731
unless you give me cause.
I never, never will, sir.

607
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:02,107
I hope not...

608
00:58:02,316 --> 00:58:05,194
because I feel strongly disposed
to trust you.

609
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,653
Thank you, sir.

610
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,332
I'm pleased
I won't have to wear those again.

611
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,292
So are we all, my dear.

612
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:24,463
There.

613
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,105
Hello.

614
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,982
What's that?

615
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,025
This is young Oliver Twist.

616
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,902
The bookseller's boy
brought a package.

617
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:32,614
Oh, stop him, Oliver.
There's some books to go back.

618
00:59:32,823 --> 00:59:35,909
ls that the boy who had the fever?
That's the boy.

619
00:59:51,383 --> 00:59:53,302
Mind out!

620
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:06,982
No sign of him, sir.
Oh, dear, I'm very sorry for that.

621
01:00:07,191 --> 01:00:09,610
I particularly wished some books
to be returned tonight.

622
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:13,530
Why not send Oliver with them?
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.

623
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,157
Yes, do let me take them.

624
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:18,494
If you please, sir.
I'll run all the way.

625
01:00:27,044 --> 01:00:28,504
You shall go, my dear.

626
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,714
Ask Mrs. Bedwin
to show you the way.

627
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,551
And, Oliver....
Yes, sir?

628
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,596
Give the bookseller this.

629
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,101
The money I owe him.

630
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,401
I won't be long, sir.

631
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:57,032
How long do you think it'll take him?
You really expect him to come back?

632
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:01,453
You don't?
With a ¡ê5 note in his pocket?

633
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:03,330
No, I do not.

634
01:01:04,456 --> 01:01:06,583
If ever that boy
returns to this house...

635
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,836
I'll eat my own head, sir.

636
01:01:10,295 --> 01:01:11,463
And yours.

637
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,399
Oh, my little brother!

638
01:01:30,983 --> 01:01:33,652
I don't believe my eyes.
Let me go. Help!

639
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:37,739
It's a miracle. Oh, I've found him.
Please let me go.

640
01:01:37,948 --> 01:01:40,701
Oh, Oliver. Oliver.
Nancy.

641
01:01:40,909 --> 01:01:44,246
You're such a naughty boy to make me
suffer such distress on your account.

642
01:01:44,454 --> 01:01:46,540
Let go of me!
What's the matter, ma'am?

643
01:01:46,748 --> 01:01:48,458
He ran away from his parents.

644
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:50,961
Get off me!
Hard-working, respectable people...

645
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,714
and joined a set of thieves
and bad characters.

646
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,215
Broke his mother's heart.

647
01:01:55,424 --> 01:01:57,885
Young wretch.
Go home, you little brute.

648
01:01:58,093 --> 01:01:59,553
I haven't got any parents.

649
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:01,513
I'm an orphan.
I live in Pentonville.

650
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,932
Oh, only hear him,
how he braves it out.

651
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,351
What? Young Oliver.
It's true.

652
01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:10,355
You come home
to your poor mother.

653
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:13,609
I don't belong to them!
I don't know them! Help! Help!

654
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:15,027
"Help, help"?

655
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:18,489
I'll give you "help, help,"
you little wretch!

656
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:20,282
And these books.

657
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:23,160
Have you been a-stealing them,
have you, eh?

658
01:02:23,368 --> 01:02:26,830
You little villain.
That's right. You give it to him.

659
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:30,250
Only way to bring him to his senses.
I will, missus.

660
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,211
And you come with me,
you little wretch.

661
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,129
It'll do him good.

662
01:02:34,338 --> 01:02:36,798
Who is this man? Help!
Bullseye, mind him, boy.

663
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:39,468
Mind him.
Help! Help!

664
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:42,888
Look at him, Fagin.

665
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,307
Hold me, somebody.

666
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:48,060
Hold me, somebody,
while I laugh it out.

667
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,354
Look at his togs, Fagin.

668
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:53,190
Delighted to see you
looking so well, my dear.

669
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:56,026
Why didn't you write, my dear,
and say you was coming?

670
01:02:56,235 --> 01:02:59,363
We'd have got something warm
for supper.

671
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:02,282
Hello, Fagin. What's that?
That's mine, Fagin.

672
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:05,160
Oh, no, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.

673
01:03:05,369 --> 01:03:07,996
If that ain't mine and Nancy's,
I'll take the boy back again.

674
01:03:08,205 --> 01:03:09,498
Come on, hand over, will you?

675
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,834
This is hardly fair, Bill.
Hardly fair, Nancy.

676
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:15,420
Fair or not fair,
hand over, I tell you.

677
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:19,174
Give it here, you avaricious
old skeleton. Give it here!

678
01:03:19,383 --> 01:03:22,594
That's for our share of the trouble,
and not half enough neither.

679
01:03:23,053 --> 01:03:26,473
You may keep the books if you're fond
of reading. If you ain't, sell them.

680
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:30,727
They're very pretty.
Beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?

681
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:33,939
Send them back.
They belong to Mr. Brownlow.

682
01:03:34,148 --> 01:03:35,983
Send them back.
The books and the money.

683
01:03:36,733 --> 01:03:37,901
He'll think I stole them.

684
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,903
Please send them back.
The boy's right.

685
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:43,699
You're right, Oliver. You're right.
They will think you've stolen them.

686
01:03:45,075 --> 01:03:47,578
It couldn't have happened better
if we'd chosen our time.

687
01:03:47,786 --> 01:03:49,705
Help! Help! Police!

688
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:52,207
Fetch the police! The police!

689
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:55,502
Keep back the dog, Bill.
He'll tear the boy to pieces.

690
01:03:55,711 --> 01:03:58,589
Serve him right.
Help! Fetch the police!

691
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:00,799
Fetch the police!

692
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,302
Step aside, or I'll split
your head against the wall.

693
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,595
I don't care.

694
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:08,307
That child shan't be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first.

695
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,061
Bullseye. Here. Bullseye!

696
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,112
Dodger!

697
01:04:22,613 --> 01:04:24,907
Get after him!

698
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:30,954
Take your hands off me!

699
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:04,988
So you wanted to get away,
my dear, did you?

700
01:05:05,197 --> 01:05:07,449
Wanted to call for the police,
did you?

701
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:10,410
We'll soon cure you of that.

702
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:14,832
I won't stand by
and see this done, Fagin.

703
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,959
You got the boy.
What more do you want?

704
01:05:17,167 --> 01:05:20,254
Keep quiet, Nancy, or I'll quieten you
for a good long time to come.

705
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:22,422
Let him be. Let him be!

706
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,800
You're a fine one for the boy
to make a friend of.

707
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:27,052
God Almighty help me, I am.

708
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:30,681
He's a thief, a liar, a devil,
all that's bad from this night forth.

709
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,392
Ain't that enough for the old wretch
without blows?

710
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,478
Come, come, we must have
civil words. Civil words.

711
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:39,982
Civil words?
Civil words, you old villain!

712
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,026
I thieved for you when I was a child
not half as old as this.

713
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:44,695
It's your living.

714
01:05:44,903 --> 01:05:48,115
Yes, and you're the wretch
that drove me to it...

715
01:05:48,323 --> 01:05:52,452
and who will keep me at it,
day and night, till I die!

716
01:05:55,164 --> 01:05:58,959
Dodger, Charley,
put Oliver to bed.

717
01:05:59,168 --> 01:06:01,795
Best to take them clothes off.
They're too good to sleep in.

718
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,424
Charley's right. This here suit cost
more than 4 pence ha'penny.

719
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:08,886
I never felt such lovely stuff.
Have you, Dodger?

720
01:06:09,344 --> 01:06:11,221
Not me. But I'm willing to lay odds...

721
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:14,975
this is the same stuff
the queen wears on Sundays.

722
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:19,062
Quick, get him.

723
01:06:19,271 --> 01:06:21,190
Take it off.

724
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,152
Lift him up.

725
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,613
Up he goes.

726
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:32,284
Get them shoes off.

727
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,697
Little something for your luncheon,
my dear?

728
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,633
Shall we have a little chat?

729
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:32,553
Oliver?

730
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:34,555
Shall us?

731
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:39,685
I expect you'd welcome...

732
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:44,690
the sound of a human voice again,
eh, my dear?

733
01:07:49,778 --> 01:07:51,572
Do you know...

734
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:56,451
what I consider the greatest sin
in the world, my dear?

735
01:07:57,411 --> 01:08:00,080
Ingratitude.

736
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:03,959
And that's what you're guilty of...

737
01:08:04,168 --> 01:08:06,211
ingratitude.

738
01:08:06,461 --> 01:08:09,798
We took you in, we cherished you. If
we hadn't, you'd have died of hunger.

739
01:08:10,007 --> 01:08:11,675
How do you repay us?
You run away...

740
01:08:11,884 --> 01:08:17,222
you cry out for the police, you
cause us great anxiety and expense.

741
01:08:21,477 --> 01:08:24,354
There was a lad once, just like you,
and I was a father to him.

742
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:27,024
He ran away, like you.
He indeed went to the police.

743
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:30,235
And can you guess
how he ended up?

744
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:35,491
They hanged him...

745
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,243
at the Old Bailey.

746
01:08:38,911 --> 01:08:43,832
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true...

747
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:48,670
but all of it necessary to provide
for my own safety...

748
01:08:48,879 --> 01:08:50,631
and that of my friends.

749
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:53,592
Yeah. Poor boy.

750
01:08:54,218 --> 01:08:56,178
Hanged.

751
01:08:56,803 --> 01:08:59,097
It's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.

752
01:08:59,306 --> 01:09:01,433
Dawn, the gallows...

753
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,936
the rope, the noose.

754
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:06,438
You don't always have
to be guilty, you see, Oliver.

755
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:08,273
They hang you for anything
these days.

756
01:09:08,482 --> 01:09:11,443
That's because they're
so very fond of hanging.

757
01:09:20,494 --> 01:09:23,330
But if you do as you're told...

758
01:09:23,872 --> 01:09:26,917
we'll be very good friends yet.

759
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,638
You must feel free
to walk about now, Oliver.

760
01:09:41,515 --> 01:09:42,975
Yes, feel free.

761
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:53,485
Here, Oliver.
Yes?

762
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:56,780
I'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straightaway.

763
01:09:57,865 --> 01:10:01,827
Will you do that for me, my man?
All right. I'll be glad to have company.

764
01:10:02,035 --> 01:10:06,498
There's a good fellow. You may start
by japanning my trotter-cases.

765
01:10:06,707 --> 01:10:09,168
In plain English, clean my boots.

766
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:15,507
What a pity he ain't a prig.

767
01:10:15,674 --> 01:10:18,093
He don't know what's good for him.

768
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:19,970
I suppose you don't know
what a prig is.

769
01:10:20,179 --> 01:10:22,431
Yes, I do. It's a....

770
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:25,267
It's a thief.

771
01:10:25,476 --> 01:10:26,977
You're one, aren't you?

772
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:29,897
Yes, I am. And so we all are.
Down to the dog...

773
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:31,857
and he's the downiest one
of the lot.

774
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:34,026
And the least given to peaching.

775
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:36,278
He wouldn't so much as bark
in a witness box...

776
01:10:36,487 --> 01:10:41,241
for fear of committing himself.
He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

777
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:43,994
Why don't you put yourself
under Fagin, Oliver?

778
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:45,996
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

779
01:10:46,205 --> 01:10:50,042
Like your old gentleman
in Pentonville. Big house, that.

780
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:53,504
I had a peep at it, I did.
Nice inside, was it?

781
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:58,091
Yes. And I slept in a proper bed.
In my own room.

782
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,887
Good stuff on the walls, eh?
Yes. Indeed.

783
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:03,555
Put yourself under Fagin...

784
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:07,226
and you'll be able to retire
to a property just like that.

785
01:11:07,434 --> 01:11:09,394
And do the genteel.

786
01:11:09,603 --> 01:11:11,688
No, he's scared
he'll come to be scragged.

787
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:13,440
I don't know what that means.

788
01:11:17,903 --> 01:11:20,531
If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs
and watches, Nolly...

789
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:24,076
some other cove will. You have
the same right to them as they have.

790
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:27,037
To be sure. To be sure.

791
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:29,957
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear,
in a nutshell.

792
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:31,458
Take the Dodger's word for it.

793
01:11:31,667 --> 01:11:34,586
He understands the catechism
of his trade.

794
01:11:46,098 --> 01:11:47,933
Cabby?

795
01:12:07,911 --> 01:12:10,873
I've come from Bill.
For what?

796
01:12:11,123 --> 01:12:14,585
For no harm.
I don't believe it.

797
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:19,047
If I could help you, I would,
but I've not the power.

798
01:12:19,256 --> 01:12:22,092
Now, I've promised him
you'll be good and silent.

799
01:12:22,301 --> 01:12:25,262
If you're not, you'll only do
yourself harm.

800
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:27,431
And me too.

801
01:12:37,065 --> 01:12:38,901
Did he come quiet?

802
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:41,069
Like a lamb.

803
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,115
Sit down.

804
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:52,956
And let me read you a lecture.

805
01:12:59,296 --> 01:13:00,631
You know what this is?

806
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:04,635
Yes.
Well, then.

807
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,682
This is powder.

808
01:13:18,315 --> 01:13:19,483
That here's a bullet.

809
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:26,365
And this is a little bit
of an old hat...

810
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:28,617
for wadding.

811
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:39,378
Now it's loaded.
Yes, I can see it is, sir.

812
01:13:40,003 --> 01:13:42,422
If you speak a word
when you're out of doors with me...

813
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:44,550
unless I speak to you...

814
01:13:44,758 --> 01:13:47,970
this loading will go in your head
without notice.

815
01:13:48,178 --> 01:13:51,849
So if you do make up your mind
to speak without leave...

816
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:53,642
says your prayers first.

817
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,729
The short and long of what you mean
is that if you're crossed by him...

818
01:13:57,938 --> 01:14:00,023
you'll prevent him
from telling tales after...

819
01:14:00,232 --> 01:14:02,192
by shooting him through the head.

820
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:04,736
And you'll take your chance
of swinging for it.

821
01:14:04,945 --> 01:14:08,490
That's it. Women always put things
in the fewest words.

822
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,784
Supper, Nancy.

823
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:13,162
And then a snooze afore starting.

824
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:44,651
My pal Bill.

825
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:47,529
The door's open, come in.

826
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,159
Don't make such a row.

827
01:14:55,537 --> 01:14:56,997
Show us a glim, Toby.

828
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,417
Barney, a glim.
Show the gentleman in.

829
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:05,380
Barney?
Wake up first, if convenient.

830
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:19,478
Mr. Sykes. Come in, sir, come in.

831
01:15:38,247 --> 01:15:41,083
Bill, my boy. Glad to see you.

832
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:44,753
Who's...?

833
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,839
Who's this?
Only the boy.

834
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:50,300
One of Mr. Fagin's lads?
Yeah. It's time.

835
01:15:50,509 --> 01:15:52,219
Right.

836
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:54,888
Barkers for me, Barney.

837
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,692
They're loaded.
Good.

838
01:16:14,491 --> 01:16:17,536
The persuaders?
Got them.

839
01:16:21,665 --> 01:16:23,417
Keys, center bits.

840
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:30,048
Darkies.

841
01:16:40,809 --> 01:16:42,728
Nothing forgotten?

842
01:16:53,572 --> 01:16:55,616
Yeah, it's all quiet.

843
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:49,044
I can't. I can't.

844
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:51,088
You will.

845
01:17:51,296 --> 01:17:52,714
It's Mr. Brownlow's house.

846
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,288
Have mercy.
Don't make me steal from him.

847
01:18:24,496 --> 01:18:26,874
Have mercy on me.
Come here.

848
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:29,459
For God's sake, let me run away
and die in the fields.

849
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:33,046
I'll never come near London, never.
Shut it.

850
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:37,176
Get up. Or I'll strew your brains
on the grass.

851
01:19:17,799 --> 01:19:19,968
I'm putting you through there.

852
01:19:20,177 --> 01:19:22,971
Go to the front door
and unfasten it.

853
01:19:23,639 --> 01:19:26,934
I can't, there's a bolt at the top.
I know it, I can't reach it.

854
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:31,230
Well, stand on a chair or something.
Just do it.

855
01:20:27,744 --> 01:20:30,747
To the door.
To the front door, damn you.

856
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,293
Who's there?

857
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:38,547
Mrs. Bedwin? Is that you?

858
01:20:53,270 --> 01:20:54,855
Come here. Come here.

859
01:20:56,398 --> 01:21:00,319
Save me! Save me!
Save me, for God's sake!

860
01:21:08,994 --> 01:21:10,579
Help!

861
01:21:12,206 --> 01:21:15,000
Help! Police!

862
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,094
Give him here.

863
01:21:32,142 --> 01:21:33,977
Oh, damnation, how he bleeds.

864
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:36,939
ls he hit bad?
He's gotta be hit worse.

865
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,446
Give me a pistol.
What?

866
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:47,991
We gotta get rid of him,
or he'll squeal.

867
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,118
We gotta do him in.

868
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:53,497
Here, here. Down here by the river.

869
01:21:53,705 --> 01:21:56,583
But, Bill! Bill!

870
01:21:59,503 --> 01:22:02,005
Bill?
Help!

871
01:22:02,214 --> 01:22:05,008
Help! Help!

872
01:22:05,884 --> 01:22:08,971
Bill.
Help!

873
01:22:17,146 --> 01:22:18,730
Snap.

874
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:21,984
Snap.

875
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:25,154
Snap.

876
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,575
Snap.

877
01:22:32,161 --> 01:22:33,704
Snap.

878
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:49,428
Well, well.

879
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:51,180
How are you, Fagey?

880
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:56,518
Scarce. Scarce!
Where's Bill?

881
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,979
He's-- He's bleeding.
What happened?

882
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:01,690
All in good time.

883
01:23:01,899 --> 01:23:05,652
I can't talk business
till I've ate and drank.

884
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,078
Nancy, I said, scarce. Scarce!

885
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:16,497
Where's Bill?

886
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:18,749
Well, produce the sustenance,
if you please.

887
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:20,834
Dodger!

888
01:23:21,043 --> 01:23:22,211
Nancy, scarce!

889
01:23:29,092 --> 01:23:31,595
The crack failed.
I smelt that.

890
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:34,556
For the last time of asking,
where's Bill?

891
01:23:36,475 --> 01:23:38,143
Dodger.

892
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:44,066
Put him to bed,
give him a nip of gin.

893
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:54,076
The boy was about to blow on us,
Fagey.

894
01:23:54,409 --> 01:23:56,578
He was seen.
Seen?

895
01:23:56,787 --> 01:23:59,414
He was seen? Who saw him?

896
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:02,251
Two old ones.
He shouted out.

897
01:24:02,459 --> 01:24:04,670
Bill lost his head,
fired his pistol....

898
01:24:04,878 --> 01:24:07,339
And hit the boy?
I don't know. There was two shots.

899
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:09,925
Only one was Bill's.

900
01:24:10,134 --> 01:24:13,554
We made a run for it.
I had ahold of the boy, and Bill fell.

901
01:24:13,804 --> 01:24:15,514
Fell? Was he hurt?

902
01:24:15,722 --> 01:24:19,143
No. Last seen, he was swimming
to London.

903
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,981
Bullseye.

904
01:24:27,109 --> 01:24:29,403
I told you not to bring a soul here.

905
01:24:29,611 --> 01:24:31,613
Now you've brought the devil.

906
01:24:31,822 --> 01:24:34,199
You said to fetch him.

907
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:37,161
His fever is that high,
he don't remember nothing.

908
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:40,998
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

909
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:43,333
I'm as weak as water.

910
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:45,210
Get us a drink.

911
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:51,425
What evil wind has blowed you here?
No evil wind, my dear.

912
01:24:52,217 --> 01:24:55,554
You, Bill, you.
You said we need to speak.

913
01:25:01,185 --> 01:25:03,103
What you done with that boy?
Where is he?

914
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:05,772
Safe and sound.
The Dodger's minding him.

915
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:09,568
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

916
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:15,282
What about the boy, Bill?

917
01:25:17,701 --> 01:25:20,370
We don't want anyone
peaching on us, do we?

918
01:25:20,579 --> 01:25:23,624
And as long as that boy's alive,
we're as good as hung.

919
01:25:23,874 --> 01:25:26,376
So, what's to be done?

920
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:30,214
Nothing.
Nothing?

921
01:25:30,422 --> 01:25:33,467
Not till I'm better.
Then what?

922
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:36,887
Then I'll do for him.
How, Bill? Where?

923
01:25:37,846 --> 01:25:40,808
Outside of London somewhere.
I'll find a river and I'll drown him.

924
01:25:41,016 --> 01:25:43,393
The boy's weak.
Bill, he was wounded.

925
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:46,021
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

926
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:49,274
When he can walk, tell me.
I'll fetch him.

927
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:51,944
Now, get out of here.

928
01:25:52,694 --> 01:25:54,363
Yes.

929
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:56,990
Yes.

930
01:25:57,241 --> 01:26:00,244
Bill, you're right.

931
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:05,332
It's for the best.

932
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:12,131
I'm burning up.

933
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:13,924
Give me me physic.
Where's me physic?

934
01:26:16,301 --> 01:26:18,804
You look like a corpse
come back to life again.

935
01:26:19,012 --> 01:26:22,182
What's the matter?
Nothing.

936
01:26:23,308 --> 01:26:25,018
What do you look at me so hard for?

937
01:26:25,227 --> 01:26:28,397
What you thinking of?
Of many things, Bill.

938
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:30,691
What odds in that?
I'll tell you what it is.

939
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:32,651
If you haven't caught the fever...

940
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,904
then there's something
more than usual in the wind.

941
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:38,657
And something dangerous too.

942
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,327
Give me me physic, I say.

943
01:26:44,997 --> 01:26:48,000
No, no, no.

944
01:26:48,584 --> 01:26:51,879
There ain't a stauncher-hearted
girl going...

945
01:26:52,546 --> 01:26:55,674
or I'd have cut her throat
three months ago.

946
01:26:57,259 --> 01:27:00,679
She's got a fever coming on.
That's it.

947
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:25,204
Here. Make you feel better.

948
01:27:32,169 --> 01:27:34,296
Sit aside me.

949
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:40,844
Put on your own face, or I'll alter it
so you won't know it again.

950
01:29:05,846 --> 01:29:08,056
Wait.
Ma'am.

951
01:29:25,991 --> 01:29:28,494
Yes?
Does Mr. Brownlow live here?

952
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:31,788
Who are you? What do you want?
Go around the back.

953
01:29:31,997 --> 01:29:34,833
I have information
about Oliver Twist.

954
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:41,173
Is he all right? Is he safe?

955
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:46,011
Where is he?
I will only talk to Mr. Brownlow.

956
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:48,722
He's not here.

957
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:51,308
The boy's innocent, tell him that.

958
01:29:52,476 --> 01:29:55,354
Where is he?
Safe.

959
01:29:56,730 --> 01:30:00,108
But he may not be for long.
Where is he?

960
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:13,330
Give Mr. Brownlow a message.

961
01:30:13,539 --> 01:30:15,874
Tell him to meet me on Sunday
at midnight...

962
01:30:16,041 --> 01:30:18,293
on London Bridge.
Midnight?

963
01:30:18,502 --> 01:30:20,128
And if I'm not there...

964
01:30:20,337 --> 01:30:24,758
then tell him to come the next night
and the next. I'll be there. Tell him.

965
01:30:30,430 --> 01:30:34,184
There, my dear,
you look as good as new.

966
01:30:34,726 --> 01:30:38,438
How do you feel?
Tired, sir.

967
01:30:38,647 --> 01:30:39,857
Well, yes, yes.

968
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:43,527
It is long after midnight.
Shortly, you'll sleep a good sleep.

969
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:45,195
But my meaning was...

970
01:30:45,404 --> 01:30:47,698
how do you feel
in yourself, Oliver?

971
01:30:47,906 --> 01:30:50,200
Better. Thank you, sir.

972
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:54,371
But for the ache in my arm.
Come sit.

973
01:30:56,874 --> 01:31:01,503
I have the very thing for such pains
as yours, my dear.

974
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:04,339
Undo the bandage.

975
01:31:15,225 --> 01:31:17,853
Oh, my God.

976
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:21,315
It's a nasty wound.

977
01:31:22,608 --> 01:31:26,320
But my magic will do the trick.
You'll see, my dear.

978
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:28,655
This remedy...

979
01:31:28,864 --> 01:31:30,782
is older than time. Yes...

980
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:33,285
my dear, older than time.

981
01:31:33,494 --> 01:31:36,955
It was handed down
from father to son...

982
01:31:37,164 --> 01:31:41,418
father to son, and comes from...

983
01:31:43,545 --> 01:31:45,839
who can say where?

984
01:31:48,759 --> 01:31:52,429
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

985
01:31:52,638 --> 01:31:54,765
For your kindness.
I'll always remember it.

986
01:31:54,973 --> 01:31:56,266
Well....

987
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,519
Well....

988
01:31:59,728 --> 01:32:01,188
Always.

989
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:03,982
Yes, always, my dear.

990
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:09,404
But who knows how long
that will be.

991
01:32:37,891 --> 01:32:40,477
An hour this side of midnight.

992
01:32:40,727 --> 01:32:43,147
Dark and heavy it is too.

993
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:46,191
Good night for business, this.

994
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,611
What a pity, Bill, my dear,
there's none quite ready to be done.

995
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,488
Yeah, for once, you're right.

996
01:32:51,989 --> 01:32:54,408
When will the boy be well enough
to go on his travels?

997
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:59,079
Like I say, Bill. In a day or two.
It's a pity.

998
01:32:59,288 --> 01:33:02,624
For I'm in the humor to.
Does me good to hear you.

999
01:33:02,833 --> 01:33:06,253
You're like yourself tonight, Bill.
Quite like yourself.

1000
01:33:06,462 --> 01:33:09,715
I don't feel like myself when you lay
that withered claw on my shoulder...

1001
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:12,092
so take it away.

1002
01:33:20,642 --> 01:33:22,561
Hello, Nance.

1003
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:24,855
Where's the girl going to
this time of night?

1004
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:27,733
Not far.
What answer's that?

1005
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:30,652
Where you going?
I say, not far.

1006
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:33,155
And I say, where?
I don't know where.

1007
01:33:33,363 --> 01:33:36,366
Then I do, nowhere. Sit down.

1008
01:33:36,575 --> 01:33:40,162
I'm not well. I want a breath of air.
Put your head out the window.

1009
01:33:40,370 --> 01:33:43,499
There's not enough there.
I want it in the street.

1010
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:49,671
Then you won't have it.

1011
01:33:54,968 --> 01:33:59,431
There. Now, stop quietly
where you are, will you?

1012
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:06,271
Do you know what you're doing?

1013
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:09,566
Do I know what I'm--?

1014
01:34:09,775 --> 01:34:12,820
I think this girl's lost her senses.
You talking to me in that way?

1015
01:34:13,028 --> 01:34:15,030
You'll drive me on
to something desperate.

1016
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:17,741
Now, let me go, will you?
This minute, this instant.

1017
01:34:17,908 --> 01:34:20,244
No!
Tell him to let me go, Fagin.

1018
01:34:20,911 --> 01:34:24,206
It'll be better for him.
Do you hear me?

1019
01:34:25,749 --> 01:34:28,836
Aye, I hear you.

1020
01:34:30,087 --> 01:34:33,006
And if I have to listen to you
for half a minute longer...

1021
01:34:33,215 --> 01:34:36,969
the dog will tear some
of that screaming voice out!

1022
01:34:37,302 --> 01:34:40,097
What's come over you, you jade?
What is it?

1023
01:34:40,305 --> 01:34:42,182
Bill, let me go.

1024
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:46,603
Let me go.
You don't know what you're doing.

1025
01:34:46,812 --> 01:34:48,063
For only one hour.

1026
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:52,067
Cut my limbs off one by one if I don't
think the girl's stark raving mad.

1027
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:55,988
Get up. Get up!
No.

1028
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:04,204
Now, stay there!

1029
01:35:07,124 --> 01:35:08,792
What a precious, strange girl that is.

1030
01:35:09,001 --> 01:35:11,044
You may say that, Bill,
you may say that.

1031
01:35:11,253 --> 01:35:13,464
Why did she take it in her head
to go out tonight?

1032
01:35:13,964 --> 01:35:16,758
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy,
I suppose, my dear.

1033
01:35:17,092 --> 01:35:20,262
I thought I tamed her of that.
But she's as bad as ever.

1034
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:26,059
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood and it won't come out.

1035
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:27,769
Like enough.

1036
01:35:27,978 --> 01:35:30,981
Well, if she's taken that way again,
I'll let her a little blood.

1037
01:35:31,190 --> 01:35:34,151
Without troubling the doctor.

1038
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:52,461
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1039
01:35:53,837 --> 01:35:55,255
Good night.

1040
01:35:55,464 --> 01:35:59,927
In two days, Bill,
come for the boy.

1041
01:36:01,845 --> 01:36:03,931
Light him down.

1042
01:36:04,139 --> 01:36:07,935
It's a pity he should fall and break
his neck without anyone seeing it.

1043
01:36:10,103 --> 01:36:11,438
Show him a light.

1044
01:36:20,823 --> 01:36:24,535
What is it, Nancy dear,
the reason for all this?

1045
01:36:24,743 --> 01:36:26,954
What do you mean?
That matter just now.

1046
01:36:27,162 --> 01:36:29,206
We'll speak of this anon.

1047
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,458
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1048
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:33,877
A staunch friend.
You know me of old, Nance.

1049
01:36:34,419 --> 01:36:37,172
I know you well. Good night.

1050
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:44,012
Dodge...

1051
01:36:44,221 --> 01:36:46,098
pull it in.

1052
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:52,354
My glass is full already,
can't you see?

1053
01:36:58,485 --> 01:37:00,237
Trouble?

1054
01:37:03,824 --> 01:37:05,617
Dodger.

1055
01:37:08,787 --> 01:37:11,498
Let's find out where old Tom is, eh?
He's in the Ten Bells.

1056
01:37:11,665 --> 01:37:14,168
Shall we both take him home?

1057
01:37:14,668 --> 01:37:16,086
Honestly...

1058
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:18,922
I haven't seen her.

1059
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:21,842
Something up?

1060
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:26,054
I....

1061
01:37:27,639 --> 01:37:33,479
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

1062
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:36,273
What is it?
I ain't going near no police office.

1063
01:37:36,482 --> 01:37:39,985
That don't suit me, that don't.
There's not the smallest danger in it.

1064
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:43,322
Not the smallest.
I want someone dodged.

1065
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:46,033
Who, an old one?
Young one.

1066
01:37:46,241 --> 01:37:47,493
Who is she?
One of us.

1067
01:37:47,701 --> 01:37:49,203
Who?

1068
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:51,330
Nancy?

1069
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:55,584
What's she been up to?
Not sure she's been up to anything...

1070
01:37:55,793 --> 01:37:59,087
my dear, that's why
I want her dodged.

1071
01:38:01,089 --> 01:38:03,926
She may want to talk to people
she shouldn't want to talk to.

1072
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:09,097
I want to know where she goes,
who she sees, what she says.

1073
01:38:11,475 --> 01:38:13,227
Nancy.

1074
01:38:13,435 --> 01:38:16,063
I don't know. She's a good one,
is Nancy.

1075
01:38:16,271 --> 01:38:20,776
A pound, my dear.
One whole pound.

1076
01:39:01,066 --> 01:39:03,026
Mr. Brownlow?

1077
01:39:04,945 --> 01:39:06,613
Yes.

1078
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:12,911
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away. Follow me.

1079
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:29,428
This is far enough.

1080
01:39:29,636 --> 01:39:32,598
Why can't we speak up there?
I told you, I'm afraid.

1081
01:39:32,806 --> 01:39:34,933
I may be followed.

1082
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:41,023
I'm here because you told...

1083
01:39:41,231 --> 01:39:43,984
my housekeeper you have
information concerning Oliver Twist.

1084
01:39:44,193 --> 01:39:46,403
So I have.
Tell me.

1085
01:39:48,071 --> 01:39:49,698
He's being held by the devil...

1086
01:39:49,907 --> 01:39:54,411
and he's handing him over
to another what means to....

1087
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:57,039
I must know more.
Is it someone close to you?

1088
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:01,418
One is. One ain't.
These men, whoever they are...

1089
01:40:01,627 --> 01:40:04,171
must be delivered up by you.
Never.

1090
01:40:04,379 --> 01:40:09,468
Bad a life as he has led, I've led a bad
life too, and I will not turn upon him.

1091
01:40:10,093 --> 01:40:11,929
The other.

1092
01:40:12,638 --> 01:40:15,808
Fagin. He has the boy.
Fagin.

1093
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:17,434
Find Fagin, you'll find the boy.

1094
01:40:17,643 --> 01:40:20,020
Where is he?
Spitalfields.

1095
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:23,273
That's all I'll say.
I've said too much.

1096
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:25,609
No one must never know
who told you.

1097
01:40:25,818 --> 01:40:28,278
Promise.
I promise.

1098
01:40:28,487 --> 01:40:32,616
Tomorrow I'll go to the police.
No, you must do it tonight.

1099
01:40:32,825 --> 01:40:34,785
Just say Fagin,
and the traps will know.

1100
01:40:34,993 --> 01:40:38,038
The traps?
The police.

1101
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:41,500
What can I do to serve you?
Nothing.

1102
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:45,003
You can do nothing.
I am past all hope indeed.

1103
01:40:45,212 --> 01:40:47,297
Take this as a reward.

1104
01:40:47,506 --> 01:40:50,843
No, I've not done this for money.

1105
01:40:51,051 --> 01:40:52,469
God bless you.

1106
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:55,722
Good night. Good night.

1107
01:40:55,931 --> 01:40:58,851
Never-- Never say who told you.

1108
01:41:10,779 --> 01:41:11,989
Look at him.

1109
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:15,659
What a shame it is. With his face...

1110
01:41:15,868 --> 01:41:18,036
he could pick old ladies' pockets
in church.

1111
01:41:18,245 --> 01:41:21,665
His face could be a fortune to us.

1112
01:41:22,332 --> 01:41:24,334
You changing your mind?

1113
01:41:24,543 --> 01:41:26,170
No.

1114
01:41:26,753 --> 01:41:28,881
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1115
01:41:29,089 --> 01:41:31,008
Fagin! Fagin.

1116
01:41:36,388 --> 01:41:39,683
What's got into you, Dodger?
I have to see Fagin alone.

1117
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,560
No, no, you can speak
in front of Bill.

1118
01:41:41,768 --> 01:41:45,189
No, I can't.
Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger, tell us.

1119
01:41:45,397 --> 01:41:47,524
Nancy.
What about Nancy?

1120
01:41:47,733 --> 01:41:50,569
He done a bit of work for me, Bill.
I had him dodge Nancy.

1121
01:41:50,777 --> 01:41:52,362
What do you mean?

1122
01:41:52,571 --> 01:41:54,656
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1123
01:41:54,865 --> 01:41:57,034
Yes. To London Bridge.

1124
01:41:57,201 --> 01:41:59,578
And what?
What on London Bridge?

1125
01:41:59,912 --> 01:42:01,955
She met an old one. A gentleman.

1126
01:42:02,164 --> 01:42:03,874
And....
And?

1127
01:42:04,082 --> 01:42:06,168
Speak, will you?!

1128
01:42:07,044 --> 01:42:09,963
She peached.
She told him Fagin had Oliver.

1129
01:42:10,172 --> 01:42:14,176
And the old man was
to go to the traps. Now, tonight.

1130
01:42:20,224 --> 01:42:22,267
Let me go. Let me out!
Bill! Bill! A word--

1131
01:42:22,476 --> 01:42:26,688
Don't speak to me, it's not safe!
Hear me speak a word!

1132
01:42:27,022 --> 01:42:29,149
Bill, you won't be....

1133
01:42:30,108 --> 01:42:32,319
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1134
01:42:45,165 --> 01:42:46,542
Flit, boys, flit!

1135
01:42:46,750 --> 01:42:49,545
The traps will be at the door
afore you can say "Spitalfields."

1136
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:50,879
Flit! Flit! Flit!

1137
01:42:51,088 --> 01:42:52,673
Flit!

1138
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:54,842
Flit!

1139
01:42:55,092 --> 01:42:56,718
Flit!

1140
01:42:56,927 --> 01:42:58,720
Flit!

1141
01:42:59,847 --> 01:43:01,557
Flit!

1142
01:43:03,976 --> 01:43:05,644
Flit!

1143
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:34,423
Come on.

1144
01:44:00,115 --> 01:44:02,284
Oh, it's you.

1145
01:44:05,787 --> 01:44:07,372
Bill?

1146
01:44:07,581 --> 01:44:09,458
What's the matter?

1147
01:44:17,674 --> 01:44:20,302
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

1148
01:44:22,012 --> 01:44:24,097
There's enough light
for what I've gotta do.

1149
01:44:24,306 --> 01:44:26,767
What--? What have I done?

1150
01:44:27,476 --> 01:44:30,395
Speak to me.
You know.

1151
01:44:30,604 --> 01:44:32,981
You was watched tonight.

1152
01:44:33,398 --> 01:44:36,109
Every word you said was heard.

1153
01:44:38,278 --> 01:44:40,781
I-- I never said your name, Bill.

1154
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:42,282
Never.

1155
01:44:42,491 --> 01:44:43,659
Never.

1156
01:44:43,867 --> 01:44:45,911
Bill. Bill. Bill!

1157
01:44:48,121 --> 01:44:49,957
Oh, God.
Oh, God, have mercy!

1158
01:45:14,690 --> 01:45:16,608
Nance?

1159
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,073
Nance?

1160
01:45:44,678 --> 01:45:46,680
I haven't done nothing.

1161
01:45:46,889 --> 01:45:49,141
Go on, be off with you.

1162
01:46:12,581 --> 01:46:14,041
Hello, Fagey.

1163
01:46:14,249 --> 01:46:16,460
Hello, lads.

1164
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:20,380
What's the news, Toby?
What's the news?

1165
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:23,634
I have it here, Fagin.
It's all in The Chronicle.

1166
01:46:23,842 --> 01:46:27,221
You're in it. Bill's in it.
Oliver's in it.

1167
01:46:27,429 --> 01:46:28,597
The Chronicle?

1168
01:46:29,014 --> 01:46:32,351
Fancy that. You're famous, Fagin.

1169
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:33,560
Read it.

1170
01:46:33,769 --> 01:46:36,021
"More information has reached
your correspondent...

1171
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:39,066
concerning the foul
and bestial murder...

1172
01:46:39,274 --> 01:46:42,653
that took place in Spitalfields and
which has shocked and appalled...

1173
01:46:42,861 --> 01:46:44,071
the citizens of London.

1174
01:46:45,739 --> 01:46:48,867
It is believed that the victim,
a young woman...

1175
01:46:49,076 --> 01:46:51,161
now identified as Nancy...

1176
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:54,123
was brutally beaten to death...

1177
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:56,959
by one William Sykes...

1178
01:46:57,167 --> 01:47:00,087
a well-known, dangerous villain.

1179
01:47:00,295 --> 01:47:02,381
The motive is as yet unclear...

1180
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:05,384
but your correspondent has learned
that the murdered woman...

1181
01:47:05,592 --> 01:47:07,427
had informed on her associate...

1182
01:47:07,594 --> 01:47:10,597
and on an infamous fence, Fagin...

1183
01:47:11,557 --> 01:47:16,812
who is now wanted for the abduction
of a young boy, Oliver Twist.

1184
01:47:18,397 --> 01:47:21,525
Neither Fagin nor Sykes
are presently in custody...

1185
01:47:21,733 --> 01:47:24,361
but the police are engaged
in searching for them...

1186
01:47:24,570 --> 01:47:26,905
throughout the city and beyond.

1187
01:47:28,073 --> 01:47:30,075
Sykes, according to the police...

1188
01:47:30,284 --> 01:47:35,122
is usually accompanied
by a fierce white dog."

1189
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:39,126
How about that, eh?

1190
01:47:51,889 --> 01:47:54,892
Come. Come back here.

1191
01:47:58,061 --> 01:47:59,813
We're going back to London.

1192
01:48:01,982 --> 01:48:03,942
I'll have people to speak to.

1193
01:48:04,151 --> 01:48:07,905
I'll force shiners out of Fagin,
get to France.

1194
01:48:08,113 --> 01:48:09,114
Damn me, we'll risk it.

1195
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:16,079
Who's he done in?

1196
01:48:17,331 --> 01:48:20,667
They say-- They say it's a woman.
He's done in a woman?

1197
01:48:47,110 --> 01:48:49,029
Bullseye.

1198
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:52,741
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1199
01:48:53,242 --> 01:48:55,661
You gone deaf or something?

1200
01:48:56,537 --> 01:48:58,539
Come here. Come on.

1201
01:49:00,415 --> 01:49:03,335
I ain't gonna harm you. Come on.
Come on, Bullseye.

1202
01:49:04,336 --> 01:49:06,463
Come here.

1203
01:49:06,672 --> 01:49:09,591
Stop it! I'm warning you.

1204
01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:11,760
Let go, I ain't playing with you!

1205
01:49:11,969 --> 01:49:14,596
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1206
01:49:14,805 --> 01:49:16,682
Bullseye!

1207
01:49:22,312 --> 01:49:24,064
Bullseye. Bullseye.

1208
01:49:24,523 --> 01:49:26,733
Get back here. Get back here.

1209
01:49:29,027 --> 01:49:30,696
Damn it!

1210
01:49:36,118 --> 01:49:37,786
Look, it's his dog.

1211
01:49:37,995 --> 01:49:40,247
It's his dog!

1212
01:49:45,043 --> 01:49:46,378
Here, boy.

1213
01:49:46,587 --> 01:49:48,547
Here.
Don't go near him.

1214
01:49:54,845 --> 01:49:57,514
There is a child in danger,
lnspector Blathers...

1215
01:49:57,723 --> 01:49:59,224
but you only seem interested...

1216
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:01,477
in apprehending this man,
William Sykes.

1217
01:50:01,685 --> 01:50:03,270
Your concern should be...

1218
01:50:03,479 --> 01:50:05,689
for the safety of the boy.
Allow me to say...

1219
01:50:05,898 --> 01:50:08,442
this is our usual way
of doing business.

1220
01:50:09,610 --> 01:50:11,361
My thinking is this:

1221
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:14,323
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1222
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:16,200
And if we get Fagin--
Look.

1223
01:50:17,075 --> 01:50:20,037
Sir, we found the dog.

1224
01:50:22,206 --> 01:50:24,833
Are we going to sit here
waiting for the traps to find us?

1225
01:50:25,042 --> 01:50:28,128
Shut it.
No, he's right.

1226
01:50:28,337 --> 01:50:30,756
We should do another flit.

1227
01:50:33,383 --> 01:50:35,344
The traps!

1228
01:50:50,901 --> 01:50:52,152
What?

1229
01:50:52,611 --> 01:50:53,779
It's him.

1230
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:56,657
Don't let him in.
We must.

1231
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:00,410
Go on.

1232
01:51:02,579 --> 01:51:04,414
Go on!

1233
01:51:10,712 --> 01:51:13,215
Don't leave us in the dark.

1234
01:52:09,354 --> 01:52:11,482
Damn you all.

1235
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:14,735
Have you nothing to say to me?

1236
01:52:15,110 --> 01:52:19,907
Not safe for you to stop here, Bill.
lf it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1237
01:52:24,119 --> 01:52:25,579
Is it...?

1238
01:52:26,747 --> 01:52:28,290
The body, is it buried?

1239
01:52:36,632 --> 01:52:39,301
Dodger, let him in quick.

1240
01:52:41,595 --> 01:52:42,554
Dodger.

1241
01:52:43,806 --> 01:52:45,432
Do as I say.

1242
01:52:49,394 --> 01:52:51,647
Don't come near me, you monster.

1243
01:52:55,484 --> 01:52:57,611
You're my witnesses.
I'm not afraid of him.

1244
01:52:59,029 --> 01:53:01,490
And if they come here after him,
I'll give him up.

1245
01:53:01,698 --> 01:53:03,325
I'll tell them you're here.

1246
01:53:04,576 --> 01:53:07,955
He may kill me if he likes,
but if I'm here, I'll give him up.

1247
01:53:08,163 --> 01:53:10,749
If he was to be boiled alive,
so I would.

1248
01:53:10,958 --> 01:53:13,168
Why, you little--

1249
01:53:14,211 --> 01:53:15,671
Get off me!

1250
01:53:15,879 --> 01:53:17,673
Or I'll tear you limb from limb!

1251
01:53:23,804 --> 01:53:25,055
Help, he's here!

1252
01:53:25,264 --> 01:53:27,516
He's here. Break down the door!
Up at the window!

1253
01:53:27,724 --> 01:53:29,726
Help! Come up, please!

1254
01:53:32,020 --> 01:53:34,189
That's Bill Sykes!
Damn you all!

1255
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:36,441
Do your worst. I'll cheat you yet!

1256
01:53:47,911 --> 01:53:51,123
No! Bill, no.
He's our bargaining tool.

1257
01:53:51,331 --> 01:53:54,334
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1258
01:53:56,753 --> 01:53:58,338
Bill!

1259
01:54:09,558 --> 01:54:10,976
Don't fire.

1260
01:54:12,561 --> 01:54:14,480
Don't fire.
Hold your fire, men.

1261
01:54:14,688 --> 01:54:16,899
Hold your fire.
I'll let the boy go.

1262
01:54:17,107 --> 01:54:19,109
I'll let him drop.

1263
01:54:19,318 --> 01:54:21,778
Don't try nothing,
or I'll let him go!

1264
01:54:25,616 --> 01:54:27,534
Get up there.

1265
01:54:27,951 --> 01:54:30,037
Cross, cross.

1266
01:54:33,248 --> 01:54:36,919
Up there. Up there.

1267
01:54:40,881 --> 01:54:44,510
Grab hold of there.
Grab hold of it.

1268
01:54:53,727 --> 01:54:55,896
We must give chase, sir.

1269
01:55:07,366 --> 01:55:09,034
Get down.

1270
01:55:13,372 --> 01:55:14,832
They're getting away!

1271
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:17,084
There, there. There he is!

1272
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:19,419
Get him! Get him!

1273
01:55:19,628 --> 01:55:21,338
Damn it!

1274
01:55:54,663 --> 01:55:56,165
Grab it.

1275
01:55:56,373 --> 01:55:58,167
Grab it!

1276
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,165
Oliver?

1277
01:57:20,374 --> 01:57:22,084
Oliver!

1278
01:57:24,628 --> 01:57:26,672
Oliver!

1279
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:34,388
Here he is, sir.
Come along, my boy.

1280
01:57:34,555 --> 01:57:38,392
Mr. Grimwig has something
to say to you.

1281
01:57:39,601 --> 01:57:41,061
Do the honors, Mrs. Bedwin.

1282
01:57:41,270 --> 01:57:46,066
Now then, young man,
I confess I misjudged you.

1283
01:57:46,275 --> 01:57:50,237
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor
would make me eat my head.

1284
01:57:51,405 --> 01:57:54,533
But he's a good friend
and has pardoned me.

1285
01:57:54,741 --> 01:57:57,327
And one for Oliver.
Thank you, sir.

1286
01:57:57,536 --> 01:57:59,204
So--
And you too, Mrs. Bedwin.

1287
01:57:59,413 --> 01:58:01,248
I don't know as I should, sir.
You must.

1288
01:58:01,415 --> 01:58:06,170
So I'll take the liberty,
if you'll allow me, to salute you.

1289
01:58:06,962 --> 01:58:09,882
To Sam Waters.
Oliver Twist.

1290
01:58:10,257 --> 01:58:13,385
Oliver Twist. To Oliver Twist.

1291
01:58:14,178 --> 01:58:15,929
Yes.

1292
01:58:18,432 --> 01:58:22,853
Why, Oliver.
My child, what's the matter?

1293
01:58:23,437 --> 01:58:25,272
Why are you so sad?

1294
01:58:52,508 --> 01:58:55,219
Are you certain, Oliver,
you wish to go through with this?

1295
01:58:55,427 --> 01:58:57,095
Yes, sir.

1296
01:58:57,304 --> 01:58:59,181
Certain.

1297
01:59:05,145 --> 01:59:07,022
Yes?

1298
01:59:52,317 --> 01:59:55,362
Is the young gentleman
to come too, sir?

1299
01:59:55,612 --> 01:59:58,031
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1300
01:59:58,240 --> 02:00:01,535
It is not indeed, my friend.
But this child has seen this man...

1301
02:00:01,743 --> 02:00:03,996
in the full career
of his success and villainy.

1302
02:00:04,204 --> 02:00:07,249
And it is his wish, even at the cost
of some pain and fear...

1303
02:00:07,458 --> 02:00:09,835
that he should see him now.

1304
02:00:42,367 --> 02:00:44,161
Eighteen.

1305
02:00:59,343 --> 02:01:01,094
Hey!

1306
02:01:05,349 --> 02:01:06,600
Good boy.

1307
02:01:06,809 --> 02:01:08,644
Good boy, Charley.

1308
02:01:08,852 --> 02:01:10,813
Well done.

1309
02:01:18,403 --> 02:01:21,573
Good boy, Charley, well done.
Well done.

1310
02:01:21,907 --> 02:01:24,368
Take the boy away to bed.
Don't be frightened.

1311
02:01:24,535 --> 02:01:26,245
Fagin.

1312
02:01:26,537 --> 02:01:28,330
That's me. An old man, my lord.

1313
02:01:28,539 --> 02:01:31,125
A-- A very old-- Old man.

1314
02:01:31,708 --> 02:01:33,210
Someone here wants to see you.

1315
02:01:33,627 --> 02:01:35,295
Strike! Strike them all dead!
Easy.

1316
02:01:35,504 --> 02:01:37,422
What right have they to butcher me?

1317
02:01:37,631 --> 02:01:39,675
Speak to him now.
Quick, if you please.

1318
02:01:39,883 --> 02:01:41,885
For he grows worse
as the time goes on.

1319
02:01:44,054 --> 02:01:46,723
Fagin, you were kind to me.

1320
02:01:46,890 --> 02:01:48,267
Yes, yes.

1321
02:01:48,475 --> 02:01:50,144
I'll be kind again.

1322
02:01:50,352 --> 02:01:52,354
I'll be kind again.

1323
02:01:52,563 --> 02:01:54,982
I'll be kind again.

1324
02:02:00,237 --> 02:02:03,073
I'm not afraid.
Oliver!

1325
02:02:07,619 --> 02:02:11,081
Let-- Let me whisper to you.

1326
02:02:13,292 --> 02:02:16,003
You remember the box, Oliver?

1327
02:02:16,211 --> 02:02:19,298
With my pretty things
for my old age, Oliver?

1328
02:02:19,506 --> 02:02:22,676
It's hid a little way up the chimney
in the top front room.

1329
02:02:22,885 --> 02:02:25,053
It's yours, Oliver.

1330
02:02:25,262 --> 02:02:28,348
Yours, but we must talk.
Yes, yes.

1331
02:02:28,557 --> 02:02:31,059
But shall we say a prayer
together first?

1332
02:02:31,268 --> 02:02:32,478
Do.

1333
02:02:32,686 --> 02:02:36,231
Say only one, upon your knees,
with me...

1334
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:39,109
and we can talk all morning.

1335
02:02:39,735 --> 02:02:41,320
Outside. Outside.

1336
02:02:41,528 --> 02:02:44,281
You can say I've gone to sleep.
They'll believe you.

1337
02:02:44,490 --> 02:02:48,577
You can get me out. The pretty
things are yours, my dear, yours.

1338
02:02:48,786 --> 02:02:52,915
Oh, God, forgive this wretched man.
That's right, that's right.

1339
02:02:53,123 --> 02:02:54,333
That will help us on.

1340
02:02:54,541 --> 02:02:58,629
If-- lf-- lf-- If l...

1341
02:02:58,837 --> 02:03:03,300
shake and tremble as we pass
the gallows, don't-- Don't--

1342
02:03:03,717 --> 02:03:07,471
Don't you mind, hurry on.
Now, now, now.

1343
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:10,349
Have you more to say to him, sir?
Nothing more.

1344
02:03:10,557 --> 02:03:13,477
You'd better leave him.
Press on, press on, press on.

1345
02:03:13,644 --> 02:03:15,687
Press on, press on.

1346
02:03:15,896 --> 02:03:18,398
Softly. Softly. No, no!

1347
02:03:18,607 --> 02:03:19,942
It hurts!

1348
02:03:20,150 --> 02:03:22,152
Faster, faster!

1349
02:03:22,361 --> 02:03:24,321
Faster, faster!

1350
02:03:24,488 --> 02:03:28,408
Faster, faster, faster, faster!

1351
02:05:01,418 --> 02:05:05,339
THE END
