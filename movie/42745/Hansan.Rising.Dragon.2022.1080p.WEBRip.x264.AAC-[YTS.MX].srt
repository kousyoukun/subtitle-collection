3
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:51,802
I, Wakizaka, have defeated
Joseon's southern army,

4
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:56,723
achieving victory though far outnumbered.

5
00:00:56,807 --> 00:01:01,979
I have aided our northern advance,
securing Joseon's capital Hanyang.

6
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:07,943
Only Joseon's navy continues to resurface

7
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:11,989
on the southern coast.

8
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,284
I now set out to destroy them.

9
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,120
Lord Chancellor,

10
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:21,915
we will be ready for your arrival
as planned.

11
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,461
Bunroku year one, Wakizaka of Awaji.

12
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:38,390
WAE ENEMY (FOREIGN ISLANDS) BASE,
BUSANPO, GYEONGSANG-DO, JUNE 1592

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,883
Thank you.

14
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,286
WAKIZAKA YASUHARU

15
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,996
Bokkaisen (sea monster)?

16
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:46,500
Dono. (lord)

17
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,586
Our foe Yi Sun-shin built a new ship.

18
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,547
It looked menacing,

19
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,174
just like a Bokkaisen,

20
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,593
the mythical sea monster.

21
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,389
Our guns were useless.

22
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,809
It had a dragon head spouting fire.

23
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,856
We were struck by sheer terror.

24
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,283
Bokkaisen, you say.

25
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,254
Fear is a contagion.

26
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:55,777
Was the ship rammed?

27
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:59,114
Wrecked off the Sacheon coast.

28
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,490
We hauled it here.

29
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,180
A MONTH AGO, SACHEON
GYEONGSANG-DO, SOUTHEAST JOSEON

30
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:12,354
CHIEF LEE EON-RYANG
Row backward!

31
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,439
We must break loose!

32
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,942
Row backward!

33
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,204
CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

34
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:41,008
Prepare to fire the dragon head
and all front cannons at once!

35
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,467
Load them now!

36
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,055
Fire!

37
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,775
It's the Bokkaisen!

38
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,323
Fire!

39
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:50,137
BUSAN FORTRESS

40
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,722
ON APRIL 13, 1592,

41
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,349
BUSAN FORTRESS WAS ATTACKED
BY WAE INVADERS.

42
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:56,602
HANYANG

43
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,854
WAE FORCES OVERTOOK BUSAN FORTRESS,

44
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,773
OCCUPYING JOSEON'S CAPITAL HANYANG
IN 20 DAYS.

45
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,484
PYEONGYANG

46
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:09,740
KING SEONJO FLED NORTH TO PYEONGYANG
AS THE WAE INVADERS SWEPT NORTHWARD.

47
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:11,867
GWANGGYOSAN

48
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,162
50,000 SOLDIERS FROM THE PROVINCES JEOLLA,
GYEONGSANG, AND CHUNGCHEONG

49
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,749
GATHERED AT GWANGGYOSAN MOUNTAIN
TO RECAPTURE THE CAPITAL HANYANG.

50
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,792
GWANGGYOSAN MOUNTAIN, YONGIN

51
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,754
BUT ON JUNE 5, 1592,

52
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:29,843
WAKIZAKA AMBUSHED WITH 2,000 MEN,
DESTROYING JOSEON'S ARMY.

53
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:39,770
JOSEON APPEARED TO BE
ON THE BRINK OF RUIN.

54
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,192
MEANWHILE, ON THE SOUTHERN COAST
OF GOSEONG, GYEONGSANG-DO,

55
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,236
20 WAE SHIPS WERE DESTROYED AT DANGHANGPO

56
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,197
AS THE LEFT JEOLLA NAVY ADMIRAL
YI SUN-SHIN BATTLED ALONE AT SEA.

57
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:55,953
IN HIS FIRST NAVAL CAMPAIGN
ACROSS OKPO, HAPPO, AND JEOKJINPO,

58
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,121
HE DESTROYED 42 WAE SHIPS.

59
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:05,045
BATTLING IN HIS SECOND CAMPAIGN
ACROSS SACHEON, DANGPO, DANGHANPO,

60
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,048
HE SUFFERED AN EARLY GUNSHOT WOUND.

61
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:15,722
HANSAN: RISING DRAGON

62
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:34,199
FIVE DAYS TILL THE THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

63
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,957
The turtle ship...

64
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,805
Admiral. Sergeant Song reporting.

65
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,391
Admiral Won has arrived.

66
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,311
SERGEANT SONG HUI-RIP
I'll get ready. Send in the servant.

67
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,478
Yes, sir.

68
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,609
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS, YEOSU

69
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,821
What? A preemptive strike?

70
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,240
RIGHT GYEONGSANG NAVY, ADMIRAL WON GYUN
Have you gone mad?

71
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:18,660
COMMANDER JUNG UN
We must hasten to recapture Busan.

72
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:22,331
Now is our time to catch
the Wae invaders off guard.

73
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,374
We must strike first.

74
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,671
Minor victories are useless
unless we attack their main base.

75
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,007
Well, well...

76
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,637
You're still drunk
on those minor victories.

77
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,058
The enemy general in Busan led
the Battle of Gwanggyosan in Yongin.

78
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,603
Do you not recall
Chief Commander Lee Gwang,

79
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,981
who attacked the enemy
at Gwanggyosan Mountain?

80
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,192
His men were annihilated!

81
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,862
He is blamed for the defeat,
deemed a traitor.

82
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,990
There is a tide of war.

83
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,410
We must defend, not attack!

84
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,625
Tell me. Do you agree with him?

85
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,671
Or have your underlings gone mad?

86
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,589
- Watch your words!
- Underlings?

87
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,883
Admiral Won,

88
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:17,135
RIGHT JEOLLA NAVY, ADMIRAL LEE EOK-GI
do you have a better idea?

89
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,806
Defense! Ironclad defense!

90
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,474
With an ironclad barrier on the sea,

91
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,519
we'll defend
the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

92
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:28,355
I'll burn down the provisional
Right Gyeongsang Navy Headquarters,

93
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,940
joining you here instead.

94
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,653
With our joint fleet
fending off the enemy,

95
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,907
won't our headquarters here be
a steely fortress?

96
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,131
RIGHT GYEONGSANG NAVY
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

97
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,093
An elder such as yourself
need not see me out.

98
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,554
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY, COMMANDER EO YOUNG-DAM
Since you're a former cadet

99
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,806
now busy as a commander,

100
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,976
this is an old teacher's chance

101
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,062
to enjoy rare company.

102
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,857
You're in good spirits as always.

103
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,734
And in good health, it seems.

104
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,611
By no means.

105
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,740
I'm suffering under a dreadful superior.

106
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:24,870
But you're no stranger
to dreadful superiors.

107
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,331
Alas, we suffer alike.

108
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,003
Good night, sir.

109
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:49,603
WAE (FOREIGN ISLANDS) ENEMY BASE,
BUSANPO, GYEONSANG-DO

110
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,900
The lord chancellor has

111
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,610
high hopes for you.

112
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,195
You are welcome here,

113
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,696
advisor.

114
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,658
I saw your men looking busy.

115
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,202
Isn't it too soon for haste?

116
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,916
KURODA KANBEI
LORD CHANCELLOR'S ADVISOR

117
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,002
Here.

118
00:13:14,086 --> 00:13:17,923
The lord chancellor sends his reply.

119
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:37,109
In the Battle of Yongin
at Gwanggyosan Mountain,

120
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:41,154
do you know how I destroyed 50,000 men
with only 2,000?

121
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,739
Why,

122
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:49,621
you caught them unawares
with a preemptive ambush.

123
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,126
YEOSU
Yi Sun-shin's headquarters here

124
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,170
must be struck down immediately.

125
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,130
And then...

126
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,465
Then?

127
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:07,472
We must reinforce Konishi's division
up north in Pyeongyang.

128
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,141
Once we do,

129
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:13,312
our conquest of Joseon shall be complete.

130
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:15,314
Impressive.

131
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,066
Worthy of the lord chancellor's
preeminent warrior.

132
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,360
Konishi up north in Pyeongyang

133
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,863
will be beholden to you,
bowing in gratitude.

134
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:27,659
I thought you might hasten
like the other generals

135
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:31,288
straight to Ming China.

136
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,999
I was concerned.

137
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,420
No doubt, you also crave

138
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,840
the conquest of Ming China.

139
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:43,091
However,

140
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,179
I advise against a solo campaign.

141
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,849
As things now stand,
there is no need for risk.

142
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,522
Better to lead a joint campaign
at full force.

143
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,774
I understand.

144
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,567
Hence,

145
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,861
I have a request.

146
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,864
About Kato, I presume?

147
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,662
TURTLE SHIP DOCKYARD
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS

148
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,039
You're removing the dragon head?

149
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,960
Since the Battle of Sacheon,
I've been thinking.

150
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,755
I stayed up nights
unable to shake the belief

151
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,173
that you need the turtle ship.

152
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:27,135
Will it no longer get lodged upon ramming?

153
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,849
It's the only way to solve that problem.

154
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:37,646
Will it also improve its speed?

155
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,189
Indeed, sir.

156
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,819
A headless turtle ship...

157
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,163
Have you heard?

158
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,250
The latest Wae invaders to arrive
in Busan...

159
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,463
I hear they're quite formidable.

160
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,926
How is Admiral Yi's order coming along?

161
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,595
Well...

162
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,388
GUNNERY MASTER
LEE BONG-SU

163
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,056
...we're gathering

164
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,684
all the gunpower ingredients we can,
sourcing it from the people.

165
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,812
But the turtle ships guzzle so much.

166
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,772
Gunpowder-guzzling monsters, they are.

167
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,694
The turtle ships can join
the admiral's fleet

168
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,321
only if you make haste.

169
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,575
The ramming ships must do more than ram.

170
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,160
Right.

171
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,747
By the way,

172
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,959
this is for you.

173
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,671
What's this?

174
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,925
I caught the critter myself.

175
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:52,095
If you ever get lonely or discouraged,
it can cheer you up.

176
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,182
- Mocking me, are you?
- Take it easy.

177
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,145
Cook a turtle soup for your health
if you'd like.

178
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,566
Before you become a shell of a man.

179
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,152
That impudence.

180
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,870
Defense! Ironclad defense!

181
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,873
We must defend, not attack!

182
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,630
I have a letter from Jeonju Fortress
sent by Chief Commander Lee Gwang.

183
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,595
He was pained

184
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,975
to recall his defeat
at Gwanggyosan Mountain.

185
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,686
The enemy Wakizaka

186
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,398
did not stay behind
to guard Suwon Fortress.

187
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:49,027
Instead, he advanced
to Yongin's Gwanggyosan Mountain,

188
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:52,030
tiring and luring our troops.

189
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,826
When our men lowered their guard,

190
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,246
setting up camp in an open field,

191
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,543
Wakizaka ambushed at dawn,
annihilating our army.

192
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,299
His stronghold was defended

193
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,635
without a defensive strategy.

194
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,141
Admiral Yi.

195
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,855
His Majesty sends word.

196
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,827
What has happened?

197
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,040
We received word from Pyeongyang.

198
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,920
HIS MAJESTY HAS DEPARTED TO UIJU
BY THE NORTHWEST BORDER.

199
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,383
How could he forsake Pyeongyang Fortress?

200
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,886
There is more at stake than Pyeongyang.

201
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,765
We must ask why His Majesty left for Uiju

202
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,517
by the northwest border.

203
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,812
The Chief Commander preferred
the northeast province Hamgyeong-do

204
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,398
as a defensible base,

205
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,027
but His Majesty chose Uiju
by the northwest border instead.

206
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,155
Will His Majesty

207
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,824
seek refuge westward in Ming China?

208
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,994
That cannot be.

209
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,123
It will destroy the people's morale

210
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,293
and threaten the fate of our land.

211
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,926
Based on our training
with Joseon prisoners,

212
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,097
Joseon's navy cannons reach a firing range
of 1,000 yards.

213
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,141
They are destructive within 500 yards.

214
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:47,688
WATANABE SHICHIEMON
They aim accurately within 100 yards.

215
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,316
One hundred yards.

216
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,486
Their panokseon (Joseon warships)

217
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,155
have a strange way of reloading cannons.

218
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,532
How so?

219
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,785
Instead of reloading,
they rotate their ships,

220
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,997
firing from the other side.

221
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,750
Interesting.

222
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,712
However,

223
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,715
even if their panokseon ships refire
faster that way,

224
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,718
we can press with speed
from 200 yards away,

225
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,511
overtaking their ships.

226
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,139
From 200 yards,

227
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,057
overtaking them.

228
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,605
Dono.

229
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,857
We must ambush again.

230
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,483
MANABE SAMANOSUKE
Deploy the fleet at once.

231
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:37,988
If they block us,

232
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:44,328
we will crush that troublesome thing.

233
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,921
You mean the sea monster Bokkaisen,

234
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,634
or rather their mekurabune (blind ship)?

235
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,469
Mekurabune.

236
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,888
Blind ship.

237
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,476
I like that name better than Bokkaisen.

238
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,355
The mekurabune fought only one battle.

239
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,981
But why?

240
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,068
Why won't they battle with a ship

241
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,612
rumored to be a monstrous Bokkaisen?

242
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:23,575
Sahei.

243
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,036
You have two days.

244
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,872
Go scout the Left Jeolla Navy.

245
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,334
Find out about the mekurabune.

246
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,169
Also,

247
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,048
about Yi Sun-shin.

248
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,224
Watanabe.

249
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,436
About Kobayakawa
leading the sixth division

250
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,605
in Geumsan near Jeolla-do.

251
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,319
I must send word to him.

252
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,365
Admiral.

253
00:22:03,866 --> 00:22:05,158
Admiral Yi.

254
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,664
Our headquarters here might be
His Majesty's last refuge.

255
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,666
Instead of rushing to battle,

256
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,878
perhaps we should guard this place
as Admiral Won suggested.

257
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,508
Will you still attack

258
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,386
the Wae invaders' base at Busan Fortress?

259
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,189
Does it look so in your eyes?

260
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,903
Is it not so?

261
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:43,655
Perhaps it is.

262
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,576
But as Admiral Won has said,

263
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,579
we're on the defensive.

264
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,209
An attack on Busan requires caution.

265
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,128
If you will neither defend nor attack,

266
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,881
what is your battle plan?

267
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,595
Perhaps

268
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,890
our next battle will determine

269
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,187
the fate of this war.

270
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:35,666
HEUNGGUKSA TEMPLE REFUGE
Rice balls!

271
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,834
Rice!

272
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,087
Please have some food.

273
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,019
I saw that man at Busan Fortress.

274
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,364
Interesting.

275
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,867
- Be careful.
- All right.

276
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,019
I have received your letter.

277
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,396
I appreciate the offer,

278
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:44,776
but as commander of the sixth division,

279
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,739
I, Kobayakawa, will attack Jeonju Fortress
as planned.

280
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:52,910
Now that Geumsan Fortress is cleared
of the Joseon people's militia,

281
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:56,747
I can soon advance on Jeonju Fortress
in Jeolla-do.

282
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,758
Transcribe my reply.

283
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,306
Instead of attacking Jeonju Fortress
with the sixth division,

284
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,851
I ask you to strike Yi Sun-shin's
Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

285
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:21,980
Do so, and I will grant you
all my conquests in Jeolla-do.

286
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:26,401
The war's outcome depends on
the Left Jeolla Navy, not Jeonju Fortress.

287
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:29,696
Now, join me in this attack,

288
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,157
which will please the lord chancellor.

289
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,499
Dono.

290
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,086
Will you grant Kobayakawa
all of Jeolla-do?

291
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,005
Yi is a mere hindrance we can defeat
without his help.

292
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,382
A mere hindrance?

293
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,346
How will you defeat Yi?

294
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,141
By catching him off guard
with a preemptive strike!

295
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,810
As we did at Gwanggyosan!

296
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,728
Let's stay one step ahead.

297
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,438
We'll defeat him also on land.

298
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,859
It's a plan for total victory,
which I have while Yi doesn't.

299
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:10,153
- But we're ready--
- Joseon will fall soon.

300
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,948
The war will shift to Ming China.

301
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,158
By reaching Ming first,

302
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,786
we will conquer much more.

303
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,664
Jeolla-do pales in comparison.

304
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,083
Do you not understand?

305
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,459
But

306
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,672
will Kato's fleet arrive in time?

307
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:32,426
Kanbei is a man of his word.

308
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,927
He will make it happen.

309
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:41,476
Why did your men at Sacheon join
the division at Geumsan near Jeolla?

310
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:45,397
Will they deploy from Geumsan
to attack Jeonju Fortress?

311
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,399
When will they strike?

312
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,067
I know nothing.

313
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,360
Nothing at all.

314
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:52,029
Nothing.

315
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,662
You fools!

316
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,457
Jeonju Fortress matters little.

317
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,668
Our Wae army is gathering

318
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,712
in great numbers in Busan.

319
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:12,549
Joseon will be annihilated

320
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:15,260
on our way to Ming China and India.

321
00:27:15,344 --> 00:27:19,056
You should beg for your lives!

322
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:43,705
Who are you?

323
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,754
- Admiral!
- Admiral!

324
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:52,005
Why, you!

325
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:53,590
How dare you!

326
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:00,848
Dono!

327
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,225
What have they done to him?

328
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,102
Are you alright?

329
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,728
Dono!

330
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:18,949
You're the reason we endure.

331
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,787
You're a hero to us all!

332
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,963
Do not take his life.

333
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,966
I sense he has a veiled purpose.

334
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,374
This war...

335
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,878
What is it about?

336
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,174
I beseech you to tell me.

337
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,052
What is this war?

338
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,725
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

339
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:33,106
Not a battle of nations?

340
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:36,610
No.

341
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,922
I shot you at Sacheon.

342
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,635
I saw with my own eyes

343
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,849
how you stepped forth
to save your soldier.

344
00:30:11,687 --> 00:30:13,438
But my commander

345
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,400
used us men as shields

346
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,570
to save himself.

347
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,662
Please. Let me serve you.

348
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,682
NOKDUNDO ISLAND,
HAMGYEONG-DO (NORTHEAST BORDER)

349
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:22,818
Why did I dream of this?

350
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:57,352
His stronghold was defended

351
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,231
without a defensive strategy.

352
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,031
Defended

353
00:33:09,114 --> 00:33:12,492
without a defensive strategy.

354
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:34,932
THREE DAYS TILL THE THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

355
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:48,445
Is this formation defensive? Or offensive?

356
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,450
Surely defensive.
Like a barrier on the sea.

357
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,370
A barrier on the sea?

358
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,872
Over there,

359
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,875
we're simulating the Wae invaders' attack.

360
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,973
It's quite realistic.

361
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,232
Crane wing formation.

362
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:26,567
Yes, Admiral.

363
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:32,114
Crane wing formation!

364
00:34:32,197 --> 00:34:33,907
Crane wing formation!

365
00:34:41,874 --> 00:34:44,376
We must move to the left wing.

366
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:45,460
Yes, sir.

367
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:48,463
To the right wing's center.

368
00:34:48,547 --> 00:34:49,715
On the double.

369
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:50,883
Yes, sir.

370
00:35:12,446 --> 00:35:14,156
We're colliding!

371
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:17,075
Watch your position!

372
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:20,913
Go farther left!

373
00:35:20,996 --> 00:35:23,582
We're due at the left wing's center!

374
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,838
The right wing looks unsteady.

375
00:35:30,881 --> 00:35:33,967
Never mind. We'll go head-on.

376
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,230
- Raise the ladders.
- Raise them!

377
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,485
Rotate the ship.

378
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:52,986
Rotate!

379
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,239
Port oars, stop!

380
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,493
Rotate!

381
00:35:59,701 --> 00:36:02,829
Starboard oars, row faster!

382
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,881
Back to formation!

383
00:36:12,965 --> 00:36:14,967
Back to formation!

384
00:36:32,693 --> 00:36:34,403
- Rotate.
- Rotate!

385
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:35,863
Rotate!

386
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,782
Port oars, stop! Rotate!

387
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,725
Sir, we can't rotate
within such short distance.

388
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:09,146
Not with Admiral Won's ships
that lack training.

389
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,026
Keep him in the formation.

390
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,696
And deliver this to Admiral Lee Eok-gi.

391
00:37:19,156 --> 00:37:20,324
Yes, sir.

392
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:26,079
Rotate the ship!

393
00:37:40,344 --> 00:37:41,512
Reporting, sir.

394
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,680
Since the Battle of Sacheon,

395
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:45,599
the mekurabune was never seen in training.

396
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:53,065
There must be a problem
with the mekurabune.

397
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,817
We must find out what it is.

398
00:37:58,278 --> 00:38:00,572
We'll enter their headquarters.

399
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,074
Let's move.

400
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:12,167
- Fire!
- What do you want?

401
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:21,051
- Who are you?
- We're on your side.

402
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:32,688
The prisoners' cells are on fire!

403
00:38:32,771 --> 00:38:35,649
The prisoners are escaping! After them!

404
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:21,653
No wonder you looked murderous for a monk.

405
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,864
Catch them! Catch the prisoners!

406
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,414
The turtle ship is in flames!

407
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,750
Put out the fire! Now!

408
00:39:56,605 --> 00:39:57,606
Follow me.

409
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:15,123
You call yourselves officers in charge?

410
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:17,584
It's your duty to guard the turtle ship!

411
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,504
At all times with no exception!

412
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:22,047
This is a failure in duty!

413
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:34,518
Admiral. I'm afraid the head spy escaped.

414
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,103
We've failed you, sir.

415
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:38,272
Move! Hurry up!

416
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,732
Hurry up!

417
00:40:40,816 --> 00:40:41,859
Admiral.

418
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:45,112
A few prisoners are missing.

419
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:48,156
Hurry up!

420
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,912
- Admiral.
- Any damages to the turtle ship?

421
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,415
CHIEF LEE GI-NAM
Some scorches. Nothing serious.

422
00:40:56,498 --> 00:41:01,295
The head spy stole
the turtle ship's construction plans.

423
00:41:05,966 --> 00:41:07,509
Where is Chief Nah?

424
00:41:07,801 --> 00:41:11,096
At the Suncheon dockyard
since two days ago.

425
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:13,056
Let us go there.

426
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,532
SECRET DOCKYARD, SUNCHEON, NEAR YEOSU

427
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,370
This turtle ship has to be better!

428
00:41:35,996 --> 00:41:37,956
Seal that joint!

429
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,254
Admiral! Admiral.

430
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,258
I heard about the spies.

431
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:52,471
I'm relieved
that the turtle ships weren't damaged.

432
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:55,682
I am told
you're reattaching the dragon head.

433
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,228
Yes, sir.

434
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:03,941
We must wage battle soon.

435
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:09,947
Will this turtle ship be ready?

436
00:42:10,614 --> 00:42:12,533
We're working night and day.

437
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:15,327
We need a few more days.

438
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,333
The spies escaped

439
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:23,961
with your construction plans.

440
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:28,298
Wakizaka will learn
about the turtle ship's weaknesses.

441
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:30,592
Admiral.

442
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,637
This new turtle ship is different.

443
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:42,604
I will fight this battle
without turtle ships.

444
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,151
I must leave now.

445
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,531
Admiral.

446
00:42:57,327 --> 00:43:00,247
The sides look weak.

447
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,711
Good for firing cannons
but exposed to attack.

448
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,421
Also,

449
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,717
the head and cover must be heavy.

450
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,053
I wonder if it can sail with any speed.

451
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,434
Junsa, was it?

452
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,147
So you fought against the ship.

453
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,859
Yes, at the Battle of Sacheon.

454
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,487
Indeed, its movement seemed quite slow.

455
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,114
Go on.

456
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:35,824
At Sacheon,

457
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:38,327
we fell for Yi's luring tactic.

458
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:39,995
Luring tactic?

459
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,580
Yes, sir.

460
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:43,790
However,

461
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,959
as you pointed out,

462
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:49,379
we could've easily destroyed the ship

463
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:53,342
had we been prepared.

464
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,763
Once it rammed into our warship,

465
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,890
the dragon head was lodged,
unable to move.

466
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,142
The dragon head was lodged?

467
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,227
Yes, sir.

468
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:09,900
So, that was the flaw.

469
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,239
A flawed ram.

470
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,743
And yet,

471
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:24,289
it was called the Bokkaisen,
striking terror in our men.

472
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:30,671
Are you implying it was a false rumor?

473
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:35,926
Watanabe.

474
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,011
What do you think?

475
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,514
Since it was absent from training,

476
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,559
it probably won't be deployed.

477
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,894
However, I'm concerned

478
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:49,815
by Sahei's report
regarding their crane wing formation.

479
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,862
It appears to be an offensive.

480
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,906
I suspect they will surround Busanpo
to mount an attack.

481
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,449
No, sir.

482
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,827
Yi was using prisoners

483
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,997
to prepare defensive tactics.

484
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,083
Besides, without the mekurabune,

485
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,626
he cannot risk an attack.

486
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,629
Dono. These are baseless claims.

487
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:13,797
Enough.

488
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,133
Junsa.

489
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,928
Come closer.

490
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:31,773
Closer.

491
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:45,871
Justify your claim.

492
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:54,880
Even their king has fled

493
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,966
to the northwest border.

494
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,845
Hence, Yi will be looking to retreat.

495
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,806
He wouldn't dare advance in attack.

496
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,735
I must say,

497
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,780
it's decent reasoning.

498
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:35,337
Dono. Kato's fleet has arrived.

499
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:57,901
Arriving at the perfect time.

500
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:09,955
KATO YOSHIAKI

501
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,836
KUKI YOSHITAKA

502
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,009
The war god Hachiman

503
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,554
shines on me again.

504
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,118
Admiral!

505
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,123
Can you win your battle
without the turtle ship?

506
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:59,505
Can you truly win without the turtle ship?

507
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:20,901
Your wound has yet to heal.
Yet you're shooting arrows already.

508
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:30,994
Admiral.

509
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,414
I'm convinced by our training

510
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:37,417
that we need the turtle ships.

511
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,546
Do you not agree?

512
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:45,467
Admiral.

513
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:51,932
Sir,

514
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,894
Lim Jun-young brought his report
in person.

515
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,231
In person?

516
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:04,027
Until now, Wakizaka's fleet

517
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:07,030
had 30 large ships, 70 medium ships,

518
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,283
One hundred ships total.

519
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,244
Kato Yoshiaki's fleet
from the southern island Daemado

520
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,247
has now joined him
with 20 large ships and 20 small ships.

521
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,666
That makes 140 ships total.

522
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:21,128
Wakizaka's wait is over.
He will deploy soon.

523
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,504
The time has arrived.

524
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:23,672
But sir,

525
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:26,800
Kato's ships are unique.

526
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,385
Unique?

527
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,014
Several large ships have thicker hulls

528
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,601
and suspended cannons
we haven't seen before.

529
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:38,103
As for their flagship,

530
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:42,441
it's armed with cannons
and covered in iron plates.

531
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:46,153
A flagship covered in iron plates?

532
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:48,655
It is as expected.

533
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:53,744
They prepared
against our cannons and rams.

534
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:55,204
This enemy fleet...

535
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:58,749
COMMANDER GWON JUN
...will attack to secure a supply route

536
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,084
to the western coast.

537
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:03,170
The enemy's ground troops are gathered...

538
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,756
COMMANDER SHIN HO
...at Geumsan near Jeonju Fortress.

539
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,716
They will fight on two fronts at sea
and on land.

540
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,887
They will attack both Jeonju Fortress
and the Left Jeolla Navy.

541
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,473
If our navy falls as the enemy wishes,

542
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:17,017
Joseon's regime in Uiju will also fall.

543
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,317
We will surely face attack,
but Jeonju is under greater threat.

544
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,444
The Battle of Yongin has left

545
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:31,448
Chief Commander Lee Gwang
crippled by defeat.

546
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:36,578
In any case,
we must alert Jeonju Fortress.

547
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:40,499
Shouldn't we split our forces
to reinforce the army at Jeonju Fortress?

548
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:44,294
Have you gone mad?
We cannot split the navy.

549
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,213
Out of the question!

550
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,966
Hold your anger. I merely speak as I must.

551
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,342
Enough.

552
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:54,930
Admiral Yi.

553
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,641
How will you proceed?

554
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,294
The time has come for a critical battle.

555
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:27,546
Hence...

556
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,804
tomorrow at midnight,
we shall set out to war.

557
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:37,973
Prepare for deployment.

558
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,725
Instead of defending?

559
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,659
Load the shells and gunpowder!

560
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,828
Careful!

561
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,750
As ordered,

562
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,960
GUNNERY MASTER LEE BONG-SU
we stockpiled all the gunpowder we could.

563
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,295
Well done.

564
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,965
Why do you need more than usual?

565
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:14,968
For double-loading cannons

566
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:20,474
with both shells and shrapnel shells.

567
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:26,605
That will cause damage
only within short range.

568
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,066
- The enemy ships will close in--
- Noted.

569
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,070
Is Chief Nah on his way?

570
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,062
Let's enjoy this drink together.

571
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:12,818
By the way,

572
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,029
what kind of man is this Admiral Yi?

573
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:19,199
A surprisingly strong foe.

574
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:22,494
That is why we must face him together.

575
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:27,082
Joseon's commanders have been weak,
I heard.

576
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,711
Yi must be the exception.

577
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:35,174
Now that two war heroes have
joined us here,

578
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,177
Yi will not stand a chance.

579
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:43,390
This dull war will end sooner
than expected.

580
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,313
Dono.

581
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,691
We received word
from Kobayakawa's sixth division.

582
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,284
Everyone out.

583
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,661
Everyone out.

584
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:09,333
Dither at your peril if you wish to die!

585
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,461
Hurry up!

586
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:22,721
Kobayakawa agreed to the inland attack
against the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

587
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,431
In that case,

588
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:26,892
when will he deploy?

589
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:28,018
He asked

590
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:31,647
that you decide when and send your reply.

591
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,317
If so,

592
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,070
we set out tonight at midnight.

593
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:41,782
Absurd!

594
00:54:42,074 --> 00:54:45,035
You can't do so without consulting me!

595
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:48,872
Wakizaka, please reconsider.

596
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:51,458
For procedure's sake.

597
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:54,294
We must attack
before the typhoon season arrives.

598
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,004
Pardon the haste.

599
00:54:56,505 --> 00:54:57,673
You scoundrel!

600
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,135
Stop!

601
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,228
Your crude manner will cost you
my alliance.

602
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:14,481
You take war too lightly, Wakizaka!

603
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,695
Don't be rash,

604
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:21,488
Kato.

605
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:23,782
Sit down.

606
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:25,492
Calm down.

607
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:28,328
Kato. Put down your sword.

608
00:55:31,665 --> 00:55:33,333
I demand an answer.

609
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:34,793
Tell me.

610
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:37,212
Do you wish to join forces with me or not?

611
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:42,050
Our dislike is mutual.

612
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:43,802
However,

613
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,890
the lord chancellor ordered
our joint attack.

614
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,268
Withdraw your sword,

615
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,813
and I'll overlook this outburst.

616
00:55:58,567 --> 00:55:59,693
Kato.

617
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:11,371
Kato!

618
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:52,287
You can come out now.

619
00:57:02,965 --> 00:57:05,300
Thank you. I heard crucial information.

620
00:57:05,384 --> 00:57:07,636
I must report back at once
to the Left Jeolla Navy.

621
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:18,146
I've been watching you.

622
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,108
So that wench slipped you in.

623
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:29,324
Remarkable.

624
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:33,453
Even the courtesans are spies.

625
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:36,623
What a disappointment.

626
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,377
I'd hoped to take you with me.

627
00:57:51,763 --> 00:57:53,182
Die!

628
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:54,892
Dono!

629
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:01,690
Stand back!

630
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,692
Run!

631
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,119
Sahei!

632
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:16,038
After him! Now!

633
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:17,456
You stay here!

634
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,459
Follow me, Manabe!

635
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,051
How much does he know?

636
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:30,677
Tell me.

637
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:36,892
There he is! By the shore!

638
00:58:37,851 --> 00:58:39,061
- Hurry.
- After him.

639
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:40,812
Get in.

640
00:58:47,402 --> 00:58:48,487
Fire!

641
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,665
Aim the fire arrows!

642
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,250
Release!

643
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:07,297
Release!

644
00:59:17,766 --> 00:59:18,725
No.

645
00:59:19,726 --> 00:59:21,311
Not until you spill everything you know.

646
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:31,154
Dono, We've failed you.

647
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:33,365
Please take our lives.

648
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:37,369
Hunt down all the spies.

649
00:59:38,036 --> 00:59:39,246
Also,

650
00:59:40,372 --> 00:59:41,748
keep her alive.

651
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:59,516
Please! I'm no spy!

652
01:00:00,225 --> 01:00:01,935
I'm not!

653
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:12,779
Perhaps now is the time

654
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:16,116
to break with the past,

655
01:00:17,326 --> 01:00:19,953
tying up all loose ends.

656
01:00:20,954 --> 01:00:23,040
Please don't kill me!

657
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:24,082
Strike!

658
01:00:35,427 --> 01:00:38,430
DAY ONE, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

659
01:00:47,648 --> 01:00:51,068
We've reached Dangpo, our midway stopover.
Report to Admiral Yi.

660
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:52,361
Yes, sir.

661
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:28,355
We're allies! Stop!

662
01:01:28,564 --> 01:01:29,815
Kill him, too!

663
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:37,406
Wakizaka!

664
01:02:06,602 --> 01:02:07,895
Tell me.

665
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:10,147
Who is backing you?

666
01:02:10,439 --> 01:02:12,232
Is it Kanbei?

667
01:02:13,025 --> 01:02:15,402
Given our mutual hatred,

668
01:02:15,485 --> 01:02:17,988
you and I will only clash
if we join forces.

669
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,033
Surrender your ships and begone.

670
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:22,743
Do so,

671
01:02:24,036 --> 01:02:26,205
and I'll let you live.

672
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:31,293
You expect to steal my iron-plated ship
without retribution?

673
01:02:39,551 --> 01:02:41,178
Mark my words.

674
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:43,055
I will repay this insult.

675
01:02:50,854 --> 01:02:52,898
Now I know.

676
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:57,069
From the start, you had this planned.

677
01:02:57,444 --> 01:03:00,197
But my ships won't matter.

678
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,830
Begone if you care to live!

679
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:33,272
Summoned by the lord chancellor,

680
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,858
I've returned to Osaka Castle.

681
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:39,653
Wakizaka, you shall now demolish
the Joseon navy

682
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:42,823
and reach Ming China's Tianjin.

683
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,117
Conquer the land!

684
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:46,827
Once you do,

685
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:49,705
the lord chancellor will bypass Joseon,

686
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:54,084
proceeding straight to Ming.

687
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:58,005
You shall be the one

688
01:03:58,088 --> 01:04:00,048
to welcome him there.

689
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:04,052
The golden fan reflects
the lord chancellor's wishes.

690
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:07,681
Treasure it.

691
01:04:11,977 --> 01:04:13,395
Brothers,

692
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:19,610
we will overtake Konishi's 1st
and Kiyomasa's 2nd divisions

693
01:04:21,361 --> 01:04:23,572
as the first to reach Ming China.

694
01:04:23,864 --> 01:04:24,948
Dono!

695
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:28,452
We congratulate you!

696
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:06,281
Row faster!

697
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,709
Dono. Yi deployed his fleet.

698
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:21,213
His ships are nearby, already at Dangpo.

699
01:05:25,926 --> 01:05:27,135
I see.

700
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,849
A strong foe indeed.

701
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:45,195
Between Dangpo

702
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,574
and our current base Ungpo.

703
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,452
Look here.

704
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:59,543
This narrow sea route between us,
Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

705
01:05:59,835 --> 01:06:02,421
GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

706
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:04,840
Are you reminded of anywhere?

707
01:06:05,632 --> 01:06:07,217
In the Battle of Yongin,

708
01:06:07,426 --> 01:06:09,887
there was a narrow pass
en route to Hanyang.

709
01:06:10,304 --> 01:06:12,222
In Gwanggyosan, was it not?

710
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:18,812
We'll sail to Gyeonnaeryang,
lying in ambush.

711
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:23,192
We'll wait for Yi's next move.

712
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:27,613
- Now go.
- Yes, sir!

713
01:06:36,997 --> 01:06:40,125
DANGPO, JOSEON NAVY'S MIDWAY STOPOVER

714
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:44,922
I've sworn allegiance to Admiral Yi.

715
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,718
There is no time. You must go alone now.

716
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:55,182
Many lives were lost
to secure that report.

717
01:06:55,682 --> 01:07:00,479
Deliver it without fail to Admiral Yi.

718
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:23,252
Hurry! We must pass Ungchi!

719
01:07:29,591 --> 01:07:32,427
Ungchi... leads
to the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

720
01:07:34,137 --> 01:07:36,431
Hurry the rear guard! There is no time!

721
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:41,019
The shortcut to Jeonju Fortress is
this way...

722
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:08,088
DANGPO, JOSEON NAVY'S MIDWAY STOPOVER

723
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:11,091
We've checked these areas.

724
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:14,094
Now we're searching
near Angolpo and Ungpo--

725
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:18,765
So, have you located
the hidden enemy fleet?

726
01:08:20,934 --> 01:08:22,394
We will, soon enough.

727
01:08:22,477 --> 01:08:25,439
I was loath to turn my back so soon

728
01:08:25,522 --> 01:08:28,734
immediately upon arrival yesterday.

729
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:32,404
But if the enemy is not found today,

730
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:37,075
I will withdraw my men
to help defend Jeonju Fortress.

731
01:08:38,076 --> 01:08:40,787
We'll locate them today.

732
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:47,377
Admiral. We've found the enemy.

733
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,214
- Where?
- Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

734
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:55,844
Gyeonnaeryang is nearby.

735
01:08:56,178 --> 01:08:58,847
Around 100 Wae ships are docked there.

736
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:08,065
GYEONNAERYANG
DANGPO

737
01:09:12,027 --> 01:09:13,570
We must attack at once.

738
01:09:13,654 --> 01:09:15,239
Fortune is on our side.

739
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:17,824
They're docked at Gyeonnaeryang

740
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:22,079
because they know
our fleet has sailed out to these shores.

741
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,623
That changes nothing.

742
01:09:25,249 --> 01:09:26,667
We must be cautious.

743
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,218
Remove the other tables.

744
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:37,302
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

745
01:09:48,063 --> 01:09:52,150
We must lure them here
to the open sea of Hansan.

746
01:09:52,234 --> 01:09:53,652
Gyeonnaeryang is too narrow.

747
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:57,155
Our panokseon warships
cannot battle there.

748
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:58,615
I disagree.

749
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:00,909
Narrow or not,

750
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:06,164
it'll be easier to attack
while the enemy is docked.

751
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:10,752
Wouldn't our previous battle formations
suit the circumstances?

752
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:17,301
Strong currents in the strait will hinder
our ships' movement.

753
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,887
Many will be destroyed.

754
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:23,390
Also, the attack may be ineffective

755
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:25,142
if the enemy flees to shore.

756
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:30,105
A leader in war should not shy away

757
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:32,274
from small damages.

758
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:34,651
And if the enemy flees to shore,

759
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:38,197
they can only run to Geojedo Island.

760
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,325
Since they'll be cut off
from reinforcement,

761
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:46,038
we can hunt them down
for a rare victory on land.

762
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,123
I say we strike at them.

763
01:10:48,999 --> 01:10:50,876
In that case,

764
01:10:50,959 --> 01:10:54,213
why don't you take lead
with the first attack?

765
01:10:54,296 --> 01:10:55,297
What?

766
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:59,468
You want only my ships to get battered
and destroyed in vain?

767
01:11:02,221 --> 01:11:06,058
I want you to lure the enemy ships
to this open sea of Hansan.

768
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:10,103
Lure out the fleet?

769
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:14,483
To battle

770
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:18,195
in crane wing formation?

771
01:11:20,614 --> 01:11:24,701
Is that what you meant
by a barrier on the sea?

772
01:11:26,161 --> 01:11:28,872
But I'm no fool.

773
01:11:28,956 --> 01:11:31,333
I can't attack
with only seven ships in my fleet.

774
01:11:31,416 --> 01:11:33,794
That's a suicide mission.

775
01:11:33,877 --> 01:11:36,839
Wakizaka is no fool either.

776
01:11:36,922 --> 01:11:39,132
You think he'll be lured so easily?

777
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:42,219
I'll take no part in this reckless plan.

778
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,471
Admiral Won!

779
01:11:45,514 --> 01:11:47,599
The enemy is right before us.

780
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,061
A barrier on the sea? Nonsense!

781
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:53,981
I'll help defend Jeonju Fortress instead.

782
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:56,525
As a hyangdo (naval guide),
I can lure the enemy.

783
01:12:02,322 --> 01:12:06,535
I know the waterways around Gyeonnaeryang.

784
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:09,621
Let me lure the enemy.

785
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:12,207
I shall go instead.

786
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:20,299
The task should not fall
to the elderly commander.

787
01:12:20,382 --> 01:12:22,426
It is not befitting.

788
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:26,930
Please. Send me instead.

789
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:29,892
Admiral, I agree.

790
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:33,645
CAPTAIN LEE YEONG-NAM
Please send us instead.

791
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:37,608
I see you two are now serving Admiral Yi.

792
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,527
Admiral.

793
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:43,906
It's the last wish of an old commander.

794
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:45,824
Please grant it.

795
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,543
CRANE WING FORMATION PLAN

796
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:59,046
A barrier on the sea? Nonsense!

797
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,424
What is your battle plan?

798
01:13:02,925 --> 01:13:06,678
Will the crane wing formation
ensure victory?

799
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:21,276
CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

800
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:24,279
Admiral. Sergeant Song reporting.

801
01:13:26,532 --> 01:13:27,658
Come in.

802
01:13:29,993 --> 01:13:31,203
What brings you here?

803
01:13:34,706 --> 01:13:37,417
A report requiring secrecy.

804
01:13:38,669 --> 01:13:40,504
It's from Junsa.

805
01:13:52,975 --> 01:13:54,893
Kobayakawa's troops left Geumsan to attack

806
01:13:54,977 --> 01:13:58,021
the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters,
not Jeonju Fortress.

807
01:13:58,438 --> 01:14:00,190
The enemy's army and navy

808
01:14:00,607 --> 01:14:02,985
will strike in unison.

809
01:14:03,694 --> 01:14:06,864
Their fleet was deployed
on the fifth at midnight.

810
01:14:08,323 --> 01:14:11,034
If their ground troops bypass
Jeonju Fortress

811
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:12,578
to strike our headquarters,

812
01:14:12,995 --> 01:14:14,454
it will be a critical blow.

813
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,915
Have you alerted Jeonju Fortress?

814
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:19,293
Junsa is on his way to alert them.

815
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:21,378
If so,

816
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:25,716
who delivered this report instead of him?

817
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,105
UNGCHI PASS

818
01:14:40,189 --> 01:14:42,274
Fasten the cannons tightly!

819
01:14:42,357 --> 01:14:44,359
I don't trust the anti-Wae fighter.

820
01:14:44,443 --> 01:14:46,111
ANTI-WAE FIGHTER:
FORMER WAE SOLDIER FIGHTING FOR JOSEON

821
01:14:46,195 --> 01:14:48,697
Why would the enemy bypass Jeonju Fortress

822
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,407
to attack the navy headquarters?

823
01:14:50,490 --> 01:14:53,160
Let's get rid of that anti-Wae fighter

824
01:14:53,243 --> 01:14:55,746
and march to Jeonju as planned.

825
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:57,748
RIGHTEOUS MILITIA COMMANDER, HWANG BAK
Once the enemy passes Ungchi,

826
01:14:57,831 --> 01:15:00,083
it's only a half-day's march
to the navy headquarters.

827
01:15:00,459 --> 01:15:02,628
We'll receive orders soon.

828
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,255
Until then, we must defend this pass.

829
01:15:33,992 --> 01:15:35,452
So you're the anti-Wae fighter?

830
01:15:36,662 --> 01:15:37,871
Follow me.

831
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:01,979
If we survive this,

832
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:05,649
I'll treat you to a hearty drink.

833
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:17,452
Wait.

834
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:28,422
No need for that.

835
01:16:29,673 --> 01:16:32,968
A shared, righteous spirit.
That's all you need.

836
01:16:33,844 --> 01:16:35,679
Get some armor instead.

837
01:16:48,901 --> 01:16:52,029
CRANE WING FORMATION PLAN

838
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:08,253
We will use the enemy's attack
to surround their fleet.

839
01:17:08,670 --> 01:17:13,050
In the sea of Hansan,
we will battle in crane wing formation.

840
01:17:14,551 --> 01:17:17,012
Flanking the flagship

841
01:17:17,095 --> 01:17:20,265
on the right wing's center will be
Admiral Lee Eok-gi.

842
01:17:21,225 --> 01:17:23,018
On the left wing's center,

843
01:17:29,358 --> 01:17:31,276
there will be Admiral Won.

844
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,532
By his side,
there'll be the wise Commander Eo,

845
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:40,661
the hyangdo (naval guide)
well versed in Joseon's waterways.

846
01:17:41,161 --> 01:17:45,624
Commander Lee Un-ryong,
who offers trustworthy counsel,

847
01:17:45,707 --> 01:17:49,044
shall be next to him.

848
01:17:49,753 --> 01:17:52,923
Captain Kim Wan,
who maneuvers with great skill,

849
01:17:53,006 --> 01:17:56,969
will be at the tip of the left wing.

850
01:17:57,886 --> 01:18:00,097
Commander Gwon Jun

851
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:04,017
has the speed and strength
to wage close combat

852
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:05,978
at the tip of the right wing.

853
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:11,275
As a proven warrior who leads
our navy's most forceful charges,

854
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:13,569
Commander Jung Un will be...

855
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,145
TO CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

856
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,880
Were all ships ordered
to double-load their cannons?

857
01:19:14,963 --> 01:19:16,006
Yes, sir.

858
01:19:16,089 --> 01:19:19,510
We gave orders to double-load shells
and shrapnel shells.

859
01:19:26,141 --> 01:19:28,810
Prepare for deployment.

860
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:30,395
Yes, sir.

861
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:51,583
All ships to war.

862
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:55,921
All ships!

863
01:19:56,255 --> 01:19:57,631
To war!

864
01:19:57,714 --> 01:19:58,715
To war!

865
01:19:58,799 --> 01:19:59,675
To war!

866
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:00,592
To war!

867
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,845
- To war!
- To war!

868
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:16,441
DAY FOUR, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
BATTLE OF HANSAN ISLAND

869
01:20:17,985 --> 01:20:23,115
GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

870
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:35,252
Dono! Yi has deployed his fleet.

871
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:38,463
Fifty six ships set sail from Dangpo.
All panokseon warships,

872
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,300
no mekurabune (blind ship) to be seen.

873
01:20:42,926 --> 01:20:45,137
Could it be a deception?

874
01:20:45,387 --> 01:20:47,097
Never mind the mekurabune.

875
01:20:58,984 --> 01:21:00,986
You two will wait in ambush
on the right and left flanks.

876
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:02,154
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

877
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:29,806
We must lure out the enemy.

878
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:34,353
Stay at least 200 yards away
from their ships.

879
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:35,562
Yes, sir.

880
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,075
Lower the anchor!

881
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:56,375
LEFT FLANK
MANABE SAMANOSUKE

882
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:02,464
RIGHT FLANK
WATANABE SHICHIEMON

883
01:22:17,729 --> 01:22:19,857
Enemy ships! Enemy ships ahead!

884
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:32,995
Hold fire! Find the enemy ships!

885
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:44,923
Fire!

886
01:22:46,008 --> 01:22:47,843
Rank two, prepare to fire!

887
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:51,680
Sahei. How many ships?

888
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:54,516
We cannot count yet.

889
01:22:55,726 --> 01:22:57,019
Hold positions.

890
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:59,938
Keep the enemy at bay by returning fire.

891
01:23:00,022 --> 01:23:02,357
Deplete their firepower.

892
01:23:02,441 --> 01:23:05,777
- Yes, sir!
- To the right! Fire!

893
01:23:08,155 --> 01:23:10,365
Hold fire!

894
01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:27,257
To the left! They're on the left!

895
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:30,886
Fire!

896
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:46,860
Commander Manabe on the left flank
asks if he may attack.

897
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:51,323
Commander Watanabe on the right flank
asks the same.

898
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:54,952
Tell them to stay in position
and hold fire.

899
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:56,912
They must wait in ambush.

900
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,205
Yes, sir!

901
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,590
Commander. I will reverse the ship.

902
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:10,926
Advance 100 yards.

903
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:12,344
We should stop here.

904
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:14,263
We'll be surrounded by the enemy!

905
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:17,224
At this rate, the enemy won't budge.

906
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:20,769
We must deliver a blow to lure them out.

907
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,145
Row forward!

908
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:24,147
Yes, sir!

909
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:35,158
OUTSIDE GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

910
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,543
Will the enemy be lured?

911
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:57,097
Deploy the ships on standby.

912
01:24:57,723 --> 01:24:59,308
Yes, sir.

913
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:26,710
Commander! The fog is clearing.

914
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:29,630
We're running low on gunpowder and shells.
We must retreat!

915
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:38,096
Cannon fire! They're firing cannons!

916
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:40,682
Firing cannons?

917
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:55,781
Fire!

918
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:05,666
The fog is clearing! We can see the ships!

919
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:09,419
Only three ships.

920
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,713
How daring, Yi Sun-shin.

921
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:15,717
You shall soon regret
leaving your headquarters.

922
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:21,348
Wae ships on the right!

923
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:30,774
It's an ambush!

924
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:38,365
A brave move.

925
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:43,370
But three ships aren't enough to lure us.

926
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:46,623
How will Yi respond

927
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:49,543
once they've burned down?

928
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,879
I wonder.

929
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:10,814
It's too late.

930
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:12,524
Prepare for close combat.

931
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:29,499
Dono, enemy ships on the left!

932
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,976
Sir! They're Joseon ships.

933
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:57,861
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

934
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,953
Row at full speed! We must retreat!

935
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:13,919
Row faster! We must retreat!

936
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:16,672
Chase after them at full speed.

937
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:18,131
Close in!

938
01:28:18,799 --> 01:28:20,342
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

939
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,222
Sahei!

940
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:29,059
Signal Manabe at once to stop his chase.

941
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:31,603
He must not leave Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

942
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:32,729
Yes, sir!

943
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:41,947
Sir, over there!

944
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:44,908
Orders to stop!

945
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:47,661
What do we do, sir?

946
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:49,079
Our sword is drawn.

947
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:51,874
We'll catch them here in Gyeonnaeryang.

948
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:54,001
It's what the general wants. After them!

949
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:13,228
Their main fleet isn't joining the attack.

950
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,407
Rotate starboard!

951
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:27,576
Rotate starboard!

952
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:37,211
Throw the grapnel! Board the ship!

953
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:56,146
Our ships are hitting the rocks.

954
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:59,399
No matter,
we'll board enemy ships instead.

955
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,360
Close in!

956
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,284
To port! Rotate to port!

957
01:30:40,607 --> 01:30:43,402
My word. How is this possible?

958
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:46,113
Fire!

959
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:47,739
Fire!

960
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:03,547
Manabe.

961
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:05,382
Dono.

962
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:20,731
Admiral! We received report
from Gyeonnaeryang.

963
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:23,066
Commander Lee's ships entered the strait,

964
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:26,778
but the enemy's main fleet
has yet to be lured.

965
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,368
All ships
to the mouth of Gyeonnaeryang Strait

966
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:35,245
in arrowhead formation.

967
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:36,455
Raise the command flag.

968
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:37,539
Admiral.

969
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:40,167
If the enemy attacks head-on,
we could be in danger.

970
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,794
The current is against us.

971
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,213
We need them to attack.

972
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,964
Raise the flag.

973
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:48,467
Yes, sir.

974
01:31:49,635 --> 01:31:51,136
Raise the flag!

975
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:16,954
Dono.

976
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:19,456
The enemy's main fleet has arrived!

977
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:28,632
All ships, stop!

978
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:31,218
All ships, stop!

979
01:33:06,128 --> 01:33:10,757
By now,
Kobayakawa will have passed Ungchi.

980
01:33:29,151 --> 01:33:31,904
Fire the cannons!

981
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:49,004
We need more arrows!

982
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:51,256
Our hillside flank has fallen.

983
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:53,717
We're far outnumbered!

984
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,765
Fall back to line two!

985
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:02,809
Charge!

986
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:12,653
Line two cannot hold.

987
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:15,864
We must retreat to line three.

988
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:21,495
That'll be the end for us
and the navy headquarters.

989
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:24,540
No! For all of Jeolla-do!

990
01:34:25,415 --> 01:34:27,417
Charge!

991
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:37,970
Enemy ships! The enemy is advancing!

992
01:35:08,876 --> 01:35:12,629
Rotate all ships. Reinforce rowers.

993
01:35:15,215 --> 01:35:17,926
All rowers to oars!

994
01:35:18,552 --> 01:35:20,554
Add rowers!

995
01:35:27,102 --> 01:35:29,813
Rotate the ship!

996
01:35:30,564 --> 01:35:33,108
Get ready to fire!

997
01:35:34,818 --> 01:35:37,196
Sir! It's the command kite.

998
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,993
We must join the formation!

999
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:45,078
Row harder!

1000
01:35:46,747 --> 01:35:48,081
CRANE WING

1001
01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:53,253
Add rowers. Full speed ahead!

1002
01:35:53,337 --> 01:35:55,631
- Speed ensures victory!
- Yes, sir!

1003
01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:57,591
Add more oars!

1004
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:02,429
Row faster!

1005
01:36:02,513 --> 01:36:04,306
Faster!

1006
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:10,395
Row with all your might!

1007
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:12,272
Faster!

1008
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:14,525
We must sail faster!

1009
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:23,617
I will avenge Manabe
by destroying you myself.

1010
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:27,371
Wae ships are closing in!

1011
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,039
Fire!

1012
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:35,420
Shoot the arrows!

1013
01:36:44,513 --> 01:36:46,974
Admiral. They're grappling our ship!

1014
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:52,938
Cut the ropes!

1015
01:36:55,107 --> 01:36:57,192
We must return to formation.

1016
01:37:11,248 --> 01:37:14,042
Sir! Commanders Eo Young-dam
and Lee Un-ryong are under attack.

1017
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,386
Sir!

1018
01:37:24,469 --> 01:37:26,763
Cover for him!

1019
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,392
- Commander Eo.
- Follow me!

1020
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:48,744
Crane wing formation. As expected.

1021
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:52,706
Sahei can battle those ships

1022
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:54,875
while we charge in fish-scale formation.

1023
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:57,252
Fish-scale formation!

1024
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:58,712
Fish-scale formation!

1025
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:25,030
Watanabe reports from the front rank

1026
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:28,617
that he will charge at the ships
lagging behind at the right wing.

1027
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,577
He thinks just like me.

1028
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,913
Tell him I permit the attack.

1029
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:34,122
Yes, sir!

1030
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:39,878
Hurry!

1031
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:43,257
Row backward and load the cannons!

1032
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,175
Fire!

1033
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,932
What in the world is he thinking?

1034
01:38:52,015 --> 01:38:54,560
He's firing without order
despite the waves.

1035
01:38:54,643 --> 01:38:56,270
He should know better!

1036
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:01,066
The enemy ships are too fast.

1037
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,319
We should've attacked sooner.

1038
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:05,988
You blasted Yi Sun-shin,

1039
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:08,115
why aren't you firing?

1040
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:14,538
Admiral Won's ships are weakening
our formation.

1041
01:39:14,621 --> 01:39:16,665
Please give order to fire.

1042
01:39:19,543 --> 01:39:21,628
Please give order, sir!

1043
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:27,009
Before firing,
we must complete the formation.

1044
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:31,013
In the Battle of Mikatagahara,

1045
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:35,392
Takeda Shingen destroyed
Tokugawa's crane wing formation

1046
01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:39,188
not by swords or guns.

1047
01:39:39,855 --> 01:39:42,733
He crushed it with cavalry.

1048
01:39:44,067 --> 01:39:45,777
Charge forth, Watanabe.

1049
01:39:46,069 --> 01:39:48,989
You and I will crush the foe

1050
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:52,826
as we did at Gwanggyosan!

1051
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,084
Charge forth.

1052
01:40:01,168 --> 01:40:03,545
You're not the only ones
with ramming ships.

1053
01:40:03,629 --> 01:40:07,799
Behold the might of our antaekseon
(WAE large warship).

1054
01:40:18,519 --> 01:40:22,731
Your crane will fall
before spreading its wings.

1055
01:40:28,654 --> 01:40:30,072
We've caught you now.

1056
01:41:35,929 --> 01:41:37,431
Mekurabune (blind ship).

1057
01:41:57,701 --> 01:41:59,661
It's the mekurabune!

1058
01:42:02,998 --> 01:42:04,082
Dono!

1059
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:10,964
Bring the large gun!

1060
01:42:11,048 --> 01:42:12,174
Now!

1061
01:42:47,584 --> 01:42:49,378
It's the mekurabune!

1062
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:29,877
Row harder!

1063
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:32,921
Prepare to fire!

1064
01:43:34,631 --> 01:43:36,175
Row harder!

1065
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:50,147
That flagship is shielded by iron plates.

1066
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:53,025
Rotate to port and ram its stern.

1067
01:44:01,158 --> 01:44:02,201
It's slow.

1068
01:44:03,327 --> 01:44:05,954
Nothing but a blind mekurabune.

1069
01:44:06,622 --> 01:44:08,957
Charge toward Yi's flagship!
Signal the fleet!

1070
01:44:09,041 --> 01:44:10,083
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1071
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:11,919
We'll go to the stern chaser.

1072
01:44:12,002 --> 01:44:13,587
I'll fire it myself.

1073
01:44:19,510 --> 01:44:20,802
The sides were its weakness.

1074
01:44:20,886 --> 01:44:22,554
It will rotate for sure.

1075
01:44:22,638 --> 01:44:24,515
I'll aim for the side.

1076
01:44:28,101 --> 01:44:30,020
Take fire, mekurabune.

1077
01:44:33,315 --> 01:44:34,608
Fire!

1078
01:44:40,489 --> 01:44:42,658
Right cannon, fire!

1079
01:44:46,245 --> 01:44:47,788
Aim!

1080
01:44:47,871 --> 01:44:49,289
Fire!

1081
01:45:10,394 --> 01:45:11,353
Dono,

1082
01:45:11,436 --> 01:45:14,773
the mekurabune is closing in sideways
out of our firing range.

1083
01:45:17,609 --> 01:45:18,652
Aim!

1084
01:45:34,376 --> 01:45:35,544
Sahei.

1085
01:45:42,968 --> 01:45:44,678
My trusty cousin.

1086
01:45:45,137 --> 01:45:46,388
Fire!

1087
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:54,354
Wait and see, Yi Sun-shin.

1088
01:45:54,438 --> 01:45:58,066
your mekurabune shall be your fall.

1089
01:46:19,379 --> 01:46:20,756
That one has a lower hull,

1090
01:46:20,839 --> 01:46:22,966
harder to target.

1091
01:46:23,050 --> 01:46:24,801
The mekurabune is charging at us!

1092
01:46:25,093 --> 01:46:26,595
Good.

1093
01:46:26,678 --> 01:46:30,349
Charge at us with all your might,
mekurabune.

1094
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:34,311
Once you do,
your head will be lodged in my ship.

1095
01:46:37,397 --> 01:46:39,525
Prepare to board!

1096
01:47:31,994 --> 01:47:33,453
Bokkaisen (sea monster).

1097
01:47:38,375 --> 01:47:39,960
Dono!

1098
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:03,942
Admiral.

1099
01:48:04,026 --> 01:48:08,155
The new turtle ship will achieve
more than ramming.

1100
01:48:08,947 --> 01:48:10,073
Please.

1101
01:48:11,366 --> 01:48:13,243
Deploy the turtle ship.

1102
01:48:20,417 --> 01:48:21,835
Yi Sun-shin.

1103
01:48:21,919 --> 01:48:25,088
Was this your final ploy?

1104
01:48:30,177 --> 01:48:32,638
Admiral. Thanks to the new turtle ship,

1105
01:48:32,721 --> 01:48:36,099
Commanders Eo Hyang-do and Lee Un-ryong
have returned to formation.

1106
01:48:46,568 --> 01:48:47,444
Admiral.

1107
01:48:47,528 --> 01:48:49,154
The enemy ships are near.

1108
01:48:49,238 --> 01:48:50,781
We must open fire.

1109
01:48:55,202 --> 01:48:56,203
Admiral!

1110
01:49:10,551 --> 01:49:13,011
Why is the turtle ship still
in their midst?

1111
01:49:15,222 --> 01:49:17,808
The mekurabune is charging at us!

1112
01:49:33,949 --> 01:49:37,578
Two hundred yards away.
We can overtake them.

1113
01:49:39,496 --> 01:49:41,582
All ships!

1114
01:49:41,665 --> 01:49:45,127
Break formation!

1115
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:47,880
Engage the enemy!

1116
01:50:05,606 --> 01:50:06,732
Aim!

1117
01:50:10,777 --> 01:50:12,988
What in the world is he thinking?

1118
01:50:13,071 --> 01:50:14,531
The enemy is right before us.

1119
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:15,991
We can't wait any longer!

1120
01:50:16,074 --> 01:50:17,743
Fire immediately!

1121
01:50:17,826 --> 01:50:20,329
Sir, we're out of shells.

1122
01:50:26,793 --> 01:50:27,794
Admiral.

1123
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:31,006
We must win this battle.

1124
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:33,759
Please fire.

1125
01:50:39,932 --> 01:50:41,225
One hundred yards.

1126
01:51:00,118 --> 01:51:01,286
Fifty yards.

1127
01:51:08,502 --> 01:51:10,045
Raise the ladders!

1128
01:51:12,256 --> 01:51:13,757
All ships.

1129
01:51:21,932 --> 01:51:24,476
Raise them!

1130
01:51:24,977 --> 01:51:26,311
Rotate.

1131
01:51:27,187 --> 01:51:29,481
Rotate!

1132
01:51:29,565 --> 01:51:32,192
Port oars, stop!

1133
01:51:37,906 --> 01:51:40,450
Starboard oars, row harder!

1134
01:51:51,044 --> 01:51:53,881
Starboard oars, row harder!

1135
01:51:53,964 --> 01:51:56,175
Too late, Yi Sun-shin.

1136
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:00,220
Row harder!

1137
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:20,282
Board their ships!

1138
01:52:27,873 --> 01:52:29,291
Fire.

1139
01:52:59,154 --> 01:53:01,281
A barrier on the sea.

1140
01:56:19,104 --> 01:56:23,400
Admiral, you have to shoot now!

1141
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:47,925
Admiral!

1142
01:57:16,703 --> 01:57:18,247
A trap!

1143
01:57:18,872 --> 01:57:20,249
Fire!

1144
01:58:14,928 --> 01:58:18,599
Stop them!

1145
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:30,402
We must not let them pass!

1146
01:58:30,485 --> 01:58:32,237
Fight to the death!

1147
01:58:36,867 --> 01:58:38,911
What the hell are you?

1148
01:58:43,165 --> 01:58:48,086
I wanted to treat you to a hearty drink.

1149
01:58:49,087 --> 01:58:51,423
It's too bad I can't.

1150
01:58:52,216 --> 01:58:53,467
Move!

1151
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:57,971
You invaders will not

1152
01:58:58,972 --> 01:59:01,517
go beyond this Ungchi Pass.

1153
01:59:11,818 --> 01:59:14,154
We must guard this place...

1154
01:59:22,788 --> 01:59:25,541
RIGHTEOUS MILITIA COMMANDER, HWANG JIN
Charge!

1155
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:28,126
What did I tell you?

1156
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:30,212
It's a righteous battle.

1157
01:59:32,214 --> 01:59:33,841
Fought together

1158
01:59:34,716 --> 01:59:36,718
with a shared spirit.

1159
01:59:38,762 --> 01:59:40,138
Yours as well.

1160
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:43,058
I'm thankful for it.

1161
01:59:58,073 --> 02:00:01,410
What is this war?

1162
02:00:02,995 --> 02:00:05,581
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

1163
02:00:06,665 --> 02:00:08,709
The enemy is fleeing!

1164
02:00:09,251 --> 02:00:11,295
Chase after them!

1165
02:00:16,675 --> 02:00:19,970
RIGHTEOUS

1166
02:01:17,236 --> 02:01:23,242
FOLLOW

1167
02:02:09,788 --> 02:02:13,208
Admiral. It is a total triumph.

1168
02:02:15,294 --> 02:02:16,295
No.

1169
02:02:23,468 --> 02:02:25,012
Let us press on.

1170
02:02:26,180 --> 02:02:27,598
What Joseon needs

1171
02:02:28,682 --> 02:02:30,767
is a decisive victory.

1172
02:02:35,606 --> 02:02:39,401
DAY SIX, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
ANGOLPO, NEAR BUSAN

1173
02:02:48,452 --> 02:02:53,624
DAY SEVEN, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
BUSANPO, FINAL BATTLEGROUND

1174
02:03:09,723 --> 02:03:11,725
WAE NAVAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF
AT BUSANPO, TODO TAKATORA

1175
02:03:45,467 --> 02:03:47,719
ON JULY 11, 1592,

1176
02:03:47,803 --> 02:03:51,348
ADMIRAL YI ENDED HIS THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
WITH A CANNONADE ON THE ENEMY AT BUSANPO.

1177
02:03:51,431 --> 02:03:56,478
HASHIBA (TOYOTOMI) HIDEYOSHI QUIT
HIS PLANS TO DEFEAT JOSEON'S NAVY.

1178
02:03:56,562 --> 02:04:00,941
THIS SAFEGUARDED MING TO THE WEST
AND REVERSED THE TIDE OF WAR.

1179
02:04:03,026 --> 02:04:05,404
What made you bring me here, sir?

1180
02:04:08,156 --> 02:04:12,160
A YEAR LATER, HANSANDO ISLAND

1181
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:15,205
Look at Geojedo Island.

1182
02:04:16,248 --> 02:04:19,710
The island is facing
the mouth of enemy waters.

1183
02:04:22,337 --> 02:04:25,215
We must secure tighter control
over this sea.

1184
02:04:28,844 --> 02:04:30,345
I agree, sir.

1185
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:33,640
Thanks to our previous victory
in these waters,

1186
02:04:33,849 --> 02:04:36,560
the enemy at Busanpo

1187
02:04:37,811 --> 02:04:40,814
has yet to reappear
around Hansando Island.

1188
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:44,401
I admire the name.

1189
02:04:45,694 --> 02:04:46,987
Hansan.

1190
02:04:49,865 --> 02:04:53,619
Indeed, it's a meaningful name.

1191
02:04:54,411 --> 02:04:55,996
It stands for "grand mountain,"

1192
02:04:57,289 --> 02:04:59,166
does it not?

1193
02:05:01,502 --> 02:05:02,878
It does.

1194
02:05:04,755 --> 02:05:07,049
This Gyeonnaeryang Strait facing Hansan

1195
02:05:07,883 --> 02:05:09,927
will be our front line.

1196
02:05:11,678 --> 02:05:15,057
May Hansan prove to be
a truly grand mountain

1197
02:05:16,975 --> 02:05:19,394
guarding our land.

1198
02:05:21,188 --> 02:05:22,689
Such is my hope.

1199
02:05:41,416 --> 02:05:43,252
The turtle ships have arrived!

1200
02:05:48,841 --> 02:05:53,846
HANSAN: RISING DRAGON
