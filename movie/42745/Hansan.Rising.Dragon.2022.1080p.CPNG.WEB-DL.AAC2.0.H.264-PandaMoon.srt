00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,567
因此,
Hence,

143
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:02,861
我有一个请求。
I have a request.

144
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:05,864
关于加藤的，我猜？
About Kato, I presume?

145
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,662
[全罗左道水军总部龟甲船船坞]
TURTLE SHIP DOCKYARD
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS

146
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,039
你要去掉龙头？
You're removing the dragon head?

147
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:17,960
自从泗川之战后，我一直在思考。
Since the Battle of Sacheon,
I've been thinking.

148
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:21,755
我彻夜难眠，无法动摇你
I stayed up nights
unable to shake the belief

149
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,173
需要龟船的信念
that you need the turtle ship.

150
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:27,135
它不会再在撞击时被卡住吗？
Will it no longer get lodged upon ramming?

151
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,849
这是解决这个问题的唯一途径。
It's the only way to solve that problem.

152
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:37,646
它的速度也会提高吗？
Will it also improve its speed?

153
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,189
是的，大人。
Indeed, sir.

154
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,819
一艘无头龟船...
A headless turtle ship...

155
00:15:53,245 --> 00:15:55,163
你听说了吗？
Have you heard?

156
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:58,250
最新抵达釜山的倭国入侵者...
The latest Wae invaders to arrive
in Busan...

157
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,463
我听说他们是相当可怕的。
I hear they're quite formidable.

158
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,926
李水使的命令执行得怎么样了？
How is Admiral Yi's order coming along?

159
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,595
嗯...
Well...

160

...我们正在收集
...we're gathering

162
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,684
所有能从老百姓那里拿到的火药原料。
all the gunpower ingredients we can,
sourcing it from the people.

163
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,812
但龟船的胃口太好了。
But the turtle ships guzzle so much.

164
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,772
他们是嗑火药的怪兽。
Gunpowder-guzzling monsters, they are.

165
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,694
龟甲舰可以加入水使的舰队,
The turtle ships can join
the admiral's fleet

166
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,321
如果你们抓紧一点的话。
only if you make haste.

167
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:31,575
除了冲撞, 负责撞击的船只必须做的更多。
The ramming ships must do more than ram.

168
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,160
对。
Right.

169
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:36,747
顺便说一下。
By the way,

170
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,959
这是给你的。
this is for you.

171
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:44,671
这是什么？
What's this?

172
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:47,925
我亲手抓住了这只小动物。
I caught the critter myself.

173
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:52,095
如果你有一天感到孤独或气馁，它可以让你振作起来。
If you ever get lonely or discouraged,
it can cheer you up.

174
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,182
- 嘲笑我，是吗？- 别紧张。
- Mocking me, are you?
- Take it easy.

175
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,145
如果你愿意的话，可以煮一碗龟汤补补身子。
Cook a turtle soup for your health
if you'd like.

176
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:04,566
在你行尸走肉之前。
Before you become a shell of a man.

177
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:07,152
无耻。
That impudence.

178
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,870
防守!坚守!
Defense! Ironclad defense!

179
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:19,873
我们必须防守，而不是攻击!
We must defend, not attack!

180
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:26,630
我有一封总司令李洸寄自全州要塞的信。
I have a letter from Jeonju Fortress
sent by Chief Commander Lee Gwang.

181
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,595
回忆在光教山的败绩
He was pained

182
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,975
对他来说非常痛苦。
to recall his defeat
at Gwanggyosan Mountain.

183
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:40,686
倭军的脇坂没有留下

守卫水原要塞。

to guard Suwon Fortress.

185
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:49,027
相反，他向永仁的光教山进发，
Instead, he advanced
to Yongin's Gwanggyosan Mountain,

186
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:52,030
不断地骚扰和迷惑我们的部队。
tiring and luring our troops.

187
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,826
当我们的人降低警惕并在
When our men lowered their guard,

188
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,246
一片空地上安营扎寨之时，
setting up camp in an open field,

189
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:04,543
脇坂在黎明时分伏击并歼灭了我们的部队。
Wakizaka ambushed at dawn,
annihilating our army.

190
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,299
他用进攻的战略守住了
His stronghold was defended

191
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,635
他的要塞。
without a defensive strategy.

192

李水使。
Admiral Yi.

193
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:24,855
陛下发来消息。
His Majesty sends word.

194
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,827
发生了什么事？
What has happened?

195
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,040
我们收到来自平壤的消息。
We received word from Pyeongyang.

196
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,920
陛下已经动身前往西北边境的义州。
HIS MAJESTY HAS DEPARTED TO UIJU
BY THE NORTHWEST BORDER.

197
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:53,383
他怎么能放弃平壤呢？
How could he forsake Pyeongyang Fortress?

198
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:55,886
有比平壤更重要的事。
There is more at stake than Pyeongyang.

199
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,765
我们必须要知道为什么陛下要去
We must ask why His Majesty left for Uiju

200
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,517
西北边境的义州？
by the northwest border.

201
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,812
总指挥倾向于去东北的咸镜道，
The Chief Commander preferred
the northeast province Hamgyeong-do

202
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:08,398
那里可以作为一个防御基地。
as a defensible base,

203
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,027
但陛下却选择了西北边境的义州。
but His Majesty chose Uiju
by the northwest border instead.

204
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,155
陛下是否会
Will His Majesty

205
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,824
向西寻求明朝的庇护（内附中国）？
seek refuge westward in Ming China?

206
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:20,994
这是不可能的。
That cannot be.

207
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:25,123
这会摧毁所有人的士气
It will destroy the people's morale

208
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,293
并威胁到我们家园的命运。
and threaten the fate of our land.

209
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,926
根据我们与朝鲜囚犯的训练，
Based on our training
with Joseon prisoners,

210
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,097
朝鲜水军的大炮射程达到了1000码。
Joseon's navy cannons reach a firing range
of 1,000 yards.

211
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,141
在500码内具有破坏性。
They are destructive within 500 yards.

212

他们的板屋船（一种朝鲜战舰）

215
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,155
有一种奇怪炮弹装弹方法。
have a strange way of reloading cannons.

216
00:19:57,406 --> 00:19:58,532
怎么说呢？
How so?

217
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,785
将战舰调转至另一边开火
Instead of reloading,
they rotate their ships,

218
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,997
而不是重新装弹。
firing from the other side.

219
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,750
非常有趣啊。
Interesting.

220
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:11,712
然而，
However,

221
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:14,715
即使他们的板屋战舰以这种方式进行更快的射击，
even if their panokseon ships refire
faster that way,

222
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,718
但我们可以在200码外用速度优势
we can press with speed
from 200 yards away,

223
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,511
超过他们的战舰来压制他们。
overtaking their ships.

224
00:20:20,554 --> 00:20:22,139
从200码开始，
From 200 yards,

00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,057
超过他们。
overtaking them.

大人。
Dono.

227
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,857
我们必须再次进行伏击。
We must ambush again.

立即部署舰队。

Deploy the fleet at once.

如果他们阻止我们。
If they block us,

230
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:44,328
我们会碾碎那个麻烦的东西。
we will crush that troublesome thing.

231
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,921
你是说海怪沐海潛。
You mean the sea monster Bokkaisen,

232
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,634
或者说他们的龟甲舰（盲船）？
or rather their mekurabune (blind ship)?

233
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:00,469
龟甲舰。
Mekurabune.

234
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,888
盲船。
Blind ship.

235
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,476
我喜欢这个名字，比沐海潛好听。
I like that name better than Bokkaisen.

236
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,355
龟甲舰只打了一场仗。
The mekurabune fought only one battle.

237
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:12,981
但为什么只打了一场呢？
But why?

238
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,068
为什么他们不会将被谣传为
Why won't they battle with a ship

239
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,612
怪兽的战舰投入战斗？
rumored to be a monstrous Bokkaisen?

佐平。

去侦察一下全罗左道的水军。
Go scout the Left Jeolla Navy.

243
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,334
了解龟甲舰的情况。
Find out about the mekurabune.

244
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,169
还有，
Also,

245
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,048
打听一下李舜臣。
about Yi Sun-shin.

246

249
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,319
我必须给他带个话。
I must send word to him.

李水使。
Admiral Yi.

252
00:22:07,953 --> 00:22:10,664
我们这里的总部可能是国王陛下最后的避难所。
Our headquarters here might be
His Majesty's last refuge.

253
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,666
与其匆忙上阵，
Instead of rushing to battle,

254
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,878
也许我们应该像元水使建议的那样守住这个地方。
perhaps we should guard this place
as Admiral Won suggested.

255
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,508
你还是会进攻
Will you still attack

256
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,386
在釜山要塞的倭军基地吗？
the Wae invaders' base at Busan Fortress?

257
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,189
在你眼里是这样的吗？
Does it look so in your eyes?

258
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,903
难道不是这样吗？
Is it not so?

259
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:43,655
也许是这样。
Perhaps it is.

260
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:47,576
但正如元水使所言，
But as Admiral Won has said,

261
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,579
我们处于防守状态。
we're on the defensive.

262
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,209
对釜山的行动需要谨慎。
An attack on Busan requires caution.

263
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,128
如果你既不防守也不进攻。
If you will neither defend nor attack,

264
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,881
你的作战计划是什么？
what is your battle plan?

265
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:06,595
也许
Perhaps

266
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,890
我们的下一场战斗将决定
our next battle will determine

267
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:15,187
这场战争的走向。</i>。
the fate of this war.

268

[兴国寺避难所] 饭团!

00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,834
大米!
Rice!

270
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,087
请慢用。
Please have some food.

271
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:56,019
那个人我怎么在釜山要塞也看到过。
I saw that man at Busan Fortress.

272
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,364
有趣。
Interesting.

273
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,867
- 要小心。- 好的。
- Be careful.
- All right.

274
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,019
我已收到你的信。
I have received your letter.

275
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,396
我感谢你的提议。
I appreciate the offer,

276
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:44,776
但作为第六师团的指挥官，
but as commander of the sixth division,

277
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,739
我，小早川，将按计划进攻全州要塞。
I, Kobayakawa, will attack Jeonju Fortress
as planned.

278
00:24:48,822 --> 00:24:52,910
锦山要塞刚刚摆脱了朝鲜勤王军。
Now that Geumsan Fortress is cleared
of the Joseon people's militia,

279
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:56,747
我很快就能向全罗道的全州要塞进军。
I can soon advance on Jeonju Fortress
in Jeolla-do.

280
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,758
请写下我的答复。
Transcribe my reply.

281
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,306
我请求你攻打李舜臣的全罗左道水军总部,
Instead of attacking Jeonju Fortress
with the sixth division,

282
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:17,851
而不是让第六师攻打全州要塞。
I ask you to strike Yi Sun-shin's
Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

283
00:25:17,935 --> 00:25:21,980
如果你这样做，你将会获得我在全罗道征服的一切。
Do so, and I will grant you
all my conquests in Jeolla-do.

284
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:26,401
战争的结果取决于全罗左道水军，而不是全州要塞。
The war's outcome depends on
the Left Jeolla Navy, not Jeonju Fortress.

285
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:29,696
现在，和我一起参加这次进击吧，
Now, join me in this attack,

286
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,157
这会让大名大人满意的。
which will please the lord chancellor.

287
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:40,499
大人。
Dono.

288
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,086
你会把整个全罗道都交给小早川吗？
Will you grant Kobayakawa
all of Jeolla-do?

289
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,005
李舜臣只是一个障碍，我们可以在没有他的帮助下战胜他。
Yi is a mere hindrance we can defeat
without his help.

290
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,382
仅仅是一个阻碍？
A mere hindrance?

291
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,346
你将如何打败李舜臣？
How will you defeat Yi?

292
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:58,141
通过先发制人的打击，让他措手不及。
By catching him off guard
with a preemptive strike!

293
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,810
就像我们在光教山所做的那样!
As we did at Gwanggyosan!

294
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,728
让我们保持领先一步。
Let's stay one step ahead.

295
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:03,438
我们也会在陆地上打败他。
We'll defeat him also on land.

296
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,859
这是一个全面胜利的计划，我有这个计划，而李舜臣却没有。
It's a plan for total victory,
which I have while Yi doesn't.

297
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:10,153
- 我们已经准备好了......--朝鲜很快就会沦陷。
- But we're ready--
- Joseon will fall soon.

298
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,948
战争将转移到大明的中国。
The war will shift to Ming China.

299
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:15,158
从征服大明开始。
By reaching Ming first,

300
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,786
我们将征服更多。
we will conquer much more.

301
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,664
相比之下，全罗道就显得有些逊色了。
Jeolla-do pales in comparison.

302
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,083
你不明白吗？
Do you not understand?

303
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,459

But

304
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:28,672

康兵卫是一个言出必行的人。
Kanbei is a man of his word.

306
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,927
他会做到的。
He will make it happen.

307
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:41,476
你在泗川的手下为什么要加入靠近全罗锦山的师团？
Why did your men at Sacheon join
the division at Geumsan near Jeolla?

308
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:45,397
他们是否会从锦山进攻全州要塞？
Will they deploy from Geumsan
to attack Jeonju Fortress?

309
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:47,399
他们什么时候进攻？
When will they strike?

310
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,067

不知道。
Nothing.

你们这些傻瓜!
You fools!

314
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,457
全州要塞问题不大。
Jeonju Fortress matters little.

315
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,668
我们的部队正在釜山
Our Wae army is gathering

316
00:27:06,752 --> 00:27:08,712
聚集大批的士兵。
in great numbers in Busan.

317
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:12,549

You should beg for your lives!

你是谁？
Who are you?

321

他们对他做了什么？
What have they done to him?

326
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,102
你还好吗？
Are you alright?

327
00:28:05,727 --> 00:28:06,728
大人!
Dono!

328
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:18,949
因为有你， 我们才在这里甘愿忍受折磨。
You're the reason we endure.

329
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,787
你是我们大家的英雄!
You're a hero to us all!

330
00:28:31,253 --> 00:28:32,963
不要杀他。
Do not take his life.

331
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,966
我感觉他有话要说。
I sense he has a veiled purpose.

332
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,374
这场战争...
This war...

333
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:12,878
它是关于什么的？
What is it about?

334
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,174
我恳请你告诉我。
I beseech you to tell me.

335
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,052
这场战争是什么？
What is this war?

336
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:26,725
一场正义与不义的战斗。
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

337
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:33,106
不是国与国之争？
Not a battle of nations?

338
00:29:35,609 --> 00:29:36,610
不是。
No.

339
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,922
我在泗川向你开过枪。
I shot you at Sacheon.

340
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,635

I saw with my own eyes

341
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,849

how you stepped forth
to save your soldier.

请。让我为你效忠吧。
Please. Let me serve you.

我为什么会梦到这个？
Why did I dream of this?

348
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:57,352
他守住了堡垒
His stronghold was defended

349

353
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:48,445
这个阵型是防御性的吗？还是进攻性的？
Is this formation defensive? Or offensive?

354
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:53,450
当然是防御性的。就像海面上的屏障。
Surely defensive.
Like a barrier on the sea.

355
00:33:54,618 --> 00:33:56,370
海上的屏障？
A barrier on the sea?

00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,872
在那边。
Over there,

357
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:01,875
我们正在模拟倭国入侵者的攻击。
we're simulating the Wae invaders' attack.

358
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,973

遵命，大人。
Yes, sir.

在训练中从未见过龟甲舰。

I must leave now.

443
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,531
将军。
Admiral.

444
00:42:57,327 --> 00:43:00,247
侧面看起来很弱。
The sides look weak.

445
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,711
这有利于发射大炮，但一旦开战也容易暴露。
Good for firing cannons
but exposed to attack.

446
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,421
还有，
Also,

447
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:11,717
船的头部和上盖一定非常重。
the head and cover must be heavy.

448
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,053
我想知道它是否能以任何速度航行。
I wonder if it can sail with any speed.

449
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,434
俊沙，是吗？
Junsa, was it?

450
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,147
因此，你和这艘船战斗过。
So you fought against the ship.

451
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:28,859
是的，在泗川战役中。
Yes, at the Battle of Sacheon.

452
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:32,487
的确，它的行动似乎相当迟缓。
Indeed, its movement seemed quite slow.

453
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:34,114
继续。
Go on.

454
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:35,824
在泗川。
At Sacheon,

455
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:38,327
我们中了李舜臣的圈套。
we fell for Yi's luring tactic.

456
00:43:38,577 --> 00:43:39,995
引诱战术？
Luring tactic?

457
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:41,580
是的，大人。
Yes, sir.

458
00:43:42,623 --> 00:43:43,790
然而。
However,

459
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,959
正如你所指出的,
as you pointed out,

460
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:49,379
我们可以轻易地摧毁这艘船,
we could've easily destroyed the ship

461
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:53,342
如果我们有准备的话。
had we been prepared.

462
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:57,763
有一次，它撞上了我们的军舰。
Once it rammed into our warship,

463
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,890
龙头被卡住，无法移动。
the dragon head was lodged,
unable to move.

464
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:02,142
龙头被卡住了？
The dragon head was lodged?

465
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,227
是的，大人。
Yes, sir.

466
00:44:07,356 --> 00:44:09,900
所以，这就是缺陷。
So, that was the flaw.

467
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,239
一次有问题的撞击。
A flawed ram.

468
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:19,743
然而。
And yet,

469
00:44:20,077 --> 00:44:24,289
它被称为 "沐海潛"，在我们的人中引发了恐惧。
it was called the Bokkaisen,
striking terror in our men.

470
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:30,671
你是在暗示这是一个虚假的传言吗？
Are you implying it was a false rumor?

471
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:35,926
渡边。
Watanabe.

472
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,011
你怎么看？
What do you think?

473
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,514
因为它没有参加过训练。
Since it was absent from training,

474
00:44:40,848 --> 00:44:43,559
它可能不会被投入实战。
it probably won't be deployed.

475
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:45,894
然而，我很关心佐平提供的有关朝鲜水军
However, I'm concerned

476
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:49,815
鹤翼阵型的报告。
by Sahei's report
regarding their crane wing formation.

477
00:44:51,859 --> 00:44:54,862
似乎是一种攻击阵型。
It appears to be an offensive.

478
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,906
我怀疑他们会通过包围釜山浦来发动攻击。
I suspect they will surround Busanpo
to mount an attack.

479
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:59,449
不是的，大人。
No, sir.

480
00:44:59,992 --> 00:45:01,827
李舜臣在利用囚犯
Yi was using prisoners

481
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:04,997
来准备防守战术。
to prepare defensive tactics.

482
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,083
此外，如果没有龟甲舰，
Besides, without the mekurabune,

483
00:45:08,166 --> 00:45:09,626
他不会冒险进行进攻的。
he cannot risk an attack.

484
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,629
大人。这些都是毫无根据的说法。
Dono. These are baseless claims.

485
00:45:12,713 --> 00:45:13,797
够了。
Enough.

486
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,133
俊沙。
Junsa.

487
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,928
靠近点。
Come closer.

488
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:31,773
再近一点。
Closer.

489
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:45,871
证明你的说法是正确的。
Justify your claim.

490
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:54,880
甚至他们的国王也逃到
Even their king has fled

491
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,966
了西北边界。
to the northwest border.

492
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:01,845
因此，李舜臣会寻求退路。
Hence, Yi will be looking to retreat.

493
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,806
他不敢贸然进攻。
He wouldn't dare advance in attack.

494
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:16,735
我必须说，
I must say,

495
00:46:17,611 --> 00:46:19,780
这是一个很好的推理。
it's decent reasoning.

496
00:46:32,584 --> 00:46:35,337
大人。加藤的舰队已经到达了。
Dono. Kato's fleet has arrived.

497
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:57,901
到的太是时候了。
Arriving at the perfect time.

498
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:09,955
[加藤嘉明]
KATO YOSHIAKI

499
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,836
[九鬼嘉隆]
KUKI YOSHITAKA

500
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,009
战神八幡
The war god Hachiman

501
00:47:23,552 --> 00:47:25,554
再次照耀着我。
shines on me again.

502
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,118
将军!
Admiral!

503
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:53,123
没有龟甲舰，你能赢得战斗吗？
Can you win your battle
without the turtle ship?

504
00:47:55,083 --> 00:47:59,505
没有龟甲舰，你真的能赢吗？
Can you truly win without the turtle ship?

505
00:48:16,897 --> 00:48:20,901
你的伤口还没有痊愈。但你已经开始射箭了。
Your wound has yet to heal.
Yet you're shooting arrows already.

506
00:48:29,993 --> 00:48:30,994
将军。
Admiral.

507
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,414
通过训练我深信
I'm convinced by our training

508
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:37,417
我们需要龟甲舰。
that we need the turtle ships.

509
00:48:39,294 --> 00:48:40,546
你不同意吗？
Do you not agree?

510
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:45,467
将军。
Admiral.

511
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:51,932
大人。
Sir,

512
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:55,894
林俊英亲自带来了他的报告。
Lim Jun-young brought his report
in person.

513
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,231
他亲自来了？
In person?

514
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:04,027
截至目前，脇坂的舰队
Until now, Wakizaka's fleet

515
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:07,030
有30艘大型船只，70艘中型船只，
had 30 large ships, 70 medium ships,

516
00:49:07,114 --> 00:49:09,283
合计一百艘。
One hundred ships total.

517
00:49:09,366 --> 00:49:12,244
从南部对马岛出发的加藤嘉明的舰队（大船和小船各20艘）
Kato Yoshiaki's fleet
from the southern island Daemado

518
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:15,247
也已经加入了脇坂的舰队。
has now joined him
with 20 large ships and 20 small ships.

519
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:17,666
这样，总共有140艘。
That makes 140 ships total.

520
00:49:17,749 --> 00:49:21,128
脇坂的等待已经结束。他会很快进行部署。
Wakizaka's wait is over.
He will deploy soon.

521
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,504
时机已到。
The time has arrived.

522
00:49:22,588 --> 00:49:23,672
但是，大人。
But sir,

523
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:26,800
加藤的船非常特别。
Kato's ships are unique.

524
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,385
特别？
Unique?

525
00:49:29,094 --> 00:49:32,014
几艘大船的船体较厚，
Several large ships have thicker hulls

526
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,601
还有我们以前没有见过的吊装式大炮。
and suspended cannons
we haven't seen before.

527
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:38,103
至于他们的旗舰，
As for their flagship,

528
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:42,441
它装备有大炮并覆盖有铁板。
it's armed with cannons
and covered in iron plates.

529
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:46,153
一艘覆盖着铁板的旗舰？
A flagship covered in iron plates?

530
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:48,655
果然不出所料。
It is as expected.

531
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:53,744
他们准备对付我们的大炮和撞角。
They prepared
against our cannons and rams.

532
00:49:54,203 --> 00:49:55,204
这支敌军舰队...
This enemy fleet...

533
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:58,749
[权俊指挥]......将会发起进攻以保障通往
COMMANDER GWON JUN
...will attack to secure a supply route

534
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:01,084
西海岸的补给线。
to the western coast.

535
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:03,170
敌人的地面部队聚集在...
The enemy's ground troops are gathered...

536
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,756
[申镐指挥]......全州要塞附近的锦山。
COMMANDER SHIN HO
...at Geumsan near Jeonju Fortress.

537
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,716
他们将在海陆进行两线作战。
They will fight on two fronts at sea
and on land.

538
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,887
他们将同时攻击全州要塞和全罗左道水军。
They will attack both Jeonju Fortress
and the Left Jeolla Navy.

539
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,473
如果我们的水军如敌人所愿倒下了，
If our navy falls as the enemy wishes,

540
00:50:14,556 --> 00:50:17,017
朝鲜在义州的政权也将垮台。
Joseon's regime in Uiju will also fall.

541
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:25,317
我们肯定会面临进攻，但全州受到的威胁更大。
We will surely face attack,
but Jeonju is under greater threat.

542
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:27,444
龙仁之战
The Battle of Yongin has left

543
00:50:27,528 --> 00:50:31,448
把总指挥李洸打残了。
Chief Commander Lee Gwang
crippled by defeat.

544
00:50:32,658 --> 00:50:36,578
无论如何，我们必须提醒全州要塞。
In any case,
we must alert Jeonju Fortress.

545
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:40,499
我们是不是应该分兵增援全州要塞？
Shouldn't we split our forces
to reinforce the army at Jeonju Fortress?

546
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:44,294
你疯了吗？我们不能让水师分兵。
Have you gone mad?
We cannot split the navy.

547
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:46,213
绝不能!
Out of the question!

548
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:48,966
忍住你的怒火。我只是说我必须这样做。
Hold your anger. I merely speak as I must.

549
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,342
够了。
Enough.

550
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:54,930
李水使。
Admiral Yi.

551
00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:57,641
你准备如何作战？
How will you proceed?

552
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,294
现在是进行关键战斗的时候了。
The time has come for a critical battle.

553
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:27,546
因此...
Hence...

554
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,804
明天午夜，我们出征。
tomorrow at midnight,
we shall set out to war.

555
00:51:36,972 --> 00:51:37,973
为战斗做好准备。
Prepare for deployment.

556
00:51:38,056 --> 00:51:39,725
不进行防守？
Instead of defending?

557
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,659
而是装填炮弹和火药!
Load the shells and gunpowder!

558
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,828
小心点!
Careful!

559
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:04,750
按照命令，
As ordered,

560
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:06,960
[炮长李奉洙] 我们囤了所有能囤的火药。
GUNNERY MASTER LEE BONG-SU
we stockpiled all the gunpowder we could.

561
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:08,295
做得好。
Well done.

562
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:11,965
为什么你需要的量比平时多？
Why do you need more than usual?

563
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:14,968
双倍装弹量的大炮
For double-loading cannons

564
00:52:15,886 --> 00:52:20,474
可以同时装填炮弹和霰弹。
with both shells and shrapnel shells.

565
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:26,605
这只能在短距离内造成伤害。
That will cause damage
only within short range.

566
00:52:27,314 --> 00:52:29,066
- 到时敌舰会接近我们的......--了解了。
- The enemy ships will close in--
- Noted.

567
00:52:29,816 --> 00:52:33,070
罗队长在路上了吗？
Is Chief Nah on his way?

568
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:07,062
让我们一起享受这杯酒。
Let's enjoy this drink together.

569
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:12,818
顺便说一下。
By the way,

570
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,029
这个李水使是个什么样的人？
what kind of man is this Admiral Yi?

571
00:53:16,321 --> 00:53:19,199
一个令人惊讶的强大敌人。
A surprisingly strong foe.

572
00:53:19,283 --> 00:53:22,494
这就是为什么我们必须一起面对他。
That is why we must face him together.

573
00:53:23,245 --> 00:53:27,082
我听说朝鲜的将领一直很孱弱，
Joseon's commanders have been weak,
I heard.

574
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:30,711
但李舜臣一定是个例外。
Yi must be the exception.

575
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:35,174
现在，两位战神都在这里加入我们了，
Now that two war heroes have
joined us here,

576
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:38,177
李舜臣不会有机会的。
Yi will not stand a chance.

577
00:53:38,886 --> 00:53:43,390
这场沉闷的战争将比预期结束地更快。
This dull war will end sooner
than expected.

578
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,313
大人。
Dono.

579
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,691
我们收到了来自小早川第六师团的消息。
We received word
from Kobayakawa's sixth division.

580
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,284
所有人都出去。
Everyone out.

581
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,661
所有人都出去。
Everyone out.

582
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:09,333
如果你想死的话，就不要犹豫了。
Dither at your peril if you wish to die!

583
00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:12,461
快点!
Hurry up!

584
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:22,721
小早川同意对从陆路对全罗左道水军总部进行攻击。
Kobayakawa agreed to the inland attack
against the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

585
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,431
在这种情况下，
In that case,

586
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:26,892
他什么时候开始行动？
when will he deploy?

587
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:28,018
他说
He asked

588
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:31,647
让你来答复他何时行动。
that you decide when and send your reply.

589
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:35,317
如果是这样的话。
If so,

590
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,070
我们会在今晚午夜时分出发。
we set out tonight at midnight.

591
00:54:40,447 --> 00:54:41,782
荒唐!
Absurd!

592
00:54:42,074 --> 00:54:45,035
你不能在没有征求我意见的情况下这样做！"。
You can't do so without consulting me!

593

脇坂，请重新考虑。
Wakizaka, please reconsider.

连宫女们都来当间谍了。
Even the courtesans are spies.

623
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:36,623
真让人失望。
What a disappointment.

我希望能带你一起走。
I'd hoped to take you with me.

Narrow or not,

748
01:10:00,993 --> 01:10:06,164
在敌人停靠的时候发动攻击会更容易。
it'll be easier to attack
while the enemy is docked.

749
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:10,752
我们以前的战斗队形难道不适合这种情况吗？
Wouldn't our previous battle formations
suit the circumstances?

750

海峡中的强大水流会阻碍我们船只的行动。
Strong currents in the strait will hinder
our ships' movement.

如果敌人逃到了岸上，
And if the enemy flees to shore,

757
01:10:34,735 --> 01:10:38,197
他们只能跑到巨济岛上。
they can only run to Geojedo Island.

758
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:41,325
因为他们被切断了增援，
Since they'll be cut off
from reinforcement,

759
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:46,038
所以我们可以追击他们，在陆地上取得难得的胜利。
we can hunt them down
for a rare victory on land.

01:23:24,171 --> 01:23:27,257
向左！他们在左边！
To the left! They're on the left!

893
01:23:29,468 --> 01:23:30,886
开火！
Fire!

894
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:46,860
左翼的真锅指挥官问他是否可以进攻。
Commander Manabe on the left flank
asks if he may attack.

895
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:51,323
右翼的渡边指挥官也在问。
Commander Watanabe on the right flank
asks the same.

896
01:23:51,615 --> 01:23:54,952
告诉他们留在原地不要开火。
Tell them to stay in position
and hold fire.

897
01:23:55,035 --> 01:23:56,912
他们必须埋伏等待。
They must wait in ambush.

898
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:58,205
遵命，大人！
Yes, sir!

899
01:24:06,296 --> 01:24:08,590
指挥。我要倒转船头。
Commander. I will reverse the ship.

900
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:10,926
前进100码。
Advance 100 yards.

901
01:24:11,009 --> 01:24:12,344
我们应该在这里停下。
We should stop here.

902
01:24:12,427 --> 01:24:14,263
我们会被敌人包围的!
We'll be surrounded by the enemy!

903
01:24:14,346 --> 01:24:17,224
照这样下去，敌人是不会上钩的。
At this rate, the enemy won't budge.

904
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:20,769
我们必须佯攻一下，才能引诱他们出来。
We must deliver a blow to lure them out.

905
01:24:20,978 --> 01:24:22,145
向前划!
Row forward!

906
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:24,147
遵命，大人！
Yes, sir!

907
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:35,158
[见乃梁海峡外]
OUTSIDE GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

908
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,543
敌人会上勾吗？
Will the enemy be lured?

909
01:24:53,719 --> 01:24:57,097
所有船只待命。
Deploy the ships on standby.

910
01:24:57,723 --> 01:24:59,308
遵命，大人。
Yes, sir.

911
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:26,710
指挥！雾气正在消散。
Commander! The fog is clearing.

912
01:25:26,793 --> 01:25:29,630
我们的火药和炮弹已经不多了。我们必须撤退!
We're running low on gunpowder and shells.
We must retreat!

913
01:25:35,135 --> 01:25:38,096
有大炮打来了！他们正在发射大炮！
Cannon fire! They're firing cannons!

914
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:40,682
他们在发射大炮？
Firing cannons?

915
01:25:54,488 --> 01:25:55,781
开火！
Fire!

916
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:05,666
雾正在散去！我们可以看到那些船了！
The fog is clearing! We can see the ships!

917
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:09,419
只有三艘船。
Only three ships.

918
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,713
李舜臣怎么这么大胆。
How daring, Yi Sun-shin.

919
01:26:12,381 --> 01:26:15,717
你很快就会后悔离开你的总部。
You shall soon regret
leaving your headquarters.

920
01:26:17,761 --> 01:26:21,348
右侧发现倭舰!
Wae ships on the right!

921
01:26:29,356 --> 01:26:30,774
这里有埋伏!
It's an ambush!

922
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:38,365
一次勇敢的尝试。
A brave move.

923
01:26:40,117 --> 01:26:43,370
但三艘船还不足以引诱我们。
But three ships aren't enough to lure us.

924
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:46,623
我想知道，
How will Yi respond

925
01:26:47,165 --> 01:26:49,543
一旦它们被击毁，
once they've burned down?

926
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,879
李舜臣将如何应对？
I wonder.

927
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:10,814
太晚了。
It's too late.

928
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:12,524
准备好近身战斗。
Prepare for close combat.

929
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:29,499
大人，左侧发现敌舰！
Dono, enemy ships on the left!

930
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,976
大人！是我们的船。
Sir! They're Joseon ships.

931
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:57,861
[李云龙指挥]
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

932
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:05,953
全速行进！我们必须撤退！

933
01:28:10,749 --> 01:28:13,919
划快点！我们必须撤退！

934
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:16,672
全速追赶他们。
Chase after them at full speed.

935
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:18,131
快点靠近!

- 现在！- 是的，大人！
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

937
01:28:24,346 --> 01:28:25,222
佐平！
Sahei!

938
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:29,059
立即给真锅打信号，让他停止追击。
Signal Manabe at once to stop his chase.

939
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:31,603
他绝不能离开见乃梁海峡。
He must not leave Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

940
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:32,729
遵命，大人！
Yes, sir!

941
01:28:40,112 --> 01:28:41,947
大人，看那里！
Sir, over there!

942
01:28:43,657 --> 01:28:44,908
是停止追击的命令!
Orders to stop!

943
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:47,661
我们该怎么做，大人？
What do we do, sir?

944
01:28:47,744 --> 01:28:49,079
我们的剑已经出鞘了。
Our sword is drawn.

945
01:28:49,162 --> 01:28:51,874
我们将在见乃梁这里抓住他们。
We'll catch them here in Gyeonnaeryang.

946
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:54,001
这是将军所希望的。继续追击他们!
It's what the general wants. After them!

947
01:29:09,975 --> 01:29:13,228
他们的主力舰队并没有加入进攻。
Their main fleet isn't joining the attack.

948
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,407
向右舷转！
Rotate starboard!

949
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:27,576
向右舷转！
Rotate starboard!

950
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:37,211
扔抓斗！登船！
Throw the grapnel! Board the ship!

951
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:56,146
我们的船正在撞击礁石。
Our ships are hitting the rocks.

952
01:29:56,772 --> 01:29:59,399
没关系，我们登上敌舰吧。
No matter,
we'll board enemy ships instead.

953
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:01,360
快点靠近!
Close in!

954
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,284
向左!转向左舷！
To port! Rotate to port!

955
01:30:40,607 --> 01:30:43,402
啊！这怎么可能呢？
My word. How is this possible?

956
01:30:44,862 --> 01:30:46,113
开火！
Fire!

957
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:47,739
开火！
Fire!

958
01:31:02,129 --> 01:31:03,547
真锅。
Manabe.

959
01:31:04,214 --> 01:31:05,382
大人。
Dono.

960
01:31:17,728 --> 01:31:20,731
将军!我们收到了来自见乃梁的报告。
Admiral! We received report
from Gyeonnaeryang.

961
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:23,066
李指挥的战舰已经驶入海峡了，
Commander Lee's ships entered the strait,

962
01:31:23,150 --> 01:31:26,778
但是敌人的主力舰队还没有上勾。
but the enemy's main fleet
has yet to be lured.

963
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,368
所有前往见乃梁海峡入口的船只
All ships
to the mouth of Gyeonnaeryang Strait

964
01:31:33,452 --> 01:31:35,245
变为箭矢阵型。
in arrowhead formation.

965
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:36,455
升起指挥旗。
Raise the command flag.

966
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:37,539
将军。
Admiral.

967
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:40,167
如果敌人从正面进攻，我们可能会有危险。
If the enemy attacks head-on,
we could be in danger.

968
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:42,794
水流对我们不利。
The current is against us.

969
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,213
我们需要他们来进攻。
We need them to attack.

970
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:45,964
升起旗帜。
Raise the flag.

971
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:48,467
遵命，大人。
Yes, sir.

972

升旗!
Raise the flag!

973

大人。
Dono.

974
01:32:17,037 --> 01:32:19,456
敌人的主力舰队已经到了!
The enemy's main fleet has arrived!

975
01:32:26,672 --> 01:32:28,632
所有船只，停止移动！
All ships, stop!

976
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:31,218
所有船只，停下！
All ships, stop!

977
01:33:06,128 --> 01:33:10,757
现在，小早川应该已经穿过熊峙了。
By now,
Kobayakawa will have passed Ungchi.

978
01:33:29,151 --> 01:33:31,904
开炮！
Fire the cannons!

979
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:49,004
我们需要更多的箭!
We need more arrows!

980
01:33:49,087 --> 01:33:51,256
我们的山坡侧翼已经陷落了。
Our hillside flank has fallen.

981
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:53,717
我们寡不敌众啊!
We're far outnumbered!

982
01:33:57,137 --> 01:33:59,765
退到第二防线！
Fall back to line two!

983
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:02,809
冲啊!
Charge!

984
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:12,653
第二道防线也无法守住。
Line two cannot hold.

985
01:34:12,986 --> 01:34:15,864
我们必须退到第三道防线。
We must retreat to line three.

986
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:21,495
那将是我们和水军总部的末日。
That'll be the end for us
and the navy headquarters.

987
01:34:21,578 --> 01:34:24,540
不!为了整个全罗道!
No! For all of Jeolla-do!

988
01:34:25,415 --> 01:34:27,417
冲啊!
Charge!

调转所有船只。增加划手。

转动船身!
Rotate the ship!

994

准备开火!
Get ready to fire!

995
01:35:34,818 --> 01:35:37,196
长官！那是指挥部的风筝。
Sir! It's the command kite.

996
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:42,993
我们必须加入编队!
We must join the formation!

997
01:35:43,076 --> 01:35:45,078
再划快点!
Row harder!

01:35:50,667 --> 01:35:53,253
增加划手。全速前进!

01:35:53,337 --> 01:35:55,631
- 速度是对胜利的保证!- 是的，大人！

- Yes, sir!

1001
01:35:55,714 --> 01:35:57,591
补充更多的船桨!

1002
01:36:00,219 --> 01:36:02,429
划快点!
Row faster!

1003

再快一点！
Faster!

1004

用尽全力划!
Row with all your might!

1005
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:12,272
再快一点！
Faster!

1006
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:14,525
我们必须更快！
We must sail faster!

1007
01:36:20,197 --> 01:36:23,617
我要亲手毁掉你们，为真锅报仇。
I will avenge Manabe
by destroying you myself.

1008
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:27,371
倭舰正在逼近!
Wae ships are closing in!

1009
01:36:27,454 --> 01:36:29,039
开火！
Fire!

1010

射箭！
Shoot the arrows!

1011
01:36:44,513 --> 01:36:46,974
将军。他们在朝我们的船扔抓钩！
Admiral. They're grappling our ship!

1012
01:36:51,562 --> 01:36:52,938
切断绳索！
Cut the ropes!

1013
01:36:55,107 --> 01:36:57,192
我们必须恢复队形。
We must return to formation.

1014
01:37:11,248 --> 01:37:14,042
长官！鱼泳潭和李云龙指挥正在受到攻击。
Sir! Commanders Eo Young-dam
and Lee Un-ryong are under attack.

1015
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:24,386
大人!
Sir!

1016
01:37:24,469 --> 01:37:26,763
掩护他!
Cover for him!

1017
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:30,392
- 鱼指挥。- 跟着我！
- Commander Eo.
- Follow me!

1018
01:37:44,656 --> 01:37:48,744
鹤翼阵。不出所料。
Crane wing formation. As expected.

1019
01:37:50,287 --> 01:37:52,706
当我们用鱼鳞阵冲锋时，
Sahei can battle those ships

1020
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:54,875
佐平可以与之一战。
while we charge in fish-scale formation.

1021
01:37:54,958 --> 01:37:57,252
变阵鱼鳞阵!
Fish-scale formation!

1022
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:58,712
变阵鱼鳞阵!
Fish-scale formation!

1023
01:38:23,362 --> 01:38:25,030
前线的渡边报告说
Watanabe reports from the front rank

1024
01:38:25,113 --> 01:38:28,617
他将向右翼落后的敌船发起冲锋。
that he will charge at the ships
lagging behind at the right wing.

1025
01:38:28,700 --> 01:38:30,577
他的想法和我一样。
He thinks just like me.

1026
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,913
告诉他我允许了。
Tell him I permit the attack.

1027
01:38:32,996 --> 01:38:34,122
遵命，大人！
Yes, sir!

1028
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:39,878
赶紧的!
Hurry!

1029
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:43,257
向后划，装填大炮！
Row backward and load the cannons!

1030
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:45,175
开火！
Fire!

1031
01:38:49,888 --> 01:38:51,932
他到底在想什么？
What in the world is he thinking?

1032
01:38:52,015 --> 01:38:54,560
他不顾波涛汹涌，毫无章法地开火。
He's firing without order
despite the waves.

1033
01:38:54,643 --> 01:38:56,270
他应该更清楚!
He should know better!

1034
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:01,066
敌舰的速度太快了。
The enemy ships are too fast.

1035
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,319
我们应该更早地进攻。
We should've attacked sooner.

1036
01:39:04,403 --> 01:39:05,988
你这该死的李舜臣，
You blasted Yi Sun-shin,

1037
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:08,115
为什么还不开炮？
why aren't you firing?

1038
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:14,538
元将军的舰队正在影响我们的阵型。
Admiral Won's ships are weakening
our formation.

1039
01:39:14,621 --> 01:39:16,665
请下达开火命令吧。
Please give order to fire.

1040
01:39:19,543 --> 01:39:21,628
请下达命令吧，大人！
Please give order, sir!

1041
01:39:24,464 --> 01:39:27,009
在开火之前，我们必须完成阵型部署。
Before firing,
we must complete the formation.

1042
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:31,013
在倭国的三方原之战中，
In the Battle of Mikatagahara,

1043
01:39:31,096 --> 01:39:35,392
武田信玄摧毁了德川家的鹤翼阵，
Takeda Shingen destroyed
Tokugawa's crane wing formation

1044
01:39:35,475 --> 01:39:39,188
不是靠的刀枪。
