1
00:00:02,056 --> 00:00:07,103
I, Wakizaka, have defeated
Joseon's southern army,

2
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:12,024
achieving victory though far outnumbered.

3
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:17,280
I have aided our northern advance,
securing Joseon's capital Hanyang.

4
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:23,244
Only Joseon's navy continues to resurface

5
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:27,290
on the southern coast.

6
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:30,585
I now set out to destroy them.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,421
Lord Chancellor,

8
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:37,216
we will be ready for your arrival
as planned.

9
00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:41,762
Bunroku year one, Wakizaka of Awaji.

10
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:53,691
WAE ENEMY (FOREIGN ISLANDS) BASE,
BUSANPO, GYEONGSANG-DO, JUNE 1592

11
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,184
Thank you.

12
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:56,587
WAKIZAKA YASUHARU

13
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:58,297
Bokkaisen (sea monster)?

14
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:01,801
Dono. (lord)

15
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,887
Our foe Yi Sun-shin built a new ship.

16
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:06,848
It looked menacing,

17
00:02:07,515 --> 00:02:09,475
just like a Bokkaisen,

18
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,894
the mythical sea monster.

19
00:02:13,437 --> 00:02:15,690
Our guns were useless.

20
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:19,110
It had a dragon head spouting fire.

21
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:24,157
We were struck by sheer terror.

22
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:34,584
Bokkaisen, you say.

23
00:02:45,761 --> 00:02:47,555
Fear is a contagion.

24
00:03:09,494 --> 00:03:11,078
Was the ship rammed?

25
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:14,415
Wrecked off the Sacheon coast.

26
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:15,791
We hauled it here.

27
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:20,482
A MONTH AGO, SACHEON
GYEONGSANG-DO, SOUTHEAST JOSEON

28
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:27,656
CHIEF LEE EON-RYANG
Row backward!

29
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,741
We must break loose!

30
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:32,244
Row backward!

31
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:44,506
CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

32
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:56,310
Prepare to fire the dragon head
and all front cannons at once!

33
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,769
Load them now!

34
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:02,357
Fire!

35
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:14,077
It's the Bokkaisen!

36
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,625
Fire!

37
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,440
BUSAN FORTRESS

38
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,025
ON APRIL 13, 1592,

39
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,652
BUSAN FORTRESS WAS ATTACKED
BY WAE INVADERS.

40
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:11,905
HANYANG

41
00:07:11,988 --> 00:07:14,157
WAE FORCES OVERTOOK BUSAN FORTRESS,

42
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,076
OCCUPYING JOSEON'S CAPITAL HANYANG
IN 20 DAYS.

43
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:19,787
PYEONGYANG

44
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:25,043
KING SEONJO FLED NORTH TO PYEONGYANG
AS THE WAE INVADERS SWEPT NORTHWARD.

45
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,170
GWANGGYOSAN

46
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:30,465
50,000 SOLDIERS FROM THE PROVINCES JEOLLA,
GYEONGSANG, AND CHUNGCHEONG

47
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:34,052
GATHERED AT GWANGGYOSAN MOUNTAIN
TO RECAPTURE THE CAPITAL HANYANG.

48
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:36,095
GWANGGYOSAN MOUNTAIN, YONGIN

49
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:39,057
BUT ON JUNE 5, 1592,

50
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:45,146
WAKIZAKA AMBUSHED WITH 2,000 MEN,
DESTROYING JOSEON'S ARMY.

51
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:55,073
JOSEON APPEARED TO BE
ON THE BRINK OF RUIN.

52
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,495
MEANWHILE, ON THE SOUTHERN COAST
OF GOSEONG, GYEONGSANG-DO,

53
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:02,539
20 WAE SHIPS WERE DESTROYED AT DANGHANGPO

54
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:05,500
AS THE LEFT JEOLLA NAVY ADMIRAL
YI SUN-SHIN BATTLED ALONE AT SEA.

55
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,256
IN HIS FIRST NAVAL CAMPAIGN
ACROSS OKPO, HAPPO, AND JEOKJINPO,

56
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,424
HE DESTROYED 42 WAE SHIPS.

57
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:20,348
BATTLING IN HIS SECOND CAMPAIGN
ACROSS SACHEON, DANGPO, DANGHANPO,

58
00:08:20,932 --> 00:08:23,351
HE SUFFERED AN EARLY GUNSHOT WOUND.

59
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:31,025
HANSAN: RISING DRAGON

60
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,502
FIVE DAYS TILL THE THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

61
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,260
The turtle ship...

62
00:09:09,772 --> 00:09:12,108
Admiral. Sergeant Song reporting.

63
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,694
Admiral Won has arrived.

64
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:17,614
SERGEANT SONG HUI-RIP
I'll get ready. Send in the servant.

65
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:18,781
Yes, sir.

66
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:23,912
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS, YEOSU

67
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:28,124
What? A preemptive strike?

68
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:30,543
RIGHT GYEONGSANG NAVY, ADMIRAL WON GYUN
Have you gone mad?

69
00:09:30,627 --> 00:09:33,963
COMMANDER JUNG UN
We must hasten to recapture Busan.

70
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:37,634
Now is our time to catch
the Wae invaders off guard.

71
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:39,677
We must strike first.

72
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:44,974
Minor victories are useless
unless we attack their main base.

73
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:47,310
Well, well...

74
00:09:47,393 --> 00:09:51,940
You're still drunk
on those minor victories.

75
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:56,361
The enemy general in Busan led
the Battle of Gwanggyosan in Yongin.

76
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,906
Do you not recall
Chief Commander Lee Gwang,

77
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:03,284
who attacked the enemy
at Gwanggyosan Mountain?

78
00:10:03,368 --> 00:10:05,495
His men were annihilated!

79
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,165
He is blamed for the defeat,
deemed a traitor.

80
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:12,293
There is a tide of war.

81
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,713
We must defend, not attack!

82
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,928
Tell me. Do you agree with him?

83
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:25,974
Or have your underlings gone mad?

84
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:27,892
- Watch your words!
- Underlings?

85
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,186
Admiral Won,

86
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,438
RIGHT JEOLLA NAVY, ADMIRAL LEE EOK-GI
do you have a better idea?

87
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:36,109
Defense! Ironclad defense!

88
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:37,777
With an ironclad barrier on the sea,

89
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:40,822
we'll defend
the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

90
00:10:40,905 --> 00:10:43,658
I'll burn down the provisional
Right Gyeongsang Navy Headquarters,

91
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:45,243
joining you here instead.

92
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:49,957
With our joint fleet
fending off the enemy,

93
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,211
won't our headquarters here be
a steely fortress?

94
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,435
RIGHT GYEONGSANG NAVY
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

95
00:11:09,727 --> 00:11:13,397
An elder such as yourself
need not see me out.

96
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,858
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY, COMMANDER EO YOUNG-DAM
Since you're a former cadet

97
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,110
now busy as a commander,

98
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,280
this is an old teacher's chance

99
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:24,366
to enjoy rare company.

100
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:27,161
You're in good spirits as always.

101
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,038
And in good health, it seems.

102
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,915
By no means.

103
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:35,044
I'm suffering under a dreadful superior.

104
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:40,174
But you're no stranger
to dreadful superiors.

105
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,635
Alas, we suffer alike.

106
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,307
Good night, sir.

107
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,907
WAE (FOREIGN ISLANDS) ENEMY BASE,
BUSANPO, GYEONSANG-DO

108
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:10,204
The lord chancellor has

109
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,914
high hopes for you.

110
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,499
You are welcome here,

111
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,000
advisor.

112
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:17,962
I saw your men looking busy.

113
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,506
Isn't it too soon for haste?

114
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:26,220
KURODA KANBEI
LORD CHANCELLOR'S ADVISOR

115
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:29,306
Here.

116
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:33,227
The lord chancellor sends his reply.

117
00:12:47,616 --> 00:12:52,413
In the Battle of Yongin
at Gwanggyosan Mountain,

118
00:12:52,913 --> 00:12:56,458
do you know how I destroyed 50,000 men
with only 2,000?

119
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,043
Why,

120
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:04,925
you caught them unawares
with a preemptive ambush.

121
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,430
YEOSU
Yi Sun-shin's headquarters here

122
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:11,474
must be struck down immediately.

123
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,434
And then...

124
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:15,769
Then?

125
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,776
We must reinforce Konishi's division
up north in Pyeongyang.

126
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:24,445
Once we do,

127
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:28,616
our conquest of Joseon shall be complete.

128
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,618
Impressive.

129
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:33,370
Worthy of the lord chancellor's
preeminent warrior.

130
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:35,664
Konishi up north in Pyeongyang

131
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:38,167
will be beholden to you,
bowing in gratitude.

132
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,963
I thought you might hasten
like the other generals

133
00:13:43,631 --> 00:13:46,592
straight to Ming China.

134
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:49,303
I was concerned.

135
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:53,724
No doubt, you also crave

136
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:57,144
the conquest of Ming China.

137
00:13:57,228 --> 00:13:58,395
However,

138
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:02,483
I advise against a solo campaign.

139
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:06,153
As things now stand,
there is no need for risk.

140
00:14:08,823 --> 00:14:11,826
Better to lead a joint campaign
at full force.

141
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,078
I understand.

142
00:14:14,703 --> 00:14:15,871
Hence,

143
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,165
I have a request.

144
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,168
About Kato, I presume?

145
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,966
TURTLE SHIP DOCKYARD
LEFT JEOLLA NAVY HEADQUARTERS

146
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,343
You're removing the dragon head?

147
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,265
Since the Battle of Sacheon,
I've been thinking.

148
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:37,060
I stayed up nights
unable to shake the belief

149
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,478
that you need the turtle ship.

150
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:42,440
Will it no longer get lodged upon ramming?

151
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:47,154
It's the only way to solve that problem.

152
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,951
Will it also improve its speed?

153
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:54,494
Indeed, sir.

154
00:14:56,204 --> 00:14:59,124
A headless turtle ship...

155
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,468
Have you heard?

156
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,555
The latest Wae invaders to arrive
in Busan...

157
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,768
I hear they're quite formidable.

158
00:15:20,312 --> 00:15:23,231
How is Admiral Yi's order coming along?

159
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:24,900
Well...

160
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:26,693
GUNNERY MASTER
LEE BONG-SU

161
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:28,361
...we're gathering

162
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:30,989
all the gunpower ingredients we can,
sourcing it from the people.

163
00:15:31,907 --> 00:15:34,117
But the turtle ships guzzle so much.

164
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,077
Gunpowder-guzzling monsters, they are.

165
00:15:38,663 --> 00:15:40,999
The turtle ships can join
the admiral's fleet

166
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:42,626
only if you make haste.

167
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,880
The ramming ships must do more than ram.

168
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,465
Right.

169
00:15:50,926 --> 00:15:52,052
By the way,

170
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:56,264
this is for you.

171
00:15:59,142 --> 00:15:59,976
What's this?

172
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,230
I caught the critter myself.

173
00:16:03,772 --> 00:16:07,400
If you ever get lonely or discouraged,
it can cheer you up.

174
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:10,487
- Mocking me, are you?
- Take it easy.

175
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:15,450
Cook a turtle soup for your health
if you'd like.

176
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:19,871
Before you become a shell of a man.

177
00:16:19,955 --> 00:16:22,457
That impudence.

178
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,175
Defense! Ironclad defense!

179
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:35,178
We must defend, not attack!

180
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:41,935
I have a letter from Jeonju Fortress
sent by Chief Commander Lee Gwang.

181
00:16:46,857 --> 00:16:48,900
He was pained

182
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:53,280
to recall his defeat
at Gwanggyosan Mountain.

183
00:16:53,989 --> 00:16:55,991
The enemy Wakizaka

184
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:59,703
did not stay behind
to guard Suwon Fortress.

185
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:04,332
Instead, he advanced
to Yongin's Gwanggyosan Mountain,

186
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,335
tiring and luring our troops.

187
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,131
When our men lowered their guard,

188
00:17:11,214 --> 00:17:14,551
setting up camp in an open field,

189
00:17:15,093 --> 00:17:19,848
Wakizaka ambushed at dawn,
annihilating our army.

190
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:25,604
His stronghold was defended

191
00:17:25,687 --> 00:17:28,940
without a defensive strategy.

192
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,446
Admiral Yi.

193
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,160
His Majesty sends word.

194
00:17:52,797 --> 00:17:54,132
What has happened?

195
00:17:55,926 --> 00:17:58,345
We received word from Pyeongyang.

196
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:03,225
HIS MAJESTY HAS DEPARTED TO UIJU
BY THE NORTHWEST BORDER.

197
00:18:05,977 --> 00:18:08,688
How could he forsake Pyeongyang Fortress?

198
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:11,191
There is more at stake than Pyeongyang.

199
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,071
We must ask why His Majesty left for Uiju

200
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:16,823
by the northwest border.

201
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:21,118
The Chief Commander preferred
the northeast province Hamgyeong-do

202
00:18:21,202 --> 00:18:23,704
as a defensible base,

203
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:27,333
but His Majesty chose Uiju
by the northwest border instead.

204
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:30,461
Will His Majesty

205
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,130
seek refuge westward in Ming China?

206
00:18:35,007 --> 00:18:36,300
That cannot be.

207
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:40,429
It will destroy the people's morale

208
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:43,599
and threaten the fate of our land.

209
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:51,232
Based on our training
with Joseon prisoners,

210
00:18:51,691 --> 00:18:55,403
Joseon's navy cannons reach a firing range
of 1,000 yards.

211
00:18:56,154 --> 00:18:58,447
They are destructive within 500 yards.

212
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,994
WATANABE SHICHIEMON
They aim accurately within 100 yards.

213
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,622
One hundred yards.

214
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,792
Their panokseon (Joseon warships)

215
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,461
have a strange way of reloading cannons.

216
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:13,838
How so?

217
00:19:14,297 --> 00:19:17,091
Instead of reloading,
they rotate their ships,

218
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:20,303
firing from the other side.

219
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:24,056
Interesting.

220
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,018
However,

221
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:30,021
even if their panokseon ships refire
faster that way,

222
00:19:30,104 --> 00:19:33,024
we can press with speed
from 200 yards away,

223
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,817
overtaking their ships.

224
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,445
From 200 yards,

225
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:39,363
overtaking them.

226
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,911
Dono.

227
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:47,163
We must ambush again.

228
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:48,789
MANABE SAMANOSUKE
Deploy the fleet at once.

229
00:19:49,832 --> 00:19:53,294
If they block us,

230
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:59,634
we will crush that troublesome thing.

231
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:09,227
You mean the sea monster Bokkaisen,

232
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:13,940
or rather their mekurabune (blind ship)?

233
00:20:14,315 --> 00:20:15,775
Mekurabune.

234
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:18,194
Blind ship.

235
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:22,782
I like that name better than Bokkaisen.

236
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,661
The mekurabune fought only one battle.

237
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:28,287
But why?

238
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:31,374
Why won't they battle with a ship

239
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:33,918
rumored to be a monstrous Bokkaisen?

240
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:38,881
Sahei.

241
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,342
You have two days.

242
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:44,178
Go scout the Left Jeolla Navy.

243
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:47,640
Find out about the mekurabune.

244
00:20:48,307 --> 00:20:49,475
Also,

245
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,354
about Yi Sun-shin.

246
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:02,530
Watanabe.

247
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:06,742
About Kobayakawa
leading the sixth division

248
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:08,911
in Geumsan near Jeolla-do.

249
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:14,625
I must send word to him.

250
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:18,671
Admiral.

251
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:20,464
Admiral Yi.

252
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,970
Our headquarters here might be
His Majesty's last refuge.

253
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:27,972
Instead of rushing to battle,

254
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:31,184
perhaps we should guard this place
as Admiral Won suggested.

255
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:36,814
Will you still attack

256
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:39,692
the Wae invaders' base at Busan Fortress?

257
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:50,495
Does it look so in your eyes?

258
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,209
Is it not so?

259
00:21:57,502 --> 00:21:58,962
Perhaps it is.

260
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:02,883
But as Admiral Won has said,

261
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:05,886
we're on the defensive.

262
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:10,516
An attack on Busan requires caution.

263
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:13,435
If you will neither defend nor attack,

264
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:16,188
what is your battle plan?

265
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:21,902
Perhaps

266
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:25,197
our next battle will determine

267
00:22:27,074 --> 00:22:30,494
the fate of this war.

268
00:22:49,513 --> 00:22:50,973
HEUNGGUKSA TEMPLE REFUGE
Rice balls!

269
00:22:51,056 --> 00:22:52,141
Rice!

270
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:55,394
Please have some food.

271
00:23:08,699 --> 00:23:11,326
I saw that man at Busan Fortress.

272
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:22,671
Interesting.

273
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:25,174
- Be careful.
- All right.

274
00:23:50,282 --> 00:23:52,326
I have received your letter.

275
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:54,703
I appreciate the offer,

276
00:23:54,786 --> 00:24:00,083
but as commander of the sixth division,

277
00:24:00,167 --> 00:24:04,046
I, Kobayakawa, will attack Jeonju Fortress
as planned.

278
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:08,217
Now that Geumsan Fortress is cleared
of the Joseon people's militia,

279
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,054
I can soon advance on Jeonju Fortress
in Jeolla-do.

280
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:23,065
Transcribe my reply.

281
00:24:25,067 --> 00:24:29,613
Instead of attacking Jeonju Fortress
with the sixth division,

282
00:24:30,239 --> 00:24:33,158
I ask you to strike Yi Sun-shin's
Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

283
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:37,287
Do so, and I will grant you
all my conquests in Jeolla-do.

284
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:41,708
The war's outcome depends on
the Left Jeolla Navy, not Jeonju Fortress.

285
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:45,003
Now, join me in this attack,

286
00:24:45,087 --> 00:24:47,464
which will please the lord chancellor.

287
00:24:54,805 --> 00:24:55,806
Dono.

288
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:59,393
Will you grant Kobayakawa
all of Jeolla-do?

289
00:24:59,476 --> 00:25:02,312
Yi is a mere hindrance we can defeat
without his help.

290
00:25:02,396 --> 00:25:03,689
A mere hindrance?

291
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:09,653
How will you defeat Yi?

292
00:25:09,987 --> 00:25:13,448
By catching him off guard
with a preemptive strike!

293
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:15,117
As we did at Gwanggyosan!

294
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,035
Let's stay one step ahead.

295
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,745
We'll defeat him also on land.

296
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:22,166
It's a plan for total victory,
which I have while Yi doesn't.

297
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:25,460
- But we're ready...
- Joseon will fall soon.

298
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:28,255
The war will shift to Ming China.

299
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:30,465
By reaching Ming first,

300
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:33,093
we will conquer much more.

301
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:35,971
Jeolla-do pales in comparison.

302
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:38,390
Do you not understand?

303
00:25:38,765 --> 00:25:39,766
But

304
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,980
will Kato's fleet arrive in time?

305
00:25:44,063 --> 00:25:47,734
Kanbei is a man of his word.

306
00:25:47,817 --> 00:25:49,235
He will make it happen.

307
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,784
Why did your men at Sacheon join
the division at Geumsan near Jeolla?

308
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,705
Will they deploy from Geumsan
to attack Jeonju Fortress?

309
00:26:01,206 --> 00:26:02,707
When will they strike?

310
00:26:02,957 --> 00:26:04,375
I know nothing.

311
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:05,668
Nothing at all.

312
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:07,337
Nothing.

313
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:15,970
You fools!

314
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:18,765
Jeonju Fortress matters little.

315
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:21,976
Our Wae army is gathering

316
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,020
in great numbers in Busan.

317
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,857
Joseon will be annihilated

318
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:30,568
on our way to Ming China and India.

319
00:26:30,652 --> 00:26:34,364
You should beg for your lives!

320
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,013
Who are you?

321
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:06,062
- Admiral!
- Admiral!

322
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:07,313
Why, you!

323
00:27:07,814 --> 00:27:08,898
How dare you!

324
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:16,156
Dono!

325
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:18,533
What have they done to him?

326
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:20,410
Are you alright?

327
00:27:21,035 --> 00:27:22,036
Dono!

328
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:34,257
You're the reason we endure.

329
00:27:35,008 --> 00:27:39,095
You're a hero to us all!

330
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,271
Do not take his life.

331
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,274
I sense he has a veiled purpose.

332
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:24,682
This war...

333
00:28:26,684 --> 00:28:28,186
What is it about?

334
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:32,482
I beseech you to tell me.

335
00:28:32,732 --> 00:28:35,360
What is this war?

336
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:42,033
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

337
00:28:44,911 --> 00:28:48,414
Not a battle of nations?

338
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:51,918
No.

339
00:29:09,018 --> 00:29:12,230
I shot you at Sacheon.

340
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:16,943
I saw with my own eyes

341
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:22,157
how you stepped forth
to save your soldier.

342
00:29:26,996 --> 00:29:28,747
But my commander

343
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:31,709
used us men as shields

344
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:34,879
to save himself.

345
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:43,971
Please. Let me serve you.

346
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:03,991
NOKDUNDO ISLAND,
HAMGYEONG-DO (NORTHEAST BORDER)

347
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:38,127
Why did I dream of this?

348
00:32:08,782 --> 00:32:12,661
His stronghold was defended

349
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,540
without a defensive strategy.

350
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:24,340
Defended

351
00:32:24,423 --> 00:32:27,801
without a defensive strategy.

352
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:50,241
THREE DAYS TILL THE THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

353
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:03,754
Is this formation defensive? Or offensive?

354
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,759
Surely defensive.
Like a barrier on the sea.

355
00:33:09,928 --> 00:33:11,680
A barrier on the sea?

356
00:33:12,931 --> 00:33:14,182
Over there,

357
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:17,185
we're simulating the Wae invaders' attack.

358
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:31,283
It's quite realistic.

359
00:33:39,082 --> 00:33:40,542
Crane wing formation.

360
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:41,877
Yes, Admiral.

361
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:47,424
Crane wing formation!

362
00:33:47,507 --> 00:33:49,217
Crane wing formation!

363
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:59,686
We must move to the left wing.

364
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:00,770
Yes, sir.

365
00:34:01,938 --> 00:34:03,773
To the right wing's center.

366
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:05,025
On the double.

367
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,193
Yes, sir.

368
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:29,466
We're colliding!

369
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:32,385
Watch your position!

370
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:36,223
Go farther left!

371
00:34:36,306 --> 00:34:38,892
We're due at the left wing's center!

372
00:34:42,437 --> 00:34:45,148
The right wing looks unsteady.

373
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,277
Never mind. We'll go head-on.

374
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:01,540
- Raise the ladders.
- Raise them!

375
00:35:05,627 --> 00:35:06,795
Rotate the ship.

376
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:08,296
Rotate!

377
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,549
Port oars, stop!

378
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,803
Rotate!

379
00:35:15,011 --> 00:35:18,139
Starboard oars, row faster!

380
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,191
Back to formation!

381
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:30,277
Back to formation!

382
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:49,713
- Rotate.
- Rotate!

383
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,173
Rotate!

384
00:35:51,256 --> 00:35:54,092
Port oars, stop! Rotate!

385
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:20,035
Sir, we can't rotate
within such short distance.

386
00:36:20,452 --> 00:36:24,456
Not with Admiral Won's ships
that lack training.

387
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,336
Keep him in the formation.

388
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:33,006
And deliver this to Admiral Lee Eok-gi.

389
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:35,634
Yes, sir.

390
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:41,389
Rotate the ship!

391
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:56,823
Reporting, sir.

392
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,991
Since the Battle of Sacheon,

393
00:36:59,075 --> 00:37:00,910
the mekurabune was never seen in training.

394
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,376
There must be a problem
with the mekurabune.

395
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:11,128
We must find out what it is.

396
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:15,883
We'll enter their headquarters.

397
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:17,385
Let's move.

398
00:37:25,184 --> 00:37:27,478
- Fire!
- What do you want?

399
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:36,362
- Who are you?
- We're on your side.

400
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:47,999
The prisoners' cells are on fire!

401
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:50,960
The prisoners are escaping! After them!

402
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,964
No wonder you looked murderous for a monk.

403
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,175
Catch them! Catch the prisoners!

404
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:47,725
The turtle ship is in flames!

405
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,061
Put out the fire! Now!

406
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:12,917
Follow me.

407
00:39:28,808 --> 00:39:30,434
You call yourselves officers in charge?

408
00:39:30,685 --> 00:39:32,895
It's your duty to guard the turtle ship!

409
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:35,815
At all times with no exception!

410
00:39:35,898 --> 00:39:37,358
This is a failure in duty!

411
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,829
Admiral. I'm afraid the head spy escaped.

412
00:39:50,371 --> 00:39:51,414
We've failed you, sir.

413
00:39:51,497 --> 00:39:53,583
Move! Hurry up!

414
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,043
Hurry up!

415
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,170
Admiral.

416
00:39:57,378 --> 00:40:00,423
A few prisoners are missing.

417
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:03,467
Hurry up!

418
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:09,223
- Admiral.
- Any damages to the turtle ship?

419
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:11,726
CHIEF LEE GI-NAM
Some scorches. Nothing serious.

420
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:16,606
The head spy stole
the turtle ship's construction plans.

421
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:22,820
Where is Chief Nah?

422
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:26,407
At the Suncheon dockyard
since two days ago.

423
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:28,367
Let us go there.

424
00:40:43,467 --> 00:40:45,844
SECRET DOCKYARD, SUNCHEON, NEAR YEOSU

425
00:40:48,597 --> 00:40:50,682
This turtle ship has to be better!

426
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:53,268
Seal that joint!

427
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,566
Admiral! Admiral.

428
00:41:00,776 --> 00:41:03,570
I heard about the spies.

429
00:41:04,488 --> 00:41:07,783
I'm relieved
that the turtle ships weren't damaged.

430
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:10,994
I am told
you're reattaching the dragon head.

431
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:14,540
Yes, sir.

432
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:19,253
We must wage battle soon.

433
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:25,259
Will this turtle ship be ready?

434
00:41:25,926 --> 00:41:27,845
We're working night and day.

435
00:41:28,095 --> 00:41:30,639
We need a few more days.

436
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:36,645
The spies escaped

437
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:39,273
with your construction plans.

438
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:43,610
Wakizaka will learn
about the turtle ship's weaknesses.

439
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,904
Admiral.

440
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,949
This new turtle ship is different.

441
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:57,916
I will fight this battle
without turtle ships.

442
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,463
I must leave now.

443
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:07,843
Admiral.

444
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,559
The sides look weak.

445
00:42:16,351 --> 00:42:21,023
Good for firing cannons
but exposed to attack.

446
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:22,733
Also,

447
00:42:24,151 --> 00:42:27,029
the head and cover must be heavy.

448
00:42:28,322 --> 00:42:30,365
I wonder if it can sail with any speed.

449
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:35,746
Junsa, was it?

450
00:42:37,998 --> 00:42:40,459
So you fought against the ship.

451
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:44,171
Yes, at the Battle of Sacheon.

452
00:42:44,379 --> 00:42:47,799
Indeed, its movement seemed quite slow.

453
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:49,426
Go on.

454
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:51,136
At Sacheon,

455
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,639
we fell for Yi's luring tactic.

456
00:42:53,889 --> 00:42:55,307
Luring tactic?

457
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:56,892
Yes, sir.

458
00:42:57,935 --> 00:42:59,102
However,

459
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:01,271
as you pointed out,

460
00:43:01,355 --> 00:43:04,691
we could've easily destroyed the ship

461
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:08,654
had we been prepared.

462
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:13,075
Once it rammed into our warship,

463
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:15,202
the dragon head was lodged,
unable to move.

464
00:43:15,285 --> 00:43:17,454
The dragon head was lodged?

465
00:43:17,538 --> 00:43:18,539
Yes, sir.

466
00:43:22,668 --> 00:43:25,212
So, that was the flaw.

467
00:43:28,048 --> 00:43:30,551
A flawed ram.

468
00:43:33,971 --> 00:43:35,055
And yet,

469
00:43:35,389 --> 00:43:39,601
it was called the Bokkaisen,
striking terror in our men.

470
00:43:41,645 --> 00:43:45,983
Are you implying it was a false rumor?

471
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:51,238
Watanabe.

472
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,323
What do you think?

473
00:43:53,907 --> 00:43:55,826
Since it was absent from training,

474
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,871
it probably won't be deployed.

475
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,206
However, I'm concerned

476
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:05,127
by Sahei's report
regarding their crane wing formation.

477
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:10,174
It appears to be an offensive.

478
00:44:10,382 --> 00:44:13,218
I suspect they will surround Busanpo
to mount an attack.

479
00:44:13,302 --> 00:44:14,761
No, sir.

480
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:17,139
Yi was using prisoners

481
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:20,309
to prepare defensive tactics.

482
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:23,396
Besides, without the mekurabune,

483
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:24,939
he cannot risk an attack.

484
00:44:25,023 --> 00:44:27,942
Dono. These are baseless claims.

485
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:29,110
Enough.

486
00:44:30,445 --> 00:44:31,446
Junsa.

487
00:44:34,032 --> 00:44:35,241
Come closer.

488
00:44:45,877 --> 00:44:47,086
Closer.

489
00:44:58,431 --> 00:45:01,184
Justify your claim.

490
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:10,193
Even their king has fled

491
00:45:11,069 --> 00:45:13,279
to the northwest border.

492
00:45:13,988 --> 00:45:17,158
Hence, Yi will be looking to retreat.

493
00:45:17,534 --> 00:45:20,119
He wouldn't dare advance in attack.

494
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:32,048
I must say,

495
00:45:32,924 --> 00:45:35,093
it's decent reasoning.

496
00:45:47,897 --> 00:45:50,650
Dono. Kato's fleet has arrived.

497
00:46:09,752 --> 00:46:13,214
Arriving at the perfect time.

498
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,268
KATO YOSHIAKI

499
00:46:28,605 --> 00:46:31,149
KUKI YOSHITAKA

500
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:37,322
The war god Hachiman

501
00:46:38,865 --> 00:46:40,867
shines on me again.

502
00:47:02,013 --> 00:47:03,431
Admiral!

503
00:47:05,934 --> 00:47:08,436
Can you win your battle
without the turtle ship?

504
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:14,818
Can you truly win without the turtle ship?

505
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,214
Your wound has yet to heal.
Yet you're shooting arrows already.

506
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:46,307
Admiral.

507
00:47:46,933 --> 00:47:49,727
I'm convinced by our training

508
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:52,730
that we need the turtle ships.

509
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:55,859
Do you not agree?

510
00:47:59,737 --> 00:48:00,780
Admiral.

511
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:07,246
Sir,

512
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:11,208
Lim Jun-young brought his report
in person.

513
00:48:13,419 --> 00:48:14,545
In person?

514
00:48:16,422 --> 00:48:19,341
Until now, Wakizaka's fleet

515
00:48:19,425 --> 00:48:22,344
had 30 large ships, 70 medium ships,

516
00:48:22,428 --> 00:48:24,597
One hundred ships total.

517
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,558
Kato Yoshiaki's fleet
from the southern island Daemado

518
00:48:27,641 --> 00:48:30,561
has now joined him
with 20 large ships and 20 small ships.

519
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:32,980
That makes 140 ships total.

520
00:48:33,063 --> 00:48:36,442
Wakizaka's wait is over.
He will deploy soon.

521
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:37,818
The time has arrived.

522
00:48:37,902 --> 00:48:38,986
But sir,

523
00:48:39,069 --> 00:48:42,114
Kato's ships are unique.

524
00:48:42,656 --> 00:48:43,699
Unique?

525
00:48:44,408 --> 00:48:47,328
Several large ships have thicker hulls

526
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:50,915
and suspended cannons
we haven't seen before.

527
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:53,417
As for their flagship,

528
00:48:53,501 --> 00:48:57,755
it's armed with cannons
and covered in iron plates.

529
00:48:57,963 --> 00:49:01,467
A flagship covered in iron plates?

530
00:49:02,218 --> 00:49:03,969
It is as expected.

531
00:49:04,053 --> 00:49:09,058
They prepared
against our cannons and rams.

532
00:49:09,517 --> 00:49:10,518
This enemy fleet...

533
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:14,063
COMMANDER GWON JUN
...will attack to secure a supply route

534
00:49:14,146 --> 00:49:16,398
to the western coast.

535
00:49:16,482 --> 00:49:18,484
The enemy's ground troops are gathered...

536
00:49:18,567 --> 00:49:21,070
COMMANDER SHIN HO
...at Geumsan near Jeonju Fortress.

537
00:49:21,153 --> 00:49:23,030
They will fight on two fronts at sea
and on land.

538
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:27,201
They will attack both Jeonju Fortress
and the Left Jeolla Navy.

539
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,787
If our navy falls as the enemy wishes,

540
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,331
Joseon's regime in Uiju will also fall.

541
00:49:36,502 --> 00:49:40,631
We will surely face attack,
but Jeonju is under greater threat.

542
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,758
The Battle of Yongin has left

543
00:49:42,842 --> 00:49:46,762
Chief Commander Lee Gwang
crippled by defeat.

544
00:49:47,972 --> 00:49:51,892
In any case,
we must alert Jeonju Fortress.

545
00:49:52,351 --> 00:49:55,813
Shouldn't we split our forces
to reinforce the army at Jeonju Fortress?

546
00:49:55,896 --> 00:49:59,608
Have you gone mad?
We cannot split the navy.

547
00:49:59,984 --> 00:50:01,527
Out of the question!

548
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:04,280
Hold your anger. I merely speak as I must.

549
00:50:04,363 --> 00:50:05,656
Enough.

550
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:10,244
Admiral Yi.

551
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,955
How will you proceed?

552
00:50:38,147 --> 00:50:40,608
The time has come for a critical battle.

553
00:50:41,817 --> 00:50:42,860
Hence...

554
00:50:47,823 --> 00:50:51,118
tomorrow at midnight,
we shall set out to war.

555
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:53,287
Prepare for deployment.

556
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,039
Instead of defending?

557
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,973
Load the shells and gunpowder!

558
00:51:13,933 --> 00:51:15,142
Careful!

559
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:20,064
As ordered,

560
00:51:20,147 --> 00:51:22,274
GUNNERY MASTER LEE BONG-SU
we stockpiled all the gunpowder we could.

561
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:23,609
Well done.

562
00:51:23,692 --> 00:51:27,279
Why do you need more than usual?

563
00:51:28,948 --> 00:51:30,282
For double-loading cannons

564
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,788
with both shells and shrapnel shells.

565
00:51:37,122 --> 00:51:41,919
That will cause damage
only within short range.

566
00:51:42,628 --> 00:51:44,380
- The enemy ships will close in...
- Noted.

567
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,384
Is Chief Nah on his way?

568
00:52:18,915 --> 00:52:22,377
Let's enjoy this drink together.

569
00:52:26,882 --> 00:52:28,133
By the way,

570
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:31,344
what kind of man is this Admiral Yi?

571
00:52:31,636 --> 00:52:34,514
A surprisingly strong foe.

572
00:52:34,598 --> 00:52:37,809
That is why we must face him together.

573
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,397
Joseon's commanders have been weak,
I heard.

574
00:52:43,106 --> 00:52:46,026
Yi must be the exception.

575
00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:50,489
Now that two war heroes have
joined us here,

576
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:53,492
Yi will not stand a chance.

577
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:58,705
This dull war will end sooner
than expected.

578
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:04,628
Dono.

579
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:08,006
We received word
from Kobayakawa's sixth division.

580
00:53:15,889 --> 00:53:17,599
Everyone out.

581
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:19,976
Everyone out.

582
00:53:21,019 --> 00:53:24,648
Dither at your peril if you wish to die!

583
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:27,776
Hurry up!

584
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:38,036
Kobayakawa agreed to the inland attack
against the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

585
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:39,746
In that case,

586
00:53:40,997 --> 00:53:42,207
when will he deploy?

587
00:53:42,332 --> 00:53:43,333
He asked

588
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:46,962
that you decide when and send your reply.

589
00:53:49,631 --> 00:53:50,632
If so,

590
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:53,385
we set out tonight at midnight.

591
00:53:55,762 --> 00:53:57,097
Absurd!

592
00:53:57,389 --> 00:54:00,350
You can't do so without consulting me!

593
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:04,187
Wakizaka, please reconsider.

594
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:06,773
For procedure's sake.

595
00:54:06,857 --> 00:54:09,609
We must attack
before the typhoon season arrives.

596
00:54:09,943 --> 00:54:11,319
Pardon the haste.

597
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,988
You scoundrel!

598
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:17,450
Stop!

599
00:54:23,665 --> 00:54:26,543
Your crude manner will cost you
my alliance.

600
00:54:26,626 --> 00:54:29,796
You take war too lightly, Wakizaka!

601
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:35,010
Don't be rash,

602
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,803
Kato.

603
00:54:37,846 --> 00:54:39,097
Sit down.

604
00:54:39,389 --> 00:54:40,807
Calm down.

605
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:43,643
Kato. Put down your sword.

606
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,648
I demand an answer.

607
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:50,108
Tell me.

608
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:52,527
Do you wish to join forces with me or not?

609
00:54:55,822 --> 00:54:57,365
Our dislike is mutual.

610
00:54:57,782 --> 00:54:59,117
However,

611
00:55:00,368 --> 00:55:03,205
the lord chancellor ordered
our joint attack.

612
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:06,583
Withdraw your sword,

613
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:10,128
and I'll overlook this outburst.

614
00:55:13,882 --> 00:55:15,008
Kato.

615
00:55:25,727 --> 00:55:26,686
Kato!

616
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:07,603
You can come out now.

617
00:56:18,281 --> 00:56:20,616
Thank you. I heard crucial information.

618
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:22,952
I must report back at once
to the Left Jeolla Navy.

619
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:33,462
I've been watching you.

620
00:56:33,546 --> 00:56:36,424
So that wench slipped you in.

621
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:44,640
Remarkable.

622
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:48,769
Even the courtesans are spies.

623
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,939
What a disappointment.

624
00:56:53,649 --> 00:56:55,693
I'd hoped to take you with me.

625
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:08,498
Die!

626
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:10,208
Dono!

627
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:17,006
Stand back!

628
00:57:17,882 --> 00:57:19,008
Run!

629
00:57:28,226 --> 00:57:29,435
Sahei!

630
00:57:29,894 --> 00:57:31,354
After him! Now!

631
00:57:31,646 --> 00:57:32,772
You stay here!

632
00:57:34,649 --> 00:57:35,775
Follow me, Manabe!

633
00:57:42,657 --> 00:57:44,367
How much does he know?

634
00:57:45,034 --> 00:57:45,993
Tell me.

635
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:52,208
There he is! By the shore!

636
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:54,377
- Hurry.
- After him.

637
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,128
Get in.

638
00:58:02,718 --> 00:58:03,803
Fire!

639
00:58:13,396 --> 00:58:14,981
Aim the fire arrows!

640
00:58:15,314 --> 00:58:16,566
Release!

641
00:58:21,612 --> 00:58:22,613
Release!

642
00:58:33,082 --> 00:58:34,041
No.

643
00:58:35,042 --> 00:58:36,627
Not until you spill everything you know.

644
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:46,470
Dono, We've failed you.

645
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:48,681
Please take our lives.

646
00:58:50,808 --> 00:58:52,685
Hunt down all the spies.

647
00:58:53,352 --> 00:58:54,562
Also,

648
00:58:55,688 --> 00:58:57,064
keep her alive.

649
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:14,832
Please! I'm no spy!

650
00:59:15,541 --> 00:59:17,251
I'm not!

651
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,096
Perhaps now is the time

652
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:31,433
to break with the past,

653
00:59:32,643 --> 00:59:35,270
tying up all loose ends.

654
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:38,357
Please don't kill me!

655
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,399
Strike!

656
00:59:50,744 --> 00:59:53,747
DAY ONE, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN

657
01:00:02,965 --> 01:00:06,385
We've reached Dangpo, our midway stopover.
Report to Admiral Yi.

658
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:07,678
Yes, sir.

659
01:00:41,712 --> 01:00:43,672
We're allies! Stop!

660
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:45,132
Kill him, too!

661
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:52,723
Wakizaka!

662
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:23,212
Tell me.

663
01:01:23,295 --> 01:01:25,464
Who is backing you?

664
01:01:25,756 --> 01:01:27,549
Is it Kanbei?

665
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,719
Given our mutual hatred,

666
01:01:30,802 --> 01:01:33,305
you and I will only clash
if we join forces.

667
01:01:33,597 --> 01:01:36,350
Surrender your ships and begone.

668
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:38,060
Do so,

669
01:01:39,353 --> 01:01:41,522
and I'll let you live.

670
01:01:42,523 --> 01:01:46,610
You expect to steal my iron-plated ship
without retribution?

671
01:01:54,868 --> 01:01:56,495
Mark my words.

672
01:01:56,578 --> 01:01:58,372
I will repay this insult.

673
01:02:06,171 --> 01:02:08,215
Now I know.

674
01:02:08,882 --> 01:02:12,386
From the start, you had this planned.

675
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:15,514
But my ships won't matter.

676
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:24,147
Begone if you care to live!

677
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:48,589
Summoned by the lord chancellor,

678
01:02:48,672 --> 01:02:51,175
I've returned to Osaka Castle.

679
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:54,970
Wakizaka, you shall now demolish
the Joseon navy

680
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:58,140
and reach Ming China's Tianjin.

681
01:02:58,223 --> 01:03:00,434
Conquer the land!

682
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:02,145
Once you do,

683
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,023
the lord chancellor will bypass Joseon,

684
01:03:05,648 --> 01:03:09,402
proceeding straight to Ming.

685
01:03:10,737 --> 01:03:13,323
You shall be the one

686
01:03:13,406 --> 01:03:15,366
to welcome him there.

687
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:19,370
The golden fan reflects
the lord chancellor's wishes.

688
01:03:19,454 --> 01:03:22,999
Treasure it.

689
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:28,713
Brothers,

690
01:03:30,548 --> 01:03:34,928
we will overtake Konishi's 1st
and Kiyomasa's 2nd divisions

691
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:38,890
as the first to reach Ming China.

692
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:40,266
Dono!

693
01:03:40,725 --> 01:03:43,770
We congratulate you!

694
01:04:20,098 --> 01:04:21,599
Row faster!

695
01:04:30,358 --> 01:04:33,027
Dono. Yi deployed his fleet.

696
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:36,531
His ships are nearby, already at Dangpo.

697
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,453
I see.

698
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,167
A strong foe indeed.

699
01:04:59,345 --> 01:05:00,513
Between Dangpo

700
01:05:02,223 --> 01:05:03,892
and our current base Ungpo.

701
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:07,770
Look here.

702
01:05:11,024 --> 01:05:14,861
This narrow sea route between us,
Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

703
01:05:15,153 --> 01:05:17,739
GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

704
01:05:18,656 --> 01:05:20,158
Are you reminded of anywhere?

705
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:22,535
In the Battle of Yongin,

706
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:25,205
there was a narrow pass
en route to Hanyang.

707
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,540
In Gwanggyosan, was it not?

708
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:34,130
We'll sail to Gyeonnaeryang,
lying in ambush.

709
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:38,510
We'll wait for Yi's next move.

710
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:42,931
- Now go.
- Yes, sir!

711
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:55,443
DANGPO, JOSEON NAVY'S MIDWAY STOPOVER

712
01:05:57,737 --> 01:06:00,240
I've sworn allegiance to Admiral Yi.

713
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:05,036
There is no time. You must go alone now.

714
01:06:06,621 --> 01:06:10,500
Many lives were lost
to secure that report.

715
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,797
Deliver it without fail to Admiral Yi.

716
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:38,570
Hurry! We must pass Ungchi!

717
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:47,746
Ungchi... leads
to the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters.

718
01:06:49,456 --> 01:06:51,750
Hurry the rear guard! There is no time!

719
01:06:53,752 --> 01:06:56,338
The shortcut to Jeonju Fortress is
this way...

720
01:07:20,988 --> 01:07:23,407
DANGPO, JOSEON NAVY'S MIDWAY STOPOVER

721
01:07:23,908 --> 01:07:26,410
We've checked these areas.

722
01:07:26,494 --> 01:07:29,413
Now we're searching
near Angolpo and Ungpo...

723
01:07:29,497 --> 01:07:34,084
So, have you located
the hidden enemy fleet?

724
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:37,713
We will, soon enough.

725
01:07:37,796 --> 01:07:40,758
I was loath to turn my back so soon

726
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:44,053
immediately upon arrival yesterday.

727
01:07:44,136 --> 01:07:47,723
But if the enemy is not found today,

728
01:07:47,806 --> 01:07:52,394
I will withdraw my men
to help defend Jeonju Fortress.

729
01:07:53,395 --> 01:07:56,106
We'll locate them today.

730
01:08:00,528 --> 01:08:02,696
Admiral. We've found the enemy.

731
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:05,533
- Where?
- Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

732
01:08:08,536 --> 01:08:11,163
Gyeonnaeryang is nearby.

733
01:08:11,497 --> 01:08:14,166
Around 100 Wae ships are docked there.

734
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:23,384
GYEONNAERYANG
DANGPO

735
01:08:27,346 --> 01:08:28,889
We must attack at once.

736
01:08:28,973 --> 01:08:30,558
Fortune is on our side.

737
01:08:31,225 --> 01:08:33,143
They're docked at Gyeonnaeryang

738
01:08:33,769 --> 01:08:37,398
because they know
our fleet has sailed out to these shores.

739
01:08:37,481 --> 01:08:39,942
That changes nothing.

740
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:41,986
We must be cautious.

741
01:08:50,161 --> 01:08:51,537
Remove the other tables.

742
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:52,621
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

743
01:09:03,382 --> 01:09:07,469
We must lure them here
to the open sea of Hansan.

744
01:09:07,553 --> 01:09:08,971
Gyeonnaeryang is too narrow.

745
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:12,474
Our panokseon warships
cannot battle there.

746
01:09:12,683 --> 01:09:13,934
I disagree.

747
01:09:14,393 --> 01:09:16,228
Narrow or not,

748
01:09:16,312 --> 01:09:21,483
it'll be easier to attack
while the enemy is docked.

749
01:09:22,276 --> 01:09:26,071
Wouldn't our previous battle formations
suit the circumstances?

750
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:32,620
Strong currents in the strait will hinder
our ships' movement.

751
01:09:33,204 --> 01:09:35,206
Many will be destroyed.

752
01:09:35,706 --> 01:09:38,709
Also, the attack may be ineffective

753
01:09:38,792 --> 01:09:40,461
if the enemy flees to shore.

754
01:09:42,254 --> 01:09:45,424
A leader in war should not shy away

755
01:09:45,508 --> 01:09:47,593
from small damages.

756
01:09:47,676 --> 01:09:49,970
And if the enemy flees to shore,

757
01:09:50,054 --> 01:09:53,516
they can only run to Geojedo Island.

758
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:56,644
Since they'll be cut off
from reinforcement,

759
01:09:57,061 --> 01:10:01,357
we can hunt them down
for a rare victory on land.

760
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,442
I say we strike at them.

761
01:10:04,318 --> 01:10:06,195
In that case,

762
01:10:06,278 --> 01:10:09,532
why don't you take lead
with the first attack?

763
01:10:09,615 --> 01:10:10,616
What?

764
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:14,787
You want only my ships to get battered
and destroyed in vain?

765
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:21,377
I want you to lure the enemy ships
to this open sea of Hansan.

766
01:10:23,087 --> 01:10:25,422
Lure out the fleet?

767
01:10:28,384 --> 01:10:29,803
To battle

768
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:33,515
in crane wing formation?

769
01:10:35,934 --> 01:10:40,021
Is that what you meant
by a barrier on the sea?

770
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:44,192
But I'm no fool.

771
01:10:44,276 --> 01:10:46,653
I can't attack
with only seven ships in my fleet.

772
01:10:46,736 --> 01:10:49,114
That's a suicide mission.

773
01:10:49,197 --> 01:10:52,159
Wakizaka is no fool either.

774
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:54,452
You think he'll be lured so easily?

775
01:10:54,995 --> 01:10:57,539
I'll take no part in this reckless plan.

776
01:10:58,707 --> 01:10:59,791
Admiral Won!

777
01:11:00,834 --> 01:11:02,919
The enemy is right before us.

778
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:06,381
A barrier on the sea? Nonsense!

779
01:11:06,464 --> 01:11:09,301
I'll help defend Jeonju Fortress instead.

780
01:11:09,634 --> 01:11:11,845
As a hyangdo (naval guide),
I can lure the enemy.

781
01:11:17,642 --> 01:11:21,855
I know the waterways around Gyeonnaeryang.

782
01:11:23,064 --> 01:11:24,941
Let me lure the enemy.

783
01:11:26,276 --> 01:11:27,527
I shall go instead.

784
01:11:31,948 --> 01:11:35,619
The task should not fall
to the elderly commander.

785
01:11:35,702 --> 01:11:37,746
It is not befitting.

786
01:11:38,872 --> 01:11:42,250
Please. Send me instead.

787
01:11:42,459 --> 01:11:45,212
Admiral, I agree.

788
01:11:45,879 --> 01:11:48,965
CAPTAIN LEE YEONG-NAM
Please send us instead.

789
01:11:49,382 --> 01:11:52,928
I see you two are now serving Admiral Yi.

790
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:55,847
Admiral.

791
01:11:56,806 --> 01:11:59,226
It's the last wish of an old commander.

792
01:11:59,684 --> 01:12:01,144
Please grant it.

793
01:12:09,486 --> 01:12:11,863
CRANE WING FORMATION PLAN

794
01:12:11,947 --> 01:12:14,366
A barrier on the sea? Nonsense!

795
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,744
What is your battle plan?

796
01:12:18,245 --> 01:12:21,998
Will the crane wing formation
ensure victory?

797
01:12:33,718 --> 01:12:36,596
CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

798
01:12:37,055 --> 01:12:39,599
Admiral. Sergeant Song reporting.

799
01:12:41,852 --> 01:12:42,978
Come in.

800
01:12:45,313 --> 01:12:46,523
What brings you here?

801
01:12:50,026 --> 01:12:52,737
A report requiring secrecy.

802
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:55,824
It's from Junsa.

803
01:13:08,295 --> 01:13:10,213
Kobayakawa's troops left Geumsan to attack

804
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:13,341
the Left Jeolla Navy Headquarters,
not Jeonju Fortress.

805
01:13:13,758 --> 01:13:15,510
The enemy's army and navy

806
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:18,305
will strike in unison.

807
01:13:19,014 --> 01:13:22,184
Their fleet was deployed
on the fifth at midnight.

808
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:26,354
If their ground troops bypass
Jeonju Fortress

809
01:13:26,438 --> 01:13:27,898
to strike our headquarters,

810
01:13:28,315 --> 01:13:29,774
it will be a critical blow.

811
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,235
Have you alerted Jeonju Fortress?

812
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:34,613
Junsa is on his way to alert them.

813
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:36,698
If so,

814
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:41,036
who delivered this report instead of him?

815
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:55,425
UNGCHI PASS

816
01:13:55,509 --> 01:13:57,594
Fasten the cannons tightly!

817
01:13:57,677 --> 01:13:59,679
I don't trust the anti-Wae fighter.

818
01:13:59,763 --> 01:14:01,431
ANTI-WAE FIGHTER:
FORMER WAE SOLDIER FIGHTING FOR JOSEON

819
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:04,017
Why would the enemy bypass Jeonju Fortress

820
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:05,727
to attack the navy headquarters?

821
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:08,480
Let's get rid of that anti-Wae fighter

822
01:14:08,563 --> 01:14:11,066
and march to Jeonju as planned.

823
01:14:11,149 --> 01:14:13,068
RIGHTEOUS MILITIA COMMANDER, HWANG BAK
Once the enemy passes Ungchi,

824
01:14:13,151 --> 01:14:15,404
it's only a half-day's march
to the navy headquarters.

825
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:17,949
We'll receive orders soon.

826
01:14:18,032 --> 01:14:20,576
Until then, we must defend this pass.

827
01:14:49,313 --> 01:14:50,773
So you're the anti-Wae fighter?

828
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:53,192
Follow me.

829
01:15:15,506 --> 01:15:17,300
If we survive this,

830
01:15:18,593 --> 01:15:20,970
I'll treat you to a hearty drink.

831
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:32,773
Wait.

832
01:15:41,949 --> 01:15:43,743
No need for that.

833
01:15:44,994 --> 01:15:48,289
A shared, righteous spirit.
That's all you need.

834
01:15:49,165 --> 01:15:51,000
Get some armor instead.

835
01:16:04,222 --> 01:16:07,350
CRANE WING FORMATION PLAN

836
01:16:19,111 --> 01:16:23,574
We will use the enemy's attack
to surround their fleet.

837
01:16:23,991 --> 01:16:28,371
In the sea of Hansan,
we will battle in crane wing formation.

838
01:16:29,872 --> 01:16:32,333
Flanking the flagship

839
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:35,586
on the right wing's center will be
Admiral Lee Eok-gi.

840
01:16:36,546 --> 01:16:38,339
On the left wing's center,

841
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:46,597
there will be Admiral Won.

842
01:16:48,182 --> 01:16:51,853
By his side,
there'll be the wise Commander Eo,

843
01:16:51,936 --> 01:16:55,982
the hyangdo (naval guide)
well versed in Joseon's waterways.

844
01:16:56,482 --> 01:17:00,945
Commander Lee Un-ryong,
who offers trustworthy counsel,

845
01:17:01,028 --> 01:17:04,365
shall be next to him.

846
01:17:05,074 --> 01:17:08,244
Captain Kim Wan,
who maneuvers with great skill,

847
01:17:08,327 --> 01:17:12,290
will be at the tip of the left wing.

848
01:17:13,207 --> 01:17:15,418
Commander Gwon Jun

849
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:19,338
has the speed and strength
to wage close combat

850
01:17:19,422 --> 01:17:21,299
at the tip of the right wing.

851
01:17:22,383 --> 01:17:26,596
As a proven warrior who leads
our navy's most forceful charges,

852
01:17:26,679 --> 01:17:28,890
Commander Jung Un will be...

853
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:03,467
TO CHIEF NAH DAE-YONG

854
01:18:27,157 --> 01:18:30,202
Were all ships ordered
to double-load their cannons?

855
01:18:30,285 --> 01:18:31,328
Yes, sir.

856
01:18:31,411 --> 01:18:34,832
We gave orders to double-load shells
and shrapnel shells.

857
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:44,132
Prepare for deployment.

858
01:18:44,716 --> 01:18:45,717
Yes, sir.

859
01:19:04,903 --> 01:19:06,905
All ships to war.

860
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:11,243
All ships!

861
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:12,953
To war!

862
01:19:13,036 --> 01:19:14,037
To war!

863
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:14,997
To war!

864
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:15,914
To war!

865
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:18,167
- To war!
- To war!

866
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:31,763
DAY FOUR, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
BATTLE OF HANSAN ISLAND

867
01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:38,437
GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

868
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:50,574
Dono! Yi has deployed his fleet.

869
01:19:50,866 --> 01:19:53,785
Fifty six ships set sail from Dangpo.
All panokseon warships,

870
01:19:53,869 --> 01:19:56,622
no mekurabune (blind ship) to be seen.

871
01:19:58,248 --> 01:20:00,459
Could it be a deception?

872
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:02,419
Never mind the mekurabune.

873
01:20:14,306 --> 01:20:16,308
You two will wait in ambush
on the right and left flanks.

874
01:20:16,391 --> 01:20:17,476
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

875
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:45,128
We must lure out the enemy.

876
01:20:45,963 --> 01:20:49,675
Stay at least 200 yards away
from their ships.

877
01:20:49,758 --> 01:20:50,884
Yes, sir.

878
01:21:01,562 --> 01:21:03,397
Lower the anchor!

879
01:21:08,026 --> 01:21:11,697
LEFT FLANK
MANABE SAMANOSUKE

880
01:21:14,575 --> 01:21:17,786
RIGHT FLANK
WATANABE SHICHIEMON

881
01:21:33,051 --> 01:21:35,179
Enemy ships! Enemy ships ahead!

882
01:21:45,607 --> 01:21:48,318
Hold fire! Find the enemy ships!

883
01:21:59,162 --> 01:22:00,246
Fire!

884
01:22:01,331 --> 01:22:03,166
Rank two, prepare to fire!

885
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:07,003
Sahei. How many ships?

886
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:09,839
We cannot count yet.

887
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:12,342
Hold positions.

888
01:22:12,425 --> 01:22:15,261
Keep the enemy at bay by returning fire.

889
01:22:15,345 --> 01:22:17,680
Deplete their firepower.

890
01:22:17,764 --> 01:22:21,100
- Yes, sir!
- To the right! Fire!

891
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:25,688
Hold fire!

892
01:22:39,494 --> 01:22:42,580
To the left! They're on the left!

893
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,209
Fire!

894
01:22:57,929 --> 01:23:02,183
Commander Manabe on the left flank
asks if he may attack.

895
01:23:04,185 --> 01:23:06,646
Commander Watanabe on the right flank
asks the same.

896
01:23:06,938 --> 01:23:10,275
Tell them to stay in position
and hold fire.

897
01:23:10,358 --> 01:23:12,235
They must wait in ambush.

898
01:23:12,527 --> 01:23:13,528
Yes, sir!

899
01:23:21,619 --> 01:23:23,913
Commander. I will reverse the ship.

900
01:23:24,122 --> 01:23:26,249
Advance 100 yards.

901
01:23:26,332 --> 01:23:27,667
We should stop here.

902
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:29,586
We'll be surrounded by the enemy!

903
01:23:29,669 --> 01:23:32,547
At this rate, the enemy won't budge.

904
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:36,092
We must deliver a blow to lure them out.

905
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:37,468
Row forward!

906
01:23:38,428 --> 01:23:39,470
Yes, sir!

907
01:23:45,143 --> 01:23:50,481
OUTSIDE GYEONNAERYANG STRAIT

908
01:23:58,031 --> 01:23:59,866
Will the enemy be lured?

909
01:24:09,042 --> 01:24:12,420
Deploy the ships on standby.

910
01:24:13,046 --> 01:24:14,631
Yes, sir.

911
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:42,033
Commander! The fog is clearing.

912
01:24:42,116 --> 01:24:44,953
We're running low on gunpowder and shells.
We must retreat!

913
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:53,419
Cannon fire! They're firing cannons!

914
01:24:54,504 --> 01:24:56,005
Firing cannons?

915
01:25:09,811 --> 01:25:11,104
Fire!

916
01:25:17,902 --> 01:25:20,989
The fog is clearing! We can see the ships!

917
01:25:23,074 --> 01:25:24,742
Only three ships.

918
01:25:24,826 --> 01:25:27,037
How daring, Yi Sun-shin.

919
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:31,041
You shall soon regret
leaving your headquarters.

920
01:25:33,085 --> 01:25:36,672
Wae ships on the right!

921
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,098
It's an ambush!

922
01:25:52,062 --> 01:25:53,689
A brave move.

923
01:25:55,441 --> 01:25:58,694
But three ships aren't enough to lure us.

924
01:25:58,777 --> 01:26:01,947
How will Yi respond

925
01:26:02,489 --> 01:26:04,867
once they've burned down?

926
01:26:05,784 --> 01:26:07,203
I wonder.

927
01:26:25,137 --> 01:26:26,138
It's too late.

928
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:27,848
Prepare for close combat.

929
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:44,823
Dono, enemy ships on the left!

930
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:03,300
Sir! They're Joseon ships.

931
01:27:11,433 --> 01:27:13,185
COMMANDER LEE UN-RYONG

932
01:27:19,024 --> 01:27:21,277
Row at full speed! We must retreat!

933
01:27:26,073 --> 01:27:29,243
Row faster! We must retreat!

934
01:27:29,785 --> 01:27:31,996
Chase after them at full speed.

935
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:33,455
Close in!

936
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:35,666
- Now!
- Yes, sir!

937
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,546
Sahei!

938
01:27:41,088 --> 01:27:44,383
Signal Manabe at once to stop his chase.

939
01:27:44,466 --> 01:27:46,927
He must not leave Gyeonnaeryang Strait.

940
01:27:47,011 --> 01:27:48,053
Yes, sir!

941
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,271
Sir, over there!

942
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:00,232
Orders to stop!

943
01:28:01,525 --> 01:28:02,985
What do we do, sir?

944
01:28:03,068 --> 01:28:04,403
Our sword is drawn.

945
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:07,198
We'll catch them here in Gyeonnaeryang.

946
01:28:07,281 --> 01:28:09,325
It's what the general wants. After them!

947
01:28:25,299 --> 01:28:28,552
Their main fleet isn't joining the attack.

948
01:28:39,396 --> 01:28:40,731
Rotate starboard!

949
01:28:41,148 --> 01:28:42,900
Rotate starboard!

950
01:28:50,115 --> 01:28:52,535
Throw the grapnel! Board the ship!

951
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,471
Our ships are hitting the rocks.

952
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,724
No matter,
we'll board enemy ships instead.

953
01:29:15,225 --> 01:29:16,685
Close in!

954
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:24,609
To port! Rotate to port!

955
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:58,727
My word. How is this possible?

956
01:30:00,187 --> 01:30:01,438
Fire!

957
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,064
Fire!

958
01:30:17,454 --> 01:30:18,872
Manabe.

959
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:20,707
Dono.

960
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:36,056
Admiral! We received report
from Gyeonnaeryang.

961
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:38,391
Commander Lee's ships entered the strait,

962
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:42,103
but the enemy's main fleet
has yet to be lured.

963
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,693
All ships
to the mouth of Gyeonnaeryang Strait

964
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:50,570
in arrowhead formation.

965
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:51,780
Raise the command flag.

966
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:52,864
Admiral.

967
01:30:52,948 --> 01:30:55,492
If the enemy attacks head-on,
we could be in danger.

968
01:30:56,493 --> 01:30:58,119
The current is against us.

969
01:30:58,203 --> 01:30:59,538
We need them to attack.

970
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:01,289
Raise the flag.

971
01:31:02,666 --> 01:31:03,792
Yes, sir.

972
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,461
Raise the flag!

973
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,279
Dono.

974
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,781
The enemy's main fleet has arrived!

975
01:31:41,997 --> 01:31:43,957
All ships, stop!

976
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:46,543
All ships, stop!

977
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:26,082
By now,
Kobayakawa will have passed Ungchi.

978
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:47,229
Fire the cannons!

979
01:33:02,995 --> 01:33:04,330
We need more arrows!

980
01:33:04,413 --> 01:33:06,582
Our hillside flank has fallen.

981
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:09,043
We're far outnumbered!

982
01:33:12,463 --> 01:33:15,091
Fall back to line two!

983
01:33:16,425 --> 01:33:18,135
Charge!

984
01:33:24,892 --> 01:33:27,979
Line two cannot hold.

985
01:33:28,312 --> 01:33:31,190
We must retreat to line three.

986
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:36,821
That'll be the end for us
and the navy headquarters.

987
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:39,866
No! For all of Jeolla-do!

988
01:33:40,741 --> 01:33:42,743
Charge!

989
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:53,296
Enemy ships! The enemy is advancing!

990
01:34:24,202 --> 01:34:27,955
Rotate all ships. Reinforce rowers.

991
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:33,252
All rowers to oars!

992
01:34:33,878 --> 01:34:35,880
Add rowers!

993
01:34:42,428 --> 01:34:45,139
Rotate the ship!

994
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:48,434
Get ready to fire!

995
01:34:50,144 --> 01:34:52,522
Sir! It's the command kite.

996
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,319
We must join the formation!

997
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,404
Row harder!

998
01:35:02,073 --> 01:35:03,407
CRANE WING

999
01:35:05,993 --> 01:35:08,579
Add rowers. Full speed ahead!

1000
01:35:08,663 --> 01:35:10,957
- Speed ensures victory!
- Yes, sir!

1001
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,917
Add more oars!

1002
01:35:15,545 --> 01:35:17,755
Row faster!

1003
01:35:17,839 --> 01:35:19,632
Faster!

1004
01:35:23,386 --> 01:35:25,721
Row with all your might!

1005
01:35:25,805 --> 01:35:27,598
Faster!

1006
01:35:28,099 --> 01:35:29,851
We must sail faster!

1007
01:35:35,523 --> 01:35:38,943
I will avenge Manabe
by destroying you myself.

1008
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:42,697
Wae ships are closing in!

1009
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,365
Fire!

1010
01:35:49,412 --> 01:35:50,746
Shoot the arrows!

1011
01:35:59,839 --> 01:36:02,300
Admiral. They're grappling our ship!

1012
01:36:06,888 --> 01:36:08,264
Cut the ropes!

1013
01:36:10,433 --> 01:36:12,518
We must return to formation.

1014
01:36:26,574 --> 01:36:29,368
Sir! Commanders Eo Young-dam
and Lee Un-ryong are under attack.

1015
01:36:38,837 --> 01:36:39,713
Sir!

1016
01:36:39,796 --> 01:36:42,090
Cover for him!

1017
01:36:43,383 --> 01:36:45,719
- Commander Eo.
- Follow me!

1018
01:36:59,983 --> 01:37:04,071
Crane wing formation. As expected.

1019
01:37:05,614 --> 01:37:08,033
Sahei can battle those ships

1020
01:37:08,116 --> 01:37:10,202
while we charge in fish-scale formation.

1021
01:37:10,285 --> 01:37:12,579
Fish-scale formation!

1022
01:37:12,663 --> 01:37:14,039
Fish-scale formation!

1023
01:37:38,689 --> 01:37:40,357
Watanabe reports from the front rank

1024
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:43,944
that he will charge at the ships
lagging behind at the right wing.

1025
01:37:44,027 --> 01:37:45,904
He thinks just like me.

1026
01:37:45,988 --> 01:37:48,240
Tell him I permit the attack.

1027
01:37:48,323 --> 01:37:49,449
Yes, sir!

1028
01:37:54,121 --> 01:37:55,205
Hurry!

1029
01:37:55,289 --> 01:37:58,584
Row backward and load the cannons!

1030
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:00,502
Fire!

1031
01:38:05,215 --> 01:38:07,259
What in the world is he thinking?

1032
01:38:07,342 --> 01:38:09,887
He's firing without order
despite the waves.

1033
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:11,597
He should know better!

1034
01:38:15,142 --> 01:38:16,393
The enemy ships are too fast.

1035
01:38:17,227 --> 01:38:19,646
We should've attacked sooner.

1036
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:21,315
You blasted Yi Sun-shin,

1037
01:38:21,398 --> 01:38:23,442
why aren't you firing?

1038
01:38:26,445 --> 01:38:29,865
Admiral Won's ships are weakening
our formation.

1039
01:38:29,948 --> 01:38:31,992
Please give order to fire.

1040
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:36,955
Please give order, sir!

1041
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:42,336
Before firing,
we must complete the formation.

1042
01:38:44,505 --> 01:38:46,340
In the Battle of Mikatagahara,

1043
01:38:46,423 --> 01:38:50,719
Takeda Shingen destroyed
Tokugawa's crane wing formation

1044
01:38:50,802 --> 01:38:54,515
not by swords or guns.

1045
01:38:55,182 --> 01:38:58,060
He crushed it with cavalry.

1046
01:38:59,394 --> 01:39:01,104
Charge forth, Watanabe.

1047
01:39:01,396 --> 01:39:04,316
You and I will crush the foe

1048
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,153
as we did at Gwanggyosan!

1049
01:39:14,868 --> 01:39:16,411
Charge forth.

1050
01:39:16,495 --> 01:39:18,872
You're not the only ones
with ramming ships.

1051
01:39:18,956 --> 01:39:23,126
Behold the might of our antaekseon
(WAE large warship).

1052
01:39:33,846 --> 01:39:38,058
Your crane will fall
before spreading its wings.

1053
01:39:43,981 --> 01:39:45,399
We've caught you now.

1054
01:40:51,257 --> 01:40:52,759
Mekurabune (blind ship).

1055
01:41:13,029 --> 01:41:14,989
It's the mekurabune!

1056
01:41:18,326 --> 01:41:19,410
Dono!

1057
01:41:24,958 --> 01:41:26,292
Bring the large gun!

1058
01:41:26,376 --> 01:41:27,502
Now!

1059
01:42:02,912 --> 01:42:04,706
It's the mekurabune!

1060
01:42:42,702 --> 01:42:45,205
Row harder!

1061
01:42:46,581 --> 01:42:48,249
Prepare to fire!

1062
01:42:49,959 --> 01:42:51,503
Row harder!

1063
01:43:02,764 --> 01:43:05,475
That flagship is shielded by iron plates.

1064
01:43:06,017 --> 01:43:08,353
Rotate to port and ram its stern.

1065
01:43:16,486 --> 01:43:17,529
It's slow.

1066
01:43:18,655 --> 01:43:21,282
Nothing but a blind mekurabune.

1067
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:24,285
Charge toward Yi's flagship!
Signal the fleet!

1068
01:43:24,369 --> 01:43:25,411
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

1069
01:43:25,495 --> 01:43:27,247
We'll go to the stern chaser.

1070
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:28,915
I'll fire it myself.

1071
01:43:34,838 --> 01:43:36,130
The sides were its weakness.

1072
01:43:36,214 --> 01:43:37,882
It will rotate for sure.

1073
01:43:37,966 --> 01:43:39,843
I'll aim for the side.

1074
01:43:43,429 --> 01:43:45,348
Take fire, mekurabune.

1075
01:43:48,643 --> 01:43:49,936
Fire!

1076
01:43:55,817 --> 01:43:57,986
Right cannon, fire!

1077
01:44:01,573 --> 01:44:03,116
Aim!

1078
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:04,617
Fire!

1079
01:44:25,723 --> 01:44:26,682
Dono,

1080
01:44:26,765 --> 01:44:30,102
the mekurabune is closing in sideways
out of our firing range.

1081
01:44:32,938 --> 01:44:33,981
Aim!

1082
01:44:49,705 --> 01:44:50,873
Sahei.

1083
01:44:58,297 --> 01:45:00,007
My trusty cousin.

1084
01:45:00,466 --> 01:45:01,717
Fire!

1085
01:45:07,556 --> 01:45:09,683
Wait and see, Yi Sun-shin.

1086
01:45:09,767 --> 01:45:13,395
Your mekurabune shall be your fall.

1087
01:45:34,708 --> 01:45:36,085
That one has a lower hull,

1088
01:45:36,168 --> 01:45:38,295
harder to target.

1089
01:45:38,379 --> 01:45:40,130
The mekurabune is charging at us!

1090
01:45:40,422 --> 01:45:41,924
Good.

1091
01:45:42,007 --> 01:45:45,678
Charge at us with all your might,
mekurabune.

1092
01:45:45,761 --> 01:45:49,640
Once you do,
your head will be lodged in my ship.

1093
01:45:52,726 --> 01:45:54,854
Prepare to board!

1094
01:46:47,323 --> 01:46:48,782
Bokkaisen (sea monster).

1095
01:46:53,704 --> 01:46:55,289
Dono!

1096
01:47:18,229 --> 01:47:19,271
Admiral.

1097
01:47:19,355 --> 01:47:23,484
The new turtle ship will achieve
more than ramming.

1098
01:47:24,276 --> 01:47:25,402
Please.

1099
01:47:26,695 --> 01:47:28,572
Deploy the turtle ship.

1100
01:47:35,746 --> 01:47:37,164
Yi Sun-shin.

1101
01:47:37,248 --> 01:47:40,417
Was this your final ploy?

1102
01:47:45,506 --> 01:47:47,967
Admiral. Thanks to the new turtle ship,

1103
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:51,429
Commanders Eo Hyang-do and Lee Un-ryong
have returned to formation.

1104
01:48:01,898 --> 01:48:02,774
Admiral.

1105
01:48:02,858 --> 01:48:04,484
The enemy ships are near.

1106
01:48:04,568 --> 01:48:06,111
We must open fire.

1107
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:11,533
Admiral!

1108
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:28,341
Why is the turtle ship still
in their midst?

1109
01:48:30,552 --> 01:48:33,138
The mekurabune is charging at us!

1110
01:48:49,279 --> 01:48:52,908
Two hundred yards away.
We can overtake them.

1111
01:48:54,826 --> 01:48:56,912
All ships!

1112
01:48:56,995 --> 01:49:00,457
Break formation!

1113
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:03,210
Engage the enemy!

1114
01:49:20,936 --> 01:49:22,062
Aim!

1115
01:49:26,107 --> 01:49:28,318
What in the world is he thinking?

1116
01:49:28,401 --> 01:49:29,861
The enemy is right before us.

1117
01:49:29,945 --> 01:49:31,321
We can't wait any longer!

1118
01:49:31,404 --> 01:49:33,073
Fire immediately!

1119
01:49:33,156 --> 01:49:35,659
Sir, we're out of shells.

1120
01:49:42,123 --> 01:49:43,124
Admiral.

1121
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,336
We must win this battle.

1122
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:49,089
Please fire.

1123
01:49:55,262 --> 01:49:56,555
One hundred yards.

1124
01:50:15,448 --> 01:50:16,616
Fifty yards.

1125
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:25,375
Raise the ladders!

1126
01:50:27,586 --> 01:50:29,087
All ships.

1127
01:50:37,262 --> 01:50:39,806
Raise them!

1128
01:50:40,307 --> 01:50:41,641
Rotate.

1129
01:50:42,517 --> 01:50:44,811
Rotate!

1130
01:50:44,895 --> 01:50:47,522
Port oars, stop!

1131
01:50:53,236 --> 01:50:55,780
Starboard oars, row harder!

1132
01:51:06,374 --> 01:51:09,211
Starboard oars, row harder!

1133
01:51:09,294 --> 01:51:11,505
Too late, Yi Sun-shin.

1134
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,550
Row harder!

1135
01:51:33,861 --> 01:51:35,613
Board their ships!

1136
01:51:43,204 --> 01:51:44,622
Fire.

1137
01:52:14,485 --> 01:52:16,612
A barrier on the sea.

1138
01:55:34,436 --> 01:55:38,732
Admiral, you have to shoot now!

1139
01:56:00,712 --> 01:56:03,257
Admiral!

1140
01:56:32,035 --> 01:56:33,579
A trap!

1141
01:56:34,204 --> 01:56:35,581
Fire!

1142
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:33,931
Stop them!

1143
01:57:44,066 --> 01:57:45,734
We must not let them pass!

1144
01:57:45,817 --> 01:57:47,569
Fight to the death!

1145
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:54,243
What the hell are you?

1146
01:57:58,497 --> 01:58:03,418
I wanted to treat you to a hearty drink.

1147
01:58:04,419 --> 01:58:06,755
It's too bad I can't.

1148
01:58:07,548 --> 01:58:08,799
Move!

1149
01:58:11,593 --> 01:58:13,303
You invaders will not

1150
01:58:14,304 --> 01:58:16,849
go beyond this Ungchi Pass.

1151
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:29,486
We must guard this place...

1152
01:58:38,120 --> 01:58:40,873
RIGHTEOUS MILITIA COMMANDER, HWANG JIN
Charge!

1153
01:58:41,748 --> 01:58:43,458
What did I tell you?

1154
01:58:43,542 --> 01:58:45,544
It's a righteous battle.

1155
01:58:47,546 --> 01:58:49,173
Fought together

1156
01:58:50,048 --> 01:58:52,050
with a shared spirit.

1157
01:58:54,094 --> 01:58:55,470
Yours as well.

1158
01:58:56,722 --> 01:58:58,390
I'm thankful for it.

1159
01:59:13,406 --> 01:59:16,743
What is this war?

1160
01:59:18,328 --> 01:59:20,914
A battle of the righteous
against the unrighteous.

1161
01:59:21,998 --> 01:59:24,042
The enemy is fleeing!

1162
01:59:24,584 --> 01:59:26,628
Chase after them!

1163
01:59:32,008 --> 01:59:35,303
RIGHTEOUS

1164
02:00:32,569 --> 02:00:38,575
FOLLOW

1165
02:01:25,121 --> 02:01:28,541
Admiral. It is a total triumph.

1166
02:01:30,627 --> 02:01:31,628
No.

1167
02:01:38,801 --> 02:01:40,345
Let us press on.

1168
02:01:41,513 --> 02:01:42,931
What Joseon needs

1169
02:01:44,015 --> 02:01:46,100
is a decisive victory.

1170
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:54,734
DAY SIX, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
ANGOLPO, NEAR BUSAN

1171
02:02:03,785 --> 02:02:08,957
DAY SEVEN, THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
BUSANPO, FINAL BATTLEGROUND

1172
02:02:25,056 --> 02:02:27,058
WAE NAVAL COMMANDER IN CHIEF
AT BUSANPO, TODO TAKATORA

1173
02:03:00,801 --> 02:03:03,053
ON JULY 11, 1592,

1174
02:03:03,137 --> 02:03:06,682
ADMIRAL YI ENDED HIS THIRD NAVAL CAMPAIGN
WITH A CANNONADE ON THE ENEMY AT BUSANPO.

1175
02:03:06,765 --> 02:03:11,812
HASHIBA (TOYOTOMI) HIDEYOSHI QUIT
HIS PLANS TO DEFEAT JOSEON'S NAVY.

1176
02:03:11,896 --> 02:03:16,275
THIS SAFEGUARDED MING TO THE WEST
AND REVERSED THE TIDE OF WAR.

1177
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,738
What made you bring me here, sir?

1178
02:03:23,490 --> 02:03:27,494
A YEAR LATER, HANSANDO ISLAND

1179
02:03:28,704 --> 02:03:30,539
Look at Geojedo Island.

1180
02:03:31,582 --> 02:03:35,044
The island is facing
the mouth of enemy waters.

1181
02:03:37,671 --> 02:03:40,549
We must secure tighter control
over this sea.

1182
02:03:44,178 --> 02:03:45,679
I agree, sir.

1183
02:03:46,764 --> 02:03:48,974
Thanks to our previous victory
in these waters,

1184
02:03:49,183 --> 02:03:51,894
the enemy at Busanpo

1185
02:03:53,145 --> 02:03:56,148
has yet to reappear
around Hansando Island.

1186
02:03:57,733 --> 02:03:59,735
I admire the name.

1187
02:04:01,028 --> 02:04:02,321
Hansan.

1188
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:08,953
Indeed, it's a meaningful name.

1189
02:04:09,745 --> 02:04:11,330
It stands for "grand mountain,"

1190
02:04:12,623 --> 02:04:14,500
does it not?

1191
02:04:16,836 --> 02:04:18,212
It does.

1192
02:04:20,089 --> 02:04:22,383
This Gyeonnaeryang Strait facing Hansan

1193
02:04:23,217 --> 02:04:25,261
will be our front line.

1194
02:04:27,012 --> 02:04:30,391
May Hansan prove to be
a truly grand mountain

1195
02:04:32,309 --> 02:04:34,728
guarding our land.

1196
02:04:36,522 --> 02:04:38,023
Such is my hope.

1197
02:04:56,750 --> 02:04:58,586
The turtle ships have arrived!

1198
02:05:04,175 --> 02:05:09,180
HANSAN: RISING DRAGON
