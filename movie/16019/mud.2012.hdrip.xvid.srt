00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,728
I just want to have
a conversation.

A junior.

You talk to her?

No.

is from Arkansas,

and we know some
of the same people

128
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,057
and we grew up in
some of the same places,

129
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,792
I reckon we can make
a deal for somethin'.

130
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,860
A deal for what?

131
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,897
Food.

132

Why don't you go
get your own food?

135
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,338
Well, I would if I could.

136
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,943
See, I told somebody
I'd meet 'em here. So...

137
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,446
Well, I'm stuck for now
and what I've got
is runnin' low.

138
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,147
He's a bum, Ellis,
come on.

139
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,017
I ain't no bum.
I got money, boy.

140
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,753
You can call me a hobo,
'cause a hobo will work
for his living,

141

homeless 'cause...

but you call me a bum again,

I'm gonna teach you
somethin' about respect
your daddy never did.

144
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,966
When they show up,
you'll leave?

145
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,103
Yup.

146
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,205
And when you leave,
that boat's ours?

147

No.

00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,269
I'll go tomorrow.

492
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,407
You want me to come
and get you?

493
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,741
No, I can manage.

494
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,212
Hell, I made it out here,
didn't I?

495
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,789
It's a hell of a thing,
ain't it?

496
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,260
It's a hell of a thing.

497
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,564
Time to get up.

498
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,233
It's too early.

499
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,602
I'm going to Wal-Mart
and I need you
to come with me.

500
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,803
Mom.

501
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,271
Come on.

502
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,983
Ellis, I know what
your father told you
last night.

503
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,287
That's...
That's not what I wanted.

504
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,022
I wanted to sit you down
and talk about it.

505
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,524
What do you
want to talk about?

506
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,394
You want to leave
and that means they
can tear up our house.

507
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,896
Well, I spent
my whole life
on that boat.

508
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,865
I don't think
it's too much to ask...

509
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,401
Oh, no.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

511
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,738
Oh, I hope
no one's hurt.

512
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,645
I'm just sayin' there
are two sides to this.

513
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,813
You know, I haven't
made up my mind yet,

514
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:07,384
because I wanted you to be
involved with my decision.

515
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,686
But I need a change, Ellis.

516
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,722
I deserve one.

517
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,494
I think
they're searching people.

518
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,436
TROOPER: How you
doin' today, ma'am?

519
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:26,436
MARY LEE: I'm all right,
how are you?

520
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:30,373
I'm doin' just fine.
Have you seen or picked up
any hitchhikers today?

521
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,841
No, sir.

522
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,476
Okay, could you open
the back for me, please?

523
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,078
It's open.
Okay.

524
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,915
Ma'am, have you
seen this man?

525
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,618
No, sir.

526
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,454
Son, have you?

527
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,924
No.

528
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,593
Okay, well,
there's been reports
that he's in the area.

529
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,629
So if you see him,
just call 9-1-1
for us, okay?

530
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,963
Okay.
What'd he do?

531
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,935
What'd he do?

532
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,637
Move along, please.

533

534
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,013
I knew it!

535
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,349
I told you that
crazy son of a bitch
was trouble.

536
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,683
Did you tell him
where he is?

537
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,085
No, that's why
I called you.

538
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,986
He needs to know
people are looking for him.

539
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,722
You think he doesn't
know that already?

540
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,791
Jesus, Ellis.
Why do you even think
he's on that island?

541
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,728
Ellis, I'm serious.

542
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,730
We don't know
who this guy is.

543
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,698
He loves her, Neck.
He told me.

544
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,367
I don't give a shit
who he loves.

545
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,837
He's not dangerous.

where the hell

Shit.

553
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:23,853
Sorry, boys, but I'm going
to have to go back on
our deal for the boat.

554
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,122
I don't feel good
about it, but I don't
see any other way

555
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,658
out of what I'm into.

556
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,160
So you know about
the state troopers?

557
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,897
What state troopers?

558
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,765
The ones spreadin'
your picture
all over the place.

559
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,035
Stoppin' cars on the 165,
searching for your ass.

560
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,037
No, I don't know
about that.

561
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,574
But it don't surprise me,
I got a lot of folks
lookin' for me.

562
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,142
Why?

563
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,644
I shot a man.

564
00:40:47,646 --> 00:40:47,644
Killed him.

565
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,016
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you boys sooner,

566
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,752
but I was hopin'
to be long gone before
anything came of it.

567
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,754
Didn't want y'all involved.

568
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,028
Look, y'all been
real good to me.

569
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,998
You're the only friends
I got out here.

570
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,035
If troopers got 165 blocked,
that means they got
other roads blocked, too.

571
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:14,003
So I ain't goin' to
get nowhere in a car.

572
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,909
I'm want to try
getting this boat down.

573
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,644
See if we can get it
in the water.

574
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,716
See, with a boat like this,
I can make it to the Gulf
in two days.

575
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,918
Heck, from there,
I can get anywhere.

576
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,789
But I need a boat at least
this big to make it
on the open water.

577
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,958
It's got no title,
no owner,

578
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,793
nobody lookin' for it.

579
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,027
It's my best shot.

580
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,263
Who'd you kill?

581
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:43,032
Just a bad
piece of business.

582
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,601
Y'all don't need
to hear about it.

583
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,035
I need to hear about it.

584
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,086
Juniper, she...

585
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:04,954
She made a mistake.

586
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,729
Hooked up with this guy.
He was no good.
His name was...

587
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:17,033
Hutchins.
His family owns a chain of
restaurants down in Texas.

588
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,268
Where were you?

589
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,773
I was around, but

590
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,078
me and Juniper
was on the outs.

591
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,083
She met him, he sold her
on a pack of lies,
he got her pregnant.

592
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,654
That's when
he started showin'
who he really was.

593
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,826
He dropped her down
a flight of stairs after
whoopin' her half to death.

594
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,162
She lost the baby,
he made it so...

595
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,998
Doctors say she
can't even have
children no more.

596
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,969
There are things
you can get away with
in this world

597
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,638
and there are things
you can't.

598
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,908
I tracked him down,

599
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,214
found him in a little motel
outside of San Antonio,
he was there

600
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,185
with another woman.
That's...

601
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,187
That's where it happened.

602
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,927
So I understand
if you boys don't
want to help me no more.

603
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,163
But I need this boat.

604
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:22,932
And I need to get it
into the water, fast.

605
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,171
I made a list of things
we're going to need.
What you think?

606
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,740
You did it for her?

607
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:31,874
To protect her?

608
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,110
Yeah.

609
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,048
What you think?

610
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,084
I think you want us
to run around,
stickin' our necks out,

611
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,719
getting everything
you need

612
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,320
just so you can
take our boat.

613
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,655
That's about it.

614
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,890
What do we
get out of it?

615
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,025
What you want?

616
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,795
What about
that pistol?

617
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,901
Only two things
I got out here
worth anything.

618
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,036
This shirt.

619
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,905
And this pistol.

620
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,174
And I can't give you
this shirt,

621
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,943
'cause I need it
for protection.

622
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:10,279
But if you help me get
this boat in the water,
the pistol,

623
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,882
it's yours.

624
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,083
What kind is it?

625
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,084
A .45.

626
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,821
Got to get this boat
floatin' first.

627
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,092
All right.

628

00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,032
All right, y'all scrounge
what you can off this list,

630
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,367
but if we're
gonna do this right,

631
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,037
we're gonna need more help.
Can you fetch Tom for me?

632
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,806
Tom Blankenship?

633
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:40,076
Yeah, I was hopin' to
let that old assassin
sit this one out.

634
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,011
We're gonna need him
to get things that
y'all can't.

635
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,946
Can you find him?

636
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,049
I know where he lives,
but I've never talked
to him.

637
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,251
Just tell him my name,
he'll know.

639
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:01,364
Thanks.

640

Don't lose my pistol.

Nah, I'll watch the boat.

Why are you
huntin' me?

644
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,387
Are you deaf, boy?
I said why are you
huntin' me?

Yes, sir.

What you got to say
to me that he can't
tell me himself?

about him?

ashamed of you, Mud.

from me, 'cause
there's none to be given.

with the meanest snake
she could find,

she'd go runnin' back to Mud.

911

laid a hand on her

to touch her again.

good enough, he had to go
shoot that feller.

put him up to it.

are set for failure.

Then why'd you
even come here?

1286

I came here
to leave with him.

I did.
