1
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,572
I'm comin' out now.

2
00:01:33,188 --> 00:01:35,421
I'm tired,
I want something different.

3
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:37,723
I just want to have
a conversation.

4
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:41,258
I just want to
talk about it.

5
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:55,838
Shit.

6
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,168
What the shit, man?

7
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:32,369
Suck it! Drive.

8
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:36,773
How old is she?

9
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,509
A junior.

10
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:41,377
She's got nice titties.
You talk to her?

11
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,645
No.

12
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,312
You're gonna
have to talk to her.

13
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:49,217
Remind me when we
get back to my house.

14
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,219
I think Galen's
got a book on that.

15
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:27,550
Shit.

16
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:33,222
Your dad would kill us if he
knew we went out there.

17
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,956
I'm not worried
about my dad killin' us.

18
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:42,463
We need to move if we're
gonna make it back.

19
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,199
Set your watch,
we need a good 15 minutes.

20
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:18,961
There it is!

21
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:02,697
Galen says it's been
here awhile.

22
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,300
He thinks the last flood did it.

23
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,370
Oh, hold it.

24
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,507
Look.

25
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:19,912
Little shits.

26
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:32,590
There it is.

27
00:05:32,593 --> 00:05:34,025
Yeah. There it is.

28
00:06:02,051 --> 00:06:04,016
Came down from up there.

29
00:06:25,004 --> 00:06:26,503
Motor's gone.

30
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,771
Who else knows
about this?

31
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:29,839
Just me and Galen.

32
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:31,441
What's he think?

33
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:32,842
He don't care about it.

34
00:06:32,845 --> 00:06:33,976
Good.

35
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:37,979
Because this boat's ours.

36
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:50,957
This is perfect.

37
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:58,597
Holy shit.

38
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:04,036
Dude.

39
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:08,739
Oh!

40
00:07:08,742 --> 00:07:10,640
Son of a bitch!

41
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:15,912
Whoa.

42
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:18,481
Those are awesome.

43
00:07:23,987 --> 00:07:25,787
Man.

44
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,890
Dude, look at that beave,
you gotta see this.

45
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:30,024
- Neck.
- What?

46
00:07:33,896 --> 00:07:34,995
Someone's here.

47
00:07:34,998 --> 00:07:35,963
What?

48
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:37,097
Someone's living here.

49
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,770
Shit.

50
00:07:44,773 --> 00:07:46,037
We gotta go.
Can't be late.

51
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:16,964
What are you doing?
I saw that same

52
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:19,000
boot print up in the tree.

53
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:24,970
It's got a cross
in the heel.

54
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,043
Somebody's been
in our boat.

55
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:33,112
Shit. Let's go!

56
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,448
We gotta go if you
wanna make it back.

57
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,884
Takes twice as long
goin' upriver.

58
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:42,019
Hold on.

59
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:44,521
Up there, they stop.

60
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:50,693
Where the hell'd he go?

61
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:51,828
I don't know.

62
00:09:09,878 --> 00:09:12,044
Shit, you know that guy?

63
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,712
I've never
seen him before.

64
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:18,083
Shit.

65
00:09:24,524 --> 00:09:25,890
What'd you say, boy?

66
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:32,929
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

67
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,532
What's that?

68
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:37,933
Boat in a tree.

69
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,269
Hell of a thing.

70
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:43,538
You talkin'
about our boat?

71
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,973
Talkin' about my boat.

72
00:09:44,976 --> 00:09:46,608
We found it.

73
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:47,976
Yeah, you found it
with me livin' in it.

74
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:51,011
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

75
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,883
You got crosses
in your heels.

76
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,984
Nails.

77
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,752
Shaped like crosses.

78
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:01,052
What for?

79
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:02,854
Ward off evil spirits.

80
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,659
Bought 'em from a man
I called an Indian,

81
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,094
but he was a Mexican,

82
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,230
said they were
seven-league boots

83
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:15,298
worn by the seventh son
of the seventh son.

84
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:20,036
Told me they'd turn me
into a werewolf, that's a lie.

85
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:21,638
I don't know
nothin' about that.

86
00:10:22,674 --> 00:10:24,274
They just good luck boots.

87
00:10:26,077 --> 00:10:28,176
As you can see, they ain't
working too well so far.

88
00:10:29,112 --> 00:10:30,978
What's your name?

89
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:32,880
I'm Neckbone,
he's Ellis.

90
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,982
And, mister, I know you're
not the owner of that boat,

91
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:36,817
not for nine-tenths of nothin'.

92
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:38,852
Neckbone...

93
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,820
That's a heck of
a good handle, son.

94
00:10:40,823 --> 00:10:42,022
Where y'all from?

95
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:43,690
What do you care
where we're from?

96
00:10:43,693 --> 00:10:45,190
DeWitt.

97
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,625
Arkansas boys.

98
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:50,763
Y'all had me worried
for a second.

99
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:51,963
We supposed
to know you?

100
00:10:51,966 --> 00:10:56,000
I grew up around here,
but I've been gone awhile.

101
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,268
Where at around here?

102
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:59,337
Different places.

103
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,738
Spent a lot of time
back up near the White.

104
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,939
You know Shelly's Oxbow?

105
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,307
Ellis.

106
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,641
Yeah, I know it.

107
00:11:07,812 --> 00:11:10,179
An old man named Tom Blankenship
used to live up in there.

108
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,682
He still does.

109
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:13,950
His boat's across from mine.

110
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,687
Well, ain't that somethin'?

111
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,988
Hmm...

112
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:25,626
Now, I like you two boys.
You remind me of... me.

113
00:11:28,163 --> 00:11:30,129
Seein' as how you two
is from Arkansas,

114
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:31,763
and we know some
of the same people

115
00:11:31,766 --> 00:11:32,965
and we grew up in
some of the same places,

116
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,700
I reckon we can make
a deal for somethin'.

117
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:36,768
A deal for what?

118
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:39,805
Food.

119
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:41,973
Food for a boat.

120
00:11:41,976 --> 00:11:43,374
He's a bum, Ellis.
Come on.

121
00:11:44,677 --> 00:11:45,943
Why don't you go
get your own food?

122
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,244
Well, I would if I could.

123
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:52,849
See, I told somebody
I'd meet 'em here. So...

124
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:55,351
Well, I'm stuck for now and
what I've got is runnin' low.

125
00:11:55,354 --> 00:11:57,052
He's a bum, Ellis, come on.

126
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,922
I ain't no bum.
I got money, boy.

127
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:02,657
You can call me a hobo,
'cause a hobo will work for his living,

128
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,325
and you can call me
homeless 'cause...

129
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:06,259
Well, that's true for now,
but you call me a bum again,

130
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:09,062
I'm gonna teach you somethin'
about respect your daddy never did.

131
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:15,869
When they show up, you'll leave?

132
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:19,004
Yup.

133
00:12:19,007 --> 00:12:21,106
And when you leave,
that boat's ours?

134
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:22,240
That's right.

135
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,112
I'm just in a tight spot.

136
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:29,781
Could use a little help.

137
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,120
We gotta go.

138
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:55,336
You get his name?

139
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:56,870
No.

140
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:17,755
Sorry.

141
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:20,857
Where ya been?

142
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,726
Me and Neck got caught up
helpin' Galen.

143
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:26,062
You're supposed to be helpin' me.
I had to load this myself.

144
00:13:26,964 --> 00:13:28,364
I know. I'm sorry.

145
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:33,035
Get on in the back,
can't be later than we are.

146
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,033
Supposed to be 10.

147
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:51,769
It's 10, you do your share.

148
00:14:51,772 --> 00:14:53,403
I loaded this morning,
makes it five.

149
00:14:56,141 --> 00:14:57,874
Can you drop me at Neck's?

150
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,876
Hadn't you seen
enough of him today?

151
00:14:59,878 --> 00:15:02,144
Said he had somethin' for me.

152
00:15:02,147 --> 00:15:03,979
You see any more of them
Ding Dongs over there?

153
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:11,085
What did Mama want
to talk to you about?

154
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:14,220
What?

155
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,789
This morning?

156
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:18,024
What did she want
to talk to you about?

157
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:21,928
You spy on me
in my own house?

158
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:25,098
I wasn't spyin',
I just heard y'all.

159
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,267
That's your
mother's business.

160
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,348
I came for that book.

161
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:49,385
Oh, yeah.
Gotta give it a minute.

162
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,152
Hear that music?

163
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:52,887
Yeah?

164
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,223
That means he's doin' it.
That's his doin' it song.

165
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:57,925
You know who it is?

166
00:15:57,928 --> 00:15:59,026
Whoever's drivin'
that Pontiac.

167
00:16:02,897 --> 00:16:04,964
You tell Galen
about this morning?

168
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,465
Nah. You tell anybody?

169
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:09,902
That guy's crazy.

170
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,538
I don't know. I think he just
needed a little help.

171
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,573
He can swim his ass off
that island and get some.

172
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,042
I think I'm gonna
go back out there,

173
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:19,510
give him some food.

174
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:21,145
Why?

175
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,851
You're Neckbone, right?

176
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:27,951
Yeah.

177
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,251
Word of advice.

178
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,086
Don't grow up to be like
your shit heel uncle.

179
00:16:33,057 --> 00:16:34,056
Hey.

180
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,457
You hear me?

181
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,192
You treat a woman like
a princess, got it?

182
00:16:38,295 --> 00:16:39,528
Yeah.

183
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,563
Come on, baby!

184
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:44,297
I'm a goddamn princess!

185
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,366
That's uncalled for.

186
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:49,903
Hey, a lot of people are comfortable
with that kind of thing in the bedroom.

187
00:16:49,906 --> 00:16:52,906
Some people aren't. We know
that about you now, okay?

188
00:16:52,908 --> 00:16:54,974
What do you think I am?

189
00:16:54,977 --> 00:16:56,275
Pearls.

190
00:16:56,278 --> 00:16:58,878
Galen finds 'em
in the mussel shells.

191
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:00,879
Come on,
let's get that book.

192
00:17:00,882 --> 00:17:02,881
You weren't havin' any fun?
No!

193
00:17:02,884 --> 00:17:04,115
No fun at all?
No!

194
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,218
Please don't go.

195
00:17:08,221 --> 00:17:10,220
I don't want you goin' back
out there by yourself.

196
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,958
That river's scary enough
with two people.

197
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:16,559
I don't trust that guy.

198
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,395
Here it is.

199
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:23,164
Galen said that really turned
things around for him.

200
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,299
Thanks.

201
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,603
Watch out for that dog.

202
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:35,074
You really goin'
back out there?

203
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,511
Yeah. I think it's
the right thing to do.

204
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:39,979
All right.

205
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:41,648
I'll be over in the mornin' then.

206
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,048
Hey, that's a good book.

207
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:44,383
Be sure you do the
worksheets in back.

208
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,284
Let's get
some dinner, Neck.

209
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,652
Hey, I'll call
before I come.

210
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:49,020
All right.

211
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:19,212
You okay, Mama?

212
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:22,148
Yes.

213
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:26,085
Are you hungry?

214
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:27,687
You want me
to fix you something?

215
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,222
I'm all right.

216
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,958
Well, then, I'm going to turn in.

217
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,430
Hey, Dad.

218
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:20,698
What do you know
about Tom Blankenship?

219
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,533
What?

220
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:25,002
Mr. Blankenship, what do
you know about him?

221
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:26,770
Why?

222
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:30,640
I don't know. He just looks lonely
over there all by himself.

223
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:32,509
Some people move to
this river to work on it,

224
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:35,078
and some people move
here to be left alone.

225
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:46,755
I want us to try and sit down for
dinner tonight, okay?

226
00:19:49,258 --> 00:19:50,758
Ellis?

227
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:52,358
Be home by 7:00.

228
00:19:53,595 --> 00:19:54,727
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,545
Where do you
think he's at?

230
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,080
Let's try the boat.

231
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:36,798
Looks like he made camp.

232
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:39,799
You think he's up there?

233
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:49,075
What are you doin'?

234
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:53,811
I try to never sleep
in the same spot twice.

235
00:20:53,814 --> 00:20:56,080
What you got there?
Brought you some food.

236
00:20:59,518 --> 00:21:01,118
Here, take it.

237
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:08,524
I owe you boys.

238
00:21:08,527 --> 00:21:10,759
I was gonna try and run
a trotline this afternoon.

239
00:21:10,762 --> 00:21:12,394
See where that got me.

240
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:18,566
Mmm.

241
00:21:20,136 --> 00:21:21,502
Green beans
never tasted so good.

242
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:26,539
Why you have that pistol?

243
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:33,679
Protection.

244
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:43,653
Y'all needn't be afraid of me.

245
00:21:43,656 --> 00:21:46,223
I've got two ways to protect
myself out here, this shirt

246
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,326
and this pistol.

247
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:51,761
There are fierce powers
at work in the world, boys.

248
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:53,696
Good, evil,

249
00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:56,364
poor luck, best luck.

250
00:21:58,802 --> 00:22:00,401
As men,

251
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,537
we've got to take
advantage where we can.

252
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,806
Y'all comin'?

253
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:16,182
So who's this guy
you're waiting on?

254
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:18,851
Oh, I'm not waitin' on no guy.

255
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:20,385
I'm waitin' on my girlfriend.

256
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:23,421
Juniper.
Is she hot?

257
00:22:24,391 --> 00:22:25,557
She's beautiful.

258
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,825
Bullshit!

259
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:29,226
Prettiest girl I've ever seen,
hands down.

260
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:32,896
Blonde hair, long legs.

261
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:35,598
I tell you, she's like a dream you
don't want to wake up from.

262
00:22:39,871 --> 00:22:42,672
She's got these birds
tattooed on her hands here.

263
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,640
Nightingales.

264
00:22:47,177 --> 00:22:49,477
Good luck birds.

265
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,445
That a good luck snake?

266
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:52,780
No, it is not.

267
00:22:52,783 --> 00:22:54,749
I hate snakes.

268
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:58,552
That's because God put 'em
here for us to fear.

269
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:00,619
We knew to be afraid of snakes

270
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,888
long before we ever even
got into this world.

271
00:23:04,358 --> 00:23:09,528
The Cherokee would wrap their pregnant
women's bellies in snake skin.

272
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,796
Induce labor,
scare the child out.

273
00:23:17,736 --> 00:23:19,703
Put that around
your bed at night.

274
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:21,871
Snake won't cross
a braided rope.

275
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:23,206
Thanks.

276
00:23:24,209 --> 00:23:25,841
So what's that
tattoo for then?

277
00:23:26,744 --> 00:23:28,211
A reminder.

278
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,579
Don't get bit.

279
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:36,917
I was 10, swimmin' about a mile
up from here, me and Juniper.

280
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,787
Son of a bitch

281
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:43,424
swam up on me, bit me right here
up under the armpit.

282
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:46,858
Juniper got me
off to the clinic.

283
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:50,896
Doctor said I should have
been dead in 20 minutes.

284
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,399
Took us over an hour
just to get to town.

285
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,867
So what'd they do for it?

286
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,502
Gave me the anti-venom.

287
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:58,970
Cottonmouth.

288
00:23:58,973 --> 00:24:00,304
See here?

289
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,872
Thing with anti-venom is,

290
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,709
they can only
give it to you once.

291
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:09,546
Made of horse blood. Body would
reject it a second time.

292
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:12,281
So the cure becomes more
dangerous than the poison.

293
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,816
What happens if you get bit again?

294
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:17,652
I die

295
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:18,853
or just sweat it out.

296
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:22,723
We gotta go help Neck's uncle.

297
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:23,857
All right.

298
00:24:25,327 --> 00:24:26,827
You never said your name.

299
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:28,895
Mud.

300
00:24:28,898 --> 00:24:31,465
You can call me Mud.

301
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:32,765
Here, Mud.

302
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,567
I think you need this
worse than I do.

303
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:37,435
I'll be all right.

304
00:24:56,856 --> 00:24:59,289
You start datin', I bet her dad'll
give you a free pickup.

305
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:02,324
I don't care about that.

306
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:08,829
What the hell
are you doing?

307
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:12,766
Where you goin'?

308
00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:15,702
Stop it!

309
00:25:15,705 --> 00:25:17,337
Stop it! God!

310
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,505
Hey.

311
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:23,909
Holy shit, Pryor,
get off your ass!

312
00:25:23,912 --> 00:25:25,844
You only got
what you deserve!

313
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,745
That's right, go home, Pryor!

314
00:25:34,854 --> 00:25:36,820
Do I know you?

315
00:25:36,822 --> 00:25:39,522
I'm Ellis, that's Neck.

316
00:25:39,525 --> 00:25:41,691
We went to junior high with you
before you went to high school.

317
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:43,959
How old are you?

318
00:25:43,962 --> 00:25:45,094
Fourteen.

319
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:47,963
You know you just
punched a senior.

320
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,032
So?

321
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,569
I'm May Pearl.

322
00:25:55,572 --> 00:25:57,104
I know.

323
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,639
What else do you know?

324
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:00,808
Nothing.

325
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,910
Son of a bitch.

326
00:26:03,913 --> 00:26:05,044
Ellis.

327
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:08,780
Ellis!

328
00:26:12,753 --> 00:26:13,785
Look.

329
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,726
You ever seen that girl before?

330
00:26:21,729 --> 00:26:22,892
No.

331
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:30,966
Did you see her hands?

332
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,936
Hey, girl!

333
00:26:33,939 --> 00:26:35,504
Hey!

334
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:37,005
Hey, girl,
where you goin'?

335
00:26:38,775 --> 00:26:41,042
That ain't even cool.

336
00:26:41,044 --> 00:26:42,576
Hello?

337
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:45,879
Oh, sorry.

338
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:47,981
We think we know a guy that
might know that girl over there.

339
00:26:47,984 --> 00:26:50,584
Oh.
May Pearl, let's go!

340
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:52,119
Okay.

341
00:26:52,121 --> 00:26:54,886
Okay, I guess I'll see you.

342
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,758
If you can find my number,
you should give me a call.

343
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:01,926
I can find it.

344
00:27:08,135 --> 00:27:11,801
Into the Piggly Wiggly.
She came from the motel.

345
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,717
Home for dinner?

346
00:28:11,687 --> 00:28:12,786
What you hidin' for?

347
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:15,022
I ain't hidin'.

348
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:17,891
Come over here.

349
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:31,636
You know I love you?

350
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:33,504
Yes, sir.

351
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,673
I know.

352
00:28:35,676 --> 00:28:38,175
I work you hard,
'cause life is work.

353
00:28:38,178 --> 00:28:39,510
You know that?

354
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:42,545
Yes, sir.

355
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,854
Your mom is talkin'
about movin' into town.

356
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,522
What's that mean?

357
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:54,823
She seems set on it,

358
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:56,925
wants to separate.

359
00:28:57,993 --> 00:28:59,860
May even ask for a divorce.

360
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,830
What's that mean for me?

361
00:29:05,634 --> 00:29:07,868
It means enjoy
this river, son.

362
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,136
Enjoy it while
you live on it.

363
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:12,271
'Cause this way of life
isn't long for this world.

364
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,572
River Authority's
about made certain of that.

365
00:29:16,843 --> 00:29:17,909
But you and me,

366
00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:21,946
we can still live
out here, right?

367
00:29:21,948 --> 00:29:24,882
R.A. can't take your boat.

368
00:29:24,885 --> 00:29:26,583
Not while you're
still livin' in it.

369
00:29:26,586 --> 00:29:28,852
This houseboat's
in your mother's name.

370
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:30,753
Her daddy gave it
to her, not to me.

371
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:33,890
She wants to leave it.

372
00:29:33,892 --> 00:29:36,858
River Authority's got
every right to come in here

373
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:40,128
and tear this place apart
board by board.

374
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:41,863
That ain't right.

375
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:44,832
You work outta here.

376
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,635
We got the ice machine.

377
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:49,235
The traps.

378
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:51,871
What are we
supposed to do?

379
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,607
Like I said, that's
your mother's business.

380
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:00,912
I ain't no townie.

381
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,213
I ain't livin' like that.

382
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:09,086
I've let you down, son.

383
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:13,558
Man is supposed to be in charge
of his own affairs,

384
00:30:16,193 --> 00:30:19,595
but I haven't
worked it like that.

385
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,063
But y'all are married.

386
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:23,165
Y'all are supposed
to love each other.

387
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:28,136
I don't know
about that anymore.

388
00:30:35,878 --> 00:30:37,010
Hey, Ellis.

389
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:51,622
You're late.

390
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,781
Ellis?

391
00:32:42,218 --> 00:32:43,818
Damn, boy,
what you doin' out here?

392
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,055
I got you
some Beanie Weenie.

393
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:50,792
I appreciate that.

394
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:54,928
But I didn't expect you
out here at night.

395
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:02,868
Boy, you really know
how to do somebody right.

396
00:33:02,871 --> 00:33:04,737
I wasn't gonna say nothin',

397
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,339
but it's pretty tough to make
a meal out of pumpkin pie fillin'.

398
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:10,240
That's all my mom had.

399
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:11,875
Oh, I ain't complainin'.

400
00:33:12,812 --> 00:33:14,411
Can I get one of those?

401
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:17,881
They're yours
to begin with.

402
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,965
That's good, right?

403
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,201
You been
out here too long.

404
00:33:47,441 --> 00:33:49,108
Mmm-hmm.

405
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,910
The girl
you're waitin' on,

406
00:33:51,913 --> 00:33:53,512
she's your girlfriend?

407
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:56,981
Juniper.

408
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:58,115
Yeah.

409
00:34:04,423 --> 00:34:05,922
How'd you meet her?

410
00:34:08,027 --> 00:34:09,826
We grew up together.

411
00:34:13,797 --> 00:34:14,963
You love her?

412
00:34:19,803 --> 00:34:20,935
I do.

413
00:34:24,173 --> 00:34:27,206
First time I saw her was on this river,
just up from here.

414
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:31,144
She saved my life.

415
00:34:31,147 --> 00:34:33,412
From the snake bite.
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,817
I was younger than
you are right now.

417
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:44,855
When I came to in the hospital
and she was there,

418
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:50,194
it was like the whole world
just split wide open and

419
00:34:50,196 --> 00:34:51,461
come back together new.

420
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:55,865
I knew from then on
I'd do anything for her.

421
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:01,169
Why aren't y'all
married then?

422
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,373
I've asked.
Several times.

423
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:10,311
Marriage

424
00:35:11,914 --> 00:35:13,879
just don't work
for some people.

425
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:24,557
My dad says

426
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,291
my parents might be
getting a divorce.

427
00:35:30,563 --> 00:35:32,896
I'm sorry to hear that.

428
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,235
They say if it happens, and my
mom moves us off the river,

429
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,137
the government can
come take our boat.

430
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,572
Who says that?

431
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,506
Everybody.

432
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,107
They passed a law.

433
00:35:57,553 --> 00:35:59,086
I saw Juniper today.

434
00:36:00,155 --> 00:36:01,621
What?

435
00:36:01,623 --> 00:36:03,322
She had the birds
tattooed on her hands.

436
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:05,624
Just like you said.

437
00:36:05,627 --> 00:36:07,159
You're right.

438
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:09,628
She's pretty.

439
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:13,565
Where'd you see her?

440
00:36:13,568 --> 00:36:15,633
At the Piggly Wiggly.

441
00:36:15,635 --> 00:36:18,435
I think she's staying
at a motel nearby there.

442
00:36:18,438 --> 00:36:20,270
That's good news.

443
00:36:21,373 --> 00:36:23,273
That's real good news.

444
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:25,408
She know
you're out here?

445
00:36:27,545 --> 00:36:29,445
No. No, we, uh...

446
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:34,616
We said we'd meet somewhere else,
a couple days from now.

447
00:36:37,587 --> 00:36:40,054
You wanna go tonight?
I can take you up river.

448
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:44,491
Tomorrow.

449
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:46,959
I'll go tomorrow.

450
00:36:49,564 --> 00:36:51,097
You want me to come
and get you?

451
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,431
No, I can manage.

452
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:55,901
Hell, I made it out here,
didn't I?

453
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,476
It's a hell of a thing,
ain't it?

454
00:37:09,481 --> 00:37:10,947
It's a hell of a thing.

455
00:37:13,585 --> 00:37:15,251
Time to get up.

456
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:16,920
It's too early.

457
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:19,287
I'm going to Wal-Mart and
I need you to come with me.

458
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,488
Mom.

459
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:21,956
Come on.

460
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,666
Ellis, I know what your father
told you last night.

461
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,970
That's...
That's not what I wanted.

462
00:37:37,973 --> 00:37:39,705
I wanted to sit you down
and talk about it.

463
00:37:39,708 --> 00:37:42,207
What do you
want to talk about?

464
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:45,076
You want to leave and that
means they can tear up our house.

465
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:47,578
Well, I spent my whole life
on that boat.

466
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:49,546
I don't think
it's too much to ask...

467
00:37:50,649 --> 00:37:52,082
Oh, no.

468
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:55,419
Oh, I hope
no one's hurt.

469
00:37:59,324 --> 00:38:02,325
I'm just sayin' there
are two sides to this.

470
00:38:02,328 --> 00:38:04,493
You know, I haven't
made up my mind yet,

471
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:08,063
because I wanted you to be
involved with my decision.

472
00:38:08,065 --> 00:38:10,364
But I need a change, Ellis.

473
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,400
I deserve one.

474
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:18,172
I think they're searching people.

475
00:38:25,746 --> 00:38:27,112
How you doin' today, ma'am?

476
00:38:27,115 --> 00:38:31,049
I'm doin' just fine. Have you seen
or picked up any hitchhikers today?

477
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:32,517
No, sir.

478
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:34,151
Okay, could you open
the back for me, please?

479
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:35,753
It's open.
Okay.

480
00:38:37,689 --> 00:38:39,589
Ma'am, have you
seen this man?

481
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,292
No, sir.

482
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,128
Son, have you?

483
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,597
No.

484
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,266
Okay, well, there's been reports
that he's in the area.

485
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:53,301
So if you see him,
just call 9-1-1 for us, okay?

486
00:38:53,304 --> 00:38:54,635
Okay.
What'd he do?

487
00:38:58,273 --> 00:38:59,606
What'd he do?

488
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:01,308
Move along, please.

489
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:07,213
Neck, Neck, pick up!

490
00:39:09,082 --> 00:39:10,682
I knew it!

491
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:13,018
I told you that crazy son
of a bitch was trouble.

492
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:14,352
Did you tell him
where he is?

493
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:15,754
No, that's why
I called you.

494
00:39:15,757 --> 00:39:17,655
He needs to know
people are looking for him.

495
00:39:17,658 --> 00:39:19,391
You think he doesn't
know that already?

496
00:39:19,394 --> 00:39:22,460
Jesus, Ellis. Why do you even think
he's on that island?

497
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,395
Ellis, I'm serious.

498
00:39:25,398 --> 00:39:27,397
We don't know
who this guy is.

499
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,365
He loves her, Neck.
He told me.

500
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:31,034
I don't give a shit
who he loves.

501
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,504
He's not dangerous.

502
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:43,277
It sounds like a shitload of state
troopers thinks different.

503
00:40:01,594 --> 00:40:04,295
No tellin' where the hell
he's been sleepin'.

504
00:40:04,298 --> 00:40:06,597
He might be
gone already.

505
00:40:18,643 --> 00:40:19,775
Shit.

506
00:40:19,778 --> 00:40:24,513
Sorry, boys, but I'm going to have
to go back on our deal for the boat.

507
00:40:24,515 --> 00:40:26,780
I don't feel good about it,
but I don't see any other way

508
00:40:26,783 --> 00:40:29,316
out of what I'm into.

509
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:30,818
So you know about
the state troopers?

510
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,555
What state troopers?

511
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,423
The ones spreadin' your picture
all over the place.

512
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:39,692
Stoppin' cars on the 165,
searching for your ass.

513
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:41,693
No, I don't know
about that.

514
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:45,230
But it don't surprise me,
I got a lot of folks lookin' for me.

515
00:40:45,233 --> 00:40:46,798
Why?

516
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:48,300
I shot a man.

517
00:40:51,704 --> 00:40:53,671
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you boys sooner,

518
00:40:53,674 --> 00:40:56,407
but I was hopin' to be long gone
before anything came of it.

519
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,408
Didn't want y'all involved.

520
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:05,681
Look, y'all been
real good to me.

521
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:09,651
You're the only friends
I got out here.

522
00:41:09,654 --> 00:41:12,687
If troopers got 165 blocked, that
means they got other roads blocked, too.

523
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,655
So I ain't goin' to
get nowhere in a car.

524
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,560
I'm want to try
getting this boat down.

525
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,295
See if we can get it
in the water.

526
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:27,367
See, with a boat like this,
I can make it to the Gulf in two days.

527
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:29,567
Heck, from there,
I can get anywhere.

528
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,438
But I need a boat at least
this big to make it on the open water.

529
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:35,607
It's got no title,
no owner,

530
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,442
nobody lookin' for it.

531
00:41:37,445 --> 00:41:38,676
It's my best shot.

532
00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:40,911
Who'd you kill?

533
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:43,679
Just a bad
piece of business.

534
00:41:43,682 --> 00:41:45,248
Y'all don't need
to hear about it.

535
00:41:45,251 --> 00:41:46,682
I need to hear about it.

536
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:03,731
Juniper, she...

537
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:13,373
Hooked up with this guy.
He was no good. His name was...

538
00:42:13,376 --> 00:42:17,676
Hutchins. His family owns a chain of
restaurants down in Texas.

539
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:18,910
Where were you?

540
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,415
I was around, but

541
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:29,720
me and Juniper
was on the outs.

542
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:34,723
She met him, he sold her on a pack of lies,
he got her pregnant.

543
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:38,294
That's when he started showin'
who he really was.

544
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:44,466
He dropped her down a flight of stairs
after whoopin' her half to death.

545
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:46,800
She lost the baby,
he made it so...

546
00:42:46,803 --> 00:42:49,636
Doctors say she can't even have
children no more.

547
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:53,607
There are things you can get
away with in this world

548
00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:56,275
and there are things
you can't.

549
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:59,545
I tracked him down,

550
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:05,850
found him in a little motel outside
of San Antonio, he was there

551
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:09,820
with another woman.
That's...

552
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,822
That's where it happened.

553
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:18,561
So I understand if you boys don't
want to help me no more.

554
00:43:18,564 --> 00:43:20,797
But I need this boat.

555
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,565
And I need to get it
into the water, fast.

556
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,804
I made a list of things we're going to need.
What you think?

557
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,373
You did it for her?

558
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,506
To protect her?

559
00:43:33,609 --> 00:43:34,741
Yeah.

560
00:43:37,879 --> 00:43:39,679
What you think?

561
00:43:39,682 --> 00:43:41,715
I think you want us to run around,
stickin' our necks out,

562
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:43,350
getting everything
you need

563
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:44,951
just so you can
take our boat.

564
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:46,285
That's about it.

565
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:48,519
What do we
get out of it?

566
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:49,654
What you want?

567
00:43:52,292 --> 00:43:53,424
What about
that pistol?

568
00:43:55,996 --> 00:43:59,530
Only two things
I got out here worth anything.

569
00:43:59,532 --> 00:44:00,664
This shirt.

570
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:03,533
And this pistol.

571
00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:05,801
And I can't give you
this shirt,

572
00:44:05,804 --> 00:44:07,570
'cause I need it
for protection.

573
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:10,906
But if you help me get
this boat in the water, the pistol,

574
00:44:10,908 --> 00:44:12,483
it's yours.

575
00:44:13,107 --> 00:44:15,135
What kind is it?
A 45.

576
00:44:17,347 --> 00:44:19,447
Got to get this boat
floatin' first.

577
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:23,716
All right.

578
00:44:27,523 --> 00:44:29,656
All right, y'all scrounge
what you can off this list,

579
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:31,991
but if we're
gonna do this right,

580
00:44:31,994 --> 00:44:34,661
we're gonna need more help.
Can you fetch Tom for me?

581
00:44:35,595 --> 00:44:37,428
Tom Blankenship?

582
00:44:37,431 --> 00:44:40,698
Yeah, I was hopin' to let that old
assassin sit this one out.

583
00:44:40,701 --> 00:44:42,633
We're gonna need him to
get things that y'all can't.

584
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:44,568
Can you find him?

585
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:46,671
I know where he lives,
but I've never talked to him.

586
00:44:46,673 --> 00:44:48,872
Just tell him my name,
he'll know.

587
00:44:58,748 --> 00:45:00,748
Hey, boys.

588
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:01,983
Thanks.

589
00:45:01,986 --> 00:45:03,818
Don't lose my pistol.

590
00:45:31,544 --> 00:45:33,110
You coming?

591
00:45:33,113 --> 00:45:34,912
Nah, I'll watch the boat.

592
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:25,020
Why are you
huntin' me?

593
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:31,993
Are you deaf, boy?
I said why are you huntin' me?

594
00:46:32,963 --> 00:46:34,095
I ain't huntin' you.

595
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,832
What's your
business here?

596
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:39,167
I come to find you.

597
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:40,767
I got a message for you.

598
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:43,436
You Senior's boy?

599
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,938
Yes, sir.

600
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:48,875
What you got to say to me
that he can't tell me himself?

601
00:46:48,878 --> 00:46:50,009
It ain't from him.

602
00:46:51,445 --> 00:46:52,744
Mud sent me.

603
00:46:55,715 --> 00:46:57,681
Mud?

604
00:46:57,684 --> 00:46:58,816
Yes, sir.

605
00:47:02,822 --> 00:47:04,622
What you know
about him?

606
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:06,689
He told me
to come find you.

607
00:47:06,692 --> 00:47:08,925
Your daddy
know about this?

608
00:47:08,928 --> 00:47:10,627
No, sir.

609
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,094
Mud needs your help.

610
00:47:18,034 --> 00:47:19,600
Where is he?

611
00:47:36,517 --> 00:47:37,783
There he is.

612
00:47:48,694 --> 00:47:49,660
You think
that's his daddy?

613
00:47:50,696 --> 00:47:51,829
I don't know.

614
00:48:00,637 --> 00:48:01,837
Sir.

615
00:48:02,739 --> 00:48:04,473
Where is she?

616
00:48:07,944 --> 00:48:09,510
In town.

617
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,080
Got here yesterday.

618
00:48:23,591 --> 00:48:25,924
What are you doing
out here like this, Mud?

619
00:48:30,063 --> 00:48:32,697
I killed that last man
she was with, Tom.

620
00:48:37,202 --> 00:48:38,802
He had it comin', too.

621
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,909
You have been doggin' this
girl your whole life.

622
00:48:49,112 --> 00:48:51,679
She's run you halfway
across the country and back.

623
00:48:52,716 --> 00:48:54,182
And for what?
For this!

624
00:48:54,185 --> 00:48:56,918
Be stuck out here on
this island like this!

625
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,752
Beggin'!

626
00:48:58,755 --> 00:49:00,853
A murderer now! A thief!

627
00:49:00,856 --> 00:49:03,789
I ain't no thief, Tom...
No? What would you call it then?

628
00:49:03,792 --> 00:49:06,993
Not to mention draggin' these
boys into this...

629
00:49:06,996 --> 00:49:09,929
Man, he's really
giving it to him.

630
00:49:09,931 --> 00:49:11,963
You got any idea
what you're doin'?

631
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:18,636
I'm right
ashamed of you, Mud.

632
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:29,879
Don't expect any help from me,
'cause there's none to be given.

633
00:49:39,222 --> 00:49:40,555
All right, I'm ready.

634
00:49:46,161 --> 00:49:47,660
Where you goin'?

635
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:49,828
Hey!

636
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:53,032
God damn it.

637
00:49:59,806 --> 00:50:00,939
You all right?

638
00:50:07,613 --> 00:50:09,146
Looks like we're
on our own, Ellis.

639
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:17,720
I didn't want to have to ask you
to be the one to do this, but I need

640
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:23,058
to get this letter to Juniper.
Can you take it to her for me?

641
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,192
Yeah.

642
00:50:28,264 --> 00:50:30,064
All right, now listen up.

643
00:50:32,034 --> 00:50:34,867
You got to be careful, all right?
You can't just

644
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,337
walk up and knock on her door.
You hear me?

645
00:50:37,339 --> 00:50:39,605
You gotta
watch yourself.

646
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:41,340
I can handle it.

647
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:46,612
Get that to her.

648
00:50:46,615 --> 00:50:47,746
All right.

649
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:50,714
All right.

650
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,919
Watch yourself, Ellis.

651
00:51:22,677 --> 00:51:23,809
You Mud's daddy?

652
00:51:25,747 --> 00:51:27,246
Mud don't have no daddy.

653
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,851
No mama either,
as far as I could tell.

654
00:51:32,854 --> 00:51:35,286
He was livin' in the woods
when I first met him.

655
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:37,121
Younger than you are now.

656
00:51:42,661 --> 00:51:45,428
You boys need to
watch yourselves now.

657
00:51:45,431 --> 00:51:48,431
What Mud's into is somethin' you don't
want to be involved in.

658
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,301
You best forget
about him, you hear?

659
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:19,691
Which one?

660
00:52:20,827 --> 00:52:22,160
Let's start
at the top.

661
00:52:22,163 --> 00:52:23,894
Work our way down.

662
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:25,028
All right.

663
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,409
What you want?

664
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,812
We're sellin' fish.
Would you like to buy some?

665
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:47,748
Fish? I don't want
to buy no damn fish.

666
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,058
Keep lyin' and I'll
crack your nose open!

667
00:53:00,061 --> 00:53:01,426
Keep lyin'!

668
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,829
You hear me, trash?
Where is that guy?

669
00:53:13,438 --> 00:53:14,971
Who are you?

670
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:16,206
Who the hell are you?

671
00:53:16,209 --> 00:53:18,274
He send you?

672
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:19,776
You know this man?

673
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:21,443
Look at it!
Do you know this man?

674
00:53:21,446 --> 00:53:24,113
Fish! Fish!
We're just sellin' fish!

675
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,192
Fish...

676
00:53:55,175 --> 00:53:56,474
I know you know
where he is.

677
00:53:57,942 --> 00:54:00,109
And I swear to God,

678
00:54:00,112 --> 00:54:03,813
I'll cut a hole through every one
of you to find him.

679
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:10,185
We know
you came here for him,

680
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:15,055
and we know he's too stupid
to leave here without you.

681
00:54:15,058 --> 00:54:17,191
So whenever
he sticks his head up

682
00:54:17,194 --> 00:54:20,261
out of whatever shithole
he's hidin' in,

683
00:54:20,264 --> 00:54:21,529
I'm gonna be there.

684
00:54:23,899 --> 00:54:25,498
You tell him that.

685
00:54:31,472 --> 00:54:34,306
You need to mind
your business, boy.

686
00:54:43,449 --> 00:54:44,581
You okay?

687
00:54:44,584 --> 00:54:45,582
Yeah.

688
00:54:45,585 --> 00:54:47,417
Man, he popped your eye.

689
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,608
Let me see your face.

690
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:21,079
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

691
00:55:21,082 --> 00:55:22,514
Here, hold this on there.

692
00:55:25,585 --> 00:55:26,917
Thank you.

693
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:30,588
I'll buy your fish, okay?

694
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:33,089
How much do you want
for the whole cooler?

695
00:55:37,528 --> 00:55:38,894
Mud sent us
to give you this.

696
00:55:41,498 --> 00:55:43,031
You know Mud?

697
00:55:43,034 --> 00:55:44,166
Yeah, we know him.

698
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:16,460
Says,
"Hold tight. "

699
00:56:16,463 --> 00:56:17,661
We know, we read it.

700
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Well, do you know
how long hold tight is?

701
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:25,501
I think it's just a couple days.

702
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:27,303
He wants to get
a boat for y'all.

703
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:33,475
God...

704
00:56:37,013 --> 00:56:38,345
Tell him I'll wait.

705
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:45,418
But I don't want y'all
gettin' involved.

706
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:48,321
So you tell him what I said
and let that be it.

707
00:56:48,324 --> 00:56:50,455
I don't want you
gettin' in any trouble.

708
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:52,357
We'll be all right.
Just keep your door locked.

709
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:53,491
We'll be in touch.

710
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:55,960
Wait.

711
00:56:57,363 --> 00:56:58,496
What's your name?

712
00:56:59,565 --> 00:57:01,632
I'm Ellis,
he's Neckbone.

713
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:17,578
Thank you, Ellis.

714
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:22,549
We gotta go.

715
00:57:37,998 --> 00:57:39,431
Let's go, hard on.

716
00:58:18,366 --> 00:58:20,332
Hello?
Is May Pearl there?

717
00:58:21,435 --> 00:58:23,134
Hey, it's Ellis.

718
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:26,070
In the phone book.

719
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:30,241
Tomorrow?

720
00:58:30,244 --> 00:58:31,709
Yeah, I can meet you.

721
00:58:33,278 --> 00:58:34,745
Okay. Bye.

722
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:50,776
We got moor,
but no motor.

723
00:59:52,747 --> 00:59:54,447
This will work for now.

724
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:56,415
Ellis, you get her
my note?

725
00:59:56,418 --> 00:59:57,582
Yeah.

726
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:02,653
Where'd you get
that shiner from?

727
01:00:05,225 --> 01:00:08,492
there was this guy in there,
he was beatin' up on her.

728
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:11,862
Ellis rushed him.

729
01:00:11,864 --> 01:00:13,495
Got smacked for it.

730
01:00:15,466 --> 01:00:17,232
What'd he look like?

731
01:00:17,235 --> 01:00:18,800
I don't know,

732
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:20,602
he was tall.

733
01:00:20,605 --> 01:00:22,270
Looked like a cowboy.

734
01:00:22,273 --> 01:00:23,772
Light hair slicked back?

735
01:00:23,774 --> 01:00:25,106
Yeah.

736
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,137
Thank you for
looking after her.

737
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:05,907
His name's Carver,

738
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:08,810
he's the brother
of the man I killed.

739
01:01:10,147 --> 01:01:13,781
If he's here,
there's plenty more comin'.

740
01:01:13,783 --> 01:01:15,248
More what?

741
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:18,518
Bounty hunters.
Carver's rotten,

742
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:19,785
but his old man,

743
01:01:19,788 --> 01:01:21,754
that's the one
to be scared of.

744
01:01:21,757 --> 01:01:24,790
He'll spend every dime
he's got to make sure I'm dead.

745
01:01:24,793 --> 01:01:26,492
If it was up to me,

746
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:28,727
I'd lay the whole family down,
same as the other.

747
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,462
Ain't a decent man
between them.

748
01:01:31,465 --> 01:01:32,596
Now, look here.

749
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:36,500
Listen to me,

750
01:01:36,503 --> 01:01:39,770
if you see that old man,
don't you go near him.

751
01:01:39,772 --> 01:01:42,672
He's the triple six
real deal scratch.

752
01:01:42,675 --> 01:01:43,940
What's a scratch?

753
01:01:45,777 --> 01:01:47,476
It's the devil himself.

754
01:01:53,783 --> 01:01:55,816
Let's unload the rest
of this, get it up top.

755
01:02:15,203 --> 01:02:16,735
Now, what are you
waitin' for?

756
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:17,868
Shut up.

757
01:02:20,807 --> 01:02:22,639
All right, Ellis.

758
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:24,675
Can you climb that trunk,

759
01:02:24,678 --> 01:02:26,643
choke this off that limb?
Yeah.

760
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:28,545
Tie it in a bowline knot,
you know it?

761
01:02:28,547 --> 01:02:30,446
I'm not stupid.

762
01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:32,815
Neck, I need you
to start cuttin' line

763
01:02:32,818 --> 01:02:36,518
in 15 two-foot pieces.
Count two foot as long as your arm.

764
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:40,322
Be careful.

765
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:48,661
What's so special about that shirt
you'd lose your pistol for it?

766
01:02:48,664 --> 01:02:50,530
It's got a wolf's eye
sewn into the sleeve.

767
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,733
More protection
than a bullet ever gave.

768
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:55,934
Tom swears by it.

769
01:02:55,937 --> 01:02:57,970
Tom said
he wasn't your daddy.

770
01:02:57,973 --> 01:02:59,838
He's the closest thing to
a father I've ever had.

771
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:02,941
I never met my parents.

772
01:03:03,744 --> 01:03:05,743
It's hard,

773
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:08,345
not knowin' those
you came from.

774
01:03:08,348 --> 01:03:10,981
My Uncle Galen tells me
things about 'em.

775
01:03:10,984 --> 01:03:12,482
He's the one that
takes care of me.

776
01:03:12,485 --> 01:03:15,485
Yeah. Tom
did that for me.

777
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:18,255
What'd you mean when you called
Tom an assassin?

778
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:20,989
Tom's had lives you'd
never even know about.

779
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:24,559
Grew up, up North.
Went to Yale.

780
01:03:24,562 --> 01:03:28,496
For a long time, he was a paid
assassin for the CIA.

781
01:03:28,499 --> 01:03:30,498
Lived in Cuba in '63.

782
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:32,967
Shoot, he's killed more people than
you all probably ever met.

783
01:03:33,902 --> 01:03:35,568
Neck, how's
that line comin'?

784
01:03:37,505 --> 01:03:38,904
If you're gonna do it,
do it!

785
01:04:06,831 --> 01:04:08,430
This shit's crazy.

786
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:12,533
One down.

787
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,589
Come on.

788
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,633
Wanna sit down?

789
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:02,543
Hey, you must
really like to fight.

790
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,512
Not really.

791
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:09,649
You got a lot of friends.

792
01:05:09,652 --> 01:05:10,850
They're all right.

793
01:05:10,852 --> 01:05:12,918
I don't know
all of them.

794
01:05:12,921 --> 01:05:15,887
I bet you're
pretty popular.

795
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:18,490
Why do you say that?

796
01:05:18,493 --> 01:05:21,493
Because you're
nice to people.

797
01:05:21,496 --> 01:05:22,527
How do you know that?

798
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,563
You're nice to me.

799
01:05:25,697 --> 01:05:27,464
But I like you.

800
01:05:32,571 --> 01:05:34,070
I got you something.

801
01:05:36,674 --> 01:05:37,940
A bracelet?

802
01:05:37,943 --> 01:05:39,942
Yeah.

803
01:05:39,945 --> 01:05:42,477
Neckbone's uncle
finds them in the river

804
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,079
and collects the pearls, and I thought
with your name and everything...

805
01:05:45,082 --> 01:05:46,414
Thank you.

806
01:05:58,459 --> 01:06:00,559
You wanna be
my girlfriend?

807
01:07:02,581 --> 01:07:03,880
You've been seeing Mud?

808
01:07:05,216 --> 01:07:06,549
No.

809
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:12,755
You don't have
to lie to me, boy.

810
01:07:12,758 --> 01:07:14,722
I've seen you running around,
taking things.

811
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:22,629
He all right?

812
01:07:23,899 --> 01:07:25,032
He's okay.

813
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,470
He called you
an assassin.

814
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:34,239
How long have
you known Mud?

815
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:36,842
A few days.

816
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,046
That's long enough to
know he's full of shit.

817
01:07:43,216 --> 01:07:45,216
So, it's not true?

818
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:48,017
I was a sharpshooter
for a while

819
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:50,253
in the Marines. In Mud's world,
that's an assassin.

820
01:07:50,256 --> 01:07:52,922
But it's not
exactly true, right?

821
01:07:52,925 --> 01:07:54,591
Yeah, I guess.

822
01:07:54,593 --> 01:07:55,858
Assassin.

823
01:08:02,198 --> 01:08:04,765
You think he's a badass,
don't you?

824
01:08:04,768 --> 01:08:06,100
I don't know.

825
01:08:10,572 --> 01:08:13,640
You know why he's stuck off
on that island?

826
01:08:13,643 --> 01:08:14,774
Yeah.

827
01:08:16,577 --> 01:08:17,910
He shot somebody.

828
01:08:19,779 --> 01:08:21,646
You know why
he shot that man?

829
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:24,916
'Cause he hurt Juniper?

830
01:08:24,919 --> 01:08:26,684
Right.

831
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:36,592
The real reason Mud's in all the
trouble he's got is because of her.

832
01:08:36,595 --> 01:08:40,630
He's been in love with that girl
since he was your age.

833
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:42,665
Trouble is she don't care about
nobody but herself.

834
01:08:42,668 --> 01:08:44,967
I've told him as much.

835
01:08:49,171 --> 01:08:51,705
She'd bed down with the meanest
snake she could find,

836
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:55,242
and then when things got bad,
she'd go runnin' back to Mud.

837
01:08:55,245 --> 01:08:58,712
He'd take her back.

838
01:08:58,714 --> 01:09:03,216
Then he'd go find whatever unlucky
son of a bitch laid a hand on her

839
01:09:03,219 --> 01:09:06,151
and beat him so bad he'd know
never to touch her again.

840
01:09:09,589 --> 01:09:11,556
Only this time, I guess

841
01:09:11,559 --> 01:09:14,859
he figured beatin' wasn't good enough,
he had to go shoot that feller.

842
01:09:20,932 --> 01:09:25,334
I'm not for sure, but I'd put money
on it that she knew he'd do it.

843
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:29,638
She might even
put him up to it.

844
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,144
Either way, those two
are set for failure.

845
01:09:38,647 --> 01:09:41,148
The only chance he's got is to
cut her loose.

846
01:09:42,585 --> 01:09:44,251
That'll never happen.

847
01:09:44,254 --> 01:09:46,286
But I tell you what,
Mud's no badass.

848
01:09:46,288 --> 01:09:47,286
He's runnin' scared
right now...

849
01:09:47,289 --> 01:09:48,955
I've got to go.

850
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:56,695
You're wrong
about Juniper.

851
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:59,130
They love each other
and they're going to make it.

852
01:09:59,132 --> 01:10:02,032
If you weren't such a worn out old man,
you'd know it was true.

853
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:32,759
What do you say, Ellis?

854
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:34,928
I got more stuff.

855
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,997
Yeah?
Did you find a motor?

856
01:10:36,999 --> 01:10:38,262
Not yet.
Oh.

857
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:40,632
What's that?

858
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:42,667
Bonfire's my
all-purpose cure all

859
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:46,070
for bad luck.

860
01:10:46,073 --> 01:10:49,273
I don't know
where this boat's been

861
01:10:49,275 --> 01:10:52,975
or what kind of person
the owner was before me.

862
01:10:52,978 --> 01:10:56,746
For all I know, there could be some
serious bad business left on it.

863
01:10:56,749 --> 01:11:00,716
We got too much ridin' on this thing
to leave to chance.

864
01:11:00,718 --> 01:11:02,884
Tom called me over
to his place this morning.

865
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:04,019
What did he say?

866
01:11:04,955 --> 01:11:07,288
He was
runnin' down Juniper.

867
01:11:07,291 --> 01:11:09,223
Told him he was
a worn out old man.

868
01:11:09,226 --> 01:11:11,425
And he couldn't know
how much you love her.

869
01:11:11,428 --> 01:11:13,093
You don't know
his story.

870
01:11:13,095 --> 01:11:14,193
I don't care.

871
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:16,262
You should.

872
01:11:18,133 --> 01:11:22,435
Tom loved a woman more than most men
can in two lifetimes.

873
01:11:22,438 --> 01:11:25,103
They had a good life
started together.

874
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:29,273
She was pregnant
with a little boy,

875
01:11:29,276 --> 01:11:31,108
birth got
the best of them.

876
01:11:32,045 --> 01:11:34,078
Tom's been alone
ever since.

877
01:11:35,048 --> 01:11:36,714
Lone wolf.

878
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:45,054
Thanks for the tin.

879
01:12:30,961 --> 01:12:33,328
This shit never gets easy.

880
01:12:34,898 --> 01:12:35,997
That's a good haul.

881
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:38,033
I've had worse.

882
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:46,439
You doin' all right?

883
01:12:48,176 --> 01:12:49,309
Yeah.

884
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,347
Do you need to
tell me anything?

885
01:12:54,349 --> 01:12:55,481
Tell you what?

886
01:12:57,384 --> 01:13:00,017
I know I'm just your uncle,
not a parent.

887
01:13:01,521 --> 01:13:03,955
But you can tell me
things if you need to.

888
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,525
I can tell you this helmet
smells like my duck butter.

889
01:13:22,072 --> 01:13:23,905
Where'd you get
that black eye?

890
01:13:26,543 --> 01:13:29,843
A kid in town.
He got his, too.

891
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:31,478
What was y'all
fightin' for?

892
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,279
About this girl.

893
01:13:33,282 --> 01:13:34,914
What girl?

894
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:36,282
My girlfriend.

895
01:13:38,419 --> 01:13:40,419
You got a girlfriend?

896
01:13:40,422 --> 01:13:41,554
Yes, sir.

897
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:44,457
When did that happen?

898
01:13:44,459 --> 01:13:45,923
Other day.

899
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:49,960
What's her name?

900
01:13:50,373 --> 01:13:52,579
May Pearl.
May Pearl.

901
01:13:53,367 --> 01:13:56,333
Two first names,
just like your mother.

902
01:13:58,403 --> 01:14:00,903
Have you seen
your mother today?

903
01:14:00,906 --> 01:14:02,104
No.

904
01:14:04,275 --> 01:14:05,374
You're not
talkin' to me now?

905
01:14:05,377 --> 01:14:08,177
I'm talkin'.
I'm talkin' to both of you.

906
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:09,877
All y'all want
to do is talk.

907
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:14,582
She'd rather tongue lash a problem
than step up and handle it.

908
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:17,050
You'll see one day.

909
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,420
Women are tough, boy.

910
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:22,422
They set you up for things.

911
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:27,593
You can't trust love, Ellis.

912
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:30,496
If you're not careful,
it'll up and run out on you.

913
01:15:53,635 --> 01:15:56,068
Daddy, this is Miller.
He's one of ours.

914
01:15:56,071 --> 01:15:57,336
Appreciate your help.

915
01:15:57,339 --> 01:15:58,471
Yes, sir.

916
01:16:00,108 --> 01:16:01,440
We'll be in,
in a minute.

917
01:16:05,945 --> 01:16:07,077
Catch me up.

918
01:16:08,447 --> 01:16:10,014
We're working in shifts.

919
01:16:10,017 --> 01:16:12,082
Got two
outside her motel.

920
01:16:12,085 --> 01:16:15,452
The others are either out searchin'
or sleepin' here.

921
01:16:15,454 --> 01:16:18,354
I met the county sheriff,
but he wasn't much help.

922
01:16:18,357 --> 01:16:20,290
Said they handle
their own business.

923
01:16:20,293 --> 01:16:23,125
But I got two of
his people on payroll

924
01:16:23,128 --> 01:16:25,160
and a person inside
at the state police.

925
01:16:28,197 --> 01:16:30,364
Ellis, let's go, boy.
Come on.

926
01:16:34,704 --> 01:16:36,037
Okay.

927
01:16:37,105 --> 01:16:38,305
Let's meet the men.

928
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:39,438
Yes, sir.

929
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,353
Shit.

930
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:01,959
Get up.

931
01:17:01,962 --> 01:17:04,161
Y'all pay attention.

932
01:17:04,163 --> 01:17:05,528
This is my father, King.

933
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:07,396
He runs the show.

934
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:11,032
Men.

935
01:17:20,142 --> 01:17:21,375
All right, everybody up.

936
01:17:22,511 --> 01:17:23,643
Gather around.

937
01:17:25,513 --> 01:17:26,746
Now form a circle.

938
01:17:29,416 --> 01:17:31,083
Everybody, take a knee.

939
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:36,021
Want you to join hands.

940
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:41,158
We're gonna pray for the death
of the man who killed my son.

941
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,194
Everybody, bow your heads.

942
01:17:47,332 --> 01:17:48,665
You touch her titty?

943
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:50,233
A little.

944
01:17:50,236 --> 01:17:51,368
That's great, man.

945
01:17:51,371 --> 01:17:53,470
Thanks.

946
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:57,638
We could take it apart,
bring it out piece by piece.

947
01:17:57,641 --> 01:17:59,207
It's welded,
we'd just tear it up.

948
01:18:00,443 --> 01:18:02,210
What if we
float it out?

949
01:18:02,213 --> 01:18:03,544
With what?

950
01:18:03,547 --> 01:18:05,146
Come on.

951
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,384
Oh, Jesus!

952
01:18:11,387 --> 01:18:12,385
What do you think?

953
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,120
That's great, Galen.

954
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:25,497
Come here, Ellis.

955
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:39,509
See that ceiling fan
up there?

956
01:18:41,378 --> 01:18:43,045
I found it in the river.

957
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:46,347
Works great.

958
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:48,349
Best ceiling fan
I've ever owned.

959
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:53,320
This river brings
a lot of trash down it.

960
01:18:53,323 --> 01:18:55,156
Some of that trash
is worth a lot of money.

961
01:18:56,091 --> 01:18:58,824
Some of it's not.

962
01:18:58,827 --> 01:19:01,660
You got to know what's worth keepin'
and what's worth lettin' go.

963
01:19:02,797 --> 01:19:05,297
You know the difference?

964
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:06,432
I think so.

965
01:19:08,334 --> 01:19:10,435
Neck looks up to you.

966
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:15,605
Don't get my nephew into anything
you can't get him out of. Okay?

967
01:19:24,383 --> 01:19:28,750
to get a piece to get over a girl
that put one over on him.

968
01:19:30,487 --> 01:19:32,620
So, you get
your heart broke?

969
01:19:32,623 --> 01:19:34,856
Don't walk around with
a shit look on your face.

970
01:19:34,858 --> 01:19:37,658
Get back in there,
get your tip wet.

971
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:39,860
You hear me?

972
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:44,263
You know what I'm sayin'.
Let's go.

973
01:19:44,266 --> 01:19:46,599
Want to hang out? Allen's comin' over,
we're going to pump it up.

974
01:19:46,601 --> 01:19:48,200
No.
We got stuff to do.

975
01:19:49,203 --> 01:19:50,335
Whatever.

976
01:19:52,306 --> 01:19:53,872
What were y'all
talking about?

977
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,675
I don't know.

978
01:19:56,678 --> 01:19:58,477
King! That's what they call him.

979
01:19:59,744 --> 01:20:01,644
Y'all didn't go
near him, did ya?

980
01:20:01,647 --> 01:20:02,745
No.

981
01:20:02,748 --> 01:20:03,813
Good.

982
01:20:03,816 --> 01:20:05,381
How we lookin'
on that motor?

983
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:08,118
There's one in the scrap yard
that might work.

984
01:20:08,121 --> 01:20:12,122
I can get it runnin'.
Tell him, Ellis. Let's pull this.

985
01:20:12,124 --> 01:20:14,890
It's true, he built his
own dirt bike.

986
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,791
Little more.

987
01:20:17,861 --> 01:20:20,394
Neck, take a shot at it.

988
01:20:20,397 --> 01:20:23,364
I don't know, that motor's
worth somethin'.

989
01:20:23,366 --> 01:20:27,134
It's been there for months.
Nobody will even know it's gone.

990
01:20:27,137 --> 01:20:28,268
Ellis.

991
01:20:29,404 --> 01:20:30,537
We need a motor.

992
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:53,256
Winds out of the west
at 22 miles per hour...

993
01:20:57,495 --> 01:20:58,761
Hello?

994
01:20:58,764 --> 01:20:59,896
Juniper?

995
01:20:59,899 --> 01:21:01,230
Ellis.

996
01:21:01,232 --> 01:21:04,832
Thank God.
I'm goin' crazy in this room.

997
01:21:06,435 --> 01:21:07,801
Is Mud okay?

998
01:21:07,804 --> 01:21:09,603
Yeah, it's time to
take you out to him.

999
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:12,339
Now?

1000
01:21:12,342 --> 01:21:13,774
Tomorrow.

1001
01:21:13,776 --> 01:21:15,542
Tomorrow,
we'll come get you.

1002
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:17,476
He's got a plan
for y'all to get away.

1003
01:21:18,346 --> 01:21:22,581
Neckbone'll be waitin' at the
side of the motel with a dirt bike.

1004
01:21:22,584 --> 01:21:25,284
Wait, just...

1005
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:27,885
Just wait a minute.
I don't know about all that.

1006
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:30,188
Where does he think
we're gonna go?

1007
01:21:30,191 --> 01:21:31,789
What are we
even gonna do?

1008
01:21:33,392 --> 01:21:36,326
This is Mud, this is exactly
what he does.

1009
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:37,394
It's okay.

1010
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:38,862
It's a good plan.

1011
01:21:38,864 --> 01:21:40,362
Just be ready.

1012
01:21:42,233 --> 01:21:43,866
Why are you doing this?

1013
01:21:43,869 --> 01:21:46,235
What do you mean?

1014
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:47,836
Why are you
helping us?

1015
01:21:48,772 --> 01:21:50,505
Because y'all
love each other.

1016
01:21:59,782 --> 01:22:01,215
I'll see you tomorrow.

1017
01:22:01,218 --> 01:22:02,516
Wait.

1018
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:11,356
How'd it go?
We're good.

1019
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:12,490
Give me a quarter.

1020
01:22:13,493 --> 01:22:14,626
May Pearl!

1021
01:22:16,295 --> 01:22:17,428
May Pearl!

1022
01:22:27,905 --> 01:22:30,305
It's all right, man,
she's with her family.

1023
01:22:30,308 --> 01:22:32,908
Come on, I want to get
that motor before dark.

1024
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,243
Hey.

1025
01:22:42,618 --> 01:22:44,384
Y'all remember me,
don't ya?

1026
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:51,490
Sorry about that.

1027
01:22:51,493 --> 01:22:52,758
You caught me
at a real bad time.

1028
01:22:53,994 --> 01:22:55,793
Hold on a second.

1029
01:22:55,796 --> 01:22:57,495
Just a sec.

1030
01:22:57,498 --> 01:22:59,864
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

1031
01:22:59,867 --> 01:23:04,435
Y'all were just doin' a job
and I got in the way.

1032
01:23:04,438 --> 01:23:07,337
What do you say I buy a whole batch of
fish y'all were sellin'?

1033
01:23:08,473 --> 01:23:09,772
Forty cover it?

1034
01:23:09,775 --> 01:23:10,973
That'll about do it.

1035
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,508
We don't want
your money.

1036
01:23:13,611 --> 01:23:15,278
Hold on. Hold on.

1037
01:23:17,848 --> 01:23:19,447
Y'all get around,
don't you?

1038
01:23:20,684 --> 01:23:22,583
Bet ya know every

1039
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:24,618
hole and ditch
in this town.

1040
01:23:28,324 --> 01:23:31,458
You haven't come across that
man whose picture I showed you?

1041
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:32,392
Have you?

1042
01:23:37,632 --> 01:23:39,498
Sure about that?

1043
01:23:39,501 --> 01:23:41,033
Take a look
with your good eye.

1044
01:23:43,903 --> 01:23:45,603
I'm sure.

1045
01:23:45,606 --> 01:23:48,439
What about that girl
from the motel?

1046
01:23:48,442 --> 01:23:50,441
The pretty one.

1047
01:23:50,444 --> 01:23:52,410
Talk to her
some more?

1048
01:23:55,479 --> 01:23:56,612
There's a number on there.

1049
01:23:58,316 --> 01:23:59,782
Let me know if you do.

1050
01:24:34,113 --> 01:24:35,446
This is it.
This is it.

1051
01:24:39,418 --> 01:24:40,783
All right, it's loose.

1052
01:24:47,591 --> 01:24:48,724
Shit's heavy.

1053
01:26:33,816 --> 01:26:35,081
Shit!

1054
01:26:35,084 --> 01:26:36,516
Was she there?

1055
01:26:36,519 --> 01:26:38,118
No.

1056
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:39,685
Come on.

1057
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:49,928
Excuse me, sir.

1058
01:26:49,931 --> 01:26:51,629
What?

1059
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:54,131
We're lookin' for the girl in room 210.
You seen her?

1060
01:26:54,134 --> 01:26:55,165
Yeah, I've seen her.

1061
01:26:55,168 --> 01:26:57,167
You seen her today?

1062
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:59,903
Yeah, she came down here
lookin' for a bar nearby.

1063
01:26:59,906 --> 01:27:02,238
Sent her up to
that place off 61.

1064
01:29:04,712 --> 01:29:09,080
Just leave it there, Mud's going
to have to help us with it.

1065
01:29:09,082 --> 01:29:11,648
What are you
going to tell him?

1066
01:29:11,651 --> 01:29:13,984
I'll just tell him the truth.

1067
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:34,035
Hey, what you
say there, Ellis?

1068
01:29:39,975 --> 01:29:41,608
Tom left this for you.

1069
01:29:48,349 --> 01:29:50,282
Where's Juniper?

1070
01:29:54,354 --> 01:29:56,220
Ellis, what happened?

1071
01:29:56,223 --> 01:29:58,222
Is she okay?

1072
01:29:58,224 --> 01:29:59,856
Was it Carver?

1073
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,193
It wasn't Carver.

1074
01:30:04,262 --> 01:30:05,395
What's goin' on, Ellis?

1075
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,299
She was supposed to meet us
on the side of the motel.

1076
01:30:11,701 --> 01:30:13,034
She never showed up.

1077
01:30:14,704 --> 01:30:16,671
We went around
looking for her.

1078
01:30:17,874 --> 01:30:21,042
Motel clerk said she
went out to a bar on 61.

1079
01:30:24,146 --> 01:30:25,645
We tracked her down.

1080
01:30:27,115 --> 01:30:28,714
She was there
with another guy.

1081
01:30:30,118 --> 01:30:31,717
They were together.

1082
01:30:43,663 --> 01:30:45,896
She must've
thought Carver

1083
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:48,332
was onto her.

1084
01:30:50,035 --> 01:30:51,367
She knew the plan, Mud.

1085
01:30:52,671 --> 01:30:54,137
She just didn't show up.

1086
01:30:59,443 --> 01:31:01,343
What was she doin'
with that guy?

1087
01:31:04,247 --> 01:31:06,347
What was she doin'
with that guy, Ellis?

1088
01:31:08,384 --> 01:31:10,184
They were playing pool.

1089
01:31:11,253 --> 01:31:13,253
And they were drinkin'.

1090
01:31:13,255 --> 01:31:14,386
And laughin'.

1091
01:31:17,124 --> 01:31:18,791
He was close up on her.

1092
01:31:22,763 --> 01:31:24,430
He kissed her neck.

1093
01:31:38,843 --> 01:31:40,443
So that's how it is, huh?

1094
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:44,946
We got that motor.

1095
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:52,419
What do you
want us to do?

1096
01:31:53,989 --> 01:31:55,723
Just go home, Ellis.

1097
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:02,312
Hello?

1098
01:33:02,315 --> 01:33:03,447
Is May Pearl there?

1099
01:33:04,817 --> 01:33:07,251
This is Ellis.

1100
01:33:07,253 --> 01:33:11,020
I called yesterday, you didn't give her
my messages?

1101
01:33:11,023 --> 01:33:12,288
I said it's Ellis.

1102
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:13,790
I'm her boyfriend.

1103
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:16,191
Oh, she's asleep...
Mary Lee!

1104
01:33:16,194 --> 01:33:17,259
Mary Lee!

1105
01:33:17,262 --> 01:33:19,227
What the hell
have you been doin'?

1106
01:33:19,229 --> 01:33:20,528
What have you
been doin'?

1107
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:21,862
Senior, damn it!
Damn it! Stop it!

1108
01:33:21,865 --> 01:33:22,930
You tell her what
you've been doin'.

1109
01:33:22,933 --> 01:33:24,198
I don't know
what you're sayin'.

1110
01:33:24,201 --> 01:33:29,236
J.J. Crawford said a boat motor went missin'
from his stockyard!

1111
01:33:29,239 --> 01:33:33,006
He said his daughter saw this one
and his friend haulin' it off!

1112
01:33:33,008 --> 01:33:36,842
Now, you tell me, right now,
did you steal that motor?

1113
01:33:36,845 --> 01:33:38,310
We didn't steal it.

1114
01:33:38,313 --> 01:33:39,878
You lie to me again.

1115
01:33:42,049 --> 01:33:43,582
We thought it was junk.

1116
01:33:43,584 --> 01:33:45,082
We didn't think
it was worth anything.

1117
01:33:45,085 --> 01:33:46,217
Ellis?

1118
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:51,221
You tellin' me
I raised a thief?

1119
01:33:51,224 --> 01:33:52,422
I'm not a thief.

1120
01:33:52,425 --> 01:33:54,958
You take property
that's not yours,

1121
01:33:54,961 --> 01:33:57,828
property that belongs
to another man.

1122
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:01,297
That junk was
his livelihood.

1123
01:34:01,300 --> 01:34:03,298
I'm ashamed of you!
Senior...

1124
01:34:03,301 --> 01:34:05,400
Shut your mouth.

1125
01:34:05,403 --> 01:34:09,103
You think you can take things
and not have him see it?

1126
01:34:09,105 --> 01:34:13,106
Neither one of you's got any respect for
a man's livelihood!

1127
01:34:13,109 --> 01:34:16,276
A life that puts clothes on your back
and food in your stomach!

1128
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:18,611
Don't you blame this on me.

1129
01:34:18,614 --> 01:34:21,247
One doesn't have a thing
to do with the other and you know it.

1130
01:34:21,249 --> 01:34:24,082
You don't tell me
what I know.

1131
01:34:24,085 --> 01:34:26,284
If you can steal a man's life out
from under him

1132
01:34:26,287 --> 01:34:28,220
and think he won't take
a lesson from that,

1133
01:34:28,223 --> 01:34:29,554
then you're dumber
than you look.

1134
01:34:29,557 --> 01:34:31,323
Stop it, Dad!
And she's raisin' you

1135
01:34:31,326 --> 01:34:33,258
a snake,
just like herself.

1136
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:36,459
And you can curl up beside her
before I give a goddamn!

1137
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,494
But you just
remember this, boy.

1138
01:34:38,497 --> 01:34:40,296
You just remember,
when they come in here

1139
01:34:40,299 --> 01:34:42,298
and they tear
this place apart

1140
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:45,435
board by board!
You hear me?

1141
01:34:48,205 --> 01:34:52,206
You are a man who's never had the
strength to support his own life.

1142
01:34:56,179 --> 01:34:58,179
Ellis.

1143
01:34:58,181 --> 01:35:01,381
You'll return that motor
from where you found it,

1144
01:35:01,384 --> 01:35:05,252
and you'll apologize in person to
the man you took it from.

1145
01:35:07,622 --> 01:35:10,322
I won't hear about
anything like this again.

1146
01:35:30,241 --> 01:35:32,074
I can't take
that motor back.

1147
01:35:33,244 --> 01:35:35,177
But I can
pay him for it.

1148
01:35:35,179 --> 01:35:36,944
I'll give him
what he wants.

1149
01:35:40,283 --> 01:35:42,416
I don't care
what you do, Ellis.

1150
01:35:53,928 --> 01:35:55,560
What the hell's all this?

1151
01:35:59,533 --> 01:36:01,967
I guess he didn't care
about bein' seen.

1152
01:36:05,672 --> 01:36:07,638
He had something else
on his mind.

1153
01:36:38,166 --> 01:36:39,698
What you all hidin' for?

1154
01:37:07,124 --> 01:37:08,256
Found your shirt.

1155
01:37:11,027 --> 01:37:12,159
You can keep it.

1156
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:16,696
I don't need it no more.

1157
01:37:18,433 --> 01:37:20,633
Saw what's left
of your bonfire.

1158
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:27,406
Somebody could have
seen you.

1159
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:33,544
Do some drinkin'
last night?

1160
01:37:34,514 --> 01:37:37,482
I did a lot of drinkin'
last night.

1161
01:37:37,485 --> 01:37:41,319
Neck, I'm gonna need you to stay
here and get this motor runnin'.

1162
01:37:41,321 --> 01:37:43,352
Ellis, I need you to do
somethin' else for me.

1163
01:37:45,123 --> 01:37:46,489
I need you to get
that to Juniper.

1164
01:37:48,226 --> 01:37:49,358
Okay, Mud.

1165
01:37:51,095 --> 01:37:52,261
Neck, let's go.

1166
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,132
You still takin' Juniper?

1167
01:38:00,102 --> 01:38:02,302
Neck, fetch me
that socket wrench.

1168
01:38:12,647 --> 01:38:14,246
You be all right?

1169
01:38:14,249 --> 01:38:16,181
Yeah. How about you?

1170
01:38:17,117 --> 01:38:18,250
He'll be okay.

1171
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:21,218
Can I borrow your bike?

1172
01:38:21,221 --> 01:38:22,353
Yeah.

1173
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,222
Don't tump it.

1174
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,394
I was wonderin'
when I'd see you.

1175
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:18,301
Sorry about last night.

1176
01:39:18,304 --> 01:39:20,303
I'm supposed to
give this to you.

1177
01:39:20,305 --> 01:39:21,236
What?

1178
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,841
Okay.

1179
01:39:29,847 --> 01:39:31,545
Did you read it?

1180
01:39:31,548 --> 01:39:32,680
No.

1181
01:39:35,183 --> 01:39:36,483
I gotta go.

1182
01:39:36,486 --> 01:39:37,617
Ellis.

1183
01:39:39,721 --> 01:39:41,688
I said I was sorry.

1184
01:39:41,691 --> 01:39:43,356
All you had to do
was be there.

1185
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:45,225
I couldn't.

1186
01:39:45,227 --> 01:39:46,624
Then why'd you
even come here?

1187
01:39:48,194 --> 01:39:50,228
I came here
to leave with him.

1188
01:39:51,431 --> 01:39:52,563
I did.

1189
01:39:57,203 --> 01:39:59,570
You know
you don't know him, right?

1190
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,572
I know he'd do
anything for you.

1191
01:40:03,575 --> 01:40:05,374
Is that what you think?

1192
01:40:09,313 --> 01:40:11,514
Mud's a born liar.

1193
01:40:11,516 --> 01:40:15,683
That's why people like him, he makes
them feel good about themselves.

1194
01:40:23,691 --> 01:40:25,358
I do love him.

1195
01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:29,162
I just

1196
01:40:30,698 --> 01:40:34,366
can't spend the rest of my life
runnin' away with him.

1197
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:55,784
Tell him I understand.

1198
01:40:57,922 --> 01:40:59,254
What's it say?

1199
01:41:01,224 --> 01:41:02,924
Says,
"It's over. "

1200
01:41:08,797 --> 01:41:10,363
Bye, Ellis.

1201
01:42:32,769 --> 01:42:33,968
Did you get
my phone calls?

1202
01:42:33,971 --> 01:42:35,970
What?
I've been tryin' to call you.

1203
01:42:35,973 --> 01:42:38,338
Who's this guy?
Get your head out of my car, kid.

1204
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:42,643
Ellis!
I called you twice!

1205
01:42:42,645 --> 01:42:44,477
Stop it, Kyle!

1206
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,945
Stop it!

1207
01:42:45,948 --> 01:42:47,046
Kyle!

1208
01:42:49,551 --> 01:42:50,983
Stop it, Kyle!

1209
01:42:50,986 --> 01:42:52,318
God!

1210
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,020
What the hell you
doin' here, Ellis?

1211
01:42:56,023 --> 01:42:59,423
You can't just run up
and punch people I'm with.

1212
01:43:01,727 --> 01:43:05,329
I'm sorry, I just wanted to know
why you hadn't called me back.

1213
01:43:06,965 --> 01:43:08,998
Why would I call
you back, Ellis?

1214
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,566
Because you're
my girlfriend.

1215
01:43:13,404 --> 01:43:15,504
I'm not your girlfriend.

1216
01:43:15,507 --> 01:43:16,672
We've been
on one date.

1217
01:43:16,675 --> 01:43:17,806
One.

1218
01:43:19,309 --> 01:43:20,541
Yeah, but...

1219
01:43:20,544 --> 01:43:23,044
But what?
What'd you expect, Ellis?

1220
01:43:26,315 --> 01:43:27,947
I love you.

1221
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:31,317
You're 14.

1222
01:43:36,057 --> 01:43:39,058
I don't know.
He's just this kid.

1223
01:43:40,594 --> 01:43:42,060
Come on, let's...

1224
01:43:49,968 --> 01:43:51,101
Try it now.

1225
01:43:52,638 --> 01:43:53,770
Nothin'.

1226
01:43:54,807 --> 01:43:56,572
Son of a bitch.

1227
01:44:07,084 --> 01:44:08,583
What she say?

1228
01:44:08,585 --> 01:44:10,851
You're a liar!

1229
01:44:10,854 --> 01:44:12,952
Makin' two kids run around,
doin' all the work

1230
01:44:12,955 --> 01:44:15,455
because you're too scared
to do it yourself!

1231
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:20,059
Makin' me tell her it's over because
you're too scared!

1232
01:44:21,729 --> 01:44:24,730
You said you loved her
and you lied!

1233
01:44:24,733 --> 01:44:27,032
You gave up on her,
and she gave up on you!

1234
01:44:27,035 --> 01:44:28,699
Just like everybody else!

1235
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,902
I trusted you!

1236
01:44:33,438 --> 01:44:37,674
Bonfires and crosses and wolf's eye...
Bullshit!

1237
01:44:37,677 --> 01:44:39,075
Now, come on, Ellis.

1238
01:44:39,078 --> 01:44:41,878
Every single thing
you told me was a lie!

1239
01:44:43,581 --> 01:44:46,081
You never cared about her,
and you never cared about us!

1240
01:44:47,784 --> 01:44:49,150
Not enough to matter!

1241
01:44:52,088 --> 01:44:53,154
You used us.

1242
01:44:55,092 --> 01:44:56,958
You made me a thief!

1243
01:44:59,861 --> 01:45:00,993
Let me talk to him.

1244
01:45:02,964 --> 01:45:04,096
Ellis!

1245
01:45:09,070 --> 01:45:10,703
Ellis, come on!

1246
01:45:13,974 --> 01:45:15,572
Ellis, wait a minute.

1247
01:45:16,676 --> 01:45:17,808
Ellis!

1248
01:45:26,584 --> 01:45:27,850
Shit.

1249
01:45:28,987 --> 01:45:30,118
Mud!

1250
01:45:31,422 --> 01:45:33,522
Ellis! He fell
in the creek!

1251
01:45:33,991 --> 01:45:36,091
He fell into the snakes!

1252
01:45:36,093 --> 01:45:37,792
Mud, please!

1253
01:46:05,617 --> 01:46:07,484
Get the motor started, Neck!

1254
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:13,890
Is he okay?
Is he bit?

1255
01:46:21,565 --> 01:46:22,697
Shit.

1256
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:25,033
What time is it?

1257
01:46:26,138 --> 01:46:27,762
What time is it?

1258
01:46:28,804 --> 01:46:30,771
4:18!

1259
01:46:30,774 --> 01:46:33,172
Yell it out every 10 minutes.

1260
01:46:33,175 --> 01:46:34,607
Okay.

1261
01:46:37,778 --> 01:46:40,212
Is he going to be okay?

1262
01:46:41,181 --> 01:46:43,148
Got to get him
to the clinic.

1263
01:46:43,984 --> 01:46:45,851
Are you bit?

1264
01:46:48,988 --> 01:46:50,254
No.

1265
01:47:07,837 --> 01:47:09,737
My bike's up there!

1266
01:47:41,165 --> 01:47:43,966
Need some help here!

1267
01:47:43,969 --> 01:47:46,068
Snake bite!

1268
01:47:46,071 --> 01:47:47,670
It's a snake bite!
Stay calm.

1269
01:47:47,673 --> 01:47:49,605
Cottonmouth.

1270
01:47:49,608 --> 01:47:54,543
Okay, we'll take care of him.
Let's go! Let's go, people.

1271
01:48:10,257 --> 01:48:12,691
Sir.

1272
01:48:12,694 --> 01:48:14,259
We're going to need
some information from you.

1273
01:48:21,034 --> 01:48:22,232
Sir.

1274
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:30,240
Sir!

1275
01:48:49,058 --> 01:48:50,223
Hello?

1276
01:50:41,955 --> 01:50:43,086
It's okay.

1277
01:50:44,056 --> 01:50:45,255
Just sit back.

1278
01:50:50,027 --> 01:50:51,427
Where am I?

1279
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:53,762
You're home.

1280
01:50:53,765 --> 01:50:55,831
We brought you home.

1281
01:50:58,835 --> 01:51:00,068
Come on, sit up.

1282
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:01,201
Come on.

1283
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:08,008
You had us scared, son.

1284
01:51:11,013 --> 01:51:13,480
I'm so glad
you're okay.

1285
01:51:13,482 --> 01:51:16,014
The doctors gave
you some medicine.

1286
01:51:16,017 --> 01:51:17,782
You had a snake bite.

1287
01:51:19,019 --> 01:51:21,086
How did I get
to the doctor?

1288
01:51:21,089 --> 01:51:23,088
A man brought you in.

1289
01:51:23,091 --> 01:51:25,023
No one knew him.

1290
01:51:25,991 --> 01:51:28,459
Oh, no, no,
it's all right.

1291
01:51:28,462 --> 01:51:31,094
You just rest now.
We'll talk about it later.

1292
01:51:33,998 --> 01:51:36,833
Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?

1293
01:51:36,836 --> 01:51:37,967
No.

1294
01:51:40,037 --> 01:51:42,771
Come on,
let him get some rest.

1295
01:51:47,009 --> 01:51:49,443
I'll be back in
to check on you.

1296
01:52:00,355 --> 01:52:02,054
Mom? Dad?

1297
01:52:03,923 --> 01:52:06,057
I love you.

1298
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:08,059
We love you,
too, Ellis.

1299
01:52:48,462 --> 01:52:52,430
The sun does shine on a dog's ass
some days, huh?

1300
01:52:52,432 --> 01:52:53,998
It ain't sunk yet.

1301
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,235
Wish Ellis could see it.

1302
01:52:58,238 --> 01:52:59,370
I know.

1303
01:53:00,373 --> 01:53:01,572
Mmm.

1304
01:53:05,843 --> 01:53:08,076
Looks like you get
your end of the deal.

1305
01:53:13,150 --> 01:53:14,850
Where's the bullets?

1306
01:53:14,853 --> 01:53:18,086
Deal was for the gun,
not the bullets.

1307
01:53:18,088 --> 01:53:19,219
Shit.

1308
01:53:20,422 --> 01:53:21,555
Yeah.

1309
01:53:25,294 --> 01:53:28,061
Neck, I've got one more favor
I want to ask of you.

1310
01:54:00,375 --> 01:54:01,635
Mud?

1311
01:54:05,395 --> 01:54:07,061
Don't get up.

1312
01:54:10,265 --> 01:54:11,497
How'd you get here?

1313
01:54:13,168 --> 01:54:14,534
Neck brought me.

1314
01:54:29,148 --> 01:54:30,982
We got the boat
in the water.

1315
01:54:30,985 --> 01:54:32,650
You did?
Yeah.

1316
01:54:32,652 --> 01:54:34,584
Smooth sailing
from here on out.

1317
01:54:40,892 --> 01:54:44,093
Wouldn't have felt right leavin' town
without comin' to say goodbye.

1318
01:54:48,031 --> 01:54:50,031
I'm sorry
about what I said.

1319
01:54:50,034 --> 01:54:51,532
No, you were
right to be mad.

1320
01:54:51,535 --> 01:54:53,367
You were right
about a lot of things.

1321
01:54:55,037 --> 01:54:57,337
I don't traffic in the truth
too often, but

1322
01:54:59,540 --> 01:55:01,173
I did love her.

1323
01:55:02,477 --> 01:55:03,609
I do

1324
01:55:05,146 --> 01:55:06,679
love her.

1325
01:55:07,649 --> 01:55:09,514
She loves you, too.

1326
01:55:09,517 --> 01:55:10,649
She said it.

1327
01:55:12,919 --> 01:55:16,487
Yeah, I just made mistakes.
Heck, we both did, you know.

1328
01:55:17,690 --> 01:55:19,256
It's a hard life
to keep up with,

1329
01:55:19,259 --> 01:55:23,193
can't blame her for
gettin' tired of tryin'.

1330
01:55:26,263 --> 01:55:29,197
My dad says you can't count
on women loving you.

1331
01:55:29,200 --> 01:55:31,300
He said
you can't trust them.

1332
01:55:34,604 --> 01:55:36,237
That's not true.

1333
01:55:39,341 --> 01:55:41,641
You're a good man, Ellis.

1334
01:55:43,612 --> 01:55:47,080
You meet a girl half as good as you,
you're going to be all right.

1335
01:55:50,718 --> 01:55:52,151
You're a good man, too, Mud.

1336
01:55:54,588 --> 01:55:55,720
No.

1337
01:55:57,257 --> 01:56:00,458
No, I ain't, Ellis.

1338
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,059
Maybe from here
on out, I can...

1339
01:56:13,971 --> 01:56:15,537
Stay put.

1340
01:56:15,986 --> 01:56:17,719
Ellis!

1341
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:22,010
Don't move.

1342
01:56:50,302 --> 01:56:51,434
Mud!

1343
01:56:57,042 --> 01:56:58,474
Let him go.

1344
01:57:02,078 --> 01:57:03,444
You still down there, buddy?

1345
01:57:03,447 --> 01:57:05,713
Yeah.
All right, stay put.

1346
01:57:44,281 --> 01:57:46,114
Flush him out this way.

1347
01:58:08,069 --> 01:58:09,134
Mud!

1348
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:15,074
Mud!

1349
01:58:15,077 --> 01:58:16,240
Aah!

1350
01:58:23,116 --> 01:58:24,114
Mud!

1351
01:58:26,718 --> 01:58:28,151
Mud!

1352
01:58:30,688 --> 01:58:32,087
Mud!
Ellis!

1353
01:58:32,090 --> 01:58:33,221
Ellis!

1354
01:58:35,158 --> 01:58:36,825
Ellis. Ellis.

1355
01:58:39,496 --> 01:58:40,628
It's okay.

1356
01:59:59,831 --> 02:00:01,164
Hello?

1357
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:04,167
You're speaking to him.

1358
02:00:12,208 --> 02:00:13,440
He's dead?

1359
02:01:44,454 --> 02:01:45,586
Hey.

1360
02:01:46,823 --> 02:01:47,989
You got your bike back?

1361
02:01:47,992 --> 02:01:49,890
Yeah.

1362
02:01:49,892 --> 02:01:51,524
Mud dinged
the shit out of it.

1363
02:01:56,030 --> 02:01:57,830
They're really doing it.

1364
02:02:00,935 --> 02:02:02,434
It's the law.

1365
02:02:03,703 --> 02:02:04,836
It's bullshit.

1366
02:02:07,707 --> 02:02:08,840
They ever find Tom?

1367
02:02:09,975 --> 02:02:11,842
No. He's gone.

1368
02:02:14,612 --> 02:02:16,012
I heard on the news,

1369
02:02:17,915 --> 02:02:19,849
they still hadn't
found Mud's body.

1370
02:02:21,586 --> 02:02:23,286
You think he's dead?

1371
02:02:25,455 --> 02:02:26,888
I don't know.

1372
02:02:26,891 --> 02:02:28,023
I hope not.

1373
02:02:32,461 --> 02:02:33,961
I gotta go.

1374
02:02:33,964 --> 02:02:36,330
Come by the apartments later,
help me fix up my room.

1375
02:02:36,333 --> 02:02:37,464
All right.

1376
02:03:54,431 --> 02:03:55,564
I'll see you next week?

1377
02:03:56,700 --> 02:03:58,033
You betcha.

1378
02:04:03,072 --> 02:04:04,872
Ellis.

1379
02:04:04,875 --> 02:04:07,007
You mind
your mother, okay?

1380
02:04:07,009 --> 02:04:08,708
This is a big change
for her, too.

1381
02:04:09,678 --> 02:04:11,978
She's gonna
need your support.

1382
02:04:11,981 --> 02:04:12,912
Yes, sir.

1383
02:04:14,149 --> 02:04:15,481
All right.

1384
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:21,853
I love you.

1385
02:04:26,693 --> 02:04:27,825
I love you, too.

1386
02:06:09,180 --> 02:06:10,913
Come on, son.

1387
02:06:11,850 --> 02:06:13,216
You gotta see this.
