6
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,160
I'm comin' out now.

7
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,840
I'm tired, I want something different.

8
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,360
I just want to have a conversation.

9
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,880
I just want to talk about it.

10
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,490
Shit.

11
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,760
What the shit, man?

12
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,000
Suck it! Drive.

13
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,400
How old is she?

14
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,560
A junior.

15
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,810
She's got nice titties. You talk to her?

16
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
No.

17
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,000
You're gonna have to talk to her.

18
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
I know.

19
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,880
Remind me when we get back to my house.

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,290
I think Galen's got a book on that.

21
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
Shit.

22
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
Your dad would kill us if he knew we went out there.

23
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
I'm not worried about my dad killin' us.

24
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,480
We need to move if we're gonna make it back.

25
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,320
Set your watch, we need a good 15 minutes.

26
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,520
There it is!

27
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,200
Galen says it's been here a while.

28
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,890
He thinks the last flood did it.

29
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,920
Oh, hold it.

30
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Look.

31
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,480
Little shits.

32
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,200
There it is.

33
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,800
Yeah. There it is.

34
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
Came down from up there.

35
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,000
Motor's gone.

36
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,360
Who else knows about this?

37
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Just me and Galen.

38
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
What's he think?

39
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,200
He don't care about it.

40
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,560
Good.

41
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
Because this boat's ours.

42
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,520
This is perfect.

43
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,170
Holy shit.

44
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Dude.

45
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,160
Son of a bitch!

46
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,050
Those are awesome.

47
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Man.

48
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Neck.

49
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,560
Dude, look at that beave, you gotta see this.

50
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
- Neck. - What?

51
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Someone's here.

52
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
What?

53
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,880
Someone's living here.

54
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,000
Shit.

55
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,600
We gotta go. Can't be late.

56
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,480
- What are you doing? - I saw that same

57
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,760
boot print up in the tree.

58
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
It's got a cross in the heel.

59
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,680
Somebody's been in our boat.

60
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,840
Shit. Let's go!

61
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,000
We gotta go if you wanna make it back.

62
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,240
Takes twice as long goin' upriver.

63
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Hold on.

64
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
Up there, they stop.

65
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Where the hell'd he go?

66
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I don't know.

67
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,160
Shit, you know that guy?

68
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,210
I've never seen him before.

69
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
Shit.

70
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,440
What'd you say, boy?

71
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,480
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

72
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
What's that?

73
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,480
Boat in a tree.

74
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
Hell of a thing.

75
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,680
You talkin' about our boat?

76
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,400
Talkin' about my boat.

77
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
We found it.

78
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,720
Yeah, you found it with me livin' in it.

79
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,760
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

80
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,000
You got crosses in your heels.

81
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,760
Nails.

82
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,040
Shaped like crosses.

83
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
What for?

84
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,450
Ward off evil spirits.

85
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,760
Bought 'em from a man I called an Indian,

86
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,690
but he was a Mexican,

87
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
said they were seven-league boots

88
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,520
worn by the seventh son of the seventh son.

89
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,040
Told me they'd turn me into a werewolf, that's a lie.

90
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,200
I don't know nothin' about that.

91
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,640
They just good luck boots.

92
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,040
As you can see, they ain't working too well so far.

93
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,370
What's your name?

94
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
I'm Neckbone, he's Ellis.

95
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,640
And, mister, I know you're not the owner of that boat,

96
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,800
not for nine-tenths of nothin'.

97
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,970
Neckbone...

98
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,090
That's a heck of a good handle, son.

99
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,560
Where y'all from?

100
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,040
What do you care where we're from?

101
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
DeWitt.

102
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,240
Arkansas boys.

103
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,440
Y'all had me worried for a second.

104
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
We supposed to know you?

105
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
I doubt it.

106
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,520
I grew up around here, but I've been gone a while.

107
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,080
Where at around here?

108
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,320
Different places.

109
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,080
Spent a lot of time back up near the White.

110
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,720
You know Shelly's Oxbow?

111
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Ellis.

112
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Yeah, I know it.

113
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,130
An old man named Tom Blankenship used to live up in there.

114
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
He still does.

115
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,720
His boat's across from mine.

116
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,720
Well, ain't that somethin'?

117
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,640
Now, I like you two boys. You remind me of

118
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,360
me.

119
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,000
Seein' as how you two is from Arkansas,

120
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,070
and we know some of the same

121
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,810
people and we grew up in some of the same places,

122
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,360
I reckon we can make a deal for somethin'.

123
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
A deal for what?

124
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
Food.

125
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Food for a boat.

126
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,160
He's a bum, Ellis. Come on.

127
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,730
Why don't you go get your own food?

128
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,050
Well, I would if I could.

129
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,640
See, I told somebody I'd meet 'em here. So...

130
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,880
I'm stuck for now and what I've got is runnin' low.

131
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
He's a bum, Ellis, come on.

132
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,370
I ain't no bum. I got money, boy.

133
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,080
You can call me a hobo,

134
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,280
'cause a hobo will work for his living,

135
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,800
and you can call me homeless 'cause...

136
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,140
Well, that's true for now,

137
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,040
but you call me a bum again,

138
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,640
I'm gonna teach you somethin' about respect your daddy never did.

139
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,440
When they show up, you'll leave?

140
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Yup.

141
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,440
And when you leave, that boat's ours?

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's right.

143
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm just in a tight spot.

144
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
Could use a little help.

145
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,680
We gotta go.

146
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
You get his name?

147
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,480
No.

148
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Sorry.

149
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,640
Where ya been?

150
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,210
Me and Neck got caught up helpin' Galen.

151
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,640
You're supposed to be helpin' me. I had to load this myself.

152
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,160
I know. I'm sorry.

153
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Get on in the back, can't be later than we are.

154
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,480
Supposed to be 10.

155
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,000
It's 10, you do your share.

156
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,200
I loaded this morning, makes it five.

157
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,490
Can you drop me at Neck's?

158
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Hadn't you seen enough of him today?

159
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,520
Said he had somethin' for me.

160
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,680
You see any more of them Ding Dongs over there?

161
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,850
What did Mama want to talk to you about?

162
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,480
What?

163
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,240
This morning? What did she want to talk to you about?

164
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,120
You spy on me in my own house?

165
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,640
I wasn't spyin', I just heard y'all.

166
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,010
That's your mother's business.

167
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,770
I came for that book.

168
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
Oh, yeah. Gotta give it a minute.

169
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
Hear that music?

170
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,160
Yeah?

171
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,000
That means he's doin' it. That's his doin' it song.

172
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
You know who it is?

173
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,800
Whoever's drivin' that Pontiac.

174
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,210
You tell Galen about this morning?

175
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,160
Nah. You tell anybody?

176
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,880
That guy's crazy.

177
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,840
I don't know. I think he just needed a little help.

178
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,320
He can swim his ass off that island and get some.

179
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,600
I think I'm gonna go back out there,

180
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,200
give him some food.

181
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,400
Why?

182
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,410
You're Neckbone, right?

183
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Yeah.

184
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,720
Word of advice.

185
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,840
Don't grow up to be like your shit heel uncle.

186
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,080
You hear me?

187
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,920
You treat a woman like a princess, got it?

188
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,240
Yeah.

189
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,520
Come on, baby!

190
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,080
I'm a goddamn princess!

191
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,760
That's uncalled for.

192
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,150
Hey, a lot of people are

193
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,520
comfortable with that kind of thing in the bedroom.

194
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,580
Some people aren't.

195
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,410
We know that about you now, okay?

196
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
What do you think I am?

197
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,080
Pearls.

198
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,850
Galen finds 'em in the mussel shells.

199
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Come on, let's get that book.

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
- You weren't havin' any fun? - No!

201
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,600
- No fun at all? - No!

202
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,090
Please don't go.

203
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,960
I don't want you goin' back out there by yourself.

204
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,960
That river's scary enough with two people.

205
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,280
I don't trust that guy.

206
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,640
Here it is.

207
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,280
Galen said that really turned things around for him.

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Thanks.

209
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,410
Watch out for that dog.

210
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,650
You really goin' back out there?

211
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,320
Yeah. I think it's the right thing to do.

212
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
All right.

213
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,920
I'll be over in the mornin' then.

214
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,160
Hey, that's a good book. Be sure you do the worksheets in back.

215
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,280
Let's get some dinner, Neck.

216
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,440
Hey, I'll call before I come.

217
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,760
All right.

218
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
You okay, Mama?

219
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Yes.

220
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,360
Are you hungry?

221
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,490
You want me to fix you something?

222
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,160
I'm all right.

223
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,680
Well, then, I'm going to turn in.

224
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,050
Hey, Dad.

225
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,810
What do you know about Tom Blankenship?

226
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,600
What?

227
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
Mr. Blankenship, what do you know about him?

228
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,250
Why?

229
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,200
I don't know. He just looks lonely over there all by himself.

230
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,240
Some people move to this river to work on it,

231
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,760
and some people move here to be left alone.

232
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,680
I want us to try and sit down for dinner tonight, okay?

233
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,360
Ellis?

234
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,130
Be home by 7:00.

235
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,280
Where do you think he's at?

237
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,800
Let's try the boat.

238
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,560
Looks like he made camp.

239
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,570
You think he's up there?

240
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,840
What are you doin'?

241
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,240
I try to never sleep in the same spot twice.

242
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,840
- What you got there? - Brought you some food.

243
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,880
Here, take it.

244
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,200
I owe you boys.

245
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,520
I was gonna try and run a trotline this afternoon.

246
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,170
See where that got me.

247
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,240
Green beans never tasted so good.

248
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,280
Why you have that pistol?

249
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,400
Protection.

250
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,730
Y'all needn't be afraid of me.

251
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,080
I've got two ways to protect myself out here, this shirt

252
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
and this pistol.

253
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,560
There are fierce powers at work in the world, boys.

254
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,720
Good, evil,

255
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,160
poor luck, best luck.

256
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,840
As men,

257
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,240
we've got to take advantage where we can.

258
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,760
Y'all comin'?

259
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,090
So who's this guy you're waiting on?

260
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,760
Oh, I'm not waitin' on no guy.

261
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,080
I'm waitin' on my girlfriend.

262
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,120
- Juniper. - Is she hot?

263
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,360
She's beautiful.

264
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,720
Bullshit!

265
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,960
Prettiest girl I've ever seen, hands down.

266
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,960
Blonde hair, long legs.

267
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,360
I tell you, she's like a dream you don't want to wake up from.

268
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,440
She's got these birds tattooed on her hands here.

269
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,400
Nightingales.

270
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,650
Good luck birds.

271
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,240
That a good luck snake?

272
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,810
No, it is not.

273
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,210
I hate snakes.

274
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,290
That's because God put 'em here for us to fear.

275
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,140
We knew to be afraid of snakes

276
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,640
long before we ever even got into this world.

277
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,550
The Cherokee would wrap

278
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,290
their pregnant women's bellies in snake skin.

279
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,720
Induce labor, scare the child out.

280
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,880
Put that around your bed at night.

281
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,840
Snake won't cross a braided rope.

282
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Thanks.

283
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,570
So what's that tattoo for then?

284
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,960
A reminder.

285
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,320
Don't get bit.

286
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,530
I was 10, swimmin' about a mile up from here,

287
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,880
me and Juniper.

288
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,520
Son of a bitch

289
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,160
swam up on me, bit me right here up under the armpit.

290
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,800
Juniper got me off to the clinic.

291
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,680
Doctor said I should have been dead in 20 minutes.

292
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Took us over an hour just to get to town.

293
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,680
So what'd they do for it?

294
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,000
Gave me the anti-venom.

295
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Cottonmouth.

296
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,080
See here?

297
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,520
Thing with anti-venom is,

298
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,600
they can only give it to you once.

299
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,880
Made of horse blood. Body would reject it a second time.

300
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,680
So the cure becomes more dangerous than the poison.

301
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,720
What happens if you get bit again?

302
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
I die

303
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,760
or just sweat it out.

304
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,600
We gotta go help Neck's uncle.

305
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,760
All right.

306
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,570
You never said your name.

307
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,840
Mud.

308
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,330
You can call me Mud.

309
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Here, Mud.

310
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,320
I think you need this worse than I do.

311
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,200
I'll be all right.

312
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,040
You start datin', I bet her dad'll give you a free pickup.

313
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't care about that.

314
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
What the hell are you doing?

315
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,480
Where you goin'?

316
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,360
Stop it!

317
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,920
Stop it! God!

318
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,720
Holy shit, Pryor, get off your ass!

319
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,520
You only got what you deserve!

320
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,440
That's right, go home, Pryor!

321
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,960
Do I know you?

322
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,210
I'm Ellis, that's Neck.

323
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,400
We went to junior high with you before you went to high school.

324
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,840
How old are you?

325
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Fourteen.

326
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,880
You know you just punched a senior.

327
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
So?

328
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,520
I'm May Pearl.

329
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,480
I know.

330
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,400
What else do you know?

331
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Nothing.

332
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,240
Son of a bitch.

333
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Ellis.

334
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Ellis!

335
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,640
Look.

336
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,410
You ever seen that girl before?

337
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,600
No.

338
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,690
Did you see her hands?

339
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,720
Hey, girl!

340
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,930
Hey, girl, where you goin'?

341
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,290
That ain't even cool.

342
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,760
Oh, sorry.

343
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,920
We think we know a guy that might know that girl over there.

344
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,160
May Pearl, let's go!

345
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Okay.

346
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
Okay, I guess I'll see you.

347
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,770
If you can find my number,

348
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,480
you should give me a call.

349
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,800
I can find it.

350
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Where'd she go?

351
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,680
Into the Piggly Wiggly. She came from the motel.

352
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
Home for dinner?

353
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,640
What you hidin' for?

354
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
I ain't hidin'.

355
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Come over here.

356
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,560
You know I love you?

357
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,480
Yes, sir.

358
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,280
I know.

359
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,470
I work you hard,

360
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,680
'cause life is work.

361
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,160
You know that?

362
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,280
Yes, sir.

363
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,040
Your mom is talkin' about movin' into town.

364
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
What's that mean?

365
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,600
She seems set on it,

366
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
wants to separate.

367
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,760
May even ask for a divorce.

368
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,650
What's that mean for me?

369
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,400
It means enjoy this river, son.

370
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,280
Enjoy it while you live on it.

371
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
'Cause this way of life isn't long for this world.

372
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,200
River Authority's about made certain of that.

373
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,760
But you and me,

374
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,080
we can still live out here, right?

375
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,560
R.A. can't take your boat.

376
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,960
Not while you're still livin' in it.

377
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,050
This houseboat's in your mother's name.

378
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,440
Her daddy gave it to her, not to me.

379
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,280
She wants to leave it.

380
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,690
River Authority's got every right to come in here

381
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,440
and tear this place apart board by board.

382
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,680
That ain't right.

383
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,520
You work outta here.

384
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
We got the ice machine.

385
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,520
The traps.

386
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,520
What are we supposed to do?

387
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,280
Like I said, that's your mother's business.

388
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,920
I ain't no townie.

389
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,080
I ain't livin' like that.

390
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,010
I've let you down, son.

391
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,280
Man is supposed to be in charge of his own affairs,

392
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,720
but I haven't worked it like that.

393
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,600
But y'all are married.

394
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,080
Y'all are supposed to love each other.

395
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,080
I don't know about that anymore.

396
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,920
Hey, Ellis.

397
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,400
You're late.

398
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,480
Ellis?

399
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,730
Damn, boy, what you doin' out here?

400
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,960
I got you some Beanie Weenie.

401
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,730
I appreciate that.

402
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,880
But I didn't expect you out here at night.

403
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,090
Oh, look at that.

404
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,730
Boy, you really know how to do somebody right.

405
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,400
I wasn't gonna say nothin',

406
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,250
but it's pretty tough to make a meal out of pumpkin pie fillin'.

407
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,640
That's all my mom had.

408
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,570
Oh, I ain't complainin'.

409
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,280
Can I get one of those?

410
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,560
They're yours to begin with.

411
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
That's good, right?

412
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,200
You been out here too long.

413
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,890
The girl you're waitin' on,

414
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,450
she's your girlfriend?

415
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Juniper.

416
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Yeah.

417
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,810
How'd you meet her?

418
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,490
We grew up together.

419
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,840
You love her?

420
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
I do.

421
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,120
First time I saw her was on this river, just up from here.

422
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,960
She saved my life.

423
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,200
From the snake bite.

424
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,720
I was younger than you are right now.

425
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,760
When I came to in the hospital and she was there,

426
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,320
it was like the whole world just split wide open and

427
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,320
come back together new.

428
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,760
I knew from then on I'd do anything for her.

429
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,090
Why aren't y'all married then?

430
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,240
I've asked. Several times.

431
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Marriage

432
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,720
just don't work for some people.

433
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,040
My dad says

434
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,840
my parents might be getting a divorce.

435
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,560
I'm sorry to hear that.

436
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,080
They say if it happens, and my mom moves us off the river,

437
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
the government can come take our boat.

438
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,560
Who says that?

439
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,320
Everybody.

440
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,000
They passed a law.

441
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,000
I saw Juniper today.

442
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
What?

443
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,210
She had the birds tattooed on her hands.

444
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,040
Just like you said.

445
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,000
You're right.

446
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
She's pretty.

447
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,640
Where'd you see her?

448
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
At the Piggly Wiggly-

449
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,560
I think she's staying at a motel nearby there.

450
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,120
That's good news.

451
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,640
That's real good news.

452
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,280
She know you're out here?

453
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,320
No. No, we, uh...

454
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,490
We said we'd meet somewhere else, a couple days from now.

455
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,960
You wanna go tonight? I can take you up river.

456
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Tomorrow.

457
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,840
I'll go tomorrow.

458
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
You want me to come and get you?

459
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,280
No, I can manage.

460
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,610
Hell, I made it out here, didn't I?

461
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,320
It's a hell of a thing, ain't it?

462
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,810
It's a hell of a thing.

463
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Time to get up.

464
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,480
It's too early.

465
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,520
I'm going to Wal-Mart and I need you to come with me.

466
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,280
Mom.

467
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,600
Come on.

468
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,520
Ellis, I know what your father told you last night.

469
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,120
That's... That's not what I wanted.

470
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,800
I wanted to sit you down and talk about it.

471
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,320
What do you want to talk about?

472
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,010
You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house.

473
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,120
Well, I spent my whole life on that boat.

474
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,440
I don't think it's too much to ask...

475
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,010
Oh, no.

476
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Oh, I hope no one's hurt.

477
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,720
I'm just sayin' there are two sides to this.

478
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,360
You know, I haven't made up my mind yet,

479
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,840
because I wanted you to be involved with my decision.

480
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,200
But I need a change, Ellis.

481
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,200
I deserve one.

482
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,000
I think they're searching people.

483
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
How you doin' today, ma'am?

484
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,280
I'm all right, how are you?

485
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,190
I'm doin' just fine.

486
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,960
Have you seen or picked up any hitchhikers today?

487
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,120
No, sir.

488
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,080
Okay, could you open the back for me, please?

489
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,600
- It's open. - Okay.

490
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,450
Ma'am, have you seen this man?

491
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
No, sir.

492
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,360
Son, have you?

493
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
No.

494
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,160
Okay, well, there's been reports that he's in the area.

495
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,200
So if you see him, just call 9-1-1 for us, okay?

496
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,720
- Okay. - What'd he do?

497
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,280
What'd he do?

498
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,160
Move along, please.

499
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,040
Neck, Neck, pick up!

500
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,120
I knew it!

501
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,600
I told you that crazy son of a bitch was trouble.

502
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,120
Did you tell him where he is?

503
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,840
No, that's why I called you.

504
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,330
He needs to know people are looking for him.

505
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,200
You think he doesn't know that already?

506
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,280
Jesus, Ellis. Why do you even think he's on that island?

507
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,280
Ellis, I'm serious.

508
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,720
We don't know who this guy is.

509
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,010
He loves her, Neck. He told me.

510
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,890
I don't give a shit who he loves.

511
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,330
He's not dangerous.

512
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,120
It sounds like a shitload of state troopers thinks different.

513
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,240
No tellin' where the hell he's been sleepin'.

514
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,890
He might be gone already.

515
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Shit.

516
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,800
Sorry, boys, but I'm going

517
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,440
to have to go back on our deal for the boat.

518
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,640
I don't feel good about it, but I don't see any other way

519
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
out of what I'm into.

520
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,930
So you know about the state troopers?

521
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,000
What state troopers?

522
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,320
The ones spreadin' your picture all over the place.

523
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,960
Stoppin' cars on the 165, searching for your ass.

524
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,840
No, I don't know about that.

525
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,200
But it don't surprise me, I got a lot of folks lookin' for me.

526
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
Why?

527
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,040
I shot a man.

528
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,360
Killed him.

529
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,560
I'm sorry I didn't tell you boys sooner,

530
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,370
but I was hopin' to be long gone before anything came of it.

531
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,320
Didn't want y'all involved.

532
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,560
Look, y'all been real good to me.

533
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,080
You're the only friends I got out here.

534
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,880
If troopers got 165 blocked,

535
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,800
that means they got other roads blocked, too.

536
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,720
So I ain't goin' to get nowhere in a car.

537
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,320
I want to try getting this boat down.

538
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,200
See if we can get it in the water.

539
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,520
See, with a boat like this,

540
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,280
I can make it to the Gulf in two days.

541
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,680
Heck, from there, I can get anywhere.

542
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,240
But I need a boat at least this big to make it on the open water.

543
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,200
It's got no title, no owner,

544
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,800
nobody lookin' for it.

545
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,560
It's my best shot.

546
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,000
Who'd you kill?

547
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,000
Just a bad piece of business.

548
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,000
Y'all don't need to hear about it.

549
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,760
I need to hear about it.

550
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
Juniper, she...

551
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,120
She made a mistake.

552
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,280
Hooked up with this guy. He was no good.

553
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,080
His name was...

554
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,280
Hutchins. His family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas.

555
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,960
Where were you?

556
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,600
I was around, but me and Juniper was on the outs.

557
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,480
She met him, he sold her on a pack of lies, he got her pregnant.

558
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,200
That's when he started showin' who he really was.

559
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,330
He dropped her down a flight

560
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,320
of stairs after whoopin' her half to death.

561
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,800
She lost the baby, he made it so...

562
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,520
Doctors say she can't even have children no more.

563
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
There are things you can get away

564
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,160
with in this world and there are things you can't.

565
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,440
I tracked him down,

566
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,880
found him in a little motel outside of San Antonio, he was there

567
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,920
with another woman. That's...

568
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,680
That's where it happened.

569
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,490
So I understand if you boys don't want to help me no more.

570
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,840
But I need this boat.

571
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,440
And I need to get it into the water, fast.

572
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:27,840
I made a list of things we're going to need. What you think?

573
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,280
You did it for her?

574
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
To protect her?

575
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Yeah.

576
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
What you think?

577
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,600
I think you want us to run around, stickin' our necks out,

578
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,000
getting everything you need

579
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,720
just so you can take our boat.

580
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,160
That's about it.

581
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,400
What do we get out of it?

582
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,560
What you want?

583
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,280
What about that pistol?

584
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,680
Only two things I got out here worth anything.

585
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,560
This shirt.

586
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
And this pistol.

587
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,450
And I can't give you this shirt, 'cause I need it for protection.

588
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,880
But if you help me get this boat in the water, the pistol,

589
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,600
it's yours.

590
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,480
What kind is it?

591
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,720
A .45.

592
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,280
Got to get this boat floatin' first.

593
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,560
All right.

594
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,560
All right, y'all scrounge what you can off this list,

595
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,400
but if we're gonna do this right,

596
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,840
we're gonna need more help. Can you fetch Tom for me?

597
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,120
Tom Blankenship?

598
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,010
Yeah, I was hopin' to let that old assassin sit this one out.

599
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,760
We're gonna need him to get things that y'all can't.

600
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Can you find him?

601
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,760
I know where he lives, but I've never talked to him.

602
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,920
Just tell him my name, he'll know.

603
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,800
Hey, boys.

604
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,800
Thanks.

605
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,610
Don't lose my pistol.

606
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:31,520
You coming?

607
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,000
Nah, I'll watch the boat.

608
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,040
Why are you huntin' me?

609
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,050
Are you deaf, boy? I said why are you huntin' me?

610
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,120
I ain't huntin' you.

611
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,560
What's your business here?

612
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I come to find you.

613
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:39,600
I got a message for you.

614
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,250
You Senior's boy?

615
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,360
Yes, sir.

616
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,600
What you got to say to me that he can't tell me himself?

617
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,040
It ain't from him.

618
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,600
Mud sent me.

619
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,880
Mud?

620
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,680
Yes, sir.

621
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:02,960
What you know about him?

622
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,080
He told me to come find you.

623
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,200
Your daddy know about this?

624
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,080
No, sir.

625
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,090
Mud needs your help.

626
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,400
Where is he?

627
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,600
There he is.

628
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,680
You think that's his daddy?

629
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
I don't know.

630
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,680
Sir.

631
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,250
Where is she?

632
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,320
In town.

633
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,080
Got here yesterday.

634
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,960
What are you doing out here like this, Mud?

635
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,480
I killed that last man she was with, Tom.

636
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,650
He had it comin', too.

637
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,920
You have been doggin' this girl your whole life.

638
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,520
She's run you halfway across the country and back.

639
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,120
And for what? For this!

640
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,600
Be stuck out here on this island like this!

641
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,120
Beggin'!

642
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,840
A murderer now! A thief!

643
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,000
I ain't no thief, Tom...

644
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,200
No? What would you call it then?

645
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,040
Not to mention draggin' these boys into this...

646
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Man, he's really giving it to him.

647
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,960
You got any idea what you're doin'?

648
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,400
I'm right ashamed of you, Mud.

649
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,880
Don't expect any help from me, 'cause there's none to be given.

650
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
All right, I'm ready.

651
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,480
Where you goin'?

652
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,080
God damn it.

653
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,960
You all right?

654
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,170
Looks like we're on our own, Ellis.

655
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,450
I didn't want to have to ask you to be the one to do this,

656
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:19,400
but I need to get this letter to Juniper.

657
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,720
Can you take it to her for me?

658
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:23,280
Yeah.

659
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,120
All right, now listen up.

660
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,840
You got to be careful, all right? You can't just

661
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,360
walk up and knock on her door. You hear me?

662
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,600
You gotta watch yourself.

663
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,400
I can handle it.

664
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,520
Get that to her.

665
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,640
All right.

666
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,610
All right.

667
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,000
Watch yourself, Ellis.

668
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,840
You Mud's daddy?

669
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,280
Mud don't have no daddy.

670
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,800
No mama either, as far as I could tell.

671
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,800
He was livin' in the woods when I first met him.

672
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,170
Younger than you are now.

673
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,920
You boys need to watch yourselves now.

674
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,520
What Mud's into is somethin' you don't want to be involved in.

675
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,360
You best forget about him, you hear?

676
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,720
Which one?

677
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,280
Let's start at the top.

678
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,360
Work our way down.

679
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
All right.

680
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,200
What you want?

681
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,400
We're sellin' fish. Would you like to buy some?

682
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,600
Fish? I don't want to buy no damn fish.

683
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,600
Keep lyin' and I'll crack your nose open!

684
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,560
Keep lyin'!

685
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,880
You hear me, trash? Where is that guy?

686
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,010
Who are you?

687
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,280
Who the hell are you?

688
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,960
He send you?

689
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,480
You know this man?

690
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,480
Look at it! Do you know this man?

691
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,120
Fish! Fish! We're just sellin' fish!

692
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,200
Fish...

693
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,720
I know you know where he is.

694
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,360
And I swear to God,

695
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,840
I'll cut a hole through every one of you to find him.

696
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,160
We know you came here for him,

697
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,190
and we know he's too stupid

698
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,320
to leave here without you.

699
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,760
So whenever he sticks his head up

700
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,520
out of whatever shithole he's hidin' in,

701
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,730
I'm gonna be there.

702
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,530
You tell him that.

703
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,360
You need to mind your business, boy.

704
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,600
You Okay?

705
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,880
Yeah.

706
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,450
Man, he popped your eye.

707
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,600
Let me see your face.

708
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,160
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

709
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,520
Here, hold this on there.

710
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:25,920
Thank you.

711
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,080
I'll buy your fish, okay?

712
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,080
How much do you want for the whole cooler?

713
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,920
Mud sent us to give you this.

714
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,720
You know Mud?

715
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,160
Yeah, we know him.

716
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
Says, "Hold tight."

717
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,840
We know, we read it.

718
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,920
Well, do you know how long hold tight is?

719
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,410
I think it's just a couple days.

720
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,330
He wants to get a boat for you all.

721
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,680
God...

722
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,360
Tell him I'll wait.

723
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,170
But I don't want you all getting involved.

724
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,290
So you tell him what I said and let that be it.

725
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,050
I don't want you getting in any trouble.

726
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,400
We'll be all right. Just keep your door locked.

727
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,480
We'll be in touch.

728
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,000
Wait.

729
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,480
What's your name?

730
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,800
I'm Ellis, he's Neckbone.

731
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,560
Thank you, Ellis.

732
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
We gotta go.

733
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,400
Let's go, hard on.

734
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,280
Hello? Is May Pearl there?

735
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,090
Hey, it's Ellis.

736
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,040
In the phone book.

737
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:28,480
Tomorrow?

738
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:30,890
Yeah, I can meet you.

739
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,930
Okay. Bye.

740
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,960
We got more, but no motor.

741
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,400
This will work for now.

742
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,240
Ellis, you get her my note?

743
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:56,800
Yeah.

744
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,840
Where'd you get that shiner from?

745
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,560
When we came up on Juniper's room,

746
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:07,680
there was this guy in there, he was beating up on her.

747
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,130
Ellis rushed him.

748
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,530
Got smacked for it.

749
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,120
What'd he look like?

750
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,480
I don't know,

751
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,400
he was tall.

752
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,170
Looked like a cowboy.

753
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,600
Light hair slicked back?

754
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,120
Yeah.

755
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,840
Thank you for looking after her.

756
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,160
His name's Carver,

757
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:08,000
he's the brother of the man I killed.

758
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,160
If he's here, there's plenty more coming.

759
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,120
More what?

760
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,850
Bounty hunters. Carver's rotten,

761
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,040
but his old man,

762
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,000
that's the one to be scared of.

763
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,050
He'll spend every dime he's got to make sure I'm dead.

764
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:25,450
If it was up to me,

765
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,920
I'd lay the whole family down, same as the other.

766
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,200
Aren't a decent man between them.

767
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
Now, look here.

768
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,970
Listen to me,

769
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,040
if you see that old man, don't you go near him.

770
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,360
He's the triple six real deal scratch.

771
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,160
What's a scratch?

772
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,480
It's the devil himself.

773
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,040
Let's unload the rest of this, get it up top.

774
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,760
Now, what are you waiting for?

775
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,080
Shut up.

776
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,490
All right, Ellis.

777
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,280
Can you climb that trunk,

778
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,840
- choke this off that limb? - Yeah.

779
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,800
Tie it in a bowline knot, you know it?

780
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,000
I'm not stupid.

781
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,480
Neck, I need you to start cutting line

782
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,860
in 15 two-foot pieces.

783
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:35,720
Count two foot as long as your arm.

784
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,330
Be careful.

785
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,700
What's so special about that shirt

786
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,370
you'd lose your pistol for it?

787
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,800
It's got a wolf's eye sewn into the sleeve.

788
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,000
More protection than a bullet ever gave.

789
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:54,770
Tom swears by it.

790
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,040
Tom said he wasn't your daddy.

791
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,080
He's the closest thing to a father I've ever had.

792
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,120
I never met my parents.

793
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,560
It's hard,

794
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:07,360
not knowing those you came from.

795
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,360
My Uncle Galen tells me things about them.

796
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,520
He's the one that takes care of me.

797
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,720
Yeah. Tom did that for me.

798
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:17,280
What'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin?

799
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,840
Tom's had lives you'd never even know about.

800
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,320
Grew up, up North. Went to Yale.

801
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,160
For a long time, he was a paid assassin for the CIA.

802
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,320
Lived in Cuba in '63. Shoot,

803
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:32,240
he's killed more people than you all probably ever met.

804
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:34,760
Neck, how's that line coming?

805
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,240
If you're gonna do it, do it!

806
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,440
This shit's crazy.

807
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,680
One down.

808
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:38,760
Come on.

809
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,640
Wanna sit down?

810
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,640
Hey, you must really like to fight.

811
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,640
Not really.

812
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,280
You got a lot of friends.

813
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:09,920
They're all right.

814
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,840
I don't know all of them.

815
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,320
I bet you're pretty popular.

816
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,000
Why do you say that?

817
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:19,880
Because you're nice to people.

818
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:21,720
How do you know that?

819
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,520
You're nice to me.

820
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,400
But I like you.

821
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,250
I got you something.

822
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,960
A bracelet?

823
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,240
Yeah.

824
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,480
Neckbone's uncle finds them in the river

825
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,490
and collects the pearls,

826
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:44,290
and I thought with your name and everything...

827
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,360
Thank you.

828
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,520
You wanna be my girlfriend?

829
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,960
You've been seeing Mud?

830
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,440
No.

831
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,050
You don't have to lie to me, boy.

832
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,840
I've seen you running around, taking things.

833
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,520
He all right?

834
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,120
He's okay.

835
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,130
He called you an assassin.

836
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,410
How long have you known Mud?

837
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:35,960
A few days.

838
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:40,200
That's long enough to know he's full of shit.

839
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:43,640
So, it's not true?

840
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,240
I was a sharpshooter for a while in the Marines.

841
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:49,940
In Mud's world, that's an assassin.

842
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,640
But it's not exactly true, right?

843
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:53,560
Yeah, I guess.

844
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,000
Assassin.

845
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,000
You think he's a badass, don't you?

846
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,160
I don't know.

847
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,880
You know why he's stuck off on that island?

848
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,840
Yeah.

849
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:17,000
He shot somebody.

850
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,760
You know why he shot that man?

851
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,840
Because he hurt Juniper?

852
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,800
Right.

853
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,660
The real reason Mud's in

854
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,370
all the trouble he's got is because of her.

855
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,400
He's been in love with that girl since he was your age.

856
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,070
Trouble is she don't care about nobody but herself.

857
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:44,360
I've told him as much.

858
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,880
She'd bed down with the meanest snake she could find,

859
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,080
and then when things got bad, she'd go running back to Mud.

860
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,480
He'd take her back.

861
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,540
Then he'd go find

862
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,970
whatever unlucky son of a bitch laid a hand on her

863
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:05,250
and beat him so bad he'd know never to touch her again.

864
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,160
Only this time, I guess

865
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,320
he figured beating wasn't good enough,

866
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,960
he had to go shoot that feller.

867
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,840
I'm not for sure,

868
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,600
but I'd put money on it that she knew he'd do it.

869
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,760
She might even put him up to it.

870
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,240
Either way, those two are set for failure.

871
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,280
The only chance he's got is to cut her loose.

872
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:43,280
That'll never happen.

873
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,310
But I tell you what, Mud's no badass.

874
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:46,690
He's running scared right now...

875
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,120
I've got to go.

876
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,170
You're wrong about Juniper.

877
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,530
They love each other and they're going to make it.

878
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:01,160
If you weren't such a worn out old man, you'd know it was true.

879
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,920
What do you say, Ellis?

880
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,160
I got more stuff.

881
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:36,200
Yeah? Did you find a motor?

882
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:37,680
Not yet.

883
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,760
What's that?

884
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:44,440
Bonfire's my all-purpose cure all for bad luck.

885
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:48,440
I don't know where this boat's been

886
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,370
or what kind of person the owner was before me.

887
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:53,260
For all I know,

888
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,400
there could be some serious bad business left on it.

889
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,960
We got too much riding on this thing to leave to chance.

890
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,000
Tom called me over to his place this morning.

891
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:03,160
What did he say?

892
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,720
He was running down Juniper.

893
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,360
Told him he was a worn out old man.

894
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,010
And he couldn't know how much you love her.

895
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:12,280
You don't know his story.

896
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:13,360
I don't care.

897
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:15,400
You should.

898
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,680
Tom loved a woman more than most men can in two lifetimes.

899
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,240
They had a good life started together.

900
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:27,610
She was pregnant with a little boy,

901
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,360
birth got the best of them.

902
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,200
Tom's been alone ever since.

903
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,680
Lone wolf.

904
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,200
Thanks for the tin.

905
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,480
This shit never gets easy.

906
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,200
That's a good haul.

907
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,210
I've had worse.

908
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,610
You doing all right?

909
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:48,440
Yeah.

910
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:52,760
Do you need to tell me anything?

911
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,640
Tell you what?

912
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,160
I know I'm just your uncle, not a parent.

913
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,040
But you can tell me things if you need to.

914
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,840
I can tell you this helmet smells like my duck butter.

915
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,040
Where'd you get that black eye?

916
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,480
A kid in town. He got his, too.

917
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,530
What was you all fighting for?

918
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,480
About this girl.

919
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,760
What girl?

920
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:35,400
My girlfriend.

921
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,040
You got a girlfriend?

922
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,000
Yes, sir.

923
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,560
When did that happen?

924
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,040
Other day.

925
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,680
What's her name?

926
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,240
May Pearl.

927
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,520
May Pearl.

928
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,520
Two first names, just like your mother.

929
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,640
Have you seen your mother today?

930
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,200
No.

931
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:04,720
You're not talking to me now?

932
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,320
I'm talking. I'm talking to both of you.

933
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:09,000
All you all want to do is talk.

934
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,560
That's your mother now.

935
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:13,880
She'd rather tongue lash a problem than step up and handle it.

936
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:16,160
You'll see one day.

937
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,160
Women are tough, boy.

938
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,720
They set you up for things.

939
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,200
You can't trust love, Ellis.

940
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,800
If you're not careful, it'll up and run out on you.

941
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,880
Daddy, this is Miller. He's one of ours.

942
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:56,720
Appreciate your help.

943
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:57,800
Yes, sir.

944
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,730
We'll be in, in a minute.

945
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,160
Catch me up.

946
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,080
We're working in shifts.

947
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,920
Got two outside her motel.

948
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,800
The others are either out searching or sleeping here.

949
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,320
I met the county sheriff, but he wasn't much help.

950
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,290
Said they handle their own business.

951
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:21,600
But I got two of his people on payroll

952
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,240
and a person inside at the state police.

953
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,480
Ellis, let's go, boy. Come on.

954
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,160
Okay.

955
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:37,690
Let's meet the men.

956
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,760
Yes, sir.

957
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,480
Shit.

958
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:00,800
Get up.

959
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:02,600
You all pay attention.

960
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,850
This is my father, King.

961
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,440
He runs the show.

962
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:10,080
Men.

963
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:20,480
All right, everybody up.

964
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,920
Gather around.

965
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,040
Now form a circle.

966
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:30,200
Everybody, take a knee.

967
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,130
Want you to join hands.

968
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:40,250
We're gonna pray for the death of the man who killed my son.

969
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,290
Everybody, bow your heads.

970
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,960
You touch her titty?

971
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,080
A little.

972
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,440
That's great, man.

973
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,010
Thanks.

974
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,440
We could take it apart, bring it out piece by piece.

975
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,360
It's welded, we'd just tear it up.

976
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,360
What if we float it out?

977
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,440
With what?

978
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,250
Come on.

979
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,890
Oh, Jesus!

980
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:11,600
What do you think?

981
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,200
That's great, Galen.

982
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,810
Come here, Ellis.

983
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:38,610
See that ceiling fan up there?

984
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,130
I found it in the river.

985
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:44,640
Works great.

986
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,480
Best ceiling fan I've ever owned.

987
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,520
This river brings a lot of trash down it.

988
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,400
Some of that trash is worth a lot of money.

989
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,600
Some of it's not.

990
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:00,930
You got to know what's worth keepin' and what's worth lettin' go.

991
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,490
You know the difference?

992
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,480
I think so.

993
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,480
Neck looks up to you.

994
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,840
Don't get my nephew into anything you can't get him out of. Okay?

995
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,040
Help Me, Rhonda's just about a guy needin'

996
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,010
to get a piece to get over a girl that put one over on him.

997
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,240
So, you get your heart broke?

998
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,200
Don't walk around with a shit look on your face.

999
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,930
Get back in there, get your tip wet.

1000
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:39,160
You hear me?

1001
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,370
- You know what I'm sayin'. - Let's go.

1002
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,950
Want to hang out? Allen's comin' over,

1003
01:19:44,950 --> 01:19:45,680
we're going to pump it up.

1004
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:47,280
No. We got stuff to do.

1005
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:49,400
Whatever.

1006
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,720
What were y'all talking about?

1007
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,770
I don't know.

1008
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,570
King! That's what they call him.

1009
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,570
Y'all didn't go near him, did ya?

1010
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,120
No.

1011
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,160
Good.

1012
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,480
How we lookin' on that motor?

1013
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,400
There's one in the scrap yard that might work.

1014
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,640
We're gonna need one that runs.

1015
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,590
I can get it runnin'. Tell him, Ellis.

1016
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:11,280
Let's pull this.

1017
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:13,920
It's true, he built his own dirt bike.

1018
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,120
Little more.

1019
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:18,730
Neck, take a shot at it.

1020
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,680
I don't know, that motor's worth somethin'.

1021
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,090
It's not like all the rest of that junk.

1022
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,240
It's been there for months. Nobody will even know it's gone.

1023
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,400
Ellis.

1024
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:29,640
We need a motor.

1025
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:52,440
Winds out of the west at 22 miles per hour...

1026
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,160
Hello?

1027
01:20:58,280 --> 01:20:59,280
Juniper?

1028
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:00,400
Ellis.

1029
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,600
Hey, it's me.

1030
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,120
Thank God. I'm goin' crazy in this room.

1031
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:06,840
Is Mud okay?

1032
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:09,120
Yeah, it's time to take you out to him.

1033
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:10,960
Now?

1034
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,800
Tomorrow.

1035
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,200
Tomorrow, we'll come get you.

1036
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,610
He's got a plan for y'all to get away.

1037
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,040
Be ready tomorrow at 5:00.

1038
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,640
Neckbone'll be waitin' at the side of the motel with a dirt bike.

1039
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,570
Wait, just...

1040
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,240
Just wait a minute. I don't know about all that.

1041
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,800
Where does he think we're gonna go?

1042
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,130
What are we even gonna do?

1043
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,920
This is Mud, this is exactly what he does.

1044
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:36,760
It's okay.

1045
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:37,960
It's a good plan.

1046
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,480
Just be ready.

1047
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,160
Why are you doing this?

1048
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,520
What do you mean?

1049
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,160
Why are you helping us?

1050
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,840
Because y'all love each other.

1051
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,240
I'll see you tomorrow.

1052
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,600
Wait.

1053
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,680
- How'd it go? - We're good.

1054
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,800
Give me a quarter.

1055
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:13,920
May Pearl!

1056
01:22:15,720 --> 01:22:16,720
May Pearl!

1057
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,160
It's all right, man, she's with her family.

1058
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,040
Come on, I want to get that motor before dark.

1059
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,530
Y'all remember me, don't ya?

1060
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,120
Sorry about that.

1061
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,080
You caught me at a real bad time.

1062
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Hold on a second.

1063
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:56,280
Just a sec.

1064
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,000
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

1065
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,520
Y'all were just doin' a job and I got in the way.

1066
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:06,400
What do you say I buy a whole batch of fish y'all were sellin'?

1067
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:08,680
Forty cover it?

1068
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,200
That'll about do it.

1069
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,760
We don't want your money.

1070
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,370
Hold on. Hold on.

1071
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,760
Y'all get around, don't you?

1072
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,410
Bet ya know every

1073
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,920
hole and ditch in this town.

1074
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,650
You haven't come across that man whose picture I showed you?

1075
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:31,720
Have you?

1076
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,080
Sure about that?

1077
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:40,360
Take a look with your good eye.

1078
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,400
I'm sure.

1079
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,760
What about that girl from the motel?

1080
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,010
The pretty one.

1081
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,720
Talk to her some more?

1082
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:55,960
There's a number on there.

1083
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,970
Let me know if you do.

1084
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,720
This is it. This is it.

1085
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,080
All right, it's loose.

1086
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Shit's heavy.

1087
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:34,400
Shit!

1088
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:35,810
Was she there?

1089
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,450
No.

1090
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,960
Come on.

1091
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,200
Excuse me, sir.

1092
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,680
What?

1093
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,280
We're lookin' for the girl in room 210.

1094
01:26:52,290 --> 01:26:52,960
You seen her?

1095
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,560
Yeah, I've seen her.

1096
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:55,800
You seen her today?

1097
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,250
Yeah, she came down here lookin' for a bar nearby.

1098
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:01,480
Sent her up to that place off 61.

1099
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,400
Just leave it there, Mud's going to have to help us with it.

1100
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,560
What are you going to tell him?

1101
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,240
I'll just tell him the truth.

1102
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:33,280
Hey, what you say there, Ellis?

1103
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,840
Tom left this for you.

1104
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:49,560
Where's Juniper?

1105
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:55,320
Ellis, what happened?

1106
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,290
Is she okay?

1107
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,160
Was it Carver?

1108
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,480
It wasn't Carver.

1109
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:04,840
What's goin' on, Ellis?

1110
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,800
She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel.

1111
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,320
She never showed up.

1112
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:15,960
We went around looking for her.

1113
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,320
Motel clerk said she went out to a bar on 61.

1114
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:24,920
We tracked her down.

1115
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,000
She was there with another guy.

1116
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,000
They were together.

1117
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,200
She must've thought Carver

1118
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:47,850
was onto her.

1119
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,890
She knew the plan, Mud.

1120
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,450
She just didn't show up.

1121
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,680
What was she doin' with that guy?

1122
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:05,600
What was she doin' with that guy, Ellis?

1123
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,490
They were playing pool.

1124
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:12,210
And they were drinkin'.

1125
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:13,880
And laughin'.

1126
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,050
He was close up on her.

1127
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,880
He kissed her neck.

1128
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:39,920
So that's how it is, huh?

1129
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,240
We got that motor.

1130
01:31:50,320 --> 01:31:51,920
What do you want us to do?

1131
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:55,040
Just go home, Ellis.

1132
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,400
Hello?

1133
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,880
Is May Pearl there?

1134
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,080
This is Ellis.

1135
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:09,560
I called yesterday, you didn't give her my messages?

1136
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:11,600
I said it's Ellis.

1137
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,840
I'm her boyfriend.

1138
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,200
- Oh, she's asleep... - Mary Lee!

1139
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,600
Mary Lee!

1140
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,760
What the hell have you been doin'?

1141
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,800
What have you been doin'?

1142
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:21,080
Senior, damn it! Damn it! Stop it!

1143
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,360
You tell her what you've been doin'.

1144
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,520
I don't know what you're sayin'.

1145
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,600
Take your hands off him, Senior!

1146
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,690
J.J. Crawford said

1147
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:28,570
a boat motor went missin' from his stockyard!

1148
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:32,320
He said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin' it off!

1149
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:36,160
Now, you tell me, right now, did you steal that motor?

1150
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:37,360
We didn't steal it.

1151
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,170
You lie to me again.

1152
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,880
We thought it was junk.

1153
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:44,400
We didn't think it was worth anything.

1154
01:33:44,480 --> 01:33:45,480
Ellis?

1155
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,600
You tellin' me I raised a thief?

1156
01:33:50,840 --> 01:33:51,880
I'm not a thief.

1157
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:54,120
You take property that's not yours,

1158
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,880
property that belongs to another man.

1159
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,680
That junk was his livelihood.

1160
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:02,560
- I'm ashamed of you! - Senior...

1161
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:03,760
Shut your mouth.

1162
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,240
You think you can take things and not have him see it?

1163
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,720
Neither one of you's got any respect for a man's livelihood!

1164
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,760
A life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach!

1165
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:17,520
Don't you blame this on me.

1166
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:20,520
One doesn't have a thing to do with the other and you know it.

1167
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:22,640
You don't tell me what I know.

1168
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,800
If you can steal a man's life out from under him

1169
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,650
and think he won't take a lesson from that,

1170
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:29,000
then you're dumber than you look.

1171
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,640
- Stop it, Dad! - And she's raisin' you

1172
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:32,760
a snake, just like herself.

1173
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:35,840
And you can curl up beside her before I give a goddamn!

1174
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,960
But you just remember this, boy.

1175
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,560
You just remember, when they

1176
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,840
come in here and they tear this place apart

1177
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,920
board by board! You hear me?

1178
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:49,190
You are a man who's never

1179
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:51,480
had the strength to support his own life.

1180
01:34:55,760 --> 01:34:56,760
Ellis.

1181
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,080
You'll return that motor from where you found it,

1182
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,440
and you'll apologize in person to the man you took it from.

1183
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:09,520
I won't hear about anything like this again.

1184
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:31,320
I can't take that motor back.

1185
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,880
But I can pay him for it.

1186
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,210
I'll give him what he wants.

1187
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,880
I don't care what you do, Ellis.

1188
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:54,320
What the hell's all this?

1189
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:56,160
It's a bonfire.

1190
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,160
I guess he didn't care about bein' seen.

1191
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,040
He had something else on his mind.

1192
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:39,130
What you all hidin' for?

1193
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:07,440
Found your shirt.

1194
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:11,360
You can keep it.

1195
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:16,080
I don't need it no more.

1196
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,040
Saw what's left of your bonfire.

1197
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:26,850
Somebody could have seen you.

1198
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:29,680
I guess.

1199
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:32,970
Do some drinkin' last night?

1200
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,880
I did a lot of drinkin' last night.

1201
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:40,120
Neck, I'm gonna need you to stay here and get this motor runnin'.

1202
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,760
Ellis, I need you to do somethin' else for me.

1203
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,970
I need you to get that to Juniper.

1204
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:48,600
Okay, Mud.

1205
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:51,680
Neck, let's go.

1206
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,360
You still takin' Juniper?

1207
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:01,680
Neck, fetch me that socket wrench.

1208
01:38:12,160 --> 01:38:13,520
You be all right?

1209
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,520
Yeah. How about you?

1210
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:17,640
He'll be okay.

1211
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,680
Can I borrow your bike?

1212
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:21,760
Yeah.

1213
01:38:23,320 --> 01:38:24,650
Don't tump it.

1214
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,560
I was wonderin' when I'd see you.

1215
01:39:16,040 --> 01:39:17,450
Sorry about last night.

1216
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,040
I'm supposed to give this to you.

1217
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:20,640
What?

1218
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,200
Okay.

1219
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,400
Did you read it?

1220
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,080
No.

1221
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:35,720
I gotta go.

1222
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:37,040
Ellis.

1223
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,800
I said I was sorry.

1224
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:42,810
All you had to do was be there.

1225
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,880
I couldn't.

1226
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,080
Then why'd you even come here?

1227
01:39:47,560 --> 01:39:49,440
I came here to leave with him.

1228
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I did.

1229
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,960
You know you don't know him, right?

1230
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:02,800
I know he'd do anything for you.

1231
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,600
Is that what you think?

1232
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:09,970
Mud's a born liar.

1233
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:12,670
That's why people like him,

1234
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:15,080
he makes them feel good about themselves.

1235
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:24,610
I do love him.

1236
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,520
I just

1237
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,600
can't spend the rest of my life runnin' away with him.

1238
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:55,250
Tell him I understand.

1239
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:58,520
What's it say?

1240
01:41:00,640 --> 01:41:02,320
Says, "It's over."

1241
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,760
Bye, Ellis.

1242
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,650
Did you get my phone calls?

1243
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:35,320
- What? - I've been tryin' to call you.

1244
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,140
Who's this guy?

1245
01:42:36,140 --> 01:42:37,800
Get your head out of my car, kid.

1246
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:40,160
- Ellis! - I called you twice!

1247
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,770
Stop it, Kyle!

1248
01:42:44,040 --> 01:42:45,240
Stop it!

1249
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:46,480
Kyle!

1250
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,440
Stop it, Kyle!

1251
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,560
God!

1252
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:55,600
What the hell you doin' here, Ellis?

1253
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:56,760
What?

1254
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,880
You can't just run up and punch people I'm with.

1255
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:04,520
I'm sorry, I just wanted to know why you hadn't called me back.

1256
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:08,400
Why would I call you back, Ellis?

1257
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:10,920
Because you're my girlfriend.

1258
01:43:12,920 --> 01:43:14,120
I'm not your girlfriend.

1259
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,040
We've been on one date.

1260
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:17,200
One.

1261
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,960
Yeah, but...

1262
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,440
But what? What'd you expect, Ellis?

1263
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,880
I love you.

1264
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:30,720
You're 14.

1265
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:38,640
I don't know. He's just this kid.

1266
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:41,480
Come on, let's...

1267
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:50,720
Try it now.

1268
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:53,200
Nothin'.

1269
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:56,010
Son of a bitch.

1270
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:07,840
What she say?

1271
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:09,490
You're a liar!

1272
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,360
Makin' two kids run around, doin' all the work

1273
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:14,680
because you're too scared to do it yourself!

1274
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:19,440
Makin' me tell her it's over because you're too scared!

1275
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,200
You said you loved her and you lied!

1276
01:44:24,240 --> 01:44:26,440
You gave up on her, and she gave up on you!

1277
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,090
Just like everybody else!

1278
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:31,330
I trusted you!

1279
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,720
Bonfires and crosses and wolf's eye... Bullshit!

1280
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,530
Now, come on, Ellis.

1281
01:44:38,600 --> 01:44:41,280
Every single thing you told me was a lie!

1282
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:45,690
You never cared about her, and you never cared about us!

1283
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,760
Not enough to matter!

1284
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:52,640
You used us.

1285
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,360
You made me a thief!

1286
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:00,360
Let me talk to him.

1287
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:03,480
Ellis!

1288
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:10,040
Ellis, come on!

1289
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,970
Ellis, wait a minute.

1290
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,200
Ellis!

1291
01:45:26,080 --> 01:45:27,240
Shit.

1292
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:29,680
Mud!

1293
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,920
Ellis! He fell in the creek!

1294
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:35,480
He fell into the snakes!

1295
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,160
Mud, please!

1296
01:46:05,120 --> 01:46:06,800
Get the motor started, Neck!

1297
01:46:11,640 --> 01:46:13,240
Is he okay? Is he bit?

1298
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,040
Shit.

1299
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:24,680
What time is it?

1300
01:46:25,560 --> 01:46:26,920
What time is it?

1301
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,690
4:18!

1302
01:46:30,320 --> 01:46:32,720
Yell it out every 10 minutes.

1303
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:33,960
Okay.

1304
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,600
Is he going to be okay?

1305
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,530
Got to get him to the clinic.

1306
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,250
Are you bit?

1307
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:49,840
No.

1308
01:47:07,320 --> 01:47:09,080
My bike's up there!

1309
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,400
Need some help here!

1310
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:44,560
Snake bite!

1311
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,050
- It's a snake bite! - Stay calm.

1312
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,570
Cottonmouth.

1313
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,480
Just under an hour.

1314
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:52,690
Okay, we'll take care of him.

1315
01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:53,920
Let's go! Let's go, people.

1316
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:10,920
Sir.

1317
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,760
We're going to need some information from you.

1318
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:21,560
Sir.

1319
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:29,600
Sir!

1320
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:49,760
Hello?

1321
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:42,520
It's okay.

1322
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:44,880
Just sit back.

1323
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:50,840
Where am I?

1324
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:52,640
You're home.

1325
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,240
We brought you home.

1326
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,520
Come on, sit up.

1327
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:00,600
Come on.

1328
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,370
You had us scared, son.

1329
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:12,440
I'm so glad you're okay.

1330
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,280
The doctors gave you some medicine.

1331
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,120
You had a snake bite.

1332
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:20,520
How did I get to the doctor?

1333
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,090
A man brought you in.

1334
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:24,450
No one knew him.

1335
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,080
Oh, no, no, it's all right.

1336
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,680
You just rest now. We'll talk about it later.

1337
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:35,480
Do you need anything? Are you hungry?

1338
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:37,360
No.

1339
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,160
Come on, let him get some rest.

1340
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:49,040
I'll be back in to check on you.

1341
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:01,640
Mom? Dad?

1342
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:04,680
I love you.

1343
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:07,440
We love you, too, Ellis.

1344
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:51,400
The sun does shine on a dog's ass some days, huh?

1345
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,400
It ain't sunk yet.

1346
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,080
Wish Ellis could see it.

1347
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
I know.

1348
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,240
Well...

1349
01:53:05,320 --> 01:53:07,400
Looks like you get your end of the deal.

1350
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:13,640
Where's the bullets?

1351
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,000
Deal was for the gun, not the bullets.

1352
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:18,760
Shit.

1353
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:21,080
Yeah.

1354
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,650
Neck, I've got one more favor I want to ask of you.

1355
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,080
Mud?

1356
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:06,600
Don't get up.

1357
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,040
How'd you get here?

1358
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,080
Neck brought me.

1359
01:54:28,840 --> 01:54:30,280
We got the boat in the water.

1360
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:31,880
- You did? - Yeah.

1361
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,120
Smooth sailing from here on out.

1362
01:54:40,360 --> 01:54:41,920
Wouldn't have felt right leavin' town

1363
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,480
without comin' to say goodbye.

1364
01:54:47,560 --> 01:54:48,920
I'm sorry about what I said.

1365
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:51,170
No, you were right to be mad.

1366
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:52,960
You were right about a lot of things.

1367
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:56,920
I don't traffic in the truth too often, but

1368
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:00,690
I did love her.

1369
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:03,160
I do

1370
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,210
love her.

1371
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:08,680
She loves you, too.

1372
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:10,160
She said it.

1373
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,250
Yeah, I just made mistakes.

1374
01:55:14,260 --> 01:55:16,000
Heck, we both did, you know.

1375
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:18,760
It's a hard life to keep up with,

1376
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:22,480
can't blame her for gettin' tired of tryin'.

1377
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:28,160
My dad says you can't count on women loving you.

1378
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,840
He said you can't trust them.

1379
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:35,810
That's not true.

1380
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,200
You're a good man, Ellis.

1381
01:55:43,320 --> 01:55:44,870
You meet a girl half as good as you,

1382
01:55:44,870 --> 01:55:46,130
you're going to be all right.

1383
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,680
You're a good man, too, Mud.

1384
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:55,280
No.

1385
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,000
No, I ain't, Ellis.

1386
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:01,650
Maybe from here on out, I can...

1387
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,440
Stay put.

1388
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:16,200
Ellis!

1389
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,880
Ellis!

1390
01:56:19,960 --> 01:56:21,370
Don't move.

1391
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Mud!

1392
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,040
Let him go.

1393
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:03,000
You still down there, buddy?

1394
01:57:03,120 --> 01:57:05,240
- Yeah. - All right, stay put.

1395
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,640
Flush him out this way.

1396
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:08,640
Mud!

1397
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:14,000
Mud!

1398
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:23,640
Mud!

1399
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,480
Mud!

1400
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,400
- Mud! - Ellis!

1401
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:32,720
Ellis!

1402
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,360
Ellis. Ellis.

1403
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,200
It's okay.

1404
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:00,680
Hello?

1405
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,490
You're speaking to him.

1406
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,960
He's dead?

1407
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:47,560
You got your bike back?

1408
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,720
Yeah.

1409
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:51,090
Mud dinged the shit out of it.

1410
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:57,410
They're really doing it.

1411
02:02:00,640 --> 02:02:01,970
It's the law.

1412
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:04,360
It's bullshit.

1413
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:08,360
They ever find Tom?

1414
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:11,360
No. He's gone.

1415
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:15,520
I heard on the news,

1416
02:02:17,600 --> 02:02:19,360
they still hadn't found Mud's body.

1417
02:02:21,240 --> 02:02:22,600
You think he's dead?

1418
02:02:25,120 --> 02:02:26,120
I don't know.

1419
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:27,760
I hope not.

1420
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:33,450
I gotta go.

1421
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:35,920
Come by the apartments later, help me fix up my room.

1422
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:37,000
All right.

1423
02:03:54,120 --> 02:03:55,120
I'll see you next week?

1424
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:57,600
You betcha.

1425
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:03,880
Ellis.

1426
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:06,330
You mind your mother, okay?

1427
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:08,210
This is a big change for her, too.

1428
02:04:09,320 --> 02:04:10,680
She's gonna need your support.

1429
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:12,600
Yes, sir.

1430
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
All right.

1431
02:04:20,360 --> 02:04:21,360
I love you.

1432
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:27,320
I love you, too.

1433
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:10,610
Come on, son.

1434
02:06:11,640 --> 02:06:13,000
You gotta see this.
