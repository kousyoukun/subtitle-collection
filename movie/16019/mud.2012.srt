1
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:15,574
I'm comin' out now.

2
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,426
I'm tired,
I want something different.

3
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,728
I just want to have
a conversation.

4
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,265
I just want to
talk about it.

5
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,847
Shit.

6
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,182
What the shit, man?

7
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,383
Suck it! Drive.

8
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,787
How old is she?

9
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,523
A junior.

10
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,392
She's got nice titties.
You talk to her?

11
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,660
No.

12
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,328
You're gonna
have to talk to her.

13
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,233
Remind me when we get back to my house.

14
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,235
I think Galen's
got a book on that.

15
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:26,572
Shit.

16
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:32,244
Your dad would kill us if
he knew we went out there.

17
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,979
I'm not worried
about my dad killin' us.

18
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,486
We need to move if
we're gonna make it back.

19
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,223
Set your watch, we
need a good 15 minutes.

20
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,990
There it is!

21
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,733
Galen says
it's been here awhile.

22
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,336
He thinks the last flood
did it.

23
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,406
Oh, hold it.

24
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:12,544
Look.

25
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,950
Little shits.

26
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,630
There it is.

27
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:33,065
Yeah. There it is.

28
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,061
Came down from up there.

29
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,550
Motor's gone.

30
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,818
Who else knows
about this?

31
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,887
Just me and Galen.

32
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,489
What's he think?

33
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:31,890
He don't care about it.

34
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,024
Good.

35
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,028
Because this boat's ours.

36
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,008
This is perfect.

37
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,649
Holy shit.

38
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:03,088
Dude.

39
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,793
Oh!

40
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:09,694
Son of a bitch!

41
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,966
Whoa.

42
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:17,536
Those are awesome.

43
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:24,843
Man.

44
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,946
Dude, look at that beave,
you gotta see this.

45
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,080
Neck.
What?

46
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,052
Someone's here.

47
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,020
What?

48
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,154
Someone's living here.

49
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,829
Shit.

50
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,096
We gotta go.
Can't be late.

51
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,027
What are you doing?
I saw that same

52
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,063
boot print
up in the tree.

53
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,035
It's got a cross
in the heel.

54
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,108
Somebody's been
in our boat.

55
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,177
Shit. Let's go!

56
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,514
We gotta go if you
wanna make it back.

57
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,951
Takes twice as long
goin' upriver.

58
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,086
Hold on.

59
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:43,588
Up there, they stop.

60
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,761
Where the hell'd he go?

61
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,896
I don't know.

62
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,116
Shit, you know that guy?

63
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:12,784
I've never
seen him before.

64
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,155
Shit.

65
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:24,963
What'd you say, boy?

66
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,003
It's a hell of a thing,
ain't it?

67
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:34,606
What's that?

68
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,008
Boat in a tree.

69
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:39,344
Hell of a thing.

70
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,614
You talkin'
about our boat?

71
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:44,049
Talkin' about my boat.

72
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:45,684
We found it.

73
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,052
Yeah, you found it
with me livin' in it.

74
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:50,088
Possession is
nine-tenths of the law.

75
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,960
You got crosses
in your heels.

76
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,061
Nails.

77
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,830
Shaped like crosses.

78
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,131
What for?

79
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,933
Ward off evil spirits.

80
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,738
Bought 'em from a man
I called an Indian,

81
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,173
but he was a Mexican,

82
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,309
said they were
seven-league boots

83
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:14,379
worn by the seventh son
of the seventh son.

84
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:19,117
Told me they'd turn me into
a werewolf, that's a lie.

85
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,719
I don't know
nothin' about that.

86
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,355
They just
good luck boots.

87
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,258
As you can see, they ain't
working too well so far.

88
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,061
What's your name?

89
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,963
I'm Neckbone,
he's Ellis.

90
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,065
And, mister, I know you're
not the owner of that boat,

91
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,900
not for nine-tenths
of nothin'.

92
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:37,936
Neckbone...

93
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,904
That's a heck of
a good handle, son.

94
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:41,106
Where y'all from?

95
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:42,774
What do you care
where we're from?

96
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,275
DeWitt.

97
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,710
Arkansas boys.

98
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:49,848
Y'all had me worried
for a second.

99
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,049
We supposed
to know you?

100
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:55,086
I grew up around here,
but I've been gone awhile.

101
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,354
Where at around here?

102
00:10:56,356 --> 00:10:58,423
Different places.

103
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,825
Spent a lot of time
back up near the White.

104
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,027
You know
Shelly's Oxbow?

105
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,395
Ellis.

106
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:04,729
Yeah, I know it.

107
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,267
An old man named Tom Blankenship
used to live up in there.

108
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:11,770
He still does.

109
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,038
His boat's
across from mine.

110
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,777
Well, ain't that somethin'?

111
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:20,078
Hmm...

112
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,716
Now, I like you two boys.
You remind me of

113
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,220
Seein' as how you two
is from Arkansas,

114
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,855
and we know some
of the same people

115
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,057
and we grew up in
some of the same places,

116
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,792
I reckon we can make
a deal for somethin'.

117
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,860
A deal for what?

118
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:38,897
Food.

119
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,066
Food for a boat.

120
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,467
He's a bum, Ellis.
Come on.

121
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,036
Why don't you go
get your own food?

122
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,338
Well, I would if I could.

123
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,943
See, I told somebody
I'd meet 'em here. So...

124
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,446
Well, I'm stuck for now and
what I've got is runnin' low.

125
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,147
He's a bum, Ellis,
come on.

126
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,017
I ain't no bum.
I got money, boy.

127
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,753
You can call me a hobo, 'cause
a hobo will work for his living,

128
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,421
and you can call me
homeless 'cause...

129
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:05,356
Well, that's true for now,
but you call me a bum again,

130
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,159
I'm gonna teach you somethin'
about respect your daddy never did.

131
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,966
When they show up,
you'll leave?

132
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,103
Yup.

133
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,205
And when you leave,
that boat's ours?

134
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,339
That's right.

135
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,211
I'm just in
a tight spot.

136
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,880
Could use a little help.

137
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,221
We gotta go.

138
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,439
You get his name?

139
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,974
No.

140
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,861
Sorry.

141
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,964
Where ya been?

142
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:22,834
Me and Neck got caught
up helpin' Galen.

143
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,170
You're supposed to be helpin'
me. I had to load this myself.

144
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,472
I know. I'm sorry.

145
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,143
Get on in the back,
can't be later than we are.

146
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,153
Supposed to be 10.

147
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,889
It's 10,
you do your share.

148
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,523
I loaded this morning,
makes it five.

149
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,995
Can you drop me
at Neck's?

150
00:14:56,997 --> 00:14:58,997
Hadn't you seen
enough of him today?

151
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,266
Said he had
somethin' for me.

152
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,101
You see any more of them
Ding Dongs over there?

153
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,208
What did Mama want
to talk to you about?

154
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,344
What?

155
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,913
This morning?

156
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:17,148
What did she want
to talk to you about?

157
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,052
You spy on me
in my own house?

158
00:15:21,054 --> 00:15:24,222
I wasn't spyin',
I just heard y'all.

159
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,393
That's your
mother's business.

160
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,476
I came for that book.

161
00:15:45,478 --> 00:15:48,513
Oh, yeah.
Gotta give it a minute.

162
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,281
Hear that music?

163
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,016
Yeah?

164
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:54,352
That means he's doin' it.
That's his doin' it song.

165
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:57,055
You know who it is?

166
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,156
Whoever's drivin'
that Pontiac.

167
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,095
You tell Galen
about this morning?

168
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,596
Nah. You tell anybody?

169
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,033
That guy's crazy.

170
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,669
I don't know. I think he
just needed a little help.

171
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,705
He can swim his ass off
that island and get some.

172
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,175
I think I'm gonna
go back out there,

173
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,643
give him some food.

174
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,278
Why?

175
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:25,984
You're Neckbone, right?

176
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,085
Yeah.

177
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,386
Word of advice.

178
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,221
Don't grow up to be like
your shit heel uncle.

179
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,191
Hey.

180
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:34,592
You hear me?

181
00:16:34,594 --> 00:16:36,327
You treat a woman like
a princess, got it?

182
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,663
Yeah.

183
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,699
Come on, baby!

184
00:16:41,701 --> 00:16:43,434
I'm a goddamn princess!

185
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,503
That's uncalled for.

186
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:49,040
Hey, a lot of people are comfortable
with that kind of thing in the bedroom.

187
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:52,043
Some people aren't. We know
that about you now, okay?

188
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,112
What do you
think I am?

189
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,413
Pearls.

190
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,016
Galen finds 'em
in the mussel shells.

191
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,018
Come on,
let's get that book.

192
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,020
You weren't havin' any fun? No!

193
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,254
No fun at all?
No!

194
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,358
Please don't go.

195
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
I don't want you goin'
back out there by yourself.

196
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:14,098
That river's scary
enough with two people.

197
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,700
I don't trust that guy.

198
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,537
Here it is.

199
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,306
Galen said that really
turned things around for him.

200
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,441
Thanks.

201
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,745
Watch out
for that dog.

202
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,218
You really goin'
back out there?

203
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,655
Yeah. I think it's
the right thing to do.

204
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,123
All right.

205
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,792
I'll be over
in the mornin' then.

206
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,193
Hey,
that's a good book.

207
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,528
Be sure you do the worksheets in back.

208
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,430
Let's get
some dinner, Neck.

209
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,798
Hey, I'll call
before I come.

210
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,166
All right.

211
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,362
You okay, Mama?

212
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:21,299
Yes.

213
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,236
Are you hungry?

214
00:18:25,238 --> 00:18:26,838
You want me
to fix you something?

215
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,373
I'm all right.

216
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,109
Well, then,
I'm going to turn in.

217
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,588
Hey, Dad.

218
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:19,857
What do you know
about Tom Blankenship?

219
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:21,692
What?

220
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:24,162
Mr. Blankenship, what
do you know about him?

221
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,930
Why?

222
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,800
I don't know. He just looks
lonely over there all by himself.

223
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:31,669
Some people move to
this river to work on it,

224
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,238
and some people move
here to be left alone.

225
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:45,917
I want us to try and sit
down for dinner tonight, okay?

226
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,921
Ellis?

227
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:51,522
Be home by 7:00.

228
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:53,891
Yes, ma'am.

229
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:14,712
Where do you
think he's at?

230
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,247
Let's try the boat.

231
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:35,967
Looks like
he made camp.

232
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,970
You think
he's up there?

233
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,246
What are you doin'?

234
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:52,984
I try to never sleep
in the same spot twice.

235
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,253
- What you got there?
- Brought you some food.

236
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,291
Here, take it.

237
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,698
I owe you boys.

238
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,934
I was gonna try and run
a trotline this afternoon.

239
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,569
See where that got me.

240
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,742
Mmm.

241
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,678
Green beans
never tasted so good.

242
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,716
Why you have
that pistol?

243
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:32,857
Protection.

244
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,833
Y'all needn't
be afraid of me.

245
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:45,403
I've got two ways to protect
myself out here, this shirt

246
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,506
and this pistol.

247
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,941
There are fierce powers
at work in the world, boys.

248
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,877
Good, evil,

249
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,546
poor luck, best luck.

250
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,583
As men,

251
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,719
we've got to take
advantage where we can.

252
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,989
Y'all comin'?

253
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,366
So who's this guy
you're waiting on?

254
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:18,035
Oh, I'm not
waitin' on no guy.

255
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,570
I'm waitin'
on my girlfriend.

256
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:22,606
Juniper.
Is she hot?

257
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:24,742
She's beautiful.

258
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:26,010
Bullshit!

259
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,412
Prettiest girl I've
ever seen, hands down.

260
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,083
Blonde hair,
long legs.

261
00:22:32,085 --> 00:22:34,785
I tell you, she's like a dream
you don't want to wake up from.

262
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,859
She's got these birds
tattooed on her hands here.

263
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,829
Nightingales.

264
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,666
Good luck birds.

265
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,634
That a good luck snake?

266
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:51,969
No, it is not.

267
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,938
I hate snakes.

268
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,742
That's because God put 'em
here for us to fear.

269
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,810
We knew to
be afraid of snakes

270
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:02,079
long before we ever even
got into this world.

271
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:08,719
The Cherokee would wrap their
pregnant women's bellies in snake skin.

272
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,988
Induce labor,
scare the child out.

273
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,896
Put that around
your bed at night.

274
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,065
Snake won't cross
a braided rope.

275
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,400
Thanks.

276
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,035
So what's that
tattoo for then?

277
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,405
A reminder.

278
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:29,774
Don't get bit.

279
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:36,113
I was 10, swimmin' about a mile
up from here, me and Juniper.

280
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,983
Son of a bitch

281
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:42,620
swam up on me, bit me right
here up under the armpit.

282
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,056
Juniper got me
off to the clinic.

283
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,094
Doctor said I should have
been dead in 20 minutes.

284
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:53,597
Took us over an hour
just to get to town.

285
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,065
So what'd
they do for it?

286
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,700
Gave me the anti-venom.

287
00:23:56,702 --> 00:23:58,169
Cottonmouth.

288
00:23:58,171 --> 00:23:59,503
See here?

289
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,072
Thing with
anti-venom is,

290
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,909
they can only
give it to you once.

291
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:08,746
Made of horse blood. Body
would reject it a second time.

292
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:11,482
So the cure becomes more
dangerous than the poison.

293
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,017
What happens
if you get bit again?

294
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,854
I die

295
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,055
or just sweat it out.

296
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:21,926
We gotta go help
Neck's uncle.

297
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,060
All right.

298
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,030
You never
said your name.

299
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,098
Mud.

300
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,668
You can call me Mud.

301
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:31,969
Here, Mud.

302
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,771
I think you need this
worse than I do.

303
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,640
I'll be all right.

304
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:58,496
You start datin', I bet her
dad'll give you a free pickup.

305
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,532
I don't care about that.

306
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,038
What the hell
are you doing?

307
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,976
Where you goin'?

308
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:14,912
Stop it!

309
00:25:14,914 --> 00:25:16,547
Stop it! God!

310
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,716
Hey.

311
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,120
Holy shit, Pryor,
get off your ass!

312
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,055
You only got
what you deserve!

313
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:26,957
That's right,
go home, Pryor!

314
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,033
Do I know you?

315
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,736
I'm Ellis, that's Neck.

316
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:40,905
We went to junior high with you
before you went to high school.

317
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,173
How old are you?

318
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,308
Fourteen.

319
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,177
You know you just
punched a senior.

320
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,246
So?

321
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,785
I'm May Pearl.

322
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:56,320
I know.

323
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,855
What else do you know?

324
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,024
Nothing.

325
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,127
Son of a bitch.

326
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,261
Ellis.

327
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:07,998
Ellis!

328
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,003
Look.

329
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,945
You ever
seen that girl before?

330
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:22,112
No.

331
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,187
Did you see her hands?

332
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,157
Hey, girl!

333
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,725
Hey!

334
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:36,226
Hey, girl,
where you goin'?

335
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,264
That ain't even cool.

336
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,799
Hello?

337
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,102
Oh, sorry.

338
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,204
We think we know a guy that
might know that girl over there.

339
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:49,807
Oh.
May Pearl, let's go!

340
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,342
Okay.

341
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,111
Okay, I guess
I'll see you.

342
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:58,983
If you can find my number,
you should give me a call.

343
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,151
I can find it.

344
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,028
Into the Piggly Wiggly.
She came from the motel.

345
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,952
Home for dinner?

346
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,022
What you hidin' for?

347
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:14,258
I ain't hidin'.

348
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,127
Come over here.

349
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,874
You know I love you?

350
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,743
Yes, sir.

351
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:34,912
I know.

352
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,414
I work you hard,
'cause life is work.

353
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,749
You know that?

354
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,785
Yes, sir.

355
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,095
Your mom is talkin'
about movin' into town.

356
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:52,763
What's that mean?

357
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,064
She seems set on it,

358
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:56,166
wants to separate.

359
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,103
May even ask
for a divorce.

360
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,073
What's that mean for me?

361
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,111
It means enjoy
this river, son.

362
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:09,379
Enjoy it while
you live on it.

363
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:11,515
'Cause this way of life
isn't long for this world.

364
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,817
River Authority's
about made certain of that.

365
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,154
But you and me,

366
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,191
we can still live
out here, right?

367
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:24,128
R.A. Can't take your boat.

368
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,829
Not while you're
still livin' in it.

369
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:28,098
This houseboat's
in your mother's name.

370
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,000
Her daddy gave it
to her, not to me.

371
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,137
She wants to leave it.

372
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:36,106
River Authority's got
every right to come in here

373
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,376
and tear this place apart
board by board.

374
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,111
That ain't right.

375
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,081
You work outta here.

376
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,884
We got the ice machine.

377
00:29:46,886 --> 00:29:48,485
The traps.

378
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,121
What are we
supposed to do?

379
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,857
Like I said, that's
your mother's business.

380
00:29:58,096 --> 00:30:00,164
I ain't no townie.

381
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,465
I ain't livin' like that.

382
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,338
I've let you down, son.

383
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,810
Man is supposed to be in
charge of his own affairs,

384
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,849
but I haven't
worked it like that.

385
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,317
But y'all are married.

386
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,419
Y'all are supposed
to love each other.

387
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,391
I don't know
about that anymore.

388
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,266
Hey, Ellis.

389
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,881
You're late.

390
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:38,055
Ellis?

391
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,093
Damn, boy,
what you doin' out here?

392
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,330
I got you
some Beanie Weenie.

393
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,067
I appreciate that.

394
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,204
But I didn't expect you
out here at night.

395
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:02,145
Boy, you really know
how to do somebody right.

396
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,014
I wasn't gonna say nothin',

397
00:33:04,016 --> 00:33:06,616
but it's pretty tough to make a
meal out of pumpkin pie fillin'.

398
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,519
That's all my mom had.

399
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,154
Oh, I ain't complainin'.

400
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,690
Can I get one of those?

401
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,160
They're yours
to begin with.

402
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,247
That's good, right?

403
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,484
You been
out here too long.

404
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,392
Mmm-hmm.

405
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:51,194
The girl
you're waitin' on,

406
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,796
she's your girlfriend?

407
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,266
Juniper.

408
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:57,401
Yeah.

409
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,208
How'd you meet her?

410
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:09,112
We grew up together.

411
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,251
You love her?

412
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,223
I do.

413
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,496
First time I saw her was on
this river, just up from here.

414
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,434
She saved my life.

415
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,702
From the snake bite.
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,108
I was younger than
you are right now.

417
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,147
When I came to in the
hospital and she was there,

418
00:34:45,283 --> 00:34:49,486
it was like the whole world
just split wide open and

419
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:50,754
come back together new.

420
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,158
I knew from then on
I'd do anything for her.

421
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,464
Why aren't y'all
married then?

422
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,668
I've asked.
Several times.

423
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,606
Marriage

424
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,176
just don't work
for some people.

425
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,854
My dad says

426
00:35:23,856 --> 00:35:25,589
my parents might be
getting a divorce.

427
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,195
I'm sorry to hear that.

428
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:37,534
They say if it happens, and
my mom moves us off the river,

429
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,437
the government can
come take our boat.

430
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:41,872
Who says that?

431
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:43,807
Everybody.

432
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,408
They passed a law.

433
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,388
I saw Juniper today.

434
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,924
What?

435
00:36:00,926 --> 00:36:02,626
She had the birds
tattooed on her hands.

436
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:04,928
Just like you said.

437
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,463
You're right.

438
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:08,932
She's pretty.

439
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,869
Where'd you see her?

440
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,938
At the Piggly Wiggly.

441
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,741
I think she's staying
at a motel nearby there.

442
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,576
That's good news.

443
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,579
That's real good news.

444
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,714
She know
you're out here?

445
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,752
No. No, we, uh...

446
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:33,924
We said we'd meet somewhere
else, a couple days from now.

447
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,362
You wanna go tonight?
I can take you up river.

448
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:43,800
Tomorrow.

449
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:46,269
I'll go tomorrow.

450
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,407
You want me to come
and get you?

451
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,741
No, I can manage.

452
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,212
Hell, I made it out here,
didn't I?

453
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:05,789
It's a hell of a thing,
ain't it?

454
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,260
It's a hell of a thing.

455
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,564
Time to get up.

456
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:16,233
It's too early.

457
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,602
I'm going to Wal-Mart and
I need you to come with me.

458
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,803
Mom.

459
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:21,271
Come on.

460
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,983
Ellis, I know what your
father told you last night.

461
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,287
That's...
That's not what I wanted.

462
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,022
I wanted to sit you down
and talk about it.

463
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,524
What do you
want to talk about?

464
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:44,394
You want to leave and that
means they can tear up our house.

465
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,896
Well, I spent my whole
life on that boat.

466
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,865
I don't think
it's too much to ask...

467
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,401
Oh, no.

468
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,738
Oh, I hope
no one's hurt.

469
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:01,645
I'm just sayin' there
are two sides to this.

470
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,813
You know, I haven't
made up my mind yet,

471
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:07,384
because I wanted you to be
involved with my decision.

472
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,686
But I need a change, Ellis.

473
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,722
I deserve one.

474
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:17,494
I think
they're searching people.

475
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,436
How you
doin' today, ma'am?

476
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:30,373
I'm doin' just fine. Have you seen
or picked up any hitchhikers today?

477
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,841
No, sir.

478
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:33,476
Okay, could you open
the back for me, please?

479
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,078
It's open.
Okay.

480
00:38:37,014 --> 00:38:38,915
Ma'am, have you
seen this man?

481
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,618
No, sir.

482
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,454
Son, have you?

483
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,924
No.

484
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,593
Okay, well, there's been
reports that he's in the area.

485
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:52,629
So if you see him, just
call 9-1-1 for us, okay?

486
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,963
Okay.
What'd he do?

487
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,935
What'd he do?

488
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,637
Move along, please.

489
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:06,543
Neck, Neck, pick up!

490
00:39:08,412 --> 00:39:10,013
I knew it!

491
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:12,349
I told you that crazy son
of a bitch was trouble.

492
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,683
Did you tell him
where he is?

493
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:15,085
No, that's why
I called you.

494
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,986
He needs to know
people are looking for him.

495
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:18,722
You think he doesn't
know that already?

496
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,791
Jesus, Ellis. Why do you even
think he's on that island?

497
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,728
Ellis, I'm serious.

498
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,730
We don't know
who this guy is.

499
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,698
He loves her, Neck.
He told me.

500
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,367
I don't give a shit
who he loves.

501
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,837
He's not dangerous.

502
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:42,612
It sounds like a shitload of
state troopers thinks different.

503
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,633
No tellin' where the
hell he's been sleepin'.

504
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,935
He might be
gone already.

505
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,115
Shit.

506
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:23,853
Sorry, boys, but I'm going to have
to go back on our deal for the boat.

507
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:26,122
I don't feel good about it,
but I don't see any other way

508
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,658
out of what I'm into.

509
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,160
So you know about
the state troopers?

510
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,897
What state troopers?

511
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,765
The ones spreadin' your
picture all over the place.

512
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,035
Stoppin' cars on the 165,
searching for your ass.

513
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:41,037
No, I don't know
about that.

514
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:44,574
But it don't surprise me, I got
a lot of folks lookin' for me.

515
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,142
Why?

516
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,644
I shot a man.

517
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,016
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you boys sooner,

518
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:55,752
but I was hopin' to be long
gone before anything came of it.

519
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,754
Didn't want y'all involved.

520
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,028
Look, y'all been
real good to me.

521
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,998
You're the only friends
I got out here.

522
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,035
If troopers got 165 blocked, that
means they got other roads blocked, too.

523
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:14,003
So I ain't goin' to
get nowhere in a car.

524
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,909
I'm want to try
getting this boat down.

525
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,644
See if we can get it
in the water.

526
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,716
See, with a boat like this, I can
make it to the Gulf in two days.

527
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:28,918
Heck, from there,
I can get anywhere.

528
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,789
But I need a boat at least this
big to make it on the open water.

529
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:34,958
It's got no title,
no owner,

530
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,793
nobody lookin' for it.

531
00:41:36,795 --> 00:41:38,027
It's my best shot.

532
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,263
Who'd you kill?

533
00:41:40,265 --> 00:41:43,032
Just a bad
piece of business.

534
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,601
Y'all don't need
to hear about it.

535
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,035
I need to hear about it.

536
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,086
Juniper, she...

537
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:12,729
Hooked up with this guy. He
was no good. His name was...

538
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:17,033
Hutchins. His family owns a chain
of restaurants down in Texas.

539
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,268
Where were you?

540
00:42:22,106 --> 00:42:23,773
I was around, but

541
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,078
me and Juniper
was on the outs.

542
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,083
She met him, he sold her on a
pack of lies, he got her pregnant.

543
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:37,654
That's when he started
showin' who he really was.

544
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,826
He dropped her down a flight of stairs
after whoopin' her half to death.

545
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:46,162
She lost the baby,
he made it so...

546
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,998
Doctors say she can't
even have children no more.

547
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,969
There are things you can
get away with in this world

548
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:55,638
and there are things
you can't.

549
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,908
I tracked him down,

550
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,214
found him in a little motel
outside of San Antonio, he was there

551
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,185
with another woman.
That's...

552
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:11,187
That's where it happened.

553
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,927
So I understand if you boys
don't want to help me no more.

554
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,163
But I need this boat.

555
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:22,932
And I need to get it
into the water, fast.

556
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,171
I made a list of things we're
going to need. What you think?

557
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,740
You did it for her?

558
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:31,874
To protect her?

559
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,110
Yeah.

560
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,048
What you think?

561
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,084
I think you want us to run
around, stickin' our necks out,

562
00:43:41,086 --> 00:43:42,719
getting everything
you need

563
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,320
just so you can
take our boat.

564
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,655
That's about it.

565
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,890
What do we
get out of it?

566
00:43:47,892 --> 00:43:49,025
What you want?

567
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:52,795
What about
that pistol?

568
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,901
Only two things I got
out here worth anything.

569
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:00,036
This shirt.

570
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:02,905
And this pistol.

571
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:05,174
And I can't give you
this shirt,

572
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,943
'cause I need it
for protection.

573
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:10,279
But if you help me get this
boat in the water, the pistol,

574
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:12,882
it's yours.

575
00:44:12,884 --> 00:44:14,083
What kind is it?

576
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,084
A.45.

577
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,821
Got to get this boat
floatin' first.

578
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:23,092
All right.

579
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:29,032
All right, y'all scrounge
what you can off this list,

580
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:31,367
but if we're
gonna do this right,

581
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,037
we're gonna need more help.
Can you fetch Tom for me?

582
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,806
Tom Blankenship?

583
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:40,076
Yeah, I was hopin' to let that
old assassin sit this one out.

584
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,011
We're gonna need him to
get things that y'all can't.

585
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,946
Can you find him?

586
00:44:43,948 --> 00:44:46,049
I know where he lives, but
I've never talked to him.

587
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,251
Just tell him my name,
he'll know.

588
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,129
Hey, boys.

589
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:01,364
Thanks.

590
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:03,199
Don't lose my pistol.

591
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,495
You coming?

592
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:34,297
Nah, I'll watch the boat.

593
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:24,413
Why are you
huntin' me?

594
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,387
Are you deaf, boy? I said
why are you huntin' me?

595
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,489
I ain't huntin' you.

596
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,226
What's your
business here?

597
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,561
I come to find you.

598
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,163
I got a message for you.

599
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,832
You Senior's boy?

600
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,334
Yes, sir.

601
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:48,271
What you got to say to me
that he can't tell me himself?

602
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,405
It ain't from him.

603
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,141
Mud sent me.

604
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,079
Mud?

605
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,214
Yes, sir.

606
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:04,020
What you know
about him?

607
00:47:04,022 --> 00:47:06,088
He told me
to come find you.

608
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,324
Your daddy
know about this?

609
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,026
No, sir.

610
00:47:10,028 --> 00:47:11,494
Mud needs your help.

611
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,001
Where is he?

612
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:37,186
There he is.

613
00:47:48,098 --> 00:47:49,065
You think
that's his daddy?

614
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,234
I don't know.

615
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,244
Sir.

616
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,880
Where is she?

617
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,918
In town.

618
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:13,489
Got here yesterday.

619
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,334
What are you doing
out here like this, Mud?

620
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:32,108
I killed that last man
she was with, Tom.

621
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,214
He had it comin', too.

622
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:47,323
You have been doggin'
this girl your whole life.

623
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,093
She's run you halfway
across the country and back.

624
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,596
And for what?
For this!

625
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:56,332
Be stuck out here on
this island like this!

626
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:58,167
Beggin'!

627
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,269
A murderer now! A thief!

628
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,205
I ain't no thief, Tom... No?
What would you call it then?

629
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:06,409
Not to mention draggin'
these boys into this...

630
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:09,345
Man, he's really
giving it to him.

631
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,380
You got any idea
what you're doin'?

632
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,054
I'm right
ashamed of you, Mud.

633
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:29,298
Don't expect any help from me,
'cause there's none to be given.

634
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,976
All right, I'm ready.

635
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,083
Where you goin'?

636
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,251
Hey!

637
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:52,455
God damn it.

638
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:00,363
You all right?

639
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,571
Looks like we're
on our own, Ellis.

640
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:17,146
I didn't want to have to ask you
to be the one to do this, but I need

641
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:22,485
to get this letter to Juniper.
Can you take it to her for me?

642
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:23,619
Yeah.

643
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,492
All right, now listen up.

644
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,296
You got to be careful,
all right? You can't just

645
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:36,766
walk up and knock on
her door. You hear me?

646
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,035
You gotta
watch yourself.

647
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:40,770
I can handle it.

648
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,042
Get that to her.

649
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,176
All right.

650
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,146
All right.

651
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:55,351
Watch yourself, Ellis.

652
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,245
You Mud's daddy?

653
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:26,682
Mud don't have no daddy.

654
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:32,288
No mama either,
as far as I could tell.

655
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,723
He was livin' in the woods
when I first met him.

656
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,559
Younger than you are now.

657
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:44,867
You boys need to
watch yourselves now.

658
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,870
What Mud's into is somethin'
you don't want to be involved in.

659
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,740
You best forget
about him, you hear?

660
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:19,135
Which one?

661
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,604
Let's start
at the top.

662
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:23,339
Work our way down.

663
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:24,473
All right.

664
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:41,857
What you want?

665
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,260
We're sellin' fish. Would
you like to buy some?

666
00:52:44,262 --> 00:52:47,196
Fish? I don't want
to buy no damn fish.

667
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:59,508
Keep lyin' and I'll
crack your nose open!

668
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,876
Keep lyin'!

669
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,279
You hear me, trash?
Where is that guy?

670
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,423
Who are you?

671
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:15,658
Who the hell are you?

672
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,726
He send you?

673
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:19,228
You know this man?

674
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:20,896
Look at it!
Do you know this man?

675
00:53:20,898 --> 00:53:23,566
Fish! Fish!
We're just sellin' fish!

676
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,647
Fish...

677
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,931
I know you know
where he is.

678
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,568
And I swear to God,

679
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,272
I'll cut a hole through
every one of you to find him.

680
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,645
We know
you came here for him,

681
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:14,516
and we know he's too stupid
to leave here without you.

682
00:54:14,518 --> 00:54:16,652
So whenever
he sticks his head up

683
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:19,722
out of whatever shithole
he's hidin' in,

684
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:20,990
I'm gonna be there.

685
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,960
You tell him that.

686
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,769
You need to mind
your business, boy.

687
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,046
You okay?

688
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:45,047
Yeah.

689
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,882
Man, he popped your eye.

690
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,078
Let me see your face.

691
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:20,549
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

692
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:21,984
Here, hold this on there.

693
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:26,388
Thank you.

694
00:55:28,091 --> 00:55:30,059
I'll buy your fish, okay?

695
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:32,561
How much do you want
for the whole cooler?

696
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,367
Mud sent us
to give you this.

697
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:42,504
You know Mud?

698
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:43,639
Yeah, we know him.

699
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:15,938
Says, "Hold tight."

700
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,139
We know, we read it.

701
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:23,379
Well, do you know
how long hold tight is?

702
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,980
I think
it's just a couple days.

703
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:26,782
He wants to get
a boat for y'all.

704
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:32,955
God...

705
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:37,826
Tell him I'll wait.

706
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,900
But I don't want y'all
gettin' involved.

707
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,803
So you tell him what I
said and let that be it.

708
00:56:47,805 --> 00:56:49,938
I don't want you
gettin' in any trouble.

709
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:51,840
We'll be all right.
Just keep your door locked.

710
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:52,975
We'll be in touch.

711
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,444
Wait.

712
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:57,980
What's your name?

713
00:56:59,048 --> 00:57:01,116
I'm Ellis,
he's Neckbone.

714
00:57:15,832 --> 00:57:17,065
Thank you, Ellis.

715
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,037
We gotta go.

716
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:38,921
Let's go, hard on.

717
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,828
Hello?
Is May Pearl there?

718
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,631
Hey, it's Ellis.

719
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,567
In the phone book.

720
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:29,738
Tomorrow?

721
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,206
Yeah, I can meet you.

722
00:58:32,775 --> 00:58:34,243
Okay. Bye.

723
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,285
We got moor,
but no motor.

724
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,956
This will work for now.

725
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,924
Ellis, you get her
my note?

726
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,092
Yeah.

727
01:00:00,663 --> 01:00:02,164
Where'd you get
that shiner from?

728
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,003
There was this guy in there,
he was beatin' up on her.

729
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,373
Ellis rushed him.

730
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:13,008
Got smacked for it.

731
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,745
What'd he look like?

732
01:00:16,747 --> 01:00:18,313
I don't know,

733
01:00:18,315 --> 01:00:20,115
he was tall.

734
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,783
Looked like a cowboy.

735
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:23,285
Light hair slicked back?

736
01:00:23,287 --> 01:00:24,620
Yeah.

737
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,656
Thank you for
looking after her.

738
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,427
His name's Carver,

739
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:08,330
he's the brother
of the man I killed.

740
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:13,301
If he's here,
there's plenty more comin'.

741
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:14,770
More what?

742
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:18,040
Bounty hunters.
Carver's rotten,

743
01:01:18,042 --> 01:01:19,307
but his old man,

744
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:21,276
that's the one
to be scared of.

745
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:24,312
He'll spend every dime he's
got to make sure I'm dead.

746
01:01:24,314 --> 01:01:26,014
If it was up to me,

747
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:28,250
I'd lay the whole family
down, same as the other.

748
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:30,986
Ain't a decent man
between them.

749
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,120
Now, look here.

750
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,024
Listen to me,

751
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:39,294
if you see that old man,
don't you go near him.

752
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,197
He's the triple six
real deal scratch.

753
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,465
What's a scratch?

754
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,002
It's the devil himself.

755
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:55,343
Let's unload the rest
of this, get it up top.

756
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,264
Now, what are you
waitin' for?

757
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,399
Shut up.

758
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:22,170
All right, Ellis.

759
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:24,206
Can you climb that trunk,

760
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,174
choke this off that limb? Yeah.

761
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:28,076
Tie it in a bowline knot,
you know it?

762
01:02:28,078 --> 01:02:29,978
I'm not stupid.

763
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,347
Neck, I need you
to start cuttin' line

764
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:36,051
in 15 two-foot pieces. Count
two foot as long as your arm.

765
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:39,855
Be careful.

766
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,196
What's so special about that shirt
you'd lose your pistol for it?

767
01:02:48,198 --> 01:02:50,065
It's got a wolf's eye
sewn into the sleeve.

768
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:53,268
More protection
than a bullet ever gave.

769
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,470
Tom swears by it.

770
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,506
Tom said
he wasn't your daddy.

771
01:02:57,508 --> 01:02:59,374
He's the closest thing to
a father I've ever had.

772
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,477
I never met my parents.

773
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,280
It's hard,

774
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,883
not knowin' those
you came from.

775
01:03:07,885 --> 01:03:10,519
My Uncle Galen tells me
things about 'em.

776
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:12,020
He's the one that
takes care of me.

777
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:15,023
Yeah. Tom
did that for me.

778
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:17,793
What'd you mean when you
called Tom an assassin?

779
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:20,529
Tom's had lives you'd
never even know about.

780
01:03:20,531 --> 01:03:24,099
Grew up, up North.
Went to Yale.

781
01:03:24,101 --> 01:03:28,036
For a long time, he was a
paid assassin for the CIA.

782
01:03:28,038 --> 01:03:30,038
Lived in Cuba in '63.

783
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,507
Shoot, he's killed more people
than you all probably ever met.

784
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:35,110
Neck, how's
that line comin'?

785
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,446
If you're gonna do it,
do it!

786
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:07,976
This shit's crazy.

787
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,080
One down.

788
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:39,140
Come on.

789
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,185
Wanna sit down?

790
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:02,097
Hey, you must
really like to fight.

791
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:05,066
Not really.

792
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,204
You got a lot of friends.

793
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:10,405
They're all right.

794
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:12,474
I don't know
all of them.

795
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:15,443
I bet you're
pretty popular.

796
01:05:15,445 --> 01:05:18,046
Why do you say that?

797
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:21,049
Because you're
nice to people.

798
01:05:21,051 --> 01:05:22,083
How do you know that?

799
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:24,119
You're nice to me.

800
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,022
But I like you.

801
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:33,628
I got you something.

802
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:37,499
A bracelet?

803
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:39,501
Yeah.

804
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:42,037
Neckbone's uncle
finds them in the river

805
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:44,639
and collects the pearls, and I thought
with your name and everything...

806
01:05:44,641 --> 01:05:45,974
Thank you.

807
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,121
You wanna be
my girlfriend?

808
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:03,451
You've
been seeing Mud?

809
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,121
No.

810
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,327
You don't have
to lie to me, boy.

811
01:07:12,329 --> 01:07:14,295
I've seen you running
around, taking things.

812
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:22,203
He all right?

813
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:24,606
He's okay.

814
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,044
He called you
an assassin.

815
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,815
How long have
you known Mud?

816
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:36,418
A few days.

817
01:07:38,154 --> 01:07:40,622
That's long enough to
know he's full of shit.

818
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,793
So, it's not true?

819
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,595
I was a sharpshooter
for a while

820
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:49,831
in the Marines. In Mud's
world, that's an assassin.

821
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:52,500
But it's not
exactly true, right?

822
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:54,169
Yeah, I guess.

823
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:55,437
Assassin.

824
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:04,345
You think he's a badass,
don't you?

825
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:05,680
I don't know.

826
01:08:10,152 --> 01:08:13,221
You know why he's stuck
off on that island?

827
01:08:13,223 --> 01:08:14,355
Yeah.

828
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,492
He shot somebody.

829
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,229
You know why
he shot that man?

830
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:24,499
'Cause he hurt Juniper?

831
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,267
Right.

832
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:36,177
The real reason Mud's in all the
trouble he's got is because of her.

833
01:08:36,179 --> 01:08:40,215
He's been in love with that
girl since he was your age.

834
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:42,250
Trouble is she don't care
about nobody but herself.

835
01:08:42,252 --> 01:08:44,552
I've told him as much.

836
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:51,292
She'd bed down with the
meanest snake she could find,

837
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:54,829
and then when things got bad,
she'd go runnin' back to Mud.

838
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:58,299
He'd take her back.

839
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:02,804
Then he'd go find whatever unlucky
son of a bitch laid a hand on her

840
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:05,740
and beat him so bad he'd
know never to touch her again.

841
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:11,146
Only this time, I guess

842
01:09:11,148 --> 01:09:14,449
he figured beatin' wasn't good
enough, he had to go shoot that feller.

843
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:24,926
I'm not for sure, but I'd put money
on it that she knew he'd do it.

844
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,230
She might even
put him up to it.

845
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,738
Either way, those two
are set for failure.

846
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,742
The only chance he's
got is to cut her loose.

847
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,845
That'll never happen.

848
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,880
But I tell you what,
Mud's no badass.

849
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:46,881
He's runnin' scared
right now...

850
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:48,550
I've got to go.

851
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:56,291
You're wrong
about Juniper.

852
01:09:56,293 --> 01:09:58,726
They love each other and
they're going to make it.

853
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,629
If you weren't such a worn out
old man, you'd know it was true.

854
01:10:30,459 --> 01:10:32,360
What do
you say, Ellis?

855
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:34,529
I got more stuff.

856
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,598
Yeah?
Did you find a motor?

857
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,865
Not yet.
Oh.

858
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:40,235
What's that?

859
01:10:40,237 --> 01:10:42,270
Bonfire's my
all-purpose cure all

860
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,673
for bad luck.

861
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:48,876
I don't know
where this boat's been

862
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:52,580
or what kind of person
the owner was before me.

863
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:56,351
For all I know, there could be some
serious bad business left on it.

864
01:10:56,353 --> 01:11:00,321
We got too much ridin' on
this thing to leave to chance.

865
01:11:00,323 --> 01:11:02,490
Tom called me over
to his place this morning.

866
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:03,625
What did he say?

867
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,894
He was
runnin' down Juniper.

868
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,830
Told him he was
a worn out old man.

869
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:11,032
And he couldn't know
how much you love her.

870
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,700
You don't know
his story.

871
01:11:12,702 --> 01:11:13,801
I don't care.

872
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:15,870
You should.

873
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:22,043
Tom loved a woman more than
most men can in two lifetimes.

874
01:11:22,045 --> 01:11:24,712
They had a good life
started together.

875
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,883
She was pregnant
with a little boy,

876
01:11:28,885 --> 01:11:30,718
birth got
the best of them.

877
01:11:31,654 --> 01:11:33,688
Tom's been alone
ever since.

878
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:36,324
Lone wolf.

879
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,666
Thanks for the tin.

880
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:32,947
This shit never gets easy.

881
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,616
That's a good haul.

882
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,652
I've had worse.

883
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,060
You doin' all right?

884
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:48,930
Yeah.

885
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,968
Do you need to
tell me anything?

886
01:12:53,970 --> 01:12:55,103
Tell you what?

887
01:12:57,005 --> 01:12:59,640
I know I'm just your
uncle, not a parent.

888
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,578
But you can tell me
things if you need to.

889
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,149
I can tell you this helmet
smells like my duck butter.

890
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:23,531
Where'd you get
that black eye?

891
01:13:26,168 --> 01:13:29,470
A kid in town.
He got his, too.

892
01:13:29,472 --> 01:13:31,105
What was y'all
fightin' for?

893
01:13:31,107 --> 01:13:32,907
About this girl.

894
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,542
What girl?

895
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:35,910
My girlfriend.

896
01:13:38,046 --> 01:13:40,047
You got a girlfriend?

897
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:41,182
Yes, sir.

898
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,085
When did that happen?

899
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,553
Other day.

900
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:49,590
What's her name?

901
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:52,994
May Pearl.

902
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,963
Two first names,
just like your mother.

903
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:00,535
Have you seen
your mother today?

904
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:01,736
No.

905
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,006
You're not
talkin' to me now?

906
01:14:05,008 --> 01:14:07,809
I'm talkin'.
I'm talkin' to both of you.

907
01:14:07,811 --> 01:14:09,510
All y'all want
to do is talk.

908
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:14,215
She'd rather tongue lash a
problem than step up and handle it.

909
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:16,684
You'll see one day.

910
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:20,054
Women are tough, boy.

911
01:14:20,056 --> 01:14:22,056
They set you up for things.

912
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:27,228
You can't trust love, Ellis.

913
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:30,131
If you're not careful,
it'll up and run out on you.

914
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,716
Daddy, this is Miller.
He's one of ours.

915
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:56,984
Appreciate your help.

916
01:15:56,986 --> 01:15:58,119
Yes, sir.

917
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,088
We'll be in,
in a minute.

918
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:06,727
Catch me up.

919
01:16:08,096 --> 01:16:09,664
We're working in shifts.

920
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:11,732
Got two
outside her motel.

921
01:16:11,734 --> 01:16:15,102
The others are either out
searchin' or sleepin' here.

922
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:18,005
I met the county sheriff,
but he wasn't much help.

923
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:19,941
Said they handle
their own business.

924
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:22,777
But I got two of
his people on payroll

925
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,812
and a person inside
at the state police.

926
01:16:27,849 --> 01:16:30,017
Ellis, let's go, boy.
Come on.

927
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,690
Okay.

928
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:37,959
Let's meet the men.

929
01:16:37,961 --> 01:16:39,093
Yes, sir.

930
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:56,010
Shit.

931
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:01,616
Get up.

932
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:03,818
Y'all pay attention.

933
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,186
This is my father, King.

934
01:17:05,188 --> 01:17:07,054
He runs the show.

935
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,691
Men.

936
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:21,035
All right, everybody up.

937
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,304
Gather around.

938
01:17:25,173 --> 01:17:26,407
Now form a circle.

939
01:17:29,077 --> 01:17:30,745
Everybody, take a knee.

940
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,683
Want you to join hands.

941
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,821
We're gonna pray for the death
of the man who killed my son.

942
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,858
Everybody, bow your heads.

943
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:48,329
You touch her titty?

944
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,897
A little.

945
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,032
That's great, man.

946
01:17:51,034 --> 01:17:53,134
Thanks.

947
01:17:54,704 --> 01:17:57,304
We could take it apart,
bring it out piece by piece.

948
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:58,873
It's welded,
we'd just tear it up.

949
01:18:00,108 --> 01:18:01,876
What if we
float it out?

950
01:18:01,878 --> 01:18:03,210
With what?

951
01:18:03,212 --> 01:18:04,812
Come on.

952
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,052
Oh, Jesus!

953
01:18:11,054 --> 01:18:12,053
What do you think?

954
01:18:12,055 --> 01:18:13,788
That's great, Galen.

955
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:25,166
Come here, Ellis.

956
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,180
See that ceiling fan
up there?

957
01:18:41,049 --> 01:18:42,717
I found it in the river.

958
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,020
Works great.

959
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:48,022
Best ceiling fan
I've ever owned.

960
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,993
This river brings
a lot of trash down it.

961
01:18:52,995 --> 01:18:54,829
Some of that trash
is worth a lot of money.

962
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:58,499
Some of it's not.

963
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:01,335
You got to know what's worth
keepin' and what's worth lettin' go.

964
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,972
You know the difference?

965
01:19:04,974 --> 01:19:06,107
I think so.

966
01:19:08,009 --> 01:19:10,111
Neck looks up to you.

967
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:15,282
Don't get my nephew into anything
you can't get him out of. Okay?

968
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:28,429
To get a piece to get over a
girl that put one over on him.

969
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:32,299
So, you get
your heart broke?

970
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:34,535
Don't walk around with
a shit look on your face.

971
01:19:34,537 --> 01:19:37,338
Get back in there,
get your tip wet.

972
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:39,540
You hear me?

973
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:43,944
You know what I'm sayin'. Let's go.

974
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:46,280
Want to hang out? Allen's comin'
over, we're going to pump it up.

975
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,882
No.
We got stuff to do.

976
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,017
Whatever.

977
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,554
What were y'all
talking about?

978
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:56,357
I don't know.

979
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,159
<i>King!</i>
<i>That's what they call him.</i>

980
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:01,328
Y'all didn't go
near him, did ya?

981
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:02,429
No.

982
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,497
Good.

983
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,065
How we lookin'
on that motor?

984
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:07,802
There's one in the scrap
yard that might work.

985
01:20:07,804 --> 01:20:11,806
I can get it runnin'. Tell
him, Ellis. Let's pull this.

986
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:14,575
It's true, he built his own dirt bike.

987
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:16,477
Little more.

988
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:20,080
Neck, take a shot at it.

989
01:20:20,082 --> 01:20:23,050
I don't know, that
motor's worth somethin'.

990
01:20:23,052 --> 01:20:26,821
It's been there for months.
Nobody will even know it's gone.

991
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:27,955
Ellis.

992
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:30,224
We need a motor.

993
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:52,947
<i>Winds out of the west</i>
<i>at 22 miles per hour...</i>

994
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,452
Hello?

995
01:20:58,454 --> 01:20:59,587
<i>Juniper?</i>

996
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:00,921
Ellis.

997
01:21:00,923 --> 01:21:04,525
Thank God. I'm goin'
crazy in this room.

998
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,494
Is Mud okay?

999
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:09,296
Yeah, it's time to
take you out to him.

1000
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:12,032
<i>Now?</i>

1001
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,467
Tomorrow.

1002
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,236
Tomorrow,
we'll come get you.

1003
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:17,171
<i>He's got a plan</i>
<i>for y'all to get away.</i>

1004
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,276
Neckbone'll be waitin' at the
side of the motel with a dirt bike.

1005
01:21:22,278 --> 01:21:24,979
Wait, just...

1006
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:27,581
Just wait a minute. I
don't know about all that.

1007
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:29,884
<i>Where does he think</i>
<i>we're gonna go?</i>

1008
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:31,485
What are we
even gonna do?

1009
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:36,023
This is Mud, this is
exactly what he does.

1010
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:37,091
<i>It's okay.</i>

1011
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:38,559
It's a good plan.

1012
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:40,060
Just be ready.

1013
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,564
Why are you doing this?

1014
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,933
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1015
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:47,534
Why are you
helping us?

1016
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:50,204
Because y'all
love each other.

1017
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:00,915
I'll see you tomorrow.

1018
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:02,216
Wait.

1019
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,058
How'd it go?
We're good.

1020
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:12,192
Give me a quarter.

1021
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:14,328
May Pearl!

1022
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:17,131
May Pearl!

1023
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:30,010
It's all right, man,
she's with her family.

1024
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:32,613
Come on, I want to get
that motor before dark.

1025
01:22:32,615 --> 01:22:33,948
Hey.

1026
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:44,091
Y'all remember me,
don't ya?

1027
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,198
Sorry about that.

1028
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:52,466
You caught me
at a real bad time.

1029
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:55,502
Hold on a second.

1030
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:57,204
Just a sec.

1031
01:22:57,206 --> 01:22:59,573
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

1032
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:04,144
Y'all were just doin' a job
and I got in the way.

1033
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:07,047
What do you say I buy a whole
batch of fish y'all were sellin'?

1034
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,483
Forty cover it?

1035
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,684
That'll about do it.

1036
01:23:10,686 --> 01:23:12,219
We don't want
your money.

1037
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:14,989
Hold on. Hold on.

1038
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:19,159
Y'all get around,
don't you?

1039
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,296
Bet ya know every

1040
01:23:22,298 --> 01:23:24,331
hole and ditch
in this town.

1041
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:31,171
You haven't come across that
man whose picture I showed you?

1042
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:32,106
Have you?

1043
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,213
Sure about that?

1044
01:23:39,215 --> 01:23:40,748
Take a look
with your good eye.

1045
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:45,319
I'm sure.

1046
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:48,155
What about that girl
from the motel?

1047
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:50,157
The pretty one.

1048
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,126
Talk to her
some more?

1049
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:56,330
There's a number on there.

1050
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,500
Let me know if you do.

1051
01:24:33,835 --> 01:24:35,169
- This is it.
- This is it.

1052
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,507
All right,
it's loose.

1053
01:24:47,315 --> 01:24:48,449
Shit's heavy.

1054
01:26:33,555 --> 01:26:34,821
Shit!

1055
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:36,256
Was she there?

1056
01:26:36,258 --> 01:26:37,858
No.

1057
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:39,426
Come on.

1058
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:49,670
Excuse me, sir.

1059
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:51,371
What?

1060
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,874
We're lookin' for the girl
in room 210. You seen her?

1061
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:54,908
Yeah, I've seen her.

1062
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,910
You seen her today?

1063
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:59,646
Yeah, she came down here
lookin' for a bar nearby.

1064
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:01,982
Sent her up to
that place off 61.

1065
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:08,842
Just leave it there, Mud's
going to have to help us with it.

1066
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:11,411
What are you
going to tell him?

1067
01:29:11,413 --> 01:29:13,747
I'll just tell him
the truth.

1068
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:33,800
Hey, what you
say there, Ellis?

1069
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,375
Tom left this for you.

1070
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:50,050
Where's Juniper?

1071
01:29:54,122 --> 01:29:55,989
Ellis, what happened?

1072
01:29:55,991 --> 01:29:57,991
Is she okay?

1073
01:29:57,993 --> 01:29:59,626
Was it Carver?

1074
01:30:01,829 --> 01:30:02,963
It wasn't Carver.

1075
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:05,165
What's goin' on, Ellis?

1076
01:30:07,969 --> 01:30:10,070
She was supposed to meet us
on the side of the motel.

1077
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:12,806
She never showed up.

1078
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,443
We went around
looking for her.

1079
01:30:17,645 --> 01:30:20,814
Motel clerk said she
went out to a bar on 61.

1080
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,419
We tracked her down.

1081
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:28,488
She was there
with another guy.

1082
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:31,491
They were together.

1083
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,672
She must've
thought Carver

1084
01:30:46,674 --> 01:30:48,108
was onto her.

1085
01:30:49,811 --> 01:30:51,144
She knew the plan, Mud.

1086
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,914
She just didn't show up.

1087
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,121
What was she doin'
with that guy?

1088
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:06,126
What was she doin'
with that guy, Ellis?

1089
01:31:08,162 --> 01:31:09,963
They were playing pool.

1090
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:13,033
And they were drinkin'.

1091
01:31:13,035 --> 01:31:14,167
And laughin'.

1092
01:31:16,904 --> 01:31:18,572
He was close up on her.

1093
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:24,211
He kissed her neck.

1094
01:31:38,626 --> 01:31:40,227
So that's how it is, huh?

1095
01:31:43,064 --> 01:31:44,731
We got that motor.

1096
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:52,205
What do you
want us to do?

1097
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:55,509
Just go home, Ellis.

1098
01:33:00,775 --> 01:33:02,108
Hello?

1099
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:03,243
Is May Pearl there?

1100
01:33:04,612 --> 01:33:07,047
This is Ellis.

1101
01:33:07,049 --> 01:33:10,817
I called yesterday, you
didn't give her my messages?

1102
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:12,085
I said it's Ellis.

1103
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,587
I'm her boyfriend.

1104
01:33:13,589 --> 01:33:15,989
- Oh, she's asleep...
- Mary Lee!

1105
01:33:15,991 --> 01:33:17,057
Mary Lee!

1106
01:33:17,059 --> 01:33:19,025
What the hell
have you been doin'?

1107
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:20,327
What have you
been doin'?

1108
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:21,661
Senior, damn it!
Damn it! Stop it!

1109
01:33:21,663 --> 01:33:22,729
You tell her what
you've been doin'.

1110
01:33:22,731 --> 01:33:23,997
I don't know
what you're sayin'.

1111
01:33:23,999 --> 01:33:29,035
J.J. Crawford said a boat motor
went missin' from his stockyard!

1112
01:33:29,037 --> 01:33:32,806
He said his daughter saw this
one and his friend haulin' it off!

1113
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:36,643
Now, you tell me, right now,
did you steal that motor?

1114
01:33:36,645 --> 01:33:38,111
We didn't steal it.

1115
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,679
You lie to me again.

1116
01:33:41,849 --> 01:33:43,383
We thought it was junk.

1117
01:33:43,385 --> 01:33:44,884
We didn't think
it was worth anything.

1118
01:33:44,886 --> 01:33:46,019
Ellis?

1119
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:51,024
You tellin' me
I raised a thief?

1120
01:33:51,026 --> 01:33:52,225
I'm not a thief.

1121
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:54,761
You take property
that's not yours,

1122
01:33:54,763 --> 01:33:57,631
property that belongs
to another man.

1123
01:33:57,633 --> 01:34:01,101
That junk was
his livelihood.

1124
01:34:01,103 --> 01:34:03,103
I'm ashamed of you!
Senior...

1125
01:34:03,105 --> 01:34:05,205
Shut your mouth.

1126
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:08,908
You think you can take things
and not have him see it?

1127
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:12,912
Neither one of you's got any
respect for a man's livelihood!

1128
01:34:12,914 --> 01:34:16,082
A life that puts clothes on your
back and food in your stomach!

1129
01:34:16,084 --> 01:34:18,418
Don't you
blame this on me.

1130
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:21,054
One doesn't have a thing to do
with the other and you know it.

1131
01:34:21,056 --> 01:34:23,890
You don't tell me
what I know.

1132
01:34:23,892 --> 01:34:26,092
If you can steal a man's
life out from under him

1133
01:34:26,094 --> 01:34:28,028
and think he won't take
a lesson from that,

1134
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,362
then you're dumber
than you look.

1135
01:34:29,364 --> 01:34:31,131
Stop it, Dad!
And she's raisin' you

1136
01:34:31,133 --> 01:34:33,066
a snake,
just like herself.

1137
01:34:33,068 --> 01:34:36,269
And you can curl up beside
her before I give a goddamn!

1138
01:34:36,271 --> 01:34:38,304
But you just
remember this, boy.

1139
01:34:38,306 --> 01:34:40,106
You just remember,
when they come in here

1140
01:34:40,108 --> 01:34:42,108
and they tear
this place apart

1141
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:45,245
board by board!
You hear me?

1142
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:52,018
You are a man who's never had the
strength to support his own life.

1143
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:57,991
Ellis.

1144
01:34:57,993 --> 01:35:01,194
You'll return that motor
from where you found it,

1145
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:05,065
and you'll apologize in person
to the man you took it from.

1146
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:10,136
I won't hear about
anything like this again.

1147
01:35:30,057 --> 01:35:31,891
I can't take
that motor back.

1148
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,994
But I can
pay him for it.

1149
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:36,763
I'll give him
what he wants.

1150
01:35:40,101 --> 01:35:42,235
I don't care
what you do, Ellis.

1151
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:55,381
What
the hell's all this?

1152
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:01,788
I guess he didn't care
about bein' seen.

1153
01:36:05,493 --> 01:36:07,460
He had something else on his mind.

1154
01:36:37,992 --> 01:36:39,526
What you all hidin' for?

1155
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:08,087
Found your shirt.

1156
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:11,991
You can keep it.

1157
01:37:14,995 --> 01:37:16,529
I don't need it no more.

1158
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:20,466
Saw what's left
of your bonfire.

1159
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:27,240
Somebody could have
seen you.

1160
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,379
Do some drinkin'
last night?

1161
01:37:34,348 --> 01:37:37,317
I did a lot of drinkin'
last night.

1162
01:37:37,319 --> 01:37:41,154
Neck, I'm gonna need you to stay
here and get this motor runnin'.

1163
01:37:41,156 --> 01:37:43,189
Ellis, I need you to do
somethin' else for me.

1164
01:37:44,959 --> 01:37:46,326
I need you to get
that to Juniper.

1165
01:37:48,062 --> 01:37:49,195
Okay, Mud.

1166
01:37:50,931 --> 01:37:52,098
Neck, let's go.

1167
01:37:56,337 --> 01:37:57,971
You still takin' Juniper?

1168
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,141
Neck, fetch me
that socket wrench.

1169
01:38:12,486 --> 01:38:14,087
You be all right?

1170
01:38:14,089 --> 01:38:16,022
Yeah. How about you?

1171
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:18,091
He'll be okay.

1172
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:21,060
Can I borrow your bike?

1173
01:38:21,062 --> 01:38:22,195
Yeah.

1174
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:25,064
Don't tump it.

1175
01:39:07,007 --> 01:39:09,242
I was wonderin'
when I'd see you.

1176
01:39:16,383 --> 01:39:18,151
Sorry about last night.

1177
01:39:18,153 --> 01:39:20,153
I'm supposed to
give this to you.

1178
01:39:20,155 --> 01:39:21,087
What?

1179
01:39:24,558 --> 01:39:25,692
Okay.

1180
01:39:29,697 --> 01:39:31,397
Did you read it?

1181
01:39:31,399 --> 01:39:32,532
No.

1182
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:36,336
I gotta go.

1183
01:39:36,338 --> 01:39:37,470
Ellis.

1184
01:39:39,573 --> 01:39:41,541
I said I was sorry.

1185
01:39:41,543 --> 01:39:43,209
All you had to do
was be there.

1186
01:39:43,211 --> 01:39:45,078
I couldn't.

1187
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:46,479
Then why'd you
even come here?

1188
01:39:48,048 --> 01:39:50,083
I came here
to leave with him.

1189
01:39:51,285 --> 01:39:52,418
I did.

1190
01:39:57,057 --> 01:39:59,425
You know
you don't know him, right?

1191
01:40:01,095 --> 01:40:03,429
I know he'd do
anything for you.

1192
01:40:03,431 --> 01:40:05,231
Is that what you think?

1193
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:11,371
Mud's a born liar.

1194
01:40:11,373 --> 01:40:15,541
That's why people like him, he makes
them feel good about themselves.

1195
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:25,218
I do love him.

1196
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:29,022
I just

1197
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:34,227
can't spend the rest of my
life runnin' away with him.

1198
01:40:53,814 --> 01:40:55,648
Tell him I understand.

1199
01:40:57,785 --> 01:40:59,118
What's it say?

1200
01:41:01,088 --> 01:41:02,789
Says, "It's over."

1201
01:41:08,662 --> 01:41:10,229
Bye, Ellis.

1202
01:42:32,646 --> 01:42:33,846
Did you get
my phone calls?

1203
01:42:33,848 --> 01:42:35,848
What? I've been tryin' to call you.

1204
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:38,217
Who's this guy? Get your
head out of my car, kid.

1205
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:42,522
Ellis!
I called you twice!

1206
01:42:42,524 --> 01:42:44,357
Stop it, Kyle!

1207
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:45,825
Stop it!

1208
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:46,926
Kyle!

1209
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:50,863
Stop it, Kyle!

1210
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:52,198
God!

1211
01:42:54,601 --> 01:42:55,902
What the hell you
doin' here, Ellis?

1212
01:42:55,904 --> 01:42:59,305
You can't just run up
and punch people I'm with.

1213
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:05,211
I'm sorry, I just wanted to know
why you hadn't called me back.

1214
01:43:06,847 --> 01:43:08,881
Why would I call
you back, Ellis?

1215
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:11,450
Because you're
my girlfriend.

1216
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:15,388
I'm not your girlfriend.

1217
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:16,556
We've been
on one date.

1218
01:43:16,558 --> 01:43:17,690
One.

1219
01:43:19,193 --> 01:43:20,426
Yeah, but...

1220
01:43:20,428 --> 01:43:22,929
But what?
What'd you expect, Ellis?

1221
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,833
I love you.

1222
01:43:29,737 --> 01:43:31,204
You're 14.

1223
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:38,945
I don't know.
He's just this kid.

1224
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,948
Come on, let's...

1225
01:43:49,856 --> 01:43:50,990
Try it now.

1226
01:43:52,526 --> 01:43:53,659
Nothin'.

1227
01:43:54,695 --> 01:43:56,462
Son of a bitch.

1228
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:08,474
What she say?

1229
01:44:08,476 --> 01:44:10,743
You're a liar!

1230
01:44:10,745 --> 01:44:12,845
Makin' two kids run around,
doin' all the work

1231
01:44:12,847 --> 01:44:15,348
because you're too scared
to do it yourself!

1232
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,952
Makin' me tell her it's over
because you're too scared!

1233
01:44:21,622 --> 01:44:24,624
You said you loved her
and you lied!

1234
01:44:24,626 --> 01:44:26,926
You gave up on her,
and she gave up on you!

1235
01:44:26,928 --> 01:44:28,594
Just like everybody else!

1236
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:31,797
I trusted you!

1237
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:37,570
Bonfires and crosses and
wolf's eye... Bullshit!

1238
01:44:37,572 --> 01:44:38,971
Now, come on, Ellis.

1239
01:44:38,973 --> 01:44:41,774
Every single thing
you told me was a lie!

1240
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:45,978
You never cared about her,
and you never cared about us!

1241
01:44:47,681 --> 01:44:49,048
Not enough to matter!

1242
01:44:51,985 --> 01:44:53,052
You used us.

1243
01:44:54,989 --> 01:44:56,856
You made me a thief!

1244
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:00,893
Let me talk to him.

1245
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:03,996
Ellis!

1246
01:45:08,969 --> 01:45:10,603
Ellis, come on!

1247
01:45:13,874 --> 01:45:15,474
Ellis, wait a minute.

1248
01:45:16,577 --> 01:45:17,710
Ellis!

1249
01:45:26,486 --> 01:45:27,753
Shit.

1250
01:45:28,889 --> 01:45:30,022
Mud!

1251
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,426
Ellis! He fell
in the creek!

1252
01:45:33,894 --> 01:45:35,995
He fell into the snakes!

1253
01:45:35,997 --> 01:45:37,697
Mud, please!

1254
01:46:05,525 --> 01:46:07,393
Get the motor started, Neck!

1255
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:13,799
Is he okay?
Is he bit?

1256
01:46:21,475 --> 01:46:22,608
Shit.

1257
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:27,446
What time is it?

1258
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:30,683
4:18!

1259
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:33,085
Yell it out
every 10 minutes.

1260
01:46:33,087 --> 01:46:34,520
Okay.

1261
01:46:37,691 --> 01:46:40,126
Is he going
to be okay?

1262
01:46:41,094 --> 01:46:43,062
Got to get him
to the clinic.

1263
01:46:43,897 --> 01:46:45,765
Are you bit?

1264
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:50,169
No.

1265
01:47:07,754 --> 01:47:09,655
My bike's up there!

1266
01:47:41,087 --> 01:47:43,889
Need some help here!

1267
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:45,991
Snake bite!

1268
01:47:45,993 --> 01:47:47,593
It's a snake bite!
Stay calm.

1269
01:47:47,595 --> 01:47:49,528
Cottonmouth.

1270
01:47:49,530 --> 01:47:54,467
Okay, we'll take care of him.
Let's go! Let's go, people.

1271
01:48:10,183 --> 01:48:12,618
Sir.

1272
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:14,186
We're going to need
some information from you.

1273
01:48:20,961 --> 01:48:22,161
Sir.

1274
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:30,169
Sir!

1275
01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:50,155
Hello?

1276
01:50:41,902 --> 01:50:43,035
It's okay.

1277
01:50:44,004 --> 01:50:45,204
Just sit back.

1278
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:51,377
Where am I?

1279
01:50:51,379 --> 01:50:53,712
You're home.

1280
01:50:53,714 --> 01:50:55,781
We brought you home.

1281
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:00,019
Come on, sit up.

1282
01:51:00,021 --> 01:51:01,153
Come on.

1283
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:07,960
You had us scared, son.

1284
01:51:10,964 --> 01:51:13,432
I'm so glad
you're okay.

1285
01:51:13,434 --> 01:51:15,968
The doctors
gave you some medicine.

1286
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:17,736
You had a snake bite.

1287
01:51:18,972 --> 01:51:21,040
How did I get
to the doctor?

1288
01:51:21,042 --> 01:51:23,042
A man brought you in.

1289
01:51:23,044 --> 01:51:24,977
No one knew him.

1290
01:51:25,945 --> 01:51:28,414
Oh, no, no,
it's all right.

1291
01:51:28,416 --> 01:51:31,050
You just rest now.
We'll talk about it later.

1292
01:51:33,953 --> 01:51:36,789
Do you need anything?
Are you hungry?

1293
01:51:36,791 --> 01:51:37,923
No.

1294
01:51:39,993 --> 01:51:42,728
Come on,
let him get some rest.

1295
01:51:46,966 --> 01:51:49,401
I'll be back in
to check on you.

1296
01:52:00,313 --> 01:52:02,014
Mom? Dad?

1297
01:52:03,883 --> 01:52:06,018
I love you.

1298
01:52:06,020 --> 01:52:08,020
We love you,
too, Ellis.

1299
01:52:48,428 --> 01:52:52,397
The sun does shine on a
dog's ass some days, huh?

1300
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:53,966
It ain't sunk yet.

1301
01:52:56,202 --> 01:52:58,203
Wish Ellis
could see it.

1302
01:52:58,205 --> 01:52:59,338
I know.

1303
01:53:00,340 --> 01:53:01,540
Mmm.

1304
01:53:05,812 --> 01:53:08,046
Looks like you get
your end of the deal.

1305
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:14,820
Where's the bullets?

1306
01:53:14,822 --> 01:53:18,056
Deal was for the gun,
not the bullets.

1307
01:53:18,058 --> 01:53:19,191
Shit.

1308
01:53:20,393 --> 01:53:21,527
Yeah.

1309
01:53:25,265 --> 01:53:28,033
Neck, I've got one more
favor I want to ask of you.

1310
01:54:00,366 --> 01:54:00,966
Mud?

1311
01:54:05,371 --> 01:54:07,039
Don't get up.

1312
01:54:10,243 --> 01:54:11,476
How'd you get here?

1313
01:54:13,146 --> 01:54:14,513
Neck brought me.

1314
01:54:29,128 --> 01:54:30,963
We got the boat
in the water.

1315
01:54:30,965 --> 01:54:32,631
You did?
Yeah.

1316
01:54:32,633 --> 01:54:34,566
Smooth sailing
from here on out.

1317
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:44,076
Wouldn't have felt right leavin'
town without comin' to say goodbye.

1318
01:54:48,014 --> 01:54:50,015
I'm sorry
about what I said.

1319
01:54:50,017 --> 01:54:51,516
No, you were
right to be mad.

1320
01:54:51,518 --> 01:54:53,352
You were right
about a lot of things.

1321
01:54:55,021 --> 01:54:57,322
I don't traffic in the
truth too often, but

1322
01:54:59,525 --> 01:55:01,159
I did love her.

1323
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:03,595
I do

1324
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:06,665
love her.

1325
01:55:07,634 --> 01:55:09,501
She loves you, too.

1326
01:55:09,503 --> 01:55:10,636
She said it.

1327
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:16,475
Yeah, I just made mistakes.
Heck, we both did, you know.

1328
01:55:17,677 --> 01:55:19,244
It's a hard life
to keep up with,

1329
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:23,181
can't blame her for
gettin' tired of tryin'.

1330
01:55:26,252 --> 01:55:29,187
My dad says you can't
count on women loving you.

1331
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:31,290
He said
you can't trust them.

1332
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:36,228
That's not true.

1333
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:41,633
You're a good man, Ellis.

1334
01:55:43,603 --> 01:55:47,072
You meet a girl half as good as
you, you're going to be all right.

1335
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,144
You're a good man, too, Mud.

1336
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:55,714
No.

1337
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:00,452
No, I ain't, Ellis.

1338
01:56:00,454 --> 01:56:02,054
Maybe from here
on out, I can...

1339
01:56:13,967 --> 01:56:15,534
Stay put.

1340
01:56:15,536 --> 01:56:18,303
Ellis!

1341
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:22,007
Don't move.

1342
01:56:50,303 --> 01:56:51,436
Mud!

1343
01:56:57,043 --> 01:56:58,477
Let him go.

1344
01:57:02,081 --> 01:57:03,448
You still
down there, buddy?

1345
01:57:03,450 --> 01:57:05,717
Yeah.
All right, stay put.

1346
01:57:44,290 --> 01:57:46,124
Flush him out this way.

1347
01:58:08,081 --> 01:58:09,147
Mud!

1348
01:58:13,252 --> 01:58:15,087
Mud!

1349
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:16,254
Aah!

1350
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,129
Mud!

1351
01:58:26,732 --> 01:58:28,166
Mud!

1352
01:58:30,703 --> 01:58:32,104
- Mud!
- Ellis!

1353
01:58:32,106 --> 01:58:33,238
Ellis!

1354
01:58:35,174 --> 01:58:36,842
Ellis. Ellis.

1355
01:58:39,512 --> 01:58:40,645
It's okay.

1356
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,193
Hello?

1357
02:00:02,428 --> 02:00:04,196
You're speaking to him.

1358
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:13,471
He's dead?

1359
02:01:44,497 --> 02:01:45,630
Hey.

1360
02:01:46,866 --> 02:01:48,033
You got your bike back?

1361
02:01:48,035 --> 02:01:49,934
Yeah.

1362
02:01:49,936 --> 02:01:51,569
Mud dinged
the shit out of it.

1363
02:01:56,075 --> 02:01:57,876
They're really doing it.

1364
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:02,480
It's the law.

1365
02:02:03,749 --> 02:02:04,883
It's bullshit.

1366
02:02:07,753 --> 02:02:08,887
They ever find Tom?

1367
02:02:10,022 --> 02:02:11,890
No. He's gone.

1368
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:16,061
I heard on the news,

1369
02:02:17,963 --> 02:02:19,898
they still hadn't
found Mud's body.

1370
02:02:21,634 --> 02:02:23,335
You think he's dead?

1371
02:02:25,504 --> 02:02:26,938
I don't know.

1372
02:02:26,940 --> 02:02:28,073
I hope not.

1373
02:02:32,511 --> 02:02:34,012
I gotta go.

1374
02:02:34,014 --> 02:02:36,381
Come by the apartments
later, help me fix up my room.

1375
02:02:36,383 --> 02:02:37,515
All right.

1376
02:03:54,493 --> 02:03:55,627
I'll see you next week?

1377
02:03:56,762 --> 02:03:58,096
You betcha.

1378
02:04:03,135 --> 02:04:04,936
Ellis.

1379
02:04:04,938 --> 02:04:07,071
You mind
your mother, okay?

1380
02:04:07,073 --> 02:04:08,773
This is a big change
for her, too.

1381
02:04:09,742 --> 02:04:12,043
She's gonna
need your support.

1382
02:04:12,045 --> 02:04:12,977
Yes, sir.

1383
02:04:14,213 --> 02:04:15,547
All right.

1384
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:21,920
I love you.

1385
02:04:26,759 --> 02:04:27,892
I love you, too.

1386
02:06:09,261 --> 02:06:10,995
Come on, son.

1387
02:06:11,931 --> 02:06:13,298
You gotta see this.
