這樣吧  穿這個  唇色用酒紅色
I'm thinking, with this, if we have burgundy lips,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,630
你知道吧  頭髮往後梳緊
you know, hair pulled back tight...

21
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,880
-用銀色可以嗎  -好的  我明白了

我其實在研究薇薇安的裙子
I was actually looking at some of Vivian's dresses,

25
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,460
然後我畫了一些草圖  你可以幫我看一下嗎
and I drew up some sketches I'd love for you to take a look at.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,170
你幹好自己的本職工作就好
Please just stick to the chart.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,340
好的  但是我覺得這個點子很棒
Okay, but they're, like, cool ideas.

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,590
就是  我是說  我想
Just... I mean, I think.

29
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,820
-聽我說說  -親
-Just hear me out. -Honey,

30
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,520
我們請你來不是讓你來思考的
we're not paying you to think.

31

大家好  我們很榮幸
Hey, everyone, it's our pleasure

00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,410
繼續吧
Keep it going.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
明白
Got it.

36
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,720
妝畫的不錯
Makeup went well. It had...

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
你知道的  這風格曾經流行過
You know, it had its moments.

38
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,610
蘇蘇
Suzu.

39

我偷了兩大包化妝品

42

你一定會贏這場選美比賽

43
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,280

好萊塢大名鼎鼎的化妝師
My Hollywood makeup artist.

45
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,200
好的  愛你  開車不聊了  拜拜

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,150
瞧瞧我們
Look at us.

50
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,150
我比你發育的早多了
I grew boobs way before you did.

51
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,780
但是我現在還在發育期啊
Girl, I'm still trying to grow boobs.

52
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,960
那倒是
That's true.

53
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,790
明天選美的事幾點開始啊
Hey, what time do we start that pageant thingy stuff tomorrow?

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,170
明早9點
9:00 in the morning.

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,370
光是排練就整整花了3天
Then there's rehearsals for three days.

56
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,960
-然後還要試裙子  -蘇蘇
-Then fit the dresses. -Suzu!

57
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,460
在陽台
Balcony!

58
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,550
我餓了
I'm hungry.

59
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,810
歌莉婭
Gloria!

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,350
我最喜歡的小鮮肉
There's my favourite little dude.

61
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,260
-不算小了  你都長大了  -是啊
-"Little"? You're huge. -Yeah.

62
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,400
你終於回提華納了
You finally came back to Tijuana.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,230
是啊  我還給你帶了禮物
Yeah, and I brought you something.

64
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,980
是什麼
What is it?

65
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,430
我的天啊
Holy shit!

66
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,240
噘嘴貓
Potty mouth.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,860
這個我在好萊塢見過
It's the one we saw in Hollywood!

68
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,360
我還以為你忘了
I thought you forgot about it.

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,650
-我怎麼會  -我覺得你應該
-Come on. -Well, you should practice

70
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,340
跟歌莉婭多練練英語  別讓她白來一趟
your English with Gloria. Take advantage.

71
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,120
是她應該多練練西班牙語呢  這樣
She should practice Spanish. Maybe she won't

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,910
她就不會一開口就暴露自己是遜遜的美國人了
sound like a lame American.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,290
他說的很對
He's right.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,750
呃哦  姐姐  你好大的啤酒味啊
Guacala, sister. You smell like beer.

It's in the microwave.

77

不是  我只是陪朋友來的
No, I'm... I'm not registering.

81
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,060
我不這麼認為
I didn't think so.

82
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,070
你說什麼
What did you say?

83
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,560
-我就是跟她說  -你不能這樣跟我的朋友說話
-I'm just saying to her... -You cannot talk to my friend like that.

-Good luck. -Thank you.

86
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,570
你怎麼總是喜歡跟人吵架
You always get into fights.

87
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,630
-如果我贏了  -當你贏了之後
-If I win this thing... -"When" you win this thing.

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,250
當我贏了之後
When I win this thing,

89
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,120
那我跟察瓦的生活將會大有變化
it's gonna be really good for Chava and I.

90
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,260
當然了
Sure.

91
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,640
就這樣  自然的眼妝加上個深色的唇色
Okay, so I went with a very natural eye and a dark lip.

92
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,300
修飾一下
Touching up.

93
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,430
就做了一點改動
Just a little different,

94
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,930
就完全不一樣了
but you're done.

95
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,740
好啦  我有東西給你
Okay. I've got something for you.

96
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,820
友誼手鏈
Friendship bracelets.

97
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,610
得了吧
Stop it.

98
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,290
這樣好幼稚啊
Like when we were kids.

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,370
戴好了
There you go.

100
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,630
我特別開心你能來這
Hey. I'm so happy that you're here.

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,430
你知道嗎  我本來覺得我
You know, I didn't really think

102
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,800
不可能再回到提華納了
I was gonna be able to come back to Tijuana.

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,840
因為我覺得我完全不屬於這裡
'Cause I always felt like such a stranger here.

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,340
但是你總是讓我覺得我在這裡是有家的
But you always make me feel like I have family,

105
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,470
所以我要謝謝你
so thank you.

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,230
傻妞  你就是我的家人啊
Girl, you are my family.

107
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,230
沒錯
Yes.

108
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,070
好了  我們得走了  準備驚艷四座吧
Okay, we need to get going, 'cause we got people to impress.

109
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,580
你來嗎
Are you coming?

110
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,160
真的嗎  好  小心點
Really? Okay. Careful.

111
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,910
我認識他
I know him...

112
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,490
別這樣
No.

113
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,450
好吧
Okay.

114
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,240
姐們  別說你沒看到他
Dude, tell me you saw him.

115
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,660
看到了
Yes.

116
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,380
乾杯
Cheers.

117
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,630
可以請你跳舞嗎
Shall we dance?

118
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,970
抱歉  不行
No. No.

119
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,090
好吧
Okay.

120
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,380
所以我們到底是來跟誰混臉熟的
So, who do we have to rub elbows with?

121
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,720
我們趕快行動吧
Let's get it moving.

122
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,560
那邊  就是他
Over there. That's him.

123
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,440
那個就是紹賽多局長
Okay, that's Chief Saucedo.

124
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,010
都說比賽就是他出資搞的
He supposedly finances the contest,

125
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,140
據說他會跟贏得選美比賽的冠軍上床
and they say he sleeps with whoever wins the pageant.

126
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,900
那你還想贏嗎
And you're still trying to win this pageant?

127
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,650
小妞  這只是個傳言
Girl, it's just a rumour.

128
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,020
-噁心  -你才噁心  小妞  我們過去吧
-Ew. -"Ew," you. Girl, let's go.

129
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,110
這個可愛的小姐姐是誰啊
And who's this lovely girl?

130
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,490
這是我朋友歌莉婭
This is my friend Gloria.

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,590
紹賽多局長管理著警察局
Chief Saucedo runs the state police.

132
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,330
那只是我的個人愛好而已
That's just my hobby.

133
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,560
我對生活真正的激情在於美的追求
My real passion in life is beauty.

134
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,640
不好意思  等一下
I... Will you just give me one minute?

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
我想去趟洗手間
I have to go to the bathroom.

136
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
檢查一下格間
Check the stalls.

137
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
裡諾
Lino.

138
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,830
求求你
Please. Please.

139
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,590
要什麼都拿走
You can have everything.

140
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,380
求求你
Please. Please.

141
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,310
都給你  要什麼都給你
Take it all. You can have everything.

142
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,010
你是美國人嗎
You're American?

143
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,730
想活命嗎
Do you want to stay alive?

144
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,820
想

你幹什麼  你們要幹什麼
What are you doing? What are you doing?

299
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,750
不  不  不  不  不

為什麼給我戴手銬

為什麼我會在這裡  這是哪  我可是美國公民
Why am I here? Where am I? I'm an American citizen.

你為拉埃斯特雷利亞工作多久了

304
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,140
我根本不知道你在說什麼
I don't know what that is. I don't know what you're talking about.

305
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,690
我是來找我的朋友蘇蘇的

306
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,100
她在千年俱樂部失蹤了

你是裡諾 埃斯帕扎的女朋友嗎

313
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,620
你根本沒在聽我說
You're not listening to me.

314
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,040
我是美國公民  我知道我的權利

315
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,950
我要求被帶到美國大使館去
I want to be taken to the US embassy!

316
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,210
領事館已經知道你的事了  歌莉婭
Consulate already knows about you, Gloria.

317
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,640
我叫布瑞恩 瑞奇
My name is Brian Reich,

318
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,480
是禁毒署的探員

319
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,760
這些加密的無線手機
Now, these are encrypted radio cell phones

320
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,470
只有埃斯帕扎和他的同夥在在用
that only Esparza and his people use.

321
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600
誰都跟蹤不到這些手機
They can't be tracked.

322
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,520
現在  你告訴我他給了你一個
So, you're telling me that he gave you one of these

323
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,650
可他甚至都不認識你
and he doesn't even know you?

324
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,370
這是你嗎
Is this you?

325
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,120
我當時不知道車裡有炸彈
I didn't know that there was a bomb in the car.

326
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,370
是因為這個你才和裡諾混在一起嗎
Did it make you feel important to be hanging out with Lino?

327
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,920
-什麼  不是的  -我理解你
-What? No. -I get it.

328
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,100
你是個無名小卒

-來自破碎的家庭  -不是的

331
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,930
這時你遇到了這個狡猾的傢伙
Then along comes this slick guy.

332
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,020
他就像是在向你炫耀他很有錢似的
He's, like, flashing money around,

333
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,220
他在給你錢花

334
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,610
-給你買新衣服  -不是的  不要再說了
-and nice dresses. -No, please.

-He's from Tijuana. You lived there... -No.

336
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,030
和他在一起還挺開心的  對吧
He sounds like a fun time, right?

337
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,160
我與此事無關
I didn't have anything to do with this.

338
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
求你了  你一定要相信我
Please, you have to believe me.

339

-不  -看看他們

他們是我的朋友  是真正的美國人
Those are my friends. Those are real Americans.

我們可以  以恐怖襲擊  謀殺和縱火的罪名起訴你
We have you on charges of terrorism, murder, arson.

350
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,760
你知道你會被判多久嗎
You know how long you'll go away for?

三十年  四十年  五十年
30, 40, 50 years,

352
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,310
除非你幫助我們
unless you help us.

353
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,410
這是一個跟蹤芯片
This is a tracking chip,

354
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,780
把它放在電池槽內  就像這樣
and it goes in the battery shelf, like this.

355
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,240
你試試看
You try it.

356
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,030
來吧試一試
Go ahead.

357
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,120
繼續
There you go.

358
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,420
完美
Perfect.

359
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,840
就是這樣
Bingo.

360
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,380
你要把這個芯片
You are taking this chip

361
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,870
放在裡諾 埃斯帕扎的手機裡
and putting it in Lino Esparza's cell phone.

362
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
不
No.

363
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,790
不  請不要再逼我回去了  求求你
No, please don't make me go back there. Please.

364
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,590
聽我說  歌莉婭  我希望是你所說的是實話
Look, Gloria, if what you say is true, and I hope it is,

365
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,890
但是你必須證明給我看
you're gonna have to prove it.

366
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,680
所以  拿著芯片
So, you're gonna take that chip

367
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,730
無論如何都要把它安在他的手機上
and plant it on his phone however you can.

368
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,650
從現在開始  你不幫我們
Now, if we don't hear from you,

369
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,690
我就會告訴裡諾  說他那裡有一個禁毒署的間諜
then I'll make sure Lino knows he has a DEA mole in his group.

370
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,160
如果你敢從他身邊逃跑
And if somehow you manage to escape him,

371
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,440
我就會把你扔進美國監獄
I'll feed you to the US prison system.

372
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,530
歌莉婭  這是你的手機
Gloria, here's your phone.

373
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,530
在他們集體檢查時  要確保裡面沒有芯片
Make sure there's no chip in it when they gather for checkup,

374
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,200
不然這就是我們最後一次見到你
or else it'll be the last time we hear from you.

375
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,930
這是我的手機號碼
This is my phone number.

376
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,420
記住它
Memorise it.

377
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,300
他們會想知道
They're gonna want to know

378
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,750
你去了哪裡  所以
where you've been this whole time, so just...

379
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,220
就告訴裡諾你害怕了  逃跑了  好嗎
Just tell Lino that you got scared and ran away, okay?

380
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,970
你準備好了的話就開機
Whenever you're ready, just turn it on,

381
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,680
他會馬上找到你的  好嗎
and then he'll find you, okay?

382
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,680
給你打車錢
For a taxi.

383
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,240
聽我說
Listen to me.

384
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,240
有一場戰爭將在提華納爆發
There is a war going on right now in Tijuana.

385
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,950
你能否活下來  完全取決於你自己
Whether or not you survive is entirely up to you.

386
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,200
如果你幫我們暴露裡諾的位置  我就會把你安全地帶離此地
You give us Lino's location, I will get you out of here safe.

387
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,200
那我的朋友蘇蘇呢
What about my friend Suzu?

388
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,670
我是你和你朋友之間最清晰的道路
I'm the clearest path between you and your friend.

389
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,070
如果你還想再見到她的話
You ever want to see her again,

390
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,420
那就做好你該做的事
you better do what you need to do.

391
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,640
祝你好運
Good luck.

392
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:40,970

394
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,240

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,740
察瓦  你回來了
Chava? You're home.

396
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,490
你舊手機是怎麼回事
What's with your old-ass phone?

397
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,750
連遊戲都沒有
It doesn't even have games on it, dude.

398
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,280
別亂動  把手機給我

00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:43,330
不要再關機了
Don't ever turn off the phone again.

402
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,920
歌莉婭  你怎麼了
Gloria, what's happening?

403
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,350
露皮塔阿姨還住在市中心嗎
Does your Tia Lupita still live downtown?

404
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,180
蘇蘇去哪了啊  歌莉婭
Where's Suzu, Gloria?

405
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,650

聽我說  一切都會好起來的

413
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,970
我害怕了
I was scared.

414
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,930
你最好別對我撒謊
You better not be lying to me.

415
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,140
那是你兒子嗎
Is that your son?

416
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,850
不  他是我的養子
No, it's my godson.

417
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,870
求求你不要傷害他

-What? -There's no one here to get me.

I don't see anyone. There's no SWAT van.

566
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,720

用榴彈發射器

573
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,020
地面二分隊  別讓他們跑了

在牆那裡把他們攔下
Cut them off at the wall.

576
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,930
靠

00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,080
該死的外國佬
Pinche gringa.

578
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,640
那些警察怎麼知道我們會去那
How did the state police know we would be there?

579
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,810
你知道嗎
Do you know?

580
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,310
他們怎麼會準備的如此精密
How were they so ready?

581
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,770
他們居然有狙擊手
They had a sniper.

582
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,140
你這個小婊子
You bitch!

583
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,510
嘿  別叫她婊子
Hey! Don't you call her a bitch.

584
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:41,770
好嗎  她剛救了我的命  夥計
Okay? She saved my life back there, man.

585
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,990
因為她別無選擇
Because she had to.

586
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,240
聽說我  裡諾
Listen to me, Lino.

587
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,870
有人跟緝毒局通風報信了

588
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:49,690
-他說的沒錯  裡諾  -什麼
-He's right, Lino. -What?

589
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,620
吉米讓我告訴你  有個緝毒局的間諜
Jimmy told me to tell you that the DEA has a mole.

590
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:55,500
一個叛徒  在  在你的組織裡

這都是你的錯

592
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,840
什麼
What?

593
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,130
我告訴過你要幹掉布瑞恩 瑞奇
I told you to get Brian Reich.

594
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:08,920
我確實幹掉瑞奇了

595
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,720
告訴過你要處理好緝毒局
Told you to handle the DEA.

596
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,020
那是你的工作

597
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,640
我們死的人算你頭上
Our dead men are on you.

598
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:21,180
是你害死他們的
Their blood is on your hands.

599
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,070
你要哭了嗎
You gonna cry?

600
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,620
我們從朋友那借到這個地方
We borrowed this place from some friends.

601
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:42,840
你看起來糟透了
You look like shit.

602
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,580
去找件衣服穿吧
Find some clothes.

603
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,960
他們這應有盡有
They got some good stuff.

604
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:00,980
我很幸運
I got lucky.

605
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,560
布瑞恩 瑞奇是誰
Who was Brian Reich?

606
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,610
你怎麼知道這個名字
How do you know that name?

607
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,520
你剛才說的啊  我
You said it earlier. I...

608
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,710
他是緝毒局的人
He's with the DEA.

609
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,710
那個混蛋
That piece of shit.

610
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:25,580
沒錯  但剛才開槍射我們的是警察
Yeah, but that was the police shooting at us.

611
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,590
不管是瑞奇還是紹賽多的人  都一樣
Reich or Saucedo's guys, it's the same thing.

612
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,970
都不乾淨    他們是衝著我來的
They're all dirty, and they're coming after me.

613
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:36,390
知道嗎  我曾經掌管整個提華納地區
See, I used to run Tijuana,

614
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:40,600
全世界最大的邊境區

615
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,730
所有進出的東西都得先經過我們
Everything that came in and out came through us,

616
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:47,020
這就是我們洛星幫
Los Estrellas.

617
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,490
但現在  紹賽多想從我這奪走它
And now, Saucedo is trying to take it from me.

618
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,830
你覺得我是壞人嗎
You thought I was a bad guy?

619
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,320
我只是以牙還牙罷了
I'm just playing their game, chula.

620
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,070
-那為什麼  -提問到此結束
-So, then why would... -That's enough with the questions.

621
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,550
到廚房幫忙去吧
Go help in the kitchen.

622
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,860

所有人上交手機
I need all your cell phones.

626
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,120
你在這做什麼
What are you doing here anyway?

627
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:46,410
你是裡諾的女人嗎
Are you Lino's girl or something?

628
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,580
他上你了嗎
Has he had you yet?

629
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,340
裡諾綁架了我
Lino abducted me,

630
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,130
他們威脅我  說要殺死我朋友的弟弟
and they're threatening to kill my friend's little brother.

631
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:54,920
這就是我在這的原因  可以了嗎
That's why I'm here. Okay?

632
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:57,880
我也不是自願待在這的
I didn't choose to be here, either.

633
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:59,140
他們威脅我的家人
They threatened my family.

634
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,940
他們佔有了我
They own me.

635
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,020
不要相信他們說的任何話
You cannot trust anything they say.

636
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:10,100
你的手機呢
Your phone?

637
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,190
給  你這混蛋
Here's my cell, asshole.

638
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,890
忘了你的朋友吧  歌莉婭
Forget your friend, Gloria.

639
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:17,280
沒人會來救你的

640
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,920
你的手機
Your phone.

641
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,830
我們只是在清掃房間
We're doing some housecleaning.

642
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,680
波伊托是這的僕人
Pollito here is the maid.

643
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,430
他很擅長清除這件事  你懂我的意思吧

好了
Okay.

657

你去哪了
Where were you?

658
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,550
你幹什麼去了
What were you doing?

659
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:17,450
我去廁所了
I was just in the bathroom.

660
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,000
發生什麼了嗎
What happened?

661
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,500
你就這麼猴急著要上床嗎
You couldn't wait to get laid?

662
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,050
你幹什麼去了  湯都燒乾了
What are you doing? The pozole is ruined.

668
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:32,020

If you run into a thing like we ran into yesterday,

669
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,840
你必須得學會保護你自己

你得學會用這個

671
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:42,110
從它開始吧

672
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:45,570
AR-15步槍

子彈  這些是子彈

677
01:05:57,740 --> 01:05:59,660
子彈能解決所有問題

678
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,840
把子彈裝進彈匣

679
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:08,670
然後把彈匣裝回去

687
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:45,370
你不會總是像昨天那麼幸運的
You're not gonna be as lucky as you were yesterday.

688
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,090
不不不  不對
No, no, no, no, no.

689
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,350
先卸彈匣

690
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,350
很好
There you go.

691
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,850
你得扣動扳機
You got to press it.

692
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,280
好
All right.

693
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:15,070
頂住肩膀
Against your shoulder.

694
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:21,990
不不不  不對
No, no, no.

695
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,420
兩隻眼睛都得睜開  好嗎
You got to keep both eyes open, okay?

696
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,500
你得用視力好的那只來瞄準
You got to use your dominant eye.

697
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:31,760
因為如果不這樣  如果你閉錯眼
'Cause if you don't... 'Cause if you close the wrong one,

698
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,850
那你就看不到目標了

699
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:35,250

Empty it out.

704
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:47,990
蘇蘇的事怎麼辦
What about Suzu?

705
01:08:51,750 --> 01:08:53,670
我派了維丘在查
My boy Wicho is on it.

706
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,080
他是我的技術人員  能力一流
He's my IT guy, and he's real good.

707
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:58,460
他查過醫院和停屍房了
He's checked the hospitals and the morgues,

708
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,460
沒找到她  所以說明她還活著
and she's not there, so that means she's alive.

709
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:05,180
聽著  我說過我會找到她的
Listen, I told you I'd find her.

710
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,100
現在  我
For now, I'd...

711
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,640
我想讓你先去沖個澡
I'd like you to take a shower.

712
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,700
你喜歡嗎
You like it?

713
01:10:00,490 --> 01:10:01,910
我們這是去哪
Where are we going?

714
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:20,100
裡諾
Lino.

715
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,230
裡諾
Lino!

716
01:10:30,350 --> 01:10:32,310
我們剛烤好
We just finished the barbecue.

717
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,310
太棒了  我餓了
Perfect, I'm hungry.

718
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,030
我給你留了張桌子  在那
I have a table for you over here.

719
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:37,860
見到你真是太高興了
It's so great to see you.

720
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,490
你看起來好瘦  怎麼不多吃點啊
You look really skinny. Why don't you eat?

721
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:53,210
你以前吃過烤肉嗎
You had barbacoa before?

722
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,800
不行
Nah.

723
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,470
肯定不如這個
Not like this one.

724
01:10:58,750 --> 01:10:59,750
試試
Come on.

725
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:02,010
-給  -我不餓
-Here. -I'm not hungry.

726
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:03,290
你肯定餓了
You got to be hungry.

727
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:12,390
怎麼樣
So?

728
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:15,850
好吃
It's good.

729
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,030
只是好吃嗎
Just "good"?

730
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:24,280
我就知道
That's what I thought.

731
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,450
你就應該這麼吃烤羊肉才對
That's how you eat some barbacoa, guey.

732
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:32,160
這就對了嘛
That is what I am talking about.

733
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:33,590
我不客氣了
Let's go.

734
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,850
你知道嗎  我在這裡長大的
I grew up around here, you know?

735
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:50,760
一直到我六七歲的時候才離開
Till I was about six or seven.

736
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,730
我來到美國後還會時不時夢到這裡
I used to just dream about this place when I was back in the US.

737
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,770
我非常想回到這裡
I wanted to come back so bad.

738
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,440
你懂那種感覺嗎  就感覺像是
You know, I just never felt like

739
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,940
這裡是我的根啊
I belonged anywhere.

740
01:12:07,030 --> 01:12:09,030
然後我和我媽媽被驅逐出境
Then my moms and I got deported,

741
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,880
但當我回來時  墨西哥人看我像個外國人
and when I was back, I was too gringo to be Mexican,

742
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,870
我看他們也像是外國人
too Mexican to be gringo.

743
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,800
所以沒辦法  我必須硬氣一些
So, I had to be tough.

744
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:23,250
我慢慢學會如何得到我想要的
And I learned to get what was mine.

745
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:29,670
總有一天  我要買下這附近的所有土地
One day, I'm gonna buy all the land around here.

746
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,760
打算在這裡建一個大農場
I could just build a big ranch.

747
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:35,400
靠這片土地和滿地的肥料生活著
Live off the land and shit.

748
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
嘿
Hey.

749
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:55,370
我們找到告密者了
We found the snitch.

750
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,740
大家都在等你
Everybody's waiting.

751
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:09,810
這婊子還挺有脾氣的
Bitch had it in her battery.

752
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:31,400
伊莎貝爾
Isabel.

753
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:40,000
洛星幫絕不容忍
Los Estrellas will not stand

754
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:45,170
任何叛徒和膽小鬼
for cowardice or treason con cualquiera.

755
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:52,970
別  不要
No, no.

756
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,510
別  別
No, no, no.

757
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,730
奇沃
Chivo.

758
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:57,680
不  不  別這樣
No, no, no, no, no.

759
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,400
讓我跟他解釋  裡諾  別這麼做
Let me just talk to him. Lino, no!

760
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,820
不能這麼做啊  不能
You can't. No.

761
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:02,720
讓我跟他說一句話
Please let me talk to him.

762
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:05,190
求你了  別攔著我了
Please. Let me go back.

763
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:07,350
求求你讓我過去吧
Let me go back, please.

764
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:10,620
不要
No.

765
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,360
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

766
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,510
聽我說  小妞
Listen, chula.

767
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:10,340
有時為了生存  你不得不弄髒自己的手
Sometimes, you have to do terrible things to survive.

768
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,850
只有這樣  未來才會有希望
Tomorrow's gonna be better.

769
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,720
我保證
I promise.

770
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:22,560
睡一覺吧
Just get some sleep.

771
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,230
好受些了嗎
Feeling better?

772
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,630
今天對你來說可是個大日子
You have a big day ahead of you.

773
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,660
唐娜 露西塔來了哦
Dona Rosita is here.

774
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:31,750
嗨
Hey.

775
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,930
米拉  看這件
Mira, this.

776
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,510
這件配你會很搭的
This will fit you just right.

777
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,650
穿上試試看吧
Try them on.

778
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:46,150
-什麼意思  -這都是為你準備的
-What? -These are for you.

779
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,470
一切都是為了今天
Okay? For today.

780
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:52,350
你想從我這裡得到什麼呢
What do you want from me?

781
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:53,980
你到底想幹什麼
What do you want?

782
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:56,120
-冷靜點  小妞  -不  我沒法冷靜
-Calm down, chula. -No, I'm not going to calm down.

783
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,950
聽明白了麼  我想知道你到底要作什麼妖
All right? I want to know what this is all about!

784
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,940
趕緊告訴我  告訴我你到底想幹什麼
I want to know! Tell me what's going on!

785
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:03,360
嘿  冷靜點  你可是我的心肝寶貝
Hey, hey. You're gonna be my queen.

786
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:07,340
我要送你去參加  加州小姐的選美大賽
I'm gonna send you to the Miss Baja California pageant.

787
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:09,240
什麼  你說什麼
What? What?

788
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:11,500
不要  我不會去參加的
No. No, I don't want to do this.

789
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,090
不行  我真不想去
No. I don't... I don't want to go.

790
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,580
我不想再呆在這裡了
I want to leave right now.

791
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:15,960
-先聽我說  -我不聽
-Listen to me. -No.

792
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:18,430
想讓我聽你說嗎  我不會的
Listen to you? I can't.

793
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,680
我不會聽的  我再也不會聽你的鬼話了
I can't. I can't do this any more.

794
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:21,820
到頭來你就會
You're just gonna end up killing me

795
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,130
像殺了那個女人一樣殺了我  對吧
like you killed that other woman, okay?

796
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:24,720
不如你給我個痛快吧  動手吧
So, just kill me, then!

797
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:26,980
-我要離開這兒  -求你聽我說完
-I want to go. -Please! Listen to me.

798
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,440
我不聽  你放開我  你放開
No! Just let me go! Let me...

799
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,320
別擋著我  行嗎
Get out of my way!

800
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,540
有些東西需要你先看一看
There's something you need to see.

801
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,250
誰給你這個的
Where did you get this?

802
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,420
你知道拉斐爾 紹賽多是誰嗎
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

803
01:17:58,090 --> 01:17:59,300
到底誰給你這個的
Where did you get this?

804
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:02,300
我問你  知道拉斐爾 紹賽多是誰嗎
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

805
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,730
知道  他是警察局長
Yeah, he's the chief of police.

806
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,560
是個腐敗的垃圾
He's also a corrupt piece of shit.

807
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,220
你朋友在他的手裡
He has your friend. Yeah.

808
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,780
那些警察在槍戰之後把她帶走了
The police, they took her the night after the shootout.

809
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,810
他們公然賣淫  辦淫亂聚會
They run girls, throw parties.

810
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,030
他們一直都在這麼做
They always have.

811
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,370
你到底從裡弄到這個視頻的
Where did you get this from?

812
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,610
維丘
Wicho.

813
01:18:20,610 --> 01:18:24,030
他假扮成一個嫖客  警察就把錄像發了過來
He posed as one of the johns, and they sent him that video.

814
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,210
呵
Yeah.

815
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,370
他們要她參加紹賽多的聚會
They're offering her up for Saucedo's after-party.

816
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,030
那幫人把她都訂滿了
They got her all booked up.

817
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,840
她可忙著呢
She's all busy.

818
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:35,040
一整晚呢
All night.

819
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,390
我也不想給你看這個的
Sorry you had to see this.

820
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,060
你得做出決斷了
You can decide.

821
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,900
紹賽多是我的敵人  正如他也是你的敵人一樣
Saucedo is my enemy, as he is yours.

822
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,570
至於你的朋友
And your friend,

823
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,450
她今晚會去參加聚會的
she's gonna be there tonight.

824
01:19:03,530 --> 01:19:06,110
同樣今晚也是把她撈出來的良機
Tonight's your chance to get her back.

825
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:08,620
該怎麼做
How?

826
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,420
紹賽多總是邀請選美冠軍參加他的聚會
Saucedo always invites the winner of the pageant to his party.

827
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,260
我要他單獨呆在臥室裡
I need him alone in the bedroom.

828
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,920
不對
No.

829
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,670
不對  你是  你是要讓我
No. You... You want me to...

830
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:29,300
我要讓他能有機會對你為所欲為
I want you to do whatever it takes.

831
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,780
這是能撈出你朋友的唯一辦法
This is how you get your friend back.

832
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:01,370
奇沃會全程協助的
Chivo will be with you the whole way.

833
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,100
現在
Now,

834
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:10,550
現在我要你記住我說的話  小妞
I need you to listen carefully, chula.

835
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,740
為了達成這個目的
For this to work out,

836
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,950
你必須相信自己生而為冠軍
you need to believe that you belong up there.

837
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,380
你只需要看起來自信滿滿就行了
You just have to look confident.

838
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,180
我這邊買通了裁判
We bought the judges.

839
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:53,220
甚至買通了整個場子
Everyone works for us now.

840
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,440
好好加油
Play your part.

841
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,670
歡迎來到加利福尼亞選美小姐現場
...Miss Baja California.

842
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,460
