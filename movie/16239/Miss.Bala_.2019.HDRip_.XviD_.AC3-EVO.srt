1
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,916
I'm thinking, with this,
if we have burgundy lips,

2
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,634
you know, hair pulled back tight...

3
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,884
- Can I get the silver?
- Okay, okay. I got it.

4
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:31,515
You... Okay. All right.

5
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,100
Hey, Justin, sorry to bother you.

6
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:36,969
I was actually looking
at some of Vivian's dresses,

7
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,465
and I drew up some sketches
I'd love for you to take a look at.

8
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,178
Please just stick to the chart.

9
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:43,348
Okay, but they're, like, cool ideas.

10
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,597
Just... I mean, I think.

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,822
- Just hear me out.
- Honey,

12
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:48,529
we're not paying you to think.

13
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,870
Hey, everyone, it's our pleasure

14
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,162
to welcome Vivian Chan back
to Fashion Week Los Angeles.

15
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:05,997
Okay.

16
00:02:08,337 --> 00:02:09,417
Keep it going.

17
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:12,129
Got it.

18
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,721
- Makeup went well.
- It had...

19
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,207
You know, it had its moments.

20
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,611
Suzu.

21
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,977
You on your way?

22
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,238
Yes.

23
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,279
And I stole two bags of makeup.

24
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,074
Yeah! You are winning this pageant.

25
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,287
Of course.
'Cause you're my secret weapon.

26
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,499
My Hollywood makeup artist.

27
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,209
Okay, I love you. I'm driving. Bye.

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:12,533
Welcome to Mexico.

29
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,313
Suzu.

30
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,159
Look at us.

31
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,159
I grew boobs way before you did.

32
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,787
Girl, I'm still trying to grow boobs.

33
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:09,964
That's true.

34
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,797
Hey, what time do we start
that pageant thingy stuff tomorrow?

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,170
9:00 in the morning.

36
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,376
Then there's rehearsals for three days.

37
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,967
- Then fit the dresses.
- Suzu!

38
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,465
Balcony!

39
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:22,553
I'm hungry.

40
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,811
Gloria!

41
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,354
There's my favourite little dude.

42
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,269
- "Little"? You're huge.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:31,403
You finally came back to Tijuana.

44
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,230
Yeah, and I brought you something.

45
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:34,984
What is it?

46
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,436
Holy shit!

47
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,241
Potty mouth.

48
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:40,861
It's the one we saw in Hollywood!

49
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,368
I thought you forgot about it.

50
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,659
- Come on.
- Well, you should practice

51
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,346
your English with Gloria.
Take advantage.

52
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,120
She should practice Spanish.
Maybe she won't

53
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,915
sound like a lame American.

54
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,291
He's right.

55
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,753
Guácala, sister. You smell like beer.

56
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,337
Okay, little brother.
I made you papas con chorizo.

57
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,722
It's in the microwave.

58
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,430
Hello, good afternoon.

59
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,728
Sign here please.

60
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,770
You?

61
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,438
No, I'm... I'm not registering.

62
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:19,066
I didn't think so.

63
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,072
What did you say?

64
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,566
- I'm just saying to her...
- You cannot talk to my friend like that.

65
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,367
Okay, Suzu. Yeah, vámonos.

66
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,997
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,575
You always get into fights.

68
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,630
- If I win this thing...
- "When" you win this thing.

69
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,255
When I win this thing,

70
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,126
it's gonna be really good
for Chava and I.

71
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:39,263
Sure.

72
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:45,643
Okay, so I went with a very natural eye
and a dark lip.

73
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,307
Touching up.

74
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,433
Just a little different,

75
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:53,938
but you're done.

76
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,741
Okay. I've got something for you.

77
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,825
Friendship bracelets.

78
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:10,619
Stop it.

79
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,294
Like when we were kids.

80
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,379
There you go.

81
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,634
Hey. I'm so happy that you're here.

82
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,435
You know, I didn't really think

83
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,801
I was gonna be able
to come back to Tijuana.

84
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,848
'Cause I always felt
like such a stranger here.

85
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,349
But you always make me feel
like I have family,

86
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,475
so thank you.

87
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,234
Girl, you are my family.

88
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,233
Yes.

89
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:46,071
Okay, we need to get going,
'cause we got people to impress.

90
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,581
Are you coming?

91
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,163
- Really?
- Okay. Careful.

92
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,918
I know him...

93
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:32,493
No.

94
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,450
Okay.

95
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,245
Dude, tell me you saw him.

96
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,667
Yes.

97
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,384
Cheers.

98
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,630
Shall we dance?

99
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,975
- No.
- No.

100
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,093
Okay.

101
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,388
So, who do we have to rub elbows with?

102
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,720
Let's get it moving.

103
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,560
Over there. That's him.

104
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,442
Okay, that's Chief Saucedo.

105
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,019
He supposedly finances the contest,

106
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,145
and they say he sleeps
with whoever wins the pageant.

107
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,903
And you're still trying
to win this pageant?

108
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,655
Girl, it's just a rumour.

109
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,027
- Ew.
- "Ew," you. Girl, let's go.

110
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,117
And who's this lovely girl?

111
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,498
This is my friend Gloria.

112
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,595
Chief Saucedo runs the state police.

113
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,338
That's just my hobby.

114
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,560
My real passion in life is beauty.

115
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,644
I... Will you just give me one minute?

116
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:39,727
I have to go to the bathroom.

117
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,686
Check the stalls.

118
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,043
Lino.

119
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,839
Please. Please.

120
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,592
You can have everything.

121
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,381
Please. Please.

122
00:09:57,681 --> 00:09:59,311
Take it all. You can have everything.

123
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,015
You're American?

124
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,732
Do you want to stay alive?

125
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:06,824
Yes.

126
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,979
You never saw us.

127
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,284
Come on.

128
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,029
Saucedo is in the VIP section.

129
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,662
You got 10 seconds to get out of here.

130
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,990
Salte, gringa.

131
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,670
- Hey.
- Suzu!

132
00:10:26,418 --> 00:10:27,588
Suzu!

133
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Suzu!

134
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,050
Suzu! Suzu!

135
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,773
Suzu!

136
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,994
Suzu!

137
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,652
Suzu, come on, please. Pick up.

138
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,829
...assassination attempt
on Chief Saucedo...

139
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,214
God.

140
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,011
Excuse... Excuse me, sir.

141
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,682
My friend is inside.

142
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,801
All right, you can't come in here.
You can't come in here.

143
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,507
- No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Go. Go.

144
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,618
This is Suzu. Leave your message.

145
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,826
Suzu, I'm at the diner across the street
from the Millenium Club.

146
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,377
If you get this,
please meet me here, okay?

147
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,264
Hospital Angeles Tijuana.

148
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,932
I'm trying to find a friend
who was in the Millenium Club.

149
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,683
What's your friend's name?

150
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:26,928
Suzu Ramos.

151
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,095
Let me check.

152
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,188
Nobody by that name has been admitted.

153
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,598
Chava.

154
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,431
It's Gloria.

155
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,984
When are you guys coming back?

156
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,521
You know what, Suzu's phone died,
so she just wanted me to call you

157
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,186
and tell you that we're gonna
be a little late, okay?

158
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,995
Tell her I'm taking
the lunch money from her dresser.

159
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,278
I will.

160
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,862
- Bye.
- Bye.

161
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,295
Excuse me.

162
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,255
I can't find my friend

163
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,918
and I need your help, please.

164
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,506
You have to go to the station.
Fill out a report.

165
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,014
Okay. I was at
the Millenium Club last night,

166
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,264
and I saw the men who did this,
and I just... I really need your help.

167
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,677
Fine. Get in.

168
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,767
Thank you.

169
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,399
Go ahead, señorita.

170
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,486
Tell me everything that happened.

171
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,571
These guys came
into the bathroom with guns.

172
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,447
One of them had the sides
of his head shaved.

173
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,044
Another one had green eyes.

174
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,408
One second.

175
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:16,077
Twenty, I'm here with a forty-one.
An American.

176
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,840
Says she saw the men at the Millenium.

177
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,340
Let me check with Number One.

178
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,841
Copy. Standing by.

179
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,589
When we get to the station,

180
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,388
I want you to tell them
everything you saw.

181
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,323
We are almost there.

182
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,034
I'm just going to pick up my lunch.

183
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,679
Prep the other truck.

184
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,483
How's it going, Doña Rosita?

185
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,479
Welcome to Casa Rosita.

186
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,984
He's inside.

187
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:22,501
My grandparents built this house
back in the '40s.

188
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,474
That's my brother.

189
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,551
He wants to sell it,
but I want to keep it for the family.

190
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,463
This is a mistake.

191
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,962
I only wanted to find my friend.

192
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,989
You tell me lies, I'm going to hurt you.

193
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,162
Okay?

194
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,874
I'm not gonna lie.

195
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,030
You with the DEA?

196
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,368
No.

197
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,075
You talk like a pocha.

198
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,174
What's your deal?

199
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,298
I grew up in the States.

200
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,919
I... I lived here for a few years.

201
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,756
My father is American,

202
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,841
and he owned a factory,
a maquiladora, here.

203
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,218
Where's the maquiladora?

204
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,354
It's gone.

205
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,517
And your father?

206
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,809
Gone, too.

207
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,516
Then why are you here?

208
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,355
I just came to visit my friend.

209
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,245
"Suzu. Suzu Ramos."

210
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,159
I'm gonna keep these for a while.

211
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,748
Okay?

212
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,336
I can help you find your friend.

213
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,260
But you have to do something
for me first.

214
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,767
You do that,
and I'll help you find Suzu.

215
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,732
You mess around, and I'll kill you both.

216
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,188
- Say "yes."
- Yes.

217
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,780
Okay, chula.

218
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,454
We're going to be
real good friends, you and I.

219
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,412
You ever been to Bakersfield?

220
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,456
Bakersfield?

221
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,042
Ey.

222
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,455
Bakersfield, California.

223
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:15,173
No.

224
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,377
I'm from Bakersfield.

225
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,756
I'm American, like you.

226
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,758
Grew up in both places, like you.

227
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,810
The trucks are ready.

228
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,594
Leave that on
and follow my instructions.

229
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,203
All right, stay with us, pochita.

230
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,281
Come on, keep up.

231
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,576
- Run the light.
- What?

232
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,989
Come on, keep up! Keep up!
Don't slow down.

233
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,705
All right, turn right on this corner.

234
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,798
Park the car real close to the curb.

235
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,477
Take your phone and meet us up the hill.

236
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,049
Hey.

237
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,400
Good job, chula.

238
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,030
Nice driving back there.

239
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,493
Tucán. The remote.

240
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:47,948
Watch this, bitches.

241
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:50,998
Check this out, chula.

242
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,764
What?

243
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:13,774
Don't be sad. Hey.

244
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,646
Those bitches had it coming.

245
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,195
Hey, hey, hey.

246
00:23:21,527 --> 00:23:23,357
Seems like she doesn't like barbecue.

247
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,515
Let's get out of here.

248
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,183
What were you doing last night
at the Millenium?

249
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:51,679
My friend, she wanted to get
connected for the pageant.

250
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,849
The Miss Baja California pageant?

251
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:54,934
Yes.

252
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,564
Who do we know at the pageant?

253
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,897
Okay. Figure it out.

254
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,787
Why are we here?

255
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:16,287
You said you wanted to be
in the contest,

256
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,963
so now you're in the contest.

257
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,171
I... That's... That's not what I want.

258
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,255
I want to find my friend Suzu.
That's what I want.

259
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,009
We'll find your friend, chingada madre.

260
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,189
You can reach me with this.

261
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,350
Don't lose it.

262
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,023
Don't turn it off.

263
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,148
Take her to register, Pollo.

264
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,945
Let go of her arm.

265
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:02,502
Have fun.

266
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,725
Can I see your left profile, please?

267
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:16,771
Now the right?

268
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,774
Very good. Face forward.

269
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:28,109
Girls, let's welcome Gloria
to the contest, please.

270
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,866
Have you seen my friend, Suzu?

271
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,744
No. I'm sorry.

272
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,004
- Where's your restroom?
- It's down the hallway.

273
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:41,539
Okay.

274
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,975
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

275
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,556
Can't I just have a second

276
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:05,266
to go to the restroom
in privacy, please?

277
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,375
Hey! Hey!

278
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,066
Hey!

279
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,531
- Are you okay?
- No.

280
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,359
Excuse me. Excuse me.

281
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:55,196
Are you American?
Please, I'm... I'm an American.

282
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,992
I've been abducted. They're chasing me.

283
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,865
What are you doing? What are you doing?

284
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,752
No, no, no, no! No!

285
00:27:18,514 --> 00:27:19,564
Why am I in handcuffs?

286
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:22,482
Why am I here? Where am I?
I'm an American citizen.

287
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,439
I've been abducted. Please.

288
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,401
How long you been working
for La Estrella?

289
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,145
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,693
I'm looking for my friend Suzu.

291
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:32,106
She went missing at the Millenium Club.

292
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:35,454
- My name is Gloria Fuentes. I'm an...
- I know who you are. I know who you are.

293
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,701
You're Gloria Fuentes, born in 1991.

294
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,203
You're a...

295
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,744
A makeup artist.

296
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,464
Are you Lino Esparza's girlfriend?

297
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,626
You're not listening to me.

298
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:51,045
I'm an American citizen.
I know my rights!

299
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,959
I want to be taken to the US embassy!

300
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,218
Consulate already knows
about you, Gloria.

301
00:27:57,845 --> 00:28:00,645
My name is Brian Reich,

302
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,482
and I'm an agent with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

303
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,768
Now, these are encrypted
radio cell phones

304
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,476
that only Esparza and his people use.

305
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:12,607
They can't be tracked.

306
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,528
So, you're telling me
that he gave you one of these

307
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,655
and he doesn't even know you?

308
00:28:21,702 --> 00:28:23,372
Is this you?

309
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,129
I didn't know that there
was a bomb in the car.

310
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:37,375
Did it make you feel important
to be hanging out with Lino?

311
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,927
- What? No.
- I get it.

312
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,102
You're a nobody from nowhere.

313
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,176
- A broken home.
- No.

314
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,636
You have nothing.

315
00:28:45,726 --> 00:28:47,936
Then along comes this slick guy.

316
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,023
He's, like, flashing money around,

317
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,228
and he's giving you toys

318
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,613
- and nice dresses.
- No, please.

319
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,277
- He's from Tijuana. You lived there...
- No.

320
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,032
He sounds like a fun time, right?

321
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,164
I didn't have anything to do with this.
Please, you have to believe me.

322
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,081
- Okay. Look.
- You have to believe me. Please.

323
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,620
Look, look, look, look.

324
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:07,713
The building that you blew up
is a DEA safe house.

325
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,999
Okay, no. Look at 'em.

326
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,002
Look. Look, look. Look at these guys.

327
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,254
- Now, three DEA agents...
- No.

328
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:14,457
...are dead because of you.

329
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,006
There they are. Look at 'em.

330
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,379
- No.
- Look at 'em.

331
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:19,626
Those are my friends.
Those are real Americans.

332
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:24,757
We have you on charges
of terrorism, murder, arson.

333
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,768
You know how long you'll go away for?

334
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,940
Thirty, 40, 50 years,

335
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,310
unless you help us.

336
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:41,411
This is a tracking chip,

337
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,780
and it goes in
the battery shelf, like this.

338
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:46,245
You try it.

339
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,035
Go ahead.

340
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,120
There you go.

341
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:53,424
Perfect.

342
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:56,844
Bingo.

343
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,382
You are taking this chip

344
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,875
and putting it
in Lino Esparza's cell phone.

345
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:01,968
No.

346
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,799
No, please don't make me
go back there. Please.

347
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:08,598
Look, Gloria, if what you say is true,
and I hope it is,

348
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:09,894
you're gonna have to prove it.

349
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:11,687
So, you're gonna take that chip

350
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,730
and plant it on his phone
however you can.

351
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:15,651
Now, if we don't hear from you,

352
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,692
then I'll make sure Lino knows
he has a DEA mole in his group.

353
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,161
And if somehow you manage to escape him,

354
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,449
I'll feed you to the US prison system.

355
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,539
Gloria, here's your phone.

356
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,536
Make sure there's no chip in it
when they gather for checkup,

357
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,208
or else it'll be the last time
we hear from you.

358
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:42,930
This is my phone number.

359
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:44,425
Memorise it.

360
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:46,304
They're gonna want to know

361
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:47,758
where you've been
this whole time, so just...

362
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:50,228
Just tell Lino that you
got scared and ran away, okay?

363
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:55,687
Whenever you're ready, just turn it on,
and then he'll find you, okay?

364
00:30:57,608 --> 00:30:58,688
For a taxi.

365
00:31:01,153 --> 00:31:02,243
Listen to me.

366
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:05,241
There is a war going on
right now in Tijuana.

367
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,952
Whether or not you survive
is entirely up to you.

368
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:12,206
You give us Lino's location,
I will get you out of here safe.

369
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,208
What about my friend Suzu?

370
00:31:15,292 --> 00:31:16,672
I'm the clearest path
between you and your friend.

371
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,422
You ever want to see her again,
you better do what you need to do.

372
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,642
Good luck.

373
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,976
Suzu?

374
00:31:42,236 --> 00:31:43,396
Chava?

375
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:46,816
Chava?

376
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,245
Hey, Gloria.

377
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,740
Chava? You're home.

378
00:32:29,825 --> 00:32:31,495
What's with your old-ass phone?

379
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,752
It doesn't even have games on it, dude.

380
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,289
Shh, give me the phone.

381
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:36,372
Give me the phone.

382
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,923
Gloria?

383
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,339
Don't ever turn off the phone again.

384
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,929
Gloria, what's happening?

385
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,351
Does your Tía Lupita
still live downtown?

386
00:32:57,978 --> 00:32:59,188
Where's Suzu, Gloria?

387
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,653
Where's my sister?

388
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:02,902
Suzu's gonna be fine.

389
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,533
You hear me? Everything's gonna be fine.

390
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:06,400
I just need you to go pack up
a bag of clothes.

391
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,106
You know what, I'll go with you.
Let's go do this. Come on.

392
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,616
I'm gonna call you a cab.
Meet me downstairs.

393
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,371
- Okay?
- Okay.

394
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,216
Why did you run away?

395
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:35,973
I was scared.

396
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,937
You better not be lying to me.

397
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,148
Is that your son?

398
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,856
No, it's my godson.

399
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:51,872
Please don't hurt him.

400
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,123
Please don't hurt him.

401
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:03,376
Hi.

402
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,631
What an elegant kid.

403
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:19,227
Come here, come here.

404
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:24,231
Do you have a cell phone?

405
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:28,991
Okay.

406
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,779
Okay, okay, okay.

407
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:34,033
Now,

408
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:37,913
you go back to your room, okay?

409
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,655
It isn't my house.

410
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:09,689
Go to your bedroom.
Wait for me over there.

411
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,186
Go to your room! Okay?

412
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,720
I've been running all day.

413
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,601
Take my boots off.

414
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:27,396
Please.

415
00:36:45,205 --> 00:36:46,365
Please don't hurt the kid.

416
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,301
I'll do whatever you want.

417
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,959
Just please don't hurt him.

418
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,348
Well,

419
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:07,311
there is something
that I need you to do.

420
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:10,809
You do that for me,

421
00:37:11,273 --> 00:37:12,983
and I'll make sure the kid's safe.

422
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,487
Okay.

423
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:19,862
We have a deal?

424
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,407
Yes.

425
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,078
Now, take off your clothes.

426
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:28,918
What?

427
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:30,499
Take your clothes off.

428
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,763
Go on.

429
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:27,853
What?

430
00:38:27,933 --> 00:38:28,933
Lino.

431
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:48,793
I don't trust that woman.

432
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,254
They won't be looking for her,
an American,

433
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:55,376
a gringa.

434
00:38:55,586 --> 00:38:57,876
You worry about the DEA,

435
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:00,923
I'll worry about her.

436
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:04,015
Ruben's dead.

437
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,228
Take these pesos for the funeral.

438
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:55,516
Lay down.

439
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:10,044
Back in Bakersfield,

440
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,624
at Whitney High,

441
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:17,832
I met a girl like you.

442
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:25,469
Samantha.

443
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:29,967
That was her name.

444
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:34,811
Samantha.

445
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,023
She was pretty.

446
00:40:40,607 --> 00:40:41,777
Like you.

447
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,237
Never smiled.

448
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,070
Just like you.

449
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,292
Gloria.

450
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:58,978
Hey, you're gonna drive to San Diego.

451
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,267
To the address that I put on the GPS.

452
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:05,607
When you get to the border,
you got to make sure

453
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:08,112
that you look at
the customs guys in the eyes.

454
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,990
Don't do anything stupid.

455
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,236
When you're on your way back,
just call us.

456
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:16,367
We'll tell you where to meet.

457
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,913
You said you wouldn't hurt the kid.

458
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:20,956
So then, send him away.

459
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Please.

460
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:43,392
This cab's gonna take you
to Tía Lupita's, okay?

461
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,355
Stay with the kid.

462
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280
Chava, look at me.

463
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,576
I'm gonna find Suzu.

464
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,503
Okay? I promise you.

465
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:02,583
Don't forget to put on your seat belt.

466
00:43:25,189 --> 00:43:26,519
Listen up, gringa.

467
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:31,365
If, for any reason,

468
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:36,415
whether it's an accident or intentional,

469
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:40,326
you get caught running away
with our stuff...

470
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:45,254
Or if you do anything stupid.

471
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:49,628
I'm gonna grab this knife,

472
00:43:50,923 --> 00:43:54,683
and I'm gonna gut that little kid
like a chicken.

473
00:43:58,805 --> 00:43:59,805
Got it?

474
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:02,350
Got it.

475
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
Drive safe.

476
00:44:14,488 --> 00:44:17,028
The route guidance will start now.

477
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:43,426
What am I doing? What am I doing?

478
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:44,887
Buenos días, good morning.
How we doing today?

479
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,437
- I'm okay. I'm good.
- What's wrong?

480
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,850
You're better than okay.
You woke up today.

481
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:49,228
- You are blessed.
- Yeah. You're right.

482
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:50,364
You know, tomorrow's
not promised to anyone.

483
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,940
Just waking up,
it's a blessing within itself.

484
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:53,485
- You are right.
- But look, ma'am.

485
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:54,899
I'm just here to cheer up your day.

486
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,892
These owls right here will look at you
at night and watch you sleep.

487
00:44:57,906 --> 00:44:59,066
- I'm good, gracias.
- Okay.

488
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:04,118
Yeah, go on, bring 'em in.

489
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:10,215
Ma'am, I need you
to step out of the car, please.

490
00:45:14,131 --> 00:45:16,761
Turn around, ma'am. Manos atrás, please.

491
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:50,039
Hi.

492
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:51,706
Passport.

493
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,350
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

494
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:25,241
Continue straight ahead to destination.

495
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:38,916
Continue straight ahead to destination.

496
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:02,361
Turn it off.

497
00:47:05,868 --> 00:47:07,038
Open it up.

498
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:23,512
- Where's the rest?
- Under the car.

499
00:47:24,178 --> 00:47:25,598
On the passenger side.

500
00:47:37,024 --> 00:47:38,024
Come on in.

501
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:40,816
You take the van.

502
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:54,615
It's all there.

503
00:47:55,918 --> 00:47:57,668
I need to get a message to Lino.

504
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,263
Are you listening?

505
00:48:01,673 --> 00:48:02,723
I want you to tell him

506
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:06,639
Jimmy said the DEA has a mole
in his operation.

507
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:09,176
You got it?

508
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:10,394
I got it.

509
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:13,771
Get out of here.

510
00:48:22,986 --> 00:48:24,066
Thank you.

511
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,200
Hello?

512
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:32,004
Meet us at the bullring parking lot,
right over the border,

513
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,829
and take the Cantera Street exit.

514
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:35,424
Got it.

515
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,500
Great. Who do I call?

516
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:49,102
- Yes.
- I've got something for you,

517
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:51,639
but I want to know
that you'll protect me.

518
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:52,973
I said I would.

519
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,848
What are you doing in San Diego?

520
00:48:56,186 --> 00:48:58,646
They had me pick up weapons for them.

521
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:00,905
Where's the drop-off?

522
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:03,233
- The bullring parking lot.
- In Tijuana?

523
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:07,491
Okay. We're heading to the bullring.

524
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:08,573
We want Esparza.

525
00:49:08,657 --> 00:49:11,077
If he's there, send me a text message
with the word "ox."

526
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,409
Do not send a message
until you have visual confirmation.

527
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,786
How do I get out?

528
00:49:16,582 --> 00:49:18,752
Get to the double yellow gates
next to the ocean exit,

529
00:49:18,834 --> 00:49:21,214
and there will be a SWAT van
on the other side to pull you out.

530
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:22,345
You got it?

531
00:49:24,631 --> 00:49:26,221
Double yellow gates. Got it.

532
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:34,624
That's Pollo.

533
00:51:13,156 --> 00:51:14,866
Keep your eyes on the perimeter.

534
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:33,933
Front SUV.

535
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:02,710
As soon as you see Lino, take the shot.

536
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,619
The girl could get hit in the crossfire.

537
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,578
I said take the shot.

538
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,300
Watch out, boss!

539
00:52:24,895 --> 00:52:25,905
Shoot.

540
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:29,438
Move in! Move in!

541
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:36,445
Stay down! Move it!

542
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,110
No. No!

543
00:53:11,191 --> 00:53:12,191
Help!

544
00:53:19,825 --> 00:53:22,335
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

545
00:53:30,711 --> 00:53:31,711
Hello?

546
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,545
- What?
- There's no one here to get me.

547
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,840
I don't see anyone. There's no SWAT van.

548
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:39,723
Sorry, Gloria. You're on your own.

549
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,020
No! No!

550
00:53:57,196 --> 00:53:59,026
Cover me, Chivo!

551
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:17,468
No!

552
00:54:19,593 --> 00:54:20,593
Omar.

553
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:07,847
Go!

554
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:14,648
Grenade launcher!

555
00:55:18,986 --> 00:55:21,026
Ground Force Two, do not let them out!

556
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:26,485
Grenade!

557
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:46,427
Cut them off at the wall.

558
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:55,936
Fuck!

559
00:56:21,548 --> 00:56:23,088
Pinche gringa.

560
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,643
How did the state police know
we would be there?

561
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:28,811
Do you know?

562
00:56:29,723 --> 00:56:31,313
How were they so ready?

563
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:32,771
They had a sniper.

564
00:56:34,019 --> 00:56:35,149
You bitch!

565
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:37,519
Hey! Don't you call her a bitch.

566
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:41,778
Okay? She saved my life back there, man.

567
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,990
Because she had to.

568
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:44,240
Listen to me, Lino.

569
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,871
Someone is giving information
to the DEA.

570
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:49,699
- He's right, Lino.
- What?

571
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:52,620
Jimmy told me to tell you
that the DEA has a mole.

572
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:55,504
A traitor in your... In your group.

573
00:57:03,841 --> 00:57:05,131
This is your fault.

574
00:57:05,843 --> 00:57:06,843
What?

575
00:57:06,927 --> 00:57:08,927
- I told you to get Brian Reich.
- But I did kill Reich.

576
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,722
Told you to handle the DEA.

577
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:13,022
That was your job.

578
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,643
Our dead men are on you.

579
00:57:16,937 --> 00:57:21,187
Their blood is on your hands.

580
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:25,072
You gonna cry?

581
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,620
We borrowed this place
from some friends.

582
00:57:41,253 --> 00:57:42,843
You look like shit.

583
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,589
Find some clothes.

584
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:48,337
They got some good stuff.

585
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:00,981
I got lucky.

586
00:58:04,526 --> 00:58:05,566
Who was Brian Reich?

587
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:09,610
How do you know that name?

588
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:12,529
You said it earlier. I...

589
00:58:16,413 --> 00:58:17,713
He's with the DEA.

590
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,715
That piece of shit.

591
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,586
Yeah, but that was the police
shooting at us.

592
00:58:25,672 --> 00:58:28,592
Reich or Saucedo's guys,
it's the same thing.

593
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:31,974
They're all dirty,
and they're coming after me.

594
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:36,395
See, I used to run Tijuana,

595
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:40,605
the biggest border in the world.

596
00:58:41,104 --> 00:58:44,734
Everything that came in and out
came through us,

597
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,026
Los Estrellas.

598
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:52,494
And now, Saucedo is trying
to take it from me.

599
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,831
You thought I was a bad guy?

600
00:58:57,788 --> 00:58:59,328
I'm just playing their game, chula.

601
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:02,076
- So, then why would...
- That's enough with the questions.

602
00:59:09,174 --> 00:59:10,554
Go help in the kitchen.

603
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,865
Hey.

604
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,151
My name is Isabel.

605
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,284
Start chopping.

606
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,543
I need all your cell phones.

607
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:43,125
What are you doing here anyway?

608
00:59:44,918 --> 00:59:46,418
Are you Lino's girl or something?

609
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:49,585
Has he had you yet?

610
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:51,340
Lino abducted me,

611
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:53,135
and they're threatening
to kill my friend's little brother.

612
00:59:53,218 --> 00:59:54,928
That's why I'm here. Okay?

613
00:59:56,096 --> 00:59:57,886
I didn't choose to be here, either.

614
00:59:57,973 --> 00:59:59,143
They threatened my family.

615
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:01,942
They own me.

616
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:09,028
You cannot trust anything they say.

617
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,109
Your phone?

618
01:00:10,194 --> 01:00:11,194
Here's my cell, asshole.

619
01:00:11,278 --> 01:00:12,898
Forget your friend, Gloria.

620
01:00:15,741 --> 01:00:17,281
No one's coming to save you.

621
01:00:30,923 --> 01:00:31,923
Your phone.

622
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:34,836
We're doing some housecleaning.

623
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,684
Pollito here is the maid.

624
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,430
He's real good at cleaning, you know?

625
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,411
Smells good, baby.

626
01:00:57,491 --> 01:00:58,621
Where's your phone?

627
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,910
Right here.

628
01:01:09,127 --> 01:01:10,207
Okay.

629
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,170
Keep chopping, Gloria.

630
01:01:14,258 --> 01:01:15,258
Chop, chop.

631
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,400
Okay.

632
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:19,073
Okay, okay, okay.

633
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:23,743
No.

634
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,250
Hey.

635
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:35,214
Please, please, please, please, please.

636
01:02:40,469 --> 01:02:41,469
Shit.

637
01:02:47,434 --> 01:02:48,644
Okay.

638
01:03:12,876 --> 01:03:14,126
Where were you?

639
01:03:14,211 --> 01:03:15,551
What were you doing?

640
01:03:15,629 --> 01:03:17,459
I was just in the bathroom.

641
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,010
What happened?

642
01:03:23,095 --> 01:03:24,725
You couldn't wait to get laid?

643
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,350
What are you doing?
The pozole is ruined.

644
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,232
Find that mole.

645
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,573
Get up.

646
01:04:24,114 --> 01:04:25,204
Get up.

647
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:49,604
Walk.

648
01:05:02,569 --> 01:05:04,859
- Where are we going?
- We're almost there.

649
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:05,987
Stop.

650
01:05:28,095 --> 01:05:32,025
If you run into a thing
like we ran into yesterday,

651
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:34,846
you gotta learn how to defend yourself.

652
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:40,865
You gotta learn how to use one of these.

653
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:42,111
Here's an erre.

654
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:45,575
An AR-15 rifle.

655
01:05:46,321 --> 01:05:48,451
Made in the USA.

656
01:05:50,659 --> 01:05:51,699
Press on this button here.

657
01:05:51,785 --> 01:05:53,155
It's a magazine.

658
01:05:54,663 --> 01:05:57,043
La bala, the bullet.

659
01:05:57,749 --> 01:05:59,669
La bala settles everything.

660
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:03,843
You pop it into the magazine right here.

661
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,678
Then you slide the magazine back in.

662
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:10,879
Then you pull the charging handle.

663
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:15,097
Here's your safety.

664
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,314
Thumb down, safety off.

665
01:06:18,478 --> 01:06:20,478
Thumb up, safety on.

666
01:06:21,231 --> 01:06:22,321
All right?

667
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:32,203
Now you try it.

668
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:40,957
Come on.

669
01:06:42,628 --> 01:06:45,378
You're not gonna be
as lucky as you were yesterday.

670
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,098
No, no, no, no, no.

671
01:06:56,183 --> 01:06:57,353
Magazine first.

672
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:00,351
There you go.

673
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:10,856
You got to press it.

674
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:13,281
All right.

675
01:07:13,659 --> 01:07:15,079
Against your shoulder.

676
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:21,999
No, no, no.

677
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,421
You got to keep both eyes open, okay?

678
01:07:24,503 --> 01:07:26,503
You got to use your dominant eye.

679
01:07:27,714 --> 01:07:31,764
'Cause if you don't...
'Cause if you close the wrong one,

680
01:07:31,844 --> 01:07:33,854
then you're not gonna be able
to see your target.

681
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:35,259
There we go.

682
01:07:35,347 --> 01:07:36,927
Keep both eyes open.

683
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:03,826
Here.

684
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,260
Try it again.

685
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:20,644
Empty it out.

686
01:08:46,668 --> 01:08:47,998
What about Suzu?

687
01:08:51,757 --> 01:08:53,677
My boy Wicho is on it.

688
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,089
He's my IT guy, and he's real good.

689
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:58,468
He's checked the hospitals
and the morgues,

690
01:08:58,555 --> 01:09:00,465
and she's not there,
so that means she's alive.

691
01:09:03,477 --> 01:09:05,187
Listen, I told you I'd find her.

692
01:09:07,606 --> 01:09:09,106
For now, I'd...

693
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,645
I'd like you to take a shower.

694
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:57,705
You like it?

695
01:10:00,492 --> 01:10:01,912
Where are we going?

696
01:10:19,094 --> 01:10:20,104
Lino.

697
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,230
Lino!

698
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,315
We just finished the barbecue.

699
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,319
Perfect, I'm hungry.

700
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:36,031
I have a table for you over here.

701
01:10:36,111 --> 01:10:37,861
It's so great to see you.

702
01:10:39,031 --> 01:10:41,491
You look really skinny.
Why don't you eat?

703
01:10:51,502 --> 01:10:53,212
You had barbacoa before?

704
01:10:54,713 --> 01:10:55,803
Nah.

705
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:57,471
Not like this one.

706
01:10:58,759 --> 01:10:59,759
Come on.

707
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:02,014
- Here.
- I'm not hungry.

708
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:03,295
You got to be hungry.

709
01:11:11,396 --> 01:11:12,396
So?

710
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:15,856
It's good.

711
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:18,034
Just "good"?

712
01:11:23,075 --> 01:11:24,285
That's what I thought.

713
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,450
That's how you eat some barbacoa, güey.

714
01:11:27,538 --> 01:11:32,168
That is what I am talking about.

715
01:11:32,543 --> 01:11:33,593
Let's go.

716
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,850
I grew up around here, you know?

717
01:11:48,058 --> 01:11:50,768
Till I was about six or seven.

718
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,730
I used to just dream about this place
when I was back in the US.

719
01:11:57,568 --> 01:11:59,778
I wanted to come back so bad.

720
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,449
You know, I just never felt like

721
01:12:04,867 --> 01:12:05,947
I belonged anywhere.

722
01:12:07,035 --> 01:12:09,035
Then my moms and I got deported,

723
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:13,881
and when I was back,
I was too gringo to be Mexican,

724
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:15,879
too Mexican to be gringo.

725
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:19,800
So, I had to be tough.

726
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:23,256
And I learned to get what was mine.

727
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,677
One day, I'm gonna buy
all the land around here.

728
01:12:29,766 --> 01:12:31,766
I could just build a big ranch.

729
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:35,402
Live off the land and shit.

730
01:12:45,324 --> 01:12:46,324
Hey.

731
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,376
We found the snitch.

732
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:56,749
Everybody's waiting.

733
01:13:08,305 --> 01:13:09,815
Bitch had it in her battery.

734
01:13:30,369 --> 01:13:31,409
Isabel.

735
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:40,004
Los Estrellas will not stand

736
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:45,178
for cowardice or treason con cualquiera.

737
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:52,975
No, no.

738
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:54,518
No, no, no.

739
01:13:54,601 --> 01:13:55,731
Chivo.

740
01:13:56,436 --> 01:13:57,686
No, no, no, no, no.

741
01:13:57,771 --> 01:13:59,401
Let me just talk to him. Lino, no!

742
01:13:59,481 --> 01:14:00,821
You can't. No.

743
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,729
Please let me talk to him.

744
01:14:02,818 --> 01:14:05,198
Please. Let me go back.

745
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,359
Let me go back, please.

746
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,625
No.

747
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:16,366
Oh, my God.

748
01:14:17,207 --> 01:14:18,287
Oh, my God.

749
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:06,514
Listen, chula.

750
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:10,343
Sometimes, you have to do
terrible things to survive.

751
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:14,854
Tomorrow's gonna be better.

752
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:17,727
I promise.

753
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:22,564
Just get some sleep.

754
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:17,238
Feeling better?

755
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:23,630
You have a big day ahead of you.

756
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:26,669
Doña Rosita is here.

757
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:31,756
Hey.

758
01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,930
Mira, this.

759
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,518
This will fit you just right.

760
01:16:42,603 --> 01:16:43,653
Try them on.

761
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:46,153
- What?
- These are for you.

762
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,475
Okay? For today.

763
01:16:50,277 --> 01:16:52,357
What do you want from me?

764
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:53,988
What do you want?

765
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:56,122
- Calm down, chula.
- No, I'm not going to calm down.

766
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,950
All right? I want to know
what this is all about!

767
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,946
I want to know! Tell me what's going on!

768
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:03,368
Hey, hey. You're gonna be my queen.

769
01:17:04,374 --> 01:17:07,344
I'm gonna send you to the
Miss Baja California pageant.

770
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:09,249
What? What?

771
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:11,508
No. No, I don't want to do this.

772
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,090
No. I don't... I want to go.

773
01:17:13,258 --> 01:17:14,588
I want to leave right now.

774
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:15,966
- Listen to me.
- No.

775
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:18,433
Listen to you? I can't.

776
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:20,682
I can't. I can't do this any more.

777
01:17:20,766 --> 01:17:23,136
You're just gonna end up killing me
like you killed that other woman, okay?

778
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:24,727
So, just kill me, then!

779
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:26,981
- I want to go. Please!
- Listen to me.

780
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:29,444
No! Just let me go! Let me...

781
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:31,325
Get out of my way!

782
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,540
There's something you need to see.

783
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,255
Where did you get this?

784
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:57,426
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

785
01:17:58,095 --> 01:17:59,305
Where did you get this?

786
01:17:59,388 --> 01:18:02,308
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

787
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,735
Yeah, he's the chief of police.

788
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:06,560
He's also a corrupt piece of shit.

789
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:09,229
He has your friend. Yeah.

790
01:18:09,314 --> 01:18:12,784
The police, they took her
the night after the shootout.

791
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:15,815
They run girls, throw parties.

792
01:18:15,904 --> 01:18:17,034
They always have.

793
01:18:17,114 --> 01:18:18,374
Where did you get this from?

794
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:19,618
Wicho.

795
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:24,037
He posed as one of the johns,
and they sent him that video.

796
01:18:24,121 --> 01:18:25,211
Yeah.

797
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:28,379
They're offering her up
for Saucedo's after-party.

798
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:31,038
They got her all booked up.

799
01:18:31,503 --> 01:18:32,843
She's all busy.

800
01:18:33,755 --> 01:18:35,045
All night.

801
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:44,390
Sorry you had to see this.

802
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,065
You can decide.

803
01:18:53,233 --> 01:18:55,903
Saucedo is my enemy, as he is yours.

804
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:58,572
And your friend,

805
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:01,455
she's gonna be there tonight.

806
01:19:03,535 --> 01:19:06,115
Tonight's your chance to get her back.

807
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:08,621
How?

808
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,420
Saucedo always invites
the winner of the pageant to his party.

809
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:19,263
I need him alone in the bedroom.

810
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:21,926
No.

811
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:26,676
No. You... You want me to...

812
01:19:27,226 --> 01:19:29,306
I want you to do whatever it takes.

813
01:19:33,941 --> 01:19:35,781
This is how you get your friend back.

814
01:19:59,216 --> 01:20:01,376
Chivo will be with you the whole way.

815
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:05,102
Now,

816
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:10,555
I need you to listen carefully, chula.

817
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:19,743
For this to work out,

818
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:23,953
you need to believe
that you belong up there.

819
01:20:31,665 --> 01:20:33,385
You just have to look confident.

820
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:42,185
We bought the judges.

821
01:20:51,268 --> 01:20:53,228
Everyone works for us now.

822
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:05,446
Play your part.

823
01:21:14,124 --> 01:21:16,674
...Miss Baja California.

824
01:21:30,349 --> 01:21:31,469
You can do this.

825
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:33,814
For your friend.

826
01:21:50,244 --> 01:21:52,254
Our three finalists are

827
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:54,079
Marilyn Martínez,

828
01:21:56,667 --> 01:21:58,457
Gloria Fuentes,

829
01:22:02,005 --> 01:22:03,585
Melina Doña.

830
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:10,010
And now presenting...

831
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:12,678
the second runner up...

832
01:22:19,147 --> 01:22:21,147
There are only two contestants left

833
01:22:21,233 --> 01:22:23,323
and only one can be
Miss Baja California.

834
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:26,655
The first runner up...

835
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:30,696
When they call your name, act surprised.

836
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:34,500
The new Miss Baja California...

837
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,870
Gloria Fuentes!

838
01:23:05,903 --> 01:23:07,613
Now, this is critical.

839
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:10,490
Once you've won, a man will come to you

840
01:23:10,574 --> 01:23:13,584
with a message from Saucedo,
inviting you to his party.

841
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,370
Just smile and accept.

842
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:19,335
Okay, fotos, finalistas, por favor.

843
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:22,456
Congratulations.

844
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:44,516
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

845
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:45,818
Are you ready?

846
01:23:48,654 --> 01:23:49,744
I'm ready.

847
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:55,540
I will guide you through this device.

848
01:23:56,078 --> 01:23:57,788
I can hear everything through it.

849
01:23:58,747 --> 01:24:00,167
Just speak loud enough.

850
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,127
Once you get in that car,
we won't be able to protect you.

851
01:24:07,881 --> 01:24:10,881
We think the party's on
one of the properties south of Rosarito.

852
01:24:33,615 --> 01:24:35,075
Miss Baja California.

853
01:24:38,954 --> 01:24:40,124
Gloria.

854
01:24:57,723 --> 01:25:00,733
We have girls
from all the top escort services.

855
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:31,756
Get Saucedo to invite you to his room.

856
01:25:49,566 --> 01:25:51,476
Miss Baja California.

857
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:53,698
Please, call me Gloria.

858
01:25:54,029 --> 01:25:55,449
What an honour to have you here.

859
01:25:55,531 --> 01:25:57,241
You are too sweet, General.

860
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:58,744
I have a question.

861
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:02,079
How's your evening going?

862
01:26:04,414 --> 01:26:06,124
Everything is good.

863
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:15,553
Miss, will you follow me?

864
01:26:25,727 --> 01:26:29,227
Wait here. In a few minutes
I'll take you next door.

865
01:26:29,314 --> 01:26:30,324
Do you understand?

866
01:26:30,816 --> 01:26:32,726
We need that location.

867
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:38,701
- Villa 102.
- Got it.

868
01:26:38,782 --> 01:26:40,202
Protect yourself.

869
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:42,406
Good luck, chula.

870
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:00,685
Oh, my God.

871
01:27:04,808 --> 01:27:06,808
- I found you.
- Oh, my God.

872
01:27:06,894 --> 01:27:07,894
I finally found you.

873
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:10,058
Oh, my God, I thought you were dead.

874
01:27:12,149 --> 01:27:13,649
Are you hurt?

875
01:27:13,734 --> 01:27:15,864
Are you okay? What happened?

876
01:27:15,944 --> 01:27:18,534
They... They...
They took me after the shootout.

877
01:27:18,614 --> 01:27:20,494
They led me into a car, and...

878
01:27:20,574 --> 01:27:22,874
I just thought they were cops, you know?

879
01:27:23,869 --> 01:27:25,449
They made me do things, chinita.

880
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:27,588
They told me they would hurt Chava.

881
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:29,875
They sold me into the system.

882
01:27:31,293 --> 01:27:32,753
They gave me this.

883
01:27:35,506 --> 01:27:36,506
What?

884
01:27:38,634 --> 01:27:40,144
Los Estrellas.

885
01:27:44,097 --> 01:27:45,177
Lino did this.

886
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:47,483
What are you doing here?

887
01:27:47,893 --> 01:27:49,188
I told you to wait over there.

888
01:27:49,353 --> 01:27:50,483
Let's go next door.

889
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:51,562
Sorry.

890
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:17,134
What a beautiful girl.

891
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:23,639
This red dress turns me on.

892
01:28:26,974 --> 01:28:27,974
Take off your dress.

893
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,390
I'll get you a drink.

894
01:29:02,467 --> 01:29:04,967
I told you to take off your dress.

895
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:07,466
Don't you understand me?

896
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:26,405
Hey.

897
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:41,756
Get in the bed.

898
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,454
Lino, Saucedo is here.

899
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:39,310
Huicho, grenade launcher.

900
01:31:09,386 --> 01:31:10,426
Help me.

901
01:31:33,869 --> 01:31:35,659
Gloria!

902
01:31:35,746 --> 01:31:36,746
Suzu?

903
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:41,629
Suzu!

904
01:31:45,130 --> 01:31:46,590
Suzu!

905
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:47,673
Come on.

906
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:51,141
Suzu!

907
01:31:51,512 --> 01:31:52,762
Suzu?

908
01:31:53,514 --> 01:31:55,224
Glo? Gloria.

909
01:32:01,104 --> 01:32:02,194
Go!

910
01:32:03,774 --> 01:32:04,774
Don't!

911
01:32:12,157 --> 01:32:13,157
Gloria.

912
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:47,441
Nice job, chula.

913
01:32:49,236 --> 01:32:50,646
Piece of shit.

914
01:33:05,294 --> 01:33:06,594
You got to finish the job.

915
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:15,968
Suzu.

916
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:22,191
See?

917
01:33:22,269 --> 01:33:23,899
I told you we'd find your friend.

918
01:33:25,772 --> 01:33:27,652
Show him your hand.

919
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:36,238
You knew where she was all along.

920
01:33:41,705 --> 01:33:44,745
I did what I had to do, chula.

921
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:51,795
We both did.

922
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:56,929
Both eyes open.

923
01:34:47,312 --> 01:34:48,612
Let's go, Suzu.

924
01:35:16,049 --> 01:35:19,389
Last night in a fierce gun battle,

925
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:22,469
esteemed Chief Saucedo killed

926
01:35:22,556 --> 01:35:24,596
Lino Esparza,

927
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:28,193
head of the criminal organization,
Los Estrellas.

928
01:35:28,812 --> 01:35:30,982
Saucedo died heroically,

929
01:35:31,064 --> 01:35:34,534
trying to free a group
of female hostages.

930
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:55,012
Jimmy.

931
01:35:56,882 --> 01:35:59,722
I don't envy your position, Gloria.

932
01:36:03,263 --> 01:36:07,023
I almost didn't recognise you
without your tattoos and your knife.

933
01:36:08,018 --> 01:36:11,188
You've changed a lot since I saw you
in that warehouse in San Diego.

934
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,820
You're a survivor.

935
01:36:19,404 --> 01:36:21,494
Walking out of a shootout like that.

936
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:22,623
Shit.

937
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:25,493
Making it through any of the things

938
01:36:25,577 --> 01:36:28,287
you've been through
in the past few days is...

939
01:36:28,372 --> 01:36:29,462
What do you want?

940
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:35,342
I want some coffee.

941
01:36:36,839 --> 01:36:37,839
You want some?

942
01:37:10,789 --> 01:37:13,079
Looks like you had a busy night, Gloria.

943
01:37:15,210 --> 01:37:18,960
You killed a cartel leader
and Tijuana's chief of police.

944
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,840
With your guns.

945
01:37:25,929 --> 01:37:29,179
Someone like you
could be very useful to us.

946
01:37:33,437 --> 01:37:35,932
I think I'm gonna need
something from you first.

947
01:37:38,066 --> 01:37:40,026
I want to be released immediately.

948
01:37:40,110 --> 01:37:41,349
Cleared of all charges.

949
01:37:44,114 --> 01:37:45,374
And one more thing.

950
01:38:02,966 --> 01:38:04,046
Chava!

951
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:19,273
Gloria!
