1
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,840
<i>It's frustrating</i>

2
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,958
<i>When you just can't express yourself</i>

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,239
<i>And it's hard to trust enough
to undress yourself</i>

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,914
<i>To stand exposed and naked</i>

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,153
<i>In a world full of hatred</i>

6
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,916
<i>Where the sick thoughts of mankind
control all the sacred</i>

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,998
<i>I got something to say</i>

8
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,594
<i>Oh, eyo</i>

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,432
<i>Yesterday is gone</i>

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,117
<i>Tomorrow's on the way</i>

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,515
<i>That name on that birth certificate</i>

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,790
<i>That ain't the real me</i>

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,030
<i>That ain't the real me...</i>

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,920
I'm thinking, with this,
if we have burgundy lips,

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,638
you know, hair pulled back tight...

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,869
- Can I get the silver?
- Okay, okay. I got it.

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,519
You... Okay. All right.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,080
Hey, Justin, sorry to bother you.

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,958
I was actually looking
at some of Vivian's dresses,

20
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,475
and I drew up some sketches
I'd love for you to take a look at.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,198
Please just stick to the chart.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,353
Uh, okay, but they're, like, cool ideas.

23
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,589
Just... I mean, I think.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,793
- Just hear me out.
- Honey,

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,518
we're not paying you to think.

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,193
<i>The message grab a hold
to every ears it get whispered in</i>

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,477
<i>The waters in the bayous
of New Orleans...</i>

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,870
<i>Hey, everyone,
it's our pleasure</i>

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,157
<i>to welcome Vivian Chan back
to Fashion Week Los Angeles.</i>

30
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,990
Okay.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,155
Hmm.

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,435
Keep it going.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,115
Got it.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,713
- Makeup went well.
- It had...

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,189
You know, it had its moments.

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,595
Suzu.

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,990
iChinita!
You on <i>your way?</i>

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,229
Yes.

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,278
And I stole two bags of makeup.

40
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,078
Yeah! You are winning this pageant.

41
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,278
<i>Of course.
'Cause you're my secret weapon.</i>

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,476
<i>My Hollywood makeup artist.</i>

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,198
Okay, I love you. I'm driving. Bye.

44
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,514
Welcome to Mexico.

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,590
<i>Gracias.</i>

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,310
Suzu.

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,112
<i>- Chinita!
- La Suzu!</i>

48
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,151
Aw, look at us.

49
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,159
I grew boobs way before you did.

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,799
Girl, I'm still trying to grow boobs.

51
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,950
Oh, that's true.

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,200
Hey, what time do we start
that pageant thingy stuff tomorrow?

53
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,998
- Uh, 9:00 in the morning.
- Ooh!

54
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,993
Then there's rehearsals for three days.
Then fit the dresses.

55
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,309
Suzu!

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,470
Balcony!

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,550
I'm hungry-

58
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,790
Gloria!

59
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,915
Ah!

60
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,356
There's my favorite little dude.

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,278
- Oh, "little"? You're huge.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,397
You finally came back to Tijuana.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,232
Yeah, and I brought you something.

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,989
What is it?

65
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,429
Holy shit!

66
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,234
Whoa, potty mouth.

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,879
It's the one we saw in Hollywood!

68
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,359
I thought you forgot about it.

69
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,670
- Come on.
- Well, you should practice

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,273
your English with Gloria.
Take advantage.

71
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,112
She should practice
Spanish. Maybe she won't

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,918
sound like a lame American.

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,277
He's right.

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,758
Guécala, sister.
You smell like beer.

75
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,309
Okay, little brother.
I made you <i>papas</i> con chorizo.

76
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,714
It's in the microwave.

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,430
Hello, good afternoon.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,593
Sign here please.

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,670
<i>Si.</i>

80
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,234
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

81
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,750
You?

82
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,433
No, I'm... I'm not registering.

83
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,079
I didn't think so.

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,075
What did you say?

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,555
- I'm just saying to her...
- You cannot talk to my friend like that.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,358
Okay, Suzu. Yeah, vémonos.

87
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,990
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,589
You always get into fights.

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,873
- If I win this thing...
- "When" you win this thing.

90
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,234
When I win this thing,

91
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,118
it's gonna be really good
for Chava and I.

92
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,235
Sure.

93
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,633
Hmm, okay, so I went with
a very natural eye and a dark lip.

94
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,309
Touching up.

95
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,433
Just a little different,

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,915
but you're done.

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,438
<i>Pinche, Gloria.</i>

98
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,719
Okay. I've got something for you.

99
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,832
Friendship bracelets.

100
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,634
Stop it.

101
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,279
- Like when we were kids.
- Oh.

102
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,395
Aw.

103
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,349
There you go.

104
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,640
Hey. I'm so happy that you're here.

105
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,434
You know, I didn't really think

106
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,796
I was gonna be able
to come back to Tijuana.

107
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,837
'Cause I always felt
like such a stranger here.

108
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,353
But you always make me feel
like I have family,

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,475
so thank you.

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Girl, you are my family.

111
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,913
Yes.

112
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,075
Okay, we need to get going,
'cause we got people to impress.

113
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,559
Are you coming?

114
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,159
- Really?
- Okay. Careful.

115
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,913
Oh, I know him...

116
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,154
<i>En sus suenos!</i>

117
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,470
No.

118
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,430
Okay.

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,235
Dude, tell me you saw him.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,673
Oh, yes.

121
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,350
- Cheers.
- Salud.

122
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,910
- Mmm.
- Oh.

123
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,634
Shall We dance?

124
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,949
- Ooh, no.
- Um... Uh, no.

125
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,073
Okay.

126
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,389
So, who do we have to rub elbows with?

127
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,709
Let's get it moving.

128
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,790
Hmm.

129
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,549
Over there. That's him.

130
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,436
Okay, that's Chief Saucedo.

131
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,034
He supposedly finances the contest,

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,158
and they say he sleeps
with whoever wins the pageant.

133
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,913
And you're still trying
to win this pageant?

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,638
Girl, it's just a rumor.

135
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,393
- Ew.
- "Ew," you. Girl, let's go.

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,750
<i>Hola.</i>

137
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,953
- Saucedo, cémo <i>estés?</i>
- Su.

138
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,235
<i>Cémo estés?</i>

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,118
And who's this lovely girl?

140
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,520
This is my friend Gloria.

141
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,910
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,354
<i>El gusto es mio.</i>

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,592
Chief Saucedo runs the state police.

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,349
Oh, that's just my hobby.

145
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,557
My real passion in life is beauty.

146
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,354
Oh, um...

147
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,633
I, um... Will you just give me
one minute?

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,710
I have to go to the bathroom.

149
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,670
Check the stalls.

150
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,030
Lino.

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,838
Please. Please.

152
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,593
- You can have everything.
- Muévete.

153
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,400
Please. Please.

154
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,318
Take it all. You can have everything.

155
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,990
You're American?

156
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,718
Do you want to stay alive'?

157
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,790
- Hmm?
- Yes.

158
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,995
You never saw us.

159
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,275
Come on.

160
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,039
Saucedo is in the VIP section.

161
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,634
You got 10 seconds
to get out of here, eh?

162
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,994
Salte, gringa.

163
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,678
- Hey.
- Suzu!

164
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,595
Suzu!

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,830
Suzu!

166
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,555
Hey.

167
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,032
Suzu! Suzu!

168
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,750
Suzu!

169
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,989
Suzu!

170
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,230
<i>Vamos!</i>

171
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,631
Suzu, come on, please. Pick up.

172
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,838
...assassination attempt
on Chief Saucedo...

173
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,032
Oh, God.

174
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,999
Excuse... Excuse me, sir.

175
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,673
My friend is inside.

176
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,795
All right, you can't
come in here. You can't come in here.

177
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,518
- No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Go. Go.

178
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,632
This is Suzu. Leave your message.

179
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,710
Suzu, I'm at the diner

180
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,835
across the street
from the Millenium Club.

181
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,354
If you get this,
please meet me here, okay?

182
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
Hospital Angeles Tijuana.

183
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,910
I'm trying to find a friend
who was in the Millenium Club.

184
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,669
What's your friend's name?

185
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,910
Suzu Ramos.

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,070
Let me check.

187
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,195
Nobody by that name has been admitted.

188
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,515
<i>Bueno?</i>

189
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,318
- Chava.
- Si?

190
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,435
<i>It's</i> Gloria.

191
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,957
When are you <i>guys</i> coming <i>back?</i>

192
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,515
You know what, Suzu's phone died,
so she just wanted me to call you

193
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,194
and tell you that we're gonna
be a little late, okay?

194
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,999
<i>Tell her I'm taking
the lunch money from her dresser.</i>

195
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,270
I Will.

196
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,873
- Bye.
- Bye.

197
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,279
<i>Excuse me. Permiso.</i>

198
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,350
No puedo...

199
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,235
I can't find my friend

200
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,913
and I need your help, please.

201
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,514
You have to go
to the station. Fill out a report.

202
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,997
Okay. I was at
the Millenium Club last night,

203
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,277
and I saw the men who did this,
and I just... I really need your help.

204
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,675
Fine. Get in.

205
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,750
Thank you.

206
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,398
Go ahead, sefiorita.

207
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,471
Tell me everything that happened.

208
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,551
These guys came
into the bathroom with guns.

209
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,438
One of them had the sides
of his head shaved.

210
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,033
Another one had green eyes.

211
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,918
One second.

212
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,079
Twenty, I'm here with a forty-one.
An American.

213
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,832
Says she saw the men at the Millenium.

214
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,319
<i>Let me check with Number One.</i>

215
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,839
Copy. Standing by.

216
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,592
When we get to the station,

217
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,399
I want you to tell them
everything you saw.

218
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,995
<i>Si.</i>

219
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,075
<i>Si, copiado.</i>

220
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,314
We are almost there.

221
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,040
I'm just going to pick up my lunch.

222
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,353
Shh.

223
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,675
Prep the other truck.

224
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,479
How's it going, Dona Rosita?

225
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,198
<i>Que' paso?</i>

226
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,471
Welcome to Casa Rosita.

227
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,994
He's inside.

228
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,195
<i>Ven.</i>

229
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,510
My grandparents
built this house back in the '40s.

230
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,155
<i>Hmm'? Te gusta?</i>

231
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,479
That's my brother.

232
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,475
He wants to sell it, but mmm-mmm,
I want to keep it for the family. Mmm?

233
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,759
<i>Siéntate.</i>

234
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,431
This is a mistake.

235
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,949
I only wanted to find my friend.

236
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,996
You tell me lies,
I'm going to hurt you.

237
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,150
Okay?

238
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,875
I'm not gonna lie.

239
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,030
You with the DEA'?

240
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,350
No.

241
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,079
You talk like a pocha.

242
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,150
What's your deal?

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,279
I grew up in the States.

244
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,919
I... I lived here for a few years.

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,752
My father is American,

246
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,832
and he owned a factory,
a maquiladora, here.

247
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,240
<i>Where's the maquiladora?</i>

248
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,355
It's gone.

249
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,514
And your father?

250
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,795
Gone, too.

251
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,510
Then why are you here?

252
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,358
I just came to visit my friend.

253
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,234
"Suzu. Suzu Ramos."

254
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,152
I'm gonna keep these for a while.

255
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,750
Okay?

256
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,270
Oh.

257
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,317
I can help you find your friend.

258
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,233
But you have to do something
for me first.

259
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,753
You do that,
and I'll help you find Suzu.

260
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,711
You mess around, and I'll kill you both.

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,510
Sale <i>?</i>

262
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,192
- Say "yes."
- Yes.

263
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,755
<i>Okay, chula.</i>

264
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,431
We're going to be
real good friends, you and I.

265
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,393
You ever been to Bakersfield?

266
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,435
Bakersfield?

267
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,030
Ey.

268
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,470
Bakersfield, California.

269
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,150
No.

270
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,389
I'm from Bakersfield.

271
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,756
I'm American, like you.

272
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,752
Grew up in both places, like you.

273
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,795
The trucks are ready.

274
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,595
<i>Vémonos.</i>

275
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,554
Salte.

276
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,590
Leave that on
and follow my instructions.

277
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,200
All right, stay with us, pochita.

278
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,270
<i>Come on, keep up.</i>

279
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,555
<i>- Run the light.</i>
- What?

280
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,995
<i>Come on, keep up! Keep up!
Don't slow down.</i>

281
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,230
Arre!

282
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,715
<i>All right,
turn right on this corner.</i>

283
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,791
<i>Park the car real close to the curb.</i>

284
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,475
<i>Take your phone and meet us up the hill.</i>

285
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,030
Hey.

286
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,395
<i>Good job, chula.</i>

287
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,038
Nice driving back there.

288
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,472
Tucén. The remote.

289
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,960
Watch this, bitches.

290
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,989
Check this out, chula.

291
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,840
<i>Dos! Uno!</i>

292
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,750
What?

293
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,752
Don't be sad. Hey.

294
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,632
Those bitches had it coming.

295
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,430
<i>Ah, mira.</i>

296
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,193
Hey, hey, hey.

297
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,352
Seems like she doesn't like barbecue.

298
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,114
<i>La policia!</i>

299
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,510
Let's get out of here.

300
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,151
What were you doing
last night at the Millenium?

301
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,672
My friend, she wanted to get
connected for the pageant.

302
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,839
The Miss Baja California pageant?

303
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,910
Yes.

304
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,558
Who do we know at the pageant?

305
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,313
Okay. Figure it out. Arre!

306
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,794
Why are we here?

307
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,272
You said you wanted to be
in the contest,

308
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,953
so now you're in the contest.

309
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,150
I... That's... That's not what I want.

310
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,236
I want to find my friend Suzu.
That's what I want.

311
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,993
We'll find your friend, chingada madre.

312
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,790
Mmm?

313
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,197
You can reach me with this.

314
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,354
Don't lose it.

315
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,029
Don't turn it off.

316
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,553
<i>Va?</i>

317
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,159
Take her to register, Pollo.

318
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,949
Let go of her arm.

319
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,190
<i>Chula.</i>

320
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,510
Have fun.

321
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,713
Can I see your left profile, please?

322
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,755
Now the right?

323
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,754
Very good. Face forward.

324
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,830
<i>Gracias.</i>

325
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,119
Girls, let's welcome Gloria
to the contest, please.

326
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,873
Have you seen my friend, Suzu?

327
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,759
No. I'm sorry.

328
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,472
- Where's your restroom?
- It's down the hallway.

329
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,558
- Gracias.
- Okay.

330
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,953
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

331
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,554
Can't I just have a second

332
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,280
to go to the restroom
in privacy, please?

333
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,398
Hey! Hey!

334
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,074
Hey!

335
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,514
- Are you okay?
- No.

336
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,354
Excuse me. Excuse me.

337
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,193
Are you American?
Please, I'm... I'm an American.

338
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,998
I've been abducted. They're chasing me.

339
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,878
What are you doing? What are you doing?

340
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,759
No, no, no, no! No!

341
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,555
Why am I in handcuffs?

342
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,476
Why am I here? Where am I?
I'm an American citizen.

343
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,437
I've been abducted. Please.

344
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,393
How long you been working
for La Estrella?

345
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,150
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what you're talking about.

346
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,674
I'm looking for my friend Suzu.

347
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,114
She went missing at the Millenium Club.

348
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,431
- My name is Gloria Fuentes. I'm an...
- I know who you are. I know who you are.

349
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,670
You're Gloria Fuentes, born in 1991.

350
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,199
You're a...

351
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,759
A makeup artist.

352
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,432
Are you Lino Esparza's girlfriend?

353
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,639
You're not listening to me.

354
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,039
I'm an American citizen.
I know my rights!

355
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,952
I want to be taken to the U.S. embassy!

356
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,190
Consulate already knows
about you, Gloria.

357
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,639
My name is Brian Reich,

358
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,473
and I'm an agent with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

359
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,756
Now, these are encrypted
radio cell phones

360
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,480
that only Esparza and his people use.

361
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,595
They can't be tracked.

362
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,517
So, you're telling me
that he gave you one of these

363
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,639
and he doesn't even know you?

364
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,358
Is this you?

365
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,117
I didn't know that there
was a bomb in the car.

366
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,190
Hmm.

367
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,400
Did it make you feel important
to be hanging out with Lino?

368
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,915
- What? No.
- I get it.

369
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,071
You're a nobody from nowhere.

370
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,198
- A broken home.
- No.

371
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,634
You have nothing.

372
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,916
Then along comes this slick guy.

373
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,031
He's, like, flashing money around,

374
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,235
and he's giving you toys

375
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,390
- and nice dresses.
- No, please.

376
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,273
- He's from Tijuana. You lived there...
- No.

377
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,033
He sounds like a fun time, right?

378
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,157
I didn't have anything to do with this.
Please, you have to believe me.

379
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,072
- Okay. Look.
- You have to believe me. Please.

380
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,594
Look, look, look, look.

381
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,712
The building that you blew up
is a DEA safe house.

382
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,995
Okay, no. Look at 'em.

383
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,991
Look. Look, look. Look at these guys.

384
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,230
- Now, three DEA agents...
- No.

385
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,469
...are dead because of you.

386
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,994
There they are. Look at 'em.

387
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,400
- Oh, no.
- Look at 'em.

388
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,630
Those are my friends.
Those are real Americans.

389
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,753
We have you on charges
of terrorism, murder, arson.

390
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,751
You know how long you'll go away for?

391
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,911
Thirty, 40, 50 years,

392
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,912
unless you help us.

393
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,390
This is a tracking chip,

394
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,790
and it goes in
the battery shelf, like this.

395
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,234
You try it.

396
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,035
Go ahead.

397
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,114
There you go.

398
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,400
Perfect.

399
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,840
Bingo.

400
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,399
You are taking this chip

401
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,869
and putting it
in Lino Esparza's cell phone.

402
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,950
No.

403
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,791
No, please don't make me
go back there. Please.

404
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,589
Look, Gloria, if what you say is true,
and I hope it is,

405
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,875
you're gonna have to prove it.

406
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,675
So, you're gonna take that chip

407
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,717
and plant it on his phone
however you can.

408
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,639
Now, if we don't hear from you,

409
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,678
then I'll make sure Lino knows
he has a DEA mole in his group.

410
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,159
And if somehow you manage to escape him,

411
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,436
I'll feed you to the U.S. prison system.

412
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,955
<i>Gracias.</i>

413
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,551
Gloria, here's your phone.

414
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,551
Make sure there's no chip in it
when they gather for checkup,

415
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,199
or else it'll be the last time
we hear from you.

416
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,914
This is my phone number.

417
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,435
Memorize it.

418
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,310
They're gonna want to know

419
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,754
where you've been
this whole time, so just...

420
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,229
Just tell Lino that you
got scared and ran away, okay?

421
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,318
Whenever you're ready, just turn it on,
and then he'll find you, okay? Oh.

422
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,670
For a taxi.

423
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,230
Listen to me.

424
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,233
There is a war going on
right now in Tijuana.

425
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,952
Whether or not you survive
is entirely up to you.

426
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,192
You give us Lino's location,
I will get you out of here safe.

427
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,190
What about my friend Suzu?

428
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,679
I'm the clearest path
between you and your friend.

429
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,400
You ever want to see her again,
you better do what you need to do.

430
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,630
Good luck.

431
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,995
Suzu?

432
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,389
Chava?

433
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,835
Chava?

434
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,234
Hey, Gloria.

435
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,752
Chava? You're home.

436
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,478
What's with your old-ass phone?

437
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,758
It doesn't even have games on it, dude.

438
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,274
Shh, give me the phone.

439
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,350
Give me the phone.

440
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,920
- Gloria?
- Shh!

441
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,313
<i>Don't ever
turn off the phone again.</i>

442
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,914
Gloria, what's happening?

443
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,350
Does your Tia Lupita
still live downtown?

444
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,189
Where's Suzu, Gloria?

445
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,639
Where's my sister?

446
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,869
Suzu's gonna be fine.

447
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,513
You hear me? Everything's gonna be fine.

448
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,398
I just need you to go pack up
a bag of clothes.

449
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,120
You know what, I'll go with you.
Let's go do this. Come on.

450
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,599
I'm gonna call you a cab.
Meet me downstairs.

451
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,353
- Okay?
- Okay.

452
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,190
Why did you run away?

453
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,959
- I was scared.
- Hmm.

454
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,911
You better not be lying to me.

455
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,150
Is that your son?

456
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,878
No, it's my godson.

457
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,550
Please don't hurt him.

458
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,675
<i>Ven p'ac'a.</i>

459
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,120
Please don't hurt him.

460
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,637
Hi.

461
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,631
What an elegant kid.

462
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,510
<i>A ver.</i>

463
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,795
Ooh!

464
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,592
<i>Chingon.</i>

465
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,236
Oye.
Come here, come here.

466
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,236
Do you have a cell phone?

467
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,674
Ah.

468
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,312
<i>Bien.</i> Okay.

469
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,118
Okay, okay, Okay.

470
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,039
Now,

471
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,919
you go back to your room, okay?

472
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,750
Pollo!

473
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,639
It isn't my house.

474
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,677
Go to your bedroom.
Wait for me over there.

475
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,194
Go to your room! Okay?

476
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,630
<i>Chula.</i>

477
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,718
I've been running all day.

478
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,595
Take my boots off.

479
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,395
Please.

480
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,349
Please don't hurt the kid.

481
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,270
I'll do whatever you want.

482
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,953
Just please don't hurt him.

483
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,354
Well,

484
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:07,310
there is something
that I need you to do.

485
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,791
You do that for me,

486
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,998
and I'll make sure the kid's safe.

487
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,469
Okay.

488
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,880
We have a deal?

489
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,395
Yes.

490
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,073
Now, take off your clothes.

491
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,909
What?

492
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,479
Take your clothes off.

493
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,755
Go on.

494
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,837
What?

495
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,910
Lino.

496
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,592
<i>Esté pasando?</i>

497
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,033
I don't trust that woman.

498
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,237
They won't be looking for her,
an American,

499
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,350
a gringa.

500
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,876
You worry about the DEA,

501
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,915
I'll worry about her.

502
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,995
Ruben's dead.

503
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,593
<i>No mames.</i>

504
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,237
Take these pesos for the funeral.

505
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,229
Orale.

506
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,754
Piensa, cabrén.

507
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,510
Lay down.

508
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,036
Back in Bakersfield,

509
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,631
at Whitney High,

510
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,831
I met a girl like you.

511
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,474
Samantha.

512
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,960
That was her name.

513
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,789
Samantha.

514
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,029
She was pretty.

515
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,749
Like you.

516
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,235
Never smiled.

517
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,080
Just like you.

518
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,272
Gloria.

519
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,473
Hey, you're gonna
drive to San Diego, eh?

520
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,273
To the address that I put on the GPS.

521
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,590
When you get to the border,
you got to make sure

522
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,115
that you look at
the customs guys in the eyes.

523
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,995
Don't do anything stupid.

524
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,235
When you're on your way back,
just call us.

525
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,355
We'll tell you where to meet.

526
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,919
You said you wouldn't hurt the kid.

527
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,953
So then, send him away.

528
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,990
Please.

529
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,195
<i>iArre!</i>

530
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,592
This cab's gonna take you
to Tia Lupita's, okay?

531
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,709
<i>Esté bien. Esté bien.</i>

532
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,354
Stay with the kid.

533
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,270
Chava, look at me.

534
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,555
I'm gonna find Suzu.

535
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,471
Okay? I promise you.

536
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,598
Don't forget to put on your seat belt.

537
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,520
Listen up, gringa.

538
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,358
If, for any reason,

539
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,390
whether it's an accident or intentional,

540
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,312
you get caught running away
with our stuff...

541
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,240
Or if you do anything stupid.

542
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,633
I'm gonna grab this knife,

543
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,675
and I'm gonna gut that little kid
like a chicken.

544
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,553
<i>Un pinche pollito.</i>

545
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,790
Got it?

546
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,350
Got it.

547
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:05,998
Drive safe.

548
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,040
<i>The route guidance will start now.</i>

549
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,429
Oh, what am I doing?
What am I doing?

550
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,874
Buenos dias, good morning.
How we doing today?

551
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,439
- I'm okay. I'm good.
- What's wrong?

552
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,840
You're better than okay.
You woke up today.

553
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,240
- You are blessed.
- Yeah. You're right.

554
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,355
You know, tomorrow's
not promised to anyone.

555
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,919
Just waking up,
it's a blessing within itself.

556
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,474
- You are right.
- But look, ma'am.

557
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,914
I'm just here to cheer up your day.

558
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,276
These owls right here will look at you
at night and watch you sleep.

559
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,069
- I'm good, gracias.
- Okay.

560
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,114
Yeah, go on, <i>bring</i> 'em in.

561
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,190
Ma'am, I need you
to step out of the car, please.

562
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,760
Turn around, ma'am. Manos atrés, please.

563
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,035
Hi.

564
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,710
Passport.

565
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,358
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

566
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,234
<i>Continue straight ahead
to destination.</i>

567
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,920
<i>Continue straight ahead to destination.</i>

568
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,354
Turn it off.

569
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,029
Open it up.

570
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,513
- Where's the rest?
- Under the car.

571
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,594
On the passenger side.

572
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,030
Come on in.

573
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,794
You take the van.

574
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,629
It's all there.

575
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,672
I need to get a message to Lino.

576
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,235
Are you listening?

577
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,715
I want you to tell him

578
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,634
Jimmy said the DEA has a mole
in his operation.

579
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,150
You got it?

580
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,395
I got it.

581
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,749
Get out of here.

582
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,359
Thank you.

583
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,190
Hello?

584
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,999
<i>Meet us at the bullring
parking lot, right over the border,</i>

585
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,832
<i>and take the Cantera Street exit.</i>

586
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,390
Got it.

587
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,514
Great. Who do I call?

588
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,077
<i>- Yes.
- I've got something for you,</i>

589
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,629
<i>but I want to know
that you'll protect me.</i>

590
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,949
I said I would.

591
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,838
What are you doing in San Diego?

592
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,635
They had me pick up weapons for them.

593
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:00,870
Where's the drop-off?

594
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,230
- The bullring parking lot.
- In Tijuana?

595
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,471
Okay. We're heading to the bullring.

596
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,550
We want Esparza.

597
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,075
If he's there, send me a text message
with the word "ox."

598
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,391
<i>Do not send a message
until you have visual confirmation.</i>

599
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,800
How do I get out?

600
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,756
Get to the double yellow gates
next to the ocean exit,

601
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,195
and there will be a SWAT van
on the other side to pull you out.

602
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,315
You got it?

603
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,199
Double yellow gates. Got it.

604
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,590
That's Pollo.

605
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,878
Keep your eyes on the perimeter.

606
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,910
Front SUV.

607
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,238
<i>Répido, répido, répido!</i>

608
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,715
As soon as you see Lino,
take the shot.

609
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,632
The girl
could get hit in the crossfire.

610
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,597
I said take the shot.

611
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,270
Watch out, boss!

612
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,870
Shoot.

613
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,435
Move in! Move in!

614
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:36,433
Stay down! Move it!

615
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,710
Vamos.

616
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,114
No. No!

617
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,190
Help!

618
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,309
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

619
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,718
<i>Hello?</i>

620
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,552
- What?
- There's no one here to <i>get</i> me.

621
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,836
<i>I don't see anyone. There's no SWAT van.</i>

622
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,718
<i>Sorry, Gloria. You're on your own.</i>

623
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,991
No! No!

624
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,032
Cover me, Chivo!

625
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,474
No!

626
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,590
Omar.

627
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,835
Go!

628
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,637
Grenade launcher!

629
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,037
Ground Force Two, do not let them out!

630
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,469
Grenade!

631

<i>iArre!</i>

632
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,440
Cut them off at the wall.

00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,914
Oh, fuck!

634
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,073
<i>Pinche</i> gringa.

635
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,639
How did the state police know
we would be there?

636
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,790
Do you know?

637
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,313
How were they so ready?

638
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,754
They had a sniper.

639
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,149
Pinche perra. You bitch!

640
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,516
Hey! Don't you call her a bitch.

641
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,755
Okay? She saved my life back there, man.

642
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:42,989
Because she had to.

643
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,229
Listen to me, Lino.

644
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,880
Someone is giving information
to the DEA.

645
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,679
- He's right, Lino.
- What?

646
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,596
Jimmy told me to tell you
that the DEA has a mole.

647
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,473
A traitor in your... In your group.

648
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,114
This is your fault.

649
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,830
What?

650
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,911
- I told you to get Brian Reich.
- But I did kill Reich.

651
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,718
Told you to handle the DEA.

652
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,990
That was your job.

653
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,636
Our dead men are on you.

654
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,198
Their blood is on your hands.

655
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,074
You gonna cry?

656
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,638
We borrowed
this place from some friends.

657
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,833
You look like shit.

658
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,593
Find some clothes.

659
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,359
They got some good stuff.

660
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,955
I got lucky.

661
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,555
Who was Brian Reich?

662
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,590
How do you know that name?

663
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,512
You said it earlier. I...

664
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,720
He's With the DEA.

665
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,710
That piece of shit.

666
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,593
Yeah, but that was the police
shooting at us.

667
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,593
Reich or Saucedo's guys,
it's the same thing.

668
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,960
They're all dirty,
and they're coming after me.

669
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,396
See, I used to run Tijuana,

670
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,589
the biggest border in the world.

671
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,715
Everything that came in and out
came through us,

672
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,034
Los Estrellas.

673
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,474
And now, Saucedo is trying
to take it from me.

674
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,838
You thought I was a bad guy?

675
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,313
I'm just playing their game, chula.

676
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,080
- So, then why would...
- That's enough with the questions.

677
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,559
Go help in the kitchen.

678
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,834
Hey.

679
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,149
My name is Isabel.

680
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,275
Start chopping.

681
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,513
I need all your cell phones.

682
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:43,114
What are you doing here anyway?

683
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,399
Are you Line's girl or something?

684
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:49,590
Has he had you yet?

685
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,310
Lino abducted me,

686
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,113
and they're threatening
to kill my friend's little brother.

687
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,918
That's why I'm here. Okay?

688
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,878
I didn't choose to be here, either.

689
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,109
They threatened my family.

690
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,914
They own me.

691
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:09,032
You cannot trust anything they say.

692
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,110
Your phone?

693
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,190
Here's my cell, asshole.

694
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,918
Forget your friend, Gloria.

695
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,279
No one's coming to save you.

696
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,910
Your phone.

697
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,837
We're doing some housecleaning.

698
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,672
Pollito here is the maid.

699
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,432
He's real good at cleaning, you know?

700
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,394
Smells good, baby.

701
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,595
Where's your phone?

702
01:00:58,680 --> 01:00:59,909
Right here.

703
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,992
<i>Que...</i>

704
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,673
<i>Un palito? Hmm?</i>

705
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,190
Okay.

706
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,029
<i>Andale.</i>

707
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:14,160
Keep chopping, Gloria.

708
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,230
Chop, chop.

709
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,029
<i>Aguéntame.</i>

710
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:36,390
Okay.

711
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,074
Okay, okay, okay.

712
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,755
No.

713
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,229
Hey.

714
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,193
Please, please, please, please, please.

715
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,390
Shit.

716
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,635
Okay.

717
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,109
Where were you?

718
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,554
What were you doing?

719
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:17,472
I was just in the bathroom.

720
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,990
What happened?

721
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,718
You couldn't wait to get laid?

722
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,350
What are you doing?
The pozole is ruined.

723
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,229
Find that mole.

724
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,549
Get up.

725
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,192
Get up.

726
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,795
<i>Arre.</i>

727
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,590
Walk.

728
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:04,836
- Where are we going?
- We're almost there.

729
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,995
Stop.

730
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,994
If you run into a thing
like we ran into yesterday,

731
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,831
you got to learn how to defend yourself.

732
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:40,836
You got to learn how to use one of these.

733
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:42,115
Here's an erre.

734
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,550
An AR-15 rifle.

735
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:48,436
Made in the USA.

736
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:51,675
Press on this button here.

737
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,154
It's a magazine.

738
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:57,029
La bala, the bullet.

739
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,671
La bala settles everything.

740
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,834
You pop it into the magazine right here.

741
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,680
Then you slide the magazine back in.

742
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:10,675
Then you pull the charging handle.

743
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,075
Here's your safety.

744
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,316
Thumb down, safety off.

745
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,471
Thumb up, safety on.

746
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,310
All right?

747
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:32,189
Now you try it.

748
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,955
Come on.

749
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,359
Oh, you're not gonna be
as lucky as you were yesterday.

750
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,069
No, no, no, no, no.

751
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:57,355
Magazine first.

752
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:00,355
There you go.

753
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,715
Uh-huh.

754
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,110
Mmm!

755
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,874
You got to press it.

756
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,275
All right.

757
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,074
Against your shoulder.

758
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,557
<i>Y después le jalas.</i>

759
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,998
No, no, no.

760
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,398
You got to keep both eyes open, okay?

761
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,517
You got to use your dominant eye.

762
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,759
'Cause if you don't...
'Cause if you close the wrong one,

763
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,831
then you're not gonna be able
to see your target.

764
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,275
There we go.

765
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,919
Keep both eyes open.

766
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:53,074
<i>Pinche Gloria.</i>

767
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,829
Here.

768
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,235
Try it again.

769
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:20,629
Empty it out.

770
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,000
What about Suzu?

771
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,671
My boy Wicho is on it.

772
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,070
He's my IT guy, and he's real good.

773
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,478
He's checked the hospitals
and the morgues,

774
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,471
and she's not there,
so that means she's alive.

775
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:05,198
Listen, I told you I'd find her.

776
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:09,113
For now, I'd...

777
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,633
I'd like you to take a shower.

778
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,674
You like it?

779
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,914
Where are we going?

780
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,070
Lino.

781

<i>Cémo estés?</i>

01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:24,998
<i>Y tu, que? Grande.</i>

01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,229
Lino!

784
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,791

<i>Mira.</i>

786
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:32,317
We just finished the barbecue.

01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,311
Perfect, I'm hungry.

788
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,038
I have a table for you over here.

789
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:37,838
It's so great to see you.

790
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,950
<i>Ah, que gusto.</i>

791
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,475
You look really skinny.
Why don't you eat?

792
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,039
<i>Gracias, Don Ramon.</i>

793
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,113
Gracias.

794
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,198
You had barbacoa before?

795
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,549
Mmm.

796
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:55,790
Nah.

797
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,475
Not like this one.

798
01:10:58,760 --> 01:10:59,750
Come on.

799
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,998
- Here.
- I'm not hungry.

800
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,309
Ah, you got to be hungry.

801
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,390
So?

802
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,835
It's good.

803
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,030
Just "good"?

804
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,949
Hmm?

805
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:24,275
That's what I thought.

806
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,436
That's how you eat some barbacoa, <i>guey.</i>

807
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:32,151
That is what I am talking about.

808
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:33,590
Let's go.

809
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,038
<i>Mmm. Chingada madre.</i>

810
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:46,839
I grew up around here, you know?

811
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,759
Till I was about six or seven.

812
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,718
I used to just dream about this place
when I was back in the U.S.

813
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,756
I wanted to come back so bad.

814
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,434
You know, I just never felt like

815
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,950
I belonged anywhere.

816
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,031
Then my moms and I got deported,

817
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,876
and when I was back,
I was too gringo to be Mexican,

818
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,871
too Mexican to be gringo.

819
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:19,794
So, I had to be tough.

820
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,232
And I learned to get what was mine.

821
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,674
One day, I'm gonna buy
all the land around here.

822
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,751
I could just build a big ranch.

823
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,393
Live off the land and shit.

824
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,277
Hey. Ya <i>cayo!</i>

825
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:55,354
We found the snitch.

826
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,760
Everybody's waiting.

827
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,870
<i>Arre.</i>

828
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,799

for cowardice or treason con cualquiera.

832
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,954
No, no.

833
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,519
No, no, no.

834
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,193
Chivo. LlevérTela.

835
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,669
No, no, no, no, no.

836
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,398
Let me just talk to him. Lino, no!

837
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,800
You can't. No.

838
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:02,712
Please let me talk to him.

839
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,189
Please. Let me go back.

840
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,351
Let me go back, please.

841
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,471
No.

842
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,353
on, my God.

843
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,270
Oh, my God.

844
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,520
Listen, chula.

845
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,314
Sometimes, you have to do
terrible things to survive.

846
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,840
Tomorrow's gonna be better.

847
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,715
I promise.

848
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,439
Just get some sleep.

Mmm?

This will fit you just right.

Try them on.

Okay? For today.

868

What do you want from me, huh?

869

What do you want?

01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:56,117
- Calm down, chula.
- No, I'm not going to calm down.

871
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,953
All right? I want to know
what this is all about!

872
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,951
I want to know! Tell me what's going on!

873
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,192
Hey, hey. You're gonna be my queen. Hmm?

874
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:07,318
I'm gonna send you to the
Miss Baja California pageant.

875
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:09,232
What? What?

876
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,516
No. No, I don't want to do this.

877
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,079
No. I don't... I want to go.

878
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,594
I want to leave right now.

879
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:15,954
- Listen to me.
- No.

880
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:18,429
Listen to you? I can't.

881
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:20,677
I can't. I can't do this anymore.

882
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:23,115
You're just gonna end up killing me
like you killed that other woman, okay?

883
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,719
So, just kill me, then!

884
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,950
- I want to go. Please!
- Listen to me.

885
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,429
No! Just let me go! Let me...

886
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,318
Get out of my way!

887
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,511
There's something you need to see.

888
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,239
Where did you get this?

889
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,433
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

890
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,309
Where did you get this?

891
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,313
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

892
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:04,719
Yeah, he's the chief of police.

893
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,552
He's also a corrupt piece of shit.

894
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:09,231
He has your friend. Yeah.

895
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,756
The police, they took her
the night after the shootout.

896
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:15,791
They run girls, throw parties.

897
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,035
They always have.

898
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,349
Where did you get this from?

899
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:19,589
Wicho.

900
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:24,036
He posed as one of the johns,
and they sent him that video.

901
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,190
Yeah.

902
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,352
They're offering her up
for Sauced0's after-party.

903
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:31,037
They got her all booked up.

904
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,834
She's all busy.

905
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,034
All night.

906
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,393
Sorry you had to see this.

907
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,069
You can decide.

908
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,880
Saucedo is my enemy, as he is yours.

909
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:58,555
And your friend,

910
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:01,432
she's gonna be there tonight.

911
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,114
Tonight's your chance to get her back.

912
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:08,595
How?

913
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,392
Saucedo always invites
the winner of the pageant to his party.

914
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,231
I need him alone in the bedroom.

915
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:21,915
No.

916
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,675
No. You... You want me to...

917
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,311
I want you to do whatever it takes.

918
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,752
This is how you get your friend back.

919
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:01,396
Chivo will be with you the whole way.

920
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,070
Now,

921
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,550
I need you to listen carefully, chula.

922
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,714
For this to work out,

923
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,954
<i>you need to believe
that you belong up there.</i>

924
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,353
<i>You just have to look confident.</i>

925
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:42,150
<i>We bought the judges.</i>

926
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,916
<i>Oh. Estoy bien, gracias.</i>

927
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,237
<i>Everyone works for us now.</i>

928
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,435

01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,794

01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,079
How's your evening going?

995
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:06,118
Everything is good.

996
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,630
<i>Si, senor.</i>

997
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,550
Miss, will you follow me?

998
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:29,236
Wait here. In a few minutes
I'll take you next door.

999
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,310
Do you understand?

1000
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:32,670
<i>- Si.
- We need that location.</i>

1001
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,675
- Villa 102.
- Got it.

1002
01:26:38,760 --> 01:26:40,194
<i>Protect yourself.</i>

1003
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,390
Good luck, chula.

1004
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,670
Oh, my God.

1005
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,791
- I found you.
- Oh, my God.

1006
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:07,870
I finally found you.

1007
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,031
Oh, my God, I thought you were dead.

1008
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:13,639
Are you hurt?

1009
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,836
Are you okay? What happened?

1010
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,514
They... They...
They took me after the shootout.

1011
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,477
They led me into a car, and...

1012
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,870
I just thought they were cops, you know?

1013
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:25,439
They made me do things, chinita.

1014
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,229
They told me they would hurt Chava.

1015
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,877
They sold me into the system.

1016
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,759
They gave me this.

1017
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,510
What?

1018
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,119
Los Estrellas.

1019
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,151
Lino did this.

1020
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:47,475
What are you doing here?

1021
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:48,995
I told you to wait over there.

1022
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:50,475
Let's go next door.

1023
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:51,550
Sorry.

1024
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,116
Oh, what a beautiful girl.

1025
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,639
This red dress turns me on.

1026
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:27,950
Take off your dress.

1027
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:31,393
I'll get you a drink.

1028
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,949
I told you to take off your dress.

1029
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:07,475
Don't you understand me?

1030
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,395
Hey.

1031
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:41,750
Get in the bed.

1032
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:43,719
<i>Apurate.</i>

1033
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,835
<i>Dale.</i>

1034
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,439
Lino, Saucedo is here.

1035
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:36,195
Ay, hijo <i>de puta.</i>

1036
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:39,314
Huicho, grenade launcher.

1037
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,435
Help me.

1038
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:35,632
Gloria!

1039
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,750
Suzu?

1040
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:41,635
Suzu!

1041
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,599
Suzu!

1042
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:47,670
Come on.

1043
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,120
Suzu!

1044
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:52,749
Suzu?

1045
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,193
Glo? Gloria.

1046
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,191
Go!

1047
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,750
Don't!

1048
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,150
Gloria.

1049
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,990
De'jalo.

1050
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,430
Nice job, chula.

1051
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,831
Piece of shit.

1052
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:06,600
You got to finish the job.

1053
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:15,955
Suzu.

1054
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,195
See?

1055
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,873
I told you we'd find your friend.

1056
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,637
Show him your hand.

1057
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,238
You knew where she was all along.

1058
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:44,758
I did what I had to do, chula.

1059
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:51,799
We both did.

1060
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,914
Both eyes open.

1061
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,594
Let's go, Suzu.

1062
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:19,396
Last night in a fierce gun battle,

1063
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:22,472
esteemed Chief Saucedo killed

1064
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:24,597
Lino Esparza,

1065
01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:28,196
head of the criminal organization,
Los Estrellas.

1066
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,950
Saucedo died heroically,

1067
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,510
trying to free a group
of female hostages.

1068
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,995
Jimmy.

1069
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,713
I don't envy your position, Gloria.

1070
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,995
I almost didn't recognize you
without your tattoos and your knife.

1071
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,197
You've changed a lot since I saw you
in that warehouse in San Diego.

1072
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,794
You're a survivor.

1073
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,471
Walking out of a shootout like that.

1074
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:22,595
Shit.

1075
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:25,476
Making it through any of the things

1076
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:28,279
you've been through
in the past few days is...

1077
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,430
What do you want?

1078
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,319
I want some coffee.

1079
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:37,830
You want some?

1080
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,076
Looks like you had a busy night, Gloria.

1081
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:18,955
You killed a cartel leader
and Tijuana's chief of police.

1082
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,833
With your guns.

1083
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:24,749
Hmm.

1084
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,151
Someone like you
could be very useful to us.

1085
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,272
I think I'm gonna need
something from you first.

1086
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:40,037
I want to be released immediately.

1087
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,315
Cleared of all charges.

1088
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:45,349
And one more thing.

1089
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:48,956
<i>Knocked down
But not shot down</i>

1090
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,190
<i>I got control</i>

1091
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,349
<i>Got my hand on the trigger</i>

1092
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,990
<i>Starting a whole new story</i>

1093
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,117
<i>No, you're not ready</i>

1094
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,874
<i>For what I'm gonna do</i>

1095
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,030
Chava!

1096
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:06,157
<i>You had the bullet</i>

1097
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:08,151
<i>But now I got the gun</i>

1098
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:10,754
<i>Look at me, I'm</i> a

1099
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:12,638
<i>Dangerous weapon</i>

1100
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:15,280
<i>I pick myself up</i>

1101
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,920
<i>Thought you could keep me down
Look who's on top now</i>

1102
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,274
Gloria!

1103
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,829
<i>Look who calls the shots now</i>

1104
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:24,150
<i>Oh, oh</i>

1105
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:27,358
<i>Never knew the power in me</i>

1106
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,757
<i>Now you see</i>

1107
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:33,232
<i>I got this, so don't</i>

1108
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:36,233
<i>Ever underestimate me</i>

1109
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:38,518
<i>Tread carefully</i>

1110
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:42,240
<i>I got this, look who's on top now</i>

1111
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,880
<i>Oh, I call the shots now</i>

1112
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:47,751
<i>Call the shots now</i>

1113
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,433
<i>I call the shots now</i>

1114
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:51,954
<i>Call the shots now</i>

1115
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:53,879
<i>I call the shots...</i>

1116
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,556
<i>Real tough
Got it all switched up</i>

1117
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:00,155
<i>I like the view</i>

1118
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,914
<i>'Cause I'm looking down on you</i>

1119
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,715
<i>Might say there's been a slight change</i>

1120
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,871
<i>I'm running this</i> game

1121
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,918
<i>I changed it up on you</i>

1122
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,435
<i>You are the bullet</i>

1123
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,477
<i>But now I got the gun</i>

1124
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:18,949
<i>Look at me, I'm</i> a

1125
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:20,997
<i>Dangerous weapon</i>

1126
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,754
<i>Thought you could wing me</i>

1127
01:39:23,840 --> 01:39:25,638
<i>Thought you could take me down</i>

1128
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,791
<i>Look who's on top now</i>

1129
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:30,349
<i>Look who calls the shots now</i>

1130
01:39:30,440 --> 01:39:32,238
<i>Oh, oh</i>

1131
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:36,035
<i>Never knew the power in me</i>

1132
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,589
<i>Now you see</i>

1133
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:41,752
<i>I got this, so don't</i>

1134

<i>Tread carefully</i>

1136
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,716
<i>I got this Look who's on top now</i>

1137
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,236
<i>Oh, I call the shots now</i>

1138
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:56,277
<i>Call the shots now</i>

1139
01:39:56,360 --> 01:39:58,715
<i>I call the shots now</i>

1140
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:00,757
<i>Call the shots now</i>

1141
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,478
<i>I call the shots...</i>

1142
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,796
<i>I'm laying down the law</i>

1143
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,996
<i>'Cause I'm the, I'm the boss</i>

1144
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,117
<i>So move, just move along</i>

1145
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,510
<i>Step aside, step aside</i>

1146
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,910
<i>I'm changing up the game</i>

1147
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,196
<i>Putting you in your place</i>

1148
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:18,311
<i>Yeah, it's a brand-new day</i>

1149
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,516
<i>Recognize, recognize</i>

1150
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:22,432
<i>Oh, oh</i>

1151
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:26,229
<i>Never knew the power in me</i>
