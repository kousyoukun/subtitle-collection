1
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:26,921
I'm thinking, with this,
if we have burgundy lips,

2
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,631
you know, hair pulled back tight...

3
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:29,883
- Can I get the silver?
- Okay, okay. I got it.

4
00:01:29,966 --> 00:01:31,509
You... Okay. All right.

5
00:01:33,762 --> 00:01:35,096
Hey, Justin, sorry to bother you.

6
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,973
I was actually looking
at some of Vivian's dresses,

7
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,476
and I drew up some sketches
I'd love for you to take a look at.

8
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,186
Please just stick to the chart.

9
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,354
Okay, but they're, like, cool ideas.

10
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,606
Just... I mean, I think.

11
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,816
- Just hear me out.
- Honey,

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,526
we're not paying you to think.

13
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,870
<i>Hey, everyone, it's our pleasure</i>

14
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,165
<i>to welcome Vivian Chan back
to Fashion Week Los Angeles.</i>

15
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,002
Okay.

16
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:09,422
Keep it going.

17
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,133
Got it.

18
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,725
- Makeup went well.
- It had...

19
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:21,810
You know, it had its moments.

20
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,608
Suzu.

21
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,985
<i>You on your way?</i>

22
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,237
Yes.

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,281
And I stole two bags of makeup.

24
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:37,075
Yeah! You are winning this pageant.

25
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:40,286
<i>Of course.
'Cause you're my secret weapon.</i>

26
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,497
<i>My Hollywood makeup artist.</i>

27
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,207
Okay, I love you. I'm driving. Bye.

28
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,527
Welcome to Mexico.

29
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,309
Suzu.

30
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,160
Look at us.

31
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,165
I grew boobs way before you did.

32
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,791
Girl, I'm still trying to grow boobs.

33
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,959
That's true.

34
00:04:11,628 --> 00:04:14,797
Hey, what time do we start
that pageant thingy stuff tomorrow?

35
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,174
9:00 in the morning.

36
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:18,384
Then there's rehearsals for three days.

37
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:19,969
- Then fit the dresses.
- Suzu!

38
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,471
Balcony!

39
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:22,555
I'm hungry-

40
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:23,806
Gloria!

41
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:27,352
There's my favorite little dude.

42
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,270
-"Little"? You're huge.
- Yeah.

43
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,397
You finally came back to Tijuana.

44
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,232
Yeah, and I brought you something.

45
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:34,984
What is it?

46
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:37,445
Holy shit!

47
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:39,238
Potty mouth.

48
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,865
It's the one we saw in Hollywood!

49
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,367
I thought you forgot about it.

50
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,661
- Come on.
- Well, you should practice

51
00:04:44,744 --> 00:04:46,287
your English with Gloria.
Take advantage.

52
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,122
She should practice Spanish.
Maybe she won't

53
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:49,916
sound like a lame American.

54
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,293
He's right.

55
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:54,754
Guacala, sister. You smell like beer.

56
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,340
Okay, little brother.
I made you <i>papas</i> con chorizo.

57
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,716
It's in the microwave.

58
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,435
Hello, good afternoon.

59
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,729
Sign here please.

60
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:15,775
You?

61
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,443
No, I'm... I'm not registering.

62
00:05:17,527 --> 00:05:19,070
I didn't think so.

63
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,072
What did you say?

64
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:23,574
-I'm just saying to her...
- You cannot talk to my friend like that.

65
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,368
Okay, Suzu. Yeah, vamonos.

66
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,997
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:31,582
You always get into fights.

68
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:34,627
- If I win this thing...
-"When" you win this thing.

69
00:05:34,836 --> 00:05:36,254
When I win this thing,

70
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,131
it's gonna be really good
for Chava and I.

71
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,257
Sure.

72
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:45,638
Okay, so I went with a very natural eye
and a dark lip.

73
00:05:47,098 --> 00:05:48,307
Touching up.

74
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:51,436
Just a little different,

75
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:53,938
but you're done.

76
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,738
Okay. I've got something for you.

77
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,828
Friendship bracelets.

78
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,621
Stop it.

79
00:06:10,705 --> 00:06:12,290
Like when we were kids.

80
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,377
There you go.

81
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,632
Hey. I'm so happy that you're here.

82
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,428
You know, I didn't really think

83
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:27,805
I was gonna be able
to come back to Tijuana.

84
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,849
'Cause I always felt
like such a stranger here.

85
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,352
But you always make me feel
like I have family,

86
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:34,479
so thank you.

87
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,232
Girl, you are my family.

88
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:40,234
Yes.

89
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:46,074
Okay, we need to get going,
'cause we got people to impress.

90
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:52,580
Are you coming?

91
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,165
- Really?
- Okay. Careful.

92
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,917
I know him...

93
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,495
No.

94
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,455
Okay.

95
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:36,249
Dude, tell me you saw him.

96
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:39,669
Yes.

97
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,379
Cheers.

98
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:44,632
Shall we dance?

99
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,967
- No.
- No.

100
00:07:48,094 --> 00:07:49,095
Okay.

101
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,388
So, who do we have to rub elbows with?

102
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,722
Let's get it moving.

103
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,559
Over there. That's him.

104
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,436
Okay, that's Chief Saucedo.

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,022
He supposedly finances the contest,

106
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:03,151
and they say he sleeps
with whoever wins the pageant.

107
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:04,902
And you're still trying
to win this pageant?

108
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:06,654
Girl, it's just a rumor.

109
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,031
- Ew.
-"Ew," you. Girl, let's go.

110
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,125
And who's this lovely girl?

111
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,501
This is my friend Gloria.

112
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:26,591
Chief Saucedo runs the state police.

113
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,343
That's just my hobby.

114
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:33,556
My real passion in life is beauty.

115
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,644
I... Will you just give me one minute?

116
00:08:38,728 --> 00:08:39,729
I have to go to the bathroom.

117
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,687
Check the stalls.

118
00:09:45,044 --> 00:09:46,045
Lino.

119
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,839
Please. Please.

120
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:50,591
You can have everything.

121
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,385
Please. Please.

122
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,308
Take it all. You can have everything.

123
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:03,020
You're American?

124
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,731
Do you want to stay alive?

125
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:06,816
Yes.

126
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:07,984
You never saw us.

127
00:10:09,235 --> 00:10:10,278
Come on.

128
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,029
Saucedo is in the VIP section.

129
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,657
<i>You got 10 seconds to get out of here.</i>

130
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,992
<i>Salte,</i> gringa.

131
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,667
- Hey.
- Suzu!

132
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:27,586
Suzu!

133
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:32,842
Suzu!

134
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,054
Suzu!Suzu!

135
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,774
Suzu!

136
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:58,993
Suzu!

137
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,648
Suzu, come on, please. Pick up.

138
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,826
"Assassination attempt
on Chief Saucedo...

139
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,215
God.

140
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,009
Excuse... Excuse me, sir.

141
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:40,678
My friend is inside.

142
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:41,804
All right, you can't come in here.
You can't come in here.

143
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,514
- No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
- Go. Go.

144
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,623
This is Suzu. Leave your message.

145
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,834
Suzu, I'm at the diner across the street
from the Millenium Club.

146
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,377
If you get this,
please meet me here, okay?

147
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,259
Hospital Angeles Tijuana.

148
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:23,929
I'm trying to find a friend
who was in the Millenium Club.

149
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:25,681
What's your friend's name?

150
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:26,932
Suzu Ramos.

151
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:28,100
Let me check.

152
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,188
Nobody by that name has been admitted.

153
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:08,599
<i>Chava.</i>

154
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,434
<i>It's Gloria.</i>

155
00:14:10,935 --> 00:14:12,978
<i>When are you guys coming back?</i>

156
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,523
You know what, Suzu's phone died,
so she just wanted me to call you

157
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,192
and tell you that we're gonna
be a little late, okay?

158
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,986
<i>Tell her I'm taking
the lunch money from her dresser.</i>

159
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,279
I will.

160
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,864
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

161
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,293
Excuse me.

162
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,255
I can't find my friend

163
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:40,923
and I need your help, please.

164
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,509
You have to go to the station.
Fill out a report.

165
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,011
Okay. I was at
the Millenium Club last night,

166
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:49,265
and I saw the men who did this,
and I just... I really need your help.

167
00:14:50,558 --> 00:14:51,684
Fine. Get in.

168
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,768
Thank you.

169
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,403
Go ahead, senorita.

170
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:04,488
Tell me everything that happened.

171
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,574
These guys came
into the bathroom with guns.

172
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:08,450
One of them had the sides
of his head shaved.

173
00:15:08,534 --> 00:15:10,035
Another one had green eyes.

174
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,412
One second.

175
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:16,083
Twenty, I'm here with a forty-one.
An American.

176
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,837
Says she saw the men at the Millenium.

177
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,338
Let me check with Number One.

178
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,840
Copy. Standing by.

179
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,595
When we get to the station,

180
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,389
I want you to tell them
everything you saw.

181
00:15:40,024 --> 00:15:41,317
We are almost there.

182
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,029
I'm just going to pick up my lunch.

183
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,679
Prep the other truck.

184
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,476
How's it going, Dona Rosita?

185
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:02,481
Welcome to Casa Rosita.

186
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,982
He's inside.

187
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:22,501
My grandparents built this house
back in the '40s.

188
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,467
That's my brother.

189
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:34,555
He wants to sell it,
but I want to keep it for the family.

190
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,459
This is a mistake.

191
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,961
I only wanted to find my friend.

192
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:33,989
You tell me lies, I'm going to hurt you.

193
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,157
Okay?

194
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,867
I'm not gonna lie.

195
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,035
You with the DEA?

196
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:39,369
No.

197
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:45,083
You talk like a pocha.

198
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,169
What's your deal?

199
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,296
I grew up in the States.

200
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,923
I... I lived here for a few years.

201
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:52,758
My father is American,

202
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,844
and he owned a factory,
a maquiladora, here.

203
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,221
<i>Where's the maquiladora?</i>

204
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,347
It's gone.

205
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,516
And your father?

206
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,809
Gone, too.

207
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:05,521
Then why are you here?

208
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,359
I just came to visit my friend.

209
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,241
"Suzu. Suzu Ramos."

210
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,164
I'm gonna keep these for a while.

211
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,749
Okay?

212
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,340
I can help you find your friend.

213
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,260
But you have to do something
for me first.

214
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,766
You do that,
and I'll help you find Suzu.

215
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:45,727
You mess around, and I'll kill you both.

216
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,193
"Yes-ll
- Yes.

217
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,779
<i>Okay, chula.</i>

218
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,449
We're going to be
real good friends, you and I.

219
00:20:04,872 --> 00:20:06,415
You ever been to Bakersfield?

220
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,458
Bakersfield?

221
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,043
<i>Ey'</i>

222
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,462
Bakersfield, California.

223
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,173
No.

224
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,383
I'm from Bakersfield.

225
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm American, like you.

226
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:22,764
Grew up in both places, like you.

227
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,809
The trucks are ready.

228
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,588
Leave that on
and follow my instructions.

229
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,198
All right, stay with us, pochita.

230
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,282
<i>Come on, keep up.</i>

231
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,575
<i>- Run the light.</i>
- What?

232
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,994
<i>Come on, keep up! Keep up!
Don't slow down.</i>

233
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,714
<i>All right, turn right on this corner.</i>

234
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,800
<i>Park the car real close to the curb.</i>

235
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:49,476
<i>Take your phone and meet us up the hill.</i>

236
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,053
Hey.

237
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,399
<i>Good job, chula.</i>

238
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,027
Nice driving back there.

239
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,488
Tucan. The remote.

240
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:47,951
Watch this, bitches.

241
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:50,996
Check this out, <i>chula.</i>

242
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:03,759
What?

243
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,769
Don't be sad. Hey.

244
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:17,647
Those bitches had it coming.

245
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,193
Hey, hey, hey.

246
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,361
Seems like she doesn't like barbecue.

247
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:45,509
Let's get out of here.

248
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:48,178
What were you doing last night
at the Millenium?

249
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,681
My friend, she wanted to get
connected for the pageant.

250
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:53,850
The Miss Baja California pageant?

251
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:54,935
Yes.

252
00:23:56,853 --> 00:23:58,563
Who do we know at the pageant?

253
00:23:58,647 --> 00:23:59,898
Okay. Figure it out.

254
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:11,785
Why are we here?

255
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:16,289
You said you wanted to be
in the contest,

256
00:24:16,373 --> 00:24:17,958
so now you're in the contest.

257
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,169
I... That's... That's not what I want.

258
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,256
I want to find my friend Suzu.
That's what I want.

259
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:26,007
We'll find your friend, chingada madre.

260
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,185
You can reach me with this.

261
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,354
Don't lose it.

262
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,022
Don't turn it off.

263
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:48,155
Take her to register, Polio.

264
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,953
Let go of her arm.

265
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,502
Have fun.

266
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,721
Can I see your left profile, please?

267
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,766
Now the right?

268
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,770
Very good. Face forward.

269
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:28,111
Girls, let's welcome Gloria
to the contest, please.

270
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,867
Have you seen my friend, Suzu?

271
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:35,744
No. I'm sorry.

272
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,497
- Where's your restroom?
- It's down the hallway.

273
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,541
Okay.

274
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,974
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

275
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:02,562
Can't I just have a second

276
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:05,273
to go to the restroom
in privacy, please?

277
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,382
Hey! Hey!

278
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,067
Hey!

279
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,527
- Are you okay?
- No.

280
00:26:51,069 --> 00:26:52,362
Excuse me. Excuse me.

281
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:55,198
Are you American?
Please, I'm... I'm an American.

282
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,992
I've been abducted. They're chasing me.

283
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:58,868
What are you doing? What are you doing?

284
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,746
No, no, no, no! No!

285
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:19,556
Why am I in handcuffs?

286
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:22,475
Why am I here? Where am I?
I'm an American citizen.

287
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,436
I've been abducted. Please.

288
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,396
How long you been working
for La Estrella?

289
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,149
I don't know what that is.
I don't know what you're talking about.

290
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,692
I'm looking for my friend Suzu.

291
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,110
She went missing at the Millenium Club.

292
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:35,447
- My name is Gloria Fuentes. I'm an...
- I know who you are. I know who you are.

293
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,699
You're Gloria Fuentes, born in 1991.

294
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,200
You're a...

295
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,744
A makeup artist.

296
00:27:42,454 --> 00:27:45,457
Are you Lino Esparza's girlfriend?

297
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,625
You're not listening to me.

298
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:51,046
I'm an American citizen.
I know my rights!

299
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,964
I want to be taken to the U.S. embassy!

300
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,216
Consulate already knows
about you, Gloria.

301
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:00,638
My name is Brian Reich,

302
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,475
and I'm an agent with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

303
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,772
Now, these are encrypted
radio cell phones

304
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:11,483
that only Esparza and his people use.

305
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:12,609
They can't be tracked.

306
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,529
So, you're telling me
that he gave you one of these

307
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:18,656
and he doesn't even know you?

308
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,370
Is this you?

309
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:29,125
I didn't know that there
was a bomb in the car.

310
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:37,384
Did it make you feel important
to be hanging out with Lino?

311
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,928
- What? No.
- I get it.

312
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:42,097
You're a nobody from nowhere.

313
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,182
- A broken home.
- No.

314
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:45,642
You have nothing.

315
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,936
Then along comes this slick guy.

316
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:53,024
He's, like, flashing money around,

317
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,234
and he's giving you toys

318
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:55,402
-and nice dresses.
- No, please.

319
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:57,278
- He's from Tijuana. You lived there...
- No.

320
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,030
He sounds like a fun time, right?

321
00:28:59,114 --> 00:29:01,157
I didn't have anything to do with this.
Please, you have to believe me.

322
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:03,076
- Okay. Look.
- You have to believe me. Please.

323
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,619
Look, look, look, look.

324
00:29:04,702 --> 00:29:07,705
The building that you blew up
is a DEA safe house.

325
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:08,998
Okay, no. Look at 'em.

326
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,000
Look. Look, look. Look at these guys.

327
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,253
- Now, three DEA agents...
- No.

328
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:14,462
...are dead because of you.

329
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:16,005
There they are. Look at 'em.

330
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:17,382
- No.
- Look at 'em.

331
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,634
Those are my friends.
Those are real Americans.

332
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:24,764
We have you on charges
of terrorism, murder, arson.

333
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:26,766
You know how long you'll go away for?

334
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,935
Thirty, 40, 50 years,

335
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,312
unless you help us.

336
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,406
This is a tracking chip,

337
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,783
and it goes in
the battery shelf, like this.

338
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,244
You try it.

339
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,037
Go ahead.

340
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,123
There you go.

341
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:53,418
Perfect.

342
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:56,838
Bingo.

343
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:58,381
You are taking this chip

344
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,884
and putting it
in Lino Esparza's cell phone.

345
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:01,968
No.

346
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,804
No, please don't make me
go back there. Please.

347
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:08,600
Look, Gloria, if what you say is true,
and I hope it is,

348
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:09,893
you're gonna have to prove it.

349
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:11,686
So, you're gonna take that chip

350
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,730
and plant it on his phone
however you can.

351
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,648
Now, if we don't hear from you,

352
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,693
then I'll make sure Lino knows
he has a DEA mole in his group.

353
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,155
And if somehow you manage to escape him,

354
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,449
I'll feed you to the U.S. prison system.

355
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,542
Gloria, here's your phone.

356
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:36,544
Make sure there's no chip in it
when they gather for checkup,

357
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:38,213
or else it'll be the last time
we hear from you.

358
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:42,926
This is my phone number.

359
00:30:43,384 --> 00:30:44,427
Memorize it.

360
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:46,304
They're gonna want to know

361
00:30:46,387 --> 00:30:47,764
where you've been
this whole time, so just...

362
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:50,225
Just tell Lino that you
got scared and ran away, okay?

363
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:55,688
Whenever you're ready, just turn it on,
and then he'll find you, okay?

364
00:30:57,607 --> 00:30:58,691
For a taxi.

365
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,237
Listen to me.

366
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,240
There is a war going on
right now in Tijuana.

367
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:08,952
Whether or not you survive
is entirely up to you.

368
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:12,205
You give us Line's location,
I will get you out of here safe.

369
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,208
What about my friend Suzu?

370
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,668
I'm the clearest path
between you and your friend.

371
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,420
You ever want to see her again,
you better do what you need to do.

372
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:26,636
Good luck.

373
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:40,984
Suzu?

374
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:43,403
Chava?

375
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:46,823
Chava?

376
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:26,237
Hey, Gloria.

377
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,741
Chava? You're home.

378
00:32:29,824 --> 00:32:31,492
What's with your old-ass phone?

379
00:32:31,951 --> 00:32:33,745
It doesn't even have games on it, dude.

380
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,288
Shh, give me the phone.

381
00:32:35,371 --> 00:32:36,372
Give me the phone.

382
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:38,916
Gloria?

383
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:43,338
<i>Don't ever turn off the phone again.</i>

384
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,928
Gloria, what's happening?

385
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,351
Does your Tia Lupita
still live downtown?

386
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,187
Where's Suzu, Gloria?

387
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,648
Where's my sister?

388
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,899
Suzu's gonna be fine.

389
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:04,525
You hear me? Everything's gonna be fine.

390
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,402
I just need you to go pack up
a bag of clothes.

391
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,113
You know what, I'll go with you.
Let's go do this. Come on.

392
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,617
I'm gonna call you a cab.
Meet me downstairs.

393
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,369
"Okay?
"Okay

394
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,220
Why did you run away?

395
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:35,973
I was scared.

396
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,935
You better not be lying to me.

397
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,151
Is that your son?

398
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:48,861
No, it's my godson.

399
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,864
Please don't hurt him.

400
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:54,117
Please don't hurt him.

401
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,376
Hi.

402
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,629
What an elegant kid.

403
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:19,225
Come here, come here.

404
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:24,230
Do you have a cell phone?

405
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,985
Okay.

406
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,778
Okay, okay, Okay-

407
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:34,031
Now,

408
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,910
you go back to your room, okay?

409
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,645
It isn't my house.

410
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,692
Go to your bedroom.
Wait for me over there.

411
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,194
Go to your room! Okay?

412
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,719
I've been running all day.

413
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,599
Take my boots off.

414
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,395
Please.

415
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,372
Please don't hurt the kid.

416
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,295
I'll do whatever you want.

417
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,963
Just please don't hurt him.

418
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:01,345
Well,

419
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,310
there is something
that I need you to do.

420
00:37:08,728 --> 00:37:10,813
You do that for me,

421
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,982
and I'll make sure the kid's safe.

422
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:18,487
Okay.

423
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,864
We have a deal?

424
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,409
Yes.

425
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:26,078
Now, take off your clothes.

426
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:28,915
What?

427
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:30,499
Take your clothes off.

428
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:20,758
Go on.

429
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:27,848
What?

430
00:38:27,932 --> 00:38:28,933
Lino.

431
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:48,786
I don't trust that woman.

432
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:54,250
They won't be looking for her,
an American,

433
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,376
a gringa

434
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:57,878
You worry about the DEA,

435
00:38:58,462 --> 00:39:00,923
I'll worry about her.

436
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:04,010
Ruben's dead.

437
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,227
Take these pesos for the funeral.

438
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:55,519
Lay down.

439
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,034
Back in Bakersfield,

440
00:40:12,703 --> 00:40:14,622
at Whitney High,

441
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,833
I met a girl like you.

442
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:25,466
Samantha.

443
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:29,970
That was her name.

444
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:34,809
Samantha.

445
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:39,021
She was pretty.

446
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:41,774
Like you.

447
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:45,236
Never smiled.

448
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:48,072
Just like you.

449
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:55,287
Gloria.

450
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:58,976
Hey, you're gonna drive to San Diego.

451
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:03,272
To the address that I put on the GPS.

452
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:05,608
When you get to the border,
you got to make sure

453
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:08,110
that you look at
the customs guys in the eyes.

454
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:09,987
Don't do anything stupid.

455
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:15,242
When you're on your way back,
just call us.

456
00:42:15,326 --> 00:42:16,368
We'll tell you where to meet.

457
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:17,912
You said you wouldn't hurt the kid.

458
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:20,956
So then, send him away.

459
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:23,000
Please.

460
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,603
This cab's gonna take you
to Tia Lupita's, okay?

461
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,357
Stay with the kid.

462
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:52,279
Chava, look at me.

463
00:42:54,365 --> 00:42:55,574
I'm gonna find Suzu.

464
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,494
Okay? I promise you.

465
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,581
Don't forget to put on your seat belt.

466
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:26,522
Listen up, gringa.

467
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:31,360
If, for any reason,

468
00:43:32,903 --> 00:43:36,407
whether it's an accident or intentional,

469
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:40,327
you get caught running away
with our stuff...

470
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,249
Or if you do anything stupid.

471
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:49,628
I'm gonna grab this knife,

472
00:43:50,921 --> 00:43:54,675
and I'm gonna gut that little kid
like a chicken.

473
00:43:58,804 --> 00:43:59,805
Got it?

474
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:02,349
Got it.

475
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:06,020
Drive safe.

476
00:44:14,486 --> 00:44:17,031
<i>The route guidance will start now.</i>

477
00:44:41,055 --> 00:44:43,432
What am I doing? What am I doing?

478
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:44,892
Buenos <i>dias,</i> good morning.
How we doing today?

479
00:44:44,975 --> 00:44:46,435
-I'm okay. I'm good.
- What's wrong?

480
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:47,853
You're better than okay.
You woke up today.

481
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,229
- You are blessed.
- Yeah. You're right.

482
00:44:49,313 --> 00:44:50,356
You know, tomorrow's
not promised to anyone.

483
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,940
Just waking up,
it's a blessing within itself.

484
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,484
- You are right.
- But look, ma'am.

485
00:44:53,567 --> 00:44:54,902
I'm just here to cheer up your day.

486
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:57,279
These owls right here will look at you
at night and watch you sleep.

487
00:44:57,905 --> 00:44:59,073
-I'm good, gracias.
- Okay.

488
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:04,119
<i>Yeah, go on, bring 'em in.</i>

489
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:10,209
Ma'am, I need you
to step out of the car, please.

490
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:16,757
Turn around, ma'am. Manos atras, please.

491
00:45:48,997 --> 00:45:50,040
Hi.

492
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:51,708
Passport.

493
00:46:04,638 --> 00:46:06,348
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

494
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:25,242
<i>Continue straight ahead to destination.</i>

495
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,922
<i>Continue straight ahead to destination.</i>

496
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,362
Turn it off.

497
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:07,034
Open it UP-

498
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,509
- Where's the rest?
- Under the car.

499
00:47:24,176 --> 00:47:25,594
On the passenger side.

500
00:47:37,022 --> 00:47:38,023
Come on in.

501
00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:40,817
You take the van.

502
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:54,623
It's all there.

503
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,668
I need to get a message to Lino.

504
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:00,254
Are you listening?

505
00:48:01,672 --> 00:48:02,714
I want you to tell him

506
00:48:02,798 --> 00:48:06,635
Jimmy said the DEA has a mole
in his operation.

507
00:48:08,095 --> 00:48:09,179
You got it?

508
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,389
I got it.

509
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,767
Get out of here.

510
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:24,069
Thank you.

511
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:29,199
Hello?

512
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:31,994
<i>Meet us at the bullring parking lot,
right over the border,</i>

513
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:33,829
<i>and take the Cantera Street exit.</i>

514
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:35,414
Got it.

515
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,501
Great. Who do I call?

516
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:49,094
<i>-'(es.
- I've got something for you,</i>

517
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:51,638
<i>but I want to know
that you'll protect me.</i>

518
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:52,973
I said I would.

519
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,850
What are you doing in San Diego?

520
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:58,645
They had me pick up weapons for them.

521
00:48:59,813 --> 00:49:00,897
Where's the drop-off?

522
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:03,233
- The bullring parking lot.
- In Tijuana?

523
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:07,487
Okay. We're heading to the bullring.

524
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:08,572
We want Esparza.

525
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:11,074
If he's there, send me a text message
with the word "ox."

526
00:49:11,158 --> 00:49:14,411
<i>Do not send a message
until you have visual confirmation.</i>

527
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:15,787
How do I get out?

528
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,749
Get to the double yellow gates
next to the ocean exit,

529
00:49:18,832 --> 00:49:21,209
and there will be a SWAT van
on the other side to pull you out.

530
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:22,336
You got it?

531
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,214
Double yellow gates. Got it.

532
00:50:33,532 --> 00:50:34,616
That's Pollo.

533
00:51:13,155 --> 00:51:14,865
Keep your eyes on the perimeter.

534
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:33,925
Front SUV.

535
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:02,704
As soon as you see Lino, take the shot.

536
00:52:02,788 --> 00:52:04,623
The girl could get hit in the crossfire.

537
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:06,583
I said take the shot.

538
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:14,299
Watch out, boss!

539
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:25,894
Shoot

540
00:52:28,396 --> 00:52:29,439
Move in! Move in!

541
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:36,446
Stay down! Move it!

542
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,106
No. No!

543
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:12,190
Help!

544
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:22,325
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

545
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:31,710
<i>Hello?</i>

546
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:33,545
<i>- What?
- There's no one here to get me.</i>

547
00:53:33,628 --> 00:53:35,839
<i>I don't see anyone. There's no SWAT van.</i>

548
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:39,718
<i>Sorry, Gloria. You're on your own.</i>

549
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:44,014
No! No!

550
00:53:57,193 --> 00:53:59,029
Cover me, Chivo!

551
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:17,464
No!

552
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:20,592
Omar.

553
00:55:06,805 --> 00:55:07,847
Go!

554
00:55:12,686 --> 00:55:14,646
Grenade launcher!

555
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:21,027
Ground Force Two, do not let them out!

556
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:26,491
Grenade!

557
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:46,428
Cut them off at the wall.

558
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:55,937
Fuck!

559
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,089
<i>Pinche</i> gringa.

560
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:27,635
How did the state police know
we would be there?

561
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,803
Do you know?

562
00:56:29,721 --> 00:56:31,306
How were they so ready?

563
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,766
They had a sniper.

564
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:35,143
You bitch!

565
00:56:35,226 --> 00:56:37,520
Hey! Don't you call her a bitch.

566
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:41,775
Okay? She saved my life back there, man.

567
00:56:41,858 --> 00:56:42,984
Because she had to.

568
00:56:43,068 --> 00:56:44,235
Listen to me, Lino.

569
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:46,863
Someone is giving information
to the DEA.

570
00:56:46,946 --> 00:56:49,699
- He's right, Lino.
- What?

571
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,619
Jimmy told me to tell you
that the DEA has a mole.

572
00:56:52,702 --> 00:56:55,497
A traitor in your... In your group.

573
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,131
This is your fault.

574
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,841
What?

575
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,927
- I told you to get Brian Reich.
- But I did kill Reich.

576
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,720
Told you to handle the DEA.

577
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,014
That was your job.

578
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:15,642
Our dead men are on you.

579
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:21,189
Their blood is on your hands.

580
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,068
You gonna cry?

581
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:36,621
We borrowed this place
from some friends.

582
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:42,836
You look like shit.

583
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:45,588
Find some clothes.

584
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:48,341
They got some good stuff.

585
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:00,979
I got lucky.

586
00:58:04,524 --> 00:58:05,567
Who was Brian Reich?

587
00:58:08,528 --> 00:58:09,612
How do you know that name?

588
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:12,532
You said it earlier. I...

589
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:17,704
He's With the DEA.

590
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:20,707
That piece of shit.

591
00:58:22,834 --> 00:58:25,587
Yeah, but that was the police
shooting at us.

592
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,590
Reich or Saucedo's guys,
it's the same thing.

593
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:31,968
They're all dirty,
and they're coming after me.

594
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:36,389
See, I used to run Tijuana,

595
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:40,602
the biggest border in the world.

596
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:44,731
Everything that came in and out
came through us,

597
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,025
Los Estrellas.

598
00:58:48,651 --> 00:58:52,488
And now, Saucedo is trying
to take it from me.

599
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:55,825
You thought I was a bad guy?

600
00:58:57,785 --> 00:58:59,329
I'm just playing their game, <i>chula.</i>

601
00:58:59,454 --> 00:59:02,081
- So, then why would...
- That's enough with the questions.

602
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:10,548
Go help in the kitchen.

603
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:25,855
Hey.

604
00:59:25,939 --> 00:59:27,148
My name is Isabel.

605
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:28,274
Start chopping-

606
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,536
I need all your cell phones.

607
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:43,122
What are you doing here anyway?

608
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,417
Are you Line's girl or something?

609
00:59:48,503 --> 00:59:49,587
Has he had you yet?

610
00:59:50,338 --> 00:59:51,339
Lino abducted me,

611
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,132
and they're threatening
to kill my friend's little brother.

612
00:59:53,216 --> 00:59:54,926
That's why I'm here. Okay?

613
00:59:56,094 --> 00:59:57,887
I didn't choose to be here, either.

614
00:59:57,971 --> 00:59:59,138
They threatened my family.

615
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,933
They own me.

616
01:00:05,895 --> 01:00:09,023
You cannot trust anything they say.

617
01:00:09,107 --> 01:00:10,108
Your phone?

618
01:00:10,191 --> 01:00:11,192
Here's my cell, asshole.

619
01:00:11,276 --> 01:00:12,902
Forget your friend, Gloria.

620
01:00:15,738 --> 01:00:17,282
No one's coming to save you.

621
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:31,921
Your phone.

622
01:00:32,964 --> 01:00:34,841
We're doing some housecleaning.

623
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:37,677
Pollito here is the maid.

624
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,430
He's real good at cleaning, you know?

625
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:57,405
Smells good, baby.

626
01:00:57,488 --> 01:00:58,614
Where's your phone?

627
01:00:58,698 --> 01:00:59,907
Right here.

628
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,209
Okay.

629
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:14,172
Keep chopping, Gloria.

630
01:01:14,255 --> 01:01:15,256
Chop, chop.

631
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:36,402
Okay.

632
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:19,070
Okay, okay, Okay-

633
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,741
No.

634
01:02:27,078 --> 01:02:28,246
Hey.

635
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:35,211
Please, please, please, please, please.

636
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:41,467
Shit.

637
01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:48,641
Okay.

638
01:03:12,874 --> 01:03:14,125
Where were you?

639
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,543
What were you doing?

640
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,462
I was just in the bathroom.

641
01:03:22,008 --> 01:03:23,009
What happened?

642
01:03:23,092 --> 01:03:24,719
You couldn't wait to get laid?

643
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:29,348
What are you doing?
The pozole is ruined.

644
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,229
Find that mole.

645
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,568
Get up.

646
01:04:24,111 --> 01:04:25,196
Get up.

647
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:49,595
Walk.

648
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:04,860
- Where are we going?
- We're almost there.

649
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:05,987
Stop.

650
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:32,013
If you run into a thing
like we ran into yesterday,

651
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,849
you gotta learn how to defend yourself.

652
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:40,855
You gotta learn how to use one of these.

653
01:05:40,938 --> 01:05:42,106
Here's an erre.

654
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:45,568
An AR-15 rifle.

655
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:48,446
Made in the USA.

656
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:51,699
Press on this button here.

657
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,159
It's a magazine.

658
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:57,038
La bala, the bullet.

659
01:05:57,747 --> 01:05:59,665
La bala settles everything.

660
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:03,836
You pop it into the magazine right here.

661
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:08,674
Then you slide the magazine back in.

662
01:06:09,467 --> 01:06:10,676
Then you pull the charging handle.

663
01:06:14,055 --> 01:06:15,097
Here's your safety.

664
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,308
Thumb down, safety off.

665
01:06:18,476 --> 01:06:20,478
Thumb up, safety on.

666
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:22,313
All right?

667
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,198
Now you try it.

668
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:40,956
Come on.

669
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:45,378
You're not gonna be
as lucky as you were yesterday.

670
01:06:54,845 --> 01:06:56,097
No, no, no, no, no.

671
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,348
Magazine first.

672
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:00,351
There you go.

673
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,861
You got to press it.

674
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:13,280
All right.

675
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:15,074
Against your shoulder.

676
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:21,997
No,no,no.

677
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,417
You got to keep both eyes open, okay?

678
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,502
You got to use your dominant eye.

679
01:07:27,712 --> 01:07:31,757
'Cause if you don't...
'Cause if you close the wrong one,

680
01:07:31,841 --> 01:07:33,843
then you're not gonna be able
to see your target.

681
01:07:34,176 --> 01:07:35,261
There we go.

682
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:36,929
Keep both eyes open.

683
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:03,831
Here.

684
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,257
Try it again.

685
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:20,639
Empty it out.

686
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:48,000
What about Suzu?

687
01:08:51,754 --> 01:08:53,672
My boy Wicho is on it.

688
01:08:53,756 --> 01:08:56,091
He's my IT guy, and he's real good.

689
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:58,469
He's checked the hospitals
and the morgues,

690
01:08:58,552 --> 01:09:00,471
and she's not there,
so that means she's alive.

691
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:05,184
Listen, I told you I'd find her.

692
01:09:07,603 --> 01:09:09,104
For now, I'd...

693
01:09:10,022 --> 01:09:11,649
I'd like you to take a shower.

694
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:57,695
You like it?

695
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:01,907
Where are we going?

696
01:10:19,091 --> 01:10:20,092
Lino.

697
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,223
Lino!

698
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:32,313
We just finished the barbecue.

699
01:10:32,396 --> 01:10:34,315
Perfect, I'm hungry.

700
01:10:34,398 --> 01:10:36,025
I have a table for you over here.

701
01:10:36,108 --> 01:10:37,860
It's so great to see you.

702
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:41,488
You look really skinny.
Why don't you eat?

703
01:10:51,498 --> 01:10:53,208
You had barbacoa before?

704
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,794
Nah.

705
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:57,463
Not like this one.

706
01:10:58,756 --> 01:10:59,757
Come on.

707
01:11:00,341 --> 01:11:02,009
- Here.
-l'm not hungry.

708
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:03,302
You got to be hungry.

709
01:11:11,393 --> 01:11:12,394
$0?

710
01:11:14,813 --> 01:11:15,856
It's good.

711
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:18,025
Just "good"?

712
01:11:23,072 --> 01:11:24,281
That's what I thought.

713
01:11:25,157 --> 01:11:27,451
That's how you eat some barbacoa, guey.

714
01:11:27,534 --> 01:11:32,164
That is what I am talking about.

715
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:33,582
Let's go.

716
01:11:45,427 --> 01:11:46,845
I grew up around here, you know?

717
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:50,766
Till I was about six or seven.

718
01:11:51,517 --> 01:11:55,729
I used to just dream about this place
when I was back in the U.S.

719
01:11:57,564 --> 01:11:59,775
I wanted to come back so bad.

720
01:12:01,986 --> 01:12:03,445
You know, I just never felt like

721
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,948
I belonged anywhere.

722
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,034
Then my moms and I got deported,

723
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:13,872
and when I was back,
I was too gringo to be Mexican,

724
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:15,874
too Mexican to be gringo.

725
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:19,795
So, I had to be tough.

726
01:12:21,463 --> 01:12:23,257
And I learned to get what was mine.

727
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:29,680
One day, I'm gonna buy
all the land around here.

728
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:31,765
I could just build a big ranch.

729
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:35,394
Live off the land and shit.

730
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,321
Hey.

731
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:55,372
We found the snitch.

732
01:12:55,456 --> 01:12:56,749
Everybody's waiting.

733
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:09,803
Bitch had it in her battery.

734
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:31,408
Isabel

735
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:40,000
Los Estrellas will not stand

736
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:45,172
for cowardice or treason con cualquiera.

737
01:13:51,512 --> 01:13:52,971
No, no.

738
01:13:53,055 --> 01:13:54,515
No,no,no.

739
01:13:54,598 --> 01:13:55,724
Chivo.

740
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:57,684
No, no, no, no, no.

741
01:13:57,768 --> 01:13:59,394
Let me just talk to him. Lino, no!

742
01:13:59,478 --> 01:14:00,813
You can't. No.

743
01:14:00,896 --> 01:14:02,731
Please let me talk to him.

744
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:05,192
Please. Let me go back.

745
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,361
Let me go back, please.

746
01:14:09,571 --> 01:14:10,614
No.

747
01:14:14,743 --> 01:14:16,370
Oh, my God.

748
01:14:17,204 --> 01:14:18,288
Oh, my God.

749
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,503
<i>Listen, chula.</i>

750
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:10,340
Sometimes, you have to do
terrible things to survive.

751
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:14,845
Tomorrow's gonna be better.

752
01:15:16,513 --> 01:15:17,723
I promise.

753
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:22,561
Just get some sleep.

754
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,241
Feeling better?

755
01:16:21,787 --> 01:16:23,622
You have a big day ahead of you.

756
01:16:25,165 --> 01:16:26,667
Dona Rosita is here.

757
01:16:30,712 --> 01:16:31,755
Hey.

758
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:37,928
Mira, this.

759
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:42,516
This will fit you just right.

760
01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:43,642
Try them on.

761
01:16:44,309 --> 01:16:46,144
- What?
- These are for you.

762
01:16:46,812 --> 01:16:48,480
Okay? For today.

763
01:16:50,274 --> 01:16:52,359
What do you want from me?

764
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:53,986
What do you want?

765
01:16:54,069 --> 01:16:56,113
- Calm down, <i>chula.</i>
- No, I'm not going to calm down.

766
01:16:56,196 --> 01:16:58,949
All right? I want to know
what this is all about!

767
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,951
I want to know! Tell me what's going on!

768
01:17:01,034 --> 01:17:03,370
Hey, hey. You're gonna be my queen.

769
01:17:04,371 --> 01:17:07,332
I'm gonna send you to the
Miss Baja California pageant.

770
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,251
What? What?

771
01:17:09,334 --> 01:17:11,503
No. No, I don't want to do this.

772
01:17:11,586 --> 01:17:13,088
No. I don't... I want to go.

773
01:17:13,255 --> 01:17:14,589
I want to leave right now.

774
01:17:14,673 --> 01:17:15,966
- Listen to me.
- No.

775
01:17:16,049 --> 01:17:18,427
Listen to you? I can't.

776
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,679
I can't. I can't do this anymore.

777
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:23,140
You're just gonna end up killing me
like you killed that other woman, okay?

778
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:24,725
So, just kill me, then!

779
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,977
- I want to go. Please!
- Listen to me.

780
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:29,438
No! Just let me go! Let me...

781
01:17:29,521 --> 01:17:31,315
Get out of my way!

782
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:43,535
There's something you need to see.

783
01:17:51,752 --> 01:17:53,253
Where did you get this?

784
01:17:55,922 --> 01:17:57,424
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

785
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,301
Where did you get this?

786
01:17:59,384 --> 01:18:02,304
You know who Rafael Saucedo is?

787
01:18:03,221 --> 01:18:04,723
Yeah, he's the chief of police.

788
01:18:04,806 --> 01:18:06,558
He's also a corrupt piece of shit.

789
01:18:07,225 --> 01:18:09,227
He has your friend. Yeah.

790
01:18:09,311 --> 01:18:12,773
The police, they took her
the night after the shootout.

791
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:15,817
They run girls, throw parties.

792
01:18:15,901 --> 01:18:17,027
They always have.

793
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,362
Where did you get this from?

794
01:18:18,445 --> 01:18:19,613
Wicho.

795
01:18:20,614 --> 01:18:24,034
He posed as one of the johns,
and they sent him that video.

796
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:25,202
Yeah.

797
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:28,372
They're offering her up
for Saucedo's after-party.

798
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:31,041
They got her all booked up.

799
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,834
She's all busy.

800
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:35,045
All night.

801
01:18:42,886 --> 01:18:44,388
Sorry you had to see this.

802
01:18:49,851 --> 01:18:51,061
You can decide.

803
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,899
Saucedo is my enemy, as he is yours.

804
01:18:57,359 --> 01:18:58,568
And your friend,

805
01:18:59,611 --> 01:19:01,446
she's gonna be there tonight.

806
01:19:03,532 --> 01:19:06,118
Tonight's your chance to get her back.

807
01:19:07,577 --> 01:19:08,620
How?

808
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:14,418
Saucedo always invites
the winner of the pageant to his party.

809
01:19:15,919 --> 01:19:19,256
I need him alone in the bedroom.

810
01:19:20,882 --> 01:19:21,925
No.

811
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:26,680
No. You... You want me to...

812
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:29,307
I want you to do whatever it takes.

813
01:19:33,937 --> 01:19:35,772
This is how you get your friend back.

814
01:19:59,212 --> 01:20:01,381
Chivo will be with you the whole way.

815
01:20:04,009 --> 01:20:05,093
Now,

816
01:20:07,012 --> 01:20:10,557
I need you to listen carefully, <i>chula.</i>

817
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:19,733
For this to work out,

818
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:23,945
<i>you need to believe
that you belong up there.</i>

819
01:20:31,661 --> 01:20:33,371
<i>You just have to look confident.</i>

820
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:42,172
<i>We bought the judges.</i>

821
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:53,225
<i>Everyone works for us now.</i>

822
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:05,445
<i>Play your pan'-</i>

823
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,665
<i>...Miss Baja California.</i>

824
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:31,471
<i>You can do this.</i>

825
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,807
<i>For your friend.</i>

826
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,242
Our three finalists are

827
01:21:52,325 --> 01:21:54,077
<i>Marilyn Martinez,</i>

828
01:21:56,663 --> 01:21:58,456
<i>Gloria Fuentes,</i>

829

<i>Melina Dona.</i>

830
01:22:08,466 --> 01:22:10,010
And now presenting...

831
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,679
the second runner up...

832
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:21,146
There are only two contestants left

833
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:23,315
and only one can be
Miss Baja California.

834
01:22:24,691 --> 01:22:26,651
The first runner up...

835
01:22:27,652 --> 01:22:30,697
<i>When they call your name, act surprised.</i>

836
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:34,492
The new Miss Baja California...

837
01:22:34,576 --> 01:22:36,870
<i>Gloria Fuentes!</i>

838
01:23:05,899 --> 01:23:07,609
<i>Now, this is critical.</i>

839
01:23:08,526 --> 01:23:10,487
<i>Once you've won, a man will come to you</i>

840
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,573
<i>with a message from Saucedo,
inviting you to his party.</i>

841
01:23:13,657 --> 01:23:16,368
<i>Just smile and accept.</i>

842
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:19,329
<i>Okay, fotos, finalistas, por favor.</i>

843
01:23:21,122 --> 01:23:22,457
Congratulations.

844
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:44,521
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

845
01:23:44,604 --> 01:23:45,814
Are you ready?

846
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,734
I'm ready.

847
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:55,532
<i>I will guide you through this device.</i>

848
01:23:56,074 --> 01:23:57,784
<i>I can hear everything through it.</i>

849
01:23:58,743 --> 01:24:00,161
<i>Just speak loud enough.</i>

850
01:24:02,163 --> 01:24:05,125
<i>Once you get in that car,
we won't be able to protect you.</i>

851
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:10,880
<i>We think the party's on
one of the properties south of Rosarito.</i>

852
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,071
Miss Baja California.

853
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,118
Gloria.

854
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:00,722
We have girls
from all the top escort services.

855
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:31,753
Get Saucedo to invite you to his room.

856
01:25:49,562 --> 01:25:51,481
Miss Baja California.

857
01:25:51,564 --> 01:25:53,691
Please, call me Gloria.

858
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:55,443
What an honor to have you here.

859
01:25:55,527 --> 01:25:57,237
You are too sweet, General.

860
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,738
I have a question.

861
01:26:00,615 --> 01:26:02,075
How's your evening going?

862
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,120
Everything is good.

863
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,547
Miss, will you follow me?

864
01:26:25,723 --> 01:26:29,227
Wait here. In a few minutes
I'll take you next door.

865
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,311
Do you understand?

866
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:32,730
<i>We need that location.</i>

867
01:26:36,317 --> 01:26:38,695
- Villa <i>102.
- Got it.</i>

868
01:26:38,778 --> 01:26:40,196
<i>Protect yourself.</i>

869
01:26:41,322 --> 01:26:42,407
<i>Good</i> luck, <i>chula.</i>

870
01:26:59,591 --> 01:27:00,675
Oh, my God.

871
01:27:04,804 --> 01:27:06,806
- I found you.
- Oh, my God.

872
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:07,891
I finally found you.

873
01:27:07,974 --> 01:27:10,059
Oh, my God, I thought you were dead.

874
01:27:12,145 --> 01:27:13,646
Are you hurt?

875
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:15,857
Are you okay? What happened?

876
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,526
They... They...
They took me after the shootout.

877
01:27:18,610 --> 01:27:20,486
They led me into a car, and...

878
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:22,864
I just thought they were cops, you know?

879
01:27:23,865 --> 01:27:25,450
They made me do things, chinita.

880
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:27,243
They told me they would hurt Chava.

881
01:27:27,911 --> 01:27:29,871
They sold me into the system.

882
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:32,749
They gave me this.

883
01:27:35,501 --> 01:27:36,502
What?

884
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:40,131
Los Estrellas.

885
01:27:44,093 --> 01:27:45,178
Lino did this.

886
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:47,472
What are you doing here?

887
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:49,015
I told you to wait over there.

888
01:27:49,349 --> 01:27:50,475
Let's go next door.

889
01:27:50,558 --> 01:27:51,559
Sorry.

890
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,126
What a beautiful girl.

891
01:28:20,755 --> 01:28:23,633
This red dress turns me on.

892
01:28:26,970 --> 01:28:27,971
Take off your dress.

893
01:28:29,806 --> 01:28:31,391
I'll get you a drink.

894
01:29:02,463 --> 01:29:04,966
I told you to take off your dress.

895
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:07,468
Don't you understand me?

896
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,404
Hey.

897
01:29:40,752 --> 01:29:41,753
Get in the bed.

898
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,443
Lino, Saucedo is here.

899
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:39,310
Huicho, grenade launcher.

900
01:31:09,382 --> 01:31:10,424
Help me.

901
01:31:33,865 --> 01:31:35,658
Gloria!

902
01:31:35,741 --> 01:31:36,742
Suzu?

903
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:41,622
Suzu!

904
01:31:45,126 --> 01:31:46,586
Suzu!

905
01:31:46,669 --> 01:31:47,670
Come on.

906
01:31:49,797 --> 01:31:51,132
Suzu!

907
01:31:51,507 --> 01:31:52,758
Suzu?

908
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:55,219
Glo? Gloria.

909
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,185
Go!

910
01:32:03,769 --> 01:32:04,770
Don't!

911
01:32:12,153 --> 01:32:13,154
Gloria.

912
01:32:46,437 --> 01:32:47,438
Nice job, <i>chula.</i>

913
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:50,650
Piece of shit.

914
01:33:05,289 --> 01:33:06,582
You got to finish the job.

915
01:33:14,924 --> 01:33:15,967
Suzu.

916
01:33:21,097 --> 01:33:22,181
See?

917
01:33:22,265 --> 01:33:23,891
I told you we'd find your friend.

918
01:33:25,768 --> 01:33:27,645
Show him your hand.

919
01:33:34,443 --> 01:33:36,237
You knew where she was all along.

920
01:33:41,701 --> 01:33:44,745
I did what I had to do, <i>chula.</i>

921
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:51,794
We both did.

922
01:33:55,464 --> 01:33:56,924
Both eyes open.

923
01:34:47,308 --> 01:34:48,601
Let's go, Suzu.

924
01:35:16,045 --> 01:35:19,382
Last night in a fierce gun battle,

925
01:35:19,465 --> 01:35:22,468
esteemed Chief Saucedo killed

926
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:24,595
Lino Esparza,

927
01:35:24,678 --> 01:35:28,182
head of the criminal organization,
Los Estrellas.

928
01:35:28,808 --> 01:35:30,976
Saucedo died heroically,

929
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:34,522
trying to free a group
of female hostages.

930
01:35:53,958 --> 01:35:55,000
Jimmy.

931
01:35:56,877 --> 01:35:59,713
I don't envy your position, Gloria.

932
01:36:03,259 --> 01:36:07,012
I almost didn't recognize you
without your tattoos and your knife.

933
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:11,183
You've changed a lot since I saw you
in that warehouse in San Diego.

934
01:36:16,355 --> 01:36:17,815
You're a survivor.

935
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,485
Walking out of a shootout like that.

936
01:36:21,569 --> 01:36:22,611
Shit.

937
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:25,489
Making it through any of the things

938
01:36:25,573 --> 01:36:28,284
you've been through
in the past few days is...

939
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:29,452
What do you want?

940
01:36:33,747 --> 01:36:35,332
I want some coffee.

941
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:37,835
You want some?

942
01:37:10,784 --> 01:37:13,078
Looks like you had a busy night, Gloria.

943
01:37:15,206 --> 01:37:18,959
You killed a cartel leader
and Tijuana's chief of police.

944
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:21,837
With your guns.

945
01:37:25,925 --> 01:37:29,178
Someone like you
could be very useful to us.

946
01:37:33,432 --> 01:37:35,267
I think I'm gonna need
something from you first.

947
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:40,022
I want to be released immediately.

948
01:37:40,105 --> 01:37:41,315
Cleared of all charges.

949
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:45,361
And one more thing.

950
01:38:02,962 --> 01:38:04,046
Chava!

951
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:19,270
Gloria!
