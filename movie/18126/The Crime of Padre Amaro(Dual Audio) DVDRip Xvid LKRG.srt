Based on the novel written by
Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz in 1 8 75

2
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:07,397
Aldama Mexico, 2002

3
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,421
No, thank you.

4
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:08,159
-Are you going to Santa Marta?
-No, l'm staying in Los Reyes.

5
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:10,764
Do you live there?

6
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,599
l'm going to open a store with
my grandson in Santa Marta.

7
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,203
l saved up the money they
gave me for my lands.

8
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:23,774
lf the store doesn't go well,
l'll cross over to the other side.

9
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:27,819
-l have a daughter over there.
-That's great. Great.

10
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:07,420
-Lights on, asshole!
-Good evening!

11
00:03:07,628 --> 00:03:10,426
-Hands up!
-You're screwed!

12
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:13,260
What are you looking at?
Damn woman!

13
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:15,526
Give me the watch, damn it!

14
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:18,234
Hurry! Hurry, asshole!

15
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,600
The watch, damn it!

16
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:20,899
What's this?

17
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,474
-Give it!
-The chain.

18
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,873
Don't fuck with me! Hurry, asshole!

19
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:26,206
Okay, let's go!

20
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,144
-Have a nice evening.
-And a good trip.

21
00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:27,897
Here.

22
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:31,601
This will help a little.

23
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:05,976
-What are you doing here?
-Hi, kiddo!

24
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:09,583
l thought you were in Aldama.
Didn't you get a job?

25
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:11,752
-Well....
-What?

26
00:05:11,953 --> 00:05:14,478
l've been hired by El Independiente.

27
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:16,284
Congratulations!

28
00:05:16,724 --> 00:05:17,850
l came to see you.

29
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:22,155
-Me or your father?
-You, only you, Amelia.

30
00:05:22,563 --> 00:05:24,394
Now we can get married.

31
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,630
-Someone will see us.
-Come on, let's talk.

32
00:05:27,835 --> 00:05:31,498
-l have to teach catechism.
-Catechism's in the afternoon.

33
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,504
They're preparing for
their First Communion.

34
00:05:35,042 --> 00:05:36,839
And what about me?

35
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:40,502
-l'll see you tomorrow.
-l can't tomorrow.

36
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:42,613
Of course you can.

37
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:48,478
Tomorrow at 8:00 mass, okay?

38
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:06,731
That's it. The game is over. Come here.

39
00:06:06,941 --> 00:06:09,205
Chepina, why didn't you
start catechism?

40
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,776
-These kids!
-Stop playing.

41
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:13,139
The ball.

42
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:14,837
Give me the ball.

43
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,508
We're not going to play anymore.

44
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,851
The ball! The ball!

45
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:23,718
Excuse me, where can l find
Father Benito?

46
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,917
Thank you. Over there.

47
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,461
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

48
00:06:29,664 --> 00:06:31,791
The ball. The ball.

49
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:34,491
-Who is he?
-l don't know.

50
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,284
So you are Father Amaro.

51
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:38,891
The bishop told me so much about you
that l was looking forward to meeting.

52
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,857
l was recently ordained.

53
00:07:41,936 --> 00:07:45,895
That's precisely why, because
you are young and tender.

54
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:49,736
He thinks of a young priest
to temper him in this town.

55
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:54,904
And then to send him to Rome to study
Moral Theology or Canon Law.

56
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:59,013
-l just want to serve God, Father.
-Yes, yes, of course.

57
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:03,350
That's why he sent you to me, an ogre.
To test you.

58
00:08:03,824 --> 00:08:08,056
Just remember, a priest who barks
doesn't bite.

59
00:08:08,262 --> 00:08:11,527
Come, come, l'll show you
the parish house.

60
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,627
lt's no great thing.

61
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,899
Here is the chapel.

62
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:23,103
The bishop wanted us
to start a seminary...

63
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,474
...for Bible and pastoral studies
with the priests in the diocese.

64
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:32,085
But it didn't work out.
Some of us still meet every month.

65
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:40,787
The bathroom is there,
and your room at the end.

66
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:45,293
Sanjuanera does the cleaning.
l eat lunch and dinner at her place.

67
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:47,729
You'll have to do the same.

68
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:52,130
lt hasn't been occupied for some time.

69
00:08:52,373 --> 00:08:57,310
You'll only be here a short time,
if you please me and the bishop.

70
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:00,875
Thank you.

71
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:40,182
What's up, Doc? What's new?

72
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,685
l'm just hustling your father.

73
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:45,255
-Hi, Dad.
-Hello, son.

74
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,927
Weren't you going out with Amelia?

75
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,820
She couldn't.
She had catechism all day.

76
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:56,031
l told you, son. That girl has her
brain confused by prayer.

77
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:59,372
Why don't you find
a more liberal girl?

78
00:09:59,607 --> 00:10:02,940
-Not that wafer-eater!
-Priest-hater, it's your turn.

79
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,073
l am going to check you.

80
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,806
Tell me when you want a story
that will rile them up.

81
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,008
l'll give you all the information
on the priests in the area.

82
00:10:13,254 --> 00:10:17,054
l've got the dope on all of those fools!

83
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:18,857
l told you, Paco.

84
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:20,353
Double check.

85
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:21,856
Damn it all to hell!

86
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:25,395
Why do you take advantage
when l'm talking to the boy?

87
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:28,164
Yes, Don Chato, yes.

88
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:32,562
l got what you sent, but it's in
dollars and l can't change them.

89
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:36,274
l would appreciate that, Don Chato.

90
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:38,134
Yes.

91
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:42,443
l'll tell the engineer, Don Chato.
Go on.

92
00:10:43,784 --> 00:10:45,251
Where are you going?

93
00:10:45,719 --> 00:10:47,550
To the bathroom.

94
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:54,623
When do you want to have
the baptism?

95
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,523
Yes, Don Chato.
Of course, it will be a pleasure.

96
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,031
l'll be there.

97
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,417
The body of Christ.

98
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:41,932
God grant you more.

99
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:46,670
We pray for your help all over the world,
for your message...

100
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,938
God grant you more.

101
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,777
...and for our Holy Father John Paul ll...

102
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:53,112
...and all of us who are working...

103
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:55,255
-God grant you more.
-...all of us gathered here...

104
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:58,892
-...fulfill us with your love and friendship.
-God grant you more.

105
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,623
This is the Lamb of God
who takes away the sins of the world.

106
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:06,765
Fortunate the ones invited
to the supper of the Lord.

107
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,732
Lord, l am not worthy to receive you...

108
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,668
...but only say the word
and l shall be healed.

109
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,180
The body of Christ.

110
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:30,883
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

111
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,520
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

112
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:40,825
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

113
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:48,799
-The body of Christ.
-Amen.

114
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,510
The body of Christ.

115
00:13:05,426 --> 00:13:08,224
Amelia likes the new priest.

116
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,035
-ls that priest new?
-Are you mad?

117
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:27,805
-l am here, aren't l?
-You never take communion.

118
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,848
-l don't believe in that stuff.
-ln God?

119
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:33,519
You care more about mass
than about us.

120
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,245
Do you believe in God?

121
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:38,357
Maybe, but not the way the priests
picture him.

122
00:13:38,525 --> 00:13:40,220
You're a communist, Ruben!

123
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:44,455
-Don't be foolish.
-Goodbye, Amelia, God bless you.

124
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,655
l'm home, little Salome.

125
00:14:10,691 --> 00:14:14,650
l brought you your medicine.
The body of Christ.

126
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,596
Amen.

127
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:28,670
-Tell me if you like the tamarindo.
-Thank you.

128
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,341
Agustina.

129
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,571
Father!

130
00:14:34,882 --> 00:14:36,281
This is Father Amaro.

131
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,283
Welcome.

132
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,214
l'm glad to see you, Father.

133
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,515
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello. Likewise.

134
00:14:44,691 --> 00:14:46,352
My daughter told me.

135
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,551
Very young and very handsome.

136
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,189
Priests are neither young
nor handsome.

137
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,697
We are ministers of the Lord.

138
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,032
What did l say?

139
00:14:57,638 --> 00:15:00,801
Don't pay him any mind.
He's just a grouchy old Spaniard.

140
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:05,000
But you ended up in the best place
to eat in the whole town.

141
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:06,611
l have mole de olla...

142
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,180
...and some bean picaditas.

143
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:10,509
-Picaditas.
-Yes?

144
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:14,084
-And for you? Your chicken broth.
-Thank you.

145
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,915
Saturday afternoon we're having
the meeting l told you about...

146
00:15:21,028 --> 00:15:23,428
...with the diocese priests.

147
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:27,294
The bishop is worried about
Father Natalio.

148
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:29,266
He's very headstrong.

149
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,502
Good afternoon, Father.

150
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,502
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

151
00:15:33,707 --> 00:15:37,040
What would you like to drink?
Sangria, a cold beer?

152
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:38,973
Just water, please.

153
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:41,878
She's Sanjuanera's daughter.

154
00:15:44,518 --> 00:15:47,544
l wanted to apologize
about the other day.

155
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:52,055
-l never thought you were a priest.
-Well, now you know, child.

156
00:15:53,894 --> 00:15:56,055
-For you, tequila, right?
-Yes.

157
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:02,964
l haven't told you about
our construction underway.

158
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:05,170
What construction?

159
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:08,340
A clinic on the outskirts of town
for the diocese.

160
00:16:08,542 --> 00:16:12,535
-The bishop asked me to build it.
-l could take him to the clinic.

161
00:16:12,913 --> 00:16:13,902
No.

162
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:18,985
Martin will go.
That's what the sexton is for.

163
00:16:19,953 --> 00:16:20,942
Go on.

164
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,440
ls this it?

165
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:48,974
Wow!

166
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,982
l didn't think it was so big.
My goodness, it's huge!

167
00:16:53,153 --> 00:16:57,749
Father Benito calls it a clinic
but it will be a full-fledged hospital.

168
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:02,391
Look, come over here.

169
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,992
On this side will be the
old people's home.

170
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:10,500
And over here the orphanage.
And all the rest is for the sick.

171
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:14,869
The people around here are very
generous with their donations.

172
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:18,375
Yes, especially the mayor
and his wife Amparito.

173
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:21,080
-She's very religious.
-Good afternoon.

174
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:23,178
l see you're a big hit.

175
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,443
Except with my boyfriend.

176
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,111
-The boy you were in mass with?
-Yeah, the big dope.

177
00:17:29,823 --> 00:17:34,658
-Did you break up?
-No, l'm just not in love.

178
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,890
Do you know the only one
l am devoted to?

179
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,996
Just to God.

180
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,429
Oh, that's nice.

181
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,036
Careful! Careful!

182
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,435
-l slipped.
-You okay?

183
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,271
-Yes. l'm fine.
-Yes?

184
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:56,680
-Thank you, Father.
-No, no. Don't do that.

185
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:03,813
Good morning.

186
00:18:04,091 --> 00:18:05,524
-Good morning.
-Hello.

187
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:19,496
Sanjuanera? How are you?
This is Ruben calling.

188
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:21,674
ls Amelia around?

189
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:25,100
This is the third time l've called her.

190
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:28,276
Yes, please tell her l need to talk to her.

191
00:18:28,615 --> 00:18:33,746
She has my number, it's 1 2-34-26,
extension 1 1 7.

192
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,887
Yes, tell her l miss her.

193
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:41,184
Okay, see you later, ma'am.
Thank you very much.

194
00:18:49,636 --> 00:18:51,160
Divine.

195
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:55,203
Father, Father.

196
00:18:57,544 --> 00:19:02,072
Now that you know my sins,
l want you to know my virtues.

197
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:07,144
This is for our Lady's altar.

198
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,811
She granted me a big miracle.

199
00:19:10,457 --> 00:19:12,891
And my husband sends this.

200
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,892
lt's for the hospital center.

201
00:19:16,763 --> 00:19:17,889
Thank you.

202
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:22,893
l am Amparito, at your service.
The mayor's wife.

203
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:28,397
Thank you.

204
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,963
-Holy Mary.
-Conceived without sin.

205
00:19:55,635 --> 00:19:57,296
Tell me your sins, child.

206
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:08,446
-Have you no sins?
-Yes.

207
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:12,477
l confess that l am very sensual,
Father.

208
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:17,218
What do you mean by sensual?

209
00:20:18,358 --> 00:20:20,155
Well, l'm very intense.

210
00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:24,997
l like to kiss my boyfriend,
and touch myself.

211
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,999
-You touch each other?
-No.

212
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,596
No, l touch myself, Father.

213
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,039
ln the shower, taking a bath.

214
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:39,674
l like to feel the water falling
on my body, and l caress myself.

215
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,446
ls that a sin?

216
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:46,242
No.

217
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:50,455
No, sensuality is no sin.

218
00:20:51,892 --> 00:20:55,919
The body and the soul
are the same essence. lt's normal.

219
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,762
But when l caress myself...

220
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,495
...l close my eyes and l think....

221
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:06,136
What do you think about?

222
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,468
Jesus.

223
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:13,140
What Jesus?

224
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,144
Jesus, our Lord, Father.

225
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,783
ls that a sin?

226
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:27,185
Yes, that is a sin.

227
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:33,761
Her mother died the day she was born.

228
00:21:34,701 --> 00:21:36,726
lt's always been like this.

229
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:41,434
She can't walk. She's like a little animal.

230
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,541
And sometimes she has fits.

231
00:21:44,744 --> 00:21:45,938
ls she a girl?

232
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:51,209
Her name is Getsemani.
That's how Father Benito baptized her.

233
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:54,177
Can she talk?

234
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:56,154
When she wants to.

235
00:21:56,356 --> 00:22:00,292
Come on, Getsemani, say hello
to Father Amaro.

236
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:07,032
Hello, hello.

237
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,501
But she understands everything.

238
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:13,438
Do you think the devil is
inside her, Father?

239
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,636
No, of course not.

240
00:22:15,942 --> 00:22:18,809
Father Benito exorcised her once.

241
00:22:19,446 --> 00:22:21,038
What do the doctors say?

242
00:22:21,848 --> 00:22:25,340
They've tried everything
and nothing works.

243
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:28,919
Not doctors, nor witch doctors.

244
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,552
Now l just give her some pills...

245
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,785
...to calm her down!

246
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,495
That's it, that's it. Look, look.

247
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:46,195
Do it! Look, look!

248
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,501
-Goal! What a goal!
-No, Father, he was offside.

249
00:22:49,676 --> 00:22:51,667
-That's a goal.
-He was offside.

250
00:22:51,845 --> 00:22:54,279
You're not even watching the game.

251
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:56,540
Turn that off, damn it.

252
00:22:56,716 --> 00:23:01,415
-There are only five minutes left.
-Not another minute!

253
00:23:06,826 --> 00:23:09,989
Let's get to business.
l don't think anyone else is coming.

254
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:15,198
Father Galvan is in the kitchen.
We could finish watching the game.

255
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:17,666
No matter.
What were you talking about?

256
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,701
The game, Father. What else?

257
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,270
Father Amaro here was giving
us his view on celibacy.

258
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:27,540
Yes. lf celibacy were optional...

259
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:31,206
...the church would avoid
a lot of trouble, don't you think?

260
00:23:33,219 --> 00:23:35,380
That's bullshit!

261
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:40,890
You'd sooner see a Mexican pope
than an end to the vow of celibacy.

262
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,789
Besides, what do we care?

263
00:23:43,763 --> 00:23:46,425
What we care about now...

264
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,965
...are the accusations against you...

265
00:23:49,135 --> 00:23:50,500
...Father Natalio.

266
00:23:50,837 --> 00:23:55,536
-What is this about, Father?
-Clear the way, gentlemen!

267
00:23:55,709 --> 00:23:57,904
You've never tasted anything like this.

268
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:02,515
To welcome Father Amaro,
monsignor's favorite.

269
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,616
-Don't say that.
-And why not?

270
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:07,479
The bishop himself just told me so.

271
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:11,283
''This is my beloved son in whom
l take great pleasure.''

272
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:15,189
-Don't blaspheme, Father Galvan.
-l'm sorry, but it's true.

273
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:19,889
Help yourselves, help yourselves.
You'll be licking your fingers.

274
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:25,263
Before we know it, they'll
name him adjunct bishop.

275
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:26,732
No.

276
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:32,540
l would like to know what
the accusations against me are.

277
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:39,507
The effects of your damned
liberation theology.

278
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,348
What does liberation theology
have to do--?

279
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:47,050
The Bishop has exact information,
very precise, Father Natalio...

280
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,888
...that you are protecting or helping...

281
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,792
...guerrillas in your area.

282
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:53,727
What guerrillas?

283
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,561
You give them weapons,
or hide them for them.

284
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:00,230
Lies! That isn't true.

285
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,898
There are no guerrillas,
just drug lords.

286
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:06,568
The Aguilar brothers' drug traffickers.
Chato Aguilar's men.

287
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:11,342
-l'm talking about guerrillas.
-l'm talking about traffickers.

288
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:15,850
The kind who invade peasant lands,
force people to plant poppies...

289
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:19,321
...and threaten or kill them
if they refuse to work for them.

290
00:25:19,492 --> 00:25:21,119
Gunmen and drug lords.

291
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:24,263
They are in my community
and they murder my people!

292
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:27,762
The bishop knows well of your
helping the guerrillas.

293
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:31,961
Then the bishop knows Chato Aguilar
launders money with donations.

294
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:34,470
All for your damn hospital center.

295
00:25:34,674 --> 00:25:37,472
-You don't understand anything!
-l understand it all!

296
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:39,942
l know what goes on in my community.

297
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,517
Well, if you won't listen to me,
face the consequences, Father Natalio.

298
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:55,921
Don't spoil our gathering, Natalio.
Let's have a good time.

299
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:19,712
-l'm drunk as a skunk.
-l'll hold him on this side.

300
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:21,080
One, two....

301
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,956
But how about those chiles rellenos?

302
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,924
-Weren't they amazing?
-Yes.

303
00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:31,723
Especially for you...

304
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,365
...God's favorite.

305
00:26:34,534 --> 00:26:36,365
Thank you, Galvan.

306
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:40,133
Careful.

307
00:26:48,915 --> 00:26:51,850
l would like you to visit
my community...

308
00:26:52,018 --> 00:26:55,920
...up near the mountains,
so you could see how we work.

309
00:26:56,222 --> 00:26:59,055
What's that you said
about the donations?

310
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:05,229
l suspect it, but l don't really know.

311
00:27:05,932 --> 00:27:07,923
l guess l went too far, right?

312
00:27:35,094 --> 00:27:36,425
Excuse me.

313
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:47,169
Why not anymore?

314
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:49,232
You know.

315
00:27:50,643 --> 00:27:53,339
But l could come
when he is saying mass.

316
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:57,742
Don't try my patience, for God's sake.

317
00:27:57,984 --> 00:28:02,080
Or you could come to my house
when Amelia isn't home.

318
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,558
You don't care about me anymore?

319
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,632
Excuse me, Father.

320
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:19,931
-Do you have any clothes to wash?
-l washed them myself. Thanks.

321
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,937
l'm so glad to see you, Father,
because...

322
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:27,205
...well, l wanted to...

323
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,677
...ask you a favor.

324
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:33,178
lt's Amelia, Father.

325
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,281
She broke up with her boyfriend,
who is really a good guy.

326
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:41,652
And now the poor thing
is crying his heart out.

327
00:28:42,395 --> 00:28:43,692
Where do l come in?

328
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:47,331
You have so much
influence on her, Father.

329
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,663
Convince her to make up with him.

330
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,631
l'll try. But l can't convince her
of anything she doesn't want.

331
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:57,340
Go on, it won't hurt you to help her.

332
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,841
Make her happy.

333
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:02,942
Okay.

334
00:29:04,217 --> 00:29:07,550
You're going to get better, okay?
First things first.

335
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:14,824
The body of Christ. Amen.

336
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:29,264
-You old bitch!
-No, no, Martin!

337
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:34,205
No, Martin, no!

338
00:30:19,258 --> 00:30:20,850
l'm here for Father Benito.

339
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,061
Just a second.

340
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:33,705
-Father.
-Yes?

341
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,408
Someone to see you.
He looks like a hit man.

342
00:30:36,576 --> 00:30:38,043
Yes, l'm all ready.

343
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,475
-Where are you going?
-To a baptism.

344
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:43,482
-Where?
-At the hacienda.

345
00:30:43,649 --> 00:30:44,638
What hacienda?

346
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:48,844
Son, you ask more questions
than the bishop. The hacienda.

347
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,633
Tiburon.

348
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,870
Welcome, Father Benito.

349
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,776
Here l am, Don Chato.
Here l am.

350
00:32:17,944 --> 00:32:19,809
-You look well.
-Yes.

351
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,072
-Everything in order?
-Everything.

352
00:32:22,248 --> 00:32:26,947
-And this mess with the dollars?
-l exchanged them at a very good price.

353
00:32:27,386 --> 00:32:29,786
-Where is the little one?
-Over there.

354
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:33,187
You're going to get stuffed
with succulent barbecue.

355
00:32:33,392 --> 00:32:37,055
l can't eat too much or l won't fit
into my vestments.

356
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,332
Tell me, when are you going
to visit the clinic?

357
00:32:48,307 --> 00:32:50,935
l baptize you with the name
of Maria Elena...

358
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:56,474
...in the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit...

359
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:57,946
...Amen.

360
00:33:22,575 --> 00:33:24,543
Nice pictures?

361
00:33:26,746 --> 00:33:29,010
l'd like to buy some from you.

362
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,214
l'd pay you well.

363
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:37,619
l'm in a lot of them.

364
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,887
l work for Mr. Aguilar.

365
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:46,998
l don't even develop them.
l give him the film and that's it.

366
00:33:47,266 --> 00:33:48,324
That's too bad.

367
00:34:11,891 --> 00:34:13,415
Galarza wants to see you.

368
00:34:13,993 --> 00:34:15,426
Thanks.

369
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,366
What's up?

370
00:34:22,902 --> 00:34:24,460
Look at this, Ruben.

371
00:34:26,572 --> 00:34:28,301
Chato Aguilar.

372
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,665
And Father Benito.

373
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:34,144
The priest is from your hometown,
right?

374
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,749
How did you get these?

375
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,818
A present someone brought me.

376
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:44,117
Someone who wants to fuck over
Chato Aguilar.

377
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,481
Chato Aguilar or Father Benito?

378
00:34:47,426 --> 00:34:50,623
l could just publish them
and be done with it...

379
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:53,390
...but it's worth investigating.
lt's a big story.

380
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:55,056
lnterested?

381
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,198
lt's my town, everyone knows me there.

382
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:05,711
lf you don't want to do it,
l'll give it to Ramiro.

383
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,602
lt's up to you.

384
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,742
Fuck it. l'll do it.

385
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:16,817
And not just the hospital center,
there's more.

386
00:35:17,056 --> 00:35:20,958
Then the whole construction
is with Chato Aguilar's money.

387
00:35:21,193 --> 00:35:24,560
That's right.
Here are the contracts, costs....

388
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:26,894
Goddamn, this is a lot.

389
00:35:27,066 --> 00:35:28,556
And there's still more.

390
00:35:28,768 --> 00:35:32,397
Here are testimonials
from people in the mountains.

391
00:35:32,638 --> 00:35:34,299
What's that about?

392
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,870
About Father Natalio.

393
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:42,309
A guy named Natalio Perez who
lives in the hills and joined the guerrilla.

394
00:35:42,882 --> 00:35:44,281
Didn't you know?

395
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,318
No. Hey, but where did you get
all these facts?

396
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:52,389
Son, a lot of investigating...

397
00:35:52,591 --> 00:35:54,115
...and some help.

398
00:35:54,794 --> 00:35:57,661
You know, l should have been
a reporter.

399
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:08,774
-Thank you. Could l have more lime?
-Oops. Sorry.

400
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,208
Forgive me.

401
00:36:31,797 --> 00:36:37,235
Great! This will boost circulation
in a hurry. Damn!

402
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:41,463
You almost didn't make it, man.

403
00:36:42,174 --> 00:36:43,971
See you around.

404
00:36:46,779 --> 00:36:47,973
Hello.

405
00:36:58,357 --> 00:36:59,722
Here you are, Don Matias.

406
00:36:59,892 --> 00:37:01,587
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

407
00:37:01,894 --> 00:37:03,862
Have you seen this, Sanjuanera?

408
00:37:04,063 --> 00:37:05,587
CHURCH LlNKED TO
DRUGS AND GUERRlLLA

409
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,926
Holy Mother of God!

410
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:14,263
And l thought you were the one
paying for the hospital center.

411
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,509
What we gave would only
have been enough for a clinic.

412
00:37:17,676 --> 00:37:19,940
But damn Father Benito wanted more.

413
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,376
Did you see who signed the article?

414
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:24,778
-Ruben.
-What Ruben?

415
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,386
Ruben de la Rosa.
The son of Don Paco, the heretic.

416
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:30,487
Damn Father Benito, son of a....

417
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,557
You have to do something, Gordo.
You're the mayor.

418
00:37:35,895 --> 00:37:37,226
No way!

419
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:41,662
You have to keep your distance
from priests, like Benito Juarez said.

420
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,274
Father Natalio is late.

421
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:52,476
You can bet he isn't coming.

422
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:59,746
l told him not to mess with the rebels.
But he was pig-headed!

423
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:03,320
The accusations against him
aren't clear and refutable.

424
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,390
The journalist states opinion, not facts.

425
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:09,592
He says his people have nothing
to do with guerrillas.

426
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,089
l believe him.

427
00:38:18,604 --> 00:38:21,004
And what about Chato Aguilar, Father?

428
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:26,709
That's an entirely different thing.

429
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,877
l always thought...have thought...

430
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:33,917
...that we shouldn't be too picky
about money for good works.

431
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:38,520
-Even if it comes from Chato Aguilar?
-lt's laundering drug money.

432
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:43,559
The true cleansing
is in the eyes of God.

433
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:47,491
lt is bad money that turns good.

434
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:05,113
Yes, hello?

435
00:39:05,317 --> 00:39:07,444
Yes, speaking, Bishop.

436
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:08,983
l want to tell you....

437
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,988
Yes, yes, but....

438
00:39:12,157 --> 00:39:14,591
l understand, Bishop.

439
00:39:14,994 --> 00:39:16,655
Yes, yes.

440
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,097
As you wish. lf you'd like,
l can go tomorrow.

441
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:27,336
Oh. l'll tell him right away.

442
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:30,271
Yes.

443
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,773
Conceived without sin.

444
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,817
Do you want me to go with you?

445
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,445
No, not me.
He doesn't want to see me.

446
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,657
He just wants you to go.

447
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:51,487
Extension 1 5, please.

448
00:39:53,866 --> 00:39:55,697
You are a son of a bitch, Ruben!

449
00:39:55,868 --> 00:40:00,635
ldiot, dope, faggot, damned apostate!

450
00:40:00,806 --> 00:40:03,274
Renegade, asshole...

451
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,034
...two-legged insect!

452
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,636
lt was all a lie, wasn't it, Father?

453
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,103
What?

454
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:38,934
What the newspapers say about
Father Benito.

455
00:40:39,111 --> 00:40:40,942
Pure slander, Martin.

456
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,948
l think the devil came to this town
many years ago, Father.

457
00:40:47,953 --> 00:40:49,853
He built his lair here.

458
00:41:24,156 --> 00:41:26,886
The bishop is expecting you, Father.

459
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,052
Wait here, Martin.

460
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:46,205
What a joy to see you, son!
Come in, come in.

461
00:41:47,246 --> 00:41:50,340
Put me through to the mayor
of Los Reyes, Sister.

462
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:52,279
-Have a seat.
-Thank you.

463
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:57,381
We are here to address
heaven's issues on Earth.

464
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,581
See why l sent you to Los Reyes?

465
00:41:59,925 --> 00:42:03,861
That Benito is a calamity.
Look at the scandal he got us into.

466
00:42:04,029 --> 00:42:08,193
All because he is so stubborn
about having a first-world hospital.

467
00:42:08,367 --> 00:42:10,733
Did you know about Chato Aguilar,
Monsignor?

468
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,703
Where sin is plentiful, grace
will be more plentiful, son.

469
00:42:14,873 --> 00:42:19,139
Even saints make mistakes.
The important thing is to recognize them.

470
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:25,845
Don't make a sour face.
For God all things can be remedied.

471
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,113
l already spoke with the director
of that rag.

472
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,191
We're going to publish a rebuttal.

473
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,225
You will write it.

474
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:42,264
Yes, Sister?

475
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,326
Hello?

476
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:52,871
Gordo.

477
00:42:53,045 --> 00:42:55,411
The bishop is on the phone.

478
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:58,909
Those priests. l'm not going.

479
00:43:01,687 --> 00:43:02,676
No, no.

480
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:04,322
At your service, Bishop.

481
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,718
No, no. lt's just a lot of noise
about nothing.

482
00:43:10,729 --> 00:43:14,688
No, Bishop. Don't say that.
l can't say l gave all that money.

483
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:17,427
lt's in the millions. They'll lynch me.

484
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,004
Oh, that's okay.

485
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:25,199
lf you take responsibility for half,
l'll vouch for the other half.

486
00:43:26,245 --> 00:43:29,976
Fine. Perfect. l'll send the fax
to the newspaper tomorrow.

487
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:31,505
Yes, Bishop.

488
00:43:33,285 --> 00:43:34,616
See you later.

489
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:40,549
-Will everything be all right now?
-Yes, yes, yes.

490
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:45,421
There's no worse politics
than black politics.

491
00:43:46,098 --> 00:43:47,360
Fucking priests.

492
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:51,898
Don't let your party hear you,
they'll burn you alive.

493
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:55,902
l govern for the people,
not the party.

494
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,240
No shit?

495
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:07,544
For his activities, l'll take Father
Natalio out of his community.

496
00:44:07,719 --> 00:44:10,449
He swears there are no guerrillas
in his area.

497
00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:15,219
l'll lock him up with the nuns.
Let him take care of them.

498
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:19,586
-Bishop, if you will allow me an opinion--
-Relax, son.

499
00:44:20,165 --> 00:44:23,396
l know how tiresome all this is for you.

500
00:44:23,802 --> 00:44:28,637
But first we have to get the work done.
Then you will come to my side...

501
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:30,900
...and learn to run the diocese.

502
00:44:32,644 --> 00:44:35,340
-Thank you.
-Goodbye, son.

503
00:45:00,606 --> 00:45:02,039
lsn't that excessive?

504
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:04,441
No, it seems fair to me.

505
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:09,639
What if we decide not to run
your rebuttal?

506
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,479
Your newspaper is doing well.

507
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,616
The readers have trusted us for years.

508
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,315
We always report the truth.

509
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,988
And is truth supported by readers,
or ads?

510
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:30,324
lt would only take the bishop
one phone call...

511
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:32,265
...to end the advertising.

512
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:38,198
He wouldn't do such a thing, of course.

513
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:44,080
The rebuttal is to go on the front page,
in big type.

514
00:45:44,249 --> 00:45:46,444
The mayor's statement, well...

515
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:48,984
...put that wherever you like.

516
00:45:51,657 --> 00:45:53,625
But l can't fire de la Rosa.

517
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:56,020
l don't want to hurt anyone.

518
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:59,257
Just find him a job somewhere else.

519
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:00,795
Come in, Ruben.

520
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,197
-You know Father Amaro, don't you?
-Yes.

521
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,844
Well, Mr. Galarza, nice to meet you.

522
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:16,741
But these are all lies.

523
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:19,349
What l wrote was the facts,
not this bullshit!

524
00:46:19,518 --> 00:46:21,452
l'm talking to you, asshole!

525
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:25,886
-Think you can make a fool of me?
-Calm down, Ruben!

526
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,919
-Sit down.
-This is all bullshit.

527
00:46:31,096 --> 00:46:32,654
Sit down.

528
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:35,864
l'm sorry.

529
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:40,896
lt gets worse.

530
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:46,209
They're asking for your head.

531
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,059
lt was around here
but l don't remember.

532
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,529
lt's very difficult.

533
00:47:18,677 --> 00:47:20,406
Go on to the curve.

534
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:46,933
On this side. lt's still good.

535
00:47:47,205 --> 00:47:48,604
Can l help?

536
00:47:50,175 --> 00:47:51,301
Please, Father.

537
00:47:56,615 --> 00:47:57,639
There it is.

538
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,744
Done. Thanks.

539
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,312
-Hello.
-l'm glad you came.

540
00:48:04,322 --> 00:48:06,984
You read what they printed
in the newspapers?

541
00:48:10,395 --> 00:48:12,761
Newspapers don't make it up here.

542
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:14,863
Let's go over there.

543
00:48:16,034 --> 00:48:18,730
-Make sure those are tight, Lucas.
-Okay.

544
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:20,201
Excuse me.

545
00:48:31,016 --> 00:48:32,278
Thank you.

546
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:35,546
Benito looks good.

547
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:37,320
He's photogenic.

548
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,858
With his buddy, Chato Aguilar.

549
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,160
That misunderstanding
has been settled.

550
00:48:45,163 --> 00:48:46,687
Really?

551
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:49,195
You believe that?

552
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:56,140
Then the rest is also
a misunderstanding.

553
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,173
There are no guerrillas here.

554
00:48:58,844 --> 00:49:01,142
But people have to defend
themselves.

555
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,337
Yes, l believe you.

556
00:49:04,783 --> 00:49:06,944
But l'm not speaking for myself.

557
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:09,617
l'm speaking for the bishop.

558
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:12,750
What's this?

559
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:21,595
''A decision....''

560
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:27,000
Can you imagine me
in a convent full of nuns?

561
00:49:28,039 --> 00:49:29,939
l'd drink all the eggnog.

562
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:33,874
lt's an order from your bishop.

563
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:36,170
l don't give a shit.

564
00:49:37,082 --> 00:49:40,108
You are bound to obedience, Natalio.

565
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:43,584
My only obedience is to God,
and to my people.

566
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,089
Come up here for a few days.

567
00:49:46,958 --> 00:49:47,947
Come on.

568
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:51,956
So you can see how we follow
the gospel to the letter.

569
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:58,826
You could be suspended.

570
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:01,572
Maybe excommunicated.

571
00:50:04,276 --> 00:50:07,575
No. Tell the bishop l said no.

572
00:50:08,013 --> 00:50:10,743
He can do whatever
the hell he wants.

573
00:50:33,138 --> 00:50:34,901
Saint Paul tells us:

574
00:50:36,107 --> 00:50:40,339
''When Jesus rises up in heaven
with his powerful angels...

575
00:50:40,612 --> 00:50:42,102
...in a tongue of flame...

576
00:50:43,715 --> 00:50:46,479
...and takes vengeance on those
who know not God...

577
00:50:47,052 --> 00:50:50,818
...and do not obey the gospel
of our Lord Jesus...

578
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,585
...they will suffer eternal pain
and ruin...

579
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:57,885
...far from the presence of the Lord...

580
00:50:58,063 --> 00:51:01,590
-...and the glory of his power.''
-He's right.

581
00:51:01,833 --> 00:51:03,198
Dear brothers...

582
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:07,638
...slander and defamation...

583
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:10,568
...have fallen like a deluge...

584
00:51:10,742 --> 00:51:13,074
...the confused mind
of a brother of ours.

585
00:51:13,378 --> 00:51:17,678
Our neighbor has chosen to smear
the good and noble actions...

586
00:51:17,916 --> 00:51:20,942
-...begun by Father Benito.
-Bastards.

587
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:22,686
All the worst for him.

588
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:27,319
Because our Lord will judge him
when his time comes.

589
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:30,517
Let us be understanding.

590
00:51:31,162 --> 00:51:33,027
Because the Lord tells us:

591
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:36,029
Do not allow this evil to conquer you.

592
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:39,334
On the contrary, conquer evil
with goodness.

593
00:51:39,604 --> 00:51:41,538
Goodness?

594
00:51:41,806 --> 00:51:46,004
-What? What?
-Today we can be thankful to God...

595
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:50,312
...because the slander
did not trouble our consciences.

596
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,645
ln the face of slander, shines truth.

597
00:51:54,386 --> 00:51:57,116
ln the face of hatred, shines love.

598
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:02,287
-Amid blasphemy, shines forgiveness.
-Forgiveness?

599
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,054
We mustn't forgive.
We can't allow that.

600
00:52:05,296 --> 00:52:07,730
-Long live Father Benito!
-Silence!

601
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:11,129
-Heretics! You're a bunch of heretics!
-Be quiet!

602
00:52:11,302 --> 00:52:13,429
-You be quiet!
-Dionisia!

603
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:53,900
What racket.

604
00:53:06,357 --> 00:53:08,086
Calm down. Calm down!

605
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:09,419
Heretics!

606
00:53:09,694 --> 00:53:10,956
Don't be crazy!

607
00:53:11,162 --> 00:53:14,029
Heretics! Heretics!

608
00:53:16,434 --> 00:53:18,902
-Heretics!
-Long live Christ the King!

609
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,544
-l have stuffed crab.
-l want my chalupas, like always.

610
00:53:29,714 --> 00:53:32,182
Oh, Don Matias,
l'll get them in a moment.

611
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,783
-Good evening.
-Come in.

612
00:53:33,952 --> 00:53:36,785
-Where is Father Benito?
-He doesn't feel well.

613
00:53:36,988 --> 00:53:39,752
-What?
-lt's nothing serious.

614
00:53:40,325 --> 00:53:42,316
No, l still have to go see him.

615
00:53:42,494 --> 00:53:45,292
Tell Amelia to take charge.
Excuse me.

616
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:48,592
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Father.

617
00:53:50,201 --> 00:53:52,169
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

618
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:55,633
How are you, Father?

619
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:59,572
l so wanted to see you.

620
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:02,870
Very upset and hurt
by all that's happened.

621
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,444
The people went too far.

622
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:11,922
Don Paco deserved it.
He started the whole thing.

623
00:54:12,157 --> 00:54:14,022
Don't say that, Amelia.

624
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,989
Luckily it wasn't serious.

625
00:54:30,108 --> 00:54:31,666
How is Ruben?

626
00:54:39,017 --> 00:54:40,177
l don't know.

627
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:43,576
And l don't care.

628
00:54:56,768 --> 00:55:00,226
My chalupas, Amelia.
What's the problem?

629
00:55:01,873 --> 00:55:05,070
Nothing serious.
This time it's not the heart.

630
00:55:05,243 --> 00:55:08,701
He's severely depressed,
but he'll come out of it soon.

631
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,542
With two days rest and spirit.

632
00:55:11,716 --> 00:55:13,775
Keep up your spirits, Father.

633
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:16,946
-See you later.
-Thank you, doctor.

634
00:55:17,121 --> 00:55:20,147
l'll stop by your office
to pay you later.

635
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,523
You see?

636
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,160
When will you learn?

637
00:55:27,265 --> 00:55:30,666
lt's the price l must pay for my sin.

638
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:32,832
What sin?

639
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,838
Ours.

640
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:37,004
Now wait just a minute.

641
00:55:37,175 --> 00:55:39,268
When Cipriano left me...

642
00:55:39,644 --> 00:55:42,477
...who was the only one
who helped me? Remember?

643
00:55:42,647 --> 00:55:43,773
You.

644
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:47,245
l brought you to wallow in my bed.

645
00:55:47,418 --> 00:55:49,750
You gave me back my life.

646
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:53,486
l made you into the priest's whore.

647
00:55:54,158 --> 00:55:58,151
And for that love, l shall go to hell.

648
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,092
Listen to me. What was it
you told me about hell?

649
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:04,765
You don't remember, do you?

650
00:56:06,604 --> 00:56:10,870
The only hell is loneliness.

651
00:56:11,643 --> 00:56:14,544
Did l say that?

652
00:56:14,812 --> 00:56:16,575
That's what you told me.

653
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:22,443
l hope God sees it that way,
Agustina.

654
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:26,521
There, there, stop thinking.

655
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:29,320
You need to rest.

656
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,021
Why don't you close your eyes?

657
00:56:33,331 --> 00:56:36,164
Maybe you can sleep for a little while.

658
00:56:59,357 --> 00:57:02,952
lf not for Doc, l wouldn't have known.
That's what telephones are for.

659
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:04,890
Why should l have told you?

660
00:57:05,063 --> 00:57:08,396
l didn't want you to come in
this time of fanatical crusaders.

661
00:57:08,566 --> 00:57:10,659
Just like living under Franco!

662
00:57:12,136 --> 00:57:14,036
Well, l'm coming to get you.

663
00:57:14,205 --> 00:57:16,730
-To take you to the city.
-Are you crazy?

664
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:21,142
-You'll get better treatment.
-l'm not moving from here at all.

665
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,775
Oh, Dad.

666
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:27,214
What's the matter?

667
00:57:29,887 --> 00:57:31,320
You haven't gotten a job?

668
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:37,352
Oh, God. Come on, don't act
like a victim, son. Lift your head up.

669
00:57:39,464 --> 00:57:42,297
Lift your head up.

670
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:44,796
Smile.

671
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:47,465
That's it.

672
00:57:47,638 --> 00:57:53,099
What you have to do is get a job
at a newspaper with big circulation.

673
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:56,370
Because l have some news
about the priests....

674
00:57:56,547 --> 00:57:58,276
You're going to fall over!

675
00:57:58,449 --> 00:58:01,816
Remember Father Natalio,
the guerrilla?

676
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:03,579
Yes.

677
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:07,088
Well he confronted the bishop.
And what do you think?

678
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:11,092
-Now they want to excommunicate him.
-Wow!

679
00:58:13,331 --> 00:58:16,198
-Cheers to Father Natalio!
-Cheers.

680
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:26,966
Amelia!

681
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,871
Let go of me!

682
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,484
-Let's talk.
-l don't want anything with you!

683
00:58:34,652 --> 00:58:35,778
-Get lost!
-Wait.

684
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,386
Don't you get it? l loathe you!

685
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,023
That's not true.

686
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:51,162
-Do you feel better, Father?
-Better, better.

687
00:58:51,335 --> 00:58:53,599
l'm not numb anymore.

688
00:58:55,406 --> 00:58:58,068
Defend yourself, you son of a bitch!

689
00:58:59,977 --> 00:59:01,467
Come on, faggot!

690
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:04,405
-Come on, asshole!
-My goodness!

691
00:59:04,615 --> 00:59:09,018
Fucking priest, don't you have any balls?
Just you and me! Shithead priest!

692
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:10,950
Come on, asshole!

693
00:59:11,222 --> 00:59:12,780
Son of a bitch!

694
00:59:15,259 --> 00:59:16,624
You fucked up, Rubencito.

695
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:19,623
We're putting you away for three weeks,
or more.

696
00:59:23,034 --> 00:59:25,195
No, it's okay. l'm fine with this.

697
00:59:25,369 --> 00:59:26,700
Thank you.

698
00:59:28,673 --> 00:59:31,801
Ready to make your statement, Father?

699
00:59:35,313 --> 00:59:38,009
No, l'm not going to press charges.

700
00:59:40,885 --> 00:59:42,614
l forgive you, Ruben.

701
01:00:19,524 --> 01:00:21,048
Are you crying?

702
01:00:26,063 --> 01:00:27,428
Over Ruben?

703
01:00:28,366 --> 01:00:30,459
No, over you.

704
01:00:33,638 --> 01:00:36,607
Over all you have suffered
without complaining.

705
01:02:50,441 --> 01:02:53,069
ln the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost....

706
01:02:53,244 --> 01:02:55,041
-Go in peace.
-Amen.

707
01:02:57,748 --> 01:03:00,546
-Mary, Mother of God.
-Conceived without sin.

708
01:03:01,085 --> 01:03:02,484
-l absolve--
-Father!

709
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,713
-What?
-What do you mean, ''what''?

710
01:03:11,762 --> 01:03:15,289
-Tell me your sins.
-You know them.

711
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:17,229
What about yours?

712
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:24,273
-Forgive me, l was out of line.
-What do you think about love?

713
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,748
Love is the motor of the world,
Amelia.

714
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:36,919
Love believes everything...

715
01:03:37,822 --> 01:03:39,312
...expects everything...

716
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:42,050
...bears everything.

717
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:45,456
-Saint Paul says in Corinthians--
-Stop playing dumb!

718
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:48,598
About our love.
What do you think about that?

719
01:03:56,574 --> 01:03:58,303
lt is a gift.

720
01:04:05,983 --> 01:04:08,713
God blesses us through this love.

721
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:20,296
We have to be careful.

722
01:04:26,103 --> 01:04:28,401
People wouldn't understand.

723
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:34,067
Go on, now. Go.

724
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:02,596
Martin.

725
01:05:05,876 --> 01:05:10,404
Were you planning on going out, Father?
The distributor isn't working.

726
01:05:10,581 --> 01:05:13,812
No, no, l was just taking a walk
around here.

727
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:21,648
Father Benito should buy another truck,
don't you think?

728
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:24,385
El Gato is selling one.

729
01:05:25,429 --> 01:05:27,056
How is Getsemani doing?

730
01:05:28,265 --> 01:05:29,664
Getsemani?

731
01:05:31,335 --> 01:05:34,498
-Have you taken her to the doctor?
-Yes.

732
01:05:35,239 --> 01:05:37,400
He gave her some medicine.

733
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,637
Do you want to come in?

734
01:05:40,845 --> 01:05:42,813
l'd like that.

735
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:58,127
Hello.

736
01:06:10,274 --> 01:06:13,107
What about that room?
Are you using it?

737
01:06:19,483 --> 01:06:22,043
My son Lencho would stay here...

738
01:06:22,419 --> 01:06:24,819
...when he'd come to Los Reyes.

739
01:06:25,723 --> 01:06:28,248
Martin, l want to ask you a favor.

740
01:06:29,393 --> 01:06:32,521
-Do you know Amelia?
-Sanjuanera's daughter.

741
01:06:32,696 --> 01:06:34,891
Yes, a very pious child.

742
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:38,563
She wants to become a nun.

743
01:06:40,604 --> 01:06:42,663
She doesn't want anyone to know.

744
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,874
And l offered to prepare her,
and, well, in secret...

745
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:49,404
...but l don't have a place.

746
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,239
lt could be here.

747
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:58,248
-Already?
-Yes.

748
01:06:59,356 --> 01:07:01,324
You look happy, child.

749
01:07:02,126 --> 01:07:04,856
l'm so glad you finally decided...

750
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:08,190
...to tell that Ruben to bug off.

751
01:07:09,733 --> 01:07:11,064
lt was about time.

752
01:07:14,605 --> 01:07:17,506
The cheese, child. Here.

753
01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:21,974
-Excuse me.
-Thank you, sweetie.

754
01:07:22,146 --> 01:07:23,841
-You're welcome.
-Delicious.

755
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:25,504
-Cheese?
-Yes, thank you.

756
01:07:25,683 --> 01:07:27,378
Pardon my hand.

757
01:07:30,054 --> 01:07:32,614
-Cheese?
-No, no thank you.

758
01:07:34,058 --> 01:07:36,618
-You need anything?
-Nothing, thank you.

759
01:07:36,794 --> 01:07:39,763
-What a lovely girl.
-Very pious, intelligent...

760
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,693
...and church-going.

761
01:07:41,899 --> 01:07:43,389
Did l tell you, Father?

762
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:48,468
Amelia is going to give Getsemani
catechism classes. Aren't you, Amelia?

763
01:07:48,872 --> 01:07:51,170
What poppycock!

764
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:54,276
-Who is Getsemani?
-A retarded child.

765
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:58,040
She doesn't understand a thing.
The poor wretch can't even talk.

766
01:07:58,215 --> 01:07:59,910
All the more merit.

767
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:02,746
You're wasting your time, child.

768
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:06,287
-You won't last a week.
-The feeble-minded need God too.

769
01:08:07,558 --> 01:08:09,788
Don't they, Father Galvan?

770
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,123
Yes, yes, of course.
We all need God.

771
01:08:13,964 --> 01:08:16,762
-Want some more horchata?
-Yes, thank you.

772
01:08:23,507 --> 01:08:25,031
l found a place.

773
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:57,231
Look.

774
01:08:57,608 --> 01:08:59,542
This one is the Holy Spirit.

775
01:08:59,943 --> 01:09:01,843
See his little wings?

776
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:04,805
This is the Virgin Mary.

777
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,744
And this one is Jesus...

778
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,383
...the baby.

779
01:09:11,889 --> 01:09:15,256
Look, this man with a beard....

780
01:09:15,959 --> 01:09:18,359
Look at him, he's God.

781
01:09:20,998 --> 01:09:25,628
Look closely at the drawings and
l'll be back to tell you the story. Okay?

782
01:09:25,936 --> 01:09:27,335
Look at them.

783
01:10:11,982 --> 01:10:14,143
As the lily among thorns

784
01:10:15,219 --> 01:10:17,687
So is my beloved among maidens

785
01:10:20,657 --> 01:10:21,919
Thy hair

786
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,629
Is as a flock of goats that appear
From Mount Gilead

787
01:10:28,866 --> 01:10:31,699
Thy lips are like a ribbon of scarlet

788
01:10:35,873 --> 01:10:38,501
That's from the Song of Songs.

789
01:10:42,513 --> 01:10:44,708
lt's a holy book.

790
01:11:16,914 --> 01:11:20,008
Thy two breasts are like two young roes
That are twins

791
01:11:20,184 --> 01:11:22,277
Which feed among the lilies

792
01:11:23,187 --> 01:11:26,554
The joints of thy thighs are like jewels

793
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:28,981
Thy navel

794
01:11:30,127 --> 01:11:33,494
Is like a round goblet
Which wanteth not liquor

795
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,897
Thy belly is like a heap of wheat
Set about with lilies

796
01:11:41,205 --> 01:11:43,639
A fountain of gardens

797
01:11:44,608 --> 01:11:46,838
A well of living waters

798
01:11:47,778 --> 01:11:50,508
And streams from Lebanon

799
01:11:52,482 --> 01:11:55,610
Thy lips, o my spouse
Drop as the honeycomb

800
01:11:57,921 --> 01:12:01,618
Honey and milk are under thy tongue

801
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:08,230
And the smell of thy garments
Is like the smell of Lebanon

802
01:12:52,376 --> 01:12:58,508
The commandments of the law
of God are 1 0.

803
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:04,987
The first: Thou shall love God
above all things.

804
01:13:05,188 --> 01:13:11,457
The second: Thou shall not take
the name of the Lord in vain.

805
01:13:11,628 --> 01:13:16,190
The third: Thou shall observe
the holy days.

806
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:21,770
The fourth: Thou shall honor
thy father and thy mother.

807
01:13:21,972 --> 01:13:25,464
The fifth: Thou shall not kill.

808
01:13:25,642 --> 01:13:29,408
The sixth: Thou shall not fornicate.

809
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:30,840
-The seventh--
-Miss!

810
01:13:31,515 --> 01:13:34,109
What does thou shall not ''formicate''
mean?

811
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:40,423
lt means that you don't eat meat
during holy week, Chente.

812
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,021
-The seventh.
-The seventh....

813
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:46,355
Leaving, Father?

814
01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:50,398
-l have to visit someone who is sick.
-l came for confession.

815
01:13:50,567 --> 01:13:54,765
l brought you a present.
l made it for the altar to the Virgin.

816
01:13:55,005 --> 01:13:57,803
lt's lovely. l'll take it.
Thank you, Amparito.

817
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:01,433
-Thank you.
-Come visit me at my house some time.

818
01:14:05,549 --> 01:14:07,449
Good afternoon, Father.

819
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:37,112
-Wait a minute.
-What?

820
01:14:45,222 --> 01:14:47,622
-No.
-What?

821
01:14:48,825 --> 01:14:50,588
Let me see it on you.

822
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:52,628
Yes?

823
01:15:11,014 --> 01:15:13,073
You are more beautiful
than the Virgin.

824
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,330
l don't want any more scandals.

825
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:37,002
Just imagine if the newspapers
do another number on us.

826
01:15:37,207 --> 01:15:41,644
Be patient with him, Bishop.
Father Natalio is acting in good faith.

827
01:15:42,979 --> 01:15:46,176
l've given him more than enough
time to come around.

828
01:15:46,450 --> 01:15:49,613
-May l express an opinion?
-Of course, son.

829
01:15:49,786 --> 01:15:52,778
That's why l call you, to advise me.

830
01:15:53,623 --> 01:15:56,592
lf you send him to some other
peasant community...

831
01:15:56,827 --> 01:15:59,728
...in another diocese,
l think he would accept.

832
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,621
You're too good.

833
01:16:02,999 --> 01:16:06,332
Well, give me time for God
to enlighten me.

834
01:16:11,174 --> 01:16:14,371
Did you tell the Bishop
about the child Amelia?

835
01:16:14,544 --> 01:16:15,943
What?

836
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:21,339
-That you are preparing her, as a nun.
-Oh, yes.

837
01:16:23,353 --> 01:16:27,255
We talked a long time in confidence.

838
01:16:27,424 --> 01:16:31,121
l think the Bishop would like
the Order of the Clares for her.

839
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:35,087
How is she doing?

840
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:36,793
Who?

841
01:16:38,635 --> 01:16:40,432
The child Amelia.

842
01:16:41,004 --> 01:16:43,700
With her studies, l mean.

843
01:16:44,741 --> 01:16:48,438
Fine. She seems to have a vocation.

844
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:07,961
l want to love you without hiding.
ln front of everyone.

845
01:17:08,532 --> 01:17:10,830
No, it can't be done.

846
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,094
Our love is unique.

847
01:17:15,105 --> 01:17:16,470
What?

848
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:18,540
lt's spiritual, right?

849
01:17:20,343 --> 01:17:23,710
No. lt's carnal.

850
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:28,246
l know, the flesh and the spirit are
one and the same essence.

851
01:17:30,153 --> 01:17:31,916
But it isn't true.

852
01:17:35,125 --> 01:17:38,356
Lots of priests hang up
their cassocks and marry.

853
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:40,789
Well, l won't.

854
01:17:41,398 --> 01:17:42,763
Why not?

855
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,628
-We could go far away.
-Where?

856
01:17:46,903 --> 01:17:49,599
-Anywhere.
-For what?

857
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,641
So l could end up teaching civics?

858
01:17:54,477 --> 01:17:56,445
What about all my studies?

859
01:18:00,317 --> 01:18:02,376
That's not the important thing.

860
01:18:02,652 --> 01:18:05,143
No, the important thing is my vocation.

861
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:13,357
Besides, l can do so much for people
as a priest.

862
01:18:41,191 --> 01:18:42,590
Martin.

863
01:18:47,864 --> 01:18:51,061
Do you know the Clare nuns, Father?

864
01:18:51,568 --> 01:18:56,596
l think they have a convent
in Santa Marta. Why?

865
01:18:57,841 --> 01:19:01,777
Because little Amelia wants
to become a nun with them.

866
01:19:02,345 --> 01:19:04,404
Amelia, a nun?

867
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:09,546
That's what Father Amaro said.

868
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:13,280
He has been preparing her
for a long time.

869
01:19:14,457 --> 01:19:17,392
For a long time? Where?

870
01:19:18,495 --> 01:19:21,692
ln a little room, out by the workshop.

871
01:19:22,599 --> 01:19:24,658
He says it's a secret.

872
01:19:35,545 --> 01:19:37,012
Where is he?

873
01:19:55,398 --> 01:19:58,026
She's just a child. Didn't you notice?

874
01:19:59,135 --> 01:20:01,069
We both know what we are doing.

875
01:20:01,237 --> 01:20:03,330
-You are a priest.
-l'm also a man.

876
01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:07,368
-You took a vow of chastity.
-Because l was forced to.

877
01:20:12,115 --> 01:20:14,982
l'm going to have to inform the bishop.

878
01:20:17,921 --> 01:20:21,357
-No, you won't say anything, Father.
-Just wait and see.

879
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:24,683
Then l will tell him what l know
about Sanjuanera.

880
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:27,091
lt's not the same thing, damn it!

881
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:29,423
Sanjuanera is different.

882
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:32,534
-That poor woman--
-lt's the same, Father.

883
01:20:34,804 --> 01:20:36,795
Are you blackmailing me?

884
01:20:57,627 --> 01:20:58,889
The host is sacred!

885
01:20:59,329 --> 01:21:01,854
You'll be damned, you little brats!

886
01:21:02,665 --> 01:21:06,863
Blessed and praised be the host
consecrated unto God....

887
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:08,936
Guess who called my boyfriend?

888
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:10,629
-Who?
-Ruben.

889
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:14,203
He said he's working at another
newspaper in Mexico City.

890
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:17,141
-What's that to me?
-You still hate him?

891
01:21:18,948 --> 01:21:19,937
l do.

892
01:21:20,116 --> 01:21:21,606
-Why so much--?
-Amelia!

893
01:21:21,785 --> 01:21:22,979
l'll see you.

894
01:21:23,153 --> 01:21:24,950
l need to talk to you.

895
01:21:30,026 --> 01:21:33,189
-We have to find another place.
-l'm pregnant.

896
01:21:40,737 --> 01:21:41,829
Are you sure?

897
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:47,339
ls that all you can say to me?

898
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:17,296
May l talk to you, Father?

899
01:22:21,544 --> 01:22:23,409
To confess?

900
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:28,215
No, l just want to talk.

901
01:22:30,553 --> 01:22:33,386
You're in big trouble, boy.

902
01:22:38,261 --> 01:22:40,456
l do want to confess.

903
01:22:50,807 --> 01:22:53,367
Father, l have sinned.

904
01:22:55,812 --> 01:22:57,973
Hail Mary, full of grace.

905
01:22:59,282 --> 01:23:00,544
l have lied.

906
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:04,449
l have committed the sin of pride.

907
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:09,485
l abused the trust of people
who opened their house to me.

908
01:23:10,593 --> 01:23:15,553
Like Herod, l chopped off
innocent heads.

909
01:23:17,967 --> 01:23:19,559
l have offended God.

910
01:23:21,371 --> 01:23:23,896
l have committed the sin of lust.

911
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:28,366
l fornicated with a virgin
who was a child!

912
01:23:34,617 --> 01:23:38,348
-He must go to Mexico City immediately.
-l'll go with him.

913
01:23:38,955 --> 01:23:41,617
How are we going to get him
to Mexico City now?

914
01:23:41,824 --> 01:23:44,418
lt is quite a severe coronary.

915
01:23:44,594 --> 01:23:47,028
But how can we take him by plane?

916
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,857
By anything, but hurry.

917
01:23:49,032 --> 01:23:50,795
-From where?
-Figure out where.

918
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:54,596
Hello? Put me through
to Don Chato, please.

919
01:23:54,804 --> 01:23:56,635
-Mr. Chato Aguilar.
-You can't call him.

920
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:58,239
-Father Benito.
-No!

921
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,535
We're talking about his life!

922
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:28,565
Be careful, son. He's very fragile.

923
01:24:29,005 --> 01:24:30,973
lt looks bad, really.

924
01:24:39,515 --> 01:24:43,315
We'll get in touch later.

925
01:25:04,907 --> 01:25:08,741
l'm giving you just enough time
to find another job.

926
01:25:09,078 --> 01:25:11,444
l didn't want to hurt you, Father.

927
01:25:11,681 --> 01:25:16,311
By the time Father Benito gets back
there will be another sexton here, okay?

928
01:25:43,046 --> 01:25:45,480
You haven't been to the restaurant.

929
01:25:47,717 --> 01:25:49,378
Nor you to mass.

930
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:53,150
We have to talk about my pregnancy.

931
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:57,821
-Have you told your mother?
-No one.

932
01:25:57,994 --> 01:26:00,519
l don't know what to do.
l can't think.

933
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,625
You could go to Villa Aldama.

934
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:11,473
Stay there nine months and
put the baby up for adoption.

935
01:26:18,581 --> 01:26:20,446
ls that what you want?

936
01:26:22,018 --> 01:26:26,284
-For me to give my baby away?
-Listen to me, Amelia.

937
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,714
l'm a priest.

938
01:26:30,793 --> 01:26:33,353
l can't jeopardize my priesthood.

939
01:26:34,797 --> 01:26:37,527
Besides, you knew that from
the beginning.

940
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:42,535
No!

941
01:26:43,072 --> 01:26:46,803
l'll have my baby here!
l don't care if everyone knows it's yours!

942
01:26:46,976 --> 01:26:49,137
-Don't say stupid things.
-lt is yours!

943
01:26:49,312 --> 01:26:52,679
Shut up, you dumb bitch!
Shut up! Shut up!

944
01:26:57,687 --> 01:26:59,382
Forgive me.

945
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:03,587
Forgive me.

946
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:11,127
Forgive me.

947
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:52,173
Ruben is here.

948
01:27:53,209 --> 01:27:54,801
Ruben your boyfriend?

949
01:28:00,082 --> 01:28:03,882
He's working in Mexico City.
He came to see his father.

950
01:28:04,854 --> 01:28:06,446
Have you seen him?

951
01:28:13,896 --> 01:28:16,592
Maybe he'll want to marry me.

952
01:28:30,413 --> 01:28:31,812
Would you like that?

953
01:28:46,362 --> 01:28:49,422
To save my baby, l would do anything.

954
01:29:12,154 --> 01:29:13,314
Hello.

955
01:29:14,223 --> 01:29:15,451
Hello.

956
01:29:17,493 --> 01:29:19,620
What are you doing here?

957
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:22,463
Can l talk to you?

958
01:29:28,204 --> 01:29:30,468
Could you forget it all?

959
01:29:32,675 --> 01:29:34,370
l've forgotten it.

960
01:29:44,787 --> 01:29:47,312
You wanted to marry me, remember?

961
01:29:48,024 --> 01:29:49,013
Yes.

962
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,251
l would have done anything for you.

963
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:56,197
Not anymore?

964
01:30:00,636 --> 01:30:02,467
Take me to Mexico City with you.

965
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:13,712
You don't love me anymore, do you?

966
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:17,082
No, not anymore.

967
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:20,221
My love ended.

968
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:26,094
-Forgive me for blurting it out like this.
-That's okay.

969
01:30:35,905 --> 01:30:38,738
Of course l'm worried
about his condition.

970
01:30:38,908 --> 01:30:42,139
But alas, only God knows, son.

971
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:45,838
Father Benito has fulfilled
his mission on earth.

972
01:30:46,582 --> 01:30:49,608
Let me know when you hear anything.

973
01:30:52,621 --> 01:30:57,581
Meanwhile, you take over his affairs.

974
01:30:57,827 --> 01:31:03,891
You understand, right? We're going to
renew construction on the hospital.

975
01:31:04,066 --> 01:31:05,397
No, no, no.

976
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:10,096
What concerns me most right
now is Father Natalio.

977
01:31:10,272 --> 01:31:15,369
lf he won't accept another diocese,
l can't wait any longer.

978
01:31:17,480 --> 01:31:20,677
lf you can't sort it out, who can?

979
01:31:21,851 --> 01:31:23,478
Excommunication, son.

980
01:31:23,652 --> 01:31:27,418
A decree to be read in all the churches...

981
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,956
...and all over the country.

982
01:31:30,126 --> 01:31:33,425
He won't even be able to get
into the rural schools.

983
01:31:33,896 --> 01:31:37,559
You must deliver it to him personally.

984
01:31:37,733 --> 01:31:41,225
And we'll see.
Either he gives in or he's fucked.

985
01:31:41,404 --> 01:31:42,871
Let me know.

986
01:31:43,672 --> 01:31:44,900
Yes.

987
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:13,358
Did you talk to Ruben?

988
01:32:15,037 --> 01:32:16,436
Yes.

989
01:32:18,374 --> 01:32:20,001
Yes, of course.

990
01:32:25,614 --> 01:32:27,775
l have a suggestion, Amelia.

991
01:32:36,425 --> 01:32:38,450
Do you know where Dionisia lives?

992
01:32:38,627 --> 01:32:39,889
Here?

993
01:32:43,332 --> 01:32:44,424
Good evening.

994
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:47,400
Good evening.

995
01:32:50,005 --> 01:32:51,438
Dionisia?

996
01:32:53,309 --> 01:32:55,334
What a surprise! What an honor!

997
01:32:55,511 --> 01:32:58,207
Come in, Father dear, come in.

998
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,611
Look, this is my private church.

999
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:05,151
Let me introduce you to my saints.

1000
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:09,985
Here is my Saint Anthony, Saint Joseph,
my Virgin of Guadalupe....

1001
01:33:10,259 --> 01:33:12,124
-Sit down, Father.
-l'm in a hurry.

1002
01:33:13,095 --> 01:33:14,494
Yes.

1003
01:33:16,765 --> 01:33:18,562
And how is the little girl?

1004
01:33:22,538 --> 01:33:23,664
Happy.

1005
01:33:24,106 --> 01:33:29,100
Listen, l heard in confession
that you know a doctor....

1006
01:33:29,278 --> 01:33:30,973
A doctor, l don't know....

1007
01:33:35,284 --> 01:33:37,878
One of those who does....

1008
01:33:39,555 --> 01:33:41,853
Does what, Father?

1009
01:33:45,528 --> 01:33:47,155
Brings children into the world.

1010
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:51,925
-And also....
-Mother of God! The girl is pregnant?

1011
01:33:52,301 --> 01:33:53,461
No.

1012
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:00,907
What you want is an abortion, Father.

1013
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:10,483
l don't know if this is enough.

1014
01:34:10,886 --> 01:34:14,879
No, it takes a lot more. But don't worry.

1015
01:34:15,724 --> 01:34:18,284
We'll settle up later.
First let me see.

1016
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,690
-Yes.
-l'll let you know in time.

1017
01:34:22,965 --> 01:34:25,525
God bless you, Father.

1018
01:34:26,635 --> 01:34:28,068
Yes.

1019
01:34:59,401 --> 01:35:00,425
Excuse me.

1020
01:35:16,018 --> 01:35:18,452
-Mother of Jesus.
-Pray for him.

1021
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:21,155
-Mother of divine grace.
-Pray for him.

1022
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:23,221
-Tower of David.
-Pray for him.

1023
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,257
-Tower of ivory.
-Pray for him.

1024
01:35:25,427 --> 01:35:27,554
-House of gold.
-Pray for him.

1025
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:29,254
-Heaven's gate.
-Pray for him.

1026
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:31,591
-Refuge for sinners.
-Pray for him.

1027
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:33,257
-Consolation of the afflicted.
-Pray for him.

1028
01:35:33,502 --> 01:35:35,663
-Aid for Christians.
-Pray for him.

1029
01:35:35,904 --> 01:35:37,895
-Queen of angels.
-Pray for him.

1030
01:35:38,073 --> 01:35:39,836
-Queen of the apostles.
-Pray for him.

1031
01:35:40,009 --> 01:35:42,136
-Queen of the patriarchs.
-Pray for him.

1032
01:35:42,311 --> 01:35:44,211
-Queen of all the saints.
-Pray for him.

1033
01:35:44,380 --> 01:35:46,507
-Queen of the apostles.
-Pray for him.

1034
01:35:46,682 --> 01:35:48,445
-Queen of prophets.
-Pray for him.

1035
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:51,211
They found Lucas in a canyon.

1036
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:55,752
Three years ago they killed
his father and two brothers.

1037
01:35:55,924 --> 01:35:58,085
Chato Aguilar's men.

1038
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:00,894
What about the municipal guards?

1039
01:36:01,063 --> 01:36:03,031
They help them.

1040
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:08,427
But someone should be told.
The authorities.

1041
01:36:09,471 --> 01:36:11,871
lf you only knew of all
we've accomplished.

1042
01:36:12,608 --> 01:36:15,736
Things are settled differently
around here. Don't worry.

1043
01:36:17,746 --> 01:36:19,805
Can l ask you a moral question?

1044
01:36:23,018 --> 01:36:27,182
Well, l don't know a lot about
moral theology, but....

1045
01:36:28,057 --> 01:36:29,456
Ask away.

1046
01:36:33,796 --> 01:36:35,388
What do you think about abortion?

1047
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:41,335
We don't have that problem
around here.

1048
01:36:42,104 --> 01:36:44,402
But in your parish you do, huh?

1049
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:56,212
l don't know. ln some cases,
one would have to consider it.

1050
01:36:58,921 --> 01:37:00,183
Yes.

1051
01:37:12,835 --> 01:37:15,929
And how is the bishop?

1052
01:37:20,275 --> 01:37:23,676
Look, he sent you a fax.

1053
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:29,582
lt's a suspension ad divinis
against you.

1054
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,348
And excommunication too.

1055
01:37:45,367 --> 01:37:47,927
You are out of the church now, Natalio.

1056
01:37:50,506 --> 01:37:54,067
You can't officiate,
or give the sacraments anymore.

1057
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:58,608
You have to go before the bishop.

1058
01:38:00,082 --> 01:38:01,515
No...

1059
01:38:02,584 --> 01:38:04,848
...l'm not going before anyone.

1060
01:38:09,825 --> 01:38:11,486
Out of the church.

1061
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:17,027
lf they want to kick me out,
l'm already here.

1062
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:19,827
l'll stay on as just another peasant.

1063
01:38:20,736 --> 01:38:22,727
l chose this path.

1064
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:25,131
And you?

1065
01:38:35,684 --> 01:38:37,675
Believe me, l admire you, Natalio.

1066
01:38:44,927 --> 01:38:46,622
Well, l have to go.

1067
01:39:31,507 --> 01:39:34,476
Holy Virgin among virgins...

1068
01:39:37,112 --> 01:39:41,674
...don't let me fall,
or lose my way in adversity.

1069
01:39:44,019 --> 01:39:46,010
l have been your faithful son...

1070
01:39:48,457 --> 01:39:50,948
...since l was a child.

1071
01:39:53,428 --> 01:39:56,363
You have protected me along
the path of duty.

1072
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:00,391
Do not forsake me in this crucial hour.

1073
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:03,629
My Mother, grant me a miracle, please.

1074
01:40:05,007 --> 01:40:07,202
Save me, Holy Mother.

1075
01:40:10,512 --> 01:40:12,571
My mother called from Mexico City.

1076
01:40:12,748 --> 01:40:15,649
-What happened?
-They've operated on Father Benito.

1077
01:40:16,318 --> 01:40:18,513
They'll be back in two weeks.

1078
01:40:19,087 --> 01:40:20,520
That's good.

1079
01:40:27,629 --> 01:40:31,998
What you told me over the phone,
l thought about it.

1080
01:40:35,137 --> 01:40:36,468
No.

1081
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:39,607
No. Think about it more.

1082
01:40:40,609 --> 01:40:43,373
You have to do it of your own free will.

1083
01:40:51,386 --> 01:40:53,616
Heaven purify my soul.

1084
01:40:53,789 --> 01:40:58,192
My spirit is filled with emotion when
l contemplate the blessings of my Lord.

1085
01:40:58,694 --> 01:41:00,628
You have shed your light
on your servant....

1086
01:41:00,796 --> 01:41:03,663
Grant me a miracle, Holy Mother.

1087
01:41:03,832 --> 01:41:05,163
Save me.

1088
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:17,438
Friday at 2 in the morning.

1089
01:41:17,879 --> 01:41:20,404
Bring double the amount
that you gave me.

1090
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:48,234
Right on time, Father.

1091
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:50,310
As you should be.

1092
01:41:52,714 --> 01:41:54,579
And the girl?

1093
01:41:55,684 --> 01:41:58,244
Don't tell me she chickened out?

1094
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:03,253
Too bad, Father.

1095
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:05,143
Straight ahead, straight ahead.

1096
01:43:05,821 --> 01:43:08,881
Take the next turnoff to the left.

1097
01:43:44,259 --> 01:43:45,920
lt's all very clean.

1098
01:43:46,228 --> 01:43:48,025
lt's a hospital.

1099
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:53,693
-Wait. l want to talk to the doctor.
-You can't go in.

1100
01:43:53,869 --> 01:43:55,166
l'll take care of it.

1101
01:43:55,337 --> 01:43:57,305
-l have to see the place.
-No.

1102
01:43:57,472 --> 01:43:58,905
The money.

1103
01:44:02,511 --> 01:44:04,809
Come, come, Amelita.

1104
01:44:05,981 --> 01:44:07,846
Everything will be fine.

1105
01:44:10,051 --> 01:44:11,678
Ask God to watch over you.

1106
01:44:20,028 --> 01:44:21,723
Pray for me, okay?

1107
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:26,931
Come, Amelia, come.

1108
01:44:27,202 --> 01:44:28,760
Come, child.

1109
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:36,740
l'll be here, l'll be here.

1110
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,782
Good evening, young man.

1111
01:45:15,183 --> 01:45:18,846
-Good evening.
-Don't you remember me?

1112
01:45:19,721 --> 01:45:22,986
-No.
-We met on a bus.

1113
01:45:24,392 --> 01:45:27,122
When we were held up, remember?

1114
01:45:28,263 --> 01:45:29,423
Oh, yes.

1115
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:33,767
l always remember
how good you were.

1116
01:45:33,935 --> 01:45:37,427
There aren't people like that,
anywhere.

1117
01:45:37,672 --> 01:45:41,403
l couldn't open the store
with my grandson, like l told you.

1118
01:45:41,576 --> 01:45:44,670
l wandered around and around.

1119
01:45:44,846 --> 01:45:49,476
Until l got a job here as a night
watchman and handyman.

1120
01:45:49,651 --> 01:45:53,212
-Here at the hospital?
-That's what they call it.

1121
01:45:54,723 --> 01:45:57,123
You came for them
to relieve your girlfriend?

1122
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:03,655
l came for them to relieve me.

1123
01:46:03,832 --> 01:46:06,300
Don't worry. They all come out okay.

1124
01:46:06,468 --> 01:46:08,299
Screwed, but content.

1125
01:46:10,472 --> 01:46:12,030
God willing.

1126
01:46:12,974 --> 01:46:15,340
A hemorrhage! lt won't stop!

1127
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:16,943
What?

1128
01:46:21,983 --> 01:46:25,419
We're treating her, get out!
You can't take her!

1129
01:46:25,587 --> 01:46:27,748
-Out of my way!
-She'll bleed to death!

1130
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:28,947
Wait!

1131
01:46:29,124 --> 01:46:31,319
She's bleeding to death.

1132
01:46:32,794 --> 01:46:34,489
Go straight.

1133
01:46:34,663 --> 01:46:36,028
-ln Santa Marta...
-Open it.

1134
01:46:36,197 --> 01:46:40,031
-...there is a good hospital.
-Yes, l know, doctor.

1135
01:46:48,677 --> 01:46:52,340
l have to go. l have to go!

1136
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:57,507
Take me, take me!

1137
01:46:59,254 --> 01:47:02,018
Take me!

1138
01:47:02,691 --> 01:47:05,489
Christ, sanctify me!
Body of Christ, save me!

1139
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:08,686
Passion of Christ, comfort me!
Blood of Christ, intoxicate me!

1140
01:47:08,930 --> 01:47:10,989
Good Jesus, hear me!

1141
01:47:20,108 --> 01:47:22,076
l don't want to die.

1142
01:47:23,278 --> 01:47:26,839
You won't die. You won't die.

1143
01:47:33,355 --> 01:47:39,817
Thy two breasts are like two young roes
That are twins....

1144
01:47:49,304 --> 01:47:51,465
Wait, Amelita, wait for me.

1145
01:48:02,017 --> 01:48:03,348
Wait, Amelita.

1146
01:48:19,401 --> 01:48:20,663
Amelita?

1147
01:49:21,096 --> 01:49:24,623
Poor little girl. lmagine that.

1148
01:49:24,833 --> 01:49:25,822
What happened?

1149
01:49:26,468 --> 01:49:30,097
Well, it turns out that Ruben...

1150
01:49:30,271 --> 01:49:33,001
...Don Paco's son, got her pregnant.
lmagine that.

1151
01:49:33,775 --> 01:49:35,106
What a bastard.

1152
01:49:36,511 --> 01:49:40,880
Well, the poor thing was desperate.

1153
01:49:41,049 --> 01:49:44,450
She went to one of those horrid clinics
to get rid of the baby.

1154
01:49:46,287 --> 01:49:49,085
Father Amaro, who is a saint...

1155
01:49:49,257 --> 01:49:52,090
...l don't know how he did it,
went to save her.

1156
01:49:52,327 --> 01:49:53,453
Did he save her?

1157
01:49:54,762 --> 01:49:58,823
He got her out of there and took her
to a hospital in Santa Marta.

1158
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:03,267
But the poor thing had already
bled to death.

1159
01:50:03,505 --> 01:50:04,767
And she died?

1160
01:50:05,173 --> 01:50:08,165
Yes, she died.

1161
01:50:09,177 --> 01:50:10,701
How awful.

1162
01:50:11,513 --> 01:50:17,645
Gordo, you have to close those
clinics down. Today, okay?

1163
01:51:25,086 --> 01:51:28,715
The holy sacrifice of mass
which we celebrate today...

1164
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:32,758
...we offer for the soul
of our dear sister Amelia.

1165
01:51:32,927 --> 01:51:36,363
Lord grant her eternal rest...

1166
01:51:36,698 --> 01:51:40,065
...and may His perpetual light
shine upon her.

1167
01:51:40,235 --> 01:51:42,863
ln the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1168
01:51:43,037 --> 01:51:44,470
Amen.

1169
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:47,631
-The Lord be with you.
-And with your spirit.

1170
01:51:47,809 --> 01:51:51,108
The grace of our Lord Jesus...

1171
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:53,213
...the love of the Father...

1172
01:51:53,381 --> 01:51:56,350
...and the communion of the Holy Ghost
be with you all.

1173
01:51:56,517 --> 01:51:58,508
And with your spirit.

1174
01:52:00,188 --> 01:52:03,055
-l confess...
-l confess...

1175
01:52:03,224 --> 01:52:08,218
...before God almighty and before you,
brothers...

1176
01:52:08,396 --> 01:52:10,455
...that l have sinned greatly...

1177
01:52:10,698 --> 01:52:15,158
...in thought, word, deed
and by omission.

1178
01:52:15,336 --> 01:52:20,273
For my faults, my faults,
my great faults.

1179
01:52:20,441 --> 01:52:23,968
For these l pray to Holy Mary,
always Virgin...

1180
01:52:24,145 --> 01:52:27,205
...and the angels and the saints...

1181
01:52:28,049 --> 01:52:30,517
...and all of you, my brothers...

1182
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:34,449
...who intercede for me
before God our Lord.
