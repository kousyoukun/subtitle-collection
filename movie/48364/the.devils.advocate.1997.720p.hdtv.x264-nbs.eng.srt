1
00:00:51,881 --> 00:00:53,257
Go on, Barbara.

2
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,055
We go back to our homeroom for dismissal.

3
00:00:59,388 --> 00:01:02,224
Unless you have a pass
for sports or something.

4
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,813
Is that what you did
on the day in question?

5
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:11,484
No. Mr. Gettys asked me
to stay after class.

6
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:13,736
What happened next, Barbara?

7
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:16,781
He told me to sit in the chair
beside his desk.

8
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:21,369
If you will, in your own words,
tell us exactly what happened...

9
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:23,287
...in the next few minutes.

10
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:26,499
I told him I was afraid I'd miss my bus.

11
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:30,419
He promised I'd get to the bus on time
if I'd help him do something.

12
00:01:31,295 --> 00:01:35,591
Before I could say anything,
he placed his hand inside my blouse.

13
00:01:36,592 --> 00:01:40,721
I was so frightened. I didn't move.
I thought if I was just quiet it'd be okay.

14
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:44,600
Then his other hand went up
under inside my skirt.

15
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:47,520
Then, with his hand...

16
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:50,481
...he started moving back and forth...

17
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,442
...farther and farther inside my skirt.

18
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:57,071
He said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings...

19
00:01:57,154 --> 00:02:00,199
...that he wanted to see
what kind of feelings I had.

20
00:02:00,282 --> 00:02:03,244
I was trying to think of something to say,
but I couldn't.

21
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,579
I was confused, and he just kept on.

22
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:08,040
I asked him to stop,
but it was like he couldn't hear me.

23
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:10,668
He just kept on with his hand.

24
00:02:11,585 --> 00:02:12,962
Then I screamed.

25
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:16,841
Then he got mad and said
we'd have to try it again sometime.

26
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:18,342
Did he try again?

27
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:20,594
Not with me.

28
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:22,722
But with your friends?

29
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:24,432
Yes.

30
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:28,686
And after you had told them
what he had done to you...

31
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:33,691
...they told you what he had done to them!

32
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:37,153
Isn't that true?

33
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:38,446
Yes.

34
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,284
I have nothing further.

35
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,039
Your witness, Mr. Lomax.

36
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:58,132
Any chance, Your Honor,
for a short recess?

37
00:02:58,215 --> 00:02:59,467
Of course.

38
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,345
This court will be in recess for 15 minutes.

39
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:08,309
- What...
- Not now, Bernice.

40
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:16,317
Lomax, what's wrong?

41
00:03:16,484 --> 00:03:19,320
As your attorney, I'm advising you
to keep the fuck away from me.

42
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,405
Why? What are you talking about?

43
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,159
The wife, the kid, the outrage.
You definitely had me fooled.

44
00:03:25,284 --> 00:03:27,453
Hey, you're my lawyer.

45
00:03:27,787 --> 00:03:29,080
You're here to defend me.

46
00:03:29,163 --> 00:03:30,539
You know what I'm thinking?

47
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:33,084
Why not put you on the stand?
You can jerk off for the judge.

48
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:36,087
- You know she's lying.
- Get the hell away from me.

49
00:03:57,274 --> 00:03:59,110
Well, hell, there you are.

50
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:03,322
Rumor was you were out
wandering in traffic.

51
00:04:03,614 --> 00:04:05,199
Not now, Larry.

52
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:06,909
What's the game plan?

53
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,912
I got a 4:30 deadline. I need a quote.

54
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:11,455
Give me a quote.

55
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:12,581
Fuck off.

56
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:19,046
"Mr. Lomax had no comment
on today's events.

57
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:22,008
"Speculation, however, was widespread...

58
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:26,470
"...that the young lawyer's
unblemished string of victories...

59
00:04:26,804 --> 00:04:28,305
"...would come to an end...

60
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:30,099
"...in this courtroom."

61
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,398
It was a nice run, Kev.

62
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,400
Had to close out someday.

63
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:41,986
Nobody wins them all.

64
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:07,511
Have you had any discipline problems
in math class this year?

65
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:10,097
No.

66
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,182
No?

67
00:05:12,183 --> 00:05:16,020
Hasn't Mr. Gettys had to talk to you
repeatedly about your behavior?

68
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:18,856
Isn't that why he asked you
to stay after class?

69
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:20,107
No!

70
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:25,279
Have other teachers asked you
to stay after class?

71
00:05:25,363 --> 00:05:26,572
Once or twice.

72
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,657
Did they want to talk to you
about your behavior?

73
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,368
Objection. Immaterial.

74
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:32,495
- Goes to motive.
- Overruled.

75
00:05:32,953 --> 00:05:34,872
You may answer the question.

76
00:05:35,206 --> 00:05:37,208
I don't know
what the other teachers wanted.

77
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:39,126
You'd have to talk to them.

78
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:43,839
You ever pass notes in class?

79
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:47,843
Maybe a note that...

80
00:05:47,927 --> 00:05:49,804
...made fun of Mr. Gettys?

81
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,055
No.

82
00:05:51,597 --> 00:05:52,223
No?

83
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:55,893
Never called him
a "disgusting pig monster"?

84
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:59,271
Order.

85
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,565
No.

86
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:04,819
Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
Defense Exhibit A.

87
00:06:04,902 --> 00:06:08,114
Objection. We've had plenty of time
for discovery here.

88
00:06:08,572 --> 00:06:11,409
I'm going to let this in, Mr. Lomax.

89
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:14,995
I'm also going to suggest
that if you have any other exhibits...

90
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:18,290
...you present them in a timely fashion,
or not at all.

91
00:06:20,584 --> 00:06:22,753
I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong.

92
00:06:23,504 --> 00:06:25,923
It's "huge hog beast."

93
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:29,010
This is your handwriting, isn't it?

94
00:06:29,093 --> 00:06:31,345
- Yes, but...
- You wrote this in Gettys' class.

95
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:32,513
It's a joke.

96
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,598
"He's a huge hog beast.

97
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:38,519
"He probably eats
a thousand pancakes for breakfast."

98
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:42,606
You're writing about Mr. Gettys,
aren't you?

99
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,692
It was meant to be a joke.

100
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:50,114
Have you ever had a party
at your house, Barbara...

101
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,824
...when your parents were away?

102
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,617
Objection. Your Honor...

103
00:06:53,743 --> 00:06:55,286
Credibility and bias.

104
00:06:55,369 --> 00:06:56,787
Overruled.

105
00:06:57,204 --> 00:06:58,956
Answer the question.

106
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:01,125
Yes.

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,297
Have you ever heard of a game
called "Special Places"?

108
00:07:08,632 --> 00:07:10,468
You're under oath, Barbara.

109
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:12,553
A man's career...

110
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,221
...his reputation...

111
00:07:14,388 --> 00:07:16,140
...his life is on the line.

112
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,933
This is not a joke.

113
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:20,936
Have you ever played "Special Places"?

114
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,985
Yes.

115
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:30,654
Is this game sexual in nature?

116
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:35,326
Is this game sexual in nature?

117
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:38,579
We only played it once.

118
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:41,582
This special party, Barbara...

119
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:46,170
...this was the first time you told the story
about Mr. Gettys, wasn't it?

120
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:48,297
Yes.

121
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:51,509
I've spoken to other children
who were there that day.

122
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:54,595
Is there anything else
they may have told me about the party?

123
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:58,182
Objection! If he has other witnesses,
let him call them!

124
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:00,142
If I need to call those other children, I will!

125
00:08:00,226 --> 00:08:03,020
I'm going to sustain that, Mr. Lomax.

126
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:05,314
Rephrase your question.

127
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,197
You threatened those children, didn't you?

128
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,740
That's not the way it happened.

129
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:19,203
You told them to lie, to falsely claim
that Mr. Gettys had hurt them.

130
00:08:19,286 --> 00:08:20,913
These things did happen.

131
00:08:20,996 --> 00:08:25,626
If they didn't, you were going
to tell everyone about this special party.

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,378
They happened to me.

133
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:30,339
So you made up a story. A special story.

134
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:32,133
A story about a math teacher...

135
00:08:32,216 --> 00:08:34,844
...who was tough on you,
who kept you after class.

136
00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:37,430
A "huge hog beast" you didn't like!

137
00:08:37,722 --> 00:08:40,057
That's what really happened, isn't it?

138
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:41,183
No.

139
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,186
I didn't want to be the only one.

140
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:48,190
You goddamn lowlife, son of a bitch...

141
00:08:54,155 --> 00:08:55,948
No further questions, Your Honor.

142
00:08:56,032 --> 00:08:58,159
I'm going to adjourn for the day.

143
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:02,663
We'll be back here at 9:00 a.m.
and people will behave themselves...

144
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,373
You made me proud.

145
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:06,709
...or find themselves in contempt.

146
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:14,133
Pack it up, baby. You need a drink.

147
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:25,019
In the event that we all get drunk,
let's front-load the ceremonial bullshit.

148
00:09:25,186 --> 00:09:27,480
To the best trial lawyer in Alachua County.

149
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,023
Damn straight.

150
00:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,942
So, Kev, off the record...

151
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,945
How's it feel to squeeze
a man like Gettys...

152
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,531
...through the door of reasonable doubt?

153
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:41,827
Why don't you quit being a party pooper.
Have yourself a drink.

154
00:09:41,911 --> 00:09:44,538
We're not going to discuss
the damn case anymore.

155
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:45,706
Am I right?

156
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,416
I'll drink to that.

157
00:09:49,251 --> 00:09:51,045
No shop talk.

158
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:56,884
Pour me another.

159
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,511
Lomax, you're wild.

160
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:01,222
I feel one of them nights coming on.

161
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:09,063
"I've seen the Taj Mahal
I've even been to China"

162
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:16,112
I've got to go piss!

163
00:10:18,406 --> 00:10:20,282
I've got to go piss!

164
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:26,247
Hurry!

165
00:10:35,548 --> 00:10:37,091
Hell of a job today.

166
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:39,427
I don't want to disturb your party.

167
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:47,810
"Milton-Chadwick-Waters."

168
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:49,520
Never heard of it.

169
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:51,939
What are you going to do? Sue me?

170
00:10:52,606 --> 00:10:55,443
Actually, we were hoping
to retain your services.

171
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:57,778
We've been following your progress.

172
00:10:58,821 --> 00:11:00,114
From New York?

173
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:02,158
You've never lost a case.

174
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:05,411
I've had some sympathetic juries.

175
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:07,872
That's exactly what we're looking for.

176
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:11,042
We want you to come to New York,
help us pick a jury.

177
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:17,923
I tell you, man...

178
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:20,176
...you're pretty damn good.

179
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,470
Your card is great.

180
00:11:22,636 --> 00:11:24,138
You being black...

181
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,141
Whose idea was that? Paul's?

182
00:11:27,224 --> 00:11:28,809
That's just brilliant.

183
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:31,645
I'm just not drunk enough yet to fall for it.

184
00:11:31,979 --> 00:11:33,564
I'll buy you a drink when I...

185
00:11:33,647 --> 00:11:35,649
You'd have to start next week.

186
00:11:35,816 --> 00:11:39,904
All expenses, first-class travel and lodging,
you and your wife.

187
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:44,533
A lump-sum payment, regardless
of the verdict, in the amount of...

188
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:49,038
Take a look.

189
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:14,063
<i>In the name of Lord Jesus,</i>
<i>we refute you, Satan, and cast you out.</i>

190
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:15,398
Amen.

191
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,983
"Romans 16:19

192
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,570
"Be ever at what is good

193
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:24,573
"Be innocent

194
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:26,742
"Of evil

195
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,830
"And the God of Peace
will soon crush Satan

196
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:34,834
"Yes, God will crush him

"Yes, God will crush him
underneath your feet"

199
00:12:55,604 --> 00:12:58,524
All the way to New York just to pick a jury.

200
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,609
Every dog gets his day.

201
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,531
Why do I feel the hand of Mary Ann
on this adventure?

202
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:10,411
I gotta tell you, Ma,
this routine's getting awful tired.

203
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,371
Working on Sunday.

204
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:15,124
Working? Ma, get over it.

205
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:19,295
Listen to me. I love my wife.

206
00:13:19,712 --> 00:13:21,964
Okay? I love her all the way.

207
00:13:22,798 --> 00:13:24,133
Just like you.

208
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:27,803
Let me tell you about New York.

209
00:13:28,888 --> 00:13:30,806
"Fallen, fallen, is Babylon.

210
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,809
"It has become
a dwelling place of demons."

211
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,478
"Revelation 18."

212
00:13:35,644 --> 00:13:37,772
Wouldn't hurt you to look it over.

213
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,858
- Couldn't forget it if I tried.
- Oh, really?

214
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:44,028
And what happened to Babylon?

215
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:48,908
"Thou mighty city, in one hour
has thy mighty judgment come.

216
00:13:49,075 --> 00:13:52,578
"And the light of a single lamp
shall shine in thee no more."

217
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,207
Wish me luck.

218
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,086
Good luck.

219
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,547
I'll miss you.

220
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:07,927
Jeannie, listen to me now.
I've gone the extra mile with you on this.

221
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,845
I'm trying to work with you.

222
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:14,767
They'll be looking for that payment
and if it's not there, they'll repo the car.

223
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,859
Okay, I gotta go.

224
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:31,617
Look, Jeannie, I gotta make a plane.
Just get yourself on schedule.

225
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,328
Okay. Make the payment.

226
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,544
Let me guess. It's all my idea, right?

227
00:14:42,461 --> 00:14:45,840
We better give her some grandkids soon
so I can get her off my back.

228
00:14:45,923 --> 00:14:47,383
What do you say?

229
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,095
Let her sweat a little.

230
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:25,171
All right, Mr. Clintine, let me ask you this:
Do you think, as a juror...

231
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:28,758
...you'd be able to set aside
any prior opinion you might hold...

232
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:31,218
...about the savings and loan industry?

233
00:15:32,178 --> 00:15:33,679
That was a question, sir.

234
00:15:33,763 --> 00:15:35,806
What? Do I like bankers?

235
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,940
Your Honor, may I have a minute
to confer with my colleagues?

236
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,192
You may.

237
00:15:49,195 --> 00:15:50,446
Dump him.

238
00:15:50,613 --> 00:15:52,948
Let's get rid of Number four, six...

239
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:54,784
I'd say lose Number twelve...

240
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:56,869
...but the prosecutor's gonna fuck up
and do it for us.

241
00:15:56,952 --> 00:15:58,454
Number six?

242
00:16:01,624 --> 00:16:03,834
You're kidding, right?
She's my first choice.

243
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,461
She's my first pass.

244
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:06,879
And four?

245
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,469
With the dreadlocks? That's crazy.

246
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:17,098
- That's a defendant's juror.
- Did you see his shoes?

247
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:22,395
Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
you are the next big thing.

248
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,773
This is New York.
We're not squeezing oranges here.

249
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,069
He polishes those shoes every night.
He makes his own clothes.

250
00:16:30,486 --> 00:16:35,324
He looks like a brother with an attitude,
but I see a man with a gun under his bed.

251
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:38,619
And woe betide the creature
who steps into his garden.

252
00:16:38,995 --> 00:16:40,246
Number six...

253
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:42,248
...your favorite...

254
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:44,125
...she's damaged goods.

255
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,586
She's a Catholic schoolteacher.

256
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:49,922
Believes in human frailty...

257
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:52,341
No. Something's missing from her.

258
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:53,676
She's wrong.

259
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,012
She wants on this jury.

260
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:58,597
Somebody hurt her and she wants revenge.

261
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:03,102
How the hell do you know that?

262
00:17:04,103 --> 00:17:05,354
I don't know.

263
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:10,568
Either you put a stop
to this happy horseshit or I walk.

264
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:12,820
Walk.

265
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:18,826
Here's the deal: if I lose with your jury,
you do the explaining.

266
00:17:19,785 --> 00:17:21,620
Your Honor, may I continue?

267
00:17:21,704 --> 00:17:24,957
We'd like to excuse
Jurors three, four and six.

268
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:20,221
Hi. You're home early for a change.

269
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,976
Your mother called.

270
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,896
She has her "bad feeling."

271
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:35,861
Every now and then, she gets one right.

272
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:39,532
You okay?

273
00:18:42,326 --> 00:18:43,744
Something's up.

274
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:47,331
They deliberated for 38 minutes.

275
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,422
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

276
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,178
What the hell did they expect?
The man is as guilty as can be.

277
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:04,432
Wasn't a jury anywhere gonna let him off.

278
00:19:05,349 --> 00:19:06,434
Yeah.

279
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,687
Except one.

280
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:11,022
What?

281
00:19:16,652 --> 00:19:18,362
Not fucking guilty!

282
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:21,198
Oh, my God! You lying...

283
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:22,700
...sack of shit!

284
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:24,869
Thirty-eight minutes, my jury!

285
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:29,290
Thirty-eight minutes!

286
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:32,126
- You did it!
- My jury! I'm too good!

287
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:38,966
- <i>Glad you could stick around.</i>
- <i>It's your dime.</i>

288
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,176
Sorry to keep you waiting.

289
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,763
Mr. Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
longer than expected.

290
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:45,723
Good morning, Caprice.

291
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:47,892
Good morning, Mr. Heath.

292
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:49,268
Your messages.

293
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:54,565
Not bad, huh?

294
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:57,234
You can play it cool if you want...

295
00:19:57,318 --> 00:20:00,488
...but when I first walked in,
my jaw was on the floor.

296
00:20:03,991 --> 00:20:05,076
This is our home office.

297
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:06,744
We have many
international arrangements...

298
00:20:06,827 --> 00:20:09,455
...so Mr. Milton spends a great deal
of his time in the air.

299
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:11,040
Three o'clock, we got the Greeks.

300
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,042
Am I a good cop or a bad cop?

301
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,877
We may not need a good cop.

302
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,087
I love it.

303
00:20:16,712 --> 00:20:20,841
In addition to our corporate clients
we're representing 25 foreign countries:

304
00:20:20,925 --> 00:20:24,011
The Mideast, the Balkans,
Central America, West Africa...

305
00:20:24,095 --> 00:20:26,681
Interesting work, but travel-intensive.

306
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:23,320
Behind you.

307
00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:26,032
I'm sorry.

308
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:27,908
Please. Kevin Lomax.

309
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:29,577
John Milton.

310
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,037
Nice to meet you.

311
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:37,543
So?

312
00:21:38,502 --> 00:21:40,463
Have we been treating you well?

313
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:41,672
Very well, thank you.

314
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,758
And your wife, she's had a good time?

315
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:47,345
She sure has. It's been great.
The whole thing's been great.

316
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:51,474
That's our secret:

317
00:21:51,766 --> 00:21:53,476
Kill you with kindness.

318
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,480
What's your secret?

319
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,648
I couldn't say.

320
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:01,442
You were a prosecutor.

321
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:05,237
Out of law school.
Five years in the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.

322
00:22:07,323 --> 00:22:09,700
Sixty-four straight convictions.

323
00:22:11,369 --> 00:22:12,578
What a number!

324
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:14,872
I like to be in court.

325
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:16,916
I didn't plea out a lot.

326
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,085
What's that like?

327
00:22:19,168 --> 00:22:22,338
One day you put them away,
the next you set them free.

328
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:25,007
Takes a little getting used to.

329
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:26,717
Pays better, though, doesn't it?

330
00:22:26,801 --> 00:22:28,427
Yes, it does.

331
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:34,475
That math teacher, the Gettys case...
now I hear you were brilliant.

332
00:22:35,226 --> 00:22:37,061
Prosecutor dropped the ball.

333
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:38,229
Really?

334
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:40,731
You think your guy was guilty?

335
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:42,108
I didn't say that.

336
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,484
What'd you say?

337
00:22:44,652 --> 00:22:45,986
How's this:

338
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,448
I began the case with a clear conscience.

339
00:22:56,747 --> 00:22:58,666
I was sure you had a secret.

340
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,462
The men's room.

341
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:06,340
Upstairs men's room
in the Duval County courthouse.

342
00:23:06,424 --> 00:23:09,093
There's a hole in the wall to the next room.

343
00:23:09,176 --> 00:23:12,054
I spent five years listening
to juries deliberate.

344
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,973
- I love it.
- Love it all you want.

345
00:23:14,056 --> 00:23:15,349
Just don't repeat it.

346
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:18,894
I'm not sure the Florida Bar Association
would appreciate it.

347
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:20,938
My lips are sealed.

348
00:23:21,522 --> 00:23:24,567
You don't really want to go back
to Florida, do you?

349
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:30,072
Walk with me.

350
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:52,011
What do you think?

351
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:55,139
Some people can't handle it.

352
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:57,933
It's peaceful.

353
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,270
My sentiments exactly.

354
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:07,735
Fill in the résumé for me.
Tell me, your father, what does he do?

355
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:11,614
I never got to know my father.
He passed away before I was born.

356
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:14,283
My mother raised me. Just the two of us.

357
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:15,701
She never remarried?

358
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:17,953
She wasn't married the first time.

359
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:21,415
That can't be easy in a town
like Gainesville, can it?

360
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:24,418
I don't think it's easy anywhere.

361
00:24:26,796 --> 00:24:27,922
Holy shit!

362
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:31,300
Different when you're looking down,
isn't it?

363
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:33,094
Yes, it is.

364
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:35,346
Oh, my God.

365
00:24:35,805 --> 00:24:37,014
Your mother...

366
00:24:37,264 --> 00:24:38,766
...what's she like?

367
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:42,144
She's a preacher's daughter. She's tough.

368
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:45,815
She's worked in a poultry plant
for as long as I can remember.

369
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,985
She's got a church she really likes,
so she's usually there or they go out...

370
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:52,071
They do a lot of volunteer work.

371
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:55,825
"Behold, I send you out
as sheep amidst the wolves."

372
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:58,828
So they say.

373
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:00,830
It didn't rub off?

374
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,665
The Book? The Church?

375
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,667
No, I'm on parole.

376
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:07,336
Early release for time served.

377
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,467
A lot of potential clients down there.

378
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:15,428
Are we negotiating?

379
00:25:16,387 --> 00:25:17,471
Always.

380
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,183
Can I ask you a question, then?

381
00:25:21,976 --> 00:25:24,520
Why do you need a criminal department?

382
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,441
Our clients break the law like anyone else.

383
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:35,156
I'm just tired of sending their business
across the street.

384
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:38,868
- Are you offering me a job?
- I'm thinking about it.

385
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:43,998
I know you've got talent.
I knew that before you got here.

386
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,877
It's just the other thing I wonder about.

387
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,546
What thing?

388
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:53,799
Pressure.

389
00:25:54,925 --> 00:25:57,053
It changes everything. Pressure.

390
00:25:57,345 --> 00:26:00,389
Some people, you squeeze them,
they focus.

391
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:02,224
Others fold.

392
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:06,729
Can you summon your talent at will?

393
00:26:07,438 --> 00:26:09,398
Can you deliver on a deadline?

394
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,485
Can you sleep at night?

395
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:15,821
When do we talk about money?

396
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:17,031
Money?

397
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:22,870
That's the easy part.

398
00:26:23,871 --> 00:26:25,956
<i>They call this part of Fifth Avenue,</i>
<i>Carnegie Hill.</i>

399
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,876
<i>You've got the park right across the street,</i>
<i>and the reservoir.</i>

400
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,628
<i>Best jogging in New York.</i>

401
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:32,463
<i>Mount Sinai Hospital is up the street.</i>

402
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:34,215
<i>Some excellent schools.</i>

403
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:37,843
Not on the top of Mr. Milton's list
when he bought this building...

404
00:26:37,927 --> 00:26:40,346
...but great neighborhood for children.

405
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:41,764
Great building.

406
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,393
Follow the money all the way to the top.

407
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,896
You've got the managing director,
Eddie Barzoon, on 16.

408
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:51,774
And, of course, Mr. Milton has the tower.

409
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:56,862
- You must be Mary Ann?
- Yes, I am.

410
00:26:56,946 --> 00:26:59,281
Welcome. I'm Jackie Heath.

411
00:27:00,616 --> 00:27:02,201
It's nice of you to come by.

412
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,578
Oh, please. We live across the hall.

413
00:27:04,745 --> 00:27:06,706
- You're kidding.
- Right there.

414
00:27:07,123 --> 00:27:09,166
It's just two apartments per floor?

415
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,170
- You didn't tell them about it?
- It can speak for itself.

416
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:15,631
<i>Voilà!</i>

417
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:23,097
Oh, my God!

418
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:26,767
It's what they call a "Classic Eight."

419
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:29,562
Be careful. I don't have a map.
I don't want you to get lost.

420
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:34,066
We had them paint it white. Let you see it
naked before you pick your palette.

421
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,401
What am I picking?

422
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:36,861
Palette. Your colors.

423
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:37,945
Oh, yes.

424
00:27:40,614 --> 00:27:42,700
I need to warn you about one thing.

425
00:27:42,783 --> 00:27:46,787
There are going to be some
very envious people down at the firm.

426
00:27:46,954 --> 00:27:50,583
There aren't many of these apartments.
They're a partner's perk.

427
00:27:50,666 --> 00:27:52,960
You must've made quite an impression.

428
00:27:53,169 --> 00:27:56,922
Oh, my God, three bedrooms.
You know what that means?

429
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,591
Babies.

430
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,010
It took us six years to get in here.

431
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:06,766
Unbelievable.

432
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:10,353
Thank you very much.

433
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:16,692
Are you really this good?

434
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:19,445
I sure as hell hope so.

435
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,782
They must want you pretty bad.

436
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:25,785
Look, Mar...

437
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:30,039
...I'm only getting behind this
if you're on board.

438
00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:32,041
If you want to go home...

439
00:28:32,708 --> 00:28:34,043
...I'm with you.

440
00:28:34,335 --> 00:28:35,461
Sure.

441
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:38,964
Let's go back to Gainesville,
back to the condo.

442
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:43,511
You keep scrounging for clients and
I'll keep repossessing cars for Akamian.

443
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:47,139
And maybe, just maybe,
if we kill ourselves...

444
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:52,812
...in about five years we can afford a baby
and a weekend shack at Gulf Shores.

445
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:54,980
Are you shitting me?

446
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,987
I love you.

447
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:04,156
I love you, too.

448
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,246
Tadashi Osumi, Media.

449
00:29:10,413 --> 00:29:12,331
Walter Krasna, Maritime Law.

450
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,583
Bashir Toabal, Energy Law.

451
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,419
I run the Islamic subgroup.

452
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:19,338
Joyce Rensaleer, Mergers and Acquisitions.

453
00:29:19,505 --> 00:29:22,550
Eddie Barzoon, Managing Director and...

454
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:24,677
...Real Estate.

455
00:29:24,802 --> 00:29:27,430
Pradeed Resh, Intellectual Properties.

456
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:31,017
Christabella Andrioli,
International Trade and Customs...

457
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,685
...EC and G-7.

458
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,564
There it is, Kevin.

459
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:38,274
The whole team.

460
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:41,527
Welcome to Milton, Chadwick and Waters.

461
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:44,530
So what do you think?
You can change the furniture if you like.

462
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:46,240
I guess it'll do.

463
00:29:46,574 --> 00:29:48,117
Until something better comes along?

464
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,036
Kevin Lomax, Pam Garrety.

465
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:52,204
Nice to meet you.

466
00:29:52,538 --> 00:29:54,665
Pam was at the Brooklyn D.A.'s office
for 14 years...

467
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:57,543
...so she knows her way
around the local scene.

468
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,879
You'll expedite his bar application?

469
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:03,132
It's in the pipeline.
For now, you'll work <i>pro hac vice</i>.

470
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,760
I petitioned Florida
for a letter of good conduct.

471
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,847
And I prepared, at Mr. Milton's request,
an overview of the Moyez case.

472
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:11,265
The Moyez case?

473
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:14,560
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

474
00:30:35,998 --> 00:30:37,375
What do you think?

475
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:40,086
It's a health code case and it's a loser.

476
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,839
So what's the point?

477
00:30:44,548 --> 00:30:47,843
He wants to see if I'll plea-bargain.
It's a test, right?

478
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:50,304
Isn't everything?

479
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:55,101
It's an 18th-century Italian silk damask...

480
00:30:55,184 --> 00:30:59,313
...with an embossed floriated pattern
of undulating acanthus leaves.

481
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,898
Lovely, isn't it?

482
00:31:02,733 --> 00:31:04,860
And this is about what?

483
00:31:05,236 --> 00:31:06,320
The price?

484
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:09,532
It's about $2,000 a panel.

485
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:12,159
We'll take it...

486
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:14,036
...at $1,400.

487
00:31:14,245 --> 00:31:15,955
You made it.

488
00:31:17,832 --> 00:31:20,126
I thought you said it was impossible.

489
00:31:20,209 --> 00:31:22,461
I thought you said it was important.

490
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:32,221
<i>Go get them, man.</i>

491
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:34,640
<i>Tell him, "Cut that shit down!"</i>

492
00:31:34,932 --> 00:31:37,935
<i>I know what they're doing over there!</i>
<i>That's right!</i>

493
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,814
<i>Tell him, "Take all that noise</i>
<i>back to Africa."</i>

494
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:54,618
Good afternoon.
I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.

495
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,925
Look, I'm not sure I'm making myself clear.

496
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:12,970
Moyez, you need him? To speak with him?

497
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,264
Show him your boots.

498
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,436
You're saying he's down here
in the basement?

499
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:22,146
In the dark?

500
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:24,398
Where do you think I'm taking you?

501
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:36,786
I thought I would recognize you...

502
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,164
...but I do not.

503
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:42,875
Mr. Moyez?

504
00:32:45,127 --> 00:32:46,629
We've never met.

505
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:49,799
I'm Kevin Lomax. I'm a lawyer.

506
00:32:50,966 --> 00:32:52,802
I'm here about the animals.

507
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:57,306
We have an investment in blood.

508
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,602
Think of it as spiritual currency.

509
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:05,147
"Spiritual currency."

510
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:10,653
Look, Mr. Moyez,
I'm going to need your help with this.

511
00:33:15,825 --> 00:33:17,827
What is the name of the man...

512
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,662
...who will prosecute us?

513
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:21,747
Merto.

514
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:24,959
Assistant District Attorney Arnold Merto.

515
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:32,341
What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

516
00:33:32,842 --> 00:33:35,761
With this tongue, we create silence.

517
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,513
You can go now.

518
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:39,765
You will have all the help...

519
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:41,434
...I can give you...

520
00:33:42,101 --> 00:33:44,103
...against <i>Monsieur</i> Merto.

521
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,322
It's arbor green. What do you think?

522
00:33:55,448 --> 00:33:57,158
Not with your complexion.

523
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:03,664
New York City health codes.

524
00:34:04,332 --> 00:34:05,416
That's all of it?

525
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:06,709
Not quite.

526
00:34:11,714 --> 00:34:13,007
Thanks.

527
00:34:17,303 --> 00:34:18,763
Caribbean green.

528
00:34:19,555 --> 00:34:21,724
Something cooler, maybe. Cooler.

529
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:23,184
A cooler green.

530
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:28,814
Too institutional.

531
00:34:29,565 --> 00:34:30,691
I love green.

532
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:35,196
I love it but it's one thing to wear it
and another to have it on your walls.

533
00:34:38,366 --> 00:34:41,911
I'm just trying to help. It's your walls.
Do what you want.

534
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,958
Remember, it's only a health-code case.

535
00:35:09,563 --> 00:35:13,693
This is the first time since I was 13,
I don't have a job...

536
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,945
...or two.

537
00:35:16,529 --> 00:35:18,864
I feel like I'm floating around in that place.

538
00:35:18,948 --> 00:35:21,617
You know, just drifting around
or something.

539
00:35:23,577 --> 00:35:25,246
You'll settle in.

540
00:35:25,955 --> 00:35:28,499
We had this little office in the condo...

541
00:35:28,666 --> 00:35:29,792
Thanks.

542
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:33,295
You know, his side and my side. Real nice.

543
00:35:34,422 --> 00:35:37,466
At night, I'd go to sleep,
I'd see that light on...

544
00:35:40,428 --> 00:35:42,221
If I want to see Leamon...

545
00:35:42,763 --> 00:35:44,473
...I make an appointment.

546
00:35:49,937 --> 00:35:51,564
You're kidding, right?

547
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:58,321
God, how do you handle it?

548
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,781
Take a look around, honey.

549
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,576
Look, you've got three choices.

550
00:36:03,743 --> 00:36:05,411
The Holy Trinity:

551
00:36:06,412 --> 00:36:07,747
You can work...

552
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:10,458
...you can play...

553
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:13,210
...or you can breed.

554
00:36:14,503 --> 00:36:16,589
That's a veal roast, Your Honor.

555
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,258
USDA approved and stamped.

556
00:36:20,009 --> 00:36:22,595
Men kill animals and eat their flesh.

557
00:36:23,304 --> 00:36:25,264
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

558
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:27,850
He killed a goat.

559
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:30,853
And he did it at home...

560
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:34,690
...in a manner consistent
with his religious beliefs.

561
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:38,027
Now, Mr. Merto may find that bizarre.

562
00:36:39,487 --> 00:36:42,448
It's certainly not a religious practice
performed by everyone.

563
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:45,201
It's not as common as, say...

564
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:46,744
...circumcision.

565
00:36:47,328 --> 00:36:49,455
It's not as common as the belief that...

566
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:52,083
...wine transforms into blood.

567
00:36:52,958 --> 00:36:56,462
Some people handle poisonous snakes
to prove their faith.

568
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:59,131
Some people walk on fire.

569
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,634
Phillipe Moyez killed a goat.

570
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:03,052
And he did it...

571
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:07,223
...while observing
his constitutionally protected...

572
00:37:07,807 --> 00:37:09,392
...religious beliefs.

573
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:14,188
Your Honor, this case
is not about keeping goats...

574
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:17,233
...or transporting goats or goat licensing.

575
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:22,113
The city was less concerned
with the care of the animals...

576
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:24,573
...than the manner in which
they were slaughtered.

577
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:26,158
Objection!

578
00:37:26,242 --> 00:37:28,160
Enough, enough. I got it.

579
00:37:29,036 --> 00:37:30,454
Let's wrap it up.

580
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,164
Your Honor...

581
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:36,043
...the city timed this police action
to catch my client...

582
00:37:36,127 --> 00:37:40,256
...exercising his constitutionally protected
right to religious freedom.

583
00:37:40,673 --> 00:37:43,217
This is a law protecting kosher butchering.

584
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,844
Exactly, Your Honor.

585
00:37:45,094 --> 00:37:48,389
I'd like to move at this time
for a verdict of dismissal.

586
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:51,892
I happen to know a little bit
about kashrut law, Mr. Lomax.

587
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,145
I'm aware of that, Your Honor.

588
00:37:54,228 --> 00:37:57,356
That's why I feel confident
in requesting a dismissal.

589
00:37:59,025 --> 00:38:00,151
Mr. Merto?

590
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,326
For God's sake, man...

591
00:38:16,042 --> 00:38:18,210
Congratulations. Great job.

592
00:38:18,711 --> 00:38:21,255
Bravo! Bravo!

593
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:24,884
Pamela, you look lovely.

594
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:26,677
So, Phillipe...

595
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:27,970
...satisfied?

596
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:29,638
Always, Jean.

597
00:38:31,682 --> 00:38:33,559
What can I say?

598
00:38:34,393 --> 00:38:35,811
<i>Outstanding.</i>

599
00:38:36,979 --> 00:38:39,774
<i>Go figure it, a guy like Moyez...</i>

600
00:38:40,149 --> 00:38:42,652
<i>...living in some subterranean shithole...</i>

601
00:38:42,735 --> 00:38:46,489
...all the while he's walking around
with $15 million in the bank.

602
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:48,074
You're kidding.

603
00:38:48,324 --> 00:38:50,910
What do you think he's paying us in?
Goat's blood?

604
00:38:50,993 --> 00:38:54,789
Tarzan, we're billing you out
at $400 an hour, my friend.

605
00:38:54,955 --> 00:38:58,501
I don't see a whole lot of pro-bono work
in your immediate future.

606
00:38:58,584 --> 00:39:01,754
I figured you came down to make sure
I didn't fuck this up.

607
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:03,172
Maybe I did.

608
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:07,218
Don't get too cocky, my boy.
No matter how good you are...

609
00:39:07,426 --> 00:39:10,262
...don't let them see you coming.
That's the gaffe, my friend.

610
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:12,515
You've gotta keep yourself small.

611
00:39:12,723 --> 00:39:13,808
Innocuous.

612
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,518
Be the little guy.

613
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:17,687
You know, the nerd, the leper...

614
00:39:18,104 --> 00:39:20,523
...the shitkicking surfer. Look at me.

615
00:39:22,858 --> 00:39:25,111
Underestimated from day one.

616
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:29,490
You'd never think I was
a master of the universe, would you?

617
00:39:30,491 --> 00:39:33,452
That's your only weakness,
as far as I can see.

618
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:34,787
What's that?

619
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:36,497
It's the look.

620
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:38,374
That Florida stud thing.

621
00:39:38,457 --> 00:39:39,667
What is that?

622
00:39:39,917 --> 00:39:43,421
Excuse me, ma'am.
Did I leave my boots under your bed?

623
00:39:43,796 --> 00:39:45,881
Never worked a jury that didn't have
a woman.

624
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:47,883
You know what you're missing?

625
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,844
You're missing what I have.

626
00:39:50,678 --> 00:39:54,640
There's this beautiful girl,
just fucked me 40 ways from Sunday...

627
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:58,519
...we're done, she's walking
to the bathroom, trying to walk...

628
00:39:58,686 --> 00:39:59,979
...she turns...

629
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:01,939
...she looks...

630
00:40:02,481 --> 00:40:03,649
...it's me.

631
00:40:04,442 --> 00:40:07,653
Not the Trojan army that just fucked her.
Little old me.

632
00:40:08,696 --> 00:40:10,573
She gets this look on her face like:

633
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:12,658
"How the hell did that happen?"

634
00:40:14,994 --> 00:40:17,413
I'm the hand up Mona Lisa's skirt.

635
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:19,999
I'm a surprise, Kevin.

636
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,460
They don't see me coming.

637
00:40:22,793 --> 00:40:24,420
That's what you're missing.

638
00:40:24,503 --> 00:40:26,088
Where's the chicken?

639
00:40:38,934 --> 00:40:43,731
There's a chicken, plays tic-tac-toe,
never loses. He's famous.

640
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,777
Never loses, like you.

641
00:40:50,112 --> 00:40:52,365
Come on. I'll show you
the fastest way uptown.

642
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:54,617
Learn the subways, Kevin.

643
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:56,869
Use them.

644
00:40:57,203 --> 00:40:58,954
Stay in the trenches.

645
00:40:59,872 --> 00:41:01,374
Only way I travel.

646
00:41:08,881 --> 00:41:10,716
What happened to the green?

647
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,051
I loved the green!

648
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:13,219
Honey, you're late!

649
00:41:13,302 --> 00:41:16,138
We're due up at the Barzoon's palace
in 15 minutes.

650
00:41:16,222 --> 00:41:17,973
What's all this?

651
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,225
All what?

652
00:41:19,308 --> 00:41:23,145
Jackie says the "who's who" of New York
is gonna be there tonight.

653
00:41:23,479 --> 00:41:25,731
- All this?
- Oh, that.

654
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:28,484
It was going to be a nursery...

655
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:32,029
...then I remembered you'd have to be
home long enough to knock me up.

656
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:34,949
So now I'm thinking of building
a law library.

657
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:36,909
Oh, baby.

658
00:41:40,496 --> 00:41:42,164
Tell me I can handle this.

659
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:43,833
You can handle this.

660
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,293
- Say something nice.
- Something nice.

661
00:41:50,089 --> 00:41:53,426
Promise me you won't
leave me alone in there.

662
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:55,469
I promise.

663
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:02,226
There you are.

664
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:07,982
Diana Barzoon. Eddie's wife.

665
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:09,650
Nice to meet you.

666
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:12,987
Kevin Lomax, Health Code Warrior.

667
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:14,322
All hail.

668
00:42:14,405 --> 00:42:17,616
- Mr. Barzoon, this is Mary Ann.
- Nice to meet you.

669
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,161
Well, Kevin, here they are.

670
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:24,165
Top of the food chain and dinner is served.

671
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:25,916
I throw these parties twice a year.

672
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,713
Stock market, real estate, politics. They're
all players, and they're all prospects.

673
00:42:31,756 --> 00:42:32,923
Congratulations.

674
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:34,925
Remember Rashid? Just in from Beirut.

675
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:36,260
Congratulations.

676
00:42:36,344 --> 00:42:38,471
Bright young lights.

677
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:41,891
You're going to like this. Come on.

678
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:44,477
Somebody I want you to meet.

679
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:47,980
Kevin and Mary Ann Lomax,
this is Senator Alfonse D'Amato.

680
00:42:48,147 --> 00:42:49,940
Ambassador Charles Gagano.

681
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:53,277
In case you didn't know,
these are the Republicans of New York.

682
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:55,696
Barzoon always overstates things.

683
00:42:56,113 --> 00:43:00,034
Donald Trump was supposed to be here,
but he had a business emergency.

684
00:43:00,826 --> 00:43:03,746
I knew I'd find you here.
I'd like you to meet my wife.

685
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:05,247
Mary Ann, this is Pam Garrety.

686
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:07,124
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

687
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:09,627
- We're partners in crime.
- Someone you must meet.

688
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:11,629
Excuse me. This is important.

689
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:14,465
- You are so beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

690
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:17,635
- I heard you met the senator.
- Yes, I did.

691
00:43:17,718 --> 00:43:19,136
- I was married to him.
- Really?

692
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,388
Kidding.

693
00:43:24,517 --> 00:43:27,186
I'd like you to meet Kevin Lomax.
Kevin is from Florida.

694
00:43:27,269 --> 00:43:29,063
He's new to the firm.

695
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:31,607
The senator cannot leave.

696
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,318
Who's that with the senator?

697
00:43:35,695 --> 00:43:37,947
- Oh, God, girl.
- You haven't met him yet?

698
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,281
No, who is he?

699
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:41,909
I swear he can hear us.

700
00:43:42,076 --> 00:43:44,036
Hell, he can smell us.

701
00:43:44,537 --> 00:43:46,038
Mary Ann...

702
00:43:46,747 --> 00:43:47,832
...John Milton.

703
00:43:47,915 --> 00:43:51,127
I was hoping I'd see you here tonight.
And here you are.

704
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:53,379
Already swimming with the sharks.

705
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:55,131
Careful, hon.

706
00:43:56,298 --> 00:44:00,261
Come on, if you keep thinking small,
we'll never make any money on you.

707
00:44:00,386 --> 00:44:02,138
These parties don't come cheap.

708
00:44:02,221 --> 00:44:05,016
Call him. Talk to him.
See what they have to say.

709
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,268
Just get it on tape.

710
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:11,272
It's a wonderful opportunity for Kevin.

711
00:44:11,897 --> 00:44:14,692
Yes, Kevin.
He's going to do all right if he...

712
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:17,737
...buys a few new suits...

713
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,574
...learns a few new tricks, he's there.

714
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:23,909
It's you. What about you?

715
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:26,579
Your family, you've got to miss them. No?

716
00:44:28,914 --> 00:44:33,127
I told Kevin the only thing worse
than not having a father was having mine.

717
00:44:34,378 --> 00:44:35,588
I can relate.

718
00:44:37,256 --> 00:44:39,091
I can, believe me.

719
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:49,769
The worst vice is advice.

720
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,940
But may I make a suggestion?

721
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:58,152
It's a sensitive...

722
00:44:59,612 --> 00:45:02,448
It's about your hair, that's why I ask.

723
00:45:03,157 --> 00:45:05,117
No, go ahead.

724
00:45:05,868 --> 00:45:07,662
I mean, you don't like it?

725
00:45:08,788 --> 00:45:10,915
I like it fine. It's beautiful.

726
00:45:11,624 --> 00:45:12,958
It's just...

727
00:45:14,293 --> 00:45:16,003
It doesn't belong to you.

728
00:45:16,837 --> 00:45:18,756
You're too alive for a perm.

729
00:45:19,131 --> 00:45:20,508
It's not you.

730
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:23,469
You should pull your hair back.

731
00:45:25,971 --> 00:45:27,848
Do it. See what happens.

732
00:45:28,015 --> 00:45:30,601
Right now, here, you want me
to pull my hair back?

733
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:32,186
Is that so terrible?

734
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:34,939
I'd love to do it, but if I did...

735
00:45:35,022 --> 00:45:37,900
...everyone in this room
who's pretending not to be watching us...

736
00:45:37,984 --> 00:45:41,529
...would naturally assume
that we were fucking or something.

737
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,158
Please.

738
00:45:51,122 --> 00:45:52,206
Okay.

739
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,385
It's fun to be right.

740
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,806
Excuse me.

741
00:46:11,142 --> 00:46:12,560
That's a vision.

742
00:46:15,062 --> 00:46:16,897
You've gotta cut your hair.

743
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,110
Are you serious?

744
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:25,323
A woman's shoulders are the frontlines
of her mystique.

745
00:46:27,366 --> 00:46:28,659
And her neck...

746
00:46:30,578 --> 00:46:32,121
...if she's alive...

747
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:36,500
...has all the mystery of a border town.

748
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,796
A no man's land...

749
00:46:43,257 --> 00:46:44,759
...in that battle...

750
00:46:44,925 --> 00:46:47,428
...between the mind and the body.

751
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:50,514
You know...

752
00:46:51,724 --> 00:46:53,934
...your natural color would really...

753
00:46:54,018 --> 00:46:55,853
...bring out your eyes.

754
00:47:10,951 --> 00:47:12,536
Do you have this view?

755
00:47:13,537 --> 00:47:14,622
Sorry?

756
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,750
From your terrace, is this your view?

757
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:19,960
Not exactly.

758
00:47:20,711 --> 00:47:22,546
No terrace and I'm about...

759
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:24,632
...twelve floors down.

760
00:47:25,383 --> 00:47:26,676
What about you?

761
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:29,303
No, I live downtown.

762
00:47:30,638 --> 00:47:31,806
This is a...

763
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,599
...family building.

764
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:36,227
Sounds like fun.

765
00:47:38,396 --> 00:47:39,772
Downtown, I mean.

766
00:47:40,564 --> 00:47:42,733
I'm just getting to know the city.

767
00:47:43,317 --> 00:47:45,319
Is it everything you expected?

768
00:47:45,987 --> 00:47:46,988
More.

769
00:47:47,238 --> 00:47:50,574
I say we ride them as far as we can,
and then eat them.

770
00:47:51,742 --> 00:47:54,745
Excuse me, Jackie.
Have you guys seen Kevin anywhere?

771
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:56,789
No, I'm sure he's around.

772
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:01,210
Are you alone?

773
00:48:04,588 --> 00:48:06,007
You mean, tonight?

774
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:10,803
Is your wife a jealous woman?

775
00:48:17,184 --> 00:48:20,021
Oh, dear, I'm going to scare you away.

776
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:22,481
No, really...

777
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:23,733
...I'm fine.

778
00:48:24,567 --> 00:48:25,651
I'm fine.

779
00:48:25,735 --> 00:48:27,320
Bet you like to be on top.

780
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:29,655
- Don't you?
- Excuse me?

781
00:48:30,364 --> 00:48:32,033
Of the situation.

782
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,952
You prefer to be on top, right?

783
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:38,289
Depends on the view.

784
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,960
You know what I see?

785
00:48:44,962 --> 00:48:46,422
I see the future...

786
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:48,758
...of this law firm.

787
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:08,527
We need to talk, Kevin.
Something's come up.

788
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:12,365
But first I want you to find
Heath and Eddie Barzoon.

789
00:49:13,741 --> 00:49:16,369
Bring them up to my place. Do it quietly.

790
00:49:16,535 --> 00:49:17,536
Quickly.

791
00:49:19,664 --> 00:49:22,333
No problem. Arnold has a few reporters
in his pocket.

792
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,710
We'll plant a story and destroy his
credibility.

793
00:49:24,794 --> 00:49:26,212
Have you seen Kevin?

794
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:28,297
- No, I haven't, sweetie.
- Okay.

795
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:32,176
If he doesn't come to us, he'll regret it.

796
00:49:52,863 --> 00:49:53,864
Come on.

797
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:07,545
Is there more to it?

798
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:10,047
Just this room.

799
00:50:11,298 --> 00:50:13,134
And a bedroom?

800
00:50:14,969 --> 00:50:16,137
No bedroom.

801
00:50:16,637 --> 00:50:18,889
- Where does he sleep?
- Who says he sleeps?

802
00:50:18,973 --> 00:50:20,224
Where does he fuck?

803
00:50:20,307 --> 00:50:21,475
Everywhere!

804
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:25,688
What's up, John?

805
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,066
How many hours did we bill
Alex Cullen for last year?

806
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:33,571
16,242.

807
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:35,197
What did he do now?

808
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,535
Alex Cullen has just been charged
with murdering his wife...

809
00:50:40,411 --> 00:50:41,787
...her stepson...

810
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,331
...and a maid.

811
00:50:46,083 --> 00:50:47,376
When did this happen?

812
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,003
Just now. Tonight.

813
00:50:49,378 --> 00:50:52,214
I've sent Pam downtown
to make bail arrangements.

814
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:54,759
They're gonna fucking crucify him.

815
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:57,887
They're gonna line up! I gotta call Meisel.

816
00:50:58,012 --> 00:51:00,639
I want Kevin on this case.

817
00:51:02,683 --> 00:51:04,268
I hope you're kidding.

818
00:51:08,022 --> 00:51:12,777
Alexander Cullen in a Manhattan
triple murder with, excuse me, Kevin?

819
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:15,029
You're dreaming!

820
00:51:17,615 --> 00:51:19,867
You know, I've shaken hands...

821
00:51:20,034 --> 00:51:23,371
...with every marquee defense attorney
in this town.

822
00:51:23,704 --> 00:51:26,207
I'd take Kevin and I don't look back.

823
00:51:27,124 --> 00:51:30,044
John, you've got a great eye for talent.

824
00:51:30,127 --> 00:51:34,507
You're the master, but you know,
I just don't see this happening.

825
00:51:35,216 --> 00:51:37,009
I want you on board, Eddie.

826
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:43,224
I appreciate the vote of confidence,
but maybe Eddie has a point here.

827
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,268
We can get this case.
The man's our client.

828
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,854
He's a business client.

829
00:51:49,355 --> 00:51:51,607
We know him better
than he knows himself.

830
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,693
We've got the inside track.

831
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:58,030
We've got the best damn trial lawyer
in the city. It's ours to lose.

832
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,535
Tell that to Cullen.

833
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:05,121
I want Kevin to tell him.

834
00:52:05,663 --> 00:52:07,331
There's Pam.

835
00:52:10,209 --> 00:52:12,712
You gonna fight for this thing or not?

836
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:21,721
Pam?

837
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:23,514
No, it's Kevin.

838
00:52:25,683 --> 00:52:28,394
No, it's okay. I'm on it. Yeah, I'm on it.

839
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:30,229
Where are we at?

840
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:39,071
You left me there.

841
00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:44,869
I had a fucking panic attack
until Jackie told me where you were.

842
00:52:45,703 --> 00:52:47,830
Three hours! You don't even call!

843
00:52:47,913 --> 00:52:48,873
Stop.

844
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,416
Reset.

845
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,420
I'm upstairs with Milton,
Heath and Barzoon.

846
00:52:54,712 --> 00:52:58,841
There's a good possibility I'm about
to catch a triple homicide defendant...

847
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:00,343
...who also happens to be...

848
00:53:00,426 --> 00:53:03,721
...one of the largest real-estate developers
in this city.

849
00:53:05,139 --> 00:53:06,932
I had to bail on the party.

850
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,018
You bailed on me.

851
00:53:12,313 --> 00:53:14,732
- Did you hear me?
- I was all by myself!

852
00:53:14,899 --> 00:53:16,525
For three whole hours.

853
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:19,570
The next time you make a promise,
try and keep it!

854
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:21,405
You gotta be kidding me, right?

855
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:24,825
Go to hell. And you can go to sleep
on the fucking couch!

856
00:53:28,412 --> 00:53:31,457
- You sure he's up there?
- Yeah, CNN passed the word.

857
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,292
<i>Look at this.</i>

858
00:53:33,417 --> 00:53:36,879
<i>I'm not out 20 minutes,</i>
<i>and I'm being followed by the press.</i>

859
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:38,422
They're like insects.

860
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:41,008
Alex, just calm down and listen, okay?

861
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,515
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
Maybe he is a whiz kid, but Jesus Christ!

862
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,267
This is my ass we're talking about!

863
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:54,438
Alex, you know how this town works.

864
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:59,694
You've got enemies here
you haven't heard from.

865
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,738
Now, with this...

866
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,074
...now that you're down...

867
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:07,034
...I'd get ready for one of those...

868
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,662
...Class-A, New York-style pigfucks.

869
00:54:10,496 --> 00:54:11,747
You know what's coming.

870
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:15,626
Now you're going to have to ask yourself,
"who do you trust?"

871
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,837
I don't know.

872
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:19,922
I'm gonna have to look around.

873
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:25,845
You don't have time to shop, Mr. Cullen.

874
00:54:25,928 --> 00:54:29,640
Jury selection started today
at every breakfast table in the city.

875
00:54:29,807 --> 00:54:31,642
This is what people know:

876
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,686
Three dead bodies.

877
00:54:34,228 --> 00:54:35,855
You discover the crime.

878
00:54:35,938 --> 00:54:39,984
You call it in. You've got blood
on your person and clothes.

879
00:54:41,485 --> 00:54:42,945
And Mr. Cullen...

880
00:54:44,488 --> 00:54:46,240
Your prints are on the murder weapon.

881
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,908
How do you know that?

882
00:54:48,492 --> 00:54:51,078
There's a second print in blood.

883
00:54:51,203 --> 00:54:54,790
It's a partial of a hand on the wall
next to the bodies.

884
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:59,003
I have keys. I called the cops from
the house! I touched the goddamn wall!

885
00:54:59,086 --> 00:55:00,546
I panicked! I was panicked!

886
00:55:00,629 --> 00:55:02,798
We need 12 people
who can see past all that.

887
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:06,010
- I touched the goddamn wall!
- I'd get in front of this fast.

888
00:55:06,093 --> 00:55:08,387
I panicked! Is that a crime?

889
00:55:09,263 --> 00:55:11,098
I didn't kill anybody.

890
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,393
This is a nightmare.

891
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:18,022
How am I going to convince anybody?
I'm innocent.

892
00:55:19,815 --> 00:55:21,359
He's right, Alex.

893
00:55:21,692 --> 00:55:23,778
People need to hear these things.

894
00:55:23,861 --> 00:55:25,404
Christ, Eddie.

895
00:55:26,113 --> 00:55:28,783
You're not happy tomorrow?
The next day?

896
00:55:29,533 --> 00:55:30,993
We'll move over.

897
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,412
But right now, this moment...

898
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,290
...you need immediate representation.

899
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,376
I have a 14-year-old stepdaughter...

900
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:41,128
...who I care more about
than anything in this world.

901
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:43,923
They wouldn't let me talk to her
from downtown.

902
00:55:44,173 --> 00:55:46,425
They won't let me talk to her
now that I'm out!

903
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,178
We need to issue a statement.

904
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,848
He's a winner, Alex.

905
00:55:53,182 --> 00:55:54,892
Just like you were.

906
00:55:55,059 --> 00:55:57,311
And they'll never see him coming.

907
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:01,440
Jesus Christ.

908
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,697
I've got some tough phone calls
I've got to...

909
00:56:15,454 --> 00:56:16,998
My place, tomorrow.

910
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:18,374
Alone.

911
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:26,465
You better be every fucking inch
as good as he says you are.

912
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:38,019
Not if they were giving it away.

913
00:56:38,352 --> 00:56:40,938
Come on, Mary Ann.
Let's check out Yoshi's.

914
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,399
- Andrea?
- Yes?

915
00:56:43,482 --> 00:56:44,942
Another one of these, please.

916
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,235
Right away.

917
00:56:46,485 --> 00:56:48,654
- No, no, no!
- Yes, yes, yes...

918
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,158
I want you loose and pliable this afternoon.

919
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:57,371
Oh, Lord, this is $3,000.

920
00:56:58,497 --> 00:57:00,124
You know what you should do?

921
00:57:00,207 --> 00:57:01,751
You should buy it...

922
00:57:02,209 --> 00:57:05,004
...wear it once, and then throw it away.

923
00:57:05,379 --> 00:57:07,089
That will loosen you up.

924
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,468
I say spend it all.

925
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:15,181
If you never see your husband,
have a relationship with his money.

926
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:16,599
I swear...

927
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:21,103
...if Eddie wasn't afraid of me
shouting my mouth off...

928
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:24,023
...he would've put a cellulite clause
in the pre-nup.

929
00:57:24,106 --> 00:57:26,233
Dr. Robert, I'm telling you...

930
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,111
...he's a miracle man.
You've seen my new tits.

931
00:57:29,278 --> 00:57:31,113
Who does it better than that?

932
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,449
It's not my tits I'm worried about.

933
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:37,453
Not too big...

934
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,789
Perfect.

935
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,208
Real or not?

936
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,087
They look real.

937
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:48,547
They must be real.

938
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,592
Feel them.

939
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,052
No, it's okay, really.

940
00:57:53,135 --> 00:57:56,097
Go ahead. That's the ultimate test.
Come on.

941
00:57:59,558 --> 00:58:00,643
Feel real?

942
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,478
Yes, absolutely real.

943
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:04,981
Dr. Robert.

944
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,902
When you're ready.

945
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,678
So, what do you think?

946
00:58:38,597 --> 00:58:42,476
I don't care if they can hear me.
I don't care!

947
00:58:43,602 --> 00:58:45,855
I don't like it here, Kevin.

948
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,400
And these women! My God, I mean,
I'm seeing things for Christ's sake!

949
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:51,777
- You just left them in the store?
- Yes!

950
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,321
- Calm down!
- No!

951
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:54,697
Listen to me!

952
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,034
First...

953
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:02,246
You do this radical thing to your hair.

954
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:03,748
You hate it.

955
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,333
Stop. It's fine.

956
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,337
I think it's fine.
But I also think it's traumatic.

957
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:14,216
You've got the pressure of fitting in
with new friends.

958
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:16,135
A new place.

959
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,263
Add to that a couple bottles of wine.

960
00:59:19,638 --> 00:59:22,391
No. It wasn't the wine, Kevin.

961
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:26,187
It wasn't the wine, or my hair,
or talking to Kathy...

962
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,688
...or anything like that!

963
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:30,399
Because I know
that's what you're gonna say.

964
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,109
What about Kathy?

965
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:33,986
What about your sister?

966
00:59:34,236 --> 00:59:36,614
What about her? She's pregnant again.

967
00:59:37,573 --> 00:59:39,742
That's got nothing to do with this?

968
00:59:42,995 --> 00:59:45,581
Kevin, I never see you anymore.

969
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:50,503
And now that you've got this big case,
it's just only gonna get worse.

970
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,338
If you can believe it...

971
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:56,342
...I'm actually looking forward
to having your mother come and visit.

972
00:59:56,425 --> 00:59:57,885
What about the apartment?

973
00:59:57,968 --> 00:59:59,553
Goddamn you!

974
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:01,806
Why do you always
have to change things around?

975
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:05,601
This is not about the apartment!
I hate this stupid place!

976
01:00:07,603 --> 01:00:08,729
You know...

977
01:00:09,438 --> 01:00:11,857
...you buy a couple new suits
and you're fine.

978
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,484
It's a little more than that.

979
01:00:13,567 --> 01:00:15,903
I have this whole fucking place to fill!

980
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:20,032
I know we have all this money
and it's supposed to be fun, but it's not!

981
01:00:20,324 --> 01:00:24,453
It's like a test.
The whole thing is like one big test.

982
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,622
And God!

983
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,800
I am so lonely!

984
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,345
I miss you so much.

985
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:43,639
I'm sorry, baby.

986
01:00:44,306 --> 01:00:46,809
I don't know what to do.

987
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:50,855
Let's make a baby.

988
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,111
Don't tease me.

989
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:58,738
I wouldn't do that.

990
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,115
Not unless you asked.

991
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,913
Oh, baby.

992
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:32,605
Do you have this view?

993
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,432
Make love to me.

994
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:54,186
What are you doing?

995
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,343
Stop.

996
01:03:26,927 --> 01:03:27,928
Oh, God.

997
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,139
God!

998
01:03:30,222 --> 01:03:31,599
Where are you?

999
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:33,768
I'm right here.

1000
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:37,229
No, you're not.

1001
01:03:44,236 --> 01:03:48,324
- Why do we have to keep going?
- Because it needs to be clear.

1002
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:52,328
Because I need to know
and understand exactly...

1003
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,913
...what happened.

1004
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,500
You're standing there, you look down...

1005
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,669
...there's the gun.

1006
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,672
I don't know why I picked it up.

1007
01:04:02,838 --> 01:04:05,675
It was before I saw Elucinda's body.

1008
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,594
You kneeled down to pick it up?

1009
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:13,516
You work late, you come home,
you walk in, everybody's dead!

1010
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,184
It's not something you plan for!

1011
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:17,269
Stop. Back up.

1012
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:20,773
Two prints by the gun.

1013
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:23,567
"Right hand."

1014
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,861
"Right knee."

1015
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,531
Right knee.

1016
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,533
We've been over this.

1017
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,368
I'm trying to picture it.

1018
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,619
Your hand...

1019
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,621
...your hand came from...

1020
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:39,750
...inside and underneath?

1021
01:04:41,877 --> 01:04:45,297
Do you want to see it? Here.
I'll fucking show you.

1022
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,727
See? Did you see it? Was it clear?

1023
01:04:58,144 --> 01:04:59,312
You got it?

1024
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,855
Whose gun is that?

1025
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,649
- It's mine!
- Are you out of your mind?

1026
01:05:03,899 --> 01:05:07,236
You're charged with a triple homicide,
you're walking around with a gun!

1027
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,655
I have had nine death threats!

1028
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,824
Give it over. Give me the gun.

1029
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,993
I gotta protect myself.

1030
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:18,331
That's my job. When the case is over,
you can have it back.

1031
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,461
This is a deal breaker, Alex.

1032
01:05:36,932 --> 01:05:38,100
Let's wrap it up.

1033
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,560
So, what's next?

1034
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,189
We need to talk to your assistant,
Mrs. Black.

1035
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,398
Call her.

1036
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:47,485
You feel confident she'll back you
on the time?

1037
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,072
Melissa, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:53,866
She's okay. She's a straight arrow.

1039
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,371
We're going to talk to her...

1040
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,625
...and you're not going
to talk to anybody, all right?

1041
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:04,960
All right?

1042
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:09,590
No comment.

1043
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:14,220
There they are!

1044
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,432
Kevin, how about a couple shots?

1045
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,435
How does it feel to get
the biggest murder trial in New York?

1046
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,064
Look over here! Are you really
going to plead Cullen not guilty?

1047
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,565
What is happening?

1048
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:29,694
Since the case,
Kevin's picture's been in the paper.

1049
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:33,114
He always did like to stick his nose
in the camera.

1050
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,242
- Sorry about that.
- No problem.

1051
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:38,285
Did you have a nice dinner?

1052
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,705
Oh, I surely did. Are you hungry?

1053
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:42,540
Oh, no, ma'am. Thank you.

1054
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,042
Welcome to Babylon, Ma.

1055
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:46,627
Speak of the devil.

1056
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,465
I was just telling them the Moyez story.

1057
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:53,342
Really?

1058
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:55,678
This is your mother.

1059
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,346
Yes, Mom, this is...

1060
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:58,723
John Milton.

1061
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,559
Alice Lomax.

1062
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,186
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1063
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,480
How do you do?

1064
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,235
- You're looking lovely.
- Thanks.

1065
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,073
I believe you met Christabella.

1066
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,658
Yes, I think we did.

1067
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,327
And Gizelle.

1068
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:21,495
Fresh in from Paris.

1069
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:23,456
Great.

1070
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,708
Nice to meet you.

1071
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,503
Three for you...

1072
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:31,088
...and my place.

1073
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,423
Thanks for the champagne.

1074
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:34,675
You're very welcome, Kevin.

1075
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:40,473
This isn't really your first visit
to New York, now, is it, Mrs. Lomax?

1076
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:44,894
Yes.

1077
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:56,113
You've done one hell of a job
bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.

1078
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,115
I'm sure...

1079
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,867
...it wasn't easy.

1080
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,704
No.

1081
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,417
Mom, we're here.

1082
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:10,252
Good night to you.

1083
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:13,506
Good night, Mary Ann.

1084
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,549
Kevin, hang on.

1085
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,345
How about Cullen? How's it going?

1086
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,888
Everything on beam?

1087
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:23,015
That's a long conversation.

1088
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,643
Want to come up and tell me?

1089
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,061
Now?

1090
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,362
Let's talk tomorrow.

1091
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,282
You sure?

1092
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:53,170
Is that what you're doing
when you're working late?

1093
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:54,797
What're you talking about?

1094
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,174
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1095
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:59,343
- That's ridiculous.
- Yeah, right.

1096
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,845
I'm going to bed.

1097
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,847
- Good night, Alice.
- 'Night.

1098
01:09:16,444 --> 01:09:18,279
Oh, shit!

1099
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,826
Mom, what are you doing?

1100
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:25,411
I'm going home.

1101
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,330
What are you talking about?

1102
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,582
I don't feel right.

1103
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:32,084
Look, you just got here.

1104
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:36,756
And I just got my teeth kicked in
on the front page, so I gotta run.

1105
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,508
We'll talk later, okay?

1106
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,682
I have to go, Kevin.

1107
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:48,684
I miss my church.

1108
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:53,147
This is New York. There must be
20,000 churches. Take your pick.

1109
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,484
You need to do a better job with Mary Ann.

1110
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:58,194
She is not well.

1111
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,113
- This place is not good for her.
- So stay.

1112
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,532
Take care of her, if you're so concerned.

1113
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:04,992
Help me out.

1114
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:07,578
I'll take her home if you let me.

1115
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,289
This is home. Understand?

1116
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:11,791
This is where we live.

1117
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:14,043
I'm not going back to Gainesville.

1118
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,795
Unbelievable.

1119
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:17,922
"Wide is the gate...

1120
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,050
"...and broad is the way
that leadeth to temptation."

1121
01:10:21,384 --> 01:10:22,968
It's a little early for Scripture.

1122
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,888
I'm going to work.
You can do whatever you want.

1123
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,580
Does my babysitter have to testify?

1124
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,834
We need her to establish
the time you returned home.

1125
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:58,004
She doesn't have a green card,
is why I ask.

1126
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,715
I would hate for her to get in trouble.

1127
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:01,882
Tell you what, Melissa...

1128
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,511
Let's talk to her first. See where
she stands and take it from there.

1129
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:08,264
I'll make sure Melissa gets down to the car.

1130
01:11:08,347 --> 01:11:10,683
Mr. Cullen didn't kill those people.

1131
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,936
I know him. He's a difficult man,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

1132
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:16,314
That's why we're all working so hard.

1133
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,357
Thank you.

1134
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,445
Can I have the car stop
at my ex-husband's?

1135
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,114
- My son left his jacket there.
- Sure.

1136
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:34,123
Remember, no shredding in the building
trash, only in the private refuse.

1137
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,376
Excelsior Securities, who's handling that?

1138
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,712
- I am.
- All this has got to go.

1139
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:42,214
Guatemala, Sudan, Cyprus...

1140
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,887
Vagada Holdings, it'll take you all night.
Just Vagada Holdings.

1141
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:52,475
I thought I was the only one working late.

1142
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:56,729
So did we.

1143
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,483
Back to work. This is not a break.

1144
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:01,734
Good news.

1145
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,904
We just wrapped up with
Cullen's assistant. Looks like a great alibi.

1146
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:06,697
What a pleasant surprise.

1147
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:11,661
Looks like you've got your hands full.

1148
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,913
It's just a little...

1149
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,498
...housekeeping.

1150
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,000
If anyone should ask...

1151
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,586
...you never saw this.

1152
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:22,254
Who would ask?

1153
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:24,507
Weaver.

1154
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:25,800
Who's that?

1155
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,428
Justice Department. Weaver Commission.

1156
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,182
You don't know about him?

1157
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,350
Sorry.

1158
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,186
How nice for you.

1159
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:42,066
Grab your coat. The night is young.
We're going to the Garden. Ringside.

1160
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,442
Title fight.

1161
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,111
Roy Jones, Jr.

1162
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,988
I have to call Mary Ann.

1163
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,447
Do it on the way.

1164
01:12:50,491 --> 01:12:51,784
Get my message?

1165
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:54,453
I did. You write beautifully.

1166
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,459
What's this Weaver Commission?

1167
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,753
I don't like to micro-manage.

1168
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,964
Find the talent, then delegate.

1169
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:07,925
Who the hell knows what Eddie's up to?

1170
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:11,137
He's got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

1171
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,306
Excuse me.

1172
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,641
What the fuck are you looking at?

1173
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:18,644
You. You deaf or something?
You don't hear me?

1174
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,396
I hear you fine.

1175
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,315
So get the fuck out of my car.

1176
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:26,610
Why? I didn't know it was your car.
I'm having a good time here.

1177
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,362
I'm telling you, motherfucker...

1178
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:29,655
...get the fuck out of my car...

1179
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:30,614
Shit.

1180
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:33,200
Get out before I cut your throat.

1181
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:34,452
Fuck that.

1182
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,103
How do you know?

1183
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,443
Enjoy yourself.

1184
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,070
You still got time.

1185
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,657
There's a train coming the other way.
You'll just catch it.

1186
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,742
You'll thank me in the morning.

1187
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,160
If you ain't right...

1188
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,411
I'm right.

1189
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:18,704
You'll see.

1190
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:21,749
Invigorating.

1191
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,418
What did you say to him?

1192
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:29,548
I told him if he didn't leave us alone,
you'd kick his ass.

1193
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:32,885
Look, there's a lady getting up
from her seat. Come on.

1194
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,223
Give it to him! You want this round?
You are on!

1195
01:14:38,057 --> 01:14:41,060
Roy's gonna get him. Now, now, now!

1196
01:14:51,404 --> 01:14:52,613
Fixed!

1197
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:01,080
- What a beauty!
- I'm glad you could come!

1198
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:05,376
I want you to meet my new heavyweight,
here: Kevin Lomax.

1199
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:06,919
How are you?

1200
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,129
I'm well.

1201
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:28,774
And say what?

1202
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:30,985
He's the senior partner at the...

1203
01:15:33,446 --> 01:15:35,823
You're really starting to piss me off.

1204
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:47,126
Yes, I'm having one cigarette.

1205
01:15:47,293 --> 01:15:50,796
You want me to lie?
One cigarette after seven months is not...

1206
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,007
That's exactly what I'm saying!

1207
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,636
Go to bed. I have no idea.

1208
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:10,149
Stop. This guy pays our bills.

1209
01:16:10,316 --> 01:16:14,111
The food, the heat, the rent
on that enormous apartment we live in.

1210
01:16:15,321 --> 01:16:16,864
I live there, too.

1211
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,496
Give it back to me!

1212
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,295
Babs Coleman.

1213
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:33,214
Kevin Lomax.

1214
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,300
Babs is from Georgia Tech.
It's your neck of the woods.

1215
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:37,426
There's Tiffany.

1216
01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:40,096
New additions. Where are you from?

1217
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,889
Don't tell me!

1218
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,058
Michigan!

1219
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,395
How'd you know? Oh, my goodness.

1220
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,021
How did he know?

1221
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:50,731
That is so good.

1222
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,206
Cheers.

1223
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,135
Hello?

1224
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:03,596
Who is there?

1225
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,057
I got a knife.

1226
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:30,498
Oh, Jesus.

1227
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:38,839
Baby...

1228
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,300
...how'd you get here?

1229
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:44,762
Are you okay?

1230
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,432
Oh, God.

1231
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:53,437
Where's your mommy?

1232
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:58,025
You ain't got no mommy?
What do you got there?

1233
01:18:58,275 --> 01:19:00,528
What are you playing with?

1234
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,739
What are you playing with?

1235
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:11,706
Oh, God!

1236
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:22,800
Baby, please.

1237
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,219
Baby, there is no blood.

1238
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,139
There is no blood. It was a dream.

1239
01:19:28,222 --> 01:19:29,640
It was a dream.

1240
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,394
It's not a dream if it's true.

1241
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:39,442
Look, let's get you undressed
and in the tub, okay?

1242
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,735
No!

1243
01:19:41,152 --> 01:19:42,737
I know you.

1244
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:46,574
You'll leave me now for sure.

1245
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:49,577
No! Get away from me!

1246
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,249
I'm confused.

1247
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,751
Why?

1248
01:19:57,668 --> 01:19:59,086
What is it now?

1249
01:20:01,339 --> 01:20:03,049
Did you like the green?

1250
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:05,259
You did, didn't you?

1251
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:06,844
We should go back to the green.

1252
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:09,764
I'm calling the doctor.
I'm going to get you some help.

1253
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:11,766
They took my ovaries, Kevin.

1254
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:17,355
They took my ovaries!

1255
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:19,607
I told you! Right here!

1256
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:23,194
Mary Ann, it was a nightmare.
It didn't happen.

1257
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:30,284
My sisters have
seven children between them.

1258
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,248
My mother had Derek when she was 45.

1259
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,085
You could've set a clock by my periods.

1260
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,294
Baby...

1261
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,172
...what are you talking about?

1262
01:20:44,799 --> 01:20:47,259
Kevin, I can't have children.

1263
01:20:47,718 --> 01:20:48,719
What?

1264
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:50,596
Says who?

1265
01:20:53,975 --> 01:20:55,559
The doctor.

1266
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:58,312
I was there yesterday.

1267
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:02,692
"Non-specific ovarian failure."

1268
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:06,153
That's ridiculous.

1269
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:10,491
Oh, God.

1270
01:21:12,243 --> 01:21:13,953
Did you just hear that?

1271
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,080
Listen.

1272
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,500
Can you hear that?

1273
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:23,587
No.

1274
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:30,011
You're going to leave me, aren't you?

1275
01:21:33,848 --> 01:21:35,516
I know you.

1276
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:37,768
God...

1277
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:42,189
No, Kevin.

1278
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:44,108
It's these monsters.

1279
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:47,528
I dreamt about this.

1280
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:50,281
Baby, I gotta take this.

1281
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,867
No, you've gotta listen to me.

1282
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,203
I gotta take this.

1283
01:21:58,205 --> 01:21:59,790
It's going to be okay.

1284
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:08,049
Fuck!

1285
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:10,635
I knew the D.A. was holding out on us.

1286
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:13,554
Get the discovery package
over here, right now.

1287
01:22:14,388 --> 01:22:16,557
I don't care. Find Cullen.

1288
01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:28,736
I get one supervised hour a week
with my stepdaughter.

1289
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:32,239
I am in there with two shrinks
and three social workers.

1290
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,242
You better have a good reason
for calling me out.

1291
01:22:35,326 --> 01:22:38,496
Your wife, the day she was killed,
had lunch with a friend.

1292
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:41,874
She says, and I quote:
"Alex is fucking around and I can prove it."

1293
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:43,918
That's hearsay. That never gets in.

1294
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,252
Wrong answer.

1295
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,755
Your prenuptial agreement's
on file at the firm.

1296
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:50,508
The contract is void
in the event of marital infidelity.

1297
01:22:50,591 --> 01:22:52,927
You fuck around, she gets rich.

1298
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:55,513
That's a motive, Alex.

1299
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:58,182
What do I need to know?

1300
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:08,776
Melissa, my assistant.

1301
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:11,946
She wasn't even that good a fuck.

1302
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:13,280
And...

1303
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,866
...on the night in question?

1304
01:23:23,374 --> 01:23:27,044
I was boning my assistant
the night my wife got shot.

1305
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,719
I've got to re-interview Melissa.

1306
01:23:34,885 --> 01:23:38,055
No, forget it. We're not telling that story.

1307
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:41,559
Juries want honesty.
Fuck with that at your peril.

1308
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:45,980
Alessandra, wait!

1309
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:50,735
Not now. Mrs. Skylar, please!

1310
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,528
Time's up, Mr. Cullen.

1311
01:23:53,404 --> 01:23:54,196
Alex!

1312
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:55,573
I can't!

1313
01:23:56,574 --> 01:23:59,243
This isn't fair. I had 15 more minutes.

1314
01:23:59,577 --> 01:24:02,246
You'll just have to wait until next week.

1315
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:06,292
- I'll see you next week.
- That's it, I'm sorry.

1316
01:24:07,793 --> 01:24:09,462
<i>For sleep.</i>

1317
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,881
<i>And she can take that during the day?</i>

1318
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,799
No, she won't be driving.

1319
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,969
I'll have the pharmacy call you right back.

1320
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:21,474
He's not sure. He thinks it could
be some kind of hormonal imbalance.

1321
01:24:21,641 --> 01:24:23,559
I'm taking you off the case.

1322
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:26,896
I want you to drop this case.

1323
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,648
This case? Cullen?

1324
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:31,859
- I've got a jury showing up.
- Do you love this woman?

1325
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,236
- Of course I do.
- Then what are you doing?

1326
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,613
She's sick.

1327
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:38,949
Everyone will understand. I'll understand.

1328
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:40,576
What about Cullen?

1329
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,662
We find somebody new.

1330
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,455
You consult.

1331
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:46,540
You live to fight another day.

1332
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:49,835
What are you talking about?
I put together a great jury.

1333
01:24:50,336 --> 01:24:52,380
It's a disappointment. We have them.

1334
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:57,009
All of us have them. You use it.
You embrace it. And then you move on.

1335
01:24:59,512 --> 01:25:00,638
Hang on.

1336
01:25:00,972 --> 01:25:02,556
We've gotta talk about this.

1337
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,977
Listen to yourself, Kevin.
"We've gotta talk about this."

1338
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,812
It's your wife!

1339
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:10,022
She's sick, she needs you.

1340
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,149
She's got to come first.

1341
01:25:12,483 --> 01:25:14,068
All right, wait a minute.

1342
01:25:14,151 --> 01:25:18,489
Do you mean the possibility of leaving
this case has never entered your mind?

1343
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,704
You know what scares me?

1344
01:25:25,496 --> 01:25:27,999
I quit the case, she gets better...

1345
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,626
...and I hate her for it.

1346
01:25:31,711 --> 01:25:33,087
I don't want to resent her.

1347
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,630
I've got a winner here.

1348
01:25:34,714 --> 01:25:38,843
I've got to nail this fucker down
and put it behind me. Just get it done.

1349
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:40,177
Then...

1350
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:41,804
...then...

1351
01:25:42,179 --> 01:25:44,223
...put all my energy into her.

1352
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:52,690
I stand corrected.

1353
01:25:53,566 --> 01:25:56,485
Fill me in. Did Cullen's assistant
admit to the affair?

1354
01:25:56,569 --> 01:25:58,696
She did to me, but...

1355
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:00,448
...she won't in court.

1356
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,241
Convince her otherwise.

1357
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:05,202
And when all that evidence
is laid before you...

1358
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:09,540
...when all these pieces weave together,
you will conclude...

1359
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,167
...you will know...

1360
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:13,919
...that Alexander Cullen is guilty...

1361
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:16,088
...of murdering three people...

1362
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,923
...in cold blood...

1363
01:26:18,215 --> 01:26:20,593
...and with malice aforethought.

1364
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,303
Thank you.

1365
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:24,805
Your Honor.

1366
01:26:26,182 --> 01:26:29,518
We can break for lunch now
or you can do a stop and start.

1367
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,896
If it's a choice, I'll go now.

1368
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:34,398
I won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.

1369
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:35,733
Proceed.

1370
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:43,115
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1371
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,078
...I know you've spent all morning
listening to Mr. Broygo.

1372
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:48,537
I know you're hungry.

1373
01:26:48,621 --> 01:26:51,749
What I need to tell you
won't take very long at all.

1374
01:26:53,084 --> 01:26:55,753
I don't like Alexander Cullen.

1375
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:58,923
I don't think he's a nice person.

1376
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:01,634
I don't expect you to like him.

1377
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,596
He's been a terrible husband
to all three of his wives.

1378
01:27:05,763 --> 01:27:08,849
He's been a destructive force
in the lives of his stepchildren.

1379
01:27:08,933 --> 01:27:11,102
He's cheated the city, his partners...

1380
01:27:11,185 --> 01:27:12,353
...his employees.

1381
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:16,148
He's paid hundreds of thousands
of dollars in penalties and fines.

1382
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:17,984
I don't like him.

1383
01:27:19,318 --> 01:27:23,155
I'm going to tell you some things
during the course of this trial...

1384
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,117
...that are going to make you
like him even less.

1385
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,203
But this isn't a popularity contest.

1386
01:27:29,286 --> 01:27:30,830
It's a murder trial.

1387
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:36,252
And the single most important
provable fact of this proceeding...

1388
01:27:37,086 --> 01:27:40,923
...is that Alexander Cullen
was somewhere else...

1389
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:42,341
...when these...

1390
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:45,011
...horrible crimes took place.

1391
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:48,097
Now, the State...

1392
01:27:48,514 --> 01:27:51,017
The State is going all out here.

1393
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:53,019
They've got this whole team here...

1394
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:55,771
...throwing everything
but the kitchen sink at this case.

1395
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:57,606
I want one thing from you.

1396
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,191
That's it.

1397
01:27:59,608 --> 01:28:00,776
One thing.

1398
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,447
I want you to ask yourself:

1399
01:28:06,032 --> 01:28:08,034
"Is not liking this man...

1400
01:28:09,952 --> 01:28:12,038
"...reason enough...

1401
01:28:12,455 --> 01:28:14,457
"...to convict him of murder?"

1402
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,794
Enjoy your lunch.

1403
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:20,546
We'll talk again.

1404
01:28:22,715 --> 01:28:25,885
What the fuck was that about?
They're going to hate me!

1405
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:29,388
Listen to me like you've never
to anyone before in your life.

1406
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:31,974
I'm gonna bust my ass
to make sure they hate you.

1407
01:28:32,058 --> 01:28:36,312
Because as long as you're boning Melissa,
you're not home killing your wife!

1408
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,650
Why didn't you say something before?

1409
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,569
Then it doesn't look spontaneous.

1410
01:28:46,072 --> 01:28:47,323
You got it now.

1411
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:02,672
Saw you go in.

1412
01:29:02,755 --> 01:29:03,839
What's up?

1413
01:29:03,923 --> 01:29:05,758
Congratulations.

1414
01:29:05,925 --> 01:29:09,679
- It's not over yet.
- I'm not talking about the trial.

1415
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:11,097
What are you talking about?

1416
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,684
How the fuck does your name
get on the firm's charter?

1417
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:16,936
What?

1418
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,980
It looks like it's been there for years.

1419
01:29:19,063 --> 01:29:21,857
So, now you're a partner.
When did that happen?

1420
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:26,028
You know, I still am the managing director
of this firm.

1421
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:27,947
You want my job, take me head on.

1422
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,407
You backdoor me one more time...

1423
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:32,910
...and I'll take your partnership papers
and shove them down your throat!

1424
01:29:32,994 --> 01:29:36,414
I don't know what you're talking about.
I sure don't like your tone of voice.

1425
01:29:36,497 --> 01:29:37,581
Bullshit.

1426
01:29:37,665 --> 01:29:39,375
You've got a problem with documents...

1427
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:43,504
...I suggest you put together
one of your late-night shredding sessions.

1428
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:50,344
You think you're tough enough
to run this firm?

1429
01:29:51,137 --> 01:29:54,140
Remember the Weaver Commission
investigation?

1430
01:29:54,307 --> 01:29:55,975
Tell your mentor...

1431
01:29:56,142 --> 01:29:59,312
...the next time Weaver calls me,
maybe I'll just...

1432
01:29:59,478 --> 01:30:01,022
...pick up the phone.

1433
01:30:05,776 --> 01:30:07,987
- Was he drunk?
- I doubt it.

1434
01:30:08,154 --> 01:30:09,697
He was going running.

1435
01:30:10,156 --> 01:30:12,325
What the hell was he talking about?

1436
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,911
Eddie's got himself in trouble again.

1437
01:30:16,746 --> 01:30:20,291
And he wants me to save him.
Only this time, I can't.

1438
01:30:22,168 --> 01:30:24,378
Why does he think I'm after his job?

1439
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:27,673
You ever have any experience
with manic depression?

1440
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:28,924
Not directly, no.

1441
01:30:29,008 --> 01:30:30,176
You do now.

1442
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,135
<i>346.</i>

1443
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:33,137
It's me. Get Eddie Barzoon.

1444
01:30:33,262 --> 01:30:36,140
He may be out running,
so you might have to page him.

1445
01:30:36,223 --> 01:30:38,184
- It's an emergency.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

1446
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:40,645
You look like you could use a drink.

1447
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:42,855
Yes, thanks.

1448
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,025
<i>Eddie Barzoon, Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1449
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:51,822
<i>I nursed him through two divorces,</i>
<i>a cocaine rehab...</i>

1450
01:30:52,198 --> 01:30:54,200
...and a pregnant receptionist.

1451
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:57,119
God's creature, right?

1452
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:59,705
<i>God's special creature?</i>

1453
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,750
<i>I've warned him, Kevin.</i>

1454
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:05,211
<i>I've warned him every step of the way.</i>

1455
01:31:05,336 --> 01:31:07,964
<i>Watching him bounce around</i>
<i>like a fucking game.</i>

1456
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:09,548
<i>Like a wind-up toy.</i>

1457
01:31:09,632 --> 01:31:11,133
<i>Like 250 pounds...</i>

1458
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:14,178
<i>...of self-serving greed on wheels.</i>

1459
01:31:14,345 --> 01:31:17,223
<i>The next thousand years</i>
<i>is right around the corner.</i>

1460
01:31:17,306 --> 01:31:18,724
<i>Eddie Barzoon...</i>

1461
01:31:18,808 --> 01:31:20,893
<i>...take a good look because...</i>

1462
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:23,854
<i>...he's the poster child</i>
<i>for the next millennium.</i>

1463
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:26,774
<i>These people...</i>

1464
01:31:26,857 --> 01:31:29,402
<i>...it's no mystery where they come from.</i>

1465
01:31:32,989 --> 01:31:35,241
You sharpen the human appetite...

1466
01:31:35,324 --> 01:31:39,078
...to the point where it can split atoms
with its desire.

1467
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:41,998
You build egos the size of cathedrals.

1468
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:45,918
Fiber-optically connect the world
to every eager impulse.

1469
01:31:46,335 --> 01:31:49,463
Grease even the dullest dreams with
these dollar-green...

1470
01:31:49,547 --> 01:31:54,260
...gold-plated fantasies until every human
becomes an aspiring emperor...

1471
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:57,596
<i>...becomes his own god.</i>
<i>Where can you go from there?</i>

1472
01:31:57,763 --> 01:31:59,348
Wrong way!

1473
01:32:00,141 --> 01:32:01,267
Fuck you...

1474
01:32:01,684 --> 01:32:03,019
<i>As we're scrambling...</i>

1475
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:04,854
...from one deal to the next...

1476
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,605
...who's got his eye on the planet?

1477
01:32:06,689 --> 01:32:08,858
<i>As the air thickens, the water sours...</i>

1478
01:32:08,941 --> 01:32:12,361
<i>...even bees' honey takes on</i>
<i>the metallic taste of radioactivity...</i>

1479
01:32:12,445 --> 01:32:15,698
<i>...and it just keeps coming,</i>
<i>faster and faster.</i>

1480
01:32:16,949 --> 01:32:18,242
Help! Stop it!

1481
01:32:18,451 --> 01:32:20,953
<i>There's no chance to think, to prepare.</i>

1482
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,622
<i>It's buy futures, sell futures...</i>

1483
01:32:23,789 --> 01:32:25,708
<i>...when there is no future.</i>

1484
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,960
<i>We got a runaway train, boy.</i>

1485
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:31,964
<i>We got a billion Eddie Barzoons</i>
<i>all jogging into the future.</i>

1486
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:35,885
Every one of them is getting ready
to fistfuck God's ex-planet...

1487
01:32:36,052 --> 01:32:37,678
<i>...lick their fingers clean...</i>

1488
01:32:37,762 --> 01:32:39,972
<i>...as they reach out toward their pristine...</i>

1489
01:32:40,056 --> 01:32:41,599
<i>...cybernetic keyboards...</i>

1490
01:32:41,682 --> 01:32:44,310
...to tote up their fucking billable hours.

1491
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:46,687
<i>And then it hits home.</i>

1492
01:32:46,854 --> 01:32:49,065
<i>You got to pay your own way, Eddie.</i>

1493
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:52,109
<i>It's a little late in the game to buy out now.</i>

1494
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:53,611
Give me your watch.

1495
01:32:53,694 --> 01:32:57,239
I like this watch!
Do you think you're just going to take it?

1496
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,950
<i>Your belly's too full...</i>

1497
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:01,994
<i>...your dick is sore...</i>

1498
01:33:02,078 --> 01:33:05,831
<i>...your eyes are bloodshot and</i>
<i>you're screaming for someone to help.</i>

1499
01:33:05,915 --> 01:33:07,208
<i>But guess what?</i>

1500
01:33:07,917 --> 01:33:09,710
<i>There's no one there!</i>

1501
01:33:10,169 --> 01:33:12,171
<i>You're all alone, Eddie.</i>

1502
01:33:12,296 --> 01:33:15,132
<i>You're God's special little creature.</i>

1503
01:33:21,931 --> 01:33:23,140
Maybe it's true.

1504
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:26,268
Maybe God threw the dice once too often.

1505
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:29,146
Maybe He let us all down.

1506
01:33:38,823 --> 01:33:41,701
You testified the defendant
called you at 4:30...

1507
01:33:41,784 --> 01:33:45,371
...to ask you to come to his office gym
for the purposes of sex.

1508
01:33:45,454 --> 01:33:46,497
Yes.

1509
01:33:46,706 --> 01:33:50,376
Mr. Cullen, though,
he's not just your lover, is he?

1510
01:33:50,751 --> 01:33:52,003
He's the boss.

1511
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:55,131
Yes.

1512
01:33:55,298 --> 01:33:58,342
So two hours go by
before you act on his request?

1513
01:33:58,509 --> 01:34:00,469
Yes, I went up at 6:10.

1514
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:03,514
It was 6:10 because I heard
the weather coming on the news.

1515
01:34:03,597 --> 01:34:04,724
Okay, stop.

1516
01:34:05,933 --> 01:34:08,144
This prosecutor is no fool.

1517
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:12,523
He's going to change tempo,
attitude, tone of voice.

1518
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:16,944
He's going to come out with questions
you never thought of just to screw you up.

1519
01:34:17,028 --> 01:34:18,571
So what do we do?

1520
01:34:20,656 --> 01:34:22,658
Yes and no answers. Stay calm.

1521
01:34:23,034 --> 01:34:24,368
Exactly.

1522
01:34:27,330 --> 01:34:32,209
Is it your testimony, Mrs. Black,
that between the hours of 6:10 and 9:40...

1523
01:34:32,376 --> 01:34:35,296
...you were engaged in sexual congress
with the defendant?

1524
01:34:35,379 --> 01:34:36,172
Yes.

1525
01:34:36,255 --> 01:34:39,216
At any point
during this three-hour marathon...

1526
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,010
...did you lose sight of the defendant?

1527
01:34:41,093 --> 01:34:43,012
- No.
- Did he use the bathroom?

1528
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:45,806
- Yes.
- Is he circumcised?

1529
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,314
You understand the question?

1530
01:34:53,397 --> 01:34:54,398
Yeah.

1531
01:34:55,191 --> 01:34:57,318
So is he cut or not?

1532
01:34:57,902 --> 01:34:59,236
Yes.

1533
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:01,489
Which is it?

1534
01:35:03,532 --> 01:35:06,327
You've polished his knob
three times a week for six months.

1535
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:08,204
You don't know if he has foreskin?

1536
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:09,997
I've had enough of your fucking game!

1537
01:35:10,081 --> 01:35:13,542
Why don't you take your questions
and shove them up your ass!

1538
01:35:31,769 --> 01:35:33,145
What's happening?

1539
01:35:33,270 --> 01:35:35,106
It's Eddie Barzoon.

1540
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,357
What about him?

1541
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,609
He's dead. He was killed.

1542
01:35:38,776 --> 01:35:40,403
- When?
- Last night.

1543
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,989
- In the park.
- He was running, if you can believe it.

1544
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:44,824
What is wrong with people?

1545
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:47,368
At least they got the scumbags who did it.

1546
01:35:47,451 --> 01:35:48,411
Who?

1547
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:50,454
Two old homeless crazies.

1548
01:35:54,458 --> 01:35:56,210
You're due in court in 30 minutes.

1549
01:35:56,294 --> 01:35:59,213
- Get your things together.
- Are we finished in here or what?

1550
01:35:59,297 --> 01:36:02,591
I'll bring Melissa down to the car.
You better get going.

1551
01:36:05,636 --> 01:36:09,098
I want you to put Eddie aside.
Let me worry about it.

1552
01:36:10,766 --> 01:36:12,768
You've got to deal with Cullen.

1553
01:36:12,977 --> 01:36:16,939
You've got to marshal your strength.
Prioritize. Conserve your energy.

1554
01:36:17,315 --> 01:36:19,483
I can't put her on the stand.

1555
01:36:20,651 --> 01:36:23,362
- What choice do you have?
- I know she's lying!

1556
01:36:23,446 --> 01:36:28,326
She's lying because she didn't answer
you fast enough? She lied to you? No.

1557
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:30,828
She said nothing.

1558
01:36:31,245 --> 01:36:33,372
Fact is, you'll never know anyway.

1559
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:35,333
He killed those people.

1560
01:36:37,126 --> 01:36:38,794
You really believe that?

1561
01:36:40,129 --> 01:36:41,339
He set me up.

1562
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:44,925
Cullen fucking set me up.
Melissa... the whole thing.

1563
01:36:45,301 --> 01:36:46,469
I know it.

1564
01:36:48,638 --> 01:36:50,306
Got to go with your gut.

1565
01:36:50,681 --> 01:36:52,141
That's your advice?

1566
01:36:53,643 --> 01:36:55,478
I'll back you either way.

1567
01:36:58,147 --> 01:37:00,483
Maybe it's your time to lose.

1568
01:37:01,984 --> 01:37:03,903
Think I haven't lost before?

1569
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:15,164
We talked about this, remember?

1570
01:37:15,706 --> 01:37:16,874
Pressure.

1571
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:20,461
Take a big whiff.

1572
01:37:22,505 --> 01:37:23,714
All rise!

1573
01:37:24,048 --> 01:37:26,217
The Honorable Armand Poe presiding.

1574
01:37:33,641 --> 01:37:35,059
Please be seated.

1575
01:37:39,647 --> 01:37:41,315
All right, Mr. Lomax...

1576
01:37:41,482 --> 01:37:43,442
...you may present your case.

1577
01:38:03,004 --> 01:38:04,213
Mr. Lomax...

1578
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:28,029
I call Melissa Black.

1579
01:38:45,796 --> 01:38:47,381
Raise your right hand.

1580
01:38:47,506 --> 01:38:49,550
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...

1581
01:38:49,634 --> 01:38:51,886
...nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1582
01:38:51,969 --> 01:38:52,970
I do.

1583
01:39:19,413 --> 01:39:21,248
Feeney, it's him.

1584
01:39:24,293 --> 01:39:27,254
She didn't look well.
Felix tried to talk to her.

1585
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:29,966
- Where is she?
- Church of the Heavenly Hope.

1586
01:39:56,701 --> 01:39:57,785
Honey.

1587
01:39:59,036 --> 01:40:00,371
It's me.

1588
01:40:01,372 --> 01:40:02,623
What happened?

1589
01:40:02,873 --> 01:40:04,125
Are you okay?

1590
01:40:04,959 --> 01:40:07,753
He let himself in. You need to know that.

1591
01:40:08,379 --> 01:40:10,047
Who let himself in?

1592
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:12,049
The bath...

1593
01:40:12,216 --> 01:40:14,218
...was running or something.

1594
01:40:14,885 --> 01:40:17,013
I didn't hear him. I swear to you.

1595
01:40:17,096 --> 01:40:18,806
And then we talked.

1596
01:40:19,807 --> 01:40:22,143
And we talked for hours.

1597
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:24,562
And I haven't talked to anyone...

1598
01:40:24,729 --> 01:40:27,231
...really talked to anyone in so long.

1599
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:29,984
Did somebody hurt you?

1600
01:40:30,818 --> 01:40:31,986
Yeah.

1601
01:40:32,862 --> 01:40:33,863
Who?

1602
01:40:36,324 --> 01:40:37,325
Milton.

1603
01:40:38,451 --> 01:40:40,619
What?

1604
01:40:47,126 --> 01:40:48,669
He fucked me.

1605
01:40:51,172 --> 01:40:54,925
And I think I wanted him to,
but then I just...

1606
01:40:55,092 --> 01:40:57,720
I don't know, I just couldn't stop him.

1607
01:40:58,763 --> 01:41:00,931
He just wouldn't stop.

1608
01:41:03,851 --> 01:41:04,935
When?

1609
01:41:06,103 --> 01:41:08,105
- Baby, when?
- Today.

1610
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:13,861
The whole afternoon.

1611
01:41:15,946 --> 01:41:17,281
I'm so ashamed.

1612
01:41:18,616 --> 01:41:19,659
Today?

1613
01:41:22,119 --> 01:41:23,287
Today?

1614
01:41:24,538 --> 01:41:26,165
Today he was in court.

1615
01:41:26,332 --> 01:41:29,293
He was in court in my presence
all afternoon!

1616
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,711
- No!
- Yes!

1617
01:41:35,716 --> 01:41:37,093
God, no, Kevin.

1618
01:41:37,635 --> 01:41:39,553
Kevin, I'm not crazy.

1619
01:41:39,929 --> 01:41:41,639
You have to believe me.

1620
01:41:47,228 --> 01:41:48,479
Oh, Jesus.

1621
01:41:48,646 --> 01:41:50,564
He did this to me!

1622
01:41:54,151 --> 01:41:55,736
He did this to me.

1623
01:41:55,820 --> 01:41:57,822
What did you do to yourself?

1624
01:41:58,155 --> 01:41:59,824
What are we going to do?

1625
01:42:00,658 --> 01:42:02,284
What am I going to do?

1626
01:42:04,495 --> 01:42:08,082
Sign there. And your relationship.

1627
01:42:09,083 --> 01:42:12,920
She's calm now. This might be
a good time to say good night to her.

1628
01:42:21,345 --> 01:42:23,764
I know why this is happening.

1629
01:42:27,268 --> 01:42:28,978
They want you to sleep.

1630
01:42:30,771 --> 01:42:32,189
It's the money.

1631
01:42:33,149 --> 01:42:34,358
Blood money.

1632
01:42:35,276 --> 01:42:38,446
We just drank it down, both of us.

1633
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,781
We knew it.

1634
01:42:42,366 --> 01:42:46,912
Winning those cases, taking the money.
We knew they were guilty.

1635
01:42:47,705 --> 01:42:50,124
But you just kept on winning...

1636
01:42:50,499 --> 01:42:51,792
...every time.

1637
01:42:58,007 --> 01:43:01,052
And I can't look at myself in the mirror.

1638
01:43:01,636 --> 01:43:03,846
And then I see a monster.

1639
01:43:07,016 --> 01:43:08,893
Don't do this, Kevin.

1640
01:43:09,143 --> 01:43:11,312
Please take me home.

1641
01:43:11,479 --> 01:43:13,981
Please don't do this.

1642
01:43:14,565 --> 01:43:16,442
I'm not crazy.

1643
01:43:31,874 --> 01:43:34,377
Doesn't Diana look fabulous?

1644
01:43:42,885 --> 01:43:45,554
Alessandra, you look ravishing.

1645
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,058
Mrs. Skylar.

1646
01:43:55,731 --> 01:43:57,358
<i>We are here today...</i>

1647
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,652
<i>...to remember Eddie Barzoon.</i>

1648
01:43:59,735 --> 01:44:01,153
Isn't she lovely?

1649
01:44:01,278 --> 01:44:04,782
<i>We have gathered to seek shelter</i>
<i>in our common grief.</i>

1650
01:44:05,866 --> 01:44:08,285
<i>To draw strength toward our tested faith.</i>

1651
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:09,912
So what do they say?

1652
01:44:10,329 --> 01:44:11,747
How's Mary Ann?

1653
01:44:11,914 --> 01:44:13,249
They don't know.

1654
01:44:15,543 --> 01:44:17,044
She's falling apart.

1655
01:44:17,753 --> 01:44:19,088
Hallucinations.

1656
01:44:19,255 --> 01:44:20,381
Milton...

1657
01:44:22,383 --> 01:44:23,426
It's bad.

1658
01:44:26,554 --> 01:44:27,847
Do you have room for one more?

1659
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:29,265
<i>Beloved father.</i>

1660
01:44:29,432 --> 01:44:30,808
<i>Devoted husband.</i>

1661
01:44:31,225 --> 01:44:32,518
<i>Trusted friend.</i>

1662
01:44:32,601 --> 01:44:35,062
<i>Esteemed colleague. Benevolent citizen.</i>

1663
01:44:35,730 --> 01:44:37,231
<i>All of these things.</i>

1664
01:44:38,107 --> 01:44:40,234
<i>And yet one thing more:</i>

1665
01:44:41,068 --> 01:44:42,778
<i>Child of God.</i>

1666
01:44:43,612 --> 01:44:46,782
<i>And it is to that Father</i>
<i>that he now returns.</i>

1667
01:44:47,783 --> 01:44:49,410
Eddie Barzoon...

1668
01:44:49,577 --> 01:44:52,413
...such a vibrant member
of our community...

1669
01:44:53,122 --> 01:44:55,291
<i>...has moved beyond us now.</i>

1670
01:44:56,125 --> 01:44:57,752
<i>He has entered...</i>

1671
01:44:58,210 --> 01:44:59,670
<i>...a new communion.</i>

1672
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:03,049
<i>And for that it is a time of rejoicing.</i>

1673
01:45:04,634 --> 01:45:07,803
<i>God, who is our refuge and our strength.</i>

1674
01:45:08,971 --> 01:45:11,557
<i>God, who is that very present help...</i>

1675
01:45:11,974 --> 01:45:13,559
<i>...in time of trouble.</i>

1676
01:45:14,602 --> 01:45:16,979
<i>"Therefore we will not fear...</i>

1677
01:45:17,772 --> 01:45:19,732
<i>"...though the Earth should change...</i>

1678
01:45:19,815 --> 01:45:22,735
<i>"...though the mountains shake</i>
<i>in the heart of the sea...</i>

1679
01:45:22,818 --> 01:45:25,196
<i>"...though its waters roar and foam...</i>

1680
01:45:25,613 --> 01:45:28,532
<i>"...though the mountains tremble</i>
<i>with its tumult."</i>

1681
01:45:28,783 --> 01:45:30,576
<i>We cannot fear too long...</i>

1682
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:32,745
<i>...for Eddie Barzoon...</i>

1683
01:45:32,828 --> 01:45:34,288
<i>...has gone home.</i>

1684
01:45:53,683 --> 01:45:54,767
Mr. Lomax?

1685
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:57,186
No comment.
I'll have something for you later.

1686
01:45:57,269 --> 01:45:58,854
I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

1687
01:45:58,938 --> 01:46:01,399
You don't know me,
but Eddie mentioned your name.

1688
01:46:01,482 --> 01:46:03,401
Mitch Weaver, Justice Department?

1689
01:46:03,484 --> 01:46:04,735
Staking out the funeral?

1690
01:46:04,819 --> 01:46:06,612
Looking for you, actually.

1691
01:46:07,321 --> 01:46:09,240
I'm in a hurry. I need to talk to my wife.

1692
01:46:09,323 --> 01:46:13,703
Just wanted to ask you, off the record...
I have a few questions about Eddie.

1693
01:46:31,012 --> 01:46:33,597
Milton-Chadwick-Waters
is a little more than a law firm.

1694
01:46:33,681 --> 01:46:35,599
But I assumed you knew that.

1695
01:46:36,017 --> 01:46:38,602
Vagada Holdings?
I'm sure you've heard of it.

1696
01:46:38,686 --> 01:46:42,189
London, Kinshasa, Karachi:
arms brokering, mostly.

1697
01:46:42,356 --> 01:46:46,235
Munzer-Dietch, in Berlin, Djakarta:
chemical weapons and toxic waste.

1698
01:46:46,402 --> 01:46:49,613
Ivanco Limited, Moscow:
money laundering for the eastern bloc.

1699
01:46:49,697 --> 01:46:53,701
It goes on and on and on.
Milton is into everything.

1700
01:47:04,587 --> 01:47:08,257
Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.
He was going to testify.

1701
01:47:08,591 --> 01:47:10,593
DeSoto and Dibalista, Panama.

1702
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:13,804
That firm sets up bank accounts
for judges in South America.

1703
01:47:13,888 --> 01:47:16,307
Huge drug cases, murder, everything.

1704
01:47:16,432 --> 01:47:19,268
What the fuck do you want?
He's a lawyer!

1705
01:47:20,394 --> 01:47:22,271
Now stay off my back!

1706
01:47:26,192 --> 01:47:28,611
This is a first-time last-time offer.

1707
01:47:29,195 --> 01:47:30,863
I'm learning about you.

1708
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:33,949
I talked to some old friends
in Florida this morning.

1709
01:47:34,033 --> 01:47:35,201
The Gettys case?

1710
01:47:35,284 --> 01:47:37,119
Eighth grade teacher?

1711
01:47:39,205 --> 01:47:40,957
They found him yesterday!

1712
01:47:42,458 --> 01:47:46,003
He had the body of a 10-year-old girl
in the trunk of his car!

1713
01:48:05,815 --> 01:48:07,817
Is he all right? Get help!

1714
01:48:30,715 --> 01:48:33,175
Marie, do you want to go to the party?

1715
01:48:33,592 --> 01:48:34,635
Come on.

1716
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,095
Horace will be disappointed.

1717
01:48:36,178 --> 01:48:38,472
It's a birthday party. We can sing.

1718
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:40,683
"...indeed, His divine power...

1719
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:44,854
"...has granted us all things
pertaining to life and piety...

1720
01:48:45,021 --> 01:48:48,607
"...through the knowledge of Him
who has called us..."

1721
01:48:51,944 --> 01:48:53,654
What are you doing here?

1722
01:48:54,613 --> 01:48:56,365
I came this morning.

1723
01:48:57,783 --> 01:49:00,536
I kept calling the house
and getting no answer.

1724
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:02,538
I need to talk to you.

1725
01:49:02,705 --> 01:49:05,416
We got her on the first flight up
this morning.

1726
01:49:14,216 --> 01:49:15,968
Are you all right, Kevin?

1727
01:49:22,892 --> 01:49:24,101
I don't know.

1728
01:49:27,355 --> 01:49:30,149
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

1729
01:49:32,902 --> 01:49:34,737
How you doing, sweetie?

1730
01:49:35,988 --> 01:49:38,407
I know something
that'll make you feel better.

1731
01:49:38,491 --> 01:49:39,825
There.

1732
01:49:43,245 --> 01:49:45,790
I shouldn't have left. I knew it.

1733
01:49:47,291 --> 01:49:49,085
I'll never forgive myself.

1734
01:49:49,877 --> 01:49:53,673
- There's nothing you could've done.
- I could've told you the truth.

1735
01:49:55,257 --> 01:49:56,384
About what?

1736
01:49:57,134 --> 01:50:00,304
Baptist Endeavor Youth Crusade, 1966.

1737
01:50:01,097 --> 01:50:03,140
I was here in New York.

1738
01:50:04,016 --> 01:50:07,019
That night in the elevator,
you never let me answer.

1739
01:50:08,562 --> 01:50:09,647
What are you talking about?

1740
01:50:09,730 --> 01:50:12,775
I stayed here a week in the Tremont Hotel.

1741
01:50:13,943 --> 01:50:17,238
They had a restaurant downstairs
where we ate almost every meal.

1742
01:50:17,321 --> 01:50:18,447
Wait. Stop.

1743
01:50:18,531 --> 01:50:21,200
Your father was a waiter in that restaurant.

1744
01:50:23,244 --> 01:50:24,328
My father?

1745
01:50:28,332 --> 01:50:30,293
This is great, Ma.

1746
01:50:33,004 --> 01:50:34,088
Honey, please listen.

1747
01:50:34,171 --> 01:50:35,089
Now?

1748
01:50:35,298 --> 01:50:36,841
You do this now?

1749
01:50:37,174 --> 01:50:39,093
Your timing, it's superb.

1750
01:50:39,176 --> 01:50:42,138
You wait 30 years,
you fly up here, you pick today?

1751
01:50:43,514 --> 01:50:47,852
Obviously I'm not under enough pressure.
I don't have enough on my mind!

1752
01:50:50,187 --> 01:50:51,731
Listen to me!

1753
01:50:57,611 --> 01:51:01,699
"Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves!"

1754
01:51:07,705 --> 01:51:10,207
Don't you look beautiful now.

1755
01:51:14,337 --> 01:51:15,838
Take a look and see.

1756
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:18,841
It's all right, dear. Look.

1757
01:51:18,966 --> 01:51:19,884
No.

1758
01:51:20,051 --> 01:51:21,886
Go on, take a look.

1759
01:51:22,219 --> 01:51:24,555
See how beautiful you are?

1760
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,938
See?

1761
01:51:40,613 --> 01:51:41,864
What happened?

1762
01:51:41,947 --> 01:51:43,366
She attacked me.

1763
01:51:47,745 --> 01:51:49,038
Open the door.

1764
01:51:49,580 --> 01:51:51,248
Open the door, Mar.

1765
01:51:54,752 --> 01:51:56,379
Open the door!

1766
01:51:59,924 --> 01:52:01,050
It's okay.

1767
01:52:01,258 --> 01:52:02,551
Open the door!

1768
01:52:04,428 --> 01:52:05,888
Come on!

1769
01:52:06,263 --> 01:52:07,556
Open the door!

1770
01:52:10,851 --> 01:52:12,311
Open the door, Mar!

1771
01:52:12,895 --> 01:52:16,440
Oh, my God! Get somebody! Go! Go!
Mar, look at me!

1772
01:52:17,191 --> 01:52:18,776
Somebody! Help!

1773
01:52:21,404 --> 01:52:22,488
Get help!

1774
01:52:23,114 --> 01:52:24,532
Go!

1775
01:52:30,955 --> 01:52:32,081
Sweetheart!

1776
01:52:36,627 --> 01:52:37,795
Look at me!

1777
01:52:37,962 --> 01:52:39,213
I love you.

1778
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,934
What have you done?

1779
01:52:53,644 --> 01:52:55,980
We need a doctor in here!

1780
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,524
We need a doctor!

1781
01:53:00,443 --> 01:53:03,279
Please stay with me, Mar!

1782
01:53:04,655 --> 01:53:06,115
Stay with me, Mar!

1783
01:53:06,282 --> 01:53:08,326
Get Dr. Job in here now!

1784
01:53:08,659 --> 01:53:11,621
Sir, get away so that I can help her. Now!

1785
01:53:12,121 --> 01:53:13,831
Sir, off! Go!

1786
01:53:14,457 --> 01:53:15,916
Come on. Come on.

1787
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:19,837
- Help her.
- Out of the way.

1788
01:53:20,421 --> 01:53:23,257
Get Dr. Job, please! I'm losing her!

1789
01:53:39,023 --> 01:53:40,524
Finish the story.

1790
01:53:41,025 --> 01:53:43,611
1966. You were in New York.

1791
01:53:43,736 --> 01:53:45,946
There's a waiter in a restaurant.

1792
01:53:46,030 --> 01:53:47,406
Finish the story.

1793
01:53:51,035 --> 01:53:52,703
He talked to me.

1794
01:53:53,537 --> 01:53:56,332
Nobody'd ever really talked to me before.

1795
01:53:56,540 --> 01:54:01,212
Sixteen years old, a thousand miles away
from home, someone takes an interest...

1796
01:54:01,545 --> 01:54:04,882
Knew the Bible, every word.
Just knew it by heart.

1797
01:54:07,385 --> 01:54:10,471
Every meal, there he was
at my ear and I was...

1798
01:54:11,639 --> 01:54:15,226
That last night he came
to say good-bye and...

1799
01:54:17,478 --> 01:54:19,063
...I started crying.

1800
01:54:19,230 --> 01:54:21,232
And he told me:

1801
01:54:22,733 --> 01:54:26,404
"Behold, I send you out as sheep
amidst the wolves."

1802
01:54:26,904 --> 01:54:28,823
I want to hear you say it.

1803
01:54:31,575 --> 01:54:33,494
His face that night, I knew it was him.

1804
01:54:33,577 --> 01:54:34,412
Say it.

1805
01:54:34,495 --> 01:54:39,166
You were so proud you'd just come to
New York and done this all on your own.

1806
01:54:39,667 --> 01:54:44,297
I didn't have the heart to tell you.
You wondered yourself. The money...

1807
01:54:44,463 --> 01:54:47,425
...that apartment, the attention,
everything out of nowhere!

1808
01:54:47,508 --> 01:54:48,509
Say it!

1809
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:51,429
Milton, he's your...

1810
01:54:52,013 --> 01:54:53,139
...father.

1811
01:54:53,931 --> 01:54:55,516
He's your father.

1812
01:54:57,018 --> 01:54:58,769
Somehow he found us.

1813
01:54:58,936 --> 01:55:00,646
- He tracked you down.
- No.

1814
01:55:01,022 --> 01:55:01,856
He did.

1815
01:55:01,939 --> 01:55:03,941
He's always been there.

1816
01:55:05,276 --> 01:55:07,028
I know that now.

1817
01:55:08,362 --> 01:55:09,530
Watching.

1818
01:55:10,448 --> 01:55:11,449
Waiting.

1819
01:55:13,242 --> 01:55:15,202
Playing us like a game.

1820
01:55:15,578 --> 01:55:16,704
What do you mean?

1821
01:55:16,787 --> 01:55:18,164
I gotta go.

1822
01:55:19,457 --> 01:55:21,876
No, leave it alone. Stay here with me.

1823
01:55:21,959 --> 01:55:24,337
Forget about him. We can leave here.

1824
01:55:24,545 --> 01:55:27,214
We can go home.
We don't ever have to see him again.

1825
01:55:27,298 --> 01:55:28,549
I can't do it.

1826
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,594
You go home. You go home.

1827
01:55:32,303 --> 01:55:33,471
I have to go.

1828
01:55:33,554 --> 01:55:35,681
- I have to go.
- Wait!

1829
01:55:36,807 --> 01:55:37,933
I love you.

1830
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:49,487
There you are.

1831
01:55:50,363 --> 01:55:52,823
Look at you. You're terrified.

1832
01:55:53,074 --> 01:55:54,492
Not to worry.

1833
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:56,410
He'll take away that fear.

1834
01:55:56,494 --> 01:55:59,121
You don't ever have to be frightened again.

1835
01:55:59,372 --> 01:56:00,498
Go on.

1836
01:56:00,665 --> 01:56:02,249
He's waiting for you.

1837
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,001
Go.

1838
01:57:17,366 --> 01:57:19,118
<i>You were right about one thing.</i>

1839
01:57:19,201 --> 01:57:22,204
<i>I have been watching.</i>
<i>Couldn't help myself.</i>

1840
01:57:22,997 --> 01:57:24,040
<i>Watching.</i>

1841
01:57:24,832 --> 01:57:25,875
<i>Waiting.</i>

1842
01:57:26,876 --> 01:57:28,336
<i>Holding my breath.</i>

1843
01:57:28,878 --> 01:57:31,297
But I'm no puppeteer, Kevin.

1844
01:57:32,590 --> 01:57:34,759
I don't make things happen.

1845
01:57:35,092 --> 01:57:36,344
Doesn't work like that.

1846
01:57:36,427 --> 01:57:38,220
What'd you do to Mary Ann?

1847
01:57:38,304 --> 01:57:39,930
Free will.

1848
01:57:40,097 --> 01:57:42,183
It's like butterfly wings.

1849
01:57:42,308 --> 01:57:44,935
Once touched,
they never get off the ground.

1850
01:57:46,687 --> 01:57:49,106
I only set the stage.

1851
01:57:49,607 --> 01:57:50,941
You pull your own strings.

1852
01:57:51,025 --> 01:57:53,319
What did you do to Mary Ann?

1853
01:57:53,486 --> 01:57:54,945
A gun?

1854
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:56,280
In here?

1855
01:57:56,447 --> 01:57:59,075
Goddamn it, what did you do to my wife?

1856
01:58:00,493 --> 01:58:01,619
Well...

1857
01:58:03,454 --> 01:58:05,706
...on a scale of one to ten...

1858
01:58:05,957 --> 01:58:09,961
Ten being the most depraved act
of sexual theater known to man.

1859
01:58:10,127 --> 01:58:13,965
One being your average
Friday night run-through at the Lomaxes'.

1860
01:58:14,298 --> 01:58:16,384
I'd say, not to be immodest...

1861
01:58:16,509 --> 01:58:20,346
...Mary Ann and I got it on at about seven.

1862
01:58:20,513 --> 01:58:21,806
Fuck you!

1863
01:58:23,474 --> 01:58:25,059
Got me!

1864
01:58:25,142 --> 01:58:27,061
Got me! Yes!

1865
01:58:31,482 --> 01:58:34,151
Step it up, Son! Come on! That's good!

1866
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:36,654
You got to hold on to that fury!

1867
01:58:36,821 --> 01:58:38,280
That's the last thing to go!

1868
01:58:38,364 --> 01:58:42,952
That's the final hiding place.
It's the final fig leaf.

1869
01:58:43,828 --> 01:58:45,788
- Who are you?
- Who am I?

1870
01:58:46,664 --> 01:58:47,832
Who are you?

1871
01:58:49,292 --> 01:58:51,127
Never lost a case.

1872
01:58:52,753 --> 01:58:53,838
Why?

1873
01:58:54,380 --> 01:58:55,756
Why do you think?

1874
01:58:56,549 --> 01:58:58,884
Because you're so fucking good.

1875
01:58:59,343 --> 01:59:00,428
Yes.

1876
01:59:01,137 --> 01:59:02,138
But why?

1877
01:59:04,265 --> 01:59:06,017
Because you're my father?

1878
01:59:06,392 --> 01:59:08,769
I'm a little more than that, Kevin.

1879
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,481
Awfully hot in that courtroom, wasn't it?

1880
01:59:12,648 --> 01:59:15,026
"What's the game plan, Kevin?"

1881
01:59:16,193 --> 01:59:17,737
"It was a nice run, Kev.

1882
01:59:17,820 --> 01:59:19,780
"Had to close out some day.

1883
01:59:19,905 --> 01:59:21,991
"Nobody wins them all."

1884
01:59:23,784 --> 01:59:24,994
What are you?

1885
01:59:28,414 --> 01:59:30,666
I have so many names.

1886
01:59:32,501 --> 01:59:33,502
Satan.

1887
01:59:36,297 --> 01:59:37,590
Call me Dad.

1888
01:59:40,843 --> 01:59:42,470
Mary Ann, she knew it.

1889
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:46,724
She knew it. She knew it,
so you destroyed her.

1890
01:59:46,849 --> 01:59:49,352
You're blaming me for Mary Ann?

1891
01:59:49,852 --> 01:59:51,479
I hope you're kidding.

1892
01:59:51,812 --> 01:59:54,607
Mary Ann, you could have
saved her anytime you liked.

1893
01:59:54,690 --> 01:59:56,359
All she wanted was love.

1894
01:59:56,525 --> 01:59:58,527
Hey, you were too busy.

1895
01:59:58,694 --> 01:59:59,904
That's a lie.

1896
02:00:01,364 --> 02:00:05,451
Face it, you started looking to
better-deal her the minute you got here.

1897
02:00:05,743 --> 02:00:08,955
That's not true.
You don't know what we had!

1898
02:00:09,121 --> 02:00:10,456
I'm on your side!

1899
02:00:10,539 --> 02:00:11,916
You're a liar!

1900
02:00:13,876 --> 02:00:16,295
There's nothing out there for you!

1901
02:00:16,379 --> 02:00:19,215
Don't be such a fucking chump!

1902
02:00:19,715 --> 02:00:22,218
Stop deluding yourself!

1903
02:00:23,344 --> 02:00:25,638
I told you to take care of your wife!

1904
02:00:25,846 --> 02:00:27,098
What did I say?

1905
02:00:27,264 --> 02:00:30,726
"The world would understand."
Didn't I say that?

1906
02:00:30,893 --> 02:00:32,228
What did you do?

1907
02:00:33,229 --> 02:00:35,231
"You know what scares me, John?

1908
02:00:35,398 --> 02:00:39,568
"I leave the case, she gets better
and then I hate her for it."

1909
02:00:40,277 --> 02:00:41,737
Remember?

1910
02:00:42,655 --> 02:00:44,240
I know what you did.

1911
02:00:44,407 --> 02:00:45,658
You set me up.

1912
02:00:45,741 --> 02:00:48,077
Who told you to pull out
all the stops on Mr. Gettys?

1913
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:51,330
- Who made that choice?
- It's entrapment. You set me up.

1914
02:00:51,414 --> 02:00:54,250
And Moyez! The direction you took!

1915
02:00:54,417 --> 02:00:58,587
Popes, swamis, snake handlers,
all feeding at the same trough.

1916
02:00:58,754 --> 02:01:01,173
- Whose ideas were those?
- You played me!

1917
02:01:01,382 --> 02:01:02,925
It was a test! Your test!

1918
02:01:03,009 --> 02:01:06,095
And Cullen! Knowing he was guilty!

1919
02:01:06,929 --> 02:01:08,681
Seeing those pictures!

1920
02:01:08,764 --> 02:01:12,435
What did you do?
You put that lying bitch on the stand!

1921
02:01:12,601 --> 02:01:15,813
You brought me in. You put me there!
You made her lie!

1922
02:01:15,896 --> 02:01:17,815
I don't do that, Kevin!

1923
02:01:17,898 --> 02:01:20,609
That day on the subway,
what did I say to you?

1924
02:01:20,901 --> 02:01:22,903
What were my words to you?

1925
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:27,908
Maybe it was your time to lose.
You didn't think so.

1926
02:01:28,034 --> 02:01:30,119
Lose? I don't lose!

1927
02:01:30,453 --> 02:01:31,662
I win!

1928
02:01:31,912 --> 02:01:33,331
I win!

1929
02:01:33,497 --> 02:01:36,584
I'm a lawyer! That's my job!
That's what I do!

1930
02:01:38,794 --> 02:01:40,087
I rest my case.

1931
02:01:45,426 --> 02:01:46,969
Vanity...

1932
02:01:47,470 --> 02:01:50,097
...is definitely my favorite sin.

1933
02:01:51,557 --> 02:01:54,060
Kevin, it's so basic.

1934
02:01:54,310 --> 02:01:55,645
Self-love.

1935
02:01:55,811 --> 02:01:58,439
The all-natural opiate.

1936
02:01:59,482 --> 02:02:02,860
It's not that you didn't care
for Mary Ann, Kevin...

1937
02:02:03,944 --> 02:02:07,823
...it's just that you were
a little more involved with someone else.

1938
02:02:09,575 --> 02:02:11,202
Yourself.

1939
02:02:13,955 --> 02:02:15,206
You're right.

1940
02:02:15,581 --> 02:02:16,999
I did it all.

1941
02:02:17,667 --> 02:02:18,751
I let her go.

1942
02:02:18,834 --> 02:02:23,214
Don't be too hard on yourself, Kevin.
You wanted something more.

1943
02:02:23,381 --> 02:02:24,674
Believe me.

1944
02:02:25,841 --> 02:02:28,177
I left her behind and just kept going.

1945
02:02:28,344 --> 02:02:30,471
You can't keep punishing yourself.

1946
02:02:31,347 --> 02:02:34,183
It's awesome how far you've come.

1947
02:02:34,767 --> 02:02:36,602
I didn't make it easy.

1948
02:02:36,978 --> 02:02:38,187
Couldn't.

1949
02:02:39,021 --> 02:02:40,523
Not for you...

1950
02:02:43,484 --> 02:02:44,944
...or your sister.

1951
02:02:49,490 --> 02:02:51,492
Half-sister, to be exact.

1952
02:02:52,201 --> 02:02:53,703
Surprise.

1953
02:02:54,537 --> 02:02:56,205
Some scene, huh?

1954
02:03:00,001 --> 02:03:01,711
Don't let him scare you.

1955
02:03:02,712 --> 02:03:04,880
I've had so many children.

1956
02:03:05,381 --> 02:03:08,134
I've had so many disappointments.

1957
02:03:08,718 --> 02:03:10,761
Mistake after mistake.

1958
02:03:10,928 --> 02:03:12,513
And then there's you.

1959
02:03:12,638 --> 02:03:13,889
The two of you.

1960
02:03:17,059 --> 02:03:18,728
What do you want from me?

1961
02:03:18,811 --> 02:03:20,604
I want you to be yourself.

1962
02:03:20,896 --> 02:03:22,606
You know, I'll tell you, boy...

1963
02:03:22,690 --> 02:03:23,899
...guilt...

1964
02:03:24,066 --> 02:03:26,402
...it's like a bag of fucking bricks.

1965
02:03:26,485 --> 02:03:28,154
All you got to do...

1966
02:03:28,487 --> 02:03:30,072
...is set it down.

1967
02:03:33,326 --> 02:03:35,494
I know what you're going through.

1968
02:03:35,578 --> 02:03:36,912
I've been there.

1969
02:03:37,163 --> 02:03:38,998
Just come here. Come here.

1970
02:03:39,165 --> 02:03:40,666
Let it go.

1971
02:03:42,168 --> 02:03:43,878
I can't do that.

1972
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:50,551
Who are you carrying all those bricks for?

1973
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:52,637
God?

1974
02:03:52,803 --> 02:03:54,180
Is that it?

1975
02:03:54,347 --> 02:03:55,514
God?

1976
02:03:55,765 --> 02:03:57,016
I'll tell you...

1977
02:03:57,099 --> 02:04:00,561
...let me give you
a little inside information about God.

1978
02:04:01,103 --> 02:04:02,938
God likes to watch.

1979
02:04:03,105 --> 02:04:04,523
He's a prankster.

1980
02:04:04,607 --> 02:04:05,941
Think about it.

1981
02:04:06,275 --> 02:04:07,943
He gives man...

1982
02:04:08,110 --> 02:04:09,528
...instincts.

1983
02:04:10,363 --> 02:04:13,950
He gives you this extraordinary gift,
and then what does He do?

1984
02:04:14,116 --> 02:04:16,994
I swear, for his own amusement...

1985
02:04:17,119 --> 02:04:20,081
...his own private, cosmic...

1986
02:04:20,206 --> 02:04:21,540
...gag reel...

1987
02:04:22,333 --> 02:04:24,794
...He sets the rules in opposition.

1988
02:04:24,961 --> 02:04:26,462
It's the goof of all time.

1989
02:04:26,545 --> 02:04:28,881
Look, but don't touch.

1990
02:04:30,549 --> 02:04:32,885
Touch, but don't taste.

1991
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,973
Taste, but don't swallow.

1992
02:04:38,224 --> 02:04:42,144
And while you're jumping from one foot
to the next, what is He doing?

1993
02:04:42,311 --> 02:04:45,815
He's laughing his sick, fucking ass off!

1994
02:04:46,107 --> 02:04:47,608
He's a tightass!

1995
02:04:47,775 --> 02:04:50,069
He's a sadist!

1996
02:04:50,569 --> 02:04:53,239
He's an absentee landlord!

1997
02:04:53,406 --> 02:04:55,700
Worship that? Never!

1998
02:04:56,492 --> 02:04:59,662
"Better to reign in Hell
than serve in Heaven," is that it?

1999
02:04:59,745 --> 02:05:00,913
Why not?

2000
02:05:01,163 --> 02:05:05,835
I'm here on the ground with my nose in it
since the whole thing began!

2001
02:05:06,752 --> 02:05:11,257
I've nurtured every sensation
man has been inspired to have!

2002
02:05:11,507 --> 02:05:15,177
I cared about what he wanted
and I never judged him!

2003
02:05:15,303 --> 02:05:19,890
Why? Because I never rejected him,
in spite of all his imperfections!

2004
02:05:20,099 --> 02:05:22,184
I'm a fan of man!

2005
02:05:24,103 --> 02:05:25,521
I'm a humanist.

2006
02:05:25,855 --> 02:05:27,732
Maybe the last humanist.

2007
02:05:28,733 --> 02:05:30,776
Who, in their right mind...

2008
02:05:30,860 --> 02:05:33,195
...Kevin, could possibly deny...

2009
02:05:33,362 --> 02:05:36,198
...the 20th century was entirely mine?

2010
02:05:36,365 --> 02:05:38,826
All of it, Kevin!

2011
02:05:39,368 --> 02:05:40,745
All of it.

2012
02:05:41,370 --> 02:05:42,622
Mine.

2013
02:05:43,706 --> 02:05:45,374
I'm peaking, Kevin.

2014
02:05:46,250 --> 02:05:47,627
It's my time now.

2015
02:05:49,629 --> 02:05:50,921
It's our time.

2016
02:05:51,714 --> 02:05:53,257
Anybody want a drink?

2017
02:05:55,134 --> 02:05:56,719
I'm having a drink.

2018
02:06:00,056 --> 02:06:02,266
This is some pitch, all this.

2019
02:06:03,434 --> 02:06:05,186
You must need me pretty bad.

2020
02:06:05,269 --> 02:06:06,729
What do you want?

2021
02:06:08,105 --> 02:06:09,440
Eddie was right.

2022
02:06:10,733 --> 02:06:12,902
I want you to take over the firm.

2023
02:06:13,611 --> 02:06:14,695
You...

2024
02:06:15,863 --> 02:06:17,323
...and your sister.

2025
02:06:21,577 --> 02:06:23,454
- Is that it?
- No.

2026
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:27,583
She's ovulating...

2027
02:06:27,959 --> 02:06:29,210
...right now.

2028
02:06:30,419 --> 02:06:31,879
Your vanity...

2029
02:06:32,088 --> 02:06:34,590
...is justified, Kevin.

2030
02:06:35,925 --> 02:06:37,134
Your seed...

2031
02:06:37,301 --> 02:06:39,261
...is the key to a new future.

2032
02:06:39,929 --> 02:06:43,808
Your son is going to sit
at the head of all tables, my boy.

2033
02:06:44,433 --> 02:06:47,061
He's gonna set this whole thing free.

2034
02:06:48,437 --> 02:06:49,939
You want a child.

2035
02:06:50,314 --> 02:06:52,149
I want a family.

2036
02:06:53,275 --> 02:06:54,652
The Antichrist.

2037
02:06:59,323 --> 02:07:00,825
Whatever.

2038
02:07:05,329 --> 02:07:07,498
But I have to volunteer.

2039
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,793
Free will...

2040
02:07:11,335 --> 02:07:12,753
...it is a bitch.

2041
02:07:14,797 --> 02:07:16,632
I need a family.

2042
02:07:16,799 --> 02:07:18,843
I need help. I'm busy.

2043
02:07:19,010 --> 02:07:20,803
Millennium's coming, Son.

2044
02:07:20,970 --> 02:07:23,681
Title fight. Round 20.

2045
02:07:25,683 --> 02:07:27,685
I'm ready to work.

2046
02:07:29,353 --> 02:07:30,730
What do you say?

2047
02:07:31,689 --> 02:07:33,232
What're you offering?

2048
02:07:35,693 --> 02:07:37,194
Are we negotiating?

2049
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:38,446
Always.

2050
02:07:40,698 --> 02:07:42,158
Yes!

2051
02:07:43,659 --> 02:07:45,244
What are you offering?

2052
02:07:46,037 --> 02:07:47,330
Everything.

2053
02:07:47,496 --> 02:07:48,623
Anything.

2054
02:07:48,789 --> 02:07:51,250
What do you want?
How about bliss, for starters?

2055
02:07:51,334 --> 02:07:52,460
Instant bliss.

2056
02:07:52,543 --> 02:07:54,045
Bliss on tap.

2057
02:07:55,296 --> 02:07:57,715
Bliss any way you want it.

2058
02:08:00,343 --> 02:08:02,470
That first line of cocaine.

2059
02:08:03,012 --> 02:08:05,723
That walk into a strange girl's bedroom.

2060
02:08:07,516 --> 02:08:08,643
Familiar?

2061
02:08:10,061 --> 02:08:12,772
You're gonna have to do
a little better than that.

2062
02:08:12,855 --> 02:08:14,065
I know.

2063
02:08:14,857 --> 02:08:16,651
I'm just getting warmed up.

2064
02:08:17,026 --> 02:08:20,696
You want more, don't you?
You deserve more.

2065
02:08:20,863 --> 02:08:23,199
How about the thing you love the most?

2066
02:08:23,699 --> 02:08:25,409
A smile from a jury.

2067
02:08:25,743 --> 02:08:29,872
That cold courtroom
just giving itself over...

2068
02:08:31,040 --> 02:08:33,209
...bending to your strength.

2069
02:08:34,710 --> 02:08:36,295
I get that on my own.

2070
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:38,339
Not like this.

2071
02:08:38,506 --> 02:08:40,925
I take the bricks out of the briefcase.

2072
02:08:41,092 --> 02:08:42,593
I give you pleasure.

2073
02:08:43,719 --> 02:08:44,887
No strings!

2074
02:08:45,054 --> 02:08:46,430
Freedom, baby...

2075
02:08:46,764 --> 02:08:49,266
...is never having to say you're sorry.

2076
02:08:50,893 --> 02:08:52,770
This is revolution, Kevin.

2077
02:08:55,564 --> 02:08:56,732
<i>"It happened</i>

2078
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,402
<i>"In Monterrey</i>

2079
02:09:00,736 --> 02:09:02,571
<i>"A long time ago"</i>

2080
02:09:03,614 --> 02:09:05,241
Forget about him.

2081
02:09:05,950 --> 02:09:07,368
This is about us.

2082
02:09:08,744 --> 02:09:10,746
<i>"In old Mexico</i>

2083
02:09:12,623 --> 02:09:16,627
<i>"Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips</i>

2084
02:09:16,711 --> 02:09:18,421
<i>"As red as wine"</i>

2085
02:09:18,587 --> 02:09:21,215
It's been so hard for me to wait for you.

2086
02:09:22,466 --> 02:09:23,801
Why the law?

2087
02:09:25,052 --> 02:09:28,055
Cut the shit, Dad! Why lawyers?
Why the law?

2088
02:09:28,139 --> 02:09:31,976
Because the law, my boy,
puts us into everything.

2089
02:09:32,977 --> 02:09:37,398
It's the ultimate backstage pass.
It's the new priesthood, baby.

2090
02:09:37,982 --> 02:09:40,901
Did you know there are more students
in law school...

2091
02:09:40,985 --> 02:09:43,070
...than lawyers walking the Earth?

2092
02:09:43,154 --> 02:09:44,655
We're coming out...

2093
02:09:45,406 --> 02:09:47,074
...guns blazing!

2094
02:09:48,409 --> 02:09:50,161
The two of you...

2095
02:09:50,328 --> 02:09:54,332
...all of us,
acquittal after acquittal after acquittal...

2096
02:09:54,415 --> 02:09:58,169
...until the stench of it reaches
so high and far into Heaven...

2097
02:09:58,336 --> 02:10:01,756
...it chokes the whole fucking lot of them!

2098
02:10:03,841 --> 02:10:05,926
In the Bible, you lose.

2099
02:10:07,261 --> 02:10:09,263
We're destined to lose, Dad.

2100
02:10:09,388 --> 02:10:11,474
Consider the source, Son!

2101
02:10:13,184 --> 02:10:14,268
Besides...

2102
02:10:14,435 --> 02:10:16,354
...we'll write our own book.

2103
02:10:16,437 --> 02:10:18,272
Chapter one.

2104
02:10:19,190 --> 02:10:21,275
Right here. This altar.

2105
02:10:22,109 --> 02:10:23,527
This moment.

2106
02:10:24,111 --> 02:10:25,696
Will you stop talking?

2107
02:10:25,780 --> 02:10:27,198
You talk too much.

2108
02:10:27,782 --> 02:10:29,116
Both of you.

2109
02:10:32,370 --> 02:10:33,537
Look at me.

2110
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:36,457
Just look at me.

2111
02:10:46,384 --> 02:10:49,095
She is really stunning.

2112
02:10:55,309 --> 02:10:56,727
Who am I?

2113
02:11:16,747 --> 02:11:19,250
I've wanted you from the moment we met.

2114
02:11:28,843 --> 02:11:31,512
The virtue of the Devil is in his loins.

2115
02:11:35,349 --> 02:11:36,851
What about love?

2116
02:11:40,855 --> 02:11:41,981
Overrated.

2117
02:11:42,440 --> 02:11:43,399
Biochemically...

2118
02:11:43,482 --> 02:11:47,945
...no different than eating
large quantities of chocolate.

2119
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:53,367
In two minutes you won't be thinking
about Mary Ann ever again.

2120
02:11:53,618 --> 02:11:54,869
Come here.

2121
02:11:56,454 --> 02:11:58,581
She's right, my son.

2122
02:12:05,379 --> 02:12:09,133
It's time to step up and take what's yours.

2123
02:12:14,055 --> 02:12:15,306
You're right.

2124
02:12:17,725 --> 02:12:19,143
It's time.

2125
02:12:19,727 --> 02:12:21,479
Free will, right?

2126
02:12:26,692 --> 02:12:27,860
No!

2127
02:12:41,958 --> 02:12:43,459
Damn you!

2128
02:12:46,754 --> 02:12:48,756
Enough!

2129
02:12:50,675 --> 02:12:53,260
Haven't I given enough?

2130
02:13:57,241 --> 02:13:58,743
It was a nice run.

2131
02:13:58,993 --> 02:14:00,995
Had to close out someday.

2132
02:14:01,829 --> 02:14:03,414
Nobody wins them all.

2133
02:14:52,964 --> 02:14:55,049
What are you doing, baby?

2134
02:14:57,051 --> 02:14:58,427
Are you okay?

2135
02:15:01,472 --> 02:15:03,057
I am now.

2136
02:15:06,727 --> 02:15:08,312
All rise.

2137
02:15:08,729 --> 02:15:11,774
The Honorable Judge Garson Deeds
presiding.

2138
02:15:14,735 --> 02:15:16,237
Please be seated.

2139
02:15:20,324 --> 02:15:22,994
You're still under oath, young lady.

2140
02:15:26,122 --> 02:15:27,373
Your witness.

2141
02:15:39,260 --> 02:15:40,761
Mr. Lomax?

2142
02:15:45,433 --> 02:15:46,642
Your Honor...

2143
02:15:48,436 --> 02:15:50,479
...I'm terribly sorry.

2144
02:15:51,772 --> 02:15:54,275
But I can no longer represent my client.

2145
02:15:56,819 --> 02:15:59,071
I need to be replaced as counsel.

2146
02:15:59,155 --> 02:16:01,324
Order. Order! Order!

2147
02:16:02,325 --> 02:16:04,118
I adjourn this court.

2148
02:16:04,493 --> 02:16:08,080
This is outrageous. Are you aware
of the consequences of this action?

2149
02:16:08,164 --> 02:16:09,332
I am, sir.

2150
02:16:09,498 --> 02:16:13,127
I want to see both attorneys
in my chambers immediately.

2151
02:16:13,294 --> 02:16:17,089
I'm going to adjourn this trial
until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

2152
02:16:18,299 --> 02:16:20,009
I trusted you to defend me.

2153
02:16:20,092 --> 02:16:22,345
You swore you would! You'll burn for this!

2154
02:16:22,428 --> 02:16:25,139
You just made the biggest mistake
of your life!

2155
02:16:26,182 --> 02:16:28,184
Baby, what are you doing?

2156
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:33,022
The right thing.

2157
02:16:33,814 --> 02:16:35,524
I think the right thing.

2158
02:16:39,487 --> 02:16:40,529
Here they are.

2159
02:16:40,613 --> 02:16:42,615
- Are you gonna be disbarred?
- I don't know.

2160
02:16:42,698 --> 02:16:45,451
- How's it feel to lose your first case?
- No comment.

2161
02:16:45,534 --> 02:16:49,538
Ain't it better to talk to them all at once?
Press conference tomorrow?

2162
02:16:49,705 --> 02:16:53,084
He ain't going to talk to you now.
Eight o'clock tomorrow morning.

2163
02:16:53,167 --> 02:16:54,502
That's it.

2164
02:16:54,669 --> 02:16:56,420
This is the story you dreamed about.

2165
02:16:56,504 --> 02:16:59,048
- There is no story.
- Bullshit.

2166
02:16:59,215 --> 02:17:02,635
A lawyer with a crisis of conscience?
You gotta be kidding. It's huge!

2167
02:17:02,718 --> 02:17:05,554
They're going to disbar me.
Write about that.

2168
02:17:06,555 --> 02:17:08,724
Wait a second. Can they do that?

2169
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:10,434
Not when I get through with the story.

2170
02:17:10,518 --> 02:17:12,853
You got to give me an exclusive.

2171
02:17:13,020 --> 02:17:16,899
This is wire service. This is "60 Minutes."

2172
02:17:17,066 --> 02:17:20,528
This is a story that needs to be told.
It's you.

2173
02:17:20,861 --> 02:17:22,405
You're a star.

2174
02:17:26,242 --> 02:17:27,535
Baby.

2175
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:31,580
Call me in the morning.

2176
02:17:32,248 --> 02:17:34,875
You got it. First thing.

2177
02:17:44,593 --> 02:17:45,928
Vanity...

2178
02:17:46,387 --> 02:17:48,639
...definitely my favorite sin.

2179
02:19:06,550 --> 02:19:09,470
