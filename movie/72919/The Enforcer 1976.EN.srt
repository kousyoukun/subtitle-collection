1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,071
Where you headed, little lady?

2
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,188
Nowhere with you, numb nuts.
Buzz off!

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,910
See you Thursday, gorgeous!

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,310
It's a pretty day to hitchhike.

5
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,439
I've got a little VW
at Stinson Beach with a cracked block.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,477
You wouldn't be going
to Mill Valley, would you?

7
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,031
Aren't we going to Mill Valley?

8
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,319
Got a couple bottles of
ice-cold beer up there.

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,997
You son of a bitch.

10
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,758
Okay, pile in!

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,550
How long you been with
Western Gas and Electric?

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,031
I can't remember how long.
How long I been in this?

13
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,949
Turn in here.

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,716
Climb up this road here.

15
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,390
I'll be right with you.

16
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,189
Hang a left here, Harry,
there's a jam on Bay.

17
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,473
What's with the citizen?

18
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,551
- Police officer, what's the problem?
- Thank God! He's inside!

19
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,357
Come on, it's a heart attack!

20
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,192
Wait here.

21
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,710
Make some room! Move aside!

22
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,190
Move aside.
This is an emergency!

23
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,991
Please move over!

24
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,232
Please give us room.
He's a police officer.

25
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,517
- Where's the ambulance?
- He had a heart attack.

26
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,796
He's still breathing, though.

27
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,789
Come on, get up.

28
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,589
Get up!
Get up, get up!

29
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,873
I say!

30
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,355
- Party's over.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.

31
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,111
Why are you squawking?
You got the free meal.

32
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,477
But I always enjoy
the ride in the ambulance.

33
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,830
Get out of here.

34
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,916
Harry, it's an all-units.

35
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,279
Marvelous.

36
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,672
My old lady will kill me.

37
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,596
She's doing a novena tonight
and I said I'd be home for supper.

38
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,112
<i>Suspects are armed. </i>

39
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,390
<i>Code 33.</i>

40
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,189
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

41
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,429
What's going on?

42
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,319
Bastards held up that liquor store.

43
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,836
One of our guys stumbled in
and they shot him.

44
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,559
They have four hostages.

45
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,236
They'll shoot them
unless we give them a car.

46
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,674
What're you waiting on?

47
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,638
Lieutenant Brannigan.

48
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,155
He said to stall until he gets here.

49
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,556
- Don't let them kill me!
- We want the goddamn car right now!

50
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,316
Okay, but you get nothing
till I come and talk.

51
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,996
Lay your piece on that car's hood!

52
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,470
What about me? I'm your partner.

53
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,395
I move fast. I don't need
extra linguini holding me back.

54
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,710
You got a lot of class, Harry.

55
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,959
You get cute, I blow this nice lady
all over you. Let's go.

56
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,878
On the floor, motherfucker.

57
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,680
For God's sake, do like he says!

58
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,632
- This is my best jacket.
- Get on the floor, you son of a bitch!

59
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,996
Spreadeagle! Move it!

60
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,717
Get down there.

61
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,990
San Francisco's finest.

62
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,478
Mitch.

63
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,514
Roll him over.

64
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,119
He's clean.

65
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,318
Here's the story.

66
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,477
First, we want all the pigs
out of here.

67
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,873
Second, we want a car...

68
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,239
...with a police radio.
Deliver it right out there in front.

69
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,391
We're taking two hostages.

70
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,119
Both the women.

71
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,792
You don't do what I tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off.

72
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,831
- You got the picture?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,957
What are you waiting for?

74
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,434
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

75
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,074
- What do they want?
- They want a car.

76
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,432
What are you going to do?

77
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,953
Give them one.

78
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,752
You son of a bitch!

79
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,192
Why's a man crazy enough
to join the cops?

80
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,948
If you find out, you let me know.

81
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,114
$ 14,379.

82
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,113
- How's that?
- Want an itemized account?

83
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,069
You took out two doors,
one window, 12 feet of counter...

84
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,677
...plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

85
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,436
And three hostages in the hospital
who will probably sue the city.

86
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,716
- Why?
- Excessive use of force.

87
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,632
For your information, Callahan...

88
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,350
...the minority community
hates this kind of police work.

89
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,273
By "minority community"
you mean the hoods?

90
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,193
So happens they're
American citizens too.

91
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,228
- The lady with the gun by her ear?
- I'm not debating this.

92
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,915
I've spoken to the mayor twice!

93
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,390
He went through the ceiling!

94
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,278
You mention the meeting?

95
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,159
- What?
- The meeting two months ago...

96
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,358
...when you said priority was
to run the hoods out.

97
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,749
Not with violence!

98
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,116
Should I yell "trick-or-treat"?

99
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,349
Come on.

100
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,194
I expect you
and everyone on this force...

101
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,671
...to be restrained
or turn in his resignation.

102
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,912
You're on notice, Harry.

103
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,436
That wild west show of yours
is exactly what...

104
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,433
...this department's
not going to tolerate!

105
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,159
Is that clear?

106
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,509
Yes, sir.

107
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,316
- Lf that's all, I've work to do.
- Not in homicide.

108
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,034
What?

109
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,437
You're transferred to personnel.

110
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,959
To personnel? That's for assholes.

111
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,553
I was in personnel for ten years.

112
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,394
Yeah.

113
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,549
That's it!

114
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,509
Report tomorrow to the oral
examining board, 9:00!

115
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,035
No, you haven't got the picture.

116
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,672
I'm the robber, you're the cop.

117
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,273
Now, I'm in a market.

118
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,432
You've just caught me.
A 211 in the act.

119
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,557
I'm coming out with a hostage:

120
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,237
A kid with a gun at his head.
There's no way to take me alive.

121
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,835
You have ten seconds to decide.

122
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,229
What do you do?

123
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,390
One...

124
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,517
...two, three...
- You're under arrest.

125
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,035
...four, five...
- Do something!

126
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,599
...six, seven.

127
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,308
Don't just stand there,
goddamn it, do something!

128
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,152
Bang, you're dead.

129
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,630
- You're late, Callahan.
- Sorry.

130
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,472
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.

131
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,196
Okay, Bustanoby,
you'll be given your grade.

132
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,352
You were told 9:00.

133
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,875
We have 50 officers to test.

134
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,390
- For how many vacancies?
- Eight.

135
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,713
Five men and three women
promoted to inspector in this group.

136
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,520
- Three women?
- Do you object, inspector?

137
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,798
Now who might you be?

138
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,429
Ms. Grey, from the mayor's staff.

139
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,511
She's to monitor the exams.

140
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,514
- This is Inspector Callahan.
- Yes, I know something of him.

141
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,077
And I'd like to tell you...

142
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,154
...the mayor's plan is to bring
this department into...

143
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,710
...the mainstream of
twentieth-century thought.

144
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,238
How does he figure to do that?

145
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,119
For one thing...

146
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,032
...His Honor intends to...

147
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,068
...broaden participation
for women in the police force.

148
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,550
Well, that sounds very stylish.

149
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,912
He also said something about...

150
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,596
...winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.

151
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,398
Well, we better move along.
Next applicant.

152
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,876
- Officer Moore?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,839
This is the final stage
in the examination.

154
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,517
It's an informal test to measure
your ability to think on your feet.

155
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,149
Your reaction to stress, pressure.

156
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,319
Your ability to use the law
in a hypothetical situation.

157
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,239
Yes, sir.

158
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,472
How long on the force?

159
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,472
- Nine years.
- What department?

160
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,397
Mainly Personnel and Records.

161
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,595
- Personnel and Records.
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,719
Have you any questions
for the applicant?

163
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,317
Questions...
How fast do you run the hundred?

164
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,757
Come on, you know
how this board functions.

165
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,158
All right, I'm sorry.

166
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,677
You know...

167
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,036
...if you're inspector under
the new guidelines...

168
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,597
...you might be out
riding in a police car.

169
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,990
Yes, sir, that's what I hope for.

170
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,356
Officer Moore, tell us about...

171
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,830
...your greatest felony arrest.

172
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,596
I've never made a felony arrest.

173
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,669
Well, tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest.

174
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,632
I've never made a
misdemeanor arrest either.

175
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,394
What gives you the right
to be an inspector...

176
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,108
...when men have been
working 15 years!

177
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,352
Women stay home,
is that what you're saying?

178
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,437
You think it's an encounter group?

179
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,592
What will she do
if someone points a gun...

180
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,114
...and says, "Hit the deck"?!

181
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,397
You're trying to fail
this candidate, aren't you?

182
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,438
If she fails there,
she gets her ass blown off!

183
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,312
It's my ass!

184
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,036
And my hard luck.

185
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,076
Out there you'll have a partner.
You get blown away, he does too!

186
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,437
That's some price to pay
for being stylish!

187
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,908
Are you finished with the questioning?

188
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,831
Hypothetical situation, huh?

189
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,598
I'm standing on a corner
and Mrs. Grey propositions me...

190
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,912
...saying for $5.00
she'll put on a show...

191
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,869
...with a Shetland pony.
- Lf this is your idea of humor...

192
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,515
All right, what are you doing here?

193
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,430
Seeing if you know
what law's being broken...

194
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,750
...besides cruelty to animals.

195
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,520
That's a conspiracy,
title 7-182-1...

196
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,194
...of the California penal code.

197
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,396
Conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor...

198
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,235
...is a felony, and according to...
- Yes. Good answer.

199
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,790
Officer Moore,
you'll be given your grade.

200
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,229
After I get the guard's keys...

201
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,472
...we drive to the end,
warehouse 50-A. Lalo?

202
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,991
All right, now, that's...

203
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,994
...I drop you off at the small door
and go around...

204
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,471
...to the wharf side.
You open up the first big door.

205
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,349
I drive in and back up to
the compound on the right.

206
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,635
Karl and Tex?

207
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,678
Man, we grab
the M-16 automatic rifles.

208
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,955
Wanda?

209
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,195
Locate and take any explosives.

210
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,080
Dynamite, detonators, and plastics.

211
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,953
Right. Henry Lee?

212
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,034
I tote and load the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

213
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,229
Miki?

214
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,756
Locate the L.A.W. Rockets.
They'll be in the back.

215
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,595
It's the most important item.
You sure of the location?

216
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,911
I sweated there for five years!

217
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,991
They're there, I promise!

218
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,038
All right, you guys.

219
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,192
- This is for the people!
- Right on, for the people.

220
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,472
Jesus, spare me.

221
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,758
- What is it?
- Gas company.

222
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,309
- Why?
- Major gas leak in the area.

223
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,471
We'll check underground pipes.

224
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,280
Don't smoke until we say it's okay!

225
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,158
I won't, I won't.

226
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,952
It's seeping down in the earth.
This whole damn block could go!

227
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,953
- Got a phone I can use?
- Right this way.

228
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,068
Let's go.

229
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,112
Charlie left the gate open.

230
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,749
Better check it.

231
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,752
Tony, call backup.

232
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,592
- I'll check around.
- Frank, watch yourself.

233
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,473
L.A.W.S. Rocket.

234
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,037
- Beautiful!
- Yes.

235
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,792
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

236
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,673
You'll blow us out of here!
You all right?

237
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,516
Let us get these.

238
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,198
Freeze.

239
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,997
Hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

240
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,759
You back there.
Stand up so I can see you.

241
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,228
And drop that gun!

242
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,920
Put your hands over your head
and freeze!

243
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,551
- Now, wait a second.
- You shut up and listen.

244
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,032
You blink an eyelid
and I'll mail you home in a box!

245
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,157
All of you, against the fence!

246
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,239
Now!

247
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,913
You too, honey!

248
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:27,157
Oh, Jesus! Miki! Miki!

249
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,791
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

250
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,632
Baby, I'll get you out.
I'll get you home.

251
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,472
Bobby, help get her up.

252
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,393
- You'll get us caught.
- No, we'll make it.

253
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,710
- She's dead.
- She's not dead!

254
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,552
The hell she isn't!

255
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,917
Come on, it's over.

256
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,709
Bobby.

257
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,396
Get it on there.

258
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,959
Lalo, get up in there! Come on!

259
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,834
Halt, police! Halt, or I'll fire!

260
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,952
I'll get this son of a bitch!

261
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,635
Goddamn it!

262
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,318
He said it looked like
a regular company truck.

263
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,754
I'm asking the
Marin County sheriff.

264
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,629
Might tie in with the two bodies
found there last week.

265
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,029
Yes, sir.

266
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,153
How's DiGeorgio?

267
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,317
Well, Irene's with him now.

268
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,114
Is that some kind of answer?

269
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,029
He's been given the last rites.

270
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,157
- Get what you can.
- I will.

271
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,118
Listen, I'm sorry.

272
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,033
Hello, Harry.

273
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,158
He's been asking for you.

274
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,714
How is he?

275
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,792
He's in and out.

276
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,031
I'll smoke a cigarette.

277
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,358
It's a war, isn't it?

278
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,599
I guess I never really
understood that.

279
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,634
Harry.

280
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,193
Frank, what happened?

281
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,598
I had them, dead bang. And then I...

282
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,468
Sorry.

283
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,988
Frank?

284
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,715
Something you want to tell him?

285
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,234
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

286
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,351
...I seen him before.
- Where?

287
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,230
I just can't make the name.

288
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,595
Where do you know him from, Frank?

289
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,632
That homicide...

290
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,514
...young hooker...

291
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,398
...in the Fillmore area.

292
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,518
The summer of '71.

293
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,478
- What about it?
- He was one of the pimps questioned.

294
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,191
Liked him for it, Harry.

295
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,272
We liked him real good.

296
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,230
We liked everybody
north of Market on that one.

297
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,156
He had one of them cute,
little-boy names...

298
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,237
...Charlie something, or Bobby.

299
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,038
I'll check Records.
They'll have your notes.

300
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,951
Ten-to-one they blow it.

301
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,396
Not this time, Frank.

302
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,831
Maybe you better get some rest.

303
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,552
- Do you have to go just yet?
- Not if you don't want me to.

304
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,478
Thanks, Harry.

305
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,713
Get Irene.

306
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,796
- Talk to Records?
- Not yet. That was McKay.

307
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,797
We got a tape from the bastards.
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

308
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,437
Code Blue, Intensive Care.

309
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,874
30 minutes.

310
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,348
<i>One million dollars
or we blow things up. </i>

311
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,673
<i>People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
Remember Fessenheim. </i>

312
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,828
"Fessenheim"?

313
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,588
It's being checked.

314
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,991
People's Revolutionary Strike Force.
They on your list?

315
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,199
Nothing.

316
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,795
- Think it's legit?
- Probably not.

317
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,029
Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

318
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,950
What are you doing
about those records?

319
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,832
What do you mean?

320
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,514
I just talked to you about them!

321
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,311
Homicide! Fillmore District!
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

322
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,274
What do you mean, "written request"?

323
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,431
Well, who's got the keys?

324
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,519
I'm coming down there
in five minutes...

325
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,072
...you get those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

326
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,276
- You don't have to make threats.
- I'm gonna nail the guy...

327
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,080
...who carved DiGeorgio
on my own time!

328
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,514
That's unnecessary...

329
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,116
...you're back in Homicide
since 9, didn't you know?

330
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,671
I've been down in Records
looking up a homicide.

331
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,909
Any luck?

332
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,152
Well, I've got eleven names
of known pimps.

333
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,874
- I think our man's one of them.
- Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

334
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,028
Shall I tell you my instinct on this?

335
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,078
- Black Militants.
- No, it's all hookers.

336
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,788
The girl shot in the warehouse?
Miki Waleska.

337
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,473
A known prostitute.

338
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,315
What we've got is a
well-organized group of militants...

339
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,030
...with enough explosives to blow
San Francisco away...

340
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,272
...including L.A.W.S. Rockets.
- L.A.W.S. Rockets?

341
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,000
The Army's giving a demonstration
at the firing range...

342
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,958
...in exactly 35 minutes.

343
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,589
I'd like everybody
on the case there...

344
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,751
...to see what you're against.

345
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,436
I've already been checked out
on the L.A.W.S. Rocket.

346
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,999
Your partner hasn't.

347
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,475
My partner?

348
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,392
Shit!

349
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,791
You know Inspector Moore?

350
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,193
Inspector.

351
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,109
I'll see you at the firing range.

352
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,991
Inspector?

353
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,232
Inspector, I know you aren't
overjoyed by this assignment.

354
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,552
- You don't think I'm up to it, do you?
- Right.

355
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,475
All right...

356
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,837
...let's get one thing straight.
I'm a woman.

357
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,548
I consider that fact irrelevant...

358
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,475
...because I don't expect
any special consideration.

359
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,994
Marvelous.

360
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,678
The L.A.W.S. Rocket: For all purposes...

361
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,679
...a one-shot disposable bazooka.

362
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,755
A fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

363
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,833
...which fires a single projectile...

364
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,278
...designed to penetrate armor
three-quarters of an inch thick.

365
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,399
If you've all seen it,
I'll demonstrate how it works.

366
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,878
To fire the rocket, pull this pin...

367
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,997
...dropping the cover...

368
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,118
...then pull.

369
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,271
Front and rear sights spring up.

370
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,789
Got word from Pathology.

371
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:39,272
At noon they're posting the guard
that was killed. Check on it.

372
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,515
I'll be there.

373
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,599
- Captain?
- Go ahead.

374
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,636
Keep your eyes on that truck...

375
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,872
...I'll show how effective
this weapon can be.

376
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,793
Coming, inspector?

377
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,719
- Inspector?
- Yeah?

378
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,349
- 13.5 in my gym shorts.
- What?

379
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,677
My time in the hundred.
You asked me before.

380
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,229
- Think I was picking on you?
- Yes.

381
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,634
- It was nothing personal.
- Right.

382
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,519
I don't think you know
what Homicide does.

383
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,638
- I'll find out.
- I hope not the hard way.

384
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,518
How fast do you run the hundred?

385
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,352
Beats me.

386
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,440
I meant to say I'm sorry
about your partner.

387
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,238
He's not the first one.

388
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,712
Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

389
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,554
- How'd you know?
- Checked your records.

390
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,950
I don't want to get killed either.

391
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,315
What's the matter?

392
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,199
Black guy with the briefcase.
I know him.

393
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,953
- Tan suit?
- Yeah.

394
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,552
What did he do?

395
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,434
Can't remember. It's not important.

396
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,799
- Ever been to one of these before?
- No.

397
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,392
In that case, I'd suggest
you sit out here.

398
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,553
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

399
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,148
Hello, Harry.

400
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,072
Who's the pretty lady?

401
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,630
My partner, Inspector Moore.

402
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,351
- You missed most of it.
- We were at the firing range.

403
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,876
I have it on tape.
We finished the abdomen.

404
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,633
The wound matters.

405
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,872
The entry wound
was above the renal area...

406
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,277
...between ribs,
penetrating the chest cavity...

407
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,033
...piercing the lung.

408
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,192
There was also damage
to some other organs...

409
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,396
...pancreas, kidneys.

410
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,639
- What kind of knife?
- A long, heavy blade.

411
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,151
We're going in the skull now.

412
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,030
I'd say it was one of those
killing knives...

413
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,511
...a Marine Corps boy,
or Special Forces.

414
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,034
Bruises on the face?

415
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,716
The killer put his hand
over the mouth from behind.

416
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,951
- Professional?
- Textbook.

417
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,516
On first exam,
no exterior damage to the skull.

418
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,351
Subject brain shows no
contrecoup damage or clotting.

419
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,200
Jesus H. Christ, come look at this!

420
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,352
- It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- What?

421
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,353
It says "Eat at Luigi's!"

422
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,718
Welcome to Homicide.

423
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,676
What are you doing?

424
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,992
Excuse me, I'm with him.

425
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,758
I was coming down the hall
to take a leak when it blew!

426
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,758
Anybody in there?

427
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,035
- I don't think so.
- Where you going?

428
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,316
A group of kids, some are missing.

429
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,357
- Help him out.
- Me?

430
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,989
Great, just step out here, will you?

431
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,435
Well, we were lucky this time.

432
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,031
It's getting so you can't
even pee in peace.

433
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,875
- We got them, they're okay.
- Good.

434
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,795
You didn't...

435
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,112
...see anybody go in there, did you?
- No.

436
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,637
You sure? Black guy,
tan hat and suit, briefcase.

437
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,637
- I saw a guy like that.
- Short guy, about 5' 1 "?

438
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,632
No, this dude was six foot.

439
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,154
That's him.

440
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,631
It's a bomb. I saw who did it.

441
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,438
- Any idea?
- Looked familiar.

442
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,318
Just a minute.

443
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,671
You'd better check mug shots.

444
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,992
Honey, we're talking.
This is very important.

445
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,357
Better check mug shots,
we got another message.

446
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,192
They want two million.

447
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,475
- Two?
- I just saw him.

448
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,393
- Who?
- Tan suit, hat, and a briefcase.

449
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,310
- Where?
- Right down here.

450
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,553
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- Why the hell didn't you ask?

451
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,518
There he is, look!

452
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,789
Jesus!

453
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,109
Damn it.

454
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,036
What the hell's going on?

455
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,112
What are you doing here?

456
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,435
- Who are you?
- Police officer.

457
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,676
Speedy, you're under arrest.

458
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,593
God, this is a church!
What are you doing?

459
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,876
I'm a cop. He's under arrest.

460
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,157
Father, I did nothing!
This guy's rousting me!

461
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,198
Is it asking too much
to see a badge, officer?

462
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,868
He runs like a rabbit, I won't let go.

463
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,759
I'd like to see the badge now!

464
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,589
If you insist.

465
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,118
- Callahan, Inspector.
- Callahan...

466
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,908
...you're a disgrace to this city!

467
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,196
Okay! Nobody move!

468
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,988
Marvelous.

469
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,997
I think so.
Harry, wait, I'm talking to...

470
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,593
Jesus Christ!

471
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,355
Give him my best.

472
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:25,828
I'll call you back!

473
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,435
It's been disarmed
by the bomb squad.

474
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,036
It's the explosive from
the Hamilton Firearms works.

475
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,789
At times I can only
stand you as a human.

476
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,032
What about the punk?

477
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,635
- The suspect.
- "Suspect," my ass!

478
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,793
He won't talk, but we have a make.
He's Henry Lee Caldwell.

479
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,237
Member of a Black Militant group
called Uhuru.

480
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,395
- Pusseau, shelve that.
- Uhuru?

481
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,712
It's run by a guy called
Big Ed Mustapha.

482
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,872
Mustapha, in the Mission District.

483
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,953
I thought he was familiar.
Where's my partner?

484
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,111
She's in the can.

485
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,430
Been there since she found out...

486
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,036
...she was packing this thing
all over San Francisco!

487
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,555
Do me a favor. Go easy on her.

488
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,951
It's her first day
and it's been a long one.

489
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,597
She wants to play lumberjack,
she has to handle her end of the log.

490
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,232
I give up. What's this?

491
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,075
The Fillmore chapter of the V.F. W:
Very Few Whites.

492
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,195
Can I suggest you wait in the car,
inspector?

493
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,556
Don't concern yourself, inspector.

494
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,637
Well, if it ain't
Mighty Whitey and friend.

495
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,915
I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

496
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,835
Sorry, honky, she can stay,
but you got to go.

497
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,995
Yeah, baby, we trying to keep up
standards, understand.

498
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,879
- You aren't making us welcome.
- You're welcome!

499
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,918
As welcome as a turd in a pool!

500
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,714
Well, look here, if it ain't the fuzz.

501
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,473
I'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

502
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:34,918
- You got a warrant, honky?
- What I got is Henry Lee Caldwell.

503
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,959
I never heard of him.

504
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,193
Let's see how fast you fuzz
can get your white asses out.

505
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,792
What is Henry Lee into now?

506
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,552
He's playing with dynamite.
You Mustapha?

507
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,832
Yeah, that's right.

508
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,029
Just come into my office here.

509
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,789
Just you.

510
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,638
Don't worry, pig,
she won't get lonesome.

511
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,631
That's mighty white of you.

512
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,040
Before we do anything uncalled-for...

513
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,511
...I'd like to point out
that I'm an officer.

514
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,753
Callahan.

515
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,912
Where do I know you from?

516
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,549
You don't.

517
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,673
I just know you.

518
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,350
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

519
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,153
Saying you don't know?

520
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,915
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

521
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,639
Where is he?

522
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,070
He went white.
Why, he do something else foolish?

523
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,959
He and his friends helped
rip off the Hamilton Firearms.

524
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,832
I heard about that.

525
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,432
You wanna buy into that?

526
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,830
Four counts of murder,
aiding and abetting?

527
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:16,232
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

528
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,835
- What do you deal in?
- Waiting.

529
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,949
For what?

530
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,068
Waiting for all you honkies...

531
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,710
...to blow each other up
so we can move on in.

532
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,275
Talk about Henry Lee
and his friends.

533
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,473
Some dudes he met in Vietnam. Why?

534
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,354
Anybody on this list here grab you?

535
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,633
Hey, man, why should I help you?

536
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,149
I can talk to Robbery.
They'd be interested in this...

537
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,192
...elaborate furnishing.

538
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:55,078
What are you talking about?

539
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,837
"Room 401, Fairmont. "

540
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,352
"Rest at the Holiday Inn. "

541
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,912
Okay, okay, okay, so?

542
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,517
Maybe they're a little warm.

543
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,359
I tell you what...

544
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,191
...one of my boys got busted
on possession.

545
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,069
You get him off, and ignore
my interior decorator...

546
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,391
...and I'll see what I can do.

547
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,393
- That's a lot.
- You want a lot.

548
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,157
A thing like this can ruin my image.

549
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,913
I'll see what I can do.

550
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,558
What about the list?

551
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,593
Bobby Maxwell.

552
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,758
- He's the main man.
- You know him?

553
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,156
Stone waste of white.

554
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,197
Where can I find him?

555
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,198
I'll check around.

556
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,677
You do that. Much obliged.

557
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,390
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

558
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,471
How do you figure that?

559
00:51:08,921 --> 00:51:10,718
You put your ass on the line...

560
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:14,590
...for dudes who wouldn't
let you in the door any more...

561
00:51:15,641 --> 00:51:16,915
...than they would me.

562
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:19,636
- It's not for them.
- Who, then?

563
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:25,476
You wouldn't believe me if I told.

564
00:51:29,281 --> 00:51:32,637
...if I pull this piece...
- Having fun, inspector?

565
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,998
If you're done socializing,
we have work to do.

566
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:39,320
Son of a bitch.

567
00:51:41,801 --> 00:51:45,271
If you have an objection
to how I handled myself...

568
00:51:45,521 --> 00:51:47,113
...I wish you'd say so!

569
00:51:47,881 --> 00:51:49,837
I thought I was doing all right.

570
00:51:56,601 --> 00:51:57,875
Marvelous.

571
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:51,471
All right, Mustapha...

572
00:52:52,321 --> 00:52:55,836
...this is Captain McKay
of the S.F.P.D.

573
00:52:57,081 --> 00:53:01,074
Throw down your weapons
and come out peacefully.

574
00:53:07,681 --> 00:53:09,672
You are totally surrounded.

575
00:53:10,641 --> 00:53:12,359
Mustapha, do you hear me?

576
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:17,076
Come out with your hands raised
over your head.

577
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,997
I don't want to seem ungrateful...

578
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:53,596
...I just feel that
it might be better.

579
00:53:53,841 --> 00:53:56,401
Well, I'm still a little confused...

580
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,630
...you and the S.W.A.T. Team
did it...

581
00:53:59,881 --> 00:54:02,839
...but credit goes to
Moore and Callahan?

582
00:54:03,081 --> 00:54:05,595
I felt it might be a better tactic...

583
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:08,799
...politically, with
the election coming up...

584
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:12,875
...to show the guidelines for
the police department worked.

585
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:16,272
Kind of "I told you so,"
if you know what I mean.

586
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:20,719
Yes, I see. It's an excellent idea.
What do you think, Jimmy?

587
00:54:21,401 --> 00:54:23,357
I couldn't agree more.

588
00:54:24,601 --> 00:54:26,831
You have proved to be an asset...

589
00:54:27,081 --> 00:54:29,470
...to the force and
the administration.

590
00:54:29,721 --> 00:54:30,597
Thank you.

591
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:34,550
The commendation presentation
starts in five minutes.

592
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:37,474
- We better get going.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

593
00:54:37,721 --> 00:54:40,440
Off the record,
there will be changes...

594
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:44,879
...after the election,
and you'll figure greatly in my plans.

595
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:48,113
I'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

596
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:55,069
Can you comment on the
arrest of the Black Militants?

597
00:54:55,521 --> 00:54:57,318
Later, Jim, later.

598
00:54:58,361 --> 00:55:02,354
As mayor of San Francisco,
I want to make it official.

599
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:06,595
This is one hell of a cop!
And here come a couple more.

600
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,399
Hello. Right this way.

601
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,713
Lt. Bressler, Inspector Moore,
move to the stairs.

602
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:13,952
Mayor, would you join them?

603
00:55:14,201 --> 00:55:16,795
We'll have some photographs taken.

604
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:22,553
- Is this all right?
- Yes.

605
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:25,269
Would you move in a little tighter?

606
00:55:26,841 --> 00:55:30,436
Gentlemen, the inspectors who made
the Mustapha arrest.

607
00:55:30,681 --> 00:55:33,514
This is Inspector Moore and Callahan.

608
00:55:34,601 --> 00:55:38,037
How about one with
the mayor and Inspector Moore?

609
00:55:38,521 --> 00:55:41,831
Captain McKay, switch places
with Inspector Moore?

610
00:55:43,721 --> 00:55:44,995
Move in close.

611
00:55:45,241 --> 00:55:47,709
Callahan, you get in there too.

612
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:49,750
We're ready.

613
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:53,437
Inspector Moore is one of
the first of her sex...

614
00:55:53,681 --> 00:55:56,354
...to become a homicide investigator.

615
00:55:56,601 --> 00:56:00,389
We're very proud of her
stunning professionalism.

616
00:56:01,761 --> 00:56:03,638
Thank you very much.

617
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:07,676
Jimmy, give me time with these people.

618
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:10,560
Certainly. Can we move to the right?

619
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,917
I'll see you at the conference.

620
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:16,914
Anybody have the
letters of commendation?

621
00:56:17,721 --> 00:56:19,234
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir?

622
00:56:19,481 --> 00:56:21,870
- Who's got the letters?
- Right here.

623
00:56:22,961 --> 00:56:25,839
- Wait, what's this?
- Some form letters.

624
00:56:26,321 --> 00:56:29,233
So you hand them
something for the cameras.

625
00:56:29,481 --> 00:56:30,630
Well, all right.

626
00:56:30,881 --> 00:56:32,280
Thank you, Jimmy.

627
00:56:32,521 --> 00:56:36,833
The Mayor will introduce you,
hand you the letters...

628
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:39,641
...and then move
to the left off-camera.

629
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:41,872
I'll take this opportunity...

630
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:44,396
...to deliver a boot in the rear...

631
00:56:44,641 --> 00:56:48,077
...to the people who think
the force has failed...

632
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,039
...under this administration.

633
00:56:50,561 --> 00:56:51,960
Two minutes, Mr. Mayor.

634
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:53,873
Well, ready? Let's go.

635
00:56:57,201 --> 00:56:59,761
- Just one minute, Mr. Mayor.
- Harry!

636
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:02,879
Can you tell me what these are for?

637
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:05,476
- Wait until after the broadcast.
- No.

638
00:57:05,721 --> 00:57:07,598
All right, just watch it.

639
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,754
He has a right to know
what he's being commended for.

640
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:17,350
Specifically, it's for your part in
smashing the group of terrorists...

641
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:22,038
...who were trying to blackmail
the city out of two million dollars.

642
00:57:22,281 --> 00:57:23,430
Let's look at...

643
00:57:23,681 --> 00:57:26,753
If you mean Mustapha,
nobody smashed a thing.

644
00:57:27,681 --> 00:57:30,673
I made a deal with Mustapha
to help me find them.

645
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:34,038
- Moore and I weren't there.
- What's he mean?

646
00:57:34,281 --> 00:57:38,479
- No weapons or explosives were found?
- We'll find them!

647
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,713
They're still out there!
They'll blow the city!

648
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:43,917
You're saying how great we are.

649
00:57:44,161 --> 00:57:45,913
Callahan, button your lip!

650
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:49,358
Don't jerk them off with me!

651
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:53,514
- You got yourself a 60-day suspension!
- Make it 90!

652
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,717
180! Give me your star!

653
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:00,920
Here's a seven-point suppository,
captain.

654
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:05,075
- What did you say?
- I said stick it in your ass.

655
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:20,911
- Mayor, you're on.
- I know, Jimmy, I know.

656
00:58:25,561 --> 00:58:27,597
I'll have to go down there...

657
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:32,912
Go down there and jerk them off.

658
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:38,796
Inspector!

659
00:58:40,441 --> 00:58:42,113
Inspector Callahan!

660
00:58:45,441 --> 00:58:47,716
Damn it, Harry, slow down!

661
00:58:52,681 --> 00:58:54,000
What's the matter?

662
00:58:54,361 --> 00:58:55,430
Nothing!

663
00:58:55,681 --> 00:58:58,593
Why aren't you getting
your commendation?

664
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:02,159
- Do you ever give up?
- Sometimes.

665
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:04,519
Not you.

666
00:59:05,201 --> 00:59:07,112
What makes you think so?

667
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:09,512
Woman's intuition.

668
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:18,317
If you need anything or
if there's anything I can do...

669
00:59:19,041 --> 00:59:21,157
...access to records or files...

670
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:24,319
...anything. Call me up.

671
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:26,953
I might just do that.

672
00:59:27,201 --> 00:59:28,600
Fine.

673
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:32,716
Any time.

674
00:59:33,601 --> 00:59:37,037
- Come on, take a walk.
- All right.

675
00:59:43,921 --> 00:59:47,231
I wonder if I'll still have a job
when I get back.

676
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:49,312
What's the difference?

677
00:59:50,681 --> 00:59:52,956
Why'd you want to be a cop, anyway?

678
00:59:53,641 --> 00:59:56,553
Why don't you marry and have kids?

679
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,154
Why aren't you?

680
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:01,920
Nobody in their right mind's asking.

681
01:00:03,841 --> 01:00:06,992
- Coitus interruptus.
- I beg your pardon?

682
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:10,916
Coit Tower.
It's vaguely phallic, don't you think?

683
01:00:13,001 --> 01:00:15,117
Never thought of it that way.

684
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:17,958
I make up names for things.

685
01:00:18,201 --> 01:00:22,877
You're "Cold, Bold Callahan"
with a great big. 44.

686
01:00:25,441 --> 01:00:29,070
Every other cop is satisfied
with a. 38 or a. 357...

687
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,789
...why must you carry that cannon?

688
01:00:32,321 --> 01:00:34,516
So I can hit what I aim at.

689
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:37,912
.357 is good, but I've seen 38s
careen off windshields.

690
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:39,793
No good in the city.

691
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:44,034
I see. So it's for the penetration.

692
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:48,718
Does everything have
a sexual connotation?

693
01:00:49,961 --> 01:00:51,952
Only sometimes.

694
01:00:52,921 --> 01:00:55,310
Want to go have a few beers?

695
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:04,917
You got a lot of nerve the way
you talk to the mayor, and McKay.

696
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:07,712
They're wrong and stupid.

697
01:01:08,201 --> 01:01:12,240
They got the wrong guy,
but their egos won't admit it.

698
01:01:12,441 --> 01:01:15,114
- You mean Mustapha.
- Yeah.

699
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:17,677
I had a deal with Mustapha.

700
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:21,914
He put me onto Bobby Maxwell,
the guy who knifed DiGeorgio.

701
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:27,115
- Where do we find Maxwell?
- We can't with Mustapha busted.

702
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:30,119
Maxwell's a prime candidate,
a tough cookie.

703
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:32,158
Was in Vietnam, likes combat.

704
01:01:32,401 --> 01:01:35,199
He was busted out on a Section Eight.

705
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,319
We're good people.
Let's post Mustapha's bail.

706
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:39,960
Not a bad idea.

707
01:01:40,641 --> 01:01:43,360
Question is, will he work with us now?

708
01:01:45,521 --> 01:01:47,751
Want to have a few beers?

709
01:01:48,961 --> 01:01:50,838
Why didn't I think of that?

710
01:01:57,601 --> 01:01:59,478
All they had was apple juice.

711
01:01:59,721 --> 01:02:01,393
- Anything's okay.
- Here.

712
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:03,120
I'm sorry.

713
01:02:04,761 --> 01:02:06,353
You like fishing?

714
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:10,398
I have an Auntie Kate.
I'm called after her.

715
01:02:11,121 --> 01:02:14,716
When I was a little girl,
she had a ranch in Oroville.

716
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:19,315
We used to fish.
I'd even bait my own hooks.

717
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,636
Is that what they call you? Kate?

718
01:02:23,601 --> 01:02:25,512
That or Inspector Moore.

719
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:31,276
Inspector Moore, I don't
get friendly with partners.

720
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:34,638
I know. I mean, I understand.

721
01:02:34,841 --> 01:02:36,513
Kate...

722
01:02:37,281 --> 01:02:41,115
...whoever gets you as
a partner could do much worse.

723
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:10,518
I think if we want to beat
the crowds, we should leave.

724
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:14,231
Think so? You may be right.

725
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:16,199
I'll see you, Karl.

726
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:17,999
No need to come with us.

727
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:20,516
- Take over.
- Take it easy.

728
01:03:20,721 --> 01:03:22,313
You hold on to this.

729
01:03:25,801 --> 01:03:29,714
- Nice to see you!
- We're running late, sir.

730
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:50,077
All right, talk to me.

731
01:03:50,321 --> 01:03:52,118
- He's on his way.
- Beautiful.

732
01:03:52,761 --> 01:03:55,036
- Everything set?
- I'm ready.

733
01:04:42,281 --> 01:04:43,350
Hi there.

734
01:04:43,641 --> 01:04:47,077
Hello there, young lady.
What can I do for you?

735
01:04:47,681 --> 01:04:49,512
Raise the bridge.

736
01:04:50,881 --> 01:04:52,678
Raise the bridge?

737
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:54,800
Are you kidding?

738
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:56,880
When I tell you to.

739
01:05:04,761 --> 01:05:06,479
I wish we could've stayed.

740
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:10,236
I think the Giants will finally win.

741
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,679
I don't know, mayor, looked like
it would end a no-hitter.

742
01:05:15,241 --> 01:05:17,596
You have the testimonial tonight.

743
01:05:17,841 --> 01:05:23,040
Oh, God, testimonials.
They never end, do they?

744
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,118
Give me the Taser gun.

745
01:05:28,321 --> 01:05:29,674
Karl?

746
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:39,399
This looks like something from
James Bond.

747
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:41,074
Sure it'll work?

748
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:44,714
Karl, there's 25,000 volts
in this thing.

749
01:05:44,961 --> 01:05:49,079
Even the fat boy will do
what we want once we zap him.

750
01:05:56,961 --> 01:05:58,394
Okay, Tex.

751
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:09,553
Raise it.

752
01:06:34,761 --> 01:06:36,911
What the hell? Get me out of this.

753
01:06:43,081 --> 01:06:45,037
Don't hit the mayor, damn it!

754
01:07:06,841 --> 01:07:10,277
- Who are you? What do you want?
- You.

755
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:14,311
Son of a bitch!
I'm not going anywhere with you!

756
01:07:14,561 --> 01:07:16,199
The hell you aren't!

757
01:08:14,161 --> 01:08:18,234
We're trying to get details,
and as they come in you'll get them.

758
01:08:18,481 --> 01:08:20,472
<i>They said the mayor was killed. </i>

759
01:08:20,681 --> 01:08:23,479
At first. Then we heard
he was kidnapped.

760
01:08:23,681 --> 01:08:26,320
There's something going on
in China Basin.

761
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:29,236
I've got to go. Thanks for calling.

762
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,153
You're rapping with Bubba.

763
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:34,235
The mayor has been taken
prisoner of war...

764
01:08:34,481 --> 01:08:37,473
...by the People's
Revolutionary Strike Force.

765
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:42,477
Everybody's a comedian.
Look, this is serious!

766
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:47,392
I'm leaving a tape of our demands
in the phone booth across the street.

767
01:08:47,641 --> 01:08:49,950
<i>Power to the people!</i>

768
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:54,476
We'll do a little music and
I'll be right back!

769
01:09:13,081 --> 01:09:14,196
Harry?

770
01:09:15,881 --> 01:09:18,714
- What can I do for you?
- We've got to talk.

771
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:20,514
Go right ahead.

772
01:09:22,161 --> 01:09:25,915
I want all the info that
you have on this case.

773
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:30,677
- Black Militants, remember?
- Come on, so we were wrong.

774
01:09:31,761 --> 01:09:35,470
- I'll handle this one.
- No! We play as a team.

775
01:09:36,841 --> 01:09:40,914
The last time we did that
I got the cue stuck in my ass.

776
01:09:41,161 --> 01:09:44,710
We just got a tape.
Now they want five million.

777
01:09:44,961 --> 01:09:47,600
Or they send back the mayor in pieces.

778
01:09:47,841 --> 01:09:50,071
The negotiations are crucial now.

779
01:09:50,281 --> 01:09:52,875
What will you do, pay the bastards?

780
01:09:53,361 --> 01:09:58,276
The mayor's family is loaded,
they can afford it.

781
01:09:58,921 --> 01:10:02,231
What about those who were killed?
Isn't that illegal?

782
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:05,234
We're not debating the point.

783
01:10:05,481 --> 01:10:06,630
You're saying...

784
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:10,999
...anyone with the balls to take
hostages can walk away?

785
01:10:11,521 --> 01:10:13,079
I'm saying you're out.

786
01:10:13,321 --> 01:10:17,075
If I hear otherwise,
you're finished as a cop here.

787
01:10:17,321 --> 01:10:22,475
I want all the information
you have on this case, every lead.

788
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:25,276
- May I speak, McKay?
- Go ahead!

789
01:10:25,561 --> 01:10:28,075
Your mouthwash ain't making it!

790
01:10:40,001 --> 01:10:41,673
Callahan...

791
01:10:45,281 --> 01:10:47,636
...you got more surprises for me?

792
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:49,839
What do you mean?

793
01:10:50,161 --> 01:10:52,516
Are you and McKay throwing another...

794
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:55,912
...paddy-wagon party for me?

795
01:10:57,121 --> 01:10:59,919
Frigging McKay.
He's something, isn't he?

796
01:11:00,801 --> 01:11:04,032
I want a line on this
Revolutionary Strike Force.

797
01:11:05,321 --> 01:11:08,836
- You gots to be kidding!
- No, I'm not kidding.

798
01:11:09,081 --> 01:11:11,720
If you don't,
I'll say you're an ear.

799
01:11:11,961 --> 01:11:15,271
Hey, don't say that, not even joking.

800
01:11:18,561 --> 01:11:20,279
Who's joking?

801
01:11:21,561 --> 01:11:25,474
You really are a dirty bastard,
ain't you, Harry?

802
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:26,875
The dirtiest.

803
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:34,275
Word has it that Bobby Maxwell...

804
01:11:35,121 --> 01:11:36,440
...and his chick Wanda...

805
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:39,475
...they're running around
calling themselves...

806
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:42,997
...the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force.

807
01:11:43,241 --> 01:11:47,029
- "Calling themselves"?
- They don't believe in that shit...

808
01:11:47,481 --> 01:11:51,110
...they're into the bread,
that's how they think.

809
01:11:51,521 --> 01:11:53,477
Where do I find this Wanda?

810
01:11:53,721 --> 01:11:58,158
She's a tall brunette, works at
Tiffany's on Broadway.

811
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:01,915
Thanks.

812
01:12:02,521 --> 01:12:03,749
Callahan.

813
01:12:06,361 --> 01:12:07,999
Do them in.

814
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,997
You can count on that.

815
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:41,150
Hi there!

816
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:43,869
- Is this Tiffany's?
- Like the sign says.

817
01:12:44,121 --> 01:12:45,520
I'm Larry Dickman...

818
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:48,355
...my brother was here,
tall, balding?

819
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:49,710
Remember him well!

820
01:12:49,921 --> 01:12:53,197
- Has a gold tooth in front?
- That's him.

821
01:12:55,281 --> 01:12:57,511
You know what I bet you'd like?

822
01:12:57,841 --> 01:13:00,435
I bet you want to learn
the love tussle.

823
01:13:00,921 --> 01:13:04,436
That sounds swell,
but I'm looking for a certain girl.

824
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:06,876
We have many, warm and willing.

825
01:13:07,121 --> 01:13:09,077
- Her name's Wanda.
- Anybody you want.

826
01:13:09,321 --> 01:13:11,391
My brother says she's terrific.

827
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:12,630
Can I trust you?

828
01:13:12,881 --> 01:13:13,757
Yeah.

829
01:13:14,001 --> 01:13:16,196
What it is, is $ 75.

830
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:20,320
- $ 75?
- Of course, that includes...

831
01:13:22,041 --> 01:13:25,636
We shouldn't do this,
because the heat's on.

832
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:27,917
Seeing your brother was here...

833
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:32,392
...the $ 75 includes
personal instructions...

834
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:35,439
...in 32 positions of lovemaking!

835
01:13:35,961 --> 01:13:37,314
That many?

836
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,754
$ 75, you pay me first.

837
01:13:42,841 --> 01:13:44,274
Oh, yeah.

838
01:13:50,961 --> 01:13:52,440
Right this way.

839
01:14:02,641 --> 01:14:03,630
What's this?

840
01:14:03,881 --> 01:14:07,157
You've seen dummies.
It's the same principle.

841
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:11,551
For $ 75 you get to make it
with a rubber dolly.

842
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:13,234
Thirty-two ways!

843
01:14:13,441 --> 01:14:14,430
Any objections?

844
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:17,832
Is there one where
the man gets on top?

845
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,474
That's 33!

846
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:23,276
Take your duds off.
I'll send the teacher in.

847
01:14:27,801 --> 01:14:30,361
- Hi there.
- You're not Wanda.

848
01:14:30,601 --> 01:14:33,274
These are the breaks. Needs air.

849
01:14:33,681 --> 01:14:36,149
Can't hump a limp dummy, I say.

850
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:41,594
Speaking of limp dummies, strip.

851
01:14:41,841 --> 01:14:42,830
Where's Wanda?

852
01:14:43,081 --> 01:14:45,879
Beats the hell out of me, Tom.

853
01:14:51,601 --> 01:14:53,671
I'll ask you just one last time.

854
01:14:53,921 --> 01:14:56,799
- Where's Wanda?
- I don't know, I don't know.

855
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:59,271
She left a couple weeks ago.

856
01:14:59,521 --> 01:15:02,160
Ask Buchinski!
He runs the whole street.

857
01:15:02,401 --> 01:15:06,155
- Where's Buchinski?
- Down the hall to the right.

858
01:15:50,161 --> 01:15:52,197
<i>Yes, nearer my God to thee... </i>

859
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:54,079
<i>... so brother Bob's here. </i>

860
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:56,516
<i>Brother Bob will bring you to God. </i>

861
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:59,673
<i>Bring you to the Man
to save your soul. </i>

862
01:15:59,921 --> 01:16:01,912
<i>Salvation is where it's at. </i>

863
01:16:03,041 --> 01:16:06,078
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

864
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:09,518
- You a lawyer?
- Yes, I am. Whoever you are...

865
01:16:09,761 --> 01:16:11,956
I'm looking for a tall brunette,
Wanda.

866
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:15,989
I'll tell you something, punk.
It's a protected operation.

867
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:19,153
You'll end up with
your balls in spaghetti sauce.

868
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:22,040
You have clout with the syndicate?

869
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:26,160
I can blow you away with one call,
so get the hell out!

870
01:16:26,401 --> 01:16:30,758
To me, you're just a maggot
who sells dirty pictures.

871
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:53,077
- Wanda! Where is she?
- Go to hell.

872
01:16:53,761 --> 01:16:56,992
- One more time. Wanda?
- All right, all right.

873
01:16:59,241 --> 01:17:01,880
She quit a few weeks ago,
it's all I know.

874
01:17:03,721 --> 01:17:05,359
She got religion.

875
01:17:06,081 --> 01:17:09,756
- What do you mean?
- Hanging by a church on Garvey.

876
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:18,679
<i>Have you received another tape
from the People's Strike Force?</i>

877
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:20,559
<i>- Yes.
- Is the mayor all right?</i>

878
01:17:20,801 --> 01:17:25,158
<i>We've been assured that he's
all right, but there'll be... </i>

879
01:17:25,481 --> 01:17:28,951
<i>... no payment or transportation
until we have... </i>

880
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:30,759
<i>... seen the mayor. </i>

881
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:34,232
<i>- Then you're letting them go?
- That's the agreement. </i>

882
01:17:34,481 --> 01:17:37,518
<i>- Any idea where they are?
- Not yet. </i>

883
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:41,276
<i>We should get one more
message this evening. </i>

884
01:17:41,521 --> 01:17:46,356
<i>- Is Inspector Callahan off this case?
- Sorry, no more questions. </i>

885
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:55,950
What do you have?

886
01:17:56,201 --> 01:18:00,080
The priest, Father John Voss.
Militant, big in prison reform.

887
01:18:00,321 --> 01:18:04,758
He runs rehab seminars in all
the prisons in this area.

888
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:07,993
Here's a list of the cons
that took it in San Quentin.

889
01:18:08,241 --> 01:18:11,278
Bobby Maxell never missed a session.

890
01:18:12,241 --> 01:18:13,674
- You wait here.
- Wait.

891
01:18:13,921 --> 01:18:16,833
The new ransom tape
said "Fessenheim" again.

892
01:18:17,081 --> 01:18:18,560
What does that mean?

893
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:23,079
Last year two bombs blew at a
nuclear plant in Fessenheim, France.

894
01:18:24,761 --> 01:18:26,080
How about that.

895
01:18:35,121 --> 01:18:36,634
The body of Christ.

896
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:42,353
The body of Christ.

897
01:18:46,801 --> 01:18:48,553
The body...

898
01:18:49,121 --> 01:18:50,839
Remember me, Father?

899
01:18:51,441 --> 01:18:52,351
Yes.

900
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:57,033
- What is it you want?
- To talk about Bobby Maxwell.

901
01:18:58,001 --> 01:19:00,071
Then get a warrant.

902
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:21,272
- Just a minute.
- I thought I made it clear to you.

903
01:19:21,521 --> 01:19:24,081
I have nothing to say to you!

904
01:19:24,881 --> 01:19:28,760
Why do you come here
and harass me in my church?

905
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:32,673
- Is that a confessional?
- You want to confess?

906
01:19:32,921 --> 01:19:35,481
You first!

907
01:19:37,441 --> 01:19:39,079
Where the hell's Maxwell?

908
01:19:39,281 --> 01:19:41,237
God may forgive, but I...

909
01:19:41,681 --> 01:19:44,320
Why do you protect them?
Many have died.

910
01:19:44,561 --> 01:19:47,871
Sacrifices have to be made!

911
01:19:48,321 --> 01:19:51,279
- The people are at war!
- So am I!

912
01:19:51,841 --> 01:19:54,719
How dare you pull a gun
in the house of God.

913
01:19:54,961 --> 01:19:56,792
If you don't believe in the sanctity...

914
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:59,953
I don't have time to argue
religion with you!

915
01:20:07,881 --> 01:20:10,156
Look at her hands!
Look at her hands!

916
01:20:19,641 --> 01:20:23,520
- There wasn't supposed to be killing.
- Is she dead?

917
01:20:29,361 --> 01:20:32,273
I close my eyes to this.

918
01:20:34,281 --> 01:20:35,873
Father in heaven, help.

919
01:20:36,281 --> 01:20:38,875
You can't close your eyes anymore.

920
01:20:40,521 --> 01:20:42,477
Now where's Maxwell?

921
01:20:54,161 --> 01:20:56,038
Alcatraz.

922
01:20:56,241 --> 01:20:57,674
A place to hole up.

923
01:20:59,441 --> 01:21:02,160
It wouldn't do
any good to suggest...

924
01:21:03,881 --> 01:21:05,280
Forget it.

925
01:21:08,681 --> 01:21:11,149
<i>No communications
were received since... </i>

926
01:21:11,401 --> 01:21:15,314
Nothing! You sure Wanda
got those tapes to the cops?

927
01:21:15,761 --> 01:21:18,912
Bobby, I don't know.

928
01:21:19,121 --> 01:21:21,794
I don't know.
I wasn't with her!

929
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:29,870
- Lf you didn't think she...
- Shut up!

930
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:32,635
- What're you doing?
- Having some coffee.

931
01:21:46,321 --> 01:21:48,118
Get the hell out of here!

932
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:54,433
Christ, man, get your ass out there!

933
01:22:50,841 --> 01:22:51,830
Lalo.

934
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:54,549
Get the mayor, bring him in here.

935
01:25:03,441 --> 01:25:06,672
I'll get the bar.
Get him out of there.

936
01:25:20,321 --> 01:25:21,436
Freeze!

937
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:25,754
All right, let him go!
Let him go!

938
01:25:27,681 --> 01:25:31,276
Move over there, Your Honor! Fine.

939
01:25:33,241 --> 01:25:37,029
Okay, now, I want you very slowly...

940
01:25:38,081 --> 01:25:39,958
...to put down the weapon...

941
01:25:40,441 --> 01:25:43,274
...then on the deck and spread them.

942
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:46,912
Are you kidding me?

943
01:25:47,161 --> 01:25:51,279
Laugh at me, bastard,
and I'll shoot you where you stand.

944
01:26:02,241 --> 01:26:05,551
Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go!

945
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:08,799
Let's get out of here. Now, speed!

946
01:26:10,241 --> 01:26:11,754
Stay with me.

947
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:13,395
Hold it, hold it.

948
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,678
Just take it very easy.

949
01:26:17,841 --> 01:26:21,834
You relax, do just as I say,
and I'll get you home, all right?

950
01:26:22,081 --> 01:26:24,470
- Yeah.
- Take it slow.

951
01:26:25,481 --> 01:26:26,880
Wait a minute.

952
01:26:28,081 --> 01:26:29,355
Here we go.

953
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:02,634
Harry, look out!

954
01:27:23,041 --> 01:27:25,919
Oh, Harry, I messed up.

955
01:27:26,161 --> 01:27:29,870
You did just fine, Kate.
I'll get you out of here.

956
01:27:33,201 --> 01:27:36,432
Don't concern yourself, Harry.

957
01:27:43,241 --> 01:27:44,469
Get him.

958
01:27:50,921 --> 01:27:52,593
You can count on it.

959
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:12,870
Maxwell!

960
01:28:24,001 --> 01:28:26,276
You fucking fruit!

961
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:34,670
Get up there!

962
01:28:39,041 --> 01:28:40,633
Go on, move!

963
01:28:53,281 --> 01:28:55,272
Karl! Tex!

964
01:28:56,681 --> 01:28:58,160
Karl!

965
01:29:01,361 --> 01:29:02,760
Oh, God!

966
01:29:41,561 --> 01:29:44,837
Callahan, you saved my life.

967
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:49,915
I can't thank you.
I can't tell you...

968
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:54,279
There'll be a letter of commendation
there for you.

969
01:30:07,961 --> 01:30:10,156
Callahan! Callahan!

970
01:30:12,881 --> 01:30:14,553
The chopper's here.

971
01:30:15,281 --> 01:30:18,000
Don't you want a ride?

972
01:30:51,481 --> 01:30:52,675
<i>Maxwell... </i>

973
01:30:53,081 --> 01:30:57,040
<i>... Bobby Maxwell,
this is Captain McKay speaking!</i>

974
01:30:57,841 --> 01:30:59,877
<i>We have your money. </i>

975
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:03,314
<i>The plane's waiting at the airport. </i>

976
01:31:04,161 --> 01:31:07,198
<i>We have acceded to all your demands... </i>

977
01:31:07,801 --> 01:31:09,678
<i>... so release the mayor. </i>

978
01:31:10,481 --> 01:31:14,679
<i>The helicopter will
fly you and your men to safety. </i>
