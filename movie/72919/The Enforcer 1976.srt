1
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,659
Where are you headed, little lady?

2
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:29,897
Nowhere with you, numb-nuts. Buzz off!

3
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,045
See you Thursday, you gorgeous thing.

4
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,853
You picked a beautiful day to hitchhike.

5
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:52,019
Well, I've got a nice little VW back
at Stenson's Beach with a cracked block.

6
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,261
You guys wouldn't be going up
to Mill Valley, would you?

7
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,094
Andy, aren't we going up to Mill Valley?

8
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,402
I got a couple of bottles of ice-cold beer
up there, if you're interested.

9
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,378
You son of a bitch.

10
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,278
Okay, pile in.

11
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:45,474
How long you been in the Western Gas
and Electric Company business?

12
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:48,983
I can't remember how long I've been in it.
How long have I been in it?

13
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:56,218
Turn in, right here.

14
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:04,293
Climb up this road here.

15
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:27,884
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

16
00:06:01,943 --> 00:06:05,037
Better hang a left here, Harry.
There's a jam up on Bay.

17
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,696
What's with the citizen?

18
00:06:42,117 --> 00:06:43,948
Police officer, what's the problem?

19
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,647
Thank God. He's inside.

20
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,658
Come on, it's a heart attack.

21
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,588
Wait here.

22
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:56,326
Make some room, please.
Please, move aside.

23
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:58,866
Please, move aside. This is an emergency.

24
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:03,962
Excuse us. Would you please move over.

25
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:07,236
Would you please give us room.
He's a police officer.

26
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:10,775
- Police? Where's the ambulance?
- This poor man's had a heart attack.

27
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,041
I think he's still breathing, though.

28
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:20,415
Come on, get up.

29
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:23,754
- Get up. Come on.
- What are you doing?

30
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,891
I say.

31
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:35,469
- Party's over.
- Thanks a lot, Harry.

32
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,663
What are you squawking about?

33
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,537
You got the free meal, didn't you?

34
00:07:39,609 --> 00:07:42,874
Yeah, but I always enjoy the ride
in the ambulance.

35
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,373
Get out of here.

36
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:48,239
<i>All units, be advised that this is a 406.</i>

37
00:07:48,585 --> 00:07:50,519
<i>Harry, it's an ''all units.''</i>

38
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:54,347
Marvelous.

39
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,922
My old lady's gonna kill me.

40
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:03,932
She's doing a nine-church novena tonight
and I told her I'd be home early for supper.

41
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,632
<i>Suspects are armed.</i>

42
00:08:11,874 --> 00:08:14,172
<i>Code 33. Code 33.</i>

43
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:18,110
Inspector 71 responding to your 406.

44
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:32,025
What's going on?

45
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:35,122
A couple of bastards
held up that liquor store.

46
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:38,700
One of our guys stumbled in on it
and they shot him up.

47
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:40,394
They grabbed four hostages.

48
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:44,271
They said they'll start shooting them
one by one unless we give them a car.

49
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,808
Then what are you waiting on?

50
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:47,844
Lieutenant Brannigan of Robbery.

51
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,379
He said to stall them until he gets here.

52
00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:56,948
- God, don't let him kill me.
- We want the goddamn car, right now.

53
00:09:02,693 --> 00:09:06,094
<i>All right. But you don't get anything
till I come in and talk.</i>

54
00:09:06,163 --> 00:09:09,189
All right, you bastard,
lay your piece on the hood of that car.

55
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,939
What about me? I'm your partner.

56
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:22,035
<i>I may have to move fast and I don't need
too much linguini to hold me back.</i>

57
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:24,343
You got a lot of class, Harry.

58
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,871
You get cute,
I blow this nice lady all over you. Let's go.

59
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:05,288
On the floor, motherfucker.

60
00:10:05,356 --> 00:10:08,086
For God's sakes, mister, do like he says!

61
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,419
This is my best sports jacket.

62
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:13,362
I said, get your ass on the floor,
you dirty son of a bitch!

63
00:10:13,431 --> 00:10:15,331
Spread eagle. Move it!

64
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,502
Get down there.

65
00:10:21,907 --> 00:10:24,068
San Francisco's finest.

66
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:28,743
Mitch.

67
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:32,914
Roll him over.

68
00:10:37,423 --> 00:10:38,788
He's clean.

69
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:42,086
Here's the story.

70
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:47,632
First, we want all the pigs out of here.

71
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:51,432
Second, we want a car...

72
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:53,931
...with a police radio.

73
00:10:54,707 --> 00:10:56,868
Deliver it right out there in front.

74
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,842
We're taking two hostages:

75
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,940
Both the women.

76
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:06,547
If you don't do exactly what I tell you,
we blow their fucking heads off!

77
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,318
- You got the picture?
- Yeah.

78
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,024
What are you waiting for?

79
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:23,894
Run, you jive-ass bastard.

80
00:11:35,615 --> 00:11:38,175
- What do they want?
- They want a car.

81
00:11:40,987 --> 00:11:42,682
What are you going to do?

82
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,357
Give them one.

83
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,939
You son of a bitch!

84
00:12:40,882 --> 00:12:43,976
Tell me, what makes a man
crazy enough to join the cops?

85
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,879
If you find out, you let me know, huh?

86
00:12:51,425 --> 00:12:55,361
$14,379.

87
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:59,666
- How can that be?
- You want an itemized account?

88
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:03,761
You took out two front doors,
one front window, 12 feet of counter.

89
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,535
Plus damages to the stock.
Plus one city vehicle totaled.

90
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:13,511
As well as three hostages in the hospital,
all of whom will probably sue the city.

91
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,947
- For what?
- Excessive use of force.

92
00:13:16,018 --> 00:13:17,952
For your information, Callahan...

93
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,786
...the minority community has just about
had it with this kind of police work.

94
00:13:21,857 --> 00:13:24,849
<i>By the ''minority community,''
you're talking about the hoods?</i>

95
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:27,862
It so happens that they are
American citizens, too.

96
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:30,329
What about the lady with the shotgun
in her ear?

97
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,367
I'm not going to debate this with you.

98
00:13:32,434 --> 00:13:35,096
I've been on the phone
to the Mayor twice this morning.

99
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,468
He went right through the ceiling over this.

100
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:39,404
Did you tell him about the meeting?

101
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:42,443
- What meeting?
- The meeting right here, two months ago...

102
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:45,639
<i>...when you said high priority was:
''Run these hoods out of here.''</i>

103
00:13:45,714 --> 00:13:47,272
I never said to use violence.

104
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:49,715
<i>What should I do,
yell ''trick-or-treat'' at them?</i>

105
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:50,945
Come on, Harry.

106
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,920
I expect you,
and every other man on this force...

107
00:13:53,989 --> 00:13:57,447
...to behave with restraint
or turn in his resignation.

108
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,957
You're on notice, Callahan.

109
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:03,589
This little show of yours yesterday
is exactly the kind of thing...

110
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:06,600
...this department
is no longer prepared to tolerate!

111
00:14:06,868 --> 00:14:08,359
Is that clear?

112
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:10,867
Yes, sir.

113
00:14:13,409 --> 00:14:16,970
- If that's all, Captain, I've got work to do.
- But not in Homicide.

114
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:20,777
What?

115
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:23,479
You've been transferred to Personnel.

116
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,381
To Personnel?

117
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:27,252
That's for assholes.

118
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,897
I was in Personnel for 10 years.

119
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:37,793
Yeah.

120
00:14:39,068 --> 00:14:40,126
That's it.

121
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:44,196
You report tomorrow to the Oral
Examining Board. 9:00, on the dot.

122
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:51,039
No, you haven't got the picture.

123
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,774
I'm the robber, you're the cop.

124
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,647
Now, I'm in a market, see?

125
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,951
And you've just caught me, dead bang.
A 211 in the act.

126
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:03,185
But I'm coming out, and I've got a hostage.

127
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:05,694
A kid with a gun at his head.

128
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,993
There's no way you're gonna take me alive.

129
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:10,761
<i>You've 10 seconds to make up your mind,
''Here I come.''</i>

130
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,199
What are you gonna do?

131
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,395
One...

132
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,631
...two, three...
- You're under arrest.

133
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,266
...four, five...
- Do something!

134
00:15:18,342 --> 00:15:20,242
<i>...six, seven...
- How tall is he?</i>

135
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,744
Don't just stand there, goddamn it,
do something!

136
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,576
Bang, you're dead.

137
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,249
- You're late, Callahan.
- Sorry about that.

138
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,047
- Hello, Krause.
- Hi.

139
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:33,785
All right, Bustanoby,
you'll be notified of your grade.

140
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,322
You were told to be here at 9:00.

141
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,862
We have 50 officers out there to test.

142
00:15:40,164 --> 00:15:42,462
- For how many vacancies?
- Eight.

143
00:15:42,699 --> 00:15:47,136
There will be five men and three women
promoted to inspector out of this group.

144
00:15:47,204 --> 00:15:49,900
- Three women?
- Do you object, Inspector?

145
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,339
Now, who might you be?

146
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:56,170
This is Mrs. Grey of the Mayor's staff.

147
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,373
She's here to monitor these examinations.

148
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,916
This is Inspector Callahan.

149
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:02,452
Yes, I know something
of Inspector Callahan.

150
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:05,213
And I'd like to tell you...

151
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,124
...it's the Mayor's plan that the department
be brought more into line with...

152
00:16:09,194 --> 00:16:12,721
...the mainstream of 20th century thought.

153
00:16:14,732 --> 00:16:17,792
How does he figure to do that?

154
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,932
For one thing...

155
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:23,439
...his Honor intends...

156
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,534
...to broaden the areas of participation
for women in the police force.

157
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,678
Well, that sounds very stylish.

158
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,213
I think he also said something about:

159
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:38,980
<i>''Winnowing the Neanderthals
out of the department.''</i>

160
00:16:44,028 --> 00:16:47,088
Well, I guess we better get on with it.
Next applicant.

161
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:52,999
- Officer Moore?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:16:53,071 --> 00:16:56,063
As you know, this is the final stage
in your examination.

163
00:16:56,141 --> 00:17:00,909
It's an informal test to try and get an idea
of your ability to think on your feet.

164
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,574
Your reaction to stress and pressure.

165
00:17:03,849 --> 00:17:08,183
Your ability to apply the law
in a hypothetical situation and so on, okay?

166
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:09,749
Yes, sir.

167
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,388
How long have you been on the force?

168
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,323
- Nine years.
- What department?

169
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:17,362
Mainly Personnel and Records.

170
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,694
- Personnel and Records?
- Yes, sir.

171
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:30,203
Have you any questions for the applicant?

172
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,078
Questions? How fast do you run the 100?

173
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,716
Come on, Callahan,
you know how this board functions.

174
00:17:44,557 --> 00:17:46,354
All right, I'm sorry.

175
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:51,026
You know that...

176
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:55,600
...if you make inspector
under the Mayor's new guidelines...

177
00:17:56,002 --> 00:17:59,403
...you might just be out riding
in a police car?

178
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,803
Yes, sir, that's what I'm hoping for.

179
00:18:02,075 --> 00:18:04,043
Officer Moore, maybe you'll tell us...

180
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,544
...about your most important felony arrest.

181
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:10,914
I've never made a felony arrest.

182
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,117
Well, maybe you'll tell us about
your best misdemeanor arrest, then.

183
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:20,925
I've never made
a misdemeanor arrest either.

184
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:24,188
Then what the hell gives you the right
to become an inspector...

185
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:27,062
...when some men have been
on the street for 10 or 15 years?

186
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:30,534
<i>''The woman's place is in the home.''
Is that what you're trying to say?</i>

187
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:32,663
Do you think this is an encounter group?

188
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:35,936
I want to know what she'll do
when someone points a gun at her...

189
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,499
<i>...and says, ''Hit the deck! ''</i>

190
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:40,910
You're just deliberately trying
to fail this candidate, aren't you?

191
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,950
Well, if she fails out there,
she gets her ass blown off.

192
00:18:44,017 --> 00:18:45,917
It's my ass!

193
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:49,882
And my hard luck.

194
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:52,656
Except, out there you'll have a partner.

195
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:55,195
If you get blown away,
he gets blown away with you.

196
00:18:55,263 --> 00:18:58,562
And that's a hell of a price to pay
for being stylish.

197
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,569
Are you finished with the questioning?

198
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,538
Hypothetical situation, huh?

199
00:19:15,082 --> 00:19:16,947
I'm standing on the street corner...

200
00:19:17,018 --> 00:19:19,748
...and Mrs. Grey there comes up
and propositions me.

201
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,187
She says, if I come home with her for $5,
she'll put on a show...

202
00:19:23,257 --> 00:19:27,250
<i>...with a Shetland pony.
- If this is your idea of humor, Inspector...</i>

203
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:33,565
All right, what are you trying
to do here, Callahan?

204
00:19:33,634 --> 00:19:37,297
I'm trying to find out if anybody here
knows what law is being broken...

205
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:39,339
...besides cruelty to animals.

206
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:42,572
That's a conspiracy,
under Title 7, Section 182...

207
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:45,111
...Paragraph 1
of the California State Penal Code.

208
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:47,647
A conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor
is a felony...

209
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:51,618
...and according to People vs. Bashor in...
- Yes, that's right, good answer.

210
00:19:51,687 --> 00:19:54,986
Thank you, Officer Moore,
you'll be notified of your grade.

211
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,773
After I take care of the guard
and get his keys...

212
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:23,045
...we drive to the far end
of warehouse 50A. Lalo?

213
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,845
<i>All right, now that's...</i>

214
00:20:26,988 --> 00:20:30,549
I drop you off at that end,
at that small door, then I drive around...

215
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:34,186
...to the wharf side of the warehouse.
You open up that first big door...

216
00:20:34,763 --> 00:20:38,563
...I drive it in and back up
to the first compound on the right.

217
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:40,061
Karl and Tex?

218
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:43,195
Hey, man,
we grab the M-16 automatic rifles, right?

219
00:20:43,271 --> 00:20:44,431
Wanda?

220
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,809
Locate and take any explosives.

221
00:20:48,144 --> 00:20:50,806
Dynamite, detonators, and any plastics.

222
00:20:51,381 --> 00:20:52,814
Right. Henry Lee?

223
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:56,849
I tote and I load all the ammo
for the M-16s, okay, man?

224
00:20:57,053 --> 00:20:58,145
Miki?

225
00:20:58,221 --> 00:21:02,089
Locate the Law rockets. They should be
somewhere in the back of the compound.

226
00:21:02,158 --> 00:21:05,685
That's the most important item.
Tex, are you sure of their location?

227
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:08,492
Hey, I sweated in that place for five years.

228
00:21:08,564 --> 00:21:10,555
They're there, I promise.

229
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,797
All right, you guys.

230
00:21:12,902 --> 00:21:15,962
<i>- This is for the people.
- Right on, ''for the people.''</i>

231
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:19,367
Jesus, spare me.

232
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:57,346
- What is it?
- Gas Company.

233
00:21:57,414 --> 00:22:00,008
- What's the trouble?
- We've a gas leak in the area.

234
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:02,244
We got to check out
your underground pipes.

235
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,152
For pete's sake,
don't smoke until we tell you it's okay.

236
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:07,019
I won't.

237
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:20,493
It's seeping down into your sewer system.
This whole damn block could go!

238
00:22:20,571 --> 00:22:23,506
- You got a phone I could use?
- Yeah, right this way.

239
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,525
Let's go.

240
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,703
Charlie left the gate open.

241
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,574
Better check it.

242
00:24:33,006 --> 00:24:34,633
Tony, call a backup.

243
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,443
- I'm going to check around.
- Frank, watch yourself.

244
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:58,354
Law's rocket!

245
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:02,061
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

246
00:25:03,903 --> 00:25:07,031
Lalo, get the rest of these loaded.

247
00:25:15,415 --> 00:25:18,384
You'll blow us out of here.
Be quiet. Are you all right?

248
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:21,311
Let us get these.

249
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:27,251
Freeze.

250
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:47,910
All of you, hold it right there!
Put those boxes down.

251
00:25:51,185 --> 00:25:54,154
You, back there,
stand up where I can see you.

252
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,453
And drop that gun.
Put your hands over your head and freeze!

253
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:08,399
- Now, just wait a second, mister.
- Now you shut up and listen.

254
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:12,836
You just blink an eyelid
and I'll mail you home to Mama in a box.

255
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:15,201
Now, all of you, against the fence!

256
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,377
Now!

257
00:26:23,918 --> 00:26:25,351
You, too, honey!

258
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:31,888
Oh, Jesus!

259
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,659
Oh, my God. Jesus!

260
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:40,797
Oh, baby, it's all right,
I'll get you out. I'll get you home.

261
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,734
Bobby, help me. Help me get her up.

262
00:26:42,804 --> 00:26:45,796
- You're going to get us caught.
- No, we'll make it.

263
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:48,172
- She's dead.
- She's not dead!

264
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:49,972
The hell she isn't!

265
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:56,478
Come on, it's over.

266
00:27:15,904 --> 00:27:17,963
Get it on there.

267
00:27:19,941 --> 00:27:22,774
Lalo, get up in there. Come on.

268
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:47,625
Halt, police! Halt or I'll fire!

269
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,366
I'm gonna get this son of a bitch.

270
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:53,940
Goddamn it!

271
00:28:03,686 --> 00:28:06,883
Well, he said it looked like
a regular Gas Company truck.

272
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:10,654
I'm checking with the Marin County
Sheriff's Department.

273
00:28:10,726 --> 00:28:14,560
Might tie in with those two bodies
they found up there last week.

274
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,162
Yes, sir.

275
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:21,362
How's DiGeorgio?

276
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:23,903
Well, Irene is in there with him now.

277
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,532
Is that supposed to be
some kind of answer?

278
00:28:27,044 --> 00:28:29,569
Harry, he's just been given the last rites.

279
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,871
- Get what you can, huh?
- I will.

280
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:33,814
- Listen, I'm sorry.
- I know.

281
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:41,057
Hello, Harry.

282
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,254
He's been asking for you.

283
00:28:43,493 --> 00:28:44,824
How is he?

284
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:46,987
He's in and out.

285
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,470
I'll smoke a cigarette.

286
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:00,105
It's a war, isn't it?

287
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:04,340
I guess I never really understood that.

288
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:21,864
Frank, what happened?

289
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,435
<i>I had them dead bang. And then I...</i>

290
00:29:32,343 --> 00:29:33,605
Sorry.

291
00:29:39,717 --> 00:29:42,208
There's something
you wanted to tell Harry.

292
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:46,948
Harry, listen, the punk who cut me...

293
00:29:47,959 --> 00:29:49,586
...l've seen him before.

294
00:29:50,028 --> 00:29:51,188
Where?

295
00:29:52,096 --> 00:29:54,189
I just can't make the name.

296
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,700
Well, where do you know him from, Frank?

297
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,867
That homicide, remember?

298
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:01,972
The old hooker...

299
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,871
...up on Filmore district.

300
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:05,976
The summer of '71?

301
00:30:07,312 --> 00:30:08,404
What about it?

302
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,812
Well, he was one of the pimps
we questioned.

303
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,019
We liked him for it, Harry.

304
00:30:15,487 --> 00:30:17,682
We liked him real good.

305
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,417
As I recall, we liked everybody
north of Market Street on that one.

306
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:26,487
He had one of those cutesy-pie
little boy names:

307
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:30,459
Charlie or something, or Bobby.

308
00:30:31,603 --> 00:30:34,697
I'll check Records,
they should have your notes.

309
00:30:37,843 --> 00:30:39,834
Ten-to-one they blow it.

310
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:42,180
Not this time, Frank.

311
00:30:46,151 --> 00:30:48,312
Maybe you better get some rest, huh?

312
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:50,588
Do you have to go just yet?

313
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:52,916
Not if you don't want me to.

314
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,917
Thanks, Harry.

315
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,601
Get Irene.

316
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:15,977
- Did you talk to Records?
- No, not yet. That was McKay.

317
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:21,117
We just got a tape from those bastards.
I'll see you in my office in 30 minutes.

318
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:27,223
Code Blue, intensive care.

319
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:30,827
Thirty minutes.

320
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:34,599
<i>We want $1 million
or we start blowing things up.</i>

321
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,067
<i>The People's Revolutionary Strike Force.</i>

322
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,966
<i>Remember Fessenheim.</i>

323
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,201
Fessenheim?

324
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:43,140
It's being checked.

325
00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:46,235
This Revolutionary Strike Force,
are they on your list?

326
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:51,040
Nothing.

327
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:53,708
- Think it's legitimate?
- Probably not.

328
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,113
This is Lieutenant Bressler in Homicide.

329
00:31:58,758 --> 00:32:02,216
Well, what are you doing
about those records? What's happening?

330
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:04,292
<i>What do you mean, ''what records''?</i>

331
00:32:04,364 --> 00:32:06,993
I talked to you about them
half an hour ago.

332
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:11,935
Homicide. Filmore district.
Inspectors Callahan and DiGeorgio.

333
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:17,170
What are you talking about,
a written request?

334
00:32:17,378 --> 00:32:19,403
Well, who's got the keys?

335
00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:22,714
Look. I'm coming down there
in five minutes...

336
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:27,345
...and you better have those files open,
you pencil-pushing son of a bitch!

337
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,624
You don't have to make threats.

338
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,884
I'm telling you, I'm going to nail the guy...

339
00:32:33,961 --> 00:32:36,862
...who carved DiGeorgio
if I have to do it on my own time.

340
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:38,330
That won't be necessary.

341
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,994
You've been back in Homicide
since 9:00 this morning, didn't you know?

342
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:46,872
No. I've been down in Records
looking up an old homicide.

343
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:48,101
Any luck?

344
00:32:48,175 --> 00:32:51,406
Well, I've got 11 names here
of known pimps.

345
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:56,339
- I think our man is one of them.
- Judson, Maddox, Skidmore.

346
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,781
Shall I tell you my instinct on this?

347
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,914
- Black militants.
- No, it keeps coming up hookers.

348
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,755
The girl who was shot in the warehouse
is Miki Waleska.

349
00:33:05,827 --> 00:33:07,522
She was a known prostitute.

350
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:11,498
What we've got here is
a well-organized group of militants...

351
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:15,400
...with enough explosives to blow half
of San Francisco away, including...

352
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,404
...Law's rockets!

353
00:33:17,472 --> 00:33:18,700
- Law's rockets?
- Yeah.

354
00:33:18,773 --> 00:33:21,606
The Army's giving us a demonstration
at the firing range...

355
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:23,667
...in exactly 35 minutes.

356
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:26,407
I'd like everyone connected
with the case to be there.

357
00:33:26,481 --> 00:33:28,642
I want you to know what you're up against.

358
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:32,619
I've too much to do. Besides, I've already
been checked out on a Law's rocket.

359
00:33:32,687 --> 00:33:34,018
Your partner hasn't.

360
00:33:35,423 --> 00:33:36,549
My partner?

361
00:33:44,132 --> 00:33:45,861
Shit!

362
00:33:46,301 --> 00:33:48,394
You know Inspector Moore?

363
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:51,769
Inspector.

364
00:33:52,474 --> 00:33:54,965
I'll see you both out at the firing range.

365
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,977
Inspector?

366
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:06,679
Listen, Inspector, I realize that you are not
particularly happy by this assignment.

367
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:10,021
- You don't think I'm up to it, do you?
- Right.

368
00:34:10,826 --> 00:34:12,157
All right...

369
00:34:12,228 --> 00:34:15,857
...I would like to get one thing straight,
and that is the fact I'm a woman.

370
00:34:15,932 --> 00:34:18,628
I consider that fact absolutely irrelevant
from now on...

371
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:22,467
...because I will not accept,
nor do I expect, any special consideration.

372
00:34:22,672 --> 00:34:24,071
Marvelous.

373
00:34:24,874 --> 00:34:27,866
The Law's rocket,
for all intents and purposes...

374
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:31,010
...a one-shot, throwaway,
disposable bazooka.

375
00:34:32,915 --> 00:34:35,383
It is a fiberglass tube, 45 inches long...

376
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,614
...3 inches in diameter,
which fires a single projectile...

377
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:43,125
<i>...designed to penetrate armor plating
up to the thickness 3/4 of an inch.</i>

378
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:47,387
If you've all had a good look at the rocket,
I'll demonstrate how it works.

379
00:34:48,064 --> 00:34:51,033
To fire the rocket, you first pull this pin...

380
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:53,267
...dropping the rear cover...

381
00:34:53,636 --> 00:34:55,467
...then pull.

382
00:34:55,771 --> 00:34:58,172
<i>Your front sight,
your rear sight spring up...</i>

383
00:34:58,242 --> 00:35:00,540
I got word from Pathology...

384
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:04,047
...at noon they're posting that guard
that was killed last night.

385
00:35:04,114 --> 00:35:06,412
- Check on it.
- I'll be there.

386
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,275
Captain?

387
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:09,814
Go ahead.

388
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:12,786
Gentlemen, if you'll keep your eyes
on that half-track...

389
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:16,053
...l'll demonstrate how effective
this weapon can be.

390
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:38,914
Coming, Inspector?

391
00:36:11,716 --> 00:36:13,377
- Inspector?
- Yeah?

392
00:36:13,484 --> 00:36:15,952
- 13.5 in my gym shorts.
- What?

393
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:19,518
My time in the 100.
You asked me at the Orals Board.

394
00:36:19,691 --> 00:36:22,125
- You think I was picking on you?
- Yes.

395
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,655
It was nothing personal.

396
00:36:24,762 --> 00:36:25,751
Right.

397
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,763
I don't think you know
what we do for a living in Homicide.

398
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:29,822
I'll find out.

399
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,028
I hope you don't find out the hard way.

400
00:36:32,103 --> 00:36:34,264
How fast do you run the 100, Inspector?

401
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:35,772
Beats me.

402
00:36:36,374 --> 00:36:39,138
I meant to tell you how sorry I am
about your partner.

403
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,973
He's not the first one I've lost.

404
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:45,641
I know, Fanducci in '68 and Smith in '72,
but it wasn't your fault.

405
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,478
- How'd you know that?
- I checked on your records.

406
00:36:48,853 --> 00:36:51,186
I don't want to get killed
anymore than you do.

407
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:52,518
What's the matter?

408
00:36:52,691 --> 00:36:55,558
The Black guy with the briefcase.
I know him from somewhere.

409
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:57,117
- Tan suit?
- Yeah.

410
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:00,027
What did he do?

411
00:37:00,466 --> 00:37:03,026
Can't remember. It's not important.

412
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:08,601
- Tell me, ever been to one of these before?
- No.

413
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:12,336
In that case,
I'd like to suggest that you sit out here.

414
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:15,643
Please don't concern yourself, Inspector.

415
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:22,618
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi.

416
00:37:22,688 --> 00:37:24,553
Who's the pretty lady?

417
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,221
That's my partner, Inspector Moore.

418
00:37:27,693 --> 00:37:29,251
You've missed most of it.

419
00:37:29,328 --> 00:37:31,159
We got hung up on a firing range.

420
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,859
I've got it on tape for you.
We've just finished the abdominal cavity.

421
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:36,696
I'm interested in the wound.

422
00:37:36,769 --> 00:37:39,966
The entry wound
was above the right renal area...

423
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:43,633
...between the ninth and tenth rib,
penetrating up into the chest cavity...

424
00:37:43,709 --> 00:37:45,472
...perforating the right lung.

425
00:37:45,544 --> 00:37:48,708
There was also damage
to some of the other vital organs...

426
00:37:48,782 --> 00:37:50,909
...pancreas, kidneys, etcetera.

427
00:37:51,484 --> 00:37:54,317
- What kind of a knife was it?
- A long heavy blade.

428
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:56,945
We're going into the skull now.

429
00:37:58,591 --> 00:38:02,152
I'd say, an educated guess,
it was one of those killing knives:

430
00:38:02,228 --> 00:38:05,664
A Marine Corps Boy,
or one of those Special Forces' Randalls.

431
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:07,366
Any bruises about the face?

432
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:11,200
Indications that the killer clamped
his left hand over the mouth, from behind.

433
00:38:11,271 --> 00:38:12,966
- Professional?
- Textbook.

434
00:38:14,774 --> 00:38:18,141
On first examination,
no exterior damage to the skull.

435
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,713
<i>Subject brain shows no contrecoup- type
damage or blood clotting.</i>

436
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,819
Jesus H. Christ, Harry,
come here and look at this!

437
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:07,088
- It's the damnedest thing I ever saw.
- What's that?

438
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,593
<i>What it says: ''Eat at Luigi's! ''</i>

439
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,210
Welcome to Homicide.

440
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:47,992
What are you doing? Come here.

441
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,603
Excuse me, I'm with him.

442
00:39:57,345 --> 00:40:01,611
I was coming down the hall to take a leak
when this whole thing blew.

443
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,677
Anybody in there?

444
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:08,315
- No, I don't think so.
- Where are you going?

445
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:10,654
I got a group of kids,
some of them are missing.

446
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:12,784
- Help him out.
- Me?

447
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:15,556
Great. Just step out here, will you?

448
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,960
Well, we were lucky this time.

449
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,800
It's getting so that you can't even go
to the can in peace.

450
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,941
- We've got them all, they're okay.
- Good.

451
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:34,643
You didn't see anybody go in there
before the explosion, did you?

452
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:35,478
No.

453
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:39,009
You sure? Black guy with a tan hat
and suit, briefcase.

454
00:40:39,922 --> 00:40:41,412
I did see a guy like that.

455
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,355
Was he a short guy, about 5-foot-1?

456
00:40:43,426 --> 00:40:45,417
No, this dude was 6 foot.

457
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:46,893
That's him.

458
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:53,760
It was a bomb, I think I saw who did it.

459
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:55,804
- Any idea who it was?
- He looked familiar...

460
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,463
- Inspector?
- Just a minute.

461
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:00,103
- You better check the mug shots.
- Inspector?

462
00:41:00,176 --> 00:41:03,543
Honey, do you mind, we're talking.
This is very important.

463
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:06,980
Now, you better check the mug shots,
we just got another message.

464
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,880
They're asking for $2 million now.

465
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:10,441
- $2 million?
- I just saw him.

466
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:13,215
- Who?
- Tan suit and a hat and a briefcase.

467
00:41:14,123 --> 00:41:16,353
- Where?
- Right down here.

468
00:41:16,425 --> 00:41:19,986
- Why the hell didn't you tell me?
- Why the hell didn't you ask me?

469
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,101
There he is, look!

470
00:43:50,115 --> 00:43:51,104
Jesus!

471
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:32,216
Damn it.

472
00:45:12,732 --> 00:45:14,666
What the hell's going on here?

473
00:45:17,303 --> 00:45:18,998
What are you doing here?

474
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:32,919
- Who are you?
- Police officer.

475
00:46:25,307 --> 00:46:27,468
All right, speedy, you're under arrest.

476
00:46:27,542 --> 00:46:30,534
In the name of God, man, this is a church.
What are you doing?

477
00:46:30,612 --> 00:46:32,944
I'm a police officer, this man's under arrest.

478
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:36,472
Father, help me, I wasn't doing a thing.
This guy is just rousting me.

479
00:46:36,551 --> 00:46:39,714
Would it be asking too much
to see some credentials, Officer?

480
00:46:39,788 --> 00:46:42,621
This guy runs like a rabbit.
I'm not about to let him go.

481
00:46:42,691 --> 00:46:45,182
I'd like to see the credentials, right now.

482
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,122
If you insist.

483
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:54,925
- Callahan, Inspector.
- Well, Callahan...

484
00:46:56,338 --> 00:46:59,136
...I think you're a disgrace to this city.

485
00:46:59,207 --> 00:47:01,300
Okay. Nobody move!

486
00:47:10,185 --> 00:47:11,516
Marvelous.

487
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,581
Yes, I think so.

488
00:47:14,656 --> 00:47:16,852
Harry, wait a minute, I'm just talking to...

489
00:47:16,926 --> 00:47:18,393
Jesus Christ!

490
00:47:19,061 --> 00:47:20,358
Give him my best.

491
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:21,862
I'll call you back.

492
00:47:21,998 --> 00:47:24,558
Don't worry,
it's been disarmed by the bomb squad.

493
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:28,467
But it's definitely the explosive
out of the Hamilton Firearms works.

494
00:47:29,071 --> 00:47:32,097
There are times when I can only stand you
as a human being.

495
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:34,503
What about the punk?

496
00:47:34,877 --> 00:47:37,345
- You mean the suspect.
- Suspect, my ass.

497
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:39,938
He isn't talking,
but we've got a make on him.

498
00:47:40,016 --> 00:47:41,677
His name is Henry Lee Caldwell.

499
00:47:41,751 --> 00:47:44,948
And he is a member
of a Black militant group called Uhuru.

500
00:47:45,955 --> 00:47:48,321
- Pusseau, shelve that.
- Uhuru?

501
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:52,026
It's run by a guy called Big Ed Mustapha.

502
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:55,291
Mustapha, down the Mission district.

503
00:47:55,364 --> 00:47:57,332
I thought that guy looked familiar.

504
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,697
Where's my partner?

505
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:00,736
She's in the can.

506
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:03,202
She's been in there
ever since she found out...

507
00:48:03,272 --> 00:48:07,106
...that she was packing this thing,
in that briefcase, all over San Francisco.

508
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,508
Harry, do me a favor. Go easy on her, huh?

509
00:48:09,578 --> 00:48:12,742
It's her first day
and it's been a damn long one.

510
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,784
If she wants to play lumberjack, she's got
to learn to handle her end of the log.

511
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,374
Okay, I give up, what's this?

512
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:43,342
This is the Filmore chapter
of the VFW: Very Few Whites.

513
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,711
I don't suppose it would do any good
to suggest you wait in the car?

514
00:48:47,784 --> 00:48:49,911
Don't concern yourself, Inspector.

515
00:48:55,158 --> 00:48:58,525
Well, if it ain't the mighty whitey
and friend.

516
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,961
I'm looking for Big Ed Mustapha.

517
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:06,030
Sorry, honkie, she can stay,
but you've got to go.

518
00:49:06,503 --> 00:49:10,463
Yeah, baby, we're trying to keep up
the standards, you understand.

519
00:49:10,641 --> 00:49:13,508
- You're not making us feel too welcome.
- You're welcome.

520
00:49:13,578 --> 00:49:16,547
You're about as welcome as a turd
in a swimming pool.

521
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:29,954
Well, lookie here, if it ain't the fuzz.

522
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:31,924
I'm looking for Ed Mustapha.

523
00:49:31,996 --> 00:49:36,330
- You hold some kind of warrant, honkie?
- What I'm holding is Henry Lee Caldwell.

524
00:49:37,001 --> 00:49:38,593
I've never heard of him.

525
00:49:38,669 --> 00:49:42,901
Let's see how fast you and the lady fuzz
can get your white asses out of here.

526
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:45,571
What is Henry Lee into now?

527
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:53,673
He's been playing with dynamite.
Are you Mustapha?

528
00:49:54,252 --> 00:49:56,083
Yeah, that's right.

529
00:49:56,888 --> 00:49:59,413
Why don't you just come
into my office here.

530
00:50:01,459 --> 00:50:02,756
Just you.

531
00:50:04,328 --> 00:50:07,196
Don't worry, pig,
we'll see she don't get lonesome.

532
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:12,562
Well, that's mighty white of you.

533
00:50:15,474 --> 00:50:18,341
Now, gentlemen, before anybody
does anything uncalled for...

534
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,811
...l'd like to take this chance
to point out I am a police officer...

535
00:50:21,914 --> 00:50:24,974
<i>...and if you touch me
with intent to do bodily harm...</i>

536
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:32,488
Sit down, Callahan.

537
00:50:33,025 --> 00:50:34,754
Where do I know you from?

538
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,555
You don't.

539
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,799
I just know you.

540
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,841
Now, what's Henry Lee been up to?

541
00:50:52,144 --> 00:50:53,873
You telling me you don't know?

542
00:50:53,946 --> 00:50:57,677
He don't come around here,
not for a long time.

543
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,449
Where is he?

544
00:51:00,485 --> 00:51:04,115
He went white.
Why, did he do something else foolish?

545
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:10,291
He and his friends were involved
in a ripoff at the Hamilton Firearms.

546
00:51:10,396 --> 00:51:12,193
I heard about that.

547
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,997
Would you like to buy into that?

548
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:17,536
Four counts of murder, aiding and abetting.

549
00:51:17,604 --> 00:51:22,041
You got the wrong number, boy.
We don't deal in violence.

550
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:23,766
What do you deal in?

551
00:51:23,843 --> 00:51:25,071
Waiting.

552
00:51:25,678 --> 00:51:26,940
For what?

553
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:31,879
Waiting for all you white honkies...

554
00:51:31,951 --> 00:51:35,546
...to blow each other up
so we can move right on in.

555
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:41,059
Tell me about Henry Lee
and these friends of his.

556
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:45,188
Some paddy-dudes he met in Vietnam.
Why?

557
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:50,225
Anybody on this list here grab you?

558
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:53,671
Hey, man, why should I want to help you?

559
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:58,074
If you don't, I have to talk to Robbery.
They might be interested...

560
00:51:58,144 --> 00:52:00,079
...in these elaborate furnishings.

561
00:52:00,714 --> 00:52:02,511
What are you talking about?

562
00:52:04,551 --> 00:52:06,382
Room 401, Fairmont.

563
00:52:08,222 --> 00:52:10,053
<i>''Rest easy at the Holiday Inn.''</i>

564
00:52:10,958 --> 00:52:12,755
Okay, so?

565
00:52:13,527 --> 00:52:15,461
Maybe they're a little warm.

566
00:52:15,863 --> 00:52:17,262
I'll tell you what:

567
00:52:18,098 --> 00:52:21,431
One of my boys got busted
on a possession charge.

568
00:52:21,635 --> 00:52:25,469
Now, you get him off and forget about
my interior decorator...

569
00:52:25,873 --> 00:52:28,103
...and I'll see what I can do.

570
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:29,572
That's asking a lot.

571
00:52:29,548 --> 00:52:30,845
You want a lot.

572
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:35,652
A thing like this can ruin my image.

573
00:52:39,425 --> 00:52:41,017
I'll see what I can do.

574
00:52:41,994 --> 00:52:43,757
What about the list?

575
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:54,033
Bobby Maxwell.

576
00:52:57,611 --> 00:52:59,010
He's the main man.

577
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:00,674
You know him?

578
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:03,173
Stone waste of white.

579
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,974
Where can I find him?

580
00:53:06,753 --> 00:53:08,414
I'll check around.

581
00:53:09,956 --> 00:53:13,187
You do that. Much obliged.

582
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:16,989
Callahan, you're on the wrong side.

583
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,157
How do you figure that?

584
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:21,457
You go and put your ass on the line...

585
00:53:21,534 --> 00:53:25,368
...for a bunch of dudes who wouldn't even
let you in the front door anymore...

586
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:28,031
...than they would me.

587
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:30,474
- I'm not doing it for them.
- Who, then?

588
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:36,679
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

589
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:44,317
- If it becomes necessary to pull this piece...
- Having fun, Inspector?

590
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:47,360
If you're through socializing,
we do have work to do.

591
00:53:48,461 --> 00:53:50,088
Son of a bitch.

592
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:57,465
If you have some sort of objection
to the way I handled myself...

593
00:53:57,538 --> 00:53:59,267
...I wish you'd just say so.

594
00:54:00,074 --> 00:54:02,099
I thought I was doing all right.

595
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,515
Marvelous.

596
00:55:04,206 --> 00:55:06,367
<i>All right, Mustapha...</i>

597
00:55:07,275 --> 00:55:10,938
<i>... this is Captain McKay
of the San Francisco Police Department.</i>

598
00:55:12,247 --> 00:55:16,411
<i>I'm ordering you to throw down
your weapons and come out peacefully.</i>

599
00:55:23,291 --> 00:55:25,384
<i>You are totally surrounded.</i>

600
00:55:26,328 --> 00:55:28,125
<i>Mustapha, do you hear me?</i>

601
00:55:29,231 --> 00:55:31,961
<i>Come out with your hands
raised over your heads.</i>

602
00:56:06,169 --> 00:56:08,569
I don't want to seem ungrateful,
Your Honor...

603
00:56:08,638 --> 00:56:11,232
...I just feel that it might be a better idea.

604
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:14,105
Well, I'm still a little confused.

605
00:56:15,011 --> 00:56:17,605
Now, you and the SWAT team
made the arrest...

606
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,945
...but you want the credit to go
to Inspectors Moore and Callahan?

607
00:56:21,017 --> 00:56:23,815
Your Honor,
I just felt it might be a better tactic...

608
00:56:23,886 --> 00:56:27,083
...politically,
what with the election coming up soon.

609
00:56:27,223 --> 00:56:31,387
To show how your new guidelines
for women in the police have worked.

610
00:56:31,494 --> 00:56:34,895
Sort of an I-told-you-so situation,
if you know what I mean, sir.

611
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:39,458
Yes, I see. It's an excellent idea.
What do you think, Jimmy?

612
00:56:40,169 --> 00:56:42,160
Yes, sir, I couldn't agree more.

613
00:56:43,507 --> 00:56:45,873
You have proved to be quite an asset...

614
00:56:46,076 --> 00:56:48,704
...to the department
and to this administration.

615
00:56:48,779 --> 00:56:49,837
Thank you, sir.

616
00:56:49,913 --> 00:56:53,974
Mr. Mayor, the presentation of
the commendation starts in five minutes.

617
00:56:54,051 --> 00:56:57,020
- I think we'd better get going, sir.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

618
00:56:57,154 --> 00:57:00,123
Captain, off the record,
there are going to be changes...

619
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:04,627
...in the department after the election,
and you'll figure greatly in my plans.

620
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:07,829
I'm sure you'll make the right decision, sir.

621
00:57:11,268 --> 00:57:15,261
Do you have any comments on the arrest
of the Black militants yesterday?

622
00:57:15,706 --> 00:57:17,571
Later, Jim, later.

623
00:57:18,675 --> 00:57:22,839
Now, as Mayor of San Francisco,
I want to make it official.

624
00:57:23,247 --> 00:57:27,411
This is one hell of a cop.
And here come a couple more.

625
00:57:27,484 --> 00:57:29,247
Good morning, right this way.

626
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:32,720
Lieutenant Bressler, Inspector Moore,
would you move toward the stairs.

627
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:35,257
Mr. Mayor, would you join them.

628
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:37,759
We're gonna have
some photographs taken here.

629
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,997
- Is this all right, Mayor?
- Yes.

630
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:46,764
Would you kindly move in
just a little tighter.

631
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:52,274
Here we are, gentlemen, the two
inspectors who made the Mustapha arrest.

632
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,107
This is Inspector Moore and Callahan.

633
00:57:56,447 --> 00:58:00,076
How about one with the Mayor
and Inspector Moore?

634
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:04,010
Captain McKay, can you switch places
with Inspector Moore?

635
00:58:05,957 --> 00:58:07,447
Move in, nice and close.

636
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,720
And, Callahan, you get in there, too!

637
00:58:11,262 --> 00:58:12,422
We're ready.

638
00:58:12,497 --> 00:58:16,263
Inspector Moore is one of the first
of her sex in the whole country...

639
00:58:16,334 --> 00:58:19,201
...to become
a full-time homicide investigator.

640
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:23,340
And we're very proud
of her stunning professionalism.

641
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:26,744
Thank you very much.

642
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:31,113
Jimmy, do you want to...
Let me have some time with these people.

643
00:58:31,182 --> 00:58:32,012
Certainly.

644
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,074
Could we move off to the right.

645
00:58:34,152 --> 00:58:36,450
We'll see each other at the conference.

646
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:40,623
Now, anybody here have
the letters of commendation?

647
00:58:41,427 --> 00:58:43,122
- Jimmy?
- Yes, sir?

648
00:58:43,195 --> 00:58:45,789
- Who's got the letters?
- Right here, sir.

649
00:58:46,932 --> 00:58:49,901
- Wait a minute, what's this?
- These are some form letters.

650
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:53,600
They'll do, just so you hand them
something for the cameras.

651
00:58:53,672 --> 00:58:55,037
Well, all right.

652
00:58:55,107 --> 00:58:56,699
Thank you, Jimmy.

653
00:58:56,775 --> 00:59:01,508
The Mayor will introduce you,
hand you your letters of commendation...

654
00:59:01,614 --> 00:59:04,412
...and then you'll each move off to the left,
out of camera.

655
00:59:04,483 --> 00:59:06,747
And then I'm going to take
this opportunity...

656
00:59:06,819 --> 00:59:09,014
...to deliver a few boots in the rear...

657
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:12,854
...to those people who think
the police department has gone to hell...

658
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,158
...under this administration.

659
00:59:15,694 --> 00:59:17,252
Two minutes, Mr. Mayor.

660
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:19,160
Well, ready? Let's go.

661
00:59:22,635 --> 00:59:25,297
- Just one minute, Mr. Mayor.
- Harry!

662
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:28,665
Would you mind telling me
what these commendations are for?

663
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:31,505
- This can wait until after the broadcast.
- No, it can't.

664
00:59:31,577 --> 00:59:33,568
All right, just watch it, Callahan.

665
00:59:33,646 --> 00:59:37,811
The Inspector has a right to know
what he's being commended for.

666
00:59:38,418 --> 00:59:43,754
Specifically, it's for your part
in smashing the group of terrorists...

667
00:59:43,823 --> 00:59:48,624
...who were trying to blackmail
San Francisco out of $2 million.

668
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:50,060
Let's look at the...

669
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:53,327
If you're talking about the Mustapha bust,
nobody smashed anything.

670
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,059
What?

671
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:57,661
I made a deal with him. He was to help me
find out who the people were.

672
00:59:57,737 --> 01:00:01,138
- Inspector Moore and I weren't even there.
- What is he talking about?

673
01:00:01,207 --> 01:00:05,610
- No weapons or explosives were found.
- We'll find them.

674
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,171
The people are still out there.
They'll blow hell out of half this city.

675
01:00:09,249 --> 01:00:11,615
Meanwhile, you're telling everyone
how great we are.

676
01:00:11,685 --> 01:00:13,550
Button your lip. That's an order.

677
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:17,112
If you want to jerk these people off
you can, but don't do it with me.

678
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:19,954
Callahan, you just got yourself
a 60-day suspension.

679
01:00:20,026 --> 01:00:21,186
Make it 90.

680
01:00:21,261 --> 01:00:23,627
180. Give me your star.

681
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:29,065
Here's a seven-point suppository, Captain.

682
01:00:29,436 --> 01:00:31,064
What did you say?

683
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:33,299
I said stick it in your ass.

684
01:00:46,287 --> 01:00:49,723
- Mr. Mayor, you're on.
- I know, Jimmy, I know.

685
01:00:54,695 --> 01:00:56,822
I'll have to go down there and...

686
01:00:59,066 --> 01:01:02,058
Go down there and jerk them off.

687
01:01:10,244 --> 01:01:11,677
Inspector Callahan.

688
01:01:15,449 --> 01:01:17,440
Damn it, Harry, slow down.

689
01:01:23,023 --> 01:01:24,422
What's the matter?

690
01:01:24,759 --> 01:01:25,987
Nothing.

691
01:01:26,093 --> 01:01:28,927
Why aren't you up there
getting your commendation?

692
01:01:29,831 --> 01:01:31,492
You don't give up, do you?

693
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:32,897
Sometimes.

694
01:01:33,769 --> 01:01:34,997
Not you.

695
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:37,766
What makes you think so?

696
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,234
A woman's intuition.

697
01:01:45,046 --> 01:01:49,710
Listen. Harry, if you need anything
or if there's anything I can do...

698
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,384
...access to records or files...

699
01:01:52,888 --> 01:01:55,288
...anything, call me up.

700
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:58,482
I might just do that.

701
01:01:59,027 --> 01:02:00,085
Fine.

702
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:04,656
Anytime.

703
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,464
Come on, take a walk.

704
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,031
All right.

705
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:19,902
I was wondering if I'll still have a job
when I get back there.

706
01:02:20,148 --> 01:02:22,048
What difference does it make?

707
01:02:23,485 --> 01:02:25,886
What do you want to be a cop for, anyway?

708
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:29,752
Why aren't you married
and having kids like everybody else?

709
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:31,123
Why aren't you?

710
01:02:32,428 --> 01:02:34,794
Nobody in their right mind's asking.

711
01:02:37,233 --> 01:02:38,962
<i>Coitis interruptus.</i>

712
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:40,635
I beg your pardon?

713
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:43,797
Coit Tower, it's vaguely phallic,
don't you think?

714
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:48,835
I never thought of it that way.

715
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,070
I make up names for things.

716
01:02:52,148 --> 01:02:57,051
For instance, you're "Cold, bold Callahan
with his great big.44."

717
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:03,658
Every other cop in this city
is satisfied with a.38 or a 357.

718
01:03:03,726 --> 01:03:06,320
What do you have to carry that cannon for?

719
01:03:06,896 --> 01:03:09,262
So I can hit what I aim at, that's why.

720
01:03:09,465 --> 01:03:11,729
A 357 is a good weapon,
but I've seen.38s...

721
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:14,827
...careen off windshields.
No good in a city like this.

722
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:18,965
I see, so it's for the penetration?

723
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:23,578
Does everything have
a sexual connotation with you?

724
01:03:25,315 --> 01:03:26,839
Only sometimes.

725
01:03:28,418 --> 01:03:30,511
Want to go have a few beers?

726
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:39,458
You've got a lot of nerve
the way you talk to the Mayor.

727
01:03:39,529 --> 01:03:40,587
And McKay.

728
01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:43,825
Besides being wrong, they're stupid.

729
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:48,202
They arrested the wrong guy,
but their egos won't let them admit it.

730
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:50,764
- You mean Mustapha?
- Yeah.

731
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:54,302
I had a deal with Mustapha.

732
01:03:54,444 --> 01:03:58,608
He put me on to Bobby Maxwell, the guy
who knifed DiGeorgio, I'm sure of it.

733
01:03:58,682 --> 01:04:00,411
Where can we find Maxwell?

734
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:03,044
We can't, now with Mustapha busted,
can we?

735
01:04:04,254 --> 01:04:07,280
Maxwell's a prime candidate,
he's a real tough cookie.

736
01:04:07,357 --> 01:04:09,416
He was in Vietnam, likes combat.

737
01:04:09,493 --> 01:04:12,553
He was finally busted out
of the service on a Section 8.

738
01:04:12,629 --> 01:04:15,860
Well, we're good citizens,
why don't we post Mustapha's bail?

739
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:17,457
Not a bad idea.

740
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:20,967
Big question is: Will he work with us now?

741
01:04:23,274 --> 01:04:25,265
Want to have a couple of beers?

742
01:04:26,844 --> 01:04:28,641
Why didn't I think of that?

743
01:04:35,653 --> 01:04:38,121
Only thing they had worth drinking
was apple juice.

744
01:04:38,189 --> 01:04:39,952
- Anything's okay.
- Here.

745
01:04:40,024 --> 01:04:41,389
I'm sorry.

746
01:04:43,328 --> 01:04:44,955
You like fishing?

747
01:04:45,897 --> 01:04:49,162
I have an Auntie Kate, I'm called after her.

748
01:04:49,968 --> 01:04:53,665
When I was a little girl,
she had a ranch up in Oroville.

749
01:04:54,472 --> 01:04:57,964
We used to fish together,
I'd even bait my own hooks.

750
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:01,737
Is that what they call you, Kate?

751
01:05:02,914 --> 01:05:04,609
That or Inspector Moore.

752
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:11,053
Well, Inspector Moore, I don't like
to get too friendly with partners.

753
01:05:11,122 --> 01:05:13,989
I know. I mean I understand.

754
01:05:14,693 --> 01:05:15,682
Kate...

755
01:05:17,229 --> 01:05:21,325
...you know whoever draws you
as a partner could do a lot worse.

756
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,989
Mr. Mayor, I think if we want to beat
the crowd, we should leave now.

757
01:05:52,064 --> 01:05:55,795
You think so? You may be right.

758
01:05:55,968 --> 01:05:57,936
I'll see you, Karl.

759
01:05:58,003 --> 01:05:59,971
You don't have to come back to the office.

760
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,973
- Take over, fellas.
- Take it easy.

761
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:04,475
- You hold onto this.
- Sure thing.

762
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,481
- Nice to see you.
- We are running a little late, sir.

763
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,487
- Please, come on, sir.
- How you doing?

764
01:06:30,937 --> 01:06:32,734
All right, talk to me.

765
01:06:32,806 --> 01:06:33,898
He's on his way.

766
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:34,997
Beautiful.

767
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:38,309
- Everything set?
- I'm ready.

768
01:07:27,528 --> 01:07:28,654
Hi there.

769
01:07:28,996 --> 01:07:32,363
Well, hello there, young lady.
What can I do for you?

770
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,794
Raise the bridge.

771
01:07:36,537 --> 01:07:37,902
Raise the bridge?

772
01:07:39,206 --> 01:07:40,571
Are you kidding?

773
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:42,639
When I tell you to.

774
01:07:51,152 --> 01:07:52,915
I wish we could've stayed.

775
01:07:54,388 --> 01:07:56,913
I think the Giants
are gonna finally win one.

776
01:07:56,991 --> 01:08:01,451
I don't know, Mr. Mayor,
looks like it could end up as a no-hitter.

777
01:08:02,062 --> 01:08:04,656
Besides, you do have
a testimonial this evening.

778
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:09,227
God, testimonials.
They never end, do they?

779
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:15,133
Give me the Taser gun.

780
01:08:15,677 --> 01:08:16,871
Karl.

781
01:08:24,252 --> 01:08:27,346
<i>Man, this thing looks like something
from a James Bond movie.</i>

782
01:08:27,422 --> 01:08:29,014
Sure it'll work?

783
01:08:29,824 --> 01:08:32,759
Karl, there's 25,000 volts in this thing.

784
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:36,490
Even the fat boy's gonna do what we want
once we hook him up to it.

785
01:08:45,574 --> 01:08:46,666
Okay, Tex.

786
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:58,314
Raise it.

787
01:09:24,981 --> 01:09:27,211
What the hell! Dave, get me out of this.

788
01:09:33,656 --> 01:09:35,681
Don't hit the Mayor, goddamn it!

789
01:09:58,414 --> 01:10:00,542
Who the hell are you? What do you want?

790
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:01,675
You.

791
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:06,020
Get away from me, you son of a bitch!
I'm not going anywhere with you.

792
01:10:06,089 --> 01:10:08,080
The hell you aren't!

793
01:11:08,152 --> 01:11:12,680
<i>We're still trying to get details and
as they come in we'll get them to you.</i>

794
01:11:12,757 --> 01:11:15,954
<i>- Somebody said the Mayor was killed.
- That was the first report.</i>

795
01:11:16,027 --> 01:11:17,824
<i>Then we heard he was kidnapped.</i>

796
01:11:17,895 --> 01:11:21,490
<i>There's something heavy going on
in China Basin, that's for sure.</i>

797
01:11:21,566 --> 01:11:24,160
<i>Okay, listen, I've got to go.
Thanks for calling.</i>

798
01:11:24,235 --> 01:11:26,203
<i>You're rapping with Bubba, go ahead.</i>

799
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:29,364
The Mayor of this pig city
has been taken prisoner of war...

800
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,965
...by the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force.

801
01:11:34,245 --> 01:11:37,510
<i>Everybody's a comedian tonight.
Look, this is very serious.</i>

802
01:11:38,383 --> 01:11:39,782
Hey, man, look...

803
01:11:39,851 --> 01:11:43,082
...l'm leaving a tape of our demands
in the booth across the street.

804
01:11:43,888 --> 01:11:45,651
<i>Power to the people!</i>

805
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:49,822
<i>Okay, we're gonna do a little music
and I'll be right back.</i>

806
01:12:09,782 --> 01:12:10,942
Harry?

807
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:15,619
- What can I do for you?
- We've got to talk.

808
01:12:15,954 --> 01:12:17,478
Go right ahead.

809
01:12:19,258 --> 01:12:22,716
I want all the information
that you have on this case, Callahan.

810
01:12:23,395 --> 01:12:27,491
- Black militants, remember?
- Come on, Harry, so we were wrong.

811
01:12:29,234 --> 01:12:32,499
- I'll handle this one.
- No. We play as a team.

812
01:12:34,673 --> 01:12:38,939
As I remember, the last time we played
as a team I got the cue stuck in my ass.

813
01:12:39,011 --> 01:12:42,845
Harry, we just got a tape,
this time they're asking for $5 million.

814
01:12:42,915 --> 01:12:45,884
Or they send back the Mayor,
one piece at a time.

815
01:12:45,951 --> 01:12:48,579
The negotiations
are at a crucial point right now.

816
01:12:48,654 --> 01:12:51,283
What are you going to do,
pay the bastards?

817
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:56,228
Well, the Mayor's family is loaded,
they can afford it.

818
01:12:57,530 --> 01:13:01,193
What about the people who were killed?
Or isn't it against the law anymore?

819
01:13:01,267 --> 01:13:04,430
We're not debating the point,
I'm simply saying you're out of it.

820
01:13:04,504 --> 01:13:05,562
What you're saying is:

821
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:09,836
Whoever's got balls to grab a hostage,
will do it. And can walk away from it.

822
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,471
I'm saying, you're out of it.

823
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:16,242
If I hear otherwise,
you're finished as a cop in San Francisco.

824
01:13:16,449 --> 01:13:22,183
I want every bit of information you have
on this case, every lead. Is that clear?

825
01:13:22,388 --> 01:13:24,856
- May I make a statement, McKay?
- Go ahead!

826
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,282
Your mouthwash ain't making it!

827
01:13:45,913 --> 01:13:48,347
You got any more surprises for me today?

828
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,641
What do you mean?

829
01:13:50,985 --> 01:13:53,215
I mean, are you and McKay
going to throw...

830
01:13:53,287 --> 01:13:56,279
...another one
of those paddy-wagon parties for me?

831
01:13:58,259 --> 01:14:01,194
That frigging McKay,
he's something, isn't he?

832
01:14:02,096 --> 01:14:05,463
Now, I want a line
on this Revolutionary Strike Force.

833
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,700
You got to be kidding.

834
01:14:09,036 --> 01:14:10,560
No, I'm not kidding.

835
01:14:10,638 --> 01:14:13,664
If you don't give it to me,
I'll let it out that you're an ear.

836
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:17,142
Don't say that, not even joking.

837
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,048
Who's joking?

838
01:14:23,684 --> 01:14:27,381
You really are a dirty bastard,
ain't you, Harry?

839
01:14:28,055 --> 01:14:29,283
The dirtiest.

840
01:14:34,428 --> 01:14:36,988
Word has it that Bobby Maxwell and this...

841
01:14:37,898 --> 01:14:39,229
...chick, Wanda...

842
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,929
...they're running around
with these dudes who call themselves...

843
01:14:43,004 --> 01:14:46,235
...the People's Revolutionary Strike Force.

844
01:14:46,308 --> 01:14:47,434
"Call themselves."

845
01:14:47,509 --> 01:14:50,307
They don't believe in that shit.

846
01:14:50,745 --> 01:14:54,579
They're just interested in the bread,
that's where their head's at.

847
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:57,043
Where do I find this Wanda?

848
01:14:57,218 --> 01:15:01,882
She's a tall brunette,
works at Tiffany's on Broadway.

849
01:15:04,593 --> 01:15:05,787
Thanks.

850
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:12,160
Do them in.

851
01:15:13,268 --> 01:15:15,293
You can count on that.

852
01:15:45,768 --> 01:15:46,860
Hi there.

853
01:15:46,936 --> 01:15:49,700
- Is this Tiffany's?
- Like the sign says.

854
01:15:49,772 --> 01:15:51,399
My name is Larry Dickman...

855
01:15:51,474 --> 01:15:54,272
...my brother was here last week.
Tall fella, balding.

856
01:15:54,343 --> 01:15:55,708
Remember him well.

857
01:15:55,778 --> 01:15:57,803
Has a gold tooth right in front.

858
01:15:57,947 --> 01:15:59,278
That's him.

859
01:16:01,484 --> 01:16:03,748
You know what I bet you'd like.

860
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,021
I bet you'd like to learn the love tussle.

861
01:16:07,356 --> 01:16:11,087
That sounds swell,
but I was looking for a certain girl.

862
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:13,685
We've got a whole bunch of them,
warm and willing.

863
01:16:13,763 --> 01:16:15,958
- Her name's Wanda.
- Anybody you want.

864
01:16:16,032 --> 01:16:18,330
My brother says she's terrific.

865
01:16:18,467 --> 01:16:19,661
Can I trust you?

866
01:16:19,735 --> 01:16:20,827
Yeah.

867
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:23,404
What it is, is $75.

868
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:25,164
$75?

869
01:16:25,241 --> 01:16:27,573
Of course, that includes...

870
01:16:29,378 --> 01:16:33,246
We're not supposed to do this,
you understand, because the heat is on...

871
01:16:33,315 --> 01:16:35,510
...but seeing your brother was here...

872
01:16:36,887 --> 01:16:40,254
...the $75 includes personal instructions...

873
01:16:40,323 --> 01:16:43,292
...in 32 positions of lovemaking.

874
01:16:43,827 --> 01:16:45,192
That many?

875
01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:49,997
$75, you pay me first.

876
01:16:51,001 --> 01:16:52,366
Oh, yeah.

877
01:16:59,509 --> 01:17:00,999
Right this way.

878
01:17:11,855 --> 01:17:12,879
What's this?

879
01:17:12,956 --> 01:17:16,414
You've heard of a tackling dummy,
well, it's the same principle.

880
01:17:17,561 --> 01:17:21,088
I see, for $75 you get to make it
with a rubber dolly.

881
01:17:21,164 --> 01:17:22,756
Thirty-two ways!

882
01:17:22,999 --> 01:17:24,489
Any objections?

883
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:27,503
No, is there one
where the man gets on top?

884
01:17:27,704 --> 01:17:28,671
Thirty-three!

885
01:17:29,573 --> 01:17:32,839
Just take your duds off, honey.
I'll send your teacher in.

886
01:17:37,915 --> 01:17:39,177
Hi there.

887
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:40,681
You're not Wanda.

888
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:43,653
Well, these are the breaks. Needs air.

889
01:17:44,055 --> 01:17:46,649
Can't hump a limp dummy, I always say.

890
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,390
Speaking of limp dummies,
hadn't you better strip?

891
01:17:52,463 --> 01:17:53,760
Where's Wanda?

892
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:56,356
Beats the hell out of me, Tom.

893
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,038
Now, I'm gonna ask you just one last time.

894
01:18:05,109 --> 01:18:08,169
- Where's Wanda?
- I don't know.

895
01:18:08,412 --> 01:18:10,846
She left here a couple of weeks ago.

896
01:18:10,915 --> 01:18:13,884
Ask Buchinsky.
He runs the whole damn street.

897
01:18:13,985 --> 01:18:17,614
- Where do I find this Buchinsky?
- Down the hall, to the right.

898
01:19:03,769 --> 01:19:06,067
<i>That's right, my friends,
nearer my God to thee.</i>

899
01:19:06,138 --> 01:19:08,038
<i>That's why brother Bob is here.</i>

900
01:19:08,106 --> 01:19:10,700
<i>Brother Bob is here
to bring you nearer to the Lord.</i>

901
01:19:10,776 --> 01:19:13,768
<i>To bring you nearer to the man.
To save your soul.</i>

902
01:19:13,912 --> 01:19:16,073
<i>Salvation is where it is at, brother.</i>

903
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:20,412
You're trespassing.
This is private property.

904
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:23,621
- You a lawyer?
- Seeing as you ask, yes, I am.

905
01:19:23,689 --> 01:19:26,180
I'm looking for a tall brunette,
named Wanda.

906
01:19:26,759 --> 01:19:30,752
I want to tell you something, punk.
This is a protected operation.

907
01:19:30,997 --> 01:19:34,160
Now, you can end up with your balls
in spaghetti sauce.

908
01:19:34,234 --> 01:19:37,328
Are you trying to say you've a lot of clout
with the syndicate?

909
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:41,464
Enough to blow you away with one call.
Now get the hell out of here!

910
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:46,137
I'll tell you what you are to me.
Just a maggot who sells dirty pictures.

911
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,925
- Wanda, where is she?
- Go to hell.

912
01:20:10,036 --> 01:20:13,494
- One more time, Wanda.
- All right, all right.

913
01:20:15,842 --> 01:20:18,777
She quit a couple of weeks ago,
that's all I know.

914
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,879
She got religious.

915
01:20:23,016 --> 01:20:26,453
- What do you mean?
- Hanging around the church on Garvey.

916
01:20:31,525 --> 01:20:33,959
<i>Captain, is it true
you received another ransom tape...</i>

917
01:20:34,028 --> 01:20:36,258
<i>... from the People's Revolutionary
Strike Force?</i>

918
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,491
<i>- Yes, we have.
- Is the Mayor all right?</i>

919
01:20:38,565 --> 01:20:42,865
<i>We have been assured that he's okay
but, of course, there won't be...</i>

920
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,901
<i>... any payment or arrangement
for transportation until we have...</i>

921
01:20:46,974 --> 01:20:48,839
<i>... seen the Mayor with our own eyes.</i>

922
01:20:48,909 --> 01:20:52,504
<i>- Then you're letting the kidnappers go?
- That is the agreement.</i>

923
01:20:52,579 --> 01:20:55,844
<i>- Any idea where they are holed up?
- Not yet...</i>

924
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:59,716
<i>... but we should get one more message
this evening. If you'll excuse me.</i>

925
01:20:59,887 --> 01:21:03,084
<i>Is it true that Inspector Callahan
has been taken off this case?</i>

926
01:21:03,157 --> 01:21:04,988
<i>I'm sorry, no more questions.</i>

927
01:21:14,034 --> 01:21:15,126
What do you have?

928
01:21:15,202 --> 01:21:19,400
I got the priest, John Voss, Father John,
very militant, very big in prison reform.

929
01:21:19,473 --> 01:21:24,309
He runs rehabilitation seminars
in all the prisons in this area.

930
01:21:24,379 --> 01:21:27,678
This is a list of the prisoners
that took the seminar in San Quentin.

931
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:30,377
Bobby Maxwell never missed a session.

932
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:33,580
- You wait here.
- Wait, wait.

933
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:36,886
Fessenheim. The latest ransom tape
mentioned Fessenheim again.

934
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,653
And what does that mean?

935
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:42,891
Last year, two bombs were exploded
at a nuclear plant near Fessenheim, France.

936
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:46,557
How about that.

937
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:57,368
The body of Christ.

938
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,379
The body of Christ.

939
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,150
The body...

940
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,188
Remember me, Father?

941
01:22:12,794 --> 01:22:13,783
Yes.

942
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,092
What is it you want, Callahan?

943
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,690
I'd like to talk to you
about Bobby Maxwell.

944
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,226
Then get a warrant.

945
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:44,047
- Just a minute.
- I thought I made it clear to you, Officer.

946
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:46,458
I have nothing whatsoever to say to you.

947
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:51,723
And what right do you have to come
in here and harass me in my church?

948
01:22:52,668 --> 01:22:55,967
- Is that a confessional over there?
- You want to make a confession?

949
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:58,734
You first!

950
01:23:00,776 --> 01:23:02,505
Where the hell's Maxwell?

951
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,872
God just might forgive you, but I won't.

952
01:23:04,947 --> 01:23:08,246
Why do you protect these people?
Do you know how many they've killed?

953
01:23:08,317 --> 01:23:11,878
Sacrifices have to be made, mister.

954
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,952
These people are at war!

955
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:15,252
So am I.

956
01:23:15,826 --> 01:23:18,886
How dare you pull a gun
in the house of God.

957
01:23:18,962 --> 01:23:21,123
If you don't believe in the sanctity...

958
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:24,395
I don't have time
to argue religion with you, boy.

959
01:23:32,542 --> 01:23:35,033
Look at her hands!

960
01:23:44,788 --> 01:23:48,349
- There wasn't supposed to be any killing.
- Is she dead?

961
01:23:54,965 --> 01:23:56,660
I close my eyes to this.

962
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:01,867
Father in heaven, help me.

963
01:24:01,938 --> 01:24:04,065
You can't close your eyes anymore.

964
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:08,272
Now, where's Maxwell?

965
01:24:20,791 --> 01:24:22,053
Alcatraz.

966
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,450
A place to hole up.

967
01:24:26,264 --> 01:24:29,131
I don't suppose
it would do any good to suggest...

968
01:24:30,902 --> 01:24:32,392
Forget it.

969
01:24:35,706 --> 01:24:38,641
<i>No further communications
have been received since the last...</i>

970
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:42,873
Nothing. You sure Wanda
got those tapes to the cops?

971
01:24:43,347 --> 01:24:45,838
Bobby, I don't know.

972
01:24:46,817 --> 01:24:49,581
I don't know, I don't... I wasn't with her.

973
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:58,155
- If you didn't think she could do it...
- Shut up!

974
01:24:58,229 --> 01:25:00,891
- What are you doing here?
- A lousy cup of coffee, okay?

975
01:25:10,776 --> 01:25:13,244
Hey, can't you see it says no trespassing?

976
01:25:15,214 --> 01:25:17,079
Get the hell out of here.

977
01:25:20,586 --> 01:25:23,612
Jesus Christ, man, get your ass out there!

978
01:26:22,448 --> 01:26:23,642
Lalo.

979
01:26:23,716 --> 01:26:26,651
Let's get the Mayor.
We'll bring him in here and hold out.

980
01:28:40,688 --> 01:28:43,782
I'll get the bar.
You get that son of a bitch out of there.

981
01:28:58,340 --> 01:28:59,466
Freeze!

982
01:29:01,143 --> 01:29:04,010
All right, let him go.

983
01:29:06,015 --> 01:29:09,781
Move over there, Your Honor. That's fine.

984
01:29:11,821 --> 01:29:15,780
Okay, now, I want you very slowly...

985
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:18,827
...to put down that weapon...

986
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:21,855
...and then on the deck,
and spread your legs.

987
01:29:24,066 --> 01:29:25,795
Are you kidding me?

988
01:29:26,335 --> 01:29:29,896
You laugh at me, you bastard,
and I'll shoot you where you stand.

989
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:45,509
Let's go, Your Honor. Let's go!

990
01:29:45,788 --> 01:29:48,882
Let's get out of here. Now speed it up!

991
01:29:50,392 --> 01:29:51,917
Stay with me.

992
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:53,760
Hold it.

993
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:56,697
Just take it very easy.

994
01:29:58,335 --> 01:30:02,601
You relax, do just as I say,
and I'll get you home, all right?

995
01:30:02,672 --> 01:30:03,570
Yes.

996
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:07,235
All right, take it slow. Wait a minute.

997
01:30:08,979 --> 01:30:10,344
Here we go.

998
01:30:43,547 --> 01:30:44,980
Harry, look out!

999
01:31:06,304 --> 01:31:09,364
Oh, Harry, I messed up.

1000
01:31:09,574 --> 01:31:11,303
You're doing just fine, Kate.

1001
01:31:11,375 --> 01:31:13,070
Let me get you out of here.

1002
01:31:16,881 --> 01:31:19,975
Don't concern yourself, Harry.

1003
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:28,620
Get him.

1004
01:31:35,333 --> 01:31:36,960
You can count on it.

1005
01:32:09,868 --> 01:32:11,733
You fucking fruit!

1006
01:32:20,145 --> 01:32:21,635
Get up there!

1007
01:32:25,517 --> 01:32:27,178
Go on, move!

1008
01:32:49,175 --> 01:32:50,972
Oh, God!

1009
01:33:30,683 --> 01:33:34,119
Callahan, you saved my life.

1010
01:33:35,455 --> 01:33:39,586
I'll never be able to thank you.
I'll never be able to tell you.

1011
01:33:39,660 --> 01:33:43,653
There will be a letter of commendation
there for you.

1012
01:34:03,383 --> 01:34:05,112
The chopper's here.

1013
01:34:05,886 --> 01:34:08,753
Don't you want to ride...

1014
01:34:43,625 --> 01:34:44,853
<i>Maxwell.</i>

1015
01:34:45,326 --> 01:34:49,422
<i>Bobby Maxwell,
this is Captain McKay speaking.</i>

1016
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:51,994
<i>We have your money.</i>

1017
01:34:53,001 --> 01:34:55,993
<i>A plane is waiting for you at the airport.</i>

1018
01:34:56,871 --> 01:35:00,034
<i>We have acceded to all your demands...</i>

1019
01:35:00,675 --> 01:35:02,609
<i>... so release the Mayor.</i>

1020
01:35:03,411 --> 01:35:07,404
<i>The pilot of this helicopter
will fly you and your men to safety.</i>
