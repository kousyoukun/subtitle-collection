1
00:00:49,323 --> 00:00:53,753
<i>There is something about it...</i>

2
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:55,261
<i>a sunset.</i>

3
00:00:57,165 --> 00:00:59,661
<i>That burning ball of light.</i>

4
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:04,962
<i>A force of nature,
like time itself.</i>

5
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:11,936
<i>When it starts to fade
and darkness falls...</i>

6
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:16,182
<i>It makes you feel insignificant.</i>

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,286
<i>I must own my demons.</i>

8
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:26,621
<i>And deep down,
all I ask for is...</i>

9
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:29,295
<i>forgiveness.</i>

10
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,223
Wassup with it?

11
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:57,174
That's my dawg.
Who gettin' dropped?

12
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,418
Who you got? You hear me?

13
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,914
I got five
on the little kid, eh?

14
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,421
All right, let's see that money.

15
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,566
Good?
Good?

16
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,864
Yeah, let's scrap!

17
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:18,700
Let's go, baby.

18
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:19,866
Yeah, get in there!

19
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,066
Kick him.

20
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:23,606
Whoo, look at him go!

21
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, man.

22
00:03:30,649 --> 00:03:32,209
- Son!
- Oh!

23
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:35,288
Get your hands up, son!

24
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,525
Bitch, let's do this!

25
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,057
From below, man, from below!

26
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,829
Get in there!
- Man, that's easy money!

27
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,997
He don't want no more!

28
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:56,343
- Ground him!
- Yeah!

29
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,906
Take him there!
Right, take him!

30
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:01,743
All right, let's go, let's go!
Break that motherfucker's ass!

31
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,781
You gonna take that, Stray?
Let's go, baby.

32
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:08,420
Get up, motherfucker!
Come on, man!

33
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,490
Get down!

34
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:13,282
- Yeah!
- Gonna bust him!

35
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:19,255
Oh, shit!
He's fucking broken!

36
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,165
Oh, yeah, motherfucker,
drag him!

37
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,266
Oh, yeah!
Get that motherfucker.

38
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,168
Choke his ass!
Kill him!

39
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,874
Let's go, Stray.
Let's go, Stray.

40
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:09,415
'Ima break you
on somethin', Stray!

41
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:10,812
I got you, kid.

42
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:12,077
I got you.

43
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,420
I lost
all my fucking money, man.

44
00:05:13,454 --> 00:05:15,653
That's some bullshit!

45
00:05:15,687 --> 00:05:20,151
Hey, Estelle,
I think I found your guy.

46
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,002
Right, then at least,
like, 20 though.

47
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:45,418
Hey.

48
00:05:45,454 --> 00:05:46,947
I'm here to see Estelle.

49
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:48,718
Arm's up.

50
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:56,793
He's coming up.

51
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:10,807
Go make some noise!

52
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,942
We got that DJ goin' in
with some heat!

53
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,504
Sit here.

54
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,269
Hey, sweetie.

55
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,271
- Can I just get a beer?
- Yeah.

56
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:50,516
Here you go.

57
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,917
I want tequila<i> por fa!</i>

58
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:12,362
- Hey.
- Hey.

59
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,298
I haven't seen you
in here before.

60
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,478
It's not really
my type of place.

61
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,911
Did you get kicked out
of your regular spot?

62
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,112
I'm Lexus.

63
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:27,487
You wanna dance?

64
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,481
I'm sorry, I'm not
really much of a dancer.

65
00:07:32,516 --> 00:07:35,826
I mean, I could, uh,

66
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,959
probably bust out
a worm or something,

67
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:40,665
but it doesn't really look
like there's enough space,

68
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,634
you know?

69
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,802
What's your name?

70
00:07:44,836 --> 00:07:46,331
I'm Stray.

71
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,233
Hey.

72
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,401
Let's go.

73
00:07:52,108 --> 00:07:53,579
Sorry.

74
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:58,507
You got a cell?

75
00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:00,653
You want to book me,
you can go out the club.

76
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:04,019
Look, I don't really
know what that means.

77
00:08:04,053 --> 00:08:06,021
Can I just take you out?

78
00:08:06,055 --> 00:08:07,528
Get something to eat?

79
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,420
Go somewhere
with a bit more space?

80
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:11,487
Yo?

81
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,093
You didn't fucking hear me?

82
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:41,859
Yeah.

83
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:45,664
We've all heard what
Freddie's doing in midtown.

84
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,096
Right.

85
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,197
Well, that's cute.

86
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:55,938
He has to understand that
it's still my territory.

87
00:08:55,974 --> 00:08:57,379
If they don't want
to play by the rules,

88
00:08:57,403 --> 00:08:59,503
they can't play the game.

89
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,847
Sorry about that.

90
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:11,217
You like games, Stray?

91
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:12,791
Nah.

92
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:14,287
No?

93
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,794
How about we play one?

94
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,125
Humor me.

95
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,063
Russian roulette?

96
00:09:22,099 --> 00:09:24,066
No, I'm kidding.

97
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,937
We'll start
with something easy...

98
00:09:26,971 --> 00:09:28,971
basic.

99
00:09:29,006 --> 00:09:30,808
Truth or dare?

100
00:09:33,274 --> 00:09:36,649
Truth... or dare?

101
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:41,116
Truth.

102
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:44,625
Truth.

103
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,706
You've been making
quite a name for yourself

104
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,520
in the yard fights.

105
00:09:51,831 --> 00:09:53,831
Do you find knocking out bums
for pocket change

106
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,197
a sustainable way
to make a living?

107
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,072
Truthfully.

108
00:10:17,923 --> 00:10:19,692
Mm.

109
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,899
Those eyes.

110
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:33,234
I used to be like you.

111
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:34,873
A fighter.

112
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,845
Although back then,
I couldn't defend myself.

113
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:44,850
I can give you something
worth fighting for.

114
00:10:52,123 --> 00:10:53,759
Your ride is here.

115
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:57,225
Cuda, he's out front.

116
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:01,591
Hey, Stray.

117
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:05,398
You fight for me,
I fight for you.

118
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,104
It's a simple offer.

119
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,567
I dare you to take it.

120
00:11:36,398 --> 00:11:37,738
Hey.

121
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,104
You Cuda?

122
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,870
It's a nice car.

123
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,769
I mean, everybody knows
about the Challenger,

124
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,277
but the Barracuda's
slept on if you ask me.

125
00:12:32,157 --> 00:12:35,025
That lady, she didn't
mention anything about money.

126
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,941
<i>At least 23 people
were shot outside a nightclub.</i>

127
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:51,107
<i>Two of the victims have died.</i>

128
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:53,307
<i>Two others
in critical condition.</i>

129
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:05,616
<i>Men wearing masks jumped out
of an SUV, sprayed the crowd...</i>

130
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,037
You gonna fill me in?

131
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,471
Ronnie Fennech.

132
00:13:24,505 --> 00:13:25,769
Gambling debts.

133
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:30,950
- The "South Beach Slugger."
- Mm-hmm.

134
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:34,349
And a huge motherfucker.

135
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,389
Why don't you go
and introduce yourself?

136
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:06,711
Hey.

137
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,813
You got a light?

138
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:38,248
Sorry.

139
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:50,963
<i>Hey!</i>

140
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:52,460
<i>Who the fuck do you think
you are?</i>

141
00:14:52,495 --> 00:14:53,592
<i>Young fucking punk!</i>

142
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,133
<i>You got me with a cheap shot!</i>

143
00:14:55,168 --> 00:14:57,827
<i>Goddamn motherfucker.</i>

144
00:15:02,043 --> 00:15:03,570
<i>Wait till I get my hands on you.</i>

145
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,764
<i>You goddamn motherfucker!</i>

146
00:15:49,386 --> 00:15:51,881
<i>I got asthma!
It's real fucking bad.</i>

147
00:15:51,917 --> 00:15:54,884
Hey.
Hey!

148
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,327
Ha!

149
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,894
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.
You hear me?

150
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:07,039
Motherfucker.
You're a dead man!

151
00:16:07,075 --> 00:16:08,470
You're a dead man, motherfucker!

152
00:16:08,504 --> 00:16:10,571
You're a dead man.
I'm a made man.

153
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,144
You know who you fucking with?

154
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,509
I'm Ronnie fucking Fennech,
motherfucker.

155
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,708
Welterweight champion
of the world, you understand?

156
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:20,152
- Is that right?
- Cuda?

157
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,351
Ronnie, tonight you are nobody.

158
00:16:22,386 --> 00:16:25,091
Cuda?
When did you get out?

159
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,751
Man, I didn't do nothing,
I swear.

160
00:16:26,787 --> 00:16:28,731
I'm gonna get the money,
all right, I'll pay her back.

161
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,491
I'll pay her back, I swear.

162
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:32,989
I did everything she asked
while you were locked up.

163
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:35,024
Call Estelle.
Call Estelle!

164
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:36,365
She knows me, man.
She knows me.

165
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,500
You know me.
- I know I know you.

166
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:39,995
I know you.

167
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,000
You know, and everybody knows
that normally,

168
00:16:44,034 --> 00:16:46,277
you have been
where I am right now.

169
00:16:46,312 --> 00:16:48,037
Yeah.

170
00:16:48,072 --> 00:16:51,908
And also, you know
that where I am now

171
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:54,450
there is no space
for mercy, Ronnie.

172
00:16:54,485 --> 00:16:55,946
Cuda, please man.

173
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,980
Please!
- Fuck you!

174
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,464
He never did shut the fuck up.

175
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:16,031
You wanna pray or something?

176
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:37,823
Golf?

177
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:40,595
Golf.

178
00:18:00,188 --> 00:18:02,319
<i>Yes, yes, I'm coming.</i>

179
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,689
Cuda.

180
00:18:08,723 --> 00:18:10,426
Olivia.

181
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:12,825
Not like you to have company.

182
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,959
Hm?

183
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:21,669
So just 100 balls for you
and that bad boy out back?

184
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,673
What time is it?

185
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:30,105
3:30.

186
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,041
No, Olivia.

187
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:33,713
What time is it?

188
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:36,221
Well, now that you
asked me like that,

189
00:18:36,257 --> 00:18:38,488
I think my watch is broken.

190
00:18:38,522 --> 00:18:39,653
11:30.

191
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,019
That's right.

192
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,527
Sure thing, sweetheart.

193
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:47,332
You know I always
got your balls, Cuda.

194
00:18:49,731 --> 00:18:51,731
You want to tell me
what we're doing here?

195
00:18:56,166 --> 00:19:00,443
You know golf is about patience.

196
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:04,316
Timing.

197
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:12,048
Keeping your cool.

198
00:19:13,624 --> 00:19:16,460
Obviously, you lack
all of these qualities.

199
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:23,202
- Shit's goofy.
- Yeah.

200
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:48,260
Awesome.

201
00:19:49,891 --> 00:19:53,332
I want my money,
not a fucking golf lesson.

202
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:06,740
If someone ask you
where you were tonight...

203
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,106
Psst, hey...

204
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:14,077
- Golf.
- That's right.

205
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,114
Now get the fuck out of here.

206
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,448
But changing topic,
how was Warren?

207
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:44,811
- Oh, nah.
- Really?

208
00:20:44,846 --> 00:20:46,252
- Totally, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- What did you do?

209
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:47,980
I don't want to talk about it.

210
00:20:48,015 --> 00:20:49,015
- Why not?
- No, no, no.

211
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,785
How was class?

212
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,622
Well, Donny was messing
around like usual.

213
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:55,295
Oh, my God.

214
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:58,627
Dad?

215
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:00,333
That's your dad?

216
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,598
Wasn't he supposed
to be in jail?

217
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:03,842
I'll catch up
with you later, okay?

218
00:21:03,865 --> 00:21:04,832
Give me a sec.

219
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:06,471
Okay, see you.

220
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,202
Hey, Lola.

221
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,808
How are you, baby?

222
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,142
Whoa.

223
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,978
What is that on your nose?

224
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,782
I got it pierced.

225
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:22,981
When?

226
00:21:23,017 --> 00:21:25,490
What are you doing here?

227
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:27,690
Well, I just wanted
to come and see you.

228
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,692
I have some tacos.

229
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:32,959
I don't eat that stuff anymore.

230
00:21:32,993 --> 00:21:34,796
I'm vegan.

231
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,368
Since when?

232
00:21:36,403 --> 00:21:37,798
I mean... I'm sorry.

233
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,734
I'm sorry, uh...

234
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:41,538
God, you're...

235
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:45,642
I mean, you're growing up
so quick, you know?

236
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:50,173
Uh, what do you think
if we just, uh, take a drive

237
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:51,647
and I don't know,
just somewhere,

238
00:21:51,682 --> 00:21:53,815
just to spend
some time together.

239
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:57,181
Uh, no, my bus is here.

240
00:21:57,215 --> 00:21:59,820
Yeah, that's right, uh...

241
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:02,185
Well, your birthday
is coming up.

242
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:07,663
This is a special one.

243
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:10,435
What makes this one
any different?

244
00:22:10,471 --> 00:22:13,328
You've missed all the others.

245
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,104
All right, uh, listen.

246
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,336
Take this.

247
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,878
I thought you...
You may need a dress

248
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,781
or something for your party.

249
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,084
I got to go.

250
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,052
Yeah.

251
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,186
I love you.

252
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,561
Thank you.

253
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,701
There you go.
Thank you.

254
00:23:59,976 --> 00:24:01,008
I saw you!

255
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,548
- I didn't take anything.
- Give me this!

256
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,178
I didn't take anything!
Stop!

257
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:09,378
Give me my bag back please!
I didn't take anything.

258
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:12,282
Give me my bag.
- I'm calling the police!

259
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:14,482
You are a thief!
- Hey, ladies.

260
00:24:14,518 --> 00:24:17,123
- Lady, let go!
- Lady, lady, lady, lady, lady.

261
00:24:17,157 --> 00:24:18,894
Hey, there is no need for that.

262
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:20,455
I'll take care...
- But she's a thief!

263
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,458
I know.
I'll take care of her, you know?

264
00:24:22,492 --> 00:24:26,968
This... this should
cover everything, all right?

265
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:29,673
You fine with that?
Yes, you are.

266
00:24:29,709 --> 00:24:31,576
For that price,
I'm gonna take even this shirt.

267
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:33,909
All right?
Okay, good.

268
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:40,047
Hey, uh...

269
00:24:40,082 --> 00:24:42,917
take this.

270
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,051
Are you okay?

271
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:47,659
Thanks for bailing me out.

272
00:24:47,693 --> 00:24:49,792
Where are you from?

273
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:54,830
Atlanta.

274
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,932
Well, that's
a long way from home.

275
00:24:57,968 --> 00:24:59,395
What's your name?

276
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:03,169
Billie.

277
00:25:03,203 --> 00:25:05,038
I am Cuda.

278
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:06,546
I am from Miami.

279
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,749
How old are you?
- 18.

280
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:16,885
- Really?
- 15.

281
00:25:16,921 --> 00:25:18,117
I'm kinda hungry.

282
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:20,692
Is there, like, a Wendy's
or something around here?

283
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,924
Yeah, something.

284
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,191
What type of foods do you like?

285
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,698
Um, I'll eat anything.

286
00:25:26,732 --> 00:25:29,393
Anything.
Anything is good.

287
00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:35,201
Yo, Eric!

288
00:25:35,236 --> 00:25:36,740
It's me, Stray.

289
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,615
Bro, I can hear you.

290
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:46,376
Look, I got your money,
like a whole month's rent.

291
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,478
<i>- Bullshit.</i>
- I ain't playing.

292
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:49,919
I got it all.

293
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:53,482
<i>Slide the money under the door.</i>

294
00:25:53,518 --> 00:25:55,958
For real?
Just open the door, Eric.

295
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,961
<i>Under the fucking door!</i>

296
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:11,137
<i>Keep it coming!</i>

297
00:26:14,374 --> 00:26:16,143
There, that's 500.

298
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:18,178
Now, give me my keys.

299
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:21,115
<i>Wait!</i>

300
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,416
You fuck me one more time,

301
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:28,353
and I burn
your goddamn mattress,

302
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,519
you fuck!

303
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:33,864
You look like shit.

304
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,498
- See you around, Eric.
- Yeah,<i> vlaka.</i>

305
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:55,115
Hey, I got
that crystal you like.

306
00:27:05,326 --> 00:27:07,865
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

307
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,701
<i>First new message.</i>

308
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:12,462
<i>Hey, Jimmy Magner here
from pax civil.</i>

309
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,234
<i>I just want to say that we
won't be having any more work.</i>

310
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:17,633
<i>Sorry to do this to
you at such late notice</i>

311
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:19,239
<i>but um, good luck with it all.</i>

312
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,846
<i>Next message.</i>

313
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:24,750
<i>Hey, this is Lexus.</i>

314
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:27,147
<i>I got a missed call
from this number,</i>

315
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:29,315
<i>so I'm callin' back.</i>

316
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,480
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

317
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:32,086
<i>End of new messages.</i>

318
00:27:38,028 --> 00:27:39,996
All right.

319
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,967
Best tacos in Little Havana.

320
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:49,532
And even better
with salsa verde over here.

321
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:56,947
Mmm.

322
00:27:56,981 --> 00:27:59,212
Yeah.
This is fire.

323
00:27:59,248 --> 00:28:02,347
They're not supposed
to be that hot, you know.

324
00:28:05,715 --> 00:28:07,958
No, fire means like,
"It's amazing."

325
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:11,192
That's right.
"Fire."

326
00:28:11,227 --> 00:28:12,588
Mm-hmm.

327
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,693
Back up! Back up off me!

328
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:20,971
Back up! Motherfucker.
Fuck you, bitch!

329
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:24,369
Um, where's your mother?

330
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,372
She's dead.

331
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:27,747
I'm sorry.

332
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:30,079
How?

333
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:32,817
She was on the pipe.

334
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:37,823
And I went to foster care
but um, the man that um...

335
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:42,090
I had to get out of there.

336
00:28:43,654 --> 00:28:46,127
Fuck y'all going?

337
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:52,332
- Do you have any kids?
- Yeah.

338
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:54,234
A daughter.
- Mm.

339
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:56,237
Just your age.

340
00:28:56,271 --> 00:28:57,435
What's her name?

341
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:59,669
- Lola.
- Mm.

342
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:02,441
- Her birthday's next week.
- 16?

343
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:04,145
- Yeah.
- Oh.

344
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:11,285
Can I ask you, um, what would
you want for your birthday?

345
00:29:13,817 --> 00:29:17,125
16 is the shit.
Well, what does she like?

346
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:24,759
Well, whatever it is,
just make sure that it comes

347
00:29:24,795 --> 00:29:26,102
from your heart, you know?

348
00:29:26,136 --> 00:29:27,905
Like something
only you can give her.

349
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:37,949
Billie, um...

350
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:42,151
these streets are not safe
for a girl your age.

351
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:45,286
Is there anywhere
I can take you?

352
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,750
A friend?
- No.

353
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:52,832
Okay.

354
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,662
Er... wait for me here.

355
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,634
Hey, good evening.

356
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,978
Hey.
Hello there!

357
00:30:07,012 --> 00:30:10,641
- Just a... just a regular room.
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:13,742
And what's
the duration of your stay?

359
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:18,714
Uh, just till
the end of the week and...

360
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,551
Let me see here...

361
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:22,488
Maybe, maybe
a little bit longer.

362
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:25,557
Oh.
In cash.

363
00:30:25,592 --> 00:30:27,064
Perfect.

364
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:35,006
Okay, this is for you.

365
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,864
Perfect.

366
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:37,876
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

367
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:44,212
So, uh, you have a room...

368
00:30:44,248 --> 00:30:46,776
and uh...

369
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,615
You know what?

370
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,650
Take it.

371
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:57,160
And the room has been paid for
until the end of the week, so...

372
00:31:00,395 --> 00:31:02,395
Take care of yourself.

373
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,830
<i>So how long have
you been in Miami?</i>

374
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:16,079
You got me.

375
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:19,545
There weren't too many
noodle joints where I grew up.

376
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:21,613
Where's that?

377
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,317
Idaho.

378
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:27,718
Isn't that,
like, potato country?

379
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,622
Yeah, blue collar.

380
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,656
Mountains and valleys.

381
00:31:32,692 --> 00:31:36,265
Where I was from, we only had
a population of about 1,000.

382
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:40,269
Kind of place that's got more
churches than restaurants.

383
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:46,010
What about you?

384
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:48,980
North Carolina.

385
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:52,984
It's like, um,
NASCAR country, yeah?

386
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:56,119
Yeah, but I don't
really like fast cars.

387
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,256
Better sell my Lambo then.

388
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:07,031
So what's your name?

389
00:32:09,729 --> 00:32:11,498
Stray?

390
00:32:11,532 --> 00:32:14,468
That's not a real name.
- I'm sorry.

391
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:16,173
Lexus?

392
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:22,376
My name is Sloane.

393
00:32:23,973 --> 00:32:25,842
I like it.

394
00:32:26,845 --> 00:32:29,482
Come on, what is it?

395
00:32:31,387 --> 00:32:32,882
Ricky.

396
00:32:34,654 --> 00:32:35,884
Aw, Ricky.

397
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,951
That's cute.

398
00:32:36,987 --> 00:32:39,426
I like it.
- It's goofy.

399
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:46,005
Is that a gun?

400
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:50,107
Mm-hmm.

401
00:32:52,343 --> 00:32:54,508
I don't trust
so many people in this city.

402
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:58,907
That makes two of us.

403
00:33:07,688 --> 00:33:09,259
What do you do again?

404
00:33:11,758 --> 00:33:14,032
I fight.

405
00:33:17,961 --> 00:33:20,203
I wanna show you something.

406
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:37,188
What?

407
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:39,883
You bring
all your dates here, huh?

408
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:42,457
Every single one
of them, actually.

409
00:33:44,724 --> 00:33:48,022
Nah, I just thought you needed
some more space for that worm.

410
00:33:48,057 --> 00:33:50,530
Nah, I can't.

411
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,895
Okay.

412
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:56,635
Though you did seem pretty
confident last time we talked.

413
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,478
All right.

414
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:07,394
I haven't done this shit
in years though.

415
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:09,286
Dance.

416
00:34:58,369 --> 00:34:59,434
Hey.

417
00:34:59,469 --> 00:35:03,373
I am so sick of this, Cuda.
Enough.

418
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,969
Medina, please.
What's up with...?

419
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,213
Lola isn't
a little girl anymore, Cuda.

420
00:35:08,248 --> 00:35:11,644
She knows who her father is,
who he really is.

421
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,284
Well, that doesn't mean that
you can take her away from me,

422
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,782
you know?
- Of course it does.

423
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:19,818
Look.
- Oh.

424
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:20,961
It's bad enough you want to try

425
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:22,150
and buy her with some money.

426
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:23,052
What kind of money, Cuda?
- I... I'm sorry.

427
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:24,460
I'm sorry.

428
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:26,791
You're stained
with the life that you live.

429
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,023
A criminal.

430
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,498
Well, you know,
I came here because...

431
00:35:30,534 --> 00:35:31,862
I know.

432
00:35:31,898 --> 00:35:33,237
Lola's birthday.
- That's right.

433
00:35:33,273 --> 00:35:34,536
Her sweet 16.

434
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,976
And I would like
to buy her something,

435
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,307
take her for dinner,

436
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:38,715
you know, just do
normal things that a father

437
00:35:38,739 --> 00:35:39,838
would do for his daughter.

438
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:42,038
I know you're hurting,
but I'm not gonna let Lola

439
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:44,809
be your medicine.
You got locked up.

440
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:46,646
You left us.

441
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:48,077
Remember that?
- Yeah, I remember.

442
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,550
I got locked up, yeah.

443
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:51,355
I got in jail,
and when you get in jail,

444
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,489
that's what happen, you know?

445
00:35:53,523 --> 00:35:58,230
Then you don't see anybody
outside of jail.

446
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,190
Who is it?

447
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:05,599
Camaron Gaskelle.

448
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:08,668
A little known,
somewhat hermetic artist.

449
00:36:08,704 --> 00:36:12,166
Arguably could have
rival led some of the greats.

450
00:36:12,202 --> 00:36:15,346
Apparently never left his home.

451
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,545
Lived with a bunch of cats.

452
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,621
Hey.

453
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,623
- You following with me, man?
- I saw your car.

454
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:31,460
Look, I'm sorry
I wasn't professional.

455
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:34,893
Asshole!

456
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:37,961
- Yeah, keep walking, pussy fuck!
- Look, man.

457
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,898
I'm down to play golf or tennis.

458
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:42,032
Whatever you want.

459
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,231
Hey, I really feel
I can do this.

460
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,706
Yeah, good.
Oh, Jesus.

461
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,112
<i>Puta madre.</i>

462
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:59,148
- What?
- Turn it over.

463
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:07,827
- Could be your ignition switch.
- Yeah.

464
00:37:07,862 --> 00:37:10,532
- It's your starter motor.
- No, hey, hey, hey!

465
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:13,668
Hey, listen.

466
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:15,230
I don't like you
messing with my car.

467
00:37:15,264 --> 00:37:16,934
Hey?
I'll call a tow.

468
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,969
Patience.

469
00:37:19,005 --> 00:37:20,411
Patience.

470
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,186
- Try that.
- Yeah.

471
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,333
Whoa.

472
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:48,262
I really need this job.

473
00:37:48,297 --> 00:37:50,342
Yeah, okay.

474
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:53,476
Just give me a chance.

475
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:55,643
Right, listen.
I... I have some work

476
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,711
coming up
in the next couple of days,

477
00:37:57,746 --> 00:37:59,351
you know,
that you can help me with.

478
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:02,947
Maybe.

479
00:38:30,108 --> 00:38:31,306
Hello?

480
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
Room service.

481
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,925
Billie?

482
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:54,702
No, no, no,
I didn't get anything.

483
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:13,050
Fucking bitch!

484
00:39:13,085 --> 00:39:14,826
No, no!

485
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:18,893
Shut the fuck up!

486
00:39:20,896 --> 00:39:22,291
No!

487
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,929
No!
- Come here!

488
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:33,411
Bitch!

489
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,309
<i>Please!</i>

490
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,655
Please!

491
00:39:56,931 --> 00:39:58,327
Hey.

492
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:02,666
<i>Do you have any kids?</i>

493
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,833
<i>Yeah, a daughter.</i>

494
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:05,998
Just your age.

495
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:06,967
What's her name?

496
00:41:07,001 --> 00:41:08,804
<i>Lola.</i>

497
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:10,673
<i>Her birthday's next week.</i>

498
00:41:47,141 --> 00:41:50,548
<i>These streets are not safe
for a girl your age.</i>

499
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,751
<i>Is there anywhere
I can take you?</i>

500
00:41:55,786 --> 00:41:58,590
No.

501
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:30,655
Right there, right there.

502
00:42:54,175 --> 00:42:56,240
See you later.

503
00:42:56,275 --> 00:42:58,507
<i>Didn't think you'd come.</i>

504
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:08,791
See that?

505
00:43:34,413 --> 00:43:36,643
You good?

506
00:43:36,679 --> 00:43:38,822
You look like
you didn't sleep last night.

507
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:43,155
I met a girl, and uh...

508
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,630
Well, shit, you don't
look too happy about it.

509
00:43:44,653 --> 00:43:45,697
No, no, no.
Not like that.

510
00:43:45,731 --> 00:43:47,061
She's a child.

511
00:43:47,096 --> 00:43:51,460
She was just shoplifting
down there in Ocean Drive.

512
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:52,802
She's a runaway.

513
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,177
I gave her some money,
put her in a hotel,

514
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:58,105
and uh, now she's, uh...
She's gone.

515
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:05,112
And I think
that someone's taken her.

516
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,246
I mean, I don't know this girl.

517
00:44:08,282 --> 00:44:11,250
Judging by what you're saying,
I mean, she could be

518
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:14,550
ducking the cops, or a pimp.

519
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,860
Fuck, man.

520
00:44:16,894 --> 00:44:19,092
Half the kids out here
these days are base heads.

521
00:44:20,623 --> 00:44:22,898
There is something about her.

522
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,661
She's very young.

523
00:44:27,697 --> 00:44:29,333
She's someone's daughter,
you know?

524
00:44:29,369 --> 00:44:30,907
I hear you.

525
00:44:30,942 --> 00:44:33,601
I just don't think there's
anything you can do about it.

526
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,880
Cuda.

527
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:12,146
I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

528
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:15,820
It's the same time
every week, Ling,

529
00:45:15,855 --> 00:45:18,217
so don't bullshit me with
that Chinese calendar stuff.

530
00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:21,056
No problem, I just want
to find some extra cash

531
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:23,860
for you, okay?
- Yeah.

532
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:30,197
One, two, three, four...

533
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:40,778
Okay, no problem.

534
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:44,706
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold it, hold it, hold it.

535
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:49,282
Where did you get that?
- What?

536
00:45:49,317 --> 00:45:51,119
The money clip,
where did you get it?

537
00:45:51,153 --> 00:45:53,351
It's mine.
It's my money clip.

538
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:55,860
No, no I gave it to a friend
of mine, a little girl.

539
00:45:55,894 --> 00:45:58,994
Where did you get it?
- Uh...

540
00:46:00,789 --> 00:46:02,757
He asked you a fucking question.

541
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:04,791
My friend, he gave this to me.

542
00:46:04,827 --> 00:46:07,101
Who the fuck is your friend?
Who is your friend?

543
00:46:07,137 --> 00:46:09,268
- I don't understand.
- Who gave it to you?

544
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:12,139
He owns a pawn shop
in... in South Miami.

545
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:13,768
58th Street.

546
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:15,769
It's an antique.
It's a real gold...

547
00:46:15,804 --> 00:46:18,344
And it's mine,
so don't fuck with me!

548
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:35,163
<i>Cuda, it's Estelle.</i>

549
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:38,969
<i>Come to my place first thing
in the morning and bring Stray.</i>

550
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:40,871
<i>It's important.</i>

551
00:46:54,547 --> 00:46:56,711
Yeah, I had a good time.

552
00:46:56,746 --> 00:46:59,153
Yeah, no, I just...

553
00:46:59,188 --> 00:47:01,650
Said that,
I gotta go, all right?

554
00:47:01,686 --> 00:47:04,291
Yeah, okay, all right, bye.

555
00:47:06,295 --> 00:47:08,163
Who's the girl?

556
00:47:08,197 --> 00:47:10,869
Only just met.

557
00:47:12,862 --> 00:47:14,268
She's one of Estelle's?

558
00:47:16,206 --> 00:47:18,074
You have been
around a while, huh?

559
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,340
You like her?

560
00:47:21,376 --> 00:47:23,012
Think so.

561
00:47:23,047 --> 00:47:24,871
Well, if you are
serious about her,

562
00:47:24,907 --> 00:47:28,150
you know, I'd find
a different line of work.

563
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:30,856
You really think
you're the one who

564
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,615
should be giving life advice?

565
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,255
Of course I am.

566
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,197
If you were just as...

567
00:47:42,231 --> 00:47:44,396
Just half as much
as you think you are,

568
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:49,269
you... you'd go and make
a real life for yourself.

569
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:53,945
- A real life?
- Yeah.

570
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,804
What do you want
to make of yourself?

571
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,146
- I don't know.
- No, what do you want?

572
00:47:58,181 --> 00:48:00,875
Really.
Think about it.

573
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:03,416
What do you want?

574
00:48:05,353 --> 00:48:06,958
I want...

575
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:15,295
A world where I don't have
to fight for a place in it.

576
00:48:17,003 --> 00:48:19,101
A life worth living?

577
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,007
That is good.

578
00:48:25,373 --> 00:48:28,210
You know, you fixed
this car pretty good.

579
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:32,346
You can try that
for a living, right?

580
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:36,184
A grease monkey?

581
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:40,992
It's better
than a stray dog, huh?

582
00:48:41,027 --> 00:48:42,454
A fucking punk.

583
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:44,963
Come on.

584
00:48:58,242 --> 00:49:01,606
We're just from South side.
- Excellent.

585
00:49:01,641 --> 00:49:03,211
Yeah.

586
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:06,016
Look at this,
the mentor and his protege.

587
00:49:06,052 --> 00:49:07,612
How's he coming along, Cuda?

588
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:09,646
Uh...

589
00:49:09,681 --> 00:49:12,980
he's doing well, yeah.

590
00:49:13,014 --> 00:49:15,289
He's doing well?

591
00:49:15,324 --> 00:49:17,159
That's rare in a man these days.

592
00:49:17,195 --> 00:49:21,032
And yet,
you're just a boy, aren't you?

593
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:26,862
Can I get you
something, darling?

594
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:29,336
No.

595
00:49:29,371 --> 00:49:31,405
Thank you.

596
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:35,639
So polite.

597
00:49:35,675 --> 00:49:37,411
Oh, I know, Cuda.

598
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:40,644
Why don't you dress him up
in one of your suits?

599
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,844
They're not really my taste.

600
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:47,817
Some would say
he's old fashioned,

601
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,016
a relic, even,

602
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:53,492
but we know our friend Cuda...

603
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,266
Is a classic.

604
00:50:04,373 --> 00:50:06,143
There's a new outfit
out of midtown.

605
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,938
What are they running?

606
00:50:09,972 --> 00:50:11,213
Everything's online now.

607
00:50:11,248 --> 00:50:13,248
You've seen these kids.

608
00:50:13,284 --> 00:50:16,681
Digital currencies, cyber fraud,
deals on the dark web,

609
00:50:16,715 --> 00:50:19,188
but they've got a good system.

610
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:23,556
Pulling in over 100 a day.
- So another lease?

611
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:27,757
These aren't duffel bag boys.
They're independent.

612
00:50:27,793 --> 00:50:30,364
It's a new world out there.

613
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,367
They just don't realize
it's still mine.

614
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:35,931
- You said midtown?
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:37,932
I know some people
around that area.

616
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,936
Oh.
Do you?

617
00:50:44,777 --> 00:50:47,382
What do you think, Cuda?

618
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:49,351
Shall we let Stray
take this one on his own?

619
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:53,487
Sure.

620
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:55,159
Suit yourself.

621
00:50:55,193 --> 00:50:57,590
I have something to do, anyway.

622
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,952
Hey!

623
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:05,460
What the fuck, man?

624
00:52:05,494 --> 00:52:06,791
What the fuck, what are you...

625
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:08,297
Where is she?

626
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,052
I don't know what
you're talking about, man!

627
00:52:14,932 --> 00:52:17,702
Freddie!
It was Freddie's guy!

628
00:52:17,737 --> 00:52:19,869
Where do I find Freddie?

629
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:23,543
There's an old cookie factory
in the industrial block!

630
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:24,742
Midtown.

631
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:28,219
Come on, please, I swear,
I don't know anything!

632
00:52:28,253 --> 00:52:31,012
I had nothing to do with it!

633
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:34,918
You have everything
to do with it.

634
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:14,594
What are you doing here?

635
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,697
Estelle said
I could handle this.

636
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:20,061
Well...

637
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:22,735
She told me to
keep an eye on you.

638
00:53:39,985 --> 00:53:42,050
Freddie?

639
00:54:16,956 --> 00:54:18,119
<i>No, wait...</i>

640
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,429
<i>Stay down, bitch!</i>

641
00:54:19,463 --> 00:54:20,543
<i>On your fucking knees!
- No!</i>

642
00:54:23,369 --> 00:54:25,764
Take that shit,
you nasty mother fuck!

643
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:32,706
You like what you see?

644
00:54:47,987 --> 00:54:50,889
<i>No, no, no more, stop.</i>

645
00:54:54,862 --> 00:54:56,994
Shit, look who it is.

646
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:58,797
'Sup, Pay-Check?

647
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,635
You lost, Stray?

648
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,900
- This Estelle's people?
- Mm-hmm.

649
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,907
Take a seat.

650
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:10,842
Thank you.

651
00:55:17,686 --> 00:55:19,653
You got to make this quick.

652
00:55:19,688 --> 00:55:21,556
Who the fuck
are you supposed to be?

653
00:55:21,592 --> 00:55:24,219
This one of them scrappers
from the boatyard fights.

654
00:55:24,253 --> 00:55:26,496
Took a bite
out of Big Philly last week.

655
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:28,498
He don't look like much to me.

656
00:55:28,532 --> 00:55:31,369
Shit, but he fight
like a dog, you hear me?

657
00:55:35,804 --> 00:55:37,672
Your boss,

658
00:55:37,706 --> 00:55:39,871
she got some crazy ideas
in that head of hers.

659
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,009
Talking like she trying
to take a cut of my shit.

660
00:55:50,621 --> 00:55:51,884
Now, look.

661
00:55:53,887 --> 00:55:56,393
Looks like you've been
around the game a long time.

662
00:55:57,661 --> 00:55:59,628
What you think about that?

663
00:55:59,663 --> 00:56:02,356
You don't stay in the game
this long

664
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:04,193
without playing by the rules.

665
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:08,032
Motherfucker,
this is a trap house.

666
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:09,396
That's right.

667
00:56:09,431 --> 00:56:10,969
It ain't no rules.

668
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,478
I wouldn't be sitting where
I am today if I played by the...

669
00:56:17,175 --> 00:56:18,811
Rules.

670
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:20,880
You know, it...

671
00:56:20,914 --> 00:56:23,311
looks real nice,

672
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,048
you know, from over here.

673
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,414
It's beautiful.

674
00:56:33,697 --> 00:56:35,092
We met before?

675
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,701
You do a bit in Santa Rosa?

676
00:56:41,001 --> 00:56:42,802
I remember you.

677
00:56:44,268 --> 00:56:46,300
Barracuda motherfucker.

678
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:52,010
Used to run
with them Latin Kings...

679
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:53,550
until they flipped on you.

680
00:56:55,014 --> 00:56:57,751
Tried to get you knocked.

681
00:56:57,786 --> 00:56:59,523
But you took out
three of them in the shower

682
00:56:59,557 --> 00:57:03,626
on some old... ice pick shit.

683
00:57:05,322 --> 00:57:08,960
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

684
00:57:08,996 --> 00:57:11,193
Let go of me!

685
00:57:16,365 --> 00:57:18,300
You set me up!

686
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,708
You fucking piece of shit!

687
00:57:19,742 --> 00:57:21,875
You fucking piece of shit!

688
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:23,976
Let me out!

689
00:57:27,409 --> 00:57:28,815
What up, kill a?

690
00:57:28,851 --> 00:57:31,445
<i>You fucking...
You fucking piece of shit!</i>

691
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,052
You see something you like?

692
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,284
You see,
I got all type of girls.

693
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,693
Black girls, white girls...

694
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:41,664
<i>Please, please, please, stop.</i>

695
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,898
Little girls.

696
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:48,132
Everybody got
their poison, you hear me?

697
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:52,168
Me, I like it when they got
a little bit of fight in them,

698
00:57:52,204 --> 00:57:53,907
you hear me?

699
00:57:53,942 --> 00:57:57,306
Stray, tell this, eh...

700
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,175
silly fucking white boy

701
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,409
I hear him just fine.

702
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:11,418
Hey, man, shut the fuck up
before I split that wig

703
00:58:11,454 --> 00:58:13,255
of yours, motherfucker.

704
00:58:22,068 --> 00:58:24,036
You done?

705
00:58:26,744 --> 00:58:29,876
Andre.

706
00:58:29,911 --> 00:58:33,012
Bring my bag.

707
00:58:52,902 --> 00:58:54,065
All of it.

708
00:58:55,333 --> 00:58:56,903
Dre.

709
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:05,880
If you motherfuckers
knew how to use crypto,

710
00:59:05,914 --> 00:59:08,652
I wouldn't ever have
to see you two assholes again.

711
00:59:08,686 --> 00:59:10,280
This cash shit?

712
00:59:10,315 --> 00:59:12,952
Man, this shit fucking dead.

713
00:59:12,987 --> 00:59:14,547
It's all there.

714
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,594
Good.
Gentlemen, my lady.

715
00:59:20,259 --> 00:59:22,797
Yo.

716
00:59:22,833 --> 00:59:25,965
I'ma catch you later, Cuda.

717
00:59:27,266 --> 00:59:28,936
Sure.

718
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:41,849
Yo, what the fuck
was that all about?

719
00:59:41,885 --> 00:59:45,117
You almost got us killed
with that shit.

720
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:47,449
Yeah.

721
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,989
Cuda.

722
00:59:49,023 --> 00:59:50,760
Those are some dangerous people.

723
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,092
They do fucked up shit, man.

724
00:59:53,126 --> 00:59:54,554
That was the girl.

725
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:57,635
- Who?
- Billie.

726
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,034
The runaway
I dropped at the hotel?

727
01:00:03,137 --> 01:00:04,597
No, could've
been someone else...

728
01:00:04,632 --> 01:00:06,193
Yeah, she's 15 years old,
you know that?

729
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:11,110
- Fuck.
- I can't leave her there.

730
01:00:13,411 --> 01:00:16,148
Man, I thought that shit
only happened in, like, Russia.

731
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:20,822
Webcam factories, man.

732
01:00:20,858 --> 01:00:24,893
It's like... those girls we saw.

733
01:00:24,927 --> 01:00:26,619
They're forced
to stream on the internet

734
01:00:26,655 --> 01:00:28,193
to creeps all over the world.

735
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,393
Doing what?

736
01:00:31,429 --> 01:00:33,032
Dark, dark stuff.

737
01:00:34,773 --> 01:00:35,969
People pay all types of money

738
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:37,599
for the most fucked up shit,
huh?

739
01:00:40,668 --> 01:00:42,844
Fuckers.

740
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,681
I'll see you upstairs.

741
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:48,543
Hey!

742
01:00:54,518 --> 01:00:55,824
Let's not even talk about that.

743
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,057
What?

744
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:02,864
I don't know, like, I was
just very determined in life.

745
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,592
I didn't want
to break up with him

746
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:06,032
because he was so good to me.

747
01:01:06,068 --> 01:01:08,331
Like, he even comforted me
when I broke up with him,

748
01:01:08,367 --> 01:01:09,567
which was, like, Oh, my God...

749
01:01:10,302 --> 01:01:11,565
<i>Lexus.</i>

750
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:15,503
<i>Come to the red room right away.</i>

751
01:01:38,231 --> 01:01:40,396
<i>Do you know
how special you are to me?</i>

752
01:01:44,842 --> 01:01:46,237
<i>How important?</i>

753
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:53,641
<i>No one cares about you...</i>

754
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:55,246
<i>like I do.</i>

755
01:01:57,284 --> 01:01:59,184
<i>Not even close.</i>

756
01:02:01,155 --> 01:02:02,650
<i>I love you.</i>

757
01:02:03,751 --> 01:02:05,762
<i>You belong with me.</i>

758
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:09,657
<i>He belongs to me.</i>

759
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:13,760
<i>Remember that.</i>

760
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,186
Ricky.

761
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:37,157
Hey, what's wrong?

762
01:02:37,192 --> 01:02:39,126
Nothing.

763
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:41,061
Just didn't get much
sleep last night.

764
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:45,264
Is everything okay?

765
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,134
Yeah, it's okay.

766
01:02:54,472 --> 01:02:57,143
I'm just thinking everything
that's happened with Estelle.

767
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,820
What she's offering me.

768
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:07,153
Yeah, Estelle has
that effect on people.

769
01:03:09,554 --> 01:03:11,686
But she's dangerous.

770
01:03:14,030 --> 01:03:16,327
Oh, shit.
What time is it?

771
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:20,199
Um...

772
01:03:22,831 --> 01:03:25,469
- We slept in.
- No.

773
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:30,672
You slept in.

774
01:03:32,181 --> 01:03:35,809
I'm going to be late for work.

775
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:47,193
How much is in there?

776
01:03:49,264 --> 01:03:50,394
Half a mil.

777
01:03:56,204 --> 01:04:00,536
<i>Frank moving in to the end zone.</i>

778
01:04:00,572 --> 01:04:05,773
<i>Three yard touchdown run,
and Miami scores!</i>

779
01:04:14,057 --> 01:04:15,849
Cuda, shouldn't you
be on a beach somewhere

780
01:04:15,884 --> 01:04:16,893
sipping a Piña colada
with one of those

781
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:18,291
cute little umbrellas?

782
01:04:18,326 --> 01:04:21,063
Are you aware of
what's going on in midtown?

783
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:23,757
It's a money factory.

784
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,398
Oh, it's much more
than that, Estelle.

785
01:04:31,932 --> 01:04:34,637
You know...

786
01:04:34,672 --> 01:04:39,378
there's a level I thought
even you wouldn't sink into.

787
01:04:39,413 --> 01:04:42,150
A man who wears bloody,
brain splattered mist as cologne

788
01:04:42,184 --> 01:04:44,954
is going to tell me where I
can and can't make my money?

789
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:47,617
They've got
a little girl in there.

790
01:04:47,652 --> 01:04:49,552
She's barely 15 years old.

791
01:04:49,588 --> 01:04:50,751
Oh, I see.

792
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:52,786
Thinking of
your sweet little Lola.

793
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:54,887
Keep my family
out of your fucking mouth.

794
01:04:54,922 --> 01:04:56,791
To be in my mouth

795
01:04:56,826 --> 01:04:58,429
is a privilege.

796
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:03,269
No.
Not anymore.

797
01:05:11,016 --> 01:05:14,115
- Isn't that your friend's car?
- Yeah.

798
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:16,612
Cuda.

799
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:20,815
Hey.

800
01:05:20,849 --> 01:05:24,126
Can you just wait here
for a minute?

801
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:26,293
Dancers, they can't
really bring anyone in.

802
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:30,164
Yeah, all right.

803
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:37,039
It's nothing personal.

804
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,056
<i>I know what kind of world
it is out there, Cuda.</i>

805
01:05:43,081 --> 01:05:44,608
<i>I've seen it, lived it.</i>

806
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:47,050
Just like those girls.

807
01:05:47,085 --> 01:05:49,018
And I survived.

808
01:05:49,054 --> 01:05:52,054
That doesn't mean she will.

809
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:55,882
Do you know how deep
and dark the ocean is, Cuda?

810
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:57,719
What?

811
01:05:57,755 --> 01:05:59,952
All the pretty, colorful fish
swim in the warm waters

812
01:05:59,987 --> 01:06:01,998
near the surface,
but down below...

813
01:06:03,496 --> 01:06:06,630
That's where
the real business happens.

814
01:06:06,664 --> 01:06:08,829
The creatures down below
have a special type of blood

815
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,699
to keep them from freezing

816
01:06:10,735 --> 01:06:12,735
so that they can withstand
the harsh realities

817
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:15,804
of their existence

818
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,014
and survive.

819
01:06:22,086 --> 01:06:24,447
Maybe you don't have
the same blood we do, Cuda.

820
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:31,016
Maybe you never adapted
to the darkness.

821
01:06:49,873 --> 01:06:51,344
That's from Freddie's.

822
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,380
Excellent.

823
01:06:54,251 --> 01:06:55,251
Doom.

824
01:06:56,483 --> 01:06:57,945
I think it's time
to present Cuda

825
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,682
with his retirement package.

826
01:07:30,782 --> 01:07:33,914
Fight for me, I fight for you,

827
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,753
and I'll make
your dreams a reality.

828
01:07:42,827 --> 01:07:44,958
It's a simple offer.

829
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:56,211
Motherfucker!

830
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,713
Kill him.

831
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,559
Harder.

832
01:09:04,842 --> 01:09:06,876
Fuck you.

833
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:17,556
Motherfucker!

834
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:24,123
Live like a dog...

835
01:09:25,930 --> 01:09:28,469
Die like a dog.

836
01:09:59,765 --> 01:10:01,403
Grab the bags.

837
01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:04,306
Get the van.

838
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:09,069
Get out of town,
but wait for my call.

839
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:12,381
I'll meet you soon.

840
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:24,085
All right, dog,
be cool out here, man.

841
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:26,427
All right, be good, man.

842
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:56,484
Hey, I'm looking
for a young, Black, girl,

843
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,916
about 15 years old.
Her name is Billie.

844
01:11:58,951 --> 01:12:01,390
She had these...
These, uh, red braids.

845
01:12:01,426 --> 01:12:02,755
You seen her?

846
01:12:02,789 --> 01:12:04,525
They don't really
let us out of here.

847
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,493
All right, okay, listen.

848
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:07,826
Key... use them, okay?

849
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:09,993
Get the fuck out of here.

850
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,692
You're a fucking dead man,
do you hear me?

851
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,255
You hear me?

852
01:12:43,567 --> 01:12:45,060
Yeah, I hear you.

853
01:12:45,095 --> 01:12:46,359
I hear you.

854
01:12:58,175 --> 01:13:00,274
The fuck?

855
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,948
Pay-Check?

856
01:13:12,189 --> 01:13:13,792
Dre?

857
01:13:22,033 --> 01:13:25,068
Hey, come on, let's go.

858
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:34,143
Come on, killer.

859
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,838
Where is Freddie?

860
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:21,354
Knew I was gonna
see your ass again.

861
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:25,997
Fucked my whole shit up!

862
01:14:27,604 --> 01:14:29,329
Don't even think about it.

863
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:34,873
Look at your ass.

864
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:38,646
Cuda.

865
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:41,210
I've seen a lot
of shit in my lifetime.

866
01:14:42,015 --> 01:14:45,082
I ain't never seen a
motherfucker bleed out though.

867
01:14:45,117 --> 01:14:48,184
Wonder how much they'll pay
for some shit like this?

868
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:55,697
Baby girl, listen,
put the gun...

869
01:14:55,731 --> 01:14:57,171
What are you doing?
You don't need...

870
01:15:00,033 --> 01:15:03,033
Fuck.

871
01:15:03,069 --> 01:15:05,904
What the...

872
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:10,007
I'll fucking kill you,
little hoe!

873
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,176
What the fuck...

874
01:15:16,885 --> 01:15:18,345
I trusted you.

875
01:15:18,381 --> 01:15:21,414
You sick fuck.

876
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:24,252
I came here to...

877
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,320
To save you.

878
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:30,390
And the whole thing ended up
with you saving me.

879
01:15:40,975 --> 01:15:43,744
Swear to God,
I'm gonna kill you.

880
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:05,800
No, no, no, no.

881
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,041
You know, you... you were right.

882
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:21,475
I am the barracuda.

883
01:16:24,314 --> 01:16:27,414
And tonight...

884
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,449
is not a night to kill.

885
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:36,028
It's a night to die.

886
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:44,002
Come on.
Come on.

887
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:23,680
Cuda, you all right?

888
01:17:25,376 --> 01:17:26,847
Help me.

889
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:35,856
You're taking her with you.

890
01:17:40,193 --> 01:17:41,390
Where?

891
01:17:41,425 --> 01:17:44,063
Out of Florida, out of Miami.

892
01:17:44,097 --> 01:17:45,833
Get her out now.

893
01:17:45,868 --> 01:17:47,935
Cuda, slow down, you're hurt.

894
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:50,431
We got to get you to a hospital.

895
01:17:50,466 --> 01:17:52,335
Listen to me.

896
01:17:54,074 --> 01:17:55,601
Drive north.

897
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:57,779
Dump the van, buy a car.

898
01:17:57,814 --> 01:18:00,243
You have to disappear.

899
01:18:02,952 --> 01:18:03,984
Yeah.

900
01:18:05,613 --> 01:18:08,219
She's got no one.

901
01:18:08,253 --> 01:18:09,890
She needs you.

902
01:18:10,828 --> 01:18:13,059
She needs both of you.

903
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:14,994
It's okay.

904
01:18:16,394 --> 01:18:17,458
You have to find your...

905
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:20,065
Your place in this world.

906
01:18:21,497 --> 01:18:23,530
Isn't life worth living?

907
01:18:37,019 --> 01:18:39,216
What are you going to do?

908
01:19:18,456 --> 01:19:20,356
Happy birthday!

909
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:21,654
You excited for tonight?

910
01:19:21,689 --> 01:19:23,426
Um, I don't really
like birthdays, but...

911
01:19:23,461 --> 01:19:24,493
Come on!

912
01:19:24,528 --> 01:19:26,329
It'll be fun.
- I guess.

913
01:19:26,364 --> 01:19:28,793
Mom told me she can drop me
off at yours around 7:00,

914
01:19:28,828 --> 01:19:31,698
and then we can go
to Cicciolina's.

915
01:22:25,511 --> 01:22:27,378
How much do I owe you?

916
01:22:31,319 --> 01:22:33,121
It's just a quick fix.
Don't worry about it.

917
01:22:33,155 --> 01:22:34,551
Oh, you're a good man.

918
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:36,234
I'll make sure she comes back
for a full service.

919
01:22:36,257 --> 01:22:37,389
Of course.

920
01:22:37,423 --> 01:22:39,324
Just book in
with the girls, would you?

921
01:22:56,002 --> 01:22:58,970
Like, home or here?

922
01:22:59,006 --> 01:23:01,743
Billie, turn that up.
