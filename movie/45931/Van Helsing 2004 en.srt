1
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:51,966
lt's alive.

2
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:56,006
lt's alive. lt's alive!

3
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,082
There he is! Hit it again!

4
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:23,636
Success!

5
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:25,959
Count, it's just you.

6
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,718
l was beginning
to lose faith, Victor.

7
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:35,238
A pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled...

8
00:01:35,327 --> 00:01:37,682
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

9
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,041
Yes.

10
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,482
[Pants] l must escape this place.

11
00:01:42,127 --> 00:01:44,516
DRACULA: Where are you going to run,
Victor?

12
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:50,482
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome...

13
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,842
in most of the civilized world.

14
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:56,596
l'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

15
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:58,399
DRACULA: No, no, Victor.

16
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,764
The time has come
for me to take command of him.

17
00:02:02,447 --> 00:02:03,562
What are you saying?

18
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:06,684
Why do you think l brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

19
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,327
-Equipped your laboratory?
-You said....

20
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:12,925
-You said you believed in my work.
-And l do.

21
00:02:13,647 --> 00:02:17,959
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said...

22
00:02:18,447 --> 00:02:21,439
a triumph of science...

23
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:23,959
over God...

24
00:02:26,727 --> 00:02:30,197
it must now serve my purpose.

25
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,966
What purpose?

26
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,555
Good God!

27
00:02:49,247 --> 00:02:51,681
l would kill myself
before helping in such a task.

28
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:55,919
Feel free. l don't actually need you
anymore, Victor.

29
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,719
l just need him.

30
00:02:58,367 --> 00:02:59,959
He is the key.

31
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:03,804
l could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

32
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:05,515
l could.

33
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:09,239
ln fact,
my brides are insisting upon it.

34
00:03:12,607 --> 00:03:14,677
lgor, help me!

35
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:17,725
lGOR: You have been
so kind to me, Doctor...

36
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:20,357
caring, thoughtful.

37
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,001
But he pays me.

38
00:03:26,847 --> 00:03:28,121
VlCTOR: Stay back.

39
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:30,676
You can't kill me, Victor.

40
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,599
l'm already dead.

41
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,481
Dr. Frankenstein!

42
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:40,279
Look, it's headed for the windmill!
Come on!

43
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,360
Burn it! Burn it down!

44
00:06:28,247 --> 00:06:29,441
Vampires.

45
00:06:29,647 --> 00:06:31,877
-Run for your lives!
-Vampires!

46
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:53,756
Father.

47
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,555
VAN HELSlNG: Evening.

48
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:09,601
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

49
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:13,082
l'd hate to be such a nuisance.

50
00:09:20,887 --> 00:09:22,684
l missed you in London.

51
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:26,396
No, you bloody did not!
You got me good.

52
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,246
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted
by the Knights of the Holy Order...

53
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,555
lt's Mr. Hyde now.

54
00:09:30,807 --> 00:09:33,401
...for the murder of 12 men,
six women, four--

55
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:38,163
...children, three goats, and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry!

56
00:09:38,807 --> 00:09:42,322
So you're the great Van Helsing.

57
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:44,716
And you're a deranged psychopath.

58
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,520
We all have our little problems.

59
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:57,076
My superiors would like for me
to take you alive...

60
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,635
so that they may extricate
your better half.

61
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,116
[Grunts] l bet they bloody would.

62
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,923
Personally, l'd rather just kill you
and call it a day.

63
00:10:06,007 --> 00:10:08,475
But let's make it your decision,
shall we?

64
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:09,955
Do let's.

65
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,037
MR. HYDE: Here l come...

66
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,482
ready or not!

67
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,883
[Screaming] The bell!

68
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:10,644
MR. HYDE: No, no.

69
00:11:12,727 --> 00:11:14,683
l'll bet that's upsetting.

70
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,039
Paris!

71
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,279
Come here.

72
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:39,037
l think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

73
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,876
lt's been a pleasure knowing you.
Au revoir!

74
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:53,002
[Mr. Hyde groaning]

75
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:07,602
Oh, no.

76
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:16,881
My turn.

77
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,125
May he rest in peace.

78
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:00,080
Van Helsing.

79
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,241
You murderer!

80
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:30,681
Bless me, Father, for l have--

81
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,600
CARDlNAL: Sinned. Yes, l know.
You're very good at that.

82
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,238
You shattered the Rose Window.

83
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:38,966
Not to split hairs, sir,
but Mr. Hyde did the shattering.

84
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:42,517
13th century. Over 600 years old.

85
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:47,243
-l wish you a week in hell for that.
-lt would be a nice reprieve.

86
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,603
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable...

87
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:53,725
but your methods
attract far too much attention.

88
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,601
''Wanted'' posters?
We are not pleased.

89
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:59,281
Do you think l like being
the most wanted man in Europe?

90
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,597
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

91
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:03,723
Because we do not exist.

92
00:14:04,047 --> 00:14:05,958
Well, then neither do l.

93
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:13,041
CARDlNAL: When we found you crawling up
the steps of this church, half-dead...

94
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:16,642
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do God's work.

95
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,195
-Why can't he do it himself?
-Don't blaspheme.

96
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:22,757
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

97
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,159
CARDlNAL: lf you wish to recover it...

98
00:14:25,247 --> 00:14:28,000
l suggest you continue
to heed the call.

99
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:32,366
Without us,
the world would be in darkness.

100
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:35,519
Governments and empires
come and go...

101
00:14:35,607 --> 00:14:39,964
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial.

102
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,756
CARDlNAL: We are the last defense
against evil.

103
00:14:42,887 --> 00:14:46,163
CARDlNAL: An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

104
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:50,638
To you, these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished.

105
00:14:52,247 --> 00:14:54,283
l'm the one standing there
when they die...

106
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,085
and become the men they once were.

107
00:14:56,167 --> 00:14:59,523
For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

108
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:03,357
And now,
we need you to go to the East.

109
00:15:03,967 --> 00:15:06,401
To the far side of Romania.

110
00:15:07,247 --> 00:15:08,726
An accursed land...

111
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:11,640
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

112
00:15:11,847 --> 00:15:14,964
CARDlNAL: Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

113
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:17,518
VAN HELSlNG: Dracula?
CARDlNAL: Yes.

114
00:15:17,927 --> 00:15:20,521
You've never faced one
like this before.

115
00:15:21,447 --> 00:15:24,723
Our story begins 450 years ago...

116
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:28,197
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

117
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:31,837
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

118
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:34,805
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

119
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:37,204
They have not succeeded...

120
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:40,241
and they are running out of family.

121
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:45,200
CARDlNAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

122
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,841
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

123
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:54,003
CARDlNAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

124
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,478
CARDlNAL: lf the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

125
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,603
nine generations of their family...

126
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:02,201
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

127
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,559
For more than four centuries...

128
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,241
this family has defended
our left flank.

129
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,124
They gave their lives.

130
00:16:09,847 --> 00:16:12,407
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

131
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:14,682
So you're sending me into hell.

132
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:18,006
ln a manner.

133
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:24,482
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

134
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,959
We don't know its purpose...

135
00:16:27,047 --> 00:16:29,515
but he would not have
left it lightly.

136
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:32,075
The Latin inscription translates as:

137
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:35,287
''ln the name of God,
open this door.''

138
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,005
There is an insignia.

139
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:44,356
Yes, it matches your ring.

140
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:49,485
l think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

141
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:58,403
CARL: Faster, please. Faster!

142
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,201
Faster! Faster! Faster!

143
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:03,716
Getting there.

144
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,559
-Carl!
-There you are.

145
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:08,760
Did you bring Mr. Hyde back,
or did you kill him?

146
00:17:08,847 --> 00:17:11,600
You killed him, didn't you?
That's why they get so annoyed.

147
00:17:11,687 --> 00:17:14,838
When they ask you to bring someone
back, they don't mean as a corpse.

148
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:16,679
CARL: All right, you're in a mood.
Come on.

149
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:19,327
l have some things that'll
put the bit back in your mouth.

150
00:17:19,407 --> 00:17:21,443
Any idiot can make a sword.

151
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,321
Sorry, Father.

152
00:17:23,407 --> 00:17:25,875
VAN HELSlNG: Come along, Carl.
CARL: Here, take this:

153
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,917
Rings of garlic, holy water...

154
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,085
silver stake, crucifix.

155
00:17:37,887 --> 00:17:39,957
Why can't l have one of those?

156
00:17:40,047 --> 00:17:42,481
You've never gone after vampires
before now, have you?

157
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:44,837
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

158
00:17:44,927 --> 00:17:46,201
VAN HELSlNG: Best when cooked well.

159
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,356
No, they're not all the same.

160
00:17:47,447 --> 00:17:50,757
A vampire is nothing like a warlock.
My granny could kill a warlock.

161
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,838
Carl, you've never even been
out of the abbey.

162
00:17:52,927 --> 00:17:55,566
-How do you know about vampires?
-l read.

163
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:58,319
Here's something new.

164
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,723
Glycerin 48.

165
00:18:05,487 --> 00:18:07,762
CARL: Sorry!

166
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:10,204
MULLAH: What in Allah's name
is wrong with you?

167
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,721
The air around here
is thick with envy.

168
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:16,477
This is my latest invention.
lt's gas-propelled.

169
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:18,842
Capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession...

170
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:22,397
at tremendous velocity.
Just pull the trigger and hold on.

171
00:18:23,127 --> 00:18:25,118
l've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

172
00:18:25,207 --> 00:18:28,085
Trust me, you'll need this.
A work of certifiable genius.

173
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:31,159
-lf you don't say so yourself.
-No, l did say so myself.

174
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,044
l'm a veritable cornucopia
of talent.

175
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,560
Did you invent this?

176
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,399
l've been working on that
for 12 years.

177
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,318
lt's compressed magma
from Mt. Vesuvius...

178
00:18:38,407 --> 00:18:40,398
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

179
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,478
-lt's one of a kind.
-What's it for?

180
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:45,035
l don't know,
but l'm sure it'll come in handy.

181
00:18:45,127 --> 00:18:47,277
Twelve years,
and you don't know what it does?

182
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,835
l didn't say that.
l said l didn't know what it's for.

183
00:18:49,927 --> 00:18:52,202
What it does
is to create a light source...

184
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,800
equal to the intensity of the sun.

185
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:55,445
This will come in handy how?

186
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,677
l don't know.
You can blind your enemies.

187
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,883
Charbroil a herd
of charging wildebeest.

188
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,366
Use your imagination.

189
00:19:01,447 --> 00:19:04,086
No, l'm gonna use yours.
That's why you're coming with me.

190
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,556
CARL: Holy hell be damned l am!
VAN HELSlNG: You cursed.

191
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,239
Not very well, but you're a monk.

192
00:19:08,327 --> 00:19:09,601
You shouldn't curse at all.

193
00:19:09,687 --> 00:19:13,077
Actually, l'm still just a friar.
l can curse all l want...

194
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,361
damn it!

195
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,365
The Cardinal has ordered you
to keep me alive.

196
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:21,197
-For as long as possible.
-But l'm not a field man.

197
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,123
CARL: l don't want to go to Transylvania.

198

Come on.

199
00:20:05,887 --> 00:20:08,959
Dracula unleashed you for a reason.

200
00:20:31,327 --> 00:20:32,726
Pull me up!

201
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,166
lt's stuck!

202
00:20:42,247 --> 00:20:45,364
-No, Anna, it will kill you!
-That's my brother out there.

203

My gun! Find my gun!

206
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,526
Find Velkan's gun.
lt has to be the silver bullets.

207

Anna, hurry!

00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:25,400
Hurry!

210

VELKAN: Anna, look out!

211
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:35,716

215
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:26,846
CARL: So, what do you remember?
VAN HELSlNG: Not now, Carl.

216
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:29,044
There must be something.

217
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:32,121
l remember fighting the Romans
at Masada.

218
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:35,001
-That was in 73 A.D.
-You asked.

219
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:39,320
CARL: What are we doing here?

220
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,637
Why is it so important
to kill this Dracula, anyway?

221
00:23:41,727 --> 00:23:44,605
-Because he's the son of the Devil.
-l mean, besides that.

222
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:47,679
lf we kill him, anything bitten
or created by him will also die.

223
00:23:47,767 --> 00:23:48,916
l mean, besides that.

224

-Pretty much.

ANNA: You, turn around.

227
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:14,277
-Let me see your faces.
-Why?

228
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:16,562
Because we don't trust strangers.

229
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,842
Strangers don't last long here.

Gentlemen, you will now be disarmed.

232
00:24:26,647 --> 00:24:27,966
You can try.

233
00:24:31,727 --> 00:24:33,797
ANNA: You refuse to obey our laws?

234
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:37,044
-The laws of men mean little to me.
-Fine.

235
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:38,716

You stay here.
They're trying to kill me.

-Love to.

Nice to see you, too, Aleera.

Don't play coy with me, Princess.

in your lusting heart.

l hope you have a heart, Aleera...

a stake through it.

Holy water!

Stop your teasing, Marishka,
and finish him.

259

You killed Marishka!

You killed a vampire!
CARL: But isn't that a good thing?

272
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:16,405
Vampires only kill what they need
to survive.

One or two people a month.

So what name, my good sir,

His name is Van Helsing.

00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,720
Before they do unto me, master.

321
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:37,766
Now go, all of you!

322
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:40,562
To Castle Frankenstein!

323
00:36:42,047 --> 00:36:45,357
ALEERA: Yes, we will try again.

324
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:51,646
-So, how did you get here?
-We came by sea.

325
00:36:51,727 --> 00:36:53,604
ANNA: Really? The sea?
CARL: Well, yes.

326
00:36:53,687 --> 00:36:56,281
ANNA: The Adriatic Sea?
VAN HELSlNG: Where do l find Dracula?

327
00:36:56,887 --> 00:36:59,765
ANNA: He used to live in this very house
four centuries ago.

328
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:01,678
No one knows where he lives now.

329
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,758
Father would stare at that painting
for hours...

330
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,485
looking for Dracula's lair.

331
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:08,365
ANNA: So that's why you've come?
VAN HELSlNG: l can help you.

332
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,277
-No one can help me.
-l can try.

333
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:14,245
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

334
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:17,081
ANNA: l can handle this myself.
VAN HELSlNG: So l noticed.

335
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,681
The vampires attacked in daylight.
They never do that.

336
00:37:19,767 --> 00:37:22,042
l was unprepared.
lt won't happen again.

337
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:23,845
So why did they attack in daylight?

338
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,122
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

339
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:28,437
They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

340
00:37:28,527 --> 00:37:31,758
-Why is that? Why now?
-You ask a lot of questions.

341
00:37:31,847 --> 00:37:33,200
Usually l ask only two:

342
00:37:33,287 --> 00:37:35,005
What are we dealing with?
How do l kill it?

343
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:38,636
My father spent most of his life
looking for answers year after year.

344
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:41,639
Tearing through the tower,
combing through the family archives.

345
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,957
-Carl, the tower. Start there.
-Right.

346
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:47,357
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive till Dracula's killed.

347
00:37:47,447 --> 00:37:50,883
And who will kill him if not me?
Who will show courage if not me?

348
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:53,356
Go alone and you'll be outmanned
and outpositioned.

349
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:55,278
And you can't see in the dark.

350
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:57,756
ln the morning, we will hunt him...

351
00:37:58,407 --> 00:38:00,363
but we'll do it together.

352
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:03,958
[Soft, tense instrumental music]

353
00:38:06,247 --> 00:38:09,045
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

354
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:13,002
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

355
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:18,477
lt's a bit of both, l think.

356
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:24,719
-l promised you a drink.
-Yes, you did.

357
00:38:25,527 --> 00:38:28,087
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

358
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:31,364
ANNA: As for me, l'm going to finish this
once and for all.

359
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:33,797
VAN HELSlNG: Sorry you've to carry
this burden alone.

360
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:36,117
On the contrary,
l would wish for it no other way.

361
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:37,845
l'm sorry about your father
and brother.

362
00:38:37,927 --> 00:38:39,280
l will see them again.

363
00:38:39,367 --> 00:38:42,165
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

364
00:38:42,247 --> 00:38:46,365
-There's a brighter side of death?
-Yes. lt's just harder to see.

365
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:54,998
l'm sorry about that, too.

366
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:09,046
Van Helsing!

367
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:20,886
Van Helsing?

368
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:42,638
-Velkan?
-Anna.

369
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:45,398
Oh, my God, you're alive.

370
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:49,005
No. Anna, l only have a moment.

371
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:51,317
ANNA: But there's a werewolf--
VELKAN: Listen to me!

372
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:53,762
l know Dracula's secret.
He has a....

373
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:00,720
ANNA: Velkan?
VELKAN: Please.

374
00:42:01,847 --> 00:42:03,565
No!

375
00:42:29,607 --> 00:42:31,359
Run, Anna.

376
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:50,476
VAN HELSlNG: Anna!

377
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,196
Are you all right?

378
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:58,276
Anna!

379
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:15,361
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

380
00:43:15,447 --> 00:43:16,482
Werewolf!

381
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:18,478
Right. You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

382
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:19,841
VAN HELSlNG: Well done.

383
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:08,319
Who's hunting whom?

384
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,282
Nice night.
This is a bit tight for me.

385
00:44:20,527 --> 00:44:24,281
But for you it's a perfect fit.

386
00:44:25,687 --> 00:44:27,359
TOP HAT: What a coincidence.

387
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,357
TOP HAT: l see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

388
00:44:30,447 --> 00:44:32,324
VAN HELSlNG: Don't worry, he's getting to it.

389
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:33,840
VAN HELSlNG: You don't seem bothered.

390
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:35,326
TOP HAT: l'm no threat to him.

391
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:38,205
l'm just the one
who cleans up after him...

392
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,119
if you get my meaning.

393
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:42,198
Little late to be digging graves,
isn't it?

394
00:44:42,287 --> 00:44:44,437
Never too late to dig graves.

395
00:44:46,007 --> 00:44:49,283
You never know
when you'll need a fresh one.

396
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,879
Oh, sorry. lt's just my nature.

397
00:45:12,807 --> 00:45:14,160
-Move!
-No!

398
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,965
VAN HELSlNG: Why?
ANNA: You're choking me!

399
00:45:21,207 --> 00:45:25,837
-Give me a reason not to.
-l can't. lf people knew....

400
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,401
He's not your brother anymore, Anna!

401
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:35,241
-You knew?
-Yes.

402
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,725
Before or after l stopped you
from shooting him?

403
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:40,796
Before.

404
00:45:40,927 --> 00:45:42,326
And still you tried to kill him!

405
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,125
He's a werewolf!
He's gonna kill people!

406
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:45,686
He can't help it!
lt's not his fault!

407
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,041
l know, but he'll do it anyway!

408
00:45:47,127 --> 00:45:49,277
Do you understand forgiveness?

409
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:51,796
Yes. l ask for it often.

410
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:56,038
They say Dracula has a cure.

411
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,038
lf there's a chance
l can save my brother...

412
00:45:58,127 --> 00:45:59,276
-l'm going after it.
-No.

413
00:45:59,367 --> 00:46:02,086
-l need to find Dracula.
-And l need to find my brother!

414
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:05,637
He gave his life for me.
He's the only family l have left.

415
00:46:06,727 --> 00:46:09,799
l despise Dracula
more than you can ever imagine.

416
00:46:10,247 --> 00:46:14,081
He has taken everything from me,
leaving me alone in this world.

417
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:31,445
To have memories
of those you loved and lost...

418
00:46:32,007 --> 00:46:35,124
is perhaps harder
than to have no memories at all.

419
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,486
All right.

420
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:42,524
We'll look for your brother.

421
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:12,841
-lgor.
-Yes, master.

422
00:47:12,927 --> 00:47:16,317
-How long before we are ready?
-Soon, master. Very soon.

423
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,997
lt is difficult
without the good doctor...

424
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,282
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?

425
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:24,482
No!

426
00:47:25,767 --> 00:47:26,836
Good.

427
00:47:29,607 --> 00:47:33,282
ANNA: For me, this is all personal.
lt's all about family and honour.

428
00:47:33,927 --> 00:47:37,522
Why do you do it, this job of yours?
What do you hope to get out of it?

429
00:47:37,607 --> 00:47:40,326
l don't know.
Maybe some self-realization.

430
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,396
What have you got out of it so far?

431
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:45,606
Nightmares.

432
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:50,885
Werewolves only shed
before the first full moon.

433
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:52,923
Before the curse
has completely consumed them.

434
00:48:03,687 --> 00:48:06,406
VAN HELSlNG: What is this place?
ANNA: Castle Frankenstein.

435
00:48:06,847 --> 00:48:08,644
ANNA: But it should be abandoned.

436
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:09,796
l don't understand.

437
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,196
The man who lived here
was killed a year ago.

438
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,801
-A grave robber, among other things.
-A year ago.

439
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:17,276
lt was just after that
that your father went missing.

440
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:20,996
ANNA: Yes. He was looking for Dracula.
He was on his way to the sea.

441
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:24,284
l have never been to the sea.

442
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,318
l'll bet it's beautiful.

443
00:48:48,567 --> 00:48:52,162
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon.

444
00:48:53,327 --> 00:48:55,045
So hard to control.

445
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:19,838
l send you on a simple errand...

446
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:22,282
to find out
who our new visitor is...

447
00:49:22,887 --> 00:49:26,243
and you have to stop
for a little chat with your sister.

448
00:49:26,327 --> 00:49:29,876
Leave her out of this, Count.
She doesn't know your secret.

449
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,476
And l am soon to take it
to my grave.

450
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:37,082
DRACULA: Don't wish for death so quickly.
l intend for you to be quite useful.

451
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:38,839
VELKAN: l would rather die than help you.

452
00:49:38,927 --> 00:49:41,885
Don't be boring.
Everyone who says that dies.

453
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,525
Besides, tonight...

454
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:45,404
after the final stroke
of midnight...

455
00:49:45,487 --> 00:49:48,001
you will have no choice
but to obey me.

456
00:49:50,407 --> 00:49:51,840
Look familiar?

457
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,361
Father?

458
00:49:58,047 --> 00:49:59,719
No!

459
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:01,161
He proved useless.

460
00:50:01,247 --> 00:50:04,398
But l'm hoping, with werewolf venom
running through your veins...

461
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:06,364
you will be of greater benefit!

462
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:14,082
l may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not.

463
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:22,324
VELKAN: Never!

464
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,358
ANNA: Dwergi.
VAN HELSlNG: Dwergi?

465
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:44,723
Dracula's servants.
lndustrious but extremely vicious.

466
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:46,718
lf you get the chance to kill one,
do it...

467
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:49,446
-because they'll do worse to you.
-Right.

468
00:50:54,527 --> 00:50:57,360
They say they're using my brother
in some sort of experiment.

469
00:50:57,447 --> 00:50:59,722
My brother is still battling
the sickness within him.

470
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,763
-There's still hope.
-Anna.

471
00:51:02,407 --> 00:51:04,762
There is no hope for your brother.

472
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:08,118
But we can still protect others
by killing Dracula.

473
00:51:14,927 --> 00:51:16,485
Let us begin!

ANNA: What?

478
00:51:48,447 --> 00:51:50,802
VAN HELSlNG: A man with
three gorgeous women for 400 years.

479
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:52,957
Yes, vampires are the walking dead.

480

lt only makes sense
their children are born dead.

481
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,285
He's obviously trying

Ladies first.

Dracula and his brides only kill
one or two people a month.

lf he brings
all these things to life....

Teach them how. Teach them!

Velkan.

ls this your silver stake?

How long has it been?
300, 400 years?

You don't remember, do you?

Exactly what is it
l should be remembering?

You are the great Van Helsing.

518
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:05,476
Trained by monks and mullahs
from Tibet to lstanbul.

519
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:08,956
Protected by Rome herself.

520
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,963
But, like me, hunted by all others.

521
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,197
The Knights of the Holy Order
know all about you.

lt's no surprise
you would know about me.

Yes, but it's much more than this.

524

We have such history,
you and l, Gabriel.

So would you like me

A few details from your sordid past.

01:01:30,807 --> 01:01:33,799
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

01:01:35,607 --> 01:01:39,395

Murdered 1462.

You are a monk.

Well, actually l'm just a friar.

Truly.

took the key to life to his grave.

Hunt them down.

553
01:04:35,647 --> 01:04:37,160
Kill them both.

554
01:04:40,047 --> 01:04:42,402

ANNA: What, did you think
we haven't tried everything before?

556
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:47,801
ANNA: We've shot him, stabbed him,
clubbed him...

557
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:50,526
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart...

558
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:52,325
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

559
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:54,284
No one knows how to kill Dracula.

560
01:04:54,367 --> 01:04:57,803
Well, l could have used
that information a little earlier.

Don't give me that look.

You were right. l'm sorry.

563
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:09,877
He's not my brother anymore.

564
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:26,647
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

565
01:05:28,327 --> 01:05:30,761
Not sure.
l hope to find out someday.

566
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:32,883
That's what keeps me going.

567
01:05:34,287 --> 01:05:37,757
-Here's to what keeps you going.
-Absinthe. Strong stuff.

568
01:05:41,767 --> 01:05:44,406
Don't let it touch your tongue.
lt'll knock you on your--

569
01:06:04,407 --> 01:06:05,601
Vampire.

570
01:06:08,527 --> 01:06:09,755
Vampires!

571
01:06:16,767 --> 01:06:18,405
Now l remember.

572
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:34,038
''Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night

573
01:06:34,767 --> 01:06:38,965
''May become a wolf
when the wolfbane blooms

574
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:41,842
''And the moon is shining bright

575
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:45,405
''Or crave another's blood
when the sun goes down

576
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:47,637
''And his body takes to flight''

577
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:28,037
There's something down here.

578
01:07:30,327 --> 01:07:32,124
VAN HELSlNG: And it's carnivorous.

579
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:38,239
VAN HELSlNG: Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

580
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:46,758
l'd say he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

581
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:49,683
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

582
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:54,565
He has a bad gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth.

583
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,680
How do you know he has copper teeth?

584
01:07:56,767 --> 01:07:59,201
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

585
01:08:04,367 --> 01:08:07,439
Oh, my God!
The Frankenstein monster!

586
01:08:07,527 --> 01:08:10,564
Monster? Who's the monster here?

587
01:08:12,527 --> 01:08:14,165
l have done nothing wrong...

588
01:08:14,247 --> 01:08:17,284
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead!

589
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:39,719
What do you want?

590
01:08:41,487 --> 01:08:43,079
To exist.

591
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:56,356
Don't!

592
01:08:56,647 --> 01:08:57,966
-We must kill it.
-Wait.

593
01:08:58,047 --> 01:09:01,323
lf you value your lives
and the lives of your kind...

594
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:04,236
-you will kill me.
-No.

595
01:09:05,127 --> 01:09:06,958
lf Dracula finds me....

596
01:09:09,087 --> 01:09:12,397
l am the key to my father's machine.

597
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:15,085
The key to life.

598
01:09:15,887 --> 01:09:18,640
Life for Dracula's children.

599
01:09:18,727 --> 01:09:20,285
He already awakened them last night.

600
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:21,482
FRANKENSTElN: Two.

601
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:24,884
And those were from only one bride.

602
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:28,801
From one single birthing.

603
01:09:29,327 --> 01:09:32,364
And they died
as they did the last time he tried.

604
01:09:35,487 --> 01:09:40,117
Only with me
can he give them lasting life.

605
01:09:40,327 --> 01:09:42,761
There are more?
More of those things?

606
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:45,161
Thousands.

607
01:09:46,607 --> 01:09:48,040
Thousands more.

608
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:03,076
VAN HELSlNG: No.
ANNA: You heard what he said.

609
01:10:03,167 --> 01:10:06,204
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.

610
01:10:06,287 --> 01:10:07,800
l can sense evil.

611
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:10,117
VAN HELSlNG: This thing, man,
whatever it is...

612
01:10:10,207 --> 01:10:12,596
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

613
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:15,599
But evil does not rule it,
so l cannot kill it.

614
01:10:16,007 --> 01:10:18,043
-l can.
-Not while l'm here.

615
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:22,836
Anna.

616
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:25,956
Your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.

617
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:29,005
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

618
01:10:37,807 --> 01:10:40,321
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

619
01:10:41,047 --> 01:10:42,446
Now they'll come for him.

620
01:10:42,527 --> 01:10:44,358
Neither you nor l
will be able to stop them.

621
01:10:44,447 --> 01:10:47,564
lf l can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

622
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:49,126
And then the painting came alive...

623
01:10:49,207 --> 01:10:50,925
and the two creatures
attacked each other.

624
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:52,804
-What does it mean?
-l don't know.

625
01:10:52,887 --> 01:10:55,560
Listen, Carl, whatever you do,
don't stare at him.

626
01:10:57,287 --> 01:10:58,925
l'm staring at him.

627
01:10:59,407 --> 01:11:00,726
ls that a man?

628
01:11:00,807 --> 01:11:02,877
VAN HELSlNG: Actually, seven men.
Parts, anyway.

629
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,481
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

630
01:11:05,607 --> 01:11:07,325
Me and all of humanity!

631
01:11:07,407 --> 01:11:09,796
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

632
01:11:09,887 --> 01:11:11,559
Not even a werewolf.

633
01:11:11,807 --> 01:11:14,116
Anything else, you're on your own.

634
01:11:27,767 --> 01:11:30,361
-Let me go.
-Where are you going to go?

635
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:32,244
l don't know
if you've seen a mirror lately...

636
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:33,840
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd.

637
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:50,039
We must not let the creature
be destroyed!

638
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:59,081
Save him! Save the monster!

639
01:14:19,127 --> 01:14:20,242
VERONA: Stakes!

640
01:14:30,247 --> 01:14:31,885
No!

641
01:14:51,527 --> 01:14:52,801
CARL: Oh, my God.

642
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:02,159
What are you doing out here?

643
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,475
Right.

644
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,365
Don't let go!

645
01:15:18,087 --> 01:15:19,440
l can help!

646
01:15:19,527 --> 01:15:20,880
You won't kill me?

647
01:15:20,967 --> 01:15:22,844
Only if you don't hurry!

648
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,236
Jump!

649
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:43,716
Velkan.

650
01:16:48,087 --> 01:16:49,202
Velkan.

651
01:16:51,087 --> 01:16:52,236
Anna...

652
01:16:59,607 --> 01:17:00,926
forgive me.

653
01:17:09,127 --> 01:17:10,845
l will see you again.

654
01:17:21,647 --> 01:17:23,239
ANNA: You killed him.

655
01:17:25,087 --> 01:17:27,601
Now you know
why they call me murderer.

656
01:17:35,447 --> 01:17:36,721
Oh, my God.

657
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,159
You've been bitten.

658
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,036
Anna!

659
01:18:06,927 --> 01:18:07,916
Anna.

660
01:18:31,807 --> 01:18:35,846
So much trouble to my master.
So much trouble.

661
01:18:36,207 --> 01:18:37,322
What do you want?

662
01:18:37,607 --> 01:18:39,723
ALEERA: The master commands a trade.

663
01:18:41,687 --> 01:18:45,646
The monster for the Princess.

664
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:48,396
Somewhere public. Lots of people.

665
01:18:50,767 --> 01:18:52,917
A place where your master
will be less inclined...

666
01:18:53,007 --> 01:18:54,963
to expose his other side.

667
01:18:57,487 --> 01:19:00,126
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.

668
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:05,363
Here in Budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

669
01:19:16,087 --> 01:19:17,679
-Are you all right?
-No.

670
01:19:20,967 --> 01:19:22,366
He has been bitten.

671
01:19:22,447 --> 01:19:24,165
FRANKENSTElN: Bitten by a werewolf.

672
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:29,196
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

673
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:37,966
l am sorry.

674
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:42,243
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

675
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,443
VAN HELSlNG: Well,
they won't find him in here.

676
01:19:49,727 --> 01:19:51,285
l'm sure this is some sort of sin.

677
01:19:51,367 --> 01:19:53,927
VAN HELSlNG: God will forgive us.
We need to save Anna.

678
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:55,486
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

679
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:57,205
VAN HELSlNG: Carl, help me!
CARL: Right.

680
01:19:57,287 --> 01:19:59,926
CARL: How many commandments
can we break in one day?

681
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:01,884
CARL: Anyway, according to the book...

682
01:20:01,967 --> 01:20:05,323
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

683
01:20:05,407 --> 01:20:06,726
CARL: That's two nights from now.

684
01:20:06,807 --> 01:20:09,685
CARL: You'll still be able
to fight Dracula's hold over you...

685
01:20:09,767 --> 01:20:11,166
until the final stroke of midnight.

686
01:20:11,247 --> 01:20:12,919
VAN HELSlNG: So l have nothing
to worry about.

687
01:20:13,007 --> 01:20:14,360
CARL: My God, you should be terrified.

688
01:20:14,447 --> 01:20:15,675
VAN HELSlNG: Thanks.
CARL: Sorry.

689
01:20:15,767 --> 01:20:18,122
CARL: We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

690
01:20:18,807 --> 01:20:20,320
You sure he can't get out of there?

691
01:20:20,407 --> 01:20:22,716
VAN HELSlNG: Not without
some help from the dead.

692
01:21:44,687 --> 01:21:47,520
How does it feel
to be a puppet on my string?

693
01:21:47,767 --> 01:21:49,962
l won't let you trade me, Count.

694
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,802
l have no intention of trading you.

695
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:55,885
DRACULA: And if l know Van Helsing,
which l do...

696
01:21:55,967 --> 01:21:58,435
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

697
01:22:00,007 --> 01:22:02,646
Neither of us
has ever settled for half.

698
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,320
There they are.

699
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:12,278
You make my skin crawl.

700
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:17,918
This is not all l could do
with your skin.

701
01:22:27,567 --> 01:22:29,683
Carl, l need you to do something.

702
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:31,598
l'm not gonna like this, am l?

703
01:22:35,927 --> 01:22:38,122
DRACULA: Don't we make a lovely couple?

704
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:39,920
Oh, my God.

705
01:22:40,007 --> 01:22:42,157
DRACULA: l am looking
for a new bride, Anna.

706
01:22:43,927 --> 01:22:46,282
Someone strong and beautiful.

707
01:22:57,407 --> 01:22:59,557
One brief moment of pain...

708
01:23:01,207 --> 01:23:03,243
and we can be together forever.

709
01:23:11,007 --> 01:23:13,043
You have no heartbeat.

710
01:23:15,007 --> 01:23:17,680
DRACULA: Perhaps it just needs...

711
01:23:18,487 --> 01:23:20,239
to be rekindled.

712
01:23:44,487 --> 01:23:46,000
Anna. Anna!

713
01:23:46,167 --> 01:23:47,361
VAN HELSlNG: Wake up.

714
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:49,315
DRACULA: Gabriel.

715
01:23:57,687 --> 01:23:59,564
Oh, Gabriel.

716
01:24:02,527 --> 01:24:04,722
Welcome to my summer palace.

717
01:24:07,247 --> 01:24:09,920
Master! Look, master!

718
01:24:11,487 --> 01:24:13,603
We have him, master.

719
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:15,046
We have him!

720
01:24:16,687 --> 01:24:19,042
You wretched undead...

721
01:24:19,207 --> 01:24:21,402
l shall have my revenge!

722
01:24:21,847 --> 01:24:25,123
''Though l walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

723
01:24:25,287 --> 01:24:27,960
''l shall fear no evil.''

724
01:24:28,047 --> 01:24:30,959
You are nothing but damned bones...

725
01:24:31,287 --> 01:24:33,278
and damned souls...

726
01:24:33,367 --> 01:24:37,519
and will burn in the flames of Hell!

727
01:24:38,527 --> 01:24:40,438
[Ominous instrumental music]

728
01:24:42,807 --> 01:24:46,322
Now that everything
is as it should be...

729
01:24:47,807 --> 01:24:51,516
ladies and gentlemen,
l give to you...

730
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:55,158
Van Helsing!

731
01:25:00,087 --> 01:25:01,281
Come on.

732
01:25:04,247 --> 01:25:06,124
Yes!

733
01:25:08,727 --> 01:25:11,116
[Ominous instrumental music continues]

734
01:25:11,847 --> 01:25:14,486
Now l know what it's for.

735
01:25:15,127 --> 01:25:17,516
-Where are we going?
-Through that window!

736
01:25:34,727 --> 01:25:36,558
Carl, you're a genius!

737
01:25:37,247 --> 01:25:39,841
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

738
01:25:51,087 --> 01:25:53,362
Say goodbye to your friends.

739
01:26:12,527 --> 01:26:15,325
l'll find you!
l'll get you back and set you free!

740
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:16,886
l swear to God!

741
01:26:24,367 --> 01:26:26,437
-l must save him.
-No, you can't.

742
01:26:26,527 --> 01:26:27,562
Why?

743
01:26:27,687 --> 01:26:30,121
l cabled Rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation.

744
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:31,242
What did they say?

745
01:26:31,327 --> 01:26:32,726
CARL: Even if you kill Dracula...

746
01:26:32,807 --> 01:26:35,640
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

747
01:26:35,727 --> 01:26:36,762
He isn't evil.

748
01:26:36,847 --> 01:26:38,439
But they say he isn't human, either.

749
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,360
Do they know him? Have they spoken
to him? Who are they to judge?

750
01:26:41,447 --> 01:26:44,519
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

751
01:26:44,607 --> 01:26:46,802
What of me? Did you tell them
what l'm to become?

752
01:26:46,887 --> 01:26:48,605
VAN HELSlNG: Did they tell you
how to kill me?

753
01:26:48,687 --> 01:26:51,201
The correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart?

754
01:26:51,287 --> 01:26:53,721
The exact measure of silver
in each bullet?

755
01:26:54,327 --> 01:26:56,557
ANNA: Stop!
CARL: No, l left you out!

756
01:27:14,407 --> 01:27:15,681
l'm sorry.

757
01:27:20,447 --> 01:27:21,846
lt's starting.

758
01:27:35,927 --> 01:27:39,397
They must have taken
all the equipment to Dracula's lair.

759
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:41,325
Wherever that is.

760
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:47,606
Look, there's still time.

761
01:27:47,687 --> 01:27:50,485
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

762
01:27:50,567 --> 01:27:51,682
The sun sets in two hours.

763
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:54,156
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

764
01:27:54,247 --> 01:27:57,762
Yes, well, l wasn't around
for those 400 years, now, was l?

765
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:00,203
VAN HELSlNG: Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?

766
01:28:00,287 --> 01:28:03,324
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

767
01:28:03,407 --> 01:28:04,726
The son of your ancestor.

768
01:28:04,807 --> 01:28:06,638
Everybody knows that. What else?

769
01:28:06,807 --> 01:28:10,038
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...

770
01:28:10,127 --> 01:28:12,038
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

771
01:28:12,127 --> 01:28:13,685
VAN HELSlNG: Do you know
who murdered him?

772
01:28:13,767 --> 01:28:16,725
CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

773
01:28:16,807 --> 01:28:20,117
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

774
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:23,324
-he made a covenant with the Devil.
-And was given a new life.

775
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:26,319
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

776
01:28:26,407 --> 01:28:28,477
Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?

777
01:28:28,567 --> 01:28:29,556
BOTH: Sorry.

778
01:28:29,647 --> 01:28:32,525
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

779
01:28:32,607 --> 01:28:36,680
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

780
01:28:36,767 --> 01:28:37,961
He was to kill Dracula...

781
01:28:38,047 --> 01:28:41,403
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

782
01:28:41,647 --> 01:28:43,763
right down the line
all the way to you.

783
01:28:43,847 --> 01:28:45,439
ANNA: But he couldn't do it.

784
01:28:45,527 --> 01:28:48,405
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

785
01:28:48,487 --> 01:28:51,559
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

786
01:28:51,647 --> 01:28:54,286
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

787
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:56,164
-And then the Devil gave him wings.
-Yes.

788
01:28:56,247 --> 01:28:59,284
-All right, so where is this door?
-l don't know.

789
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:03,604
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

790
01:29:05,207 --> 01:29:07,767
So that future generations
might do it for him.

791
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:10,077
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

792
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,123
Clues to the door's location.

793
01:29:12,327 --> 01:29:13,555
The door.

794
01:29:16,087 --> 01:29:17,156
Of course.

795
01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:19,520
You said your father spent hours...

796
01:29:19,607 --> 01:29:21,723
staring at this painting,
trying to find the lair.

797
01:29:21,807 --> 01:29:23,559
l think you were right.
Quite literally.

798
01:29:23,647 --> 01:29:26,684
l think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

799
01:29:26,767 --> 01:29:28,485
Look. A Latin inscription.

800
01:29:28,567 --> 01:29:30,683
CARL: Maybe it works
like the painting in the tower.

801
01:29:30,767 --> 01:29:34,396
lf this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

802
01:29:34,727 --> 01:29:38,163
l can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

803
01:29:43,767 --> 01:29:46,281
-Your father didn't have this.
-Where did you get that?

804
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:47,925
VAN HELSlNG: Carl, finish it.

805
01:29:55,007 --> 01:29:57,680
ln the name of God, open this door.

806
01:30:09,407 --> 01:30:10,635
A mirror.

807
01:30:11,087 --> 01:30:13,555
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

808
01:30:13,647 --> 01:30:14,841
But why?

809
01:30:17,447 --> 01:30:20,200
Maybe, to Dracula
it's not a mirror at all.

810
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:43,642
lt's cold. And it's snowing.

811
01:30:48,687 --> 01:30:50,643
VAN HELSlNG: See you on the other side.

812
01:30:53,687 --> 01:30:55,006
Be careful.

813
01:31:35,247 --> 01:31:36,646
Castle Dracula.

814
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:41,517
[Ominous instrumental music]

815
01:32:25,687 --> 01:32:26,802
CARL: Do we have a plan?

816
01:32:26,887 --> 01:32:29,162
CARL: Doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo...

817
01:32:29,247 --> 01:32:30,475
but some sort of plan would be nice.

818
01:32:30,567 --> 01:32:32,125
VAN HELSlNG: We're going to stop Dracula.

819
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:33,566
ANNA: And kill anything
in our way.

820
01:32:33,647 --> 01:32:35,638
CARL: Well, you let me know how that goes.

821
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:48,717
Well, as grateful as l am
to be out of the cold...

822
01:32:48,807 --> 01:32:50,877
that doesn't seem like a good thing.

823
01:32:56,087 --> 01:32:57,918
We'd better get moving.

824
01:33:09,727 --> 01:33:11,604
CARL: So are all of those--
ANNA: Yes.

825
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:13,757
-And inside them are--
-Yes.

826
01:33:13,847 --> 01:33:16,645
lgor do this! lgor do that!

827
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:21,481
How did you find....
lt's impossible!

828
01:33:26,327 --> 01:33:28,557
-Please don't kill me!
-Why not?

829
01:33:29,647 --> 01:33:31,205
Well, l....

830
01:33:41,527 --> 01:33:43,643
My master has awakened.

831
01:34:03,927 --> 01:34:06,122
-There is a cure.
-What?

832
01:34:06,367 --> 01:34:10,406
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

833
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:15,725
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!

834
01:34:26,607 --> 01:34:28,404
ANNA: Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

835
01:34:28,487 --> 01:34:30,239
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?

836
01:34:30,327 --> 01:34:32,477
-l don't care!
-l do.

837
01:34:33,047 --> 01:34:35,402
Why does he need one? Why?

838
01:34:36,047 --> 01:34:39,835
Because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf.

839
01:34:39,967 --> 01:34:41,446
The painting. That's what it meant.

840
01:34:41,527 --> 01:34:44,564
ANNA: Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

841
01:34:44,647 --> 01:34:47,764
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure...

842
01:34:47,847 --> 01:34:50,884
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him.

843
01:34:52,087 --> 01:34:53,440
You're going to take these two...

844
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:55,961
-and lead them to the antidote.
-No, l'm not.

845
01:34:57,047 --> 01:34:58,366
Yes, l am.

846
01:34:58,887 --> 01:35:01,447
Here's the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight...

847
01:35:01,527 --> 01:35:02,755
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

848
01:35:02,847 --> 01:35:04,200
We just need to find the cure...

849
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:06,084
and get it into you
before the final stroke.

850
01:35:06,167 --> 01:35:07,805
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

851
01:35:07,887 --> 01:35:10,560
lf they even suspect you
of misleading them...

852
01:35:10,647 --> 01:35:12,080
clip off one of his fingers.

853
01:35:12,167 --> 01:35:14,283
-l'll clip off something.
-The tower over there...

854
01:35:14,367 --> 01:35:16,642
-that's where it is.
-And what about the other tower?

855
01:35:16,727 --> 01:35:18,080
-Give me that!
-That is where...

856
01:35:18,167 --> 01:35:21,364
we reassembled the laboratory.
Would l lie to you?

857
01:35:22,487 --> 01:35:24,125
Not if you wanted to live.

858
01:35:25,047 --> 01:35:28,756
Now, if l'm not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight....

859
01:35:32,127 --> 01:35:34,436
-l don't think l could.
-You must.

860
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:41,361
Come on.

861
01:35:43,487 --> 01:35:44,715
l don't like this plan.

862
01:35:44,807 --> 01:35:47,321
We don't have a choice.
Just don't get killed.

863
01:35:47,567 --> 01:35:49,080
You still don't understand.

864
01:35:49,167 --> 01:35:51,283
lt doesn't matter
what happens to me.

865
01:35:51,407 --> 01:35:53,238
We must save my family.

866
01:35:53,727 --> 01:35:56,480
lf you're late, run like hell.

867
01:36:00,567 --> 01:36:02,046
Don't be late.

868
01:36:15,047 --> 01:36:17,481
Now go. Go.

869
01:36:42,127 --> 01:36:44,721
FRANKENSTElN: Get off me,
you vermin from hell!

870
01:36:48,207 --> 01:36:51,597
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

871
01:36:51,767 --> 01:36:55,680
To prove that God is not
the only one who can create life!

872
01:36:56,207 --> 01:37:00,246
And now you must give that life
to my children.

873
01:37:00,887 --> 01:37:01,922
Up!

874
01:38:13,247 --> 01:38:14,805
There it is.

875
01:38:19,847 --> 01:38:21,405
l'll go first.

876
01:38:42,927 --> 01:38:43,996
Carl!

877
01:38:46,567 --> 01:38:48,523
Stay as long as you like.

878
01:38:48,607 --> 01:38:51,280
You try to get lgor. lgor get you!

879
01:39:32,727 --> 01:39:36,845
-Go ahead. Grab it.
-You go ahead and grab it.

880
01:39:37,127 --> 01:39:38,640
lf there's one thing l've learned...

881
01:39:38,727 --> 01:39:41,958
it's never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material.

882
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:51,479
-Did l scare you?
-No.

883
01:39:52,527 --> 01:39:55,917
Then maybe l need
to try a little harder.

884
01:40:03,047 --> 01:40:05,515
Viscous material!
What did l tell you?

885
01:40:05,687 --> 01:40:07,245
Get it!

886
01:40:15,767 --> 01:40:17,837
Hot.

887
01:40:17,927 --> 01:40:18,916
-Come on!
-Yes.

888
01:40:19,007 --> 01:40:22,363
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!

889
01:40:25,327 --> 01:40:27,079
You can't go until l say you can go!

890
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,680
Keep running, Carl!

891
01:40:29,847 --> 01:40:32,566
And l'll say you can go
when you're dead!

892
01:41:14,287 --> 01:41:15,720
CARL: Oh, my God!

893
01:41:44,567 --> 01:41:48,082
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

894
01:41:48,167 --> 01:41:50,806
-My friends are doing it for me.
-Friends.

895
01:41:50,887 --> 01:41:52,525
Yes. You want one?

896
01:41:52,607 --> 01:41:55,121
l can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.

897
01:41:55,207 --> 01:41:57,004
l am accustomed to pain.

898
01:41:57,087 --> 01:41:58,805
lt lets you know you're alive.

899
01:42:16,047 --> 01:42:18,117
Give me life!

900
01:42:32,807 --> 01:42:36,402
One more bolt
and my young will live.

901
01:42:49,367 --> 01:42:51,483
VAN HELSlNG: You're almost out, my friend!

902
01:45:03,607 --> 01:45:05,040
Help me!

903
01:45:05,567 --> 01:45:07,603
But you're supposed to die.

904
01:45:08,247 --> 01:45:10,397
l want to live.

905
01:45:13,207 --> 01:45:14,526
All right!

906
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,763
Be happy in the knowledge...

907
01:45:21,847 --> 01:45:25,635
that l shall weep
over your dead body.

908
01:45:29,647 --> 01:45:31,763
Hang on!

909
01:45:32,567 --> 01:45:34,797
l'll swing you loose!

910
01:46:07,367 --> 01:46:09,278
You are too late, my friend.

911
01:46:10,647 --> 01:46:12,444
My children live.

912
01:46:13,127 --> 01:46:16,278
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

913
01:46:16,647 --> 01:46:17,841
Correct.

914
01:46:20,367 --> 01:46:21,641
So be it.

915
01:46:25,727 --> 01:46:26,762
One.

916
01:46:33,727 --> 01:46:35,922
No, this cannot be.

917
01:46:48,607 --> 01:46:51,679
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

918
01:46:52,127 --> 01:46:55,836
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

919
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:45,279
Go! Go and help Van Helsing!

920
01:47:49,127 --> 01:47:50,401
Now!

921
01:47:51,687 --> 01:47:53,006
Thank you.

922
01:48:18,527 --> 01:48:22,839
Oh, my God!
Anna, l need a little help!

923
01:48:26,727 --> 01:48:27,842
Hurry!

924
01:48:38,007 --> 01:48:40,077
ANNA: Throw it to me, Carl!

925
01:48:46,647 --> 01:48:47,636
Yes!

926
01:49:07,927 --> 01:49:11,158
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was l.

927
01:49:11,687 --> 01:49:14,247
But l escaped. So can you.

928
01:49:55,367 --> 01:49:56,959
ALEERA: Anna, my love...

929
01:49:57,247 --> 01:50:00,717
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.

930
01:50:01,407 --> 01:50:03,398
What do you think of that?

931
01:50:07,447 --> 01:50:10,086
l think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

932
01:50:10,167 --> 01:50:12,237
Don't stand there talking about it.

933
01:50:35,607 --> 01:50:37,165
Don't you understand?

934
01:50:37,247 --> 01:50:41,001
We could be friends. Partners!

935
01:50:42,407 --> 01:50:43,999
Brothers-in-arms!

936
01:51:13,287 --> 01:51:17,565
Did l mention that it was you
who murdered me?

937
01:51:18,047 --> 01:51:21,676
lt must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

938
01:51:22,607 --> 01:51:24,996
to be the Left Hand of God.

939
01:51:27,607 --> 01:51:30,246
All l want is life, Gabriel.

940
01:51:30,807 --> 01:51:32,843
The continuation of my kind.

941
01:51:33,647 --> 01:51:37,276
And perhaps the return of my ring.

942
01:51:41,247 --> 01:51:44,045
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

943
01:51:45,527 --> 01:51:49,918
l shall give you back your life,
your memory.

944
01:51:51,207 --> 01:51:53,402
Some things
are better left forgotten.

945
01:52:25,647 --> 01:52:26,875
For God!

946
01:52:35,487 --> 01:52:36,966
God forgive me.

947
01:53:10,567 --> 01:53:11,886
She's dead.

948
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:10,438
CARL: ''Eternal rest grant unto her,
Oh, Lord, and let perpetual light...

949
01:54:10,527 --> 01:54:12,836
''shine upon her.
On her soul and the souls of all...
