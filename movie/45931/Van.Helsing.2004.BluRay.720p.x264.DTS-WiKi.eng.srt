this is all a test of faith.

And now,
we need you to go to the East.

168

To the far side of Romania.

169
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:47,039
An accursed land...

170

of nightmarish creatures.

171
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:53,545
CARDlNAL: Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

172
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,215
VAN HELSlNG: Dracula?
CARDlNAL: Yes.

You've never faced one
like this before.

174
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:03,722
Our story begins 450 years ago...

175
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:07,351
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

176
00:16:07,601 --> 00:16:11,146
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

177
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,233
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

178
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,735
They have not succeeded...

179
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,863
and they are running out of family.

180
00:16:20,823 --> 00:16:25,077
CARDlNAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

181
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,830
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

182
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:34,253
CARDlNAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

183
00:16:34,586 --> 00:16:37,881
CARDlNAL: If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

184
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:40,092
nine generations of their family...

185
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,803
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

186
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:45,264
For more than four centuries...

187
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:48,058
this family has defended
our left flank.

188
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:50,019
They gave their lives.

189
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:53,439
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

190
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:55,816
So you're sending me into hell.

191
00:16:57,901 --> 00:16:59,278
In a manner.

192
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:06,035
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

193
00:17:06,785 --> 00:17:08,620
We don't know its purpose...

left it lightly.

"ln the name of God,
open this door."

197
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,132
There is an insignia.

198

Yes, it matches your ring.

you may find the answer you seek.

VAN HELSlNG: Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?

970
01:31:45,306 --> 01:31:48,475
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

971
01:31:48,559 --> 01:31:49,935
The son of your ancestor.

972
01:31:50,019 --> 01:31:51,937
Everybody knows that. What else?

973
01:31:52,104 --> 01:31:55,482
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...

974
01:31:55,566 --> 01:31:57,568
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

975
01:31:57,651 --> 01:31:59,278
VAN HELSlNG: Do you know
who murdered him?

976
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:02,448
CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

977
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:05,993
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

978
01:32:06,076 --> 01:32:09,330
-he made a covenant with the Devil.
-And was given a new life.

979
01:32:09,413 --> 01:32:12,458
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?

BOTH: Sorry.

982
01:32:15,919 --> 01:32:18,922
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

983
01:32:19,006 --> 01:32:23,260
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

01:32:23,344 --> 01:32:24,595
He was to kill Dracula...

985
01:32:24,678 --> 01:32:28,182
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

ANNA: But he couldn't do it.

988
01:32:32,478 --> 01:32:35,481
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

989
01:32:35,564 --> 01:32:38,776
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

990
01:32:38,859 --> 01:32:41,612
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

991
01:32:41,695 --> 01:32:43,572
-And then the Devil gave him wings.
-Yes.

-I don't know.

993

kill his son, he left clues.

994
01:32:52,998 --> 01:32:55,668
So that future generations
might do it for him.

was looking for in here.
