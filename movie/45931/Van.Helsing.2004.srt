1
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:53,883
It's alive.

2
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:58,053
It's alive. It's alive!

3
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:15,903
There he is! Hit it again!

4
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:26,913
Success!

5
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:29,332
Count, it's just you.

6
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:33,252
I was beginning
to lose faith, Victor.

7
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:39,007
A pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled...

8
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:41,510
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

9
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:42,928
Yes.

10
00:01:43,011 --> 00:01:45,513
I must escape this place.

11
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:48,683
Where are you going to run,
Victor?

12
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:54,855
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome...

13
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,358
in most of the civilized world.

14
00:01:57,441 --> 00:02:01,278
I'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

15
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:03,113
No, no, Victor.

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,616
The time has come
for me to take command of him.

17
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:08,534
What are you saying?

18
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,787
Why do you think I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

19
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:14,540
- Equipped your laboratory?
- You said...

20
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:18,210
- You said you believed in my work.
- And I do.

21
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:23,548
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said...

22
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:27,135
a triumph of science...

23
00:02:28,136 --> 00:02:29,804
over God...

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,227
it must now serve my purpose.

25
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:41,231
What purpose?

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,411
Good God!

27
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:58,664
I would kill myself
before helping in such a task.

28
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:03,084
Feel free. I don't actually need you
anymore, Victor.

29
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:05,003
I just need him.

30
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,338
He is the key.

31
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:11,342
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

32
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,094
I could.

33
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:17,014
In fact,
my brides are insisting upon it.

34
00:03:20,517 --> 00:03:22,686
Igor, help me!

35
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,855
You have been
so kind to me, Doctor...

36
00:03:26,356 --> 00:03:28,608
caring, thoughtful.

37
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,360
But he pays me.

38
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:36,699
Stay back.

39
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:39,368
You can't kill me, Victor.

40
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,625
I'm already dead.

41
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,845
Dr. Frankenstein!

42
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,851
Look, it's headed for the windmill!
Come on!

43
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,894
Burn it! Burn it down!

44
00:06:44,454 --> 00:06:45,705
Vampires.

45
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:48,291
- Run for your lives!
- Vampires!

46
00:07:09,894 --> 00:07:11,062
Father.

47
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:28,438
Evening.

48
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:32,692
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

49
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:36,362
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

50
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:46,329
I missed you in London.

51
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:50,208
No, you bloody did not!
You got me good.

52
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:53,210
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted
by the Knights of the Holy Order...

53
00:09:53,294 --> 00:09:54,503
It's Mr. Hyde now.

54
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,506
...for the murder of 12 men,
six women, four...

55
00:09:57,631 --> 00:10:02,469
...children, three goats, and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry!

56
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:06,806
So you're the great Van Helsing.

57
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,309
And you're a deranged psychopath.

58
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,441
We all have our little problems.

59
00:10:19,818 --> 00:10:22,237
My superiors would like for me
to take you alive...

60
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,906
so that they may extricate
your better half.

61
00:10:25,031 --> 00:10:27,492
I bet they bloody would.

62
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:31,412
Personally, I'd rather just kill you
and call it a day.

63
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,081
But let's make it your decision,
shall we?

64
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:35,624
Do let's.

65
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,688
Here I come...

66
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:02,274
ready or not!

67
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:07,862
The bell!

68
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,891
No, no.

69
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:43,145
I'll bet that's upsetting.

70
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,990
Paris!

71
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,495
Come here.

72
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:08,501
I think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

73
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:16,675
It's been a pleasure knowing you.
Au revoir!

74
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:38,278
Oh, no.

75
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:47,954
My turn.

76
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,311
May he rest in peace.

77
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:32,995
Van Helsing.

78
00:13:33,663 --> 00:13:36,332
You murderer!

79
00:14:03,607 --> 00:14:04,941
Bless me, Father, for I have...

80
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:07,944
Sinned. Yes, I know.
You're very good at that.

81
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:10,696
You shattered the Rose Window.

82
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,532
Not to split hairs, sir,
but Mr. Hyde did the shattering.

83
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:17,286
13th century. Over 600 years old.

84
00:14:18,704 --> 00:14:22,207
- I wish you a week in hell for that.
- It would be a nice reprieve.

85
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:25,710
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable...

86
00:14:25,877 --> 00:14:28,963
but your methods
attract far too much attention.

87
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,966
"Wanted" posters?
We are not pleased.

88
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:34,718
Do you think I like being
the most wanted man in Europe?

89
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:37,137
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

90
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:39,389
Because we do not exist.

91
00:14:39,723 --> 00:14:41,725
Well, then neither do I.

92
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:49,065
When we found you crawling up
the steps of this church, half-dead...

93
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:52,818
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do God's work.

94
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,488
- Why can't he do it himself?
- Don't blaspheme.

95
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:59,241
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

96
00:14:59,992 --> 00:15:01,743
If you wish to recover it...

97
00:15:01,827 --> 00:15:04,663
I suggest you continue
to heed the call.

98
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:09,250
Without us,
the world would be in darkness.

99
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:12,503
Governments and empires
come and go...

100
00:15:12,587 --> 00:15:17,174
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial.

101
00:15:17,591 --> 00:15:20,093
We are the last defense
against evil.

102
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:23,597
An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

103
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,268
To you, these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished.

104
00:15:29,936 --> 00:15:32,104
I'm the one standing there
when they die...

105
00:15:32,188 --> 00:15:33,939
and become the men they once were.

106
00:15:34,023 --> 00:15:37,526
For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

107
00:15:38,026 --> 00:15:41,530
And now,
we need you to go to the East.

108
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:44,699
To the far side of Romania.

109
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:47,118
An accursed land...

110
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:50,204
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

111
00:15:50,371 --> 00:15:53,624
Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

112
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,293
- Dracula?
- Yes.

113
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,463
You've never faced one
like this before.

114
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,800
Our story begins 450 years ago...

115
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:07,470
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

116
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,224
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

117
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:14,310
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

118
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,812
They have not succeeded...

119
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:19,982
and they are running out of family.

120
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,153
His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

121
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:27,906
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

122
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,328
His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

123
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:37,998
If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

124
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,167
nine generations of their family...

125
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,919
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

126
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,338
For more than four centuries...

127
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,174
this family has defended
our left flank.

128
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,093
They gave their lives.

129
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,512
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

130
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,931
So you're sending me into hell.

131
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,351
In a manner.

132
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:06,107
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

133
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:08,693
We don't know its purpose...

134
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,362
but he would not have
left it lightly.

135
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:14,031
The Latin inscription translates as:

136
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:17,368
"In the name of God,
open this door."

137
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:20,203
There is an insignia.

138
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,876
Yes, it matches your ring.

139
00:17:27,877 --> 00:17:32,215
I think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

140
00:17:39,304 --> 00:17:41,473
Faster, please. Faster!

141
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,392
Faster! Faster! Faster!

142
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:47,061
Getting there.

143
00:17:47,145 --> 00:17:48,980
- Carl!
- There you are.

144
00:17:49,397 --> 00:17:52,315
Did you bring Mr. Hyde back,
or did you kill him?

145
00:17:52,316 --> 00:17:55,236
You killed him, didn't you?
That's why they get so annoyed.

146
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:58,572
When they ask you to bring someone
back, they don't mean as a corpse.

147
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:00,574
All right, you're in a mood.
Come on.

148
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:03,326
I have some things that'll
put the bit back in your mouth.

149
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,495
Any idiot can make a sword.

150
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,497
Sorry, Father.

151
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,124
- Come along, Carl.
- Here, take this:

152
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:14,336
Rings of garlic, holy water...

153
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:19,758
silver stake, crucifix.

154
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:24,846
Why can't I have one of those?

155
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:27,473
You've never gone after vampires
before now, have you?

156
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,851
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

157
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,352
Best when cooked well.

158
00:18:31,435 --> 00:18:32,520
No, they're not all the same.

159
00:18:32,603 --> 00:18:36,105
A vampire is nothing like a warlock.
My granny could kill a warlock.

160
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,192
Carl, you've never even been
out of the abbey.

161
00:18:38,358 --> 00:18:41,111
- How do you know about vampires?
- I read.

162
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:43,947
Here's something new.

163
00:18:44,447 --> 00:18:46,491
Glycerin 48.

164
00:18:51,454 --> 00:18:53,789
Sorry!

165
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:56,375
What in Allah's name
is wrong with you?

166
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,002
The air around here
is thick with envy.

167
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,923
This is my latest invention.
It's gas-propelled.

168
00:19:02,964 --> 00:19:05,300
Capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession...

169
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:09,053
at tremendous velocity.
Just pull the trigger and hold on.

170
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:11,889
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

171
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:14,975
Trust me, you'll need this.
A work of certifiable genius.

172
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:18,228
- If you don't say so yourself.
- No, I did say so myself.

173
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,147
I'm a veritable cornucopia
of talent.

174
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,732
Did you invent this?

175
00:19:21,815 --> 00:19:23,650
I've been working on that
for 12 years.

176
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,652
It's compressed magma
from Mt. Vesuvius...

177
00:19:25,735 --> 00:19:27,820
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

178
00:19:27,946 --> 00:19:30,031
- It's one of a kind.
- What's it for?

179
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:32,658
I don't know,
but I'm sure it'll come in handy.

180
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:34,994
Twelve years,
and you don't know what it does?

181
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:37,663
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't know what it's for.

182
00:19:37,746 --> 00:19:40,165
What it does
is to create a light source...

183
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:41,833
equal to the intensity of the sun.

184
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:43,502
This will come in handy how?

185
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,837
I don't know.
You can blind your enemies.

186
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,131
Charbroil a herd
of charging wildebeest.

187
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,674
Use your imagination.

188
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:52,510
No, I'm gonna use yours.
That's why you're coming with me.

189
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:55,095
- Holy hell be damned I am!
- You cursed.

190
00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:56,847
Not very well, but you're a monk.

191
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,265
You shouldn't curse at all.

192
00:19:58,348 --> 00:20:01,935
Actually, I'm still just a friar.
I can curse all I want...

193
00:20:02,018 --> 00:20:03,186
damn it!

194
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:06,356
The Cardinal has ordered you
to keep me alive.

195
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:10,359
- For as long as possible.
- But I'm not a field man.

196
00:20:12,236 --> 00:20:14,447
I don't want to go to Transylvania.

197
00:20:55,484 --> 00:20:56,652
Come on.

198
00:20:56,944 --> 00:21:00,155
Dracula unleashed you for a reason.

199
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,970
Pull me up!

200
00:21:25,011 --> 00:21:26,429
It's stuck!

201
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:38,107
- No, Anna, it will kill you!
- That's my brother out there.

202
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,028
Cut the rope! Cut it now!

203
00:21:56,874 --> 00:21:58,042
Velkan!

204
00:22:08,968 --> 00:22:10,845
My gun! Find my gun!

205
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,723
Find Velkan's gun.
It has to be the silver bullets.

206
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,393
Anna, hurry!

207
00:22:18,477 --> 00:22:19,895
Hurry!

208
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:23,648
Move.

209
00:22:25,483 --> 00:22:27,068
Anna, look out!

210
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:30,655
Run!

211
00:23:00,766 --> 00:23:02,100
Velkan.

212
00:23:07,272 --> 00:23:08,439
God...

213
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:11,776
help us.

214
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,511
- So, what do you remember?
- Not now, Carl.

215
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:28,763
There must be something.

216
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:32,016
I remember fighting the Romans
at Masada.

217
00:24:32,433 --> 00:24:35,019
- That was in 73 A.D.
- You asked.

218
00:24:37,938 --> 00:24:39,523
What are we doing here?

219
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,942
Why is it so important
to kill this Dracula, anyway?

220
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:45,028
- Because he's the son of the Devil.
- I mean, besides that.

221
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:48,197
If we kill him, anything bitten
or created by him will also die.

222
00:24:48,281 --> 00:24:49,532
I mean, besides that.

223
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:52,368
Welcome to Transylvania.

224
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,714
- Is it always like this?
- Pretty much.

225
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,884
You, turn around.

226
00:25:13,804 --> 00:25:15,973
- Let me see your faces.
- Why?

227
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,308
Because we don't trust strangers.

228
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:20,727
Strangers don't last long here.

229
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,396
5'7" by 2'3".

230
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:27,817
Gentlemen, you will now be disarmed.

231
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,236
You can try.

232
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:36,325
You refuse to obey our laws?

233
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:39,661
- The laws of men mean little to me.
- Fine.

234
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:41,413
Kill them.

235
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:44,332
- I'm here to help you.
- I don't need any help.

236
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:45,667
Really?

237
00:26:01,598 --> 00:26:04,434
Everybody inside!

238
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:06,603
Hide the children!

239
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:35,546
Stay here.

240
00:26:35,963 --> 00:26:38,632
You stay here.
They're trying to kill me.

241
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:47,974
- Marishka, kill the stranger.
- Love to.

242
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,980
Run!

243
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:06,908
Carl, it's not working.

244
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:09,827
Try aiming at their hearts.

245
00:27:51,115 --> 00:27:52,533
It's the sun.

246
00:28:54,256 --> 00:28:55,508
Van Helsing.

247
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,515
Do you like to fly, Anna?

248
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:00,984
Hello, Anna.

249
00:30:06,322 --> 00:30:08,408
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.

250
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:55,034
Did I do something to you
in a past life?

251
00:30:55,284 --> 00:30:57,453
Don't play coy with me, Princess.

252
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,542
I know what lurks
in your lusting heart.

253
00:31:04,793 --> 00:31:07,295
I hope you have a heart, Aleera...

254
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:10,381
because someday I'm going to drive
a stake through it.

255
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:23,310
This should do the trick.

256
00:31:24,477 --> 00:31:25,979
Holy water!

257
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,738
Stop your teasing, Marishka,
and finish him.

258
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:41,910
Too bad. So sad.

259
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:43,995
The church!

260
00:31:55,923 --> 00:31:57,841
Thirty years old.

261
00:31:58,258 --> 00:31:59,927
Perfectly aged.

262
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,846
Hello, Anna, my dear.

263
00:32:14,106 --> 00:32:16,859
The last of the Valerious.

264
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,894
I can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins.

265
00:32:56,562 --> 00:32:58,063
Here she comes!

266
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:05,153
I want first bite.

267
00:34:25,143 --> 00:34:28,062
- He killed a bride!
- He killed Marishka!

268
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,568
You killed Marishka!

269
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:38,155
- You killed a vampire!
- But isn't that a good thing?

270
00:34:38,238 --> 00:34:41,158
Vampires only kill what they need
to survive.

271
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:43,326
One or two people a month.

272
00:34:43,827 --> 00:34:46,830
Now they will kill for revenge.

273
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,669
- Are you always this popular?
- Pretty much.

274
00:34:53,836 --> 00:34:58,257
So what name, my good sir,
do I carve on your gravestone?

275
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,509
His name is Van Helsing.

276
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:09,434
Your reputation precedes you.

277
00:35:14,688 --> 00:35:17,775
Next time stay close.
You're no good to me dead.

278
00:35:18,525 --> 00:35:21,695
Well, I'll say this for you.
You've got courage.

279
00:35:22,112 --> 00:35:25,532
He's the first one to kill a vampire
in over 100 years.

280
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,368
I'd say that's earned him a drink.

281
00:35:33,873 --> 00:35:36,709
Marishka!

282
00:35:44,966 --> 00:35:47,427
Why can't they just
leave us alone?

283
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:51,846
We never kill more than our fill
and less than our share.

284
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,808
Can they say the same?

285
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:57,227
Did I not stress
how important it was...

286
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,938
to be finished
with Anna Valerious...

287
00:36:00,188 --> 00:36:03,733
before she destroys
what we are trying to create?

288
00:36:03,817 --> 00:36:06,944
- We lost Marishka.
- Master.

289
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:10,615
There, there, my darlings.
Do not worry.

290
00:36:10,865 --> 00:36:13,492
- I shall find another bride.
- What?

291
00:36:14,785 --> 00:36:19,081
- Do we mean so little to you?
- Have you no heart?

292
00:36:19,456 --> 00:36:23,585
No, I have no heart! I feel no love!

293
00:36:24,169 --> 00:36:25,712
Nor fear...

294
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:28,339
nor joy...

295
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:31,217
nor sorrow!

296
00:36:33,094 --> 00:36:35,638
I am hollow.

297
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:42,769
And I will live forever.

298
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,564
- My Lord.
- It is not so bad.

299
00:36:49,692 --> 00:36:51,944
I am at war with the world...

300
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:55,197
and every living soul in it.

301
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:59,034
But soon
the final battle will begin.

302
00:36:59,284 --> 00:37:01,286
I must go and find out
who our new visitor is.

303
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:10,044
You will have to make
a little apéritif out of him.

304
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,672
We are much too close to success
to be interrupted now.

305
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:17,468
- No!
- The last experiment was a failure!

306
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:21,638
Please, say you will not try again.

307
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:26,392
My heart could not bear the sorrow
if we fail again.

308
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,653
Come.

309
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,490
Do not fear me.

310
00:37:41,656 --> 00:37:44,075
Everybody else fears me.

311
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,828
Not my brides.

312
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:52,083
Igor.

313
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:55,169
Yes, master.

314
00:37:56,086 --> 00:37:58,505
Why do you torment that thing so?

315
00:37:59,256 --> 00:38:00,757
It's what I do.

316
00:38:01,008 --> 00:38:03,593
Remember, lgor, "Do unto others..."

317
00:38:03,718 --> 00:38:07,889
Before they do unto me, master.

318
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:11,100
Now go, all of you!

319
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:14,019
To Castle Frankenstein!

320
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:19,024
Yes, we will try again.

321
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:25,612
- So, how did you get here?
- We came by sea.

322
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:27,615
- Really? The sea?
- Well, yes.

323
00:38:27,699 --> 00:38:30,451
- The Adriatic Sea?
- Where do I find Dracula?

324
00:38:31,035 --> 00:38:34,038
He used to live in this very house
four centuries ago.

325
00:38:34,121 --> 00:38:36,040
No one knows where he lives now.

326
00:38:36,123 --> 00:38:38,208
Father would stare at that painting
for hours...

327
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:40,043
looking for Dracula's lair.

328
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:43,046
- So that's why you've come?
- I can help you.

329
00:38:43,797 --> 00:38:46,049
- No one can help me.
- I can try.

330
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:49,093
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

331
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,138
- I can handle this myself.
- So I noticed.

332
00:38:52,221 --> 00:38:54,807
The vampires attacked in daylight.
They never do that.

333
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,309
I was unprepared.
It won't happen again.

334
00:38:57,393 --> 00:38:59,144
So why did they attack in daylight?

335
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:01,563
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

336
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:03,940
They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

337
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:07,402
- Why is that? Why now?
- You ask a lot of questions.

338
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:08,903
Usually I ask only two:

339
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,822
What are we dealing with?
How do I kill it?

340
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:14,616
My father spent most of his life
looking for answers year after year.

341
00:39:14,617 --> 00:39:17,744
Tearing through the tower,
combing through the family archives.

342
00:39:17,745 --> 00:39:20,122
- Carl, the tower. Start there.
- Right.

343
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:23,667
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive till Dracula's killed.

344
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:27,337
And who will kill him if not me?
Who will show courage if not me?

345
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,922
Go alone and you'll be outmanned
and outpositioned.

346
00:39:30,006 --> 00:39:31,924
And you can't see in the dark.

347
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:34,510
In the morning, we will hunt him...

348
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,262
but we'll do it together.

349
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,271
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

350
00:39:46,771 --> 00:39:50,441
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

351
00:39:53,986 --> 00:39:56,113
It's a bit of both, I think.

352
00:39:59,449 --> 00:40:02,577
- I promised you a drink.
- Yes, you did.

353
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:06,122
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

354
00:40:06,247 --> 00:40:09,542
As for me, I'm going to finish this
once and for all.

355
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:12,128
Sorry you've to carry
this burden alone.

356
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:14,547
On the contrary,
I would wish for it no other way.

357
00:40:14,588 --> 00:40:16,298
I'm sorry about your father
and brother.

358
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:17,800
I will see them again.

359
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:20,843
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

360
00:40:20,844 --> 00:40:25,223
- There's a brighter side of death?
- Yes. It's just harder to see.

361
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,231
I'm sorry about that, too.

362
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,828
Van Helsing!

363
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:01,173
Van Helsing?

364
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:29,017
- Velkan?
- Anna.

365
00:43:29,892 --> 00:43:31,894
Oh, my God, you're alive.

366
00:43:33,896 --> 00:43:35,648
No. Anna, I only have a moment.

367
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:38,066
- But there's a werewolf...
- Listen to me!

368
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,569
I know Dracula's secret.
He has a...

369
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:47,784
- Velkan?
- Please.

370
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,828
No!

371
00:44:17,936 --> 00:44:19,771
Run, Anna.

372
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:39,706
Anna!

373
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:46,713
Are you all right?

374
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:47,880
Anna!

375
00:45:03,144 --> 00:45:05,647
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

376
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:06,815
Werewolf!

377
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:08,900
Right. You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

378
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:10,318
Well done.

379
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:00,864
Who's hunting whom?

380
00:46:09,705 --> 00:46:13,376
Nice night.
This is a bit tight for me.

381
00:46:13,626 --> 00:46:17,546
But for you it's a perfect fit.

382
00:46:18,964 --> 00:46:20,716
What a coincidence.

383
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:23,885
I see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

384
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:25,887
Don't worry, he's getting to it.

385
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,472
You don't seem bothered.

386
00:46:27,555 --> 00:46:29,057
I'm no threat to him.

387
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,059
I'm just the one
who cleans up after him...

388
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:34,061
if you get my meaning.

389
00:46:34,145 --> 00:46:36,230
Little late to be digging graves,
isn't it?

390
00:46:36,313 --> 00:46:38,565
Never too late to dig graves.

391
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:43,570
You never know
when you'll need a fresh one.

392
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:50,493
Oh, sorry. It's just my nature.

393
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:09,510
- Move!
- No!

394
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:16,600
- Why?
- You're choking me!

395
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,688
- Give me a reason not to.
- I can't. If people knew...

396
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,527
He's not your brother anymore, Anna!

397
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:31,530
- You knew?
- Yes.

398
00:47:33,115 --> 00:47:36,201
Before or after I stopped you
from shooting him?

399
00:47:36,285 --> 00:47:37,286
Before.

400
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:38,871
And still you tried to kill him!

401
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:40,789
He's a werewolf!
He's gonna kill people!

402
00:47:40,872 --> 00:47:42,374
He can't help it!
It's not his fault!

403
00:47:42,457 --> 00:47:43,792
I know, but he'll do it anyway!

404
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:46,127
Do you understand forgiveness?

405
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,796
Yes. I ask for it often.

406
00:47:51,299 --> 00:47:53,217
They say Dracula has a cure.

407
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:55,302
If there's a chance
I can save my brother...

408
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:56,553
- I'm going after it.
- No.

409
00:47:56,637 --> 00:47:59,473
- I need to find Dracula.
- And I need to find my brother!

410
00:47:59,556 --> 00:48:03,226
He gave his life for me.
He's the only family I have left.

411
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:07,564
I despise Dracula
more than you can ever imagine.

412
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,984
He has taken everything from me,
leaving me alone in this world.

413
00:48:26,998 --> 00:48:30,084
To have memories
of those you loved and lost...

414
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:33,921
is perhaps harder
than to have no memories at all.

415
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,424
All right.

416
00:48:39,676 --> 00:48:41,678
We'll look for your brother.

417
00:49:10,538 --> 00:49:13,290
- Igor.
- Yes, master.

418
00:49:13,374 --> 00:49:16,877
- How long before we are ready?
- Soon, master. Very soon.

419
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:20,714
It is difficult
without the good doctor...

420
00:49:20,797 --> 00:49:23,133
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?

421
00:49:24,301 --> 00:49:25,385
No!

422
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:27,887
Good.

423
00:49:30,723 --> 00:49:34,560
For me, this is all personal.
It's all about family and honour.

424
00:49:35,227 --> 00:49:38,981
Why do you do it, this job of yours?
What do you hope to get out of it?

425
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:41,900
I don't know.
Maybe some self-realization.

426
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:45,153
What have you got out of it so far?

427
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:47,405
Nightmares.

428
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:52,910
Werewolves only shed
before the first full moon.

429
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,079
Before the curse
has completely consumed them.

430
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:09,092
- What is this place?
- Castle Frankenstein.

431
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:11,427
But it should be abandoned.

432
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:12,678
I don't understand.

433
00:50:12,762 --> 00:50:15,181
The man who lived here
was killed a year ago.

434
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:17,850
- A grave robber, among other things.
- A year ago.

435
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:20,435
It was just after that
that your father went missing.

436
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:24,356
Yes. He was looking for Dracula.
He was on his way to the sea.

437
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:27,775
I have never been to the sea.

438
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:35,115
I'll bet it's beautiful.

439
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:56,802
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon.

440
00:50:58,053 --> 00:50:59,805
So hard to control.

441
00:51:23,577 --> 00:51:25,662
I send you on a simple errand...

442
00:51:25,745 --> 00:51:28,247
to find out
who our new visitor is...

443
00:51:28,831 --> 00:51:32,335
and you have to stop
for a little chat with your sister.

444
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:36,171
Leave her out of this, Count.
She doesn't know your secret.

445
00:51:36,422 --> 00:51:38,841
And I am soon to take it
to my grave.

446
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:43,678
Don't wish for death so quickly.
I intend for you to be quite useful.

447
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:45,513
I would rather die than help you.

448
00:51:45,597 --> 00:51:48,683
Don't be boring.
Everyone who says that dies.

449
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:50,351
Besides, tonight...

450
00:51:50,434 --> 00:51:52,353
after the final stroke
of midnight...

451
00:51:52,436 --> 00:51:55,022
you will have no choice
but to obey me.

452
00:51:57,524 --> 00:51:59,026
Look familiar?

453
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,781
Father?

454
00:52:05,532 --> 00:52:07,283
No!

455
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,785
He proved useless.

456
00:52:08,868 --> 00:52:12,121
But I'm hoping, with werewolf venom
running through your veins...

457
00:52:12,204 --> 00:52:14,206
you will be of greater benefit!

458
00:52:18,377 --> 00:52:22,214
I may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not.

459
00:52:27,552 --> 00:52:30,805
Never!

460
00:52:48,655 --> 00:52:50,656
- Dwergi.
- Dwergi?

461
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,160
Dracula's servants.
Industrious but extremely vicious.

462
00:52:54,243 --> 00:52:56,245
If you get the chance to kill one,
do it...

463
00:52:56,328 --> 00:52:59,081
- Because they'll do worse to you.
- Right.

464
00:53:04,419 --> 00:53:07,338
They say they're using my brother
in some sort of experiment.

465
00:53:07,422 --> 00:53:09,841
My brother is still battling
the sickness within him.

466
00:53:09,924 --> 00:53:11,926
- There's still hope.
- Anna.

467
00:53:12,593 --> 00:53:15,095
There is no hope for your brother.

468
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:18,599
But we can still protect others
by killing Dracula.

469
00:53:25,688 --> 00:53:27,273
Let us begin!

470
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:39,534
"No slacking! Up!"

471
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,633
- You ever see these things?
- No.

472
00:53:56,717 --> 00:53:59,386
- What do you think they are?
- Offspring.

473
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:00,554
What?

474
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:03,056
A man with three
gorgeous women for 400 years.

475
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,308
Yes, vampires are the walking dead.

476
00:54:05,392 --> 00:54:07,894
It only makes sense
their children are born dead.

477
00:54:07,977 --> 00:54:10,897
He's obviously trying
to bring them to life.

478
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:17,069
Ladies first.

479
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,929
Dracula and his brides only kill
one or two people a month.

480
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:49,098
If he brings
all these things to life...

481
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:08,449
- Throw the switches!
- Yes, master.

482
00:55:44,566 --> 00:55:45,650
What are you doing?

483
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:47,902
I want to see what we're up against.

484
00:56:18,597 --> 00:56:21,433
So this is what you get
when vampires mate.

485
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:44,871
Come on!

486
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:20,904
They need to feed.
Teach them how. Teach them!

487
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,330
And beg the Devil...

488
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:35,251
that this time they stay alive.

489
00:57:44,926 --> 00:57:47,512
- This is where I come in.
- No, wait!

490
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:00,524
Now that I have your attention...

491
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:26,631
Yes, well, that's interesting.

492
00:58:35,222 --> 00:58:38,642
That's not good. Must warn somebody.

493
00:58:52,321 --> 00:58:56,408
I can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat.

494
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,412
Usually when I approach...

495
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:05,333
I can almost dance to the beat.

496
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:11,339
Strange that yours is so steady.

497
00:59:20,013 --> 00:59:21,515
"Hurry up!"

498
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,936
We must keep the
atmosphere electrified!

499
00:59:28,688 --> 00:59:30,857
Accelerate the generators!

500
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:33,692
Power the dynamos!

501
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,695
We are losing power.

502
00:59:37,696 --> 00:59:39,781
The human is insufficient.

503
00:59:45,537 --> 00:59:46,704
Velkan.

504
00:59:59,883 --> 01:00:01,468
Oh, my God.

505
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:36,834
Feed, my darlings! Feed!

506
01:00:58,854 --> 01:01:00,522
May he rest in peace.

507
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:05,026
Hello, Gabriel.

508
01:02:03,246 --> 01:02:06,833
We must not lose
the master's progeny!

509
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,171
Is this your silver stake?

510
01:02:16,091 --> 01:02:20,095
How long has it been?
300, 400 years?

511
01:02:25,350 --> 01:02:27,185
You don't remember, do you?

512
01:02:28,853 --> 01:02:29,896
Exactly what is it
I should be remembering?

513
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,357
You are the great Van Helsing.

514
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:36,735
Trained by monks and mullahs
from Tibet to Istanbul.

515
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,449
Protected by Rome herself.

516
01:02:43,116 --> 01:02:46,619
But, like me, hunted by all others.

517
01:02:46,703 --> 01:02:48,955
The Knights of the Holy Order
know all about you.

518
01:02:49,038 --> 01:02:50,957
It's no surprise
you would know about me.

519
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,042
Yes, but it's much more than this.

520
01:02:57,713 --> 01:03:02,467
We have such history,
you and I, Gabriel.

521
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,892
Have you ever wondered why
you have such horrible nightmares?

522
01:03:12,143 --> 01:03:15,646
Horrific scenes
of ancient battles past.

523
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:21,902
How do you know me?

524
01:03:29,575 --> 01:03:32,578
- Velkan.
- Anna.

525
01:03:32,662 --> 01:03:34,413
No. Don't unstrap me.

526
01:03:34,497 --> 01:03:35,664
Don't unstrap me!

527
01:03:35,748 --> 01:03:38,584
No, you must not! No! Stop!

528
01:03:38,667 --> 01:03:40,252
Stop it.
I'm getting you out of here.

529
01:03:40,335 --> 01:03:42,921
Velkan, it's all right.
I'm taking you home.

530
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:53,681
So would you like me
to refresh your memory a little?

531
01:03:54,932 --> 01:03:57,851
A few details from your sordid past.

532
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:10,947
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

533
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:16,785
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

534
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:22,374
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.

535
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:26,878
Born 1422.

536
01:04:27,962 --> 01:04:31,549
Murdered 1462.

537
01:04:44,978 --> 01:04:46,813
Help me!

538
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:37,609
I think
we've overstayed our welcome.

539
01:06:24,235 --> 01:06:26,738
- Have you found the children?
- Not yet.

540
01:06:30,158 --> 01:06:33,494
- What happened?
- They just died.

541
01:06:38,499 --> 01:06:40,584
How can I ever repay you?

542
01:06:48,091 --> 01:06:50,676
But you can't do that.
You are a monk.

543
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:53,095
Well, actually I'm just a friar.

544
01:06:56,015 --> 01:06:59,518
I am sorry, master.
We try and we try...

545
01:06:59,601 --> 01:07:04,105
but I fear we are not so smart
as Dr. Frankenstein.

546
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:05,940
Truly.

547
01:07:07,191 --> 01:07:11,112
It would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave.

548
01:07:16,367 --> 01:07:17,951
Hunt them down.

549
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,122
Kill them both.

550
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:27,543
A silver stake? A crucifix?

551
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,546
What, did you think we
haven't tried everything before?

552
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:33,215
We've shot him, stabbed him,
clubbed him...

553
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:36,051
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart...

554
01:07:36,135 --> 01:07:37,886
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

555
01:07:38,053 --> 01:07:39,972
No one knows how to kill Dracula.

556
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:43,642
Well, I could have used
that information a little earlier.

557
01:07:43,975 --> 01:07:45,977
Don't give me that look.

558
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:53,234
You were right. I'm sorry.

559
01:07:54,068 --> 01:07:56,236
He's not my brother anymore.

560
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,669
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

561
01:08:15,421 --> 01:08:18,006
Not sure.
I hope to find out someday.

562
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:20,175
That's what keeps me going.

563
01:08:21,676 --> 01:08:25,263
- Here's to what keeps you going.
- Absinthe. Strong stuff.

564
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:32,186
Don't let it touch your tongue.
It'll knock you on your...

565
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:54,290
Vampire.

566
01:08:57,376 --> 01:08:58,627
Vampires!

567
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:07,635
Now I remember.

568
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:23,984
<i>"Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night</i>

569
01:09:24,734 --> 01:09:29,072
<i>"May become a wolf
when the wolfbane blooms</i>

570
01:09:29,822 --> 01:09:32,074
<i>"And the moon is shining bright</i>

571
01:09:32,742 --> 01:09:35,828
<i>"Or crave another's blood
when the sun goes down</i>

572
01:09:35,911 --> 01:09:38,163
<i>"And his body takes to flight"</i>

573
01:10:18,082 --> 01:10:20,251
There's something down here.

574
01:10:22,587 --> 01:10:24,505
And it's carnivorous.

575
01:10:27,675 --> 01:10:30,844
Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

576
01:10:35,098 --> 01:10:39,769
I'd say he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

577
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,772
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

578
01:10:43,522 --> 01:10:47,860
He has a bad gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth.

579
01:10:48,527 --> 01:10:50,112
How do you know he has copper teeth?

580
01:10:50,195 --> 01:10:52,697
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

581
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:01,289
Oh, my God!
The Frankenstein monster!

582
01:11:01,372 --> 01:11:04,542
Monster? Who's the monster here?

583
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:08,295
I have done nothing wrong...

584
01:11:08,378 --> 01:11:11,548
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead!

585
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:34,986
What do you want?

586
01:11:36,738 --> 01:11:38,489
To exist.

587
01:11:51,168 --> 01:11:52,294
Don't!

588
01:11:52,586 --> 01:11:54,004
- We must kill it.
- Wait.

589
01:11:54,087 --> 01:11:57,507
If you value your lives
and the lives of your kind...

590
01:11:58,049 --> 01:12:00,510
- You will kill me.
- No.

591
01:12:01,427 --> 01:12:03,346
If Dracula finds me...

592
01:12:05,598 --> 01:12:08,976
I am the key to my father's machine.

593
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:11,853
The key to life.

594
01:12:12,646 --> 01:12:15,523
Life for Dracula's children.

595
01:12:15,607 --> 01:12:17,192
He already awakened them last night.

596
01:12:17,317 --> 01:12:18,443
Two.

597
01:12:18,901 --> 01:12:22,029
And those were from only one bride.

598
01:12:23,447 --> 01:12:26,158
From one single birthing.

599
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:29,828
And they died
as they did the last time he tried.

600
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:37,961
Only with me
can he give them lasting life.

601
01:12:38,169 --> 01:12:40,713
There are more?
More of those things?

602
01:12:41,839 --> 01:12:43,132
Thousands.

603
01:12:44,717 --> 01:12:46,218
Thousands more.

604
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,898
- No.
- You heard what he said.

605
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:05,069
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.

606
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:06,820
I can sense evil.

607
01:13:06,862 --> 01:13:09,238
This thing, man, whatever it is...

608
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:11,825
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

609
01:13:11,908 --> 01:13:14,911
But evil does not rule it,
so I cannot kill it.

610
01:13:15,328 --> 01:13:17,497
- I can.
- Not while I'm here.

611
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:22,501
Anna.

612
01:13:23,252 --> 01:13:25,754
Your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.

613
01:13:25,838 --> 01:13:28,924
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

614
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:40,726
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

615
01:13:41,435 --> 01:13:42,853
Now they'll come for him.

616
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:44,897
Neither you nor I
will be able to stop them.

617
01:13:44,939 --> 01:13:48,275
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

618
01:13:48,358 --> 01:13:49,860
And then the painting came alive...

619
01:13:49,943 --> 01:13:51,737
and the two creatures
attacked each other.

620
01:13:51,862 --> 01:13:53,738
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.

621
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,616
Listen, Carl, whatever you do,
don't stare at him.

622
01:13:58,368 --> 01:14:00,078
I'm staring at him.

623
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:01,954
Is that a man?

624
01:14:02,079 --> 01:14:04,206
Actually, seven men.
Parts, anyway.

625
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,875
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

626
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:08,876
Me and all of humanity!

627
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:11,463
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

628
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:13,298
Not even a werewolf.

629
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:15,967
Anything else, you're on your own.

630
01:14:30,147 --> 01:14:32,858
- Let me go.
- Where are you going to go?

631
01:14:32,899 --> 01:14:34,818
I don't know
if you've seen a mirror lately...

632
01:14:34,943 --> 01:14:36,528
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd.

633
01:16:55,363 --> 01:16:58,533
We must not let the creature
be destroyed!

634
01:17:05,372 --> 01:17:07,958
Save him! Save the monster!

635
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:29,978
Stakes!

636
01:17:40,405 --> 01:17:42,114
No!

637
01:18:02,592 --> 01:18:03,968
Oh, my God.

638
01:18:11,808 --> 01:18:13,685
What are you doing out here?

639
01:18:13,768 --> 01:18:15,020
Right.

640
01:18:15,437 --> 01:18:17,021
Don't let go!

641
01:18:30,284 --> 01:18:31,660
I can help!

642
01:18:31,785 --> 01:18:33,203
You won't kill me?

643
01:18:33,286 --> 01:18:35,288
Only if you don't hurry!

644
01:19:19,412 --> 01:19:20,496
Jump!

645
01:19:58,531 --> 01:19:59,615
Velkan.

646
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,287
Velkan.

647
01:20:07,289 --> 01:20:08,457
Anna...

648
01:20:16,131 --> 01:20:17,507
forgive me.

649
01:20:26,056 --> 01:20:27,891
I will see you again.

650
01:20:39,152 --> 01:20:40,736
You killed him.

651
01:20:42,738 --> 01:20:45,324
Now you know
why they call me murderer.

652
01:20:53,456 --> 01:20:54,833
Oh, my God.

653
01:20:56,668 --> 01:20:58,419
You've been bitten.

654
01:21:12,933 --> 01:21:13,934
Anna!

655
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,363
Anna.

656
01:21:52,302 --> 01:21:56,514
So much trouble to my master.
So much trouble.

657
01:21:56,806 --> 01:21:58,057
What do you want?

658
01:21:58,308 --> 01:22:00,560
The master commands a trade.

659
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:06,732
The monster for the Princess.

660
01:22:07,066 --> 01:22:09,526
Somewhere public. Lots of people.

661
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:14,281
A place where your master
will be less inclined...

662
01:22:14,406 --> 01:22:16,408
to expose his other side.

663
01:22:18,993 --> 01:22:21,829
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.

664
01:22:22,496 --> 01:22:27,251
Here in Budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

665
01:22:38,428 --> 01:22:40,096
- Are you all right?
- No.

666
01:22:43,516 --> 01:22:44,975
He has been bitten.

667
01:22:45,017 --> 01:22:46,852
Bitten by a werewolf.

668
01:22:48,187 --> 01:22:52,107
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

669
01:22:59,864 --> 01:23:01,282
I am sorry.

670
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:05,703
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

671
01:23:11,041 --> 01:23:13,168
Well, they won't find him in here.

672
01:23:13,543 --> 01:23:15,128
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.

673
01:23:15,211 --> 01:23:17,881
God will forgive us.
We need to save Anna.

674
01:23:17,964 --> 01:23:19,465
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

675
01:23:19,632 --> 01:23:21,300
- Carl, help me!
- Right.

676
01:23:21,384 --> 01:23:24,136
How many commandments
can we break in one day?

677
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,180
Anyway, according to the book...

678
01:23:26,305 --> 01:23:29,807
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

679
01:23:29,808 --> 01:23:31,226
That's two nights from now.

680
01:23:31,351 --> 01:23:34,312
You'll still be able to
fight Dracula's hold over you...

681
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:35,814
until the final stroke of midnight.

682
01:23:35,897 --> 01:23:37,690
So I have nothing to worry about.

683
01:23:37,815 --> 01:23:39,192
My God, you should be terrified.

684
01:23:39,233 --> 01:23:40,568
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

685
01:23:40,651 --> 01:23:43,154
We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

686
01:23:43,863 --> 01:23:45,446
You sure he can't get out of there?

687
01:23:45,447 --> 01:23:47,908
Not without some help from the dead.

688
01:25:13,403 --> 01:25:16,322
How does it feel
to be a puppet on my string?

689
01:25:16,573 --> 01:25:18,908
I won't let you trade me, Count.

690
01:25:19,325 --> 01:25:21,869
I have no intention of trading you.

691
01:25:22,078 --> 01:25:25,039
And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do...

692
01:25:25,164 --> 01:25:27,666
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

693
01:25:29,334 --> 01:25:32,087
Neither of us
has ever settled for half.

694
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:40,136
There they are.

695
01:25:40,178 --> 01:25:42,096
You make my skin crawl.

696
01:25:43,305 --> 01:25:48,018
This is not all I could do
with your skin.

697
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,279
Carl, I need you to do something.

698
01:26:00,363 --> 01:26:02,281
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

699
01:26:06,785 --> 01:26:09,121
Don't we make a lovely couple?

700
01:26:09,454 --> 01:26:10,956
Oh, my God.

701
01:26:11,039 --> 01:26:13,291
I am looking for a new bride, Anna.

702
01:26:15,126 --> 01:26:17,545
Someone strong and beautiful.

703
01:26:29,139 --> 01:26:31,475
One brief moment of pain...

704
01:26:33,143 --> 01:26:35,228
and we can be together forever.

705
01:26:43,402 --> 01:26:45,487
You have no heartbeat.

706
01:26:47,573 --> 01:26:50,325
Perhaps it just needs...

707
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,994
to be rekindled.

708
01:27:18,268 --> 01:27:19,852
Anna. Anna!

709
01:27:20,019 --> 01:27:21,270
Wake up.

710
01:27:22,021 --> 01:27:23,356
Gabriel.

711
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:34,032
Oh, Gabriel.

712
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:39,370
Welcome to my summer palace.

713
01:27:41,956 --> 01:27:44,792
Master! Look, master!

714
01:27:46,377 --> 01:27:48,629
We have him, master.

715
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:50,130
We have him!

716
01:27:51,882 --> 01:27:54,301
You wretched undead...

717
01:27:54,467 --> 01:27:56,719
I shall have my revenge!

718
01:27:57,262 --> 01:28:00,640
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

719
01:28:00,807 --> 01:28:03,642
"I shall fear no evil."

720
01:28:03,726 --> 01:28:06,729
You are nothing but damned bones...

721
01:28:07,062 --> 01:28:09,148
and damned souls...

722
01:28:09,231 --> 01:28:13,568
and will burn in the flames of Hell!

723
01:28:19,115 --> 01:28:22,785
Now that everything
is as it should be...

724
01:28:24,328 --> 01:28:28,165
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

725
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:31,918
Van Helsing!

726
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:38,341
Come on.

727
01:28:41,427 --> 01:28:43,429
Yes!

728
01:28:49,393 --> 01:28:52,104
Now I know what it's for.

729
01:28:52,771 --> 01:28:55,273
- Where are we going?
- Through that window!

730
01:29:13,206 --> 01:29:15,125
Carl, you're a genius!

731
01:29:15,792 --> 01:29:18,586
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

732
01:29:30,305 --> 01:29:32,641
Say goodbye to your friends.

733
01:29:52,659 --> 01:29:55,577
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!

734
01:29:55,578 --> 01:29:57,163
I swear to God!

735
01:30:04,962 --> 01:30:07,089
- I must save him.
- No, you can't.

736
01:30:07,256 --> 01:30:08,340
Why?

737
01:30:08,424 --> 01:30:11,008
I cabled Rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation.

738
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:12,094
What did they say?

739
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:13,678
Even if you kill Dracula...

740
01:30:13,803 --> 01:30:16,764
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

741
01:30:16,848 --> 01:30:17,932
He isn't evil.

742
01:30:18,016 --> 01:30:19,600
But they say he isn't human, either.

743
01:30:19,767 --> 01:30:22,687
Do they know him? Have they spoken
to him? Who are they to judge?

744
01:30:22,728 --> 01:30:26,023
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

745
01:30:26,106 --> 01:30:28,400
What of me? Did you tell them
what I'm to become?

746
01:30:28,442 --> 01:30:30,277
Did they tell you how to kill me?

747
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,946
The correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart?

748
01:30:33,029 --> 01:30:35,615
The exact measure of silver
in each bullet?

749
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:38,534
- Stop!
- No, I left you out!

750
01:30:57,093 --> 01:30:58,469
I'm sorry.

751
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:04,934
It's starting.

752
01:31:19,572 --> 01:31:23,242
They must have taken
all the equipment to Dracula's lair.

753
01:31:23,492 --> 01:31:25,244
Wherever that is.

754
01:31:30,249 --> 01:31:31,750
Look, there's still time.

755
01:31:31,833 --> 01:31:34,753
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

756
01:31:34,836 --> 01:31:36,004
The sun sets in two hours.

757
01:31:36,087 --> 01:31:38,589
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

758
01:31:38,673 --> 01:31:42,343
Yes, well, I wasn't around
for those 400 years, now, was I?

759
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,929
Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?

760
01:31:45,012 --> 01:31:48,182
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

761
01:31:48,265 --> 01:31:49,600
The son of your ancestor.

762
01:31:49,683 --> 01:31:51,601
Everybody knows that. What else?

763
01:31:51,768 --> 01:31:55,188
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...

764
01:31:55,271 --> 01:31:57,273
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

765
01:31:57,357 --> 01:31:58,941
Do you know who murdered him?

766
01:31:59,025 --> 01:32:02,111
No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

767
01:32:02,194 --> 01:32:05,698
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

768
01:32:05,781 --> 01:32:09,034
- He made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

769
01:32:09,117 --> 01:32:12,120
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

770
01:32:12,204 --> 01:32:14,372
Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?

771
01:32:14,456 --> 01:32:15,540
Sorry.

772
01:32:15,623 --> 01:32:18,626
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

773
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:22,964
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

774
01:32:23,047 --> 01:32:24,298
He was to kill Dracula...

775
01:32:24,381 --> 01:32:27,885
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

776
01:32:28,135 --> 01:32:30,304
right down the line
all the way to you.

777
01:32:30,387 --> 01:32:32,055
But he couldn't do it.

778
01:32:32,139 --> 01:32:35,141
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

779
01:32:35,225 --> 01:32:38,478
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

780
01:32:38,561 --> 01:32:41,314
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

781
01:32:41,397 --> 01:32:43,232
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.

782
01:32:43,315 --> 01:32:46,485
- All right, so where is this door?
- I don't know.

783
01:32:47,653 --> 01:32:50,989
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

784
01:32:52,657 --> 01:32:55,327
So that future generations
might do it for him.

785
01:32:55,410 --> 01:32:57,745
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

786
01:32:57,829 --> 01:32:59,914
Clues to the door's location.

787
01:33:00,081 --> 01:33:01,415
The door.

788
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:05,169
Of course.

789
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:07,588
You said your father spent hours...

790
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:09,923
staring at this painting,
trying to find the lair.

791
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:11,842
I think you were right.
Quite literally.

792
01:33:11,925 --> 01:33:15,095
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

793
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:16,930
Look. A Latin inscription.

794
01:33:17,013 --> 01:33:19,265
Maybe it works like
the painting in the tower.

795
01:33:19,349 --> 01:33:23,102
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

796
01:33:23,436 --> 01:33:27,022
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

797
01:33:32,861 --> 01:33:35,530
- Your father didn't have this.
- Where did you get that?

798
01:33:35,613 --> 01:33:37,198
Carl, finish it.

799
01:33:44,622 --> 01:33:47,374
In the name of God, open this door.

800
01:33:59,635 --> 01:34:00,887
A mirror.

801
01:34:01,387 --> 01:34:03,973
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

802
01:34:04,056 --> 01:34:05,307
But why?

803
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,896
Maybe, to Dracula
it's not a mirror at all.

804
01:34:31,581 --> 01:34:35,335
It's cold. And it's snowing.

805
01:34:40,590 --> 01:34:42,591
See you on the other side.

806
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:47,179
Be careful.

807
01:35:29,134 --> 01:35:30,552
Castle Dracula.

808
01:36:21,682 --> 01:36:22,850
Do we have a plan?

809
01:36:22,933 --> 01:36:25,352
Doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo...

810
01:36:25,436 --> 01:36:26,687
but some sort of plan would be nice.

811
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:28,439
We're going to stop Dracula.

812
01:36:28,522 --> 01:36:29,940
And kill anything in our way.

813
01:36:30,023 --> 01:36:32,109
Well, you let me know how that goes.

814
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:45,704
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold...

815
01:36:45,788 --> 01:36:47,956
that doesn't seem like a good thing.

816
01:36:53,378 --> 01:36:55,296
We'd better get moving.

817
01:37:07,641 --> 01:37:09,560
- So are all of those...
- Yes.

818
01:37:09,643 --> 01:37:11,812
- And inside them are...
- Yes.

819
01:37:11,895 --> 01:37:14,814
Igor do this! Igor do that!

820
01:37:17,233 --> 01:37:19,902
How did you find...
It's impossible!

821
01:37:24,907 --> 01:37:27,242
- Please don't kill me!
- Why not?

822
01:37:28,410 --> 01:37:29,995
Well, I...

823
01:37:40,755 --> 01:37:43,007
My master has awakened.

824
01:38:04,110 --> 01:38:06,445
- There is a cure.
- What?

825
01:38:06,695 --> 01:38:10,866
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

826
01:38:12,033 --> 01:38:16,454
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!

827
01:38:27,798 --> 01:38:29,633
Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

828
01:38:29,716 --> 01:38:31,551
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?

829
01:38:31,635 --> 01:38:33,887
- I don't care!
- I do.

830
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:36,973
Why does he need one? Why?

831
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:41,561
Because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf.

832
01:38:41,727 --> 01:38:43,229
The painting. That's what it meant.

833
01:38:43,312 --> 01:38:46,482
Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

834
01:38:46,565 --> 01:38:49,818
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure...

835
01:38:49,902 --> 01:38:53,071
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him.

836
01:38:54,322 --> 01:38:55,740
You're going to take these two...

837
01:38:55,824 --> 01:38:58,409
- And lead them to the antidote.
- No, I'm not.

838
01:38:59,494 --> 01:39:00,912
Yes, I am.

839
01:39:01,412 --> 01:39:04,081
Here's the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight...

840
01:39:04,165 --> 01:39:05,499
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

841
01:39:05,583 --> 01:39:07,001
We just need to find the cure...

842
01:39:07,084 --> 01:39:08,919
and get it into you
before the final stroke.

843
01:39:09,002 --> 01:39:10,754
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

844
01:39:10,837 --> 01:39:13,590
If they even suspect you
of misleading them...

845
01:39:13,673 --> 01:39:15,175
clip off one of his fingers.

846
01:39:15,258 --> 01:39:17,510
- I'll clip off something.
- The tower over there...

847
01:39:17,594 --> 01:39:19,929
- That's where it is.
- And what about the other tower?

848
01:39:20,012 --> 01:39:21,430
- Give me that!
- That is where...

849
01:39:21,514 --> 01:39:24,850
we reassembled the laboratory.
Would I lie to you?

850
01:39:26,018 --> 01:39:27,770
Not if you wanted to live.

851
01:39:28,687 --> 01:39:32,607
Now, if I'm not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight...

852
01:39:36,111 --> 01:39:38,529
- I don't think I could.
- You must.

853
01:39:44,652 --> 01:39:45,903
Come on.

854
01:39:48,155 --> 01:39:49,406
I don't like this plan.

855
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:52,158
We don't have a choice.
Just don't get killed.

856
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:53,993
You still don't understand.

857
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:56,245
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

858
01:39:56,412 --> 01:39:58,331
We must save my family.

859
01:39:58,831 --> 01:40:01,667
If you're late, run like hell.

860
01:40:05,921 --> 01:40:07,506
Don't be late.

861
01:40:21,018 --> 01:40:23,604
Now go. Go.

862
01:40:49,294 --> 01:40:51,963
Get off me, you vermin from hell!

863
01:40:55,633 --> 01:40:59,136
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

864
01:40:59,303 --> 01:41:03,390
To prove that God is not
the only one who can create life!

865
01:41:03,974 --> 01:41:08,145
And now you must give that life
to my children.

866
01:41:08,812 --> 01:41:09,896
Up!

867
01:42:24,298 --> 01:42:25,883
There it is.

868
01:42:31,137 --> 01:42:32,806
I'll go first.

869
01:42:55,243 --> 01:42:56,327
Carl!

870
01:42:58,996 --> 01:43:01,082
Stay as long as you like.

871
01:43:01,165 --> 01:43:03,918
You try to get lgor. Igor get you!

872
01:43:47,124 --> 01:43:51,461
- Go ahead. Grab it.
- You go ahead and grab it.

873
01:43:51,711 --> 01:43:53,296
If there's one thing I've learned...

874
01:43:53,380 --> 01:43:56,799
it's never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material.

875
01:44:03,639 --> 01:44:06,725
- Did I scare you?
- No.

876
01:44:07,809 --> 01:44:11,313
Then maybe I need
to try a little harder.

877
01:44:18,736 --> 01:44:21,322
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

878
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:23,157
Get it!

879
01:44:31,998 --> 01:44:34,167
Hot.

880
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:35,335
- Come on!
- Yes.

881
01:44:35,418 --> 01:44:38,921
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!

882
01:44:42,007 --> 01:44:43,842
You can't go until I say you can go!

883
01:44:43,926 --> 01:44:45,511
Keep running, Carl!

884
01:44:46,678 --> 01:44:49,514
And I'll say you can go
when you're dead!

885
01:45:33,054 --> 01:45:34,556
Oh, my God!

886
01:46:04,583 --> 01:46:08,253
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

887
01:46:08,337 --> 01:46:11,089
- My friends are doing it for me.
- Friends.

888
01:46:11,172 --> 01:46:12,924
Yes. You want one?

889
01:46:13,008 --> 01:46:15,593
I can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.

890
01:46:15,677 --> 01:46:17,595
I am accustomed to pain.

891
01:46:17,678 --> 01:46:19,430
It lets you know you're alive.

892
01:46:37,447 --> 01:46:39,615
Give me life!

893
01:46:54,879 --> 01:46:58,633
One more bolt
and my young will live.

894
01:47:12,145 --> 01:47:14,397
You're almost out, my friend!

895
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:33,608
Help me!

896
01:49:34,192 --> 01:49:36,277
But you're supposed to die.

897
01:49:36,944 --> 01:49:39,197
I want to live.

898
01:49:42,116 --> 01:49:43,534
All right!

899
01:49:48,872 --> 01:49:51,041
Be happy in the knowledge...

900
01:49:51,124 --> 01:49:55,128
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

901
01:49:59,498 --> 01:50:01,667
Hang on!

902
01:50:02,501 --> 01:50:04,836
I'll swing you loose!

903
01:50:38,784 --> 01:50:40,786
You are too late, my friend.

904
01:50:42,204 --> 01:50:44,123
My children live.

905
01:50:44,790 --> 01:50:48,126
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

906
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:49,711
Correct.

907
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,715
So be it.

908
01:50:57,969 --> 01:50:59,053
One.

909
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:08,562
No, this cannot be.

910
01:51:21,824 --> 01:51:24,993
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

911
01:51:25,494 --> 01:51:29,331
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

912
01:52:16,457 --> 01:52:20,878
Go! Go and help Van Helsing!

913
01:52:24,882 --> 01:52:26,216
Now!

914
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:28,969
Thank you.

915
01:52:55,576 --> 01:53:00,080
Oh, my God!
Anna, I need a little help!

916
01:53:04,084 --> 01:53:05,252
Hurry!

917
01:53:15,845 --> 01:53:18,014
Throw it to me, Carl!

918
01:53:24,853 --> 01:53:25,937
Yes!

919
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,460
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.

920
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,630
But I escaped. So can you.

921
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:38,170
Anna, my love...

922
01:54:38,504 --> 01:54:42,091
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.

923
01:54:42,841 --> 01:54:44,927
What do you think of that?

924
01:54:49,097 --> 01:54:51,850
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

925
01:54:51,933 --> 01:54:54,102
Don't stand there talking about it.

926
01:55:18,457 --> 01:55:20,125
Don't you understand?

927
01:55:20,209 --> 01:55:24,129
We could be friends. Partners!

928
01:55:25,547 --> 01:55:27,215
Brothers-in-arms!

929
01:55:57,743 --> 01:56:02,247
Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?

930
01:56:02,748 --> 01:56:06,501
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

931
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:10,005
to be the Left Hand of God.

932
01:56:12,674 --> 01:56:15,426
All I want is life, Gabriel.

933
01:56:16,010 --> 01:56:18,179
The continuation of my kind.

934
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:22,766
And perhaps the return of my ring.

935
01:56:26,937 --> 01:56:29,856
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

936
01:56:31,357 --> 01:56:35,945
I shall give you back your life,
your memory.

937
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:39,615
Some things
are better left forgotten.

938
01:57:13,229 --> 01:57:14,480
For God!

939
01:57:23,489 --> 01:57:24,990
God forgive me.

940
01:58:00,022 --> 01:58:01,440
She's dead.

941
01:58:59,076 --> 01:59:02,496
"Eternal rest grant unto her,
Oh, Lord, and let perpetual light...

942
01:59:02,579 --> 01:59:04,998
"shine upon her.
On her soul and the souls of all...

943
01:59:11,671 --> 01:59:14,507
"On her soul and the souls of all...

944
01:59:14,841 --> 01:59:18,177
"the dead faithful have mercy..."
