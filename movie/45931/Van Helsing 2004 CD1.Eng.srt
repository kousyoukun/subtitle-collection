For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

And now,
we need you to go to the East.

168

To the far side of Romania.

169
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,035
An accursed land...

170
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,081
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

171
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,513
CARDINAL: Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

172
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,178
VAN HELSING: Dracula?
CARDINAL: Yes.

173

You've never faced one
like this before.

174
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,693
Our story begins 450 years ago...

175
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,323
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

176
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,126
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

177
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,229
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

178
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,741
They have not succeeded...

179
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,868
and they are running out of family.

180
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:25,079
CARDINAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

181
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,809
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

182
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:34,224
CARDINAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

183
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,859
CARDINAL: If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

184
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,057
nine generations of their family...

185
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,794
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

186
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,267
For more than four centuries...

187
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,033
this family has defended
our left flank.

188
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,005
They gave their lives.

189
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,404
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

190
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,810
So you're sending me into hell.

191
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,449
In a manner.

192
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,184
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

193
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,590
We don't know its purpose...

194

but he would not have
left it lightly.

196

"In the name of God,
open this door."

197
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,401
There is an insignia.

198
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,901
Yes, it matches your ring.

199
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:32,079
I think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

the son of Valerious the Elder.

who murdered him?

CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

977
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:05,911
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

978
01:32:05,987 --> 01:32:09,252
- he made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

979
01:32:09,323 --> 01:32:12,349
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

988
01:32:32,513 --> 01:32:35,380
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

989
01:32:35,449 --> 01:32:38,782
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

990
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:41,515
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

991
01:32:41,589 --> 01:32:43,489
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.

kill his son, he left clues.

So that future generations
might do it for him.

was looking for in here.
