00:00:01,011 --> 00:00:21,011
The Sound of Music - 1965

¡¾ÒôÀÖÖ®Éù¡¿

2
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,742
The hills are alive

3
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,418
With the sound of music

4
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,121
With songs they have sung

5
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:59,258
For a thousand years

6
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:02,691
The hills fill my heart

7
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:07,459
With the sound of music

8
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:14,904
My heart wants to sing Every song it hears

9
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,279
My heart wants to beat like the wings Of the birds that rise

10
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,609
From the lake to the trees

11
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,119
My heart wants to sigh Like a chime that flies

12
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,326
From a church on a breeze

13
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:36,086
To laugh like a brook When it trips and falls

14
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,823
Over stones on its way

15
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:43,970
To sing through the night

16
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,005
Like a lark who is learning to pray

17
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:53,975
I go to the hills

18
00:03:54,182 --> 00:04:00,348
When my heart is lonely

19
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,490
I know I will hear

20
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:09,187
What I've heard before

21
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,197
My heart will be blessed

22
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:22,207
With the sound of music

23
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:28,443
And I'll sing...

24
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:37,615
...once more

25
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:24,634
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:29,577
Hallelujah, hallelujah

27
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,845
- Reverend Mother. - Sister Bernice.

28
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,717
- I simply cannot find her. - Maria?

29
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,089
She's missing again.

30
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,394
We should've put a cowbell around her neck.

31
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,691
Have you tried the barn? You know how much she adores the animals.

32
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,697
I have looked everywhere. In all of the usual places.

33
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:51,133
Sister, considering it's Maria...

34
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:54,033
...I suggest you look in someplace unusual.

35
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,611
Well, Reverend Mother...

36
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,442
...I hope this new infraction ends whatever doubts...

37
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,949
...you may still have about Maria's future here.

38
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:11,216
I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

39
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,326
After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.

40
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:18,896
We are not talking about sheep, black or white, Sister Margaretta.

41
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:22,570
Of all the candidates for the novitiate, Maria is the least...

42
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,328
Children, children.

43
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:29,766
We were speculating about the qualifications of our postulants.

44
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,404
The Mistress of Novices and the Mistress of Postulants...

45
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:38,950
...were trying to help me by expressing opposite points of view.

46
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:42,247
Tell me, Sister Catherine, what do you think of Maria?

47
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,517
She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.

48
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,588
- Sister Agatha? - It's very easy to like Maria...

49
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,356
...except when it's difficult.

50
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:56,228
- And you, Sister Sophia? - Oh, I love her very dearly.

51
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,373
But she always seems to be in trouble, doesn't she?

52
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,199
Exactly what I say.

53
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:04,144
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

54
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,041
Her dress has got a tear

55
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:10,879
She waltzes on her way to Mass And whistles on the stair

56
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,013
And underneath her wimple She has curlers in her hair

57
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,887
I've even heard her singing In the abbey

58
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,120
She's always late for chapel

59
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,629
But her penitence is real

60
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,232
She's always late for everything

61
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,495
Except for every meal

62
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:35,571
I hate to have to say it But I very firmly feel

63
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,247
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

64
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,240
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

65
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,849
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

66
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,679
Maria makes me laugh

67
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,496
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

68
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:00,565
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

69
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,202
How do you find a word That means Maria?

70
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:05,831
A flibbertigibbet

71
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:07,405
- A will-o'-the-wisp - A clown

72
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,774
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

73
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:16,505
Many a thing she ought to understand

74
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:20,615
But how do you make her stay And listen to all you say?

75
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,681
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

76
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:29,022
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

77
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:35,060
How do you hold a moonbeam...

78
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,731
...in your hand?

79
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,302
When I'm with her I'm confused Out of focus and bemused

80
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:49,049
And I never know exactly where I am

81
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,583
- Unpredictable as weather - She's as flighty as a feather

82
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,785
- She's a darling - She's a demon

83
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,320
She's a lamb

84
00:12:56,724 --> 00:13:00,387
She'll out pester any pest Drive a hornet from its nest

85
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:03,894
She can throw a whirling dervish Out of whirl

86
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,993
- She is gentle, she is wild - She's a riddle, she's a child

87
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,130
- She's a headache - She's an angel

88
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,241
She's a girl

89
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:19,913
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

90
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:23,845
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

91
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:27,644
How do you find a word That means Maria?

92
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,913
- A flibbertigibbet - A will-o'-the-wisp

93
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,785
A clown

94
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,991
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

95
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,756
Many a thing she ought to understand

96
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:44,302
- But how do you make her stay - And listen to all you say?

97
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,635
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

98
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:54,679
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

99
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:17,401
How do you hold a moonbeam...

100
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:24,711
...in your hand?

101
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,515
You may go in now, Maria.

102
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,732
Come here, my child.

103
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,612
Now sit down.

104
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:05,110
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.

105
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:08,355
- The hills were beckoning and before... - Dear.

106
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,724
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

107
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,189
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

108
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,089
If you'll feel better.

109
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,396
Yes, you see, the sky was so blue today...

110
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:22,433
...and everything was so green and fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

111
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:27,198
The Untersberg led me higher like it wanted me to go through the clouds.

112
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:29,433
Suppose darkness had come and you were lost?

113
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,941
Mother, I could never be lost up there.

114
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:35,046
That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.

115
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,547
It was the mountain that led me to you.

116
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,288
When I was a child, I would come down and climb a tree...

117
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,319
...and look in your garden.

118
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:46,493
I'd see the sisters at work and hear them sing.

119
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,458
Which brings me to another transgression, Reverend Mother.

120
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,827
I was singing out there today.

121
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:58,529
Only in the abbey do we have rules about postulants singing.

122
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,765
I can't stop wherever I am.

123
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,307
Worse, I can't seem to stop saying things.

124
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,842
Everything I think and feel.

125
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,513
Some call that "honesty."

126
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:10,148
Oh, but it's terrible, Reverend Mother!

127
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:14,253
You know how Sister Berthe makes me kiss the floor after a disagreement?

128
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:18,114
Lately, I kiss the floor when I see her coming to save time.

129
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:21,955
Maria...

130
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:25,956
...when you saw us over the wall and longed to be with us...

131
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,933
...that didn't mean you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?

132
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,673
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

133
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,605
And I am learning. I really am.

134
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:39,506
What is the most important lesson you have learned here?

135
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,981
To find out what is the will of God and do it wholeheartedly.

136
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:47,947
Maria...

137
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,221
...it seems to be God's will that you leave us.

138
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:53,983
- Leave? - Only for a while.

139
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,827
No, Mother! Please don't send me away!

140
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:01,331
This is where I belong. It's my home, my family. It's my life.

141
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:05,029
- Are you truly ready for it? - Yes, I am.

142
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:10,142
If you go out into the world for a time, knowing what we expect of you...

143
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,141
...you will find out if you can expect it of yourself.

144
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:17,647
I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it! I promise I can!

145
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,417
Yes, Mother.

146
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,186
If it is God's will.

147
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,560
There is a family near Salzburg that needs a governess until September.

148
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,998
- September? - For seven children.

149
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,660
Seven children?!

150
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,167
Do you like children?

151
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,772
Well, yes, but seven!

152
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,073
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.

153
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,013
Captain?

154
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:53,551
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

155
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:56,518
His wife died, and he is alone with the children.

156
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:01,024
I understand he has had a difficult time keeping a governess there.

157
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,094
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

158
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:08,401
The Lord will show you in His own good time.

159
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:47,741
When the Lord closes a door...

160
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:50,467
...somewhere He opens a window.

161
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:57,808
What will this day be like?

162
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,249
I wonder

163
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,857
What will my future be?

164
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,963
I wonder

165
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,630
It could be so exciting

166
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,934
To be out in the world To be free

167
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:25,203
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

168
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,716
Oh, what's the matter with me?

169
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:35,113
I've always longed for adventure

170
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,950
To do the things I've never dared

171
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:42,390
Now here I'm facing adventure

172
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:48,795
Then why am I so scared?

173
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,141
A captain with seven children

174
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:58,209
What's so fearsome about that?

175
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,376
I must stop these doubts and worries

176
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,484
If I don't I just know I'll turn back

177
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,917
I must dream of the things I am seeking

178
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:15,986
I am seeking the courage I lack

179
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:20,732
The courage to serve them With reliance

180
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,903
Face my mistakes without defiance

181
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,866
Show them I'm worthy

182
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,769
And while I show them

183
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,843
I'll show me

184
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,451
So let them bring on All their problems

185
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,951
I'll do better than my best

186
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:45,283
I have confidence They'll put me to the test

187
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,962
But I'll make them see I have confidence in me

188
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:52,461
Somehow I will impress them

189
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,964
I will be firm but kind

190
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,536
And all those children Heaven bless them

191
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:03,073
They will look up to me And mind me

192
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,439
With each step I am more certain

193
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:09,979
Everything will turn out fine

194
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:13,311
I have confidence The world can all be mine

195
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:18,992
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me

196
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,291
I have confidence in sunshine

197
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:26,658
I have confidence in rain

198
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,768
I have confidence That spring will come again

199
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,097
Besides which you see I have confidence in me

200
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:36,467
Strength doesn't lie in numbers

201
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,770
Strength doesn't lie in wealth

202
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:43,347
Strength lies in nights Of peaceful slumbers

203
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,484
When you wake up, wake up It's healthy

204
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:49,779
All I trust I leave my heart to

205
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:52,925
All I trust becomes my own

206
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:57,928
I have confidence in confidence alone

207
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,173
Oh, help.

208
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,027
I have confidence in confidence alone

209
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:38,635
Besides which you see I have confidence...

210
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:45,709
...in me

211
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,653
Hello. Here I am.

212
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,322
I'm from the convent. I'm the new governess, captain.

213
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:04,226
And I'm the old butler, fraulein.

214
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,997
Well, how do you do?

215
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:22,573
You'll wait here, please.

216
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:53,032
In future, remember certain rooms in this house are not to be disturbed.

217
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,675
Yes, captain, sir.

218
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:08,850
- Why do you stare at me that way? - You don't look like a sea captain.

219
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:13,117
I'm afraid you don't look very much like a governess.

220
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:14,885
- Turn around. - What?

221
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,491
Turn.

222
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,827
Hat off.

223
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,666
Put on another dress before meeting the children.

224
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,532
But I don't have another.

225
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,676
When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes go to the poor.

226
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,174
What about this one?

227
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,711
The poor didn't want it.

228
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,042
There wasn't time to make a new dress. I can make clothes.

229
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:43,586
I'll see that you get some material.

230
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,849
Today, if possible.

231
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,590
- Now, fraulein... - Maria.

232
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,559
I don't know how much the abbess told you.

233
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,392
You are the twelfth governess...

234
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,070
...to look after my children since their mother died.

235
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,501
I trust you will be an improvement on the last one.

236
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,571
She stayed only two hours.

237
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:05,871
What's wrong with the children, sir?

238
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:11,751
Nothing is wrong with the children, only the governesses.

239
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:16,956
They could not maintain discipline, without which the house cannot be run.

240
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,688
Drill them in their studies.

241
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:23,419
I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays.

242
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,393
Each afternoon, they march, breathing deeply.

243
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,261
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

244
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,436
When do they play?

245
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:33,698
You will see to it that they conduct themselves with the utmost decorum.

246
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,876
- I am placing you in command. - Yes, sir.

247
00:27:57,524 --> 00:27:58,684
Now...

248
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:02,228
...this is your new governess, Fraulein Maria.

249
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,888
Give your name at your signal.

250
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,398
Fraulein, listen carefully. Learn their signals so you can call them.

251
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,070
Liesl.

252
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,069
Friedrich.

253
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:16,866
Louisa.

254
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,406
Kurt.

255
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:19,703
Brigitta.

256
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,208
Marta.

257
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:28,919
Gretl.

258
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,996
Now, let's see how well you listened.

259
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,597
I won't need to whistle for them, Reverend Captain.

260
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:43,325
I mean, I'll use their names. Such lovely names.

261
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,700
Fraulein, this is a large house. The grounds are extensive.

262
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,704
And I will not have anyone shouting.

263
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,672
You will take this, please. Learn to use it.

264
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,540
The children will help you.

265
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:59,575
Now, when I want you, this is what you will hear.

266
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:02,251
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

267
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,681
I could never answer to a whistle.

268
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:07,520
Whistles are for animals, not for children.

269
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,854
And definitely not for me.

270
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,725
It would be too humiliating.

271
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:18,733
Fraulein, were you this much trouble at the abbey?

272
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,131
Oh, much more, sir.

273
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,809
I don't know your signal.

274
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,916
You may call me "captain."

275
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,304
At ease.

276
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:55,665
Now that there's just us...

277
00:29:55,943 --> 00:30:00,107
...would you please tell me all your names again and how old you are.

278
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:04,574
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old, and I don't need a governess.

279
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,412
I'm glad you told me, Liesl. We'll just be good friends.

280
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:14,357
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm impossible.

281
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,322
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

282
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:20,089
Fraulein Josephine. Four governesses ago.

283
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,001
I'm Brigitta.

284
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,830
You didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.

285
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,773
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

286
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:33,775
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

287
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:37,780
I'm 10, and I think your dress is the ugliest one I ever saw.

288
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,746
- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that. - Why not?

289
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:43,218
- Don't you think it's ugly? - Of course.

290
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,186
But Fraulein Helga's was ugliest.

291
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,054
I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.

292
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:52,457
- Congratulations. - What's "incorrigible"?

293
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:56,567
I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.

294
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:02,038
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be seven on Tuesday.

295
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,674
I'd like a pink parasol.

296
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:06,402
Pink's my favorite color too.

297
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:09,975
Yes, you're Gretl.

298
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:12,579
And you're five years old?

299
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,011
My, you're practically a lady.

300
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:20,550
I have to tell you a secret. I've never been a governess.

301
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:24,759
You don't know anything about being a governess?

302
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:26,397
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

303
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:31,895
The best way to start is to tell Father to mind his own business.

304
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:33,902
Never come to dinner on time.

305
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:36,405
Never eat your soup quietly.

306
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,170
During dessert, always blow your nose.

307
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:42,211
Don't you believe a word they say, Fraulein Maria.

308
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,783
- Oh, why not? - Because I like you.

309
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:48,578
Children, outside for your walk.

310
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,689
Father's orders. Hurry up.

311
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,188
Quick, quick, quick.

312
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:55,623
Fraulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.

313
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:56,920
How do you do.

314
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,031
I'll show you to your room. Follow me.

315
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,874
Poor little dears.

316
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:29,961
You're very lucky. With Fraulein Helga it was a snake.

317
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,141
Good evening.

318
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,141
- Good evening, children. - Good evening, Fraulein Maria.

319
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:58,984
Enchanting little ritual.

320
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,922
Something you learned at the abbey?

321
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,462
No.

322
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,362
Rheumatism.

323
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:21,341
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?

324
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,525
For what we receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.

325
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,994
- Amen. - Amen.

326
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,467
I'd like to thank you all...

327
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:44,660
...for the precious gift you left in my pocket today.

328
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:49,972
What gift?

329
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,241
It's a secret between the children and me.

330
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:59,144
Then I suggest you keep it, and let us eat.

331
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,487
Knowing how nervous I must have been...

332
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:04,156
...a stranger in a new household...

333
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:07,417
...knowing how important it was for me to feel accepted...

334
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:11,892
...it was so kind and thoughtful of you to make my first moments here...

335
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:14,360
...so warm and happy...

336
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,331
...and pleasant.

337
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,604
- What is the matter, Marta? - Nothing.

338
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:41,050
Fraulein...

339
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:45,128
...is it to be at every meal or merely at dinnertime...

340
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:49,927
...that you intend leading us through this rare and wonderful new world...

341
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:51,798
...of indigestion?

342
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,240
They're all right, captain. They're just happy.

343
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:17,657
- Rolfe, good evening. - Good evening, Franz.

344
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,661
- I trust everything is under control? - Yes, yes.

345
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,736
- Are there any developments? - Perhaps.

346
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,099
- Is the captain home? - He's at dinner.

347
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,672
- With the family? - Yes.

348
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,740
Give him this telegram at once.

349
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,571
Certainly.

350
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:46,953
A telegram for you, sir.

351
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,627
Franz? Who delivered it?

352
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,957
That young lad Rolfe, of course.

353
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:58,032
Father, may I be excused?

354
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:03,465
Children, in the morning I shall be going to Vienna.

355
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:06,211
Not again, Father!

356
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,175
How long will you be gone this time?

357
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,286
I'm not sure, Gretl.

358
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:18,048
- To visit Baroness Schraeder again? - Mind your own business!

359
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,959
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

360
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:26,563
- Why can't we ever see the baroness? - Why would she want to see you?

361
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:31,736
You are going to see the baroness. I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

362
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,037
And Uncle Max.

363
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,708
Uncle Max!

364
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,091
Rolfe!

365
00:36:58,164 --> 00:36:59,222
Oh, Rolfe!

366
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:04,703
- No, Liesl. We mustn't! - Why not, silly?

367
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:07,600
- I don't know... - Isn't this why you're waiting?

368
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,706
Yes, of course.

369
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,708
- I've missed you, Liesl. - You have? How much?

370
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:16,780
I even thought of sending a telegram, so I'd be able to deliver it here.

371
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,952
Oh, that's a lovely thought! Why don't you, right now?

372
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:25,385
- But I'm here! - Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.

373
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:29,050
I'll start it for you. "Dear Liesl..."

374
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:33,358
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able to tell you...

375
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,795
...how I feel about you. Stop.

376
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:40,564
Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive.

377
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,207
Sincerely, Rolfe."

378
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,173
- "Sincerely"? - Cordially.

379
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,040
- "Cordially"? - Affectionately?

380
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,442
Will there be any reply?

381
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,881
"Dear Rolfe: Stop.

382
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,984
Don't stop! Your Liesl."

383
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,562
If only we didn't have to wait for someone to send Father a telegram.

384
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:08,232
How do I know when I'll see you again?

385
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,329
Well, let's see...

386
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,308
I could come here by mistake.

387
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:20,939
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider! He's here from Berlin staying with...

388
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:25,147
No one knows he's here. Don't tell your father.

389
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,581
- Why not? - Your father's so Austrian.

390
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:30,085
We're all Austrian.

391
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,693
Some think we ought to be German, and they're very mad at those who don't.

392
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,691
They're getting ready to...

393
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,799
Let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.

394
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:46,004
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero. He was even decorated by the emperor.

395
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:49,471
I don't worry about him. I worry about his daughter.

396
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,477
Me? Why?

397
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,336
- Well, you're so... - What?

398
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,270
You're such a baby!

399
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,616
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

400
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:04,381
You wait, little girl On an empty stage

401
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:07,991
For fate to turn the light on

402
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:11,859
Your life, little girl Is an empty page

403
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:16,193
That men will want to write on

404
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:22,398
To write on

405
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:27,279
You are 16 going on 17

406
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,314
Baby, it's time to think

407
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:35,147
Better beware Be canny and careful

408
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:39,017
Baby, you're on the brink

409
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,193
You are 16 going on 17

410
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:47,059
Fellows will fall in line

411
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,700
Eager young lads And roues and cads

412
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:54,840
Will offer you food and wine

413
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:58,874
Totally unprepared are you

414
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:02,840
To face a world of men

415
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:07,580
Timid and shy and scared are you

416
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:11,379
Of things beyond your ken

417
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:15,459
You need someone older and wiser

418
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,563
Telling you what to do

419
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:23,235
I am 17 going on 18

420
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:29,431
I'll take care of you

421
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:05,308
I am 16 going on 17

422
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,913
I know that I'm naive

423
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:12,413
Fellows I meet May tell me I'm sweet

424
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:16,349
And willingly I believe

425
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:19,986
I am 16 going on 17

426
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:23,959
Innocent as a rose

427
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:27,622
Bachelor dandies Drinkers of brandies

428
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:31,267
What do I know of those?

429
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:34,998
Totally unprepared am I

430
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:38,767
To face a world of men

431
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:42,512
Timid and shy and scared am I

432
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:46,445
Of things beyond my ken

433
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:50,481
I need someone older and wiser

434
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:54,022
Telling me what to do

435
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,057
You are 17 going on 18

436
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:03,964
I'll depend on you

437
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:58,449
Come in.

438
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,112
Frau Schmidt.

439
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:05,185
For your new dresses.

440
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:09,484
- The captain had these sent from town. - Oh, how lovely!

441
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:13,198
These will make the prettiest clothes I've ever had.

442
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:16,958
Do you think he would get me more material if I asked?

443
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:20,832
- How many dresses do you need? - Not for me, for the children.

444
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:23,166
I want to make them some play clothes.

445
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:26,970
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.

446
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
Surely you don't approve of that.

447
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:33,283
Ever since the captain lost his poor wife...

448
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,215
...he runs this house as if on one of his ships.

449
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:38,455
Whistles, orders.

450
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:40,556
No more music, no more laughing.

451
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:44,354
Nothing that reminds him of her. Even the children.

452
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:45,956
But that's so wrong.

453
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:48,323
Oh, well.

454
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:52,197
How do you like your room? There'll be new drapes at the windows.

455
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:53,734
Bu these are fine.

456
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:55,634
New ones have been ordered.

457
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:59,141
- But I really don't need them. - Good night, now.

458
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:03,406
Frau Schmidt, if I asked the captain about the material?

459
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:08,143
- He's leaving in the morning. - Of course. How long will he be gone?

460
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:13,317
It depends. The last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.

461
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:19,056
I shouldn't be saying this to you. I don't know you that well.

462
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:22,233
But if you ask me, the captain's thinking seriously...

463
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:24,733
...of marrying her before summer's over.

464
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:28,168
Wonderful! The children will have a mother again.

465
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,906
Yes.

466
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,906
Well, good night.

467
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,545
Good night.

468
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,853
Dear Father, now I know why You sent me here.

469
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,957
To help these children prepare for a new mother.

470
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:02,492
And I pray this will become a happy family in Thy sight.

471
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,825
God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

472
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:10,197
God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.

473
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,338
And I forgot the other boy. What's his name?

474
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,940
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

475
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:21,137
God bless the Reverend Mother and Sister Margaretta...

476
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,146
...and everybody at the abbey.

477
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:25,876
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

478
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:28,287
Help her know that I'm her friend...

479
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:31,049
...and help her tell me what she's been up to.

480
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:32,952
Are you going to tell on me?

481
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,630
Help me to be understanding so I may guide her footsteps.

482
00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:39,526
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

483
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:42,726
I was out walking and somebody locked the doors early.

484
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,666
I didn't want to wake everybody, so when I saw your window open...

485
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:51,335
You're not going to tell Father, are you?

486
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:58,715
How did you climb up?

487
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,348
It's how we always got in to play tricks on the governess.

488
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:05,549
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

489
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,222
Spiders?

490
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:14,561
Were you out walking all by yourself?

491
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:25,740
If we wash that dress tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.

492
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:28,177
You could put this on.

493
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:32,613
Take your dress and put it to soak in the bathtub.

494
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,380
Come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.

495
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:40,718
I told you today I didn't need a governess.

496
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:43,021
Well, maybe I do.

497
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:16,054
Gretl, are you scared?

498
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,831
You're not frightened of a storm, are you?

499
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,333
You just stay right here with me.

500
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:29,738
- Where are the others? - They're asleep. They're not scared.

501
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:35,979
Oh, no? Look.

502
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,486
All right, up here on the bed.

503
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:42,483
- Really? - Well, just this once. Come on.

504
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,925
- Now we'll wait for the boys. - You won't see them. Boys are brave.

505
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,798
You weren't scared, were you?

506
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:59,534
Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure that you weren't.

507
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:03,667
- That's very thoughtful of you. - It wasn't my idea.

508
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:05,809
It was Kurt's!

509
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,641
Kurt! That's the one I left out! God bless Kurt.

510
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,215
Why does it do that?

511
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:17,288
The lightning talks to the thunder, and the thunder answers.

512
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,016
- But lightning must be nasty. - Not really.

513
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,558
Why does the thunder get so angry?

514
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,957
It makes me want to cry.

515
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:31,032
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy, I just try to think of nice things.

516
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,069
What kind of things?

517
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:35,809
Well, let me see. Nice things...

518
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,135
Daffodils.

519
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:39,811
Green meadows.

520
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:42,478
Skies full of stars.

521
00:49:42,683 --> 00:49:45,880
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens

522
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:49,215
Bright copper kettles And warm woolen mittens

523
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:52,586
Brown paper packages Tied up with strings

524
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,853
These are a few of my favorite things

525
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:02,231
Cream-colored ponies And crisp apple strudels

526
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:05,700
Doorbells and sleigh bells And schnitzel with noodles

527
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,875
Wild geese that fly With the moon on their wings

528
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,944
These are a few of my favorite things

529
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,945
Girls in white dresses With blue satin sashes

530
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:20,415
Snowflakes that stay On my nose and eyelashes

531
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:23,748
Silver white winters That melt into springs

532
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:27,391
These are a few of my favorite things

533
00:50:27,595 --> 00:50:29,290
When the dog bites

534
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:31,191
When the bee stings

535
00:50:31,432 --> 00:50:33,696
When I'm feeling sad

536
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:37,301
I simply remember my favorite things

537
00:50:37,571 --> 00:50:44,409
And then I don't feel so bad

538
00:50:45,146 --> 00:50:46,807
- Does it work? - Of course.

539
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:49,048
- What do you like? - Pussy willow!

540
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:51,980
- Christmas! - Bunny rabbits!

541
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:53,880
Snakes!

542
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:56,282
- Chocolate icing! - No school!

543
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:57,716
Pillow fights!

544
00:50:57,992 --> 00:50:59,983
- Telegrams! - Birthday presents!

545
00:51:00,394 --> 00:51:02,760
- Any presents! - Ladybugs!

546
00:51:04,265 --> 00:51:05,596
A good sneeze!

547
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,629
Gesundheit!

548
00:51:07,935 --> 00:51:09,163
See what fun it is?

549
00:51:09,403 --> 00:51:12,338
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens

550
00:51:12,606 --> 00:51:15,473
Bright copper kettles And warm woolen mittens

551
00:51:15,743 --> 00:51:18,735
Brown paper packages Tied up with strings

552
00:51:18,979 --> 00:51:21,812
These are a few of my favorite things

553
00:51:25,252 --> 00:51:28,085
Cream-colored ponies And crisp apple strudels

554
00:51:28,322 --> 00:51:31,189
Doorbells and sleigh bells And schnitzel with noodles

555
00:51:31,425 --> 00:51:34,360
Wild geese that fly With the moon on their wings

556
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:38,120
These are a few of my favorite things

557
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:40,589
Together.

558
00:51:40,868 --> 00:51:43,632
Girls in white dresses With blue satin sashes

559
00:51:43,871 --> 00:51:46,772
Snowflakes that stay On my nose and eyelashes

560
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:49,999
Silver white winters That melt into springs

561
00:51:50,277 --> 00:51:53,542
These are a few of my favorite things

562
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,975
When the dog bi...

563
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:58,151
Dog bites.

564
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,020
Hello.

565
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:10,391
Fraulein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed?

566
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:13,394
The children were upset by the storm, so l...

567
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:15,791
You did, sir.

568
00:52:16,003 --> 00:52:20,201
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty remembering such simple instructions?

569
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,135
Only during thunderstorms.

570
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:27,136
Liesl?

571
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,576
I don't recall seeing you after dinner.

572
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:31,913
Really? As a matter of fact...

573
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:33,414
Yes?

574
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,381
Well, I was...

575
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,715
What she would like to say...

576
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:40,826
...is that she and I have been getting acquainted tonight.

577
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:45,897
It's too late to go into that. You heard your father. Go back to bed.

578
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:51,936
Fraulein...

579
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,266
...you have managed to remember I'm leaving in the morning?

580
00:52:57,378 --> 00:53:01,906
Is it also possible you remember the first rule in this house is discipline?

581
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:06,075
Then I trust that before I return...

582
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:08,350
...you'll have acquired some?

583
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:11,088
Captain?

584
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,961
Could I talk to you about clothes for the children for when they play?

585
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,926
- Lf I could have some material. - You are many things.

586
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,360
Not the least of which is repetitious.

587
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,729
- But they're children! - Yes.

588
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,734
And I'm their father.

589
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:27,535
Good night.

590
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:57,635
Girls in white dresses With blue satin sashes

591
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:12,676
When the dog bites When the bee stings

592
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,411
When I'm feeling sad

593
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:18,955
I simply remember my favorite things

594
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:21,286
And then I don't feel...

595
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:28,457
...so bad

596
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,155
Children, over here. See!

597
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,164
Come on.

598
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,445
Fraulein Maria?

599
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,618
Can we do this every day?

600
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,117
- Don't you think you'd get tired of it? - I suppose so.

601
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,719
Every other day?

602
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:36,555
I haven't had so much fun since we put glue on Fraulein Josephine's toothbrush.

603
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:40,665
I can't understand how children as nice as you can play such tricks.

604
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:42,765
- It's easy. - But why do it?

605
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,404
How else can we get Father's attention?

606
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,765
Oh, I see.

607
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,304
We'll have to think about that one.

608
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,107
All right, over here.

609
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:56,748
What are we going to do?

610
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:58,952
Think of a song for the baroness.

611
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,154
Father doesn't like us to sing.

612
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,982
Perhaps we can change his mind. Now, what songs do you know?

613
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,420
We don't know any songs.

614
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,323
- Not any? - We don't even know how to sing.

615
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:14,160
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

616
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,163
But how?

617
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:24,433
Let's start at the very beginning

618
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:28,012
A very good place to start

619
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:30,149
When you read you begin with

620
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:31,612
A, B, C

621
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:36,152
When you sing, you begin with Do-Re-Mi

622
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,017
Do-re-mi

623
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,623
Do-re-mi

624
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,694
The first three notes Just happen to be

625
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,727
Do-re-mi

626
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:47,228
Do-re-mi

627
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:51,403
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

628
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:54,506
Let's see if I can make it easier.

629
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:01,574
"Doe," a deer A female deer

630
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:05,376
"Ray," a drop of golden sun

631
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:09,418
"Me," a name I call myself

632
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:13,387
"Far," a long long way to run

633
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:17,426
"Sew," a needle pulling thread

634
00:58:17,731 --> 00:58:21,565
"La," a note to follow sew

635
00:58:21,835 --> 00:58:24,770
"Tea," a drink with jam and bread

636
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:29,335
That will bring us back to doe

637
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:33,404
- Doe - A deer, a female deer

638
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:36,877
- Ray - A drop of golden sun

00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:40,416

00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:43,781

641
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:47,749
Sew, a needle pulling thread

642
00:58:47,961 --> 00:58:51,294
- La - A note to follow sew

643
00:58:51,732 --> 00:58:54,599
- Tea - A drink with jam and bread

644
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:57,132
That will bring us back to

645
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,807
- Doe - A deer, a female deer

646
00:59:01,074 --> 00:59:04,134
Ray, a drop of golden sun

647
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:07,808
Me, a name I call myself

648
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:11,141
Far, a long long way to run

649
00:59:11,418 --> 00:59:14,649
Sew, a needle pulling thread

650
00:59:14,955 --> 00:59:18,322
La, a note to follow sew

651
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:21,220
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

652
00:59:21,428 --> 00:59:25,489
That will bring us back to doe

653
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,993
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do

654
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:33,998
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only the tools we use to build a song.

655
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:37,505
Once you have them in your head you can sing different tunes...

656
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:39,905
...by mixing them up. Like this:

657
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:46,643
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

658
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:47,945
Can you do that?

659
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:53,650
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

660
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:59,526
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

661
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:05,135
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

662
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:07,102
Now, put it all together.

663
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:13,940
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

664
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:20,142
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

665
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,315
- Good. - But it doesn't mean anything.

666
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:26,526
So we put in words. One word for every note.

667
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,055
Like this:

668
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:34,859
When you know the notes to sing

669
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:40,732
You can sing most anything

670
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:41,974
Together!

671
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:48,876
When you know the notes to sing

672
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:55,749
You can sing most anything

673
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:59,523
- Doe - A deer, a female deer

674
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:02,990
- Ray - A drop of golden sun

675
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:06,494
- Me - A name I call myself

676
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,760
- Far - A long long way to run

677
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:13,370
- Sew - A needle pulling thread

678
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,938
- La - A note to follow sew

679
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:20,136
- Tea - A drink with jam and bread

680
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:24,215
That will bring us back to doe

681
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:48,071
When you know the notes to sing

682
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:55,138
You can sing most anything

683
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:58,878
Doe A deer, a female deer

684
01:01:59,152 --> 01:02:02,679
Ray A drop of golden sun

685
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,347
Me A name I call myself

686
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:09,756
Far A long long way to run

687
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,193
Sew A needle pulling thread

688
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,597
La A note to follow sew

689
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,832
Tea A drink with jam and bread

690
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:24,032
That will bring us back to

691
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:31,082
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

692
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:35,845
So-do-la-fa-ti

693
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:37,716
La-so

694
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:47,063
Ti-do

695
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,757
So-do

696
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:05,309
The mountains are magnificent, really magnificent.

697
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:08,214
- I had them put up just for you. - Oh?

698
01:03:08,488 --> 01:03:10,649
Even if it's to a height of 10,000 feet...

699
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:14,451
...Georg always believes in "rising to the occasion."

700
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:16,992
Improve the jokes or I'll disinvite you.

701
01:03:17,597 --> 01:03:20,157
You didn't invite me. I invited myself.

702
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,958
- Naturally. - You needed a chaperone...

703
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:25,966
...and I needed a place where the cuisine is superb...

704
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,833
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

705
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,736
...and the price perfect.

706
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,943
Max, you are outrageous.

707
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:38,173
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.

708
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,946
Listen.

709
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,521
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

710
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,156
They're good.

711
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,825
Very good.

712
01:03:54,634 --> 01:03:57,296
I must explore this area in the next few days.

713
01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:00,962
Somewhere, a hungry singing group is waiting for Max Detweiler...

714
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:05,507
...to pluck it out and make it famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

715
01:04:05,712 --> 01:04:09,011
- They get fame, you get money. - It's unfair, I admit it.

716
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:13,651
But someday that'll be changed. I shall get the fame too.

717
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,855
Good heavens, what's this?

718
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:26,629
It's nothing. Just some local urchins.

719
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:45,750
This really is exciting for me, Georg. Being here with you.

720
01:04:46,586 --> 01:04:49,146
Trees, lakes, you've seen them before.

721
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:52,016
That is not what I mean, and you know it.

722
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:56,217
- You mean me? I'm exciting? - Is that so impossible?

723
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:59,522
No, just highly improbable.

724
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:03,930
- There you go, running yourself down. - Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

725
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:11,404
You're much less of a riddle when I see you here, Georg.

726
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,444
- In my natural habitat? - Yes, exactly.

727
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,875
Are you saying that I'm more at home...

728
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:21,110
...among the birds and the flowers and the wind that moves...

729
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:23,549
...through the trees like a restless sea?

730
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,382
How poetic.

731
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,457
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

732
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:33,726
More at home here than in Vienna in all your glittering salons...

733
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:38,302
...gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne...

734
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:42,302
...stumbling about to waltzes by Strausses I can't even remember?

735
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,736
- Is that what you're saying? - Yes.

736
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:47,276
Now whatever gave you that idea?

737
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,552
Oh, I do like it here, Georg. It's so lovely and peaceful.

738
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:56,822
How can you leave it so often?

739
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,923
Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.

740
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,425
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.

741
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:06,428
Could it be running away from memories?

742
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:13,572
Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.

743
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,732
I hope that's why you've been coming to Vienna so often.

744
01:06:18,411 --> 01:06:22,745
- Were there other distractions? - I'd hardly call you a distraction.

745
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:25,644
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

746
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:29,183
Lovely...

747
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,818
...charming, witty, graceful, the perfect hostess...

748
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:35,859
...and, you're going to hate me for this...

749
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,355
...in a way, my savior.

750
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:40,462
Oh, how unromantic.

751
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,999
I'd be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't say...

752
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:46,500
...that you brought some meaning back into my life.

753
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:51,105
I am amusing, I suppose.

754
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:56,111
I have the finest couturier in Vienna and a glittering circle of friends.

755
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:59,444
- I do give some rather gay parties. - Oh, yes.

756
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,517
But take all that away...

757
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:06,158
...and you have just wealthy, unattached little me...

758
01:07:06,826 --> 01:07:09,226
...searching, just like you.

759
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:16,029
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

760
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:17,826
- How many have I had? - Two.

761
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:20,005
Make it an uneven three.

762
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:26,335
Still eating, Max? Must be unhappy.

763
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:30,505
That mixed quartet I've been trying to steal away from Sol Hurok...

764
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,412
- What happened? ...Sascha Petrie stole them first.

765
01:07:33,653 --> 01:07:34,915
I hate thieves.

766
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:38,487
Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.

767
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:41,057
I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.

768
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:44,888
- On Georg's telephone, of course. - How else could I afford it?

769
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:50,496
I like rich people, the way they live and how I live when I'm with them.

770
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:52,828
I wonder where the children are.

771
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,730
They must have heard I was coming and hid.

772
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:58,500
I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.

773
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:03,239
Max, do step out of character for a moment and try and be charming.

774
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,691
Well?

775
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:15,788
Well what?

776
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:18,930
Have you made up his mind? Do I hear wedding bells?

777
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,190
- Pealing madly. - Marvelous.

778
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:24,198
- Not necessarily for me. - What kind of talk's that?

779
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,962
None-of-your-business talk.

780
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:28,706
I'm terribly fond of him, so don't toy with us.

781
01:08:28,975 --> 01:08:32,570
But I'm a child. I like toys. So tell me everything.

782
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:37,942
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy, intimate, disgusting detail.

783
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:43,549
Well, let's just say I have a feeling I may be here on approval.

784
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:46,816
- I approve of that. How can you miss? - Far too easily.

785
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:50,324
If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.

786
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:53,088
- He's no ordinary man. - No, he's rich.

787
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,597
His wife's death gave him a great heartache.

788
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:58,930
And your husband's death gave you a great fortune.

789
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,106
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

790
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:05,334
You and Georg are like family. That's why I want to see you married.

791
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:09,139
We must keep all that lovely money in the family.

792
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:28,366
- What are you doing there? - Oh, Captain von Trapp.

793
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:30,660
I was just looking for...

794
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:34,370
I didn't see, I mean, I didn't know you were...

795
01:09:34,974 --> 01:09:36,669
Heil Hitler!

796
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:38,867
Who are you?

797
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:41,375
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

798
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:44,378
- I am Herr Detweiler. - Yes, sir.

799
01:09:49,455 --> 01:09:52,049
You've delivered your telegram. Now get out.

800
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,232
- Georg, he's just a boy. - Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

801
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:05,232
Things will happen. Make sure they don't happen to you.

802
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:08,200
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

803
01:10:08,474 --> 01:10:10,669
I have no political convictions.

804
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,845
- Can I help it if other people do? - You can help it.

805
01:10:14,981 --> 01:10:17,142
You must help it.

806
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:29,019
Hello?

807
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:34,428
You're far away. Where are you?

808
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:38,602
In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.

809
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,034
Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I'm in?

810
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:11,459
- Father! Father! - There's your father!

811
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:14,899
Oh, captain, you're home!

812
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:25,944
Come out of that water at once!

813
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:37,256
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

814
01:11:42,568 --> 01:11:45,560
I'm soaked to the skin!

815
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,916
Straight line!

816
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,999
This is Baroness Schraeder.

817
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:20,367
And these...

818
01:12:20,606 --> 01:12:22,198
...are my children.

819
01:12:23,309 --> 01:12:24,799
How do you do?

820
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:30,611
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change your clothes and report back here!

821
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,714
Fraulein, you will stay here, please!

822
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:43,020
I think I'd better go see what Max is up to.

823
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:55,002
Now, fraulein...

824
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:58,968
...I want a truthful answer.

825
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:00,845
Yes, captain.

826
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:05,208
Is it possible, or could I have just imagined it?

827
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,213
Have my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?

828
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:12,851
Yes, captain.

829
01:13:13,926 --> 01:13:15,257
I see.

830
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:20,322
And where, may I ask, did they get these...

831
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,659
- Play clothes. - Is that what they are?

832
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:26,270
I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.

833
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,200
- Drapes? - They have plenty of wear left.

834
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:31,342
We've been everywhere in them.

835
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:36,037
Are you telling me that my children have been roaming about Salzburg...

836
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:39,616
...dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?

837
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:41,513
And having a marvelous time!

838
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,952
- They have uniforms. - Forgive me, straitjackets.

839
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:47,955
They can't be children if they worry about clothes...

840
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,353
They don't complain.

841
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:52,291
They don't dare. They love you too much and fear...

842
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:54,090
Don't discuss my children.

843
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,234
You've got to hear, you're never home...

844
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:57,959
I don't want to hear more!

845
01:13:58,204 --> 01:14:00,695
I know you don't, but you've got to!

846
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:03,635
- Liesl's not a child. - Not one word...

847
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,777
Soon she'll be a woman and you won't even know her.

848
01:14:07,046 --> 01:14:10,106
Friedrich wants to be a man but you're not here to show...

849
01:14:10,383 --> 01:14:11,714
Don't you dare tell me...

850
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:15,216
Brigitta could tell you about him. She notices everything.

851
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:18,582
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain when you ignore him...

852
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,315
...the way you do all of them.

853
01:14:20,593 --> 01:14:22,993
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

854
01:14:23,262 --> 01:14:26,459
The little ones just want love. Please, love them all.

855
01:14:26,732 --> 01:14:28,256
I don't care to hear more.

856
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:32,597
- I am not finished yet, captain! - Oh, yes, you are, captain!

857
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,300
Fraulein.

858
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:40,739
Now, you will pack your things this minute...

859
01:14:40,947 --> 01:14:43,438
...and return to the abbey.

860
01:14:46,085 --> 01:14:47,416
What's that?

861
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,179
It's singing.

862
01:14:50,823 --> 01:14:53,621
Yes, I realize it's singing. But who is singing?

863
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:56,152
The children.

864
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:00,362
The children?

865
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:03,663
I taught them something to sing for the baroness.

866
01:15:09,308 --> 01:15:15,338
My heart wants to sing Every song it hears

867
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:18,175
Every song that it hears

868
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:23,889
My heart wants to beat like the wings Of the birds that rise

869
01:15:24,156 --> 01:15:27,284
From the lake to the trees

870
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:28,959
To the trees

871
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:34,132
My heart wants to sigh Like a chime that flies

872
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:38,963
From a church on a breeze

873
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:43,140
To laugh like a brook When it trips and falls

874
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:46,344
Over stones on its way

875
01:15:46,646 --> 01:15:48,011
On its way

876
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:52,684
To sing through the night

877
01:15:52,885 --> 01:15:58,551
Like a lark who is learning to pray

878
01:15:58,824 --> 01:16:03,318
I go to the hills

879
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:09,764
When my heart is lonely

880
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:13,733
I know I will hear

881
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:19,774
What I've heard before

882
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:24,845
My heart will be blessed

883
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:32,047
With the sound of music

884
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:38,124
And I'll sing...

885
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:46,464
...once more

886
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:21,502
Edelweiss!

887
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:28,641
You never told me how enchanting your children are.

888
01:17:37,256 --> 01:17:38,814
Don't go away.

889
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:45,328
Fraulein.

890
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:49,861
I...

891
01:17:51,337 --> 01:17:54,135
...behaved badly. I apologize.

892
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:59,470
I'm far too outspoken. It's one of my worst faults.

893
01:17:59,879 --> 01:18:01,346
You were right.

894
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:05,716
I don't know my children.

895
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:11,149
There's still time, captain. They want so much to be close to you.

896
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:15,358
And you brought music back into the house.

897
01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:18,128
I'd forgotten.

898
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:22,197
Fraulein.

899
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:25,965
I want you to stay.

900
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:32,705
I ask you to stay.

901
01:18:34,547 --> 01:18:38,039
- Lf I could be of any help. - You have already.

902
01:18:38,651 --> 01:18:39,709
More than you know.

903
01:18:59,438 --> 01:19:00,769
Marta.

904
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:02,735
Curtain!

905
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:08,744
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

906
01:19:10,249 --> 01:19:13,514
Loud was the voice Of the lonely goatherd

907
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,285
Folks in a town That was quite remote heard

908
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:23,090
Lusty and clear From the goatherd's throat heard

909
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:37,474
Marta. Marta!

910
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,870
Gretl, the prince!

911
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:47,074
A prince on the bridge Of a castle moat heard

912
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:50,886
Men on a road With a load to tote heard

913
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:56,657
Men in the midst Of a table d'hote heard

914
01:19:57,997 --> 01:20:01,262
Men drinking beer With the foam afloat heard

915
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:15,472
One little girl In a pale pink coat heard

916
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:20,449
She yodeled back To the lonely goatherd

917
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:25,021
Soon her mama With a gleaming gloat heard

918
01:20:26,525 --> 01:20:29,824
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

919
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:19,673
One little girl In a pale pink coat heard

920
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:24,478
She yodeled back To the lonely goatherd

921
01:21:25,818 --> 01:21:29,254
Soon her mama With a gleaming gloat heard

922
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:33,851
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

923
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:37,188
Happy are they

924
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:43,430
Soon the duet will become a trio

925
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,518
- Bravo! - Bravo!

926
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:11,218
Very good!

927
01:22:13,032 --> 01:22:14,932
Wonderful!

928
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:18,697
- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max? - Yes, can we?

929
01:22:18,904 --> 01:22:20,929
Of course you may, my darlings.

930
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,372
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner to send the bill to your father?

931
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,775
Well done, fraulein.

932
01:22:33,285 --> 01:22:35,253
I really am very much impressed.

933
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:37,445
They're your children, captain.

934
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:46,961
My dear, is there anything you can't do?

935
01:22:47,232 --> 01:22:49,564
Well, I'm not sure I'll make a good nun.

936
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:52,896
If you have any problems, I'd be happy to help you.

937
01:22:56,008 --> 01:22:57,441
Attention, everyone!

938
01:22:57,643 --> 01:23:01,101
I have an announcement to make. Surprise! Surprise!

939
01:23:01,346 --> 01:23:03,644
Today, after a long and desperate search...

940
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:08,910
...I have found a most exciting entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

941
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:10,952
Congratulations, Max.

942
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:14,159
And who will you be exploiting this time?

943
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:19,158
- The Saint Ignatius Choir? - Guess again.

944
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:23,801
Well, let me see now. The Klopmann Choir?

945
01:23:24,036 --> 01:23:26,436
- No, no, no, no. - No, no?

946
01:23:26,638 --> 01:23:27,832
Tell us.

947
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,498
A singing group all in one family. You'll never guess, Georg.

948
01:23:31,777 --> 01:23:34,678
What a charming idea!

949
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,677
Whose family?

950
01:23:37,549 --> 01:23:39,176
Yours.

951
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:41,716
They'll be the talk of the festival.

952
01:23:44,556 --> 01:23:47,548
- Well, now, what's so funny? - You are, Max.

953
01:23:47,826 --> 01:23:50,954
You're expensive, but very funny.

954
01:23:51,697 --> 01:23:54,029
- They'll be a sensation! - No, Max.

955
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:56,494
It's a wonderful idea. Fresh, original.

956
01:23:56,702 --> 01:24:01,503
Max! My children do not sing in public.

957
01:24:02,174 --> 01:24:04,142
You can't blame me for trying.

958
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:07,335
Children, who shall we hear from next?

959
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:11,309
Who?

960
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:18,683
Yes.

961
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,494
The vote is unanimous.

962
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:25,887
You, captain.

963
01:24:26,165 --> 01:24:27,359
Me?

964
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,498
- I don't understand. - Please.

965
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,835
No, no, no, no.

966
01:24:39,111 --> 01:24:41,170
I'm told that you were quite good.

967
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,679
- That was a very, very long time ago. - I remember, Father.

968
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:47,784
- Play us something we know. - Oh, please, Father.

969
01:24:50,722 --> 01:24:51,780
Well...

970
01:25:02,034 --> 01:25:04,195
- Why didn't you tell me? - What?

971
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:06,767
To bring along my harmonica.

972
01:25:09,107 --> 01:25:11,234
Edelweiss

973
01:25:12,811 --> 01:25:15,109
Edelweiss

974
01:25:16,215 --> 01:25:22,415
Every morning you greet me

975
01:25:22,654 --> 01:25:25,714
Small and white

976
01:25:26,558 --> 01:25:29,925
Clean and bright

977
01:25:30,128 --> 01:25:32,961
You look happy...

978
01:25:33,165 --> 01:25:36,999
...to meet me

979
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:39,567
Blossom of snow

980
01:25:39,838 --> 01:25:43,968
May you bloom and grow

981
01:25:44,176 --> 01:25:50,513
Bloom and grow forever

982
01:25:51,483 --> 01:25:55,180
Edelweiss

983
01:25:55,420 --> 01:25:58,014
Edelweiss

984
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:05,960
Bless my homeland forever

985
01:26:10,335 --> 01:26:13,532
- Edelweiss - Edelweiss

986
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:17,331
- Edelweiss - Edelweiss

987
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:23,947
Every morning you greet me

988
01:26:24,182 --> 01:26:27,709
- Small and white - Small and white

989
01:26:27,986 --> 01:26:31,444
- Clean and bright - Clean and bright

990
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:34,148
You look happy...

991
01:26:34,393 --> 01:26:38,022
...to meet me

992
01:26:38,497 --> 01:26:40,624
Blossom of snow

993
01:26:40,832 --> 01:26:44,996
May you bloom and grow

994
01:26:45,237 --> 01:26:52,302
Bloom and grow forever

995
01:26:52,544 --> 01:26:56,173
Edelweiss

996
01:26:56,415 --> 01:26:59,077
Edelweiss

997
01:26:59,685 --> 01:27:09,583
Bless my homeland forever

998
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:22,533
Anytime you say the word, Georg, you can be part of my new act:

999
01:27:22,741 --> 01:27:25,232
The von Trapp Family Singers.

1000
01:27:26,345 --> 01:27:28,836
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1001
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:31,549
Let's really fill this house with music.

1002
01:27:31,783 --> 01:27:34,752
You must give a grand and glorious party for me.

1003
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,716
- A party? - Yes, Father, please!

1004
01:27:37,923 --> 01:27:40,289
It's high time I met all your friends...

1005
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:43,083
...and they met me. Don't you agree?

1006
01:27:43,362 --> 01:27:45,592
- I see what you mean. - Oh, please!

1007
01:27:45,864 --> 01:27:49,027
Children, it's bedtime. Come now, say good night.

1008
01:27:49,968 --> 01:27:51,265
Good night, Father.

1009
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:54,303
- Good night. - Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

1010
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:56,097
Good night, Father.

1011
01:27:59,077 --> 01:28:00,908
Good night, Uncle Max.

1012
01:28:02,814 --> 01:28:05,977
It'll be my first party, Father!

1013
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:41,145
- Captain. - Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

1014
01:28:41,353 --> 01:28:44,481
- Good evening, Herr Zeller. - Baroness.

1015
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:48,259
How do you do? Good evening.

1016
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,316
Did you notice the obvious display of the Austrian flag?

1017
01:29:19,391 --> 01:29:21,188
The women look so beautiful.

1018
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,791
I think they look ugly.

1019
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:24,892
You're just scared of them.

1020
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:27,360
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1021
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:31,527
- I think the men look beautiful. - How would you know?

1022
01:29:49,172 --> 01:29:51,197
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1023
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,035
Nobody.

1024
01:29:53,844 --> 01:29:55,744
Oh, yes, you are.

1025
01:29:58,215 --> 01:29:59,705
May I have this dance?

1026
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:02,407
I'd be delighted, young man.

1027
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:11,854
Why didn't you tell me you could dance?

1028
01:30:12,095 --> 01:30:17,032
We feared you'd make us all dance. The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1029
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:23,133
What are they playing?

1030
01:30:23,373 --> 01:30:26,001
It's the Laendler. An Austrian folk dance.

1031
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:29,372
- Show me. - I haven't danced since I was little.

1032
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:31,547
You remember. Please?

1033
01:30:31,815 --> 01:30:33,749
- Well... - Please.

1034
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:36,214
All right. Come on over here.

1035
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,553
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1036
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:43,425
- Like this? - Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1037
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,322
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1038
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:51,226
One, two, three, step together. Now, step hop, step hop.

1039
01:30:51,468 --> 01:30:54,130
Now turn under. Not quite.

1040
01:30:54,337 --> 01:30:58,296
This way. Hop step, hop. And under.

1041
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:00,670
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1042
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:02,401
Do allow me, will you?

1043
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,565
I don't remember anymore.

1044
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:36,933
- Your face is all red. - Is it?

1045
01:32:38,274 --> 01:32:40,367
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1046
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:45,070
Why, that was beautifully done.

1047
01:32:45,348 --> 01:32:47,248
What a lovely couple you make.

1048
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:49,577
It's time the children said good night.

1049
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:51,184
We'll be in the hall.

1050
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:54,288
- We have something special prepared. - Right!

1051
01:32:54,591 --> 01:32:55,751
Yes, come on!

1052
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:04,931
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1053
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:08,227
You thought you wouldn't find a friend at the party.

1054
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:14,736
- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it? - Oh, I don't know.

1055
01:33:14,944 --> 01:33:16,969
It seemed rather warm to me.

1056
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:22,379
Ladies and gentlemen.

1057
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,215
The children of Captain von Trapp wish to say good night to you.

1058
01:33:41,337 --> 01:33:45,239
There's a sad sort of clanging From the clock in the hall

1059
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:49,173
And the bells in the steeple too

1060
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:53,473
And up in the nursery An absurd little bird

1061
01:33:53,683 --> 01:33:56,117
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

1062
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,013
Coo-coo

1063
01:33:58,288 --> 01:33:59,516
Coo-coo

1064
01:33:59,756 --> 01:34:01,917
Regretfully they tell us

1065
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,490
But firmly they compel us

1066
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,820
To say goodbye

1067
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:12,332
To you

1068
01:34:15,538 --> 01:34:19,440
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1069
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:23,510
I hate to go And leave this pretty sight

1070
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:34,120
So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1071
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:38,318
Adieu, adieu To you and you and you

1072
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:49,468
So long, farewell Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

1073
01:34:49,739 --> 01:34:53,675
I'd like to stay And taste my first champagne

1074
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:56,344
- Yes? - No.

1075
01:35:00,683 --> 01:35:04,346
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1076
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:08,646
I leave and heave a sigh And say goodbye

1077
01:35:08,858 --> 01:35:12,851
Goodbye

1078
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:18,993
I'm glad to go

1079
01:35:19,235 --> 01:35:22,102
I cannot tell a lie

1080
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:25,430
I flit, I float

1081
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:29,166
I fleetly flee, I fly

1082
01:35:39,222 --> 01:35:44,956
The sun has gone to bed

1083
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:48,926
And so must I

1084
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,532
So long

1085
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:54,328
Farewell

1086
01:35:54,537 --> 01:35:59,941
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1087
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:05,546
Goodbye

1088
01:36:06,249 --> 01:36:11,812
Goodbye

1089
01:36:12,055 --> 01:36:18,927
Goodbye

1090
01:36:19,128 --> 01:36:27,627
Goodbye

1091
01:36:32,642 --> 01:36:35,406
Extraordinary! What they'd do at the festival.

1092
01:36:35,645 --> 01:36:38,136
Young lady, I must have a word with you.

1093
01:36:39,148 --> 01:36:43,141
Georg, you won't let this girl get away. She must join the party.

1094
01:36:43,419 --> 01:36:45,819
- No, really l... - Stop. Stop it now.

1095
01:36:46,089 --> 01:36:49,024
- Georg, please. - You can if you want to, fraulein.

1096
01:36:49,259 --> 01:36:51,750
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.

1097
01:36:51,961 --> 01:36:53,861
This is business. Franz...

1098
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:57,293
...set another place next to mine for Fraulein Maria.

1099
01:36:59,469 --> 01:37:02,199
- Whatever you say. - It appears to be all arranged.

1100
01:37:03,006 --> 01:37:04,871
- It does. - I'm not suitably dressed.

1101
01:37:05,942 --> 01:37:07,432
You can change. We'll wait.

1102
01:37:11,047 --> 01:37:13,982
Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.

1103
01:37:14,183 --> 01:37:15,047
I am, thank you.

1104
01:37:15,318 --> 01:37:19,880
Is there a more beautiful expression of what is good in our country...

1105
01:37:20,123 --> 01:37:23,559
...than the innocent voices of our children?

1106
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,325
Oh, come now, baron.

1107
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:29,327
Would you have us believe that Austria holds a monopoly on virtue?

1108
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:34,363
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer Austrian voices raised in song...

1109
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:36,970
...to ugly German threats.

1110
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:41,670
The ostrich buries his head in the sand...

1111
01:37:41,878 --> 01:37:44,813
...and sometimes in the flag.

1112
01:37:45,348 --> 01:37:49,546
Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1113
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:53,516
...would get further with you by setting their words to music.

1114
01:37:53,723 --> 01:37:58,387
If the Nazis take over Austria, you will be the entire trumpet section.

1115
01:37:58,695 --> 01:37:59,719
You flatter me.

1116
01:38:00,763 --> 01:38:04,665
Oh, how clumsy of me. I meant to accuse you.

1117
01:38:12,408 --> 01:38:14,899
It's very kind of you to offer to help me, baroness.

1118
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:16,736
I'm delighted, Maria.

1119
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:20,910
I really don't think I have anything that would be appropriate.

1120
01:38:21,384 --> 01:38:25,514
Now where is that lovely little thing you were wearing the other evening?

1121
01:38:25,755 --> 01:38:29,054
When the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you.

1122
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:34,259
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1123
01:38:35,598 --> 01:38:37,395
Come, my dear, we are women.

1124
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:41,034
Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us.

1125
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:44,706
- Here we are. - The captain notices everybody.

1126
01:38:45,274 --> 01:38:47,708
There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.

1127
01:38:47,944 --> 01:38:50,412
You are quite attractive, you know.

1128
01:38:50,646 --> 01:38:54,275
The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you.

1129
01:38:55,885 --> 01:38:58,251
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1130
01:38:58,721 --> 01:38:59,983
Not at all.

1131
01:39:00,223 --> 01:39:01,815
I've never done a thing to...

1132
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:03,649
You don't have to, my dear.

1133
01:39:04,293 --> 01:39:09,128
Nothing's more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.

1134
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,834
- In love with him? - Of course.

1135
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:17,171
What makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.

1136
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:21,501
But that's not true.

1137
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:25,403
Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.

1138
01:39:25,681 --> 01:39:30,584
And you know, you blushed in his arms when you were dancing just now.

1139
01:39:31,821 --> 01:39:33,516
Don't take it to heart.

1140
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:36,088
He'll get over it soon enough, I think.

1141
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:38,327
Men do, you know.

1142
01:39:39,328 --> 01:39:40,420
Then I should go.

1143
01:39:41,764 --> 01:39:43,197
I mustn't stay here.

1144
01:39:53,676 --> 01:39:57,112
- Is there something I can do to help? - No, nothing.

1145
01:39:58,881 --> 01:40:00,109
Yes.

1146
01:40:01,117 --> 01:40:03,142
Don't say a word to the captain.

1147
01:40:04,787 --> 01:40:08,348
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1148
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:16,689
Goodbye, Maria.

1149
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,298
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1150
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:52,324
Champagne, darling.

1151
01:40:52,735 --> 01:40:56,728
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1152
01:41:02,211 --> 01:41:05,112
- You know something. - Perhaps.

1153
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:09,876
If you're so clever, tell me how to get fraulein to influence Georg.

1154
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:12,747
I want those children in the festival.

1155
01:41:13,222 --> 01:41:15,520
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1156
01:41:15,725 --> 01:41:17,420
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1157
01:41:17,627 --> 01:41:19,219
I thought of that.

1158
01:41:19,462 --> 01:41:21,930
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1159
01:41:22,131 --> 01:41:25,032
...maybe the one you have to be talking to is me.

1160
01:44:51,965 --> 01:44:54,195
- Two. - Three.

1161
01:44:54,467 --> 01:44:55,957
- Four. - Five.

1162
01:44:57,203 --> 01:44:59,228
- Six. - Seven.

1163
01:44:59,505 --> 01:45:01,132
Eight.

1164
01:45:01,374 --> 01:45:03,205
- Four. - Two.

1165
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:06,141
- Seven. - Five.

1166
01:45:06,379 --> 01:45:08,574
- Two. - Six.

1167
01:45:13,219 --> 01:45:15,244
Isn't this fun?

1168
01:45:16,656 --> 01:45:18,988
- Four. - I'm number five.

1169
01:45:19,258 --> 01:45:21,419
- Oh, yes. - Eight.

1170
01:45:21,728 --> 01:45:24,094
- Two. - Four.

1171
01:45:24,497 --> 01:45:25,725
Six.

1172
01:45:28,201 --> 01:45:29,429
Two.

1173
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:33,539
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind if we stop now? We're tired.

1174
01:45:33,773 --> 01:45:35,741
Whatever you want, dear.

1175
01:45:36,009 --> 01:45:38,000
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1176
01:45:48,187 --> 01:45:50,348
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1177
01:45:51,391 --> 01:45:53,018
Have some lemonade.

1178
01:45:54,260 --> 01:45:55,693
There must be an easier way.

1179
01:45:57,096 --> 01:46:00,361
I get a fiendish delight thinking of you as the mother of seven.

1180
01:46:01,300 --> 01:46:03,131
How do you plan to do it?

1181
01:46:03,403 --> 01:46:05,428
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1182
01:46:05,705 --> 01:46:08,799
...of a delightful little thing called boarding school?

1183
01:46:09,942 --> 01:46:12,206
Baroness Machiavelli.

1184
01:46:13,546 --> 01:46:15,537
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1185
01:46:15,815 --> 01:46:17,612
I think he's in the house.

1186
01:46:17,817 --> 01:46:20,377
What's the matter with all you gloomy pussies?

1187
01:46:20,620 --> 01:46:23,418
- Nothing. - I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1188
01:46:23,623 --> 01:46:24,521
What for?

1189
01:46:24,724 --> 01:46:27,215
Let's make believe we're on-stage at the festival.

1190
01:46:27,427 --> 01:46:31,295
- I don't feel like singing. - Not without Fraulein Maria.

1191
01:46:31,564 --> 01:46:33,964
Liesl, get the guitar. Come on, Marta.

1192
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:37,136
Everybody into the group. Get in your places.

1193
01:46:37,403 --> 01:46:40,167
Now be cheerful, right? Give us the key, Liesl.

1194
01:46:42,075 --> 01:46:44,737
Now, impress me.

1195
01:46:48,748 --> 01:46:50,079
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1196
01:46:50,349 --> 01:46:52,817
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1197
01:46:53,853 --> 01:46:56,913
But you sang so beautifully the night of the party.

1198
01:46:57,123 --> 01:46:59,455
Come on, all of you. Try something you know.

1199
01:46:59,692 --> 01:47:01,182
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1200
01:47:01,461 --> 01:47:03,088
All right, Liesl.

1201
01:47:05,031 --> 01:47:10,435
The hills are alive

1202
01:47:10,670 --> 01:47:18,338
With the sound of music

1203
01:47:19,545 --> 01:47:24,608
With songs they have sung

1204
01:47:24,851 --> 01:47:32,690
For a thousand years

1205
01:47:33,392 --> 01:47:38,796
The hills fill my heart

1206
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:46,733
With the sound of music

1207
01:47:47,073 --> 01:47:49,701
They wanted to sing for me, bless their hearts.

1208
01:47:50,009 --> 01:47:51,909
That's lovely, lovely. Don't stop.

1209
01:47:55,915 --> 01:47:59,817
- Something long and cool, Georg? - No, thank you, darling.

1210
01:48:00,219 --> 01:48:02,653
- Father? - Yes, Brigitta?

1211
01:48:03,089 --> 01:48:05,353
Is it true Fraulein Maria isn't coming back?

1212
01:48:05,658 --> 01:48:08,752
Yes, I suppose it's true. What have we got here?

1213
01:48:09,061 --> 01:48:13,760
- Pink lemonade. - Laced with lemonade.

1214
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:16,024
I don't believe it, Father.

1215
01:48:17,403 --> 01:48:19,428
- What? - About Fraulein Maria.

1216
01:48:19,839 --> 01:48:21,067
Oh, Fraulein Maria!

1217
01:48:21,374 --> 01:48:24,832
Didn't I tell you what her note said? I'm sure I did.

1218
01:48:25,578 --> 01:48:28,069
She said she missed her life at the abbey.

1219
01:48:28,347 --> 01:48:30,508
She had to leave us.

1220
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,342
And that's all there is to it.

1221
01:48:34,053 --> 01:48:36,749
I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.

1222
01:48:36,956 --> 01:48:39,686
- She didn't even say goodbye. - She did in her note.

1223
01:48:39,959 --> 01:48:41,756
That isn't the same thing.

1224
01:48:42,061 --> 01:48:43,688
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1225
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:46,421
Just too pink.

1226
01:48:47,867 --> 01:48:50,961
Father, who is our new governess going to be?

1227
01:48:57,610 --> 01:48:58,702
Well...

1228
01:49:01,047 --> 01:49:06,280
...you're not going to have a governess anymore.

1229
01:49:06,619 --> 01:49:09,281
- We're not? - No.

1230
01:49:11,490 --> 01:49:13,617
You're going to have a new mother.

1231
01:49:14,727 --> 01:49:16,752
A new mother?

1232
01:49:17,597 --> 01:49:20,725
We talked about it last night. It's all settled.

1233
01:49:20,933 --> 01:49:23,629
And we're all going to be very happy.

1234
01:49:56,636 --> 01:49:59,104
Well, all right, all right. Run off and play.

1235
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:32,037
Yes, my children?

1236
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:34,638
- My name is Liesl. - Yes, Liesl?

1237
01:50:35,141 --> 01:50:39,077
We, my brothers and sisters, want to see Fraulein Maria.

1238
01:50:40,246 --> 01:50:42,237
Fraulein Maria?

1239
01:50:43,015 --> 01:50:44,983
Oh, Maria.

1240
01:50:46,886 --> 01:50:48,717
Come in, please.

1241
01:50:52,591 --> 01:50:54,149
Wait here.

1242
01:51:05,104 --> 01:51:08,267
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand you inquired about Maria.

1243
01:51:08,541 --> 01:51:11,032
We have to see her. Will you tell her we're here?

1244
01:51:11,277 --> 01:51:13,871
- I'm afraid I can't do that. - But you've got to!

1245
01:51:14,180 --> 01:51:16,239
- She's our governess. - We want her back.

1246
01:51:16,449 --> 01:51:18,349
She didn't even say goodbye.

1247
01:51:18,584 --> 01:51:20,347
All we want to do is talk to her.

1248
01:51:21,120 --> 01:51:24,021
I'm very sorry, but Maria is in seclusion.

1249
01:51:24,256 --> 01:51:27,350
- She hasn't been seeing anyone. - She'll see us.

1250
01:51:27,593 --> 01:51:30,084
I want to show her my finger.

1251
01:51:30,296 --> 01:51:32,196
Some other time, dear.

1252
01:51:32,465 --> 01:51:33,762
I'll tell her you were here.

1253
01:51:34,033 --> 01:51:37,093
- It was sweet of you to call. - We have to speak to her!

1254
01:51:37,737 --> 01:51:40,865
Run along, children. Run along home.

1255
01:51:41,073 --> 01:51:42,700
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1256
01:51:42,975 --> 01:51:45,239
Sister Margaretta, please.

1257
01:51:45,478 --> 01:51:49,209
- Goodbye, children. - Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1258
01:51:51,984 --> 01:51:53,713
What was that about, Sister?

1259
01:51:53,953 --> 01:51:56,148
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.

1260
01:51:56,389 --> 01:51:58,823
They want to see Maria.

1261
01:51:59,091 --> 01:52:01,389
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?

1262
01:52:01,660 --> 01:52:05,653
She doesn't say a word, Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1263
01:52:05,931 --> 01:52:06,920
Poor child.

1264
01:52:07,133 --> 01:52:10,102
It's strange. She seems happy to be back here...

1265
01:52:10,336 --> 01:52:13,635
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1266
01:52:14,907 --> 01:52:17,967
Perhaps I have been wrong in leaving her alone so long.

1267
01:52:18,244 --> 01:52:20,940
Bring her to me, even if she's not yet ready.

1268
01:52:21,147 --> 01:52:22,808
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1269
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,812
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant to the robing room.

1270
01:52:32,825 --> 01:52:35,089
God bless you, my daughter.

1271
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:43,029
Yes, bring her in.

1272
01:52:52,044 --> 01:52:54,308
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1273
01:52:56,348 --> 01:52:57,542
Reverend Mother.

1274
01:52:57,883 --> 01:53:00,511
Why did they send you back to us?

1275
01:53:01,353 --> 01:53:03,321
They didn't send me back. I left.

1276
01:53:05,825 --> 01:53:07,383
Sit down, Maria.

1277
01:53:07,893 --> 01:53:09,690
Tell me what happened.

1278
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:16,231
I was frightened.

1279
01:53:16,502 --> 01:53:20,962
- Frightened? Were they unkind to you. - Oh, no!

1280
01:53:21,207 --> 01:53:24,904
No, I was confused. I felt...

1281
01:53:26,378 --> 01:53:28,471
I've never felt that way before.

1282
01:53:28,714 --> 01:53:32,480
I couldn't stay. I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1283
01:53:32,718 --> 01:53:37,417
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.

1284
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,920
What is it you can't face?

1285
01:53:41,894 --> 01:53:43,327
I can't face him again.

1286
01:53:44,163 --> 01:53:45,687
Him?

1287
01:53:47,266 --> 01:53:49,325
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1288
01:53:58,944 --> 01:54:00,571
Captain von Trapp?

1289
01:54:06,018 --> 01:54:08,714
- Are you in love with him? - I don't know!

1290
01:54:08,954 --> 01:54:10,421
I don't know. L...

1291
01:54:10,956 --> 01:54:14,790
The baroness said I was. She said that he was in love with me.

1292
01:54:15,060 --> 01:54:17,722
But I didn't want to believe it.

1293
01:54:18,797 --> 01:54:21,095
There were times we looked at each other.

1294
01:54:21,300 --> 01:54:22,858
I could hardly breathe.

1295
01:54:23,235 --> 01:54:25,931
- Did you let him see your feelings? - I don't know.

1296
01:54:26,539 --> 01:54:29,201
That's what's torturing me. I was on God's errand.

1297
01:54:29,408 --> 01:54:34,402
To have asked for his love would have been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1298
01:54:36,582 --> 01:54:39,380
I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.

1299
01:54:40,252 --> 01:54:43,312
- Please help me. - Maria.

1300
01:54:44,890 --> 01:54:49,589
The love of a man and a woman is holy. You have a great capacity to love.

1301
01:54:49,828 --> 01:54:52,763
You must find out how God wants you to spend your love.

1302
01:54:53,065 --> 01:54:56,899
But I pledged my life to God. I pledged my life to his service.

1303
01:54:57,102 --> 01:55:01,471
My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.

1304
01:55:03,142 --> 01:55:05,007
No.

1305
01:55:05,244 --> 01:55:07,109
You must find out.

1306
01:55:08,847 --> 01:55:11,338
You must go back.

1307
01:55:11,617 --> 01:55:13,585
You can't ask me to do that.

1308
01:55:13,786 --> 01:55:16,277
- Please let me stay. I beg... - Maria.

1309
01:55:16,488 --> 01:55:20,447
These walls were not built to shut out problems.

1310
01:55:20,659 --> 01:55:22,251
You have to face them.

1311
01:55:22,828 --> 01:55:26,093
You have to live the life you were born to live.

1312
01:55:31,971 --> 01:55:36,271
Climb every mountain

1313
01:55:36,508 --> 01:55:40,274
Search high and low

1314
01:55:40,512 --> 01:55:45,279
Follow every byway

1315
01:55:45,517 --> 01:55:49,783
Every path you know

1316
01:55:50,222 --> 01:55:54,682
Climb every mountain

1317
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,294
Ford every stream

1318
01:55:59,531 --> 01:56:03,900
Follow every rainbow

1319
01:56:04,169 --> 01:56:08,503
Till you find your dream

1320
01:56:08,707 --> 01:56:11,801
A dream that will need

1321
01:56:12,044 --> 01:56:16,879
All the love you can give

1322
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:21,051
Every day of your life

1323
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:27,725
For as long as you live

1324
01:56:28,027 --> 01:56:32,327
Climb every mountain

1325
01:56:32,564 --> 01:56:36,898
Ford every stream

1326
01:56:37,169 --> 01:56:41,731
Follow every rainbow

1327
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:50,348
Till you find your dream

1328
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:54,942
A dream that will need

1329
01:56:55,254 --> 01:57:00,783
All the love you can give

1330
01:57:01,060 --> 01:57:04,552
Every day of your life

1331
01:57:04,797 --> 01:57:11,225
For as long as you live

1332
01:57:11,470 --> 01:57:15,907
Climb every mountain

1333
01:57:16,141 --> 01:57:20,077
Ford every stream

1334
01:57:20,746 --> 01:57:25,376
Follow every rainbow

1335
01:57:25,784 --> 01:57:29,880
Till you find...

1336
01:57:30,122 --> 01:57:40,123
...your dream

1337
01:57:42,668 --> 01:57:46,229
Now, it's not like my children to be secretive.

1338
01:57:46,472 --> 01:57:48,565
We're not being secretive, Father.

1339
01:57:50,242 --> 01:57:53,575
And it's not like my children to be late for dinner.

1340
01:57:53,846 --> 01:57:57,282
- We lost track of the time. - I see.

1341
01:57:58,083 --> 01:58:01,484
Who's going to be the first one to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1342
01:58:01,754 --> 01:58:03,813
Brigitta. Liesl.

1343
01:58:05,190 --> 01:58:07,420
Where do you think we were, Father?

1344
01:58:13,999 --> 01:58:17,958
If you don't believe us, you must have some idea of where you think we were.

1345
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:23,337
- Marta. - Yes, Father.

1346
01:58:23,542 --> 01:58:24,804
You tell me.

1347
01:58:26,145 --> 01:58:29,774
Friedrich told you, Father. We were berry picking.

1348
01:58:30,616 --> 01:58:35,280
- I forgot! You were berry picking. - Yes, we love berry picking.

1349
01:58:35,521 --> 01:58:36,613
All afternoon?

1350
01:58:36,855 --> 01:58:38,584
- We picked thousands. - Thousands?

1351
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:41,692
- They were all over the place. - What kind of berries?

1352
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:45,225
- Blueberries, sir. - Blueberries.

1353
01:58:47,166 --> 01:58:50,533
It's too early for blueberries.

1354
01:58:52,037 --> 01:58:54,130
- They were strawberries. - Strawberries?

1355
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:57,536
It's been so cold lately, they turned blue.

1356
01:59:03,382 --> 01:59:05,543
Very well. Show me the berries.

1357
01:59:06,819 --> 01:59:08,013
- We... - Well...

1358
01:59:08,253 --> 01:59:11,017
- Show me the berries you picked. - We don't have them.

1359
01:59:11,256 --> 01:59:13,520
You don't have them? What happened to them?

1360
01:59:13,759 --> 01:59:16,557
- We... - We ate them.

1361
01:59:16,762 --> 01:59:19,356
- You ate them? - Yes!

1362
01:59:19,565 --> 01:59:21,157
- They were so good. - Delicious.

1363
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:22,594
Very well.

1364
01:59:22,868 --> 01:59:27,999
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves on thousands of berries...

1365
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:32,176
...you can't be hungry anymore, so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1366
01:59:32,411 --> 01:59:35,278
...to skip your dinner.

1367
01:59:44,456 --> 01:59:47,254
It's your fault. We should have told him the truth.

1368
01:59:47,526 --> 01:59:49,494
And made him boiling mad at us?

1369
01:59:49,695 --> 01:59:51,629
It's better than starving to death.

1370
01:59:51,864 --> 01:59:54,731
We didn't do anything wrong. We just wanted to see her.

1371
01:59:56,034 --> 01:59:59,128
My stomach's making noises.

1372
01:59:59,571 --> 02:00:02,404
The least they could have done was to let us say hello.

1373
02:00:03,542 --> 02:00:07,444
- I wonder what grass tastes like. - I feel awful.

1374
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:12,146
When Fraulein Maria wanted to feel better she used to sing that song.

1375
02:00:12,751 --> 02:00:14,218
Let's try it.

1376
02:00:14,453 --> 02:00:17,115
Raindrops on roses

1377
02:00:17,422 --> 02:00:21,449
And whiskers on kittens

1378
02:00:22,294 --> 02:00:24,888
Bright copper kettles

1379
02:00:25,097 --> 02:00:28,157
And warm woolen mittens

1380
02:00:29,501 --> 02:00:35,462
Brown paper packages Tied up with strings

1381
02:00:35,741 --> 02:00:41,737
These are a few of my favorite things

1382
02:00:41,980 --> 02:00:44,005
Why don't I feel better?

1383
02:00:45,183 --> 02:00:47,481
Girls in white dresses

1384
02:00:47,753 --> 02:00:50,847
With blue satin sashes

1385
02:00:51,123 --> 02:00:56,755
Snowflakes that stay On my nose and eyelashes

1386
02:00:57,129 --> 02:01:00,292
- Silver white winters... - Fraulein Maria's back!

1387
02:01:00,499 --> 02:01:01,796
...that melt into springs

1388
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:05,465
These are a few of my favorite things

1389
02:01:05,704 --> 02:01:08,798
When the dog bites When the bee stings

1390
02:01:09,007 --> 02:01:11,134
When I'm feeling sad

1391
02:01:11,643 --> 02:01:14,612
I simply remember my favorite things

1392
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:17,144
And then I don't feel

1393
02:01:17,349 --> 02:01:24,118
So bad

1394
02:01:24,356 --> 02:01:27,382
- Children, I'm so glad to see you. - We missed you.

1395
02:01:27,626 --> 02:01:28,615
I missed you.

1396
02:01:28,894 --> 02:01:31,021
- Kurt, how are you? - Hungry.

1397
02:01:32,564 --> 02:01:35,192
- What happened to your finger? - It got caught.

1398
02:01:35,467 --> 02:01:37,628
- Caught in what? - Friedrich's teeth.

1399
02:01:38,870 --> 02:01:41,031
- Liesl, you all right? - Just fair.

1400
02:01:41,239 --> 02:01:44,231
- Any telegrams been delivered lately? - None at all.

1401
02:01:44,476 --> 02:01:47,912
But I'm learning to accept it. I'll be glad when school begins.

1402
02:01:48,213 --> 02:01:52,912
Liesl, you can't use school to escape your problems. You have to face them.

1403
02:01:53,151 --> 02:01:54,584
I have so much to tell you.

1404
02:01:54,853 --> 02:01:56,844
We have things to tell you too.

1405
02:01:57,189 --> 02:02:00,886
The most important thing is that Father is going to be married.

1406
02:02:01,093 --> 02:02:02,151
Married?

1407
02:02:02,494 --> 02:02:04,519
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1408
02:02:12,437 --> 02:02:13,995
Oh, I see.

1409
02:02:15,841 --> 02:02:19,208
Father, look! Fraulein Maria's back!

1410
02:02:19,444 --> 02:02:21,503
Fraulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1411
02:02:23,715 --> 02:02:24,773
Good evening, captain.

1412
02:02:26,251 --> 02:02:27,548
Good evening.

1413
02:02:30,088 --> 02:02:31,919
Everyone inside for dinner.

1414
02:02:32,224 --> 02:02:33,782
Dinner!

1415
02:02:43,135 --> 02:02:47,868
You left without saying goodbye. Even to the children.

1416
02:02:48,874 --> 02:02:50,398
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1417
02:02:52,444 --> 02:02:53,604
Why did you?

1418
02:02:53,812 --> 02:02:56,645
Please don't ask me. The reason no longer exists.

1419
02:02:57,816 --> 02:03:00,910
Fraulein Maria, you've returned.

1420
02:03:02,154 --> 02:03:03,951
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1421
02:03:07,259 --> 02:03:09,489
I wish you every happiness, baroness.

1422
02:03:09,728 --> 02:03:12,424
You too, captain. The children say you're to marry.

1423
02:03:12,664 --> 02:03:13,790
Thank you, my dear.

1424
02:03:16,334 --> 02:03:19,895
You are back to stay?

1425
02:03:21,973 --> 02:03:25,306
Only until arrangements can be made for another governess.

1426
02:04:20,999 --> 02:04:22,626
There you are.

1427
02:04:37,015 --> 02:04:39,483
I must speak to cook about the schnitzel.

1428
02:04:39,751 --> 02:04:43,050
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.

1429
02:04:43,488 --> 02:04:46,423
And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.

1430
02:04:46,691 --> 02:04:48,682
Or was it the wine?

1431
02:04:48,927 --> 02:04:50,758
Undoubtedly the wine.

1432
02:04:53,331 --> 02:04:55,595
You have no idea the trouble I'm having...

1433
02:04:55,867 --> 02:04:58,597
...trying to decide on a wedding present for you.

1434
02:04:58,904 --> 02:05:01,065
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1435
02:05:01,339 --> 02:05:04,934
But I do want you to have some little trifle for the occasion.

1436
02:05:05,177 --> 02:05:07,509
At first I thought of a fountain pen...

1437
02:05:07,746 --> 02:05:10,010
...but you've already got one.

1438
02:05:10,282 --> 02:05:13,217
Then I thought perhaps a villa in the south of France...

1439
02:05:13,451 --> 02:05:16,113
...but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.

1440
02:05:16,388 --> 02:05:18,788
Oh, Georg, how do you feel about yachts?

1441
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:21,354
A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean...

1442
02:05:21,593 --> 02:05:24,357
...or a tiny one for your bathtub, huh?

1443
02:05:26,531 --> 02:05:28,556
- Elsa. - Where to go on our honeymoon?

1444
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,392
Now, that's a real problem.

1445
02:05:30,602 --> 02:05:33,969
A trip around the world would be lovely. And then I said:

1446
02:05:34,272 --> 02:05:37,105
"Oh, Elsa, there must be someplace better to go."

1447
02:05:37,375 --> 02:05:39,809
- But don't worry, darling, I'Il... - Elsa.

1448
02:05:40,478 --> 02:05:41,740
Yes, Georg.

1449
02:05:42,747 --> 02:05:44,078
It's no use...

1450
02:05:45,283 --> 02:05:46,648
...you and I.

1451
02:05:48,220 --> 02:05:51,451
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1452
02:05:52,791 --> 02:05:54,452
...and utterly unfair to you.

1453
02:05:59,731 --> 02:06:02,461
- When two people talk of marriage... - No, don't.

1454
02:06:03,335 --> 02:06:05,428
Don't say another word, please.

1455
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:13,768
You see, there are other things I've been thinking of.

1456
02:06:14,679 --> 02:06:19,412
Fond as I am of you, I really don't think you're the right man for me.

1457
02:06:21,953 --> 02:06:24,444
You're much too independent.

1458
02:06:24,756 --> 02:06:29,455
And I need someone who needs me desperately...

1459
02:06:29,761 --> 02:06:32,753
...or at least needs my money desperately.

1460
02:06:34,933 --> 02:06:39,836
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together and I do thank you for that.

1461
02:06:42,607 --> 02:06:44,507
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1462
02:06:44,709 --> 02:06:46,768
...I'll go inside, pack my little bags...

1463
02:06:47,012 --> 02:06:49,503
...and return to Vienna where I belong.

1464
02:06:54,886 --> 02:06:56,717
And somewhere out there...

1465
02:06:57,022 --> 02:07:01,391
...is a young lady who, I think...

1466
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:02,888
...will never be a nun.

1467
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:17,372
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1468
02:07:43,101 --> 02:07:44,261
Hello.

1469
02:07:50,075 --> 02:07:53,670
I thought I just might find you here.

1470
02:07:57,849 --> 02:08:00,113
Was there something you wanted?

1471
02:08:00,552 --> 02:08:03,680
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1472
02:08:04,622 --> 02:08:05,953
Please.

1473
02:08:11,096 --> 02:08:12,427
May I?

1474
02:08:24,809 --> 02:08:29,542
You know, I was thinking and I was wondering two things:

1475
02:08:30,715 --> 02:08:34,947
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1476
02:08:35,787 --> 02:08:40,451
And what was it that made you come back?

1477
02:08:42,127 --> 02:08:46,587
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill...

1478
02:08:46,798 --> 02:08:48,925
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1479
02:08:49,567 --> 02:08:51,000
Is that all?

1480
02:08:52,337 --> 02:08:54,498
And I missed the children.

1481
02:08:54,839 --> 02:08:55,999
Yes.

1482
02:08:57,275 --> 02:09:00,176
- Only the children? - No. Yes.

1483
02:09:00,412 --> 02:09:04,246
- Isn't it right that I missed them? - Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1484
02:09:04,449 --> 02:09:07,077
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1485
02:09:08,186 --> 02:09:09,949
Perhaps you might...

1486
02:09:11,689 --> 02:09:12,917
Yes?

1487
02:09:14,692 --> 02:09:19,994
Well, nothing was the same when you were away...

1488
02:09:20,765 --> 02:09:23,996
...and it'll be all wrong again after you leave...

1489
02:09:24,202 --> 02:09:28,866
...and I just thought perhaps you might change your mind.

1490
02:09:32,944 --> 02:09:37,176
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.

1491
02:09:37,449 --> 02:09:38,780
Maria...

1492
02:09:40,885 --> 02:09:44,377
- There isn't going to be any baroness. - There isn't?

1493
02:09:46,791 --> 02:09:48,156
No.

1494
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:50,223
I don't understand.

1495
02:09:52,630 --> 02:09:56,726
Well, we've called off our engagement, you see, and...

1496
02:09:57,001 --> 02:10:00,459
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Yes. You are?

1497
02:10:01,639 --> 02:10:03,732
- You did? - Yes.

1498
02:10:04,876 --> 02:10:09,404
Well, you can't marry someone when you're...

1499
02:10:11,983 --> 02:10:14,042
...in love with someone else...

1500
02:10:17,422 --> 02:10:18,855
...can you?

1501
02:10:53,725 --> 02:10:56,023
The Reverend Mother always says:

1502
02:10:56,261 --> 02:10:59,697
"When the Lord closes a door, somewhere He opens a window."

1503
02:11:07,786 --> 02:11:10,812
What else does the Reverend Mother say?

1504
02:11:11,756 --> 02:11:14,156
That you have to look for your life.

1505
02:11:15,827 --> 02:11:18,387
Is that why you came back?

1506
02:11:22,434 --> 02:11:23,901
And have you found it...

1507
02:11:24,903 --> 02:11:26,063
...Maria?

1508
02:11:27,839 --> 02:11:29,830
I think I have.

1509
02:11:32,577 --> 02:11:33,976
I know I have.

1510
02:11:36,481 --> 02:11:38,142
I love you.

1511
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:43,985
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1512
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:52,763
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

1513
02:11:54,266 --> 02:11:59,499
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

1514
02:12:01,373 --> 02:12:07,312
But somewhere In my wicked, miserable past

1515
02:12:07,812 --> 02:12:13,614
There must have been a moment of truth

1516
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:21,321
For here you are Standing there loving me

1517
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:28,056
Whether or not you should

1518
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:35,503
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1519
02:12:36,374 --> 02:12:44,008
I must have done something good

1520
02:12:45,250 --> 02:12:48,219
Nothing comes from nothing

1521
02:12:49,354 --> 02:12:53,222
Nothing ever could

1522
02:12:54,059 --> 02:13:02,933
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1523
02:13:04,502 --> 02:13:14,002
I must have done something good

1524
02:13:14,879 --> 02:13:19,714
Do you know when I first started loving you?

1525
02:13:20,118 --> 02:13:24,020
That night at dinner, when you sat on that ridiculous pine cone.

1526
02:13:24,255 --> 02:13:25,552
What?

1527
02:13:26,891 --> 02:13:30,349
I knew the first time you blew that silly whistle.

1528
02:13:31,262 --> 02:13:33,253
Oh, my love.

1529
02:13:37,035 --> 02:13:44,942
For here you are Standing there loving me

1530
02:13:46,911 --> 02:13:52,747
Whether or not you should

1531
02:13:54,119 --> 02:14:01,150
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1532
02:14:01,960 --> 02:14:09,662
I must have done something good

1533
02:14:10,835 --> 02:14:14,327
Nothing comes from nothing

1534
02:14:15,073 --> 02:14:18,099
Nothing ever could

1535
02:14:18,343 --> 02:14:24,145
So somewhere in my youth...

1536
02:14:24,416 --> 02:14:26,646
...or childhood

1537
02:14:29,754 --> 02:14:36,284
I must have done something

1538
02:14:38,329 --> 02:14:50,969
Something good

1539
02:14:57,682 --> 02:14:59,206
Maria.

1540
02:15:01,052 --> 02:15:05,648
Is there anyone I should go to, to ask permission to marry you?

1541
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:12,121
- Why don't we ask... - The children?

1542
02:17:00,638 --> 02:17:04,665
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

1543
02:17:05,476 --> 02:17:09,173
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

1544
02:17:10,148 --> 02:17:14,312
How do you find a word That means Maria?

1545
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,741
A flibbertigibbet

1546
02:17:15,987 --> 02:17:19,252
A will-o'-the-wisp A clown

1547
02:17:19,457 --> 02:17:24,019
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

1548
02:17:24,462 --> 02:17:28,489
Many a thing she ought to understand

1549
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:33,500
But how do you make her stay And listen to all you say?

1550
02:17:33,871 --> 02:17:37,807
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

1551
02:17:38,142 --> 02:17:43,136
Oh, how do you solve A problem like Maria?

1552
02:17:43,514 --> 02:17:50,147
How do you hold a moonbeam In your hand?

1553
02:19:56,247 --> 02:19:57,805
Herr Detweiler!

1554
02:20:00,418 --> 02:20:03,080
- Heil Hitler. - Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1555
02:20:03,321 --> 02:20:06,620
Perhaps you've not heard. I am now the Gauleiter.

1556
02:20:06,924 --> 02:20:08,448
Heil Hitler.

1557
02:20:09,360 --> 02:20:10,520
Heil Hitler.

1558
02:20:10,828 --> 02:20:13,092
I've come from Captain von Trapp's house.

1559
02:20:13,531 --> 02:20:17,126
The only one in the area not flying the Third Reich flag...

1560
02:20:17,368 --> 02:20:18,630
...since the Anschluss.

1561
02:20:18,836 --> 02:20:20,997
- But we have dealt with that. - I don't...

1562
02:20:21,272 --> 02:20:24,207
The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.

1563
02:20:24,475 --> 02:20:26,170
The only thing she'd tell me.

1564
02:20:26,677 --> 02:20:29,202
What kind of information are you looking for?

1565
02:20:29,480 --> 02:20:31,345
When will the captain return?

1566
02:20:31,883 --> 02:20:35,819
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip. He's not been in touch with us.

1567
02:20:36,053 --> 02:20:40,888
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated with his children in over a month?

1568
02:20:41,159 --> 02:20:43,059
How many men do you know...

1569
02:20:43,327 --> 02:20:46,626
...who communicate with their children while honeymooning?

1570
02:20:47,532 --> 02:20:51,229
Upon his return, he'll fill his proper position in the new order.

1571
02:20:51,536 --> 02:20:53,902
Naturally. And may I congratulate you...

1572
02:20:54,138 --> 02:20:58,802
...and your people in allowing the festival to go on tonight as planned.

1573
02:20:59,343 --> 02:21:02,801
Why should it not go on? Nothing in Austria has changed.

1574
02:21:03,047 --> 02:21:06,448
Singing and music will show this to the world.

1575
02:21:06,651 --> 02:21:08,346
Austria is the same.

1576
02:21:09,220 --> 02:21:10,585
Heil Hitler.

1577
02:21:12,757 --> 02:21:14,349
Heil Hitler.

1578
02:21:16,027 --> 02:21:17,255
Come, let's go home.

1579
02:21:17,495 --> 02:21:20,987
- Why was he so cross? - Everybody's cross these days.

1580
02:21:21,199 --> 02:21:24,566
Maybe the flag with the black spider makes people nervous.

1581
02:21:24,769 --> 02:21:27,704
- Will Father be in trouble? - He doesn't have to be.

1582
02:21:27,939 --> 02:21:30,669
The thing to do is to get along with everybody.

1583
02:21:30,908 --> 02:21:33,103
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1584
02:21:33,344 --> 02:21:36,245
Are we really going to sing before a lot of people?

1585
02:21:36,447 --> 02:21:38,540
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

1586
02:21:38,749 --> 02:21:43,345
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta, Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1587
02:21:43,554 --> 02:21:47,923
- Why am I always last? - Because you are the most important.

1588
02:21:48,626 --> 02:21:50,253
There we go.

1589
02:21:56,133 --> 02:21:59,591
Are you sure Father will approve of our singing in public?

1590
02:21:59,804 --> 02:22:02,102
He'll be pleased and proud.

1591
02:22:02,573 --> 02:22:05,041
- Liesl, do you think so? - Don't you trust me?

1592
02:22:05,243 --> 02:22:06,267
No.

1593
02:22:06,477 --> 02:22:08,570
You're a very intelligent girl.

1594
02:22:09,113 --> 02:22:11,274
Liesl. Liesl!

1595
02:22:12,216 --> 02:22:13,410
Rolfe!

1596
02:22:14,418 --> 02:22:16,443
I'm so glad to see you. It's been su...

1597
02:22:16,654 --> 02:22:17,746
Good afternoon.

1598
02:22:18,155 --> 02:22:21,090
Give this to your father as soon as he's home.

1599
02:22:21,759 --> 02:22:23,624
- He's on his honeymoon. - I know.

1600
02:22:23,828 --> 02:22:27,161
- You do? - We make it our business to know all.

1601
02:22:27,899 --> 02:22:30,459
- Who's "we"? - See that he gets it.

1602
02:22:30,668 --> 02:22:33,000
- What is it? - It's a telegram from Berlin.

1603
02:22:33,838 --> 02:22:36,329
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1604
02:22:36,807 --> 02:22:39,435
I'm occupied with more important matters.

1605
02:22:39,644 --> 02:22:42,135
And your father had better be too.

1606
02:22:42,413 --> 02:22:43,903
But, Rolfe!

1607
02:23:07,004 --> 02:23:08,665
Father!

1608
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:11,602
- We didn't expect you so soon. - Hello, hello!

1609
02:23:11,842 --> 02:23:14,640
We didn't expect you home until next week!

1610
02:23:14,845 --> 02:23:20,283
- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris? - Hello! How are you?

1611
02:23:21,385 --> 02:23:22,682
Why didn't you call us?

1612
02:23:22,887 --> 02:23:24,821
We couldn't get through.

1613
02:23:25,122 --> 02:23:27,056
I had nothing to do with that.

1614
02:23:27,325 --> 02:23:29,350
We came back as fast as we could.

1615
02:23:29,660 --> 02:23:31,821
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1616
02:23:32,063 --> 02:23:34,497
- We missed you! - We missed kissing you.

1617
02:23:34,699 --> 02:23:37,532
We missed all the noise in the morning.

1618
02:23:37,802 --> 02:23:42,000
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing. - Oh, you came back just in time.

1619
02:23:42,206 --> 02:23:43,969
Look, Fraulein Maria...

1620
02:23:44,175 --> 02:23:45,802
I mean Mother.

1621
02:23:46,210 --> 02:23:48,701
We're going to sing in the festival tonight.

1622
02:23:48,913 --> 02:23:51,040
We've been having a lovely time!

1623
02:23:51,315 --> 02:23:53,374
We've been rehearsing all...

1624
02:23:54,885 --> 02:23:57,217
Surprise! Surprise!

1625
02:23:57,888 --> 02:24:00,379
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1626
02:24:03,427 --> 02:24:04,826
We'll talk about this.

1627
02:24:05,029 --> 02:24:09,329
I would've told you but you were away. I had to make a last-minute decision.

1628
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:12,091
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1629
02:24:12,336 --> 02:24:17,069
They'll be the talk of the festival. Imagine, seven children in one family!

1630
02:24:17,274 --> 02:24:18,901
Max!

1631
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:22,343
Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you...

1632
02:24:22,613 --> 02:24:25,275
...how I feel about my family singing in public!

1633
02:24:25,549 --> 02:24:27,244
The committee was enchanted.

1634
02:24:27,451 --> 02:24:30,614
- What did they say? - I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1635
02:24:30,888 --> 02:24:35,188
- Don't you think just this once...? - Absolutely out of the question.

1636
02:24:35,426 --> 02:24:39,556
- Georg, this is for Austria. - For Austria?

1637
02:24:39,930 --> 02:24:43,195
- There is no Austria! - But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1638
02:24:43,434 --> 02:24:46,892
- Let's at least be grateful for that. - Grateful?

1639
02:24:48,773 --> 02:24:50,434
You know, Max...

1640
02:24:51,308 --> 02:24:54,573
...sometimes I don't believe I know you.

1641
02:24:57,248 --> 02:24:58,613
Father, I forgot.

1642
02:24:59,450 --> 02:25:01,042
This is for you.

1643
02:25:10,828 --> 02:25:14,821
Maria, he has got to at least pretend to work with these people.

1644
02:25:15,099 --> 02:25:16,623
You must convince him.

1645
02:25:16,834 --> 02:25:19,598
Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.

1646
02:25:19,837 --> 02:25:23,136
Then I'll talk to him. If the children don't sing, well...

1647
02:25:23,407 --> 02:25:25,637
...it will be a reflection on Austria.

1648
02:25:26,444 --> 02:25:29,811
Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.

1649
02:25:34,985 --> 02:25:37,647
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1650
02:25:37,922 --> 02:25:40,652
- I like calling you "Mother." - I like hearing it.

1651
02:25:40,858 --> 02:25:44,589
You love Father very much. I can tell you do.

1652
02:25:44,795 --> 02:25:45,591
Very much.

1653
02:25:45,863 --> 02:25:49,162
Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone?

1654
02:25:49,867 --> 02:25:55,169
I mean, when you stop loving someone or he stops loving you?

1655
02:25:57,775 --> 02:25:59,834
Well, you cry a little.

1656
02:26:00,277 --> 02:26:02,370
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1657
02:26:02,680 --> 02:26:04,011
It always does.

1658
02:26:04,281 --> 02:26:07,842
There are so many things I think I should know but I don't.

1659
02:26:08,052 --> 02:26:10,020
- I really don't. - How can you?

1660
02:26:10,287 --> 02:26:12,482
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1661
02:26:12,723 --> 02:26:15,954
- Then you feel it's just beginning? - Yes!

1662
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:20,392
It was that way with me. And for you it will be just as wonderful.

1663
02:26:21,065 --> 02:26:22,965
Do you really think so?

1664
02:26:23,868 --> 02:26:27,804
When you're 16 going on 17

1665
02:26:28,072 --> 02:26:31,667
Waiting for life to start

1666
02:26:32,343 --> 02:26:36,177
Somebody kind Who touches your mind

1667
02:26:36,413 --> 02:26:40,713
Will suddenly touch your heart

1668
02:26:41,152 --> 02:26:42,847
When that happens

1669
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:45,254
After it happens

1670
02:26:45,489 --> 02:26:49,357
Nothing is quite the same

1671
02:26:49,593 --> 02:26:51,151
Somehow I know

1672
02:26:51,428 --> 02:26:53,555
I'll jump up and go

1673
02:26:53,764 --> 02:26:58,064
If ever he calls my name

1674
02:26:58,335 --> 02:27:02,237
Gone are your old ideas of life

1675
02:27:02,506 --> 02:27:06,704
The old ideas grow dim

1676
02:27:06,944 --> 02:27:11,347
Lo and behold You're someone's wife

1677
02:27:12,283 --> 02:27:18,279
And you belong to him

1678
02:27:18,589 --> 02:27:22,889
You may think this kind of adventure

1679
02:27:23,093 --> 02:27:26,961
Never may come to you

1680
02:27:28,065 --> 02:27:33,435
Darling, 16 going on 17

1681
02:27:34,271 --> 02:27:38,401
Wait a year...

1682
02:27:39,210 --> 02:27:44,443
- I'll wait a year ...or two

1683
02:27:44,882 --> 02:27:52,220
Just wait a year...

1684
02:27:53,090 --> 02:28:01,725
...or two

1685
02:28:04,134 --> 02:28:05,726
Liesl.

1686
02:28:22,186 --> 02:28:23,517
What is it?

1687
02:28:24,455 --> 02:28:25,820
Berlin.

1688
02:28:26,290 --> 02:28:28,155
They've offered me a commission.

1689
02:28:28,425 --> 02:28:30,950
I've been requested to accept immediately...

1690
02:28:31,195 --> 02:28:35,188
...and report to their naval base at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1691
02:28:35,799 --> 02:28:39,792
I knew this would happen. I didn't think it would be so soon.

1692
02:28:40,037 --> 02:28:43,529
To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.

1693
02:28:44,775 --> 02:28:48,541
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1694
02:28:54,718 --> 02:28:56,481
Get the children all together.

1695
02:28:56,820 --> 02:29:00,017
Don't say anything to worry them. Just get them ready.

1696
02:29:00,991 --> 02:29:03,357
We've got to get out of Austria...

1697
02:29:05,029 --> 02:29:06,690
...and this house...

1698
02:29:09,033 --> 02:29:10,466
...tonight.

1699
02:29:54,378 --> 02:29:56,778
This strains my back and breaks my heart...

1700
02:29:57,047 --> 02:29:59,880
...when I think of the children missing the festival.

1701
02:30:00,184 --> 02:30:02,846
By your announcement we'll be over the border.

1702
02:30:03,087 --> 02:30:05,521
Do you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making?

1703
02:30:05,723 --> 02:30:07,020
You have no choice.

1704
02:30:07,257 --> 02:30:10,090
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1705
02:30:10,794 --> 02:30:12,921
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1706
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:16,566
Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us.

1707
02:30:20,204 --> 02:30:22,638
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1708
02:30:22,906 --> 02:30:26,433
They'll be able to answer honestly they didn't know anything.

1709
02:30:26,643 --> 02:30:30,875
- Will we be coming back here? - Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1710
02:30:31,115 --> 02:30:36,052
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push the car all the way to Switzerland?

1711
02:31:02,846 --> 02:31:05,246
Something wrong with your car, captain?

1712
02:31:05,582 --> 02:31:07,846
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1713
02:31:11,622 --> 02:31:12,850
Karl.

1714
02:31:14,825 --> 02:31:18,317
Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.

1715
02:31:41,518 --> 02:31:43,315
Excellent, Karl.

1716
02:31:46,690 --> 02:31:49,853
I've not asked you where you and your family are going.

1717
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:52,487
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1718
02:31:52,696 --> 02:31:56,462
Apparently we both suffer from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1719
02:31:57,334 --> 02:31:59,802
You never answered the telegram...

1720
02:32:00,037 --> 02:32:03,336
...from the Admiral of the Navy of the Third Reich.

1721
02:32:03,574 --> 02:32:06,042
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller...

1722
02:32:06,310 --> 02:32:09,802
...that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!

1723
02:32:10,514 --> 02:32:14,041
At least, the Austria I know.

1724
02:32:15,185 --> 02:32:16,812
I have my orders...

1725
02:32:17,054 --> 02:32:19,215
...to take you to Bremerhaven tonight...

1726
02:32:19,490 --> 02:32:21,685
...where you will accept your commission.

1727
02:32:22,826 --> 02:32:28,264
I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.

1728
02:32:28,866 --> 02:32:30,595
You see, we...

1729
02:32:31,168 --> 02:32:34,001
...all of us, the entire family, will be...

1730
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:37,097
...singing in the festival tonight.

1731
02:32:37,407 --> 02:32:39,875
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1732
02:32:40,511 --> 02:32:43,378
We couldn't possibly let them down now.

1733
02:32:43,580 --> 02:32:46,549
- I just hope we're not too late. - Yes.

1734
02:32:46,783 --> 02:32:49,684
You ask me to believe that you, Captain von Trapp...

1735
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:51,387
...are singing in a concert?

1736
02:32:51,788 --> 02:32:55,918
Believe me, it will be a performance beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1737
02:32:56,293 --> 02:33:00,923
Like you, Herr Zeller, I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1738
02:33:01,632 --> 02:33:02,963
Yes.

1739
02:33:03,233 --> 02:33:05,724
Here, program.

1740
02:33:10,741 --> 02:33:13,073
It says only the names of the children.

1741
02:33:13,310 --> 02:33:16,575
It says the von Trapp Family Singers...

1742
02:33:16,813 --> 02:33:19,873
...and I am the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?

1743
02:33:22,152 --> 02:33:25,952
And these travel clothes that you're all wearing?

1744
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:28,314
Our costumes, naturally.

1745
02:33:28,592 --> 02:33:31,993
This night air is not good for the children's voices.

1746
02:33:38,235 --> 02:33:41,762
Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.

1747
02:33:42,973 --> 02:33:44,497
Therefore...

1748
02:33:45,342 --> 02:33:46,969
...you will sing.

1749
02:33:47,911 --> 02:33:49,902
You will all sing.

1750
02:33:50,280 --> 02:33:52,805
But only because that's what I want.

1751
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:57,186
It will demonstrate that nothing in Austria has changed.

1752
02:33:57,921 --> 02:34:00,116
And when you have finished singing...

1753
02:34:00,424 --> 02:34:03,587
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.

1754
02:34:04,861 --> 02:34:07,591
Now, if you will all get into your car...

1755
02:34:07,831 --> 02:34:11,665
...we will escort the von Trapp Family Singers to the festival.

1756
02:34:12,536 --> 02:34:14,697
No escort will be necessary.

1757
02:34:14,938 --> 02:34:17,429
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1758
02:34:18,342 --> 02:34:22,210
After all, we would not want you to get lost in the crowds.

1759
02:34:23,447 --> 02:34:24,937
Would we?

1760
02:34:25,616 --> 02:34:26,776
No.

1761
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:46,163
Sew, a needle pulling thread

1762
02:34:46,370 --> 02:34:49,567
La, a note to follow sew

1763
02:34:49,840 --> 02:34:53,298
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

1764
02:34:53,510 --> 02:34:57,310
A drink with jam and bread

1765
02:35:06,890 --> 02:35:09,051
Tea with jam Jam and bread

1766
02:35:14,931 --> 02:35:18,264
- With jam - A, B, C

1767
02:35:18,502 --> 02:35:21,733
- With jam - Do-re-mi

1768
02:35:21,938 --> 02:35:25,533
Tea with jam and bread

1769
02:35:25,776 --> 02:35:27,107
With jam and bread

1770
02:35:27,377 --> 02:35:28,901
With jam With jam...

1771
02:35:29,112 --> 02:35:37,918
...and bread

1772
02:35:59,910 --> 02:36:03,038
My fellow Austrians...

1773
02:36:04,314 --> 02:36:08,876
...I shall not be seeing you again, perhaps for a very long time.

1774
02:36:10,287 --> 02:36:11,948
I would like to sing for you now...

1775
02:36:13,557 --> 02:36:15,115
...a love song.

1776
02:36:17,094 --> 02:36:19,289
I know you share this love.

1777
02:36:20,597 --> 02:36:24,294
I pray that you will never let it die.

1778
02:36:37,080 --> 02:36:40,607
Edelweiss

1779
02:36:40,817 --> 02:36:44,014
Edelweiss

1780
02:36:44,287 --> 02:36:50,021
Every morning you greet me

1781
02:36:50,427 --> 02:36:53,487
Small and white

1782
02:36:53,764 --> 02:36:56,528
Clean and bright

1783
02:36:57,100 --> 02:37:02,197
You look happy to meet me

1784
02:37:02,973 --> 02:37:04,998
Blossom of snow

1785
02:37:05,275 --> 02:37:08,870
May you bloom and grow

1786
02:37:09,112 --> 02:37:14,778
Bloom and grow forever

1787
02:37:16,286 --> 02:37:18,777
Edelweiss

1788
02:37:19,022 --> 02:37:21,650
Edelweiss

1789
02:37:21,858 --> 02:37:27,854
Bless my homeland forever

1790
02:37:32,369 --> 02:37:35,463
Edelweiss

1791
02:37:35,705 --> 02:37:37,036
Edel...

1792
02:37:44,414 --> 02:37:47,508
Small and white

1793
02:37:47,717 --> 02:37:50,584
Clean and bright

1794
02:37:50,821 --> 02:37:56,157
You look happy to meet me

1795
02:37:56,993 --> 02:37:58,961
Blossom of snow

1796
02:37:59,162 --> 02:38:02,563
May you bloom and grow

1797
02:38:03,233 --> 02:38:09,229
Bloom and grow forever

1798
02:38:09,706 --> 02:38:12,607
Edelweiss

1799
02:38:12,909 --> 02:38:15,673
Edelweiss

1800
02:38:16,279 --> 02:38:24,516
Bless my homeland forever

1801
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:43,797
I think it'll work.

1802
02:38:44,541 --> 02:38:46,304
I shall miss all of you.

1803
02:38:46,810 --> 02:38:49,244
I shall miss the money I could have made with you.

1804
02:38:52,649 --> 02:38:54,207
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1805
02:38:54,951 --> 02:38:57,613
The competition has come to its conclusion...

1806
02:38:57,888 --> 02:39:00,982
...except, we don't know yet what that conclusion will be.

1807
02:39:01,958 --> 02:39:04,483
And while the judges arrive at their decision...

1808
02:39:04,761 --> 02:39:07,787
...I have been given permission to offer you an encore.

1809
02:39:08,064 --> 02:39:11,261
This will be the last opportunity the von Trapps will have...

1810
02:39:11,501 --> 02:39:13,901
...of singing together for a long, long time.

1811
02:39:14,971 --> 02:39:18,964
Even now, officials are waiting in this auditorium...

1812
02:39:19,242 --> 02:39:21,972
...to escort Captain von Trapp to his new command...

1813
02:39:22,178 --> 02:39:25,739
...in the naval forces of the Third Reich.

1814
02:39:30,420 --> 02:39:34,948
And so, ladies and gentlemen, the family von Trapp again...

1815
02:39:35,592 --> 02:39:37,856
...to bid you farewell.

1816
02:39:45,101 --> 02:39:48,696
There's a sad sort of clanging From the clock in the hall

1817
02:39:48,972 --> 02:39:52,305
And the bells in the steeple too

1818
02:39:52,809 --> 02:39:56,677
And up in the nursery An absurd little bird

1819
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:59,314
Is popping out to say "coo-coo"

1820
02:39:59,516 --> 02:40:01,177
Coo-coo

1821
02:40:01,451 --> 02:40:02,440
Coo-coo

1822
02:40:02,719 --> 02:40:04,311
Regretfully they tell us

1823
02:40:04,521 --> 02:40:06,318
But firmly they compel us

1824
02:40:06,556 --> 02:40:09,320
To say goodbye

1825
02:40:09,526 --> 02:40:14,691
To you

1826
02:40:17,667 --> 02:40:21,194
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1827
02:40:21,471 --> 02:40:25,202
We hate to go And miss this pretty sight

1828
02:40:31,381 --> 02:40:34,976
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1829
02:40:35,185 --> 02:40:38,848
Adieu, adieu To you and you and you

1830
02:40:45,161 --> 02:40:48,756
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1831
02:40:48,999 --> 02:40:50,591
We flit, we float

1832
02:40:50,867 --> 02:40:52,528
We fleetly flee, we fly

1833
02:40:58,908 --> 02:41:02,708
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1834
02:41:02,912 --> 02:41:06,279
The sun has gone to bed And so must I

1835
02:41:06,549 --> 02:41:10,349
Goodbye

1836
02:41:10,587 --> 02:41:16,287
Goodbye

1837
02:41:16,526 --> 02:41:21,725
Goodbye

1838
02:41:21,965 --> 02:41:29,133
Goodbye

1839
02:42:00,937 --> 02:42:05,067
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the decision of our distinguished judges.

1840
02:42:05,275 --> 02:42:07,835
We will start with the award for third prize.

1841
02:42:08,478 --> 02:42:10,810
For this honor, the judges have named...

1842
02:42:11,081 --> 02:42:15,677
...the first soloist of the choir of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

1843
02:42:15,952 --> 02:42:18,182
Fraulein Schweiger.

1844
02:42:55,125 --> 02:42:59,061
Second prize to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

1845
02:43:27,023 --> 02:43:31,187
And the first prize, the highest honor in all Austria...

1846
02:43:31,427 --> 02:43:34,521
...the von Trapp Family Singers.

1847
02:43:46,910 --> 02:43:48,571
The family von Trapp.

1848
02:44:03,193 --> 02:44:04,251
They're gone!

1849
02:44:22,946 --> 02:44:24,379
Come with me.

1850
02:44:28,218 --> 02:44:30,209
Quickly, quickly.

1851
02:44:31,120 --> 02:44:33,315
I have a place you can hide.

1852
02:44:34,057 --> 02:44:37,322
Slowly, slowly.

1853
02:44:48,304 --> 02:44:49,999
Open this gate.

1854
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:52,732
Good evening.

1855
02:44:55,245 --> 02:44:56,678
Hurry up, woman.

1856
02:45:16,532 --> 02:45:17,794
Two men in there.

1857
02:45:18,001 --> 02:45:19,866
Six of you cover the yard.

1858
02:45:20,103 --> 02:45:22,333
You two, cover the corridor.

1859
02:45:36,819 --> 02:45:40,380
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize we put the abbey in this danger.

1860
02:45:40,657 --> 02:45:43,182
No, Maria, it was right for you to come here.

1861
02:45:43,393 --> 02:45:45,293
We thought we might borrow your car.

1862
02:45:45,495 --> 02:45:47,395
I'm afraid our car will do you no good now.

1863
02:45:47,997 --> 02:45:49,658
I've been listening to the wires.

1864
02:45:49,866 --> 02:45:52,391
The borders have just been closed.

1865
02:45:58,241 --> 02:46:00,539
All right, if the borders are closed...

1866
02:46:01,844 --> 02:46:05,143
...then we'll drive up into the hills and go over the mountains on foot.

1867
02:46:05,748 --> 02:46:07,739
- The children... - We'll help them.

1868
02:46:08,017 --> 02:46:10,178
We can do it without help, Father.

1869
02:46:11,220 --> 02:46:12,585
Maria.

1870
02:46:13,323 --> 02:46:15,917
You will not be alone. Remember:

1871
02:46:16,159 --> 02:46:19,253
"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help."

1872
02:46:20,229 --> 02:46:21,321
Yes, Mother.

1873
02:46:22,699 --> 02:46:24,860
- I'm scared. - Me too.

1874
02:46:36,946 --> 02:46:38,106
God be with you.

1875
02:46:45,054 --> 02:46:46,612
- Mother. - Yes?

1876
02:46:46,856 --> 02:46:50,053
Would it help if we sang about our favorite things?

1877
02:46:50,293 --> 02:46:53,285
No, darling. This is one time it would not help.

1878
02:46:53,563 --> 02:46:56,760
You must be very quiet. Hold tight to me.

1879
02:49:11,434 --> 02:49:12,662
Let's try the roof.

1880
02:50:08,925 --> 02:50:11,155
Rolfe, please.

1881
02:50:16,265 --> 02:50:17,755
No, wait.

1882
02:50:27,577 --> 02:50:28,908
Maria.

1883
02:50:29,979 --> 02:50:31,412
Children.

1884
02:50:35,451 --> 02:50:38,477
It's you we want, not them.

1885
02:50:38,854 --> 02:50:40,583
Put that down.

1886
02:50:41,657 --> 02:50:44,956
Not another move, or I'll shoot.

1887
02:50:46,662 --> 02:50:48,687
You're only a boy.

1888
02:50:51,701 --> 02:50:55,364
- You don't really belong to them. - Stay where you are.

1889
02:50:57,139 --> 02:50:59,130
Come away with us.

1890
02:51:00,376 --> 02:51:01,536
Before it's too late.

1891
02:51:02,144 --> 02:51:04,476
Not another step. I'll kill you.

1892
02:51:06,782 --> 02:51:10,115
- You give that to me, Rolfe. - Did you hear me?

1893
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:12,678
I'll kill you.

1894
02:51:14,557 --> 02:51:16,024
Rolfe.

1895
02:51:34,410 --> 02:51:35,741
You'll never be one of them.

1896
02:51:38,514 --> 02:51:40,209
Lieutenant!

1897
02:51:40,483 --> 02:51:41,609
They're here!

1898
02:51:41,817 --> 02:51:43,375
They're here, lieutenant!

1899
02:52:24,694 --> 02:52:26,355
Reverend Mother.

1900
02:52:27,630 --> 02:52:29,461
I have sinned.

1901
02:52:30,633 --> 02:52:32,794
I too, Reverend Mother.

1902
02:52:34,437 --> 02:52:36,769
What is this sin, my children?

1903
02:53:57,052 --> 02:53:58,041
