-院长 -柏尼丝修女
-Reverend Mother. -Sister Bernice.

29
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,670
-我找不到她 -玛丽亚
-I simply cannot find her. -Maria?

30
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,090
她又不见了
She's missing again.

31
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,390
也许我们该在她脖子上挂个牛铃
We should've put a cowbell around her neck.

32
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
你找过谷仓了吗？ 她很喜欢动物
Have you tried the barn? You know how much she adores the animals.

33
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,680
我到处都找过了
I have looked everywhere. In all of the usual places.

34
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,150
我建议你
Sister, considering it's Maria...

35
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,020
找不寻常的地方
...I suggest you look in someplace unusual.

36
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,570
院长
Well, Reverend Mother...

37
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,450
我希望这次违规
...I hope this new infraction ends whatever doubts...

38
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,950
会结束你对她在这里会有未来的疑虑
...you may still have about Maria's future here.

39
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,210
我对疑虑仍常保持信心
I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

40
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,340
毕竟黑羊的毛也是会温暖
After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.

41
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,880
我们不是争论绵羊颜色
We are not talking about sheep, black or white, Sister Margaretta.

42
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,550
所有修女的候选人中她最槽
Of all the candidates for the novitiate, Maria is the least--

各位...
Children, children.

44

我们想了解在修道院的人表现如何
We were speculating about the qualifications of our postulants.

45

见习修女和修道院修女的主管
The Mistress of Novices and the Mistress of Postulants...

46
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,940
表达了不同的意见来协助我
...were trying to help me by expressing opposite points of view.

47
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,240
凯萨琳修女 告诉我 你懧为玛丽亚如何？
Tell me, Sister Catherine, what do you think of Maria?

48
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,530
她是个好女孩 有的时候
She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.

49
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,580
-阿葛莎修女？ -玛丽亚讨人喜欢
-Sister Agatha? -It's very easy to like Maria...

50
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,370
除了不讨人喜欢的时候
...except when it's difficult.

51
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,210
-苏菲亚修女 你呢？ -我喜欢她
-And you, Sister Sophia? -Oh, I love her very dearly.

52
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,340
但她爱惹麻烦
But she always seems to be in trouble, doesn't she?

53
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,340

Come here, my child.

坐下吧
Now sit down.

105
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,130
院长 我真抱歉 我只是无法自制
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.

106
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,300
门开着 山峦在呼唤我...
-The hills were beckoning and before-- -Dear.

107
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,720
我不是要你来此道歉的
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

108
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,180
院长 请让我忏悔吧
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

109
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,100
如果会让你好过些的话
If you'll feel better.

110
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,390
是的 今日的天空如此蔚蓝
Yes, you see, the sky was so blue today...

111
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,440
万物如此碧绿芬芳 我必须成为其中一份子
...and everything was so green and fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

112
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,150
安特斯让我愈爬愈高 好像要我跟它穿过云霄
The Untersberg led me higher like it wanted me to go through the clouds.

113
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,490
孩子 万一你在天黑时迷路怎么办？
Suppose darkness had come and you were lost?

114
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,950
院长 我绝对不会迷路的
Mother, I could never be lost up there.

115
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,030
那是我的山 我在那儿长大的
That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.

116
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,540
就是那座山 使我来找你的
It was the mountain that led me to you.

117
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,290
小时我常爬山
When I was a child, I would come down and climb a tree...

118
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,330
眺望你的花园
...and look in your garden.

119
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,500
看着修女们工作 听着她们晚祷的歌咏
I'd see the sisters at work and hear them sing.

120
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,470
院长 我今天违犯规定
Which brings me to another transgression, Reverend Mother.

121
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,840
未得准许唱歌
I was singing out there today.

122
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,520
在修道院只禁止见习修女唱歌
Only in the abbey do we have rules about postulants singing.

123
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,730
不论在何处 我似乎都无法停止唱歌
I can't stop wherever I am.

124
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,310
更糟的是 我似乎也无法停止说话
Worse, I can't seem to stop saying things.

125
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,810
所有我说的和我想的
Everything I think and feel.

126
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,520
有人会懧为这是诚实
Some call that "honesty."

127
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,110
但这是很糟糕的 院长
Oh, but it's terrible, Reverend Mother!

128
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,240
你知道贝诗修女总在争论之后 要我吻地板
You know how Sister Berthe makes me kiss the floor after a disagreement?

129
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,120
所以现在我看到她来就吻地板 以节省时间
Lately, I kiss the floor when I see her coming to save time.

130
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,960
玛丽亚
Maria...

131
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,960
当你看到修道院的一切时 想要成为一员
...when you saw us over the wall and longed to be with us...

132
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,920
那并不表示你已经准备好 要过此种的生活方式
...that didn't mean you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?

133
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,680
不 院长 但我... 我祷告 我努力尝试
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

134
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,600
我也在学习 我真的要做好
And I am learning. I really am.

135
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,520
你在这里学到了 最重要的事是什么 孩子？
What is the most important lesson you have learned here?

136
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,980
找出上帝的旨意 全心全意地侍奉主
To find out what is the will of God and do it wholeheartedly.

137
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:47,940
玛丽亚
Maria...

138
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,240
似乎是上帝的旨意 你要离开我们
...it seems to be God's will that you leave us.

139
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,990
-离开？ -只是短暂的时间而已
-Leave? -Only for a while.

140
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,820
不 院长 别这样做 别送我走
No, Mother! Please don't send me away!

141
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,330
这里是我的家 我的家人 是我的生命
This is where I belong. It's my home, my family. It's my life.

142
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
-你真预备献身上帝？ -我是的
-Are you truly ready for it? -Yes, I am.

143
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,130
或许如果你到外面去看看 就明白我们对你的期望
If you go out into the world for a time, knowing what we expect of you...

144
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,130
你就有机会找出 你对你自己的期望
...you will find out if you can expect it of yourself.

145
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,640
-我知道你期望什么 我可以做到的 -玛丽亚
I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it! I promise I can!

146
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,430
是的 院长
Yes, Mother.

147
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,190
如果是上帝的旨意
If it is God's will.

148
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,530
萨尔兹堡有个家庭 需要家庭教师一直到九月
There is a family near Salzburg that needs a governess until September.

149
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,990
-到九月？ -照料蒳个孩子
-September? -For seven children.

150
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,660
蒳个孩子？
Seven children?!

151
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,160
你喜欢孩子吗？
Do you like children?

152
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,740
是的 但蒳个...
Well, yes, but seven!

153
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,080
我会告诉范崔普舰长 你明天去
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.

154
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,960
舰长？
Captain?

155
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,550
他是皇家海军的退役军官 人很好又很勇敢
A retired officer of the lmperial Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

156
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,510
他太太数年前去世 留下那些孩子给他
His wife died, and he is alone with the children.

157
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,010
我明白他要留住那些家庭教师 会有些困难
I understand he has had a difficult time keeping a governess there.

158
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,100
为何会有困难 院长？
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

159
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,400
上帝届时会让你明白的
The Lord will show you in His own good time.

160
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,730
当主关闭门时
When the Lord closes a door...

161
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,440
祂会打开窗子的
...somewhere He opens a window.

你好 我来了
Hello. Here I am.

213
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,310
我从修道院来的 我是新的家教 舰长
I'm from the convent. I'm the new governess, captain.

214
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,240
而我是老管家 小姐
And I'm the old butler, Fraülein.

215
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,990
哦！你好
Well, how do you do?

216
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,590
请你在此稍候
You'll wait here, please.

217
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,050
以后请记住 这里有些房间是不能乱闯的
In future, remember certain rooms in this house are not to be disturbed.

218
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,680
是的 舰长 先生
Yes, captain, sir.

219
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:08,820
-你为何如此看着我 -你看起来一点都不像海上的舰长
-Why do you stare at me that way? -You don't look like a sea captain.

220
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:13,110
我也懧为你一点都不像个家庭教师
I'm afraid you don't look very much like a governess.

221
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,910
-请转身 -什么？
-Turn around. -What?

222
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,450
转身
Turn.

223
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,830
拿下帽子
Hat off.

224
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,670
你和孩子见面前最好先换衣服
Put on another dress before meeting the children.

225
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,550
但我没有衣服换了
But I don't have another.

226
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,680
我进入修道院时 将所有衣服送给穷人了
When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes go to the poor.

227
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,140
这一件呢？
What about this one?

228
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,720
穷人不要这一件
The poor didn't want it.

229
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,060
我本会为自己做新衣服的 但时间不够 我会自己做衣服
There wasn't time to make a new dress. I can make clothes.

230
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,560
我会给你一些布料的
I'll see that you get some material.

231
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,860
今天 如果可能的话
Today, if possible.

232
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,610
-现在...小姐 -玛丽亚
-Now, Fraülein... . -Maria.

233
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,530
我不知道院长告诉了你多少
I don't know how much the abbess told you.

234
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,410
在许多家教中你是第12位了
You are the twelfth governess...

235
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,080
自从他们的妈妈去世后 来此照料他们
...to look after my children since their mother died.

236
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,500
我相信你会比上一个更好
I trust you will be an improvement on the last one.

237
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,580
她只停留两小时
She stayed only two hours.

238
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,880
孩子们有何不对吗？
What's wrong with the children, sir?

239
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,720
孩子们都很正常 是家庭教师的错
Nothing is wrong with the children, only the governesses.

240
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,930
-记住 无法维持纪律 是管不好家的 -是的
They could not maintain discipline, without which the house cannot be run.

241
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,680
每早你得督促孩子学习
Drill them in their studies.

242
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,440
我不准他们在假期惶惶过日
I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays.

243
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,360
下午他们要在庭院操练
Each afternoon, they march, breathing deeply.

244
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,230
至就寝时间绝无例外
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

245
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,440
请问他们何时玩耍
When do they play?

246
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:33,700
你要看着他们 确定他们循规蹈矩
You will see to it that they conduct themselves with the utmost decorum.

247
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,910
-我要你负责这一切 -是的 先生
-I am placing you in command. -Yes, sir.

248
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,700
现在...
Now...

249
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,240
这位是你们的新家教 玛丽亚小姐
...this is your new governess, Fraülein Maria.

250
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,910
当我吹你们的讯号时 向前一步报出名字
Give your name at your signal.

251
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,380
你要仔细注意那讯号 以便日后召唤他们
Fraülein, listen carefully. Learn their signals so you can call them.

252
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,090
莉莎
Liesl.

253
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,090
费瑞克
Friedrich.

254
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,880
露易莎
Louisa.

255
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,430
寇特
Kurt.

256
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,680
碧姬塔
Brigitta.

257
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:21,220
玛塔
Marta.

258
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,940
葛特儿
Gretl.

259
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,990
现在看看你的耳力如何？
Now, let's see how well you listened.

260
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,610
我想我不用口哨的 舰长
I won't need to whistle for them, Reverend Captain.

261
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:43,330
我会叫他们的名字 尤其是有如此美的名字
I mean, I'll use their names. Such lovely names.

262
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,700
小姐 这是座大房子 地方很宽广
Fraülein, this is a large house. the grounds are extensive.

263

而我不容许任何人在此喊叫
And I will not have anyone shouting.

264
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,670
请你拿这个 学习使用它
You will take this, please. Learn to use it.

265

孩子也会帮你的

不 很抱歉 先生

00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,640
我绝不会听口哨回报的
I could never answer to a whistle.

269
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,520
口哨是为了召唤狗猫和其他动物 但绝不是孩子
Whistles are for animals, not for children.

270
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,810
而且绝对不会是我
And definitely not for me.

271
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,730
这是种很大的侮辱
It would be too humiliating.

272
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:18,740
小姐 你在修道院 也如此麻烦吗？
Fraülein, were you this much trouble at the abbey?

273
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,160
更麻烦 先生
Oh, much more, sir.

274
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,830
先生 抱歉 我不知道你的讯号
I don't know your signal.

275
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,920
你可以叫我“舰长”
You may call me "captain."

276
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:51,310
稍息
At ease.

277
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,690

约瑟芬小姐 前四任教师

285
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,810
你没告诉我你多大 露易莎
You didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.

-碧姬塔 你不该这样说的 -为何？
-Brigitta, you shouldn't say that. -Why not?

290
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,240
-你不懧为很丑 -当然
-Don't you think it's ugly? -Of course.

291
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,200
但赫德小姐才是最丑的
But Fraülein Helga's was ugliest.

292
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,080
我是寇特 11岁 我很任性
I'm Kurt. I'm 11 . I'm incorrigible.

293
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,460
-恭禧你！ -什么是任性？
-Congratulations. -What's "incorrigible"?

294
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,590
那表示你希望像男孩般被对待
I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.

295

一点也不懂 我需要许多建议
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

304
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,870

The best way to start is to tell father to mind his own business.

325
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,530
感谢上帝赐给我们一切
For what we receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.

326
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,990

Then I suggest you keep it, and let us eat.

332
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,480
我了解陌生人在新家庭里
Knowing how nervous I must have been...

333
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,150
会是有多么紧张

是不是每餐饭
...is it to be at every meal or merely at dinnertime...

341
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,950
你都想要让我们

342
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,820
消化不良

343
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,200
不 舰长 他们只是很高兴

357
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,150
这次你要去多久 爸爸？
How long will you be gone this time?

358
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,240
我不确定 葛特儿
I'm not sure, Gretl.

359

-是不是去看史蕾特男爵夫人？ -少管闲事
-To visit Baroness Schraeder again? -Mind your own business!

事实上 是的 露易莎
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

-为何我们总见不到男爵夫人呢？ -为何她要见你
-Why can't we ever see the baroness? -Why would she want to see you?

好想 我甚至想给你送电报 让我好来此地
I even thought of sending a telegram, so I'd be able to deliver it here.

372
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,930
那是很美好的想法 你为何不做呢？就现在吧！
Oh, that's a lovely thought! Why don't you, right now?

373

Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able to tell you…

376
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,780
我对你的感觉 句号

Will there be any reply?

382
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,880
“亲爱的劳夫” 句号
Dear Rolf: Stop.

383
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,010
“还是不要句号好了 你的莉莎”

No one knows he's here. Don't tell your father.

390
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,580
-为何不？ -因为你爸爸自视为奥国人
-Why not? -Your father's so Austrian.

391
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,080
我们都是奥国人
We're all Austrian.

392
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,710
而那些懧为该是德国人的 他们不希望这样
Some think we ought to be German, and they're very mad at those who don't.

393
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,720
他们已准备好...
They're getting ready to--

394
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,800
我希望你爸爸不会惹上麻烦
Let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.

395
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,020
别担心我爸爸 他是海军大英雄 他甚至由国王亲自颁奖
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero. He was even decorated by the emperor.

396
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,480
我知道 我不担心他 但我却担心他的女儿
I don't worry about him. I worry about his daughter.

397
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,480
-我？为什么？
Me? Why?

398
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,360
-你是那样… - 什么？
-Well, you're so-- -What?

399
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,280
你是如此地年轻
You're such a baby!

400
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,610
-我16岁了 一点都不年轻了
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

请进
Come in.

439
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,130
蒙思蜜德小姐
Frau Schmidt.

440
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,210
这是给你做新衣服的
For your new dresses.

441
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,510
-舰长从城里买来的 -多么美的布料
-The captain had these sent from town. -Oh, how lovely!

442
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,220
我可以缝制出最漂亮的衣裳
These will make the prettiest clothes I've ever had.

443
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,970
如果我再要求多点布料的话 他会肯吗？
Do you think he would get me more material if I asked?

444
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,850
-家庭教师需要多少衣服？ -不是为我 是为了孩子
-how many dresses do you need? -Not for me, for the children.

445
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,190
我要为他们做点游戏服
I want to make them some play clothes.

446
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,980
范崔普的孩子不玩游戏 他们只做操练
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.

447
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,900
所以你不赞成了
Surely you don't approve of that.

448
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,280
自从舰长失去他太太后
Ever since the captain lost his poor wife...

449
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:36,240
他管理家事就好像管军舰般
...he runs this house as if on one of his ships.

450
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,450
哨音、命令
Whistles, orders.

451
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,580
再也没有音乐没有欢笑了
No more music, no more laughing.

452
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:44,340
不愿接触任何使他想起她的事物 孩子们也一样
Nothing that reminds him of her. Even the children.

453
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,960
那太不对了
But that's so wrong.

454
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,300
就是这样啊
Oh, well.

455
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,220
你喜欢你的房间吗？ 你会有新的窗帘
How do you like your room? There'll be new drapes at the windows.

456
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:53,720
它们还好好地
Bu these are fine.

457
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:55,600
反正新的已经订了
New ones have been ordered.

458
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,140
-我真的不需要它们 -晚安
-But I really don't need them. -Good night, now.

459
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,440
思蜜德小姐 你想 如果明天我要求他布料的事...
Frau Schmidt, if I asked the captain about the material...?

460
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,110
-他明早就离开去维也纳 -是 他要去多久呢？
-He's leaving in the morning. -Of course. How long will he be gone?

461
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:13,320
那得看情况 上次 他在男爵夫人那儿停留了一个月
It depends. the last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.

462
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,080
我本不该说这些的 我们还不很熟识
I shouldn't be saying this to you. I don't know you that well.

463
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,250
但如果你问我的话 舰长则很懧真地
But if you ask me, the captain's thinking seriously...

464
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,710
想僗这女人
...of marrying her before summer's over.

465
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,170
那太好了！ 孩子们又会有新妈妈了
Wonderful! the children will have a mother again.

466
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,920
是啊...
Yes.

467
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,930
晚安
Well, good night.

468
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,550
晚安
Good night.

469
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,820
亲爱的天父 我现在知道为何你要我来此了
Dear father, now I know why You sent me here.

470
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,910
是帮助孩子们 接受他们的新妈妈
To help these children prepare for a new mother.

471
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,450
而我也祈祷 它将会是个快乐的家庭
And I pray this will become a happy family in thy sight.

472
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,790
主保佑舰长 莉莎 费瑞克
God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

473
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,170
还有露易莎 碧姬塔 玛塔和小葛特儿
God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.

474
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,300
我忘了个男孩 他叫什么名字
And I forgot the other boy. What's his name?

475
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,850
总之 主保佑他
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

476
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:21,140
永主赐福院长 玛格丽特修女
God bless the Reverend Mother and Sister Margaretta...

477
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,100
和在修道院的每位修女
...and everybody at the abbey.

478
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:25,850
还有主啊 有关莉莎
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

479
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,190
让她知道我是她的朋友
Help her know that I'm her friend...

480
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,030
让她告诉我 她在干什么
...and help her tell me what she's been up to.

481
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,900
你会去告密吗？
Are you going to tell on me?

482
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:36,570
协助我能了解 让我能指引她
Help me to be understanding so I may guide her footsteps.

483
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,490
以天父 天子 圣灵之名 阿门
In the name of the father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

484
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,700
我出去散步 而大门提前关
I was out walking and somebody locked the doors early.

485
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,620
我不想吵醒大家 所以当我看见你的窗户是开着时...
I didn't want to wake everybody, so when I saw your window open... .

486
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,300
你不会向爸爸告密吧
You're not going to tell father, are you?

487
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,680
你是如何攀上来的？
How did you climb up?

488
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,310
我们常进来此屋来戏弄家教
It's how we always got in to play tricks on the governess.

489
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,520
露易莎能手拿一罐的蜘蛛 单手爬上来呢！
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

490
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,150
蜘蛛？
Spiders?

491
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,530
莉莎 你是独自出去散步吗？
Were you out walking all by yourself?

492
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,660
我们今晚将衣服洗好的话 明天就没有人会知道
If we wash that dress tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.

493
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,170
你可以穿上这个
You could put this on.

494
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,590
进去里面脱下衣服 泡在浴缸里
Take your dress and put it to soak in the bathtub.

495
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,300
回来坐在床上 我们好好谈
Come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.

496
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:40,680
我今天告诉你 我不需要家教
I told you today I didn't need a governess.

497
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,970
或许我还真的需要
Well, maybe I do.

498
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,960
葛特儿 你害怕吗？
Gretl, are you scared?

499
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,800
你不是怕这暴风雨吧
You're not frightened of a storm, are you?

500
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,260
你就留在此与我一起
You just stay right here with me.

501
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:29,690
-其他的人呢 -他们睡着了 他们不怕
-Where are the others? -They're asleep. They're not scared.

502
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,940
是吗？看
Oh, no? Look.

503
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,450
好吧 大家都上床来
All right, up here on the bed.

504
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,450
真的吗？ 只此一次
-Really? -Well, just this once. Come on.

505
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:47,870
-现在就等男孩们 -你绝看不到他们的 男孩们很勇敢
-Now we'll wait for the boys. -You won't see them. Boys are brave.

506
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,750
你们男孩不是也在害怕吧
You weren't scared, were you?

507
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,510
当然不怕 我们只想确定你们不害怕
Oh, no. we just wanted to be sure that you weren't.

508
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:03,600
-你真周到 费瑞克 -不是我出的主意
-That's very thoughtful of you. -It wasn't my idea.

509
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:05,720
是寇特
It was Kurt's!

510
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:08,600
寇特 是我忘掉的一位 主保佑寇特
Kurt! That's the one I left out! God bless Kurt.

511
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,150
为何会这样？
Why does it do that?

512
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,230
因为雷公和闪电在说话 雷公就回话
The lightning talks to the thunder, and the thunder answers.

513
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:19,990
-雷公一定很调皮 -并不全然
-But lightning must be nasty. -Not really.

514
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,490
为何雷公如此生气？
Why does the thunder get so angry?

515
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:24,950
使我想哭
It makes me want to cry.

516
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,960
我若遇上不如意的事 感觉不快乐时 我想一些美好的事物
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy, I just try to think of nice things.

517
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,000
会是哪一类？
What kind of things?

518
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,750
让我想想 美好的事物
Well, let me see. Nice things... .

519
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,050
水仙花
Daffodils.

520
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,760
绿草地
Green meadows.

你好
Hello.

566
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,370
小姐 我是否告诉过你 在这屋里要严守就寝时间
Fraülein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed?

567
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,370
孩子们被雷电所惊吓 所以我想...
The children were upset by the storm, so l--

568
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,990
你是说过 先生
You did, sir.

569
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:20,170
你是否有困难 记住如此简单的指示
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty remembering such simple instructions?

570
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,090
只有在暴风雨时 先生
Only during thunderstorms.

571
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,810
莉莎
Liesl?

572
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,240
-是 父亲 -晚饭后我没看见你
-Yes, father. -I don't recall seeing you after dinner.

573
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,370
是吗？事实上...
Really? As a matter of fact--

574
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,210
怎样？
Yes?

575
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,310
我是...
Well, I was--

576
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,690
她想说的是
What she would like to say...

577
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:40,730
我们今晚相处的较熟了
...is that she and I have been getting acquainted tonight.

578
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,820
现在已不早了 孩子们 你们听见爸爸的话了 快回床上去
It's too late to go into that. You heard your father. Go back to bed.

579
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:51,870
小姐
Fraülein...

580
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,250
你记得我明早要出门吧
...you have managed to remember I'm leaving in the morning?

581
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:01,880
你是否也能记住 这房子的首要规定就是纪律
Is it also possible you remember the first rule in this house is discipline?

582
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:06,050
相信在我回来之前
Then I trust that before I return...

583
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:08,300
你会很有成效
...you'll have acquired some?

舰长
Captain?

585

我想在你离开前 我是否能跟你谈... 有关孩子的衣服
Could I talk to you about clothes for the children for when they play?

586
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,890
-如果我能有些布料的话... -你显然是非常全能的
-If I could have some material. -You are many things.

587
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,270
但唠叨不是我所想要的
Not the least of which is repetitious.

588
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,690
-但他们只是孩子呀 -是的
-But they're children! -Yes.

589
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,650
而我是他们的爸爸
And I'm their father.

Fraülein Maria?

我们能每天都如此吗？
Can we do this every day?

604
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,640
我真不懂像你们如此好的小孩 怎会恶作剧呢？
I can't understand how children as nice as you can play such tricks.

605
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:42,720
-这很简单啊 -为何要如此？
-It's easy. -But why do it?

606
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:45,350
否则我们要如何吸引 爸爸的注意力呢？
How else can we get father's attention?

00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:47,730
我明白了
Oh, I see.

608
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,270
我们得多想想办法
We'll have to think about that one.

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,070
来吧 大家 过来
All right, over here.

610
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,700
我们要做什么？
What are we going to do?

00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:58,910
我们来想首歌 好欢迎男爵夫人的到来
Think of a song for the baroness.

612
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,120
爸爸不喜欢我们唱歌
Father doesn't like us to sing.

613
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,950
或许我们可以改变他的想法 你们会唱什么歌
Perhaps we can change his mind. Now, what songs do you know?

614
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,370
我们什么歌都不会唱
We don't know any songs.

615
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,290

-Not any? -We don't even know how to sing.

616
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,580
那就不能浪费时间了 你们必须学习

Once you have them in your head you can sing different tunes...

656
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,820
把它们凑起来 像这个

699
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:14,450

Improve the jokes or I'll disinvite you.

701
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:20,210
你并未邀请我 我是不请自来的
You didn't invite me. I invited myself.

702
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,000
-很自然 -你需要监护人
-Naturally. -You needed a chaperone...

703
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,960
我需要有佳肴
...and I needed a place where the cuisine is superb...

704
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,880
美酒的地方
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

705
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,760
而价格又公道
...and the price perfect.

706
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,970
麦斯 你真的太过份了
Max, you are outrageous.

707
01:03:34,220 --> 01:03:38,230
一点也不 我是很迷人的食客
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.

708
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:41,980
听
Listen.

709
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,570
那是可普曼修道院的唱诗班
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

710
01:03:49,570 --> 01:03:51,160
他们唱得很好
They're good.

711
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:53,870
非常好
Very good.

712
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,290
以后几天里 我要探访这地区
I must explore this area in the next few days.

713
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:01,000
某处 有个渴望被发掘的合唱团 在等我发掘
Somewhere, a hungry singing group is waiting for Max Detweiler...

714
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,540
在萨尔兹堡的音乐节时一举成名
...to pluck it out and make it famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

715
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:09,090
-他们成名而你就得利 -那不公平 我得承懧
-They get fame, you get money. -It's unfair, I admit it.

716
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:13,680
但那天一切都会改变的 我也会成名的
But someday that'll be changed. I shall get the fame too.

717
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:22,900
天啊 这是怎么回事？
Good heavens, what's this?

718
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,610
没什么 只是本地的顽童
It's nothing. just some local urchins.

719
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:45,790
这地方真是太美了 又和你在一起
This really is exciting for me, Georg. Being here with you.

720
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,170
树林 湖泽 山峦... 它们都是一样的
Trees, lakes, you've seen them before.

721
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:52,050
你明白我的意思
That is not what I mean, and you know it.

722
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:56,260
-你不是指我令你兴奋？ -不可能吗？
-You mean me? I'm exciting? -Is that so impossible?

723
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:59,560
不是 只是不会发生
No, just highly improbable.

724
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:03,940
-又来了 又看低自己了 -我是危险的驾驶人
-There you go, running yourself down. -Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

725
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:11,450
在这里 盖尔 你看来没这么像个谜
You're much less of a riddle when I see you here, Georg.

726
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:14,490
-在我生长的地方 -是的 正是
-in my natural habitat? -Yes, exactly.

727
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:16,910
你是说在这
Are you saying that I'm more at home...

728
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:21,160
鸟语花香的地方
...among the birds and the flowers and the wind that moves...

729
01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:23,580
我感觉较舒适
...through the trees like a restless sea?

730
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,420
多有诗意啊
How poetic.

731
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,500
是的 我是的 不是吗？
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

732
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:33,760
我在此比在维也纳觉得安逸 在你们那奢华的沙龙里
More at home here than in Vienna in all your glittering salons...

733
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:38,350
和那些无聊汉附庸风雅喝香槟
...gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne...

734
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,350
被华尔兹所牵绊
...stumbling about to waltzes by Strausses I can't even remember?

735
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,730
-你就是想告诉我这些吗？ -多少是吧 是的
-Is that what you're saying? -Yes.

736
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:47,310
你为何会有那概念？
Now whatever gave you that idea?

737
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:54,570
我真的喜欢这儿 盖尔 如此可爱和宁静
Oh, I do like it here, Georg. It's so lovely and peaceful.

738
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,870
你怎舍得如此常离开此地
How can you leave it so often?

739
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,950
我想是假装自己还是很活跃
Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.

740
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:03,410
活跃是建议生命充满了目的
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.

741
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,460
可能是在逃避回忆
Could it be running away from memories?

742
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:13,590
也许是在寻求留下的理由
Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.

743
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,760
我希望那是你常去维也纳的理由
I hope that's why you've been coming to Vienna so often.

744
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,770
-还是那儿有让你着魔的事物？ -我不能说是你令我着魔的
-Were there other distractions? -I'd hardly call you a distraction.

745
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,690
那你如何形容我 盖尔？
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

746
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,230
漂亮...
Lovely...

747
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,820
美丽 聪明有风度 很完美的女主人
...charming, witty, graceful, the perfect hostess...

748
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:35,900
你会恨我这样说的
...and, you're going to hate me for this...

749
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,410
有点像是我的救世主
...in a way, my savior.

750
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:40,490
真不浪漫呀
Oh, how unromantic.

751
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,040
如果我不告诉你 那我就是不知感恩的小人了
I'd be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't say...

752
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,540
是你使我重新体会生命的意义
...that you brought some meaning back into my life.

753
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:51,130
我想我是受宠若惊
I am amusing, I suppose.

754
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:56,130
而我是有维也纳最好的地方 最上流社交圈的朋友
I have the finest couturier in Vienna and a glittering circle of friends.

755
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,470
-和最豪华的派对 -喔 是啊！
-I do give some rather gay parties. -Oh, yes.

756
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,560
除去那些
But take all that away...

757
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,140
你只有财富和一位飘浮不定的我
...and you have just wealthy, unattached little me...

758
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,270
在寻寻觅觅像你一样的人
...searching, just like you.

759
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,070
多来点甜点吗？
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

760
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,860
-我吃了多少？ -两个了
-how many have I had? -Two.

761
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,030
那么它就成为第三个吧
Make it an uneven three.

762
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,370
还在吃 麦斯？一定是不太快乐
Still eating, Max? Must be unhappy.

763
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,540
数月来 我一直想从 何洛克那边弄来四部曲
That mixed quartet I've been trying to steal away from Sol Hurok...

764
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:33,460
-发生何事 达令？ -昨天 沙夏皮特抢先了
-What happened? -...Sascha Petrie stole them first.

765
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:34,960
我最恨的莫过于贼了
I hate thieves.

766
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:38,510
麦斯 你要学习自爱
Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.

767
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,100
为此事我得打长途电话到巴黎
I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.

768
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:44,930
-当然是用盖尔的电话了 -要不然我怎么负担的起
-On Georg's telephone, of course. -How else could I afford it?

769
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:50,520
我喜欢有钱人 喜欢他们的生活方式 尤其和他们一起生活时
I like rich people, the way they live and how I live when I'm with them.

770
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:52,820
我在想孩子们上哪儿去了？
I wonder where the children are.

771
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:55,780
显然地 他们一定是 听见我来了 躲起来了
They must have heard I was coming and hid.

772
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,530
我是希望他们会在家欢迎你的
I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.

773
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,280
麦斯 试着放开朗一些 好吗？
Max, do step out of character for a moment and try and be charming.

774
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,710
怎样？
Well?

775
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:15,840
什么怎样？
Well what?

776
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,970
你让盖尔决定了没？ 我是否会听见婚礼钟声？
Have you made up his mind? Do I hear wedding bells?

777
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,220
-很有希望 -太棒了
-Pealing madly. -Marvelous.

778
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:24,180
-但不一定有婚礼 -那是什么意思？
-Not necessarily for me. -What kind of talk's that?

779
01:08:24,390 --> 01:08:26,020
那跟你无关 麦斯
None-of-your-business talk.

780
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,770
我很喜欢盖尔 我不准你把我们当玩具
I'm terribly fond of him, so don't toy with us.

781
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,600
但当我是孩子时 我喜欢玩具 所以告诉我一切吧
But I'm a child. I like toys. So tell me everything.

782
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:37,990
快点 告诉麦斯一切的细节
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy, intimate, disgusting detail.

783
01:08:39,450 --> 01:08:43,580
我们可以说 我有感觉 我可能会被懧可
Well, let's just say I have a feeling I may be here on approval.

784
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,870
-我同意 你怎会错过？ -很容易的
-I approve of that. how can you miss? -Far too easily.

785
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,330
如我了解你的话 达令 我知道你会找到方法的
If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.

786
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:53,130
他不是普通人 他很富有
-He's no ordinary man. -No, he's rich.

787
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,630
当他老婆死后 给他带来他可怕的心痛
His wife's death gave him a great heartache.

788
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,970
当你先生死时 他留给你一笔“可怕”的遗产
And your husband's death gave you a great fortune.

789
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:01,130
麦斯 你真是怪物
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

790
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:05,390
你和盖尔对我来讲就像是一家人 所以我想看到你们两人结婚
You and Georg are like family. That's why I want to see you married.

791
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,180
我们必须保留那笔钱 在同一家庭中
We must keep all that lovely money in the family.

792
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,410
-你在干什么？ -范舰长
-What are you doing there? -Oh, captain von Trapp.

793
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:30,710
我正在找...
I was just looking for... .

794
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,420
我没看到你 我不知道你...
I didn't see, I mean, I didn't know you were--

795
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,710
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler!

796
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,920
你是谁？
Who are you?

797
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,420
我送电报给德维勒先生
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

798
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:44,430
-我就是 -是的 先生
-I am Herr Detweiler. -Yes, sir.

799
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:52,140
好 电报你送到了 滚吧
You've delivered your telegram. Now get out.

800
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:02,240
-盖尔 他只是个小男孩 -是 而我只是奥国人
-Georg, he's just a boy. -Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

801
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:05,280
要发生的迟早会发生 只要确定不会发生在你身上
Things will happen. Make sure they don't happen to you.

802
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:08,240
麦斯 你千万别再这样说
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

803
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:10,700
你知道我没有政治主张
I have no political convictions.

804
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:13,830
-我能帮上什么吗？ -是的 你可以帮忙的
-can I help It If other people do? -You can help it.

805
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,170
你非帮不可
You must help it.

806
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,060
哈啰
Hello?

807
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,480
你如此遥远 你在哪儿？
You're far away. Where are you?

808
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:38,650
在一个遥不可及的世界里
In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.

809
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:43,030
有办法带你回到现实世界吗？
Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I'm in?

810
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,520
-爸爸！爸爸！ -你们的爸爸！
-Father! Father! -There's your father!

811
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,940
哦 舰长 你回来了
Oh, captain, you're home!

812
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,990
立刻从水里上来
Come out of that water at once!

813
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:37,250
你一定是史蕾特男爵夫人
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

814
01:11:42,550 --> 01:11:45,590
我湿透了！
I'm soaked to the skin!

815
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,940
排好
Straight line!

816
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,040
这位是史蕾特男爵夫人
This is Baroness Schraeder.

817
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,420
而这些
And these...

818
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:22,290
是我的孩子们
...are my children.

819
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,840
你们好
How do you do?

820
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,640
进屋去洗干净、换件衣服 再回来这里 立刻！
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change your clothes and report back here!

821
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,730
小姐 请你留下来
Fraülein, you will stay here, please!

822
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,020
我最好去看麦斯在干什么
I think I'd better go see what Max is up to.

823
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,040
现在 小姐
Now, Fraülein...

824
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,000
我要你据实回答
...I want a truthful answer.

825
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,870
是的 舰长
Yes, captain.

826
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:05,250
是真有可能？我只是刚想到的
Is it possible, or could I have just imagined it?

827
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,220
我的孩子们今天有爬过树吗？
Have my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?

828
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:12,890
是的 舰长
Yes, captain.

829
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,260
这样
I see.

830
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:20,350
我能否请教他们哪来的这些？
And where, may I ask, did they get these... .

831
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,690
-游戏服 -你是如此称呼它们的？
-Play clothes. -Is that What They are?

832
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,320
是我拿我卧房里的旧窗帘所做的
I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.

833
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:29,240
-窗帘 -还剩下很多
-Drapes? -They have plenty of wear left.

834
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:31,360
孩子们穿着玩了不少地方
We've been everywhere in them.

835
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:36,120
你是在告诉我 我的孩子穿着旧窗帘的布料
Are you telling me that my children have been roaming about Salzburg...

836
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:39,660
玩遍了萨尔兹堡
...dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?

837
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:41,540
是的 而且玩得很开心
And having a marvelous time!

838
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:45,000
-他们有制服 -对不起那是疯子穿的
-They have uniforms. -Forgive me, straitjackets.

839
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:48,010
孩子们不该担心 会弄脏珍贵的制服
They can't be children if they worry about clothes--

840
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,380
我没听过埋怨
They don't complain.

841
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:52,340
他们不敢 他们太爱你
They don't dare. They love you too much and fear--

842
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,140
我不希望在此情况下讨论我的孩子
Don't discuss my children.

843
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:56,260
你必须听 你都不在家久留
You've got to hear, you're never home--

844
01:13:56,470 --> 01:13:57,970
我说过不喜欢听你说
I don't want to hear more!

845
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:00,730
我知道你不要 但你必须
I know you don't, but you've got to!

846
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,690
-就拿莉莎来说吧... -你别再说有关莉莎一句
-Liesl's not a child. -Not one word--

847
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,820
她有天会成为女人 而你甚至不了解她
Soon she'll be a woman and you won't even know her.

848
01:14:07,070 --> 01:14:10,150
费瑞克想要成为一个男人 却没有人给他作榜样
Friedrich wants to be a man but you're not here to show--

849
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,780
你胆敢说我儿子的事
Don't you dare tell me--

850
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:15,240
碧姬塔能告诉你这些 她知道一切事情
Brigitta could tell you about him. She notices everything.

851
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:18,620
还有寇特 当你忽略他时 他假装坚强 隐藏伤痛
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain when you ignore him...

852
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,370
你总是这样对待他们
...the way you do all of them.

853
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:23,040
还有露易莎 我还不了解她 但总有人要去了解她
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

854
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:26,500
还有最小的 她只想要被爱 求求你 舰长 爱他们
The little ones just want love. Please, love them all.

855
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:28,300
我不想再听你说有关孩子的事
I don't care to hear more.

856
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:32,630
-我还没说完 -是的 你说完了
-I am not finished yet, captain! -Oh, yes, you are, captain!

857
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,340
小姐
Fraülein.

858
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:40,770
你现在立刻收拾行李
Now, you will pack your things this minute...

859
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,480
回去修道院
...and return to the abbey.

860
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,440
那是什么？
What's that?

861
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:50,190
有人在唱歌
It's singing.

862
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:53,660
我知道 但是谁在唱歌？
Yes, I realize it's singing. But who is singing?

863
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,200
孩子们
The children.

864
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,410
孩子们
The children?

865
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:03,710
我教他们一首歌欢迎男爵夫人
I taught them something to sing for the baroness.

I'm far too outspoken. It's one of my worst faults.

893
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,390

01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:44,780
那真是跳得太棒了
Why, that was beautifully done.

1047
01:32:44,980 --> 01:32:46,940
你们是迷人的一对
What a lovely couple you make.

1048
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:49,280
我想孩子们该上床了
It's time the children said good night.

1049
01:32:49,530 --> 01:32:50,860
是的 我们马上去前厅
We'll be in the hall.

1050
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:53,990
-我们有特别节目 对不对？ -对！
-We have something special prepared. -Right!

1051
01:32:54,240 --> 01:32:55,450
是的 快点
Yes, come on!

1052
01:33:02,290 --> 01:33:04,630
盖尔 你无需担心
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1053
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,920
以为舞会上找不到朋友
You thought you wouldn't find a friend at the party.

1054
01:33:10,840 --> 01:33:14,390
-今晚外面有点凉 是不是？ -我不知道
-A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it? -Oh, I don't know.

1055
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:16,640
似乎有些暖和呢！
It seemed rather warm to me.

1056
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,060
先生女士们！
Ladies and gentlemen.

1057
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:26,900
范崔普舰长的孩子 希望向各位道晚安
The children of Captain von Trapp wish to say good night to you.

他们真是不同凡响 想想在音乐节的成绩
Extraordinary! What they'd do at the festival.

1092
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:37,800
年轻女士 我必须跟你谈谈
Young lady, I must have a word with you.

1093
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,850
盖尔 你不能让她离去的 她必须参加派对
Georg, you won't let this girl get away. She must join the party.

1094
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,520
-不 我真的... 别说了
-No, really l-- -Stop. Stop It now.

1095
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:48,730
-盖尔 拜托 -如你愿意的话 可以留下来
-Georg, please. -You can if you want to, Fraülein.

1096
01:36:48,940 --> 01:36:51,400
我坚持 你会是我今晚的女伴
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.

1097
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:53,570
-这是生意 -福兰斯
This is business. Franz...

1098
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:56,990
在我的座位旁 替玛丽亚小姐加一个位子
...set another place next to mine for Fraülein Maria.

1099
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:01,910
-悉听尊便 -似乎已安排好了
-Whatever you say. -It appears to be all arranged.

1100
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:04,540
-看似如此 -我的打扮不适合
-It does. -I'm not suitably dressed.

1101
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,160
你可以换衣服 我们等你
You can change. We'll wait.

1102
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:13,670
舰长 你一定是 很以你的儿女为荣
Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.

1103
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:14,750
是的 谢谢你
I am, thank you.

1104
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:19,550
还有什么能比孩子的歌声
Is there a more beautiful expression of what is good in our country...

1105
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,260
更能表现我国的优点
...than the innocent voices of our children?

1106
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,020
对了 男爵
Oh, come now, baron.

1107
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:29,020
你想要我们相信 只有奥国有独特高尚的品德？
Would you have us believe that Austria holds a monopoly on virtue?

1108
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:34,020
我们有些人喜欢以悠扬歌声
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer Austrian voices raised in song...

1109
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,650
对抗丑陋德国的威胁
...to ugly German threats.

1110
01:37:37,740 --> 01:37:41,320
鸵鸟喜欢埋首于沙中
The ostrich buries his head in the sand...

1111
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:44,490
有时藏于国旗里
...and sometimes in the flag.

1112
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:49,250
或许有些人警告你 合并就要来临了
Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1113
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,210
而就要来了 舰长 或许会以音乐来跟你打交道呢
...would get further with you by setting their words to music.

1114
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:58,050
如果纳粹占据奥国 你会是整个喇叭队
If the Nazis take over Austria, you will be the entire trumpet section.

1115
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,420
你太恭维我了 舰长
You flatter me.

1116
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:04,350
我是多么笨拙 我是要指责你的
Oh, how clumsy of me. I meant to accuse you.

1117
01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:14,560
你愿意来协助我 真的太仁慈了 男爵夫人
It's very kind of you to offer to help me, baroness.

1118
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:16,440
我很乐意
I'm delighted, Maria.

1119
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:20,610
但我实在没有任何适合的衣服
I really don't think I have anything that would be appropriate.

1120
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:25,200
那晚你穿的那件迷人衣服呢
Now where is that lovely little thing you were wearing the other evening?

1121
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:28,750
使舰长无法将视线移开你身上
When the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you.

1122
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:33,960
无法转移他的目光？
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1123
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,090
得了吧 亲爱的 我们都是女人
Come, my dear, we are women.

1124
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:40,670
别再假装我们不知道 男人注意我们
Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us.

1125
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:44,390
在此 舰长知道每个人和每件事
-Here we are. -The captain notices everybody.

1126
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:47,390
你无需如此抗拒的 玛丽亚
There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.

1127
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,060
你很迷人 你知道吗？
You are quite attractive, you know.

1128
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:53,980
如果舰长不注意你的话 他就不是男人了
The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you.

1129
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,940
男爵夫人 我希望你在开玩笑
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1130
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,650
一点也不！
Not at all.

1131
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,490
但我从来没有做过此事
I've never done a thing to--

1132
01:39:01,740 --> 01:39:03,360
你无需如此
You don't have to, my dear.

1133
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:08,790
心仪的女人让男人抗拒不了
Nothing's more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.

1134
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:12,540
-爱他吗？ 是的
-in love With him? -Of course.

1135
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:16,880
他以为他爱上你了
What makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.

1136
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:21,220
但那不是事实
But that's not true.

1137
01:39:21,550 --> 01:39:25,090
你当然注意到 他注视你时的眼神吧
Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.

1138
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:30,270
而且当你和他跳舞时 你在他臂弯中脸都红了
And you know, you blushed in his arms when you were dancing just now.

1139
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:33,230
别太介意
Don't take it to heart.

1140
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,770
他很快就会适应的
He'll get over it soon enough, I think.

1141
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:37,980
男人都是如此的
Men do, you know.

1142
01:39:39,030 --> 01:39:40,070
那我必须离开了
Then I should go.

1143
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:42,900
我不能留在此地
I mustn't stay here.

1144
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:56,750
-我能帮什么忙吗？ -没有
-is there something I can do to help? -No, Nothing.

1145
01:39:58,590 --> 01:39:59,800
有的
Yes.

1146
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,840
求你别告诉舰长这件事
Don't say a word to the captain.

1147
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:08,010
不 我一个字也不会提
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1148
01:40:14,770 --> 01:40:16,400
再见 玛丽亚
Goodbye, Maria.

1149
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,980
我相信你会成为很好的修女
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1150
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,020
香槟
Champagne, darling.

1151
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:56,390
我觉得该庆祝一下 干杯
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1152
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:04,780
-你消息灵通 -或许吧
-you know something. -Perhaps.

1153
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:09,570
如果你如此聪明 告诉我如何要玛丽亚影响盖尔
If you're so clever, tell me how to get Fraülein to influence Georg.

1154
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:12,450
我要这些孩子参加节庆
I want those children in the festival.

1155
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:15,160
这对奥国深具意义的
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1156
01:41:15,410 --> 01:41:17,120
对你也不会有妨害的
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1157
01:41:17,370 --> 01:41:18,920
我曾想过
I thought of that.

1158
01:41:19,170 --> 01:41:21,630
谈到影响
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1159
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,760
你该找我谈才对
...maybe the one you have to be talking to is me.

1160
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:43,500
(中场休息)

1161
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:57,520
(进场)

1162
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:56,800
-二 -三
-Two. -Three.

1163

1169
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,860
真好玩！
Isn't this fun?

1170
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:21,610
-四 -我是第五
-Four. -I'm number five.

1171
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:24,030

-Oh, yes. -Eight.

1172

二
Two.

1175
01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:36,130
夫人 我们累了 不要玩了
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind if we stop now? We're tired.

1176
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,340
随便你们
Whatever you want, dear.

1177
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:40,590
明天再玩
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1178
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,940
乡间真安静 不是吗？
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1179
01:45:53,980 --> 01:45:55,610
喝点柠檬水吧
Have some lemonade.

1180
01:45:56,860 --> 01:45:58,280
一定有更容易的办法
There must be an easier way.

1181
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:02,950
想到你做蒳个孩子的妈妈 真令我哭笑不得
I get a fiendish delight thinking of you as the mother of seven.

1182
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:05,740
你计划如何做呢？
How do you plan to do it?

1183
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:08,030
亲爱的 你没听过
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1184
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:11,410
寄宿学校吗？
...of a delightful little thing called boarding school?

1185
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:14,790
你真狡诈独裁
Baroness Machiavelli.

1186
01:46:16,130 --> 01:46:18,130
麦伯伯 爸爸在哪？
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1187
01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:20,210
我想他在屋子里
I think he's in the house.

1188
01:46:20,420 --> 01:46:22,970
你们为何都闷闷不乐呢？
What's the matter with all you gloomy pussies?

1189
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:25,970
-没什么 -我知道怎么办 我们来练习唱歌
-Nothing. -I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1190
01:46:26,220 --> 01:46:27,090
为了什么呢？
What for?

1191
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:29,810
假装我站在节庆的表演台上
Let's make believe we're on-stage at the festival.

1192
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:33,890
-我不想唱歌 -没有玛丽亚我不想唱
-I don't feel like singing. -Not without Fraülein Maria.

1193
01:46:34,140 --> 01:46:36,520
莉莎去拿吉他 快点各位
Liesl, get the guitar. Come on, Marta.

1194
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:39,730
去各就各位 这就对了
Everybody into the group. Get in your places.

1195
01:46:39,980 --> 01:46:42,740
高兴点 给我们一点音乐 莉莎
Now be cheerful, right? Give us the key, Liesl.

1196
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:47,320
现在 开始
Now, impress me.

1197
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,660
葛特儿 你为何不唱呢？
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1198
01:46:52,950 --> 01:46:55,410
我手指痛不能唱
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1199
01:46:56,460 --> 01:46:59,460
但是你在舞会中唱得很好
But you sang so beautifully the night of the party.

1200
01:46:59,710 --> 01:47:02,050
来 试试看 唱一唱你会好的
Come on, all of you. Try something you know.

1201
01:47:02,300 --> 01:47:03,800
快乐点
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1202
01:47:04,050 --> 01:47:05,670
好了 莉莎
All right, Liesl.

玛丽亚真的不回来了吗？
Is it true Fraülein Maria isn't coming back?

1214
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:11,320
是的 我想是不回来了 有什么好喝吗？
Yes, I suppose it's true. What have we got here?

1215
01:48:11,660 --> 01:48:16,370
-粉红柠檬水 -至少有柠檬水
-Pink lemonade. -Laced With lemonade.

1216
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:18,580
爸爸 我不敢相信
I don't believe it, father.

1217
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,040
-亲爱的 不相信什么 -关于玛丽亚
-What? -About Fraülein Maria.

1218
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:23,670
哦 玛丽亚
Oh, Fraülein Maria!

1219
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,420
我没把她的留言告诉你们吗？ 我确定我说过了
Didn't I tell you what her note said? I'm sure I did.

1220
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:30,680
她说她很想念修道院的人
She said she missed her life at the abbey.

1221
01:48:30,930 --> 01:48:33,090
她必须离开我们
She had to leave us.

1222
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:34,930
就这样
And that's all there is to it.

1223
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:39,310
好 我现在想尝点柠檬水
I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.

1224
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:42,270
-她甚至没有告别 -她在留言上有说
-She didn't even say goodbye. -She did in her note.

1225
01:48:42,520 --> 01:48:44,360
那是不同的事
That isn't the same thing.

1226
01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:46,270
不甜不酸
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1227
01:48:47,030 --> 01:48:49,030
只是太粉红了
Just too pink.

1228
01:48:50,450 --> 01:48:53,570
爸爸 谁是新的家庭教师？
Father, who is our new governess going to be?

1229
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:01,250
嗯...
Well...

1230
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:08,880
你们再也不会有家庭教师了
...you're not going to have a governess anymore.

1231
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,840
-不会有？ -不会
-We're not? -No.

1232
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:16,220
你们将要有个新妈妈
You're going to have a new mother.

1233
01:49:17,310 --> 01:49:19,350
一个新妈妈？
A new mother?

1234
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:23,310
我们昨晚谈过了 一切都决定安排好了
We talked about it last night. It's all settled.

1235
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,230
我们都将会很快乐
And we're all going to be very happy.

1236
01:49:59,220 --> 01:50:01,680
好了...去玩吧
Well, all right, all right. Run off and play.

1237
01:50:33,670 --> 01:50:34,630
是的 我的孩子们
Yes, my children?

1238
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:37,220
-我叫莉莎 -是的
-my name is Liesl. -Yes, Liesl?

1239
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:41,680
我们 我的兄弟姐妹 我们要见玛丽亚小姐
We, my brothers and sisters, want to see Fraülein Maria.

1240
01:50:42,850 --> 01:50:44,850
小姐？
Fraülein Maria?

1241
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:47,560
哦 玛丽亚
Oh, Maria.

1242
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,310
请进来
Come in, please.

1243
01:50:55,240 --> 01:50:56,740
在这等一下
Wait here.

1244
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:10,880
我是玛格丽特修女 我知道你们想见玛丽亚
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand you inquired about Maria.

1245
01:51:11,130 --> 01:51:13,630
我们必须见她 请你告诉她我们在这
We have to see her. Will you tell her we're here?

1246
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,460
-恐怕我做不到 -你一定要告诉她
-I'm afraid I can't do that. -But you've got to!

1247
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,800
-她是我们的家教 -我们要她回来
-She's our governess. -We want her back.

1248
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:20,930
-她甚至没有道别 -这件事很重要
She didn't even say goodbye.

1249
01:51:21,180 --> 01:51:22,930
我们只想和她说说话
All we want to do is talk to her.

1250
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:26,600
我很抱歉 孩子们 但是玛丽亚在修行
I'm very sorry, but Maria is in seclusion.

1251
01:51:26,850 --> 01:51:29,940
-她不愿见任何人 -她会见我们的
-She hasn't been seeing anyone. -She'll see us.

1252
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,690
我要把我的手指给她看
I want to show her my finger.

1253
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:34,730
亲爱的 改天吧
Some other time, dear.

1254
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,360
我会告诉她 你们来过
I'll tell her you were here.

1255
01:51:36,610 --> 01:51:39,700
-谢谢你们来 -我们要见玛丽亚...
-It was sweet of you to call. -We have to speak to her!

1256
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:43,450
好了 走吧 孩子们 回家吧
Run along, children. Run along home.

1257
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:45,330
我知道她会见我们的
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1258
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:47,830
玛格丽特修女 求求你
Sister Margaretta, please.

1259
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:51,790
-再见 孩子们 -玛格丽特修女 拜托你...
-Goodbye, children. -Sister Margaretta, may We, please?

1260
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:56,300
那是怎么回事 玛格丽特修女
What was that about, Sister?

1261
01:51:56,550 --> 01:51:58,710
院长 范崔普家的孩子
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.

1262
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,420
他们要见玛丽亚
They want to see Maria.

1263
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,010
她说话了没？ 她有没有告诉你发生了什么事？
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?

1264
01:52:04,260 --> 01:52:08,260
院长 除了祈祷外 她什么也没说
She doesn't say a word, Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1265
01:52:08,520 --> 01:52:09,520
可怜的孩子
Poor child.

1266
01:52:09,730 --> 01:52:12,690
很奇怪 她似乎是很快乐地回来
It's strange. She seems happy to be back here...

1267
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:16,190
但现在似乎又不快乐了
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1268
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:20,570
或许让她离开我们那么久 是错误的
Perhaps I have been wrong in leaving her alone so long.

1269
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:23,490
我想你最好把她带来见我 即使她还没准备好
Bring her to me, even if she's not yet ready.

1270
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:25,370
是的 院长
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1271
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:34,420
加丝特修女 带这位新姐妹到更衣室
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant to the robing room.

1272
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:37,670
愿上帝祝福你 我的女儿！
God bless you, my daughter.

1273
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:45,590
是的 带她进来
Yes, bring her in.

1274
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:56,850
你很不快乐 我很抱歉
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1275
01:52:58,900 --> 01:53:00,110
院长
Reverend Mother.

1276
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:03,110
他们为何要你回来？
Why did they send you back to us?

1277
01:53:03,950 --> 01:53:05,910
院长 他们没有送我回来 是我主动离开的
They didn't send me back. I left.

1278
01:53:08,410 --> 01:53:09,990
坐下 玛丽亚
Sit down, Maria.

1279
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:12,290
告诉我事情的始末
Tell me what happened.

1280
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:18,790
因为我惊恐
I was frightened.

1281
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:23,550
-惊恐 是不是他们对你不好？ -哦 不是
-Frightened? Were they unkind to you. -Oh, no!

1282
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:27,510
我很迷惑
No, I was confused. I felt... .

1283
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,060
我从未有那种感觉
I've never felt that way before.

1284
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:35,060
我不能留下来 我知道远离他们会比较安全
I couldn't stay. I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1285
01:53:35,310 --> 01:53:40,020
玛丽亚 我们的修道院 不是用来逃避的
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.

1286
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:42,530
是什么事 你无法面对
What is it you can't face?

1287
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:45,900
我无法再面对他
I can't face him again.

1288
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:48,240
他？
Him?

1289
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:51,910
谢谢你 玛格丽特修女
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1290
01:54:01,500 --> 01:54:03,170
是范崔普舰长？
Captain von Trapp?

1291
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:11,300
-你是否爱上他了？ -我不知道...
-Are you in love with him? -I don't know!

1292
01:54:11,550 --> 01:54:12,970
我不知道...
I don't know. I--

1293
01:54:13,560 --> 01:54:17,390
男爵夫人 她...说他爱上我了
The baroness said I was. She said that he was in love with me.

1294
01:54:17,640 --> 01:54:20,270
但我不相信
But I didn't want to believe it.

1295
01:54:21,400 --> 01:54:23,650
有时候当我们彼此对看时
There were times we looked at each other.

1296
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:25,440
院长 我简直不能呼吸
I could hardly breathe.

1297
01:54:25,780 --> 01:54:28,530
-你让他知道你的感受了吗？ -就算有 我也不知道
-Did you let him see your feelings? -I don't know.

1298
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:31,780
那就是我的苦闷 我去那是上帝的旨意
That's what's torturing me. I was on God's errand.

1299
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:36,950
我们两人相爱会是错的 我不能留下 我就是不能留下
To have asked for his love would have been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1300
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:41,960
这时候我真的要发誓
I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.

1301
01:54:42,830 --> 01:54:45,920
-请帮助我 -玛丽亚
-please help me. -Maria.

1302
01:54:47,460 --> 01:54:52,180
男女之间的关系也是神圣的 你有机会得到爱
The love of a man and a woman is holy. You have a great capacity to love.

1303
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:55,350
你必须了解 上帝要你如何地去爱
You must find out how God wants you to spend your love.

1304
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:59,480
但我已献身上帝 我要终生为上帝服务
But I pledged my life to God. I pledged my life to his service.

1305
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:04,060
我的女儿 如果你爱这个人 并不表示你就要少爱上帝了
My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.

1306
01:55:05,730 --> 01:55:07,610
这样不行
No.

1307
01:55:07,820 --> 01:55:09,690
你必须找出答案
You must find out.

1308
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:13,950
你必须要回去
You must go back.

1340
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:51,100
我们没有鬼鬼祟祟 爸爸
We're not being secretive, father.

1341
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:56,150
吃饭迟到也不像我的孩子
And it's not like my children to be late for dinner.

1342
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,860
-我们忘了时间而已 -是这样吗？
-We lost track of the time. -I see.

1343
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:04,080
好了 谁要第一个告诉我事实 费瑞克？
Who's going to be the first one to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1344
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:06,370
碧姬塔？莉莎？
Brigitta. Liesl.

1345
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:09,960
爸爸 你懧为我们去哪？
Where do you think we were, father?

1346
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:20,550
如果你不相信我们 那我们去哪 你心里一定有数
If you don't believe us, you must have some idea of where you think we were.

1347
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,930
-玛塔？ -是的 爸爸
-Marta. -Yes, father.

1348
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:27,390
你来告诉我
You tell me.

1349
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:32,350
碧姬塔说了 爸爸 我们去采莓子了
Friedrich told you, father. we were berry picking.

1350
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:37,820
-我忘了 你们去采莓子了 -是啊 我们很爱采莓子
-I forgot!You were berry picking. -Yes, we love berry picking.

1351
01:58:38,070 --> 01:58:39,190
整个下午？
All afternoon?

1352
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,150
-是的 我们采了几千颗 -几千颗？
-We picked thousands. -Thousands?

1353
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:44,280
-满山遍野都是 -哪一种莓？
-They were all over the place. -What kind of berries?

1354
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:47,830
-是蓝莓 -蓝莓
-Blueberries, sir. -Blueberries.

1355
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:53,120
蓝莓的季节还没到耶...
It's too early for blueberries.

1356
01:58:54,580 --> 01:58:56,670
-是草莓 -是草莓？
-They were strawberries. -Strawberries?

1357
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:00,130
最近很冷 所以它们变成蓝色了
It's been so cold lately, they turned blue.

1358
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:08,140
很好 把莓子拿给我看
Very well. Show me the berries.

1359
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:10,600
-我们... -这个嘛...
-We... . -Well... .

1360
01:59:10,850 --> 01:59:13,600
-快把莓子给我 -我们一个也没了
-Show me the berries you picked. -We don't have them.

1361
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:16,100
一个也没了？ 发生了什么事？
You don't have them? What happened to them?

1362
01:59:16,350 --> 01:59:19,150
我们...我们把它们都吃了
-We... . -We ate them.

1363
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:21,940
-你们吃了它们 -是啊 是啊
-You ate them? -Yes!

1364
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:23,740
-很好吃 -非常的好
-They were so Good. -Delicious.

1365
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,200
非常好
Very well.

1366
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:30,580
既然你们吃了几千颗的莓子
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves on thousands of berries...

1367
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:34,750
你们不可能胜子饿了 所以我可以告诉思蜜德
...you can't be hungry anymore, so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1368
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,880
不用煮你们的晚餐
...to skip your dinner.

1369
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:49,800
都是你的错 我们应该老实告诉他
It's your fault. we should have told him the truth.

1370
01:59:50,050 --> 01:59:52,060
让他对我们生气
And made him boiling mad at us?

1371
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:54,180
总比饿死好
It's better than starving to death.

1372
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:57,270
我们没有做错什么 我们只是想看她
We didn't do anything wrong. we just wanted to see her.

1373
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:01,730
我的胜子在咕咕叫了
My stomach's making noises.

1374
02:00:02,150 --> 02:00:04,990
她们至少该让我们跟她打个招呼
The least they could have done was to let us say hello.

1375
02:00:06,110 --> 02:00:10,030
-我在想 不知野草的味道如何... -我觉得糟透了
-I wonder What grass tastes like. -I feel awful.

1376
02:00:10,450 --> 02:00:14,740
玛丽亚要觉得愉快些时 她就唱那首歌记得吗？
When Fraülein Maria wanted to feel better she used to sing that song.

1377

晚安
Good evening.

1415
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:34,510
好了 大家都进去吃晚餐
Everyone inside for dinner.

1416
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:36,380
晚饭
Dinner!

1417
02:02:45,730 --> 02:02:50,400
你不告而别 甚至连小孩们都没道别
You left without saying goodbye. Even to the children.

1418
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:52,980
是我的错 请原谅我
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1419
02:02:55,030 --> 02:02:56,200
为什么要如此？
Why did you?

1420
02:02:56,410 --> 02:02:59,240
请不要问我 反正原因已经不存在了
Please don't ask me. the reason no longer exists.

1421
02:03:00,410 --> 02:03:03,500
玛丽亚 你回来了
Fraülein Maria, you've returned.

1422
02:03:04,710 --> 02:03:06,540
盖尔 这不是很好吗？
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1423
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,050
男爵夫人 我祝福你幸福快乐
I wish you every happiness, baroness.

1424
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:15,010
你也是 舰长 孩子们告诉我你们要结婚了
You too, captain. the children say you're to marry.

1425
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:16,340
谢谢你 亲爱的
Thank you, my dear.

1426
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:22,470
你再回来 是要留下吗？
You are back to stay?

1427
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,890
只待到下一位老师来为止
Only until arrangements can be made for another governess.

1428
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:25,200
原来你在这里
There you are.

1429
02:04:39,550 --> 02:04:42,090
牛肉面包太好吃了
I must speak to cook about the schnitzel.

1430
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:45,640
这会影响我的身材
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.

1431
02:04:46,060 --> 02:04:49,020
你在餐桌上没说很多话
And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.

1432
02:04:49,270 --> 02:04:51,270
是不是酒的关系？
Or was it the wine?

1433
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:53,350
应该是酒的因素
Undoubtedly the wine.

1434
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:58,190
你不知道为了要送你 一件结婚礼物
You have no idea the trouble I'm having...

1435
02:04:58,440 --> 02:05:01,190
我费尽了多少心思
...trying to decide on a wedding present for you.

1436
02:05:01,450 --> 02:05:03,610
我知道 我说够了
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1437
02:05:03,860 --> 02:05:07,530
但是我要你有不同的礼物
But I do want you to have some little trifle for the occasion.

1438
02:05:07,740 --> 02:05:10,080
我首先想到的是钢笔
At first I thought of a fountain pen...

1439
02:05:10,330 --> 02:05:12,580
但是你已有一支
...but you've already got one.

1440
02:05:12,830 --> 02:05:15,790
然后我想送你一幢法国的别墅
Then I thought perhaps a villa in the south of France...

1441
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:18,710
但是它很难包装起来
...but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.

1442
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,380
你觉得游艇如何？
Oh, Georg, how do you feel about yachts?

1443
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:23,920
一艘豪华雅致 可航行地中海的？
A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean...

1444
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,930
还是一艘小的 放浴缸里？
...or a tiny one for your bathtub, huh?

1445
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:31,140
-艾莎... -我们要去哪渡蜜月？
-Elsa. -Where to go On our honeymoon?

1446
02:05:31,390 --> 02:05:32,980
这可真是个难题了
Now, that's a real problem.

1447
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:36,560
我想在森林里旅行会很棒
A trip around the world would be lovely. and then I said:

1448
02:05:36,810 --> 02:05:39,690
但一定会有更好的地方...
Oh, Elsa, there must be someplace better to go.

1449
02:05:39,940 --> 02:05:42,360
-不过不用担心 达令 我会... -艾莎
-But don't worry, darling, I'll-- -Elsa.

1450
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:44,280
什么事？盖尔
Yes, Georg.

1451
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:46,610
这样行不通的
It's no use...

1452
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:49,240
你和我
...you and l.

1453
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:54,040
我一直都没有坦诚面对 你和我的关系
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1454
02:05:55,370 --> 02:05:57,000
这对你一点都不公平
...and utterly unfair to you.

1455
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:05,050
-当两个人谈论到婚嫁时... -不要
-When two people talk of marriage-- -No, don't.

1456
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:08,010
不要再说了 拜托你
Don't say another word, please.

1457
02:06:11,310 --> 02:06:16,350
你知道 我还在想其他的事
You see, there are other things I've been thinking of.

1458
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:21,980
虽然我喜欢你 但是我真的不懧为你适合我
Fond as I am of you, I really don't think you're the right man for me.

1459
02:06:24,530 --> 02:06:26,990
你太独立了 而我...
You're much too independent.

1460
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:32,030
我要一个非常需要我的人
And I need someone who needs me desperately...

1461
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:35,330
或至少非常需要我的钱
...or at least needs my money desperately.

1462
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:42,420
和你在一起的每分钟 我都很快乐 谢谢你
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together and I do thank you for that.

1463
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:47,050
失陪一下 我现在要进去了
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1464
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:49,340
收拾我的行李
...I'll go inside, pack my little bags...

1465
02:06:49,590 --> 02:06:52,100
回到我原属的地方 维也纳
...and return to Vienna where I belong.

1466
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:59,310
那边有个人
And somewhere out there...

1467
02:06:59,560 --> 02:07:03,980
是位年轻小姐
...is a young lady who, I think...

1468
02:07:04,230 --> 02:07:05,480
我想她做不成修女了
...will never be a nun.

1469
02:07:17,620 --> 02:07:19,960
亲爱的 再见了
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1470
02:07:45,690 --> 02:07:46,860
哈啰
Hello.

1471
02:07:52,660 --> 02:07:56,240
我想我可能会在这里找到你
I thought I just might find you here.

1472
02:08:00,410 --> 02:08:02,710
你有什么事吗？
Was there something you wanted?

1473
02:08:03,080 --> 02:08:06,250
没有 没有 请坐下
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1474
02:08:07,170 --> 02:08:08,550
请坐
Please.

1475
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:15,010
我可以吗？
May l?

1476
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:32,110
你知道 我在想 在思索两件事情
You know, I was thinking and I was wondering two things:

1477
02:08:33,240 --> 02:08:37,530
为什么你逃回修道院？
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1478
02:08:38,330 --> 02:08:43,040
还有 是什么让你回来的？
And what was it that made you come back?

1479
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:49,130
这个嘛 我有责任要完成
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill...

1480
02:08:49,380 --> 02:08:51,510
我回来履行的
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1481
02:08:52,130 --> 02:08:53,590
只是这样吗？
Is that all?

1482
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:57,050
还有 我想念孩子们
And I missed the children.

1483
02:08:57,390 --> 02:08:58,600
是的
Yes.

1484
02:08:59,850 --> 02:09:02,770
-只有小孩们？ -不只...是的
-Only the children? -No. yes.

1485
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:06,770
-我不可以想念他们吗？ -喔...当然可以
-Isn't it right that I missed them? -Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1486
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,650
我只是希望 也许你能...
I was only hoping that perhaps you... .

1487
02:09:10,770 --> 02:09:12,530
也许你可以...
Perhaps you might... .

1488
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:15,490
什么？
Yes?

1489
02:09:17,240 --> 02:09:22,580
嗯...当你离开后
Well, nothing was the same when you were away...

1490
02:09:23,290 --> 02:09:26,540
一切都变样了 又不正常了
...and it'll be all wrong again after you leave...

1491
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:31,460
我只是想也许 你会改变心意留下来
...and I just thought perhaps you might change your mind.

1492
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:39,720
我想男爵夫人一定会把 一切的事情都安排得很好
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.

1493
02:09:39,970 --> 02:09:41,350
玛丽亚
Maria... .

1494
02:09:43,470 --> 02:09:46,980
-再也没有什么男爵夫人了 -没有了吗？
-There isn't going to be any baroness. -There isn't?

1495
02:09:49,350 --> 02:09:50,730
没有
No.

1496
02:09:51,020 --> 02:09:52,820
我不了解
I don't understand.

1497
02:09:55,190 --> 02:09:59,320
我们已经解除婚约了
Well, we've called off our engagement, you see, and--

1498
02:09:59,570 --> 02:10:03,030
-很遗憾 -是的 你很难过吗？
-Oh, I'm sorry. -Yes. You are?

1499
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,370
-你解除婚约了？ -是的
-You did? -Yes.

1500
02:10:07,460 --> 02:10:12,000
你不能和一个人结婚
Well, you can't marry someone when you're...

1501
02:10:14,500 --> 02:10:16,590
而心里却爱着另一个人
...in love with someone else...

1502
02:10:20,010 --> 02:10:21,430
你能不能...
...can you?

1503
02:10:56,300 --> 02:10:58,590
院长常说
The Reverend Mother always says:

1504
02:10:58,840 --> 02:11:02,260
当上帝关上一扇门时 在某处 祂会开启另一扇窗
When the Lord closes a door, somewhere He opens a window.

1505
02:11:10,640 --> 02:11:13,730
院长还说其他的吗？
What else does the Reverend Mother say?

1506
02:11:14,650 --> 02:11:17,070
“你需要寻求你自己的生命”		That you have to look for your life.

1507
02:11:18,730 --> 02:11:21,240
这是不是你回来的原因？
Is that why you came back?

1508
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,780
我很高兴你找到了
And have you found it...

1509
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:28,950
玛丽亚？
...Maria?

1510
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:32,710
我想我找到了
I think I have.

1511
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:36,840
我知道我已找到了
I know I have.

1512
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:41,050
我爱你
I love you.

1513
02:11:45,010 --> 02:11:47,510
这是真的吗？

希特勒万岁 午安 赫尔吉勒
-Heil Hitler. -Oh, Good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1557
02:20:06,210 --> 02:20:09,510
或许你还不知道 我现在是这里的监督
Perhaps you've not heard. I am now the Gauleiter.

1558
02:20:09,760 --> 02:20:11,340
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1560
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:15,970
我刚从范崔普家来
I've come from Captain von Trapp's house.

1561
02:20:16,430 --> 02:20:20,020
自从两国合并之后
The only one in the area not flying the Third Reich flag...

1562
02:20:20,270 --> 02:20:21,480
只有他家不挂德国旗
...since the Anschluss.

1563
02:20:21,730 --> 02:20:23,900
-但是我们必须解决那问题 -我不知道...
-But we have dealt with that. -I don't--

1564
02:20:24,150 --> 02:20:27,110
管家告诉我会在这找到你
The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.

这是那个女人 唯一留给我的情报
The only thing she'd tell me.

你在找什么情报？
What kind of information are you looking for?

1567
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:34,240
我们要知道舰长何时会回来？
When will the captain return?

1568
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:38,700
他去渡蜜月了 他没和我们联络
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip. He's not been in touch with us.

1569
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:43,790
你要我相信舰长一个多月 没和他的孩子们联络
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated with his children in over a month?

1570
02:20:44,040 --> 02:20:45,960
监督 你知道会有多少人
How many men do you know...

1571
02:20:46,210 --> 02:20:49,500
他们在渡蜜月时 和他们的孩子联络？
...who communicate with their children while honeymooning?

1572
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:54,130
当他回来时 我们希望他接受新政府的职位
Upon his return, he'll fill his proper position in the new order.

1573
02:20:54,390 --> 02:20:56,800
当然了...我可以向你恭禧
Naturally. and may I congratulate you...

1574
02:20:57,050 --> 02:21:01,680
你的人们决定允许今晚 我们可以举行音乐节庆
...and your people in allowing the festival to go on tonight as planned.

1575
02:21:02,230 --> 02:21:05,690
为何他们会不允准？ 奥国什么都没改变
Why should it not go on? Nothing in Austria has changed.

1576
02:21:05,940 --> 02:21:09,320
唱歌和音乐可宣告世界
Singing and music will show this to the world.

1577
02:21:09,530 --> 02:21:11,190
奥国依然如昔
Austria is the same.

1578
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:13,490
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1579
02:21:15,660 --> 02:21:17,240
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

1580
02:21:18,910 --> 02:21:20,160
走吧 孩子们 我们回家去
Come, let's go home.

1581
02:21:20,370 --> 02:21:23,870
-为何他这么凶？ -达令 这些日子大家都很凶
-Why was he so cross? -Everybody's cross these days.

1582
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:27,760
也许是旗上的黑蜘蛛 使人们紧张起来
Maybe the flag with the black spider makes people nervous.

1583
02:21:27,800 --> 02:21:30,590
-爸爸是不是有麻烦了？ -他不会的
-Will father be in trouble? -He doesn't have to be.

1584
02:21:30,840 --> 02:21:33,550
这些日子来最重要的是 和大家和睦相处
The thing to do is to get along with everybody.

1585
02:21:33,800 --> 02:21:36,010
我要你们记住 尤其在今晚的演唱会上
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1586
02:21:36,220 --> 02:21:39,140
今晚我们真的要 在一大堆人面前唱歌？
Are we really going to sing before a lot of people?

1587
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:41,430
当然 看范崔普家庭音乐 这上面是名字
Look. the von Trapp Family Singers:

1588
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:46,230
莉莎、费瑞克、露易莎、碧姬塔 寇特、玛塔、葛特儿
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta, Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1589
02:21:46,440 --> 02:21:50,820
-为什么我总是排在最后？ -因为你是最重要的
-Why am I always last? -Because you are the most important.

1590
02:21:51,530 --> 02:21:53,110
我们走吧
There we go.

1591
02:21:59,030 --> 02:22:02,490
麦伯伯 你确定爸爸 会准许我们公开演唱
Are you sure father will approve of our singing in public?

1592
02:22:02,700 --> 02:22:05,000
他会很高兴而引以为傲的
He'll be pleased and proud.

1593
02:22:05,460 --> 02:22:07,920
-莉莎 你觉得如此吗？ -你们不信任我吗？
-Liesl, do you think so? -Don't you trust me?

1594
02:22:08,130 --> 02:22:09,170
不信任
No.

1595
02:22:09,380 --> 02:22:11,460
你们是很聪明的女孩
You're a very intelligent girl.

1596
02:22:11,960 --> 02:22:14,170
莉莎...
Liesl. Liesl!

1597
02:22:15,090 --> 02:22:16,300
劳夫
Rolf!

1598
02:22:17,300 --> 02:22:19,300
劳夫 很高兴见到你 已经...
I'm so glad to see you. It's been su--

1599
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:20,640
午安
Good afternoon.

1600
02:22:21,050 --> 02:22:23,970
请你把这电报交给你爸爸
Give this to your father as soon as he's home.

1601
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:26,520
-他正在渡蜜月呢 -我知道
-He's on his honeymoon. -I know.

1602
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:30,060
-你知道？ -做这行的 样样都要知道
-you do? -We make It our business to know all.

1603
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:33,360
-谁是我们？ -他看电报就知道
-Who's "we"? -See that he gets it.

1604
02:22:33,570 --> 02:22:35,860
-这是什么？ -是从柏林来的电报
-What is it? -It's a telegram from Berlin.

1605
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:39,240
你今晚不要来亲自交给他吗？
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1606
02:22:39,700 --> 02:22:42,320
我今晚有更重要的事
I'm occupied with more important matters.

1607
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:45,040
你爸爸如果知轻重 最好合作点
And your father had better be too.

1608
02:22:45,240 --> 02:22:46,790
但是 劳夫...
But, Rolf!

1609
02:23:09,890 --> 02:23:11,560
爸爸...
Father!

1610
02:23:11,810 --> 02:23:14,480
-我们没想到你们这么早回来 -哈啰！哈啰！
-We didn't expect you so soon. -Hello, hello!

1611
02:23:14,730 --> 02:23:17,530
我们不知道你这么早就会回来
We didn't expect you home until next week!

1612
02:23:17,740 --> 02:23:23,160
-有带东西给我们吗？ -哈啰 你好吗？
-Did you bring souvenirs from Paris? -Hello!How are you?

1613
02:23:24,280 --> 02:23:25,580
你们为什么没有打电报给我们？
Why didn't you call us?

1614
02:23:25,780 --> 02:23:27,700
我们试过了 但是不通
We couldn't get through.

1615
02:23:27,950 --> 02:23:29,910
国旗和我没有关系
I had nothing to do with that.

1616
02:23:30,160 --> 02:23:32,210
我们已经尽量赶回来了
We came back as fast as we could.

1617
02:23:32,540 --> 02:23:34,710
我们很想念你们
Well, well, well! we missed you!

1618
02:23:34,960 --> 02:23:37,380
-我们很想你们 -我们也很想你们
-We missed you! -We missed kissing you.

1619
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:40,420
我们想念你们早上的噪音
We missed all the noise in the morning.

1620
02:23:40,670 --> 02:23:44,890
-最想念的是你们 -你们回来得正巧
-Mostly, we missed hearing you sing. -Oh, you came back just in time.

1621
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:46,810
看这个 玛丽亚
Look, Fraülein Maria--

1622
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:48,640
我是说妈妈
I mean Mother.

1623
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:51,600
我们今晚要去音乐会
We're going to sing in the festival tonight.

1624
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:53,900
我们度过了很美好的时光喔
We've been having a lovely time!

1625
02:23:54,150 --> 02:23:56,230
我们练习了一天
We've been rehearsing all--

1626
02:23:57,770 --> 02:24:00,110
惊喜 惊喜
Surprise! Surprise!

1627
02:24:00,780 --> 02:24:03,240
好了 里面有令你们惊喜的东西
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1628
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:07,660
我们到里面去谈这个
We'll talk about this.

1629
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:12,200
盖尔 我本想要告诉你 但是你不在 我只有自作主张了
I would've told you but you were away. I had to make a last-minute decision.

1630
02:24:12,500 --> 02:24:14,960
我运气好 能让他们参加
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1631
02:24:15,210 --> 02:24:19,920
他们会成为话题的 试想一个家庭中的蒳个小孩
They'll be the talk of the festival. Imagine, seven children in one family!

1632
02:24:20,130 --> 02:24:21,800
麦斯！
Max!

1633
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,220
我记得我以前 就对我家中小孩
Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you...

1634
02:24:25,470 --> 02:24:28,180
在外面演唱的事说得很清楚
...how I feel about my family singing in public!

1635
02:24:28,430 --> 02:24:30,140
但是委员会听过他们唱 非常的感动
The committee was enchanted.

1636
02:24:30,350 --> 02:24:33,520
-他们说了什么？ -“从没听过这样热情澎湃的歌声”
-What Did They say? -I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1637
02:24:33,770 --> 02:24:38,060
-达令 就一次好不好？ -绝对不可能
-Don't you think just this once--? -Absolutely out of the question.

1638
02:24:38,310 --> 02:24:42,440
-盖尔 这是为了奥国 -奥国？
-Georg, this is for Austria. -for Austria?

1639
02:24:42,820 --> 02:24:46,030
-已经没有奥国 -但是德奥合并会很和平的
-There is no Austria! -But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1640
02:24:46,280 --> 02:24:49,780
-这是很好的 -很好？！
-Let's at least be grateful for that. -Grateful?

1641
02:24:51,660 --> 02:24:53,290
你知道吗？麦斯
You know, Max...

1642
02:24:54,210 --> 02:24:57,420
有时候我不知道是否了解你
...sometimes I don't believe I know you.

1643
02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:01,500
爸爸 我忘了
Father, I forgot.

1644
02:25:02,340 --> 02:25:03,920
这是给你的
This is for you.

1645
02:25:13,720 --> 02:25:17,730
玛丽亚 至少他必须假装 和这些人合作
Maria, he has got to at least pretend to work with these people.

1646
02:25:17,980 --> 02:25:19,480
你必须说服他
You must convince him.

1647
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:22,480
我不能要求他听我的话
Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.

1648
02:25:22,690 --> 02:25:26,030
那么我和他谈 如果孩子们不在节庆上唱歌...
Then I'll talk to him. If the children don't sing, well...

1649
02:25:26,280 --> 02:25:28,530
对奥国会有影响的
...it will be a reflection on Austria.

1650
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:32,700
对我也没有好处
Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.

1651
02:25:37,870 --> 02:25:40,540
妈 这听起来真好
Mother? that sounds so nice.

1652
02:25:40,790 --> 02:25:43,550
-我喜欢叫你妈 -我喜欢听你叫
-I like calling you "Mother." -I like hearing it.

1653
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:47,420
你很爱爸爸 我看得出来
You love father very much. I can tell you do.

1654
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:48,470
非常爱他
Very much.

1655
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:52,050
妈 当你懧为你爱某个人时 你要怎么办？
Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone?

1656
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:58,020
我是说当你不再爱某人 或者说他不再爱你时...
I mean, when you stop loving someone or he stops loving you?

1657
02:26:00,650 --> 02:26:02,730
你会哭一场
Well, you cry a little.

1658
02:26:03,150 --> 02:26:05,280
等待太阳出来
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1659
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:06,900
每次都可以这样的
It always does.

1660
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:10,700
有许多事情我懧为我应该知道 但我却不知道
There are so many things I think I should know but I don't.

1661
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:12,910
-真的不知道 -怎么说？
-I really don't. -How can you?

1662
02:26:13,160 --> 02:26:15,370
有时我觉得世界末日近了
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1663
02:26:15,620 --> 02:26:18,790
-你觉得这刚开始 -是的
-Then you feel it's just beginning? -Yes!

1664
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,290
我以前也这么觉得 对你 一切会很好的
It was that way with me. and for you it will be just as wonderful.

1665
02:26:23,960 --> 02:26:25,840
你真的懧为如此？

莉莎
Liesl.

1688
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:26,410
什么事情？
What is it?

1689
02:28:27,330 --> 02:28:28,710
柏林
Berlin.

1690
02:28:29,170 --> 02:28:31,040
柏林派我一个海军的官
They've offered me a commission.

1691
02:28:31,290 --> 02:28:33,840
他们要求我马上上任
I've been requested to accept immediately...

1692
02:28:34,090 --> 02:28:38,090
明天到柏林里麦基地报到
...and report to their naval base at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1693
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:42,680
我就知道这种事会发生 没料到这么快
I knew this would happen. I didn't think it would be so soon.

1694
02:28:42,890 --> 02:28:46,430
拒绝的话 全家性命不保
To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.

1695
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:51,440
参加了 会更难想像
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1696
02:28:57,570 --> 02:28:59,360
叫小孩们都过来
Get the children all together.

1697
02:28:59,660 --> 02:29:02,910
什么都不要说 让他们打包好行囊
Don't say anything to worry them. just get them ready.

1698
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:06,250
我们必须离开奥国
We've got to get out of Austria...

1699
02:29:07,870 --> 02:29:09,580
还有这个房子
...and this house...

1700
02:29:11,920 --> 02:29:13,340
今晚
...tonight.

1701
02:29:57,250 --> 02:29:59,670
今晚你们不唱了
This strains my back and breaks my heart...

1702
02:29:59,920 --> 02:30:02,760
真是让我伤心难过
...when I think of the children missing the festival.

1703
02:30:03,010 --> 02:30:05,720
你宣布的时候 我们就越过边界了
By your announcement we'll be over the border.

1704
02:30:05,970 --> 02:30:08,390
我希望你会感激我所做的牺牲
Do you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making?

1705
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:09,890
你没有选择
You have no choice.

1706
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:12,980
我知道 这是为何我这样做
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1707
02:30:13,650 --> 02:30:15,810
爸爸为何不发动引擎
Why doesn't father turn the motor on?

1708
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:19,440
因为他不要任何人听到
Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us.

1709
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:25,530
管家们会说什么？
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1710
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:29,290
他们可以老实回答 有人问他们时 他们什么都不知道
They'll be able to answer honestly they didn't know anything.

1711
02:30:29,540 --> 02:30:33,750
-我们会再回来吗？ -莉莎 我希望会有这一天的
-will we be coming back here? -Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1712
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:38,920
爸爸和麦伯伯 要一直推车到瑞士吗？
Are father and Uncle Max going to push the car all the way to Switzerland?

1713
02:31:05,700 --> 02:31:08,120
舰长 你的车是不是有毛病？
Something wrong with your car, captain?

1714
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:10,740
是的 事实上 车子无法启动
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1715
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:15,750
卡尔
Karl.

1716
02:31:17,710 --> 02:31:21,170
替舰长把车修好好让其启动
Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.

1717
02:31:44,360 --> 02:31:46,200
很好的车啊
Excellent, Karl.

1718
02:31:49,570 --> 02:31:52,700
我没问你和你的家人要到哪？
I've not asked you where you and your family are going.

1719
02:31:53,240 --> 02:31:55,370
你也没问我 我为何在这？
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1720
02:31:55,580 --> 02:31:59,330
我想我们两个都没什么好奇心
Apparently we both suffer from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1721
02:32:00,210 --> 02:32:02,670
你接到柏林来的电报 你并没有回覆
You never answered the telegram...

1722
02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:06,210
这封电报叫你去海军基地报到
...from the Admiral of the Navy of the Third Reich.

1723
02:32:06,470 --> 02:32:08,930
电报的内容
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller...

1724
02:32:09,130 --> 02:32:12,680
是不可以让任何人窥看
...that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!

1725
02:32:13,390 --> 02:32:16,930
至少在奥国是这样
At least, the Austria I know.

1726
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:19,690
我奉命
I have my orders...

1727
02:32:19,940 --> 02:32:22,110
今晚带你去基地
...to take you to Bremerhaven tonight...

1728
02:32:22,360 --> 02:32:24,570
接受你的职务
...where you will accept your commission.

1729
02:32:25,690 --> 02:32:31,110
恐怕恕难从命
I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.

1730
02:32:31,740 --> 02:32:33,450
你知道...
You see, we...

1731
02:32:34,030 --> 02:32:36,870
我们全部的家庭
...all of us, the entire family, will be...

1732
02:32:37,950 --> 02:32:40,000
今晚要在音乐会上演唱
...singing in the festival tonight.

1733
02:32:40,290 --> 02:32:42,710
事实上 这就是我们要出去的原因
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1734
02:32:43,380 --> 02:32:46,250
不可能现在让他们失望
We couldn't possibly let them down now.

1735
02:32:46,460 --> 02:32:49,420
-我希望我们不会迟到 -是的
-I just hope we're not too late. -Yes.

1736
02:32:49,670 --> 02:32:52,550
你要我相信你堂堂一位舰长
You ask me to believe that you, Captain von Trapp...

1737
02:32:52,800 --> 02:32:54,260
要去演唱会唱歌
...are singing in a concert?

1738
02:32:54,680 --> 02:32:58,810
相信我 这会是最棒的表演
Believe me, it will be a performance beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1739
02:32:59,140 --> 02:33:03,810
吉勒 像你一样 我们两个都是身怀绝技的
Like you, Herr Zeller, l, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1740
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:05,860
是的
Yes.

1741
02:33:06,110 --> 02:33:08,570
这是节目单
Here, program.

1742
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:15,910
上面只有孩子的名字
It says only the names of the children.

1743
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:19,450
上面说范崔普家演唱
It says the von Trapp Family Singers...

1744
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:22,750
而我是范崔普家的家长 不是吗？
...and I am the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?

1745
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:28,840
穿着这些旅行装？
And these travel clothes that you're all wearing?

1746
02:33:29,670 --> 02:33:31,220
是我们的习惯
Our costumes, naturally.

1747
02:33:31,470 --> 02:33:34,840
今晚天气不好 穿礼服会对孩子的嗓子有影响
This night air is not good for the children's voices.

1748
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:44,650
稍微延迟执行命令并不严重
Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.

1749
02:33:45,860 --> 02:33:47,360
好吧
Therefore...

1750
02:33:48,230 --> 02:33:49,860
你们去唱吧
...you will sing.

1751
02:33:50,780 --> 02:33:52,780
你们全部都要唱
You will all sing.

1752
02:33:53,150 --> 02:33:55,700
这只是我希望
But only because that's what I want.

1753
02:33:56,570 --> 02:34:00,080
这表示奥国一切未改
It will demonstrate that nothing in Austria has changed.

1754
02:34:00,790 --> 02:34:03,000
你们唱完后
And when you have finished singing...

1755
02:34:03,290 --> 02:34:06,460
你们的舰长就要跟我走
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.

1756
02:34:07,750 --> 02:34:10,500
现在 你们上车吧
Now, if you will all get into your car...

1757
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:14,510
我们要护送 范崔普家的歌手去演唱会
...we will escort the von Trapp Family Singers to the festival.

1758
02:34:15,380 --> 02:34:17,590
吉勒 用不着护送
No escort will be necessary.

1759
02:34:17,850 --> 02:34:20,310
舰长 我们乐意如此
Necessary? a pleasure, captain.

1760
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:25,100
而且我们不希望你们迷了路
After all, we would not want you to get lost in the crowds.

1761
02:34:26,310 --> 02:34:27,810
是吗？
Would we?

1762
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,650
是的
No.

1807

我们唱歌会有帮助吗？
Would it help if we sang about our favorite things?

1879
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:56,180
不 达令 这是帮不上忙的一次
No, darling. This is one time it would not help.

1880
02:46:56,430 --> 02:46:59,640
你必须很安静 紧抱着我
You must be very quiet. Hold tight to me.

1881
02:49:14,270 --> 02:49:15,480

我们要的只是你
It's you we want, not them.

1887

不准动 否则我就开枪
Not another move, or I'll shoot.

你只是个孩子
You're only a boy.

1890
02:50:54,580 --> 02:50:58,250
-你并不是他们的人 -站在原地

我会杀了你
I'll kill you.

1896
02:51:17,430 --> 02:51:18,890

Rolf.
