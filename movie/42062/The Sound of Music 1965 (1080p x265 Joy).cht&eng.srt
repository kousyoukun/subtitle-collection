1
00:00:01,011 --> 00:00:21,011
【音樂之聲】
The Sound of Music - 1965

2
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,742
群山因為音樂…
The hills are alive

3
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,418
充滿生氣
With the sound of music

4
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,121
唱了…
With songs they have sung

5
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:59,258
千年的歌
For a thousand years

6
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:02,691
群山讓我的心中…
The hills fill my heart

7
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:07,459
充滿了音樂
With the sound of music

8
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:14,904
要唱出每支歌
My heart wants to sing Every song it hears

9
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,279
我心震盪像鳥兒翅膀
My heart wants to beat like the wings Of the birds that rise

10
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,609
由湖邊飛上樹
From the lake to the trees

11
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,119
我心歎息
My heart wants to sigh Like a chime that flies

12
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,326
像鐘聲飄揚
From a church on a breeze

13
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:36,086
笑聲像小溪流過石頭
To laugh like a brook When it trips and falls

14
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,823
跌盪抑揚
Over stones on its way

15
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:43,970
夜晚歌唱
To sing through the night

16
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,005
像雲雀祈禱
Like a lark who is learning to pray

17
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:53,975
當我奔向山裡
I go to the hills

18
00:03:54,182 --> 00:04:00,348
心情落寞
When my heart is lonely

19
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,490
我聽到…
I know I will hear

20
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:09,187
昔日歌聲
What I've heard before

21
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,197
我心就會歌唱
My heart will be blessed

22
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:22,207
因為音樂的響起
With the sound of music

23
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:28,443
我要再度…
And I'll sing...

24
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:37,615
歌唱
...once more

25
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:24,634
哈利路亞，哈利路亞
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:29,577
哈利路亞，哈利路亞
Hallelujah, hallelujah

27
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,845
-院長 -柏尼絲修女
- Reverend Mother. - Sister Bernice.

28
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,717
-我找不到她 -?莉亞？
- I simply cannot find her. - Maria?

29
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,089
她又不見了
She's missing again.

30
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,394
也許我們該在她脖子上 掛個牛鈴
We should've put a cowbell around her neck.

31
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,691
你找過倉了嗎？ 她很喜歡動物
Have you tried the barn? You know how much she adores the animals.

32
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,697
我到處都找過了
I have looked everywhere. In all of the usual places.

33
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:51,133
修女，你要知道她是瑪莉亞…
Sister, considering it's Maria...

34
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:54,033
我建議你找不尋常的地方
...I suggest you look in someplace unusual.

35
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,611
院長…
Well, Reverend Mother...

36
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,442
我希望這次違規 會結束
...I hope this new infraction ends whatever doubts...

37
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,949
你對她在這裡 會有未來的疑慮
...you may still have about Maria's future here.

38
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:11,216
我對疑慮仍常保持信心
I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

39
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,326
畢竟黑羊的毛也是會溫暖
After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.

40
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:18,896
我們不是爭論綿羊顏色
We are not talking about sheep, black or white, Sister Margaretta.

41
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:22,570
所有修女的候選人中她最糟
Of all the candidates for the novitiate, Maria is the least...

42
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,328
各位…
Children, children.

43
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:29,766
我們想瞭解在修道院的各人 表現如何
We were speculating about the qualifications of our postulants.

44
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,404
見習修女和修道院修女的主管
The Mistress of Novices and the Mistress of Postulants...

45
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:38,950
表達了不同的意見來協助我
...were trying to help me by expressing opposite points of view.

46
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:42,247
凱薩琳修女，告訴我 你認為?莉亞如何？
Tell me, Sister Catherine, what do you think of Maria?

47
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,517
她有時候是個好女孩
She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.

48
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,588
-雅嘉佛修女？ -?莉亞討人喜歡
- Sister Agatha? - It's very easy to like Maria...

49
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,356
但有時候卻不易相處
...except when it's difficult.

50
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:56,228
-蘇菲亞修女，你呢？ -我喜歡她
- And you, Sister Sophia? - Oh, I love her very dearly.

51
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,373
但她愛惹麻煩
But she always seems to be in trouble, doesn't she?

52
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,199
這就是我要說的
Exactly what I say.

53
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:04,144
她會爬樹傷了膝蓋
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

54
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,041
衣服裂開
Her dress has got a tear

55
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:10,879
在往彌撒的路上跳華爾滋 在階梯上吹口哨
She waltzes on her way to Mass And whistles on the stair

56
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,013
帽巾下，頭髮會卷著發卷
And underneath her wimple She has curlers in her hair

57
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,887
她會在修道院內唱歌
I've even heard her singing In the abbey

58
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,120
她上教堂總是遲到
She's always late for chapel

59
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,629
可是悔卻出自真心
But her penitence is real

60
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,232
她做什麼都遲到
She's always late for everything

61
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,495
但每餐飯從不遲到
Except for every meal

62
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:35,571
我不願說，但我深深覺得
I hate to have to say it But I very firmly feel

63
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,247
?莉亞不適合修道院
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

64
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,240
我願為她說句好話
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

65
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,849
請說，?格麗特修女
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

66
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,679
?莉亞令我發笑
Maria makes me laugh

67
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,496
你要如何處理 像?莉亞這樣的問題人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

68
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:00,565
你要如何摘下浮雲 然後釘牢？
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

69
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,202
你要如何用言語形容她？
How do you find a word That means Maria?

70
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:05,831
搗蛋鬼！
A flibbertigibbet

71
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:07,405
-鬼靈精 -小丑
- A will-o'-the-wisp - A clown

72
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,774
許多事你們想告訴她
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

73
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:16,505
許多事她該明瞭
Many a thing she ought to understand

74
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:20,615
但如何使她停下聽你說完？
But how do you make her stay And listen to all you say?

75
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,681
如何使海浪停留在沙灘上？
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

76
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:29,022
你要如何處理 像?莉亞這樣的問題人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

77
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:35,060
如何使月光在…
How do you hold a moonbeam...

78
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,731
掌中停留？
...in your hand?

79
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,302
當我和她同處就糊塗
When I'm with her I'm confused Out of focus and bemused

80
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:49,049
茫然不知身在何處
And I never know exactly where I am

81
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,583
-如天氣難測 -像羽毛飄忽
- Unpredictable as weather - She's as flighty as a feather

82
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,785
-她很可人 -她是惡魔
- She's a darling - She's a demon

83
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,320
她是羔羊
She's a lamb

84
00:12:56,724 --> 00:13:00,387
她讓瘟神煩惱，把黃蜂趕出巢
She'll out pester any pest Drive a hornet from its nest

85
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:03,894
她能使僧侶昏頭轉向
She can throw a whirling dervish Out of whirl

86
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,993
-她本性善良卻又狂野 -她是迷一般的孩子
- She is gentle, she is wild - She's a riddle, she's a child

87
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,130
-她令人頭痛 -她是天使
- She's a headache - She's an angel

88
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,241
她只是個女孩
She's a girl

89
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:19,913
你要如何處理 像?莉亞這樣的問題人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

90
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:23,845
你要如何摘下浮雲 然後釘牢？
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

91
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:27,644
你要如何用字眼來形容她？
How do you find a word That means Maria?

92
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,913
-搗蛋鬼 -鬼靈精
- A flibbertigibbet - A will-o'-the-wisp

93
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,785
小丑
A clown

94
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,991
許多事你覺得要告訴她
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

95
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,756
許多事她應該明瞭
Many a thing she ought to understand

96
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:44,302
-但如何使她停下 -聽你說完？
- But how do you make her stay - And listen to all you say?

97
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,635
如何使海浪停留在沙灘上？
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

98
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:54,679
你要如何處理 像?莉亞這樣的問題人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

99
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:17,401
如何使月光在…
How do you hold a moonbeam...

100
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:24,711
掌中停留？
...in your hand?

101
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,515
你可以進去了，?莉亞
You may go in now, Maria.

102
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,732
過來吧，孩子
Come here, my child.

103
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,612
坐下吧
Now sit down.

104
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:05,110
院長，我真抱歉 我只是無法自製
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.

105
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:08,355
-山巒在呼喚我… -親愛的
- The hills were beckoning and before... - Dear.

106
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,724
我不是要你來此道歉的
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

107
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,189
請讓我懺悔吧
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

108
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,089
如果會讓你好過些的話
If you'll feel better.

109
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,396
是的，今日的天空如此蔚藍
Yes, you see, the sky was so blue today...

110
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:22,433
萬物如此碧綠芬芳 我必須成為其中一份子
...and everything was so green and fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

111
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:27,198
安特斯讓我愈爬愈高 好像要我跟它穿過雲霄
The Untersberg led me higher like it wanted me to go through the clouds.

112
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:29,433
萬一你在天黑時 迷路怎麼辦？
Suppose darkness had come and you were lost?

113
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,941
院長，我絕對不會迷路的
Mother, I could never be lost up there.

114
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:35,046
那是我的山，我在那兒長大的
That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.

115
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,547
就是那座山使我來找你的
It was the mountain that led me to you.

116
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,288
小時我常爬山
When I was a child, I would come down and climb a tree...

117
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,319
眺望你的花園
...and look in your garden.

118
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:46,493
看著修女們工作 聽著她們晚禱的歌詠
I'd see the sisters at work and hear them sing.

119
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,458
院長，我今天違反規定
Which brings me to another transgression, Reverend Mother.

120
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,827
未得准許唱歌
I was singing out there today.

121
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:58,529
在修道院只禁止見習修女唱歌
Only in the abbey do we have rules about postulants singing.

122
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,765
不論在何處 我似乎都無法停止唱歌
I can't stop wherever I am.

123
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,307
更糟的是 我似乎也無法停止說話
Worse, I can't seem to stop saying things.

124
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,842
所有我想的和我的感覺
Everything I think and feel.

125
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,513
有人會認為這是誠實
Some call that "honesty."

126
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:10,148
但這是很糟糕的，院長
Oh, but it's terrible, Reverend Mother!

127
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:14,253
你知道貝詩修女總在爭論之後 要我吻地板
You know how Sister Berthe makes me kiss the floor after a disagreement?

128
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:18,114
所以現在我看到她來就吻地板 以節省時間
Lately, I kiss the floor when I see her coming to save time.

129
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:21,955
?莉亞
Maria...

130
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:25,956
當你看到修道院的一切時 想要成為一員
...when you saw us over the wall and longed to be with us...

131
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,933
那並不表示你已經準備好 要過這種生活方式，對不對？
...that didn't mean you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?

132
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,673
不，院長 但我禱告，我努力嘗試
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

133
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,605
我也在學習，我真的要做好
And I am learning. I really am.

134
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:39,506
你在這裡學到了 最重要的事是什麼？
What is the most important lesson you have learned here?

135
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,981
找出上帝的旨意 全心全意地侍奉主
To find out what is the will of God and do it wholeheartedly.

136
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:47,947
?莉亞
Maria...

137
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,221
似乎是上帝的意旨 你要離開我們
...it seems to be God's will that you leave us.

138
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:53,983
-離開？ -只是短暫的時間而已
- Leave? - Only for a while.

139
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,827
不，院長，別送我走
No, Mother! Please don't send me away!

140
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:01,331
這裡是我的家，我的家庭 我的生命
This is where I belong. It's my home, my family. It's my life.

141
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:05,029
-你真預備獻身上帝？ -我是的
- Are you truly ready for it? - Yes, I am.

142
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:10,142
或許如果你到外面去看看 就明白我們對你的期望
If you go out into the world for a time, knowing what we expect of you...

143
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,141
你就有機會找出 你對你自己的期望
...you will find out if you can expect it of yourself.

144
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:17,647
我知道你期望什麼，院長 我相信我可以做得到
I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it! I promise I can!

145
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,417
是的，院長
Yes, Mother.

146
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,186
如果是上帝的旨意
If it is God's will.

147
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,560
薩爾斯堡有個家庭 需要家庭教師一直到九月
There is a family near Salzburg that needs a governess until September.

148
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,998
-到九月？ -照料七個孩子
- September? - For seven children.

149
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,660
七個孩子？！
Seven children?!

150
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,167
你喜歡孩子嗎？
Do you like children?

151
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,772
是的，但七個…
Well, yes, but seven!

152
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,073
我會告訴范崔普艦長 你明天去
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.

153
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,013
艦長？
Captain?

154
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:53,551
他是皇家海軍的退役軍官 人很好又很勇敢
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

155
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:56,518
他太太數年前去世 留下那些孩子給他
His wife died, and he is alone with the children.

156
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:01,024
我明白他要留住那些家庭教師 會有些困難
I understand he has had a difficult time keeping a governess there.

157
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,094
為何會有困難，院長？
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

158
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:08,401
在適當的時機 上帝會讓你明白的
The Lord will show you in His own good time.

159
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:47,741
當主關上門時
When the Lord closes a door...

160
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:50,467
他會在某處打開窗子的
...somewhere He opens a window.

161
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:57,808
這天會是如何？
What will this day be like?

162
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,249
我懷疑
I wonder

163
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,857
我的未來呢？
What will my future be?

164
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,963
我懷疑
I wonder

165
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,630
外邊的自由逍遙世界
It could be so exciting

166
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,934
應該令人興奮
To be out in the world To be free

167
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:25,203
我的心該狂歡愉悅
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

168
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,716
我到底是怎麼回事？
Oh, what's the matter with me?

169
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:35,113
我一向渴望著冒險
I've always longed for adventure

170
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,950
做我不敢做的事
To do the things I've never dared

171
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:42,390
現在我面對著冒險
Now here I'm facing adventure

172
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:48,795
為何我如此害怕？
Then why am I so scared?

173
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,141
一位艦長和七位孩子
A captain with seven children

174
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:58,209
有何可怕？
What's so fearsome about that?

175
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,376
我必須停止多疑和憂慮
I must stop these doubts and worries

176
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,484
不然，我會回到原點
If I don't I just know I'll turn back

177
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,917
我必須夢想我所追求的事物
I must dream of the things I am seeking

178
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:15,986
我在追求我所欠缺的勇氣
I am seeking the courage I lack

179
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:20,732
有勇氣信賴他們
The courage to serve them With reliance

180
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,903
虛心面對我的錯誤
Face my mistakes without defiance

181
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,866
讓他們知道我的好處
Show them I'm worthy

182
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,769
同時也讓自己看見
And while I show them

183
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,843
自己的好處
I'll show me

184
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,451
讓他們提出他們的問題
So let them bring on All their problems

185
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,951
我會做得比最好還要更好
I'll do better than my best

186
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:45,283
我有信心，讓他們來考驗我吧
I have confidence They'll put me to the test

187
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,962
我會讓他們明白，我充滿信心
But I'll make them see I have confidence in me

188
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:52,461
我要使他們印象深刻
Somehow I will impress them

189
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,964
我會堅決而和善
I will be firm but kind

190
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,536
上蒼祝福那些孩子們
And all those children Heaven bless them

191
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:03,073
他們會以我為榜樣，聽我的話
They will look up to me And mind me

192
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,439
每走一步，我更確信
With each step I am more certain

193
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:09,979
一切事情都會好轉
Everything will turn out fine

194
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:13,311
我有信心世界會由我掌握
I have confidence The world can all be mine

195
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:18,992
因為我對自己有信心
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me

196
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,291
我對陽光有信心
I have confidence in sunshine

197
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:26,658
我對雨水有信心
I have confidence in rain

198
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,768
我深信春天會再來
I have confidence That spring will come again

199
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,097
我對自己更有信心
Besides which you see I have confidence in me

200
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:36,467
力量不存在於數字裡
Strength doesn't lie in numbers

201
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,770
力量不存在于財富中
Strength doesn't lie in wealth

202
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:43,347
力量存在於靜夜的酣睡中
Strength lies in nights Of peaceful slumbers

203
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,484
當你醒來就充滿精神
When you wake up, wake up It's healthy

204
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:49,779
我信任心中的指引
All I trust I leave my heart to

205
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:52,925
就會成為我的
All I trust becomes my own

206
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:57,928
我對信心更有信心
I have confidence in confidence alone

207
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,173
救命
Oh, help.

208
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,027
我對信心更有信心
I have confidence in confidence alone

209
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:38,635
況且，你看，我對自己…
Besides which you see I have confidence...

210
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:45,709
充滿信心！
...in me

211
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,653
你好，我來了
Hello. Here I am.

212
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,322
我從修道院來的 我是新的家教，艦長
I'm from the convent. I'm the new governess, captain.

213
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:04,226
而我是老管家，小姐
And I'm the old butler, fraulein.

214
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,997
你好
Well, how do you do?

215
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:22,573
請你在此稍候
You'll wait here, please.

216
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:53,032
以後請記住 這裡有些房間是不能亂闖的
In future, remember certain rooms in this house are not to be disturbed.

217
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,675
是的，艦長，先生
Yes, captain, sir.

218
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:08,850
-你為何如此看著我？ -你看起來一點都不像海上的艦長
- Why do you stare at me that way? - You don't look like a sea captain.

219
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:13,117
我也認為 你一點都不像個家庭教師
I'm afraid you don't look very much like a governess.

220
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:14,885
-請轉身 -什麼？
- Turn around. - What?

221
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,491
轉身
Turn.

222
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,827
拿下帽子
Hat off.

223
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,666
你和孩子見面前 最好先換衣服
Put on another dress before meeting the children.

224
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,532
但我沒有衣服換了
But I don't have another.

225
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,676
我進入修道院時 將所有衣服送給窮人了
When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes go to the poor.

226
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,174
這一件呢？
What about this one?

227
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,711
窮人不要這一件
The poor didn't want it.

228
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,042
我本想為自己做新衣服的 但時間不夠，我會自己做衣服
There wasn't time to make a new dress. I can make clothes.

229
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:43,586
我會確定你有一些布料的
I'll see that you get some material.

230
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,849
今天，如果可能的話
Today, if possible.

231
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,590
-現在…小姐 -瑪莉亞
- Now, fraulein... - Maria.

232
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,559
我不知道院長告訴了你多少
I don't know how much the abbess told you.

233
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,392
在許多家教中你是第12位了
You are the twelfth governess...

234
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,070
自從他們的母親去世後 來此照料他們
...to look after my children since their mother died.

235
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,501
我相信你會比上一個更好
I trust you will be an improvement on the last one.

236
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,571
她只停留了兩小時
She stayed only two hours.

237
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:05,871
孩子們有何不對嗎？
What's wrong with the children, sir?

238
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:11,751
孩子們都很正常 是家庭教師的錯
Nothing is wrong with the children, only the governesses.

239
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:16,956
她們完全無法維持紀律 沒有紀律就不能管好這個家
They could not maintain discipline, without which the house cannot be run.

240
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,688
你得督促孩子學習
Drill them in their studies.

241
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:23,419
我不准他們虛度假期
I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays.

242
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,393
下午他們要在庭院操練
Each afternoon, they march, breathing deeply.

243
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,261
還要嚴守就寢時間
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

244
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,436
請問他們何時玩耍？
When do they play?

245
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:33,698
你要看著他們 確定他們循規蹈矩
You will see to it that they conduct themselves with the utmost decorum.

246
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,876
-我要你負責這一切 -是的，先生
- I am placing you in command. - Yes, sir.

247
00:27:57,524 --> 00:27:58,684
現在…
Now...

248
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:02,228
這位是你們的新家教 ?莉亞小姐
...this is your new governess, Fraulein Maria.

249
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,888
當我吹你們的訊號時 你們踏前一步報出名字
Give your name at your signal.

250
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,398
而你要仔細注意那訊號 以便日後召喚他們
Fraulein, listen carefully. Learn their signals so you can call them.

251
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,070
莉莎
Liesl.

252
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,069
費瑞克
Friedrich.

253
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:16,866
露易莎
Louisa.

254
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,406
寇特
Kurt.

255
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:19,703
碧姬塔
Brigitta.

256
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,208
?塔
Marta.

257
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:28,919
葛特兒
Gretl.

258
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,996
現在看看你的耳力如何
Now, let's see how well you listened.

259
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,597
我想我不用哨子的，艦長
I won't need to whistle for them, Reverend Captain.

260
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:43,325
我會叫他們的名字 尤其是有如此美的名字
I mean, I'll use their names. Such lovely names.

261
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,700
小姐，這是座大房子 地方很寬廣
Fraulein, this is a large house. The grounds are extensive.

262
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,704
而我不容許任何人在此喊叫
And I will not have anyone shouting.

263
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,672
請你拿這個，學習使用它
You will take this, please. Learn to use it.

264
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,540
孩子們也會幫你的
The children will help you.

265
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:59,575
我要找你，你會聽到這個訊號
Now, when I want you, this is what you will hear.

266
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:02,251
不，很抱歉，先生
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

267
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,681
我絕不會聽哨子回報的
I could never answer to a whistle.

268
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:07,520
哨子是用來召喚動物的 但絕不是對孩子
Whistles are for animals, not for children.

269
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,854
而且絕對不會是我
And definitely not for me.

270
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,725
這是種很大的侮辱
It would be too humiliating.

271
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:18,733
小姐，你在修道院 也是如此麻煩的嗎？
Fraulein, were you this much trouble at the abbey?

272
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,131
麻煩得多，先生
Oh, much more, sir.

273
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,809
我不知道你的訊號
I don't know your signal.

274
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,916
你可以叫我艦長
You may call me "captain."

275
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,304
稍息
At ease.

276
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:55,665
現在只剩下我們
Now that there's just us...

277
00:29:55,943 --> 00:30:00,107
請再一次告訴我你們的名字 還有你們的年齡
...would you please tell me all your names again and how old you are.

278
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:04,574
我叫莉莎，我16歲 我不需要家教
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old, and I don't need a governess.

279
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,412
莉莎，很高興你告訴我 我們可以做好朋友
I'm glad you told me, Liesl. We'll just be good friends.

280
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:14,357
我叫費瑞克，我14歲 我是朽木
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm impossible.

281
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,322
真的？誰告訴你的，費瑞克？
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

282
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:20,089
約瑟芬小姐，前四任教師
Fraulein Josephine. Four governesses ago.

283
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,001
我叫碧姬塔
I'm Brigitta.

284
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,830
你沒告訴我你多大，露易莎
You didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.

285
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,773
我叫碧姬塔，她叫露易莎
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

286
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:33,775
她13歲，而你很聰明
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

287
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:37,780
我10歲，而我認為你的衣服 是我見過最醜的
I'm 10, and I think your dress is the ugliest one I ever saw.

288
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,746
-碧姬塔，你不該這樣說的 -為何？
- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that. - Why not?

289
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:43,218
-你不認為很醜？ -當然
- Don't you think it's ugly? - Of course.

290
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,186
但赫德小姐才是最醜的
But Fraulein Helga's was ugliest.

291
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,054
我是寇特，11歲，我很任性
I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.

292
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:52,457
-恭喜你！ -什麼是任性？
- Congratulations. - What's "incorrigible"?

293
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:56,567
那表示你希望 被人當作是小男孩
I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.

294
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:02,038
我是?塔，星期二我就7歲了
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be seven on Tuesday.

295
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,674
我愛粉紅色陽傘
I'd like a pink parasol.

296
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:06,402
紛紅色也是我的顏色
Pink's my favorite color too.

297
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:09,975
是的，你是葛特兒
Yes, you're Gretl.

298
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:12,579
而你已經5歲了？
And you're five years old?

299
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,011
天啊，你幾乎快成為淑女了
My, you're practically a lady.

300
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:20,550
現在我要告訴你們一個秘密 我從未當過家庭教師
I have to tell you a secret. I've never been a governess.

301
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:24,759
你一點也不懂如何當家庭教師？
You don't know anything about being a governess?

302
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:26,397
一點也不懂，我需要許多建議
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

303
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:31,895
首先，就是告訴父親 要他少管閒事
The best way to start is to tell Father to mind his own business.

304
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:33,902
你絕對不能準時來用餐
Never come to dinner on time.

305
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:36,405
喝湯也不要太小聲
Never eat your soup quietly.

306
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,170
吃甜點時，要擤鼻子
During dessert, always blow your nose.

307
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:42,211
別聽他們說的話，?莉亞小姐
Don't you believe a word they say, Fraulein Maria.

308
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,783
-為什麼？ -因為我喜歡你
- Oh, why not? - Because I like you.

309
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:48,578
孩子們，出去散步
Children, outside for your walk.

310
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,689
父親的命令，快點
Father's orders. Hurry up.

311
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,188
快…
Quick, quick, quick.

312
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:55,623
?莉亞小姐 我是蒙思蜜德，女管家
Fraulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.

313
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:56,920
你好
How do you do.

314
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,031
我帶你去房間，跟我來
I'll show you to your room. Follow me.

315
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,874
可憐的小東西
Poor little dears.

316
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:29,961
你運氣很好 赫德小姐拿到的是條蛇
You're very lucky. With Fraulein Helga it was a snake.

317
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,141
晚安
Good evening.

318
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,141
-晚安，孩子們 -晚安，?莉亞小姐
- Good evening, children. - Good evening, Fraulein Maria.

319
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:58,984
很獨特的舉止
Enchanting little ritual.

320
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,922
是在修道院學來的嗎？
Something you learned at the abbey?

321
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,462
不
No.

322
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,362
是風濕
Rheumatism.

323
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:21,341
對不起，艦長 我們是否忘了向主禱告？
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?

324
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,525
感謝上帝賜給我們一切
For what we receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.

325
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,994
-阿門 -阿門
- Amen. - Amen.

326
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,467
我要感謝各位
I'd like to thank you all...

327
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:44,660
今天放在我口袋中的珍貴禮物
...for the precious gift you left in my pocket today.

328
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:49,972
是什麼禮物？
What gift?

329
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,241
這是我和孩子們之間的秘密
It's a secret between the children and me.

330
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:59,144
那我建議你就留著 讓我們可以吃飯
Then I suggest you keep it, and let us eat.

331
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,487
我瞭解陌生人在新家庭裡
Knowing how nervous I must have been...

332
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:04,156
會是有多麼緊張
...a stranger in a new household...

333
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:07,417
瞭解能被接受 會是多麼重要的事
...knowing how important it was for me to feel accepted...

334
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:11,892
你們使我感到多麼溫暖
...it was so kind and thoughtful of you to make my first moments here...

335
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:14,360
快樂和…
...so warm and happy...

336
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,331
歡悅
...and pleasant.

337
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,604
-?塔，你怎麼了？ -沒事
- What is the matter, Marta? - Nothing.

338
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:41,050
小姐
Fraulein...

339
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:45,128
是不是每餐飯
...is it to be at every meal or merely at dinnertime...

340
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:49,927
你都想要讓我們
...that you intend leading us through this rare and wonderful new world...

341
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:51,798
消化不良？
...of indigestion?

342
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,240
不，艦長，他們只是很高興
They're all right, captain. They're just happy.

343
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:17,657
-勞夫，晚安 -晚安，福蘭斯
- Rolfe, good evening. - Good evening, Franz.

344
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,661
-一切正常嗎？ -是的
- I trust everything is under control? - Yes, yes.

345
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,736
-有何進展嗎？ -或許
- Are there any developments? - Perhaps.

346
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,099
-艦長在不在？ -他在用晚餐
- Is the captain home? - He's at dinner.

347
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,672
-和他的家人？ -是的
- With the family? - Yes.

348
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,740
請立刻把電報交給他
Give him this telegram at once.

349
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,571
沒問題
Certainly.

350
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:46,953
您的電報，先生
A telegram for you, sir.

351
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,627
福蘭斯，誰送來的？
Franz? Who delivered it?

352
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,957
當然是勞夫了
That young lad Rolfe, of course.

353
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:58,032
父親，我能先告退嗎？
Father, may I be excused?

354
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:03,465
孩子們，明早我必須去維也納
Children, in the morning I shall be going to Vienna.

355
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:06,211
怎麼又來了，父親？
Not again, Father!

356
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,175
這次你要去多久，父親？
How long will you be gone this time?

357
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,286
我不確定，葛特兒
I'm not sure, Gretl.

358
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:18,048
-是不是去看史蕾特男爵夫人？ -少管閒事
- To visit Baroness Schraeder again? - Mind your own business!

359
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,959
事實上，是的，露易莎
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

360
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:26,563
-為何我們總見不到男爵夫人呢？ -為何她要見你？
- Why can't we ever see the baroness? - Why would she want to see you?

361
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:31,736
你會見到她的 我要帶她回來這裡，和大家認識
You are going to see the baroness. I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

362
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,037
還有麥斯伯伯
And Uncle Max.

363
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,708
麥伯伯
Uncle Max!

364
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,091
勞夫
Rolfe!

365
00:36:58,164 --> 00:36:59,222
哦，勞夫
Oh, Rolfe!

366
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:04,703
-不，莉莎，我們不能 -為何，傻瓜？
- No, Liesl. We mustn't! - Why not, silly?

367
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:07,600
-我不知道 -你在此不是為了等我嗎？
- I don't know... - Isn't this why you're waiting?

368
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,706
是的，當然
Yes, of course.

369
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,708
-我想你，莉莎 -有嗎，有多想？
- I've missed you, Liesl. - You have? How much?

370
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:16,780
好多，我甚至想給你送電報 讓我好來此地
I even thought of sending a telegram, so I'd be able to deliver it here.

371
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,952
那是很美好的想法 你為何不做呢？就現在吧
Oh, that's a lovely thought! Why don't you, right now?

372
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:25,385
-但是我就在此啊 -拜託，勞夫，送給我電報吧
- But I'm here! - Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.

373
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:29,050
我為你起稿：“親愛的莉莎…”
I'll start it for you. "Dear Liesl..."

374
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:33,358
親愛的莉莎 我很想要告訴你…
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able to tell you...

375
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,795
我對你的感覺，完結
...how I feel about you. Stop.

376
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:40,564
很不幸，電報費用太貴了
Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive.

377
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,207
真摯的勞夫
Sincerely, Rolfe."

378
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,173
-真摯？ -衷心的
- "Sincerely"? - Cordially.

379
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,040
-衷心的？ -深情的？
- "Cordially"? - Affectionately?

380
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,442
會不會有回電？
Will there be any reply?

381
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,881
親愛的勞夫，完結
"Dear Rolfe: Stop.

382
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,984
不要完結，你的莉莎
Don't stop! Your Liesl."

383
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,562
如果我們不用等別人 給父親打電報才能見面就好了
If only we didn't have to wait for someone to send Father a telegram.

384
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:08,232
我如何知道何時才能見到你？
How do I know when I'll see you again?

385
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,329
讓我想想看
Well, let's see...

386
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,308
我可以因為搞錯而來
I could come here by mistake.

387
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:20,939
要給史奈德上校電報 他從柏林來此，停留在…
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider! He's here from Berlin staying with...

388
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:25,147
沒有人知道他在此的 別告訴你父親
No one knows he's here. Don't tell your father.

389
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,581
-為何不？ -因為你父親自視為奧地利人
- Why not? - Your father's so Austrian.

390
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:30,085
我們都是奧地利人
We're all Austrian.

391
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,693
而那些認為該自視為德國人的 他們不希望這樣
Some think we ought to be German, and they're very mad at those who don't.

392
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,691
他們已準備好…
They're getting ready to...

393
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,799
我希望你父親不會惹上麻煩
Let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.

394
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:46,004
別擔心父親，他是海軍大英雄 他甚至由國王親自授動
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero. He was even decorated by the emperor.

395
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:49,471
我不擔心他 但我卻擔心他的女兒
I don't worry about him. I worry about his daughter.

396
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,477
我？為什麼？
Me? Why?

397
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,336
-你是那樣… -什麼？
- Well, you're so... - What?

398
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,270
你是如此地年輕
You're such a baby!

399
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,616
我16歲了，一點都不年輕了
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

400
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:04,381
小女孩在空虛的舞臺等待
You wait, little girl On an empty stage

401
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:07,991
等待命運的開始
For fate to turn the light on

402
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:11,859
你的生命目前是空白的一頁
Your life, little girl Is an empty page

403
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:16,193
男人希望在上面書寫
That men will want to write on

404
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:22,398
書寫
To write on

405
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:27,279
你16歲，快17歲了
You are 16 going on 17

406
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,314
寶貝，該去思考了
Baby, it's time to think

407
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:35,147
應當警覺，謹慎和當心
Better beware Be canny and careful

408
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:39,017
寶貝，你正在邊緣
Baby, you're on the brink

409
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,193
你是16歲，快17歲
You are 16 going on 17

410
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:47,059
男孩們會排隊等候
Fellows will fall in line

411
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,700
很積極的年輕人 和一些魯莽小人
Eager young lads And roues and cads

412
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:54,840
會向你獻酒和美食
Will offer you food and wine

413
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:58,874
你完全沒有心理準備
Totally unprepared are you

414
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:02,840
去面對男人的世界
To face a world of men

415
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:07,580
怯懦和害羞，你會如此的畏懼
Timid and shy and scared are you

416
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:11,379
事情全在你知識範圍以外
Of things beyond your ken

417
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:15,459
你需要一位元成熟和有智慧的人
You need someone older and wiser

418
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,563
告訴你怎麼做
Telling you what to do

419
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:23,235
我17歲快18歲了
I am 17 going on 18

420
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:29,431
我能夠照顧你
I'll take care of you

421
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:05,308
我16歲快17歲了
I am 16 going on 17

422
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,913
我知道我很天真
I know that I'm naive

423
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:12,413
我遇上的男孩或會說我很甜美
Fellows I meet May tell me I'm sweet

424
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:16,349
我會心甘情願地相信
And willingly I believe

425
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:19,986
我16歲快17歲了
I am 16 going on 17

426
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:23,959
如玫瑰般無邪
Innocent as a rose

427
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:27,622
那些喝著白蘭地的單身男子
Bachelor dandies Drinkers of brandies

428
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:31,267
我對此毫無認識
What do I know of those?

429
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:34,998
完全沒有心理準備
Totally unprepared am I

430
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:38,767
去面對男人的世界
To face a world of men

431
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:42,512
我是如此怯懦，害羞和害怕
Timid and shy and scared am I

432
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:46,445
事情全在我知識範圍以外
Of things beyond my ken

433
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:50,481
我需要一位元成熟和有智慧的人
I need someone older and wiser

434
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:54,022
告訴我怎麼做
Telling me what to do

435
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,057
你17歲快18歲了
You are 17 going on 18

436
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:03,964
我會完全信賴你
I'll depend on you

437
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:58,449
請進
Come in.

438
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,112
思蜜德小姐
Frau Schmidt.

439
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:05,185
這是給你做新衣服的
For your new dresses.

440
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:09,484
-艦長從城裡買來的 -多麼美的布料
- The captain had these sent from town. - Oh, how lovely!

441
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:13,198
我可以縫製出最漂亮的衣裳
These will make the prettiest clothes I've ever had.

442
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:16,958
告訴我，如果我再要求 多點布料的話，他會肯嗎？
Do you think he would get me more material if I asked?

443
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:20,832
-家庭教師需要多少衣服？ -不是為我，是為了孩子
- How many dresses do you need? - Not for me, for the children.

444
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:23,166
我要為他們做點遊戲服
I want to make them some play clothes.

445
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:26,970
范崔普的孩子不玩遊戲 他們只做操練
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.

446
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
所以你不贊成了
Surely you don't approve of that.

447
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:33,283
自從艦長失去他太太後
Ever since the captain lost his poor wife...

448
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,215
他管理家事就好像管軍艦般
...he runs this house as if on one of his ships.

449
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:38,455
哨音、命令
Whistles, orders.

450
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:40,556
再也沒有音樂 沒有歡笑了
No more music, no more laughing.

451
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:44,354
不願接觸任何能讓他 想起她的事物，孩子們也一樣
Nothing that reminds him of her. Even the children.

452
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:45,956
那太不對了
But that's so wrong.

453
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:48,323
可以怎樣？
Oh, well.

454
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:52,197
你喜歡你的房間嗎？ 你會有新的窗簾
How do you like your room? There'll be new drapes at the windows.

455
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:53,734
它們還好好地
Bu these are fine.

456
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:55,634
反正新的已經訂了
New ones have been ordered.

457
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:59,141
-我真的不需要它們 -晚安
- But I really don't need them. - Good night, now.

458
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:03,406
思蜜德小姐，你想如果明天 我要求他布料的事
Frau Schmidt, if I asked the captain about the material?

459
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:08,143
-他明早就離開去維也納 -是，他要去多久呢？
- He's leaving in the morning. - Of course. How long will he be gone?

460
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:13,317
那得看情況，上次他在男爵夫人 那兒停留了一個月
It depends. The last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.

461
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:19,056
我本不該說這些的 我們還不很熟悉
I shouldn't be saying this to you. I don't know you that well.

462
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:22,233
但如果你問我的話 艦長是很認真地…
But if you ask me, the captain's thinking seriously...

463
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:24,733
想娶這女人
...of marrying her before summer's over.

464
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:28,168
那太好了 孩子們會有新母親了
Wonderful! The children will have a mother again.

465
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,906
是的
Yes.

466
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,906
晚安
Well, good night.

467
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,545
晚安
Good night.

468
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,853
親愛的天父 我現在知道為何你要我來此了
Dear Father, now I know why You sent me here.

469
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,957
是幫助這些孩子 準備接受他們的新母親
To help these children prepare for a new mother.

470
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:02,492
而我也祈禱 它將會是個快樂的家庭
And I pray this will become a happy family in Thy sight.

471
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,825
主保佑艦長，莉莎，費瑞克
God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

472
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:10,197
還有露易莎 碧姬塔，?塔和小葛特兒
God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.

473
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,338
我忘了個男孩 他叫什麼名字？
And I forgot the other boy. What's his name?

474
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,940
總之，主保佑他
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

475
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:21,137
求主賜福院長，?格麗特修女
God bless the Reverend Mother and Sister Margaretta...

476
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,146
和在修道院的每位修女
...and everybody at the abbey.

477
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:25,876
還有主啊，有關莉莎
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

478
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:28,287
讓她知道我是她的朋友
Help her know that I'm her friend...

479
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:31,049
讓她告訴我，她在幹什麼
...and help her tell me what she's been up to.

480
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:32,952
你會去告密嗎？
Are you going to tell on me?

481
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,630
協助我能瞭解，讓我能指引她
Help me to be understanding so I may guide her footsteps.

482
00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:39,526
因父，及子，及聖神之名
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

483
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:42,726
我出去散步，而大門提前關
I was out walking and somebody locked the doors early.

484
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,666
我不想吵醒大家 所以當我看見你的窗戶是開著時…
I didn't want to wake everybody, so when I saw your window open...

485
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:51,335
你不會向父親告密吧？
You're not going to tell Father, are you?

486
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:58,715
你是如何攀上來的？
How did you climb up?

487
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,348
我們常這樣進來戲弄家教
It's how we always got in to play tricks on the governess.

488
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:05,549
露易莎能手拿一罐的蜘蛛 單手爬上來呢
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

489
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,222
蜘蛛？
Spiders?

490
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:14,561
你是獨自出去散步嗎？
Were you out walking all by yourself?

491
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:25,740
我們今晚將衣服洗好的話 明天就沒有人會知道
If we wash that dress tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.

492
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:28,177
你可以穿上這個
You could put this on.

493
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:32,613
進去裡面脫下衣服 泡在浴缸裡
Take your dress and put it to soak in the bathtub.

494
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,380
回來坐在床上，我們好好談
Come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.

495
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:40,718
我今天告訴你，我不需要家教
I told you today I didn't need a governess.

496
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:43,021
或許我還真的需要
Well, maybe I do.

497
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:16,054
葛特兒，你害怕嗎？
Gretl, are you scared?

498
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,831
你不是怕這些雷電吧？
You're not frightened of a storm, are you?

499
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,333
與我一起就不用怕了
You just stay right here with me.

500
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:29,738
-其他的人呢？ -他們睡著了，他們不怕
- Where are the others? - They're asleep. They're not scared.

501
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:35,979
是嗎？看
Oh, no? Look.

502
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,486
好吧，大家都上床來
All right, up here on the bed.

503
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:42,483
-真的嗎？ -只此一次，來吧
- Really? - Well, just this once. Come on.

504
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,925
-現在就等男孩們 -他們不會來，男孩們是很勇敢的
- Now we'll wait for the boys. - You won't see them. Boys are brave.

505
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,798
你們男孩不是也在害怕吧？
You weren't scared, were you?

506
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:59,534
當然不怕 我們只想確定你不害怕
Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure that you weren't.

507
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:03,667
-你真周到 -不是我出的主意
- That's very thoughtful of you. - It wasn't my idea.

508
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:05,809
是寇特
It was Kurt's!

509
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,641
寇特，是我忘掉的一位 主保佑寇特
Kurt! That's the one I left out! God bless Kurt.

510
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,215
為何會這樣？
Why does it do that?

511
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:17,288
因為閃電和雷公說話 而雷公在回話
The lightning talks to the thunder, and the thunder answers.

512
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,016
-閃電一定很調皮 -並不全然
- But lightning must be nasty. - Not really.

513
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,558
為何雷公如此生氣？
Why does the thunder get so angry?

514
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,957
使我想哭
It makes me want to cry.

515
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:31,032
當我感覺不快樂時 我會想一些美好的事物
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy, I just try to think of nice things.

516
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,069
會是哪一類？
What kind of things?

517
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:35,809
讓我想想，美好的事物
Well, let me see. Nice things...

518
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,135
水仙花
Daffodils.

519
00:49:38,412 --> 00:49:39,811
綠草地
Green meadows.

520
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:42,478
滿天的星星
Skies full of stars.

521
00:49:42,683 --> 00:49:45,880
玫瑰上的雨露，小貓的鬍鬚
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens

522
00:49:46,087 --> 00:49:49,215
光亮的銅壺，溫暖的羊毛手套
Bright copper kettles And warm woolen mittens

523
00:49:49,423 --> 00:49:52,586
有細繩的褐色包裝紙
Brown paper packages Tied up with strings

524
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:56,853
這些都是我心愛的事物
These are a few of my favorite things

525
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:02,231
乳白色小馬，香脆蘋果批
Cream-colored ponies And crisp apple strudels

526
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:05,700
門鈴聲和雪車鈴聲 還有那些炸豬排伴麵條
Doorbells and sleigh bells And schnitzel with noodles

527
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,875
飛翔的野雁 翅膀上有月亮
Wild geese that fly With the moon on their wings

528
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,944
這些都是部分我喜歡的事物

你好

小姐，我是否告訴過你 在這屋裡要嚴守就寢時間？
Fraulein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed?

566
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:13,394

The children were upset by the storm, so l...

567
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:15,791
你是說過，先生
You did, sir.

568
00:52:16,003 --> 00:52:20,201
要你記住如此簡單的指示 是否很困難？
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty remembering such simple instructions?

569
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,135
只有在雷電風暴時
Only during thunderstorms.

570
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:27,136
莉莎
Liesl?

571
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,576
晚飯後我沒看見你
I don't recall seeing you after dinner.

572
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:31,913
是嗎，事實上…

573

我們今晚相處得較熟了

現在已不早了 你們聽見父親的話了，快回床上去
It's too late to go into that. You heard your father. Go back to bed.

578
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:51,936
小姐
Fraulein...

579
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,266
你還記得我明早要出門吧
...you have managed to remember I'm leaving in the morning?

Could I talk to you about clothes for the children for when they play?

585
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,926
-如果我能有些布料的話… -你顯然是非常全能的
- Lf I could have some material. - You are many things.

586
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,360
但嘮叨不是我所想要的
Not the least of which is repetitious.

587
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,729
-但他們只是孩子呀 -是的
- But they're children! - Yes.

588
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,734
而我是他們的父親

00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:12,676
當狗咬時，當蜂蟄時

592
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,411
當我感覺傷心時
When I'm feeling sad

593
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:18,955
只要想起我最喜愛的事物
I simply remember my favorite things

594
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:21,286
我的心情就不會…
And then I don't feel...

595
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:28,457
如此糟了
...so bad

596
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,155
孩子，看這邊
Children, over here. See!

597
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,164
走吧！
Come on.

00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,445
?莉亞小姐
Fraulein Maria?

00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,618
我們能每天都如此嗎？

600
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,117
-你不認為你會厭倦嗎？ -我想是吧！
- Don't you think you'd get tired of it? - I suppose so.

601
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,719
每隔一天？
Every other day?

602
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:36,555
我自從在約瑟芬小姐的牙刷上 放膠水後，就沒有如此開心過了
I haven't had so much fun since we put glue on Fraulein Josephine's toothbrush.

603
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:40,665
我真不懂像你們如此好的小孩 怎會惡作劇呢？
I can't understand how children as nice as you can play such tricks.

604
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:42,765
-這很簡單啊 -為何要如此？
- It's easy. - But why do it?

605
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,404
否則我們要如何吸引 父親的注意力呢？
How else can we get Father's attention?

606
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,765
我明白了
Oh, I see.

607
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,304
我們得多想想那一點
We'll have to think about that one.

608
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,107
來吧，大家，過來
All right, over here.

609
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:56,748
我們要做什麼？
What are we going to do?

610
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:58,952
我們來想首歌 好歡迎男爵夫人的到來
Think of a song for the baroness.

611
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,154
父親不喜歡我們唱歌
Father doesn't like us to sing.

612
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,982
或許我們可以改變他的想法 你們會唱什麼歌？
Perhaps we can change his mind. Now, what songs do you know?

613
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,420
我們什麼歌都不會唱
We don't know any songs.

614
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,323
-一首歌都不會？ -我們甚至不知如何唱歌
- Not any? - We don't even know how to sing.

615
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:14,160
那就不能浪費時間了 你們必須學習
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

616
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,163
但是如何學呢？
But how?

617
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:24,433
我們從最初步開始學
Let's start at the very beginning

618
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:28,012
從一個很恰當的地方開始

619
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:30,149

620
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:31,612
ABC開始
A, B, C

621
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:36,152
當你唱歌時 你從DoReMi開始
When you sing, you begin with Do-Re-Mi

622
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,017

Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

628
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:54,506
讓我看是否能使它容易點
Let's see if I can make it easier.

01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:20,142
So do la ti do re do
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

665
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,315
-很好 -但那是沒有意義的
- Good. - But it doesn't mean anything.

666
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:26,526
所以我們要加上詞 每一個音一個字
So we put in words. One word for every note.

667
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,055
像這樣
Like this:

668
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:34,859
當你學會音符後
When you know the notes to sing

669
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:40,732
你幾乎可以唱任何歌
You can sing most anything

670
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:41,974
一起來
Together!

671
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:48,876
當你學會音符後
When you know the notes to sing

672
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:55,749
你幾乎可以唱任何歌
You can sing most anything

673
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:59,523
-Doe -是一頭雌性的鹿
- Doe - A deer, a female deer

674
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:02,990
-Ray -是一線金色的陽光
- Ray - A drop of golden sun

675
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:06,494
-Me -是我對自己的稱呼
- Me - A name I call myself

676
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,760
-Far -是一段漫漫長路

677
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:13,370
-Sew -是用針拉著線
- Sew - A needle pulling thread

678
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,938
-La -是Sew之後的音
- La - A note to follow sew

679
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:20,136
-Tea -是配果醬麵包的飲品
- Tea - A drink with jam and bread

680
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:24,215
那樣我們又回到Doe
That will bring us back to doe

681
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:48,071
當你學會音符後
When you know the notes to sing

682
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:55,138
你幾乎可以唱任何歌
You can sing most anything

683
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:58,878
Doe是一頭雌性的鹿
Doe A deer, a female deer

684
01:01:59,152 --> 01:02:02,679
Ray是一線金色的陽光
Ray A drop of golden sun

685
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,347
Me是我對自己的稱呼
Me A name I call myself

686
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:09,756
Far是一段漫漫長路
Far A long long way to run

687
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,193
Sew是用針拉著線
Sew A needle pulling thread

688
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,597
La是Sew之後的音
La A note to follow sew

689
01:02:17,204 --> 01:02:19,832
Tea是配果醬麵包的飲品
Tea A drink with jam and bread

690
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:24,032
那樣我們又回到…
That will bring us back to

691
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:31,082
So do la fa mi do re
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

692
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:35,845
So do la fa ti
So-do-la-fa-ti

693
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:37,716
La so
La-so

694
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:47,063
Ti do
Ti-do

695
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,757
So do
So-do

696
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:05,309
這些山真是壯觀 真是棒透了
The mountains are magnificent, really magnificent.

697
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:08,214
-我特別為你而升起的 -哦？
- I had them put up just for you. - Oh?

698
01:03:08,488 --> 01:03:10,649
萬尺高山
Even if it's to a height of 10,000 feet...

699
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:14,451
蓋爾總是相信 它的升起是為了特殊場合
...Georg always believes in "rising to the occasion."

700
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:16,992
你的笑話不改進的話 我就要收回邀請了
Improve the jokes or I'll disinvite you.

701
01:03:17,597 --> 01:03:20,157
你並未邀請我 我是不請自來的
You didn't invite me. I invited myself.

702
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,958
-當然 -你需要伴護人
- Naturally. - You needed a chaperone...

703
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:25,966
我需要有佳餚…
...and I needed a place where the cuisine is superb...

704
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,833
美酒的地方
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

705
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,736
而價格又公道
...and the price perfect.

706
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,943
麥斯，你真的太過分了
Max, you are outrageous.

707
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:38,173
一點也不，我是很迷人的食客
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.

708
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,946
聽
Listen.

709
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,521
那是可普曼修道院的唱詩班
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

710
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,156
他們唱得很好
They're good.

711
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,825
非常好
Very good.

712
01:03:54,634 --> 01:03:57,296
以後幾天裡我要探索這地區
I must explore this area in the next few days.

713
01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:00,962
在某處，有個渴望被發掘的 合唱團在等我發掘
Somewhere, a hungry singing group is waiting for Max Detweiler...

714
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:05,507
並在薩爾斯堡的音樂節時 一舉成名
...to pluck it out and make it famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

715
01:04:05,712 --> 01:04:09,011
-他們有名而你就有利 -那不公平，我得承認
- They get fame, you get money. - It's unfair, I admit it.

716
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:13,651
但有天一切都會改變 我也會成名的
But someday that'll be changed. I shall get the fame too.

717
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,855
天啊，這是怎麼回事？
Good heavens, what's this?

718
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:26,629
沒什麼，只是本地的頑童
It's nothing. Just some local urchins.

719
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:45,750
在這裡和你在一起 真的讓我很興奮
This really is exciting for me, Georg. Being here with you.

720
01:04:46,586 --> 01:04:49,146
樹林，湖澤 這些你都已經看過了
Trees, lakes, you've seen them before.

721
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:52,016
我不是這個意思 你是知道的
That is not what I mean, and you know it.

722
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:56,217
-你是指我嗎？我令你興奮？ -不可能嗎？
- You mean me? I'm exciting? - Is that so impossible?

723
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:59,522
不是，只是不會發生
No, just highly improbable.

724
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:03,930
-又來了，又看低自己了 -我是危險的駕駛人
- There you go, running yourself down. - Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

725
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:11,404
在這裡，我好像比較 容易瞭解你，蓋爾
You're much less of a riddle when I see you here, Georg.

726
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,444
-在我生長的地方？ -是的，正是
- In my natural habitat? - Yes, exactly.

727
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,875
你是說在這
Are you saying that I'm more at home...

728
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:21,110
鳥語花香的地方
...among the birds and the flowers and the wind that moves...

729
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:23,549
我感覺較舒適？
...through the trees like a restless sea?

730
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,382
多有詩意啊
How poetic.

731
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,457
是的，我是的，不是嗎？
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

732
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:33,726
我覺得在此比在維也納安逸 在你們那奢華的沙龍裡
More at home here than in Vienna in all your glittering salons...

733
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:38,302
和那些無聊漢附庸風雅喝香檳
...gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne...

734
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:42,302
被那不知名的華爾滋所牽絆
...stumbling about to waltzes by Strausses I can't even remember?

735
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,736
-你就是想告訴我這些嗎？ -是的
- Is that what you're saying? - Yes.

736
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:47,276
你為何會有那概念？
Now whatever gave you that idea?

737
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,552
我真的喜歡這兒，蓋爾 如此可愛和寧靜
Oh, I do like it here, Georg. It's so lovely and peaceful.

738
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:56,822
你怎捨得經常離開此地？
How can you leave it so often?

739
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,923
我想是假裝自己還是很活躍
Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.

740
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,425
活躍使生命看似充滿了目的
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.

741
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:06,428
可能是在逃避回憶
Could it be running away from memories?

742
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:13,572
也許是在尋求留下的理由
Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.

743
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,732
我希望那是你 常去維也納的理由
I hope that's why you've been coming to Vienna so often.

744
01:06:18,411 --> 01:06:22,745
-還是那兒有讓你著魔的事物？ -我不能說是你令我著魔的
- Were there other distractions? - I'd hardly call you a distraction.

745
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:25,644
那你如何形容我，蓋爾？
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

746
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:29,183
漂亮…
Lovely...

747
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,818
美麗，聰明有風度 很完美的女主人
...charming, witty, graceful, the perfect hostess...

748
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:35,859
你會恨我這樣說的：
...and, you're going to hate me for this...

749
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,355
有點像是我的救世主
...in a way, my savior.

750
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:40,462
真不浪漫呀
Oh, how unromantic.

751
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,999
如果我不告訴你 那我就是不知感恩的小人了
I'd be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't say...

752
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:46,500
是你使我重新體會生命的意義
...that you brought some meaning back into my life.

753
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:51,105
我想我是受寵若驚
I am amusing, I suppose.

754
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:56,111
我擁有維也納最好的地方 最上流的社交圈子的朋友
I have the finest couturier in Vienna and a glittering circle of friends.

755
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:59,444
-和舉辦最豪華的派對 -是的
- I do give some rather gay parties. - Oh, yes.

756
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,517
除去那些…
But take all that away...

757
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:06,158
我只是一個富有 和飄浮不定的人
...and you have just wealthy, unattached little me...

758
01:07:06,826 --> 01:07:09,226
在尋尋覓覓，就像你一樣
...searching, just like you.

759
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:16,029
多來點餡餅嗎？
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

760
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:17,826
-我吃了多少？ -兩個了
- How many have I had? - Two.

761
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:20,005
那麼它就成為第三個吧
Make it an uneven three.

762
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:26,335
還在吃，麥斯？ 一定是不太快樂
Still eating, Max? Must be unhappy.

763
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:30,505
數月來我一直想從何洛克那邊 弄來那隊四重奏
That mixed quartet I've been trying to steal away from Sol Hurok...

764
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,412
-發生何事？ -沙夏皮特搶先了
- What happened? ...Sascha Petrie stole them first.

765
01:07:33,653 --> 01:07:34,915
我最恨賊了
I hate thieves.

766
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:38,487
麥斯，你要學習自愛
Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.

767
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:41,057
為此事我得打長途電話到巴黎 羅馬及斯德哥爾摩
I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.

768
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:44,888
-當然是用蓋爾的電話了 -要不然我怎麼負擔得起？
- On Georg's telephone, of course. - How else could I afford it?

769
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:50,496
我喜歡有錢人，我喜歡他們的 生活方式，尤其和他們一起生活時
I like rich people, the way they live and how I live when I'm with them.

770
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:52,828
我在想孩子們上哪兒去了
I wonder where the children are.

771
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,730
他們一定是聽見我來 躲起來了
They must have heard I was coming and hid.

772
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:58,500
我是希望他們會在家歡迎你的
I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.

773
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:03,239
麥斯，試著放開朗一些，好嗎？
Max, do step out of character for a moment and try and be charming.

774
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,691
怎樣？
Well?

775
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:15,788
什麼怎樣？
Well what?

776
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:18,930
你讓蓋爾決定了沒？ 我是否會聽見婚禮鐘聲？
Have you made up his mind? Do I hear wedding bells?

777
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,190
-很有希望 -太棒了
- Pealing madly. - Marvelous.

778
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:24,198
-但不一定跟我有關 -那是什麼意思？
- Not necessarily for me. - What kind of talk's that?

779
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,962
那跟你無關
None-of-your-business talk.

780
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:28,706
我很喜歡蓋爾 我不准你把我們當玩具
I'm terribly fond of him, so don't toy with us.

781
01:08:28,975 --> 01:08:32,570
但我是個孩子，我喜歡玩具 所以告訴我一切吧
But I'm a child. I like toys. So tell me everything.

782
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:37,942
快點，告訴麥斯一切的細節
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy, intimate, disgusting detail.

783
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:43,549
我有感覺，我來這裡的目的 是要得到認可
Well, let's just say I have a feeling I may be here on approval.

784
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:46,816
-我同意了，你怎會錯過？ -很容易的
- I approve of that. How can you miss? - Far too easily.

785
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:50,324
如我瞭解你的話 我知道你會找到方法的
If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.

786
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:53,088
-他不是普通人 -他很富有
- He's no ordinary man. - No, he's rich.

787
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,597
他老婆的死 給他帶來可怕的心痛
His wife's death gave him a great heartache.

788
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:58,930
當你先生死時 他留給你一筆可觀的遺產
And your husband's death gave you a great fortune.

789
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,106
麥斯，你真是怪物
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

790
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:05,334
你和蓋爾對我來講，就像是一家人 所以我想看到你們兩人結婚
You and Georg are like family. That's why I want to see you married.

791
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:09,139
我們必須保留那筆錢 在同一家庭中
We must keep all that lovely money in the family.

792
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:28,366
-你在幹什麼？ -范艦長
- What are you doing there? - Oh, Captain von Trapp.

793
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:30,660
我正在找…
I was just looking for...

794
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:34,370
我沒看到，我不知道你…
I didn't see, I mean, I didn't know you were...

795
01:09:34,974 --> 01:09:36,669
希特勒萬歲
Heil Hitler!

796
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:38,867
你是誰？
Who are you?

797
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:41,375
我送電報給德維勒先生
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

798
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:44,378
-我就是 -是的，先生
- I am Herr Detweiler. - Yes, sir.

799
01:09:49,455 --> 01:09:52,049
好，電報你送到了，滾吧
You've delivered your telegram. Now get out.

800
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,232
-蓋爾，他只是個小男孩 -是，而我只是個奧地利人
- Georg, he's just a boy. - Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

801
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:05,232
要發生的遲早會發生 只要確定不會發生在你身上
Things will happen. Make sure they don't happen to you.

802
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:08,200
麥斯，你別再這樣說
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

803
01:10:08,474 --> 01:10:10,669
你知道我沒有政治主張
I have no political convictions.

804
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,845
-人人都如此時我可以怎樣？ -有東西可以做的
- Can I help it if other people do? - You can help it.

805
01:10:14,981 --> 01:10:17,142
一定有
You must help it.

806
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:29,019
哈囉
Hello?

807
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:34,428
你如此遙遠，你在哪兒？
You're far away. Where are you?

808
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:38,602
在一個遙不可及的世界裡
In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.

809
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,034
我有辦法帶你回到現實世界嗎？
Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I'm in?

810
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:11,459
-爸爸，是爸爸！ -是你們爸爸！
- Father! Father! - There's your father!

811
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:14,899
哦，艦長，你回來了
Oh, captain, you're home!

812
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:25,944
立刻從水裡上來
Come out of that water at once!

813
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:37,256
你一定是史蕾特男爵夫人
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

814
01:11:42,568 --> 01:11:45,560
我濕透了！
I'm soaked to the skin!

815
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,916
排好
Straight line!

816
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,999
這位是史蕾特男爵夫人
This is Baroness Schraeder.

817
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:20,367
而這些…
And these...

818
01:12:20,606 --> 01:12:22,198
是我的孩子們
...are my children.

819
01:12:23,309 --> 01:12:24,799
你們好
How do you do?

820
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:30,611
進去屋裡，抹幹身子，清潔好 換衣服後再回來此地
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change your clothes and report back here!

821
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,714
小姐，請你留下來
Fraulein, you will stay here, please!

822
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:43,020
我最好去看麥斯在幹什麼
I think I'd better go see what Max is up to.

823
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:55,002
小姐…
Now, fraulein...

824
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:58,968
我要你據實回答
...I want a truthful answer.

825
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:00,845
是的，艦長
Yes, captain.

826
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:05,208
是真有可能，或只是我的想像…
Is it possible, or could I have just imagined it?

827
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,213
我的孩子們今天有爬過樹？
Have my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?

828
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:12,851
是的，艦長
Yes, captain.

829
01:13:13,926 --> 01:13:15,257
這樣
I see.

830
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:20,322
我能否請教他們哪來的這些
And where, may I ask, did they get these...

831
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,659
-遊戲服 -你是如此稱呼它們的
- Play clothes. - Is that what they are?

832
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:26,270
是我拿我臥房裡的 舊窗簾所做的
I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.

833
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,200
-窗簾？ -還剩下很多
- Drapes? - They have plenty of wear left.

834
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:31,342
孩子們穿著玩了不少地方
We've been everywhere in them.

835
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:36,037
你是在告訴我 我的孩子穿著舊窗簾的布料…
Are you telling me that my children have been roaming about Salzburg...

836
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:39,616
玩遍了薩爾斯堡？
...dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?

837
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:41,513
而且玩得很開心
And having a marvelous time!

838
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,952
-他們有制服 -對不起那是瘋子穿的
- They have uniforms. - Forgive me, straitjackets.

839
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:47,955
孩子們不該擔心他們會弄髒 他們珍貴的制服
They can't be children if they worry about clothes...

840
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,353
我沒聽過埋怨
They don't complain.

841
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:52,291
他們不敢，他們太愛你 我想…
They don't dare. They love you too much and fear...

842
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:54,090
我不想討論我的孩子們
Don't discuss my children.

843
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,234
你必須聽某人說的 你從來不在家久留的
You've got to hear, you're never home...

844
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:57,959
我不想再聽你說 有關我孩子們的事
I don't want to hear more!

845
01:13:58,204 --> 01:14:00,695
我知道你不要，但你必須
I know you don't, but you've got to!

846
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:03,635
-就拿莉莎來說吧 -你別再說…
- Liesl's not a child. - Not one word...

847
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,777
她快要長成一個女人 但你甚至不瞭解她
Soon she'll be a woman and you won't even know her.

848
01:14:07,046 --> 01:14:10,106
費瑞克要像你一樣成為男人 但沒有人給他作榜樣
Friedrich wants to be a man but you're not here to show...

849
01:14:10,383 --> 01:14:11,714
你怎膽敢告訴我兒子的事？
Don't you dare tell me...

850
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:15,216
碧姬塔可以告訴你他的事 她洞悉一切
Brigitta could tell you about him. She notices everything.

851
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:18,582
還有寇特，他假裝強悍 當你漠視他時
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain when you ignore him...

852
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,315
他還要表現出堅強的神情
...the way you do all of them.

853
01:14:20,593 --> 01:14:22,993
還有露易莎，我還不太瞭解她
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

854
01:14:23,262 --> 01:14:26,459
這些小孩只想要被愛 求求你，艦長，愛他們
The little ones just want love. Please, love them all.

855
01:14:26,732 --> 01:14:28,256
我不想再聽你說有關孩子的事
I don't care to hear more.

856
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:32,597
-我還沒說完 -是的，你說完了，艦長
- I am not finished yet, captain! - Oh, yes, you are, captain!

857
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,300
小姐
Fraulein.

858
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:40,739
你現在立刻收拾行李
Now, you will pack your things this minute...

859
01:14:40,947 --> 01:14:43,438
回去修道院
...and return to the abbey.

860
01:14:46,085 --> 01:14:47,416
那是什麼？
What's that?

861
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,179
是歌聲
It's singing.

862
01:14:50,823 --> 01:14:53,621
我知道是歌聲，但是誰在唱歌？
Yes, I realize it's singing. But who is singing?

863
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:56,152
孩子們
The children.

864
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:00,362
孩子們？
The children?

865
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:03,663
我教了他們一首歌 歡迎男爵夫人
I taught them something to sing for the baroness.

866
01:15:09,308 --> 01:15:15,338
群山讓我心充滿音樂
My heart wants to sing Every song it hears

867
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:18,175
要唱出每支歌
Every song that it hears

868
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:23,889
我心震盪像鳥兒翅膀
My heart wants to beat like the wings Of the birds that rise

869
01:15:24,156 --> 01:15:27,284
由湖邊飛上樹
From the lake to the trees

870
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:28,959
飛上樹
To the trees

871
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:34,132
我心歎息
My heart wants to sigh Like a chime that flies

872
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:38,963
像鐘聲飄揚
From a church on a breeze

873
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:43,140
笑聲像小溪
To laugh like a brook When it trips and falls

874
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:46,344
流過石頭跌盪抑揚
Over stones on its way

875
01:15:46,646 --> 01:15:48,011
跌盪抑揚
On its way

876
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:52,684
夜晚歌唱
To sing through the night

877
01:15:52,885 --> 01:15:58,551
像雲雀祈禱
Like a lark who is learning to pray

878
01:15:58,824 --> 01:16:03,318
當我奔向山裡
I go to the hills

879
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:09,764
心情落寞
When my heart is lonely

880
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:13,733
我聽到…
I know I will hear

881
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:19,774
昔日歌聲
What I've heard before

882
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:24,845
我心就會歌唱
My heart will be blessed

883
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:32,047
因為音樂的響起
With the sound of music

884
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:38,124
我要再度…
And I'll sing...

885
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:46,464
歌唱
...once more

886
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:21,502
雪絨花
Edelweiss!

887
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:28,641
你從來沒有告訴我 你的孩子們如此地可愛
You never told me how enchanting your children are.

888
01:17:37,256 --> 01:17:38,814
別走開
Don't go away.

889
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:45,328
小姐
Fraulein.

890
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:49,861
我的…
I...

891
01:17:51,337 --> 01:17:54,135
表現很失常，我道歉
...behaved badly. I apologize.

892
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:59,470
我說話太過分了 這是我最大的缺點
I'm far too outspoken. It's one of my worst faults.

893
01:17:59,879 --> 01:18:01,346
你說的對
You were right.

894
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:05,716
我不瞭解我的孩子們
I don't know my children.

895
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:11,149
仍然有時間，艦長 他們很想接近你
There's still time, captain. They want so much to be close to you.

896
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:15,358
你將音樂帶回到這個家庭裡
And you brought music back into the house.

897
01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:18,128
我都忘記了
I'd forgotten.

898
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:22,197
小姐
Fraulein.

899
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:25,965
我要你留下來
I want you to stay.

900
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:32,705
我請求你留下來
I ask you to stay.

901
01:18:34,547 --> 01:18:38,039
-如果我能幫忙的話 -你已經幫了很多忙
- Lf I could be of any help. - You have already.

902
01:18:38,651 --> 01:18:39,709
比你知道的更多
More than you know.

903
01:18:59,438 --> 01:19:00,769
?塔
Marta.

904
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:02,735
開幕
Curtain!

905
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:08,744
高高的山上 有個寂寞的牧羊人在唱歌
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

906
01:19:10,249 --> 01:19:13,514
他的歌聲真響亮
Loud was the voice Of the lonely goatherd

907
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,285
偏僻小鎮的居民 亦聽到他的歌聲
Folks in a town That was quite remote heard

908
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:23,090
他的歌聲雄壯而清脆
Lusty and clear From the goatherd's throat heard

909
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:37,474
?塔！?塔！
Marta. Marta!

910
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,870
葛特兒，王子
Gretl, the prince!

911
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:47,074
城堡的橋上有個王子聽到了
A prince on the bridge Of a castle moat heard

912
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:50,886
背著行囊上路的人們也聽到了
Men on a road With a load to tote heard

913
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:56,657
用膳中的人們也聽到了
Men in the midst Of a table d'hote heard

914
01:19:57,997 --> 01:20:01,262
喝啤酒的人們也聽到了
Men drinking beer With the foam afloat heard

915
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:15,472
穿淡粉紅色外衣的女孩也聽見了
One little girl In a pale pink coat heard

916
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:20,449
她唱歌回應那寂寞的牧羊人
She yodeled back To the lonely goatherd

917
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:25,021
她媽媽也欣喜的唱著
Soon her mama With a gleaming gloat heard

918
01:20:26,525 --> 01:20:29,824
一個女孩和牧羊人 唱出多好的二重唱呀
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

919
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:19,673
穿淡粉紅色外衣的女孩也聽見了
One little girl In a pale pink coat heard

920
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:24,478
她唱歌回應那寂寞的牧羊人
She yodeled back To the lonely goatherd

921
01:21:25,818 --> 01:21:29,254
她媽媽也欣喜的唱著
Soon her mama With a gleaming gloat heard

922
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:33,851
一個女孩和牧羊人 唱出多好的二重唱呀
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

923
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:37,188
他們多快樂啊
Happy are they

924
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:43,430
二重唱將要成為三重唱
Soon the duet will become a trio

925
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,518
-好極了！ -好極了！
- Bravo! - Bravo!

926
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:11,218
好極了！
Very good!

927

真精彩！
Wonderful!

928
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:18,697
-麥斯伯伯，可以保留木偶嗎？ -可以嗎？
- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max? - Yes, can we?

929
01:22:18,904 --> 01:22:20,929
你當然可以，親愛的
Of course you may, my darlings.

930
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,372
不然，我怎能告訴可倫教授 將帳單寄給你父親
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner to send the bill to your father?

931
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,775
做得很好，小姐
Well done, fraulein.

932
01:22:33,285 --> 01:22:35,253
我真的很感動
I really am very much impressed.

933
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:37,445
他們是你的孩子
They're your children, captain.

934
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:46,961
你還有什麼做不到的事嗎？
My dear, is there anything you can't do?

935
01:22:47,232 --> 01:22:49,564
我不知自己能否成為好修女
Well, I'm not sure I'll make a good nun.

936
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:52,896
如果有任何問題 我很樂意幫你的
If you have any problems, I'd be happy to help you.

937

各位請注意

938
01:22:57,643 --> 01:23:01,101

I have an announcement to make. Surprise! Surprise!

939
01:23:01,346 --> 01:23:03,644
經過一番苦心的尋求
Today, after a long and desperate search...

940
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:08,910
我終於找到參加 薩爾斯堡音樂節的合唱團了
...I have found a most exciting entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

941
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:10,952
恭喜你，麥斯
Congratulations, Max.

942
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:14,159
這次是誰要給你利用呢？
And who will you be exploiting this time?

943
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:19,158
-聖伊格森合唱團？ -再猜
- The Saint Ignatius Choir? - Guess again.

944
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:23,801
我想，克蘭曼歌詠團？
Well, let me see now. The Klopmann Choir?

945
01:23:24,036 --> 01:23:26,436
-不對，不對 -不對？
- No, no, no, no. - No, no?

946
01:23:26,638 --> 01:23:27,832
告訴我們
Tell us.

947
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,498
一個由家庭組成的合唱團 你永遠都不會估中的
A singing group all in one family. You'll never guess, Georg.

948
01:23:31,777 --> 01:23:34,678
多麼好的主意
What a charming idea!

949
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,677
誰的家庭？
Whose family?

950
01:23:37,549 --> 01:23:39,176
你的啊
Yours.

951
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:41,716
他們將會是一大轟動
They'll be the talk of the festival.

952
01:23:44,556 --> 01:23:47,548
-有何好笑的？ -你很好笑，麥斯
- Well, now, what's so funny? - You are, Max.

953
01:23:47,826 --> 01:23:50,954
很昂貴，但很好笑
You're expensive, but very funny.

954
01:23:51,697 --> 01:23:54,029
-他們一定會相當轟動的 -不，麥斯
- They'll be a sensation! - No, Max.

955
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:56,494
是極好的主意 新面孔又自然
It's a wonderful idea. Fresh, original.

956
01:23:56,702 --> 01:24:01,503
麥斯，我的孩子們不公開演唱
Max! My children do not sing in public.

957
01:24:02,174 --> 01:24:04,142
不能怪我沒嘗試過
You can't blame me for trying.

958
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:07,335
孩子們，下一個該誰唱？
Children, who shall we hear from next?

959
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:11,309
誰唱？
Who?

960
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:18,683
對

962
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:25,887
由你演唱，艦長
You, captain.

963
01:24:26,165 --> 01:24:27,359
我？
Me?

964
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,498
-我不懂 -拜託
- I don't understand. - Please.

965
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,835
不…
No, no, no, no.

966
01:24:39,111 --> 01:24:41,170
我聽說，很久以前 你唱的非常好
I'm told that you were quite good.

967
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,679
-那是非常非常久之前 -我還記得，父親
- That was a very, very long time ago. - I remember, Father.

968
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:47,784
-請為我們唱一首 -求求你，父親
- Play us something we know. - Oh, please, Father.

969
01:24:50,722 --> 01:24:51,780
這個…
Well...

970
01:25:02,034 --> 01:25:04,195
-你為何不告訴我？ -什麼？
- Why didn't you tell me? - What?

971
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:06,767
帶我的口琴來
To bring along my harmonica.

972

范崔普家庭合唱團

1000
01:27:26,345 --> 01:27:28,836
我有個好主意

1001
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:31,549
讓此屋中充滿音樂
Let's really fill this house with music.

1002
01:27:31,783 --> 01:27:34,752
你要為我開個盛大的舞會
You must give a grand and glorious party for me.

1003
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,716
-派對？ -是的，好吧，爸爸！
- A party? - Yes, Father, please!

1004
01:27:37,923 --> 01:27:40,289
我想我該認識 你在薩爾斯堡的朋友了
It's high time I met all your friends...

1005
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:43,083
你不同意嗎？
...and they met me. Don't you agree?

1006
01:27:43,362 --> 01:27:45,592
-我明白你的意思 -好吧，爸爸！
- I see what you mean. - Oh, please!

1013
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:41,145
-艦長 -你好，吉勒先生，男爵夫人
- Captain. - Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

你好
How do you do? Good evening.

1016
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,316
我想你注意到大廳上當眼處 掛著奧地利國旗
Did you notice the obvious display of the Austrian flag?

1017
01:29:19,391 --> 01:29:21,188
女人們看來好漂亮
The women look so beautiful.

1018
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,791
我覺得她們好醜
I think they look ugly.

1019
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:24,892
你這樣說是因為你怕她們
You're just scared of them.

1020
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:27,360
傻瓜！只有成人才會怕女人
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1021
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:31,527
-我認為男人看來好美 -你怎麼會知道？
- I think the men look beautiful. - How would you know?

1022
01:29:49,172 --> 01:29:51,197
莉莎，你在跟誰跳舞？
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1023
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,035
沒有人
Nobody.

1024
01:29:53,844 --> 01:29:55,744
哦，的確沒有

我有這份榮幸嗎？
May I have this dance?

1026
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:02,407
我很樂意的，年輕人
I'd be delighted, young man.

1027
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:11,854
你們為何不告訴我 你們會跳舞？
Why didn't you tell me you could dance?

1028
01:30:12,095 --> 01:30:17,032
我們怕你會叫我們一起跳舞 范崔普家庭舞蹈團
We feared you'd make us all dance. The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1029
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:23,133
他們在演奏什麼？
What are they playing?

1030
01:30:23,373 --> 01:30:26,001
那是奧地利的一種民俗舞曲
It's the Laendler. An Austrian folk dance.

1031
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:29,372
-教我們 -我很久沒跳過了
- Show me. - I haven't danced since I was little.

1032
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:31,547
你記得的，求求你
You remember. Please?

1033
01:30:31,815 --> 01:30:33,749
-這個… -拜託嘛
- Well... - Please.

1034
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:36,214
好吧，過來
All right. Come on over here.

1035
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,553
現在你鞠躬，我答禮
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1036
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:43,425
-像這樣 -很好，現在我們走幾步！
- Like this? - Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1037
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,322
1，2，3，1，2，3
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1038
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:51,226
1，2，3，一起踏步 踏步跳…
One, two, three, step together. Now, step hop, step hop.

1039
01:30:51,468 --> 01:30:54,130
轉圈
Now turn under. Not quite.

1040
01:30:54,337 --> 01:30:58,296
這邊，踏步跳，轉圈
This way. Hop step, hop. And under.

1041
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:00,670
我們要好好練習呢
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1042
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:02,401
讓我來跳好嗎？
Do allow me, will you?

1043
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,565
我不記得了
I don't remember anymore.

1044
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:36,933
-你的臉好紅 -是嗎？
- Your face is all red. - Is it?

1045
01:32:38,274 --> 01:32:40,367
我想我不習慣跳舞吧
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1046
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:45,070
那真是跳得太棒了
Why, that was beautifully done.

1047
01:32:45,348 --> 01:32:47,248
你們是迷人的一對
What a lovely couple you make.

1048
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:49,577
我想孩子們該上床了
It's time the children said good night.

1049
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:51,184
我們馬上去前廳
We'll be in the hall.

1050
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:54,288
-我們有特別節目 -是的
- We have something special prepared. - Right!

1051
01:32:54,591 --> 01:32:55,751
是的，快點
Yes, come on!

1052
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:04,931
蓋爾，你的擔心看來是多餘的
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1053
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:08,227
你還以為自己在 舞會上找不到朋友
You thought you wouldn't find a friend at the party.

1054
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:14,736
-今晚外面有點涼，是不是？ -不，我不知道
- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it? - Oh, I don't know.

1055
01:33:14,944 --> 01:33:16,969
我覺得頗暖和呢！
It seemed rather warm to me.

1056
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:22,379
先生女士們！
Ladies and gentlemen.

1057
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,215
范崔普艦長的孩子 希望向各位道晚安！
The children of Captain von Trapp wish to say good night to you.

1058
01:33:41,337 --> 01:33:45,239
憂愁的鐘聲來自大廳
There's a sad sort of clanging From the clock in the hall

1059
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:49,173
塔尖的鐘聲也響起了
And the bells in the steeple too

1060
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:53,473
在孩子們臥室裡 一隻滑稽的小鳥
And up in the nursery An absurd little bird

1061
01:33:53,683 --> 01:33:56,117
伸出頭來道咕咕
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

1062
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,013
咕咕
Coo-coo

1063
01:33:58,288 --> 01:33:59,516
咕咕
Coo-coo

1064
01:33:59,756 --> 01:34:01,917
很抱歉他告訴我們
Regretfully they tell us

1065
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,490
要我們向大家
But firmly they compel us

1066
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,820
道晚安
To say goodbye

1067
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:12,332
向大家
To you

1068
01:34:15,538 --> 01:34:19,440
別了，再見，珍重晚安
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1069
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:23,510
我不願離開如斯美景
I hate to go And leave this pretty sight

1070
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:34,120
別了，再見，珍重再見
So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1071
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:38,318
我向你和你和你說聲再見
Adieu, adieu To you and you and you

1072
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:49,468
別了，再見，珍重再見
So long, farewell Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

1073
01:34:49,739 --> 01:34:53,675
我能否留下喝第一口香檳？
I'd like to stay And taste my first champagne

1074
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:56,344
-可以嗎？ -不行
- Yes? - No.

1075
01:35:00,683 --> 01:35:04,346
別了，再見，珍重再見
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1076
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:08,646
我輕歎著離開並說再見
I leave and heave a sigh And say goodbye

1077
01:35:08,858 --> 01:35:12,851
再見
Goodbye

1078
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:18,993
我真高興可以離去
I'm glad to go

1079
01:35:19,235 --> 01:35:22,102
我不能說謊
I cannot tell a lie

1080
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:25,430
我展翅，我飄浮
I flit, I float

1081
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:29,166
我驀地消失，我在飛翔
I fleetly flee, I fly

1082
01:35:39,222 --> 01:35:44,956
太陽已就寢
The sun has gone to bed

1083
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:48,926
我也一樣
And so must I

1084
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,532
別了
So long

1085
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:54,328
再見
Farewell

1086
01:35:54,537 --> 01:35:59,941
珍重晚安
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1087
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:05,546
晚安
Goodbye

1088
01:36:06,249 --> 01:36:11,812
晚安
Goodbye

1089
01:36:12,055 --> 01:36:18,927
晚安
Goodbye

1090
01:36:19,128 --> 01:36:27,627
晚安
Goodbye

1091
01:36:32,642 --> 01:36:35,406
他們真是不同凡響 想想在音樂節的成績
Extraordinary! What they'd do at the festival.

1092
01:36:35,645 --> 01:36:38,136
年輕女士，我必須跟你談談
Young lady, I must have a word with you.

1093
01:36:39,148 --> 01:36:43,141
蓋爾，你不能讓她離去的 她必須參加派對
Georg, you won't let this girl get away. She must join the party.

1094
01:36:43,419 --> 01:36:45,819
-不，我真的… -別說了
- No, really l... - Stop. Stop it now.

1095
01:36:46,089 --> 01:36:49,024
-蓋爾，拜託 -如你願意的話，可以留下來
- Georg, please. - You can if you want to, fraulein.

1096
01:36:49,259 --> 01:36:51,750
我堅持，你會是我今晚的女伴
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.

1097
01:36:51,961 --> 01:36:53,861
這是生意 福蘭斯…
This is business. Franz...

1098
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:57,293
在我的座位旁 替?莉亞小姐加一個位子
...set another place next to mine for Fraulein Maria.

1099
01:36:59,469 --> 01:37:02,199
-悉聽尊便 -似乎已安排好了
- Whatever you say. - It appears to be all arranged.

1100
01:37:03,006 --> 01:37:04,871
-是的 -我的打扮不適合
- It does. - I'm not suitably dressed.

1101
01:37:05,942 --> 01:37:07,432
你可以換衣服，我們等你
You can change. We'll wait.

1102
01:37:11,047 --> 01:37:13,982
艦長，你一定 很以你的兒女為榮
Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.

1103
01:37:14,183 --> 01:37:15,047
是的，謝謝你
I am, thank you.

1104
01:37:15,318 --> 01:37:19,880
還有什麼比孩子們純真的歌聲
Is there a more beautiful expression of what is good in our country...

1105
01:37:20,123 --> 01:37:23,559
更能表現我國的優點？
...than the innocent voices of our children?

1106
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,325
對了，男爵
Oh, come now, baron.

1107
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:29,327
你想要我們相信 只有奧地利有獨特高尚的品德？
Would you have us believe that Austria holds a monopoly on virtue?

1108
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:34,363
我們有些人喜歡 悠揚的奧地利歌聲
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer Austrian voices raised in song...

1109
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:36,970
多於醜陋的德國威脅
...to ugly German threats.

1110
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:41,670
鴕鳥喜歡埋首于沙中
The ostrich buries his head in the sand...

1111
01:37:41,878 --> 01:37:44,813
有時藏於國旗裡
...and sometimes in the flag.

1112
01:37:45,348 --> 01:37:49,546
或許有些人警告過你合併就要 來臨了，而事實上是的
Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1113
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:53,516
或許會以音樂來跟你打交道呢
...would get further with you by setting their words to music.

1114
01:37:53,723 --> 01:37:58,387
如果納粹佔據奧地利 你肯定會是整個小號隊
If the Nazis take over Austria, you will be the entire trumpet section.

1115
01:37:58,695 --> 01:37:59,719
你太恭維我了
You flatter me.

1116
01:38:00,763 --> 01:38:04,665
我真笨拙 我是要指責你的
Oh, how clumsy of me. I meant to accuse you.

1117
01:38:12,408 --> 01:38:14,899
你願意來協助我 真的太仁慈了，男爵夫人
It's very kind of you to offer to help me, baroness.

1118
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:16,736
我很樂意
I'm delighted, Maria.

1119
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:20,910
但我實在沒有任何合適的衣服
I really don't think I have anything that would be appropriate.

1120
01:38:21,384 --> 01:38:25,514
那晚你穿的那件迷人衣服呢？
Now where is that lovely little thing you were wearing the other evening?

1121
01:38:25,755 --> 01:38:29,054
使艦長無法將視線從你身上移開
When the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you.

1122
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:34,259
無法轉移他的目光？
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1123
01:38:35,598 --> 01:38:37,395
算了吧，親愛的，我們都是女人
Come, my dear, we are women.

1124
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:41,034
別再假裝我們不知道 男人在注意我們
Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us.

1125
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:44,706
-找到了 -艦長他注意到每個人
- Here we are. - The captain notices everybody.

1126
01:38:45,274 --> 01:38:47,708
你無需如此抗拒的，?莉亞
There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.

1127
01:38:47,944 --> 01:38:50,412
你很迷人，你知道嗎？
You are quite attractive, you know.

1128
01:38:50,646 --> 01:38:54,275
如果艦長不注意你的話 他就不是男人了
The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you.

1129
01:38:55,885 --> 01:38:58,251
男爵夫人，我希望你在開玩笑
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1130
01:38:58,721 --> 01:38:59,983
一點也不
Not at all.

1131
01:39:00,223 --> 01:39:01,815
但我從沒做過任何…
I've never done a thing to...

1132
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:03,649
你無需如此
You don't have to, my dear.

1133
01:39:04,293 --> 01:39:09,128
對男人而言，沒什麼比 深愛自己的女人更無法抗拒
Nothing's more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.

1134
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,834
-愛他嗎？ -是的
- In love with him? - Of course.

1135
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:17,171
最棒的是他也認為自己愛上你了
What makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.

1136
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:21,501
但那不是事實
But that's not true.

1137
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:25,403
你當然也注意到 他直視你雙眼時的神情吧
Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.

1138
01:39:25,681 --> 01:39:30,584
而剛才當他擁著你跳舞時 你臉紅了
And you know, you blushed in his arms when you were dancing just now.

1139
01:39:31,821 --> 01:39:33,516
別太介意
Don't take it to heart.

1140
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:36,088
他很快就會適應的
He'll get over it soon enough, I think.

1141
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:38,327
男人都是如此的
Men do, you know.

1142
01:39:39,328 --> 01:39:40,420
那我必須離開了
Then I should go.

1143
01:39:41,764 --> 01:39:43,197
我不能留在此地
I mustn't stay here.

1144
01:39:53,676 --> 01:39:57,112
-我能幫什麼忙嗎？ -沒有
- Is there something I can do to help? - No, nothing.

1145
01:39:58,881 --> 01:40:00,109
有的
Yes.

1146
01:40:01,117 --> 01:40:03,142
求你別告訴艦長這件事
Don't say a word to the captain.

1147
01:40:04,787 --> 01:40:08,348
不，我不會的
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1148
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:16,689
再見，?莉亞
Goodbye, Maria.

1149
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,298
我相信你會成為很好的修女
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1150
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:52,324
香檳
Champagne, darling.

1151
01:40:52,735 --> 01:40:56,728
我覺得該慶祝一下，乾杯
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1152
01:41:02,211 --> 01:41:05,112
-你知道什麼吧 -或許吧
- You know something. - Perhaps.

1153
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:09,876
若你如此聰明 告訴我如何令?莉亞影響蓋爾
If you're so clever, tell me how to get fraulein to influence Georg.

1154
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:12,747
我要這些孩子參加音樂節
I want those children in the festival.

1155
01:41:13,222 --> 01:41:15,520
這對奧地利深具意義
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1156
01:41:15,725 --> 01:41:17,420
對你也不會有妨害的
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1157
01:41:17,627 --> 01:41:19,219
我曾想過
I thought of that.

1158
01:41:19,462 --> 01:41:21,930
談到影響
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1159
01:41:22,131 --> 01:41:25,032
你該找我談才對
...maybe the one you have to be talking to is me.

1160
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:57,381
-2 -3
- Two. - Three.

1161
01:44:57,654 --> 01:44:59,144
-4 -5
- Four. - Five.

1162
01:45:00,423 --> 01:45:02,448
-6 -7
- Six. - Seven.

1163
01:45:02,725 --> 01:45:04,352
Eight.

1164
01:45:04,594 --> 01:45:06,425
-4 -2
- Four. - Two.

1165
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:09,361
-7 -5
- Seven. - Five.

1166
01:45:09,599 --> 01:45:11,794
-2 -6
- Two. - Six.

1167
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:18,464
真好玩！
Isn't this fun?

1168
01:45:19,876 --> 01:45:22,208
-4 -我是5號
- Four. - I'm number five.

1169
01:45:22,478 --> 01:45:24,639
-是的 -8
- Oh, yes. - Eight.

1170
01:45:24,948 --> 01:45:27,314
-2 -4
- Two. - Four.

1171
01:45:27,717 --> 01:45:28,945
Six.

1172
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:32,649
Two.

1173
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:36,759
男爵夫人，我們累了 不要玩了
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind if we stop now? We're tired.

1174
01:45:36,993 --> 01:45:38,961
隨便你們
Whatever you want, dear.

1175
01:45:39,229 --> 01:45:41,220
明天再玩
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1176
01:45:51,407 --> 01:45:53,568
鄉間真安靜，是不是？
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1177
01:45:54,611 --> 01:45:56,238
喝點檸檬水吧
Have some lemonade.

1178
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,913
一定有更容易的辦法
There must be an easier way.

1179
01:46:00,316 --> 01:46:03,581
想到你做七個孩子的母親 真令我哭笑不得
I get a fiendish delight thinking of you as the mother of seven.

1180
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,351
你計畫如何做呢？
How do you plan to do it?

1181
01:46:06,623 --> 01:46:08,648
你沒聽過
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1182
01:46:08,925 --> 01:46:12,019
寄宿學校嗎？
...of a delightful little thing called boarding school?

1183
01:46:13,162 --> 01:46:15,426
你真是詭計多端
Baroness Machiavelli.

1184
01:46:16,766 --> 01:46:18,757
麥伯伯，爸爸在哪？
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1185
01:46:19,035 --> 01:46:20,832
我想他在屋子裡
I think he's in the house.

1186
01:46:21,037 --> 01:46:23,597
你們為何都悶悶不樂呢？
What's the matter with all you gloomy pussies?

1187
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,638
-沒什麼 -我知道怎麼辦，我們來做排練
- Nothing. - I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1188
01:46:26,843 --> 01:46:27,741
為了什麼呢？
What for?

1189
01:46:27,944 --> 01:46:30,435
假裝站在節慶的表演臺上
Let's make believe we're on-stage at the festival.

1190
01:46:30,647 --> 01:46:34,515
-我不想唱 -沒有?莉亞我不想唱
- I don't feel like singing. - Not without Fraulein Maria.

1191
01:46:34,784 --> 01:46:37,184
莉莎去拿吉他，來吧
Liesl, get the guitar. Come on, Marta.

1192
01:46:37,387 --> 01:46:40,356
大家站好，各就各位
Everybody into the group. Get in your places.

1193
01:46:40,623 --> 01:46:43,387
高興點 麗莎，給我們調子
Now be cheerful, right? Give us the key, Liesl.

1194
01:46:45,295 --> 01:46:47,957
現在，開始
Now, impress me.

1195
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:53,299
葛特兒，你為何不唱呢？
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1196
01:46:53,569 --> 01:46:56,037
我手指痛不能唱
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1197
01:46:57,073 --> 01:47:00,133
但是你在舞會中唱得很好
But you sang so beautifully the night of the party.

1198
01:47:00,343 --> 01:47:02,675
來，試試看 唱些你們都懂的
Come on, all of you. Try something you know.

1199
01:47:02,912 --> 01:47:04,402
好好享受，快樂些
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1200
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:06,308
好了，莉莎
All right, Liesl.

1201
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:13,655
群山因為音樂
The hills are alive

1202
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:21,558
充滿生氣
With the sound of music

1203
01:47:22,765 --> 01:47:27,828
唱了
With songs they have sung

1204
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:35,910
千年的歌
For a thousand years

1205
01:47:36,612 --> 01:47:42,016
群山讓我的心中
The hills fill my heart

1206
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:49,953
充滿了音樂
With the sound of music

1207
01:47:50,293 --> 01:47:52,921
他們是唱給我聽
They wanted to sing for me, bless their hearts.

1208
01:47:53,229 --> 01:47:55,129
很好…別停下來
That's lovely, lovely. Don't stop.

1209
01:47:59,135 --> 01:48:03,037
-你喝點飲料吧 -不，謝謝，親愛的
- Something long and cool, Georg? - No, thank you, darling.

1210
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:05,873
-爸爸 -是的，碧姬塔
- Father? - Yes, Brigitta?

1211
01:48:06,309 --> 01:48:08,573
?莉亞不回來嗎？
Is it true Fraulein Maria isn't coming back?

1212
01:48:08,878 --> 01:48:11,972
是的，我想是不回來了 有什麼好喝嗎？
Yes, I suppose it's true. What have we got here?

1213
01:48:12,281 --> 01:48:16,980
-粉紅檸檬水 -是檸檬水
- Pink lemonade. - Laced with lemonade.

1214
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,244
父親，我不敢相信
I don't believe it, Father.

1215
01:48:20,623 --> 01:48:22,648
-不相信什麼？ -關於?莉亞
- What? - About Fraulein Maria.

1216
01:48:23,059 --> 01:48:24,287
哦，?莉亞
Oh, Fraulein Maria!

1217
01:48:24,594 --> 01:48:28,052
我沒把她的留言告訴你們嗎？ 我肯定我說過了
Didn't I tell you what her note said? I'm sure I did.

1218
01:48:28,798 --> 01:48:31,289
她說她很懷念修道院的生活
She said she missed her life at the abbey.

1219
01:48:31,567 --> 01:48:33,728
她必須離開我們
She had to leave us.

1220
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:35,562
就這樣
And that's all there is to it.

1221
01:48:37,273 --> 01:48:39,969
好，我現在想嘗點檸檬水
I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.

1222
01:48:40,176 --> 01:48:42,906
-她甚至沒有告別 -她在留言上有說
- She didn't even say goodbye. - She did in her note.

1223
01:48:43,179 --> 01:48:44,976
那是不同的事
That isn't the same thing.

1224
01:48:45,281 --> 01:48:46,908
不甜不酸
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1225
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:49,641
只是太粉紅了
Just too pink.

1226
01:48:51,087 --> 01:48:54,181
父親，誰是我們的新家庭老師？
Father, who is our new governess going to be?

1227
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:01,922
這個…
Well...

1228
01:49:04,267 --> 01:49:09,500
你們再也沒有新家庭老師了
...you're not going to have a governess anymore.

1229
01:49:09,839 --> 01:49:12,501
-我們沒有？ -沒有
- We're not? - No.

1230
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:16,837
你們將要有個新媽媽
You're going to have a new mother.

1231
01:49:17,947 --> 01:49:19,972
一個新媽媽？
A new mother?

1232
01:49:20,817 --> 01:49:23,945
我們昨晚談過了 一切都決定好了
We talked about it last night. It's all settled.

1233
01:49:24,153 --> 01:49:26,849
我們都將會很快樂
And we're all going to be very happy.

1234
01:49:59,856 --> 01:50:02,324
好了…去玩吧
Well, all right, all right. Run off and play.

1235
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:35,257
是的，孩子們
Yes, my children?

1236
01:50:35,458 --> 01:50:37,858
-我叫莉莎 -怎麼了，麗莎？
- My name is Liesl. - Yes, Liesl?

1237
01:50:38,361 --> 01:50:42,297
我們，我的兄弟姐妹們 要見?莉亞小姐
We, my brothers and sisters, want to see Fraulein Maria.

1238
01:50:43,466 --> 01:50:45,457
?莉亞小姐？
Fraulein Maria?

1239
01:50:46,235 --> 01:50:48,203
哦，?莉亞
Oh, Maria.

1240
01:50:50,106 --> 01:50:51,937
請進來
Come in, please.

1241
01:50:55,811 --> 01:50:57,369
在此等一下
Wait here.

1242
01:51:08,324 --> 01:51:11,487
我是?格麗特修女 我知道你們想見?莉亞
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand you inquired about Maria.

1243
01:51:11,761 --> 01:51:14,252
我們必須見她 請你告訴她我們在此
We have to see her. Will you tell her we're here?

1244
01:51:14,497 --> 01:51:17,091
-恐怕我做不到 -你一定要告訴她
- I'm afraid I can't do that. - But you've got to!

1245
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,459
-她是我們的家庭教師 -我們要她回來
- She's our governess. - We want her back.

1246
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:21,569
她甚至沒有道別
She didn't even say goodbye.

1247
01:51:21,804 --> 01:51:23,567
我們想要做的只是和她說話
All we want to do is talk to her.

1248
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:27,241
我很抱歉，孩子們 但是?莉亞在靜修
I'm very sorry, but Maria is in seclusion.

1249
01:51:27,476 --> 01:51:30,570
-她不願見任何人 -她會見我們的
- She hasn't been seeing anyone. - She'll see us.

1250
01:51:30,813 --> 01:51:33,304
我要讓她看我的手指
I want to show her my finger.

1251
01:51:33,516 --> 01:51:35,416
親愛的，改天吧
Some other time, dear.

1252
01:51:35,685 --> 01:51:36,982
我會告訴她，你們來過
I'll tell her you were here.

1253
01:51:37,253 --> 01:51:40,313
-很高興你們來過 -我們要見?莉亞
- It was sweet of you to call. - We have to speak to her!

1254
01:51:40,957 --> 01:51:44,085
孩子們，回家吧
Run along, children. Run along home.

1255
01:51:44,293 --> 01:51:45,920
我肯定她會見我們
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1256
01:51:46,195 --> 01:51:48,459
求求你啊
Sister Margaretta, please.

1257
01:51:48,698 --> 01:51:52,429
-再見，孩子們 -求求你啊
- Goodbye, children. - Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1258
01:51:55,204 --> 01:51:56,933
那是怎麼回事，?格麗特修女？
What was that about, Sister?

1259
01:51:57,173 --> 01:51:59,368
院長，范崔普家的孩子
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.

1260
01:51:59,609 --> 01:52:02,043
他們要見?莉亞
They want to see Maria.

1261
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:04,609
她說了沒？ 她有沒有告訴你什麼事？
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?

1262
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,873
院長，除了祈禱外 她什麼也沒說
She doesn't say a word, Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1263
01:52:09,151 --> 01:52:10,140
可憐的孩子
Poor child.

1264
01:52:10,353 --> 01:52:13,322
很奇怪，她似乎很高興能回來
It's strange. She seems happy to be back here...

1265
01:52:13,556 --> 01:52:16,855
但同時又很不快樂
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1266
01:52:18,127 --> 01:52:21,187
或許讓她一個人那麼久 是錯誤的
Perhaps I have been wrong in leaving her alone so long.

1267
01:52:21,464 --> 01:52:24,160
我想你最好把她帶來見我 即使她還沒準備好
Bring her to me, even if she's not yet ready.

1268
01:52:24,367 --> 01:52:26,028
是的，院長
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1269
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:35,032
加絲特修女 帶這位新姐妹到更衣室
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant to the robing room.

1270
01:52:36,045 --> 01:52:38,309
願上帝祝福你，我的女兒
God bless you, my daughter.

1271
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,249
是的，帶她進來
Yes, bring her in.

1272
01:52:55,264 --> 01:52:57,528
你很不快樂，我很難過
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1273
01:52:59,568 --> 01:53:00,762
院長
Reverend Mother.

1274
01:53:01,103 --> 01:53:03,731
他們為何要你回來？
Why did they send you back to us?

1275
01:53:04,573 --> 01:53:06,541
他們沒有要我走 是我主動離開的
They didn't send me back. I left.

1276
01:53:09,045 --> 01:53:10,603
坐下，?莉亞
Sit down, Maria.

1277
01:53:11,113 --> 01:53:12,910
告訴我事情的始末
Tell me what happened.

1278
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,451
是因為我害怕
I was frightened.

1279
01:53:19,722 --> 01:53:24,182
-害怕，是不是他們對你不好？ -哦，不是
- Frightened? Were they unkind to you. - Oh, no!

1280
01:53:24,427 --> 01:53:28,124
我很迷惑，我…
No, I was confused. I felt...

1281
01:53:29,598 --> 01:53:31,691
我從未有那種感覺
I've never felt that way before.

1282
01:53:31,934 --> 01:53:35,700
我不能留下來 我知道遠離他們會比較安全
I couldn't stay. I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1283
01:53:35,938 --> 01:53:40,637
?莉亞，我們的修道院 不是用來逃避的
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.

1284
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:43,140
是什麼事令你無法面對？
What is it you can't face?

1285
01:53:45,114 --> 01:53:46,547
我無法再面對他
I can't face him again.

1286
01:53:47,383 --> 01:53:48,907
他？
Him?

1287
01:53:50,486 --> 01:53:52,545
謝謝你，?格麗特修女
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1288
01:54:02,164 --> 01:54:03,791
是范崔普先生？
Captain von Trapp?

1289
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:11,934
-你是否愛上他了？ -我不知道
- Are you in love with him? - I don't know!

1290
01:54:12,174 --> 01:54:13,641
我不知道…
I don't know. L...

1291
01:54:14,176 --> 01:54:18,010
男爵夫人，她說他愛上我了
The baroness said I was. She said that he was in love with me.

1292
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,942
但我不願相信
But I didn't want to believe it.

1293
01:54:22,017 --> 01:54:24,315
當我們彼此對看時
There were times we looked at each other.

1294
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,078
我簡直不能呼吸
I could hardly breathe.

1295
01:54:26,455 --> 01:54:29,151
-你讓他知道你的感受了嗎？ -我不知道
- Did you let him see your feelings? - I don't know.

1296
01:54:29,759 --> 01:54:32,421
這正是折磨我的原因 我是侍奉神的
That's what's torturing me. I was on God's errand.

1297
01:54:32,628 --> 01:54:37,622
愛他是錯的，我不能留下
To have asked for his love would have been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1298
01:54:39,802 --> 01:54:42,600
我已作好發誓的準備
I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.

1299
01:54:43,472 --> 01:54:46,532
-請幫助我 -?莉亞
- Please help me. - Maria.

1300
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:52,809
男女之間的愛也是神聖的 你是可以去愛的
The love of a man and a woman is holy. You have a great capacity to love.

1301
01:54:53,048 --> 01:54:55,983
你必須瞭解 上帝是要你如何去愛
You must find out how God wants you to spend your love.

1302
01:54:56,285 --> 01:55:00,119
但我已獻身上帝 我要終生為上帝服務
But I pledged my life to God. I pledged my life to his service.

1303
01:55:00,322 --> 01:55:04,691
我的女兒，如果你愛這個人 並不表示你就要少愛上帝了
My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.

1304
01:55:06,362 --> 01:55:08,227
不
No.

1305
01:55:08,464 --> 01:55:10,329
你必須找出答案
You must find out.

1306
01:55:12,067 --> 01:55:14,558
你必須要回去
You must go back.

1307
01:55:14,837 --> 01:55:16,805
你不能要求我這樣做
You can't ask me to do that.

1308
01:55:17,006 --> 01:55:19,497
-拜託你，讓我留下，我求求你 -?莉亞
- Please let me stay. I beg... - Maria.

1309
01:55:19,708 --> 01:55:23,667
這些牆並不是 建造來逃避問題的
These walls were not built to shut out problems.

1310
01:55:23,879 --> 01:55:25,471
你必須面對它
You have to face them.

1311
01:55:26,048 --> 01:55:29,313
你要過你本來就應過的生活
You have to live the life you were born to live.

1312
01:55:35,191 --> 01:55:39,491
攀登每座山
Climb every mountain

1313
01:55:39,728 --> 01:55:43,494
尋遍高與低
Search high and low

1314
01:55:43,732 --> 01:55:48,499
踏遍每條僻路
Follow every byway

1315
01:55:48,737 --> 01:55:53,003
踏遍每條路
Every path you know

1316
01:55:53,442 --> 01:55:57,902
攀登每座山
Climb every mountain

1317
01:55:58,180 --> 01:56:02,514
涉過每條小溪
Ford every stream

1318
01:56:02,751 --> 01:56:07,120
跟隨每道彩虹
Follow every rainbow

1319
01:56:07,389 --> 01:56:11,723
直至找到你的美夢
Till you find your dream

1320
01:56:11,927 --> 01:56:15,021
這美夢需要你
A dream that will need

1321
01:56:15,264 --> 01:56:20,099
獻出全部的愛
All the love you can give

1322
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:24,271
在你有生之年
Every day of your life

1323
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:30,945
一直下去
For as long as you live

1324
01:56:31,247 --> 01:56:35,547
攀登每座山
Climb every mountain

1325
01:56:35,784 --> 01:56:40,118
涉過每條小溪
Ford every stream

1326
01:56:40,389 --> 01:56:44,951
跟隨每道彩虹
Follow every rainbow

1327
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:53,568
直至找到你的美夢
Till you find your dream

1328
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:58,162
這美夢需要你
A dream that will need

1329
01:56:58,474 --> 01:57:04,003
獻出全部的愛
All the love you can give

1330
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:07,772
在你有生之年
Every day of your life

1331
01:57:08,017 --> 01:57:14,445
一直下去
For as long as you live

1332
01:57:14,690 --> 01:57:19,127
攀登每座山
Climb every mountain

1333
01:57:19,361 --> 01:57:23,297
涉過每條小溪
Ford every stream

1334
01:57:23,966 --> 01:57:28,596
跟隨每道彩虹
Follow every rainbow

1335
01:57:29,004 --> 01:57:33,100
直至找到
Till you find...

1336
01:57:33,342 --> 01:57:43,343
你的美夢
...your dream

1337
01:57:45,888 --> 01:57:49,449
這樣神神秘秘的 不像我的孩子
Now, it's not like my children to be secretive.

1338
01:57:49,692 --> 01:57:51,785
我們才不神秘，爸爸
We're not being secretive, Father.

1339
01:57:53,462 --> 01:57:56,795
吃飯遲到也不像我的孩子
And it's not like my children to be late for dinner.

1340
01:57:57,066 --> 01:58:00,502
-我們忘了時間而已 -我知道了
- We lost track of the time. - I see.

1341
01:58:01,303 --> 01:58:04,704
好了，誰要第一個告訴我事實？ 費瑞克
Who's going to be the first one to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1342
01:58:04,974 --> 01:58:07,033
碧姬塔，莉莎
Brigitta. Liesl.

1343
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:10,640
你認為我們去哪了？
Where do you think we were, Father?

1344
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:21,178
如果你不相信我們 你一定是對於我們去哪有點頭緒吧
If you don't believe us, you must have some idea of where you think we were.

1345
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,557
-?塔 -是的，爸爸
- Marta. - Yes, Father.

1346
01:58:26,762 --> 01:58:28,024
你來告訴我
You tell me.

1347
01:58:29,365 --> 01:58:32,994
費瑞克告訴過你，爸爸 我們去采草莓了
Friedrich told you, Father. We were berry picking.

1348
01:58:33,836 --> 01:58:38,500
-我忘了！你們去采草莓 -是呀，我們很喜歡采草莓
- I forgot! You were berry picking. - Yes, we love berry picking.

1349
01:58:38,741 --> 01:58:39,833
整個下午？
All afternoon?

1350
01:58:40,075 --> 01:58:41,804
-是的，我們采了幾千顆 -幾千顆？
- We picked thousands. - Thousands?

1351
01:58:42,011 --> 01:58:44,912
-四處也是呢 -哪一種草莓？
- They were all over the place. - What kind of berries?

1352
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:48,445
-是藍草莓，先生 -藍草莓
- Blueberries, sir. - Blueberries.

1353
01:58:50,386 --> 01:58:53,753
藍草莓的季節還沒到
It's too early for blueberries.

1354
01:58:55,257 --> 01:58:57,350
-是草莓 -草莓？
- They were strawberries. - Strawberries?

1355
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:00,756
最近很冷 所以它們變成藍色了
It's been so cold lately, they turned blue.

1356
01:59:06,602 --> 01:59:08,763
很好，讓我看草莓
Very well. Show me the berries.

1357
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:11,233
-我們… -這個…
- We... - Well...

1358
01:59:11,473 --> 01:59:14,237
-快讓我看草莓 -我們沒有
- Show me the berries you picked. - We don't have them.

1359
01:59:14,476 --> 01:59:16,740
你們沒有？發生了什麼事？
You don't have them? What happened to them?

1360
01:59:16,979 --> 01:59:19,777
-我們… -我們吃了
- We... - We ate them.

1361
01:59:19,982 --> 01:59:22,576
-你們吃了它們？ -是啊
- You ate them? - Yes!

1362
01:59:22,785 --> 01:59:24,377
-它們很好吃 -很好吃
- They were so good. - Delicious.

1363
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:25,814
非常好
Very well.

1364
01:59:26,088 --> 01:59:31,219
既然你們吃了幾千顆的草莓
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves on thousands of berries...

1365
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:35,396
你們不可能肚子餓了 所以我可以告訴思蜜德
...you can't be hungry anymore, so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1366
01:59:35,631 --> 01:59:38,498
不用煮你們的晚餐
...to skip your dinner.

1367
01:59:47,676 --> 01:59:50,474
都是你的錯 我們應該老實告訴他
It's your fault. We should have told him the truth.

1368
01:59:50,746 --> 01:59:52,714
讓他生我們的氣嗎？
And made him boiling mad at us?

1369
01:59:52,915 --> 01:59:54,849
總比餓死好
It's better than starving to death.

1370
01:59:55,084 --> 01:59:57,951
我們沒有做錯什麼 我們只是想見她
We didn't do anything wrong. We just wanted to see her.

1371
01:59:59,254 --> 02:00:02,348
我的肚子在咕咕叫
My stomach's making noises.

1372
02:00:02,791 --> 02:00:05,624
他們至少可以 讓我們向她打個招呼
The least they could have done was to let us say hello.

1373
02:00:06,762 --> 02:00:10,664
-我們不如吃草吧 -我很不開心
- I wonder what grass tastes like. - I feel awful.

1374
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:15,366
?莉亞不開心時便會唱那首歌 讓自己心情好轉的
When Fraulein Maria wanted to feel better she used to sing that song.

1375
02:00:15,971 --> 02:00:17,438
我們唱唱看
Let's try it.

1376
02:00:17,673 --> 02:00:20,335
玫瑰上的雨露
Raindrops on roses

1377
02:00:20,642 --> 02:00:24,669
小貓的鬍鬚
And whiskers on kittens

1378
02:00:25,514 --> 02:00:28,108
光亮的銅壺
Bright copper kettles

1379
02:00:28,317 --> 02:00:31,377
溫暖的羊毛手套
And warm woolen mittens

1380
02:00:32,721 --> 02:00:38,682
有細繩的褐色包裝紙
Brown paper packages Tied up with strings

1381
02:00:38,961 --> 02:00:44,957
這些都是我心愛的事物
These are a few of my favorite things

1382
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,225
為什麼我的心情沒有好起來？
Why don't I feel better?

1383
02:00:48,403 --> 02:00:50,701
女孩們穿著白裙
Girls in white dresses

1384
02:00:50,973 --> 02:00:54,067
佩著藍緞帶
With blue satin sashes

1385
02:00:54,343 --> 02:00:59,975
雪花落在我的鼻子和睫毛上
Snowflakes that stay On my nose and eyelashes

1386
02:01:00,349 --> 02:01:03,512
-銀白色的冬天… -?莉亞小姐回來了
- Silver white winters... - Fraulein Maria's back!

1387
02:01:03,719 --> 02:01:05,016
溶化成春天
...that melt into springs

1388
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:08,685
這些都是我喜愛的事物
These are a few of my favorite things

1389
02:01:08,924 --> 02:01:12,018
當狗咬時，當蜂蟄時
When the dog bites When the bee stings

1390
02:01:12,227 --> 02:01:14,354
當我感覺傷心時
When I'm feeling sad

1391
02:01:14,863 --> 02:01:17,832
只要想起我最喜愛的事物
I simply remember my favorite things

1392
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:20,364
我的心情就不會…
And then I don't feel

1393
02:01:20,569 --> 02:01:27,338
如此糟了
So bad

1394
02:01:27,576 --> 02:01:30,602
-孩子們，看到你們真高興 -我們很想念你
- Children, I'm so glad to see you. - We missed you.

1395
02:01:30,846 --> 02:01:31,835
我想念你們
I missed you.

1396
02:01:32,114 --> 02:01:34,241
-寇特，你好嗎？ -很餓
- Kurt, how are you? - Hungry.

1397
02:01:35,784 --> 02:01:38,412
-葛特兒，你的手指怎麼了？ -被割傷了
- What happened to your finger? - It got caught.

1398
02:01:38,687 --> 02:01:40,848
-被什麼割的？ -費端克的牙齒
- Caught in what? - Friedrich's teeth.

1399
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:44,251
-莉莎，你好嗎？ -還好啦
- Liesl, you all right? - Just fair.

1400
02:01:44,459 --> 02:01:47,451
-最近有沒有電報來？ -什麼都沒有
- Any telegrams been delivered lately? - None at all.

1401
02:01:47,696 --> 02:01:51,132
但是我在學習接受現實 我在期待學校開學的日子
But I'm learning to accept it. I'll be glad when school begins.

1402
02:01:51,433 --> 02:01:56,132
莉莎，你不能用學校作為逃避 問題的地方，你必須面對問題
Liesl, you can't use school to escape your problems. You have to face them.

1403
02:01:56,371 --> 02:01:57,804
我要告訴你們很多事
I have so much to tell you.

1404
02:01:58,073 --> 02:02:00,064
我們也有許多事要告訴你
We have things to tell you too.

1405
02:02:00,409 --> 02:02:04,106
最重要的是，爸爸要結婚了
The most important thing is that Father is going to be married.

1406
02:02:04,313 --> 02:02:05,371
結婚？
Married?

1407
02:02:05,714 --> 02:02:07,739
是的，是和男爵夫人
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1408
02:02:15,657 --> 02:02:17,215
哦，我知道了
Oh, I see.

1409
02:02:19,061 --> 02:02:22,428
爸爸，看！ ?莉亞回來了！
Father, look! Fraulein Maria's back!

1410
02:02:22,664 --> 02:02:24,723
?莉亞從修道院回來了
Fraulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1411
02:02:26,935 --> 02:02:27,993
艦長你好
Good evening, captain.

1412
02:02:29,471 --> 02:02:30,768
你好
Good evening.

1413
02:02:33,308 --> 02:02:35,139
大家都進去吃晚餐
Everyone inside for dinner.

1414
02:02:35,444 --> 02:02:37,002
晚飯，太好了！
Dinner!

1415
02:02:46,355 --> 02:02:51,088
你不辭而別 甚至沒向小孩們道別
You left without saying goodbye. Even to the children.

1416
02:02:52,094 --> 02:02:53,618
是我的錯，請原諒我
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1417
02:02:55,664 --> 02:02:56,824
為什麼要如此？
Why did you?

1418
02:02:57,032 --> 02:02:59,865
請不要問我 反正原因已經不存在了
Please don't ask me. The reason no longer exists.

1419
02:03:01,036 --> 02:03:04,130
?莉亞小姐，你回來了
Fraulein Maria, you've returned.

1420
02:03:05,374 --> 02:03:07,171
蓋爾，這不是很好嗎？
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1421
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:12,709
男爵夫人，我祝福你幸福快樂
I wish you every happiness, baroness.

1422
02:03:12,948 --> 02:03:15,644
你也是，艦長 孩子們告訴我你們要結婚了
You too, captain. The children say you're to marry.

1423
02:03:15,884 --> 02:03:17,010
謝謝你，親愛的
Thank you, my dear.

1424
02:03:19,554 --> 02:03:23,115
你會留下嗎？
You are back to stay?

1425
02:03:25,193 --> 02:03:28,526
只待到下一位老師來為止
Only until arrangements can be made for another governess.

1426
02:04:24,219 --> 02:04:25,846
原來你在這裡
There you are.

1427
02:04:40,235 --> 02:04:42,703
我真的要跟你的廚師談談
I must speak to cook about the schnitzel.

1428
02:04:42,971 --> 02:04:46,270
食物太好吃會影響我的身材
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.

1429
02:04:46,708 --> 02:04:49,643
也讓你在餐桌上 沒說很多話
And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.

1430
02:04:49,911 --> 02:04:51,902
是不是酒的關係？
Or was it the wine?

1431
02:04:52,147 --> 02:04:53,978
一定是
Undoubtedly the wine.

1432
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:58,815
你不知道為了要送你
You have no idea the trouble I'm having...

1433
02:04:59,087 --> 02:05:01,817
一件結婚禮物 我費盡了多少心思
...trying to decide on a wedding present for you.

1434
02:05:02,124 --> 02:05:04,285
我明白，你有我已經足夠
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1435
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:08,154
但是我一定要送你點小玩意
But I do want you to have some little trifle for the occasion.

1436
02:05:08,397 --> 02:05:10,729
我首先想到的是鋼筆
At first I thought of a fountain pen...

1437
02:05:10,966 --> 02:05:13,230
但是你已有一支
...but you've already got one.

1438
02:05:13,502 --> 02:05:16,437
然後我想送你 一幢法國南部的別墅
Then I thought perhaps a villa in the south of France...

1439
02:05:16,671 --> 02:05:19,333
但是它很難包裝起來
...but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.

1440
02:05:19,608 --> 02:05:22,008
你覺得遊艇好嗎？
Oh, Georg, how do you feel about yachts?

1441
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:24,574
可以暢遊地中海的那種
A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean...

1442
02:05:24,813 --> 02:05:27,577
或是放在浴缸中的那種
...or a tiny one for your bathtub, huh?

1443
02:05:29,751 --> 02:05:31,776
-艾莎 -我們要去哪渡蜜月？
- Elsa. - Where to go on our honeymoon?

1444
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:33,612
這可真是個難題了
Now, that's a real problem.

1445
02:05:33,822 --> 02:05:37,189
我想環遊世界會很棒
A trip around the world would be lovely. And then I said:

1446
02:05:37,492 --> 02:05:40,325
但一定會有更好的地方可以去
"Oh, Elsa, there must be someplace better to go."

1447
02:05:40,595 --> 02:05:43,029
-但別擔心… -艾莎
- But don't worry, darling, I'Il... - Elsa.

1448
02:05:43,698 --> 02:05:44,960
是的
Yes, Georg.

1449
02:05:45,967 --> 02:05:47,298
這是沒有用的
It's no use...

1450
02:05:48,503 --> 02:05:49,868
你和我的關係
...you and I.

1451
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:54,671
我一直都沒有坦誠面對
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1452
02:05:56,011 --> 02:05:57,672
你和我的關係
...and utterly unfair to you.

1453
02:06:02,951 --> 02:06:05,681
-當兩個人談論到婚嫁時 -不要
- When two people talk of marriage... - No, don't.

1454
02:06:06,555 --> 02:06:08,648
不要再說了，拜託你
Don't say another word, please.

1455
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:16,988
我也在想其他的事
You see, there are other things I've been thinking of.

1456
02:06:17,899 --> 02:06:22,632
雖然我喜歡你 但是我真的不認為你適合我
Fond as I am of you, I really don't think you're the right man for me.

1457
02:06:25,173 --> 02:06:27,664
你太獨立了
You're much too independent.

1458
02:06:27,976 --> 02:06:32,675
而我要一個非常需要我的人
And I need someone who needs me desperately...

1459
02:06:32,981 --> 02:06:35,973
或最起碼是非常需要我的錢
...or at least needs my money desperately.

1460
02:06:38,153 --> 02:06:43,056
我們在一起的每一分鐘 我都很快樂，為此我謝謝你
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together and I do thank you for that.

1461
02:06:45,827 --> 02:06:47,727
失陪一下
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1462
02:06:47,929 --> 02:06:49,988
我現在要進去 收拾我的行李
...I'll go inside, pack my little bags...

1463
02:06:50,232 --> 02:06:52,723
回到我原屬的地方，維也納
...and return to Vienna where I belong.

1464
02:06:58,106 --> 02:06:59,937
那邊有個人
And somewhere out there...

1465
02:07:00,242 --> 02:07:04,611
是位年輕小姐，我想
...is a young lady who, I think...

1466
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,108
她做不成修女了
...will never be a nun.

1467
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:20,592
親愛的，再見了
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1468
02:07:46,321 --> 02:07:47,481
哈囉
Hello.

1469
02:07:53,295 --> 02:07:56,890
我想我可能會在這裡找到你
I thought I just might find you here.

1470
02:08:01,069 --> 02:08:03,333
你有什麼事找我嗎？
Was there something you wanted?

1471
02:08:03,772 --> 02:08:06,900
沒有，沒有，請坐下
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1472
02:08:07,842 --> 02:08:09,173
請坐
Please.

1473
02:08:14,316 --> 02:08:15,647
我可以坐嗎？
May I?

1474
02:08:28,029 --> 02:08:32,762
我在想… 在思索兩件事情
You know, I was thinking and I was wondering two things:

1475
02:08:33,935 --> 02:08:38,167
為什麼你逃回修道院？
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1476
02:08:39,007 --> 02:08:43,671
還有，是什麼事又讓你回來？
And what was it that made you come back?

1477
02:08:45,347 --> 02:08:49,807
這個，我有責任要完成
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill...

1478
02:08:50,018 --> 02:08:52,145
我回來履行的
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1479
02:08:52,787 --> 02:08:54,220
只是這樣嗎？
Is that all?

1480
02:08:55,557 --> 02:08:57,718
還有，我想念孩子們
And I missed the children.

1481
02:08:58,059 --> 02:08:59,219
是的
Yes.

1482
02:09:00,495 --> 02:09:03,396
-只有小孩們？ -不…是的
- Only the children? - No. Yes.

1483
02:09:03,632 --> 02:09:07,466
-我可以想念他們，對嗎？ -對…當然可以了
- Isn't it right that I missed them? - Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1484
02:09:07,669 --> 02:09:10,297
我只是想你或許會…
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1485
02:09:11,406 --> 02:09:13,169
或許你會…
Perhaps you might...

1486
02:09:14,909 --> 02:09:16,137
怎樣？
Yes?

1487
02:09:17,912 --> 02:09:23,214
這個… 當你離開後一切都變了
Well, nothing was the same when you were away...

1488
02:09:23,985 --> 02:09:27,216
如果你又再離去 我們又會再度失落
...and it'll be all wrong again after you leave...

1489
02:09:27,422 --> 02:09:32,086
我只是想 也許你可以改變心意留下來
...and I just thought perhaps you might change your mind.

1490
02:09:36,164 --> 02:09:40,396
我想男爵夫人一定會把 一切的事情都安排得很好
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.

1491
02:09:40,669 --> 02:09:42,000
?莉亞
Maria...

1492
02:09:44,105 --> 02:09:47,597
-再也沒有什麼男爵夫人了 -沒有了嗎？
- There isn't going to be any baroness. - There isn't?

1493
02:09:50,011 --> 02:09:51,376
沒有
No.

1494
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,443
我不明白
I don't understand.

1495
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:59,946
我們已經解除婚約了
Well, we've called off our engagement, you see, and...

1496
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:03,679
-我很難過 -對，真的嗎？
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Yes. You are?

1497
02:10:04,859 --> 02:10:06,952
-真的？ -是的
- You did? - Yes.

1498
02:10:08,096 --> 02:10:12,624
你不能和一個人結婚…
Well, you can't marry someone when you're...

1499
02:10:15,203 --> 02:10:17,262
卻又愛著另一個人
...in love with someone else...

1500
02:10:20,642 --> 02:10:22,075
你可以嗎？
...can you?

1501
02:10:56,945 --> 02:10:59,243
院長常說
The Reverend Mother always says:

1502
02:10:59,481 --> 02:11:02,917
“當主關上門時 他會在某處打開窗子的”
"When the Lord closes a door, somewhere He opens a window."

1503
02:11:11,006 --> 02:11:14,032
院長還說了什麼？
What else does the Reverend Mother say?

1504
02:11:14,976 --> 02:11:17,376
你需要尋求你自己的生命
That you have to look for your life.

1505
02:11:19,047 --> 02:11:21,607
這是不是你回來的原因？
Is that why you came back?

1506
02:11:25,654 --> 02:11:27,121
你找到了嗎？
And have you found it...

1507
02:11:28,123 --> 02:11:29,283
?莉亞
...Maria?

1508
02:11:31,059 --> 02:11:33,050
我想我找到了
I think I have.

1509
02:11:35,797 --> 02:11:37,196
我知道我已找到了
I know I have.

1510
02:11:39,701 --> 02:11:41,362
我愛你
I love you.

1511
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:47,205
這種事情會發生在我身上嗎？
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1512
02:11:50,579 --> 02:11:55,983
或許我的童年是不愉快的
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

1513
02:11:57,486 --> 02:12:02,719
或許我的青春期是悲慘的
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

1514
02:12:04,593 --> 02:12:10,532
但在我又不愉快 又可悲的過去
But somewhere In my wicked, miserable past

1515
02:12:11,032 --> 02:12:16,834
卻總有一刻是真實的
There must have been a moment of truth

1516
02:12:17,772 --> 02:12:24,541
你就站在這裡 愛著我
For here you are Standing there loving me

1517
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:31,276
不管應該與否
Whether or not you should

1518
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:38,723
因此在我的童年或少年時
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1519
02:12:39,594 --> 02:12:47,228
一定是做過了什麼好事
I must have done something good

1520
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:51,439
萬事皆有因
Nothing comes from nothing

1521
02:12:52,574 --> 02:12:56,442
不會無中生有
Nothing ever could

1522
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:06,153
因此在我的童年或少年時
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1523
02:13:07,722 --> 02:13:17,222
一定是做過了什麼好事
I must have done something good

1524
02:13:18,099 --> 02:13:22,934
你知道我是何時開始 愛上你的？
Do you know when I first started loving you?

1525
02:13:23,338 --> 02:13:27,240
那天晚餐 你坐在那可笑的松果上
That night at dinner, when you sat on that ridiculous pine cone.

1526
02:13:27,475 --> 02:13:28,772
什麼？
What?

1527
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:33,569
當你吹著那個傻哨子時 我就愛上你了
I knew the first time you blew that silly whistle.

1528
02:13:34,482 --> 02:13:36,473
哦，我的愛
Oh, my love.

1529
02:13:40,255 --> 02:13:48,162
你就站在這裡 愛著我
For here you are Standing there loving me

1530
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:55,967
不管應該與否
Whether or not you should

1531
02:13:57,339 --> 02:14:04,370
因此在我的童年或少年時
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1532
02:14:05,180 --> 02:14:12,882
一定是做過了什麼好事
I must have done something good

1533
02:14:14,055 --> 02:14:17,547
萬事皆有因
Nothing comes from nothing

1534
02:14:18,293 --> 02:14:21,319
不會無中生有
Nothing ever could

1535
02:14:21,563 --> 02:14:27,365
因此在我的童年…
So somewhere in my youth...

1536
02:14:27,636 --> 02:14:29,866
或少年時
...or childhood

1537
02:14:32,974 --> 02:14:39,504
一定是做過了
I must have done something

1538
02:14:41,549 --> 02:14:54,189
什麼好事
Something good

1539
02:15:00,902 --> 02:15:02,426
?莉亞
Maria.

1540
02:15:04,272 --> 02:15:08,868
我要徵求誰的同意才能娶你？
Is there anyone I should go to, to ask permission to marry you?

1541
02:15:12,781 --> 02:15:15,341
-為什麼我們不問… -孩子們？
- Why don't we ask... - The children?

1542
02:17:03,858 --> 02:17:07,885
你要如何處理 像?莉亞這樣的問題人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

1543
02:17:08,696 --> 02:17:12,393
你要如何摘下浮雲 然後釘牢？
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

1544
02:17:13,368 --> 02:17:17,532
你要如何用言語形容她？
How do you find a word That means Maria?

1545
02:17:17,972 --> 02:17:18,961
搗蛋鬼
A flibbertigibbet

1546
02:17:19,207 --> 02:17:22,472
鬼靈精 小丑
A will-o'-the-wisp A clown

1547
02:17:22,677 --> 02:17:27,239
許多事你們想告訴她
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

1548
02:17:27,682 --> 02:17:31,709
許多事她該明瞭
Many a thing she ought to understand

1549
02:17:32,420 --> 02:17:36,720
但如何使她停下聽你說完？
But how do you make her stay And listen to all you say?

1550
02:17:37,091 --> 02:17:41,027
如何使海浪停留在沙灘上？
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

1551
02:17:41,362 --> 02:17:46,356
你要如何處理 像?莉亞這樣的問題人物？
Oh, how do you solve A problem like Maria?

1552
02:17:46,734 --> 02:17:53,367
如何使月光在掌中停留？
How do you hold a moonbeam In your hand?

1553
02:19:59,467 --> 02:20:01,025
你好
Herr Detweiler!

1554
02:20:03,638 --> 02:20:06,300
-希特勒萬歲 -午安，吉勒先生
- Heil Hitler. - Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1555
02:20:06,541 --> 02:20:09,840
或許你還不知道 我現在是這裡的監督
Perhaps you've not heard. I am now the Gauleiter.

1556
02:20:10,144 --> 02:20:11,668
希特勒萬歲
Heil Hitler.

1557
02:20:12,580 --> 02:20:13,740
希特勒萬歲
Heil Hitler.

1558
02:20:14,048 --> 02:20:16,312
我剛從范崔普家來
I've come from Captain von Trapp's house.

1559
02:20:16,751 --> 02:20:20,346
合併後只有他家不掛…
The only one in the area not flying the Third Reich flag...

1560
02:20:20,588 --> 02:20:21,850
德國旗
...since the Anschluss.

1561
02:20:22,056 --> 02:20:24,217
-但是我們必須解決那問題 -我不…
- But we have dealt with that. - I don't...

1562
02:20:24,492 --> 02:20:27,427
管家告訴我會在這找到你
The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.

1563
02:20:27,695 --> 02:20:29,390
這是那個女人 給我的唯一情報
The only thing she'd tell me.

1564
02:20:29,897 --> 02:20:32,422
你在找什麼情報？
What kind of information are you looking for?

1565
02:20:32,700 --> 02:20:34,565
艦長何時會回來？
When will the captain return?

1566
02:20:35,103 --> 02:20:39,039
他去渡蜜月了 他沒和我們聯絡
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip. He's not been in touch with us.

1567
02:20:39,273 --> 02:20:44,108
你要我相信艦長一個多月 沒和他的孩子們聯絡？
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated with his children in over a month?

1568
02:20:44,379 --> 02:20:46,279
監督，你認識多少人…
How many men do you know...

1569
02:20:46,547 --> 02:20:49,846
會在渡蜜月時和孩子聯絡？
...who communicate with their children while honeymooning?

1570
02:20:50,752 --> 02:20:54,449
當他回來時 我們希望他接受新政府的職位
Upon his return, he'll fill his proper position in the new order.

1571
02:20:54,756 --> 02:20:57,122
當然了，多謝你…
Naturally. And may I congratulate you...

1572
02:20:57,358 --> 02:21:02,022
和你的人們允許今晚可以 如期舉行音樂節
...and your people in allowing the festival to go on tonight as planned.

1573
02:21:02,563 --> 02:21:06,021
為何我們會不允許？ 奧地利什麼都沒改變
Why should it not go on? Nothing in Austria has changed.

1574
02:21:06,267 --> 02:21:09,668
唱歌和音樂可宣告世界
Singing and music will show this to the world.

1575
02:21:09,871 --> 02:21:11,566
奧地利依然如昔
Austria is the same.

1576
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:13,805
希特勒萬歲
Heil Hitler.

1577
02:21:15,977 --> 02:21:17,569
希特勒萬歲
Heil Hitler.

1578
02:21:19,247 --> 02:21:20,475
走吧，我們回家去
Come, let's go home.

1579
02:21:20,715 --> 02:21:24,207
-為何他這麼凶？ -這些日子大家都很凶
- Why was he so cross? - Everybody's cross these days.

1580
02:21:24,419 --> 02:21:27,786
也許是旗上的黑蜘蛛 使人們緊張起來
Maybe the flag with the black spider makes people nervous.

1581
02:21:27,989 --> 02:21:30,924
-爸爸是不是有麻煩了？ -他是有選擇的
- Will Father be in trouble? - He doesn't have to be.

1582
02:21:31,159 --> 02:21:33,889
這些日子以來最重要的 是和大家和睦相處
The thing to do is to get along with everybody.

1583
02:21:34,128 --> 02:21:36,323
我要你們記住 尤其在今晚的演唱會上
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1584
02:21:36,564 --> 02:21:39,465
今晚我們真的要 在一大堆人面前唱歌？
Are we really going to sing before a lot of people?

1585
02:21:39,667 --> 02:21:41,760
看，范崔普家庭音樂團 名字是…
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

1586
02:21:41,969 --> 02:21:46,565
莉莎，費瑞克，露易莎，碧姬塔 寇特，?塔，葛特兒
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta, Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1587
02:21:46,774 --> 02:21:51,143
-為什麼我總是排在最後？ -因為你是最重要的
- Why am I always last? - Because you are the most important.

1588
02:21:51,846 --> 02:21:53,473
我們走吧
There we go.

1589
02:21:59,353 --> 02:22:02,811
你確定爸爸 會准許我們公開演唱？
Are you sure Father will approve of our singing in public?

1590
02:22:03,024 --> 02:22:05,322
他會很高興並引以為傲的
He'll be pleased and proud.

1591
02:22:05,793 --> 02:22:08,261
-莉莎，你覺得如此嗎？ -你們不信任我嗎？
- Liesl, do you think so? - Don't you trust me?

1592
02:22:08,463 --> 02:22:09,487
不信任
No.

1593
02:22:09,697 --> 02:22:11,790
你是個很聰明的女孩
You're a very intelligent girl.

1594
02:22:12,333 --> 02:22:14,494
莉莎…
Liesl. Liesl!

1595
02:22:15,436 --> 02:22:16,630
勞夫
Rolfe!

1596
02:22:17,638 --> 02:22:19,663
很高興見到你，已經…
I'm so glad to see you. It's been su...

1597
02:22:19,874 --> 02:22:20,966
午安
Good afternoon.

1598
02:22:21,375 --> 02:22:24,310
請你把這電報交給你父親
Give this to your father as soon as he's home.

1599
02:22:24,979 --> 02:22:26,844
-他正在渡蜜月呢 -我知道
- He's on his honeymoon. - I know.

1600
02:22:27,048 --> 02:22:30,381
-你知道？ -幹我們這行的事事都要知道
- You do? - We make it our business to know all.

1601
02:22:31,119 --> 02:22:33,679
-誰是“我們”？ -你要肯定他會收到
- Who's "we"? - See that he gets it.

1602
02:22:33,888 --> 02:22:36,220
-這是什麼？ -是從柏林來的電報
- What is it? - It's a telegram from Berlin.

1603
02:22:37,058 --> 02:22:39,549
你不要親自來交給他嗎？
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1604
02:22:40,027 --> 02:22:42,655
我有更重要的事
I'm occupied with more important matters.

1605
02:22:42,864 --> 02:22:45,355
你父親也最好能知輕重
And your father had better be too.

1606
02:22:45,633 --> 02:22:47,123
但是，勞夫！
But, Rolfe!

1607
02:23:10,224 --> 02:23:11,885
爸爸…
Father!

1608
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,822
-我們沒料到你這麼快回來 -哈囉…
- We didn't expect you so soon. - Hello, hello!

1609
02:23:15,062 --> 02:23:17,860
我們以為你下星期回來！
We didn't expect you home until next week!

1610
02:23:18,065 --> 02:23:23,503
-有在巴黎給我們買手信嗎？ -你好嗎？
- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris? - Hello! How are you?

1611
02:23:24,605 --> 02:23:25,902
你們為什麼沒有打給我們？
Why didn't you call us?

1612
02:23:26,107 --> 02:23:28,041
我們試過了，但是不通
We couldn't get through.

1613
02:23:28,342 --> 02:23:30,276
這個我也沒奈何
I had nothing to do with that.

1614
02:23:30,545 --> 02:23:32,570
我們儘快趕回來了
We came back as fast as we could.

1615
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:35,041
我們很想念你們
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1616
02:23:35,283 --> 02:23:37,717
-我們很想你們 -我們很想親你們
- We missed you! - We missed kissing you.

1617
02:23:37,919 --> 02:23:40,752
我想念你們早上的噪音
We missed all the noise in the morning.

1618
02:23:41,022 --> 02:23:45,220
-最想念的是你們的歌聲 -你們回來得正巧
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing. - Oh, you came back just in time.

1619
02:23:45,426 --> 02:23:47,189
看這個，瑪莉亞小姐…
Look, Fraulein Maria...

1620
02:23:47,395 --> 02:23:49,022
我是說媽媽
I mean Mother.

1621
02:23:49,430 --> 02:23:51,921
我們今晚會在音樂節唱歌
We're going to sing in the festival tonight.

1622
02:23:52,133 --> 02:23:54,260
我們過得很快樂
We've been having a lovely time!

1623
02:23:54,535 --> 02:23:56,594
我們練習了一天
We've been rehearsing all...

1624
02:23:58,105 --> 02:24:00,437
驚喜！驚喜！
Surprise! Surprise!

1625
02:24:01,108 --> 02:24:03,599
裡面有令你們驚喜的東西
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1626
02:24:06,647 --> 02:24:08,046
我們到裡面去談這個
We'll talk about this.

1627
02:24:08,249 --> 02:24:12,549
我本想要告訴你，但是你不在 我只有在最後一刻自作主張了
I would've told you but you were away. I had to make a last-minute decision.

1628
02:24:12,820 --> 02:24:15,311
我還算好運氣 總算趕得及報名
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1629
02:24:15,556 --> 02:24:20,289
他們必會成為話題的 試想一個家庭中的七個小孩
They'll be the talk of the festival. Imagine, seven children in one family!

1630
02:24:20,494 --> 02:24:22,121
麥斯
Max!

1631
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:25,563
我記得我以前 向你解釋得很清楚…
Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you...

1632
02:24:25,833 --> 02:24:28,495
我對於我家的小孩 在外面演唱的事的感覺
...how I feel about my family singing in public!

1633
02:24:28,769 --> 02:24:30,464
但是委員會聽過他們唱 非常的感動
The committee was enchanted.

1634
02:24:30,671 --> 02:24:33,834
-他們說了什麼？ -沒聽過這麼熱情的聲音
- What did they say? - I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1635
02:24:34,108 --> 02:24:38,408
-就一次好不好？ -絕對不可能
- Don't you think just this once...? - Absolutely out of the question.

1636
02:24:38,646 --> 02:24:42,776
-這是為了奧地利 -為了奧地利？
- Georg, this is for Austria. - For Austria?

1637
02:24:43,150 --> 02:24:46,415
-已經沒有奧地利了！ -但是德奧合併得很和平
- There is no Austria! - But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1638
02:24:46,654 --> 02:24:50,112
-我們應感到欣慰 -欣慰？
- Let's at least be grateful for that. - Grateful?

1639
02:24:51,993 --> 02:24:53,654
你知道嗎？麥斯
You know, Max...

1640
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:57,793
有時候我無法相信 自己認識你
...sometimes I don't believe I know you.

1641
02:25:00,468 --> 02:25:01,833
爸爸，我忘了
Father, I forgot.

1642
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:04,262
這是給你的
This is for you.

1643
02:25:14,048 --> 02:25:18,041
?莉亞，至少他必須假裝 和這些人合作
Maria, he has got to at least pretend to work with these people.

1644
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:19,843
你必須說服他
You must convince him.

1645
02:25:20,054 --> 02:25:22,818
我不能要求他聽我的話
Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.

1646
02:25:23,057 --> 02:25:26,356
那麼我和他談 如果孩子們不參加音樂節
Then I'll talk to him. If the children don't sing, well...

1647
02:25:26,627 --> 02:25:28,857
是一樣對奧地利有損的事
...it will be a reflection on Austria.

1648
02:25:29,664 --> 02:25:33,031
對我也沒有好處
Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.

1649
02:25:38,205 --> 02:25:40,867
媽，可以這樣叫你真好
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1650
02:25:41,142 --> 02:25:43,872
-我喜歡叫你媽 -我喜歡聽你叫
- I like calling you "Mother." - I like hearing it.

1651
02:25:44,078 --> 02:25:47,809
你很愛爸爸，我看得出來
You love Father very much. I can tell you do.

1652
02:25:48,015 --> 02:25:48,811
非常愛他
Very much.

1653
02:25:49,083 --> 02:25:52,382
媽，當你認為你愛某個人時 你要怎麼辦？
Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone?

1654
02:25:53,087 --> 02:25:58,389
我是說當你不再愛他 或他不再愛你時
I mean, when you stop loving someone or he stops loving you?

1655
02:26:00,995 --> 02:26:03,054
你會哭一場
Well, you cry a little.

1656
02:26:03,497 --> 02:26:05,590
等待太陽出來
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1657
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:07,231
快樂的日子終會再來
It always does.

1658
02:26:07,501 --> 02:26:11,062
有許多事情我認為我應該知道 但我卻不知道
There are so many things I think I should know but I don't.

1659
02:26:11,272 --> 02:26:13,240
-真的不知道 -怎麼說？
- I really don't. - How can you?

1660
02:26:13,507 --> 02:26:15,702
有時我覺得世界就快完了
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1661
02:26:15,943 --> 02:26:19,174
-然後你覺得這才剛開始？ -是的
- Then you feel it's just beginning? - Yes!

1662
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:23,612
我以前也這麼覺得 對你，一切會很好的
It was that way with me. And for you it will be just as wonderful.

1663
02:26:24,285 --> 02:26:26,185
你真的認為如此？
Do you really think so?

1664
02:26:27,088 --> 02:26:31,024
你16歲，快17歲了
When you're 16 going on 17

1665
02:26:31,292 --> 02:26:34,887
人生才要開始
Waiting for life to start

1666
02:26:35,563 --> 02:26:39,397
一個讓你留下好印象的人
Somebody kind Who touches your mind

1667
02:26:39,633 --> 02:26:43,933
會突然觸動你的心靈
Will suddenly touch your heart

1668
02:26:44,372 --> 02:26:46,067
當這事…
When that happens

1669
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:48,474
發生之後
After it happens

1670
02:26:48,709 --> 02:26:52,577
一切都改變了
Nothing is quite the same

1671
02:26:52,813 --> 02:26:54,371
我知道…
Somehow I know

1672
02:26:54,648 --> 02:26:56,775
我會立刻走過去
I'll jump up and go

1673
02:26:56,984 --> 02:27:01,284
若他呼喚我的名字
If ever he calls my name

1674
02:27:01,555 --> 02:27:05,457
你舊日對生命的看法會變改
Gone are your old ideas of life

1675
02:27:05,726 --> 02:27:09,924
那些舊念頭都變得黯淡
The old ideas grow dim

1676
02:27:10,164 --> 02:27:14,567
你會發現你已為人妻
Lo and behold You're someone's wife

1677
02:27:15,503 --> 02:27:21,499
你完全屬於他
And you belong to him

1678
02:27:21,809 --> 02:27:26,109
你會以為這種歷險
You may think this kind of adventure

1679
02:27:26,313 --> 02:27:30,181
永不會發生在自己身上
Never may come to you

1680
02:27:31,285 --> 02:27:36,655
親愛的已16歲，快17歲了
Darling, 16 going on 17

1681
02:27:37,491 --> 02:27:41,621
耐心等一年…
Wait a year...

1682
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:47,663
-我會等一年 -或兩年吧
- I'll wait a year ...or two

1683
02:27:48,102 --> 02:27:55,440
只要等一年…
Just wait a year...

1684
02:27:56,310 --> 02:28:04,945
或兩年
...or two

1685
02:28:07,354 --> 02:28:08,946
莉莎
Liesl.

1686
02:28:25,406 --> 02:28:26,737
什麼事情？
What is it?

1687
02:28:27,675 --> 02:28:29,040
是柏林
Berlin.

1688
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:31,375
他們給我委派了一項任命
They've offered me a commission.

1689
02:28:31,645 --> 02:28:34,170
並要求我馬上接受
I've been requested to accept immediately...

1690
02:28:34,415 --> 02:28:38,408
明天到北萊梅港海軍基地報到
...and report to their naval base at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1691
02:28:39,019 --> 02:28:43,012
我就知道這種事會發生 沒料到這麼快
I knew this would happen. I didn't think it would be so soon.

1692
02:28:43,257 --> 02:28:46,749
拒絕的話，全家會遭到懲罰
To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.

1693
02:28:47,995 --> 02:28:51,761
加入的話後果更難想像
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1694
02:28:57,938 --> 02:28:59,701
叫小孩們都過來
Get the children all together.

1695
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:03,237
別說讓他們擔心的話 只要讓他們準備好
Don't say anything to worry them. Just get them ready.

1696
02:29:04,211 --> 02:29:06,577
我們必須離開奧地利
We've got to get out of Austria...

1697
02:29:08,249 --> 02:29:09,910
還有這所房子
...and this house...

1698
02:29:12,253 --> 02:29:13,686
就在今晚
...tonight.

1699
02:29:57,598 --> 02:29:59,998
今晚你們不唱了
This strains my back and breaks my heart...

1700
02:30:00,267 --> 02:30:03,100
真是讓我傷心難過
...when I think of the children missing the festival.

1701
02:30:03,404 --> 02:30:06,066
你宣佈的時候 我們就越過邊界了
By your announcement we'll be over the border.

1702
02:30:06,307 --> 02:30:08,741
我希望你會感激我所做的犧牲
Do you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making?

1703
02:30:08,943 --> 02:30:10,240
你沒有選擇
You have no choice.

1704
02:30:10,477 --> 02:30:13,310
我知道，這就是我會這樣做的原因
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1705
02:30:14,014 --> 02:30:16,141
爸爸為何不發動引擎？
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1706
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:19,786
因為他不要任何人聽到
Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us.

1707
02:30:23,424 --> 02:30:25,858
管家們會說什麼？
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1708
02:30:26,126 --> 02:30:29,653
他們可以老實回答 他們什麼都不知道
They'll be able to answer honestly they didn't know anything.

1709
02:30:29,863 --> 02:30:34,095
-我們會再回來嗎？ -莉莎，我希望會有這一天
- Will we be coming back here? - Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1710
02:30:34,335 --> 02:30:39,272
爸爸和麥伯伯 要一直推車到瑞士嗎？
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push the car all the way to Switzerland?

1711
02:31:06,066 --> 02:31:08,466
艦長，你的車是不是有毛病？
Something wrong with your car, captain?

1712
02:31:08,802 --> 02:31:11,066
是的，車子無法啟動
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1713
02:31:14,842 --> 02:31:16,070
卡爾
Karl.

1714
02:31:18,045 --> 02:31:21,537
替艦長把車修好 好讓其啟動
Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.

1715
02:31:44,738 --> 02:31:46,535
做得好
Excellent, Karl.

1716
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:53,073
我沒問你和你的家人要到哪
I've not asked you where you and your family are going.

1717
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:55,707
你也沒問我為何在此
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1718
02:31:55,916 --> 02:31:59,682
我想我們兩個都沒什麼好奇心
Apparently we both suffer from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1719
02:32:00,554 --> 02:32:03,022
你沒有回復那封…
You never answered the telegram...

1720
02:32:03,257 --> 02:32:06,556
來自第三帝國海軍基地的電報
...from the Admiral of the Navy of the Third Reich.

1721
02:32:06,794 --> 02:32:09,262
據我所知，在奧地利
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller...

1722
02:32:09,530 --> 02:32:13,022
電報的內容是私人的
...that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!

1723
02:32:13,734 --> 02:32:17,261
最少在我所知的奧地利是如此
At least, the Austria I know.

1724
02:32:18,405 --> 02:32:20,032
我奉命…
I have my orders...

1725
02:32:20,274 --> 02:32:22,435
今晚帶你去基地
...to take you to Bremerhaven tonight...

1726
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:24,905
接受你的職務
...where you will accept your commission.

1727
02:32:26,046 --> 02:32:31,484
我怕不可能了
I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.

1728
02:32:32,086 --> 02:32:33,815
你看…
You see, we...

1729
02:32:34,388 --> 02:32:37,221
我們全家…
...all of us, the entire family, will be...

1730
02:32:38,292 --> 02:32:40,317
今晚要在音樂會上演唱
...singing in the festival tonight.

1731
02:32:40,627 --> 02:32:43,095
事實上我們現在就要去
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1732
02:32:43,731 --> 02:32:46,598
不可能現在讓他們失望的
We couldn't possibly let them down now.

1733
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,769
-我希望我們不會遲到 -是的
- I just hope we're not too late. - Yes.

1734
02:32:50,003 --> 02:32:52,904
你叫我相信，你艦長…
You ask me to believe that you, Captain von Trapp...

1735
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:54,607
要去演唱會唱歌？
...are singing in a concert?

1736
02:32:55,008 --> 02:32:59,138
相信我，這會是最棒的表演
Believe me, it will be a performance beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1737
02:32:59,513 --> 02:33:04,143
吉勒先生，像你一樣 我也是身懷絕技的
Like you, Herr Zeller, I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1738
02:33:04,852 --> 02:33:06,183
是的
Yes.

1739
02:33:06,453 --> 02:33:08,944
這是節目表
Here, program.

1740
02:33:13,961 --> 02:33:16,293
上面只有孩子的名字
It says only the names of the children.

1741
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:19,795
上面說范崔普家庭歌詠團
It says the von Trapp Family Singers...

1742
02:33:20,033 --> 02:33:23,093
而我是范崔普家的頭兒 不是嗎？
...and I am the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?

1743
02:33:25,372 --> 02:33:29,172
穿著這些旅行裝？
And these travel clothes that you're all wearing?

1744
02:33:30,010 --> 02:33:31,534
是我們的制服
Our costumes, naturally.

1745
02:33:31,812 --> 02:33:35,213
今晚天氣不好 穿禮服會對孩子的嗓子有影響
This night air is not good for the children's voices.

1746
02:33:41,455 --> 02:33:44,982
稍微延遲執行命令沒什麼大不了
Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.

1747
02:33:46,193 --> 02:33:47,717
你們
Therefore...

1748
02:33:48,562 --> 02:33:50,189
去唱吧
...you will sing.

1749
02:33:51,131 --> 02:33:53,122
你們全部都要唱
You will all sing.

1750
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,025
這正是我希望的
But only because that's what I want.

1751
02:33:56,970 --> 02:34:00,406
這表示奧地利一切都沒有改變
It will demonstrate that nothing in Austria has changed.

1752
02:34:01,141 --> 02:34:03,336
你們唱完後
And when you have finished singing...

1753
02:34:03,644 --> 02:34:06,807
我就要帶艦長到北萊梅港
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.

1754
02:34:08,081 --> 02:34:10,811
現在，你們上車吧
Now, if you will all get into your car...

1755
02:34:11,051 --> 02:34:14,885
我們要護送 范崔普家庭歌詠團去演唱會
...we will escort the von Trapp Family Singers to the festival.

1756
02:34:15,756 --> 02:34:17,917
吉勒先生，用不著護送
No escort will be necessary.

1757
02:34:18,158 --> 02:34:20,649
艦長，我們樂意如此
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1758
02:34:21,562 --> 02:34:25,430
我們不希望你們迷了路
After all, we would not want you to get lost in the crowds.

1759
02:34:26,667 --> 02:34:28,157
對嗎？
Would we?

1760
02:34:28,836 --> 02:34:29,996
是的
No.

1761
02:34:46,220 --> 02:34:49,383
Sew是用針拉著線
Sew, a needle pulling thread

1762
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:52,787
La是Sew之後的音
La, a note to follow sew

1763
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:56,518
Tea是配果醬麵包的飲品
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

1764
02:34:56,730 --> 02:35:00,530
是配果醬麵包的飲品
A drink with jam and bread

1765
02:35:10,110 --> 02:35:12,271
果醬麵包

1766
02:35:18,151 --> 02:35:21,484
-配果醬 -A，B，C
- With jam - A, B, C

1767
02:35:21,722 --> 02:35:24,953
-配果醬 -Do remi

1768
02:35:25,158 --> 02:35:28,753
Tea是配果醬麵包的飲品
Tea with jam and bread

1769

1770
02:35:30,597 --> 02:35:32,121
配果醬…

1771
02:35:32,332 --> 02:35:41,138
麵包
...and bread

1772
02:36:03,130 --> 02:36:06,258
各位奧地利兄弟們
My fellow Austrians...

1773
02:36:07,534 --> 02:36:12,096
或許我會有一段時間 見不到你們了
...I shall not be seeing you again, perhaps for a very long time.

1774
02:36:13,507 --> 02:36:15,168
現在我要為你們唱…
I would like to sing for you now...

1775
02:36:16,777 --> 02:36:18,335
一首愛之歌
...a love song.

1776
02:36:20,314 --> 02:36:22,509
我知道你們會分享此愛
I know you share this love.

1777
02:36:23,817 --> 02:36:27,514
我祈求你們永遠不會讓它逝去

1807
02:39:05,178 --> 02:39:07,703
當裁判們忙於評分之時

1832
02:40:54,087 --> 02:40:55,748
我驀地消失，我在飛翔

別了，再見，珍重再見

02:45:43,877 --> 02:45:46,402
不，?莉亞，你們來是對的
No, Maria, it was right for you to come here.

1861
02:45:46,613 --> 02:45:48,513
我們想借用你們的車
We thought we might borrow your car.

1862
02:45:48,715 --> 02:45:50,615
你們用不著車了
I'm afraid our car will do you no good now.

1863
02:45:51,217 --> 02:45:52,878
我聽無線電說
I've been listening to the wires.

1864
02:45:53,086 --> 02:45:55,611
邊界被封鎖了
The borders have just been closed.

1865
02:46:01,461 --> 02:46:03,759
好吧，邊界被封鎖了
All right, if the borders are closed...

1866
02:46:05,064 --> 02:46:08,363
那麼我們開車到山裡 再徒步過去
...then we'll drive up into the hills and go over the mountains on foot.

1867
02:46:08,968 --> 02:46:10,959
-和小孩們？ -我們會幫他們的
- The children... - We'll help them.

1868
02:46:11,237 --> 02:46:13,398
爸爸，我們不需要幫助
We can do it without help, Father.

1869
02:46:14,440 --> 02:46:15,805
?莉亞
Maria.

1870
02:46:16,543 --> 02:46:19,137
你不會孤獨無助的，記住
You will not be alone. Remember:

1871
02:46:19,379 --> 02:46:22,473
“我要向山舉目 我的幫助從何而來”
"I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help."

1872
02:46:23,449 --> 02:46:24,541
是的，院長
Yes, Mother.

1873
02:46:25,919 --> 02:46:28,080
-我好害怕 -我也是
- I'm scared. - Me too.

1874
02:46:40,166 --> 02:46:41,326
願主與你同在
God be with you.

1875
02:46:48,274 --> 02:46:49,832
-媽 -是的？
- Mother. - Yes?

1876
02:46:50,076 --> 02:46:53,273
如我們唱“心愛的事物” 會有幫助嗎？
Would it help if we sang about our favorite things?

1877
02:46:53,513 --> 02:46:56,505
不，親愛的 這是唯一幫不上忙的一次
No, darling. This is one time it would not help.

1878
02:46:56,783 --> 02:46:59,980
你必須很安靜，緊抱著我
You must be very quiet. Hold tight to me.

1879
02:49:14,654 --> 02:49:15,882
我們到屋頂看看
Let's try the roof.

1880
02:50:12,145 --> 02:50:14,375
勞夫，求求你
Rolfe, please.

1881
02:50:19,485 --> 02:50:20,975
不要，等一下
No, wait.

1882
02:50:30,797 --> 02:50:32,128
?莉亞
Maria.

1883
02:50:33,199 --> 02:50:34,632
孩子們
Children.

1884
02:50:38,671 --> 02:50:41,697
我們要的只是你
It's you we want, not them.

1885
02:50:42,074 --> 02:50:43,803
把那個放下
Put that down.

1886
02:50:44,877 --> 02:50:48,176
不准動，否則我就開槍
Not another move, or I'll shoot.

1887
02:50:49,882 --> 02:50:51,907
你只是個孩子
You're only a boy.

1888
02:50:54,921 --> 02:50:58,584
-你並不是他們的人 -站在原地
- You don't really belong to them. - Stay where you are.

1889
02:51:00,359 --> 02:51:02,350
跟我們逃吧
Come away with us.

1890
02:51:03,596 --> 02:51:04,756
現在還來得及
Before it's too late.

1891
02:51:05,364 --> 02:51:07,696
你再行一步，我就殺了你
Not another step. I'll kill you.

1892
02:51:10,002 --> 02:51:13,335
-把槍給我，勞夫 -你有沒有聽到？
- You give that to me, Rolfe. - Did you hear me?

1893
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:15,898
我會殺了你
I'll kill you.

1894
02:51:17,777 --> 02:51:19,244
勞夫
Rolfe.

1895
02:51:37,630 --> 02:51:38,961
你永遠不會跟他們一樣
You'll never be one of them.

1896
02:51:41,734 --> 02:51:43,429
中尉
Lieutenant!

1897
02:51:43,703 --> 02:51:44,829
他們在這裡
They're here!

1898
02:51:45,037 --> 02:51:46,595
他們在這裡，中尉
They're here, lieutenant!

1899
02:52:27,914 --> 02:52:29,575
院長
Reverend Mother.

1900
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:32,681
我有罪
I have sinned.

1901
02:52:33,853 --> 02:52:36,014
院長，我也是
I too, Reverend Mother.

1902
02:52:37,657 --> 02:52:39,989
孩子們，是什麼罪？
What is this sin, my children?
