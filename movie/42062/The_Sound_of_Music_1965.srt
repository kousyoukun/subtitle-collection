I would come down the mountain...

167
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:42,581
and climb a tree and look
over into your garden.

168
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,589
I'd see the sisters at work,

169
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,592
And I'd hear them sing
on their way to vespers...

170
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,595
which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

171
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:53,894
I was singing out there today
without permission.

172
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:56,265
Maria, it is only here
in the abbey...

173
00:15:56,336 --> 00:15:58,566
that we have rules about
postulants singing.

174
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:00,435
I can't seem to stop
singing wherever I am.

175
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:03,476
And what's worse, I can't
seem to stop saying things--

176
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:05,170
everything and anything
I think and feel.

177
00:16:05,245 --> 00:16:07,543
Some people would
call that honesty.

178
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:09,445
But it's terrible,
Reverend Mother.

179
00:16:09,516 --> 00:16:12,417
You know how Sister Berthe
always makes me kiss the floor...

180
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:14,419
after we've had a disagreement?

181
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:18,082
Lately I've taken to kissing
the floor when I see her coming

182
00:16:18,158 --> 00:16:20,092
just to save time.

183
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,596
Maria, when you saw us
over the abbey wall

184
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:26,427
and longed to be one of us,

185
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:28,433
that didn't necessarily mean

186
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:29,525
that you were prepared

187
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,933
for the way we live here, did it?

188
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:35,537
No, Mother, but I pray, and I try,

189
00:16:35,608 --> 00:16:37,439
and I am learning. I really am.

190
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,534
What is the most important lesson

191
00:16:38,611 --> 00:16:39,543
you have learned here, my child?

192
00:16:39,612 --> 00:16:42,012
To find out what
is the will of God

193
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:43,981
and to do it
wholeheartedly.

194
00:16:46,152 --> 00:16:47,949
Maria...

195
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,956
it seems to be the will of God

196
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:52,218
that you leave us.

197
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,021
- Leave you?
- Only for a while, Maria.

198
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:57,028
Oh, no, please, Don't do that.
Don't send me away.

199
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:59,792
This is where I belong.
It's my home, my family.

200
00:16:59,866 --> 00:17:01,356
It's my life.

201
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,334
But are you truly ready for it?

202
00:17:03,403 --> 00:17:05,098
Yes, I am.

203
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,264
Perhaps if you go
out into the world

204
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,364
for a time,

205
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:09,874
knowing what we
expect of you,

206
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:11,877
You will have
a chance to find out

207
00:17:11,945 --> 00:17:13,173
if you could expect it
of yourself.

208
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:15,840
I know what you expect,
mother, and I can do it.

209
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:16,677
I promise I can.

210
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:17,681
Maria.

211
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,586
Yes, Mother...

212
00:17:23,957 --> 00:17:26,858
If it is God's will.

213
00:17:26,926 --> 00:17:30,987
there is a family near Salzburg

214
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:33,498
that needs a governess
until September.

215
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,498
September?

216
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:36,000
To take care of seven children.

217
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:37,696
Seven children!

218
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,203
Do you like children, Maria?

219
00:17:39,272 --> 00:17:41,797
Well, yes, but seven!

220
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,207
I will tell Captain von Trapp

221
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,142
to expect you tomorrow.

222
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:47,975
Uh, Captain?

223
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:51,448
A retired officer of
the Imperial Navy.

224
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:52,984
a fine man and a brave one.

225
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,145
His wife died several years ago,

226
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,552
leaving him alone
with the children.

227
00:17:56,623 --> 00:17:58,614
I understand he's had
a most difficult time

228
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,057
managing to keep
a governess there.

229
00:18:01,127 --> 00:18:04,187
Uh, why difficult,
Reverend Mother?

230
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:08,428
The Lord will show you
in his own good time.

231
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:47,968
When The Lord closes a door,

232
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:50,168
somewhere he opens a window.

The last time
he visited the baroness,

- he stayed for a month.
- Oh.

But if you ask me,

the Captain's thinking
very seriously

of marrying the woman
before the summer's over.

now I know why you've sent me here.

664

To help these children prepare
themselves for a new mother.

What's his name?

that I'm her friend.

what she's been up to.

Are you going to tell on me?

guide her footsteps.

I was out taking a walk,

00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:41,882
and somebody locked the doors

earlier than usual,

wake everybody up.

You're not going to
tell Father, are you?

How in the world
did you climb up here?

689
00:46:58,708 --> 00:47:00,266
It's how we always
got into this room

to play tricks on the governess.

spiders in her hand.

walking all by yourself?

You know, if we wash
that dress out tonight,

nobody would
notice it tomorrow.

I didn't need a governess.

01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:32,628
They're extraordinary.

1624
01:36:32,695 --> 01:36:34,788
What they would do
at the festival!

1625
01:36:34,864 --> 01:36:38,027
Oh, young lady, I must
have words with you.

1626
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,160
Georg, you're not going
to let this girl get away.

1627
01:36:41,237 --> 01:36:42,568
She has to join the party.

1628
01:36:42,638 --> 01:36:43,627
No, really, I--

1629
01:36:43,706 --> 01:36:46,698
Shh. Stop it.
Georg, please.

1630
01:36:46,776 --> 01:36:48,300
You can if you
want to, fraulein.

1631
01:36:48,377 --> 01:36:50,504
I insist. You will be
my dinner partner.

1632
01:36:50,579 --> 01:36:51,841
This is business.

1633
01:36:51,914 --> 01:36:56,977
Franz, set another place
next to mine for Fraulein Maria.

1634
01:36:57,053 --> 01:36:59,146
Why...whatever you say,
Herr Detweiler.

1635
01:36:59,221 --> 01:37:01,485
Well, it appears
to be all arranged.

1636
01:37:01,557 --> 01:37:02,819
It certainly does.

1637
01:37:02,892 --> 01:37:04,086
I'm not
suitably dressed.

1638
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:06,720
Uh, well, you can change.
We'll wait for you.

1639
01:37:10,099 --> 01:37:13,034
Captain, you must be
very proud of your youngsters.

1640
01:37:13,102 --> 01:37:14,399
I am.
Thank you, baroness.

1641
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:16,404
Is there a more
beautiful expression

1642
01:37:16,472 --> 01:37:19,202
of what is good
in this country of ours

1643
01:37:19,275 --> 01:37:23,006
than the innocent voices
of our children?

1644
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:25,445
Oh, come, now, baron,
would you have us believe

1645
01:37:25,514 --> 01:37:28,574
that Austria alone holds
a monopoly on virtue?

1646
01:37:28,651 --> 01:37:31,984
Herr Zeller,
some of us prefer

1647
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:33,612
Austrian voices
raised in song

1648
01:37:33,689 --> 01:37:36,214
to ugly German threats.

1649
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:40,888
The ostrich buries
his head in the sand

1650
01:37:40,963 --> 01:37:44,057
and sometimes... in the flag.

1651
01:37:44,133 --> 01:37:45,657
Perhaps those
who would warn you

1652
01:37:45,735 --> 01:37:46,963
that the Anschluss is coming--

1653
01:37:47,036 --> 01:37:48,697
And it is coming, Captain--

1654
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:50,398
Perhaps they would
get further with you

1655
01:37:50,473 --> 01:37:52,771
by setting their words to music.

1656
01:37:52,842 --> 01:37:54,503
If the Nazis take over Austria,

1657
01:37:54,577 --> 01:37:56,135
I have no doubt
that you will be

1658
01:37:56,212 --> 01:37:57,611
the entire trumpet section.

1659
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:58,977
You flatter me, Captain.

1660
01:37:59,048 --> 01:38:01,539
Oh, how clumsy of me.

1661
01:38:01,617 --> 01:38:03,209
I meant to accuse you.

1662
01:38:11,527 --> 01:38:13,757
It's very kind of you to
offer to help me, baroness.

1663
01:38:13,829 --> 01:38:15,558
I'm delighted, Maria.

1664
01:38:15,631 --> 01:38:18,099
I really don't think
I do have anything

1665
01:38:18,167 --> 01:38:20,601
that would be appropriate.

1666
01:38:20,669 --> 01:38:22,762
Now, where is that
lovely little thing

1667
01:38:22,838 --> 01:38:24,806
you were wearing
the other evening

1668
01:38:24,874 --> 01:38:27,399
when the Captain couldn't
keep his eyes off you?

1669
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,608
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1670
01:38:34,683 --> 01:38:36,776
Come, my dear, we are women.

1671
01:38:36,852 --> 01:38:40,288
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1672
01:38:40,356 --> 01:38:41,414
Here we are.

1673
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:44,459
The Captain notices
everybody and everything.

1674
01:38:44,527 --> 01:38:46,995
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1675
01:38:47,062 --> 01:38:49,690
You are quite attractive, you know.

1676
01:38:49,765 --> 01:38:51,323
The Captain would hardly be a man

1677
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,992
if he didn't notice you.

1678
01:38:53,068 --> 01:38:56,868
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1679
01:38:56,939 --> 01:38:58,998
Not at all.

1680
01:38:59,074 --> 01:39:00,905
But I've never done a thing to--

1681
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:02,944
But you don't have to, my dear.

1682
01:39:03,012 --> 01:39:05,480
There's nothing more
irresistible to a man

1683
01:39:05,548 --> 01:39:07,175
than a woman
who's in love with him.

1684
01:39:07,249 --> 01:39:10,480
In love with him?

1685
01:39:10,553 --> 01:39:11,781
Of course.

1686
01:39:11,854 --> 01:39:13,822
But what makes it so nice

1687
01:39:13,889 --> 01:39:16,517
is he thinks
he's in love with you.

1688
01:39:18,928 --> 01:39:20,793
But that's not true.

1689
01:39:20,863 --> 01:39:24,731
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1690
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,199
And, you know, uh...

1691
01:39:26,268 --> 01:39:30,261
you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1692
01:39:30,339 --> 01:39:31,966
Don't take it to heart.

1693
01:39:32,041 --> 01:39:35,101
He'll get over it soon enough,
I should think.

1694
01:39:35,177 --> 01:39:36,439
Men do, you know.

1695
01:39:38,614 --> 01:39:39,638
Then I should go.

1696
01:39:39,715 --> 01:39:42,445
I mustn't stay here.

1697
01:39:52,628 --> 01:39:54,823
Is there something
I can do to help?

1698
01:39:54,897 --> 01:39:55,864
No, nothing.

1699
01:39:58,033 --> 01:39:59,364
Yes.

1700
01:39:59,435 --> 01:40:02,404
Please don't say a word
about this to the Captain.

1701
01:40:02,471 --> 01:40:06,908
No. no,
I wouldn't dream of it.

1702
01:40:13,749 --> 01:40:15,944
Good-bye, Maria.

1703
01:40:16,018 --> 01:40:19,215
I'm sure you'll make
a very fine nun.

1704
01:40:49,318 --> 01:40:51,786
Champagne, darling.

1705
01:40:51,854 --> 01:40:54,220
I feel
like celebrating.

1706
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:56,190
Cheers.

1707
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:02,620
You know something?

1708
01:41:02,698 --> 01:41:03,892
Perhaps.

1709
01:41:03,966 --> 01:41:05,365
Then if you're so clever,

1710
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:06,958
tell me how to get
our little fraulein

1711
01:41:07,036 --> 01:41:09,231
to use her influence
with Georg.

1712
01:41:09,305 --> 01:41:12,138
I want those children
in the festival.

1713
01:41:12,207 --> 01:41:14,675
Elsa, this is important
to Austria.

1714
01:41:14,743 --> 01:41:16,836
It wouldn't do you
any harm, either.

1715
01:41:16,912 --> 01:41:18,539
I've thought of that.

1716
01:41:18,614 --> 01:41:21,174
Well, if it's a matter
of influence,

1717
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,879
maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1718
01:42:59,363 --> 01:43:14,267

1719

Isn't this fun?

1735
01:45:12,996 --> 01:45:15,260
Um--

1736
01:45:15,332 --> 01:45:16,264
Four.

1737
01:45:16,333 --> 01:45:17,698
I'm number five.

1738
01:45:17,768 --> 01:45:19,395
Oh, yes.

1739

Six !

1743
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:25,006
Ohh!

1744
01:45:26,543 --> 01:45:27,635
Two.

1745
01:45:27,711 --> 01:45:31,545
Baroness Schraeder,
do you mind if we stop now?

1746
01:45:31,615 --> 01:45:32,639
We're tired.

1747
01:45:32,716 --> 01:45:34,911
Oh, whatever
you want, dear.

1748
01:45:34,985 --> 01:45:36,646
We'll do it
again tomorrow.

1749
01:45:47,030 --> 01:45:49,294
The country's
so restful, isn't it?

1750
01:45:49,366 --> 01:45:51,425
Have some lemonade.

1751
01:45:51,502 --> 01:45:54,596
Oh, there must be
an easier way.

1752
01:45:54,671 --> 01:45:57,105
I get a fiendish delight

1753
01:45:57,174 --> 01:45:59,301
thinking of you
as the mother of seven.

1754
01:45:59,376 --> 01:46:02,106
How do you plan to do it?

1755
01:46:02,179 --> 01:46:04,113
Darling, haven't you
ever heard

1756
01:46:04,181 --> 01:46:05,773
of a delightful
little thing

1757
01:46:05,849 --> 01:46:07,783
called
boarding school?

1758
01:46:07,851 --> 01:46:10,217
Baroness Machiavelli.

1759
01:46:10,287 --> 01:46:11,584
Mm-hmm.

1760
01:46:11,655 --> 01:46:14,385
Uncle Max,
where's father?

1761
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,289
I think
he's in the house.

1762
01:46:16,360 --> 01:46:18,920
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pusses?

1763
01:46:18,996 --> 01:46:20,293
Nothing.

1764
01:46:20,364 --> 01:46:22,264
I know what we'll do.
Let's have a rehearsal.

1765
01:46:22,332 --> 01:46:23,390
What for?

1766
01:46:23,467 --> 01:46:24,957
Let's make believe we're
standing on the stage

1767
01:46:25,035 --> 01:46:26,127
at the festival.

1768
01:46:26,203 --> 01:46:27,761
I don't feel
like singing.

1769
01:46:27,838 --> 01:46:30,170
Not without
Fraulein Maria.

1770
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:32,731
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1771
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:34,903
Everybody into the group.
You know your places.

1772
01:46:34,978 --> 01:46:36,206
Get in your places.
That's right.

1773
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,214
Be cheerful.
Give us the key, Liesl.

1774
01:46:40,717 --> 01:46:43,185
Now, impress me.

1775
01:46:43,253 --> 01:46:44,777
* Ah *

1776
01:46:44,855 --> 01:46:45,822
* Ah *

1777
01:46:45,889 --> 01:46:47,186
* Ah *

1778
01:46:47,257 --> 01:46:49,020
Friedrich, Gretl,
why don't you sing?

1779
01:46:49,092 --> 01:46:51,754
I can't. I've got
a sore finger.

1780
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:53,922
But you sang
so beautifully

1781
01:46:53,997 --> 01:46:55,760
the night
of the party.

1782
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:58,427
Come on, all of you.
Try something you know.

isn't coming back?

Didn't I tell you
what her note said?

1815

Oh, I'm sure I did.

1816
01:48:24,521 --> 01:48:26,853
She said she missed
her life at the abbey

too much.

1818

She had to leave us.

and that's all
there is to it.

to try some of that.

the same thing.

What you must find out

is how God wants you
to spend your love.

my life to God.

02:03:19,070 --> 02:03:21,595
Only until arrangements

2105
02:03:21,672 --> 02:03:23,640
can be made for
another governess.

2106
02:04:19,063 --> 02:04:20,758
There you are!

2107
02:04:34,512 --> 02:04:36,946
I really must
speak to Cook

2108
02:04:37,014 --> 02:04:38,538
about the wiener
schnitzel.

2109
02:04:38,616 --> 02:04:41,244
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

2110
02:04:41,318 --> 02:04:43,582
And it makes you
much too quiet

2111
02:04:43,654 --> 02:04:45,884
at the dinner table,

2112
02:04:45,956 --> 02:04:47,890
or was it the wine?

2113
02:04:47,958 --> 02:04:49,357
Oh, undoubtedly
the wine.

2114
02:04:49,427 --> 02:04:53,056
You have no idea what kind
of trouble I'm having

2115
02:04:53,130 --> 02:04:55,394
trying to decide
what to give you

2116
02:04:55,466 --> 02:04:57,229
for a wedding present.

2117
02:04:57,301 --> 02:04:58,893
Oh, I know,
I'm enough,

2118
02:04:58,969 --> 02:05:01,233
but I do want you to have

2119
02:05:01,305 --> 02:05:03,637
some little trifle
for the occasion.

2120
02:05:03,707 --> 02:05:06,369
At first, I thought
of a fountain pen,

2121
02:05:06,444 --> 02:05:08,344
but you've
already got one.

2122
02:05:08,412 --> 02:05:12,143
And then I thought perhaps
a villa in the south of France,

2123
02:05:12,216 --> 02:05:14,810
but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

2124
02:05:14,885 --> 02:05:17,410
Georg, how do you feel
about yachts?

2125
02:05:17,488 --> 02:05:20,423
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean,

2126
02:05:20,491 --> 02:05:23,722
or a tiny one
for your bathtub, hmm?

2127
02:05:23,794 --> 02:05:24,920
Elsa.

2128
02:05:24,995 --> 02:05:27,555
And where to go
on our honeymoon?

2129
02:05:27,631 --> 02:05:29,428
Now, that is
a real problem.

2130
02:05:29,500 --> 02:05:32,526
I thought a trip around
the world would be lovely.

2131
02:05:32,603 --> 02:05:34,036
Then I said,
''Oh, Elsa,

2132
02:05:34,105 --> 02:05:36,096
there must be someplace
better to go.''

2133
02:05:36,173 --> 02:05:37,470
Don't worry, darling.
I--

2134
02:05:37,541 --> 02:05:38,803
Elsa.

2135
02:05:38,876 --> 02:05:40,468
Yes, Georg?

2136
02:05:40,544 --> 02:05:42,842
It's no use.

2137
02:05:42,913 --> 02:05:46,349
You and I.

2138
02:05:46,417 --> 02:05:50,513
I've been dishonest
to both of us

2139
02:05:50,588 --> 02:05:53,182
and utterly
unfair to you.

2140
02:05:57,094 --> 02:06:00,029
When two people
talk of marriage--

2141
02:06:00,097 --> 02:06:01,257
No, don't.

2142
02:06:01,332 --> 02:06:04,096
Don't say another word,
Georg, please.

2143
02:06:06,203 --> 02:06:08,467
You see, um...

2144
02:06:08,539 --> 02:06:11,975
there are other things
I've been thinking of.

2145
02:06:12,042 --> 02:06:15,569
Fond as I am of you,

2146
02:06:15,646 --> 02:06:18,206
I really don't think
you're the right man for me.

2147
02:06:18,282 --> 02:06:20,477
You're, um--

2148
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:22,041
You're much too
independent.

2149
02:06:22,119 --> 02:06:26,988
And I--I need someone
who needs me desperately,

2150
02:06:27,057 --> 02:06:30,458
or at least needs
my money desperately.

2151
02:06:32,663 --> 02:06:35,496
I've enjoyed every moment
we've had together.

2152
02:06:35,566 --> 02:06:37,693
I do thank you for that.

2153
02:06:39,036 --> 02:06:43,268
Now, if, um,
if you'll forgive me,

2154
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:45,604
I'll go inside,
pack my little bags,

2155
02:06:45,676 --> 02:06:48,236
and return to Vienna,
where I belong.

2156
02:06:52,516 --> 02:06:55,952
And somewhere out there
is a young lady

2157
02:06:56,020 --> 02:06:57,453
who I think...

2158
02:06:59,523 --> 02:07:01,818
will never be a nun.

2159
02:07:12,529 --> 02:07:15,123
Auf wiedersehen,
darling.

2160
02:07:41,558 --> 02:07:43,150
Hello.

2161
02:07:47,997 --> 02:07:52,263
I thought I just might
find you here.

2162
02:07:55,505 --> 02:07:57,871
Was there something
you wanted?

2163
02:07:57,941 --> 02:07:59,306
Hmm?

2164
02:07:59,375 --> 02:08:01,309
No, no, no.
Sit down. please.

2165
02:08:02,512 --> 02:08:03,945
Please.

2166
02:08:09,018 --> 02:08:10,952
Uh, may I?

2167
02:08:21,297 --> 02:08:23,458
You know, I was...

2168
02:08:23,533 --> 02:08:25,467
I was thinking

2169
02:08:25,535 --> 02:08:28,971
and I was wondering
two things.

2170
02:08:29,038 --> 02:08:33,975
Why did you
run away to the abbey?

2171
02:08:34,043 --> 02:08:35,476
And...

2172
02:08:35,545 --> 02:08:39,242
what was it
that made you come back?

2173
02:08:39,315 --> 02:08:41,010
Well, I...

2174
02:08:41,084 --> 02:08:42,984
had an obligation
to fulfill,

2175
02:08:43,052 --> 02:08:44,815
and I...

2176
02:08:44,887 --> 02:08:46,821
I came back
to fulfill it.

2177
02:08:46,889 --> 02:08:48,982
Is that all?

2178
02:08:50,493 --> 02:08:52,552
And I missed
the children.

2179
02:08:52,629 --> 02:08:53,926
Yes.

2180
02:08:55,331 --> 02:08:56,798
Only the children?

2181
02:08:56,866 --> 02:08:57,958
No. Yes!

2182
02:08:58,034 --> 02:09:00,434
Isn't it right I should
have missed them?

2183
02:09:00,503 --> 02:09:02,437
Oh, yes!
Yes, of course!

2184
02:09:02,505 --> 02:09:05,440
I was only hoping
that perhaps you...

2185
02:09:05,508 --> 02:09:08,705
Perhaps
you might, uh...

2186
02:09:08,778 --> 02:09:10,803
Yes?

2187
02:09:12,515 --> 02:09:13,948
Well, uh...

2188
02:09:14,017 --> 02:09:18,454
Nothing was the same
when you were away and...

2189
02:09:18,521 --> 02:09:22,685
it'll be all wrong again
after you leave.

2190
02:09:22,759 --> 02:09:25,455
And I just thought
perhaps you might, uh...

2191
02:09:25,528 --> 02:09:27,723
change your mind?

2192
02:09:31,601 --> 02:09:33,228
I'm sure the baroness

2193
02:09:33,302 --> 02:09:36,066
will be able to make
things fine for you.

2194
02:09:36,139 --> 02:09:37,231
Maria,

2195
02:09:38,541 --> 02:09:42,033
there isn't going
to be any baroness.

2196
02:09:42,111 --> 02:09:44,272
There isn't?

2197
02:09:44,347 --> 02:09:46,474
No.

2198
02:09:46,549 --> 02:09:48,483
I don't
understand.

2199
02:09:50,053 --> 02:09:54,490
Well, we've, um, called off
our engagement, you see, and--

2200
02:09:54,557 --> 02:09:56,491
Oh, I'm sorry.

2201
02:09:56,559 --> 02:09:57,526
Yes.

2202
02:09:57,593 --> 02:09:58,582
You are?

2203
02:09:58,661 --> 02:10:00,094
Mm-hmm.

2204
02:10:00,163 --> 02:10:01,095
You did?

2205
02:10:01,164 --> 02:10:02,131
Yes.

2206
02:10:03,499 --> 02:10:07,765
Well, you can't marry
someone when you're...

2207
02:10:10,139 --> 02:10:12,437
in love with
someone else.

2208
02:10:15,344 --> 02:10:16,902
Can you?

2209
02:10:52,014 --> 02:10:54,039
The Reverend Mother
always says,

2210
02:10:54,117 --> 02:10:56,051
''When The Lord
closes a door,

2211
02:10:56,119 --> 02:10:58,246
somewhere
he opens a window.''

2212
02:11:05,828 --> 02:11:09,264
What else does the
Reverend Mother say?

2213
02:11:09,332 --> 02:11:13,268
That you have to look
for your life.

2214
02:11:13,336 --> 02:11:16,271
Is that why
you came back?

2215
02:11:20,343 --> 02:11:23,073
And have you
found it...

2216
02:11:23,146 --> 02:11:24,272
Maria?

2217
02:11:26,349 --> 02:11:28,283
I think I have.

2218
02:11:30,853 --> 02:11:32,718
I know I have.

2219
02:11:34,857 --> 02:11:37,121
I love you.

2220
02:11:46,002 --> 02:11:52,965
* Perhaps I had
a wicked childhood *

2221
02:11:53,042 --> 02:12:00,346
* Perhaps I had
a miserable youth *

2222
02:12:00,416 --> 02:12:06,685
* But somewhere in my wicked,
miserable past *

2223
02:12:06,756 --> 02:12:13,286
* There must have been
a moment of truth *

2224
02:12:13,362 --> 02:12:15,159
* For here you are *

2225
02:12:15,231 --> 02:12:16,994
* Standing there *

2226
02:12:17,066 --> 02:12:20,866
* Loving me *

2227
02:12:20,937 --> 02:12:23,906
* Whether or not *

2228
02:12:23,973 --> 02:12:27,500
* You should *

2229
02:12:27,577 --> 02:12:31,274
* So somewhere
in my youth *

2230
02:12:31,347 --> 02:12:35,147
* Or childhood *

2231
02:12:35,218 --> 02:12:44,024
* I must have done
something good *

2232
02:12:44,093 --> 02:12:48,393
* Nothing comes
from nothing *

2233
02:12:48,464 --> 02:12:52,867
* Nothing ever could *

2234
02:12:52,935 --> 02:12:57,531
* So somewhere
in my youth *

2235
02:12:57,607 --> 02:13:03,307
* Or childhood *

2236
02:13:03,379 --> 02:13:06,405
* I must have done *

2237
02:13:06,482 --> 02:13:10,543
* Something *

2238
02:13:10,620 --> 02:13:13,111
* Good **

2239
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:17,421
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

2240
02:13:17,493 --> 02:13:19,427
That night
at the dinner table

2241
02:13:19,495 --> 02:13:22,089
when you sat on that
ridiculous pine cone.

2242
02:13:22,164 --> 02:13:23,426
[ Laughing ]

2243
02:13:23,499 --> 02:13:24,932
What? [ Laughs ]

2244
02:13:25,001 --> 02:13:30,098
I knew the first time
you blew that silly whistle.

2245
02:13:36,178 --> 02:13:38,442
* For here you are *

2246
02:13:38,514 --> 02:13:40,448
* Standing there *

2247
02:13:40,516 --> 02:13:45,886
* Loving me *

2248
02:13:45,955 --> 02:13:49,220
* Whether or not *

2249
02:13:49,292 --> 02:13:52,887
* You should *

2250
02:13:52,962 --> 02:13:56,796
* So somewhere
in my youth *

2251
02:13:56,866 --> 02:14:00,393
* Or childhood *

2252
02:14:00,469 --> 02:14:02,801
* I must have done *

2253
02:14:02,872 --> 02:14:05,739
* Something *

2254
02:14:05,808 --> 02:14:08,854
* Good *

2255
02:14:08,987 --> 02:14:13,856
* Nothing comes
from nothing *

2256
02:14:13,926 --> 02:14:17,362
* Nothing ever could *

* Good **

2263
02:14:55,901 --> 02:14:57,334
Maria.

2264
02:14:58,904 --> 02:15:02,340
Is there anyone
I should go to

2265
02:15:02,407 --> 02:15:05,342
to ask permission
to marry you?

2266
02:15:06,912 --> 02:15:09,346
Well, why don't

well, it will be
a reflection on Austria.

2425
02:25:24,295 --> 02:25:28,732
Oh, I know. It wouldn't
do me any good, either.

2426
02:25:33,838 --> 02:25:35,328
- Mother?
- Hmm?

2427
02:25:35,406 --> 02:25:37,966
That sounds so nice.
I like calling you Mother.

2428
02:25:38,042 --> 02:25:39,771
I like hearing it.

2429
02:25:39,844 --> 02:25:44,508
- You love Father very much,
I can tell you do.
- Very much.

2430
02:25:44,582 --> 02:25:48,245
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone--

2431
02:25:48,319 --> 02:25:51,618
I mean, when you stop
loving someone,

2432
02:25:51,689 --> 02:25:54,123
or he stops loving you?

2433
02:25:55,693 --> 02:25:58,127
Well, you
cry a little.

2434
02:25:58,196 --> 02:26:01,222
And then you wait
for the sun to come out.

2435
02:26:01,299 --> 02:26:02,630
It always does.

2436
02:26:02,700 --> 02:26:05,760
There's so many things
I think I should know,

2437
02:26:05,837 --> 02:26:07,737
but I don't.
I really don't.

2438
02:26:07,805 --> 02:26:09,102
How can you?

2439
02:26:09,173 --> 02:26:11,539
Sometimes I feel the world
is coming to an end.

2440
02:26:11,609 --> 02:26:13,702
And then you feel
it's just beginning?

2441
02:26:13,778 --> 02:26:14,870
Yes.

2442
02:26:14,946 --> 02:26:16,345
It was that way
with me, Liesl.

2443
02:26:16,414 --> 02:26:19,474
And for you, it will be
just as wonderful, I promise.

2444
02:26:19,550 --> 02:26:22,018
Do you really
think so?

2445
02:26:22,186 --> 02:26:24,950
* When you're 1 6 *

2446
02:26:25,023 --> 02:26:26,957
* Going on 1 7 *

2447
02:26:27,025 --> 02:26:30,722
* Waiting for life
to start *

2448
02:26:30,795 --> 02:26:32,956
*Somebody kind *

2449
02:26:33,031 --> 02:26:35,261
* Who touches
your mind *

2450
02:26:35,333 --> 02:26:39,963
* Will suddenly
touch your heart *

2451
02:26:40,038 --> 02:26:41,972
* When that happens *

2452
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:44,474
* After it happens *

2453
02:26:44,542 --> 02:26:48,569
* Nothing is quite
the same *

2454
02:26:48,646 --> 02:26:52,582
* Somehow I know
I'll jump up and go *

2455
02:26:52,650 --> 02:26:57,087
* If ever
he calls my name *

2456
02:26:57,155 --> 02:27:01,421
* Gone are your
old ideas of life *

2457
02:27:01,492 --> 02:27:05,758
* The old ideas
grow dim *

2458
02:27:05,830 --> 02:27:07,491
* Lo and behold *

2459

02:27:17,675 --> 02:27:21,941
* You may think
this kind of adventure *

2462
02:27:22,013 --> 02:27:26,074
* Never may come
to you *

2463
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:32,646
* Darling 1 6,
going on 1 7 *

2464
02:27:32,724 --> 02:27:38,492
* Wait a year
or two *

2465
02:27:38,563 --> 02:27:43,523
* I'll wait a year *

2466
02:27:43,601 --> 02:27:51,906
*Just wait a year *

2467
02:27:51,976 --> 02:27:53,568
* Or *

2468
02:27:53,644 --> 02:28:00,573
* Two *

2469
02:28:02,653 --> 02:28:03,950
Liesl.

2470
02:28:20,171 --> 02:28:22,105
What is it?

2471
02:28:22,173 --> 02:28:23,606
Berlin.

2472
02:28:23,674 --> 02:28:27,610
They've offered me
a commission in their navy.

2473
02:28:27,678 --> 02:28:30,010
I've been
requested
to accept immediately

2474
02:28:30,081 --> 02:28:34,017
and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

2475
02:28:34,085 --> 02:28:36,349
I knew something
like this would happen,

2476
02:28:36,421 --> 02:28:37,615
but I didn't think
it would be so soon.

2477
02:28:37,688 --> 02:28:42,625
To refuse them would be
fatal for all of us,

2478
02:28:42,693 --> 02:28:46,891
and joining them
would be... unthinkable.

2479
02:28:51,903 --> 02:28:54,565
Get the children
all together.

2480
02:28:54,639 --> 02:28:55,731
Don't say anything

2481
02:28:55,807 --> 02:28:57,741
that's going
to make them worry.

2482
02:28:57,809 --> 02:28:59,709
Just get them ready.

2483
02:28:59,777 --> 02:29:02,041
We've got to get out
of Austria...

2484
02:29:03,748 --> 02:29:05,181
and this house...

2485
02:29:07,952 --> 02:29:09,078
tonight.

2486
02:29:53,197 --> 02:29:55,631
It strains my back,
it breaks my heart

2487
02:29:55,700 --> 02:29:57,190
when I think of
a certain singing group

2488
02:29:57,268 --> 02:29:59,031
that will not appear
at the festival tonight.

2489
02:29:59,103 --> 02:30:00,263
By the time you've
made the announcement,

2490
02:30:00,338 --> 02:30:01,703
we'll be over the border.

2491
02:30:01,772 --> 02:30:04,502
I hope you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making.

2492
02:30:04,575 --> 02:30:05,974
You have no choice.

2493
02:30:06,043 --> 02:30:09,103
I know. That's why
I'm making it.

2494
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:12,047
Why doesn't Father
turn the motor on?

2495
02:30:12,116 --> 02:30:14,744
Because he doesn't want
anyone to hear us!

2496
02:30:14,819 --> 02:30:16,081
Shh!

2497
02:30:18,389 --> 02:30:20,289
What will Frau Schmidt
and Franz say

2498
02:30:20,358 --> 02:30:21,655
when they discover
we're gone?

2499
02:30:21,726 --> 02:30:23,193
They'll be able to
answer truthfully.

2500
02:30:23,261 --> 02:30:25,525
They didn't know anything
about it if anyone asks them.

2501
02:30:25,596 --> 02:30:27,530
Will we be coming
back here?

2502
02:30:27,598 --> 02:30:29,930
Someday, Liesl.
I do hope someday.

2503
02:30:30,001 --> 02:30:32,663
Are Father and Uncle Max
going to push the car

2504
02:30:32,737 --> 02:30:34,102
all the way to Switzerland?

2505
02:30:34,172 --> 02:30:35,104
Shh!

2506
02:31:01,132 --> 02:31:03,600
Something wrong
with your car, Captain?

2507
02:31:03,668 --> 02:31:05,158
Yes, as a matter
of fact,

2508
02:31:05,236 --> 02:31:07,170
We couldn't
get it started.

2509
02:31:09,674 --> 02:31:11,107
Kobb.

2510
02:31:13,177 --> 02:31:15,611
Fix Captain
von Trapp's car

2511
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:18,046
so that
it will start.

2512
02:31:25,690 --> 02:31:27,624
[ Car Engine Starts ]

2513
02:31:39,537 --> 02:31:41,004
Excellent, Kobb.

2514
02:31:44,709 --> 02:31:46,176
I've not asked you

2515
02:31:46,244 --> 02:31:49,338
where you and your
family are going.

2516
02:31:49,413 --> 02:31:50,971
Nor have you asked me
why I'm here.

2517
02:31:51,048 --> 02:31:52,481
Well, apparently,
we're both suffering

2518
02:31:52,550 --> 02:31:54,677
from a deplorable
lack of curiosity.

2519
02:31:54,752 --> 02:31:59,086
You were sent a telegram,
which you did not answer,

2520
02:31:59,156 --> 02:32:02,250
from the navy
of the Third Reich.

2521
02:32:02,326 --> 02:32:04,317
I was under
the impression,

2522
02:32:04,395 --> 02:32:05,589
Herr Zeller,

2523
02:32:05,663 --> 02:32:07,893
that the contents of
telegrams in Austria

2524
02:32:07,965 --> 02:32:10,092
are private!

2525
02:32:10,167 --> 02:32:13,136
At least
the Austria I know.

2526
02:32:13,204 --> 02:32:15,035
I have my orders.

2527
02:32:15,106 --> 02:32:17,131
And they are to take you
personally

2528
02:32:17,208 --> 02:32:18,140
to Bremerhaven tonight

2529
02:32:18,209 --> 02:32:19,801
where you will accept
your commission.

2530
02:32:21,112 --> 02:32:23,046
I'm afraid that's...

2531
02:32:23,114 --> 02:32:27,551
going to be
quite impossible.

2532
02:32:27,618 --> 02:32:30,519
You see, we, uh...
all of us--

2533
02:32:30,588 --> 02:32:32,647
The entire family
will be...

2534
02:32:32,723 --> 02:32:35,191
singing in
the festival tonight.

2535
02:32:35,259 --> 02:32:36,920
As a matter of fact,

2536
02:32:36,994 --> 02:32:39,360
that's where
we were going now.

2537
02:32:39,430 --> 02:32:41,557
Couldn't possibly
let them down now.

2538
02:32:41,632 --> 02:32:43,759
I just hope
we're not too late.

2539
02:32:43,834 --> 02:32:45,563
Yes.

2540
02:32:45,636 --> 02:32:48,867
And you ask me to believe
that you, Captain von Trapp,

2541
02:32:48,939 --> 02:32:50,429
are singing
in a concert?

2542
02:32:50,508 --> 02:32:52,203
Believe me,
it will be a performance

2543
02:32:52,276 --> 02:32:54,267
beyond anything
even I've dreamt of.

2544
02:32:54,345 --> 02:32:56,540
Like you,
Herr Zeller,

2545
02:32:56,614 --> 02:33:00,015
I, too, am a man
of hidden talents.

2546
02:33:00,084 --> 02:33:03,212
Yes, um... here.

2547
02:33:03,287 --> 02:33:04,731
Program.

2548
02:33:08,401 --> 02:33:11,370
It says here only the names
of the children.

2549
02:33:11,438 --> 02:33:14,737
It says The von Trapp
Family Singers,

2550
02:33:14,808 --> 02:33:17,743
and I'm the head
of the von Trapp family,

2551
02:33:17,811 --> 02:33:18,800
am I not?

2552
02:33:20,980 --> 02:33:24,916
And these, um, travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

2553
02:33:24,984 --> 02:33:26,076
Our costumes,
naturally.

2554
02:33:26,152 --> 02:33:28,620
Herr Zeller,
this night air is not good

2555
02:33:28,688 --> 02:33:29,916
for the children's voices.

2556
02:33:36,029 --> 02:33:38,964
Well, a slight delay
in my orders

2557
02:33:39,032 --> 02:33:40,966
will not be serious.

2558
02:33:41,034 --> 02:33:42,968
Therefore...

2559
02:33:43,036 --> 02:33:45,231
you will sing.

2560
02:33:45,305 --> 02:33:47,296
You will all sing,

2561
02:33:47,373 --> 02:33:51,104
But only because that's
the way I want it to be.

2562
02:33:51,177 --> 02:33:55,113
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

2563
02:33:55,181 --> 02:33:58,014
And when you
are finished singing,

2564
02:33:58,084 --> 02:34:03,613
you, Captain von Trapp,
will be taken to Bremerhaven.

2565
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:06,557
Now, if you will all
get into your car,

2566
02:34:06,626 --> 02:34:09,117
we will escort
the von Trapp family singers

2567
02:34:09,195 --> 02:34:10,594
to the festival.

2568
02:34:10,663 --> 02:34:13,689
No escort will be
necessary, Herr Zeller.

2569
02:34:13,766 --> 02:34:14,790
Necessary?

2570
02:34:14,868 --> 02:34:16,392
Apleasure, Captain.

2571
02:34:16,469 --> 02:34:18,596
After all,
we would not want you

2572
02:34:18,671 --> 02:34:21,435
to get lost
in the crowds,

2573
02:34:21,508 --> 02:34:23,032
would we?

2574
02:34:23,109 --> 02:34:25,009
No.

2575
02:34:41,694 --> 02:34:43,889
* Sew, a needle
pulling thread *

2576
02:34:43,963 --> 02:34:45,123
* A needle
pulling thread *

2577
02:34:45,198 --> 02:34:46,961
* La, a note to follow sew *

2578
02:34:47,033 --> 02:34:48,398
* A note to follow sew *

2579
02:34:48,468 --> 02:34:50,732
* Tea, a drink
with jam and bread *

2580
02:34:50,803 --> 02:34:52,270
* A drink with
jam and bread *

2581
02:34:52,338 --> 02:34:54,397
* A drink with

02:50:50,035 --> 02:50:52,503
You don't really
belong to them.

2745
02:50:52,571 --> 02:50:54,334
Stay where you are!

2746
02:50:54,407 --> 02:50:58,002
Come away with us

2747
02:50:58,077 --> 02:51:00,477
before
it's too late.

2748
02:51:00,546 --> 02:51:01,945
Not another step.

2749
02:51:02,014 --> 02:51:03,379
I'll kill you!

2750
02:51:05,017 --> 02:51:07,451
You give that
to me, Rolfe.

2751
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:08,919
Did you hear me?

2752
02:51:08,988 --> 02:51:11,115
I'll kill you!

2753
02:51:12,558 --> 02:51:14,549
Rolfe

2754
02:51:32,044 --> 02:51:34,512
You'll never
be one of them.

2755
02:51:37,016 --> 02:51:39,143
Lieutenant!

2756
02:51:39,218 --> 02:51:40,446
Lieutenant,
they're here!

2757
02:51:40,519 --> 02:51:42,111
They're here,
Lieutenant!

Reverend Mother.

2762
02:52:26,398 --> 02:52:28,992
I have sinned.

2763
02:52:29,068 --> 02:52:32,504
I, too,
Reverend Mother.

2764
02:52:32,571 --> 02:52:35,506
What is this sin,
my children?

2765
02:53:02,101 --> 02:53:05,366
* A dream that will need *

2766

you can give *

* For as long
as you live *

* Climb every mountain *
