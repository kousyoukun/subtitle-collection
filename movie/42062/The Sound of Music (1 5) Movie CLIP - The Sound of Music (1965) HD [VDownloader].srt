1
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:07,110
The hills are alive

2
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:11,118
with the sound of music

3
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:14,134
With songs they have sung

4
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:19,110
for a thousand years

5
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:23,114
The hills fill my heart

6
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:27,110
with the sound of music

7
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:31,097
My heart wants to sing 
every song

8
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:35,052
it hears

9
00:00:36,072 --> 00:00:38,098
My heart wants to beat

10
00:00:38,098 --> 00:00:39,184
like the wings of the birds

11
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:41,150
That rise from the lake

12
00:00:42,062 --> 00:00:44,078
to the trees

13
00:00:45,022 --> 00:00:48,100
My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies

14
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,142
From a church on a breeze

15
00:00:53,084 --> 00:00:54,170
To laugh like a brook

16
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:56,176
when it trips and falls

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,170
over stones on its way

18
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:04,096
To sing through the night

19
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:06,030
like a lark

20
00:01:06,036 --> 00:01:08,102
who is learning to pray

21
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:14,082
I go to the hills

22
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:20,025
when my heart is lonely

23
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:24,006
I know I will hear

24
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:29,110
what I’ve heard before

25
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,059
My heart will be blessed

26
00:01:35,056 --> 00:01:44,059
with the sound of music

27
00:01:44,086 --> 00:01:48,100
And I’ll sing

28
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:52,066
once

29
00:01:52,094 --> 00:02:00,108
more
