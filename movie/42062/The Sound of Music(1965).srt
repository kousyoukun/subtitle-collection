3
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,080
<i>The hills are alive</i>

4
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,560
<i>With the sound of music</i>

5
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,160
<i>With songs they have sung</i>

6
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,080
<i>For a thousand years</i>

7
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
<i>The hills fill my heart</i>

8
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,960
<i>With the sound of music</i>

9
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,320
<i>My heart wants to sing</i>
<i>Every song it hears</i>

10
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
<i>My heart wants to beat like the wings</i>
<i>Of the birds that rise</i>

11
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,400
<i>From the lake to the trees</i>

12
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,760
<i>My heart wants to sigh</i>
<i>Like a chime that flies</i>

13
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,800
<i>From a church on a breeze</i>

14
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
<i>To laugh like a brook</i>
<i>When it trips and falls</i>

15
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
<i>Over stones on its way</i>

16
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,960
<i>To sing through the night</i>

17
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,920
<i>Like a lark who is learning to pray</i>

18
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,520
<i>I go to the hills</i>

19
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,680
<i>When my heart is lonely</i>

20
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,600
<i>I know I will hear</i>

21
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,160
<i>What I've heard before</i>

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,920
<i>My heart will be blessed</i>

23
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:11,400
<i>With the sound of music</i>

24
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,560
<i>And I'll sing...</i>

25
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:26,880
<i>... once more</i>

26
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,680
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

27
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,840
<i>Hallelujah, hallelujah</i>

28
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,560
- Reverend Mother.
- Sister Bernice.

29
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,120
- I simply cannot find her.
- Maria?

30
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
She's missing again.

31
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
We should've put a cowbell
around her neck.

32
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,920
Have you tried the barn? You know
how much she adores the animals.

33
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,760
I have looked everywhere.
In all of the usual places.

34
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
Sister, considering it's Maria...

35
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,400
...I suggest you look in someplace
unusual.

36
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Well, Reverend Mother...

37
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,960
...I hope this new infraction ends
whatever doubts...

38
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,280
...you may still have
about Maria's future here.

39
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,400
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

40
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,400
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

41
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,760
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

42
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,280
Of all the candidates for
the novitiate, Maria is the least...

43
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,160
Children, children.

44
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,560
We were speculating about
the qualifications of our postulants.

45
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,680
The Mistress of Novices
and the Mistress of Postulants...

46
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,000
...were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

47
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of Maria?

48
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,000
She's a wonderful girl,
some of the time.

49
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,200
- Sister Agatha?
- It's very easy to like Maria...

50
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,880
...except when it's difficult.

51
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,520
- And you, Sister Sophia?
- Oh, I love her very dearly.

52
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,560
But she always seems to be
in trouble, doesn't she?

53
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,560
Exactly what I say.

54
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,120
<i>She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee</i>

55
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,360
<i>Her dress has got a tear</i>

56
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,000
<i>She waltzes on her way to Mass</i>
<i>And whistles on the stair</i>

57
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,560
<i>And underneath her wimple</i>
<i>She has curlers in her hair</i>

58
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,200
<i>I've even heard her singing</i>
<i>In the abbey</i>

59
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,320
<i>She's always late for chapel</i>

60
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,800
<i>But her penitence is real</i>

61
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,240
<i>She's always late for everything</i>

62
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,560
<i>Except for every meal</i>

63
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,280
<i>I hate to have to say it</i>
<i>But I very firmly feel</i>

64
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,000
<i>Maria's not an asset to the abbey</i>

65
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,680
<i>I'd like to say a word in her behalf</i>

66
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,800
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

67
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:21,320
<i>Maria makes me laugh</i>

68
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,360
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

69
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,280
<i>How do you catch a cloud</i>
<i>And pin it down?</i>

70
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,000
<i>How do you find a word</i>
<i>That means Maria?</i>

71
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,280
<i>A flibbertigibbet</i>

72
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,320
<i>- A will-o'-the-wisp</i>
<i>- A clown</i>

73
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>Many a thing you know</i>
<i>You'd like to tell her</i>

74
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,720
<i>Many a thing she ought to understand</i>

75
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,800
<i>But how do you make her stay</i>
<i>And listen to all you say?</i>

76
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,400
<i>How do you keep a wave upon the sand?</i>

77
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,800
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

78
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,320
<i>How do you hold a moonbeam...</i>

79
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,600
<i>... in your hand?</i>

80
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,200
<i>When I'm with her I'm confused</i>
<i>Out of focus and bemused</i>

81
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
<i>And I never know exactly where I am</i>

82
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,240
<i>- Unpredictable as weather</i>
<i>- She's as flighty as a feather</i>

83
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,200
<i>- She's a darling</i>
<i>- She's a demon</i>

84
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,880
<i>She's a lamb</i>

85
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,600
<i>She'll out pester any pest</i>
<i>Drive a hornet from its nest</i>

86
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,280
<i>She can throw a whirling dervish</i>
<i>Out of whirl</i>

87
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,240
<i>- She is gentle, she is wild</i>
<i>- She's a riddle, she's a child</i>

88
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,920
<i>- She's a headache</i>
<i>- She's an angel</i>

89
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,400
<i>She's a girl</i>

90
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,320
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

91
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
<i>How do you catch a cloud</i>
<i>And pin it down?</i>

92
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,800
<i>How do you find a word</i>
<i>That means Maria?</i>

93
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,920
<i>- A flibbertigibbet</i>
<i>- A will-o'-the-wisp</i>

94
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,960
<i>A clown</i>

95
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
<i>Many a thing you know</i>
<i>You'd like to tell her</i>

96
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,320
<i>Many a thing she ought to understand</i>

97
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,760
<i>- But how do you make her stay</i>
<i>- And listen to all you say?</i>

98
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,880
<i>How do you keep a wave upon the sand?</i>

99
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,680
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

100
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,080
<i>How do you hold a moonbeam...</i>

101
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,000
<i>... in your hand?</i>

102
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,240
You may go in now, Maria.

103
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,880
Come here, my child.

104
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,600
Now sit down.

105
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,280
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

106
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
- The hills were beckoning and before...
- Dear.

107
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,640
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

108
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,400
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

109
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,480
If you'll feel better.

110
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, you see,
the sky was so blue today...

111
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,880
...and everything was so green and
fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

112
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,360
The Untersberg led me higher like
it wanted me to go through the clouds.

113
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Suppose darkness had come
and you were lost?

114
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,000
Mother, I could never be lost
up there.

115
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,920
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

116
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
It was the mountain that led me
to you.

117
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,880
Oh?

118
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,960
When I was a child,
I would come down and climb a tree...

119
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,880
...and look in your garden.

120
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,000
I'd see the sisters at work
and hear them sing.

121
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,680
Which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

122
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,360
I was singing out there today.

123
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,440
Only in the abbey do we have rules
about postulants singing.

124
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
I can't stop wherever I am.

125
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,080
Worse, I can't seem to stop
saying things.

126
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
Everything I think and feel.

127
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,080
Some call that "honesty".

128
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, but it's terrible,
Reverend Mother!

129
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,680
You know how Sister Berthe makes me
kiss the floor after a disagreement?

130
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,760
Lately, I kiss the floor
when I see her coming to save time.

131
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,680
Maria...

132
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
...when you saw us over the wall
and longed to be with us...

133
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,600
...that didn't mean you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

134
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,120
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

135
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,000
And I am learning. I really am.

136
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,200
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here?

137
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,560
To find out what is the will of God
and do it wholeheartedly.

138
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,080
Maria...

139
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,000
...it seems to be God's will
that you leave us.

140
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,920
- Leave?
- Only for a while.

141
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
No, Mother!
Please don't send me away!

142
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,120
This is where I belong. It's my home,
my family. It's my life.

143
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,200
- Are you truly ready for it?
- Yes, I am.

144
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,160
If you go out into the world for a
time, knowing what we expect of you...

145
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,000
...you will find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

146
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,840
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it! I promise I can!

147
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,440
Yes, Mother.

148
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,040
If it is God's will.

149
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
There is a family near Salzburg that
needs a governess until September.

150
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,320
- September?
- For seven children.

151
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Seven children?!

152
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,520
Do you like children?

153
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,360
Well, yes, but seven!

154
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,920
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

155
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,920
Captain?

156
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,800
A retired officer of the lmperial
Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

157
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,600
His wife died,
and he is alone with the children.

158
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,480
I understand he has had a difficult
time keeping a governess there.

159
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,000
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

160
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,520
The Lord will show you
in His own good time.

161
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,720
When the Lord closes a door...

162
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,840
...somewhere He opens a window.

163
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,400
<i>What will this day be like?</i>

164
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,240
<i>I wonder</i>

165
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,520
<i>What will my future be?</i>

166
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,400
<i>I wonder</i>

167
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,320
<i>It could be so exciting</i>

168
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,520
<i>To be out in the world</i>
<i>To be free</i>

169
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>My heart should be wildly rejoicing</i>

170
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,040
<i>Oh, what's the matter with me?</i>

171
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,200
<i>I've always longed for adventure</i>

172
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,880
<i>To do the things I've never dared</i>

173
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,200
<i>Now here I'm facing adventure</i>

174
00:18:53,440 --> 00:19:00,800
<i>Then why am I so scared?</i>

175
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,400
<i>A captain with seven children</i>

176
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,840
<i>What's so fearsome about that?</i>

177
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,280
<i>I must stop these doubts and worries</i>

178
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,280
<i>If I don't I just know I'll turn back</i>

179
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,320
<i>I must dream of the things</i>
<i>I am seeking</i>

180
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:26,040
<i>I am seeking the courage I lack</i>

181
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,960
<i>The courage to serve them</i>
<i>With reliance</i>

182
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
<i>Face my mistakes without defiance</i>

183
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,880
<i>Show them I'm worthy</i>

184
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,680
<i>And while I show them</i>

185
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,520
<i>I'll show me</i>

186
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,920
<i>So let them bring on</i>
<i>All their problems</i>

187
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,280
<i>I'll do better than my best</i>

188
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,480
<i>I have confidence</i>
<i>They'll put me to the test</i>

189
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,000
<i>But I'll make them see</i>
<i>I have confidence in me</i>

190
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>Somehow I will impress them</i>

191
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
<i>I will be firm but kind</i>

192
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,160
<i>And all those children</i>
<i>Heaven bless them</i>

193
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,560
<i>They will look up to me</i>
<i>And mind me</i>

194
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
<i>With each step I am more certain</i>

195
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,120
<i>Everything will turn out fine</i>

196
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,320
<i>I have confidence</i>
<i>The world can all be mine</i>

197
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:27,320
<i>They'll have to agree</i>
<i>I have confidence in me</i>

198
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,960
<i>I have confidence in sunshine</i>

199
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,120
<i>I have confidence in rain</i>

200
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,160
<i>I have confidence</i>
<i>That spring will come again</i>

201
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
<i>Besides which you see</i>
<i>I have confidence in me</i>

202
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
<i>Strength doesn't lie in numbers</i>

203
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,760
<i>Strength doesn't lie in wealth</i>

204
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,160
<i>Strength lies in nights</i>
<i>Of peaceful slumbers</i>

205
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,200
<i>When you wake up, wake up</i>
<i>It's healthy</i>

206
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,320
<i>All I trust I leave my heart to</i>

207
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,320
<i>All I trust becomes my own</i>

208
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,640
<i>I have confidence in confidence alone</i>

209
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
Oh, help.

210
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:37,320
<i>I have confidence in confidence alone</i>

211
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,200
<i>Besides which you see</i>
<i>I have confidence...</i>

212
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,400
<i>... in me</i>

213
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,880
Oh. Whoo.

214
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,040
Hello. Here I am.

215
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, captain.

216
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,960
And I'm the old butler, frylein.

217
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,360
Oh.

218
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,840
Well, how do you do?

219
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,840
You'll wait here, please.

220
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,960
In future, remember certain rooms
in this house are not to be disturbed.

221
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,120
Yes, captain, sir.

222
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,200
- Why do you stare at me that way?
- You don't look like a sea captain.

223
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

224
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,160
- Turn around.
- What?

225
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,040
Turn.

226
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,240
Hat off.

227
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,360
Put on another dress
before meeting the children.

228
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,160
But I don't have another.

229
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,160
When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes go to the poor.

230
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,560
What about this one?

231
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,360
The poor didn't want it.

232
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Hm.

233
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,160
There wasn't time to make a new dress.
I can make clothes.

234
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,000
I'll see that you get some material.

235
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
Today, if possible.

236
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
- Now, frylein...
- Maria.

237
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
- I don't know how much they told you.
- Not much.

238
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,920
You are the twelfth governess...

239
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,480
...to look after my children
since their mother died.

240
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,840
I trust you will be an improvement
on the last one.

241
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,320
She stayed only two hours.

242
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,120
What's wrong with the children, sir?

243
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,600
Nothing is wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

244
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,200
They could not maintain discipline,
without which the house cannot be run.

245
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,200
Drill them in their studies.

246
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,800
I will not permit them to dream
away their summer holidays.

247
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,600
Each afternoon,
they march, breathing deeply.

248
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,400
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

249
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,520
When do they play?

250
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,640
You will see to it that they conduct
themselves with the utmost decorum.

251
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:32,200
- I am placing you in command.
- Yes, sir.

252
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
Now...

253
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,040
...this is your new governess,
Frylein Maria.

254
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,120
Give your name at your signal.

255
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,040
Frylein, listen carefully. Learn
their signals so you can call them.

256
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
Liesl.

257
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,880
Friedrich.

258
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,600
Louisa.

259
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,040
Kurt.

260
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Brigitta.

261
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,760
Marta.

262
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,640
Gretl.

263
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,880
Now, let's see how well you listened.

264
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,400
I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

265
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,920
I mean, I'll use their names.
Such lovely names.

266
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,200
Frylein, this is a large house.
The grounds are extensive.

267
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,080
And I will not have anyone shouting.

268
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,920
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

269
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,240
The children will help you.

270
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,120
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

271
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,720
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

272
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
I could never answer to a whistle.

273
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
Whistles are for animals,
not for children.

274
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,360
And definitely not for me.

275
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,680
It would be too humiliating.

276
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,960
Frylein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

277
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,760
Oh, much more, sir.

278
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,600
I don't know your signal.

279
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,840
You may call me "captain".

280
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,640
At ease.

281
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,320
Now that there's just us...

282
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,800
...would you please tell me all your
names again and how old you are.

283
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,360
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old,
and I don't need a governess.

284
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,040
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

285
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,280
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14.
I'm impossible.

286
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,120
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

287
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,920
Frylein Josephine.
Four governesses ago.

288
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,040
I'm Brigitta.

289
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,600
You didn't tell me how old you are,
Louisa.

290
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

291
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,880
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

292
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm 10, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

293
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,520
- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
- Why not?

294
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,960
- Don't you think it's ugly?
- Of course.

295
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,800
But Frylein Helga's was ugliest.

296
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,560
I'm Kurt. I'm 11.
I'm incorrigible.

297
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
- Congratulations.
- What's "incorrigible"?

298
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,240
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

299
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be
seven on Tuesday.

300
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,480
I'd like a pink parasol.

301
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,680
Pink's my favorite color too.

302
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,200
Yes, you're Gretl.

303
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,280
And you're five years old?

304
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,920
My, you're practically a lady.

305
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,880
I have to tell you a secret.
I've never been a governess.

306
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,800
You don't know anything
about being a governess?

307
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,000
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

308
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,600
The best way to start is to tell
Father to mind his own business.

309
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,520
Never come to dinner on time.

310
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,400
Never eat your soup quietly.

311
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,600
During dessert, always blow your nose.

312
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,480
Don't you believe a word they say,
Frylein Maria.

313
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,480
- Oh, why not?
- Because I like you.

314
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,600
Children, outside for your walk.

315
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
Father's orders. Hurry up.

316
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
Quick, quick, quick.

317
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,400
Frylein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,
the housekeeper.

318
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,600
How do you do.

319
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,040
I'll show you to your room.
Follow me.

320
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,400
Poor little dears.

321
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,760
You're very lucky. With
Frylein Helga it was a snake.

322
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,000
Good evening.

323
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,640
- Good evening, children.
- Good evening, Frylein Maria.

324
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,120
Enchanting little ritual.

325
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,880
Something you learned at the abbey?

326
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,800
No.

327
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,640
Rheumatism.

328
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,040
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we
forgotten to thank the Lord?

329
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,600
For what we receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

330
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,160
- Amen.
Amen.

331
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,840
I'd like to thank you all...

332
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,440
...for the precious gift
you left in my pocket today.

333
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,520
What gift?

334
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,080
It's a secret between
the children and me.

335
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,960
Then I suggest you keep it,
and let us eat.

336
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,080
Knowing how nervous
I must have been...

337
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,600
...a stranger in a new household...

338
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,800
...knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted...

339
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,040
...it was so kind and thoughtful of
you to make my first moments here...

340
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,400
...so warm and happy...

341
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,800
...and pleasant.

342
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,640
- What is the matter, Marta?
- Nothing.

343
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Frylein...

344
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,920
...is it to be at every meal
or merely at dinnertime...

345
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,520
...that you intend leading us through
this rare and wonderful new world...

346
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,840
...of indigestion?

347
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,040
They're all right, captain.
They're just happy.

348
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,160
- Rolf, good evening.
- Good evening, Franz.

349
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,000
- I trust everything is under control?
- Yes, yes.

350
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,320
Good.

351
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,880
- Are there any developments?
- Perhaps.

352
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,200
- Is the captain home?
- He's at dinner.

353
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,680
- With the family?
- Yes.

354
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,120
Give him this telegram at once.

355
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,840
Certainly.

356
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,720
A telegram for you, sir.

357
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Franz? Who delivered it?

358
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,440
That young lad Rolf, of course.

359
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,560
- Father, may I be excused?
Hm.

360
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,120
Children, in the morning I shall
be going to Vienna.

361
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:38,200
Not again, Father!

362
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,800
How long will you be gone this time?

363
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm not sure, Gretl.

364
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,760
- To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
- Mind your own business!

365
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,320
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

366
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,240
- Why can't we ever see the baroness?
Why would she want to see you?

367
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,160
You are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

368
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,400
Good.

369
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,320
And Uncle Max.

370
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,400
Uncle Max!

371
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,040
Rolf!

372
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,000
Oh, Rolf!

373
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
- No, Liesl. We mustn't!
- Why not, silly?

374
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,560
- I don't know...
- Isn't this why you're waiting?

375
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,560
Yes, of course.

376
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,480
- I've missed you, Liesl.
- You have? How much?

377
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,400
I even thought of sending a telegram,
so I'd be able to deliver it here.

378
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,360
Oh, that's a lovely thought!
Why don't you, right now?

379
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,600
- But I'm here!
- Please, Rolf. Send me a telegram.

380
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,560
I'll start it for you.
"Dear Liesl..."

381
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,240
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able
to tell you...

382
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,600
...how I feel about you. Stop."

383
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,160
"Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive."

384
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,720
"Sincerely, Rolf."

385
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,560
- "Sincerely"?
- Cordially.

386
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,960
- "Cordially"?
- Affectionately?

387
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,360
Mmm.

388
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,560
Will there be any reply?

389
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,600
"Dear Rolf: Stop."

390
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,320
"Don't stop! Your Liesl."

391
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,160
If only we didn't have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

392
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,320
How do I know when I'll see you again?

393
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,240
Well, let's see...

394
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,200
I could come here by mistake.

395
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,560
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!
He's here from Berlin staying with...

396
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,960
No one knows he's here.
Don't tell your father.

397
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,200
- Why not?
- Your father's so Austrian.

398
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,640
We're all Austrian.

399
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,080
Some think we ought to be German, and
they're very mad at those who don't.

400
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:02,520
They're getting ready to...

401
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,960
Let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

402
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,920
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.
He was even decorated by the emperor.

403
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,560
I don't worry about him.
I worry about his daughter.

404
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
Me? Why?

405
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,120
- Well, you're so...
- What?

406
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,000
You're such a baby!

407
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,520
I'm 16.
What's such a baby about that?

408
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,560
<i>You wait, little girl</i>
<i>On an empty stage</i>

409
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,400
<i>For fate to turn the light on</i>

410
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,760
<i>Your life, little girl</i>
<i>Is an empty page</i>

411
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,360
<i>That men will want to write on</i>

412
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:45,520
<i>To write on</i>

413
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,480
<i>You are 16 going on 17</i>

414
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,320
<i>Baby, it's time to think</i>

415
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,080
<i>Better beware</i>
<i>Be canny and careful</i>

416
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,880
<i>Baby, you're on the brink</i>

417
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,760
<i>You are 16 going on 17</i>

418
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,560
<i>Fellows will fall in line</i>

419
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,960
<i>Eager young lads</i>
<i>And roués and cads</i>

420
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,960
<i>Will offer you food and wine</i>

421
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,000
<i>Totally unprepared are you</i>

422
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,960
<i>To face a world of men</i>

423
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,200
<i>Timid and shy and scared are you</i>

424
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,800
<i>Of things beyond your ken</i>

425
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,720
<i>You need someone older and wiser</i>

426
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,680
<i>Telling you what to do</i>

427
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>I am 17 going on 18</i>

428
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:50,640
<i>I'll take care of you</i>

429
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,520
<i>I am 16 going on 17</i>

430
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,000
<i>I know that I'm naive</i>

431
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,320
<i>Fellows I meet</i>
<i>May tell me I'm sweet</i>

432
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,320
<i>And willingly I believe</i>

433
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,600
<i>I am 16 going on 17</i>

434
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,400
<i>Innocent as a rose</i>

435
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,960
<i>Bachelor dandies</i>
<i>Drinkers of brandies</i>

436
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,400
<i>What do I know of those?</i>

437
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,000
<i>Totally unprepared am I</i>

438
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,800
<i>To face a world of men</i>

439
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,200
<i>Timid and shy and scared am I</i>

440
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,200
<i>Of things beyond my ken</i>

441
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,880
<i>I need someone older and wiser</i>

442
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,400
<i>Telling me what to do</i>

443
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,120
<i>You are 17 going on 18</i>

444
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:21,280
<i>I'll depend on you</i>

445
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,880
Whee!

446
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,320
Come in.

447
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,640
Frau Schmidt.

448
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,080
For your new dresses.

449
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,200
- The captain had these sent from town.
- Oh, how lovely!

450
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,760
These will make the prettiest
clothes I've ever had.

451
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,360
Do you think he would
get me more material if I asked?

452
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,080
- How many dresses do you need?
- Not for me, for the children.

453
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,280
I want to make them some play clothes.

454
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,160
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

455
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,480
Surely you don't approve of that.

456
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,000
Ever since the captain
lost his poor wife...

457
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,400
...he runs this house as if on
one of his ships.

458
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,960
Whistles, orders.

459
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,000
No more music, no more laughing.

460
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,880
Nothing that reminds him of her.
Even the children.

461
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,720
But that's so wrong.

462
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,400
Oh, well.

463
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,160
How do you like your room?
There'll be new drapes at the windows.

464
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,600
Bu these are fine.

465
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,360
New ones have been ordered.

466
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,800
- But I really don't need them.
- Good night, now.

467
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,920
Frau Schmidt, if I asked
the captain about the material...?

468
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,760
- He's leaving in the morning.
- Of course. How long will he be gone?

469
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,280
It depends. The last time he visited
the baroness, he stayed for a month.

470
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,920
I shouldn't be saying this to you.
I don't know you that well.

471
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,920
But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking seriously...

472
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,280
...of marrying her before
summer's over.

473
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,800
Wonderful! The children will
have a mother again.

474
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,280
Yes.

475
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,160
Well, good night.

476
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,240
Good night.

477
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,120
Dear Father, now I know
why You sent me here.

478
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,120
To help these children
prepare for a new mother.

479
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,480
And I pray this will become
a happy family in Thy sight.

480
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,680
God bless the captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

481
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,960
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

482
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,400
And I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

483
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,280
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

484
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,400
God bless the Reverend Mother
and Sister Margaretta...

485
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,280
...and everybody at the abbey.

486
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,160
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

487
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,160
Help her know that I'm her friend...

488
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:36,320
...and help her tell me
what she's been up to.

489
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,720
- Are you going to tell on me?
- Shh.

490
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,240
Help me to be understanding
so I may guide her footsteps.

491
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,000
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

492
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,120
I was out walking
and somebody locked the doors early.

493
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:52,360
I didn't want to wake everybody,
so when I saw your window open...

494
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,880
You're not going to tell Father,
are you?

495
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,840
Hm.

496
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,680
How did you climb up?

497
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,880
It's how we always got in
to play tricks on the governess.

498
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,720
Louisa can make it with
a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

499
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,280
Spiders?

500
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,880
Oh. Liesl.

501
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,120
Were you out walking all by yourself?

502
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,760
If we wash that dress tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.

503
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,200
You could put this on.

504
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,920
Take your dress and put it
to soak in the bathtub.

505
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:39,560
Come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

506
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,680
I told you today
I didn't need a governess.

507
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,400
Well, maybe I do.

508
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,520
Gretl, are you scared?

509
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,120
You're not frightened
of a storm, are you?

510
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,440
You just stay right here with me.

511
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,200
- Where are the others?
- They're asleep. They're not scared.

512
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,200
Oh, no? Look.

513
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,080
All right, up here on the bed.

514
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,760
- Really?
- Well, just this once. Come on.

515
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,640
- Now we'll wait for the boys.
- You won't see them. Boys are brave.

516
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,960
You weren't scared, were you?

517
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,120
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

518
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,280
- That's very thoughtful of you.
It wasn't my idea.

519
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,280
It was Kurt's!

520
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,520
Kurt! That's the one I left out!
God bless Kurt.

521
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,400
Why does it do that?

522
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,320
The lightning talks to the thunder,
and the thunder answers.

523
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,960
- But lightning must be nasty.
- Not really.

524
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,360
Why does the thunder get so angry?

525
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,200
It makes me want to cry.

526
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,
I just try to think of nice things.

527
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,960
What kind of things?

528
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,080
Well, let me see. Nice things...

529
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Daffodils.

530
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,080
Green meadows.

531
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,440
Skies full of stars.

549
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,200
- Does it work?
- Of course.

550
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,760

Hello.

576
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,360
Frylein, did I not tell you that
bedtime is to be strictly observed?

577
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,280
The children were upset
by the storm, so I...

578
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,480
You did, sir.

579
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,760
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

580
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,600
Only during thunderstorms.

581
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,360
- Liesl?
- Yes?

582
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,080
I don't recall seeing you
after dinner.

583
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,000
Really? As a matter of fact...

584
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,960
Yes?

585
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,280
Well, I was...

586
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,520
What she would like to say...

587
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,480
...is that she and I have
been getting acquainted tonight.

588
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:36,840
It's too late to go into that. You
heard your father. Go back to bed.

589
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,200
Frylein...

590
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,120
...you have managed to remember
I'm leaving in the morning?

591
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:52,240
Is it also possible you remember the
first rule in this house is discipline?

592
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,960
Then I trust that before I return...

593
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,000
...you'll have acquired some?

Captain?

595
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,200
Could I talk to you about clothes
for the children for when they play?

596
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,080
- If I could have some material.
- You are many things.

Not the least of which is repetitious.

- But they're children!
- Yes.

599
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
And I'm their father.

Frylein Maria?

612
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,080
Can we do this every day?

613
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,520
- Don't you think you'd get tired of it?
- I suppose so.

as nice as you can play such tricks.

- It's easy.
- But why do it?

618

Father's attention?

Oh, I see.

620

All right, over here.

What are we going to do?

623
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,080
Think of a song for the baroness.

624
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,200
Father doesn't like us to sing.

625
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,880
Perhaps we can change his mind.
Now, what songs do you know?

We don't know any songs.

627
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:50,480
- Not any?
- We don't even know how to sing.

628
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,680
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

629
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,040
But how?

630
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,480
<i>Let's start at the very beginning</i>

631
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,920
<i>A very good place to start</i>

632
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,000
<i>When you read you begin with</i>

633
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,320
<i>A, B, C</i>

634
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,760
<i>When you sing, you begin with</i>
<i>Do-Re-Mi</i>

635
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,560
<i>Do-re-mi</i>

636
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,080
<i>Do-re-mi</i>

637
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,000
<i>The first three notes</i>
<i>Just happen to be</i>

638
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,920
<i>Do-re-mi</i>

639
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,400
<i>Do-re-mi</i>

640
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,800
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti</i>

641
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,840
Let's see if I can make it easier.

642
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,120
<i>"Doe", a deer</i>
<i>A female deer</i>

643
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,800
<i>"Ray", a drop of golden sun</i>

644
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,680
<i>"Me", a name I call myself</i>

645
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,480
<i>"Far", a long long way to run</i>

646
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,360
<i>"Sew", a needle pulling thread</i>

647
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,280
<i>"La", a note to follow sew</i>

648
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,600
<i>"Tea", a drink with jam and bread</i>

649
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,000
<i>That will bring us back to doe</i>

650
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,680
<i>- Doe</i>
<i>- A deer, a female deer</i>

651
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,000
<i>- Ray</i>
<i>- A drop of golden sun</i>

652
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,360
<i>- Me</i>
<i>- A name I call myself</i>

653
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,880
<i>- Far</i>
<i>- A long long way to run</i>

654
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,400
<i>Sew, a needle pulling thread</i>

655
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,000
<i>- La</i>
<i>- A note to follow sew</i>

656
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,000
<i>- Tea</i>
<i>- A drink with jam and bread</i>

657
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,400
<i>That will bring us back to</i>

658
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,960
<i>- Doe</i>
<i>- A deer, a female deer</i>

659
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,320
<i>Ray, a drop of golden sun</i>

660
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,680
<i>Me, a name I call myself</i>

661
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,880
<i>Far, a long long way to run</i>

662
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,240
<i>Sew, a needle pulling thread</i>

663
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,760
<i>La, a note to follow sew</i>

664
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,480
<i>Tea, a drink with jam and bread</i>

665
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,760
<i>That will bring us back to doe</i>

666
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,160
<i>Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do</i>

667
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,800
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only
the tools we use to build a song.

668
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,120
Once you have them in your head
you can sing different tunes...

669
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,360
...by mixing them up. Like this:

670
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,880
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

671
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,120
Can you do that?

672
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,600
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

673
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,280
<i>So-do-la-ti-do-re-do</i>

674
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,600
<i>So-do-la-ti-do-re-do</i>

675
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,480
Now, put it all together.

676
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,080
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

677
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:51,320
<i>So-do-la-ti-do-re-do</i>

678
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,080
- Good.
- But it doesn't mean anything.

679
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,160
So we put in words.
One word for every note.

680
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,600
Like this:

681
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:05,120
<i>When you know the notes to sing</i>

682
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,800
<i>You can sing most anything</i>

683
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,920
Together!

684
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,600
<i>When you know the notes to sing</i>

685
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:25,400
<i>You can sing most anything</i>

686
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,880
<i>- Doe</i>
<i>- A deer, a female deer</i>

687
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,160
<i>- Ray</i>
<i>- A drop of golden sun</i>

688
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,520
<i>- Me</i>
<i>- A name I call myself</i>

689
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,680
<i>- Far</i>
<i>- A long long way to run</i>

690
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,160
<i>- Sew</i>
<i>- A needle pulling thread</i>

691
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,520
<i>- La</i>
<i>- A note to follow sew</i>

692
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,600
<i>- Tea</i>
<i>- A drink with jam and bread</i>

693
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,720
<i>That will bring us back to doe</i>

694
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,600
<i>Do. Re. Mi. Fa. So. La. Ti.</i>

695
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,880
<i>- Do-do.</i>
<i>- Ti. La. So.</i>

696
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,120
<i>Fa. Mi. Re.</i>

697
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,120
<i>Do</i>
<i>- Mi-mi</i>

698
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,360
<i>So-so</i>

699
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,000
<i>- Re</i>
<i>- Fa-fa</i>

700
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,760
<i>- La</i>
<i>- Ti-ti</i>

701
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,400
<i>Do-mi-mi-mi-so-so</i>

702
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:09,120
<i>Re-fa-fa-la-ti-ti</i>

703
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,720
<i>When you know the notes to sing</i>

704
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:22,520
<i>You can sing most anything</i>

705
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,800
<i>Doe</i>
<i>A deer, a female deer</i>

706
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,400
<i>Ray</i>
<i>A drop of golden sun</i>

707
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,960
<i>Me</i>
<i>A name I call myself</i>

708
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,200
<i>Far</i>
<i>A long long way to run</i>

709
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,480
<i>Sew</i>
<i>A needle pulling thread</i>

710
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:43,080
<i>La</i>
<i>A note to follow sew</i>

711
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
<i>Tea</i>
<i>A drink with jam and bread</i>

712
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,880
<i>That will bring us back to</i>

713
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:56,680
<i>So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re</i>

714
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,200
<i>So-do-la-fa-ti</i>

715
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:04,520
<i>La-so</i>

716
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,960
<i>Ti-do</i>

717
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,080
<i>So-do</i>

718
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,480
The mountains are magnificent,
really magnificent.

719
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,280
- I had them put up just for you.
- Oh?

720
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,640
Even if it's to a height
of 10,000 feet...

721
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,240
...Georg always believes in
"rising to the occasion".

722
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,040
Improve the jokes
or I'll disinvite you.

723
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,760
You didn't invite me.
I invited myself.

724
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,440
- Naturally.
- You needed a chaperone...

725
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,280
...and I needed a place
where the cuisine is superb...

726
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,080
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

727
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,960
...and the price perfect.

728
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,960
Max, you are outrageous.

729
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,000
Not at all.
I'm a very charming sponge.

730
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:06,120
Listen.

731
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,520
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

732
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,240
They're good.

733
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,560
Very good.

734
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,280
I must explore this area
in the next few days.

735
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,880
Somewhere, a hungry singing group
is waiting for Max Detweiler...

736
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,200
...to pluck it out and make it famous
at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

737
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,600
- They get fame, you get money.
- It's unfair, I admit it.

738
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,160
But someday that'll be changed.
I shall get the fame too.

739
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,000
Good heavens, what's this?

740
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,920
It's nothing.
Just some local urchins.

741
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,360
This really is exciting for me, Georg.
Being here with you.

742
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,080
Trees, lakes,
you've seen them before.

743
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,840
That is not what I mean,
and you know it.

744
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,880
- You mean me? I'm exciting?
- Is that so impossible?

745
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,040
No, just highly improbable.

746
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,720
- There you go, running yourself down.
- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

747
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,400
You're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.

748
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,360
- In my natural habitat?
- Yes, exactly.

749
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,680
Are you saying that I'm more
at home...

750
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,760
...among the birds and the flowers
and the wind that moves...

751
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,080
...through the trees
like a restless sea?

752
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,800
How poetic.

753
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,680
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

754
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,800
More at home here than in Vienna
in all your glittering salons...

755
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,240
...gossiping gaily with bores I
detest, soaking myself in champagne...

756
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,080
...stumbling about to waltzes
by Strausses I can't even remember?

757
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,360
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes.

758
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,320
Now whatever gave you that idea?

759
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,880
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It's so lovely and peaceful.

760
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,000
How can you leave it so often?

761
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,960
Oh, pretending to be madly active,
I suppose.

762
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,800
Activity suggests a life
filled with purpose.

763
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,280
Could it be running away
from memories?

764
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,040
Mm-hm.

765
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,440
Or perhaps just searching
for a reason to stay.

766
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,440
I hope that's why you've been
coming to Vienna so often.

767
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,840
- Were there other distractions?
- I'd hardly call you a distraction.

768
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:43,120
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

769
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,760
Lovely...

770
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,480
...charming, witty, graceful,
the perfect hostess...

771
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,600
...and, you're going to hate me
for this...

772
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
...in a way, my savior.

773
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,800
Oh, how unromantic.

774
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,280
I'd be an ungrateful wretch
if I didn't say...

775
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:03,120
...that you brought some meaning back
into my life.

776
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,000
I am amusing, I suppose.

777
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,800
I have the finest couturier in Vienna
and a glittering circle of friends.

778
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,040
- I do give some rather gay parties.
- Oh, yes.

779
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,000
But take all that away...

780
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,880
...and you have just wealthy,
unattached little me...

781
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,840
...searching, just like you.

782
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,960
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

783
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,680
- How many have I had?
- Two.

784
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,240
Make it an uneven three.

785
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,800
Still eating, Max?
Must be unhappy.

786
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,840
That mixed quartet I've been trying
to steal away from Sol Hurok...

787
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,600
- What happened?
...Sascha Petrie stole them first.

788
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,080
I hate thieves.

789
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,480
Max, you really must try
and learn to love yourself.

790
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,960
I had to call Paris, Rome
and Stockholm.

791
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,840
- On Georg's telephone, of course.
- How else could I afford it?

792
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:03,040
I like rich people, the way they live
and how I live when I'm with them.

793
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,360
I wonder where the children are.

794
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,040
They must have heard
I was coming and hid.

795
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,680
I was hoping they'd be here
to welcome you.

796
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,720
Max, do step out of character for
a moment and try and be charming.

797
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,880
Well?

798
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,240
Well what?

799
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,280
Have you made up his mind?
Do I hear wedding bells?

800
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,440
- Pealing madly.
- Marvelous.

801
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,240
- Not necessarily for me.
- What kind of talk's that?

802
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,040
None-of-your-business talk.

803
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,680
I'm terribly fond of him,
so don't toy with us.

804
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,360
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So tell me everything.

805
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:49,680
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,
intimate, disgusting detail.

806
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,880
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.

807
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,040
- I approve of that. How can you miss?
- Far too easily.

808
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,360
If I know you, darling,
and I do, you will find a way.

809
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,040
- He's no ordinary man.
- No, he's rich.

810
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,400
His wife's death gave him
a great heartache.

811
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,600
And your husband's death
gave you a great fortune.

812
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,680
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

813
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,760
You and Georg are like family.
That's why I want to see you married.

814
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,920
We must keep all that lovely money
in the family.

815
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,880
- What are you doing there?
- Oh, Captain von Trapp.

816
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,680
I was just looking for...

817
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,960
I didn't see, I mean,
I didn't know you were...

818
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,280
Heil Hitler!

819
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,960
Who are you?

820
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,320
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

821
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:53,720
- I am Herr Detweiler.
- Yes, sir.

822
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:01,120
You've delivered your telegram.
Now get out.

823
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,280
- Georg, he's just a boy.
- Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

824
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,240
Things will happen.
Make sure they don't happen to you.

825
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,080
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

826
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,440
I have no political convictions.

827
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,280
- Can I help it if other people do?
- You can help it.

828
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:25,120
You must help it.

829
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,520
Hello?

830
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,280
You're far away. Where are you?

831
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:43,680
In a world that's disappearing,
I'm afraid.

832
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:49,920
Is there any way I could bring you
back to the world I'm in?

833
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,480
<i>And that will bring us back to doe</i>

834
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,200
<i>A deer, a female deer</i>

835
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,240
- Father! Father!
- There's your father!

836
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,520
Oh, captain, you're home!

837
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:31,120
Come out of that water at once!

838
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,920
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

839
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,920
I'm soaked to the skin!

840
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,720
Straight line!

841
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:19,120
This is Baroness Schraeder.

842
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,800
And these...

843
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,360
...are my children.

844
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,880
How do you do?

845
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:33,120
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change
your clothes and report back here!

846
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:39,920
Frylein, you will stay here, please!

847
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:45,000
I think I'd better go see
what Max is up to.

848
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,520
Now, frylein...

849
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,000
...I want a truthful answer.

850
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,680
Yes, captain.

851
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:06,040
Is it possible,
or could I have just imagined it?

852
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,800
Have my children, by any chance,
been climbing trees today?

853
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,960
Yes, captain.

854
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,760
I see.

855
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,320
And where, may I ask,
did they get these...

856
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,520
- Play clothes.
- Is that what they are?

857
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,560
I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.

858
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,800
- Drapes?
- They have plenty of wear left.

859
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,880
We've been everywhere in them.

860
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,400
Are you telling me that my children
have been roaming about Salzburg...

861
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,800
...dressed up in nothing
but some old drapes?

862
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,600
And having a marvelous time!

863
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,920
- They have uniforms.
- Forgive me, straitjackets.

864
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,840
They can't be children
if they worry about clothes...

865
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,160
They don't complain.

866
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,960
They don't dare.
They love you too much and fear...

867
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,680
Don't discuss my children.

868
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,720
You've got to hear, you're
never home...

869
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,360
I don't want to hear more!

870
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,560
I know you don't, but you've got to!

871
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,880
- Liesl's not a child.
- Not one word...

872
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,880
Soon she'll be a woman
and you won't even know her.

873
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,080
Friedrich wants to be a man
but you're not here to show...

874
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,600
Don't you dare tell me...

875
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,960
Brigitta could tell you about him.
She notices everything.

876
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,160
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain
when you ignore him...

877
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,880
...the way you do all of them.

878
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,440
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

879
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,760
The little ones just want love.
Please, love them all.

880
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,480
I don't care to hear more.

881
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:30,120
- I am not finished yet, captain!
- Oh, yes, you are, captain!

882
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,200
Frylein.

883
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,400
Now, you will pack
your things this minute...

884
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,000
...and return to the abbey.

885
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,320
What's that?

886
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,880
It's singing.

887
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,480
Yes, I realize it's singing.
But who is singing?

888
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,720
The children.

889
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,560
The children?

890
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,920
I taught them something to sing
for the baroness.

891
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,640
<i>My heart wants to sing</i>
<i>Every song it hears</i>

892
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,360
<i>Every song that it hears</i>

893
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,840
<i>My heart wants to beat like the wings</i>
<i>Of the birds that rise</i>

894
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,080
<i>From the lake to the trees</i>

895
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,680
<i>To the trees</i>

896
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,600
<i>My heart wants to sigh</i>
<i>Like a chime that flies</i>

897
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,280
<i>From a church on a breeze</i>

898
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,280
<i>To laugh like a brook</i>
<i>When it trips and falls</i>

899
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,360
<i>Over stones on its way</i>

900
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,960
<i>On its way</i>

901
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,400
<i>To sing through the night</i>

902
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,080
<i>Like a lark who is learning to pray</i>

903
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,600
<i>I go to the hills</i>

904
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,840
<i>When my heart is lonely</i>

905
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,640
<i>I know I will hear</i>

906
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:11,960
<i>What I've heard before</i>

907
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,280
<i>My heart will be blessed</i>

908
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:23,800
<i>With the sound of music</i>

909
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:29,000
<i>And I'll sing...</i>

910
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:38,520
<i>... once more</i>

911
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,120
Edelweiss!

912
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,920
You never told me how enchanting
your children are.

913
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,720
Don't go away.

914
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,920
Frylein.

915
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,960
I...

916
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:43,400
...behaved badly. I apologize.

917
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,200
I'm far too outspoken.
It's one of my worst faults.

918
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,320
You were right.

919
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:54,040
I don't know my children.

920
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,280
There's still time, captain.
They want so much to be close to you.

921
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:03,280
And you brought music back
into the house.

922
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,400
I'd forgotten.

923
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,320
Frylein.

924
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,920
I want you to stay.

925
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:20,400
I ask you to stay.

926
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,360
- If I could be of any help.
- You have already.

927
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,080
More than you know.

928
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,240
Marta.

929
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:49,200
Curtain!

930
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:54,920
<i>High on a hill was a lonely goatherd</i>

931
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:59,200
<i>Loud was the voice</i>
<i>Of the lonely goatherd</i>

932
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:04,120
<i>Folks in a town</i>
<i>That was quite remote heard</i>

933
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:08,720
<i>Lusty and clear</i>
<i>From the goatherd's throat heard</i>

934
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:22,520
Marta. Marta!

935
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:26,720
Gretl, the prince!

936
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,360
<i>A prince on the bridge</i>
<i>Of a castle moat heard</i>

937
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,360
<i>Men on a road</i>
<i>With a load to tote heard</i>

938
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,480
<i>Men in the midst</i>
<i>Of a table d'hôte heard</i>

939
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,080
<i>Men drinking beer</i>
<i>With the foam afloat heard</i>

940
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:58,920
<i>One little girl</i>
<i>In a pale pink coat heard</i>

941
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:03,080
<i>She yodeled back</i>
<i>To the lonely goatherd</i>

942
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,840
<i>Soon her mama</i>
<i>With a gleaming gloat heard</i>

943
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,720
<i>What a duet for a girl and goatherd</i>

944
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:00,240
<i>One little girl</i>
<i>In a pale pink coat heard</i>

945
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,680
<i>She yodeled back</i>
<i>To the lonely goatherd</i>

946
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:09,360
<i>Soon her mama</i>
<i>With a gleaming gloat heard</i>

947
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,120
<i>What a duet for a girl and goatherd</i>

948
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,800
<i>Happy are they</i>

949
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,880
<i>Soon the duet will become a trio</i>

950
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,800
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

951
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,560
Very good!

952
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:49,960
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

953
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,360
Wonderful!

954
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,600
- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?
Yes, can we?

955
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,760
Of course you may, my darlings.

956
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,520
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?

957
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,720
Well done, frylein.

958
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,480
I really am very much impressed.

959
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:15,120
They're your children, captain.

960
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,760
My dear, is there anything
you can't do?

961
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,200
Well, I'm not sure
I'll make a good nun.

962
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:29,920
If you have any problems,
I'd be happy to help you.

963
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,760
Attention, everyone!

964
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,280
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise! Surprise!

965
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,760
Today, after a long
and desperate search...

966
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,760
...I have found a most exciting
entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

967
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
Congratulations, Max.

968
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,320
And who will you
be exploiting this time?

969
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,080
- The Saint Ignatius Choir?
- Guess again.

970
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,080
Well, let me see now.
The Klopmann Choir?

971
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,560
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no?

972
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,920
Tell us.

973
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,480
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

974
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,480
What a charming idea!

975
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,040
Whose family?

976
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,800
Yours.

977
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,720
They'll be the talk of the festival.

978
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,880
- Well, now, what's so funny?
- You are, Max.

979
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,600
You're expensive, but very funny.

980
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,080
- They'll be a sensation!
- No, Max.

981
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,360
It's a wonderful idea.
Fresh, original.

982
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,640
Max! My children
do not sing in public.

983
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,720
You can't blame me for trying.

984
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:41,320
Children, who shall we hear
from next?

985
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,600
Who?

986
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,320
Yes.

987
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,200
Yes.

988
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,880
The vote is unanimous.

989
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,640
You, captain.

990
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,600
Me?

991
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,520
- I don't understand.
- Please.

992
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,040
No, no, no, no.

993
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,200
I'm told that you were quite good.

994
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,640
- That was a very, very long time ago.
- I remember, Father.

995
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:20,120
- Play us something we know.
- Oh, please, Father.

996
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:23,920
Well...

997
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,360
- Why didn't you tell me?
- What?

998
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:38,320
To bring along my harmonica.

999
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:42,600
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1000
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,640

01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,280
<i>Blossom of snow</i>

1007
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,480

1025
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,000
Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act:

1026
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:50,440
The von Trapp Family Singers.

1027
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,080
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1028
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,680
Let's really fill this house
with music.

1029
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,760
You must give a grand
and glorious party for me.

1030
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,560
- A party?
- Yes, Father, please!

1031
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,080
It's high time
I met all your friends...

1032
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,760
...and they met me.
Don't you agree?

1033
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,160
- I see what you mean.
- Oh, please!

1034
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,080
Children, it's bedtime.
Come now, say good night.

1035
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,560
Good night, Father.

1036
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,480
- Good night.
- Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

1037
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,360
Good night, Father.

1038
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,840
Good night.

1039
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:25,320
Good night, Uncle Max.

1040
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:30,200
It'll be my first party, Father!

1041
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,400
- Captain.
- Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

1042
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:06,640
- Good evening, Herr Zeller.
- Baroness.

1043
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,720
How do you do? Good evening.

1044
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,800
Did you notice the obvious
display of the Austrian flag?

1045
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,840
The women look so beautiful.

1046
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,400
I think they look ugly.

1047
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,320
You're just scared of them.

1048
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,080
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1049
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:52,240
- I think the men look beautiful.
- How would you know?

1050
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,200
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1051
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,560
Nobody.

1052
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,120
Oh, yes, you are.

1053
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,400
May I have this dance?

1054
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,520
I'd be delighted, young man.

1055
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,080
Why didn't you tell me
you could dance?

1056
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:35,520
We feared you'd make us all dance.
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1057
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,880
What are they playing?

1058
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,560
It's the Laendler.
An Austrian folk dance.

1059
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,840
- Show me.
- I haven't danced since I was little.

1060
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,960
You remember. Please?

1061
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,080
- Well...
- Please.

1062
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,680
All right. Come on over here.

1063
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,280
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1064
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,360
- Like this?
- Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1065
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,160
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1066
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,840
One, two, three, step together.
Now, step hop, step hop.

1067
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,600
Now turn under. Not quite.

1068
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:14,040
This way. Hop step, hop.
And under.

1069
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,880
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1070
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,040
Do allow me, will you?

1071
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,520
I don't remember anymore.

1072
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:49,240
- Your face is all red.
- Is it?

1073
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,480
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1074
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,000
Why, that was beautifully done.

1075
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,080
What a lovely couple you make.

1076
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,360
It's time the children
said good night.

1077
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,880
We'll be in the hall.

1078
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,880
- We have something special prepared.
- Right!

1079
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:07,760
Yes, come on!

1080
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,080
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1081
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:19,720
You thought you wouldn't find
a friend at the party.

1082
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,440
- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
- Oh, I don't know.

1083
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,080
It seemed rather warm to me.

1084
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:32,280
Ladies and gentlemen.

1085
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:37,920
The children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

1086
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,680
<i>There's a sad sort of clanging</i>
<i>From the clock in the hall</i>

1087
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,520
<i>And the bells in the steeple too</i>

1088
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,600
<i>And up in the nursery</i>
<i>An absurd little bird</i>

1089
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,160
<i>Is popping up to say "coo-coo"</i>

1090
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,000
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1091
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,400
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1092
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,680
<i>- Regretfully they tell us</i>
<i>- Coo-coo</i>

1093
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,240
<i>- But firmly they compel us</i>
<i>- Coo-coo</i>

1094
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,400
<i>- To say goodbye</i>
<i>- Coo-coo</i>

1095
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:21,200
<i>To you</i>

1096
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,480
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, good night</i>

1097
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:31,880
<i>I hate to go</i>
<i>And leave this pretty sight</i>

1098
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,960
<i>So long, farewell,</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, adieu</i>

1099
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:46,080
<i>Adieu, adieu</i>
<i>To you and you and you</i>

1100
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:55,320
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen</i>

1101
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,360
<i>I'd like to stay</i>
<i>And taste my first champagne</i>

1102
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,400
- Yes?
- No.

1103
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,680
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1104
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,680
<i>I leave and heave a sigh</i>
<i>And say goodbye</i>

1105
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:19,240
<i>Goodbye</i>

1106
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,640
<i>I'm glad to go</i>

1107
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,720
<i>I cannot tell a lie</i>

1108
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,840
<i>I flit, I float</i>

1109
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,880
<i>I fleetly flee, I fly</i>

1110
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,520
<i>The sun has gone to bed</i>

1111
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,280
<i>And so must I</i>

1112
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,840
<i>So long</i>

1113
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,480
<i>Farewell</i>

1114
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,920
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1115
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:08,720
<i>Goodbye</i>

1116
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,280
<i>Goodbye</i>

1117
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:21,080
<i>Goodbye</i>

1118
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:30,920
<i>Goodbye</i>

1119
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,920
Extraordinary!
What they'd do at the festival.

1120
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:40,240
Young lady,
I must have a word with you.

1121
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,360
Georg, you won't let this girl
get away. She must join the party.

1122
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,920
- No, really I...
- Stop. Stop it now.

1123
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,960
- Georg, please.
- You can if you want to, frylein.

1124
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,560
I insist.
You will be my dinner partner.

1125
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,640
This is business.
Franz...

1126
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,400
...set another place next to mine
for Frylein Maria.

1127
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,120
- Whatever you say.
- It appears to be all arranged.

1128
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,960
- It does.
- I'm not suitably dressed.

1129
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,160
You can change. We'll wait.

1130
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,880
All right.

1131
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,880
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

1132
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:14,960
I am, thank you.

1133
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,560
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in our country...

1134
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,240
...than the innocent voices
of our children?

1135
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,800
Oh, come now, baron.

1136
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,240
Would you have us believe that Austria
holds a monopoly on virtue?

1137
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:33,440
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song...

1138
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:36,760
...to ugly German threats.

1139
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,440
The ostrich buries his head
in the sand...

1140
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,760
...and sometimes in the flag.

1141
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,040
Perhaps those who would warn you that
the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1142
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,800
...would get further with you by setting
their words to music.

1143
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,560
If the Nazis take over Austria, you
will be the entire trumpet section.

1144
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,560
You flatter me.

1145
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:04,000
Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.

1146
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:12,320
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, baroness.

1147
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,280
I'm delighted, Maria.

1148
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,320
I really don't think I have anything
that would be appropriate.

1149
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:22,520
Now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening?

1150
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:27,400
When the captain couldn't keep
his eyes off you.

1151
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:31,920
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1152
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,920
Come, my dear, we are women.

1153
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,360
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1154
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:41,200
- Here we are.
- The captain notices everybody.

1155
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,800
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1156
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,360
You are quite attractive, you know.

1157
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:51,600
The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

1158
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,120
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1159
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:55,560
Not at all.

1160
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,320
I've never done a thing to...

1161
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,480
You don't have to, my dear.

1162
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:05,280
Nothing's more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

1163
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,560
- In love with him?
- Of course.

1164
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,560
What makes it so nice is
he thinks he's in love with you.

1165
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,320
But that's not true.

1166
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,960
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1167
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:25,880
And you know, you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1168
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,760
Don't take it to heart.

1169
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,200
He'll get over it soon enough,
I think.

1170
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:33,080
Men do, you know.

1171
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:35,360
Then I should go.

1172
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,520
I mustn't stay here.

1173
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:51,800
- Is there something I can do to help?
- No, nothing.

1174
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,960
Yes.

1175
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:57,640
Don't say a word to the captain.

1176
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:02,600
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1177
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,680
Goodbye, Maria.

1178
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,080
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1179
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,480
Champagne, darling.

1180
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:49,000
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1181
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,560
- You know something.
- Perhaps.

1182
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,160
If you're so clever, tell me how to
get frylein to influence Georg.

1183
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,080
I want those children in the festival.

1184
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,520
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1185
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,400
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1186
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,120
I thought of that.

1187
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,680
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1188
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,200
...maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1189
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,960
Two.
Three.

1190
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,600
Four.
Five.

1191
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,800
- Six.
- Seven.

1192
01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:41,600
Eight.

1193
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:44,400
- Four.
- Two.

1194
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:46,360
Seven.
Five.

1195
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:50,200
- Two.
- Six.

1196
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:56,200
Isn't this fun?

1197
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:58,760
- Four.
- I'm number five.

1198
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:01,080
- Oh, yes.
Eight.

1199
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:03,760
Two.
Four.

1200
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,600
Six.

1201
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:09,600
Two.

1202
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:12,680
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind
if we stop now? We're tired.

1203
01:41:12,920 --> 01:41:14,800
Whatever you want, dear.

1204
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,400
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1205
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:29,560
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1206
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,320
Have some lemonade.

1207
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,000
There must be an easier way.

1208
01:41:35,240 --> 01:41:39,080
I get a fiendish delight thinking
of you as the mother of seven.

1209
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,080
How do you plan to do it?

1210
01:41:41,320 --> 01:41:43,280
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1211
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,320
...of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

1212
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:50,800
Baroness Machiavelli.

1213
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,960
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1214
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:54,920
I think he's in the house.

1215
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,600
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pussies?

1216
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:00,480
- Nothing.
- I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1217
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:01,520
What for?

1218
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,120
Let's make believe we're on-stage
at the festival.

1219
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:08,080
- I don't feel like singing.
- Not without Frylein Maria.

1220
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:10,600
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1221
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:13,680
Everybody into the group.
Get in your places.

1222
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:18,040
Now be cheerful, right?
Give us the key, Liesl.

1223
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:20,920
Now, impress me.

1224
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,120
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1225
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:29,480
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1226
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:32,600
But you sang so beautifully
the night of the party.

1227
01:42:32,840 --> 01:42:35,080
Come on, all of you.
Try something you know.

1228
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,760
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1229
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,040
All right, Liesl.

1230
01:42:40,440 --> 01:42:45,600
<i>The hills are alive</i>

1231
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:54,120
<i>With the sound of music</i>

1232
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:59,200
<i>With songs they have sung</i>

1233
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:07,360
<i>For a thousand years</i>

1234
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:12,800
<i>The hills fill my heart</i>

1235
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:20,520
<i>With the sound of music</i>

1236
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:23,280
They wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

1237
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,800
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop.

1238
01:43:29,200 --> 01:43:33,120
- Something long and cool, Georg?
- No, thank you, darling.

1239
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,880
- Father?
- Yes, Brigitta?

1240
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:38,320
Is it true Frylein Maria
isn't coming back?

1241
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,600
Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?

1242
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:46,800
Pink lemonade.
Laced with lemonade.

1243
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:48,520
I don't believe it, Father.

1244
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:49,600
Hm?

1245
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,920
- What?
- About Frylein Maria.

1246
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:53,360
Oh, Frylein Maria!

1247
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,400
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

1248
01:43:57,640 --> 01:44:00,080
She said she missed her life
at the abbey.

1249
01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:02,360
She had to leave us.

1250
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,640
And that's all there is to it.

1251
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:08,320
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

1252
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:11,200
- She didn't even say goodbye.
- She did in her note.

1253
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,200
That isn't the same thing.

1254
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,520
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1255
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:18,800
Just too pink.

1256
01:44:19,040 --> 01:44:23,480
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

1257
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,840
Well...

1258
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:36,800
...you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1259
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,000
- We're not?
- No.

1260
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:44,560
You're going to have a new mother.

1261
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,280
A new mother?

1262
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,520
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

1263
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:54,800
And we're all going to be very happy.

1264
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,800
Well, all right, all right.
Run off and play.

1265
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:58,920
Yes, my children?

1266
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,680
- My name is Liesl.
- Yes, Liesl?

1267
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,600
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see Frylein Maria.

1268
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:09,200
Frylein Maria?

1269
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:12,800
Oh, Maria.

1270
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:16,400
Come in, please.

1271
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:21,600
Wait here.

1272
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,720
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

1273
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:36,360
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here?

1274
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,080
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
- But you've got to!

1275
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:41,280
- She's our governess.
- We want her back.

1276
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,360
She didn't even say goodbye.

1277
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:45,800
All we want to do is talk to her.

1278
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:48,800
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in seclusion.

1279
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:52,000
- She hasn't been seeing anyone.
- She'll see us.

1280
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:54,600
I want to show her my finger.

1281
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:56,680
Some other time, dear.

1282
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,160
I'll tell her you were here.

1283
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:01,720
- It was sweet of you to call.
- We have to speak to her!

1284
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:04,920
Run along, children.
Run along home.

1285
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:06,760
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1286
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,120
Sister Margaretta, please.

1287
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:14,400
- Goodbye, children.
Sister Margaretta, please?

1288
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:17,280
What was that about, Sister?

1289
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:19,600
The von Trapp children,
Reverend Mother.

1290
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:22,200
They want to see Maria.

1291
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,680
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

1292
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:28,760
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1293
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,920
Poor child.

1294
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:33,000
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here...

1295
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:37,320
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1296
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:40,560
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1297
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:43,320
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1298
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:46,600
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1299
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:54,560
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant
to the robing room.

1300
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:56,920
God bless you, my daughter.

1301
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:06,040
Yes, bring her in.

1302
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:16,800
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1303
01:48:17,320 --> 01:48:18,600
Reverend Mother.

1304
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:21,920
Why did they send you back to us?

1305
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:25,480
They didn't send me back.
I left.

1306
01:48:26,440 --> 01:48:28,200
Sit down, Maria.

1307
01:48:28,440 --> 01:48:31,640
Tell me what happened.

1308
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,400
I was frightened.

1309
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:40,960
- Frightened? Were they unkind to you.
- Oh, no!

1310
01:48:41,200 --> 01:48:45,920
No, I was confused. I felt...

1311
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,160
I've never felt that way before.

1312
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:52,000
I couldn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1313
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:56,760
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

1314
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,600
What is it you can't face?

1315
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:02,960
I can't face him again.

1316
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:06,080
Him?

1317
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,600
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1318
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:20,400
Captain von Trapp?

1319
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:26,760
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know!

1320
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:28,680
I don't know. I...

1321
01:49:28,920 --> 01:49:32,600
The baroness said I was.
She said that he was in love with me.

1322
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:36,200
But I didn't want to believe it.

1323
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,600
There were times we looked
at each other.

1324
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,400
I could hardly breathe.

1325
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:43,600
- Did you let him see your feelings?
- I don't know.

1326
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,360
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

1327
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:52,800
To have asked for his love would have
been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1328
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,760
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1329
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:01,440
- Please help me.
- Maria.

1330
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:05,960
The love of a man and a woman is holy.
You have a great capacity to love.

1331
01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:09,000
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your love.

1332
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:12,920
But I pledged my life to God.
I pledged my life to his service.

1333
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:18,840
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

1334
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:20,720
No.

1335
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,200
You must find out.

1336
01:50:24,440 --> 01:50:26,840
You must go back.

1337
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:28,920
You can't ask me to do that.

1338
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,520
- Please let me stay. I beg...
- Maria.

1339
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:35,520
These walls were not built
to shut out problems.

1340
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:37,600
You have to face them.

1341
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:42,440
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

1342
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:50,720
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

1343
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,560
<i>Search high and low</i>

1344
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,360

01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:03,880

01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:08,400
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:12,800
<i>Ford every stream</i>

1348
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:17,240
<i>Follow every rainbow</i>

01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:21,600
<i>Till you find your dream</i>

1350
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,800
<i>A dream that will need</i>

01:51:25,040 --> 01:51:30,160

1358
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:06,200
<i>A dream that will need</i>

1359
01:52:06,440 --> 01:52:11,800
<i>All the love you can give</i>

1360
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:15,360

01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:21,800

01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:26,280

01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:30,680

1366
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:50,920
<i>... your dream</i>

1367
01:52:51,960 --> 01:52:55,320
Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

1368
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:59,000
We're not being secretive, Father.

1369
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:02,400
And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.

1370
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:06,480
- We lost track of the time.
- I see.

1371
01:53:06,720 --> 01:53:10,000
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1372
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:13,280
Brigitta. Liesl.

1373
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:16,400
Where do you think we were, Father?

1374
01:53:16,640 --> 01:53:19,200
No?

1375
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:27,240
If you don't believe us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

1376
01:53:29,240 --> 01:53:30,920
- Marta.
- Yes, Father.

1377
01:53:31,160 --> 01:53:33,360
You tell me.

1378
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,680
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1379
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,360
- I forgot! You were berry picking.
- Yes, we love berry picking.

1380
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:43,680
All afternoon?

1381
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,520
- We picked thousands.
- Thousands?

1382
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,560
- They were all over the place.
- What kind of berries?

1383
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:53,400
- Blueberries, sir.
- Blueberries.

1384
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:58,200
It's too early for blueberries.

1385
01:53:58,440 --> 01:54:00,920
- They were strawberries.
- Strawberries?

1386
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:05,200
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

1387
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:09,080
Aw.

1388
01:54:09,320 --> 01:54:12,360
Very well. Show me the berries.

1389
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:13,800
- We...
- Well...

1390
01:54:14,040 --> 01:54:16,680
- Show me the berries you picked.
- We don't have them.

1391
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:19,080
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

1392
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:21,960
- We...
- We ate them.

1393
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,640
- You ate them?
- Yes!

1394
01:54:24,880 --> 01:54:26,360
- They were so good.
- Delicious.

1395
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,800
Very well.

1396
01:54:28,040 --> 01:54:32,960
Since you've obviously stuffed
yourselves on thousands of berries...

1397
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:36,960
...you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1398
01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:41,400
...to skip your dinner.

1399
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:51,400
It's your fault.
We should have told him the truth.

1400
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:53,520
And made him boiling mad at us?

1401
01:54:53,760 --> 01:54:55,600
It's better than starving to death.

1402
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:59,600
We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1403
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:03,000
My stomach's making noises.

1404
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:06,800
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

1405
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:10,960
- I wonder what grass tastes like.
- I feel awful.

1406
01:55:11,200 --> 01:55:15,640
When Frylein Maria wanted to feel
better she used to sing that song.

1407
01:55:15,880 --> 01:55:17,280
Let's try it.

1408
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,080
<i>Raindrops on roses</i>

1409
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:24,800
<i>And whiskers on kittens</i>

1410
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:27,480
<i>Bright copper kettles</i>

1411
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:31,720
<i>And warm woolen mittens</i>

1412
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:37,680
<i>Brown paper packages</i>
<i>Tied up with strings</i>

1413
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:43,680
<i>These are a few of my favorite things</i>

1414
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,760
Why don't I feel better?

1415
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,200
<i>Girls in white dresses</i>

1416
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,400
<i>With blue satin sashes</i>

1417
01:55:52,640 --> 01:55:58,200
<i>Snowflakes that stay</i>
<i>On my nose and eyelashes</i>

1418
01:55:58,440 --> 01:56:01,400
<i>- Silver white winters...</i>
Frylein Maria's back!

1419
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,080
<i>... that melt into springs</i>

1420
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:06,400
<i>These are a few of my favorite things</i>

1421
01:56:06,640 --> 01:56:09,600
<i>When the dog bites</i>
<i>When the bee stings</i>

1422
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:12,120
<i>When I'm feeling sad</i>

1423
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:15,200
<i>I simply remember my favorite things</i>

1424
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:17,600
<i>And then I don't feel</i>

1425
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:24,280
<i>So bad</i>

1426
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:27,400
- Children, I'm so glad to see you.
- We missed you.

1427
01:56:27,640 --> 01:56:28,680
I missed you.

1428
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:32,400
- Kurt, how are you?
- Hungry.

1429
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:34,960
- What happened to your finger?
- It got caught.

1430
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:38,200
- Caught in what?
- Friedrich's teeth.

1431
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:40,520
- Liesl, you all right?
- Just fair.

1432
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,600
- Any telegrams been delivered lately?
- None at all.

1433
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,160
But I'm learning to accept it.
I'll be glad when school begins.

1434
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:51,920
Liesl, you can't use school to escape
your problems. You have to face them.

1435
01:56:52,160 --> 01:56:53,560
I have so much to tell you.

1436
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,800
We have things to tell you too.

1437
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:59,560
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

1438
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:00,880
Married?

1439
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:04,520
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1440
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:13,600
Oh, I see.

1441
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,120
Father, look!
Frylein Maria's back!

1442
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:20,760
Frylein Maria's back from the abbey.

1443
01:57:21,440 --> 01:57:23,920
Good evening, captain.

1444
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:26,600
Good evening.

1445
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:29,360
Everyone inside for dinner.

1446
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:32,640
Dinner!

1447
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:45,320
You left without saying goodbye.
Even to the children.

1448
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:48,520
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1449
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,120
Why did you?

1450
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,960
Please don't ask me.
The reason no longer exists.

1451
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:58,080
Frylein Maria, you've returned.

1452
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:01,520
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1453
01:58:03,240 --> 01:58:05,320
I wish you every happiness,
baroness.

1454
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:08,200
You too, captain.
The children say you're to marry.

1455
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,920
Thank you, my dear.

1456
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:16,800
You are back to stay?

1457
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:22,040
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1458
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:17,000
There you are.

1459
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,720
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzel.

1460
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:35,280
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

1461
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,360
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner table.

1462
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,520
Or was it the wine?

1463
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:43,960
Undoubtedly the wine.

1464
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,160
You have no idea
the trouble I'm having...

1465
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:50,040
...trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

1466
01:59:50,280 --> 01:59:52,360
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1467
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,080
But I do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion.

1468
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:58,560
At first I thought
of a fountain pen...

1469
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,960
...but you've already got one.

1470
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:04,040
Then I thought perhaps a villa
in the south of France...

1471
02:00:04,280 --> 02:00:06,840
...but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

1472
02:00:07,080 --> 02:00:09,400
Oh, Georg, how do you
feel about yachts?

1473
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:11,840
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean...

1474
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:16,200
...or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

1475
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,760
- Elsa.
- Where to go on our honeymoon?

1476
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,480
Now, that's a real problem.

1477
02:00:20,720 --> 02:00:23,960
A trip around the world
would be lovely. And then I said:

1478
02:00:24,200 --> 02:00:26,960
"Oh, Elsa, there must be
someplace better to go".

1479
02:00:27,200 --> 02:00:29,960
- But don't worry, darling, I'll...
- Elsa.

1480
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:32,120
Yes, Georg.

1481
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:34,560
It's no use...

1482
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,600
...you and I.

1483
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:41,760
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1484
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,040
...and utterly unfair to you.

1485
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:51,880
- When two people talk of marriage...
- No, don't.

1486
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:55,560
Don't say another word, please.

1487
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:02,760
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1488
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:08,960
Fond as I am of you, I really don't
think you're the right man for me.

1489
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,360
You're much too independent.

1490
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:17,160
And I need someone
who needs me desperately...

1491
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:21,760
...or at least needs
my money desperately.

1492
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:28,560
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

1493
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,560
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1494
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:33,760
...I'll go inside,
pack my little bags...

1495
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,840
...and return to Vienna
where I belong.

1496
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:43,320
And somewhere out there...

1497
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:47,800
...is a young lady who, I think...

1498
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:50,680
...will never be a nun.

1499
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:04,560
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1500
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:30,360
Hello.

1501
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:39,360
I thought I just might find you here.

1502
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:44,240
Was there something you wanted?

1503
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:48,160
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1504
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:51,200
Please.

1505
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:57,400
May I?

1506
02:03:07,800 --> 02:03:13,160
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things:

1507
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:18,040
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1508
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:24,240
And what was it
that made you come back?

1509
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:28,640
Well, I had an obligation
to fulfill...

1510
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,280
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1511
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:33,960
Is that all?

1512
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,320
And I missed the children.

1513
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:38,680
Yes.

1514
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:41,680
- Only the children?
- No. Yes.

1515
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:45,560
- Isn't it right that I missed them?
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1516
02:03:45,800 --> 02:03:49,160
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1517
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:52,520
Perhaps you might...

1518
02:03:52,760 --> 02:03:55,360
Yes?

1519
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:01,160
Well, nothing was the same
when you were away...

1520
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:04,520
...and it'll be all wrong again
after you leave...

1521
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:10,680
...and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

1522
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:17,160
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be
able to make things fine for you.

1523
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:20,200
Maria...

1524
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:25,560
- There isn't going to be any baroness.
- There isn't?

1525
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,760
No.

1526
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,200
I don't understand.

1527
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,960
Well, we've called off our engagement,
you see, and...

1528
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:40,360
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yes. You are?

1529
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:43,520
- You did?
- Yes.

1530
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:49,560
Well, you can't marry someone
when you're...

1531
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:53,960
...in love with someone else...

1532
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:58,600
...can you?

1533
02:05:30,600 --> 02:05:32,800
The Reverend Mother always says:

1534
02:05:33,040 --> 02:05:37,760
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere He opens a window".

1535
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:47,960
What else does
the Reverend Mother say?

1536
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:51,960
That you have to look for your life.

1537
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:55,960
Is that why you came back?

1538
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,560
And have you found it...

1539
02:06:00,800 --> 02:06:03,360
...Maria?

1540
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:06,960
I think I have.

1541
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:10,960
I know I have.

1542
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:14,960
I love you.

1543
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:21,160
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1544
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:28,960
<i>Perhaps I had a wicked childhood</i>

1545
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:35,440
<i>Perhaps I had a miserable youth</i>

1546
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:41,720
<i>But somewhere</i>
<i>In my wicked, miserable past</i>

1547
02:06:41,960 --> 02:06:48,160
<i>There must have been a moment of truth</i>

1548
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:55,360
<i>For here you are</i>
<i>Standing there loving me</i>

1549
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:01,760
<i>Whether or not you should</i>

1550
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,080
<i>So somewhere in my youth or childhood</i>

1551
02:07:09,320 --> 02:07:17,640
<i>I must have done something good</i>

1552
02:07:17,880 --> 02:07:21,560
<i>Nothing comes from nothing</i>

1553
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:26,080
<i>Nothing ever could</i>

1554
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:36,280
<i>So somewhere in my youth or childhood</i>

1555
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:46,040
<i>I must have done something good</i>

1556
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:51,080
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

1557
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:55,040
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridiculous pine cone.

1558
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:57,560
What?

1559
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:01,760
I knew the first time you blew
that silly whistle.

1560
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:05,360
Oh, my love.

1561
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:16,560
<i>For here you are</i>
<i>Standing there loving me</i>

1562
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:23,680
<i>Whether or not you should</i>

1563
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:31,160
<i>So somewhere in my youth or childhood</i>

1564
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:39,720
<i>I must have done something good</i>

1565
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:43,760
<i>Nothing comes from nothing</i>

1566
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,920
<i>Nothing ever could</i>

1567
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:52,720
<i>So somewhere in my youth...</i>

1568
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:56,560
<i>... or childhood</i>

1569
02:08:58,080 --> 02:09:05,800
<i>I must have done something</i>

1570
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:19,880
<i>Something good</i>

1571
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:27,760
Maria.

1572
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:33,960
Is there anyone I should go to,
to ask permission to marry you?

1573
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:39,600
- Why don't we ask...
- The children?

1574
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:27,160
<i>How do you solve a problem like Maria?</i>

1575
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:31,680
<i>How do you catch a cloud</i>
<i>And pin it down?</i>

1576
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:36,040
<i>How do you find a word</i>
<i>That means Maria?</i>

1577
02:11:36,280 --> 02:11:37,240
<i>A flibbertigibbet</i>

1578
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:40,600
<i>A will-o'-the-wisp</i>
<i>A clown</i>

1579
02:11:40,840 --> 02:11:45,360
<i>Many a thing you know</i>
<i>You'd like to tell her</i>

1580
02:11:45,600 --> 02:11:49,960
<i>Many a thing she ought to understand</i>

1581
02:11:50,200 --> 02:11:54,480
<i>But how do you make her stay</i>
<i>And listen to all you say?</i>

1582
02:11:54,720 --> 02:11:58,520
<i>How do you keep a wave upon the sand?</i>

1583
02:11:58,760 --> 02:12:03,680
<i>Oh, how do you solve</i>
<i>A problem like Maria?</i>

1584
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:11,720
<i>How do you hold a moonbeam</i>
<i>In your hand?</i>

1585
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:14,160
Herr Detweiler!

1586
02:14:15,200 --> 02:14:17,760
- Heil Hitler.
- Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1587
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,160
Perhaps you've not heard.
I am now the Gauleiter.

1588
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,560
Heil Hitler.

1589
02:14:23,800 --> 02:14:24,920
Heil Hitler.

1590
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:27,560
I've come from
Captain von Trapp's house.

1591
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:31,240
The only one in the area
not flying the Third Reich flag...

1592
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:32,640
...since the Anschluss.

1593
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,960
- But we have dealt with that.
- I don't...

1594
02:14:35,200 --> 02:14:38,040
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

1595
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:40,160
The only thing she'd tell me.

1596
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:42,840
What kind of information
are you looking for?

1597
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:45,160
When will the captain return?

1598
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:49,160
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
He's not been in touch with us.

1599
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:54,040
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated
with his children in over a month?

1600
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:56,120
How many men do you know...

1601
02:14:56,360 --> 02:15:00,120
...who communicate with their children
while honeymooning?

1602
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:03,960
Upon his return, he'll fill
his proper position in the new order.

1603
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:06,520
Naturally.
And may I congratulate you...

1604
02:15:06,760 --> 02:15:11,480
...and your people in allowing the
festival to go on tonight as planned.

1605
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:15,040
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

1606
02:15:15,280 --> 02:15:18,480
Singing and music will
show this to the world.

1607
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:20,960
Austria is the same.

1608
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:24,000
Heil Hitler.

1609
02:15:24,600 --> 02:15:27,560
Heil Hitler.

1610
02:15:27,720 --> 02:15:28,880
Come, let's go home.

1611
02:15:29,120 --> 02:15:32,440
- Why was he so cross?
- Everybody's cross these days.

1612
02:15:32,680 --> 02:15:35,880
Maybe the flag with the black spider
makes people nervous.

1613
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:38,920
- Will Father be in trouble?
- He doesn't have to be.

1614
02:15:39,160 --> 02:15:41,760
The thing to do
is to get along with everybody.

1615
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,080
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1616
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:47,080
Are we really going to sing
before a lot of people?

1617
02:15:47,320 --> 02:15:49,280
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

1618
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:53,880
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1619
02:15:54,120 --> 02:15:58,760
- Why am I always last?
- Because you are the most important.

1620
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,960
There we go.

1621
02:16:06,200 --> 02:16:09,480
Are you sure Father will approve
of our singing in public?

1622
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:12,120
He'll be pleased and proud.

1623
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:14,680
- Liesl, do you think so?
- Don't you trust me?

1624
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:15,880
No.

1625
02:16:16,120 --> 02:16:18,360
You're a very intelligent girl.

1626
02:16:18,600 --> 02:16:21,360
Liesl. Liesl!

1627
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:23,480
Rolf!

1628
02:16:23,720 --> 02:16:25,640
I'm so glad to see you.
It's been su...

1629
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:27,080
Good afternoon.

1630
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:30,520
Give this to your father
as soon as he's home.

1631
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:32,520
- He's on his honeymoon.
- I know.

1632
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:36,360
- You do?
- We make it our business to know all.

1633
02:16:36,600 --> 02:16:39,080
- Who's "we"?
- See that he gets it.

1634
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:42,120
- What is it?
- It's a telegram from Berlin.

1635
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:44,960
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1636
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:47,680
I'm occupied
with more important matters.

1637
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:50,280
And your father had better be too.

1638
02:16:50,520 --> 02:16:53,480
But, Rolf!

1639
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:10,760
Father! Father!

1640
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:15,760
Father!

1641
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,560
- We didn't expect you so soon.
- Hello, hello!

1642
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:21,440
We didn't expect you home
until next week!

1643
02:17:21,680 --> 02:17:27,720
- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?
- Hello! How are you?

1644
02:17:27,960 --> 02:17:29,160
Why didn't you call us?

1645
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,240
We couldn't get through.

1646
02:17:31,480 --> 02:17:33,360
I had nothing to do with that.

1647
02:17:33,600 --> 02:17:35,640
We came back as fast as we could.

1648
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,960
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1649
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,480
- We missed you!
- We missed kissing you.

1650
02:17:40,720 --> 02:17:43,440
We missed all the noise
in the morning.

1651
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:47,680
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
- Oh, you came back just in time.

1652
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:49,560
Look, Frylein Maria...

1653
02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:51,520
I mean Mother.

1654
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:54,120
We're going to sing
in the festival tonight.

1655
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:56,360
We've been having a lovely time!

1656
02:17:56,600 --> 02:18:00,040
We've been rehearsing all...

1657
02:18:00,080 --> 02:18:02,720
Surprise! Surprise!

1658
02:18:02,960 --> 02:18:06,760
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1659
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:09,560
We'll talk about this.

1660
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:13,960
I would've told you but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

1661
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:16,560
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1662
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:21,280
They'll be the talk of the festival.
Imagine, seven children in one family!

1663
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:23,440
Max!

1664
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:26,400
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you...

1665
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:29,240
...how I feel about my family
singing in public!

1666
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:31,080
The committee was enchanted.

1667
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:34,360
- What did they say?
- I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1668
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:38,720
- Don't you think just this once...?
- Absolutely out of the question.

1669
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:43,040
- Georg, this is for Austria.
- For Austria?

1670
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:46,360
- There is no Austria!
- But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1671
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:51,400
- Let's at least be grateful for that.
- Grateful?

1672
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:53,960
You know, Max...

1673
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:58,720
...sometimes I don't believe
I know you.

1674
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:01,760
Father, I forgot.

1675
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,960
This is for you.

1676
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:16,760
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

1677
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:18,440
You must convince him.

1678
02:19:18,680 --> 02:19:21,280
Max, I can't ask him
to be less than he is.

1679
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:24,720
Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing, well...

1680
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:27,640
...it will be a reflection
on Austria.

1681
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:32,560
Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

1682
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:38,640
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1683
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:41,480
- I like calling you "Mother".
- I like hearing it.

1684
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:45,160
You love Father very much.
I can tell you do.

1685
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:46,240
Very much.

1686
02:19:46,480 --> 02:19:50,080
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone?

1687
02:19:50,320 --> 02:19:56,840
I mean, when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you?

1688
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:00,080
Well, you cry a little.

1689
02:20:00,320 --> 02:20:02,360
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1690
02:20:02,600 --> 02:20:03,920
It always does.

1691
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,560
There are so many things I think
I should know but I don't.

1692
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,680
- I really don't.
- How can you?

1693
02:20:09,920 --> 02:20:12,040
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1694
02:20:12,280 --> 02:20:15,280
- Then you feel it's just beginning?
- Yes!

1695
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:20,040
It was that way with me. And for you
it will be just as wonderful.

1696
02:20:20,280 --> 02:20:22,720
Do you really think so?

1697
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:26,760
<i>When you're 16 going on 17</i>

1698
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:30,840
<i>Waiting for life to start</i>

1699
02:20:31,080 --> 02:20:34,760
<i>Somebody kind</i>
<i>Who touches your mind</i>

1700
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:39,280
<i>Will suddenly touch your heart</i>

1701
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:41,320
<i>When that happens</i>

1702
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:43,440
<i>After it happens</i>

1703
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:47,360
<i>Nothing is quite the same</i>

1704
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:49,120
<i>Somehow I know</i>

1705
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:51,440
<i>I'll jump up and go</i>

1706
02:20:51,680 --> 02:20:55,760
<i>If ever he calls my name</i>

1707
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,760
<i>Gone are your old ideas of life</i>

1708
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:04,040
<i>The old ideas grow dim</i>

1709
02:21:04,280 --> 02:21:09,160
<i>Lo and behold</i>
<i>You're someone's wife</i>

1710
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:15,160
<i>And you belong to him</i>

1711
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:19,520
<i>You may think this kind of adventure</i>

1712
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:24,240
<i>Never may come to you</i>

1713
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:30,240
<i>Darling, 16 going on 17</i>

1714
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:34,960
<i>Wait a year...</i>

1715
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:40,360
<i>- I'll wait a year</i>
<i>...or two</i>

1716
02:21:40,600 --> 02:21:48,280
<i>Just wait a year...</i>

1717
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:58,240
<i>... or two</i>

1718
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:02,080
Liesl.

1719
02:22:16,400 --> 02:22:18,360
What is it?

1720
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:20,120
Berlin.

1721
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:22,160
They've offered me a commission.

1722
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:24,840
I've been requested
to accept immediately...

1723
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:29,240
...and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1724
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:33,280
I knew this would happen.
I didn't think it would be so soon.

1725
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:37,840
To refuse them would be fatal
for all of us.

1726
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:43,160
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1727
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,360
Get the children all together.

1728
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:53,360
Don't say anything to worry them.
Just get them ready.

1729
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:57,360
We've got to get out of Austria...

1730
02:22:57,480 --> 02:23:00,600
...and this house...

1731
02:23:01,360 --> 02:23:04,160
...tonight.

1732
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:47,160
This strains my back
and breaks my heart...

1733
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:50,120
...when I think of the children
missing the festival.

1734
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:52,960
By your announcement
we'll be over the border.

1735
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,480
Do you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making?

1736
02:23:55,720 --> 02:23:56,960
You have no choice.

1737
02:23:57,200 --> 02:24:00,320
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1738
02:24:00,560 --> 02:24:02,600
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1739
02:24:02,840 --> 02:24:07,560
Because he doesn't want anyone
to hear us.

1740
02:24:09,560 --> 02:24:11,960
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1741
02:24:12,200 --> 02:24:15,560
They'll be able to answer honestly
they didn't know anything.

1742
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:19,840
- Will we be coming back here?
- Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1743
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:26,240
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push
the car all the way to Switzerland?

1744
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:52,880
Something wrong
with your car, captain?

1745
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:56,760
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1746
02:24:58,920 --> 02:25:01,560
Karl.

1747
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:06,760
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

1748
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:30,760
Excellent, Karl.

1749
02:25:32,560 --> 02:25:35,840
I've not asked you where you
and your family are going.

1750
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:38,080
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1751
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:42,520
Apparently we both suffer
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1752
02:25:42,760 --> 02:25:45,120
You never answered the telegram...

1753
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:48,520
...from the Admiral of the Navy
of the Third Reich.

1754
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:51,080
I was under the impression,
Herr Zeller...

1755
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:55,160
...that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

1756
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:59,640
At least, the Austria I know.

1757
02:25:59,880 --> 02:26:01,440
I have my orders...

1758
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:03,760
...to take you
to Bremerhaven tonight...

1759
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,960
...where you will accept
your commission.

1760
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:12,760
I'm afraid that's going to be
quite impossible.

1761
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,960
You see, we...

1762
02:26:15,200 --> 02:26:18,720
...all of us, the entire family,
will be...

1763
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:20,960
...singing in the festival tonight.

1764
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:23,920
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1765
02:26:24,160 --> 02:26:26,880
We couldn't possibly
let them down now.

1766
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:29,960
- I just hope we're not too late.
- Yes.

1767
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:32,960
You ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp...

1768
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:34,760
...are singing in a concert?

1769
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:39,040
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1770
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:44,160
Like you, Herr Zeller,
I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1771
02:26:44,400 --> 02:26:45,720
Yes.

1772
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:49,760
Here, program.

1773
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:55,360
It says only the names
of the children.

1774
02:26:55,600 --> 02:26:58,760
It says
the von Trapp Family Singers...

1775
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:03,360
...and I am the head of
the von Trapp family, am I not?

1776
02:27:04,120 --> 02:27:08,320
And these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

1777
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:10,040
Our costumes, naturally.

1778
02:27:10,280 --> 02:27:14,960
This night air is not good
for the children's voices.

1779
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:23,840
Well, a slight delay in my orders
will not be serious.

1780
02:27:24,080 --> 02:27:26,120
Therefore...

1781
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:28,560
...you will sing.

1782
02:27:28,800 --> 02:27:30,840
You will all sing.

1783
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:34,120
But only because that's what I want.

1784
02:27:34,360 --> 02:27:38,160
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

1785
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:40,560
And when you have finished singing...

1786
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:44,840
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be
taken to Bremerhaven.

1787
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:47,680
Now, if you will all get
into your car...

1788
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:52,160
...we will escort the von Trapp Family
Singers to the festival.

1789
02:27:52,400 --> 02:27:54,520
No escort will be necessary.

1790
02:27:54,760 --> 02:27:57,760
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1791
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,640
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

1792
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:04,720
Would we?

1793
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:07,520
No.

1794
02:28:21,560 --> 02:28:24,640
<i>Sew, a needle pulling thread</i>

1795
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:27,960
<i>La, a note to follow sew</i>

1796
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:31,480
<i>Tea, a drink with jam and bread</i>

1797
02:28:31,720 --> 02:28:35,360
<i>A drink with jam and bread</i>

1798
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,240
<i>Tea with jam, jam and bread</i>

1799
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:40,240
<i>Tea with jam and bread</i>

1800
02:28:40,480 --> 02:28:44,320
<i>Jam and bread</i>
<i>Tea with jam, jam and bread</i>

1801
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:48,040
<i>Tea with jam</i>
<i>Jam and bread</i>

1802
02:28:52,280 --> 02:28:55,440
<i>With jam</i>
<i>A, B, C</i>

1803
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,760
<i>With jam</i>
<i>Do-re-mi</i>

1804
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:02,440
<i>Tea with jam and bread</i>

1805
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:03,960
<i>With jam and bread</i>

1806
02:29:04,200 --> 02:29:05,640
<i>With jam</i>
<i>With jam...</i>

1807
02:29:05,880 --> 02:29:14,360
<i>... and bread</i>

1808
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:39,440
My fellow Austrians...

1809
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:45,120
...I shall not be seeing you again,
perhaps for a very long time.

1810
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:48,240
I would like to sing for you now...

1811
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:51,440
...a love song.

1812
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:55,000
I know you share this love.

1813
02:29:55,240 --> 02:30:00,240
I pray that you will never let it die.

1814
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:14,360
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1815
02:30:14,600 --> 02:30:17,720
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1816
02:30:17,960 --> 02:30:23,600
<i>Every morning you greet me</i>

1817
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:26,800
<i>Small and white</i>

1818
02:30:27,040 --> 02:30:30,000
<i>Clean and bright</i>

1819
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:35,640
<i>You look happy to meet me</i>

1820
02:30:35,880 --> 02:30:37,840
<i>Blossom of snow</i>

1821
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:41,520
<i>May you bloom and grow</i>

1822
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:48,360
<i>Bloom and grow forever</i>

1823
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:51,040
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1824
02:30:51,280 --> 02:30:53,760
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1825
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:01,240
<i>Bless my homeland forever</i>

1826
02:31:04,080 --> 02:31:07,040
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1827
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:10,000
<i>Edel...</i>

1828
02:31:15,640 --> 02:31:18,560
<i>Small and white</i>

1829
02:31:18,800 --> 02:31:21,520
<i>Clean and bright</i>

1830
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:27,440
<i>You look happy to meet me</i>

1831
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:29,520
<i>Blossom of snow</i>

1832
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:33,440
<i>May you bloom and grow</i>

1833
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:39,640
<i>Bloom and grow forever</i>

1834
02:31:39,880 --> 02:31:42,720
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1835
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:45,960
<i>Edelweiss</i>

1836
02:31:46,200 --> 02:31:55,520
<i>Bless my homeland forever</i>

1837
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:13,040
I think it'll work.

1838
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,200
I shall miss all of you.

1839
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:19,240
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

1840
02:32:21,080 --> 02:32:23,040
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1841
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:25,840
The competition has come
to its conclusion...

1842
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:29,760
...except, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

1843
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,440
And while the judges
arrive at their decision...

1844
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:35,600
...I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

1845
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:38,920
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have...

1846
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:42,240
...of singing together
for a long, long time.

1847
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:46,320
Even now, officials are waiting
in this auditorium...

1848
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:49,120
...to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command...

1849
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:52,760
...in the naval forces
of the Third Reich.

1850
02:32:57,280 --> 02:33:02,000
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again...

1851
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:05,880
...to bid you farewell.

1852
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:14,840
<i>There's a sad sort of clanging</i>
<i>From the clock in the hall</i>

1853
02:33:15,080 --> 02:33:18,520
<i>And the bells in the steeple too</i>

1854
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:22,440
<i>And up in the nursery</i>
<i>An absurd little bird</i>

1855
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:24,960
<i>Is popping out to say "coo-coo"</i>

1856
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:26,800
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1857
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:28,000
<i>Coo-coo</i>

1858
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:29,760
<i>Regretfully they tell us</i>

1859
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:31,720
<i>But firmly they compel us</i>

1860
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:34,560
<i>To say goodbye</i>

1861
02:33:34,800 --> 02:33:41,200
<i>To you</i>

1862
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:46,000
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, good night</i>

1863
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:51,280
<i>We hate to go</i>
<i>And miss this pretty sight</i>

1864
02:33:55,760 --> 02:33:59,160
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, adieu</i>

1865
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:04,360
<i>Adieu, adieu</i>
<i>To you and you and you</i>

1866
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:12,360
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1867
02:34:12,600 --> 02:34:14,160
<i>We flit, we float</i>

1868
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:17,520
<i>We fleetly flee, we fly</i>

1869
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:25,760
<i>So long, farewell</i>
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye</i>

1870
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:29,240
<i>The sun has gone to bed</i>
<i>And so must I</i>

1871
02:34:29,480 --> 02:34:33,120
<i>Goodbye</i>

1872
02:34:33,360 --> 02:34:38,800
<i>Goodbye</i>

1873
02:34:39,040 --> 02:34:44,040
<i>Goodbye</i>

1874
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:52,600
<i>Goodbye</i>

1875
02:35:21,600 --> 02:35:25,560
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
decision of our distinguished judges.

1876
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:28,640
We will start with the award
for third prize.

1877
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:31,120
For this honor,
the judges have named...

1878
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:35,800
...the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

1879
02:35:36,040 --> 02:35:39,640
Frylein Schweiger.

1880
02:36:13,560 --> 02:36:18,800
Second prize
to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

1881
02:36:44,200 --> 02:36:48,200
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria...

1882
02:36:48,440 --> 02:36:52,880
...the von Trapp Family Singers.

1883
02:37:03,240 --> 02:37:06,360
The family von Trapp.

1884
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:21,360
They're gone!

1885
02:37:37,840 --> 02:37:39,160
Come with me.

1886
02:37:42,880 --> 02:37:45,440
Quickly, quickly.

1887
02:37:45,680 --> 02:37:48,240
I have a place you can hide.

1888
02:37:48,480 --> 02:37:53,080
Slowly, slowly.

1889
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:04,640
Open this gate.

1890
02:38:04,880 --> 02:38:07,840
Good evening.

1891
02:38:08,800 --> 02:38:11,680
Hurry up, woman.

1892
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:30,360
Two men in there.

1893
02:38:30,600 --> 02:38:32,360
Six of you cover the yard.

1894
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:36,240
You two, cover the corridor.

1895
02:38:48,680 --> 02:38:52,120
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize
we put the abbey in this danger.

1896
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:54,760
No, Maria, it was right for you
to come here.

1897
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:56,760
We thought we might borrow
your car.

1898
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,160
I'm afraid our car will do you
no good now.

1899
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:00,960
I've been listening to the wires.

1900
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:05,040
The borders have just been closed.

1901
02:39:09,240 --> 02:39:12,400
All right,
if the borders are closed...

1902
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:16,160
...then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over the mountains on foot.

1903
02:39:16,400 --> 02:39:18,320
- The children...
- We'll help them.

1904
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:21,440
We can do it without help, Father.

1905
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,400
Maria.

1906
02:39:23,640 --> 02:39:26,160
You will not be alone.
Remember:

1907
02:39:26,400 --> 02:39:30,080
"I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help".

1908
02:39:30,320 --> 02:39:32,440
Yes, Mother.

1909
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:36,200
- I'm scared.
- Me too.

1910
02:39:46,360 --> 02:39:48,920
God be with you.

1911
02:39:54,120 --> 02:39:55,600
- Mother.
- Yes?

1912
02:39:55,840 --> 02:39:58,920
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

1913
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:02,040
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

1914
02:40:02,280 --> 02:40:06,800
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

1915
02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:17,080
Let's try the roof.

1916
02:43:09,600 --> 02:43:13,240
Rolf, please.

1917
02:43:16,640 --> 02:43:19,600
No, wait.

1918
02:43:27,480 --> 02:43:29,600
Maria.

1919
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:32,640
Children.

1920
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:38,120
It's you we want, not them.

1921
02:43:38,360 --> 02:43:40,800
Put that down.

1922
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:45,640
Not another move,
or I'll shoot.

1923
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:49,240
You're only a boy.

1924
02:43:50,680 --> 02:43:55,640
- You don't really belong to them.
- Stay where you are.

1925
02:43:55,880 --> 02:43:58,760
Come away with us.

1926
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,440
Before it's too late.

1927
02:44:00,680 --> 02:44:04,360
Not another step.
I'll kill you.

1928
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:09,040
- You give that to me, Rolf.
- Did you hear me?

1929
02:44:09,280 --> 02:44:12,240
I'll kill you.

1930
02:44:12,600 --> 02:44:15,480
Rolf.

1931
02:44:31,600 --> 02:44:34,400
You'll never be one of them.

1932
02:44:35,560 --> 02:44:37,200
Lieutenant!

1933
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:38,480
They're here!

1934
02:44:38,720 --> 02:44:40,160
They're here, lieutenant!

1935
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:22,440
Reverend Mother.

1936
02:45:22,680 --> 02:45:25,320
I have sinned.

1937
02:45:25,560 --> 02:45:29,040
I too, Reverend Mother.

1938
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:32,840
What is this sin, my children?

1939
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:48,000
