1
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,080
The hills are alive

2
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,560
With the sound of music

3
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,160
With songs they have sung

4
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,080
For a thousand years

5
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,360
The hills fill my heart

6
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,960
With the sound of music

7
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,080
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

8
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,200
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

9
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,400
From the lake to the trees

10
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,760
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

11
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,800
From a church on a breeze

12
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

13
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,000
Over stones on its way

14
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,960
To sing through the night

15
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,840
Like a lark who is learning to pray

16
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,520
I go to the hills

17
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,680
When my heart is lonely

18
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,640
I know I will hear

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,160
What I've heard before

20
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,960
My heart will be blessed

21
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:10,680
With the sound of music

22
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,560
And I'll sing...

23
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:25,400
...once more

24
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,680
Hallelujah, hallelujah

25
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,360
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,560
-Reverend Mother.
-Sister Bernice.

27
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,280
-I simply cannot find her.
-Maria?

28
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,600
She's missing again.

29
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
We should've put a cowbell
around her neck.

30
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,920
Have you tried the barn? You know
how much she adores the animals.

31
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,800
I have looked everywhere.
In all of the usual places.

32
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,160
Sister, considering it's Maria. . .

33
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,920
. . .I suggest you look in someplace
unusual.

34
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,200
Well, Reverend Mother. . .

35
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,960
. . .I hope this new infraction ends
whatever doubts. . .

36
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,320
. . .you may still have
about Maria's future here.

37
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,400
I always try to keep faith
in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

38
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,400
After all, the wool of a black sheep
is just as warm.

39
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,760
We are not talking about sheep,
black or white, Sister Margaretta.

40
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,280
Of all the candidates for
the novitiate, Maria is the least--

41
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,960
Children, children.

42
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,200
We were speculating about
the qualifications of our postulants.

43
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,680
The Mistress of Novices
and the Mistress of Postulants. . .

44
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,000
. . .were trying to help me
by expressing opposite points of view.

45
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,160
Tell me, Sister Catherine,
what do you think of Maria?

46
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,320
She's a wonderful girl,
some of the time.

47
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,200
-Sister Agatha?
-It's very easy to like Maria. . .

48
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,880
. . .except when it's difficult.

49
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,560
-And you, Sister Sophia?
-Oh, I love her very dearly.

50
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,560
But she always seems to be
in trouble, doesn't she?

51
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,480
Exactly what I say.

52
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,160
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

53
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,000
Her dress has got a tear

54
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,600
She waltzes on her way to Mass
And whistles on the stair

55
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,520
And underneath her wimple
She has curlers in her hair

56
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,240
I've even heard her singing
ln the abbey

57
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,360
She's always late for chapel

58
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,760
But her penitence is real

59
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,280
She's always late for everything

60
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,440
Except for every meal

61
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,320
I hate to have to say it
But I very firmly feel

62
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,800
Maria 's not an asset to the abbey

63
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,680
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

64
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

65
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,840
Maria makes me laugh

66
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,360
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

67
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,280
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

68
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,760
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

69
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
A flibbertigibbet

70
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,840
-A will-o '-the-wisp
-A clown

71
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,000
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

72
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,520
Many a thing she ought to understand

73
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,520
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

74
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,400
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

75
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,520
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

76
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,360
How do you hold a moonbeam...

77
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,800
...in your hand?

78
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,200
When I'm with her I'm confused
Out of focus and bemused

79
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,760
And I never know exactly where I am

80
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,160
-Unpredictable as weather
-She's as flighty as a feather

81
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
-She's a darling
-She's a demon

82
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,760
She's a lamb

83
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,600
She'll out pester any pest
Drive a hornet from its nest

84
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,000
She can throw a whirling dervish
Out of whirl

85
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,960
-She is gentle, she is wild
-She's a riddle, she's a child

86
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,960
-She's a headache
-She's an angel

87
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,880
She's a girl

88
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,360
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

89
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

90
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,800
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

91
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,960
-A flibbertigibbet
-A will-o '-the-wisp

92
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,760
A clown

93
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,800
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

94
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,360
Many a thing she ought to understand

95
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,760
-But how do you make her stay
-And listen to all you say?

96
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,920
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

97
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,720
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

98
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,520
How do you hold a moonbeam...

99
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,520
...in your hand?

100
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,760
You may go in now, Maria.

101
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,400
Come here, my child.

102
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,960
Now sit down.

103
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,280
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.
I couldn't help myself.

104
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,320
-The hills were beckoning and before--
-Dear.

105
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,640
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

106
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,000
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

107
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,840
If you'll feel better.

108
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes, you see,
the sky was so blue today. . .

109
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,880
. . .and everything was so green and
fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

110
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,400
The Untersberg led me higher like
it wanted me to go through the clouds.

111
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,640
Suppose darkness had come
and you were lost?

112
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,000
Mother, I could never be lost
up there.

113
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,960
That's my mountain.
I was brought up on it.

114
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,360
It was the mountain that led me
to you.

115
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,960
When I was a child,
I would come down and climb a tree. . .

116
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,920
. . .and look in your garden.

117
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,960
I'd see the sisters at work
and hear them sing.

118
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,720
Which brings me to another
transgression, Reverend Mother.

119
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,000
I was singing out there today.

120
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,480
Only in the abbey do we have rules
about postulants singing.

121
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,600
I can't stop wherever I am.

122
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,080
Worse, I can't seem to stop
saying things.

123
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,480
Everything I think and feel.

124
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,120
Some call that "honesty. "

125
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,600
Oh, but it's terrible,
Reverend Mother!

126
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,560
You know how Sister Berthe makes me
kiss the floor after a disagreement?

127
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,280
Lately, I kiss the floor
when I see her coming to save time.

128
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,960
Maria. . .

129
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,800
. . .when you saw us over the wall
and longed to be with us. . .

130
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,560
. . .that didn't mean you were prepared
for the way we live here, did it?

131
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,160
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

132
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,000
And I am learning. I really am.

133
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
What is the most important lesson
you have learned here?

134
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,080
To find out what is the will of God
and do it wholeheartedly.

135
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,880
Maria. . .

136
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,000
. . .it seems to be God's will
that you leave us.

137
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,680
-Leave?
-Only for a while.

138
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,400
No, Mother!
Please don't send me away!

139
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,720
This is where I belong. It's my home,
my family. It's my life.

140
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,240
-Are you truly ready for it?
-Yes, I am.

141
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,160
If you go out into the world for a
time, knowing what we expect of you. . .

142
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,040
. . .you will find out
if you can expect it of yourself.

143
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,360
I know what you expect, Mother,
and I can do it! I promise I can!

144
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,960
Yes, Mother.

145
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,560
If it is God's will.

146
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,600
There is a family near Salzburg that
needs a governess until September.

147
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,960
-September?
-For seven children.

148
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Seven children?!

149
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you like children?

150
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,480
Well, yes, but seven!

151
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,640
I will tell Captain von Trapp
to expect you tomorrow.

152
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
Captain?

153
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,800
A retired officer of the lmperial
Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

154
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,640
His wife died,
and he is alone with the children.

155
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,960
I understand he has had a difficult
time keeping a governess there.

156
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,920
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

157
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,040
The Lord will show you
in His own good time.

158
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,760
When the Lord closes a door. . .

159
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,360
. . .somewhere He opens a window.

160
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,400
What will this day be like?

161
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,760
I wonder

162
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,960
What will my future be?

163
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,920
I wonder

164
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,360
It could be so exciting

165
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,560
To be out in the world
To be free

166
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,720
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

167
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,960
Oh, what's the matter with me?

168
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,200
I've always longed for adventure

169
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,880
To do the things I've never dared

170
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,200
Now here I'm facing adventure

171
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,320
Then why am I so scared?

172
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,400
A captain with seven children

173
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,360
What's so fearsome about that?

174
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,280
I must stop these doubts and worries

175
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,280
If I don 't ljust know I'll turn back

176
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,560
I must dream of the things
I am seeking

177
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,360
I am seeking the courage I lack

178
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,960
The courage to serve them
With reliance

179
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Face my mistakes without defiance

180
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,880
Show them I'm worthy

181
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,680
And while I show them

182
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,560
I'll show me

183
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,960
So let them bring on
All their problems

184
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,280
I'll do better than my best

185
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,480
I have confidence
They'll put me to the test

186
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,040
But I'll make them see
I have confidence in me

187
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,400
Somehow I will impress them

188
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
I will be firm but kind

189
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,160
And all those children
Heaven bless them

190
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,560
They will look up to me
And mind me

191
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
With each step I am more certain

192
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,160
Everything will turn out fine

193
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,360
I have confidence
The world can all be mine

194
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,840
They'll have to agree
I have confidence in me

195
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,960
I have confidence in sunshine

196
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,160
I have confidence in rain

197
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,160
I have confidence
That spring will come again

198
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,360
Besides which you see
I have confidence in me

199
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Strength doesn 't lie in numbers

200
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,760
Strength doesn 't lie in wealth

201
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,160
Strength lies in nights
Ofpeaceful slumbers

202
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,200
When you wake up, wake up
It's healthy

203
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,360
All I trust I leave my heart to

204
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
All I trust becomes my own

205
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,160
I have confidence in confidence alone

206
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,760
Oh, help.

207
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,840
I have confidence in confidence alone

208
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,200
Besides which you see
I have confidence...

209
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,000
...in me

210
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,560
Hello. Here I am.

211
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,040
I'm from the convent.
I'm the new governess, captain.

212
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,760
And I'm the old butler, fräulein.

213
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,360
Well, how do you do?

214
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,360
You'll wait here, please.

215
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,120
In future, remember certain rooms
in this house are not to be disturbed.

216
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,640
Yes, captain, sir.

217
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,240
-Why do you stare at me that way?
-You don't look like a sea captain.

218
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,360
I'm afraid you don't look
very much like a governess.

219
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,080
-Turn around.
-What?

220
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,560
Turn.

221
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
Hat off.

222
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,360
Put on another dress
before meeting the children.

223
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,160
But I don't have another.

224
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,160
When we enter the abbey,
our worldly clothes go to the poor.

225
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,560
What about this one?

226
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,080
The poor didn't want it.

227
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,200
There wasn't time to make a new dress.
I can make clothes.

228
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,560
I'll see that you get some material.

229
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,760
Today, if possible.

230
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,400
-Now, fräulein. . . .
-Maria.

231
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
I don't know how much
the abbess told you.

232
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,960
You are the twelfth governess. . .

233
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,520
. . .to look after my children
since their mother died.

234
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,840
I trust you will be an improvement
on the last one.

235
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,840
She stayed only two hours.

236
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,960
What's wrong with the children, sir?

237
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,560
Nothing is wrong with the children,
only the governesses.

238
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,560
They could not maintain discipline,
without which the house cannot be run.

239
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,200
Drill them in their studies.

240
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,800
I will not permit them to dream
away their summer holidays.

241
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,600
Each afternoon,
they march, breathing deeply.

242
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,400
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

243
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,560
When do they play?

244
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,640
You will see to it that they conduct
themselves with the utmost decorum.

245
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,720
-I am placing you in command.
-Yes, sir.

246
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,160
Now. . .

247
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,560
. . .this is your new governess,
Fräulein Maria.

248
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,080
Give your name at your signal.

249
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,360
Fräulein, listen carefully. Learn
their signals so you can call them.

250
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,960
Liesl.

251
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,880
Friedrich.

252
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,600
Louisa.

253
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,080
Kurt.

254
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Brigitta.

255
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,760
Marta.

256
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,160
Gretl.

257
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,880
Now, let's see how well you listened.

258
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,400
I won't need to whistle for them,
Reverend Captain.

259
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,960
I mean, I'll use their names.
Such lovely names.

260
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,200
Fräulein, this is a large house.
The grounds are extensive.

261
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,080
And I will not have anyone shouting.

262
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,960
You will take this, please.
Learn to use it.

263
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,760
The children will help you.

264
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,560
Now, when I want you,
this is what you will hear.

265
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,120
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

266
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,400
I could never answer to a whistle.

267
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
Whistles are for animals,
not for children.

268
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,360
And definitely not for me.

269
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,160
It would be too humiliating.

270
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Fräulein, were you this much trouble
at the abbey?

271
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,280
Oh, much more, sir.

272
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,440
I don't know your signal.

273
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,360
You may call me "captain. "

274
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,160
At ease.

275
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
Now that there's just us. . .

276
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,560
. . .would you please tell me all your
names again and how old you are.

277
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,880
I'm Liesl. I'm 1 6 years old,
and I don't need a governess.

278
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,560
I'm glad you told me, Liesl.
We'll just be good friends.

279
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,280
I'm Friedrich. I'm 1 4.
I'm impossible.

280
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,160
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

281
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,760
Fräulein Josephine.
Four governesses ago.

282
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,560
I'm Brigitta.

283
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,160
You didn't tell me how old you are,
Louisa.

284
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

285
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,880
She's 1 3 years old, and you're smart.

286
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,720
I'm 1 0, and I think your dress
is the ugliest one I ever saw.

287
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,560
-Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.
-Why not?

288
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,960
-Don't you think it's ugly?
-Of course.

289
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,800
But Fräulein Helga's was ugliest.

290
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,560
I'm Kurt. I'm 1 1 .
I'm incorrigible.

291
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,800
-Congratulations.
-What's "incorrigible"?

292
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,760
I think it means you want
to be treated like a boy.

293
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be
seven on Tuesday.

294
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
I'd like a pink parasol.

295
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,200
Pink's my favorite color too.

296
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,560
Yes, you're Gretl.

297
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,120
And you're five years old?

298
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,440
My, you're practically a lady.

299
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,760
I have to tell you a secret.
I've never been a governess.

300
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,800
You don't know anything
about being a governess?

301
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,360
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

302
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,600
The best way to start is to tell
Father to mind his own business.

303
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,560
Never come to dinner on time.

304
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,960
Never eat your soup quietly.

305
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,600
During dessert, always blow your nose.

306
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,480
Don't you believe a word they say,
Fräulein Maria.

307
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:26,960
-Oh, why not?
-Because I like you.

308
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,600
Children, outside for your walk.

309
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
Father's orders. Hurry up.

310
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,080
Quick, quick, quick.

311
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,400
Fräulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,
the housekeeper.

312
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,600
How do you do.

313
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,560
I'll show you to your room.
Follow me.

314
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,920
Poor little dears.

315
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,280
You're very lucky. With
Fräulein Helga it was a snake.

316
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,880
Good evening.

317
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,680
-Good evening, children.
-Good evening, Fräulein Maria.

318
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,160
Enchanting little ritual.

319
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Something you learned at the abbey?

320
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,320
No.

321
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,160
Rheumatism.

322
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,560
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we
forgotten to thank the Lord?

323
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,320
For what we receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

324
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,680
-Amen.
-Amen.

325
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,880
I'd like to thank you all. . .

326
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,960
. . .for the precious gift
you left in my pocket today.

327
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,040
What gift?

328
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,120
It's a secret between
the children and me.

329
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,840
Then I suggest you keep it,
and let us eat.

330
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,080
Knowing how nervous
I must have been. . .

331
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,640
. . .a stranger in a new household. . .

332
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,800
. . .knowing how important it was
for me to feel accepted. . .

333
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,080
. . .it was so kind and thoughtful of
you to make my first moments here. . .

334
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,400
. . .so warm and happy. . .

335
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,320
. . .and pleasant.

336
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,160
-What is the matter, Marta?
-Nothing.

337
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Fräulein. . .

338
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,960
. . .is it to be at every meal
or merely at dinnertime. . .

339
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,560
. . .that you intend leading us through
this rare and wonderful new world. . .

340
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,360
. . .of indigestion?

341
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,560
They're all right, captain.
They're just happy.

342
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,160
-Rolf, good evening.
-Good evening, Franz.

343
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,040
-I trust everything is under control?
-Yes, yes.

344
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,920
-Are there any developments?
-Perhaps.

345
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,200
-Is the captain home?
-He's at dinner.

346
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,680
-With the family?
-Yes.

347
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,600
Give him this telegram at once.

348
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
Certainly.

349
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,240
A telegram for you, sir.

350
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,720
Franz? Who delivered it?

351
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,960
That young lad Rolf, of course.

352
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,880
Father, may I be excused?

353
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,080
Children, in the morning I shall
be going to Vienna.

354
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,720
Not again, Father!

355
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,400
How long will you be gone this time?

356
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm not sure, Gretl.

357
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,080
-To visit Baroness Schraeder again?
-Mind your own business!

358
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,840
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

359
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,240
-Why can't we ever see the baroness?
-Why would she want to see you?

360
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,200
You are going to see the baroness.
I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

361
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,320
And Uncle Max.

362
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,920
Uncle Max!

363
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,560
Rolf!

364
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Oh, Rolf!

365
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,800
-No, Liesl. We mustn't!
-Why not, silly?

366
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,560
-I don't know--
-Isn't this why you're waiting?

367
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,560
Yes, of course.

368
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,480
-I've missed you, Liesl.
-You have? How much?

369
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,400
I even thought of sending a telegram,
so I'd be able to deliver it here.

370
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,360
Oh, that's a lovely thought!
Why don't you, right now?

371
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,600
-But I'm here!
-Please, Rolf. Send me a telegram.

372
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,160
I'll start it for you.
"Dear Liesl. . . . "

373
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,280
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able
to tell you. . .

374
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,600
. . .how I feel about you. Stop.

375
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:07,200
Unfortunately, this wire
is already too expensive.

376
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,760
Sincerely, Rolf. "

377
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,600
-"Sincerely"?
-Cordially.

378
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,360
-"Cordially"?
-Affectionately?

379
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,560
Will there be any reply?

380
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,880
"Dear Rolf: Stop.

381
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Don't stop! Your Liesl. "

382
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,160
If only we didn't have to wait
for someone to send Father a telegram.

383
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,720
How do I know when I'll see you again?

384
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
Well, let's see. . . .

385
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
I could come here by mistake.

386
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,920
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!
He's here from Berlin staying with--

387
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,960
No one knows he's here.
Don't tell your father.

388
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,240
-Why not?
-Your father's so Austrian.

389
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,680
We're all Austrian.

390
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,120
Some think we ought to be German, and
they're very mad at those who don't.

391
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,040
They're getting ready to--

392
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,960
Let's hope your father
doesn't get into trouble.

393
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,960
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.
He was even decorated by the emperor.

394
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,280
I don't worry about him.
I worry about his daughter.

395
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,200
Me? Why?

396
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,000
-Well, you're so--
-What?

397
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,840
You're such a baby!

398
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,040
I'm 1 6.
What's such a baby about that?

399
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,560
You wait, little girl
On an empty stage

400
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,040
For fate to turn the light on

401
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,760
Your life, little girl
ls an empty page

402
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,920
That men will want to write on

403
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,880
To write on

404
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,520
You are 16 going on 17

405
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,360
Baby, it's time to think

406
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,080
Better beware
Be canny and careful

407
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,800
Baby, you're on the brink

408
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,800
You are 16 going on 17

409
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,480
Fellows will fall in line

410
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
Eager young lads
And roués and cads

411
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,960
Will offer you food and wine

412
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,840
Totally unprepared are you

413
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,640
To face a world of men

414
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Timid and shy and scared are you

415
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,840
Of things beyond your ken

416
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,760
You need someone older and wiser

417
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,680
Telling you what to do

418
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,200
I am 17 going on 18

419
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,160
I'll take care of you

420
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,560
I am 16 going on 17

421
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,000
I know that I'm naive

422
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,360
Fellows I meet
May tell me I'm sweet

423
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,160
And willingly I believe

424
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,600
I am 16 going on 17

425
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:41,440
Innocent as a rose

426
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,960
Bachelor dandies
Drinkers of brandies

427
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,400
What do I know of those?

428
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,040
Totally unprepared am I

429
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,600
To face a world of men

430
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,200
Timid and shy and scared am I

431
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,000
Of things beyond my ken

432
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,880
I need someone older and wiser

433
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,280
Telling me what to do

434
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,160
You are 17 going on 18

435
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll depend on you

436
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,560
Come in.

437
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,160
Frau Schmidt.

438
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,080
For your new dresses.

439
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,200
-The captain had these sent from town.
-Oh, how lovely!

440
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,760
These will make the prettiest
clothes I've ever had.

441
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,360
Do you think he would
get me more material if I asked?

442
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,080
-How many dresses do you need?
-Not for me, for the children.

443
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I want to make them some play clothes.

444
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,960
The von Trapp children don't play.
They march.

445
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,760
Surely you don't approve of that.

446
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,000
Ever since the captain
lost his poor wife. . .

447
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,840
. . .he runs this house as if on
one of his ships.

448
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,960
Whistles, orders.

449
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,000
No more music, no more laughing.

450
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,600
Nothing that reminds him of her.
Even the children.

451
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,160
But that's so wrong.

452
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,400
Oh, well.

453
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,160
How do you like your room?
There'll be new drapes at the windows.

454
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,600
Bu these are fine.

455
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,400
New ones have been ordered.

456
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,800
-But I really don't need them.
-Good night, now.

457
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,920
Frau Schmidt, if I asked
the captain about the material. . .?

458
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,400
-He's leaving in the morning.
-Of course. How long will he be gone?

459
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,400
It depends. The last time he visited
the baroness, he stayed for a month.

460
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,920
I shouldn't be saying this to you.
I don't know you that well.

461
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,960
But if you ask me,
the captain's thinking seriously. . .

462
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,320
. . .of marrying her before
summer's over.

463
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,640
Wonderful! The children will
have a mother again.

464
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,280
Yes.

465
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,200
Well, good night.

466
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,760
Good night.

467
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,160
Dear Father, now I know
why You sent me here.

468
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,120
To help these children
prepare for a new mother.

469
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,520
And I pray this will become
a happy family in Thy sight.

470
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,720
God bless the captain.
God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

471
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,920
God bless Louisa, Brigitta,
Marta and little Gretl.

472
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,920
And I forgot the other boy.
What's his name?

473
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,320
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

474
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,440
God bless the Reverend Mother
and Sister Margaretta. . .

475
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,320
. . .and everybody at the abbey.

476
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,960
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

477
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,200
Help her know that I'm her friend. . .

478
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,920
. . .and help her tell me
what she's been up to.

479
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,720
Are you going to tell on me?

480
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,240
Help me to be understanding
so I may guide her footsteps.

481
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,040
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

482
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,120
I was out walking
and somebody locked the doors early.

483
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,880
I didn't want to wake everybody,
so when I saw your window open. . . .

484
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,360
You're not going to tell Father,
are you?

485
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,440
How did you climb up?

486
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,920
It's how we always got in
to play tricks on the governess.

487
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,000
Louisa can make it with
a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

488
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,520
Spiders?

489
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,640
Were you out walking all by yourself?

490
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,320
If we wash that dress tonight,
nobody would notice it tomorrow.

491
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,720
You could put this on.

492
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,960
Take your dress and put it
to soak in the bathtub.

493
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,520
Come back here and sit on the bed,
and we'll have a talk.

494
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,720
I told you today
I didn't need a governess.

495
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Well, maybe I do.

496
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,560
Gretl, are you scared?

497
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,160
You're not frightened
of a storm, are you?

498
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,520
You just stay right here with me.

499
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,720
-Where are the others?
-They're asleep. They're not scared.

500
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,720
Oh, no? Look.

501
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,080
All right, up here on the bed.

502
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,960
-Really?
-Well, just this once. Come on.

503
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,160
-Now we'll wait for the boys.
-You won't see them. Boys are brave.

504
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,720
You weren't scared, were you?

505
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,320
Oh, no. We just wanted
to be sure that you weren't.

506
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,240
-That's very thoughtful of you.
-It wasn't my idea.

507
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,280
It was Kurt's!

508
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,040
Kurt! That's the one I left out!
God bless Kurt.

509
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,400
Why does it do that?

510
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,320
The lightning talks to the thunder,
and the thunder answers.

511
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,960
-But lightning must be nasty.
-Not really.

512
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,360
Why does the thunder get so angry?

513
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,720
It makes me want to cry.

514
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,480
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,
I just try to think of nice things.

515
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,440
What kind of things?

516
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,080
Well, let me see. Nice things. . . .

517
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Daffodils.

518
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,920
Green meadows.

519
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,440
Skies full of stars.

520
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,760
Raindrops on roses
and whiskers on kittens

521
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

522
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,200
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

523
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,280
These are a few of my favorite things

524
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,440
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

525
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,760
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

526
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,800
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

527
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,720
These are a few of my favorite things

528
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,560
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

529
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,880
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

530
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,080
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

531
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,520
These are a few of my favorite things

532
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,360
When the dog bites

533
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,200
When the bee stings

534
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,600
When I'm feeling sad

535
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,080
I simply remember my favorite things

536
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:38,880
And then I don 't feel so bad

537
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,200
-Does it work?
-Of course.

538
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,320
-What do you like?
-Pussy willow!

539
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
-Christmas!
-Bunny rabbits!

540
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,960
Snakes!

541
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,280
-Chocolate icing!
-No school!

542
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:51,680
Pillow fights!

543
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,840
-Telegrams!
-Birthday presents!

544
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,440
-Any presents!
-Ladybugs!

545
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,200
A good sneeze!

546
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,160
Gesundheit!

547
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,600
See what fun it is?

548
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,680
Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens

549
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,680
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens

550
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,800
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

551
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:14,760
These are a few of my favorite things

552
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,760
Cream-colored ponies
And crisp apple strudels

553
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,760
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles

554
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,800
Wild geese that fly
With the moon on their wings

555
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,400
These are a few of my favorite things

556
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,760
Together.

557
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,680
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

558
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,680
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

559
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:41,800
Silver white winters
That melt into springs

560
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,200
These are a few of my favorite things

561
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,480
When the dog bi--

562
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,560
Dog bites.

563
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,160
Hello.

564
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,360
Fräulein, did I not tell you that
bedtime is to be strictly observed?

565
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,240
The children were upset
by the storm, so l--

566
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,520
You did, sir.

567
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,760
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty
remembering such simple instructions?

568
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,560
Only during thunderstorms.

569
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,400
Liesl?

570
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,760
I don't recall seeing you
after dinner.

571
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,000
Really? As a matter of fact--

572
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,400
Yes?

573
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,280
Well, I was--

574
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,560
What she would like to say. . .

575
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,480
. . .is that she and I have
been getting acquainted tonight.

576
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,360
It's too late to go into that. You
heard your father. Go back to bed.

577
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,160
Fräulein. . .

578
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,360
. . .you have managed to remember
I'm leaving in the morning?

579
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:50,760
Is it also possible you remember the
first rule in this house is discipline?

580
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,760
Then I trust that before I return. . .

581
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,920
. . .you'll have acquired some?

582
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,560
Captain?

583
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:04,200
Could I talk to you about clothes
for the children for when they play?

584
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,080
-If I could have some material.
-You are many things.

585
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,360
Not the least of which is repetitious.

586
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,680
-But they're children!
-Yes.

587
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,560
And I'm their father.

588
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,320
Good night.

589
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,200
Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes

590
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,600
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

591
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:01,200
When I'm feeling sad

592
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,600
I simply remember my favorite things

593
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,880
And then I don 't feel...

594
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:13,760
...so bad

595
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,360
Children, over here. See!

596
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:44,160
Come on.

597
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,000
Fräulein Maria?

598
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,080
Can we do this every day?

599
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,400
-Don't you think you'd get tired of it?
-I suppose so.

600
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,960
Every other day?

601
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:16,560
I haven't had so much fun since we put
glue on Fräulein Josephine's toothbrush.

602
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,560
I can't understand how children
as nice as you can play such tricks.

603
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,560
-It's easy.
-But why do it?

604
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,080
How else can we get
Father's attention?

605
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,360
Oh, I see.

606
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,760
We'll have to think about that one.

607
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,400
All right, over here.

608
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,960
What are we going to do?

609
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,080
Think of a song for the baroness.

610
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,200
Father doesn't like us to sing.

611
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,880
Perhaps we can change his mind.
Now, what songs do you know?

612
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,200
We don't know any songs.

613
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,000
-Not any?
-We don't even know how to sing.

614
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,680
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

615
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,560
But how?

616
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,480
Let's start at the very beginning

617
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,960
A very good place to start

618
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,000
When you read you begin with

619
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,360
A, B, C

620
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,760
When you sing, you begin with
Do-Re-Mi

621
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,560
Do-re-mi

622
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,080
Do-re-mi

623
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,000
The first three notes
Just happen to be

624
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,960
Do-re-mi

625
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,400
Do-re-mi

626
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,400
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

627
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:31,360
Let's see if I can make it easier.

628
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,160
"Doe, " a deer
A female deer

629
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,800
"Ray, " a drop of golden sun

630
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,680
"Me, " a name I call myself

631
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,480
"Far, " a long long way to run

632
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,360
"Sew, " a needle pulling thread

633
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,280
"La, " a note to follow sew

634
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,400
"Tea, " a drink with jam and bread

635
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,760
That will bring us back to doe

636
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,680
-Doe
-A deer, a female deer

637
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,000
-Ray
-A drop of golden sun

638
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,360
-Me
-A name I call myself

639
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,640
-Far
-A long long way to run

640
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,400
Sew, a needle pulling thread

641
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:25,840
-La
-A note to follow sew

642
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,000
-Tea
-A drink with jam and bread

643
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:31,400
That will bring us back to

644
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,960
-Doe
-A deer, a female deer

645
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,160
Ray, a drop of golden sun

646
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,680
Me, a name I call myself

647
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,880
Far, a long long way to run

648
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,240
Sew, a needle pulling thread

649
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,760
La, a note to follow sew

650
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,480
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

651
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,680
That will bring us back to doe

652
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do

653
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,800
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only
the tools we use to build a song.

654
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,160
Once you have them in your head
you can sing different tunes. . .

655
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,400
. . .by mixing them up. Like this:

656
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,920
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

657
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,160
Can you do that?

658
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,600
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

659
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:31,280
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

660
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,600
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

661
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,520
Now, put it all together.

662
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,080
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

663
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:51,040
So-do-la-ti-do-re-do

664
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:54,080
-Good.
-But it doesn't mean anything.

665
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:57,160
So we put in words.
One word for every note.

666
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,600
Like this:

667
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:05,160
When you know the notes to sing

668
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:10,800
You can sing most anything

669
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:11,960
Together!

670
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:18,600
When you know the notes to sing

671
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:25,200
You can sing most anything

672
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,880
-Doe
-A deer, a female deer

673
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,160
-Ray
-A drop of golden sun

674
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,560
-Me
-A name I call myself

675
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,680
-Far
-A long long way to run

676
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,160
-Sew
-A needle pulling thread

677
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,560
-La
-A note to follow sew

678
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:48,600
-Tea
-A drink with jam and bread

679
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:52,560
That will bring us back to doe

680
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,440
When you know the notes to sing

681
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:22,200
You can sing most anything

682
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,800
Doe
A deer, a female deer

683
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,400
Ray
A drop of golden sun

684
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,960
Me
A name I call myself

685
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,200
Far
A long long way to run

686
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,480
Sew
A needle pulling thread

687
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,800
La
A note to follow sew

688
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
Tea
A drink with jam and bread

689
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,920
That will bring us back to

690
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:56,680
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

691
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,200
So-do-la-fa-ti

692
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,040
La-so

693
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:12,000
Ti-do

694
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:13,600
So-do

695
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,480
The mountains are magnificent,
really magnificent.

696
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,280
-I had them put up just for you.
-Oh?

697
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:34,640
Even if it's to a height
of 1 0,000 feet. . .

698
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,240
. . .Georg always believes in
"rising to the occasion. "

699
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,720
Improve the jokes
or I'll disinvite you.

700
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,760
You didn't invite me.
I invited myself.

701
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,440
-Naturally.
-You needed a chaperone. . .

702
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,280
. . .and I needed a place
where the cuisine is superb. . .

703
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,080
. . .the wine cellar unexcelled. . .

704
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,840
. . .and the price perfect.

705
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,960
Max, you are outrageous.

706
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,040
Not at all.
I'm a very charming sponge.

707
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,640
Listen.

708
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,040
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

709
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,440
They're good.

710
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:16,040
Very good.

711
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,320
I must explore this area
in the next few days.

712
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:22,880
Somewhere, a hungry singing group
is waiting for Max Detweiler. . .

713
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:27,240
. . .to pluck it out and make it famous
at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

714
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,640
-They get fame, you get money.
-It's unfair, I admit it.

715
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,040
But someday that'll be changed.
I shall get the fame too.

716
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,880
Good heavens, what's this?

717
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:47,440
It's nothing.
Just some local urchins.

718
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,840
This really is exciting for me, Georg.
Being here with you.

719
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,080
Trees, lakes,
you've seen them before.

720
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,840
That is not what I mean,
and you know it.

721
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:15,880
-You mean me? I'm exciting?
-Is that so impossible?

722
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,040
No, just highly improbable.

723
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,240
-There you go, running yourself down.
-Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

724
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,440
You're much less of a riddle
when I see you here, Georg.

725
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,360
-In my natural habitat?
-Yes, exactly.

726
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:35,680
Are you saying that I'm more
at home. . .

727
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:39,760
. . .among the birds and the flowers
and the wind that moves. . .

728
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,080
. . .through the trees
like a restless sea?

729
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:43,840
How poetic.

730
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,840
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

731
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,840
More at home here than in Vienna
in all your glittering salons. . .

732
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,240
. . .gossiping gaily with bores I
detest, soaking myself in champagne. . .

733
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,080
. . .stumbling about to waltzes
by Strausses I can't even remember?

734
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,360
-Is that what you're saying?
-Yes.

735
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,840
Now whatever gave you that idea?

736
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,800
Oh, I do like it here, Georg.
It's so lovely and peaceful.

737
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,000
How can you leave it so often?

738
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,960
Oh, pretending to be madly active,
I suppose.

739
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,280
Activity suggests a life
filled with purpose.

740
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,200
Could it be running away
from memories?

741
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,040
Or perhaps just searching
for a reason to stay.

742
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:34,040
I hope that's why you've been
coming to Vienna so often.

743
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:38,840
-Were there other distractions?
-I'd hardly call you a distraction.

744
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:41,640
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

745
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:45,040
Lovely. . .

746
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,480
. . .charming, witty, graceful,
the perfect hostess. . .

747
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,440
. . .and, you're going to hate me
for this. . .

748
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
. . .in a way, my savior.

749
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,840
Oh, how unromantic.

750
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,280
I'd be an ungrateful wretch
if I didn't say. . .

751
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,640
. . .that you brought some meaning back
into my life.

752
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,040
I am amusing, I suppose.

753
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:10,840
I have the finest couturier in Vienna
and a glittering circle of friends.

754
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,040
-I do give some rather gay parties.
-Oh, yes.

755
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,040
But take all that away. . .

756
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,440
. . .and you have just wealthy,
unattached little me. . .

757
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,440
. . .searching, just like you.

758
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:29,960
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

759
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,680
-How many have I had?
-Two.

760
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,760
Make it an uneven three.

761
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:39,840
Still eating, Max?
Must be unhappy.

762
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,840
That mixed quartet I've been trying
to steal away from Sol Hurok. . .

763
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,640
-What happened?
-. . .Sascha Petrie stole them first.

764
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,080
I hate thieves.

765
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,480
Max, you really must try
and learn to love yourself.

766
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,960
I had to call Paris, Rome
and Stockholm.

767
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,640
-On Georg's telephone, of course.
-How else could I afford it?

768
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:03,000
I like rich people, the way they live
and how I live when I'm with them.

769
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,200
I wonder where the children are.

770
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,040
They must have heard
I was coming and hid.

771
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,680
I was hoping they'd be here
to welcome you.

772
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:15,240
Max, do step out of character for
a moment and try and be charming.

773
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,240
Well?

774
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,280
Well what?

775
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:30,280
Have you made up his mind?
Do I hear wedding bells?

776
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,440
-Pealing madly.
-Marvelous.

777
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,280
-Not necessarily for me.
-What kind of talk's that?

778
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,040
None-of-your-business talk.

779
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:39,680
I'm terribly fond of him,
so don't toy with us.

780
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,360
But I'm a child. I like toys.
So tell me everything.

781
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,520
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,
intimate, disgusting detail.

782
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,880
Well, let's just say I have a feeling
I may be here on approval.

783
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:57,040
-I approve of that. How can you miss?
-Far too easily.

784
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,360
If I know you, darling,
and I do, you will find a way.

785
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,040
-He's no ordinary man.
-No, he's rich.

786
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,440
His wife's death gave him
a great heartache.

787
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,640
And your husband's death
gave you a great fortune.

788
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,720
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

789
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:14,800
You and Georg are like family.
That's why I want to see you married.

790
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,440
We must keep all that lovely money
in the family.

791
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,880
-What are you doing there?
-Oh, Captain von Trapp.

792
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:39,080
I was just looking for. . . .

793
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,640
I didn't see, I mean,
I didn't know you were--

794
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,840
Heil Hitler!

795
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:46,960
Who are you?

796
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,360
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

797
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:52,240
-I am Herr Detweiler.
-Yes, sir.

798
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,640
You've delivered your telegram.
Now get out.

799
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:09,320
-Georg, he's just a boy.
-Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

800
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,240
Things will happen.
Make sure they don't happen to you.

801
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,080
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

802
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,440
I have no political convictions.

803
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:20,440
-Can I help it if other people do?
-You can help it.

804
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,640
You must help it.

805
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,040
Hello?

806
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,240
You're far away. Where are you?

807
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:44,240
In a world that's disappearing,
I'm afraid.

808
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,440
Is there any way I could bring you
back to the world I'm in?

809
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,760
-Father! Father!
-There's your father!

810
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:19,040
Oh, captain, you're home!

811
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,640
Come out of that water at once!

812
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,440
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

813
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,440
I'm soaked to the skin!

814
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,240
Straight line!

815
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:17,640
This is Baroness Schraeder.

816
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:21,840
And these. . .

817
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,640
. . .are my children.

818
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,080
How do you do?

819
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,640
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change
your clothes and report back here!

820
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,440
Fräulein, you will stay here, please!

821
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,520
I think I'd better go see
what Max is up to.

822
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:55,040
Now, fräulein. . .

823
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,840
. . .I want a truthful answer.

824
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:00,640
Yes, captain.

825
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:04,840
Is it possible,
or could I have just imagined it?

826
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:10,560
Have my children, by any chance,
been climbing trees today?

827
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,160
Yes, captain.

828
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:14,440
I see.

829
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,320
And where, may I ask,
did they get these. . . .

830
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:21,560
-Play clothes.
-Is that what they are?

831
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:25,040
I made them from the drapes
that used to hang in my bedroom.

832
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,840
-Drapes?
-They have plenty of wear left.

833
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,880
We've been everywhere in them.

834
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,440
Are you telling me that my children
have been roaming about Salzburg. . .

835
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,840
. . .dressed up in nothing
but some old drapes?

836
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,640
And having a marvelous time!

837
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,960
-They have uniforms.
-Forgive me, straitjackets.

838
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,840
They can't be children
if they worry about clothes--

839
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,160
They don't complain.

840
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:50,000
They don't dare.
They love you too much and fear--

841
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:51,720
Don't discuss my children.

842
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,760
You've got to hear, you're
never home--

843
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,400
I don't want to hear more!

844
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,040
I know you don't, but you've got to!

845
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,880
-Liesl's not a child.
-Not one word--

846
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,880
Soon she'll be a woman
and you won't even know her.

847
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,080
Friedrich wants to be a man
but you're not here to show--

848
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:08,640
Don't you dare tell me--

849
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,960
Brigitta could tell you about him.
She notices everything.

850
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,200
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain
when you ignore him. . .

851
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,880
. . .the way you do all of them.

852
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,440
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

853
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,760
The little ones just want love.
Please, love them all.

854
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,480
I don't care to hear more.

855
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,640
-I am not finished yet, captain!
-Oh, yes, you are, captain!

856
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:31,240
Fräulein.

857
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:36,440
Now, you will pack
your things this minute. . .

858
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,040
. . .and return to the abbey.

859
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,840
What's that?

860
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:45,480
It's singing.

861
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,800
Yes, I realize it's singing.
But who is singing?

862
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,240
The children.

863
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,280
The children?

864
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:58,440
I taught them something to sing
for the baroness.

865
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,640
My heart wants to sing
Every song it hears

866
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,360
Every song that it hears

867
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:17,840
My heart wants to beat like the wings
Of the birds that rise

868
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,080
From the lake to the trees

869
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,680
To the trees

870
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,640
My heart wants to sigh
Like a chime that flies

871
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,280
From a church on a breeze

872
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,280
To laugh like a brook
When it trips and falls

873
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,360
Over stones on its way

874
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,960
On its way

875
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,440
To sing through the night

876
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:51,080
Like a lark who is learning to pray

877
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,640
I go to the hills

878
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,840
When my heart is lonely

879
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:05,640
I know I will hear

880
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:11,440
What I've heard before

881
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,280
My heart will be blessed

882
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:23,200
With the sound of music

883
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:29,040
And I'll sing...

884
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:37,040
...once more

885
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,640
Edelweiss!

886
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:17,440
You never told me how enchanting
your children are.

887
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:27,240
Don't go away.

888
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:33,440
Fräulein.

889
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:37,840
I. . .

890
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,920
. . .behaved badly. I apologize.

891
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:47,040
I'm far too outspoken.
It's one of my worst faults.

892
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,840
You were right.

893
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,040
I don't know my children.

894
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:58,240
There's still time, captain.
They want so much to be close to you.

895
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:02,240
And you brought music back
into the house.

896
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,920
I'd forgotten.

897
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,840
Fräulein.

898
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,440
I want you to stay.

899
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,920
I ask you to stay.

900
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,040
-If I could be of any help.
-You have already.

901
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,600
More than you know.

902
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,840
Marta.

903
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,720
Curtain!

904
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:53,440
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

905
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,040
Loud was the voice
Of the lonely goatherd

906
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:02,640
Folks in a town
That was quite remote heard

907
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,240
Lusty and clear
From the goatherd's throat heard

908
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,040
Marta. Marta!

909
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,240
Gretl, the prince!

910
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:30,240
A prince on the bridge
Of a castle moat heard

911
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,880
Men on a road
With a load to tote heard

912
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,440
Men in the midst
Of a table d'hôte heard

913
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:43,840
Men drinking beer
With the foam afloat heard

914
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:57,440
One little girl
ln a pale pink coat heard

915
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:02,240
She yodeled back
To the lonely goatherd

916
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:06,640
Soon her mama
With a gleaming gloat heard

917
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:11,240
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

918
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,040
One little girl
ln a pale pink coat heard

919
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,640
She yodeled back
To the lonely goatherd

920
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:08,240
Soon her mama
With a gleaming gloat heard

921
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,640
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

922
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:15,840
Happy are they

923
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:21,840
Soon the duet will become a trio

924
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,840
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

925
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:48,440
Very good!

926
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:52,040
Wonderful!

927
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,640
-Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?
-Yes, can we?

928
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,800
Of course you may, my darlings.

929
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,040
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner
to send the bill to your father?

930
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,240
Well done, fräulein.

931
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:11,480
I really am very much impressed.

932
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:13,640
They're your children, captain.

933
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,760
My dear, is there anything
you can't do?

934
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,240
Well, I'm not sure
I'll make a good nun.

935
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,440
If you have any problems,
I'd be happy to help you.

936
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:32,800
Attention, everyone!

937
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,280
I have an announcement to make.
Surprise! Surprise!

938
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,760
Today, after a long
and desperate search. . .

939
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,800
. . .I have found a most exciting
entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

940
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,760
Congratulations, Max.

941
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,840
And who will you
be exploiting this time?

942
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,640
-The Saint lgnatius Choir?
-Guess again.

943
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:58,080
Well, let me see now.
The Klopmann Choir?

944
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,560
-No, no, no, no.
-No, no?

945
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,960
Tell us.

946
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,480
A singing group all in one family.
You'll never guess, Georg.

947
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,480
What a charming idea!

948
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,440
Whose family?

949
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,840
Yours.

950
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,240
They'll be the talk of the festival.

951
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,880
-Well, now, what's so funny?
-You are, Max.

952
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,120
You're expensive, but very funny.

953
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,080
-They'll be a sensation!
-No, Max.

954
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,400
It's a wonderful idea.
Fresh, original.

955
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,240
Max! My children
do not sing in public.

956
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,760
You can't blame me for trying.

957
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,840
Children, who shall we hear
from next?

958
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:43,640
Who?

959
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:50,720
Yes.

960
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:55,320
The vote is unanimous.

961
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,640
You, captain.

962
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,040
Me?

963
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:02,040
-I don't understand.
-Please.

964
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,040
No, no, no, no.

965
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:12,240
I'm told that you were quite good.

966
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,640
-That was a very, very long time ago.
-I remember, Father.

967
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:18,640
-Play us something we know.
-Oh, please, Father.

968
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,440
Well. . . .

969
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,360
-Why didn't you tell me?
-What?

970
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,840
To bring along my harmonica.

971
01:21:39,080 --> 01:21:41,120
Edelweiss

972
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:44,840
Edelweiss

973
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:51,840
Every morning you greet me

974
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:55,000
Small and white

975
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,040
Clean and bright

976
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:01,960
You look happy...

977
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,840
... to meet me

978
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:08,280
Blossom of snow

979
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:12,480
May you bloom and grow

980
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:18,800
Bloom and grow forever

981
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:23,240
Edelweiss

982
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,000
Edelweiss

983
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:33,560
Bless my homeland forever

984
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,880
-Edelweiss
-Edelweiss

985
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,480
-Edelweiss
-Edelweiss

986
01:22:44,720 --> 01:22:50,840
Every morning you greet me

987
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:54,480
-Small and white
-Small and white

988
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,040
-Clean and bright
-Clean and bright

989
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:00,640
You look happy...

990
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,320
... to meet me

991
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:06,840
Blossom of snow

992
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:11,040
May you bloom and grow

993
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:18,040
Bloom and grow forever

994
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,760
Edelweiss

995
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,560
Edelweiss

996
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:34,640
Bless my homeland forever

997
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:47,040
Anytime you say the word, Georg,
you can be part of my new act:

998
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,640
The von Trapp Family Singers.

999
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:53,080
I have a wonderful idea, Georg.

1000
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,680
Let's really fill this house
with music.

1001
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:58,760
You must give a grand
and glorious party for me.

1002
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,600
-A party?
-Yes, Father, please!

1003
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,080
It's high time
I met all your friends. . .

1004
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,760
. . .and they met me.
Don't you agree?

1005
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:09,160
-I see what you mean.
-Oh, please!

1006
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:12,440
Children, it's bedtime.
Come now, say good night.

1007
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:14,560
Good night, Father.

1008
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,480
-Good night.
-Good night, Baroness Schraeder.

1009
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,240
Good night, Father.

1010
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,840
Good night, Uncle Max.

1011
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:28,720
It'll be my first party, Father!

1012
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,440
-Captain.
-Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.

1013
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,640
-Good evening, Herr Zeller.
-Baroness.

1014
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,240
How do you do? Good evening.

1015
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,320
Did you notice the obvious
display of the Austrian flag?

1016
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,840
The women look so beautiful.

1017
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,320
I think they look ugly.

1018
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,360
You're just scared of them.

1019
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,760
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1020
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:50,760
-I think the men look beautiful.
-How would you know?

1021
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,240
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1022
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,040
Nobody.

1023
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,640
Oh, yes, you are.

1024
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,440
May I have this dance?

1025
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:20,040
I'd be delighted, young man.

1026
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:29,080
Why didn't you tell me
you could dance?

1027
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,040
We feared you'd make us all dance.
The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1028
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,920
What are they playing?

1029
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,640
It's the Laendler.
An Austrian folk dance.

1030
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,880
-Show me.
-I haven't danced since I was little.

1031
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,960
You remember. Please?

1032
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,080
-Well. . . .
-Please.

1033
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,440
All right. Come on over here.

1034
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,640
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1035
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,360
-Like this?
-Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1036
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:02,160
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1037
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,840
One, two, three, step together.
Now, step hop, step hop.

1038
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:09,640
Now turn under. Not quite.

1039
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,640
This way. Hop step, hop.
And under.

1040
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:15,920
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1041
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,560
Do allow me, will you?

1042
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,040
I don't remember anymore.

1043
01:28:46,120 --> 01:28:48,240
-Your face is all red.
-Is it?

1044
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:51,520
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1045
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:56,040
Why, that was beautifully done.

1046
01:28:56,240 --> 01:28:58,120
What a lovely couple you make.

1047
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,360
It's time the children
said good night.

1048
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,880
We'll be in the hall.

1049
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,880
-We have something special prepared.
-Right!

1050
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,280
Yes, come on!

1051
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,080
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1052
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:18,240
You thought you wouldn't find
a friend at the party.

1053
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,440
-A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?
-Oh, I don't know.

1054
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,600
It seemed rather warm to me.

1055
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:31,800
Ladies and gentlemen.

1056
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,440
The children of Captain von Trapp
wish to say good night to you.

1057
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,720
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

1058
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,520
And the bells in the steeple too

1059
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,600
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

1060
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,160
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

1061
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,000
Coo-coo

1062
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:07,400
Coo-coo

1063
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,720
Regretfully they tell us

1064
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:11,240
But firmly they compel us

1065
01:30:11,480 --> 01:30:14,400
To say goodbye

1066
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:19,720
To you

1067
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,480
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1068
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:30,400
I hate to go
And leave this pretty sight

1069
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,560
So long, farewell,
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1070
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:44,600
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

1071
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:55,280
So long, farewell
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

1072
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,360
I'd like to stay
And taste my first champagne

1073
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,920
-Yes?
-No.

1074
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:09,560
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1075
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,720
I leave and heave a sigh
And say goodbye

1076
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,760
Goodbye

1077
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:23,640
I'm glad to go

1078
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:26,600
I cannot tell a lie

1079
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:29,840
I flit, I float

1080
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:33,400
I fleetly flee, I fly

1081
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:48,520
The sun has gone to bed

1082
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:52,320
And so must I

1083
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,840
So long

1084
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,520
Farewell

1085
01:31:57,720 --> 01:32:02,920
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1086
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:08,240
Goodbye

1087
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,320
Goodbye

1088
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:21,120
Goodbye

1089
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:29,440
Goodbye

1090
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,920
Extraordinary!
What they'd do at the festival.

1091
01:32:37,160 --> 01:32:39,520
Young lady,
I must have a word with you.

1092
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,360
Georg, you won't let this girl
get away. She must join the party.

1093
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,920
-No, really l--
-Stop. Stop it now.

1094
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,000
-Georg, please.
-You can if you want to, fräulein.

1095
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,560
I insist.
You will be my dinner partner.

1096
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,640
This is business.
Franz. . .

1097
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,920
. . .set another place next to mine
for Fräulein Maria.

1098
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,640
-Whatever you say.
-It appears to be all arranged.

1099
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,160
-It does.
-I'm not suitably dressed.

1100
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:07,680
You can change. We'll wait.

1101
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,920
Captain, you must be very proud
of your youngsters.

1102
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:14,960
I am, thank you.

1103
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:19,560
Is there a more beautiful expression
of what is good in our country. . .

1104
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,120
. . .than the innocent voices
of our children?

1105
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:24,800
Oh, come now, baron.

1106
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:28,640
Would you have us believe that Austria
holds a monopoly on virtue?

1107
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:33,440
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer
Austrian voices raised in song. . .

1108
01:33:33,680 --> 01:33:35,960
. . .to ugly German threats.

1109
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:40,440
The ostrich buries his head
in the sand. . .

1110
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:43,480
. . .and sometimes in the flag.

1111
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,040
Perhaps those who would warn you that
the Anschluss is coming, and it is. . .

1112
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:51,840
. . .would get further with you by setting
their words to music.

1113
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,480
If the Nazis take over Austria, you
will be the entire trumpet section.

1114
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:57,800
You flatter me.

1115
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,520
Oh, how clumsy of me.
I meant to accuse you.

1116
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,320
It's very kind of you
to offer to help me, baroness.

1117
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:14,120
I'm delighted, Maria.

1118
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:18,120
I really don't think I have anything
that would be appropriate.

1119
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:22,520
Now where is that lovely little thing
you were wearing the other evening?

1120
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,920
When the captain couldn't keep
his eyes off you.

1121
01:34:29,160 --> 01:34:30,920
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1122
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:33,920
Come, my dear, we are women.

1123
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:37,360
Let's not pretend we don't know
when a man notices us.

1124
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,920
-Here we are.
-The captain notices everybody.

1125
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:43,800
There's no need to feel
so defensive, Maria.

1126
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:46,360
You are quite attractive, you know.

1127
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:50,120
The captain would hardly be a man
if he didn't notice you.

1128
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,920
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1129
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:55,560
Not at all.

1130
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,320
I've never done a thing to--

1131
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,120
You don't have to, my dear.

1132
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:04,320
Nothing's more irresistible to a man
than a woman who's in love with him.

1133
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:07,920
-In love with him?
-Of course.

1134
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:12,080
What makes it so nice is
he thinks he's in love with you.

1135
01:35:14,680 --> 01:35:16,240
But that's not true.

1136
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:19,960
Surely you've noticed the way
he looks into your eyes.

1137
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:24,920
And you know, you blushed in his arms
when you were dancing just now.

1138
01:35:26,120 --> 01:35:27,760
Don't take it to heart.

1139
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,200
He'll get over it soon enough,
I think.

1140
01:35:30,440 --> 01:35:32,320
Men do, you know.

1141
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:34,320
Then I should go.

1142
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:37,040
I mustn't stay here.

1143
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,320
-Is there something I can do to help?
-No, nothing.

1144
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:53,240
Yes.

1145
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,160
Don't say a word to the captain.

1146
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:01,120
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1147
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,160
Goodbye, Maria.

1148
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,600
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1149
01:36:41,400 --> 01:36:43,320
Champagne, darling.

1150
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:47,520
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1151
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,560
-You know something.
-Perhaps.

1152
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:00,160
If you're so clever, tell me how to
get fräulein to influence Georg.

1153
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:02,920
I want those children in the festival.

1154
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:05,520
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1155
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:07,400
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1156
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:09,120
I thought of that.

1157
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,720
Well, if it's a matter of influence. . .

1158
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,720
. . .maybe the one you have
to be talking to is me.

1159
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,220
-Two.
-Three.

1160
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:22,860
-Four.
-Five.

1161
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:26,060
-Six.
-Seven.

1162
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,820
Eight.

1163
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,820
-Four.
-Two.

1164
01:38:30,900 --> 01:38:32,660
-Seven.
-Five.

1165
01:38:32,860 --> 01:38:35,020
-Two.
-Six.

1166
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:41,420
Isn't this fun?

1167
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:45,020
-Four.
-I'm number five.

1168
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:47,340
-Oh, yes.
-Eight.

1169
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,860
-Two.
-Four.

1170
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:51,420
Six.

1171
01:38:53,820 --> 01:38:55,020
Two.

1172
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,940
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind
if we stop now? We're tired.

1173
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:01,060
Whatever you want, dear.

1174
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:03,220
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1175
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:15,060
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1176
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:17,620
Have some lemonade.

1177
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,180
There must be an easier way.

1178
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:24,660
I get a fiendish delight thinking
of you as the mother of seven.

1179
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,340
How do you plan to do it?

1180
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:29,540
Darling, haven't you ever heard. . .

1181
01:39:29,780 --> 01:39:32,780
. . .of a delightful little thing
called boarding school?

1182
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,020
Baroness Machiavelli.

1183
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:39,220
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1184
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:41,220
I think he's in the house.

1185
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:43,860
What's the matter
with all you gloomy pussies?

1186
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,740
-Nothing.
-I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1187
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:47,820
What for?

1188
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:50,420
Let's make believe we're on-stage
at the festival.

1189
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:54,340
-I don't feel like singing.
-Not without Fräulein Maria.

1190
01:39:54,580 --> 01:39:56,860
Liesl, get the guitar.
Come on, Marta.

1191
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,940
Everybody into the group.
Get in your places.

1192
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:02,820
Now be cheerful, right?
Give us the key, Liesl.

1193
01:40:04,660 --> 01:40:07,220
Now, impress me.

1194
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,340
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1195
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:14,980
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1196
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:18,860
But you sang so beautifully
the night of the party.

1197
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,340
Come on, all of you.
Try something you know.

1198
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,020
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1199
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,820
All right, Liesl.

1200
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:31,860
The hills are alive

1201
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:39,460
With the sound of music

1202
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:45,460
With songs they have sung

1203
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:53,220
For a thousand years

1204
01:40:53,860 --> 01:40:59,060
The hills fill my heart

1205
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:06,660
With the sound of music

1206
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:09,540
They wanted to sing for me,
bless their hearts.

1207
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,620
That's lovely, lovely.
Don't stop.

1208
01:41:15,460 --> 01:41:19,220
-Something long and cool, Georg?
-No, thank you, darling.

1209
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,900
-Father?
-Yes, Brigitta?

1210
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:24,540
Is it true Fräulein Maria
isn't coming back?

1211
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:27,780
Yes, I suppose it's true.
What have we got here?

1212
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:32,620
-Pink lemonade.
-Laced with lemonade.

1213
01:41:33,300 --> 01:41:34,740
I don't believe it, Father.

1214
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,060
-What?
-About Fräulein Maria.

1215
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:39,620
Oh, Fräulein Maria!

1216
01:41:39,860 --> 01:41:43,220
Didn't I tell you what her note said?
I'm sure I did.

1217
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:46,340
She said she missed her life
at the abbey.

1218
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:48,660
She had to leave us.

1219
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:50,420
And that's all there is to it.

1220
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:54,620
I think I'm brave enough to try
some of that.

1221
01:41:54,820 --> 01:41:57,460
-She didn't even say goodbye.
-She did in her note.

1222
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,460
That isn't the same thing.

1223
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,300
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1224
01:42:02,020 --> 01:42:03,940
Just too pink.

1225
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,300
Father, who is our new governess
going to be?

1226
01:42:14,660 --> 01:42:15,660
Well. . .

1227
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:22,980
. . .you're not going to have
a governess anymore.

1228
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:25,820
-We're not?
-No.

1229
01:42:27,980 --> 01:42:30,020
You're going to have a new mother.

1230
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,020
A new mother?

1231
01:42:33,780 --> 01:42:36,820
We talked about it last night.
It's all settled.

1232
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,620
And we're all going to be very happy.

1233
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,620
Well, all right, all right.
Run off and play.

1234
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,220
Yes, my children?

1235
01:43:45,420 --> 01:43:47,700
-My name is Liesl.
-Yes, Liesl?

1236
01:43:48,180 --> 01:43:51,980
We, my brothers and sisters,
want to see Fräulein Maria.

1237
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,020
Fräulein Maria?

1238
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:57,620
Oh, Maria.

1239
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,220
Come in, please.

1240
01:44:04,980 --> 01:44:06,420
Wait here.

1241
01:44:16,900 --> 01:44:19,980
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand
you inquired about Maria.

1242
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:22,620
We have to see her.
Will you tell her we're here?

1243
01:44:22,860 --> 01:44:25,340
-I'm afraid I can't do that.
-But you've got to!

1244
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,580
-She's our governess.
-We want her back.

1245
01:44:27,780 --> 01:44:29,620
She didn't even say goodbye.

1246
01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:31,540
All we want to do is talk to her.

1247
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:35,060
I'm very sorry,
but Maria is in seclusion.

1248
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:38,260
-She hasn't been seeing anyone.
-She'll see us.

1249
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,900
I want to show her my finger.

1250
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,860
Some other time, dear.

1251
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:44,420
I'll tell her you were here.

1252
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:47,620
-It was sweet of you to call.
-We have to speak to her!

1253
01:44:48,220 --> 01:44:51,220
Run along, children.
Run along home.

1254
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,020
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1255
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:55,420
Sister Margaretta, please.

1256
01:44:55,620 --> 01:44:59,220
-Goodbye, children.
-Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1257
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:03,540
What was that about, Sister?

1258
01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:05,860
The von Trapp children,
Reverend Mother.

1259
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:08,460
They want to see Maria.

1260
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,940
Has she spoken yet?
Has she told you anything?

1261
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:15,020
She doesn't say a word,
Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1262
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:16,220
Poor child.

1263
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:19,260
It's strange.
She seems happy to be back here. . .

1264
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,620
. . .and yet she's unhappy too.

1265
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:26,820
Perhaps I have been wrong
in leaving her alone so long.

1266
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:29,620
Bring her to me,
even if she's not yet ready.

1267
01:45:29,820 --> 01:45:31,420
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1268
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:40,100
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant
to the robing room.

1269
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:43,220
God bless you, my daughter.

1270
01:45:49,180 --> 01:45:50,820
Yes, bring her in.

1271
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,620
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1272
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,740
Reverend Mother.

1273
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:07,620
Why did they send you back to us?

1274
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:10,300
They didn't send me back.
I left.

1275
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,220
Sit down, Maria.

1276
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:16,420
Tell me what happened.

1277
01:46:21,420 --> 01:46:22,660
I was frightened.

1278
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:27,220
-Frightened? Were they unkind to you.
-Oh, no!

1279
01:46:27,460 --> 01:46:31,020
No, I was confused. I felt. . . .

1280
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:34,420
I've never felt that way before.

1281
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:38,260
I couldn't stay. I knew that here
I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1282
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:43,020
Maria, our abbey is not to be used
as an escape.

1283
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,420
What is it you can't face?

1284
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,660
I can't face him again.

1285
01:46:49,460 --> 01:46:50,900
Him?

1286
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:54,420
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1287
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,220
Captain von Trapp?

1288
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:13,020
-Are you in love with him?
-I don't know!

1289
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:14,620
I don't know. I--

1290
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:18,860
The baroness said I was.
She said that he was in love with me.

1291
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:21,620
But I didn't want to believe it.

1292
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:24,860
There were times we looked
at each other.

1293
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:26,580
I could hardly breathe.

1294
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:29,540
-Did you let him see your feelings?
-I don't know.

1295
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:32,660
That's what's torturing me.
I was on God's errand.

1296
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:37,620
To have asked for his love would have
been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1297
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:42,420
I'm ready at this moment
to take my vows.

1298
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:46,220
-Please help me.
-Maria.

1299
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:52,220
The love of a man and a woman is holy.
You have a great capacity to love.

1300
01:47:52,460 --> 01:47:55,260
You must find out how God
wants you to spend your love.

1301
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:59,220
But I pledged my life to God.
I pledged my life to his service.

1302
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:03,620
My daughter, if you love this man,
it doesn't mean you love God less.

1303
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:07,020
No.

1304
01:48:07,220 --> 01:48:09,020
You must find out.

1305
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:13,100
You must go back.

1306
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:15,220
You can't ask me to do that.

1307
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:17,820
-Please let me stay. I beg--
-Maria.

1308
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:21,820
These walls were not built
to shut out problems.

1309
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:23,540
You have to face them.

1310
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:27,220
You have to live the life
you were born to live.

1311
01:48:32,820 --> 01:48:37,020
Climb every mountain

1312
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:40,820
Search high and low

1313
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:45,620
Follow every byway

1314
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:49,940
Every path you know

1315
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:54,660
Climb every mountain

1316
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:59,060
Ford every stream

1317
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:03,500
Follow every rainbow

1318
01:49:03,740 --> 01:49:07,860
Till you find your dream

1319
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:11,060
A dream that will need

1320
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:15,940
All the love you can give

1321
01:49:16,660 --> 01:49:19,940
Every day of your life

1322
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:26,340
For as long as you live

1323
01:49:26,620 --> 01:49:30,740
Climb every mountain

1324
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:35,140
Ford every stream

1325
01:49:35,380 --> 01:49:39,740
Follow every rainbow

1326
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:48,020
Till you find your dream

1327
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:52,460
A dream that will need

1328
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:58,060
All the love you can give

1329
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:01,620
Every day of your life

1330
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:08,060
For as long as you live

1331
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:12,540
Climb every mountain

1332
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:16,540
Ford every stream

1333
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:21,620
Follow every rainbow

1334
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:25,900
Till you find...

1335
01:50:26,180 --> 01:50:35,740
... your dream

1336
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:41,620
Now, it's not like my children
to be secretive.

1337
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,820
We're not being secretive, Father.

1338
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,660
And it's not like my children
to be late for dinner.

1339
01:50:48,900 --> 01:50:52,220
-We lost track of the time.
-I see.

1340
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:56,260
Who's going to be the first one
to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1341
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,460
Brigitta. Liesl.

1342
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:01,900
Where do you think we were, Father?

1343
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:12,060
If you don't believe us, you must have
some idea of where you think we were.

1344
01:51:15,500 --> 01:51:17,220
-Marta.
-Yes, Father.

1345
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,620
You tell me.

1346
01:51:19,860 --> 01:51:23,380
Friedrich told you, Father.
We were berry picking.

1347
01:51:24,180 --> 01:51:28,620
-I forgot! You were berry picking.
-Yes, we love berry picking.

1348
01:51:28,860 --> 01:51:29,940
All afternoon?

1349
01:51:30,180 --> 01:51:31,820
-We picked thousands.
-Thousands?

1350
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:34,820
-They were all over the place.
-What kind of berries?

1351
01:51:35,060 --> 01:51:38,220
-Blueberries, sir.
-Blueberries.

1352
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:43,300
It's too early for blueberries.

1353
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:46,700
-They were strawberries.
-Strawberries?

1354
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:50,020
It's been so cold lately,
they turned blue.

1355
01:51:55,580 --> 01:51:57,700
Very well. Show me the berries.

1356
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:00,060
-We. . . .
-Well. . . .

1357
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:02,940
-Show me the berries you picked.
-We don't have them.

1358
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:05,340
You don't have them?
What happened to them?

1359
01:52:05,580 --> 01:52:08,260
-We. . . .
-We ate them.

1360
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,940
-You ate them?
-Yes!

1361
01:52:11,140 --> 01:52:12,660
-They were so good.
-Delicious.

1362
01:52:12,860 --> 01:52:14,060
Very well.

1363
01:52:14,300 --> 01:52:19,220
Since you've obviously stuffed
yourselves on thousands of berries. . .

1364
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:23,220
. . .you can't be hungry anymore,
so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt. . .

1365
01:52:23,460 --> 01:52:26,220
. . .to skip your dinner.

1366
01:52:35,020 --> 01:52:37,660
It's your fault.
We should have told him the truth.

1367
01:52:37,900 --> 01:52:39,820
And made him boiling mad at us?

1368
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:41,860
It's better than starving to death.

1369
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,820
We didn't do anything wrong.
We just wanted to see her.

1370
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:49,100
My stomach's making noises.

1371
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:52,220
The least they could have done
was to let us say hello.

1372
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:57,060
-I wonder what grass tastes like.
-I feel awful.

1373
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:01,580
When Fräulein Maria wanted to feel
better she used to sing that song.

1374
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,540
Let's try it.

1375
01:53:03,780 --> 01:53:06,340
Raindrops on roses

1376
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:10,500
And whiskers on kittens

1377
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:13,740
Bright copper kettles

1378
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:16,900
And warm woolen mittens

1379
01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:23,940
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings

1380
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:29,940
These are a few of my favorite things

1381
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:32,140
Why don't I feel better?

1382
01:53:33,260 --> 01:53:35,460
Girls in white dresses

1383
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,660
With blue satin sashes

1384
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:44,340
Snowflakes that stay
On my nose and eyelashes

1385
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:47,700
-Silver white winters...
-Fräulein Maria's back!

1386
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,180
... that melt into springs

1387
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:52,660
These are a few of my favorite things

1388
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:55,860
When the dog bites
When the bee stings

1389
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:58,140
When I'm feeling sad

1390
01:53:58,620 --> 01:54:01,460
I simply remember my favorite things

1391
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:03,860
And then I don 't feel

1392
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:10,540
So bad

1393
01:54:10,780 --> 01:54:13,700
-Children, I'm so glad to see you.
-We missed you.

1394
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:14,940
I missed you.

1395
01:54:15,180 --> 01:54:17,220
-Kurt, how are you?
-Hungry.

1396
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:21,220
-What happened to your finger?
-It got caught.

1397
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:23,540
-Caught in what?
-Friedrich's teeth.

1398
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:26,820
-Liesl, you all right?
-Just fair.

1399
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:29,860
-Any telegrams been delivered lately?
-None at all.

1400
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:33,420
But I'm learning to accept it.
I'll be glad when school begins.

1401
01:54:33,660 --> 01:54:38,220
Liesl, you can't use school to escape
your problems. You have to face them.

1402
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,820
I have so much to tell you.

1403
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:41,980
We have things to tell you too.

1404
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:45,820
The most important thing is
that Father is going to be married.

1405
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,060
Married?

1406
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:49,340
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1407
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,420
Oh, I see.

1408
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:03,420
Father, look!
Fräulein Maria's back!

1409
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:05,580
Fräulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1410
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:08,740
Good evening, captain.

1411
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:11,420
Good evening.

1412
01:55:13,820 --> 01:55:15,620
Everyone inside for dinner.

1413
01:55:15,860 --> 01:55:17,420
Dinner!

1414
01:55:26,380 --> 01:55:30,860
You left without saying goodbye.
Even to the children.

1415
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:33,340
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1416
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:36,420
Why did you?

1417
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:39,340
Please don't ask me.
The reason no longer exists.

1418
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:43,420
Fräulein Maria, you've returned.

1419
01:55:44,580 --> 01:55:46,340
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1420
01:55:49,500 --> 01:55:51,620
I wish you every happiness,
baroness.

1421
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:54,460
You too, captain.
The children say you're to marry.

1422
01:55:54,700 --> 01:55:55,740
Thank you, my dear.

1423
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:01,620
You are back to stay?

1424
01:56:03,620 --> 01:56:06,820
Only until arrangements can be made
for another governess.

1425
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:01,780
There you are.

1426
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:17,980
I must speak to cook
about the schnitzel.

1427
01:57:18,220 --> 01:57:21,380
It is entirely too delicious
for my figure.

1428
01:57:21,780 --> 01:57:24,620
And it makes you much too quiet
at the dinner table.

1429
01:57:24,860 --> 01:57:26,780
Or was it the wine?

1430
01:57:27,020 --> 01:57:28,780
Undoubtedly the wine.

1431
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:33,420
You have no idea
the trouble I'm having. . .

1432
01:57:33,660 --> 01:57:36,300
. . .trying to decide on
a wedding present for you.

1433
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:38,620
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1434
01:57:38,860 --> 01:57:42,380
But I do want you to have
some little trifle for the occasion.

1435
01:57:42,580 --> 01:57:44,820
At first I thought
of a fountain pen. . .

1436
01:57:45,060 --> 01:57:47,220
. . .but you've already got one.

1437
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:50,300
Then I thought perhaps a villa
in the south of France. . .

1438
01:57:50,540 --> 01:57:53,100
. . .but they are so difficult
to gift-wrap.

1439
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:55,660
Oh, Georg, how do you
feel about yachts?

1440
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:58,100
A long, sleek one
for the Mediterranean. . .

1441
01:57:58,340 --> 01:58:00,980
. . .or a tiny one
for your bathtub, huh?

1442
01:58:03,060 --> 01:58:05,020
-Elsa.
-Where to go on our honeymoon?

1443
01:58:05,260 --> 01:58:06,780
Now, that's a real problem.

1444
01:58:06,980 --> 01:58:10,220
A trip around the world
would be lovely. And then I said:

1445
01:58:10,460 --> 01:58:13,220
"Oh, Elsa, there must be
someplace better to go. "

1446
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:15,780
-But don't worry, darling, I'll--
-Elsa.

1447
01:58:16,460 --> 01:58:17,620
Yes, Georg.

1448
01:58:18,620 --> 01:58:19,860
It's no use. . .

1449
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,380
. . .you and l.

1450
01:58:23,860 --> 01:58:26,980
I'm being dishonest to both of us. . .

1451
01:58:28,260 --> 01:58:29,820
. . .and utterly unfair to you.

1452
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,540
-When two people talk of marriage--
-No, don't.

1453
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:40,380
Don't say another word, please.

1454
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:48,380
You see, there are other things
I've been thinking of.

1455
01:58:49,260 --> 01:58:53,780
Fond as I am of you, I really don't
think you're the right man for me.

1456
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:58,580
You're much too independent.

1457
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:03,420
And I need someone
who needs me desperately. . .

1458
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:06,580
. . .or at least needs
my money desperately.

1459
01:59:08,660 --> 01:59:13,380
I've enjoyed every moment we've had
together and I do thank you for that.

1460
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:17,820
Now, if you'll forgive me. . .

1461
01:59:18,060 --> 01:59:20,020
. . .I'll go inside,
pack my little bags. . .

1462
01:59:20,260 --> 01:59:22,660
. . .and return to Vienna
where I belong.

1463
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:29,580
And somewhere out there. . .

1464
01:59:29,820 --> 01:59:34,060
. . .is a young lady who, I think. . .

1465
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:35,500
. . .will never be a nun.

1466
01:59:47,140 --> 01:59:49,380
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1467
02:00:14,060 --> 02:00:15,180
Hello.

1468
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:24,180
I thought I just might find you here.

1469
02:00:28,180 --> 02:00:30,380
Was there something you wanted?

1470
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:33,780
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1471
02:00:34,660 --> 02:00:35,980
Please.

1472
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,180
May l?

1473
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:58,580
You know, I was thinking
and I was wondering two things:

1474
02:00:59,660 --> 02:01:03,780
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1475
02:01:04,540 --> 02:01:09,060
And what was it
that made you come back?

1476
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:14,900
Well, I had an obligation
to fulfill. . .

1477
02:01:15,140 --> 02:01:17,180
. . .and I came back to fulfill it.

1478
02:01:17,780 --> 02:01:19,180
Is that all?

1479
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:22,500
And I missed the children.

1480
02:01:22,820 --> 02:01:23,980
Yes.

1481
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:27,980
-Only the children?
-No. Yes.

1482
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:31,820
-Isn't it right that I missed them?
-Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1483
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:34,580
I was only hoping that perhaps you. . . .

1484
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:37,340
Perhaps you might. . . .

1485
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:40,180
Yes?

1486
02:01:41,860 --> 02:01:46,980
Well, nothing was the same
when you were away. . .

1487
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:50,780
. . .and it'll be all wrong again
after you leave. . .

1488
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:55,500
. . .and I just thought perhaps
you might change your mind.

1489
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:03,420
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be
able to make things fine for you.

1490
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:04,980
Maria. . . .

1491
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:10,380
-There isn't going to be any baroness.
-There isn't?

1492
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:13,980
No.

1493
02:02:14,260 --> 02:02:15,980
I don't understand.

1494
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:22,220
Well, we've called off our engagement,
you see, and--

1495
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:25,780
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Yes. You are?

1496
02:02:26,860 --> 02:02:28,980
-You did?
-Yes.

1497
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:34,380
Well, you can't marry someone
when you're. . .

1498
02:02:36,780 --> 02:02:38,780
. . .in love with someone else. . .

1499
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,420
. . .can you?

1500
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:19,060
The Reverend Mother always says:

1501
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:22,580
"When the Lord closes a door,
somewhere He opens a window. "

1502
02:03:30,620 --> 02:03:33,580
What else does
the Reverend Mother say?

1503
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,780
That you have to look for your life.

1504
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:40,780
Is that why you came back?

1505
02:03:44,660 --> 02:03:46,100
And have you found it. . .

1506
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,180
. . .Maria?

1507
02:03:49,860 --> 02:03:51,780
I think I have.

1508
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:55,740
I know I have.

1509
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:59,780
I love you.

1510
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:05,980
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1511
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:13,780
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

1512
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:20,260
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

1513
02:04:22,060 --> 02:04:27,700
But somewhere
ln my wicked, miserable past

1514
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:33,780
There must have been a moment of truth

1515
02:04:34,660 --> 02:04:41,180
For here you are
Standing there loving me

1516
02:04:41,860 --> 02:04:47,660
Whether or not you should

1517
02:04:48,260 --> 02:04:54,780
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1518
02:04:55,580 --> 02:05:02,940
I must have done something good

1519
02:05:04,140 --> 02:05:06,980
Nothing comes from nothing

1520
02:05:08,060 --> 02:05:11,740
Nothing ever could

1521
02:05:12,580 --> 02:05:21,100
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1522
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:31,660
I must have done something good

1523
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:37,180
Do you know when I first
started loving you?

1524
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:41,300
That night at dinner, when you sat
on that ridiculous pine cone.

1525
02:05:41,540 --> 02:05:42,780
What?

1526
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:47,380
I knew the first time you blew
that silly whistle.

1527
02:05:48,260 --> 02:05:50,180
Oh, my love.

1528
02:05:53,780 --> 02:06:01,380
For here you are
Standing there loving me

1529
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:08,820
Whether or not you should

1530
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:16,940
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1531
02:06:17,660 --> 02:06:25,100
I must have done something good

1532
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:29,580
Nothing comes from nothing

1533
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:33,180
Nothing ever could

1534
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:38,980
So somewhere in my youth...

1535
02:06:39,220 --> 02:06:41,380
...or childhood

1536
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:50,620
I must have done something

1537
02:06:52,580 --> 02:07:04,700
Something good

1538
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:12,580
Maria.

1539
02:07:14,380 --> 02:07:18,780
Is there anyone I should go to,
to ask permission to marry you?

1540
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,980
-Why don't we ask--
-The children?

1541
02:09:09,060 --> 02:09:12,900
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

1542
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:17,260
How do you catch a cloud
And pin it down?

1543
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:22,180
How do you find a word
That means Maria?

1544
02:09:22,540 --> 02:09:23,540
A flibbertigibbet

1545
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:26,900
A will-o '-the-wisp
A clown

1546
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:31,460
Many a thing you know
You'd like to tell her

1547
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:35,780
Many a thing she ought to understand

1548
02:09:36,460 --> 02:09:40,580
But how do you make her stay
And listen to all you say?

1549
02:09:40,980 --> 02:09:44,700
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

1550
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:49,820
Oh, how do you solve
A problem like Maria?

1551
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:56,540
How do you hold a moonbeam
ln your hand?

1552
02:11:57,460 --> 02:11:58,980
Herr Detweiler!

1553
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:04,020
-Heil Hitler.
-Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.

1554
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:07,420
Perhaps you've not heard.
I am now the Gauleiter.

1555
02:12:07,660 --> 02:12:09,180
Heil Hitler.

1556
02:12:10,060 --> 02:12:11,180
Heil Hitler.

1557
02:12:11,420 --> 02:12:13,620
I've come from
Captain von Trapp's house.

1558
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:17,500
The only one in the area
not flying the Third Reich flag. . .

1559
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,900
. . .since the Anschluss.

1560
02:12:19,140 --> 02:12:21,220
-But we have dealt with that.
-I don't--

1561
02:12:21,460 --> 02:12:24,300
The housekeeper told me
that I would find you here.

1562
02:12:24,540 --> 02:12:26,180
The only thing she'd tell me.

1563
02:12:26,660 --> 02:12:29,100
What kind of information
are you looking for?

1564
02:12:29,340 --> 02:12:31,140
When will the captain return?

1565
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:35,420
Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.
He's not been in touch with us.

1566
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:40,300
Am I to believe he hasn't communicated
with his children in over a month?

1567
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:42,380
How many men do you know. . .

1568
02:12:42,620 --> 02:12:45,780
. . .who communicate with their children
while honeymooning?

1569
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:50,220
Upon his return, he'll fill
his proper position in the new order.

1570
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:52,780
Naturally.
And may I congratulate you. . .

1571
02:12:53,020 --> 02:12:57,460
. . .and your people in allowing the
festival to go on tonight as planned.

1572
02:12:57,980 --> 02:13:01,300
Why should it not go on?
Nothing in Austria has changed.

1573
02:13:01,540 --> 02:13:04,780
Singing and music will
show this to the world.

1574
02:13:04,980 --> 02:13:06,580
Austria is the same.

1575
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:08,780
Heil Hitler.

1576
02:13:10,860 --> 02:13:12,380
Heil Hitler.

1577
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,180
Come, let's go home.

1578
02:13:15,380 --> 02:13:18,740
-Why was he so cross?
-Everybody's cross these days.

1579
02:13:18,940 --> 02:13:22,180
Maybe the flag with the black spider
makes people nervous.

1580
02:13:22,380 --> 02:13:25,180
-Will Father be in trouble?
-He doesn't have to be.

1581
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:28,020
The thing to do
is to get along with everybody.

1582
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:30,380
Remember that tonight at the concert.

1583
02:13:30,580 --> 02:13:33,380
Are we really going to sing
before a lot of people?

1584
02:13:33,580 --> 02:13:35,580
Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:

1585
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:40,180
Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,
Kurt, Marta and Gretl.

1586
02:13:40,380 --> 02:13:44,580
-Why am I always last?
-Because you are the most important.

1587
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:46,780
There we go.

1588
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:55,780
Are you sure Father will approve
of our singing in public?

1589
02:13:55,980 --> 02:13:58,180
He'll be pleased and proud.

1590
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:00,980
-Liesl, do you think so?
-Don't you trust me?

1591
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:02,180
No.

1592
02:14:02,380 --> 02:14:04,380
You're a very intelligent girl.

1593
02:14:04,860 --> 02:14:06,980
Liesl. Liesl!

1594
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:09,020
Rolf!

1595
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,900
I'm so glad to see you.
It's been su--

1596
02:14:12,140 --> 02:14:13,180
Good afternoon.

1597
02:14:13,580 --> 02:14:16,380
Give this to your father
as soon as he's home.

1598
02:14:17,020 --> 02:14:18,820
-He's on his honeymoon.
-I know.

1599
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:22,220
-You do?
-We make it our business to know all.

1600
02:14:22,860 --> 02:14:25,380
-Who's "we"?
-See that he gets it.

1601
02:14:25,580 --> 02:14:27,780
-What is it?
-It's a telegram from Berlin.

1602
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:31,020
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1603
02:14:31,460 --> 02:14:33,980
I'm occupied
with more important matters.

1604
02:14:34,180 --> 02:14:36,580
And your father had better be too.

1605
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:38,260
But, Rolf!

1606
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,020
Father!

1607
02:15:02,260 --> 02:15:04,820
-We didn't expect you so soon.
-Hello, hello!

1608
02:15:05,060 --> 02:15:07,740
We didn't expect you home
until next week!

1609
02:15:07,940 --> 02:15:13,140
-Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?
-Hello! How are you?

1610
02:15:14,220 --> 02:15:15,460
Why didn't you call us?

1611
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:17,500
We couldn't get through.

1612
02:15:17,740 --> 02:15:19,620
I had nothing to do with that.

1613
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:21,820
We came back as fast as we could.

1614
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:24,220
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1615
02:15:24,460 --> 02:15:26,780
-We missed you!
-We missed kissing you.

1616
02:15:26,980 --> 02:15:29,700
We missed all the noise
in the morning.

1617
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:33,980
-Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.
-Oh, you came back just in time.

1618
02:15:34,180 --> 02:15:35,820
Look, Fräulein Maria--

1619
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:37,580
I mean Mother.

1620
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:40,420
We're going to sing
in the festival tonight.

1621
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:42,620
We've been having a lovely time!

1622
02:15:42,860 --> 02:15:44,860
We've been rehearsing all--

1623
02:15:46,340 --> 02:15:48,580
Surprise! Surprise!

1624
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:51,580
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1625
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:55,820
We'll talk about this.

1626
02:15:56,060 --> 02:16:00,180
I would've told you but you were away.
I had to make a last-minute decision.

1627
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:02,820
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1628
02:16:03,060 --> 02:16:07,580
They'll be the talk of the festival.
Imagine, seven children in one family!

1629
02:16:07,780 --> 02:16:09,380
Max!

1630
02:16:09,940 --> 02:16:12,660
Somehow I recall having made it
quite clear to you. . .

1631
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:15,500
. . .how I feel about my family
singing in public!

1632
02:16:15,740 --> 02:16:17,380
The committee was enchanted.

1633
02:16:17,580 --> 02:16:20,620
-What did they say?
-I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1634
02:16:20,860 --> 02:16:24,980
-Don't you think just this once--?
-Absolutely out of the question.

1635
02:16:25,220 --> 02:16:29,180
-Georg, this is for Austria.
-For Austria?

1636
02:16:29,540 --> 02:16:32,620
-There is no Austria!
-But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1637
02:16:32,860 --> 02:16:36,220
-Let's at least be grateful for that.
-Grateful?

1638
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:39,580
You know, Max. . .

1639
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:43,540
. . .sometimes I don't believe
I know you.

1640
02:16:46,140 --> 02:16:47,460
Father, I forgot.

1641
02:16:48,260 --> 02:16:49,780
This is for you.

1642
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:03,020
Maria, he has got to at least pretend
to work with these people.

1643
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:04,700
You must convince him.

1644
02:17:04,940 --> 02:17:07,580
Max, I can't ask him
to be less than he is.

1645
02:17:07,780 --> 02:17:10,980
Then I'll talk to him.
If the children don't sing, well. . .

1646
02:17:11,220 --> 02:17:13,380
. . .it will be a reflection
on Austria.

1647
02:17:14,140 --> 02:17:17,380
Oh, I know.
It wouldn't do me any good either.

1648
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:24,900
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1649
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:27,780
-I like calling you "Mother. "
-I like hearing it.

1650
02:17:27,980 --> 02:17:31,500
You love Father very much.
I can tell you do.

1651
02:17:31,660 --> 02:17:32,500
Very much.

1652
02:17:32,740 --> 02:17:35,940
Mother, what do you do when you
think you love someone?

1653
02:17:36,580 --> 02:17:41,660
I mean, when you stop loving someone
or he stops loving you?

1654
02:17:44,180 --> 02:17:46,180
Well, you cry a little.

1655
02:17:46,580 --> 02:17:48,620
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1656
02:17:48,860 --> 02:17:50,180
It always does.

1657
02:17:50,420 --> 02:17:53,820
There are so many things I think
I should know but I don't.

1658
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:55,940
-I really don't.
-How can you?

1659
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:58,300
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1660
02:17:58,540 --> 02:18:01,580
-Then you feel it's just beginning?
-Yes!

1661
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:05,900
It was that way with me. And for you
it will be just as wonderful.

1662
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:08,340
Do you really think so?

1663
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:13,020
When you're 16 going on 17

1664
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:16,700
Waiting for life to start

1665
02:18:17,340 --> 02:18:21,020
Somebody kind
Who touches your mind

1666
02:18:21,260 --> 02:18:25,380
Will suddenly touch your heart

1667
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:27,420
When that happens

1668
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:29,700
After it happens

1669
02:18:29,940 --> 02:18:33,620
Nothing is quite the same

1670
02:18:33,860 --> 02:18:35,380
Somehow I know

1671
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:37,700
I'll jump up and go

1672
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:42,020
If ever he calls my name

1673
02:18:42,260 --> 02:18:46,020
Gone are your old ideas of life

1674
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:50,300
The old ideas grow dim

1675
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:54,700
Lo and behold
You're someone's wife

1676
02:18:55,660 --> 02:19:01,420
And you belong to him

1677
02:19:01,660 --> 02:19:05,780
You may think this kind of adventure

1678
02:19:06,020 --> 02:19:09,740
Never may come to you

1679
02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:15,940
Darling, 16 going on 17

1680
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:20,700
Wait a year...

1681
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:26,500
-I'll wait a year
-...or two

1682
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:33,900
Just wait a year...

1683
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:43,060
...or two

1684
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:46,860
Liesl.

1685
02:20:02,660 --> 02:20:03,980
What is it?

1686
02:20:04,860 --> 02:20:06,180
Berlin.

1687
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:08,420
They've offered me a commission.

1688
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:11,100
I've been requested
to accept immediately. . .

1689
02:20:11,340 --> 02:20:15,180
. . .and report to their naval base
at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1690
02:20:15,740 --> 02:20:19,580
I knew this would happen.
I didn't think it would be so soon.

1691
02:20:19,780 --> 02:20:23,180
To refuse them would be fatal
for all of us.

1692
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:27,980
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1693
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:35,580
Get the children all together.

1694
02:20:35,860 --> 02:20:38,980
Don't say anything to worry them.
Just get them ready.

1695
02:20:39,860 --> 02:20:42,180
We've got to get out of Austria. . .

1696
02:20:43,740 --> 02:20:45,380
. . .and this house. . .

1697
02:20:47,620 --> 02:20:48,980
. . .tonight.

1698
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:33,420
This strains my back
and breaks my heart. . .

1699
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,380
. . .when I think of the children
missing the festival.

1700
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:39,220
By your announcement
we'll be over the border.

1701
02:21:39,460 --> 02:21:41,780
Do you appreciate
the sacrifice I'm making?

1702
02:21:41,980 --> 02:21:43,220
You have no choice.

1703
02:21:43,460 --> 02:21:46,180
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1704
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:48,900
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1705
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:52,380
Because he doesn't want anyone
to hear us.

1706
02:21:55,820 --> 02:21:58,220
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1707
02:21:58,460 --> 02:22:01,820
They'll be able to answer honestly
they didn't know anything.

1708
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:06,100
-Will we be coming back here?
-Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1709
02:22:06,340 --> 02:22:11,060
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push
the car all the way to Switzerland?

1710
02:22:36,740 --> 02:22:39,060
Something wrong
with your car, captain?

1711
02:22:39,380 --> 02:22:41,580
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1712
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:46,380
Karl.

1713
02:22:48,260 --> 02:22:51,580
Fix Captain von Trapp's car
so that it will start.

1714
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:15,580
Excellent, Karl.

1715
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:21,820
I've not asked you where you
and your family are going.

1716
02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:24,380
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1717
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:28,180
Apparently we both suffer
from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1718
02:23:29,020 --> 02:23:31,380
You never answered the telegram. . .

1719
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:34,780
. . .from the Admiral of the Navy
of the Third Reich.

1720
02:23:35,020 --> 02:23:37,380
I was under the impression,
Herr Zeller. . .

1721
02:23:37,580 --> 02:23:40,980
. . .that the contents of telegrams
in Austria are private!

1722
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:45,060
At least, the Austria I know.

1723
02:23:46,140 --> 02:23:47,700
I have my orders. . .

1724
02:23:47,940 --> 02:23:50,020
. . .to take you
to Bremerhaven tonight. . .

1725
02:23:50,260 --> 02:23:52,380
. . .where you will accept
your commission.

1726
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:58,660
I'm afraid that's going to be
quite impossible.

1727
02:23:59,260 --> 02:24:00,900
You see, we. . .

1728
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:04,180
. . .all of us, the entire family,
will be. . .

1729
02:24:05,220 --> 02:24:07,180
. . .singing in the festival tonight.

1730
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:09,780
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1731
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:13,180
We couldn't possibly
let them down now.

1732
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:16,220
-I just hope we're not too late.
-Yes.

1733
02:24:16,460 --> 02:24:19,220
You ask me to believe that you,
Captain von Trapp. . .

1734
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:20,860
. . .are singing in a concert?

1735
02:24:21,260 --> 02:24:25,220
Believe me, it will be a performance
beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1736
02:24:25,540 --> 02:24:30,020
Like you, Herr Zeller,
l, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1737
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,980
Yes.

1738
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:34,580
Here, program.

1739
02:24:39,420 --> 02:24:41,620
It says only the names
of the children.

1740
02:24:41,860 --> 02:24:45,020
It says
the von Trapp Family Singers. . .

1741
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:48,180
. . .and I am the head of
the von Trapp family, am I not?

1742
02:24:50,380 --> 02:24:54,020
And these travel clothes
that you're all wearing?

1743
02:24:54,820 --> 02:24:56,300
Our costumes, naturally.

1744
02:24:56,540 --> 02:24:59,780
This night air is not good
for the children's voices.

1745
02:25:05,780 --> 02:25:09,180
Well, a slight delay in my orders
will not be serious.

1746
02:25:10,340 --> 02:25:11,780
Therefore. . .

1747
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:14,180
. . .you will sing.

1748
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:16,980
You will all sing.

1749
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:19,780
But only because that's what I want.

1750
02:25:20,620 --> 02:25:23,980
It will demonstrate that nothing
in Austria has changed.

1751
02:25:24,660 --> 02:25:26,780
And when you have finished singing. . .

1752
02:25:27,060 --> 02:25:30,100
. . .you, Captain von Trapp, will be
taken to Bremerhaven.

1753
02:25:31,340 --> 02:25:33,980
Now, if you will all get
into your car. . .

1754
02:25:34,180 --> 02:25:37,820
. . .we will escort the von Trapp Family
Singers to the festival.

1755
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:40,780
No escort will be necessary.

1756
02:25:41,020 --> 02:25:43,380
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1757
02:25:44,260 --> 02:25:47,980
After all, we would not want you
to get lost in the crowds.

1758
02:25:49,140 --> 02:25:50,580
Would we?

1759
02:25:51,220 --> 02:25:52,340
No.

1760
02:26:07,820 --> 02:26:10,940
Sew, a needle pulling thread

1761
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:14,220
La, a note to follow sew

1762
02:26:14,460 --> 02:26:17,780
Tea, a drink with jam and bread

1763
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:21,620
A drink with jam and bread

1764
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:32,860
Tea with jam
Jam and bread

1765
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:41,740
-With jam
-A, B, C

1766
02:26:41,940 --> 02:26:45,060
-With jam
-Do-re-mi

1767
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:48,700
Tea with jam and bread

1768
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:50,220
With jam and bread

1769
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:51,940
With jam
With jam...

1770
02:26:52,140 --> 02:27:00,580
...and bread

1771
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:24,660
My fellow Austrians. . .

1772
02:27:25,940 --> 02:27:30,260
. . .I shall not be seeing you again,
perhaps for a very long time.

1773
02:27:31,620 --> 02:27:33,340
I would like to sing for you now. . .

1774
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:36,260
. . .a love song.

1775
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,260
I know you share this love.

1776
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:45,060
I pray that you will never let it die.

1777
02:27:57,300 --> 02:28:00,660
Edelweiss

1778
02:28:00,860 --> 02:28:03,980
Edelweiss

1779
02:28:04,220 --> 02:28:09,700
Every morning you greet me

1780
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:13,060
Small and white

1781
02:28:13,300 --> 02:28:15,980
Clean and bright

1782
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:21,420
You look happy to meet me

1783
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:24,100
Blossom of snow

1784
02:28:24,340 --> 02:28:27,780
May you bloom and grow

1785
02:28:28,020 --> 02:28:33,460
Bloom and grow forever

1786
02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:37,300
Edelweiss

1787
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:40,060
Edelweiss

1788
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:46,020
Bless my homeland forever

1789
02:28:50,340 --> 02:28:53,300
Edelweiss

1790
02:28:53,540 --> 02:28:54,820
Edel....

1791
02:29:01,900 --> 02:29:04,860
Small and white

1792
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:07,780
Clean and bright

1793
02:29:08,020 --> 02:29:13,140
You look happy to meet me

1794
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:15,820
Blossom of snow

1795
02:29:16,020 --> 02:29:19,300
May you bloom and grow

1796
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:25,660
Bloom and grow forever

1797
02:29:26,140 --> 02:29:28,900
Edelweiss

1798
02:29:29,220 --> 02:29:31,820
Edelweiss

1799
02:29:32,460 --> 02:29:40,340
Bless my homeland forever

1800
02:29:57,340 --> 02:29:58,860
I think it'll work.

1801
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:01,260
I shall miss all of you.

1802
02:30:01,700 --> 02:30:04,060
I shall miss the money
I could have made with you.

1803
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:08,780
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1804
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:12,100
The competition has come
to its conclusion. . .

1805
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:15,340
. . .except, we don't know
yet what that conclusion will be.

1806
02:30:16,260 --> 02:30:18,700
And while the judges
arrive at their decision. . .

1807
02:30:18,940 --> 02:30:21,860
. . .I have been given permission
to offer you an encore.

1808
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:25,180
This will be the last opportunity
the von Trapps will have. . .

1809
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:27,700
. . .of singing together
for a long, long time.

1810
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:32,580
Even now, officials are waiting
in this auditorium. . .

1811
02:30:32,820 --> 02:30:35,420
. . .to escort Captain von Trapp
to his new command. . .

1812
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:39,060
. . .in the naval forces
of the Third Reich.

1813
02:30:43,540 --> 02:30:47,860
And so, ladies and gentlemen,
the family von Trapp again. . .

1814
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:50,700
. . .to bid you farewell.

1815
02:30:57,620 --> 02:31:01,100
There's a sad sort of clanging
From the clock in the hall

1816
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:04,540
And the bells in the steeple too

1817
02:31:05,020 --> 02:31:08,700
And up in the nursery
An absurd little bird

1818
02:31:08,940 --> 02:31:11,260
Is popping out to say "coo-coo"

1819
02:31:11,460 --> 02:31:13,060
Coo-coo

1820
02:31:13,300 --> 02:31:14,260
Coo-coo

1821
02:31:14,500 --> 02:31:16,060
Regretfully they tell us

1822
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:17,980
But firmly they compel us

1823
02:31:18,220 --> 02:31:20,860
To say goodbye

1824
02:31:21,060 --> 02:31:26,020
To you

1825
02:31:28,820 --> 02:31:32,260
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1826
02:31:32,500 --> 02:31:36,100
We hate to go
And miss this pretty sight

1827
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:45,460
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1828
02:31:45,660 --> 02:31:49,180
Adieu, adieu
To you and you and you

1829
02:31:55,220 --> 02:31:58,660
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1830
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:00,460
We flit, we float

1831
02:32:00,660 --> 02:32:02,300
We fleetly flee, we fly

1832
02:32:08,420 --> 02:32:12,060
So long, farewell
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1833
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:15,500
The sun has gone to bed
And so must I

1834
02:32:15,740 --> 02:32:19,380
Goodbye

1835
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:25,100
Goodbye

1836
02:32:25,300 --> 02:32:30,300
Goodbye

1837
02:32:30,540 --> 02:32:37,420
Goodbye

1838
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:11,860
Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the
decision of our distinguished judges.

1839
02:33:12,060 --> 02:33:14,540
We will start with the award
for third prize.

1840
02:33:15,140 --> 02:33:17,380
For this honor,
the judges have named. . .

1841
02:33:17,620 --> 02:33:22,060
. . .the first soloist of the choir
of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.

1842
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:24,460
Fräulein Schweiger.

1843
02:33:59,820 --> 02:34:03,620
Second prize
to The Toby Reiser Quintet.

1844
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:34,460
And the first prize,
the highest honor in all Austria. . .

1845
02:34:34,700 --> 02:34:37,660
. . .the von Trapp Family Singers.

1846
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:51,140
The family von Trapp.

1847
02:35:05,140 --> 02:35:06,180
They're gone!

1848
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,460
Come with me.

1849
02:35:29,140 --> 02:35:31,060
Quickly, quickly.

1850
02:35:31,940 --> 02:35:34,060
I have a place you can hide.

1851
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:37,860
Slowly, slowly.

1852
02:35:48,420 --> 02:35:50,060
Open this gate.

1853
02:35:51,140 --> 02:35:52,660
Good evening.

1854
02:35:55,060 --> 02:35:56,460
Hurry up, woman.

1855
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:16,660
Two men in there.

1856
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:18,660
Six of you cover the yard.

1857
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:21,060
You two, cover the corridor.

1858
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:38,380
Reverend Mother, we didn't realize
we put the abbey in this danger.

1859
02:36:38,620 --> 02:36:41,060
No, Maria, it was right for you
to come here.

1860
02:36:41,260 --> 02:36:43,060
We thought we might borrow
your car.

1861
02:36:43,260 --> 02:36:45,100
I'm afraid our car will do you
no good now.

1862
02:36:45,660 --> 02:36:47,260
I've been listening to the wires.

1863
02:36:47,460 --> 02:36:49,860
The borders have just been closed.

1864
02:36:55,500 --> 02:36:57,660
All right,
if the borders are closed. . .

1865
02:36:58,900 --> 02:37:02,100
. . .then we'll drive up into the hills
and go over the mountains on foot.

1866
02:37:02,660 --> 02:37:04,580
-The children--
-We'll help them.

1867
02:37:04,820 --> 02:37:06,900
We can do it without help, Father.

1868
02:37:07,940 --> 02:37:09,260
Maria.

1869
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:12,460
You will not be alone.
Remember:

1870
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:15,620
"I will lift up mine eyes unto
the hills from whence cometh my help. "

1871
02:37:16,580 --> 02:37:17,620
Yes, Mother.

1872
02:37:18,940 --> 02:37:21,020
-I'm scared.
-Me too.

1873
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:33,740
God be with you.

1874
02:37:40,380 --> 02:37:41,860
-Mother.
-Yes?

1875
02:37:42,100 --> 02:37:45,180
Would it help if we sang
about our favorite things?

1876
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:48,300
No, darling.
This is one time it would not help.

1877
02:37:48,540 --> 02:37:51,620
You must be very quiet.
Hold tight to me.

1878
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:01,900
Let's try the roof.

1879
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:58,060
Rolf, please.

1880
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:04,380
No, wait.

1881
02:41:13,740 --> 02:41:15,060
Maria.

1882
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:17,460
Children.

1883
02:41:21,340 --> 02:41:24,260
It's you we want, not them.

1884
02:41:24,620 --> 02:41:26,260
Put that down.

1885
02:41:27,300 --> 02:41:30,460
Not another move,
or I'll shoot.

1886
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:34,060
You're only a boy.

1887
02:41:36,940 --> 02:41:40,460
-You don't really belong to them.
-Stay where you are.

1888
02:41:42,140 --> 02:41:44,060
Come away with us.

1889
02:41:45,260 --> 02:41:46,380
Before it's too late.

1890
02:41:46,940 --> 02:41:49,180
Not another step.
I'll kill you.

1891
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:54,540
-You give that to me, Rolf.
-Did you hear me?

1892
02:41:55,540 --> 02:41:57,060
I'll kill you.

1893
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:00,260
Rolf.

1894
02:42:17,860 --> 02:42:19,180
You'll never be one of them.

1895
02:42:21,820 --> 02:42:23,460
Lieutenant!

1896
02:42:23,700 --> 02:42:24,780
They're here!

1897
02:42:24,980 --> 02:42:26,460
They're here, lieutenant!

1898
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:07,660
Reverend Mother.

1899
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:10,660
I have sinned.

1900
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:13,860
I too, Reverend Mother.

1901
02:43:15,460 --> 02:43:17,660
What is this sin, my children?
