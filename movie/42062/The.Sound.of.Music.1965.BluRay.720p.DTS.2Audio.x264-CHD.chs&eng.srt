1
00:00:01,011 --> 00:00:21,011
【音乐之声】
The Sound of Music - 1965

2
00:02:44,012 --> 00:02:46,742
群山因为音乐…
The hills are alive

3
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:51,418
充满生气
With the sound of music

4
00:02:51,687 --> 00:02:54,121
唱了…
With songs they have sung

5
00:02:54,423 --> 00:02:59,258
千年的歌
For a thousand years

6
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:02,691
群山让我的心中…
The hills fill my heart

7
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:07,459
充满了音乐
With the sound of music

8
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:14,904
要唱出每支歌
My heart wants to sing Every song it hears

9
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,279
我心震荡像鸟儿翅膀
My heart wants to beat like the wings Of the birds that rise

10
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,609
由湖边飞上树
From the lake to the trees

11
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:28,119
我心叹息
My heart wants to sigh Like a chime that flies

12
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:32,326
像钟声飘扬
From a church on a breeze

13
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:36,086
笑声像小溪流过石头
To laugh like a brook When it trips and falls

14
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:39,823
跌荡抑扬
Over stones on its way

15
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:43,970
夜晚歌唱
To sing through the night

16
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,005
像云雀祈祷
Like a lark who is learning to pray

17
00:03:48,343 --> 00:03:53,975
当我奔向山里
I go to the hills

18
00:03:54,182 --> 00:04:00,348
心情落寞
When my heart is lonely

19
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:04,490
我听到…
I know I will hear

20
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:09,187
昔日歌声
What I've heard before

21
00:04:09,464 --> 00:04:14,197
我心就会歌唱
My heart will be blessed

22
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:22,207
因为音乐的响起
With the sound of music

23
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:28,443
我要再度…
And I'll sing...

24
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:37,615
歌唱
...once more

25
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:24,634
哈利路亚，哈利路亚
Hallelujah, hallelujah

26
00:09:24,913 --> 00:09:29,577
哈利路亚，哈利路亚
Hallelujah, hallelujah

27
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,845
-院长 -柏尼丝修女
- Reverend Mother. - Sister Bernice.

28
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,717
-我找不到她 -犸莉亚？
- I simply cannot find her. - Maria?

29
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,089
她又不见了
She's missing again.

30
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,394
也许我们该在她脖子上 挂个牛铃
We should've put a cowbell around her neck.

31
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,691
你找过仓了吗？ 她很喜欢动物
Have you tried the barn? You know how much she adores the animals.

32
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:48,697
我到处都找过了
I have looked everywhere. In all of the usual places.

33
00:09:48,903 --> 00:09:51,133
修女，你要知道她是莉亚…
Sister, considering it's Maria...

34
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:54,033
我建议你找不寻常的地方
...I suggest you look in someplace unusual.

35
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:00,611
院长…
Well, Reverend Mother...

36
00:10:00,882 --> 00:10:03,442
我希望这次违规 会结束
...I hope this new infraction ends whatever doubts...

37
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:06,949
你对她在这里 会有未来的疑虑
...you may still have about Maria's future here.

38
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:11,216
我对疑虑仍常保持信心
I always try to keep faith in my doubts, Sister Berthe.

39
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:14,326
毕竟黑羊的毛也是会温暖
After all, the wool of a black sheep is just as warm.

40
00:10:14,562 --> 00:10:18,896
我们不是争论绵羊颜色
We are not talking about sheep, black or white, Sister Margaretta.

41
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:22,570
所有修女的候选人中她最糟
Of all the candidates for the novitiate, Maria is the least...

42
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,328
各位…
Children, children.

43
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:29,766
我们想了解在修道院的各人 表现如何
We were speculating about the qualifications of our postulants.

44
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:33,404
见习修女和修道院修女的主管
The Mistress of Novices and the Mistress of Postulants...

45
00:10:33,648 --> 00:10:38,950
表达了不同的意见来协助我
...were trying to help me by expressing opposite points of view.

46
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:42,247
凯萨琳修女，告诉我 你认为犸莉亚如何？
Tell me, Sister Catherine, what do you think of Maria?

47
00:10:42,457 --> 00:10:45,517
她有时候是个好女孩
She's a wonderful girl, some of the time.

48
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,588
-雅嘉佛修女？ -犸莉亚讨人喜欢
- Sister Agatha? - It's very easy to like Maria...

49
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,356
但有时候却不易相处
...except when it's difficult.

50
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:56,228
-苏菲亚修女，你呢？ -我喜欢她
- And you, Sister Sophia? - Oh, I love her very dearly.

51
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,373
但她爱惹麻烦
But she always seems to be in trouble, doesn't she?

52
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,199
这就是我要说的
Exactly what I say.

53
00:11:01,676 --> 00:11:04,144
她会爬树伤了膝盖
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

54
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,041
衣服裂开
Her dress has got a tear

55
00:11:06,715 --> 00:11:10,879
在往弥撒的路上跳华尔兹 在阶梯上吹口哨
She waltzes on her way to Mass And whistles on the stair

56
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,013
帽巾下，头发会卷着发卷
And underneath her wimple She has curlers in her hair

57
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:20,887
她会在修道院内唱歌
I've even heard her singing In the abbey

58
00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:23,120
她上教堂总是迟到
She's always late for chapel

59
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,629
可是悔却出自真心
But her penitence is real

60
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,232
她做什么都迟到
She's always late for everything

61
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,495
但每餐饭从不迟到
Except for every meal

62
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:35,571
我不愿说，但我深深觉得
I hate to have to say it But I very firmly feel

63
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,247
犸莉亚不适合修道院
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

64
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,240
我愿为她说句好话
I'd like to say a word in her behalf

65
00:11:43,518 --> 00:11:44,849
请说，犸格丽特修女
Say it, Sister Margaretta.

66
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,679
犸莉亚令我发笑
Maria makes me laugh

67
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,496
你要如何处理 像犸莉亚这样的问题人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

68
00:11:56,765 --> 00:12:00,565
你要如何摘下浮云 然后钉牢？
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

69
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:04,202
你要如何用言语形容她？
How do you find a word That means Maria?

70
00:12:04,739 --> 00:12:05,831
捣蛋鬼！
A flibbertigibbet

71
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:07,405
-鬼灵精 -小丑
- A will-o'-the-wisp - A clown

72
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,774
许多事你们想告诉她
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

73
00:12:13,047 --> 00:12:16,505
许多事她该明t
Many a thing she ought to understand

74
00:12:16,918 --> 00:12:20,615
但如何使她停下听你说完？
But how do you make her stay And listen to all you say?

75
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:24,681
如何使海浪停留在沙滩上？
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

76
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:29,022
你要如何处理 像犸莉亚这样的问题人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

77
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:35,060
如何使月光在…
How do you hold a moonbeam...

78
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,731
掌中停留？
...in your hand?

79
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,302
当我和她同处就糊涂
When I'm with her I'm confused Out of focus and bemused

80
00:12:45,613 --> 00:12:49,049
茫然不知身在何处
And I never know exactly where I am

81
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,583
-如天气难测 -像羽毛飘忽
- Unpredictable as weather - She's as flighty as a feather

82
00:12:52,954 --> 00:12:54,785
-她很可人 -她是恶魔
- She's a darling - She's a demon

83
00:12:54,989 --> 00:12:56,320
她是羔羊
She's a lamb

84
00:12:56,724 --> 00:13:00,387
她让瘟神烦恼，把黄蜂赶出巢
She'll out pester any pest Drive a hornet from its nest

85
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:03,894
她能使僧侣昏头转向
She can throw a whirling dervish Out of whirl

86
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:07,993
-她本性善良却又狂野 -她是迷一般的孩子
- She is gentle, she is wild - She's a riddle, she's a child

87
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,130
-她令人头痛 -她是天使
- She's a headache - She's an angel

88
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,241
她只是个女孩
She's a girl

89
00:13:15,977 --> 00:13:19,913
你要如何处理 像犸莉亚这样的问题人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

90
00:13:20,148 --> 00:13:23,845
你要如何摘下浮云 然后钉牢？
How do you catch a cloud And pin it down?

91
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:27,644
你要如何用字眼来形容她？
How do you find a word That means Maria?

92
00:13:27,922 --> 00:13:29,913
-捣蛋鬼 -鬼灵精
- A flibbertigibbet - A will-o'-the-wisp

93
00:13:30,158 --> 00:13:31,785
小丑
A clown

94
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,991
许多事你觉得要告诉她
Many a thing you know You'd like to tell her

95
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,756
许多事她应该明t
Many a thing she ought to understand

96
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:44,302
-但如何使她停下 -听你说完？
- But how do you make her stay - And listen to all you say?

97
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,635
如何使海浪停留在沙滩上？
How do you keep a wave upon the sand?

98
00:13:48,843 --> 00:13:54,679
你要如何处理 像犸莉亚这样的问题人物？
How do you solve a problem like Maria?

99
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:17,401
如何使月光在…
How do you hold a moonbeam...

100
00:14:18,306 --> 00:14:24,711
掌中停留？
...in your hand?

101
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,515
你可以进去了，犸莉亚
You may go in now, Maria.

102
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,732
过来吧，孩子
Come here, my child.

103
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:00,612
坐下吧
Now sit down.

104
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:05,110
院长，我真抱歉 我只是无法自制
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself.

105
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:08,355
-山峦在呼唤我… -亲爱的
- The hills were beckoning and before... - Dear.

106
00:15:08,756 --> 00:15:10,724
我不是要你来此道歉的
I haven't summoned you for apologies.

107
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,189
请让我忏悔吧
Please let me ask for forgiveness.

108
00:15:13,861 --> 00:15:15,089
如果会让你好过些的话
If you'll feel better.

109
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,396
是的，今日的天空如此蔚蓝
Yes, you see, the sky was so blue today...

110
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:22,433
万物如此碧绿芬芳 我必须成为其中一份子
...and everything was so green and fragrant, I had to be a part of it.

111
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:27,198
安特斯让我愈爬愈高 好像要我跟它穿过云霄
The Untersberg led me higher like it wanted me to go through the clouds.

112
00:15:27,408 --> 00:15:29,433
万一你在天黑时 迷路怎么办？
Suppose darkness had come and you were lost?

113
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,941
院长，我绝对不会迷路的
Mother, I could never be lost up there.

114
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:35,046
那是我的山，我在那儿长大的
That's my mountain. I was brought up on it.

115
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,547
就是那座山使我来找你的
It was the mountain that led me to you.

116
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,288
小时我常爬山
When I was a child, I would come down and climb a tree...

117
00:15:41,556 --> 00:15:43,319
眺望你的花园
...and look in your garden.

118
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:46,493
看着修女们工作 听着她们晚祷的歌
I'd see the sisters at work and hear them sing.

119
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:51,458
院长，我今天违反规定
Which brings me to another transgression, Reverend Mother.

120
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,827
未得准许唱歌
I was singing out there today.

121
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:58,529
在修道院只禁止见习修女唱歌
Only in the abbey do we have rules about postulants singing.

122
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,765
不论在何处 我似乎都无法停止唱歌
I can't stop wherever I am.

123
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,307
更糟的是 我似乎也无法停止说话
Worse, I can't seem to stop saying things.

124
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:05,842
所有我想的和我的感觉
Everything I think and feel.

125
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,513
有人会认为这是诚实
Some call that "honesty."

126
00:16:07,782 --> 00:16:10,148
但这是很糟糕的，院长
Oh, but it's terrible, Reverend Mother!

127
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:14,253
你知道贝诗修女总在争论之后 要我吻地板
You know how Sister Berthe makes me kiss the floor after a disagreement?

128
00:16:14,622 --> 00:16:18,114
所以现在我看到她来就吻地板 以节省时间
Lately, I kiss the floor when I see her coming to save time.

129
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:21,955
犸莉亚
Maria...

130
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:25,956
当你看到修道院的一切时 想要成为一员
...when you saw us over the wall and longed to be with us...

131
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,933
那并不表示你已经准备好 要过这种生活方式，对不对？
...that didn't mean you were prepared for the way we live here, did it?

132
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,673
不，院长 但我祷告，我努力尝试
No, Mother, but I pray and I try.

133
00:16:34,876 --> 00:16:36,605
我也在学习，我真的要做好
And I am learning. I really am.

134
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:39,506
你在这里学到了 最重要的事是什么？
What is the most important lesson you have learned here?

135
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:43,981
找出上帝的旨意 全心全意地侍奉主
To find out what is the will of God and do it wholeheartedly.

136
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:47,947
犸莉亚
Maria...

137
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,221
似乎是上帝的意旨 你要离开我们
...it seems to be God's will that you leave us.

138
00:16:52,493 --> 00:16:53,983
-离开？ -只是短暂的时间而已
- Leave? - Only for a while.

139
00:16:54,495 --> 00:16:56,827
不，院长，别送我走
No, Mother! Please don't send me away!

140
00:16:57,065 --> 00:17:01,331
这里是我的家，我的家庭 我的生命
This is where I belong. It's my home, my family. It's my life.

141
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:05,029
-你真预备献身上帝？ -我是的
- Are you truly ready for it? - Yes, I am.

142
00:17:05,239 --> 00:17:10,142
或许如果你到外面去看看 就明白我们对你的期望
If you go out into the world for a time, knowing what we expect of you...

143
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:13,141
你就有机会找出 你对你自己的期望
...you will find out if you can expect it of yourself.

144
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:17,647
我知道你期望什么，院长 我相信我可以做得到
I know what you expect, Mother, and I can do it! I promise I can!

145
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:22,417
是的，院长
Yes, Mother.

146
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:26,186
如果是上帝的旨意
If it is God's will.

147
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:33,560
萨尔斯堡有个家庭 需要家庭教师一直到九月
There is a family near Salzburg that needs a governess until September.

148
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,998
-到九月？ -照料七个孩子
- September? - For seven children.

149
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:37,660
七个孩子？！
Seven children?!

150
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:39,167
你喜欢孩子吗？
Do you like children?

151
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,772
是的，但七个…
Well, yes, but seven!

152
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,073
我会告诉范崔普舰长 你明天去
I will tell Captain von Trapp to expect you tomorrow.

153
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,013
舰长？
Captain?

154
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:53,551
他是皇家海军的退役军官 人很好又很勇敢
A retired officer of the Imperial Navy. A fine man and a brave one.

155
00:17:53,788 --> 00:17:56,518
他太太数年前去世 留下那些孩子给他
His wife died, and he is alone with the children.

156
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:01,024
我明白他要留住那些家庭教师 会有些困难
I understand he has had a difficult time keeping a governess there.

157
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:04,094
为何会有困难，院长？
Why difficult, Reverend Mother?

158
00:18:05,466 --> 00:18:08,401
在适当的时机 上帝会让你明白的
The Lord will show you in His own good time.

159
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:47,741
当主关上门时
When the Lord closes a door...

160
00:18:47,942 --> 00:18:50,467
他会在某处打开窗子的
...somewhere He opens a window.

161
00:18:52,814 --> 00:18:57,808
这天会是如何？
What will this day be like?

162
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:00,249
我怀疑
I wonder

163
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:10,857
我的未来呢？
What will my future be?

164
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,963
我怀疑
I wonder

165
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:18,630
外边的自由逍遥世界
It could be so exciting

166
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,934
应该令人兴奋
To be out in the world To be free

167
00:19:22,143 --> 00:19:25,203
我的心该狂欢愉悦
My heart should be wildly rejoicing

168
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,716
我到底是怎么回事？
Oh, what's the matter with me?

169
00:19:32,053 --> 00:19:35,113
我一向渴望着冒险
I've always longed for adventure

170
00:19:35,389 --> 00:19:38,950
做我不敢做的事
To do the things I've never dared

171
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:42,390
现在我面对着冒险
Now here I'm facing adventure

172
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:48,795
为何我如此害怕？
Then why am I so scared?

173
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,141
一位舰长和七位孩子
A captain with seven children

174
00:19:55,376 --> 00:19:58,209
有何可怕？
What's so fearsome about that?

175
00:20:00,748 --> 00:20:03,376
我必须停止多疑和忧虑
I must stop these doubts and worries

176
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:06,484
不然，我会回到原点
If I don't I just know I'll turn back

177
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,917
我必须梦想我所追求的事物
I must dream of the things I am seeking

178
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:15,986
我在追求我所欠缺的勇气
I am seeking the courage I lack

179
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:20,732
有勇气信赖他们
The courage to serve them With reliance

180
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,903
虚心面对我的错误
Face my mistakes without defiance

181
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,866
让他们知道我的好处
Show them I'm worthy

182
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,769
同时也让自己看见
And while I show them

183
00:20:29,043 --> 00:20:32,843
自己的好处
I'll show me

184
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:38,451
让他们提出他们的问题
So let them bring on All their problems

185
00:20:38,686 --> 00:20:41,951
我会做得比最好还要更好
I'll do better than my best

186
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:45,283
我有信心，让他们来考验我吧
I have confidence They'll put me to the test

187
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,962
我会让他们明白，我充满信心
But I'll make them see I have confidence in me

188
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:52,461
我要使他们印象深刻
Somehow I will impress them

189
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:55,964
我会坚决而和善
I will be firm but kind

190
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,536
上苍祝福那些孩子们
And all those children Heaven bless them

191
00:20:59,774 --> 00:21:03,073
他们会以我为榜样，听我的话
They will look up to me And mind me

192
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:06,439
每走一步，我更确信
With each step I am more certain

193
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:09,979
一切事情都会好转
Everything will turn out fine

194
00:21:10,217 --> 00:21:13,311
我有信心世界会由我掌握
I have confidence The world can all be mine

195
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:18,992
因为我对自己有信心
They'll have to agree I have confidence in me

196
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:23,291
我对阳光有信心
I have confidence in sunshine

197
00:21:23,564 --> 00:21:26,658
我对雨水有信心
I have confidence in rain

198
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:29,768
我深信春天会再来
I have confidence That spring will come again

199
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:33,097
我对自己更有信心
Besides which you see I have confidence in me

200
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:36,467
力量不存在于数字里
Strength doesn't lie in numbers

201
00:21:36,744 --> 00:21:39,770
力量不存在于财富中
Strength doesn't lie in wealth

202
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:43,347
力量存在于静夜的酣睡中
Strength lies in nights Of peaceful slumbers

203
00:21:43,617 --> 00:21:46,484
当你醒来就充满精神
When you wake up, wake up It's healthy

204
00:21:46,787 --> 00:21:49,779
我信任心中的指引
All I trust I leave my heart to

205
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:52,925
就会成为我的
All I trust becomes my own

206
00:21:53,127 --> 00:21:57,928
我对信心更有信心
I have confidence in confidence alone

207
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,173
救命
Oh, help.

208
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,027
我对信心更有信心
I have confidence in confidence alone

209
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:38,635
况且，你看，我对自己…
Besides which you see I have confidence...

210
00:22:38,906 --> 00:22:45,709
充满信心！
...in me

211
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,653
你好，我来了
Hello. Here I am.

212
00:22:57,491 --> 00:22:59,322
我从修道院来的 我是新的家教，舰长
I'm from the convent. I'm the new governess, captain.

213
00:23:00,995 --> 00:23:04,226
而我是老管家，小姐
And I'm the old butler, fraulein.

214
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,997
你好
Well, how do you do?

215
00:23:18,512 --> 00:23:22,573
请你在此稍候
You'll wait here, please.

216
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:53,032
以后请记住 这里有些房间是不能乱闯的
In future, remember certain rooms in this house are not to be disturbed.

217
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:55,675
是的，舰长，先生
Yes, captain, sir.

218
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:08,850
-你为何如此看着我？ -你看起来一点都不像海上的舰长
- Why do you stare at me that way? - You don't look like a sea captain.

219
00:25:10,057 --> 00:25:13,117
我也认为 你一点都不像个家庭教师
I'm afraid you don't look very much like a governess.

220
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:14,885
-请转身 -什么？
- Turn around. - What?

221
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:16,491
转身
Turn.

222
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:20,827
拿下帽子
Hat off.

223
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,666
你和孩子见面前 最好先换衣服
Put on another dress before meeting the children.

224
00:25:26,974 --> 00:25:28,532
但我没有衣服换了
But I don't have another.

225
00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:31,676
我进入修道院时 将所有衣服送给穷人了
When we enter the abbey, our worldly clothes go to the poor.

226
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:33,174
这一件呢？
What about this one?

227
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,711
穷人不要这一件
The poor didn't want it.

228
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,042
我本想为自己做新衣服的 但时间不够，我会自己做衣服
There wasn't time to make a new dress. I can make clothes.

229
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:43,586
我会确定你有一些布料的
I'll see that you get some material.

230
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,849
今天，如果可能的话
Today, if possible.

231
00:25:46,827 --> 00:25:48,590
-现在…小姐 -莉亚
- Now, fraulein... - Maria.

232
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:51,559
我不知道院长告诉了你多少
I don't know how much the abbess told you.

233
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,392
在许多家教中你是第12位了
You are the twelfth governess...

234
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,070
自从他们的母亲去世后 来此照料他们
...to look after my children since their mother died.

235
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,501
我相信你会比上一个更好
I trust you will be an improvement on the last one.

236
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,571
她只停留了两小时
She stayed only two hours.

237
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:05,871
孩子们有何不对吗？
What's wrong with the children, sir?

238
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:11,751
孩子们都很正常 是家庭教师的错
Nothing is wrong with the children, only the governesses.

239
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:16,956
她们完全无法维持纪律 没有纪律就不能管好这个家
They could not maintain discipline, without which the house cannot be run.

240
00:26:17,891 --> 00:26:19,688
你得督促孩子学习
Drill them in their studies.

241
00:26:19,927 --> 00:26:23,419
我不准他们虚度假期
I will not permit them to dream away their summer holidays.

242
00:26:23,697 --> 00:26:26,393
下午他们要在庭院操练
Each afternoon, they march, breathing deeply.

243
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,261
还要严守就时间
Bedtime is to be strictly observed.

244
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:29,436
请问他们何时玩耍？
When do they play?

245
00:26:29,637 --> 00:26:33,698
你要看着他们 确定他们循规蹈矩
You will see to it that they conduct themselves with the utmost decorum.

246
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:36,876
-我要你负责这一切 -是的，先生
- I am placing you in command. - Yes, sir.

247
00:27:57,524 --> 00:27:58,684
现在…
Now...

248
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:02,228
这位是你们的新家教 犸莉亚小姐
...this is your new governess, Fraulein Maria.

249
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:05,888
当我吹你们的讯号时 你们踏前一步报出名字
Give your name at your signal.

250
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,398
而你要仔细注意那讯号 以便日后召唤他们
Fraulein, listen carefully. Learn their signals so you can call them.

251
00:28:11,705 --> 00:28:13,070
莉莎
Liesl.

252
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,069
费瑞克
Friedrich.

253
00:28:15,342 --> 00:28:16,866
露易莎
Louisa.

254
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:18,406
寇特
Kurt.

255
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:19,703
碧姬塔
Brigitta.

256
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,208
犸塔
Marta.

257
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:28,919
葛特儿
Gretl.

258
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,996
现在看看你的耳力如何
Now, let's see how well you listened.

259
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:39,597
我想我不用哨子的，舰长
I won't need to whistle for them, Reverend Captain.

260
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:43,325
我会叫他们的名字 尤其是有如此美的名字
I mean, I'll use their names. Such lovely names.

261
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:46,700
小姐，这是座大房子 地方很宽广
Fraulein, this is a large house. The grounds are extensive.

262
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,704
而我不容许任何人在此喊叫
And I will not have anyone shouting.

263
00:28:49,943 --> 00:28:51,672
请你拿这个，学习使用它
You will take this, please. Learn to use it.

264
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:53,540
孩子们也会帮你的
The children will help you.

265
00:28:55,582 --> 00:28:59,575
我要找你，你会听到这个讯号
Now, when I want you, this is what you will hear.

266
00:29:00,454 --> 00:29:02,251
不，很抱歉，先生
Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!

267
00:29:03,123 --> 00:29:04,681
我绝不会听哨子回报的
I could never answer to a whistle.

268
00:29:04,892 --> 00:29:07,520
哨子是用来召唤动物的 但绝不是对孩子
Whistles are for animals, not for children.

269
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,854
而且绝对不会是我
And definitely not for me.

270
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,725
这是种很大的侮辱
It would be too humiliating.

271
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:18,733
小姐，你在修道院 也是如此麻烦的吗？
Fraulein, were you this much trouble at the abbey?

272
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,131
麻烦得多，先生
Oh, much more, sir.

273
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,809
我不知道你的讯号
I don't know your signal.

274
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:36,916
你可以叫我舰长
You may call me "captain."

275
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,304
稍息
At ease.

276
00:29:54,107 --> 00:29:55,665
现在只剩下我们
Now that there's just us...

277
00:29:55,943 --> 00:30:00,107
请再一次告诉我你们的名字 还有你们的年龄
...would you please tell me all your names again and how old you are.

278
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:04,574
我叫莉莎，我16岁 我不需要家教
I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old, and I don't need a governess.

279
00:30:05,352 --> 00:30:08,412
莉莎，很高兴你告诉我 我们可以做好朋友
I'm glad you told me, Liesl. We'll just be good friends.

280
00:30:10,591 --> 00:30:14,357
我叫费瑞克，我14岁 我是朽木
I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm impossible.

281
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:16,322
真的？谁告诉你的，费瑞克？
Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?

282
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:20,089
约瑟芬小姐，前四任教师
Fraulein Josephine. Four governesses ago.

283
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:22,001
我叫碧姬塔
I'm Brigitta.

284
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:27,830
你没告诉我你多大，露易莎
You didn't tell me how old you are, Louisa.

285
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,773
我叫碧姬塔，她叫露易莎
I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.

286
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:33,775
她13岁，而你很聪明
She's 13 years old, and you're smart.

287
00:30:34,014 --> 00:30:37,780
我10岁，而我认为你的衣服 是我见过最丑的
I'm 10, and I think your dress is the ugliest one I ever saw.

288
00:30:38,118 --> 00:30:40,746
-碧姬塔，你不该这样说的 -为何？
- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that. - Why not?

289
00:30:40,954 --> 00:30:43,218
-你不认为很丑？ -当然
- Don't you think it's ugly? - Of course.

290
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,186
但赫德小姐才是最丑的
But Fraulein Helga's was ugliest.

291
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,054
我是寇特，11岁，我很任性
I'm Kurt. I'm 11. I'm incorrigible.

292
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:52,457
-恭喜你！ -什么是任性？
- Congratulations. - What's "incorrigible"?

293
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:56,567
那表示你希望 被人当作是小男孩
I think it means you want to be treated like a boy.

294
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:02,038
我是犸塔，星期二我就7岁了
I'm Marta, and I'm going to be seven on Tuesday.

295
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,674
我爱粉红色阳伞
I'd like a pink parasol.

296
00:31:04,878 --> 00:31:06,402
纷红色也是我的颜色
Pink's my favorite color too.

297
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:09,975
是的，你是葛特儿
Yes, you're Gretl.

298
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:12,579
而你已经5岁了？
And you're five years old?

299
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,011
天啊，你几乎快成为淑女了
My, you're practically a lady.

300
00:31:17,524 --> 00:31:20,550
现在我要告诉你们一个秘密 我从未当过家庭教师
I have to tell you a secret. I've never been a governess.

301
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:24,759
你一点也不懂如何当家庭教师？
You don't know anything about being a governess?

302
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:26,397
一点也不懂，我需要许多建议
Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.

303
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:31,895
首先，就是告诉父亲 要他少管闲事
The best way to start is to tell Father to mind his own business.

304
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:33,902
你绝对不能准时来用餐
Never come to dinner on time.

305
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:36,405
喝汤也不要太小声
Never eat your soup quietly.

306
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:39,170
吃甜点时，要擤鼻子
During dessert, always blow your nose.

307
00:31:39,413 --> 00:31:42,211
别听他们说的话，犸莉亚小姐
Don't you believe a word they say, Fraulein Maria.

308
00:31:42,416 --> 00:31:45,783
-为什么？ -因为我喜欢你
- Oh, why not? - Because I like you.

309
00:31:46,587 --> 00:31:48,578
孩子们，出去散步
Children, outside for your walk.

310
00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:50,689
父亲的命令，快点
Father's orders. Hurry up.

311
00:31:50,891 --> 00:31:52,188
快…
Quick, quick, quick.

312
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:55,623
犸莉亚小姐 我是蒙思蜜德，女管家
Fraulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper.

313
00:31:55,862 --> 00:31:56,920
你好
How do you do.

314
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,031
我带你去房间，跟我来
I'll show you to your room. Follow me.

315
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:12,874
可怜的小东西
Poor little dears.

316
00:32:25,592 --> 00:32:29,961
你运气很好 赫德小姐拿到的是条蛇
You're very lucky. With Fraulein Helga it was a snake.

317
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,141
晚安
Good evening.

318
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,141
-晚安，孩子们 -晚安，犸莉亚小姐
- Good evening, children. - Good evening, Fraulein Maria.

319
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:58,984
很独特的举止
Enchanting little ritual.

320
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:01,922
是在修道院学来的吗？
Something you learned at the abbey?

321
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:05,462
不
No.

322
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,362
是风湿
Rheumatism.

323
00:33:18,178 --> 00:33:21,341
对不起，舰长 我们是否忘了向主祷告？
Excuse me, captain. Haven't we forgotten to thank the Lord?

324
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,525
感谢上帝赐给我们一切
For what we receive, may the Lord make us truly thankful.

325
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,994
-阿门 -阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

326
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,467
我要感谢各位
I'd like to thank you all...

327
00:33:41,668 --> 00:33:44,660
今天放在我口袋中的珍贵礼物
...for the precious gift you left in my pocket today.

328
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:49,972
是什么礼物？
What gift?

329
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,241
这是我和孩子们之间的秘密
It's a secret between the children and me.

330
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:59,144
那我建议你就留着 让我们可以吃饭
Then I suggest you keep it, and let us eat.

331
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,487
我了解陌生人在新家庭里
Knowing how nervous I must have been...

332
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:04,156
会是有多么紧张
...a stranger in a new household...

333
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:07,417
了解能被接受 会是多么重要的事
...knowing how important it was for me to feel accepted...

334
00:34:07,694 --> 00:34:11,892
你们使我感到多么温暖
...it was so kind and thoughtful of you to make my first moments here...

335
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:14,360
快乐和…
...so warm and happy...

336
00:34:14,568 --> 00:34:16,331
欢悦
...and pleasant.

337
00:34:25,579 --> 00:34:27,604
-犸塔，你怎么了？ -没事
- What is the matter, Marta? - Nothing.

338
00:34:40,026 --> 00:34:41,050
小姐
Fraulein...

339
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:45,128
是不是每餐饭
...is it to be at every meal or merely at dinnertime...

340
00:34:45,365 --> 00:34:49,927
你都想要让我们
...that you intend leading us through this rare and wonderful new world...

341
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:51,798
消化不良？
...of indigestion?

342
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,240
不，舰长，他们只是很高兴
They're all right, captain. They're just happy.

343
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:17,657
-劳夫，晚安 -晚安，福兰斯
- Rolfe, good evening. - Good evening, Franz.

344
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:20,661
-一切正常吗？ -是的
- I trust everything is under control? - Yes, yes.

345
00:35:22,302 --> 00:35:24,736
-有何进展吗？ -或许
- Are there any developments? - Perhaps.

346
00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:27,099
-舰长在不在？ -他在用晚餐
- Is the captain home? - He's at dinner.

347
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,672
-和他的家人？ -是的
- With the family? - Yes.

348
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,740
请立刻把电报交给他
Give him this telegram at once.

349
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,571
没问题
Certainly.

350
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:46,953
您的电报，先生
A telegram for you, sir.

351
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:51,627
福兰斯，谁送来的？
Franz? Who delivered it?

352
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,957
当然是劳夫了
That young lad Rolfe, of course.

353
00:35:56,303 --> 00:35:58,032
父亲，我能先告退吗？
Father, may I be excused?

354
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:03,465
孩子们，明早我必须去维也纳
Children, in the morning I shall be going to Vienna.

355
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:06,211
怎么又来了，父亲？
Not again, Father!

356
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:12,175
这次你要去多久，父亲？
How long will you be gone this time?

357
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:14,286
我不确定，葛特儿
I'm not sure, Gretl.

358
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:18,048
-是不是去看史蕾特男爵夫人？ -少管闲事
- To visit Baroness Schraeder again? - Mind your own business!

359
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,959
事实上，是的，露易莎
As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.

360
00:36:22,729 --> 00:36:26,563
-为何我们总见不到男爵夫人呢？ -为何她要见你？
- Why can't we ever see the baroness? - Why would she want to see you?

361
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:31,736
你会见到她的 我要带她回来这里，和大家认识
You are going to see the baroness. I'm bringing her back with me to visit.

362
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,037
还有麦斯伯伯
And Uncle Max.

363
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:37,708
麦伯伯
Uncle Max!

364
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,091
劳夫
Rolfe!

365
00:36:58,164 --> 00:36:59,222
哦，劳夫
Oh, Rolfe!

366
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:04,703
-不，莉莎，我们不能 -为何，傻瓜？
- No, Liesl. We mustn't! - Why not, silly?

367
00:37:04,938 --> 00:37:07,600
-我不知道 -你在此不是为了等我吗？
- I don't know... - Isn't this why you're waiting?

368
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,706
是的，当然
Yes, of course.

369
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,708
-我想你，莉莎 -有吗，有多想？
- I've missed you, Liesl. - You have? How much?

370
00:37:12,946 --> 00:37:16,780
好多，我甚至想给你送电报 让我好来此地
I even thought of sending a telegram, so I'd be able to deliver it here.

371
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,952
那是很美好的想法 你为何不做呢？就现在吧
Oh, that's a lovely thought! Why don't you, right now?

372
00:37:21,221 --> 00:37:25,385
-但是我就在此啊 -拜托，劳夫，送给我电报吧
- But I'm here! - Please, Rolfe. Send me a telegram.

373
00:37:25,592 --> 00:37:29,050
我为你起稿：“亲爱的莉莎…”
I'll start it for you. "Dear Liesl..."

374
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:33,358
亲爱的莉莎 我很想要告诉你…
"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able to tell you...

375
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,795
我对你的感觉，完结
...how I feel about you. Stop.

376
00:37:36,036 --> 00:37:40,564
很不幸，电报费用太贵了
Unfortunately, this wire is already too expensive.

377
00:37:40,774 --> 00:37:42,207
真挚的劳夫
Sincerely, Rolfe."

378
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,173
-真挚？ -衷心的
- "Sincerely"? - Cordially.

379
00:37:45,378 --> 00:37:48,040
-衷心的？ -深情的？
- "Cordially"? - Affectionately?

380
00:37:50,417 --> 00:37:52,442
会不会有回电？
Will there be any reply?

381
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,881
亲爱的劳夫，完结
"Dear Rolfe: Stop.

382
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,984
不要完结，你的莉莎
Don't stop! Your Liesl."

383
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:05,562
如果我们不用等别人 给父亲打电报才能见面就好了
If only we didn't have to wait for someone to send Father a telegram.

384
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:08,232
我如何知道何时才能见到你？
How do I know when I'll see you again?

385
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,329
让我想想看
Well, let's see...

386
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,308
我可以因为搞错而来
I could come here by mistake.

387
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:20,939
要给史奈德上校电报 他从柏林来此，停留在…
With a telegram for Colonel Schneider! He's here from Berlin staying with...

388
00:38:21,848 --> 00:38:25,147
没有人知道他在此的 别告诉你父亲
No one knows he's here. Don't tell your father.

389
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,581
-为何不？ -因为你父亲自视为奥地利人
- Why not? - Your father's so Austrian.

390
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:30,085
我们都是奥地利人
We're all Austrian.

391
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:34,693
而那些认为该自视为德国人的 他们不希望这样
Some think we ought to be German, and they're very mad at those who don't.

392
00:38:34,928 --> 00:38:36,691
他们已准备好…
They're getting ready to...

393
00:38:38,365 --> 00:38:40,799
我希望你父亲不会惹上麻烦
Let's hope your father doesn't get into trouble.

394
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:46,004
别担心父亲，他是海军大英雄 他甚至由国王亲自授动
Don't worry. He's a big naval hero. He was even decorated by the emperor.

395
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:49,471
我不担心他 但我却担心他的女儿
I don't worry about him. I worry about his daughter.

396
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,477
我？为什么？
Me? Why?

397
00:38:51,778 --> 00:38:53,336
-你是那样… -什么？
- Well, you're so... - What?

398
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,270
你是如此地年轻
You're such a baby!

399
00:38:55,715 --> 00:38:58,616
我16岁了，一点都不年轻了
I'm 16. What's such a baby about that?

400
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:04,381
小女孩在空虚的舞台等待
You wait, little girl On an empty stage

401
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:07,991
等待命运的开始
For fate to turn the light on

402
00:39:08,628 --> 00:39:11,859
你的生命目前是空白的一页
Your life, little girl Is an empty page

403
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:16,193
男人希望在上面书写
That men will want to write on

404
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:22,398
书写
To write on

405
00:39:23,343 --> 00:39:27,279
你16岁，快17岁了
You are 16 going on 17

406
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,314
宝贝，该去思考了
Baby, it's time to think

407
00:39:31,518 --> 00:39:35,147
应当警觉，谨慎和当心
Better beware Be canny and careful

408
00:39:35,388 --> 00:39:39,017
宝贝，你正在边缘
Baby, you're on the brink

409
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:43,193
你是16岁，快17岁
You are 16 going on 17

410
00:39:43,396 --> 00:39:47,059
男孩们会排队等候
Fellows will fall in line

411
00:39:47,367 --> 00:39:50,700
很积极的年轻人 和一些鲁莽小人
Eager young lads And roues and cads

412
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:54,840
会向你献酒和美食
Will offer you food and wine

413
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:58,874
你完全没有心理准备
Totally unprepared are you

414
00:39:59,279 --> 00:40:02,840
去面对男人的世界
To face a world of men

415
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:07,580
怯懦和害羞，你会如此的畏惧
Timid and shy and scared are you

416
00:40:07,887 --> 00:40:11,379
事情全在你知识范围以外
Of things beyond your ken

417
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:15,459
你需要一位成熟和有智慧的人
You need someone older and wiser

418
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:19,563
告诉你怎么做
Telling you what to do

419
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:23,235
我17岁快18岁了
I am 17 going on 18

420
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:29,431
我能够照顾你
I'll take care of you

421
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:05,308
我16岁快17岁了
I am 16 going on 17

422
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:08,913
我知道我很天真
I know that I'm naive

423
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:12,413
我遇上的男孩或会说我很甜美
Fellows I meet May tell me I'm sweet

424
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:16,349
我会心甘情愿地相信
And willingly I believe

425
00:41:16,823 --> 00:41:19,986
我16岁快17岁了
I am 16 going on 17

426
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:23,959
如玫瑰般无邪
Innocent as a rose

427
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:27,622
那些喝着白兰地的单身男子
Bachelor dandies Drinkers of brandies

428
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:31,267
我对此毫无认识
What do I know of those?

429
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:34,998
完全没有心理准备
Totally unprepared am I

430
00:41:35,275 --> 00:41:38,767
去面对男人的世界
To face a world of men

431
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:42,512
我是如此怯懦，害羞和害怕
Timid and shy and scared am I

432
00:41:42,782 --> 00:41:46,445
事情全在我知识范围以外
Of things beyond my ken

433
00:41:46,886 --> 00:41:50,481
我需要一位成熟和有智慧的人
I need someone older and wiser

434
00:41:50,723 --> 00:41:54,022
告诉我怎么做
Telling me what to do

435
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:58,057
你17岁快18岁了
You are 17 going on 18

436
00:41:58,298 --> 00:42:03,964
我会完全信赖你
I'll depend on you

437
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:58,449
请进
Come in.

438
00:43:59,485 --> 00:44:01,112
思蜜德小姐
Frau Schmidt.

439
00:44:03,456 --> 00:44:05,185
这是给你做新衣服的
For your new dresses.

440
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:09,484
-舰长从城里买来的 -多么美的布料
- The captain had these sent from town. - Oh, how lovely!

441
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:13,198
我可以缝制出最漂亮的衣裳
These will make the prettiest clothes I've ever had.

442
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:16,958
告诉我，如果我再要求 多点布料的话，他会肯吗？
Do you think he would get me more material if I asked?

443
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:20,832
-家庭教师需要多少衣服？ -不是为我，是为了孩子
- How many dresses do you need? - Not for me, for the children.

444
00:44:21,107 --> 00:44:23,166
我要为他们做点游戏服
I want to make them some play clothes.

445
00:44:23,443 --> 00:44:26,970
范崔普的孩子不玩游戏 他们只做操练
The von Trapp children don't play. They march.

446
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:29,880
所以你不赞成了
Surely you don't approve of that.

447
00:44:30,883 --> 00:44:33,283
自从舰长失去他太太后
Ever since the captain lost his poor wife...

448
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,215
他管理家事就好像管军舰般
...he runs this house as if on one of his ships.

449
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:38,455
哨音、命令
Whistles, orders.

450
00:44:38,725 --> 00:44:40,556
再也没有音乐 没有欢笑了
No more music, no more laughing.

451
00:44:40,827 --> 00:44:44,354
不愿接触任何能让他 想起她的事物，孩子们也一样
Nothing that reminds him of her. Even the children.

452
00:44:44,864 --> 00:44:45,956
那太不对了
But that's so wrong.

453
00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:48,323
可以怎样？
Oh, well.

454
00:44:48,534 --> 00:44:52,197
你喜欢你的房间吗？ 你会有新的窗帘
How do you like your room? There'll be new drapes at the windows.

455
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:53,734
它们还好好地
Bu these are fine.

456
00:44:53,973 --> 00:44:55,634
反正新的已经订了
New ones have been ordered.

457
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:59,141
-我真的不需要它们 -晚安
- But I really don't need them. - Good night, now.

458
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:03,406
思蜜德小姐，你想如果明天 我要求他布料的事
Frau Schmidt, if I asked the captain about the material?

459
00:45:03,683 --> 00:45:08,143
-他明早就离开去维也纳 -是，他要去多久呢？
- He's leaving in the morning. - Of course. How long will he be gone?

460
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:13,317
那得看情况，上次他在男爵夫人 那儿停留了一个月
It depends. The last time he visited the baroness, he stayed for a month.

461
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:19,056
我本不该说这些的 我们还不很熟悉
I shouldn't be saying this to you. I don't know you that well.

462
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:22,233
但如果你问我的话 舰长是很认真地…
But if you ask me, the captain's thinking seriously...

463
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:24,733
想娶这女人
...of marrying her before summer's over.

464
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:28,168
那太好了 孩子们会有新母亲了
Wonderful! The children will have a mother again.

465
00:45:29,609 --> 00:45:30,906
是的
Yes.

466
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:32,906
晚安
Well, good night.

467
00:45:33,112 --> 00:45:34,545
晚安
Good night.

468
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,853
亲爱的天父 我现在知道为何你要我来此了
Dear Father, now I know why You sent me here.

469
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:58,957
是帮助这些孩子 准备接受他们的新母亲
To help these children prepare for a new mother.

470
00:45:59,193 --> 00:46:02,492
而我也祈祷 它将会是个快乐的家庭
And I pray this will become a happy family in Thy sight.

471
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,825
主保佑舰长，莉莎，费瑞克
God bless the captain. God bless Liesl and Friedrich.

472
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:10,197
还有露易莎 碧姬塔，犸塔和小葛特儿
God bless Louisa, Brigitta, Marta and little Gretl.

473
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:13,338
我忘了个男孩 他叫什么名字？
And I forgot the other boy. What's his name?

474
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:16,940
总之，主保佑他
Well, God bless what's-his-name.

475
00:46:17,144 --> 00:46:21,137
求主赐福院长，犸格丽特修女
God bless the Reverend Mother and Sister Margaretta...

476
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:23,146
和在修道院的每位修女
...and everybody at the abbey.

477
00:46:23,351 --> 00:46:25,876
还有主啊，有关莉莎
And now, dear God, about Liesl.

478
00:46:26,387 --> 00:46:28,287
让她知道我是她的朋友
Help her know that I'm her friend...

479
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:31,049
让她告诉我，她在干什么
...and help her tell me what she's been up to.

480
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:32,952
你会去告密吗？
Are you going to tell on me?

481
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:36,630
协助我能了解，让我能指引她
Help me to be understanding so I may guide her footsteps.

482
00:46:36,898 --> 00:46:39,526
因父，及子，及圣神之名
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

483
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:42,726
我出去散步，而大门提前关
I was out walking and somebody locked the doors early.

484
00:46:43,037 --> 00:46:46,666
我不想吵醒大家 所以当我看见你的窗户是开着时…
I didn't want to wake everybody, so when I saw your window open...

485
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:51,335
你不会向父亲告密吧？
You're not going to tell Father, are you?

486
00:46:57,418 --> 00:46:58,715
你是如何攀上来的？
How did you climb up?

487
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,348
我们常这样进来戏弄家教
It's how we always got in to play tricks on the governess.

488
00:47:02,557 --> 00:47:05,549
露易莎能手拿一罐的蜘蛛 单手爬上来呢
Louisa can make it with a whole jar of spiders in her hand.

489
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:08,222
蜘蛛？
Spiders?

490
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:14,561
你是独自出去散步吗？
Were you out walking all by yourself?

491
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:25,740
我们今晚将衣服洗好的话 明天就没有人会知道
If we wash that dress tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow.

492
00:47:26,414 --> 00:47:28,177
你可以穿上这个
You could put this on.

493
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:32,613
进去里面脱下衣服 泡在浴缸里
Take your dress and put it to soak in the bathtub.

494
00:47:32,853 --> 00:47:36,380
回来坐在床上，我们好好谈
Come back here and sit on the bed, and we'll have a talk.

495
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:40,718
我今天告诉你，我不需要家教
I told you today I didn't need a governess.

496
00:47:40,928 --> 00:47:43,021
或许我还真的需要
Well, maybe I do.

497
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:16,054
葛特儿，你害怕吗？
Gretl, are you scared?

498
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:21,831
你不是怕这些雷电吧？
You're not frightened of a storm, are you?

499
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:24,333
与我一起就不用怕了
You just stay right here with me.

500
00:48:25,506 --> 00:48:29,738
-其他的人呢？ -他们睡着了，他们不怕
- Where are the others? - They're asleep. They're not scared.

501
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:35,979
是吗？看
Oh, no? Look.

502
00:48:37,518 --> 00:48:39,486
好吧，大家都上床来
All right, up here on the bed.

503
00:48:39,787 --> 00:48:42,483
-真的吗？ -只此一次，来吧
- Really? - Well, just this once. Come on.

504
00:48:43,591 --> 00:48:47,925
-现在就等男孩们 -他们不会来，男孩们是很勇敢的
- Now we'll wait for the boys. - You won't see them. Boys are brave.

505
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:55,798
你们男孩不是也在害怕吧？
You weren't scared, were you?

506
00:48:56,337 --> 00:48:59,534
当然不怕 我们只想确定你不害怕
Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure that you weren't.

507
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:03,667
-你真周到 -不是我出的主意
- That's very thoughtful of you. - It wasn't my idea.

508
00:49:03,978 --> 00:49:05,809
是寇特
It was Kurt's!

509
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:08,641
寇特，是我忘掉的一位 主保佑寇特
Kurt! That's the one I left out! God bless Kurt.

510
00:49:11,452 --> 00:49:13,215
为何会这样？
Why does it do that?

511
00:49:13,454 --> 00:49:17,288
因为闪电和雷公说话 而雷公在回话
The lightning talks to the thunder, and the thunder answers.

512
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:20,016
-闪电一定很调皮 -并不全然
- But lightning must be nasty. - Not really.

513
00:49:20,294 --> 00:49:22,558
为何雷公如此生气？
Why does the thunder get so angry?

514
00:49:22,830 --> 00:49:24,957
使我想哭
It makes me want to cry.

515
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:31,032
当我感觉不快乐时 我会想一些美好的事物
Whenever I'm feeling unhappy, I just try to think of nice things.

516
00:49:31,238 --> 00:49:33,069
会是哪一类？
What kind of things?

517
00:49:33,841 --> 00:49:35,809
让我想想，美好的事物
Well, let me see. Nice things...

518
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,135
水仙花

525
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:02,231
乳白色小马，香脆苹果批

526
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:05,700
门铃声和雪车铃声 还有那些炸猪排伴面条
Doorbells and sleigh bells And schnitzel with noodles

527
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:08,875
飞翔的野雁 翅膀上有月亮
Wild geese that fly With the moon on their wings

528
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,944
这些都是部分我喜欢的事物
These are a few of my favorite things

529
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:16,945
女孩们穿着白裙佩着蓝缎带

530
00:50:17,218 --> 00:50:20,415
雪花落在我的鼻子和睫毛上

531
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:23,748
银白色的冬天溶化成春天

536
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:37,301
只要想起我最喜爱的事物

537

女孩们穿着白裙佩着蓝缎带

银白色的冬天溶化成春天

这些都是我喜爱的事物

562

当狗咬时…

563
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:58,151
狗咬
Dog bites.

564
00:52:04,792 --> 00:52:06,020
你好
Hello.

565
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:10,391
小姐，我是否告诉过你 在这屋里要严守就时间？
Fraulein, did I not tell you that bedtime is to be strictly observed?

566
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:13,394
孩子们被风暴所惊吓 所以我想…
The children were upset by the storm, so l...

567
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:15,791
你是说过，先生
You did, sir.

568
00:52:16,003 --> 00:52:20,201
要你记住如此简单的指示 是否很困难？
Do you, or do you not, have difficulty remembering such simple instructions?

569
00:52:21,508 --> 00:52:23,135
只有在雷电风暴时
Only during thunderstorms.

570
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:27,136
莉莎
Liesl?

571
00:52:27,381 --> 00:52:29,576
晚饭后我没看见你
I don't recall seeing you after dinner.

572
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:31,913
是吗，事实上…
Really? As a matter of fact...

573
00:52:32,186 --> 00:52:33,414
怎样？
Yes?

574
00:52:34,221 --> 00:52:35,381
我是…
Well, I was...

575
00:52:35,656 --> 00:52:37,715
她想说的是
What she would like to say...

576
00:52:37,925 --> 00:52:40,826
我们今晚相处得较熟了
...is that she and I have been getting acquainted tonight.

577
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:45,897
现在已不早了 你们听见父亲的话了，快回床上去
It's too late to go into that. You heard your father. Go back to bed.

578
00:52:50,537 --> 00:52:51,936
小姐
Fraulein...

579
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:56,266
你还记得我明早要出门吧
...you have managed to remember I'm leaving in the morning?

580
00:52:57,378 --> 00:53:01,906
你是否也能记住 这房子的首要规定就是纪律？

581
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:06,075
相信在我回来之前
Then I trust that before I return...

582
00:53:06,587 --> 00:53:08,350
你会学到一些？

583
00:53:09,723 --> 00:53:11,088
舰长
Captain?

584
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:15,961
我是否能跟你谈 有关孩子的游戏服
Could I talk to you about clothes for the children for when they play?

585
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,926
-如果我能有些布料的话… -你显然是非常全能的
- Lf I could have some material. - You are many things.

586
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:21,360
但唠叨不是我所想要的
Not the least of which is repetitious.

587
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:23,729
-但他们只是孩子呀 -是的
- But they're children! - Yes.

588
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,734
而我是他们的父亲
And I'm their father.

589
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:27,535
晚安
Good night.

590
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:57,635
女孩们穿着白裙佩着蓝缎带
Girls in white dresses With blue satin sashes

591
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:12,676
当狗咬时，当蜂蛰时
When the dog bites When the bee stings

592
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,411
当我感觉伤心时
When I'm feeling sad

593
00:54:15,656 --> 00:54:18,955
只要想起我最喜爱的事物
I simply remember my favorite things

594
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:21,286
我的心情就不会…
And then I don't feel...

595
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:28,457
如此糟了
...so bad

596
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:55,155
孩子，看这边
Children, over here. See!

597
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,164
走吧！
Come on.

598
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,445
犸莉亚小姐
Fraulein Maria?

599
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,618
我们能每天都如此吗？
Can we do this every day?

600
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:30,117
-你不认为你会厌倦吗？ -我想是吧！
- Don't you think you'd get tired of it? - I suppose so.

601
00:56:30,457 --> 00:56:31,719
每隔一天？
Every other day?

602
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:36,555
我自从在约瑟芬小姐的牙刷上 放胶水后，就没有如此开心过了
I haven't had so much fun since we put glue on Fraulein Josephine's toothbrush.

603
00:56:36,763 --> 00:56:40,665
我真不懂像你们如此好的小孩 怎会恶作剧呢？
I can't understand how children as nice as you can play such tricks.

604
00:56:40,934 --> 00:56:42,765
-这很简单啊 -为何要如此？
- It's easy. - But why do it?

605
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,404
否则我们要如何吸引 父亲的注意力呢？
How else can we get Father's attention?

606
00:56:46,173 --> 00:56:47,765
我明白了
Oh, I see.

607
00:56:49,109 --> 00:56:51,304
我们得多想想那一点
We'll have to think about that one.

608
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,107
来吧，大家，过来
All right, over here.

609
00:56:55,315 --> 00:56:56,748
我们要做什么？
What are we going to do?

610
00:56:56,984 --> 00:56:58,952
我们来想首歌 好欢迎男爵夫人的到来
Think of a song for the baroness.

611
00:56:59,186 --> 00:57:01,154
父亲不喜欢我们唱歌
Father doesn't like us to sing.

612
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:04,982
或许我们可以改变他的想法 你们会唱什么歌？
Perhaps we can change his mind. Now, what songs do you know?

613
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,420
我们什么歌都不会唱
We don't know any songs.

614
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,323
-一首歌都不会？ -我们甚至不知如何唱歌
- Not any? - We don't even know how to sing.

615
00:57:11,999 --> 00:57:14,160
那就不能浪费时间了 你们必须学习
Let's not lose time. You must learn.

616
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,163
但是如何学呢？
But how?

617
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:24,433
我们从最初步开始学
Let's start at the very beginning

618
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:28,012
从一个很恰当的地方开始
A very good place to start

619
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:30,149
当你读书时，你从
When you read you begin with

620
00:57:30,384 --> 00:57:31,612
ABC开始
A, B, C

621
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:36,152
当你唱歌时 你从DoReMi开始
When you sing, you begin with Do-Re-Mi

622
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,017
Do remi？
Do-re-mi

623
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:39,623
Do remi
Do-re-mi

624
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,694
开始的三个音是
The first three notes Just happen to be

625
00:57:43,964 --> 00:57:45,727
Do remi

626
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:47,228
Do remi
Do-re-mi

627
00:57:47,467 --> 00:57:51,403
Do remi fa so la ti
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti

628
00:57:52,072 --> 00:57:54,506
让我看是否能使它容易点
Let's see if I can make it easier.

629
00:57:57,911 --> 00:58:01,574
“Doe”是一头雌性的鹿

637
00:58:29,843 --> 00:58:33,404

644
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:57,132

645
00:58:57,371 --> 00:59:00,807

653
00:59:25,899 --> 00:59:28,993
Do remi fa so la ti do，so do
Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do

654
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:33,998
Do remi fa so 只是用来建立歌曲的工具
Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only the tools we use to build a song.

655
00:59:34,274 --> 00:59:37,505
只要你们学会音阶 就能唱各种歌
Once you have them in your head you can sing different tunes...

656
00:59:37,778 --> 00:59:39,905
把它们起来，像这个

So do la fa mi do re

- Good. - But it doesn't mean anything.

666
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:26,526
所以我们要加上词 每一个音一个字
So we put in words. One word for every note.

667
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,055
像这样
Like this:

668
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:34,859
当你学会音符后
When you know the notes to sing

669
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:40,732
你几乎可以唱任何歌
You can sing most anything

670
01:00:41,007 --> 01:00:41,974
一起来
Together!

671
01:00:42,175 --> 01:00:48,876
当你学会音符后
When you know the notes to sing

672
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:55,749
你几乎可以唱任何歌
You can sing most anything

673
01:00:56,156 --> 01:00:59,523
-Doe -是一头雌性的鹿

674
01:00:59,793 --> 01:01:02,990

676
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,760

677
01:01:10,003 --> 01:01:13,370
-Sew -是用针拉着线
- Sew - A needle pulling thread

678
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,938
-La -是Sew之后的音
- La - A note to follow sew

679
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:20,136
-Tea -是配果酱面包的饮品
- Tea - A drink with jam and bread

680
01:01:20,347 --> 01:01:24,215
那样我们又回到Doe
That will bring us back to doe

681
01:01:41,802 --> 01:01:48,071
当你学会音符后
When you know the notes to sing

682
01:01:48,642 --> 01:01:55,138
你几乎可以唱任何歌
You can sing most anything

683
01:01:55,715 --> 01:01:58,878
Doe是一头雌性的鹿
Doe A deer, a female deer

684
01:01:59,152 --> 01:02:02,679
Ray是一线金色的阳光
Ray A drop of golden sun

685
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,347
Me是我对自己的称呼
Me A name I call myself

686
01:02:06,593 --> 01:02:09,756
Far是一段漫漫长路

687
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:13,193
Sew是用针拉着线

688
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,597

690
01:02:20,073 --> 01:02:24,032
那样我们又回到…
That will bring us back to

691
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:31,082
So do la fa mi do re
So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re

692
01:02:31,351 --> 01:02:35,845
So do la fa ti
So-do-la-fa-ti

693
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:37,716
La so
La-so

694
01:02:41,261 --> 01:02:47,063
Ti do
Ti-do

695
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:48,757
So do
So-do

696
01:03:02,215 --> 01:03:05,309
这些山真是壮观 真是棒透了
The mountains are magnificent, really magnificent.

697
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:08,214
-我特别为你而升起的 -哦？
- I had them put up just for you. - Oh?

698
01:03:08,488 --> 01:03:10,649
万尺高山
Even if it's to a height of 10,000 feet...

699
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:14,451
盖尔总是相信 它的升起是为了特殊场合
...Georg always believes in "rising to the occasion."

700
01:03:14,728 --> 01:03:16,992
你的笑话不改进的话 我就要收回邀请了
Improve the jokes or I'll disinvite you.

701
01:03:17,597 --> 01:03:20,157
你并未邀请我 我是不请自来的
You didn't invite me. I invited myself.

702
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,958
-当然 -你需要伴护人
- Naturally. - You needed a chaperone...

703
01:03:23,236 --> 01:03:25,966
我需要有佳肴…
...and I needed a place where the cuisine is superb...

704
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,833
美酒的地方
...the wine cellar unexcelled...

705
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,736
而价格又公道
...and the price perfect.

706
01:03:32,112 --> 01:03:33,943
麦斯，你真的太过分了
Max, you are outrageous.

707
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:38,173
一点也不，我是很迷人的食客
Not at all. I'm a very charming sponge.

708
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:41,946
听
Listen.

709
01:03:44,291 --> 01:03:46,521
那是可普曼修道院的唱诗班
That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.

710
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:51,156
他们唱得很好
They're good.

711
01:03:52,198 --> 01:03:53,825
非常好
Very good.

712
01:03:54,634 --> 01:03:57,296
以后几天里我要探索这地区
I must explore this area in the next few days.

713
01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:00,962
在某处，有个渴望被发掘的 合唱团在等我发掘
Somewhere, a hungry singing group is waiting for Max Detweiler...

714
01:04:01,207 --> 01:04:05,507
并在萨尔斯堡的音乐节时 一举成名
...to pluck it out and make it famous at the Salzburg Folk Festival.

715
01:04:05,712 --> 01:04:09,011
-他们有名而你就有利 -那不公平，我得承认
- They get fame, you get money. - It's unfair, I admit it.

716
01:04:09,282 --> 01:04:13,651
但有天一切都会改变 我也会成名的
But someday that'll be changed. I shall get the fame too.

717
01:04:20,694 --> 01:04:22,855
天啊，这是怎么回事？
Good heavens, what's this?

718
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:26,629
没什么，只是本地的顽童
It's nothing. Just some local urchins.

719
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:45,750
在这里和你在一起 真的让我很兴奋
This really is exciting for me, Georg. Being here with you.

720
01:04:46,586 --> 01:04:49,146
树林，湖泽 这些你都已经看过了
Trees, lakes, you've seen them before.

721
01:04:49,422 --> 01:04:52,016
我不是这个意思 你是知道的
That is not what I mean, and you know it.

722
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:56,217
-你是指我吗？我令你兴奋？ -不可能吗？
- You mean me? I'm exciting? - Is that so impossible?

723
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:59,522
不是，只是不会发生
No, just highly improbable.

724
01:04:59,766 --> 01:05:03,930
-又来了，又看低自己了 -我是危险的驾驶人
- There you go, running yourself down. - Well, I'm a dangerous driver.

725
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:11,404
在这里，我好像比较 容易了解你，盖尔
You're much less of a riddle when I see you here, Georg.

726
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:14,444
-在我生长的地方？ -是的，正是
- In my natural habitat? - Yes, exactly.

727
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:16,875
你是说在这
Are you saying that I'm more at home...

728
01:05:17,117 --> 01:05:21,110
鸟语花香的地方
...among the birds and the flowers and the wind that moves...

729
01:05:21,388 --> 01:05:23,549
我感觉较舒适？
...through the trees like a restless sea?

730
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,382
多有诗意啊
How poetic.

731
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:27,457
是的，我是的，不是吗？
Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?

732
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:33,726
我觉得在此比在维也纳安逸 在你们那奢华的沙龙里
More at home here than in Vienna in all your glittering salons...

733
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:38,302
和那些无聊汉附庸风雅喝香槟
...gossiping gaily with bores I detest, soaking myself in champagne...

734
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:42,302
被那不知名的华尔兹所牵绊
...stumbling about to waltzes by Strausses I can't even remember?

735
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:44,736
-你就是想告诉我这些吗？ -是的
- Is that what you're saying? - Yes.

736
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:47,276
你为何会有那概念？
Now whatever gave you that idea?

737
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:54,552
我真的喜欢这儿，盖尔 如此可爱和宁静
Oh, I do like it here, Georg. It's so lovely and peaceful.

738
01:05:54,888 --> 01:05:56,822
你怎舍得经常离开此地？
How can you leave it so often?

739
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:59,923
我想是假装自己还是很活跃
Oh, pretending to be madly active, I suppose.

740
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:03,425
活跃使生命看似充满了目的
Activity suggests a life filled with purpose.

741
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:06,428
可能是在逃避回忆
Could it be running away from memories?

742
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:13,572
也许是在寻求留下的理由
Or perhaps just searching for a reason to stay.

743
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:17,732
我希望那是你 常去维也纳的理由
I hope that's why you've been coming to Vienna so often.

744
01:06:18,411 --> 01:06:22,745
-还是那儿有让你着魔的事物？ -我不能说是你令我着魔的
- Were there other distractions? - I'd hardly call you a distraction.

745
01:06:22,982 --> 01:06:25,644
那你如何形容我，盖尔？
Well, what would you call me, Georg?

746
01:06:27,921 --> 01:06:29,183
漂亮…
Lovely...

747
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:32,818
美丽，聪明有风度 很完美的女主人
...charming, witty, graceful, the perfect hostess...

748
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:35,859
你会恨我这样说的：
...and, you're going to hate me for this...

749
01:06:36,296 --> 01:06:38,355
有点像是我的救世主
...in a way, my savior.

750
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:40,462
真不浪漫呀
Oh, how unromantic.

751
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:42,999
如果我不告诉你 那我就是不知感恩的小人了
I'd be an ungrateful wretch if I didn't say...

752
01:06:43,269 --> 01:06:46,500
是你使我重新体会生命的意义
...that you brought some meaning back into my life.

753
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:51,105
我想我是受宠若惊
I am amusing, I suppose.

754
01:06:51,344 --> 01:06:56,111
我拥有维也纳最好的地方 最上流的社交圈子的朋友
I have the finest couturier in Vienna and a glittering circle of friends.

755
01:06:56,316 --> 01:06:59,444
-和举办最豪华的派对 -是的
- I do give some rather gay parties. - Oh, yes.

756
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:01,517
除去那些…
But take all that away...

757
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:06,158
我只是一个富有 和飘浮不定的人
...and you have just wealthy, unattached little me...

758
01:07:06,826 --> 01:07:09,226
在寻寻觅觅，就像你一样
...searching, just like you.

759
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:16,029
多来点馅饼吗？
More strudel, Herr Detweiler?

760
01:07:16,302 --> 01:07:17,826
-我吃了多少？ -两个了
- How many have I had? - Two.

761
01:07:18,071 --> 01:07:20,005
那么它就成为第三个吧
Make it an uneven three.

762
01:07:23,309 --> 01:07:26,335
还在吃，麦斯？ 一定是不太快乐
Still eating, Max? Must be unhappy.

763
01:07:26,546 --> 01:07:30,505
数月来我一直想从何洛克那边 弄来那队四重奏
That mixed quartet I've been trying to steal away from Sol Hurok...

764
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:33,412
-发生何事？ -沙夏皮特抢先了
- What happened? ...Sascha Petrie stole them first.

765
01:07:33,653 --> 01:07:34,915
我最恨贼了
I hate thieves.

766
01:07:35,188 --> 01:07:38,487
麦斯，你要学习自爱
Max, you really must try and learn to love yourself.

767
01:07:38,725 --> 01:07:41,057
为此事我得打长途电话到巴黎 罗马及斯德哥尔摩
I had to call Paris, Rome and Stockholm.

768
01:07:41,327 --> 01:07:44,888
-当然是用盖尔的电话了 -要不然我怎么负担得起？
- On Georg's telephone, of course. - How else could I afford it?

769
01:07:45,365 --> 01:07:50,496
我喜欢有钱人，我喜欢他们的 生活方式，尤其和他们一起生活时
I like rich people, the way they live and how I live when I'm with them.

770
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:52,828
我在想孩子们上哪儿去了
I wonder where the children are.

771
01:07:53,239 --> 01:07:55,730
他们一定是听见我来 躲起来了
They must have heard I was coming and hid.

772
01:07:56,009 --> 01:07:58,500
我是希望他们会在家欢迎你的
I was hoping they'd be here to welcome you.

773
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:03,239
麦斯，试着放开朗一些，好吗？
Max, do step out of character for a moment and try and be charming.

774
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,691
怎样？
Well?

775
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:15,788
什么怎样？
Well what?

776
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:18,930
你让盖尔决定了没？ 我是否会听见婚礼钟声？
Have you made up his mind? Do I hear wedding bells?

777
01:08:19,199 --> 01:08:21,190
-很有希望 -太棒了
- Pealing madly. - Marvelous.

778
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:24,198
-但不一定跟我有关 -那是什么意思？
- Not necessarily for me. - What kind of talk's that?

779
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:25,962
那跟你无关
None-of-your-business talk.

780
01:08:26,272 --> 01:08:28,706
我很喜欢盖尔 我不准你把我们当玩具
I'm terribly fond of him, so don't toy with us.

781
01:08:28,975 --> 01:08:32,570
但我是个孩子，我喜欢玩具 所以告诉我一切吧
But I'm a child. I like toys. So tell me everything.

782
01:08:32,879 --> 01:08:37,942
快点，告诉麦斯一切的细节
Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy, intimate, disgusting detail.

783
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:43,549
我有感觉，我来这里的目的 是要得到认可
Well, let's just say I have a feeling I may be here on approval.

784
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:46,816
-我同意了，你怎会错过？ -很容易的
- I approve of that. How can you miss? - Far too easily.

785
01:08:47,093 --> 01:08:50,324
如我了解你的话 我知道你会找到方法的
If I know you, darling, and I do, you will find a way.

786
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:53,088
-他不是普通人 -他很富有
- He's no ordinary man. - No, he's rich.

787
01:08:53,333 --> 01:08:55,597
他老婆的死 给他带来可怕的心痛
His wife's death gave him a great heartache.

788
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:58,930
当你先生死时 他留给你一笔可观的遗产
And your husband's death gave you a great fortune.

789
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,106
麦斯，你真是怪物
Oh, Max, you really are a beast.

790
01:09:01,307 --> 01:09:05,334
你和盖尔对我来讲，就像是一家人 所以我想看到你们两人结婚
You and Georg are like family. That's why I want to see you married.

791
01:09:05,578 --> 01:09:09,139
我们必须保留那笔钱 在同一家庭中
We must keep all that lovely money in the family.

792
01:09:25,431 --> 01:09:28,366
-你在干什么？ -范舰长
- What are you doing there? - Oh, Captain von Trapp.

793
01:09:28,635 --> 01:09:30,660
我正在找…
I was just looking for...

794
01:09:31,537 --> 01:09:34,370
我没看到，我不知道你…
I didn't see, I mean, I didn't know you were...

795
01:09:34,974 --> 01:09:36,669
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler!

796
01:09:37,377 --> 01:09:38,867
你是谁？
Who are you?

797
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:41,375
我送电报给德维勒先生
I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.

798
01:09:41,648 --> 01:09:44,378
-我就是 -是的，先生
- I am Herr Detweiler. - Yes, sir.

799
01:09:49,455 --> 01:09:52,049
好，电报你送到了，滚吧
You've delivered your telegram. Now get out.

800
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,232
-盖尔，他只是个小男孩 -是，而我只是个奥地利人
- Georg, he's just a boy. - Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.

801
01:10:02,468 --> 01:10:05,232
要发生的迟早会发生 只要确定不会发生在你身上
Things will happen. Make sure they don't happen to you.

802
01:10:05,538 --> 01:10:08,200
麦斯，你别再这样说
Max! Don't you ever say that again.

803
01:10:08,474 --> 01:10:10,669
你知道我没有政治主张
I have no political convictions.

804
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,845
-人人都如此时我可以怎样？ -有东西可以做的
- Can I help it if other people do? - You can help it.

805
01:10:14,981 --> 01:10:17,142
一定有
You must help it.

806
01:10:27,427 --> 01:10:29,019
哈
Hello?

807
01:10:31,664 --> 01:10:34,428
你如此遥远，你在哪儿？
You're far away. Where are you?

808
01:10:34,734 --> 01:10:38,602
在一个遥不可及的世界里
In a world that's disappearing, I'm afraid.

809
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,034
我有办法带你回到现实世界吗？
Is there any way I could bring you back to the world I'm in?

810
01:11:08,968 --> 01:11:11,459
-爸爸，是爸爸！ -是你们爸爸！
- Father! Father! - There's your father!

811
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:14,899
哦，舰长，你回来了
Oh, captain, you're home!

812
01:11:23,282 --> 01:11:25,944
立刻从水里上来
Come out of that water at once!

813
01:11:35,061 --> 01:11:37,256
你一定是史蕾特男爵夫人
Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.

814
01:11:42,568 --> 01:11:45,560
我湿透了！
I'm soaked to the skin!

815
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,916
排好
Straight line!

816
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,999
这位是史蕾特男爵夫人
This is Baroness Schraeder.

817
01:12:18,604 --> 01:12:20,367
而这些…
And these...

818
01:12:20,606 --> 01:12:22,198
是我的孩子们
...are my children.

819
01:12:23,309 --> 01:12:24,799
你们好
How do you do?

820
01:12:25,878 --> 01:12:30,611
进去屋里，抹干身子，清洁好 换衣服后再回来此地
Go inside, dry off, clean up, change your clothes and report back here!

821
01:12:35,621 --> 01:12:37,714
小姐，请你留下来
Fraulein, you will stay here, please!

822
01:12:39,459 --> 01:12:43,020
我最好去看麦斯在干什么
I think I'd better go see what Max is up to.

823
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:55,002
小姐…
Now, fraulein...

824
01:12:56,909 --> 01:12:58,968
我要你据实回答
...I want a truthful answer.

825
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:00,845
是的，舰长
Yes, captain.

826
01:13:01,147 --> 01:13:05,208
是真有可能，或只是我的想像…
Is it possible, or could I have just imagined it?

827
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,213
我的孩子们今天有爬过树？
Have my children, by any chance, been climbing trees today?

828
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:12,851
是的，舰长
Yes, captain.

829
01:13:13,926 --> 01:13:15,257
这样
I see.

830
01:13:15,828 --> 01:13:20,322
我能否请教他们哪来的这些
And where, may I ask, did they get these...

831
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:22,659
-游戏服 -你是如此称呼它们的
- Play clothes. - Is that what they are?

832
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:26,270
是我拿我卧房里的 旧窗帘所做的
I made them from the drapes that used to hang in my bedroom.

833
01:13:27,073 --> 01:13:29,200
-窗帘？ -还剩下很多
- Drapes? - They have plenty of wear left.

834
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:31,342
孩子们穿着玩了不少地方
We've been everywhere in them.

835
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:36,037
你是在告诉我 我的孩子穿着旧窗帘的布料…
Are you telling me that my children have been roaming about Salzburg...

836
01:13:36,249 --> 01:13:39,616
玩遍了萨尔斯堡？
...dressed up in nothing but some old drapes?

837
01:13:39,852 --> 01:13:41,513
而且玩得很开心
And having a marvelous time!

838
01:13:41,721 --> 01:13:44,952
-他们有制服 -对不起那是疯子穿的
- They have uniforms. - Forgive me, straitjackets.

839
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:47,955
孩子们不该担心他们会弄脏 他们珍贵的制服
They can't be children if they worry about clothes...

840
01:13:48,227 --> 01:13:49,353
我没听过埋怨
They don't complain.

841
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:52,291
他们不敢，他们太爱你 我想…
They don't dare. They love you too much and fear...

842
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:54,090
我不想讨论我的孩子们
Don't discuss my children.

843
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,234
你必须听某人说的 你从来不在家久留的
You've got to hear, you're never home...

844
01:13:56,435 --> 01:13:57,959
我不想再听你说 有关我孩子们的事
I don't want to hear more!

845
01:13:58,204 --> 01:14:00,695
我知道你不要，但你必须
I know you don't, but you've got to!

846
01:14:01,474 --> 01:14:03,635
-就拿莉莎来说吧 -你别再说…
- Liesl's not a child. - Not one word...

847
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:06,777
她快要长成一个女人 但你甚至不了解她
Soon she'll be a woman and you won't even know her.

848
01:14:07,046 --> 01:14:10,106
费瑞克要像你一样成为男人 但没有人给他作榜样
Friedrich wants to be a man but you're not here to show...

849
01:14:10,383 --> 01:14:11,714
你怎胆敢告诉我儿子的事？
Don't you dare tell me...

850
01:14:11,951 --> 01:14:15,216
碧姬塔可以告诉你他的事 她洞悉一切
Brigitta could tell you about him. She notices everything.

851
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:18,582
还有寇特，他假装强悍 当你漠视他时
Kurt acts tough to hide the pain when you ignore him...

852
01:14:18,791 --> 01:14:20,315
他还要表现出坚强的神情
...the way you do all of them.

853
01:14:20,593 --> 01:14:22,993
还有露易莎，我还不太了解她
Louisa, I don't know about yet.

854
01:14:23,262 --> 01:14:26,459
这些小孩只想要被爱 求求你，舰长，爱他们
The little ones just want love. Please, love them all.

855
01:14:26,732 --> 01:14:28,256
我不想再听你说有关孩子的事
I don't care to hear more.

856
01:14:28,501 --> 01:14:32,597
-我还没说完 -是的，你说完了，舰长
- I am not finished yet, captain! - Oh, yes, you are, captain!

857
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:35,300
小姐
Fraulein.

858
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:40,739
你现在立刻收拾行李
Now, you will pack your things this minute...

859
01:14:40,947 --> 01:14:43,438
回去修道院
...and return to the abbey.

860
01:14:46,085 --> 01:14:47,416
那是什么？
What's that?

861
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,179
是歌声
It's singing.

862
01:14:50,823 --> 01:14:53,621
我知道是歌声，但是谁在唱歌？
Yes, I realize it's singing. But who is singing?

863
01:14:54,594 --> 01:14:56,152
孩子们
The children.

864
01:14:59,031 --> 01:15:00,362
孩子们？
The children?

865
01:15:00,933 --> 01:15:03,663
我教了他们一首歌 欢迎男爵夫人
I taught them something to sing for the baroness.

866
01:15:09,308 --> 01:15:15,338
群山让我心充满音乐
My heart wants to sing Every song it hears

867
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:18,175
要唱出每支歌
Every song that it hears

868
01:15:18,451 --> 01:15:23,889
我心震荡像鸟儿翅膀
My heart wants to beat like the wings Of the birds that rise

869
01:15:24,156 --> 01:15:27,284
由湖边飞上树
From the lake to the trees

870
01:15:27,526 --> 01:15:28,959
飞上树
To the trees

871
01:15:29,195 --> 01:15:34,132
我心叹息
My heart wants to sigh Like a chime that flies

872
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:38,963
像钟声飘扬
From a church on a breeze

873
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:43,140
笑声像小溪
To laugh like a brook When it trips and falls

874
01:15:43,409 --> 01:15:46,344
流过石头跌荡抑扬
Over stones on its way

875
01:15:46,646 --> 01:15:48,011
跌荡抑扬
On its way

876
01:15:48,247 --> 01:15:52,684
夜晚歌唱
To sing through the night

877
01:15:52,885 --> 01:15:58,551
像云雀祈祷
Like a lark who is learning to pray

878
01:15:58,824 --> 01:16:03,318
当我奔向山里
I go to the hills

879
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:09,764
心情落寞
When my heart is lonely

880
01:16:10,036 --> 01:16:13,733
我听到…
I know I will hear

881
01:16:14,006 --> 01:16:19,774
昔日歌声
What I've heard before

882
01:16:20,613 --> 01:16:24,845
我心就会歌唱
My heart will be blessed

883
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:32,047
因为音乐的响起
With the sound of music

884
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:38,124
我要再度…
And I'll sing...

885
01:16:38,364 --> 01:16:46,464
歌唱
...once more

886
01:17:19,739 --> 01:17:21,502
雪绒花
Edelweiss!

887
01:17:25,478 --> 01:17:28,641
你从来没有告诉我 你的孩子们如此地可爱
You never told me how enchanting your children are.

888
01:17:37,256 --> 01:17:38,814
别走开
Don't go away.

889
01:17:43,929 --> 01:17:45,328
小姐
Fraulein.

890
01:17:48,667 --> 01:17:49,861
我的…
I...

891
01:17:51,337 --> 01:17:54,135
表现很失常，我道歉
...behaved badly. I apologize.

892
01:17:55,875 --> 01:17:59,470
我说话太过分了 这是我最大的缺点
I'm far too outspoken. It's one of my worst faults.

893
01:17:59,879 --> 01:18:01,346
你说的对
You were right.

894
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:05,716
我不了解我的孩子们
I don't know my children.

895
01:18:07,019 --> 01:18:11,149
仍然有时间，舰长 他们很想接近你
There's still time, captain. They want so much to be close to you.

896
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:15,358
你将音乐带回到这个家庭里
And you brought music back into the house.

897
01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:18,128
我都忘记了
I'd forgotten.

898
01:18:20,866 --> 01:18:22,197
小姐
Fraulein.

899
01:18:24,703 --> 01:18:25,965
我要你留下来
I want you to stay.

900
01:18:29,975 --> 01:18:32,705
我请求你留下来
I ask you to stay.

901
01:18:34,547 --> 01:18:38,039
-如果我能帮忙的话 -你已经帮了很多忙
- Lf I could be of any help. - You have already.

902
01:18:38,651 --> 01:18:39,709
比你知道的更多
More than you know.

903
01:18:59,438 --> 01:19:00,769
犸塔
Marta.

904
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:02,735
开幕
Curtain!

905
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:08,744
高高的山上 有个寂寞的牧羊人在唱歌
High on a hill was a lonely goatherd

906
01:19:10,249 --> 01:19:13,514
他的歌声真响亮
Loud was the voice Of the lonely goatherd

907
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,285
偏僻小镇的居民 亦听到他的歌声
Folks in a town That was quite remote heard

908
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:23,090
他的歌声雄壮而清脆
Lusty and clear From the goatherd's throat heard

909
01:19:34,607 --> 01:19:37,474
犸塔！犸塔！
Marta. Marta!

910
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,870
葛特儿，王子
Gretl, the prince!

911
01:19:43,616 --> 01:19:47,074
城堡的桥上有个王子听到了
A prince on the bridge Of a castle moat heard

912
01:19:48,554 --> 01:19:50,886
背着行囊上路的人们也听到了
Men on a road With a load to tote heard

913
01:19:53,392 --> 01:19:56,657
用膳中的人们也听到了
Men in the midst Of a table d'hote heard

914
01:19:57,997 --> 01:20:01,262
喝啤酒的人们也听到了
Men drinking beer With the foam afloat heard

915
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:15,472
穿淡粉红色外衣的女孩也听见了
One little girl In a pale pink coat heard

916
01:20:17,116 --> 01:20:20,449
她唱歌回应那寂寞的牧羊人
She yodeled back To the lonely goatherd

917
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:25,021
她妈妈也欣喜的唱着
Soon her mama With a gleaming gloat heard

918
01:20:26,525 --> 01:20:29,824
一个女孩和牧羊人 唱出多好的二重唱呀
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

919
01:21:16,408 --> 01:21:19,673
穿淡粉红色外衣的女孩也听见了
One little girl In a pale pink coat heard

920
01:21:21,213 --> 01:21:24,478
她唱歌回应那寂寞的牧羊人
She yodeled back To the lonely goatherd

921
01:21:25,818 --> 01:21:29,254
她妈妈也欣喜的唱着
Soon her mama With a gleaming gloat heard

922
01:21:30,723 --> 01:21:33,851
一个女孩和牧羊人 唱出多好的二重唱呀
What a duet for a girl and goatherd

923
01:21:35,561 --> 01:21:37,188
他们多快乐啊
Happy are they

924
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:43,430
二重唱将要成为三重唱
Soon the duet will become a trio

925
01:22:07,926 --> 01:22:09,518
-好极了！ -好极了！
- Bravo! - Bravo!

926
01:22:09,728 --> 01:22:11,218
好极了！
Very good!

927
01:22:13,032 --> 01:22:14,932
真精彩！
Wonderful!

928
01:22:15,534 --> 01:22:18,697
-麦斯伯伯，可以保留木偶吗？ -可以吗？
- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max? - Yes, can we?

929
01:22:18,904 --> 01:22:20,929
你当然可以，亲爱的
Of course you may, my darlings.

930
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:25,372
不然，我怎能告诉可伦教授 将帐单寄给你父亲
Why else did I tell Professor Kohner to send the bill to your father?

931
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,775
做得很好，小姐
Well done, fraulein.

932
01:22:33,285 --> 01:22:35,253
我真的很感动
I really am very much impressed.

933
01:22:35,454 --> 01:22:37,445
他们是你的孩子
They're your children, captain.

934
01:22:44,663 --> 01:22:46,961
你还有什么做不到的事吗？
My dear, is there anything you can't do?

935
01:22:47,232 --> 01:22:49,564
我不知自己能否成为好修女
Well, I'm not sure I'll make a good nun.

936
01:22:49,802 --> 01:22:52,896
如果有任何问题 我很乐意帮你的
If you have any problems, I'd be happy to help you.

937

939
01:23:01,346 --> 01:23:03,644
经过一番苦心的寻求
Today, after a long and desperate search...

940
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:08,910
我终于找到参加 萨尔斯堡音乐节的合唱团了
...I have found a most exciting entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.

941
01:23:09,121 --> 01:23:10,952
恭喜你，麦斯
Congratulations, Max.

942
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:14,159
这次是谁要给你利用呢？
And who will you be exploiting this time?

943
01:23:15,961 --> 01:23:19,158
-圣伊格森合唱团？ -再猜
- The Saint Ignatius Choir? - Guess again.

944
01:23:19,865 --> 01:23:23,801
我想，克兰曼歌团？
Well, let me see now. The Klopmann Choir?

945
01:23:24,036 --> 01:23:26,436
-不对，不对 -不对？
- No, no, no, no. - No, no?

946
01:23:26,638 --> 01:23:27,832
告诉我们
Tell us.

947
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:31,498
一个由家庭组成的合唱团 你永远都不会估中的
A singing group all in one family. You'll never guess, Georg.

948
01:23:31,777 --> 01:23:34,678
多么好的主意
What a charming idea!

949
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,677
谁的家庭？
Whose family?

950
01:23:37,549 --> 01:23:39,176
你的啊
Yours.

951
01:23:39,384 --> 01:23:41,716
他们将会是一大轰动
They'll be the talk of the festival.

952
01:23:44,556 --> 01:23:47,548
-有何好笑的？ -你很好笑，麦斯
- Well, now, what's so funny? - You are, Max.

953
01:23:47,826 --> 01:23:50,954
很昂贵，但很好笑
You're expensive, but very funny.

954
01:23:51,697 --> 01:23:54,029
-他们一定会相当轰动的 -不，麦斯
- They'll be a sensation! - No, Max.

955
01:23:54,299 --> 01:23:56,494
是极好的主意 新面孔又自然
It's a wonderful idea. Fresh, original.

956
01:23:56,702 --> 01:24:01,503
麦斯，我的孩子们不公开演唱
Max! My children do not sing in public.

957
01:24:02,174 --> 01:24:04,142
不能怪我没尝试过
You can't blame me for trying.

958
01:24:04,343 --> 01:24:07,335
孩子们，下一个该谁唱？
Children, who shall we hear from next?

959
01:24:10,149 --> 01:24:11,309
谁唱？
Who?

960
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:18,683

01:24:26,165 --> 01:24:27,359
我？
Me?

964
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,498
-我不懂 -拜托
- I don't understand. - Please.

965
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:38,835
不…
No, no, no, no.

966
01:24:39,111 --> 01:24:41,170
我听说，很久以前 你唱的非常好
I'm told that you were quite good.

967
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,679
-那是非常非常久之前 -我还记得，父亲
- That was a very, very long time ago. - I remember, Father.

968
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:47,784
-请为我们唱一首 -求求你，父亲
- Play us something we know. - Oh, please, Father.

969

970
01:25:02,034 --> 01:25:04,195
-你为何不告诉我？ -什么？
- Why didn't you tell me? - What?

971
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:06,767
带我的口琴来

我有个好主意

让此屋中充满音乐

1002

你要为我开个盛大的舞会
You must give a grand and glorious party for me.

1003
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:37,716
-派对？ -是的，好吧，爸爸！
- A party? - Yes, Father, please!

1004
01:27:37,923 --> 01:27:40,289
我想我该认识 你在萨尔斯堡的朋友了
It's high time I met all your friends...

1005
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:43,083
你不同意吗？

-我明白你的意思 -好吧，爸爸！

1013
01:28:38,517 --> 01:28:41,145
-舰长 -你好，吉勒先生，男爵夫人

你好
How do you do? Good evening.

1016
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,316
我想你注意到大厅上当眼处 挂着奥地利国旗
Did you notice the obvious display of the Austrian flag?

1017
01:29:19,391 --> 01:29:21,188
女人们看来好漂亮
The women look so beautiful.

1018
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:22,791
我觉得她们好丑
I think they look ugly.

1019
01:29:23,061 --> 01:29:24,892
你这样说是因为你怕她们
You're just scared of them.

1020
01:29:25,130 --> 01:29:27,360
傻瓜！只有成人才会怕女人
Silly, only grown-up men fear women.

1021
01:29:27,966 --> 01:29:31,527
-我认为男人看来好美 -你怎么会知道？
- I think the men look beautiful. - How would you know?

1022
01:29:49,172 --> 01:29:51,197
莉莎，你在跟谁跳舞？
Liesl, who are you dancing with?

1023
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:53,035
没有人
Nobody.

1024
01:29:53,844 --> 01:29:55,744
哦，的确没有

1025
01:29:58,215 --> 01:29:59,705
我有这份荣幸吗？
May I have this dance?

1026
01:29:59,916 --> 01:30:02,407
我很乐意的，年轻人
I'd be delighted, young man.

1027
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:11,854
你们为何不告诉我 你们会跳舞？
Why didn't you tell me you could dance?

1028
01:30:12,095 --> 01:30:17,032
我们怕你会叫我们一起跳舞 范崔普家庭舞蹈团
We feared you'd make us all dance. The von Trapp Family Dancers.

1029
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:23,133
他们在演奏什么？
What are they playing?

1030
01:30:23,373 --> 01:30:26,001
那是奥地利的一种民俗舞曲
It's the Laendler. An Austrian folk dance.

1031
01:30:26,209 --> 01:30:29,372
-教我们 -我很久没跳过了
- Show me. - I haven't danced since I was little.

1032
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:31,547
你记得的，求求你
You remember. Please?

1033
01:30:31,815 --> 01:30:33,749
-这个… -拜托嘛
- Well... - Please.

1034
01:30:33,984 --> 01:30:36,214
好吧，过来
All right. Come on over here.

1035
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:39,553
现在你鞠躬，我答礼
Now you bow and I curtsy.

1036
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:43,425
-像这样 -很好，现在我们走几步！
- Like this? - Fine. Now we go for a little walk.

1037
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:46,322
1，2，3，1，2，3
One, two, three. One, two, three.

1038
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:51,226
1，2，3，一起踏步 踏步跳…
One, two, three, step together. Now, step hop, step hop.

1039
01:30:51,468 --> 01:30:54,130
转圈
Now turn under. Not quite.

1040
01:30:54,337 --> 01:30:58,296
这边，踏步跳，转圈
This way. Hop step, hop. And under.

1041
01:30:58,975 --> 01:31:00,670
我们要好好练习呢
Kurt, we'll have to practice.

1042
01:31:00,911 --> 01:31:02,401
让我来跳好吗？
Do allow me, will you?

1043
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:32,565
我不记得了
I don't remember anymore.

1044
01:32:34,738 --> 01:32:36,933
-你的脸好红 -是吗？
- Your face is all red. - Is it?

1045
01:32:38,274 --> 01:32:40,367
我想我不习惯跳舞吧
I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.

1046
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:45,070
那真是跳得太棒了
Why, that was beautifully done.

1047
01:32:45,348 --> 01:32:47,248
你们是迷人的一对
What a lovely couple you make.

1048
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:49,577
我想孩子们该上床了
It's time the children said good night.

1049
01:32:49,853 --> 01:32:51,184
我们马上去前厅
We'll be in the hall.

1050
01:32:51,421 --> 01:32:54,288
-我们有特别节目 -是的
- We have something special prepared. - Right!

1051
01:32:54,591 --> 01:32:55,751
是的，快点
Yes, come on!

1052
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:04,931
盖尔，你的担心看来是多余的
All that needless worrying, Georg.

1053
01:33:05,201 --> 01:33:08,227
你还以为自己在 舞会上找不到朋友
You thought you wouldn't find a friend at the party.

1054
01:33:11,141 --> 01:33:14,736
-今晚外面有点凉，是不是？ -不，我不知道
- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it? - Oh, I don't know.

1055
01:33:14,944 --> 01:33:16,969
我觉得颇暖和呢！
It seemed rather warm to me.

1056
01:33:21,151 --> 01:33:22,379
先生女士们！
Ladies and gentlemen.

1057
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,215
范崔普舰长的孩子 希望向各位道晚安！
The children of Captain von Trapp wish to say good night to you.

1058
01:33:41,337 --> 01:33:45,239
忧愁的钟声来自大厅
There's a sad sort of clanging From the clock in the hall

1059
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:49,173
塔尖的钟声也响起了
And the bells in the steeple too

1060
01:33:49,446 --> 01:33:53,473
在孩子们卧室里 一只滑稽的小鸟
And up in the nursery An absurd little bird

1061
01:33:53,683 --> 01:33:56,117
伸出头来道咕咕
Is popping up to say "coo-coo"

1062
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,013
咕咕
Coo-coo

1063
01:33:58,288 --> 01:33:59,516
咕咕
Coo-coo

1064
01:33:59,756 --> 01:34:01,917
很抱歉他告诉我们
Regretfully they tell us

1065
01:34:02,125 --> 01:34:03,490
要我们向大家
But firmly they compel us

1066
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:06,820
道晚安
To say goodbye

1067
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:12,332
向大家
To you

1068
01:34:15,538 --> 01:34:19,440
别了，再见，珍重晚安
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, good night

1069
01:34:19,642 --> 01:34:23,510
我不愿离开如斯美景
I hate to go And leave this pretty sight

1070
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:34,120
别了，再见，珍重再见
So long, farewell, Auf Wiedersehen, adieu

1071
01:34:34,791 --> 01:34:38,318
我向你和你和你说声再见
Adieu, adieu To you and you and you

1072
01:34:45,668 --> 01:34:49,468
别了，再见，珍重再见
So long, farewell Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen

1073
01:34:49,739 --> 01:34:53,675
我能否留下喝第一口香槟？
I'd like to stay And taste my first champagne

1074
01:34:53,910 --> 01:34:56,344
-可以吗？ -不行
- Yes? - No.

1075
01:35:00,683 --> 01:35:04,346
别了，再见，珍重再见
So long, farewell Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1076
01:35:04,687 --> 01:35:08,646
我轻叹着离开并说再见
I leave and heave a sigh And say goodbye

1077
01:35:08,858 --> 01:35:12,851
再见
Goodbye

1078
01:35:15,899 --> 01:35:18,993
我真高兴可以离去
I'm glad to go

1079
01:35:19,235 --> 01:35:22,102
我不能说谎
I cannot tell a lie

1080
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:25,430
我展翅，我飘浮
I flit, I float

1081
01:35:25,708 --> 01:35:29,166
我地消失，我在飞翔
I fleetly flee, I fly

1082
01:35:39,222 --> 01:35:44,956
太阳已就
The sun has gone to bed

1083
01:35:45,195 --> 01:35:48,926
我也一样
And so must I

1084
01:35:49,132 --> 01:35:51,532
别了
So long

1085
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:54,328
再见
Farewell

1086
01:35:54,537 --> 01:35:59,941
珍重晚安
Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye

1087
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:05,546
晚安
Goodbye

1088
01:36:06,249 --> 01:36:11,812
晚安
Goodbye

1089
01:36:12,055 --> 01:36:18,927
晚安
Goodbye

1090
01:36:19,128 --> 01:36:27,627
晚安
Goodbye

1091
01:36:32,642 --> 01:36:35,406
他们真是不同凡响 想想在音乐节的成绩
Extraordinary! What they'd do at the festival.

1092
01:36:35,645 --> 01:36:38,136
年轻女士，我必须跟你谈谈
Young lady, I must have a word with you.

1093
01:36:39,148 --> 01:36:43,141
盖尔，你不能让她离去的 她必须参加派对
Georg, you won't let this girl get away. She must join the party.

1094
01:36:43,419 --> 01:36:45,819
-不，我真的… -别说了
- No, really l... - Stop. Stop it now.

1095
01:36:46,089 --> 01:36:49,024
-盖尔，拜托 -如你愿意的话，可以留下来
- Georg, please. - You can if you want to, fraulein.

1096
01:36:49,259 --> 01:36:51,750
我坚持，你会是我今晚的女伴
I insist. You will be my dinner partner.

1097
01:36:51,961 --> 01:36:53,861
这是生意 福兰斯…
This is business. Franz...

1098
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:57,293
在我的座位旁 替犸莉亚小姐加一个位子
...set another place next to mine for Fraulein Maria.

1099
01:36:59,469 --> 01:37:02,199
-悉听尊便 -似乎已安排好了
- Whatever you say. - It appears to be all arranged.

1100
01:37:03,006 --> 01:37:04,871
-是的 -我的打扮不适合
- It does. - I'm not suitably dressed.

1101
01:37:05,942 --> 01:37:07,432
你可以换衣服，我们等你
You can change. We'll wait.

1102
01:37:11,047 --> 01:37:13,982
舰长，你一定 很以你的儿女为荣
Captain, you must be very proud of your youngsters.

1103
01:37:14,183 --> 01:37:15,047
是的，谢谢你
I am, thank you.

1104
01:37:15,318 --> 01:37:19,880
还有什么比孩子们纯真的歌声
Is there a more beautiful expression of what is good in our country...

1105
01:37:20,123 --> 01:37:23,559
更能表现我国的优点？
...than the innocent voices of our children?

1106
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,325
对了，男爵
Oh, come now, baron.

1107
01:37:25,561 --> 01:37:29,327
你想要我们相信 只有奥地利有独特高尚的品德？
Would you have us believe that Austria holds a monopoly on virtue?

1108
01:37:30,233 --> 01:37:34,363
我们有些人喜欢 悠扬的奥地利歌声
Herr Zeller, some of us prefer Austrian voices raised in song...

1109
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:36,970
多于丑陋的德国威胁
...to ugly German threats.

1110
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:41,670
鸵鸟喜欢埋首于沙中
The ostrich buries his head in the sand...

1111
01:37:41,878 --> 01:37:44,813
有时藏于国旗里
...and sometimes in the flag.

1112
01:37:45,348 --> 01:37:49,546
或许有些人警告过你合并就要 来临了，而事实上是的
Perhaps those who would warn you that the Anschluss is coming, and it is...

1113
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:53,516
或许会以音乐来跟你打交道呢
...would get further with you by setting their words to music.

1114
01:37:53,723 --> 01:37:58,387
如果纳粹占据奥地利 你肯定会是整个小号队
If the Nazis take over Austria, you will be the entire trumpet section.

1115
01:37:58,695 --> 01:37:59,719
你太恭维我了
You flatter me.

1116
01:38:00,763 --> 01:38:04,665
我真笨拙 我是要指责你的
Oh, how clumsy of me. I meant to accuse you.

1117
01:38:12,408 --> 01:38:14,899
你愿意来协助我 真的太仁慈了，男爵夫人
It's very kind of you to offer to help me, baroness.

1118
01:38:15,178 --> 01:38:16,736
我很乐意
I'm delighted, Maria.

1119
01:38:17,213 --> 01:38:20,910
但我实在没有任何合适的衣服
I really don't think I have anything that would be appropriate.

1120
01:38:21,384 --> 01:38:25,514
那晚你穿的那件迷人衣服呢？
Now where is that lovely little thing you were wearing the other evening?

1121
01:38:25,755 --> 01:38:29,054
使舰长无法将视线从你身上移开
When the captain couldn't keep his eyes off you.

1122
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:34,259
无法转移他的目光？
Couldn't keep his eyes off me?

1123
01:38:35,598 --> 01:38:37,395
算了吧，亲爱的，我们都是女人
Come, my dear, we are women.

1124
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:41,034
别再假装我们不知道 男人在注意我们
Let's not pretend we don't know when a man notices us.

1125
01:38:41,270 --> 01:38:44,706
-找到了 -舰长他注意到每个人
- Here we are. - The captain notices everybody.

1126
01:38:45,274 --> 01:38:47,708
你无需如此抗拒的，犸莉亚
There's no need to feel so defensive, Maria.

1127
01:38:47,944 --> 01:38:50,412
你很迷人，你知道吗？
You are quite attractive, you know.

1128
01:38:50,646 --> 01:38:54,275
如果舰长不注意你的话 他就不是男人了
The captain would hardly be a man if he didn't notice you.

1129
01:38:55,885 --> 01:38:58,251
男爵夫人，我希望你在开玩笑
Baroness, I hope you're joking.

1130
01:38:58,721 --> 01:38:59,983
一点也不
Not at all.

1131
01:39:00,223 --> 01:39:01,815
但我从没做过任何…
I've never done a thing to...

1132
01:39:02,091 --> 01:39:03,649
你无需如此
You don't have to, my dear.

1133
01:39:04,293 --> 01:39:09,128
对男人而言，没什么比 深爱自己的女人更无法抗拒
Nothing's more irresistible to a man than a woman who's in love with him.

1134
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,834
-爱他吗？ -是的
- In love with him? - Of course.

1135
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:17,171
最棒的是他也认为自己爱上你了
What makes it so nice is he thinks he's in love with you.

1136
01:39:19,909 --> 01:39:21,501
但那不是事实
But that's not true.

1137
01:39:21,911 --> 01:39:25,403
你当然也注意到 他直视你双眼时的神情吧
Surely you've noticed the way he looks into your eyes.

1138
01:39:25,681 --> 01:39:30,584
而刚才当他拥着你跳舞时 你脸红了
And you know, you blushed in his arms when you were dancing just now.

1139
01:39:31,821 --> 01:39:33,516
别太介意
Don't take it to heart.

1140
01:39:33,790 --> 01:39:36,088
他很快就会适应的
He'll get over it soon enough, I think.

1141
01:39:36,359 --> 01:39:38,327
男人都是如此的
Men do, you know.

1142
01:39:39,328 --> 01:39:40,420
那我必须离开了
Then I should go.

1143
01:39:41,764 --> 01:39:43,197
我不能留在此地
I mustn't stay here.

1144
01:39:53,676 --> 01:39:57,112
-我能帮什么忙吗？ -没有
- Is there something I can do to help? - No, nothing.

1145
01:39:58,881 --> 01:40:00,109
有的
Yes.

1146
01:40:01,117 --> 01:40:03,142
求你别告诉舰长这件事
Don't say a word to the captain.

1147
01:40:04,787 --> 01:40:08,348
不，我不会的
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

1148
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:16,689
再见，犸莉亚
Goodbye, Maria.

1149
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:20,298
我相信你会成为很好的修女
I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.

1150
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:52,324
香槟
Champagne, darling.

1151
01:40:52,735 --> 01:40:56,728
我觉得该庆祝一下，干杯
I feel like celebrating. Cheers.

1152
01:41:02,211 --> 01:41:05,112
-你知道什么吧 -或许吧
- You know something. - Perhaps.

1153
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:09,876
若你如此聪明 告诉我如何令犸莉亚影响盖尔
If you're so clever, tell me how to get fraulein to influence Georg.

1154
01:41:10,119 --> 01:41:12,747
我要这些孩子参加音乐节
I want those children in the festival.

1155
01:41:13,222 --> 01:41:15,520
这对奥地利深具意义
Elsa, this is important to Austria.

1156
01:41:15,725 --> 01:41:17,420
对你也不会有妨害的
Wouldn't do you any harm either.

1157
01:41:17,627 --> 01:41:19,219
我曾想过
I thought of that.

1158
01:41:19,462 --> 01:41:21,930
谈到影响
Well, if it's a matter of influence...

1159
01:41:22,131 --> 01:41:25,032
你该找我谈才对
...maybe the one you have to be talking to is me.

1160
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:57,381
-2 -3
- Two. - Three.

1161
01:44:57,654 --> 01:44:59,144
-4 -5
- Four. - Five.

1162
01:45:00,423 --> 01:45:02,448
-6 -7
- Six. - Seven.

1163
01:45:02,725 --> 01:45:04,352

Eight.

1164
01:45:04,594 --> 01:45:06,425
-4 -2
- Four. - Two.

1165
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:09,361
-7 -5
- Seven. - Five.

1166
01:45:09,599 --> 01:45:11,794
-2 -6
- Two. - Six.

1167
01:45:16,439 --> 01:45:18,464
真好玩！
Isn't this fun?

1168
01:45:19,876 --> 01:45:22,208
-4 -我是5号
- Four. - I'm number five.

1169
01:45:22,478 --> 01:45:24,639
-是的 -8
- Oh, yes. - Eight.

1170
01:45:24,948 --> 01:45:27,314
-2 -4
- Two. - Four.

1171
01:45:27,717 --> 01:45:28,945

Six.

1172
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:32,649

Two.

1173
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:36,759
男爵夫人，我们累了 不要玩了
Baroness Schraeder, do you mind if we stop now? We're tired.

1174
01:45:36,993 --> 01:45:38,961
随便你们
Whatever you want, dear.

1175
01:45:39,229 --> 01:45:41,220
明天再玩
We'll do it again tomorrow.

1176
01:45:51,407 --> 01:45:53,568
乡间真安静，是不是？
The country's so restful, isn't it?

1177
01:45:54,611 --> 01:45:56,238
喝点柠檬水吧
Have some lemonade.

1178
01:45:57,480 --> 01:45:58,913
一定有更容易的办法
There must be an easier way.

1179
01:46:00,316 --> 01:46:03,581
想到你做七个孩子的母亲 真令我哭笑不得
I get a fiendish delight thinking of you as the mother of seven.

1180
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:06,351
你计划如何做呢？
How do you plan to do it?

1181
01:46:06,623 --> 01:46:08,648
你没听过
Darling, haven't you ever heard...

1182
01:46:08,925 --> 01:46:12,019
寄宿学校吗？
...of a delightful little thing called boarding school?

1183
01:46:13,162 --> 01:46:15,426
你真是诡计多端
Baroness Machiavelli.

1184
01:46:16,766 --> 01:46:18,757
麦伯伯，爸爸在哪？
Uncle Max, where's Father?

1185
01:46:19,035 --> 01:46:20,832
我想他在屋子里
I think he's in the house.

1186
01:46:21,037 --> 01:46:23,597
你们为何都闷闷不乐呢？
What's the matter with all you gloomy pussies?

1187
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,638
-没什么 -我知道怎么办，我们来做排练
- Nothing. - I know. Let's have a rehearsal.

1188
01:46:26,843 --> 01:46:27,741
为了什么呢？
What for?

1189
01:46:27,944 --> 01:46:30,435
假装站在节庆的表演台上
Let's make believe we're on-stage at the festival.

1190
01:46:30,647 --> 01:46:34,515
-我不想唱 -没有犸莉亚我不想唱
- I don't feel like singing. - Not without Fraulein Maria.

1191
01:46:34,784 --> 01:46:37,184
莉莎去拿吉他，来吧
Liesl, get the guitar. Come on, Marta.

1192
01:46:37,387 --> 01:46:40,356
大家站好，各就各位
Everybody into the group. Get in your places.

1193
01:46:40,623 --> 01:46:43,387
高兴点 丽莎，给我们调子
Now be cheerful, right? Give us the key, Liesl.

1194
01:46:45,295 --> 01:46:47,957
现在，开始
Now, impress me.

1195
01:46:51,968 --> 01:46:53,299
葛特儿，你为何不唱呢？
Gretl, why don't you sing?

1196
01:46:53,569 --> 01:46:56,037
我手指痛不能唱
I can't. I've got a sore finger.

1197
01:46:57,073 --> 01:47:00,133
但是你在舞会中唱得很好
But you sang so beautifully the night of the party.

1198
01:47:00,343 --> 01:47:02,675
来，试试看 唱些你们都懂的
Come on, all of you. Try something you know.

1199
01:47:02,912 --> 01:47:04,402
好好享受，快乐些
Enjoy it. Be cheerful.

1200
01:47:04,681 --> 01:47:06,308
好了，莉莎
All right, Liesl.

1201
01:47:08,251 --> 01:47:13,655
群山因为音乐
The hills are alive

1202
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:21,558
充满生气
With the sound of music

1203
01:47:22,765 --> 01:47:27,828
唱了
With songs they have sung

1204
01:47:28,071 --> 01:47:35,910
千年的歌
For a thousand years

1205
01:47:36,612 --> 01:47:42,016
群山让我的心中
The hills fill my heart

1206
01:47:42,251 --> 01:47:49,953
充满了音乐
With the sound of music

1207
01:47:50,293 --> 01:47:52,921
他们是唱给我听
They wanted to sing for me, bless their hearts.

1208
01:47:53,229 --> 01:47:55,129
很好…别停下来
That's lovely, lovely. Don't stop.

1209
01:47:59,135 --> 01:48:03,037
-你喝点饮料吧 -不，谢谢，亲爱的
- Something long and cool, Georg? - No, thank you, darling.

1210
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:05,873
-爸爸 -是的，碧姬塔
- Father? - Yes, Brigitta?

1211
01:48:06,309 --> 01:48:08,573
犸莉亚不回来吗？
Is it true Fraulein Maria isn't coming back?

1212
01:48:08,878 --> 01:48:11,972
是的，我想是不回来了 有什么好喝吗？
Yes, I suppose it's true. What have we got here?

1213
01:48:12,281 --> 01:48:16,980
-粉红柠檬水 -是柠檬水
- Pink lemonade. - Laced with lemonade.

1214
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:19,244
父亲，我不敢相信
I don't believe it, Father.

1215
01:48:20,623 --> 01:48:22,648
-不相信什么？ -关于犸莉亚
- What? - About Fraulein Maria.

1216
01:48:23,059 --> 01:48:24,287
哦，犸莉亚
Oh, Fraulein Maria!

1217
01:48:24,594 --> 01:48:28,052
我没把她的留言告诉你们吗？ 我肯定我说过了
Didn't I tell you what her note said? I'm sure I did.

1218
01:48:28,798 --> 01:48:31,289
她说她很怀念修道院的生活
She said she missed her life at the abbey.

1219
01:48:31,567 --> 01:48:33,728
她必须离开我们
She had to leave us.

1220
01:48:33,970 --> 01:48:35,562
就这样
And that's all there is to it.

1221
01:48:37,273 --> 01:48:39,969
好，我现在想尝点柠檬水
I think I'm brave enough to try some of that.

1222
01:48:40,176 --> 01:48:42,906
-她甚至没有告别 -她在留言上有说
- She didn't even say goodbye. - She did in her note.

1223
01:48:43,179 --> 01:48:44,976
那是不同的事
That isn't the same thing.

1224
01:48:45,281 --> 01:48:46,908
不甜不酸
Not too sweet, not too sour.

1225
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:49,641
只是太粉红了
Just too pink.

1226
01:48:51,087 --> 01:48:54,181
父亲，谁是我们的新家庭老师？
Father, who is our new governess going to be?

1227
01:49:00,830 --> 01:49:01,922
这个…
Well...

1228
01:49:04,267 --> 01:49:09,500
你们再也没有新家庭老师了
...you're not going to have a governess anymore.

1229
01:49:09,839 --> 01:49:12,501
-我们没有？ -没有
- We're not? - No.

1230
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:16,837
你们将要有个新妈妈
You're going to have a new mother.

1231
01:49:17,947 --> 01:49:19,972
一个新妈妈？
A new mother?

1232
01:49:20,817 --> 01:49:23,945
我们昨晚谈过了 一切都决定好了
We talked about it last night. It's all settled.

1233
01:49:24,153 --> 01:49:26,849
我们都将会很快乐
And we're all going to be very happy.

1234
01:49:59,856 --> 01:50:02,324
好了…去玩吧
Well, all right, all right. Run off and play.

1235
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:35,257
是的，孩子们
Yes, my children?

1236
01:50:35,458 --> 01:50:37,858
-我叫莉莎 -怎么了，丽莎？
- My name is Liesl. - Yes, Liesl?

1237
01:50:38,361 --> 01:50:42,297
我们，我的兄弟姐妹们 要见犸莉亚小姐
We, my brothers and sisters, want to see Fraulein Maria.

1238
01:50:43,466 --> 01:50:45,457
犸莉亚小姐？
Fraulein Maria?

1239
01:50:46,235 --> 01:50:48,203
哦，犸莉亚
Oh, Maria.

1240
01:50:50,106 --> 01:50:51,937
请进来
Come in, please.

1241
01:50:55,811 --> 01:50:57,369
在此等一下
Wait here.

1242
01:51:08,324 --> 01:51:11,487
我是犸格丽特修女 我知道你们想见犸莉亚
I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand you inquired about Maria.

1243
01:51:11,761 --> 01:51:14,252
我们必须见她 请你告诉她我们在此
We have to see her. Will you tell her we're here?

1244
01:51:14,497 --> 01:51:17,091
-恐怕我做不到 -你一定要告诉她
- I'm afraid I can't do that. - But you've got to!

1245
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,459
-她是我们的家庭教师 -我们要她回来
- She's our governess. - We want her back.

1246
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:21,569
她甚至没有道别
She didn't even say goodbye.

1247
01:51:21,804 --> 01:51:23,567
我们想要做的只是和她说话
All we want to do is talk to her.

1248
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:27,241
我很抱歉，孩子们 但是犸莉亚在静修
I'm very sorry, but Maria is in seclusion.

1249
01:51:27,476 --> 01:51:30,570
-她不愿见任何人 -她会见我们的
- She hasn't been seeing anyone. - She'll see us.

1250
01:51:30,813 --> 01:51:33,304
我要让她看我的手指
I want to show her my finger.

1251
01:51:33,516 --> 01:51:35,416
亲爱的，改天吧
Some other time, dear.

1252
01:51:35,685 --> 01:51:36,982
我会告诉她，你们来过
I'll tell her you were here.

1253
01:51:37,253 --> 01:51:40,313
-很高兴你们来过 -我们要见犸莉亚
- It was sweet of you to call. - We have to speak to her!

1254
01:51:40,957 --> 01:51:44,085
孩子们，回家吧
Run along, children. Run along home.

1255
01:51:44,293 --> 01:51:45,920
我肯定她会见我们
I'm sure she'd like to see us.

1256
01:51:46,195 --> 01:51:48,459
求求你啊
Sister Margaretta, please.

1257
01:51:48,698 --> 01:51:52,429
-再见，孩子们 -求求你啊
- Goodbye, children. - Sister Margaretta, may we, please?

1258
01:51:55,204 --> 01:51:56,933
那是怎么回事，犸格丽特修女？
What was that about, Sister?

1259
01:51:57,173 --> 01:51:59,368
院长，范崔普家的孩子
The von Trapp children, Reverend Mother.

1260
01:51:59,609 --> 01:52:02,043
他们要见犸莉亚
They want to see Maria.

1261
01:52:02,311 --> 01:52:04,609
她说了没？ 她有没有告诉你什么事？
Has she spoken yet? Has she told you anything?

1262
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,873
院长，除了祈祷外 她什么也没说
She doesn't say a word, Reverend Mother, except in prayer.

1263
01:52:09,151 --> 01:52:10,140
可怜的孩子
Poor child.

1264
01:52:10,353 --> 01:52:13,322
很奇怪，她似乎很高兴能回来
It's strange. She seems happy to be back here...

1265
01:52:13,556 --> 01:52:16,855
但同时又很不快乐
...and yet she's unhappy too.

1266
01:52:18,127 --> 01:52:21,187
或许让她一个人那么久 是错误的
Perhaps I have been wrong in leaving her alone so long.

1267
01:52:21,464 --> 01:52:24,160
我想你最好把她带来见我 即使她还没准备好
Bring her to me, even if she's not yet ready.

1268
01:52:24,367 --> 01:52:26,028
是的，院长
Yes, Reverend Mother.

1269
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:35,032
加丝特修女 带这位新姐妹到更衣室
Sister Augusta, take our new postulant to the robing room.

1270
01:52:36,045 --> 01:52:38,309
愿上帝祝福你，我的女儿
God bless you, my daughter.

1271
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,249
是的，带她进来
Yes, bring her in.

1272
01:52:55,264 --> 01:52:57,528
你很不快乐，我很难过
You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.

1273
01:52:59,568 --> 01:53:00,762
院长
Reverend Mother.

1274
01:53:01,103 --> 01:53:03,731
他们为何要你回来？
Why did they send you back to us?

1275
01:53:04,573 --> 01:53:06,541
他们没有要我走 是我主动离开的
They didn't send me back. I left.

1276
01:53:09,045 --> 01:53:10,603
坐下，犸莉亚
Sit down, Maria.

1277
01:53:11,113 --> 01:53:12,910
告诉我事情的始末
Tell me what happened.

1278
01:53:18,120 --> 01:53:19,451
是因为我害怕
I was frightened.

1279
01:53:19,722 --> 01:53:24,182
-害怕，是不是他们对你不好？ -哦，不是
- Frightened? Were they unkind to you. - Oh, no!

1280
01:53:24,427 --> 01:53:28,124
我很迷惑，我…
No, I was confused. I felt...

1281
01:53:29,598 --> 01:53:31,691
我从未有那种感觉
I've never felt that way before.

1282
01:53:31,934 --> 01:53:35,700
我不能留下来 我知道远离他们会比较安全
I couldn't stay. I knew that here I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.

1283
01:53:35,938 --> 01:53:40,637
犸莉亚，我们的修道院 不是用来逃避的
Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape.

1284
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:43,140
是什么事令你无法面对？
What is it you can't face?

1285
01:53:45,114 --> 01:53:46,547
我无法再面对他
I can't face him again.

1286
01:53:47,383 --> 01:53:48,907
他？
Him?

1287
01:53:50,486 --> 01:53:52,545
谢谢你，犸格丽特修女
Thank you, Sister Margaretta.

1288
01:54:02,164 --> 01:54:03,791
是范崔普先生？
Captain von Trapp?

1289
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:11,934
-你是否爱上他了？ -我不知道
- Are you in love with him? - I don't know!

1290
01:54:12,174 --> 01:54:13,641
我不知道…
I don't know. L...

1291
01:54:14,176 --> 01:54:18,010
男爵夫人，她说他爱上我了
The baroness said I was. She said that he was in love with me.

1292
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,942
但我不愿相信
But I didn't want to believe it.

1293
01:54:22,017 --> 01:54:24,315
当我们彼此对看时
There were times we looked at each other.

1294
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:26,078
我简直不能呼吸
I could hardly breathe.

1295
01:54:26,455 --> 01:54:29,151
-你让他知道你的感受了吗？ -我不知道
- Did you let him see your feelings? - I don't know.

1296
01:54:29,759 --> 01:54:32,421
这正是折磨我的原因 我是侍奉神的
That's what's torturing me. I was on God's errand.

1297
01:54:32,628 --> 01:54:37,622
爱他是错的，我不能留下
To have asked for his love would have been wrong. I just couldn't stay.

1298
01:54:39,802 --> 01:54:42,600
我已作好发誓的准备
I'm ready at this moment to take my vows.

1299
01:54:43,472 --> 01:54:46,532
-请帮助我 -犸莉亚
- Please help me. - Maria.

1300
01:54:48,110 --> 01:54:52,809
男女之间的爱也是神圣的 你是可以去爱的
The love of a man and a woman is holy. You have a great capacity to love.

1301
01:54:53,048 --> 01:54:55,983
你必须了解 上帝是要你如何去爱
You must find out how God wants you to spend your love.

1302
01:54:56,285 --> 01:55:00,119
但我已献身上帝 我要终生为上帝服务
But I pledged my life to God. I pledged my life to his service.

1303
01:55:00,322 --> 01:55:04,691
我的女儿，如果你爱这个人 并不表示你就要少爱上帝了
My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less.

1304
01:55:06,362 --> 01:55:08,227
不
No.

1305
01:55:08,464 --> 01:55:10,329
你必须找出答案
You must find out.

1306
01:55:12,067 --> 01:55:14,558
你必须要回去
You must go back.

1307
01:55:14,837 --> 01:55:16,805
你不能要求我这样做
You can't ask me to do that.

1308
01:55:17,006 --> 01:55:19,497
-拜托你，让我留下，我求求你 -犸莉亚
- Please let me stay. I beg... - Maria.

1309
01:55:19,708 --> 01:55:23,667
这些墙并不是 建造来逃避问题的
These walls were not built to shut out problems.

1310
01:55:23,879 --> 01:55:25,471
你必须面对它
You have to face them.

1311
01:55:26,048 --> 01:55:29,313
你要过你本来就应过的生活
You have to live the life you were born to live.

1312
01:55:35,191 --> 01:55:39,491
攀登每座山
Climb every mountain

1313
01:55:39,728 --> 01:55:43,494
寻遍高与低
Search high and low

1314
01:55:43,732 --> 01:55:48,499
踏遍每条僻路
Follow every byway

1315
01:55:48,737 --> 01:55:53,003
踏遍每条路

1316
01:55:53,442 --> 01:55:57,902

1318
01:56:02,751 --> 01:56:07,120
跟随每道彩虹
Follow every rainbow

1319
01:56:07,389 --> 01:56:11,723
直至找到你的美梦
Till you find your dream

1320
01:56:11,927 --> 01:56:15,021
这美梦需要你
A dream that will need

1321
01:56:15,264 --> 01:56:20,099
献出全部的爱
All the love you can give

1322
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:24,271
在你有生之年
Every day of your life

1323
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:30,945
一直下去
For as long as you live

1324
01:56:31,247 --> 01:56:35,547
攀登每座山
Climb every mountain

1325
01:56:35,784 --> 01:56:40,118

Every day of your life

1331
01:57:08,017 --> 01:57:14,445

01:57:45,888 --> 01:57:49,449
这样神神秘秘的 不像我的孩子
Now, it's not like my children to be secretive.

1338
01:57:49,692 --> 01:57:51,785
我们才不神秘，爸爸
We're not being secretive, Father.

1339
01:57:53,462 --> 01:57:56,795
吃饭迟到也不像我的孩子
And it's not like my children to be late for dinner.

1340
01:57:57,066 --> 01:58:00,502
-我们忘了时间而已 -我知道了
- We lost track of the time. - I see.

1341
01:58:01,303 --> 01:58:04,704
好了，谁要第一个告诉我事实？ 费瑞克
Who's going to be the first one to tell me the truth? Friedrich.

1342
01:58:04,974 --> 01:58:07,033
碧姬塔，莉莎
Brigitta. Liesl.

1343
01:58:08,410 --> 01:58:10,640
你认为我们去哪了？
Where do you think we were, Father?

1344
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:21,178
如果你不相信我们 你一定是对于我们去哪有点头绪吧
If you don't believe us, you must have some idea of where you think we were.

1345
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:26,557
-犸塔 -是的，爸爸
- Marta. - Yes, Father.

1346
01:58:26,762 --> 01:58:28,024
你来告诉我
You tell me.

1347
01:58:29,365 --> 01:58:32,994
费瑞克告诉过你，爸爸 我们去采草莓了
Friedrich told you, Father. We were berry picking.

1348
01:58:33,836 --> 01:58:38,500
-我忘了！你们去采草莓 -是呀，我们很喜欢采草莓
- I forgot! You were berry picking. - Yes, we love berry picking.

1349
01:58:38,741 --> 01:58:39,833
整个下午？
All afternoon?

1350
01:58:40,075 --> 01:58:41,804
-是的，我们采了几千颗 -几千颗？
- We picked thousands. - Thousands?

1351
01:58:42,011 --> 01:58:44,912
-四处也是呢 -哪一种草莓？
- They were all over the place. - What kind of berries?

1352
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:48,445
-是蓝草莓，先生 -蓝草莓
- Blueberries, sir. - Blueberries.

1353
01:58:50,386 --> 01:58:53,753
蓝草莓的季节还没到
It's too early for blueberries.

1354
01:58:55,257 --> 01:58:57,350
-是草莓 -草莓？
- They were strawberries. - Strawberries?

1355
01:58:58,060 --> 01:59:00,756
最近很冷 所以它们变成蓝色了
It's been so cold lately, they turned blue.

1356
01:59:06,602 --> 01:59:08,763
很好，让我看草莓
Very well. Show me the berries.

1357
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:11,233
-我们… -这个…
- We... - Well...

1358
01:59:11,473 --> 01:59:14,237
-快让我看草莓 -我们没有
- Show me the berries you picked. - We don't have them.

1359
01:59:14,476 --> 01:59:16,740
你们没有？发生了什么事？
You don't have them? What happened to them?

1360
01:59:16,979 --> 01:59:19,777
-我们… -我们吃了
- We... - We ate them.

1361
01:59:19,982 --> 01:59:22,576
-你们吃了它们？ -是啊
- You ate them? - Yes!

1362
01:59:22,785 --> 01:59:24,377
-它们很好吃 -很好吃
- They were so good. - Delicious.

1363
01:59:24,620 --> 01:59:25,814
非常好
Very well.

1364
01:59:26,088 --> 01:59:31,219
既然你们吃了几千颗的草莓
Since you've obviously stuffed yourselves on thousands of berries...

1365
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:35,396
你们不可能肚子饿了 所以我可以告诉思蜜德
...you can't be hungry anymore, so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...

1366
01:59:35,631 --> 01:59:38,498
不用煮你们的晚餐
...to skip your dinner.

1367
01:59:47,676 --> 01:59:50,474
都是你的错 我们应该老实告诉他
It's your fault. We should have told him the truth.

1368
01:59:50,746 --> 01:59:52,714
让他生我们的气吗？
And made him boiling mad at us?

1369
01:59:52,915 --> 01:59:54,849
总比饿死好
It's better than starving to death.

1370
01:59:55,084 --> 01:59:57,951
我们没有做错什么 我们只是想见她
We didn't do anything wrong. We just wanted to see her.

1371
01:59:59,254 --> 02:00:02,348
我的肚子在咕咕叫
My stomach's making noises.

1372
02:00:02,791 --> 02:00:05,624
他们至少可以 让我们向她打个招呼
The least they could have done was to let us say hello.

1373
02:00:06,762 --> 02:00:10,664
-我们不如吃草吧 -我很不开心
- I wonder what grass tastes like. - I feel awful.

1374
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:15,366
犸莉亚不开心时便会唱那首歌 让自己心情好转的
When Fraulein Maria wanted to feel better she used to sing that song.

1375
02:00:15,971 --> 02:00:17,438
我们唱唱看
Let's try it.

1376
02:00:17,673 --> 02:00:20,335
玫瑰上的雨露
Raindrops on roses

1377
02:00:20,642 --> 02:00:24,669
小猫的胡须
And whiskers on kittens

1378
02:00:25,514 --> 02:00:28,108
光亮的铜壶
Bright copper kettles

1379
02:00:28,317 --> 02:00:31,377
温暖的羊毛手套
And warm woolen mittens

1380
02:00:32,721 --> 02:00:38,682
有细绳的褐色包装纸
Brown paper packages Tied up with strings

1381
02:00:38,961 --> 02:00:44,957
这些都是我心爱的事物
These are a few of my favorite things

1382
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:47,225
为什么我的心情没有好起来？
Why don't I feel better?

1383
02:00:48,403 --> 02:00:50,701
女孩们穿着白裙
Girls in white dresses

1384
02:00:50,973 --> 02:00:54,067
佩着蓝缎带
With blue satin sashes

1385
02:00:54,343 --> 02:00:59,975
雪花落在我的鼻子和睫毛上
Snowflakes that stay On my nose and eyelashes

1386
02:01:00,349 --> 02:01:03,512
-银白色的冬天… -犸莉亚小姐回来了
- Silver white winters... - Fraulein Maria's back!

1387
02:01:03,719 --> 02:01:05,016
溶化成春天
...that melt into springs

1388
02:01:05,420 --> 02:01:08,685
这些都是我喜爱的事物
These are a few of my favorite things

1389
02:01:08,924 --> 02:01:12,018
当狗咬时，当蜂蛰时
When the dog bites When the bee stings

1390
02:01:12,227 --> 02:01:14,354
当我感觉伤心时
When I'm feeling sad

1391
02:01:14,863 --> 02:01:17,832
只要想起我最喜爱的事物
I simply remember my favorite things

1392
02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:20,364
我的心情就不会…
And then I don't feel

1393
02:01:20,569 --> 02:01:27,338
如此糟了
So bad

1394
02:01:27,576 --> 02:01:30,602
-孩子们，看到你们真高兴 -我们很想念你
- Children, I'm so glad to see you. - We missed you.

1395
02:01:30,846 --> 02:01:31,835
我想念你们
I missed you.

1396
02:01:32,114 --> 02:01:34,241
-寇特，你好吗？ -很饿
- Kurt, how are you? - Hungry.

1397
02:01:35,784 --> 02:01:38,412
-葛特儿，你的手指怎么了？ -被割伤了
- What happened to your finger? - It got caught.

1398

-被什么割的？ -费端克的牙齿
- Caught in what? - Friedrich's teeth.

1399
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:44,251
-莉莎，你好吗？ -还好啦
- Liesl, you all right? - Just fair.

1400
02:01:44,459 --> 02:01:47,451
-最近有没有电报来？ -什么都没有
- Any telegrams been delivered lately? - None at all.

1401
02:01:47,696 --> 02:01:51,132
但是我在学习接受现实 我在期待学校开学的日子
But I'm learning to accept it. I'll be glad when school begins.

1402
02:01:51,433 --> 02:01:56,132
莉莎，你不能用学校作为逃避 问题的地方，你必须面对问题
Liesl, you can't use school to escape your problems. You have to face them.

1403
02:01:56,371 --> 02:01:57,804
我要告诉你们很多事
I have so much to tell you.

1404
02:01:58,073 --> 02:02:00,064
我们也有许多事要告诉你
We have things to tell you too.

1405
02:02:00,409 --> 02:02:04,106
最重要的是，爸爸要结婚了
The most important thing is that Father is going to be married.

1406
02:02:04,313 --> 02:02:05,371
结婚？
Married?

1407
02:02:05,714 --> 02:02:07,739
是的，是和男爵夫人
Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.

1408
02:02:15,657 --> 02:02:17,215
哦，我知道了
Oh, I see.

1409
02:02:19,061 --> 02:02:22,428
爸爸，看！ 犸莉亚回来了！
Father, look! Fraulein Maria's back!

1410
02:02:22,664 --> 02:02:24,723
犸莉亚从修道院回来了
Fraulein Maria's back from the abbey.

1411
02:02:26,935 --> 02:02:27,993
舰长你好
Good evening, captain.

1412
02:02:29,471 --> 02:02:30,768
你好
Good evening.

1413
02:02:33,308 --> 02:02:35,139
大家都进去吃晚餐
Everyone inside for dinner.

1414
02:02:35,444 --> 02:02:37,002
晚饭，太好了！
Dinner!

1415
02:02:46,355 --> 02:02:51,088
你不辞而别 甚至没向小孩们道别
You left without saying goodbye. Even to the children.

1416
02:02:52,094 --> 02:02:53,618
是我的错，请原谅我
It was wrong of me. Forgive me.

1417
02:02:55,664 --> 02:02:56,824
为什么要如此？
Why did you?

1418
02:02:57,032 --> 02:02:59,865
请不要问我 反正原因已经不存在了
Please don't ask me. The reason no longer exists.

1419
02:03:01,036 --> 02:03:04,130
犸莉亚小姐，你回来了
Fraulein Maria, you've returned.

1420
02:03:05,374 --> 02:03:07,171
盖尔，这不是很好吗？
Isn't it wonderful, Georg?

1421
02:03:10,479 --> 02:03:12,709
男爵夫人，我祝福你幸福快乐
I wish you every happiness, baroness.

1422
02:03:12,948 --> 02:03:15,644
你也是，舰长 孩子们告诉我你们要结婚了
You too, captain. The children say you're to marry.

1423
02:03:15,884 --> 02:03:17,010
谢谢你，亲爱的
Thank you, my dear.

1424
02:03:19,554 --> 02:03:23,115
你会留下吗？
You are back to stay?

1425
02:03:25,193 --> 02:03:28,526
只待到下一位老师来为止
Only until arrangements can be made for another governess.

1426
02:04:24,219 --> 02:04:25,846
原来你在这里
There you are.

1427
02:04:40,235 --> 02:04:42,703
我真的要跟你的厨师谈谈
I must speak to cook about the schnitzel.

1428
02:04:42,971 --> 02:04:46,270
食物太好吃会影响我的身材
It is entirely too delicious for my figure.

1429
02:04:46,708 --> 02:04:49,643
也让你在餐桌上 没说很多话
And it makes you much too quiet at the dinner table.

1430
02:04:49,911 --> 02:04:51,902
是不是酒的关系？
Or was it the wine?

1431
02:04:52,147 --> 02:04:53,978
一定是
Undoubtedly the wine.

1432
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:58,815
你不知道为了要送你
You have no idea the trouble I'm having...

1433
02:04:59,087 --> 02:05:01,817
一件结婚礼物 我费尽了多少心思
...trying to decide on a wedding present for you.

1434
02:05:02,124 --> 02:05:04,285
我明白，你有我已经足够
Oh, I know. I'm enough.

1435
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:08,154
但是我一定要送你点小玩意
But I do want you to have some little trifle for the occasion.

1436
02:05:08,397 --> 02:05:10,729
我首先想到的是钢笔
At first I thought of a fountain pen...

1437
02:05:10,966 --> 02:05:13,230
但是你已有一支
...but you've already got one.

1438
02:05:13,502 --> 02:05:16,437
然后我想送你 一幢法国南部的别墅
Then I thought perhaps a villa in the south of France...

1439
02:05:16,671 --> 02:05:19,333
但是它很难包装起来
...but they are so difficult to gift-wrap.

1440
02:05:19,608 --> 02:05:22,008
你觉得游艇好吗？
Oh, Georg, how do you feel about yachts?

1441
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:24,574
可以畅游地中海的那种
A long, sleek one for the Mediterranean...

1442
02:05:24,813 --> 02:05:27,577
或是放在浴缸中的那种
...or a tiny one for your bathtub, huh?

1443
02:05:29,751 --> 02:05:31,776
-艾莎 -我们要去哪渡蜜月？
- Elsa. - Where to go on our honeymoon?

1444
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:33,612
这可真是个难题了
Now, that's a real problem.

1445
02:05:33,822 --> 02:05:37,189
我想环游世界会很棒
A trip around the world would be lovely. And then I said:

1446
02:05:37,492 --> 02:05:40,325
但一定会有更好的地方可以去
"Oh, Elsa, there must be someplace better to go."

1447
02:05:40,595 --> 02:05:43,029
-但别担心… -艾莎
- But don't worry, darling, I'Il... - Elsa.

1448
02:05:43,698 --> 02:05:44,960
是的
Yes, Georg.

1449
02:05:45,967 --> 02:05:47,298
这是没有用的
It's no use...

1450
02:05:48,503 --> 02:05:49,868
你和我的关系
...you and I.

1451
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:54,671
我一直都没有坦诚面对
I'm being dishonest to both of us...

1452
02:05:56,011 --> 02:05:57,672
你和我的关系
...and utterly unfair to you.

1453
02:06:02,951 --> 02:06:05,681
-当两个人谈论到婚嫁时 -不要
- When two people talk of marriage... - No, don't.

1454
02:06:06,555 --> 02:06:08,648
不要再说了，拜托你
Don't say another word, please.

1455
02:06:11,960 --> 02:06:16,988
我也在想其他的事
You see, there are other things I've been thinking of.

1456
02:06:17,899 --> 02:06:22,632
虽然我喜欢你 但是我真的不认为你适合我
Fond as I am of you, I really don't think you're the right man for me.

1457
02:06:25,173 --> 02:06:27,664
你太独立了
You're much too independent.

1458
02:06:27,976 --> 02:06:32,675
而我要一个非常需要我的人
And I need someone who needs me desperately...

1459
02:06:32,981 --> 02:06:35,973
或最起码是非常需要我的钱
...or at least needs my money desperately.

1460
02:06:38,153 --> 02:06:43,056
我们在一起的每一分钟 我都很快乐，为此我谢谢你
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together and I do thank you for that.

1461
02:06:45,827 --> 02:06:47,727
失陪一下
Now, if you'll forgive me...

1462
02:06:47,929 --> 02:06:49,988
我现在要进去 收拾我的行李
...I'll go inside, pack my little bags...

1463
02:06:50,232 --> 02:06:52,723
回到我原属的地方，维也纳
...and return to Vienna where I belong.

1464
02:06:58,106 --> 02:06:59,937
那边有个人
And somewhere out there...

1465
02:07:00,242 --> 02:07:04,611
是位年轻小姐，我想
...is a young lady who, I think...

1466
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,108
她做不成修女了
...will never be a nun.

1467
02:07:18,260 --> 02:07:20,592
亲爱的，再见了
Auf Wiedersehen, darling.

1468
02:07:46,321 --> 02:07:47,481
哈
Hello.

1469
02:07:53,295 --> 02:07:56,890
我想我可能会在这里找到你
I thought I just might find you here.

1470
02:08:01,069 --> 02:08:03,333
你有什么事找我吗？
Was there something you wanted?

1471
02:08:03,772 --> 02:08:06,900
没有，没有，请坐下
No, no, no. Sit down, please.

1472
02:08:07,842 --> 02:08:09,173
请坐
Please.

1473
02:08:14,316 --> 02:08:15,647
我可以坐吗？
May I?

1474
02:08:28,029 --> 02:08:32,762
我在想… 在思索两件事情
You know, I was thinking and I was wondering two things:

1475
02:08:33,935 --> 02:08:38,167
为什么你逃回修道院？
Why did you run away to the abbey?

1476
02:08:39,007 --> 02:08:43,671
还有，是什么事又让你回来？
And what was it that made you come back?

1477
02:08:45,347 --> 02:08:49,807
这个，我有责任要完成
Well, I had an obligation to fulfill...

1478
02:08:50,018 --> 02:08:52,145
我回来履行的
...and I came back to fulfill it.

1479
02:08:52,787 --> 02:08:54,220
只是这样吗？
Is that all?

1480
02:08:55,557 --> 02:08:57,718
还有，我想念孩子们
And I missed the children.

1481
02:08:58,059 --> 02:08:59,219
是的
Yes.

1482
02:09:00,495 --> 02:09:03,396
-只有小孩们？ -不…是的
- Only the children? - No. Yes.

1483
02:09:03,632 --> 02:09:07,466
-我可以想念他们，对吗？ -对…当然可以了
- Isn't it right that I missed them? - Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

1484
02:09:07,669 --> 02:09:10,297
我只是想你或许会…
I was only hoping that perhaps you...

1485
02:09:11,406 --> 02:09:13,169
或许你会…
Perhaps you might...

1486
02:09:14,909 --> 02:09:16,137
怎样？
Yes?

1487
02:09:17,912 --> 02:09:23,214
这个… 当你离开后一切都变了
Well, nothing was the same when you were away...

1488
02:09:23,985 --> 02:09:27,216
如果你又再离去 我们又会再度失落
...and it'll be all wrong again after you leave...

1489
02:09:27,422 --> 02:09:32,086
我只是想 也许你可以改变心意留下来
...and I just thought perhaps you might change your mind.

1490
02:09:36,164 --> 02:09:40,396
我想男爵夫人一定会把 一切的事情都安排得很好
Well, I'm sure the baroness will be able to make things fine for you.

1491
02:09:40,669 --> 02:09:42,000
犸莉亚
Maria...

1492
02:09:44,105 --> 02:09:47,597
-再也没有什么男爵夫人了 -没有了吗？
- There isn't going to be any baroness. - There isn't?

1493
02:09:50,011 --> 02:09:51,376
没有
No.

1494
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:53,443
我不明白
I don't understand.

1495
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:59,946
我们已经解除婚约了
Well, we've called off our engagement, you see, and...

1496
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:03,679
-我很难过 -对，真的吗？
- Oh, I'm sorry. - Yes. You are?

1497
02:10:04,859 --> 02:10:06,952
-真的？ -是的
- You did? - Yes.

1498
02:10:08,096 --> 02:10:12,624
你不能和一个人结婚…
Well, you can't marry someone when you're...

1499
02:10:15,203 --> 02:10:17,262
却又爱着另一个人
...in love with someone else...

1500
02:10:20,642 --> 02:10:22,075
你可以吗？
...can you?

1501
02:10:56,945 --> 02:10:59,243
院长常说
The Reverend Mother always says:

1502
02:10:59,481 --> 02:11:02,917
“当主关上门时 他会在某处打开窗子的”
"When the Lord closes a door, somewhere He opens a window."

1503
02:11:11,006 --> 02:11:14,032
院长还说了什么？
What else does the Reverend Mother say?

1504
02:11:14,976 --> 02:11:17,376
你需要寻求你自己的生命
That you have to look for your life.

1505
02:11:19,047 --> 02:11:21,607
这是不是你回来的原因？
Is that why you came back?

1506
02:11:25,654 --> 02:11:27,121
你找到了吗？
And have you found it...

1507
02:11:28,123 --> 02:11:29,283
犸莉亚
...Maria?

1508
02:11:31,059 --> 02:11:33,050
我想我找到了
I think I have.

1509
02:11:35,797 --> 02:11:37,196
我知道我已找到了
I know I have.

1510
02:11:39,701 --> 02:11:41,362
我爱你
I love you.

1511
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:47,205
这种事情会发生在我身上吗？
Oh, can this be happening to me?

1512
02:11:50,579 --> 02:11:55,983
或许我的童年是不愉快的
Perhaps I had a wicked childhood

1513
02:11:57,486 --> 02:12:02,719
或许我的青春期是悲惨的
Perhaps I had a miserable youth

1514
02:12:04,593 --> 02:12:10,532
但在我又不愉快 又可悲的过去
But somewhere In my wicked, miserable past

1515
02:12:11,032 --> 02:12:16,834
却总有一刻是真实的
There must have been a moment of truth

1516
02:12:17,772 --> 02:12:24,541
你就站在这里 爱着我
For here you are Standing there loving me

1517
02:12:25,280 --> 02:12:31,276
不管应该与否
Whether or not you should

1518
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:38,723
因此在我的童年或少年时
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1519
02:12:39,594 --> 02:12:47,228
一定是做过了什么好事
I must have done something good

1520
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:51,439
万事皆有因
Nothing comes from nothing

1521
02:12:52,574 --> 02:12:56,442
不会无中生有
Nothing ever could

1522
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:06,153
因此在我的童年或少年时
So somewhere in my youth or childhood

1523
02:13:07,722 --> 02:13:17,222
一定是做过了什么好事
I must have done something good

1524
02:13:18,099 --> 02:13:22,934
你知道我是何时开始 爱上你的？
Do you know when I first started loving you?

1525
02:13:23,338 --> 02:13:27,240
那天晚餐 你坐在那可笑的松果上
That night at dinner, when you sat on that ridiculous pine cone.

1526
02:13:27,475 --> 02:13:28,772
什么？
What?

1527
02:13:30,111 --> 02:13:33,569
当你吹着那个傻哨子时 我就爱上你了
I knew the first time you blew that silly whistle.

1528
02:13:34,482 --> 02:13:36,473
哦，我的爱
Oh, my love.

1529
02:13:40,255 --> 02:13:48,162
你就站在这里 爱着我
For here you are Standing there loving me

1530
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:55,967
不管应该与否

1531
02:13:57,339 --> 02:14:04,370
因此在我的童年或少年时

1534
02:14:18,293 --> 02:14:21,319
不会无中生有
Nothing ever could

1535
02:14:21,563 --> 02:14:27,365
因此在我的童年…
So somewhere in my youth...

1536
02:14:27,636 --> 02:14:29,866
或少年时
...or childhood

一定是做过了

1538

什么好事
Something good

1539
02:15:00,902 --> 02:15:02,426
犸莉亚

1540
02:15:04,272 --> 02:15:08,868
我要征求谁的同意才能娶你？
Is there anyone I should go to, to ask permission to marry you?

1541
02:15:12,781 --> 02:15:15,341
-为什么我们不问… -孩子们？
- Why don't we ask... - The children?

1542
02:17:03,858 --> 02:17:07,885

捣蛋鬼

1546

鬼灵精 小丑

1547

我刚从范崔普家来
I've come from Captain von Trapp's house.

1559
02:20:16,751 --> 02:20:20,346

The only one in the area not flying the Third Reich flag...

1560
02:20:20,588 --> 02:20:21,850
德国旗

管家告诉我会在这找到你
The housekeeper told me that I would find you here.

1563

这是那个女人 给我的唯一情报
The only thing she'd tell me.

1564
02:20:29,897 --> 02:20:32,422
你在找什么情报？

1570
02:20:50,752 --> 02:20:54,449
当他回来时 我们希望他接受新政府的职位
Upon his return, he'll fill his proper position in the new order.

1571

- Why was he so cross? - Everybody's cross these days.

1580
02:21:24,419 --> 02:21:27,786
也许是旗上的黑蜘蛛 使人们紧张起来
Maybe the flag with the black spider makes people nervous.

1581
02:21:27,989 --> 02:21:30,924
-爸爸是不是有麻烦了？ -他是有选择的
- Will Father be in trouble? - He doesn't have to be.

02:22:33,888 --> 02:22:36,220
-这是什么？ -是从柏林来的电报
- What is it? - It's a telegram from Berlin.

1603
02:22:37,058 --> 02:22:39,549
你不要亲自来交给他吗？
Don't you want to deliver it yourself?

1604
02:22:40,027 --> 02:22:42,655
我有更重要的事
I'm occupied with more important matters.

1605
02:22:42,864 --> 02:22:45,355
你父亲也最好能知轻重
And your father had better be too.

1606
02:22:45,633 --> 02:22:47,123
但是，劳夫！
But, Rolfe!

1607
02:23:10,224 --> 02:23:11,885
爸爸…
Father!

1608
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,822
-我们没料到你这么快回来 -哈…
- We didn't expect you so soon. - Hello, hello!

1609
02:23:15,062 --> 02:23:17,860
我们以为你下星期回来！
We didn't expect you home until next week!

1610
02:23:18,065 --> 02:23:23,503
-有在巴黎给我们买手信吗？ -你好吗？
- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris? - Hello! How are you?

1611
02:23:24,605 --> 02:23:25,902
你们为什么没有打给我们？
Why didn't you call us?

1612
02:23:26,107 --> 02:23:28,041
我们试过了，但是不通
We couldn't get through.

1613
02:23:28,342 --> 02:23:30,276
这个我也没奈何
I had nothing to do with that.

1614
02:23:30,545 --> 02:23:32,570
我们尽快赶回来了
We came back as fast as we could.

1615
02:23:32,880 --> 02:23:35,041
我们很想念你们
Well, well, well! We missed you!

1616
02:23:35,283 --> 02:23:37,717
-我们很想你们 -我们很想亲你们
- We missed you! - We missed kissing you.

1617
02:23:37,919 --> 02:23:40,752
我想念你们早上的噪音
We missed all the noise in the morning.

1618
02:23:41,022 --> 02:23:45,220
-最想念的是你们的歌声 -你们回来得正巧
- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing. - Oh, you came back just in time.

1619
02:23:45,426 --> 02:23:47,189
看这个，莉亚小姐…
Look, Fraulein Maria...

1620
02:23:47,395 --> 02:23:49,022
我是说妈妈
I mean Mother.

1621
02:23:49,430 --> 02:23:51,921
我们今晚会在音乐节唱歌
We're going to sing in the festival tonight.

1622
02:23:52,133 --> 02:23:54,260
我们过得很快乐
We've been having a lovely time!

1623
02:23:54,535 --> 02:23:56,594
我们练习了一天
We've been rehearsing all...

1624
02:23:58,105 --> 02:24:00,437
惊喜！惊喜！
Surprise! Surprise!

1625
02:24:01,108 --> 02:24:03,599
里面有令你们惊喜的东西
Surprises for you on the terrace.

1626
02:24:06,647 --> 02:24:08,046
我们到里面去谈这个
We'll talk about this.

1627
02:24:08,249 --> 02:24:12,549
我本想要告诉你，但是你不在 我只有在最后一刻自作主张了
I would've told you but you were away. I had to make a last-minute decision.

1628
02:24:12,820 --> 02:24:15,311
我还算好运气 总算赶得及报名
I was fortunate to enter them at all.

1629
02:24:15,556 --> 02:24:20,289
他们必会成为话题的 试想一个家庭中的七个小孩
They'll be the talk of the festival. Imagine, seven children in one family!

1630
02:24:20,494 --> 02:24:22,121
麦斯
Max!

1631
02:24:22,730 --> 02:24:25,563
我记得我以前 向你解释得很清楚…
Somehow I recall having made it quite clear to you...

1632
02:24:25,833 --> 02:24:28,495
我对于我家的小孩 在外面演唱的事的感觉
...how I feel about my family singing in public!

1633
02:24:28,769 --> 02:24:30,464
但是委员会听过他们唱 非常的感动
The committee was enchanted.

1634
02:24:30,671 --> 02:24:33,834
-他们说了什么？ -没听过这么热情的声音
- What did they say? - I have never heard such enthusiasm.

1635
02:24:34,108 --> 02:24:38,408
-就一次好不好？ -绝对不可能
- Don't you think just this once...? - Absolutely out of the question.

1636
02:24:38,646 --> 02:24:42,776
-这是为了奥地利 -为了奥地利？
- Georg, this is for Austria. - For Austria?

1637
02:24:43,150 --> 02:24:46,415
-已经没有奥地利了！ -但是德奥合并得很和平
- There is no Austria! - But the Anschluss was peaceful.

1638
02:24:46,654 --> 02:24:50,112
-我们应感到欣慰 -欣慰？
- Let's at least be grateful for that. - Grateful?

1639
02:24:51,993 --> 02:24:53,654
你知道吗？麦斯
You know, Max...

1640
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:57,793
有时候我无法相信 自己认识你
...sometimes I don't believe I know you.

1641
02:25:00,468 --> 02:25:01,833
爸爸，我忘了
Father, I forgot.

1642
02:25:02,670 --> 02:25:04,262
这是给你的
This is for you.

1643
02:25:14,048 --> 02:25:18,041
犸莉亚，至少他必须假装 和这些人合作
Maria, he has got to at least pretend to work with these people.

1644
02:25:18,319 --> 02:25:19,843
你必须说服他
You must convince him.

1645
02:25:20,054 --> 02:25:22,818
我不能要求他听我的话
Max, I can't ask him to be less than he is.

1646
02:25:23,057 --> 02:25:26,356
那么我和他谈 如果孩子们不参加音乐节
Then I'll talk to him. If the children don't sing, well...

1647
02:25:26,627 --> 02:25:28,857
是一样对奥地利有损的事
...it will be a reflection on Austria.

1648
02:25:29,664 --> 02:25:33,031
对我也没有好处
Oh, I know. It wouldn't do me any good either.

1649
02:25:38,205 --> 02:25:40,867
妈，可以这样叫你真好
Mother? That sounds so nice.

1650
02:25:41,142 --> 02:25:43,872
-我喜欢叫你妈 -我喜欢听你叫
- I like calling you "Mother." - I like hearing it.

1651
02:25:44,078 --> 02:25:47,809
你很爱爸爸，我看得出来
You love Father very much. I can tell you do.

1652
02:25:48,015 --> 02:25:48,811
非常爱他
Very much.

1653
02:25:49,083 --> 02:25:52,382
妈，当你认为你爱某个人时 你要怎么办？
Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone?

1654
02:25:53,087 --> 02:25:58,389
我是说当你不再爱他 或他不再爱你时
I mean, when you stop loving someone or he stops loving you?

1655
02:26:00,995 --> 02:26:03,054
你会哭一场
Well, you cry a little.

1656
02:26:03,497 --> 02:26:05,590
等待太阳出来
Then you wait for the sun to come out.

1657
02:26:05,900 --> 02:26:07,231
快乐的日子终会再来
It always does.

1658
02:26:07,501 --> 02:26:11,062
有许多事情我认为我应该知道 但我却不知道
There are so many things I think I should know but I don't.

1659
02:26:11,272 --> 02:26:13,240
-真的不知道 -怎么说？
- I really don't. - How can you?

1660
02:26:13,507 --> 02:26:15,702
有时我觉得世界就快完了
Sometimes I feel the world is ending.

1661
02:26:15,943 --> 02:26:19,174
-然后你觉得这才刚开始？ -是的
- Then you feel it's just beginning? - Yes!

1662
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:23,612
我以前也这么觉得 对你，一切会很好的
It was that way with me. And for you it will be just as wonderful.

1663
02:26:24,285 --> 02:26:26,185
你真的认为如此？
Do you really think so?

1664
02:26:27,088 --> 02:26:31,024
你16岁，快17岁了
When you're 16 going on 17

1665
02:26:31,292 --> 02:26:34,887
人生才要开始
Waiting for life to start

1666
02:26:35,563 --> 02:26:39,397
一个让你留下好印象的人
Somebody kind Who touches your mind

1667
02:26:39,633 --> 02:26:43,933
会突然触动你的心灵
Will suddenly touch your heart

1668
02:26:44,372 --> 02:26:46,067
当这事…
When that happens

1669
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:48,474
发生之后
After it happens

1670
02:26:48,709 --> 02:26:52,577
一切都改变了
Nothing is quite the same

1671
02:26:52,813 --> 02:26:54,371
我知道…
Somehow I know

1672
02:26:54,648 --> 02:26:56,775
我会立刻走过去
I'll jump up and go

1673
02:26:56,984 --> 02:27:01,284
若他呼唤我的名字
If ever he calls my name

1674
02:27:01,555 --> 02:27:05,457
你旧日对生命的看法会变改
Gone are your old ideas of life

1675
02:27:05,726 --> 02:27:09,924
那些旧念头都变得黯淡
The old ideas grow dim

1676
02:27:10,164 --> 02:27:14,567
你会发现你已为人妻
Lo and behold You're someone's wife

1677
02:27:15,503 --> 02:27:21,499
你完全属于他
And you belong to him

1678
02:27:21,809 --> 02:27:26,109
你会以为这种历险
You may think this kind of adventure

1679
02:27:26,313 --> 02:27:30,181
永不会发生在自己身上
Never may come to you

1680
02:27:31,285 --> 02:27:36,655
亲爱的已16岁，快17岁了
Darling, 16 going on 17

1681
02:27:37,491 --> 02:27:41,621
耐心等一年…
Wait a year...

1682
02:27:42,430 --> 02:27:47,663
-我会等一年 -或两年吧
- I'll wait a year ...or two

1683
02:27:48,102 --> 02:27:55,440
只要等一年…
Just wait a year...

1684
02:27:56,310 --> 02:28:04,945
或两年
...or two

1685
02:28:07,354 --> 02:28:08,946
莉莎
Liesl.

1686
02:28:25,406 --> 02:28:26,737
什么事情？
What is it?

1687
02:28:27,675 --> 02:28:29,040
是柏林
Berlin.

1688
02:28:29,510 --> 02:28:31,375
他们给我委派了一项任命
They've offered me a commission.

1689
02:28:31,645 --> 02:28:34,170
并要求我马上接受
I've been requested to accept immediately...

1690
02:28:34,415 --> 02:28:38,408
明天到北莱梅港海军基地报到
...and report to their naval base at Bremerhaven tomorrow.

1691
02:28:39,019 --> 02:28:43,012
我就知道这种事会发生 没料到这么快
I knew this would happen. I didn't think it would be so soon.

1692
02:28:43,257 --> 02:28:46,749
拒绝的话，全家会遭到惩罚
To refuse them would be fatal for all of us.

1693
02:28:47,995 --> 02:28:51,761
加入的话后果更难想像
And joining them would be unthinkable.

1694
02:28:57,938 --> 02:28:59,701
叫小孩们都过来
Get the children all together.

1695
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:03,237
别说让他们担心的话 只要让他们准备好
Don't say anything to worry them. Just get them ready.

1696
02:29:04,211 --> 02:29:06,577
我们必须离开奥地利
We've got to get out of Austria...

1697
02:29:08,249 --> 02:29:09,910
还有这所房子
...and this house...

1698
02:29:12,253 --> 02:29:13,686
就在今晚
...tonight.

1699
02:29:57,598 --> 02:29:59,998
今晚你们不唱了
This strains my back and breaks my heart...

1700
02:30:00,267 --> 02:30:03,100
真是让我伤心难过
...when I think of the children missing the festival.

1701
02:30:03,404 --> 02:30:06,066
你宣布的时候 我们就越过边界了
By your announcement we'll be over the border.

1702
02:30:06,307 --> 02:30:08,741
我希望你会感激我所做的牺牲
Do you appreciate the sacrifice I'm making?

1703
02:30:08,943 --> 02:30:10,240
你没有选择
You have no choice.

1704
02:30:10,477 --> 02:30:13,310
我知道，这就是我会这样做的原因
I know. That's why I'm making it.

1705
02:30:14,014 --> 02:30:16,141
爸爸为何不发动引擎？
Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?

1706
02:30:16,350 --> 02:30:19,786
因为他不要任何人听到
Because he doesn't want anyone to hear us.

1707
02:30:23,424 --> 02:30:25,858
管家们会说什么？
What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?

1708
02:30:26,126 --> 02:30:29,653
他们可以老实回答 他们什么都不知道
They'll be able to answer honestly they didn't know anything.

1709
02:30:29,863 --> 02:30:34,095
-我们会再回来吗？ -莉莎，我希望会有这一天
- Will we be coming back here? - Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.

1710
02:30:34,335 --> 02:30:39,272
爸爸和麦伯伯 要一直推车到瑞士吗？
Are Father and Uncle Max going to push the car all the way to Switzerland?

1711
02:31:06,066 --> 02:31:08,466
舰长，你的车是不是有毛病？
Something wrong with your car, captain?

1712
02:31:08,802 --> 02:31:11,066
是的，车子无法启动
Yes, we couldn't get it started.

1713
02:31:14,842 --> 02:31:16,070
卡尔
Karl.

1714
02:31:18,045 --> 02:31:21,537
替舰长把车修好 好让其启动
Fix Captain von Trapp's car so that it will start.

1715
02:31:44,738 --> 02:31:46,535
做得好
Excellent, Karl.

1716
02:31:49,910 --> 02:31:53,073
我没问你和你的家人要到哪
I've not asked you where you and your family are going.

1717
02:31:53,580 --> 02:31:55,707
你也没问我为何在此
Nor have you asked me why I'm here.

1718
02:31:55,916 --> 02:31:59,682
我想我们两个都没什么好奇心
Apparently we both suffer from a deplorable lack of curiosity.

1719
02:32:00,554 --> 02:32:03,022
你没有回湍欠狻
You never answered the telegram...

1720
02:32:03,257 --> 02:32:06,556
来自第三帝国海军基地的电报
...from the Admiral of the Navy of the Third Reich.

1721
02:32:06,794 --> 02:32:09,262
据我所知，在奥地利
I was under the impression, Herr Zeller...

1722
02:32:09,530 --> 02:32:13,022
电报的内容是私人的
...that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private!

1723
02:32:13,734 --> 02:32:17,261
最少在我所知的奥地利是如此
At least, the Austria I know.

1724
02:32:18,405 --> 02:32:20,032
我奉命…
I have my orders...

1725
02:32:20,274 --> 02:32:22,435
今晚带你去基地
...to take you to Bremerhaven tonight...

1726
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:24,905
接受你的职务
...where you will accept your commission.

1727
02:32:26,046 --> 02:32:31,484
我怕不可能了
I'm afraid that's going to be quite impossible.

1728
02:32:32,086 --> 02:32:33,815
你看…
You see, we...

1729
02:32:34,388 --> 02:32:37,221
我们全家…
...all of us, the entire family, will be...

1730
02:32:38,292 --> 02:32:40,317
今晚要在音乐会上演唱
...singing in the festival tonight.

1731
02:32:40,627 --> 02:32:43,095
事实上我们现在就要去
As a matter of fact, we're going now.

1732
02:32:43,731 --> 02:32:46,598
不可能现在让他们失望的
We couldn't possibly let them down now.

1733
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:49,769
-我希望我们不会迟到 -是的
- I just hope we're not too late. - Yes.

1734
02:32:50,003 --> 02:32:52,904
你叫我相信，你舰长…
You ask me to believe that you, Captain von Trapp...

1735
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:54,607
要去演唱会唱歌？
...are singing in a concert?

1736
02:32:55,008 --> 02:32:59,138
相信我，这会是最棒的表演
Believe me, it will be a performance beyond anything even I've dreamt of.

1737
02:32:59,513 --> 02:33:04,143
吉勒先生，像你一样 我也是身怀绝技的
Like you, Herr Zeller, I, too, am a man of hidden talents.

1738
02:33:04,852 --> 02:33:06,183
是的
Yes.

1739
02:33:06,453 --> 02:33:08,944
这是节目表
Here, program.

1740
02:33:13,961 --> 02:33:16,293
上面只有孩子的名字
It says only the names of the children.

1741
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:19,795
上面说范崔普家庭歌团
It says the von Trapp Family Singers...

1742
02:33:20,033 --> 02:33:23,093
而我是范崔普家的头儿 不是吗？
...and I am the head of the von Trapp family, am I not?

1743
02:33:25,372 --> 02:33:29,172
穿着这些旅行装？
And these travel clothes that you're all wearing?

1744
02:33:30,010 --> 02:33:31,534
是我们的制服
Our costumes, naturally.

1745
02:33:31,812 --> 02:33:35,213
今晚天气不好 穿礼服会对孩子的嗓子有影响
This night air is not good for the children's voices.

1746
02:33:41,455 --> 02:33:44,982
稍微延迟执行命令没什么大不了
Well, a slight delay in my orders will not be serious.

1747
02:33:46,193 --> 02:33:47,717
你们
Therefore...

1748
02:33:48,562 --> 02:33:50,189
去唱吧
...you will sing.

1749
02:33:51,131 --> 02:33:53,122
你们全部都要唱
You will all sing.

1750
02:33:53,500 --> 02:33:56,025
这正是我希望的
But only because that's what I want.

1751
02:33:56,970 --> 02:34:00,406
这表示奥地利一切都没有改变
It will demonstrate that nothing in Austria has changed.

1752
02:34:01,141 --> 02:34:03,336
你们唱完后
And when you have finished singing...

1753
02:34:03,644 --> 02:34:06,807
我就要带舰长到北莱梅港
...you, Captain von Trapp, will be taken to Bremerhaven.

1754
02:34:08,081 --> 02:34:10,811
现在，你们上车吧
Now, if you will all get into your car...

1755
02:34:11,051 --> 02:34:14,885
我们要护送 范崔普家庭歌团去演唱会
...we will escort the von Trapp Family Singers to the festival.

1756
02:34:15,756 --> 02:34:17,917
吉勒先生，用不着护送
No escort will be necessary.

1757
02:34:18,158 --> 02:34:20,649
舰长，我们乐意如此
Necessary? A pleasure, captain.

1758
02:34:21,562 --> 02:34:25,430
我们不希望你们迷了路
After all, we would not want you to get lost in the crowds.

1759
02:34:26,667 --> 02:34:28,157
对吗？
Would we?

1760
02:34:28,836 --> 02:34:29,996
是的
No.

1761
02:34:46,220 --> 02:34:49,383
Sew是用针拉着线
Sew, a needle pulling thread

1762
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:52,787
La是Sew之后的音

1763
02:34:53,060 --> 02:34:56,518
Tea是配果酱面包的饮品

1764
02:34:56,730 --> 02:35:00,530
是配果酱面包的饮品

1767
02:35:21,722 --> 02:35:24,953

1769

1770
02:35:30,597 --> 02:35:32,121
配果酱…

1771
02:35:32,332 --> 02:35:41,138

...and bread

1772
02:36:03,130 --> 02:36:06,258
各位奥地利兄弟们
My fellow Austrians...

1773
02:36:07,534 --> 02:36:12,096
或许我会有一段时间 见不到你们了
...I shall not be seeing you again, perhaps for a very long time.

1774
02:36:13,507 --> 02:36:15,168
现在我要为你们唱…
I would like to sing for you now...

1775
02:36:16,777 --> 02:36:18,335
一首爱之歌
...a love song.

1776
02:36:20,314 --> 02:36:22,509
我知道你们会分享此爱

1777
02:36:23,817 --> 02:36:27,514
我祈求你们永远不会让它逝去

我听无线电说

1866
02:46:05,064 --> 02:46:08,363
那么我们开车到山里 再徒步过去

Yes, Mother.

1873
02:46:25,919 --> 02:46:28,080
-我好害怕 -我也是
- I'm scared. - Me too.

1874
02:46:40,166 --> 02:46:41,326
愿主与你同在
God be with you.

1875
02:46:48,274 --> 02:46:49,832
-妈 -是的？
- Mother. - Yes?

1876
02:46:50,076 --> 02:46:53,273
如我们唱“心爱的事物” 会有帮助吗？
Would it help if we sang about our favorite things?

1877
02:46:53,513 --> 02:46:56,505
不，亲爱的 这是唯一帮不上忙的一次
No, darling. This is one time it would not help.

1878
02:46:56,783 --> 02:46:59,980
你必须很安静，紧抱着我
You must be very quiet. Hold tight to me.

1879
02:49:14,654 --> 02:49:15,882
我们到屋顶看看
Let's try the roof.

1880
02:50:12,145 --> 02:50:14,375
劳夫，求求你
Rolfe, please.

1881
02:50:19,485 --> 02:50:20,975
不要，等一下
No, wait.

1882
02:50:30,797 --> 02:50:32,128
犸莉亚
Maria.

1883
02:50:33,199 --> 02:50:34,632
孩子们
Children.

1884
02:50:38,671 --> 02:50:41,697
我们要的只是你
It's you we want, not them.

1885
02:50:42,074 --> 02:50:43,803
把那个放下
Put that down.

1886
02:50:44,877 --> 02:50:48,176
不准动，否则我就开枪
Not another move, or I'll shoot.

1887
02:50:49,882 --> 02:50:51,907
你只是个孩子
You're only a boy.

1888
02:50:54,921 --> 02:50:58,584
-你并不是他们的人 -站在原地
- You don't really belong to them. - Stay where you are.

1889
02:51:00,359 --> 02:51:02,350
跟我们逃吧
Come away with us.

1890
02:51:03,596 --> 02:51:04,756
现在还来得及
Before it's too late.

1891
02:51:05,364 --> 02:51:07,696
你再行一步，我就杀了你
Not another step. I'll kill you.

1892
02:51:10,002 --> 02:51:13,335
-把枪给我，劳夫 -你有没有听到？
- You give that to me, Rolfe. - Did you hear me?

1893
02:51:14,340 --> 02:51:15,898
我会杀了你
I'll kill you.

1894
02:51:17,777 --> 02:51:19,244
劳夫
Rolfe.

1895
02:51:37,630 --> 02:51:38,961
你永远不会跟他们一样
You'll never be one of them.

1896
02:51:41,734 --> 02:51:43,429
中尉
Lieutenant!

1897
02:51:43,703 --> 02:51:44,829
他们在这里
They're here!

1898
02:51:45,037 --> 02:51:46,595
他们在这里，中尉
They're here, lieutenant!

1899
02:52:27,914 --> 02:52:29,575
院长
Reverend Mother.

1900
02:52:30,850 --> 02:52:32,681
我有罪
I have sinned.

1901
02:52:33,853 --> 02:52:36,014
院长，我也是
I too, Reverend Mother.

1902
02:52:37,657 --> 02:52:39,989
孩子们，是什么罪？
What is this sin, my children?
