1
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,793
I work in Human Resources
or "HR," as some people call it.

2
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,314
And I have this poster
in my office that says,

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,960
"Keep calm and go to your safe place."

4
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,149
Well, when I get a little stressed out
or my anxiety spikes,

5
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,959
I close my eyes
and picture my cul-de-sac,

6
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,113
and my wonderful wife, Karen,
and our two sons, Patrick and Mikey.

7
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,988
Because that's the place where I know
everything is always okay.

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,474
No matter what.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,456
Bye, Mikey, Patrick.
Bye, you guys.

10
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
Bye, guys.

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,136
You can text us
the minute you get to camp.

12
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,195
Yeah, okay.

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,136
And if you get any ticks,
put it in the plastic baggie

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,277
with the date and time of the bite,
and I'll get them tested.

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,794
Change your socks. Okay, guys?
Change your socks.

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,376
We love you. We love you.
We're gonna miss you.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,958
- Love you guys!
- Have so much fun!

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Be strong!

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,160
Be strong.

20
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,792
Oh.

21
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,070
Did that bus driver
look sober to you, honey?

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,879
Because he gave me a really weird look
when I smelled his breath.

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,791
Well, I think you just startled him.

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,633
Huh! Look, there's Meg.

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,755
Hey, Meg.

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,596
- Whoo! I sold it.
- Oh!

27
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,716
- That was so fast.
- Thank you.

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,028
All cash buyers.

29
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,553
All cash buyers? That's fancy.

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,438
Yeah. And the best part is,
they didn't even see it.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,158
They just saw the pictures online.

32
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,470
I haven't even met them
in person. It's crazy.

33
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,279
Who buys a house
without seeing it first?

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,590
I know. Maybe it's a celebrity,
you know?

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,148
Come on, Jeff.
No celebrity is gonna move here.

36
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,879
I hope it's not some kind of
meth lab situation.

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,994
Oh. There he is.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,230
- Sorry.
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,991
Kinko's was bananas.

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,308
It often is.

41
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,833
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,717
So exciting. New neighbors, right?

43
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,234
Oh, and, Karen,
I left your card in the foyer,

44
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,550
- just in case they want a decorator.
- Thank you.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,856
So, uh, did you tell

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,633
Jeff about my new idea
for the guest bathroom?

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,433
No.

48
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,192
Artist's loft.

49
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,032
Think Brooklyn, okay?

50
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,958
Exposed brick,
visible plumbing. And...

51
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,429
A urinal.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,039
A urinal!

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,112
That's really for me.
Meg wants me standing up again.

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,393
Well, I suppose I'd better get started
on the urinal.

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,677
Yeah, no. I know
what you're getting started on.

56
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,830
Empty house, kids are gone.

57
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,353
Wow-chick-a-wow-wow!

58
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Please.

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,313
- Honeymoon.
- All right, keep it PG, guys.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,233
Well, we gotta go
flyer the subdivision anyway.

61
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,073
- We're gonna pound the pavement.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,760
- Jeff, you should try it hyena style.
- We'll try it.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,079
That's the noise I make.

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,713
I think Meg has changed up
her medication, honey.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
- What's Dan's excuse then?
- Ugh.

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,856
Some of that stuff
they were saying was demented.

67
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,359
- Disgusting.
- Yeah.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Phew!

69
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,435
But maybe they have a point.
I don't know.

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,909
Alone in the house.

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,753
First time in a long time.

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,316
Yeah, I mean,
we can do whatever we want.

I, uh, DVR-ed the, uh, Good Wife.

84
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,239
Great. I'll make popcorn.

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,351
- Back it up.
- You got it.

86
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,576
- How much room we got?
- Almost there.

87
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,828
Hey, Bernie.

88
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,201
New neighbors aren't wasting
any time moving in, are they?

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,515
Nope.

90
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,576
You're gonna clean that up,
right, Berno?

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,669
Always do.

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,671
Okay, have a good one.

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,360
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,998
Come on, fellas. Let's go. Come on.

95
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,594
Hi, Jack. Good morning.

96
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,910
Don't let anybody say that to you
on a plane. "Hijack."

97
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,256
Good morning, anyway.

98
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,315
Morning.

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,555
Hi, Diane.

100
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,993
Jeff, good morning.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,629
See those moving vans?

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,472
Oh. Couldn't miss them.

103
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,754
- Gosh!
- So,

104
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,876
- any word on the new neighbors?
- No.

105
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,109
- Anything?
- Nothing.

106
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,792
Guarantee they're no Dave and Bridget.

107
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,950
Well, at least the summer's
not a total loss.

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,996
I mean, we got Junetoberfest
to look forward to.

109
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,559
- Yes, we do.
- And our jobs.

110
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,914
Always have our jobs.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,479
By the way, how's it going upstairs?

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,551
Jesus, Jeff. You know I can't
talk about what we do upstairs.

113
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,119
Yeah. I know. It's all right.

114
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,633
Uh... Hey, oh, by the way,

115
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,392
I still have those, uh,
indoor skydiving

116
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,959
lessons if you wanna join me.

117
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,388
My treat.

118
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,798
Uh, this week's really hectic.
Kid stuff. But, maybe.

119
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,438
Just text me. Or I'll text you.

120
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,630
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Have a good one.

121
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
- All right.
- Hey, Sheila. Good morning.

122
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Morning, Louise.

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,588
Morning, Sharon.

124
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,511
Hi, Jeff. Dr. Fisher called.

125
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,635
Yeah? What did he say?

126
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,474
He said, "Please tell Jeff to stop
texting me about indoor skydiving."

127
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,632
He's joking. He's a riot. Hey, Doug.

128
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,155
Hey, Sanjay.

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,913
Hey, uh, Jeff.
Can I use your computer?

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,718
I need to reorder my anti-depressants.

131
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,672
Of course. Mi computer, su computer.

132
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,193
Where are you? Who's that?

133
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,753
Oh, this is Jeff.

134
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,110
Jeff lets me use his computer because
security prohibits Internet upstairs.

135
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,637
And why does Jeff have Internet?

136
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,399
Because Jeff does unimportant work.

137
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,757
Human Resources.

138
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,400
Are we getting written up?
'Cause I emailed him last night

139
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,273
and apologized.
He said he was fine. And we have

140
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,635
- put this behind us.
- It's all fine.

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,435
I wouldn't be doing my job if we
didn't go over a couple of exercises.

142
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,829
So, grab a stress ball.

143
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,515
Really?

144
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,750
Okay, so, Margaret's gonna
show us, uh...

145
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,398
the, uh, meaning of trust.

146
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,316
- Hey, Sanjay?
- Yeah?

147
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,392
Did I tell you that I ate at
a Indian restaurant the other night?

148
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,960
Yeah, I had to call
and make an Indian reservation.

149
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,518
Yang, tell Oren how he makes you feel.

150
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,788
Maybe you should just write us up.
That might be easier.

151
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,997
I once knew an Indian who drank
so much tea, he died in his "tea-pee."

152
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,576
That was a good one.

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,238
Okay, Margaret. Go ahead.

154
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,754
Wow.

155
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,755
Yes, I do feel
like you are jealous.

156
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,353
I can sense the resentment

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,432
every time I bring up
gravitational perturbations.

158
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,456
Is that bad? That sounds bad.
What is that? Is that like, uh...

159
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,278
Gravitational perturbations?
That's a laugh!

160
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,919
Plus, what about my work?

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,560
I mentioned velocity vectors
one time...

162
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,109
One time,

163
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,350
and you try to get me
bumped down to Dhameer's team?

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,476
You were supposed
to calculate...

165
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,789
This is all because
I hooked up with Sharada.

166
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
You what?
You hooked up with Sharada Ganjali?

167
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,632
I'll kill you!

168
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,398
Oren, this is no way
to settle a workplace dispute!

169
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,913
Sharon, call security!

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,149
Hiya, Jeff!

171
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,352
- Karen.
- Hey, honey!

172
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,753
Hey, darling.

173
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,039
Still spying on the neighbors?

174
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,759
Hi, there.

175
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Hello.

176
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,915
You must be Jeff.

177
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,958
I'm Tim. This is my wife, Natalie.

178
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,112
We're the Joneses!
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

179
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,456
Nice to meet you guys.
Uh, that was a joke about spying...

180
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,869
It's a joke. I'd never spy on anyone.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,353
We love humor.

182
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,555
Humor...

183
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,478
So, Natalie was just telling me that
she's a social media consultant.

184
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,437
Yeah. I also write a cooking blog.

185
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,919
Oh, I love blogs.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,798
Yeah, and I work with a charity
for Sri Lankan orphans.

187
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,590
Those are my biggest passions.

188
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,829
Natalie's got a big heart.

189
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,512
Aw, thank you, baby.

190
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,634
Yeah, um...

191
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,896
- Why don't you tell them about, uh...
- What?

192
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,434
She has passions too. Why don't you
tell them about the urinal?

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,136
No, honey!

194
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,309
It's nothing.

195
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,920
Oh, no, please. It sounds interesting.

196
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,436
I'm picking up a slight accent.
Is that Pittsburgh, maybe?

197
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,750
- She's from Greece.
- Oh, God.

198
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,193
No, but we've lived all over.

199
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,636
And now, it's finally time
to plant some roots. Right?

200
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Oh...

201
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,834
I can't tell you how excited we are
to be here on Maple Circle.

202
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,069
Such a lovely street.

203
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,229
- It really is.
- Oh.

204
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,719
- Thank you.
- We love it.

205
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,496
It's fascinating. In other cultures,
they don't have anything like this.

206
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,714
No, they don't.

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,028
In Chinese, for example.

208
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,776
They don't even have a word
for a street like this.

209
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,915
What? For cul-de-sac?

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,956
No. No. I mean, they would say...

211
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,399
Which is, loosely,

212
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,391
- "happy place of heart and mind."
- Right.

213
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,074
But it doesn't really capture
the essence of it, right?

214
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,718
But it's cool coming
out of your mouth.

215
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,031
- Tim's a travel writer.
- Oh! Really?

216
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,957
- Wow! We love to travel.
- We do.

217
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,436
Yeah. We went to Epcot Center
last summer, was it? Yeah.

218
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,512
You can go to every country,
like, within three blocks.

219
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,352
Perfect. That's what we like about it.

220
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,616
We went with the boys over there.

221
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,496
That's Patrick and Mikey.
Patrick's leaning

222
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,240
against the wheel.
He's just a real cuddler.

223
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,239
- They're beautiful.
- Adorable.

224
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,033
Mikey, uh, made this.

225
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,678
- Oh! Wow!
- What a talent!

226
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,832
- Speaking of which, we brought you...
- Yes, yes.

227
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,920
...a little something.

228
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,675
What?

229
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,718
- That's amazing! Really?
- Give me a break!

230
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
I made it myself.

231
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,110
- You made it yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

232
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Oh...

233
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,919
Wow. Look at this.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,200
- What is this?
- What is that?

235
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,240
A sculpture.

236
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,673
Tim blows his own glass.

237
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,557
Look at it in the light, honey.
It sort of...

238
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,437
- That's gorgeous. Look at that.
- Gorgeous.

239
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,669
- You made that?
- Yeah,

240
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,239
it's a hobby I picked up in Hungary.

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,632
I wrote an article about this, uh,
Hungarian glass-blowing master, Yorgi.

242
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,936
- Thank you. I don't know what to say.
- Oh, you don't need to say anything.

243
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,838
Just put it right there
and use it as a conversation piece.

244
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,831
- That's cool. Thank you very much!
- Thank you.

245
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,831
- Anyway, we should get going.
- Yeah.

246
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,877
- Yeah. We should.
- Oh. Okay.

247
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,030
Uh, I feel like I should
give you guys a gift.

248
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,416
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

249
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,136
- That's not necessary.
- You want a stress ball?

250
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,576
No, you don't want a stress ball.
That would be stupid.

251
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
I'd love a stress ball.

252
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,256
- Thank you.
- Yes! They really work.

253
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Thank you.

254
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,416
- Let me just get this out of your way.
- No, Jeff will get that.

255
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,668
- No, no, no.
- That's nice.

256
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,478
It's all good. We're neighbors now.

257
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,035
All right.

258
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,119
Have you guys ever, uh, been to
or heard of, uh, Junetoberfest?

259
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,918
- Junetoberfest?
- Yeah.

260
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,439
You guys should really come.

261
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,511
It's our annual summer get-together.

262
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,616
The whole neighborhood comes.
A really fun group.

263
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,680
A lot of us work together.

264
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,949
At MBI?

265
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,629
Yeah. We have a dart tournament.
We have bratwurst.

266
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,591
I make my own home brew,
which is my passion.

267
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,755
Good!

268
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,256
How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?

269
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,280
Hmm?

270
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,398
Jeff must've mentioned it.
Right, Jeff?

271
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,471
- No. No, he didn't.
- That's okay, honey...

272
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,640
No, Jeff didn't mention it.

273
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
The stress ball.

274
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,856
Must've been a lucky guess,
I guess.

275
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
- No, it's right there.
- Lucky guess. Yeah, we should go.

276
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,994
It's getting late.
Thank you so much for everything.

277
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,832
The coffee was delicious.

278
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,880
- Thank you.
- And we'll see you at Junetoberfest!

279
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,760
So, let me show you a picture.
This is Tyler.

280
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,831
And Tyler's gonna go
to asthma camp this summer.

281
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,076
Oh, my God! He's so handsome!

282
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,030
- Hiya, neighbor.
- Hey.

283
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,439
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

284
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,873
"Seared yellowtail

285
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,760
with lemon zest and ginger shavings."
Who the hell made this?

286
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,234
Natalie. Apparently,
she can do everything.

287
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,993
I'm sorry, but who wears that
to a barbecue?

288
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,274
I mean, there are kids here.

289
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,271
Come on, Meg.
It's just a summer dress.

290
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,908
It's a very short, very chic,
extremely flattering summer dress.

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,672
Yeah, well, it's pornographic.

292
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,317
Oh. Look at Dan pretending
to check his email.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,516
If I find pictures of her ass
on his phone, BJ night is canceled.

294
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,440
So, anyway, there I am,

295
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,193
alone, in the middle
of the Empty Quarter, all by myself,

296
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,874
with no water, dying of thirst.
I'm literally

297
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,000
- writing a goodbye letter to Natalie.
- Oh.

298
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,151
And what do I see
coming up over the horizon?

299
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,629
But the exact same camel...

300
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,836
whose life I saved
three years earlier.

301
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,717
- Exact same one.
- Did he remember you?

302
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,136
No. No, Jeff.
He didn't remember me. He's a camel.

303
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,675
But I was able to ride him
into civilization.

304
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,480
And I filed my story, with 15 minutes
to spare, thank you very much.

305
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,696
Caught the next flight to Marrakesh

306
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,712
and was sitting in a café with Natalie
smoking hookah later that night.

307
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,394
- No way!
- I wanna smoke a hookah in Marrakesh.

308
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,150
Well, Stacey,
I know it sounds very romantic.

309
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,994
But, trust me, the world can be
a very dark and disturbing place.

310
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,616
Tim, you want a beer?

311
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,993
Uh, sure. Yeah. Thank you.

312
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,280
- Here you go.
- Ooh. There it is.

313
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Mmm.

314
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,469
Wow, good job... Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Buddy, buddy. Yeah, buddy. Wow!

315
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,256
- That is a lot of blood.
- It's fine. It's okay.

316
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,456
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

317
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,549
It's just gushing a bit.

318
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,776
- Just hold on to that.
- Yes.

319
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,835
Give me this.

320
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,216
- It's sprung a leak.
- Just...

321
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,376
- I feel a little bit light-headed.
- Close your hand around it.

322
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,960
- If I could just maybe...
- No! No! no!

323
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,388
You can't rattle me.

324
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,799
Witness... Witness my destiny.

325
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,552
Neighborhood champ,
five years in a row!

326
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,037
Hey! You wanna give it a try?

327
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,155
- Me?
- Yeah!

328
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,675
No,

329
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,376
- I'll only embarrass myself.
- "No" is not an answer.

330
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,435
Come on. It's so easy.

331
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,908
- It's a bad idea.
- Look,

332
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,197
I'll even show you
the famous Craverston grip, okay?

333
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,793
- All right.
- Put that in your hand.

334
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,598
Now hold it like a pencil.

335
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,278
Now cock your wrist.

336
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,952
- Right.
- Good, good. Elbow out.

337
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,519
And then you just kinda throw at it.

338
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Like this?

339
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,199
This is good?

340
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,840
Well, you kinda throw like a girl.

341
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,798
But when a girl is as beautiful as you
she doesn't have to be good.

342
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,437
Do you mind if I skip
the Craverston grip?

343
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,039
Okay, good luck.

344
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,953
Oh, my God! Look at that!

345
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,153
Maybe I should show you
how to throw like a girl.

346
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,118
Suck on that, Craverston.

347
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,553
Shut up, Oren.

348
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,275
Where's your girlfriend?

349
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,359
Tim.

350
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,635
Oh, hey, Karen.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

351
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,318
You were in Jeff's den.

352
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,118
Yeah. I must've made a wrong turn.

353
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
Um...

354
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,560
Lovely place you have here,
by the way. You have a great eye.

355
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Thank you.

356
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,216
Was that your design work
I saw downstairs?

357
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,879
Jeff had mentioned something
about, uh, urinals.

358
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,429
Yes. Oh, well,
the customer's always right.

359
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
But, yeah, they are my drawings.

360
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,631
Customer's always right.
Except when they're not.

361
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,280
- Oh, the bathroom's that way, Tim.
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

362
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,910
That was one of
the best Junetoberfests

363
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,196
we have ever, ever had.

364
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,395
Have you ever seen a couple
move into a neighborhood

365
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,959
so nicely as the Joneses?

366
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,275
You don't you think there's
something off about them?

367
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,793
I mean, they're so overly

368
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,998
accomplished, and stylish
and affectionate with one another.

369
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Uh...

370
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,456
Why would they wanna live here?

371
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,516
Karen, they told you,
they wanna settle down.

372
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,080
You know that he was
in your den today?

373
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,155
Yeah, so?

374
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,596
So, he can navigate
the bazaars of Marrakesh,

375
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,956
but he gets "lost upstairs"
looking for a bathroom?

376
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,816
Karen, let me tell you something
I learned years ago.

377
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,037
When people have to poop,
they get embarrassed.

378
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,351
As do I, sometimes.

379
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,511
Really? You think he had to poop?

380
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,039
Probably, yes.

381
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,990
You know, if the Joneses seem a little
bit more affectionate than we do,

382
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,072
it's because they haven't had to mute
their passions the way we have

383
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,718
'cause the kids have been around.

384
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,236
But now, it's our time.
It's our summer. Watch my hand there.

385
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,029
And I think it's time
to get busy sexually.

386
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,976
No. It tickles, honey. Honey!

387
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,416
- Honey, I know we said every second...
- Come on!

388
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,696
Look at the time. Look how late it is.

389
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,393
It's traditional Gaffney foreplay.
Let me just do it.

390
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,595
Come on, baby. Come on.

391
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,431
I'm so tired. But I pick up on things.

392
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,351
I was the one who noticed
when the McNultys

393
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,431
were pirating the Yamamotos' cable.

394
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,395
Yes, and intuition
is a wonderful thing.

395
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,473
And take it from me,
somebody who has had 16 years

396
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,840
of human resource experience,

397
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,630
that the Joneses are perfectly nice,
normal, everyday people.

398
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,760
I didn't know what to do.

399
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,879
Smoke blows from the car, you know?
Uh... So I figured

400
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,669
Americans are really good with car...
Oh! You strong man!

401
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,989
So you can help me out?

402
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,197
Absolutely.
You came to the right guys.

403
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,271
We Americans are good
at a lot of things.

404
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,589
Jeff.

405
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Jeff, wake up.

406
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,195
Who are you, Tim Jones?

407
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,795
Sorry.

408
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,999
Neighbor!

409
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,911
- Hey, Jeff. This...
- Oh, my goodness.

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,353
This is embarrassing.

411
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,829
Well, it happens.
Jeepers, let me help you.

412
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,395
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

413
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,959
What are you doing here?

414
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,350
I found your love
of home brewing contagious.

415
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,271
And I figured I could use a hobby.

416
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,195
Instead of glass blowing?

417
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,472
Right. Besides that. Besides that.

418
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,080
It's a cool hobby, but it's probably
not as manly as you'd like.

419
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,676
Hey, Ed.
Set my friend up here.

420
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,256
He's gonna need some wort chillers,
probably need some fizz drops.

421
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,496
- Give him some yeast.
- You're the expert.

422
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,200
- Yup.
- Don't let that yeast get infected.

423
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,336
- Okay.
- I'm kidding.

424
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,998
It's a joke.
It's a yeast infection joke.

425
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,237
- Expensive hobby.
- It's more of a calling, Tim.

426
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,234
- Hey, are you hungry?
- I'm famished.

427
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,595
- You like Chinese?
- The food?

428
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,828
Yeah.

429
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,239
Come on!

430
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,999
Spy force on.

431
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,312
I am leaving this message
in case anything happens to me.

432
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,836
I'm following Natalie Jones
who I have good reason to believe...

433
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,136
Calling Natalie Jones.

434
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
No!

435
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,158
No! No, no, no! Ugh!

436
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,799
Siri!

437
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,789
Thank you.

438
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,753
Have a nice day.

439
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,388
How's the book?

440
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,709
Interesting.

441
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,310
Hi, there! Nice to see you.
Yes, indeed.

442
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,029
That's is my friend, Jeff.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Lu. Okay.

443
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,519
All right, we're gonna go on back.

444
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,800
I know! I feel like I've been
putting on a little too much.

445
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,031
Thank you. Come on
back here, Jeff. Thank you.

446
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,913
I'm doing a little piece on,
sort of, hidden gems around the city.

447
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,400
- Now, that place is good...
- Yeah?

448
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,715
...but this place is great.
Come on, follow me.

449
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,909
Ooh...

450
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,856
It's good to get out of the
cul-de-sac every now and again.

451
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,880
Well, it is, yeah.

452
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,216
- I love my cul-de-sac.
- There he is.

453
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,496
I knew I felt your presence, man!

454
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,056
- What's up, brother?
- How are you, pal?

455
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
This is my friend, Jeff.

456
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,296
Jeff, this is Ricky.
He owns the place.

457
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,656
- Hi, Ricky, how are you?
- What's up, Jeff?

458
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,352
You don't have to bow down.
Don't be shy.

459
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,280
Come on in, man. This guy's stiff!

460
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,992
Welcome to the Cobra Club.

461
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,917
Well, now,
this is Jeff's first time. So...

462
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,639
Don't worry. We'll take
good care of him, man.

463
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,800
Where do you want us?

464
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,296
- Right there, man.
- Thank you. I'll take a shéjiû.

465
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,514
- One?
- Yup.

466
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,715
- Yeah. Two.
- Two?

467
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,155
- Whatever he's having.
- Two shéjiûs coming up.

468
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,515
So? A little different
than you were expecting?

469
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,239
I gotta tell you. Spice and I
don't sit very well together.

470
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,869
There's certain ramifications the next
day, you know, toilet-wise, but...

471
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,268
This is not that.

472
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,749
Okay? It's not spicy,
but this is the real stuff.

473
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,989
Oh, I'm ready.

474
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,816
Actually, it reminds me
of when I went kayaking

475
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,035
down the Pearl River to Zhongshan.

476
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,754
It's just beautiful. A lot of places,

477
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,159
just like this.

478
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,276
You have a fascinating job.

479
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,920
- Come on. So do you, Jeff.
- Yes.

480
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,592
I'm sure you could
tell me some stories.

481
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,310
I could tell you some stories
to make your skin crawl.

482
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,193
But I'm in HR.

483
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,176
There's a certain wall
of secrecy around me, so...

484
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,997
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me.

485
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,696
I'd probably just get in trouble
from corporate.

486
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,995
You wouldn't actually kill me.
It's just an expression.

487
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,991
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,832
- Here we go. All right.
- Okay.

489
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,195
Look at all these
little ethnic condiments.

490
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,633
- So cool.
- That is...

491
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,312
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

492
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,719
Try this. Mmm...

493
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,429
Okay.

494
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,240
Mmm...

495
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,719
Wow! That's good!

496
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,317
What is that? That looks like a snake.

497
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,515
Shéjiû, man.

498
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,874
Snake wine.

499
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,069
That's real cobra.

500
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,558
The alcohol neutralizes
most of the venom.

501
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,278
Yeah, in Guangdong,
old dudes say

502
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,352
you drink snake wine,
makes your sack hang real low, man.

503
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,793
Does it?

504
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,837
Do you have a Arnold Palmer by chance?

505
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,056
You guys want to hear
about tonight's offering?

506
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,310
Yes. Show us what you got. Thank you.

507
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,797
Where did you find this place? Yelp?

508
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,958
It's my job to find places like this.

509
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,077
I talk to people, I go places.
And when I find a place that I like,

510
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,680
I like to share it with people I like.

511
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,320
Shéjiû! Okay, that's a live snake!

512
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,072
Yes, Jeff. It's a snake restaurant.

513
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,839
Yeah, but Panda Express,
they don't serve panda.

514
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,309
Do they?

515
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,595
They call this "the 100-pace viper,"

516
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,478
because if it bites you, that's how
far you're gonna get, man.

517
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,959
- Is that true?
- No!

518
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,553
It's not true.

519
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,960
It's probably closer to 50 paces,

520
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,956
- honestly. It's very potent.
- Pretty bad, man.

521
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,873
I'm afraid of snakes.
I'll eat 'em. But, I'm so sorry.

522
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,896
Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's very good at his job.

523
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,434
Come on, sit down, okay?
Just let him do his thing.

524
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
- Yes.
- You're in good hands.

525
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,312
- Yes.
- Okay? Trust me.

526
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,296
You're gonna wanna keep
your hands away from the head,

527
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,880
'cause it can actually still bite you.
So, just be very careful.

528
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,713
Can I have a vegetable spring roll?

529
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,313
Buddy...

530
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,719
You're gonna be just fine. Here.

531
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,074
- A little more of that.
- Yeah.

532
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,280
- Yeah.
- Okay? This is good.

533
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,096
- We might need another bottle of this.
- Yeah.

534
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,997
Let's go ahead and get loosened up.

535
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,116
- Yeah. Snake it up.
- Yeah.

536
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,152
One second. That's Karen. Hello?

537
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,470
Remember I told you something
was off about the Joneses?

538
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,278
Well, my instincts were right.

539
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,080
I just followed Natalie to the mall
and I have two words for you.

540
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,273
Sarah Palin.

541
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,909
And guess what?

542
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,036
There is a Chinese word
for cul-de-sac. It's...

543
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,829
I'm sorry, I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

544
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,639
The point is, the Joneses
are not who they say they are.

545
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,273
Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.

546
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,796
Karen, I'm-I'm actually,
lunching with, uh, Tim right now.

547
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,519
There's nothing weird
going on whatsoever. I think...

548
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,440
I think you're just sublimating
your anxiety about the kids.

549
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,869
You're having insecurities
about, you know, your career...

550
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,359
Don't even begin to go there!

551
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,256
I don't throw your man crush
in your face.

552
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:49,352
I don't have a man crush!
I don't have a man crush.

553
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,193
I had it once in my life,
when I was a boy.

554
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,555
- You mean Bruce?
- She likes to be called Caitlyn.

555
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,431
No, no, no,
you're absolutely right.

556
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,757
- Hello, Karen.
- Natalie!

557
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,474
What a surprise!

558
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,871
You've got no clothes on.
You're on the phone.

559
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,712
I'm gonna go.

560
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,398
To be continued.

561
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,437
I was just leaving Tim a voice mail.

562
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,589
Oh...

563
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,148
He likes to hear from me
when I'm trying on lingerie.

564
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,354
I tell him what I'm putting on,
how it looks.

565
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,595
How it makes me feel.

566
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,856
It looks great!
I'm sure he...

567
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,313
I'm sure he's happy to know that.

568
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,176
Tell him from me.

569
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,591
Yeah, it's one of our things.
Keeps the spark alive.

570
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,636
Do you and Jeff
have a thing?

571
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,393
Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.

572
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,039
We...

573
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,918
We do it really fast in case
the kids come running into our room.

574
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,715
Sounds like you're very sexual people.

575
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,670
- But your kids are gone, aren't they?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

576
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,911
Time for something new.
Is that why you're buying lingerie?

577
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,479
Yes.

578
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,437
Let's see what you decided on.

579
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,353
No.
I mean, I just... It's just stuff.

580
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,749
Come on. Show me
what you think is sexy.

581
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,439
They're for Jeff's mom.

582
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,796
She's morbidly obese.
She drives around on a scooter.

583
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,400
I feel really bad for...

584
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,078
Let's be real with one another, okay?

585
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,718
And he's dating
Sheila Rondowski,

586
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,995
I think is her name, on the sly,

587
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,896
which is a big no-no,
'cause she's his superior.

588
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,955
Sure.

589
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,758
This stuff is so good, Tim.
It's delicious.

590
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,512
- Didn't I tell you?
- Mmm-m.

591
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,115
I tell ya... Listen. It is impressive
how people open up to you.

592
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,236
- They tell you a lot.
- They do.

593
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,616
It sounds like they complain
a lot, but...

594
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,916
Oh, gosh! It comes with the territory.
I'm fine with it. But, yes.

595
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,149
Let me ask you this.

596
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,755
Does anybody ever say
to you in confidence

597
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,794
how much they hate the company?

598
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,632
Ricky, let's get some more wine!

599
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,631
Hold a grudge? Anything like that?

600
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,712
Sara Patel, she has
irritable bowel syndro...

601
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,950
Excuse me. She has
irritable bowel syndrome.

602
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,514
There's a lot of co-workers,
too, that sit near the bathroom.

603
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,640
Sometimes, we're all irritated
by your bowels, Sara.

604
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,358
Everybody on the fourth floor knows.

605
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,656
But that's not what I'm talking about.

606
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,511
Is there ever a situation
where somebody seems

607
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,113
like they came into a lot of money,

608
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,555
or they, you know,
they bought a new car or new clothes?

609
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,136
- Looks like they won the lottery?
- Yes.

610
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,388
- Or hit the jackpot?
- Yeah.

611
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,596
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Sanjay. He bought a Grillbot.

612
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,749
What's that?

613
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,216
That's the guy I work with.
His name's Sanjay.

614
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,913
No, I know what Sanjay is.
What's a Grillbot?

615
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,594
Oh, grillbot is like... It's just a...

616
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,752
It's just a... What it is, is a robot
that cleans your barbecue grill.

617
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,831
You just put it in your grill,
you shut the lid,

618
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:57,469
and it just kind of ruminates in there
and gets all the little coal pieces,

619
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,313
the little icky pieces up.
And it's, you know, spick and span!

620
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
It's like a Roomba for your grill.

621
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,310
I'm thinking more of like the...
Like, like... More expensive.

622
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,960
These are $99, Tim. Expensive stuff.

623
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,268
Right.

624
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,576
But you gotta make sure the grill's
off. Sanjay didn't do that.

625
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,477
Are we done talking
about the Grillbot?

626
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,136
If you're not gonna eat this,
I'm gonna eat this.

627
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,991
No, no, no, go ahead.
Take what you like.

628
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,274
The thing is,

629
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,716
is he voided the warranty
on the Grillbot and the grill.

630
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,109
Jesus, Jeff! Ricky!

631
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,679
Oh, God! Put it down. Ricky!

632
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,512
Oh, man! I've never seen that before.

633
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,749
Go find the shot!

634
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,034
The antivenom. Go get it!

635
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,235
Hey, little buddy!

636
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,039
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
No, no. Hey.

637
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,155
He's snacking on my hand.

638
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,719
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

639
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,949
All right. Get it out!

640
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,800
We're all gonna
have to have a relationship.

641
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,957
Hold on. We're gonna get the antivenom
okay, Jeff? Hold on a second.

642
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,951
You got it? All right.
Hold on, hold on.

643
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,136
- How does that feel, buddy?
- Huh?

644
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,388
How does that feel?

645
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,312
That's good.

646
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,111
Now this would be incredible on you.

647
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,633
Perfect, I'll take it.

648
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,191
You're not being fun, Karen.

649
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,796
I want you to forget everything you
heard about functional breast support.

650
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,719
Why are you so nervous?

651
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,640
Hmm?

652
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:16,552
Is it because we're two women
trying on lingerie together?

653
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,114
Or because I know
you were following me today?

654
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,589
I wasn't following. What? No! No!

655
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,336
I was at the mall. I was shopping.
I wonder if they have this in yellow.

656
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,794
- Jeff's favorite color is yellow.
- I'm not stupid, Karen.

657
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,555
You're right to follow me.

658
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,918
To be thinking that this woman
is not who she pretends to be.

659
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,272
Because I'm hiding something.

660
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,229
You are?

661
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,675
So are you.

662
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,310
We're so alike, you and I.

663
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,235
Two strong, sexually vibrant women.
And yet, here we are.

664
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,074
Forced to bury our true selves
from the Meg Craverstons of the world.

665
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,957
What's Meg got to do with this?

666
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,268
Oh, come on, Karen.

667
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,079
I hear the way she talks about me
when she thinks I'm not looking.

668
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,997
Hating me for the way I look,

669
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,597
as if perfect bone structure and
flawless skin is something I can help!

670
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,277
I may not need to moisturize,
but I still have feelings.

671
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,959
I didn't know about the feelings.

672
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,520
That's why women like us
need to stick together.

673
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,431
Not follow each other in malls.

674
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,914
Do you Kegel?

675
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,594
- Kegel?
- Mmm-hmm.

676
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,830
You mean the exercises
for the lady parts?

677
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,434
Strength has to start somewhere.

678
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,511
Not... I don't.

679
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,596
In fact, I'm doing some right now.

680
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,830
I could crack a walnut down there,
if I needed to.

681
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,914
Have you ever had any need to?

682
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Now you go.

683
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,359
- I couldn't crack anything down there.
- Are we still hiding?

684
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,156
Come on, Karen.
Just... channel your power.

685
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,719
Okay. I'll do it. I'll try.

686
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,193
I did it! I felt it!

687
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,754
How was that?

688
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,469
Work in progress.

689
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,716
Now, you have a choice.

690
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,993
Which Karen do you wanna be?

691
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,639
Karen, the meek?

692
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,119
Or Karen, the strong?

693
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,471
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm okay. Yeah.

694
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,875
You saved my life.

695
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,713
And that was some good snake.

696
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,032
I'm embarrassed though.

697
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,233
Little drunk.

698
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,390
You had me worried there for a second.

699
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,311
Get yourself cleaned up.
I'll get the check.

700
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,359
I know what you're doing, Tim.

701
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,032
What am I doing, Jeff?

702
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,031
I read people for a living.
That's what I do.

703
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,873
And, you know, you get me drunk
on snake wine

704
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,030
and get me to open up
and tell you secrets.

705
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,909
You...

706
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,591
are trying to make a friend.

707
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,520
I got a lot of friends, Jeff.

708
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,319
Yeah, but you have a lot
of secrets locked inside of you.

709
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,912
I think that's why you might be one
of the loneliest guys I've ever met.

710
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,800
Now, what do you have
to say about that?

711
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,159
You wanna know something about me?

712
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,069
Sometimes I hate what I do
for a living.

713
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,237
But doesn't that feel good?

714
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,151
To express yourself?

715
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,514
- Is this us bonding now?
- No, this is us talking.

716
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,397
You want bonding?
I'll show you bonding.

717
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,355
You're gonna look at me.
I'm gonna button you up.

718
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,278
Okay. Okay. That's loud.

719
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Whoa!

720
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,672
Jesus, you do this for fun?

721
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,398
I got you, okay?

722
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,632
Isn't this a blast?

723
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,835
Yeah!

724
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,394
- Hey, Karen! Karen?
- Hey, I'm here!

725
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,675
Hi, Karen. How are you?
I brought you some flowers.

726
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,358
Oh, thank you, honey!

727
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,351
You're not gonna believe
the day that I had.

728
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,795
Guess who likes being
a man-bird as much as I do?

729
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,029
- Who?
- Tim Jones.

730
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,616
Look at that. Why are you wearing
a robe? Are you sick?

731
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,437
Oh, nice. Honey,

732
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm just thinking.
What am I really doing this summer?

733
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,753
I mean, I sent the kids away to camp,
I'm redesigning bathrooms.

734
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,319
Is that what makes me happy?

735
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,914
Is that what makes me,
Karen Gaffney, complete?

736
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,552
Okay, well, listen,
if you wanna feel complete,

737
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,710
there's some exercises
I do at work with the guys...

738
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,791
Honey, no. They don't work.

739
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,872
Now, I've lost touch
with the real Karen.

740
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,239
And then these amazing
new neighbors move in

741
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,629
and with me feeling so vulnerable,
it's only natural

742
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:26,314
that I would get suspicious
and find fault with them.

743
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,076
But really, I just feel like
I should be focusing on me.

744
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,434
And on us.

745
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,136
Sweet baby Jesus,
what's happening?

746
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,799
Natalie said we needed a thing
to keep our spark alive.

747
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,496
You've been talking to Natalie
about us sexually?

748
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,954
No, obviously.
I didn't tell her anything, honey.

749
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,474
No, I just mean
she's unusually intuitive.

750
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,675
- For a Greek.
- Right.

751
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,591
And she just thinks
that once you're married

752
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,840
at a certain point,
you have to make more of an effort.

753
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,354
This is the Karen that I...
This is the Karen that I love.

754
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,510
I really do. Take me.

755
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,352
Take me, darling.

756
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,429
Okay.

757
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Oh!

758
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,399
Shoot, honey.

759
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,678
It was the conversation piece.

760
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,635
Don't worry about it.

761
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
Oh...

762
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,829
What is that?

763
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,592
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Come on.

764
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,999
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

765
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,198
You know what, honey?
We need to go back to our lovemaking.

766
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,554
- Where were we?
- Yeah, okay.

767
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,240
- It's so hot! It's so hot!
- Yeah. Okay, I... Should I grope you?

768
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,269
- Great!
- Yeah.

769
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,715
Let's go back. Oh, Jeff, Jeff!

770
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,678
- It's so hot!
- So, you are sick?

771
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,955
You know what?
I'll tell you what we should do.

772
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,640
We should put on a soundtrack
for our passion.

773
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,280
You want a little passion music?
This calls for The Judds.

774
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,920
- We're gonna put on some music.
- Okay.

775
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,656
I'm going to put the wine glasses
in the dishwasher.

776
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,477
Right. Okay, so you got...
You wanna narrate!

777
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,039
Okay. All right. I got you. So...

778
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,076
And then... This is so much fun!

779
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,715
The blood leaves Jeff's head

780
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,109
and slowly makes its way
to his midsection.

781
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,976
I don't know why we're in the closet.

782
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,216
- It seems very un-erotic to me.
- Honey, listen!

783
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,117
Listen! Because
our neighbors bugged us!

784
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,156
Told you something
was wrong with them.

785
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,595
Makes a little more sense
what Tim was doing in your den.

786
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,856
And do not tell me
that he had to poop.

787
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,155
He did not have to go number two.

788
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,760
And now I know
what Natalie was doing at the café.

789
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,554
It was a drop!

790
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,551
A drop? What are you talking about?

791
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,256
I can't believe she duped me
into this lingerie.

792
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,376
But she was in her underwear
and I was in my underwear and...

793
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,960
Oh, my God! She was so persuasive.

794
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,856
Wait. You were both in your
underwear at the same time?

795
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,696
Get your mind out of the gutter!
It was a charade!

796
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,871
Okay, Karen, I just wanna make sure
this isn't another case of paranoia.

797
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,816
Remember the time you made me sleep in
the car 'cause I ate that hot pepper

798
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,120
and you thought I was possessed?

799
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,496
Your eyes were all red. You were
trying to have sex on a school night.

800
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,875
I know, but it was just the jalapeeno.
That's my point.

801
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,712
God! We gotta call the cops!

802
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,856
Call the cops and tell them what?
Our neighbors bugged the house?

803
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,154
- Yes!
- That sounds crazy!

804
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,912
What happens when
we really need the cops?

805
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,433
They won't come to our house. Why?

806
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,750
Because we're on some kind
of crazy list. That's crazy.

807
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,353
You're right. We need more evidence.

808
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,432
- And it's a jalapeño.
- Karen. Karen!

809
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,109
Karen!

810
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,029
Kar... Karen, look.

811
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,792
I know that you miss
Mikey and Patrick,

812
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,518
but parents weekend
is not for two weeks.

813
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,600
Get down!

814
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,496
Parents weekend
isn't for two weeks.

815
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,080
Maybe we can do some
breathing exercises to center you.

816
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:16,709
Jeff, I don't need to do any deep
breathing exercises! I'm centered!

817
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,840
It's quiet over there.

818
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,394
It's too quiet.

819
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,832
They're probably watching us,
watching them.

820
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,151
They're not watching us! They're at
a restaurant with Stacey Chung.

821
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,989
How do you know that?

822
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,548
Because we talked about it
at the indoor skydiving place!

823
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,153
Why didn't you tell me?

824
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,878
Karen, stop!

825
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,235
Darling, stop, please!
Think about what you're doing.

826
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,536
You'll go to jail
for something like this.

827
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,754
Only if I get caught.

828
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,558
See? No fingerprints.

829
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,870
Now, people move in,
they always change the locks,

830
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,030
but they never change
the garage remote.

831
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,656
I forgot to give it back when Bridget
and Dave went to Myrtle Beach

832
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,829
and asked me to feed Smokey.

833
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,393
Are you coming?
You're gonna need to cover your hands.

834
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,277
Cover my hands? With what?

835
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,475
Use your socks.

836
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,915
Oh, God! It looks like a show home.

837
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,432
- They painted over Bridget's mural.
- That's a real tragedy.

838
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,075
Look, there's nothing weird here.
Let's go, let's go!

839
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,833
Karen! There are windows
everywhere. Get down! Get down!

840
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,989
So weird.

841
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,440
Stand up!

842
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,390
These pots have never seen
a lick of flame.

843
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,630
Little weird for someone
with a cooking blog, huh?

844
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,553
Well, it's a new house,
new pots. It makes sense to me.

845
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,632
And an empty spice rack. She wows
the neighbors with her appetizers.

846
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,789
No spices.

847
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,269
Never judge a woman
by her spice rack, Karen.

848
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,998
Check for stuff about
Sri Lankan orphans.

849
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,752
I bet that's another web of lies!

850
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,234
Sorry, Tim, for breaking
into your house.

851
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,072
I just wanted to be your friend.

852
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,656
This certainly isn't
a friendly gesture.

853
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,591
You know what, honey? I can hear you.

854
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,616
And it hurts my feelings
when you're not supportive.

855
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,312
Karen, this is ridiculous!

856
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,957
It's gotta be here somewhere.

857
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,751
Karen! Karen, Karen, Karen!

858
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,557
Look at them. So perfect.

859
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,875
Karen, come on, let's go.

860
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,714
Look at this.

861
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,631
Okay. So, they're gamers.
Let's go.

862
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,431
Karen! Don't! What are you doing?

863
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,029
Stacey Chung.
Isn't she out with the Joneses?

864
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Yeah.

865
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,075
Ted Wallace.

866
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,639
He works with you, right?

867
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,757
Yeah. Maybe it's just some
kind of social media thing.

868
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,193
Dhameer Mustafa?

869
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,793
There's Dan.

870
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
Sanjay.

871
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,157
Oh, God! They're targeting MBI.

872
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,119
There's some kind of missile.

873
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,016
These are all the people
he was asking me about.

874
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,156
Oh, my God! I told him everything.

875
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,719
- Oh, God.
- We've gotta go.

876
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,856
Switch down the computer, honey.

877
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,438
We gotta get out of here.

878
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,199
I can't get any purchase on the mouse
because I have a sock hand.

879
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,456
- Okay, hold on.
- Switch it off! Put it back.

880
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,056
- Karen...
- Put it back the...

881
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,196
No! You don't understand!
They're spies.

882
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,776
- Karen, please, okay? Just shh!
- We gotta go right now!

883
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,936
I need to write
these names down.

884
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,279
What are you doing? We gotta go!

885
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,828
They could be back at any second.

886
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,920
What are you staring at?

887
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,829
What is that? A pen?

888
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,955
What?

889
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,399
- What?
- You have a...

890
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,476
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Now what?

891
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,879
Oh, shit, I killed her.

892
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,234
Karen!

893
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,239
Karen!

894
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,355
Oh, thank God!

895
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,589
Honey.

896
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,671
Okay, we gotta go. Karen, wake up!

897
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,955
Oh, God.

898
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,869
Okay. Okay. Damn!

899
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,039
Sorry. Sorry.

900
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,515
- You're welcome, baby.
- Okay.

901
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,554
- You're so cute!
- Karen, shh!

902
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,551
Okay. Okay.

903
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,996
Why are you shushing me?
They haven't any dogs.

904
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,590
I thought Chili's
was supposed to be fancy.

905
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,636
Yeah, I don't think you ordered well.

906
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,837
Whee!
Remember when we were in college,

907
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,356
and your parents, they almost caught
us in the bushes, and we hid!

908
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,032
Yeah.

909
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,633
Wait, I met you after college.

910
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,276
Oh, my God!

911
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,952
It's almost like our wedding night.

912
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,951
Why did we do that?
What are we doing?

913
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,075
What do we do?

914
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,878
Jeff, you're being so serious!

915
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,992
- I'm Jeff. I'm so serious.
- Karen, Karen, Karen!

916
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,800
- Why are you being so serious?
- Okay.

917
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,115
- Stop licking me!
- Yeah.

918
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,428
Okay, listen. Oh, shit!

919
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,629
Shit.

920
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,199
- I'm getting on top!
- I...

921
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,315
I'm getting on top.

922
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,016
- Karen! Karen! Karen!
- I'm on top!

923
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,917
That makes me feel weird.
Karen, please.

924
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,831
I'm not into this right now,
sweetheart.

925
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,638
I'm not really into this.

926
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,720
- Cuddle me.
- No cuddling! Our neighbors are spies!

927
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,200
- Our neighbors are spies.
- I wanna cuddle. Cuddle me.

928
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,151
Look at them up there.

929
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,590
Probably going upstairs to make sex,
and they won't even think about us.

930
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,156
You broke my heart, Tim Jones.

931
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,558
You broke my heart.

932
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,430
I'm just saying,
the place is called Chili's.

933
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,696
- It's a Mexican place.
- I can't believe...

934
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,336
- I don't know why you would...
- ...we're still talking about that.

935
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,713
...order anything remotely Asian.

936
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,315
Okay. I guess we can cross off Stacey.

937
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,958
She's not going to give us anything.

938
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,270
Hey, do you know what a Grillbot is?

939
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,309
What?

940
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,336
It's this thing. Jeff was telling me
about it the other day.

941
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,511
It's this little robot
that cleans your barbecue...

942
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,511
I hope this is not going to be
a problem.

943
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,669
What?

944
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,319
First rule of what we do. Don't get
too close to your targets. Remember?

945
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,549
Actually...

946
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,519
the first rule of what we do, is to
not fall in love with your partner.

947
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,558
Right? Wasn't that the first rule?

948
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,993
Tim Jones.

949
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,710
What am I going to do with you? Hmm?

950
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,958
I don't know.

951
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,320
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

952
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,316
- I have a few ideas.
- I have some ideas too.

953
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,515
You do?

954
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,512
- Mmm-hmm. Should I start now?
- Yes, you should.

955
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,677
Uh... Okay. Okay.

956
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,791
Well, that might be a problem.

957
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,872
Hey, buddy. Can I use your computer?

958
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,991
I need to check
my fantasy baseball roster.

959
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,229
Go ahead. Go ahead.

960
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,514
Thanks.

961
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,033
What is happening?

962
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,634
You okay, Jeff?
You seem kind of distant.

963
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,598
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

964
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,911
sifting through the wreckage
of every value I once held dear.

965
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,073
Good. I was worried
it might be something real.

966
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,555
Hey, Dan.

967
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,399
Dan!

968
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,156
The Joneses aren't
who they say they are.

969
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,080
What are you talking about?

970
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,995
Your phone.

971
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,437
Okay. Okay.

972
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,635
Spies?

973
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,834
But it's not like that,
I swear!

974
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,176
Sometimes she picks up on things.
This time she was right.

975
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,872
You have to take this upstairs, Carl!

976
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,077
This company, my neighborhood,

977
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,789
Western civilization as we know it,
they're all at risk.

978
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,552
And it might be my fault.

979
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,356
All right, Gaffney.
I'll do some digging.

980
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,709
Okay. Thank you.

981
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,552
See what I can learn
about these devices.

982
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,757
And if I find out they're real,
and not from some hobby shop,

983
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,559
- well, you wait for my call.
- Okay.

984
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,755
Go for Jeff.

985
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,308
I gotta say, Gaffney,
you and your wife were right.

986
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,149
You know those devices you gave me?
I was talking to a friend of mine.

987
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,633
Ex-military.

988
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,792
And well, this line is unsecured,
so I can't go into details,

989
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,919
but let me just say,
this stuff is the real shit!

990
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,197
God! Okay. Who are the Joneses
working for? Are they Russian?

991
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,429
Damn it, Gaffney.

992
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,114
What is it about the word
"unsecured" that you don't get?

993
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,680
Look, I'm gonna do some more digging,

994
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,194
and then you meet with me
before work tomorrow.

995
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,679
Okay.

996
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,711
You know the old MBI building? On 75?

997
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,711
7:00 a.m. Just look for the van.

998
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,994
Why are we meeting there?

999
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,550
Well, so we can strategize
before we take it upstairs!

1000
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,560
My buddy says the last time
he saw tech like that

1001
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,318
was on a dead man.

1002
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,600
Dead man? Why would you say...

1003
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,915
Jesus!

1004
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,116
"Jesus" is right.

1005
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,837
Gaffney, this is the big time!
I mean, we are going all the way.

1006
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,176
- Not now, Carl. Not now.
- Don't try to give me the brush off.

1007
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,896
If you think you're gonna
handle this yourself...

1008
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,070
- Okay, okay.
- ...you're making a big mistake!

1009
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,679
- Work buddy.
- Gaffney, don't mess this up!

1010
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,880
- Carl! Okay, yeah. Good.
- 7:00 a. m. Bring lattes...

1011
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,200
You okay there, buddy?
You almost ran me over.

1012
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,953
Yeah, I was looking for Bernie.
He keeps pooping

1013
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:43,231
in my yard and I was just...
I mean, his dogs keep

1014
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,357
pooping in my yard. I was distracted.

1015
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,789
How are you?

1016
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,280
You don't seem like yourself, Jeff.

1017
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,719
You don't seem like yourself, Tim.

1018
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,074
What's that supposed to mean?

1019
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,238
I was... You said it to me. I was...
What did you mean when you said it?

1020
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,837
We think we had a break-in last night.

1021
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,349
- What?
- Yeah. I know. Really rocks your

1022
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,112
faith in the notion of trust,
doesn't it?

1023
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,437
Tell me about it. My gosh!

1024
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:05,696
You'd think in a neighborhood
like this

1025
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,376
you wouldn't have to worry
about something like that.

1026
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,879
I'm so sorry about that, Tim.

1027
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,519
Yeah, well, Jeff,
here's the thing about trust.

1028
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,432
Once it's gone, bad things happen.

1029
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,674
I heard that.

1030
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,069
Okay, well, I should go.

1031
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,752
Karen and I are supposed to
take a bath.

1032
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,029
Yeah, a little warning.
Carl can be a bit prickly,

1033
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,793
but he's a top notch security man
and he happens to like the way

1034
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,871
- your mind thinks, okay?
- Okay.

1035
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,390
Is that him in the bathrobe
hanging laundry?

1036
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,275
I don't know.
Maybe he's having a yard sale.

1037
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,237
Gaffney, right on time!

1038
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,073
And you brought the lattes.
Knew I could count on you.

1039
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,799
This is my wife Carl.
I mean, this is my wife, Carl.

1040
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,029
Nice to meet you.

1041
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:08,216
- Nice to meet you.
- Karen Gaffney.

1042
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,629
Yeah, well, welcome
to my home away from home.

1043
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,870
Or to be more accurate, my home.

1044
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,872
But not for long.
Here, please. Thank you.

1045
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:17,109
Sit down here.

1046
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,918
Let me just clear this stuff away.

1047
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,798
Get this laundry outta here.

1048
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:23,960
Uh...

1049
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,794
It's the maid's day off.

1050
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,030
Not at all. It's just that

1051
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,991
when you told us to meet you
at the van,

1052
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,678
I didn't realize
you'd be living in it.

1053
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,557
Yeah, well, the truth is...

1054
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,680
you know, I've been living
in the old Westfalia here

1055
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,190
ever since my wife left me
and took everything I had.

1056
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,077
- Sorry, Carl.
- That's terrible.

1057
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,799
And now thanks to you for bringing me
in on this deal, Jeff.

1058
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,161
I think things are finally
starting to break my way again!

1059
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,468
What do you have for us?

1060
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,274
Oh, boy, what have I got?
Let me show you here.

1061
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,712
You know, here's something that Jeff
never thought he'd hear. Gaffney...

1062
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,553
are you ready for a level four
security clearance?

1063
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,228
- Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.

1064
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,594
- Carl.
- Yeah?

1065
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,750
You got like a red dot
on your forehead.

1066
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,680
It's called adult acne.
Thank you very mu...

1067
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,199
God!

1068
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,395
I've been hit!

1069
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,756
I've been hit! I've been hit!

1070
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:16,719
Oh, my God! Shit.

1071
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,080
- Are you hurt?
- I've been shot!

1072
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,310
God! No, honey, it's just the latte!

1073
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,118
It burns! It burns!

1074
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,071
Oh, shit! It's the Joneses!

1075
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,312
Try not to shoot them.

1076
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,992
Let's run for Carl's house.

1077
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,752
Oh, God!

1078
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,999
Get in the car! Now!

1079
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,469
Let us get on with
our stupid little lives!

1080
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:46,672
Get in the car now
and I will explain everything. Mostly.

1081
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,796
I'm tired of your
silver-tongued lies, Jones!

1082
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,269
Do you wanna get killed
out here? Get in the car!

1083
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,993
Why? So you could kill us in there?

1084
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,509
There were no spices
in your spice rack!

1085
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,834
I said get in the car.

1086
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,799
We're gonna get in the car.

1087
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,754
For Patrick and Mikey. Right, honey?

1088
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,871
Guys, now. It is very dangerous. Now!

1089
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,349
When I count to three
we're gonna run, okay?

1090
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,431
One... Two...

1091
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,915
Jeff!

1092
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,956
- Oh, my God!
- I said three!

1093
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:17,191
Jeff, please, would you
just get in the car?

1094
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,320
I was making a head start!

1095
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,554
On your wife?

1096
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,056
You two are acting like children
right now.

1097
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,150
Now, get in the car.
Right now. Get in this car.

1098
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,834
Put your seat belt on,
for Christ's sake.

1099
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,216
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

1100
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,880
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go, let's go.

1101
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,719
What is going on here, Tim?

1102
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,160
Are you stealing secrets from MBI?

1103
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,838
We're not stealing secrets from you.

1104
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,558
- There they are.
- I see them.

1105
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,119
We're spies.

1106
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,656
His seat belt is jammed!
Pull over.

1107
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,829
Shut up!

1108
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,256
Jeff gets car sick
in the back!

1109
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,838
- Quiet!
- Shut up!

1110
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,869
You broke into our house.

1111
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,632
What kind of neighbors are you?

1112
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,240
You planted a bug in our house.
What kind of neighbors are you?

1113
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,631
You know, they kind of have a point.

1114
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,515
It's so hot in here.

1115
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,800
- Put the AC on. Please!
- No.

1116
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,056
Can you turn the
air conditioner on, please?

1117
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,275
- It's not going on!
- It's hot.

1118
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,031
My seat belt's not on! Wait!

1119
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,872
Okay, it's about to get weird.

1120
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,678
About to get weird?

1121
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,919
Quick question. Are you guys
the good guys or bad guys?

1122
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,549
What do you think?

1123
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,915
- I think the guys in black...
- Shit!

1124
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,514
...on the motorcycles shooting at us
might be the bad guys.

1125
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,240
Get down, get down, get down!

1126
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:01,914
What is that?

1127
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,639
It's camp.

1128
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:04,994
What?

1129
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,270
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

1130
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,156
- The cookies are for both of you.
- Karen!

1131
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,595
Mikey, if you split it,
he gets to choose first.

1132
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,119
- Karen!
- Because that's fair!

1133
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,993
Get down! Get down
Karen, get off the phone!

1134
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,190
Because otherwise you would
make one piece bigger.

1135
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,316
And then you'd pick that one.
Put Mikey on, put...

1136
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,311
Just split the cookie!
Just split the cookie!

1137
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,555
Oh, shit!

1138
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,359
To the right, Natalie.

1139
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,555
Thanks, Karen.

1140
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,515
Brake!

1141
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,839
Oh, my God!

1142
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:09,354
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1143
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,313
Please get out of the way.

1144
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,709
Please get out of the way
so I can see.

1145
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,920
There's something blinking on the back
of the car. Is that bad?

1146
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,637
Yes, Jeff, that is decidedly bad.

1147
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,400
You need to go out there
and take that off.

1148
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,755
- Wha... I need to take it off?
- Yes!

1149
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,398
- Well, can you slow down?
- No!

1150
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,136
- I'm driving. We're being chased.
- Get it off!

1151
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,736
I'm not gonna slow down.
They're trying to kill us!

1152
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,440
Right. Coming from the guy who
wouldn't turn on the air conditioner.

1153
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,913
Slow down a little bit.

1154
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,070
I'm getting wet! I'm getting wet!

1155
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,997
Getting wet is better
than getting shot!

1156
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,149
It's hot!

1157
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,456
Three targets, two shots.
You got this?

1158
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,754
Always.

1159
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,510
How you doing back there, Jeff?
We need you, buddy.

1160
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,434
Wait.

1161
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,832
- Okay.
- Wait.

1162
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,069
Now.

1163
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,756
I got it! I got it! Now what?

1164
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,034
Hold on, Jeff!

1165
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:38,989
Throw it! Throw it!

1166
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:48,720
Oh!

1167
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:54,275
Five here? So, what do you think?
I think I'm stuck.

1168
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,670
Yeah. Well, I think one, two, three,
four, five... It's gotta be six.

1169
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,954
Here we go, folks.

1170
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,315
- Scrambled whites with toast.
- Thank you.

1171
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,516
- Three-egg omelet with potatoes.
- Thank you!

1172
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,239
Eggs, potatoes, and bacon.
And a side of bacon.

1173
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,595
- Yum, yum, yum, yum!
- Thank you very much.

1174
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,359
Oh, my goodness!

1175
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,230
Mmm. Mmm.

1176
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,996
What? High speed car chases
make me hungry, honey.

1177
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,313
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's
who, you know, you really are.

1178
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,277
I have a couple of questions. And...

1179
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,320
I think this time
we kind of deserve the truth.

1180
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,799
You're entitled to it.

1181
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,916
Okay, question number one.

1182
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,268
Are you in the CIA?

1183
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,400
Honey, that's a wasted question.
They can't answer that.

1184
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,956
Question number two then.
Who are you after?

1185
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,034
We can't tell you.

1186
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,949
Okay. Question number three.
Is it somebody we know?

1187
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,234
Can't say that, either.

1188
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,016
You just said we were
entitled to the truth.

1189
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,976
Did say you were entitled to it.
Doesn't mean we can give it to you.

1190
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,035
You know what, honey?

1191
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,136
It's probably classified.
That's why they can't tell us.

1192
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,833
- Do you want any of this?
- Yeah. I'll have some potatoes.

1193
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,672
I'm glad everybody's just

1194
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:00,149
enjoying their meal
while we're in the middle

1195
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,356
of a... Like, a thing!

1196
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,496
You guys are just eating
like there's nothing going on.

1197
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,033
I'm a little troubled by it!

1198
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,950
Honey! That is not okay.

1199
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,231
Fine. I'll keep asking 'til I get
something that's not classified.

1200
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,389
Is that fine with you?

1201
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,549
Okay.

1202
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:21,912
Question 17.

1203
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,798
After a shootout like that,
who cleans up all the bullets?

1204
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,240
Okay, can you guys
tell us anything at all?

1205
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,550
I'm not Greek. I'm Israeli.

1206
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:33,760
Ex-Mossad?

1207
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,509
Can't tell you.

1208
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,000
Come on. Are you guys even married?

1209
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,639
Can you even tell us that?

1210
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,993
Yes. That actually you can't fake.

1211
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,794
But that's it?
Everything else was a lie?

1212
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,836
I mean, 'cause I think when you
told me that you hated your job,

1213
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,390
that seemed real. I mean,
from an HR perspective.

1214
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,152
That seemed real.

1215
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,276
You told him you hate your job?

1216
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:05,628
I may have mentioned
certain misgivings, in confidence.

1217
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,113
Interesting.

1218
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,548
Why is this coming out now?

1219
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,036
Because Jeff is actually
a good listener.

1220
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,953
And I did mention that
to you before, in Marrakesh.

1221
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:17,111
At that place that
we always go to. Hazim's.

1222
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,576
That day, we spent the whole
afternoon there.

1223
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,194
We talked about maybe getting
out of this. We talked about

1224
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,597
I could actually become
a travel writer, for real.

1225
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:26,874
We could maybe have a child.

1226
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,616
That was hypothetical.
It wasn't a life plan.

1227
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:29,914
I didn't think it...

1228
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,816
Okay, this is what we do.
Automatically, we go to Hebrew

1229
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,512
and then it's gonna be a whole thing.

1230
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,160
And who puts a bug
in a glass sculpture?

1231
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,816
I happen to like my glass sculptures
and I like to share them with people.

1232
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,496
It's a legitimate thing.
It's actually appropriate

1233
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,556
to give somebody a gift.
What isn't appropriate,

1234
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,837
however, is what you happened
to wear at the yard party.

1235
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,960
Now you want me to dress
like some kind of a sexless

1236
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,456
- elementary school nurse...
- Come on. I'm not talking...

1237
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,096
...just to fit in with
the other mothers, right?

1238
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,336
- No offense, Karen.
- You look great!

1239
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:54,430
You look amazing.
But you have to fit in.

1240
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,431
I mean, it's called being undercover.

1241
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,597
I mean, you had no problem
wearing a burqa in Kabul.

1242
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:00,680
But this is the suburbs!

1243
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,911
It's hard. Don't you get it?
Women here are vicious.

1244
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,991
Can I say? You don't know
the women here.

1245
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,909
There you go.

1246
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:09,035
We don't know anything.

1247
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,473
Why did you bug our house?

1248
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,040
Actually, you know less than nothing.

1249
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,151
But the agency received credible intel

1250
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,198
that someone was using your
work computer to commit treason

1251
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,840
against the United States of America.

1252
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,069
We were using you
to get to whoever they are.

1253
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,280
Why not tell him everything?

1254
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,629
Who cares?

1255
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:27,554
Ten years, 30 countries,
nobody finds us out,

1256
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:30,313
and we couldn't even
last a week in suburbia!

1257
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,833
Can I pay, please?

1258
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,515
Stupid question.
What do we do now?

1259
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:50,635
Yeah, what do we do now?

1260
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,278
Just stick to your routine.

1261
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:54,948
And nobody finds out
about any of this, okay?

1262
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:56,519
I won't tell anybody.

1263
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:57,635
Yeah, keep it quiet.

1264
01:04:57,720 --> 01:04:59,438
There's this other thing
I needed to ask.

1265
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,513
I know you guys are undercover and
this whole thing is a setup, but...

1266
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:04,696
The other day at the Cobra Club,

1267
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,439
was that about getting me drunk
and having me betray my co-workers

1268
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,833
or was that about two guys, you know,
maybe starting a friendship?

1269
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,957
It was about getting you drunk
and betraying your co-workers.

1270
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:18,631
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1271
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,153
But the indoor skydiving...

1272
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,856
that was about being friends.

1273
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,553
Ha! See, I told you we bonded.

1274
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,234
Okay. Remember,
nobody finds out about this.

1275
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,669
- No. I won't even tell my mom.
- Locking it up. Hey, hey.

1276
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,515
One other thing. I know I'm not
a licensed therapist, okay?

1277
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,557
But talk, communicate
with one another, okay?

1278
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,835
Jeff is big on communication.

1279
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,840
I communicate. That's what I do.

1280
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:46,598
- You sure do.
- Talk, talk, talk.

1281
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,194
No, no, no, no, no.
You're absolutely right, Jeff.

1282
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:52,191
Communication is a great thing.

1283
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,874
- All right, I'll see you.
- Bye!

1284
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,678
- Thanks!
- I should go.

1285
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,079
- Okay. Take care.
- See you.

1286
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,119
That's so nice of you
to tell them that, honey. Really.

1287
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,176
I think the Joneses
are going to be just fine.

1288
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,474
Yeah.

1289
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,030
- After you, my dear.
- Thank you.

1290
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:32,874
Timmy!

1291
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,192
Well, it was most likely
just a gas leak. So...

1292
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,111
Well, thank you for your statements.

1293
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,713
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.

1294
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,158
Okay.

1295
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,674
Whoever killed the Joneses
are gonna come after us next.

1296
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,752
Do you think we did the right thing
by lying to the police?

1297
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:18,115
We promised the Joneses
that we wouldn't say anything.

1298
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:19,792
Do you think that
promises count, honey,

1299
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,616
when the people that we made
them to are dead?

1300
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:22,709
Yes!

1301
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,120
Plus,
I don't wanna be haunted.

1302
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:30,256
They've taken
the barricades down.

1303
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,474
Oh, my God!

1304
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:33,336
All right, listen,
I'm gonna grab the essentials.

1305
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,536
We're gonna need our passports.

1306
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,696
We're gonna need
our birth certificates.

1307
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:36,856
And we'll need some duct tape.

1308
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,154
Get some peppercorns, too!

1309
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,998
- Mikey...
- Coffee, teas, Goldfish.

1310
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,713
I'm gonna get these onions here.

1311
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,776
- Don't take the onions, put 'em back.
- No, no, no, no.

1312
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,279
- You don't need onions.
- I need...

1313
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,476
- Trail mix!
- I can't choose.

1314
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,152
This is a 2,000-piece puzzle.

1315
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,228
- This is a weapon.
- Yeah! Or we can make chicken parm.

1316
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,456
- It would be nice to have...
- What! You always buy this.

1317
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,136
You should buy the organic one.
I've been through this with you.

1318
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,656
I don't wanna talk about that
right now.

1319
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,477
Jeff, don't take the ginger snaps!

1320
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,959
I know, but we might need...

1321
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,678
- Calm down, Jeff.
- Okay!

1322
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:04,669
I'm taking this Red Bull.

1323
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,909
Where are we going?

1324
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,096
I don't know. Anywhere. Just pack!

1325
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,553
I've never been on the run before.

1326
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,074
I mean, should I take a bikini,
in case it's gonna get hot?

1327
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,072
No! A bathing suit? Take socks!
Socks! I need my socks.

1328
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,151
We gotta get the kids.
We gotta get my mom!

1329
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:20,236
Don't bring her into this!
We said twice a year.

1330
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,389
Christmas and Easter!

1331
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:23,675
Oh, God! Okay. Okay.

1332
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,229
- Okay. You know what?
- Karen.

1333
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,673
It's probably just a fuse.

1334
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,314
Because a house exploded, it could
just be a problem with the grid.

1335
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,435
Yeah.

1336
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,176
Maybe you should check
the fuse box, honey.

1337
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,872
- Okay, yeah.
- And I'm gonna just...

1338
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,359
stay here and pack.

1339
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,077
Maybe you should
go with me to the fuse box.

1340
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,276
That way you're not, uh, alone.

1341
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,473
Okay, here we go.

1342
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,676
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. There we go.

1343
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,239
There it is. There it is.

1344
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,349
Okay.

1345
01:08:58,480 --> 01:08:59,696
It was just the circuit breaker.

1346
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,597
- It's okay.
- Good Lord!

1347
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:04,400
Don't scream. It's not what you think.

1348
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,278
What, you didn't kidnap our friends
and tie them to chairs?

1349
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,160
It is what you think. But it's
not for the reasons you think.

1350
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,954
Dan is the one
selling secrets from MBI.

1351
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:17,400
What?

1352
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,096
- You're right. She's very good.
- Told you.

1353
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,519
Dan, is that true?

1354
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:23,357
And how are you two alive?
Your house exploded.

1355
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,512
Jeff, things aren't
always what they seem.

1356
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,073
You should know that by now.

1357
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,520
So?

1358
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:49,716
How could you not tell me
you were feeling this way?

1359
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:50,800
Well, look...

1360
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,474
To be honest, you are not exactly
the easiest woman in the world

1361
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,949
- for a man to admit his fears to.
- What?

1362
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:59,191
How can you say that to me?
I'm compassionate and sensitive.

1363
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,554
You can say anything to me.

1364
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:05,113
Well, calling me a pussy
in Hebrew is not helping things.

1365
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:11,828
Run.

1366
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,120
Whoa!

1367
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,350
You dove headfirst
through a plate glass window?

1368
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,351
It's not as hard as it seems.

1369
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,351
Who's behind all this?
Who's trying to kill you?

1370
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:30,910
It's an international arms dealer
who calls himself The Scorpion.

1371
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,116
The Agency's been after him for years.

1372
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,033
And your friends here
were about to sell him these.

1373
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,280
That's what we make at MBI?

1374
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,429
- What are these?
- Microchips.

1375
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,636
In the wrong hands,
the information on those chips

1376
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,638
could be used to undermine the entire
U.S. missile defense system.

1377
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,871
For the last three months, Dan's been
smuggling them out of the building.

1378
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,955
Prison-style.

1379
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,917
Wait. Prison-style? What do you mean?

1380
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,992
I think that means he put 'em in
a balloon and stuck 'em up his butt.

1381
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,354
What?

1382
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,712
Oh, God!

1383
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,073
Why did you do this, Dan?

1384
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:10,472
That's exactly what
we're about to find out, Jeff.

1385
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,435
Yeah.

1386
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,039
Tim!

1387
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:19,076
Spread your legs, Danny boy.

1388
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,638
Mrs. Jones has some work to do.

1389
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,233
Natalie...

1390
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:25,880
Jesus. Jeff.
Jeff, please, do something!

1391
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,029
Either you talk...

1392
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:28,576
Jeff, stop her please!
She's a psychopath!

1393
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:32,070
Tim, can I just have a word with
you guys for one second, please?

1394
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,037
Please don't hurt me. Please.

1395
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,936
- Okay, okay.
- Get this psycho away from me, Jeff.

1396
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,109
Relax.

1397
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,794
We're excited that
you guys are still alive.

1398
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,714
But this is our basement. This is not
a Abu Ghraib, you know, scenario here.

1399
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,950
- Our kids play down here.
- I don't like it either.

1400
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,996
But this is
a national security situation.

1401
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:50,958
Yeah, but you can't torch a man's
scrotum and expect him to speak.

1402
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,109
You'd be surprised.

1403
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:56,034
These are human beings.
You gotta connect with them, okay?

1404
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:58,520
- Let me talk to 'em for two minutes.
- He's a people person.

1405
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:00,269
You have 90 seconds.

1406
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:02,789
Okey-dokey.

1407
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,239
Okay, Meg.

1408
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,518
Dan, I want you to know...

1409
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:24,470
like the HR department, this basement
is a place of non-judgment, okay?

1410
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,111
And even though
you stole from the company

1411
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,760
and betrayed your country
and cul-de-sac,

1412
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:33,674
and, you know, placed microchips
in your darkest cavity,

1413
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:34,875
mistakes happen!

1414
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,430
Oh, my God! Can we please waterboard
them and get this over with?

1415
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,473
We live in confusing times.

1416
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,075
And I think that the lines between
right and wrong become blurry.

1417
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,993
It's hard to even know what those
words mean, isn't it, Dan?

1418
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,071
What is this? Good cop, good cop?

1419
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:51,754
Look, I might not know
what's going on, on the sixth floor,

1420
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,958
but did you know that every time
an employee requests a raise

1421
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,473
it comes through the HR department?

1422
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:58,999
And I've seen your requests.

1423
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:03,278
And I know that they've been denied,
every time, for the last five years.

1424
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,790
That's a lot of time, Dan. Lot of good
time you gave to the company, huh?

1425
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:10,633
- Where's your piece of the pie?
- Exactly.

1426
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,416
You know how hard it is
to raise four children

1427
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,656
on a rocket scientist's salary?

1428
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,511
Oh, God! Shut up, you idiot!

1429
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:17,636
No! You shut up, Lady Macbeth!

1430
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,948
Okay.

1431
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,816
You're the one who pushed me
into this, you know that?

1432
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,718
With all your constant demands
and trendy needs.

1433
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:25,711
I did not tell you
to go on Jeff's computer

1434
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,472
and make a deal with an arms dealer!

1435
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,278
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

1436
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:32,269
Jeff...

1437
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,871
I was at the end of my rope.

1438
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:39,314
The financial pressure was crazy.
Groceries and tutors and...

1439
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,517
I got four kids under 13 in braces.

1440
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,079
Do you understand? Do you, Jeff?

1441
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,675
I do. You know I do. I mean...

1442
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,113
if kids have crooked teeth,

1443
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,616
we can't have crooked teeth
in this society.

1444
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,234
This isn't Great Britain, you know?

1445
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:57,392
There's all sorts of things
you have to keep up with and...

1446
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,869
New tires for the minivan,
piano lessons,

1447
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,791
you know, and, because all that...

1448
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,072
Carl Pronger is dead!

1449
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,879
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hang on! Get a hold of yourself!

1450
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,599
I never wanted anyone
to get hurt, Jeff, I swear.

1451
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,238
We were protecting you.

1452
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,709
The Scorpion doesn't even
know who you are. Karen!

1453
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,376
Shut up, Meg! Brooklyn Loft is stupid.

1454
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:19,435
All right, not helping.

1455
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:20,589
I'm crying.

1456
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,795
Where did you get an onion?

1457
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,279
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.

1458
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,715
I got it from upstairs.
From our kitchen.

1459
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,915
Is this your phone?
Is this the Scorpion calling?

1460
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,456
I'm gonna answer this
and you're gonna talk to him.

1461
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,879
And you're gonna lead us to him.

1462
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,496
He'll sniff me out in a second.
You know what he's capable of.

1463
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,750
- Answer the phone now.
- Natalie...

1464
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:42,955
No more games.

1465
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:46,516
Look, I can't. I'm not a spy!
I'm a soccer dad!

1466
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,999
He never misses a game.

1467
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,877
Oh, my God. All right,
I'm gonna answer it.

1468
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,736
No, we can't.
Our cover was blown, remember?

1469
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,176
Well, I don't have
a lot of options.

1470
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:54,474
What do you want me to do?

1471
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,069
Hello?

1472
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,230
Hello? Mr. Rascal Flatts?

1473
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,397
I needed a cover name.

1474
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,195
Hello?

1475
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:09,474
Hi!

1476
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,597
Um... Yes, this is Rascal.

1477
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,955
Are you and your wife
ready to make the deal?

1478
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:21,600
Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I
are very excited about it.

1479
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,911
Tomorrow night.
The Odyssey Hotel. 9:00 p. m.

1480
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:29,355
Go to the V-Bar.
A table will be reserved for you.

1481
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:31,874
Bring the requested item and wait.

1482
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,793
V-Bar. Okay thank you very much.

1483
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,394
J ust out of curiosity,
is there a dress code?

1484
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,710
I'll... I can look that up online.

1485
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,832
Okay.

1486
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:46,920
What have I done?

1487
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,276
No, no. You did everything great!
You did everything great.

1488
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,429
- Okay.
- You did!

1489
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,670
- I did.
- Jeff and Karen, welcome to

1490
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,478
the sexy and exciting world

1491
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,154
of international espionage
and covert operations.

1492
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,070
Buddy, I think it's time
we get you in a proper suit.

1493
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,151
Nice! Is it an extra medium?

1494
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,912
A killer dress.

1495
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:09,720
That's all of it?

1496
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,473
This tie has been fitted
with a miniature surveillance mic.

1497
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,710
It's completely undetectable.

1498
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,115
I don't know if I can walk in these.

1499
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,997
The heel is equipped
with a tracking device

1500
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,469
that allows us to monitor
your every move.

1501
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,597
Natalie and I will secure
a position right upstairs on the roof.

1502
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,750
And establish a command center.

1503
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:29,638
Now, you know at some point,
you're gonna have to put on pants.

1504
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:31,836
Yeah. I know. I'm just nervous still.

1505
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:33,148
It's gonna be okay.

1506
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,639
Simple in and out job.

1507
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,836
Make the exchange, leave the hotel.

1508
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,356
Got it. In and out.
Just out of curiosity,

1509
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,159
what happens, you know,
worst-case scenario?

1510
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,632
Worst-case scenario?

1511
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,790
We radio for backup,
and we storm the place

1512
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:50,030
with the full force
of the United States government.

1513
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,999
Okay. Got it.

1514
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:53,479
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1515
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:56,518
You look good.
Don't forget those pants.

1516
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,639
Reminds me of our first date.

1517
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:27,029
And our second.

1518
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:30,994
What's wrong?

1519
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,072
We never really did finish
that conversation, did we?

1520
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:38,674
Well, the house did explode.

1521
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,034
So...

1522
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:45,119
Look, I just want you to know
I realized something last night

1523
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,350
when I was about to fry
Dan's testicles.

1524
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,232
I know I'm not the best listener,

1525
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,912
but I can change.

1526
01:17:52,840 --> 01:17:54,592
What? You don't think I can?

1527
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,069
No, no, no. I know you can.

1528
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,832
Just don't change too much, okay?

1529
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,235
Okay.

1530
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:23,075
Honey, are you ready?
What are you doing?

1531
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,549
I was just listening
to some Rascal Flatts.

1532
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,471
- Trying to get into character.
- Oh, God!

1533
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,755
Patrick leaves these toys
on the stairs.

1534
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,877
- Somebody's gonna hurt themselves.
- Karen!

1535
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,758
What? Do you like it? Is it too much?

1536
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,990
No! Not at all. It's just enough.

1537
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,080
Thanks, honey.

1538
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,976
Is this the lingerie
you were wearing the other day?

1539
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,136
Yeah, I figured if we're gonna
do this, I should do it right.

1540
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,116
Yeah.

1541
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,397
- You look so handsome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1542
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,976
How much time until
we have to be at the hotel?

1543
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,911
We've got 45 minutes.

1544
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:07,393
- Karen. Karen.
- Jeff,

1545
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,232
your tie's stuck.

1546
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:10,440
- Karen!
- Ooh! Sorry, honey.

1547
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,669
What?

1548
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:21,275
I think they're having sex.

1549
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,032
Goddamn it,
we don't have time for this.

1550
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,554
I mean, they're supposed to be
here in 45 minutes.

1551
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,475
Nope, they are done.

1552
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:34,949
All right.

1553
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,790
Oh, wow! Look, honey.
Beautiful design!

1554
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,438
- Hey, Karen.
- Yeah?

1555
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,513
Thanks so much for the sex.

1556
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:10,600
Oh...

1557
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,789
Go.

1558
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:19,594
Hello!

1559
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,149
- Hi.
- Hi. We have a reservation for two

1560
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:25,595
under the name Rascal Flatts.

1561
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,795
It's not our real name.

1562
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,030
We're having an affair.

1563
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,155
Come with me.

1564
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,318
Hey, Tim. We're in the restaurant
right now. Everything's going okay.

1565
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,075
Honey, sushi.

1566
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:41,118
There's sushi as well.
I'm gonna sign off for right now.

1567
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,114
Ciao.

1568
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,590
- Oh, that's our table.
- No, this way.

1569
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,989
Really?

1570
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,033
Thank you so much.

1571
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,518
Is this the line to
the little boys' room?

1572
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,477
- I don't need to use it.
- Come.

1573
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,872
I'm confused. I...

1574
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,918
It's part of the...
I thought it was just gonna be us.

1575
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,638
You fellas with The Scorpion?

1576
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,998
All right, they're on the move.

1577
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,353
Moving into position.

1578
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,749
Thank you.

1579
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:45,237
There he is. Rascal Flatts.

1580
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:46,878
You have any trouble
finding the place?

1581
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:48,160
No. Your henchmen were very...

1582
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,696
I'm a little
ticklish there.

1583
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,039
Your henchmen were very helpful.

1584
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,396
This must be the wife. Wow! You guys
really dressed up for tonight.

1585
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,914
Thank you. Yeah.
Well, we don't get out very often.

1586
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,116
When we do, we really
like to make the most of it.

1587
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:01,430
Awesome. Ivan?

1588
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:03,039
All clear.

1589
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:06,112
Sorry about the frisking. You cannot
be too careful in my line of work.

1590
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:07,599
Let me make it up to you

1591
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,717
with some very expensive,
very delicious champagne.

1592
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,798
Wow! Look at that gun.

1593
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:14,949
And by the way,

1594
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,316
you two have gotta try this dip.
It's amazing.

1595
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,936
It's a cheat day for me, so I went
a little crazy with room service.

1596
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:22,280
I hope you don't mind.

1597
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,788
Mrs. Flatts makes a great
seven-layer dip. I'll tell you that.

1598
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,154
I bet she does.

1599
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,358
I do. The secret is an extra layer.
An eight-layer dip.

1600
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,510
Sneaky! I love that.

1601
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,878
Do I know you from somewhere?

1602
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:40,673
I seriously doubt it.

1603
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:42,868
He's a people person.

1604
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,157
Come on, Jeff. Stay calm.
Just do what we talked about.

1605
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,196
Well, did the people person
bring this person his computer chips?

1606
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,394
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.
You'll find them right here.

1607
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,879
Careful.

1608
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:12,388
Denver, 2010.

1609
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:15,317
Were you at the National
Aerospace Convention?

1610
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,789
Because I think we were
in the same focus group.

1611
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,869
Are we still doing this?

1612
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:22,235
No, we're n... it's done.
It's really done. It's so done.

1613
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,912
Why does he keep
asking those questions?

1614
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,798
I don't think he can help it.
It's just what he does.

1615
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:29,394
He connects with people.

1616
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,550
- Perfect, as promised.
- Shit.

1617
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,959
Ivan?

1618
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,433
Wow. Okay. Here we go. Thank you.

1619
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,556
- Okay! We got it. Great.
- Yeah. That checks out.

1620
01:23:41,640 --> 01:23:43,949
Well, pleasure doing business
with both of you.

1621
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,116
Thank you, Mr. Scorpion and friends.

1622
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:48,873
Thank you. Yeah.
Okay. Grab that stuff.

1623
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,831
Hey! You drop your little ball.

1624
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,616
That's fine. We have...
I have plenty of those.

1625
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,517
Keep it. Keep it. It's a...

1626
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,272
- Excuse me.
- Stop!

1627
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:07,359
You're the HR guy.

1628
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,908
No, he's not. He's an engineer.
He... Dr. Flatts.

1629
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,856
- Yeah, I'm in the rocket sciences.
- He went to college!

1630
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:14,633
- He's very smart. MIT.
- No.

1631
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,517
No. You were right.

1632
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,238
We have met before.

1633
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:23,872
See from '02 to '05,
I was a mid-level drone at MBI.

1634
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:27,191
- And you are Jeff Gaffney.
- No.

1635
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,838
- Human Resources.
- Wrong.

1636
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,071
Yeah. You helped me
with my "suicidal depression."

1637
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,674
With your little trust exercises
and stress balls!

1638
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,518
This entire thing is a setup!

1639
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,113
Goddamn it, Jeff!

1640
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,355
Decoys have been made.
I repeat, decoys have been made.

1641
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,793
We need to extract. Do you copy?

1642
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,599
Carlos, take a team out,
lock the hallway down.

1643
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:49,069
Yuri, take four guys up
the stairwell to the roof.

1644
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,674
Radio the helicopter, we are getting
the hell out of here.

1645
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,638
We need backup to extract
the decoys. Do you copy?

1646
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:56,836
Negative. Collateral damage.

1647
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:59,832
We cannot engage in a public arena.
Pull back and abort.

1648
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,239
Do you copy?

1649
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,709
Jones, do you copy?

1650
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:06,875
Boris, get some ice tongs
and a cigarette lighter.

1651
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,753
Goddamn it, Jones. Do you copy?

1652
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:15,236
Copy, copy. Pulling out.
I repeat, pulling out.

1653
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,151
We'll meet you
at the extraction point.

1654
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:22,870
You really wanna
just leave them in there?

1655
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,279
Of course not.

1656
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,317
They're our neighbors.

1657
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,951
Sweetie, everything's fine, okay?

1658
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,296
That's why I rent the extra henchmen,
for situations like this.

1659
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,038
- Is it Peter? No.
- That's why I paid

1660
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,776
- for the whole floor.
- Honey, what are you doing?

1661
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,776
- I'm trying to figure out his name.
- Chopper to the jet.

1662
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,016
We'll be in Jakarta by morning,

1663
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,520
- and when we get there, I...
- Bruce.

1664
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,628
You talking to me?

1665
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,510
I remember your name.
Your name is Bruce.

1666
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,469
Bruce Springstine.

1667
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,711
I... No, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

1668
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:54,189
Nah, I'm the one that mediated
your parking space dispute.

1669
01:25:54,280 --> 01:25:57,272
Is that what caused you
to go into a life of crime?

1670
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,954
A bruised ego
over a lousy parking space?

1671
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,508
Jesus Christ! What is this?
Amateur night?

1672
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:03,749
Wait a second.

1673
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,559
Your name is Bruce Springstine?

1674
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:09,240
Yes, Ivan, it is.
It's Bruce Springstine

1675
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,320
and it's a perfectly good name
like any other name.

1676
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,153
And you wanted us
to call you The Boss?

1677
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,754
I didn't want you guys
to call me "The Boss."

1678
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,558
I wanted you to call me, "Boss."

1679
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:22,076
All right? And that's just
for simplicity's sake. Okay?

1680
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,354
That's just sad.

1681
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:26,273
And that parking space thing
was bullshit, all right?

1682
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,272
I'd been there for three years!
They still had me in Lot D!

1683
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,033
That's the other side
of the highway, okay?

1684
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,348
I had to cross the...

1685
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,856
- The footbridge thing. Yeah!
- The little... The footbridge!

1686
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,313
A footbridge, every day,

1687
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,469
rain or shine!

1688
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,913
So, thank you.

1689
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,640
- I am really going to enjoy this.
- Okay.

1690
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,120
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- No!

1691
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,109
Good. SEAL team's here.

1692
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,918
Go, go, go! Get down,
get down, get down!

1693
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,232
Go, boys! Go, go, go!
Shock and awe! Shock and awe!

1694
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,795
Honey, I can't hear anything.

1695
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,856
They're silent killers.
That's how they got Bin Laden.

1696
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:00,950
- Let's just stay down, okay?
- Okay.

1697
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:02,720
Ahem!

1698
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:13,548
Where's the backup?
Those guys are with him.

1699
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,198
There's no backup, Jeff.

1700
01:27:15,280 --> 01:27:16,998
They pulled out
when you blew your cover.

1701
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,992
What do you mean there's no backup?

1702
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,640
You're what they call
"collateral damage."

1703
01:27:22,720 --> 01:27:24,312
That's not good. I saw it on Homeland!

1704
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,000
What do you me... You didn't say
anything about collateral damage!

1705
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,056
I asked you about the worst-case
scenario and you said,

1706
01:27:29,080 --> 01:27:31,071
"Well, the worst-case scenario,
I'll have backup."

1707
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,789
Well, this is worse! This is worse
than the worst-case scenario.

1708
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,199
You lied to our faces.

1709
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:40,671
I did not lie to you. Now, I may
have left out a few key details...

1710
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:42,034
That's a lie, Timothy!

1711
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:44,156
That is lying by omission.
That's textbook...

1712
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,676
You know what? My whole job is lying.
Okay? That's why I fucking hate it!

1713
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:52,156
- I'm sorry, Jeff.
- You're apologizing to him?

1714
01:27:52,240 --> 01:27:54,435
You can't possibly care
about this loser.

1715
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:57,398
You know what? I actually
do care about this loser.

1716
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:00,915
I mean, you and I live
in a world where everybody lies.

1717
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,878
And everybody hides everything
and obfuscates.

1718
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,190
But, not... Not Jeff Gaffney.

1719
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,557
Jeff doesn't live in that world.
He's an honest person.

1720
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:13,672
He's forthright, he's friendly.
He's a good neighbor.

1721
01:28:14,680 --> 01:28:18,389
Do you have any idea how much
courage that takes? Real courage?

1722
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,480
For my money, he's the bravest guy
in this room.

1723
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:24,715
- Oh, please. Spare me the morality!
- Hey!

1724
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,870
Just hear me out, all right?

1725
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,356
Look, the Gaffneys,
they don't belong in our world.

1726
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,317
We don't. We really don't.

1727
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:33,789
Okay? They're too good for that.

1728
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:35,996
Why don't we let them go
back to their world?

1729
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,117
And then you and I, we,

1730
01:28:38,200 --> 01:28:39,713
can settle this here?

1731
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,438
Here in our world.

1732
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,432
You guys can go murder each other
and stuff. Just leave us out of this.

1733
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,696
You know what? I'm just gonna take
care of everything myself. Bruno,

1734
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,056
lay the plastic sheeting out. I don't
wanna lose the security deposit.

1735
01:28:49,080 --> 01:28:51,799
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Can I finish a thought today?

1736
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,474
I'm so sorry, Mr. Scorpion.

1737
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,676
But, Natalie,

1738
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,910
ever since we tried on
underwear together...

1739
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,752
- I'm sorry. You talking to her?
- Mmm-hmm.

1740
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:01,955
Finish your thought.

1741
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,471
I realized something.

1742
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:07,359
I've been living a lie, also.

1743
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:13,034
Karen!

1744
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,080
What is happening to my life?

1745
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:30,351
Oh, my God! How long
have you been living that lie?

1746
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:31,440
Honey! What? No!

1747
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,816
I didn't mean it. I just had to
get the knife to her somehow!

1748
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,152
Okay! I get it now. God! Thank God!
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

1749
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:52,875
It's raining men!

1750
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:58,914
You guys okay?

1751
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,798
Grab the chips and follow us.
Come on, let's go.

1752
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,760
- Chopper's ready.
- Yeah, get 'em.

1753
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,955
And get the chips!

1754
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,798
Get back, get back, get back!

1755
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,230
- I'm almost out.
- Me too.

1756
01:30:25,080 --> 01:30:26,308
What are we gonna do?

1757
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:31,439
- We'll have to jump for it.
- Jump? Jump from where?

1758
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,795
Down there.

1759
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:34,320
There's a pool down below.

1760
01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:36,798
It's our only chance.

1761
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:38,376
Did you think
any of this through?

1762
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,719
Okay.

1763
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,840
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

1764
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:49,948
Jeff? Jeff!

1765
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,552
Jeff. Jeff are you okay?

1766
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:53,959
- I just farted.
- Buddy!

1767
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:55,536
You can't jump through
the window like that.

1768
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,755
That's triple pane glass!
You gotta break it first.

1769
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:59,512
Appreciate the effort though.

1770
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:01,600
Scoot back, everybody, all right?
Just scoot back.

1771
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:04,634
Get out of the way.

1772
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:09,755
Really?

1773
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,989
Stand back!

1774
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,354
What?

1775
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,400
Where'd you get that?

1776
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,993
I picked it up off a dead guy.

1777
01:31:20,120 --> 01:31:21,216
- I thought he didn't need it.
- Run! Out of the window!

1778
01:31:21,240 --> 01:31:22,456
All right. Come on.
We're doing this. Let's go!

1779
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,357
- Now! Now!
- Jump! Jump! Jump!

1780
01:31:27,080 --> 01:31:28,274
Whoa!

1781
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,678
It's okay, everybody. It's okay.

1782
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:34,915
Where's Jeff?

1783
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Guys, where's Jeff?

1784
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,389
Jeff! Jeff, you've gotta...

1785
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,152
- Jeff, you've gotta jump!
- Jeff!

1786
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:44,468
Give me a second.

1787
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,840
- Jeff, jump! Please!
- Just run and jump!

1788
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:49,480
Oh...

1789
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:51,630
This is perfect.

1790
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,994
You've been a pain
in my ass all day, Jeff.

1791
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:58,072
Okay, li... Bru... Mr. Scorpion,

1792
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:00,236
we all make choices in life and I...

1793
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,470
I'm not being judgmental,
I promise you,

1794
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,711
but do you really think that violence
is the solution? There's this exer...

1795
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:10,318
He's all yours, gravity.

1796
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,478
And that's why you don't sting the...

1797
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:33,673
Always have plan B.

1798
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,911
I know it seemed a lot higher.

1799
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,296
Thank you very much.
That's for you. Keep it all.

1800
01:32:58,320 --> 01:32:59,936
Maybe you could videotape
that and put it online.

1801
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:01,678
Where did you get the gun from?

1802
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:03,736
No. I don't think we're
gonna keep any of that online.

1803
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,920
That would get a lot of hits.

1804
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,319
And I lined it up, and smashed.

1805
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,913
Because there's shooting...

1806
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,376
Probably wanna keep it
a little on the down low.

1807
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:11,755
Yes. Of course.
Yeah, no, no, of course. Yes. Yes.

1808
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:12,909
I'm just saying.

1809
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,592
I'm so proud of you guys.

1810
01:33:14,680 --> 01:33:16,557
- You guys wanna come inside?
- Yeah, come in.

1811
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:17,720
Where are you guys staying?

1812
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:20,598
- You could stay with us!
- Stay with us!

1813
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,910
Why wouldn't you stay with us?
We have a pull-out couch.

1814
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,958
You can borrow some of my boxer briefs
if you need anything to lounge in.

1815
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,856
- I've got a Wii.
- We've got a flat screen TV!

1816
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:29,438
We have free Wi-Fi.

1817
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,193
- You guys are great! Really.
- It's very nice of you to offer.

1818
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,349
But...

1819
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,668
Our ride is coming.

1820
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:37,752
Yeah. Yeah.
You got your things you have to do.

1821
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,199
Your missions.

1822
01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:48,474
Is that an Uber?

1823
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,874
Sort of.

1824
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,155
Hug?

1825
01:33:53,240 --> 01:33:55,310
- Just a hug?
- Just a hug.

1826
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,751
Thank you. You're an amazing woman.

1827
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:00,954
Thank you.

1828
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,040
You made an incredible life
for yourself here, Jeff.

1829
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:08,308
Just remember to leave the cul-de-sac,
every now and again.

1830
01:34:08,920 --> 01:34:11,309
You'd be surprised
at what you find out there.

1831
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:14,675
We'll remember.

1832
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:17,312
- Time to go.
- Yes.

1833
01:34:21,640 --> 01:34:23,437
Where's the driver?

1834
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:25,873
Right here.

1835
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,437
There's no driver in the car.

1836
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:30,296
If they're shooting at us,
I get to drive.

1837
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,912
Now you wanna drive.

1838
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,115
I see how it works.

1839
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:35,873
You get to drive the good car.

1840
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,679
Bye, you guys!

1841
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,235
Okay.

1842
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,430
You know, it's Parents Day
at the camp tomorrow.

1843
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,472
This is going straight
to Facebook. Keep sucking!

1844
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:30,518
- That's good.
- What does it taste like?

1845
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:32,757
It tastes like Mikey's sock.

1846
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,717
But I mean that in a good way.
Here, try it.

1847
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,189
Oh, I miss Mikey's little feet
and his socks.

1848
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:38,599
Yeah. Here.

1849
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:41,075
Okay, ready?

1850
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,515
Oh, God! That really hurt.

1851
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,474
What?

1852
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,279
Oh, my God!

1853
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:52,430
- Guys!
- Natalie! Tim!

1854
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,192
You've gotta be kidding me!

1855
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,840
What?

1856
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,956
- Can I take this?
- Are you kidding me?

1857
01:35:58,040 --> 01:35:59,598
We are here because of you.

1858
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:00,800
You told us about this place

1859
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:02,233
and that's why we came!

1860
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,112
You are here. In Marrakesh.

1861
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,758
- That's a good memory. Wow.
- Amazing!

1862
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,955
- What?
- That's amazing.

1863
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,678
- My God.
- You have a baby!

1864
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:10,955
- Yes, he just fell asleep.
- He just fell asleep.

1865
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:13,190
You had a baby? You old dogs!

1866
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,635
Does that mean
you guys left the agency?

1867
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:17,438
- Well, yeah. It's a very...
- Well...

1868
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:18,748
- Yeah?
- Long story.

1869
01:36:18,840 --> 01:36:21,070
But we can't really
get into it right now.

1870
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:24,232
But, it's good to see you!

1871
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:26,515
Jeff, do me a big favor?
Will you just...

1872
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:28,296
- scoot a little bit to your right?
- Yeah. Sure thing.

1873
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:29,548
Thank you!

1874
01:36:29,640 --> 01:36:31,312
I am blown away, you guys.
This is un...

1875
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:33,834
Jeff, I don't want you
to turn around right now,

1876
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:37,356
but there are four guys in fezzes
behind you on the...

1877
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,776
Jeff, I just said don't turn around.

1878
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,456
Jeff, I just specifically
asked you not to turn around.

1879
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,216
I know but you said there are four
guys in fezzes behind me.

1880
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,536
We're in Morocco.
There's a lot of fezzes.

1881
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:45,056
But it's human nature,
I think, to turn around

1882
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,672
to something like that.
Don't you think?

1883
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:48,193
Honey. We blew their cover again.

1884
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,311
- No! No.
- What?

1885
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,256
- We should feed the baby?
- I think we should feed the baby.

1886
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,776
- If you can just pass me the bottle...
- We blew their cover?

1887
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,176
- ...that would be great.
- Darn it.

1888
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,216
- Can you hold this bag for me?
- Do you mind holding the baby?

1889
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,993
Before you freak out,
it's just a baby.

1890
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:02,056
- All right? Don't worry.
- Kids are great! I have pictures.

1891
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,136
- Karen, how do you get...
- I'll tell you what.

1892
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,718
Just put it in here and show me.

1893
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,199
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.

1894
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:07,793
Okay. I see now.

1895
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:09,479
Okay? See what that is?

1896
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,391
- It's okay, honey.
- I need you to breathe.

1897
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:13,096
- You can do it.
- You've done this before.

1898
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:16,669
On three, I want you to get down,
and take cover. Okay?

1899
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:17,829
One...

1900
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:18,920
Two...

1901
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,036
Jesus, Jeff!
Everybody down, right now.

1902
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,748
- I miss those guys.
- Me too.
