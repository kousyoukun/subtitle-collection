1
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,854
<i>I work in Human Resources
or "HR," as some people call it.</i>

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,357
<i>And I have this poster
in my office that says,</i>

3
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,942
<i>"Keep calm and go to your safe place."</i>

4
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:12,197
<i>Well, when I get a little stressed out
or my anxiety spikes,</i>

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,991
<i>I close my eyes
and picture my cul-de-sac,</i>

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,162
<i>and my wonderful wife, Karen,
and our two sons, Patrick and Mikey.</i>

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,999
<i>Because that's the place where I know
everything is always okay.</i>

8
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,460
<i>No matter what.</i>

9
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>-Bye, Mikey, Patrick. Bye, you guys.
-Bye, guys.</i>

10
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,055
You can text us
the minute you get to camp.

11
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,223
Yeah, okay.

12
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,100
And if you get any ticks,
put it in the plastic baggie

13
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,311
with the date and time of the bite,
and I'll get them tested.

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,855
Change your socks. Okay, guys?
Change your socks.

15
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,357
We love you. We love you.
We're gonna miss you.

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,983
-Love you guys!
-Have so much fun!

17
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,026
Be strong!

18
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,070
Be strong.

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,120
Did that bus driver
look sober to you, honey?

20
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,831
Because he gave me a really weird look
when I smelled his breath.

21
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,708
Well, I think you just startled him.

22
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,668
Look, there's Meg.

23
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,752
Hey, Meg.

24
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,754
I sold it.

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,757
-That was so fast.
-Thank you.

26
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,092
All cash buyers.

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,593
All cash buyers? That's fancy.

28
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,471
Yeah. And the best part is,
they didn't even see it.

29
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,181
They just saw the pictures online.

30
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,517
I haven't even met them
in person. It's crazy.

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,311
Who buys a house
without seeing it first?

32
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:27,647
I know. Maybe it's a celebrity,
you know?

33
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,191
Come on, Jeff.
No celebrity is gonna move here.

34
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,861
I hope it's not some kind of
meth lab situation.

35
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,113
There he is.

36
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,240
-Sorry.
-Where have you been?

37
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:40,035
Kinko's was bananas.

38
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,327
It often is.

39
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,748
So exciting. New neighbors, right?

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,292
And, Karen,
I left your card in the foyer,

41
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,544
-just in case they want a decorator.
-Thank you.

42
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,838
So did you tell

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,632
Jeff about my new idea
for the guest bathroom?

44
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,469
No.

45
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,220
Artist's loft.

46
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,097
Think Brooklyn, okay?

47
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,975
Exposed brick,
visible plumbing. And...

48
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,518
A urinal.

49
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,062
A urinal!

50
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:10,106
That's really for me.
Meg wants me standing up again.

51
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,403
Well, I suppose I'd better get started
on the urinal.

52
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:20,700
Yeah, no. I know
what you're getting started on.

53
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,827
Empty house, kids are gone.

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,497
Please.

55
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:28,375
-Honeymoon.
-All right, keep it PG, guys.

56
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:31,294
Well, we gotta go
flyer the subdivision anyway.

57
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,089
-We're gonna pound the pavement.
-Yeah.

58
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,092
-Jeff, you should try it hyena style.
-We'll try it.

59
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,388
That's the noise I make.

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,766
I think Meg has changed up
her medication, honey.

61
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,476
What's Dan's excuse then?

62
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,853
Some of that stuff
they were saying was demented.

63
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,355
-Disgusting.
-Yeah.

64
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,444
But maybe they have a point.
I don't know.

65
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,905
Alone in the house.

66
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,741
First time in a long time.

67
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,327
Yeah, I mean,
we can do whatever we want.

68
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,709
<i>I DVR-ed the Good Wife.</i>

69
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,252
Great. I'll make popcorn.

70
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,384
-Back it up.
-You got it.

71
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,553
-How much room we got?
-Almost there.

72
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,888
Hey, Bernie.

73
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,015
New neighbors aren't wasting
any time moving in, are they?

74
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,475
Nope.

75
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,561
You're gonna clean that up,
right, Berno?

76
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,687
Always do.

77
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,564
Okay, have a good one.

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,401
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

79
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,986
Come on, fellas. Let's go. Come on.

80
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,497
Hi, Jack. Good morning.

81
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,791
Don't let anybody say that to you
on a plane. "Hijack."

82
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,334
Good morning, anyway.

83
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,377
Morning.

84
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,546
Hi, Diane.

85
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,009
Jeff, good morning.

86
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,678
See those moving vans?

87
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,513
Couldn't miss them.

88
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,806
-Gosh!
-So,

89
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,933
-any word on the new neighbors?
-No.

90
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,142
-Anything?
-Nothing.

91
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,852
Guarantee they're no Dave and Bridget.

92
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,979
Well, at least the summer's
not a total loss.

93
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,023
I mean, we got Junetoberfest
to look forward to.

94
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,608
-Yes, we do.
-And our jobs.

95
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,943
Always have our jobs.

96
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:01,486
By the way, how's it going upstairs?

97
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,699
Jesus, Jeff. You know I can't
talk about what we do upstairs.

98
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,200
Yeah. I know. It's all right.

99
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,743
Hey, by the way,

100
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,080
I still have those indoor skydiving
lessons if you wanna join me.

101
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,373
My treat.

102
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,835
This week's really hectic.
Kid stuff. But, maybe.

103
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,503
Just text me. Or I'll text you.

104
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,672
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Have a good one.

105
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,840
-All right.
-Hey, Sheila. Good morning.

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,801
Morning, Louise.

107
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,636
Morning, Sharon.

108
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,555
Hi, Jeff. Dr. Fisher called.

109
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,681
Yeah? What did he say?

110
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,518
He said, "Please tell Jeff to stop
texting me about indoor skydiving."

111
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,646
He's joking. He's a riot. Hey, Doug.

112
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,323
Hey, Sanjay.

113
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,076
Hey, Jeff. Can I use your computer?

114
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,870
I need to reorder my anti-depressants.

115
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,164
<i>Of course. Mi computer, su computer.</i>

116
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,249
Where are you? WhoВґs that?

117
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,625
This is Jeff.

118
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,130
Jeff lets me use his computer because
security prohibits Internet upstairs.

119
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,717
And why does Jeff have Internet?

120
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,386
Because Jeff does unimportant work.

121
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,930
Human Resources.

122
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,558
Are we getting written up?
'Cause I emailed him last night

123
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,394
and apologized.
He said he was fine. And we have

124
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,688
-put this behind us.
-It's all fine.

125
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,359
I wouldn't be doing my job if we
didn't go over a couple of exercises.

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,694
So, grab a stress ball.

127
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,571
Really?

128
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,740
Okay, so, Margaret's gonna show us...

129
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,409
the meaning of trust.

130
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,371
-Hey, Sanjay?
-Yeah?

131
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,415
Did I tell you that I ate at
a Indian restaurant the other night?

132
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,960
Yeah, I had to call
and make an Indian reservation.

133
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,506
Yang, tell Oren how he makes you feel.

134
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,845
Maybe you should just write us up.
That might be easier.

135
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,015
I once knew an Indian who drank
so much tea, he died in his "tea-pee."

136
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,559
That was a good one.

137
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,228
Okay, Margaret. Go ahead.

138
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,738
Wow.

139
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,782
Yes, I do feel like you are jealous.

140
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,409
I can sense the resentment

141
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,495
every time I bring up
gravitational perturbations.

142
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,456
Is that bad? That sounds bad.
What is that? Is that like--

143
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,292
Gravitational perturbations?
That's a laugh!

144
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,960
Plus, what about my work?

145
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,296
I mentioned velocity vectors
one time...

146
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,839
New neighbors!

147
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,923
One time,

148
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,134
and you try to get me
bumped down to Dhameer's team?

149
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,219
You were supposed to calculate...

150
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,851
This is all because
I hooked up with Sharada.

151
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,978
You what?
You hooked up with Sharada Ganjali?

152
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,646
I'll kill you!

153
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,444
Oren, this is no way
to settle a workplace dispute!

154
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,904
Sharon, call security!

155
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,161
Hiya, Jeff!

156
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,375
-Karen.
-Hey, honey!

157
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,752
Hey, darling.

158
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,380
Still spying on the neighbors?

159
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,757
Hi, there.

160
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,176
Hello.

161
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:55,929
You must be Jeff.

162
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,014
I'm Tim. This is my wife, Natalie.

163
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,142
We're the Joneses!
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

164
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:03,436
Nice to meet you guys.
That was a joke about spying--

165
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,939
It's a joke. I'd never spy on anyone.

166
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,357
We love humor.

167
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,401
Humor...

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,531
So, Natalie was just telling me that
she's a social media consultant.

169
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,491
Yeah. I also write a cooking blog.

170
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,951
I love blogs.

171
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,787
Yeah, and I work with a charity
for Sri Lankan orphans.

172
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,623
Those are my biggest passions.

173
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,874
Natalie's got a big heart.

174
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,501
Aw, thank you, baby.

175
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,629
Yeah...

176
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,881
-Why don't you tell them about--
-What?

177
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,426
She has passions too. Why don't you
tell them about the urinal?

178
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,136
No, honey!

179
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,138
-It's nothing.
-No, please. It sounds interesting.

180
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,475
I'm picking up a slight accent.
Is that Pittsburgh, maybe?

181
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,811
-She's from Greece.
-Oh, God.

182
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,229
No, but we've lived all over.

183
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,649
And now, it's finally time
to plant some roots. Right?

184
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,863
I can't tell you how excited we are
to be here on Maple Circle.

185
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,114
Such a lovely street.

186
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,282
It really is.

187
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,742
-Thank you.
-We love it.

188
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,494
It's fascinating. In other cultures,
they don't have anything like this.

189
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,746
No, they don't.

190
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,080
In Chinese, for example.

191
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,665
They don't even have a word
for a street like this.

192
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,833
What? For cul-de-sac?

193
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,960
No. No. I mean, they would say...

194
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,422
Which is, loosely,

195
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,424
-"happy place of heart and mind."
-Right.

196
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,135
But it doesn't really capture
the essence of it, right?

197
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,012
But it's cool coming
out of your mouth.

198
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,098
-Tim's a travel writer.
-Really?

199
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,017
-Wow! We love to travel.
-We do.

200
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,479
Yeah. We went to Epcot Center
last summer, was it? Yeah.

201
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,565
You can go to every country,
like, within three blocks.

202
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,400
Perfect. That's what we like about it.

203
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,610
We went with the boys over there.

204
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,487
That's Patrick and Mikey.
Patrick's leaning

205
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,072
against the wheel.
He's just a real cuddler.

206
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,240
-They're beautiful.
-Adorable.

207
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,242
Mikey made this.

208
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,869
-Wow!
-What a talent!

209
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,872
-Speaking of which, we brought you...
-Yes, yes.

210
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,915
...a little something.

211
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,708
What?

212
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,753
-That's amazing! Really?
-Give me a break!

213
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,837
I made it myself.

214
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,339
You made it yourself?

215
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,968
Wow. Look at this.

216
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,178
-What is this?
-What is that?

217
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,262
A sculpture.

218
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,722
Tim blows his own glass.

219
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,599
Look at it in the light, honey.
It sort of--

220
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,476
-That's gorgeous. Look at that.
-Gorgeous.

221
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,727
-You made that?
-Yeah,

222
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,270
it's a hobby I picked up in Hungary.

223
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,650
I wrote an article about this
Hungarian glass-blowing master, Yorgi.

224
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,569
-Thank you. I don't know what to say.
-You don't need to say anything.

225
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,989
Just put it right there
and use it as a conversation piece.

226
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,991
-That's cool. Thank you very much!
-Thank you.

227
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,993
-Anyway, we should get going.
-Yeah.

228
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,829
-Yeah. We should.
-Okay.

229
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,164
I feel like I should
give you guys a gift.

230
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,499
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

231
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,209
-That's not necessary.
-You want a stress ball?

232
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,627
No, you don't want a stress ball.
That would be stupid.

233
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,712
I'd love a stress ball.

234
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,255
-Thank you.
-Yes! They really work.

235
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,339
Thank you.

236
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,383
-Let me just get this out of your way.
-No, Jeff will get that.

237
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,718
-No, no, no.
-That's nice.

238
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,469
It's all good. We're neighbors now.

239
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,096
All right.

240
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:47,100
Have you guys ever been to
or heard of Junetoberfest?

241
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,978
-Junetoberfest?
-Yeah.

242
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,479
You guys should really come.

243
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,565
It's our annual summer get-together.

244
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,442
The whole neighborhood comes.
A really fun group.

245
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,735
A lot of us work together.

246
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,902
At MBI?

247
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,698
Yeah. We have a dart tournament.
We have bratwurst.

248
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,658
I make my own home brew,
which is my passion.

249
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,743
Good!

250
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,286
How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?

251
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,497
Jeff must've mentioned it.
Right, Jeff?

252
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,499
-No. No, he didn't.
-That's okay, honey--

253
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,584
No, Jeff didn't mention it.

254
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,838
-The stress ball.
-Must've been a lucky guess, I guess.

255
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,424
-No, it's right there.
-Lucky guess. Yeah, we should go.

256
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,052
It's getting late.
Thank you so much for everything.

257
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,887
The coffee was delicious.

258
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,097
-Thank you.
-And we'll see you at Junetoberfest!

259
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,812
So, let me show you a picture.
This is Tyler.

260
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,898
And Tyler's gonna go
to asthma camp this summer.

261
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,067
Oh, my God! He's so handsome!

262
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,324
-Hiya, neighbor.
-Hey.

263
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,868
"Seared yellowtail

264
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,746
with lemon zest and ginger shavings."
Who the hell made this?

265
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,290
Natalie. Apparently,
she can do everything.

266
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,043
I'm sorry, but who wears that
to a barbecue?

267
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,336
I mean, there are kids here.

268
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,296
Come on, Meg.
It's just a summer dress.

269
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,968
It's a very short, very chic,
extremely flattering summer dress.

270
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,679
Yeah, well, it's pornographic.

271
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,307
Look at Dan pretending
to check his email.

272
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:14,521
If I find pictures of her ass
on his phone, BJ night is canceled.

273
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,648
So, anyway, there I am,

274
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,401
alone, in the middle
of the Empty Quarter, all by myself,

275
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,861
with no water, dying of thirst.
I'm literally

276
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,115
writing a goodbye letter to Natalie.

277
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,200
And what do I see
coming up over the horizon?

278
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,744
But the exact same camel...

279
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,955
whose life I saved
three years earlier.

280
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,832
-Exact same one.
-Did he remember you?

281
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,501
No. No, Jeff.
He didn't remember me. He's a camel.

282
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,713
But I was able to ride him
into civilization.

283
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,507
And I filed my story, with 15 minutes
to spare, thank you very much.

284
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,675
Caught the next flight to Marrakesh

285
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,761
and was sitting in a cafГ© with Natalie
smoking hookah later that night.

286
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,389
-No way!
-I wanna smoke a hookah in Marrakesh.

287
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,183
Well, Stacey,
I know it sounds very romantic.

288
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,979
But, trust me, the world can be
a very dark and disturbing place.

289
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:57,522
Tim, you want a beer?

290
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,898
Sure. Yeah. Thank you.

291
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:01,109
-Here you go.
-There it is.

292
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,660
Wow, good job-- Buddy, buddy.
Yeah, buddy. Wow!

293
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,328
-That is a lot of blood.
-It's fine. It's okay.

294
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,538
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

295
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,664
It's just gushing a bit.

296
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,832
-Just hold on to that.
-Yes.

297
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,958
Give me this.

298
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,209
-It's sprung a leak.
-Just...

299
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,337
-I feel a little bit light-headed.
-Close your hand around it.

300
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,755
-If I could just maybe--
-No!

301
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,381
You can't rattle me.

302
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,801
Witness... Witness my destiny.

303
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:31,556
Neighborhood champ,
five years in a row!

304
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,934
Hey! You wanna give it a try?

305
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,019
-Me?
-Yeah!

306
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,979
No,

307
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,522
-I'll only embarrass myself.
-"No" is not an answer.

308
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,648
Come on. It's so easy.

309
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,941
-It's a bad idea.
-Look,

310
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,236
I'll even show you
the famous Craverston grip, okay?

311
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,821
-All right.
-Put that in your hand.

312
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,656
Now hold it like a pencil.

313
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,325
Now cock your wrist.

314
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,993
-Right.
-Good, good. Elbow out.

315
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,578
And then you just kinda throw at it.

316
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,704
Like this?

317
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,248
This is good?

318
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,876
Well, you kinda throw like a girl.

319
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,796
But when a girl is as beautiful as you
she doesn't have to be good.

320
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,426
Do you mind if I skip
the Craverston grip?

321
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,178
Okay, good luck.

322
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,945
Oh, my God! Look at that!

323
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,157
Maybe I should show you
how to throw like a girl.

324
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,166
Suck on that, Craverston.

325
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,543
Shut up, Oren.

326
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,294
Where's your girlfriend?

327
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,396
Tim.

328
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,940
Hey, Karen.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

329
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,359
You were in Jeff's den.

330
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,111
Yeah. I must've made a wrong turn.

331
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,657
Lovely place you have here,
by the way. You have a great eye.

332
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,742
Thank you.

333
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,201
Was that your design work
I saw downstairs?

334
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,996
Jeff had mentioned something
about urinals.

335
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,498
Yes. Well,
the customer's always right.

336
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,584
But, yeah, they are my drawings.

337
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,627
Customer's always right.
Except when they're not.

338
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,298
-The bathroom's that way, Tim.
-No, thank you, I'm fine.

339
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,107
<i>That was one of
the best Junetoberfests</i>

340
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,193
we have ever, ever had.

341
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,446
Have you ever seen a couple
move into a neighborhood

342
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,947
so nicely as the Joneses?

343
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,326
You don't you think there's
something off about them?

344
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,744
I mean, they're so overly

345
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:01,915
accomplished, and stylish
and affectionate with one another.

346
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,417
Why would they wanna live here?

347
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,503
Karen, they told you,
they wanna settle down.

348
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,797
You know that he was
in your den today?

349
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,215
Yeah, so?

350
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,635
So, he can navigate
the bazaars of Marrakesh,

351
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,013
but he gets "lost upstairs"
looking for a bathroom?

352
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,807
Karen, let me tell you something
I learned years ago.

353
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:22,310
When people have to poop,
they get embarrassed.

354
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,354
As do I, sometimes.

355
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,690
Really? You think he had to poop?

356
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,024
Probably, yes.

357
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,028
You know, if the Joneses seem a little
bit more affectionate than we do,

358
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,115
it's because they haven't had to mute
their passions the way we have

359
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,741
'cause the kids have been around.

360
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,286
But now, it's our time.
It's our summer. Watch my hand there.

361
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:44,082
And I think it's time
to get busy sexually.

362
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,960
No. It tickles, honey. Honey!

363
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,294
-Honey, I know we said every second...
-Come on!

364
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,587
Look at the time. Look how late it is.

365
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,340
It's traditional Gaffney foreplay.
Let me just do it.

366
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,508
Come on, baby. Come on.

367
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,469
I'm so tired. But I pick up on things.

368
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:58,388
I was the one who noticed
when the McNultys

369
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,432
were pirating the Yamamotos' cable.

370
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,395
Yes, and intuition
is a wonderful thing.

371
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,481
And take it from me,
somebody who has had 16 years

372
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,860
of human resource experience,

373
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,656
that the Joneses are perfectly nice,
normal, everyday people.

374
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,292
I didn't know what to do.

375
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:31,921
Smoke blows from the car, you know?
So I figured

376
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:36,801
Americans are really good with car...
You strong man!

377
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,053
So you can help me out?

378
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,222
Absolutely.
You came to the right guys.

379
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,266
We Americans are good
at a lot of things.

380
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:27,579
Jeff.

381
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,209
Jeff, wake up.

382
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,206
Who are you, Tim Jones?

383
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,771
Sorry.

384
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:37,023
Neighbor!

385
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,942
-Hey, Jeff. This--
-Oh, my goodness.

386
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,402
This is embarrassing.

387
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,821
Well, it happens.
Jeepers, let me help you.

388
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,447
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

389
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,990
What are you doing here?

390
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,411
I found your love
of home brewing contagious.

391
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,287
And I figured I could use a hobby.

392
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,206
Instead of glass blowing?

393
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,500
Right. Besides that. Besides that.

394
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,919
It's a cool hobby, but it's probably
not as manly as you'd like.

395
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,716
Hey, Ed. Set my friend up here.

396
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,218
He's gonna need some wort chillers,
probably need some fizz drops.

397
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,469
-Give him some yeast.
-You're the expert.

398
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,221
-Yup.
-Don't let that yeast get infected.

399
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,305
-Okay.
-I'm kidding.

400
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,057
It's a joke.
It's a yeast infection joke.

401
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,227
-Expensive hobby.
-It's more of a calling, Tim.

402
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,273
-Hey, are you hungry?
-I'm famished.

403
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,608
-You like Chinese?
-The food?

404
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,819
Yeah.

405
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,246
Come on!

406
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,012
<i>Spy force on.</i>

407
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:17,374
I am leaving this message
in case anything happens to me.

408
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:20,877
I'm following Natalie Jones
who I have good reason to believe--

409
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,837
<i>-Calling Natalie Jones.
-No!</i>

410
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,257
No! No, no, no!

411
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,802
Siri!

412
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:36,810
Thank you.

413
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,771
Have a nice day.

414
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,407
How's the book?

415
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,701
Interesting.

416
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,356
Hi, there! Nice to see you.
Yes, indeed.

417
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,068
That's is my friend, Jeff.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Lu. Okay.

418
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,528
All right, we're gonna go on back.

419
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,823
I know! I feel like I've been
putting on a little too much.

420
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:35,035
Thank you. Come on
back here, Jeff. Thank you.

421
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,956
I'm doing a little piece on,
sort of, hidden gems around the city.

422
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,458
-Now, that place is good...
-Yeah?

423
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,961
...but this place is great.
Come on, follow me.

424
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,838
It's good to get out of the
cul-de-sac every now and again.

425
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,922
Well, it is, yeah.

426
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,215
-I love my cul-de-sac.
-There he is.

427
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,633
I knew I felt your presence, man!

428
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,093
-What's up, brother?
-How are you, pal?

429
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,178
This is my friend, Jeff.

430
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,262
Jeff, this is Ricky.
He owns the place.

431
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,638
-Hi, Ricky, how are you?
-What's up, Jeff?

432
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,349
You don't have to bow down.
Don't be shy.

433
00:25:57,932 --> 00:25:59,517
Come on in, man. This guy's stiff!

434
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,979
Welcome to the Cobra Club.

435
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,943
Well, now,
this is Jeff's first time. So...

436
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,696
Don't worry. We'll take
good care of him, man.

437
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,822
Where do you want us?

438
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,283
<i>-Right there, man.
-Thank you. I'll take a shГ©jiГ».</i>

439
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,576
-One?
-Yup.

440
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,660
-Yeah. Two.
-Two?

441
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,996
<i>-Whatever he's having.
-Two shГ©jiГ»s coming up.</i>

442
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,541
So? A little different
than you were expecting?

443
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,294
I gotta tell you. Spice and I
don't sit very well together.

444
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:30,215
There's certain ramifications the next
day, you know, toilet-wise, but--

445
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,050
This is not that.

446
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,803
Okay? It's not spicy,
but this is the real stuff.

447
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,054
I'm ready.

448
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:37,806
Actually, it reminds me
of when I went kayaking

449
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,100
down the Pearl River to Zhongshan.

450
00:26:40,141 --> 00:26:42,811
It's just beautiful. A lot of places,

451
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,187
just like this.

452
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,314
You have a fascinating job.

453
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,942
-Come on. So do you, Jeff.
-Yes.

454
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,610
I'm sure you could
tell me some stories.

455
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:53,321
I could tell you some stories
to make your skin crawl.

456
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,240
But I'm in HR.

457
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,158
There's a certain wall
of secrecy around me, so...

458
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,993
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me.

459
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,664
I'd probably just get in trouble
from corporate.

460
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:05,041
You wouldn't actually kill me.
It's just an expression.

461
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,043
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

462
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,878
-Here we go. All right.
-Okay.

463
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,256
Look at all these
little ethnic condiments.

464
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,674
-So cool.
-That is...

465
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,342
-Soy sauce.
-Soy sauce.

466
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,385
Try this.

467
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,429
Okay.

468
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,725
Wow! That's good!

469
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,561
What is that? That looks like a snake.

470
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,645
<i>ShГ©jiГ», man.</i>

471
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,938
Snake wine.

472
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,023
That's real cobra.

473
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,608
The alcohol neutralizes
most of the venom.

474
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,318
Yeah, in Guangdong, the old dudes say

475
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,405
you drink snake wine,
makes your sack hang real low, man.

476
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,781
Does it?

477
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,325
Do you have a Arnold Palmer by chance?

478
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:43,038
You guys want to hear
about tonight's offering?

479
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,331
Yes. Show us what you got. Thank you.

480
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,793
Where did you find this place? Yelp?

481
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:51,004
It's my job to find places like this.

482
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,132
I talk to people, I go places.
And when I find a place that I like,

483
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,717
I like to share it with people I like.

484
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,345
<i>ShГ©jiГ»! Okay, that's a live snake!</i>

485
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,138
Yes, Jeff. It's a snake restaurant.

486
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,849
Yeah, but Panda Express,
they don't serve panda.

487
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,352
Do they?

488
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,645
They call this "the 100-pace viper,"

489
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,523
because if it bites you, that's how
far you're gonna get, man.

490
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:11,983
-Is that true?
-No!

491
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,610
It's not true.

492
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,944
It's probably closer to 50 paces,

493
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:16,988
-honestly. It's very potent.
-Pretty bad, man.

494
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,908
I'm afraid of snakes.
I'll eat 'em. But, I'm so sorry.

495
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,868
Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's very good at his job.

496
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,496
Come on, sit down, okay?
Just let him do his thing.

497
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:25,663
-Yes.
-You're in good hands.

498
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,332
-Yes.
-Okay? Trust me.

499
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,294
You're gonna wanna keep
your hands away from the head,

500
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,880
'cause it can actually still bite you.
So, just be very careful.

501
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,757
Can I have a vegetable spring roll?

502
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,342
Buddy...

503
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,760
You're gonna be just fine. Here.

504
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,136
-A little more of that.
-Yeah.

505
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,262
-Yeah.
-Okay? This is good.

506
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,061
-We might need another bottle of this.
-Yeah.

507
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:50,021
Let's go ahead and get loosened up.

508
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,107
-Yeah. Snake it up.
-Yeah.

509
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,365
One second. That's Karen. Hello?

510
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,701
Remember I told you something
was off about the Joneses?

511
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,494
Well, my instincts were right.

512
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,706
<i>I just followed Natalie to the mall
and I have two words for you.</i>

513
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,290
<i>Sarah Palin.</i>

514
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,084
<i>And guess what?</i>

515
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,461
There is a Chinese word
for cul-de-sac. It's...

516
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:16,881
I'm sorry, I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

517
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:19,634
The point is, the Joneses
are not who they say they are.

518
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,266
Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.

519
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,855
Karen, I'm actually,
lunching with Tim right now.

520
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:35,483
There's nothing weird
going on whatsoever. I think...

521
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,528
I think you're just sublimating
your anxiety about the kids.

522
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,905
<i>You're having insecurities
about, you know, your career--</i>

523
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,365
Don't even begin to go there!

524
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,242
I don't throw your man crush
in your face.

525
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,412
I don't have a man crush!
I don't have a man crush.

526
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,248
I had it once in my life,
when I was a boy.

527
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,542
<i>-You mean Bruce?
-She likes to be called Caitlyn.</i>

528
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,445
No, no, no, you're absolutely right.

529
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:24,157
-Hello, Karen.
-Natalie!

530
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,492
What a surprise!

531
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,078
You've got no clothes on.
You're on the phone.

532
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,704
I'm gonna go.

533
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,415
To be continued.

534
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,420
I was just leaving Tim a voice mail.

535
00:30:38,421 --> 00:30:40,924
He likes to hear from me
when I'm trying on lingerie.

536
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,345
I tell him what I'm putting on,
how it looks.

537
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:48,598
How it makes me feel.

538
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,310
It looks great! I'm sure he...
I'm sure he's happy to know that.

539
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:54,312
Tell him from me.

540
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:58,817
Yeah, it's one of our things.
Keeps the spark alive.

541
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,860
Do you and Jeff have a thing?

542
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,613
Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.

543
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,031
We...

544
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,910
We do it really fast in case
the kids come running into our room.

545
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,706
Sounds like you're very sexual people.

546
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,710
-But your kids are gone, aren't they?
-Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,921
Time for something new.
Is that why you're buying lingerie?

548
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,507
Yes.

549
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,467
Let's see what you decided on.

550
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,178
No. I mean, I just-- It's just stuff.

551
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,556
Come on. Show me
what you think is sexy.

552
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:31,641
They're for Jeff's mom.

553
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,852
She's morbidly obese.
She drives around on a scooter.

554
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:35,353
I feel really bad for...

555
00:31:36,521 --> 00:31:38,064
Let's be real with one another, okay?

556
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:44,154
And he's dating Sheila Rondowski,
I think is her name, on the sly,

557
00:31:44,195 --> 00:31:45,989
which is a big no-no,
'cause she's his superior.

558
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,073
Sure.

559
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,783
This stuff is so good, Tim.
It's delicious.

560
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,577
Didn't I tell you?

561
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:54,164
I tell ya... Listen. It is impressive
how people open up to you.

562
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:56,291
-They tell you a lot.
-They do.

563
00:31:56,332 --> 00:31:57,584
It sounds like they complain
a lot, but...

564
00:31:57,625 --> 00:32:00,962
Gosh! It comes with the territory.
I'm fine with it. But, yes.

565
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,088
Let me ask you this.

566
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,508
Does anybody ever say
to you in confidence

567
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,844
how much they hate the company?

568
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,679
Ricky, let's get some more wine!

569
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,681
Hold a grudge? Anything like that?

570
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,768
Sara Patel, she has
irritable bowel syndro--

571
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,020
Excuse me. She has
irritable bowel syndrome.

572
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,564
There's a lot of co-workers,
too, that sit near the bathroom.

573
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,691
Sometimes, we're all irritated
by your bowels, Sara.

574
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,401
Everybody on the fourth floor knows.

575
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,652
But that's not what I'm talking about.

576
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:26,571
Is there ever a situation
where somebody seems

577
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,156
like they came into a lot of money,

578
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,617
or they, you know,
they bought a new car or new clothes?

579
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,118
-Looks like they won the lottery?
-Yes.

580
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,453
-Or hit the jackpot?
-Yeah.

581
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,622
-Yeah? Who's that?
-Sanjay. He bought a Grillbot.

582
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:36,748
What's that?

583
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,211
That's the guy I work with.
His name's Sanjay.

584
00:32:41,252 --> 00:32:43,963
No, I know what Sanjay is.
What's a Grillbot?

585
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:46,633
Grillbot is like-- It's just a...

586
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,803
It's just a-- What it is, is a robot
that cleans your barbecue grill.

587
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:51,888
You just put it in your grill,
you shut the lid,

588
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,517
and it just kind of ruminates in there
and gets all the little coal pieces,

589
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,353
the little icky pieces up.
And it's, you know, spick and span!

590
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,896
It's like a Roomba for your grill.

591
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:04,359
I'm thinking more of like the--
Like, like... More expensive.

592
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,986
These are $99, Tim. Expensive stuff.

593
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,321
Right.

594
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,573
But you gotta make sure the grill's
off. Sanjay didn't do that.

595
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:12,534
Are we done talking
about the Grillbot?

596
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,119
If you're not gonna eat this,
I'm gonna eat this.

597
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,037
No, no, no, go ahead.
Take what you like.

598
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,330
The thing is,

599
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:20,709
is he voided the warranty
on the Grillbot and the grill.

600
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,170
Jesus, Jeff! Ricky!

601
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,714
Oh, God! Put it down. Ricky!

602
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,549
Man! I've never seen that before.

603
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:28,800
Go find the shot!

604
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,093
The antivenom. Go get it!

605
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,261
Hey, little buddy!

606
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:34,097
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
No, no. Hey.

607
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,181
He's snacking on my hand.

608
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:36,766
Look at me!

609
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:38,018
All right. Get it out!

610
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,227
We're all gonna
have to have a relationship.

611
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:43,982
Hold on. We're gonna get the antivenom
okay, Jeff? Hold on a second.

612
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,942
You got it? All right.
Hold on, hold on.

613
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:50,113
How does that feel, buddy?
How does that feel?

614
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,701
That's good.

615
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,162
Now this would be incredible on you.

616
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,621
Perfect, I'll take it.

617
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,249
You're not being fun, Karen.

618
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:05,795
I want you to forget everything you
heard about functional breast support.

619
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,381
Why are you so nervous?

620
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:14,554
Is it because we're two women
trying on lingerie together?

621
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,142
Or because I know
you were following me today?

622
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,644
I wasn't following. What? No! No!

623
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:24,314
I was at the mall. I was shopping.
I wonder if they have this in yellow.

624
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,816
-Jeff's favorite color is yellow.
-I'm not stupid, Karen.

625
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:28,568
You're right to follow me.

626
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,906
To be thinking that this woman
is not who she pretends to be.

627
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,284
Because I'm hiding something.

628
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,078
You are?

629
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:40,663
So are you.

630
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,417
We're so alike, you and I.

631
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:49,297
Two strong, sexually vibrant women.
And yet, here we are.

632
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:53,134
Forced to bury our true selves
from the Meg Craverstons of the world.

633
00:34:53,176 --> 00:34:55,011
What's Meg got to do with this?

634
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,304
Come on, Karen.

635
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:59,140
I hear the way she talks about me
when she thinks I'm not looking.

636
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:01,059
Hating me for the way I look,

637
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:05,480
as if perfect bone structure and
flawless skin is something I can help!

638
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,984
I may not need to moisturize,
but I still have feelings.

639
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:13,947
I didn't know about the feelings.

640
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,575
That's why women like us
need to stick together.

641
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,452
Not follow each other in malls.

642
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,913
Do you Kegel?

643
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,707
Kegel?

644
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:25,959
You mean the exercises
for the lady parts?

645
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,461
Strength has to start somewhere.

646
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:30,505
Not-- I don't.

647
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,592
In fact, I'm doing some right now.

648
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:40,849
I could crack a walnut down there,
if I needed to.

649
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:42,976
Have you ever had any need to?

650
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,019
Now you go.

651
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,356
-I couldn't crack anything down there.
-Are we still hiding?

652
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:52,277
Come on, Karen.
Just... channel your power.

653
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,737
Okay. I'll do it. I'll try.

654
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:02,454
I did it! I felt it!

655
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:03,747
How was that?

656
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,540
Work in progress.

657
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,709
Now, you have a choice.

658
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:12,005
Which Karen do you wanna be?

659
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,632
Karen, the meek?

660
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:19,137
Or Karen, the strong?

661
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:23,475
-Sure you're okay?
-I'm okay. Yeah.

662
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:25,894
You saved my life.

663
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,730
And that was some good snake.

664
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,025
I'm embarrassed though.

665
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,277
Little drunk.

666
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,446
You had me worried there for a second.

667
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,323
Get yourself cleaned up.
I'll get the check.

668
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,367
I know what you're doing, Tim.

669
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,079
What am I doing, Jeff?

670
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,039
I read people for a living.
That's what I do.

671
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,918
And, you know, you get me drunk
on snake wine

672
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,045
and get me to open up
and tell you secrets.

673
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:54,923
You...

674
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,593
are trying to make a friend.

675
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,555
I got a lot of friends, Jeff.

676
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:05,308
Yeah, but you have a lot
of secrets locked inside of you.

677
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,937
I think that's why you might be one
of the loneliest guys I've ever met.

678
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,817
Now, what do you have
to say about that?

679
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,153
You wanna know something about me?

680
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,077
Sometimes I hate what I do
for a living.

681
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:28,289
But doesn't that feel good?

682
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,166
To express yourself?

683
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,592
-Is this us bonding now?
-No, this is us talking.

684
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:41,720
You want bonding?
I'll show you bonding.

685
00:37:41,761 --> 00:37:44,431
You're gonna look at me.
I'm gonna button you up.

686
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:47,267
Okay. Okay. That's loud.

687
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,737
Jesus, you do this for fun?

688
00:37:58,778 --> 00:38:00,405
I got you, okay?

689
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,669
Isn't this a blast?

690
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:15,837
Yeah!

691
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:41,446
-Hey, Karen! Karen?
-Hey, I'm here!

692
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,740
Hi, Karen. How are you?
I brought you some flowers.

693
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,408
Thank you, honey!

694
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,410
You're not gonna believe
the day that I had.

695
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,829
Guess who likes being
a man-bird as much as I do?

696
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,081
-Who?
-Tim Jones.

697
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:52,582
Look at that. Why are you wearing
a robe? Are you sick?

698
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:54,501
Nice. Honey,

699
00:38:54,542 --> 00:38:56,711
I'm just thinking.
What am I really doing this summer?

700
00:38:56,753 --> 00:39:00,799
I mean, I sent the kids away to camp,
I'm redesigning bathrooms.

701
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,342
Is that what makes me happy?

702
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,928
Is that what makes me,
Karen Gaffney, complete?

703
00:39:05,553 --> 00:39:08,598
Okay, well, listen,
if you wanna feel complete,

704
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,767
there's some exercises
I do at work with the guys...

705
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,852
Honey, no. They don't work.

706
00:39:12,894 --> 00:39:15,897
Now, I've lost touch
with the real Karen.

707
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,275
And then these amazing
new neighbors move in

708
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:21,695
and with me feeling so vulnerable,
it's only natural

709
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,364
that I would get suspicious
and find fault with them.

710
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:29,119
But really, I just feel like
I should be focusing on me.

711
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,453
And on us.

712
00:39:34,457 --> 00:39:36,126
Sweet baby Jesus, what's happening?

713
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:38,837
Natalie said we needed a thing
to keep our spark alive.

714
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,463
You've been talking to Natalie
about us sexually?

715
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:43,008
No, obviously.
I didn't tell her anything, honey.

716
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,510
No, I just mean
she's unusually intuitive.

717
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,720
-For a Greek.
-Right.

718
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,638
And she just thinks
that once you're married

719
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,890
at a certain point,
you have to make more of an effort.

720
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:53,393
This is the Karen that I--
This is the Karen that I love.

721
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,562
I really do. Take me.

722
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,355
Take me, darling.

723
00:39:58,356 --> 00:39:59,441
Okay.

724
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,404
Shoot, honey.

725
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:07,699
It was the conversation piece.

726
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:09,659
Don't worry about it.

727
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:15,874
What is that?

728
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:17,625
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Come on.

729
00:40:17,667 --> 00:40:19,002
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

730
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,255
You know what, honey?
We need to go back to our lovemaking.

731
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,590
-Where were we?
-Yeah, okay.

732
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:26,134
-It's so hot! It's so hot!
-Yeah. Okay, I-- Should I grope you?

733
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:28,303
-Great!
-Yeah.

734
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,889
Let's go back. Jeff, Jeff!

735
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,725
-It's so hot!
-So, you are sick?

736
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,019
You know what?
I'll tell you what we should do.

737
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,688
We should put on a soundtrack
for our passion.

738
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,316
You want a little passion music?
This calls for The Judds.

739
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,651
-We're gonna put on some music.
-Okay.

740
00:40:43,693 --> 00:40:45,653
I'm going to put the wine glasses
in the dishwasher.

741
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,530
Right. Okay, so you got--
You wanna narrate!

742
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:49,074
Okay. All right. I got you. So...

743
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:51,451
And then... This is so much fun!

744
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,746
The blood leaves Jeff's head

745
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,332
and slowly makes its way
to his midsection.

746
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,958
I don't know why we're in the closet.

747
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,210
-It seems very un-erotic to me.
-Honey, listen!

748
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,170
Listen! Because
our neighbors bugged us!

749
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,214
Told you something
was wrong with them.

750
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:06,633
Makes a little more sense
what Tim was doing in your den.

751
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:07,842
And do not tell me
that he had to poop.

752
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:10,220
He did not have to go number two.

753
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:12,222
And now I know what Natalie
was doing at the cafГ©.

754
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:14,599
It was a drop!

755
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,601
A drop? What are you talking about?

756
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,228
I can't believe she duped me
into this lingerie.

757
00:41:18,269 --> 00:41:20,355
But she was in her underwear
and I was in my underwear and--

758
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,982
Oh, my God! She was so persuasive.

759
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:24,818
Wait. You were both in your
underwear at the same time?

760
00:41:24,859 --> 00:41:26,695
Get your mind out of the gutter!
It was a charade!

761
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,906
Okay, Karen, I just wanna make sure
this isn't another case of paranoia.

762
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,783
Remember the time you made me sleep in
the car 'cause I ate that hot pepper

763
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,159
and you thought I was possessed?

764
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,495
Your eyes were all red. You were
trying to have sex on a school night.

765
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,914
I know, but it was just the jalapeeno.
That's my point.

766
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,749
God! We gotta call the cops!

767
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,835
Call the cops and tell them what?
Our neighbors bugged the house?

768
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:43,211
-Yes!
-That sounds crazy!

769
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,963
What happens when
we really need the cops?

770
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,464
They won't come to our house. Why?

771
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:48,800
Because we're on some kind
of crazy list. That's crazy.

772
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,343
You're right. We need more evidence.

773
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:54,431
-And it's a jalapeГ±o.
-Karen. Karen!

774
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:58,101
Karen!

775
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:02,063
Kar-- Karen, look.

776
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:03,857
I know that you miss
Mikey and Patrick,

777
00:42:03,898 --> 00:42:05,567
but parents weekend
is not for two weeks.

778
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:06,651
Get down!

779
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,486
Parents weekend isn't for two weeks.

780
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:11,114
Maybe we can do some
breathing exercises to center you.

781
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:14,701
Jeff, I don't need to do any deep
breathing exercises! I'm centered!

782
00:42:15,243 --> 00:42:16,578
It's quiet over there.

783
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,413
It's too quiet.

784
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:21,875
They're probably watching us,
watching them.

785
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:25,170
They're not watching us! They're at
a restaurant with Stacey Chung.

786
00:42:25,962 --> 00:42:27,047
How do you know that?

787
00:42:27,088 --> 00:42:29,591
Because we talked about it
at the indoor skydiving place!

788
00:42:29,632 --> 00:42:31,217
Why didn't you tell me?

789
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,927
Karen, stop!

790
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,263
Darling, stop, please!
Think about what you're doing.

791
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:36,514
You'll go to jail
for something like this.

792
00:42:36,556 --> 00:42:37,640
Only if I get caught.

793
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:39,601
See? No fingerprints.

794
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,936
Now, people move in,
they always change the locks,

795
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:44,064
but they never change
the garage remote.

796
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:46,649
I forgot to give it back when Bridget
and Dave went to Myrtle Beach

797
00:42:46,691 --> 00:42:47,859
and asked me to feed Smokey.

798
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:56,451
Are you coming?
You're gonna need to cover your hands.

799
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,328
Cover my hands? With what?

800
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,496
Use your socks.

801
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,917
Oh, God! It looks like a show home.

802
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:08,421
-They painted over Bridget's mural.
-That's a real tragedy.

803
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:12,092
Look, there's nothing weird here.
Let's go, let's go!

804
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:16,846
Karen! There are windows everywhere.
Get down! Get down!

805
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,015
So weird.

806
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,434
Stand up!

807
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:26,439
These pots have never seen
a lick of flame.

808
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,692
Little weird for someone
with a cooking blog?

809
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:31,611
Well, it's a new house, new pots.
It makes sense to me.

810
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,698
And an empty spice rack. She wows
the neighbors with her appetizers.

811
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:35,824
No spices.

812
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:38,326
Never judge a woman
by her spice rack, Karen.

813
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,036
Check for stuff about
Sri Lankan orphans.

814
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,746
I bet that's another web of lies!

815
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:50,296
Sorry, Tim, for breaking
into your house.

816
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:52,132
I just wanted to be your friend.

817
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:53,633
This certainly isn't
a friendly gesture.

818
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,635
You know what, honey? I can hear you.

819
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,595
And it hurts my feelings
when you're not supportive.

820
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:59,305
Karen, this is ridiculous!

821
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:01,975
It's gotta be here somewhere.

822
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:06,771
Karen! Karen, Karen, Karen!

823
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,566
Look at them. So perfect.

824
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:18,867
Karen, come on, let's go.

825
00:44:19,534 --> 00:44:20,744
Look at this.

826
00:44:20,785 --> 00:44:22,620
Okay. So, they're gamers. Let's go.

827
00:44:29,502 --> 00:44:31,421
Karen! Don't! What are you doing?

828
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:35,091
Stacey Chung.
Isn't she out with the Joneses?

829
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,134
Yeah.

830
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,136
Ted Wallace.

831
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,679
He works with you, right?

832
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:42,807
Yeah. Maybe it's just some
kind of social media thing.

833
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,225
Dhameer Mustafa?

834
00:44:44,267 --> 00:44:45,810
There's Dan.

835
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,437
Sanjay.

836
00:44:55,278 --> 00:44:57,155
Oh, God! They're targeting MBI.

837
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:00,158
There's some kind of missile.

838
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,993
These are all the people
he was asking me about.

839
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,204
Oh, my God! I told him everything.

840
00:45:04,245 --> 00:45:05,747
-Oh, God.
-We've gotta go.

841
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:06,831
Switch down the computer, honey.

842
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,291
We gotta get out of here.

843
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,252
I can't get any purchase on the mouse
because I have a sock hand.

844
00:45:11,294 --> 00:45:12,420
-Okay, hold on.
-Switch it off! Put it back.

845
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,047
-Karen...
-Put it back the--

846
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,257
No! You don't understand!
They're spies.

847
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,760
-Karen, please, okay? Just shh!
-We gotta go right now!

848
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:19,928
I need to write these names down.

849
00:45:19,969 --> 00:45:21,304
What are you doing? We gotta go!

850
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,890
They could be back at any second.

851
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:24,933
What are you staring at?

852
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:26,893
What is that? A pen?

853
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:27,977
What?

854
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:29,938
-What?
-You have a...

855
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:35,527
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Now what?

856
00:45:35,568 --> 00:45:36,903
Oh, shit, I killed her.

857
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:38,238
Karen!

858
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,281
Karen!

859
00:45:40,323 --> 00:45:41,408
Thank God!

860
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:42,492
Honey.

861
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:47,664
Okay, we gotta go. Karen, wake up!

862
00:45:56,923 --> 00:45:57,966
Oh, God.

863
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:00,885
Okay. Okay. Damn!

864
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,100
Sorry. Sorry.

865
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,519
-You're welcome, baby.
-Okay.

866
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,190
-You're so cute!
-Karen, shh!

867
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,610
Okay. Okay.

868
00:46:17,652 --> 00:46:20,989
Why are you shushing me?
They haven't any dogs.

869
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:29,622
I thought Chili's
was supposed to be fancy.

870
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:31,624
Yeah, I don't think you ordered well.

871
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,879
Remember when we were in college,

872
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,382
and your parents, they almost caught
us in the bushes, and we hid!

873
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,092
Yeah.

874
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,635
Wait, I met you after college.

875
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,306
Oh, my God!

876
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:48,016
It's almost like our wedding night.

877
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:50,018
Why did we do that? What are we doing?

878
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,102
What do we do?

879
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,313
Jeff, you're being so serious!

880
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:56,983
-I'm Jeff. I'm so serious.
-Karen, Karen, Karen!

881
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,444
-Why are you being so serious?
-Okay.

882
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:02,155
-Stop licking me!
-Yeah.

883
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:03,448
Okay, listen. Oh, shit!

884
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,492
Shit.

885
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:08,244
-I'm getting on top!
-I--

886
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:09,371
I'm getting on top.

887
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:10,997
-Karen! Karen! Karen!
-I'm on top!

888
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,957
That makes me feel weird.
Karen, please.

889
00:47:12,999 --> 00:47:14,876
I'm not into this right now,
sweetheart.

890
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,628
I'm not really into this.

891
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,714
-Cuddle me.
-No cuddling! Our neighbors are spies!

892
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:22,217
-Our neighbors are spies.
-I wanna cuddle. Cuddle me.

893
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:24,219
Look at them up there.

894
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:27,597
Probably going upstairs to make sex,
and they won't even think about us.

895
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,142
You broke my heart, Tim Jones.

896
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:34,562
You broke my heart.

897
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:37,482
I'm just saying,
the place is called Chili's.

898
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,692
-It's a Mexican place.
-I can't believe...

899
00:47:38,733 --> 00:47:40,318
-I don't know why you would...
-...we're still talking about that.

900
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,778
...order anything remotely Asian.

901
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,365
Okay. I guess we can cross off Stacey.

902
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,991
She's not going to give us anything.

903
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:49,285
Hey, do you know what a Grillbot is?

904
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,371
What?

905
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,331
It's this thing. Jeff was telling me
about it the other day.

906
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,543
It's this little robot
that cleans your barbecue--

907
00:47:56,584 --> 00:47:58,503
I hope this is not going to be
a problem.

908
00:47:59,504 --> 00:48:00,505
What?

909
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,347
First rule of what we do. Don't get
too close to your targets. Remember?

910
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,598
Actually...

911
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,519
the first rule of what we do, is to
not fall in love with your partner.

912
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,606
Right? Wasn't that the first rule?

913
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:19,983
Tim Jones.

914
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,737
What am I going to do with you?

915
00:48:25,238 --> 00:48:26,990
I don't know.

916
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:28,324
-You don't know?
-I don't know.

917
00:48:28,366 --> 00:48:30,285
-I have a few ideas.
-I have some ideas too.

918
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:31,411
You do?

919
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:34,247
-Should I start now?
-Yes, you should.

920
00:48:36,624 --> 00:48:39,669
Okay. Okay.

921
00:48:48,803 --> 00:48:50,805
Well, that might be a problem.

922
00:48:59,272 --> 00:49:00,940
Hey, buddy. Can I use your computer?

923
00:49:00,982 --> 00:49:03,026
I need to check
my fantasy baseball roster.

924
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,277
Go ahead. Go ahead.

925
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,320
Thanks.

926
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,249
What is happening?

927
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:20,835
You okay, Jeff?
You seem kind of distant.

928
00:49:20,877 --> 00:49:22,629
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

929
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,924
sifting through the wreckage
of every value I once held dear.

930
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,095
Good. I was worried
it might be something real.

931
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:35,558
Hey, Dan.

932
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,395
Dan!

933
00:49:47,028 --> 00:49:49,155
The Joneses aren't
who they say they are.

934
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:51,074
What are you talking about?

935
00:49:52,867 --> 00:49:53,868
Your phone.

936
00:49:54,577 --> 00:49:56,454
Okay. Okay.

937
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:00,500
The Joneses are spies.

938
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,626
Spies?

939
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:07,632
Spies?

940
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:11,052
Yes! They planted a bug in our house.

941
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:17,517
I can't believe I let Tim diaper me

942
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:20,478
dupe me

943
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,773
Have you told anyone?

944
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,359
I'm meeting with Carl Pronger
in Security

945
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:28,653
<i>But it's not like that, I swear!</i>

946
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,156
Sometimes she picks up on things.
This time she was right.

947
00:50:31,197 --> 00:50:32,574
You have to take this upstairs, Carl!

948
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:35,744
This company, my neighborhood,

949
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:39,414
Western civilization as we know it,
they're all at risk.

950
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,543
And it might be my fault.

951
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,507
All right, Gaffney.
I'll do some digging.

952
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:50,759
Okay. Thank you.

953
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,594
See what I can learn
about these devices.

954
00:50:52,635 --> 00:50:55,805
And if I find out they're real,
and not from some hobby shop,

955
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,558
-well, you wait for my call.
-Okay.

956
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:27,796
Go for Jeff.

957
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:30,382
I gotta say, Gaffney,
you and your wife were right.

958
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:34,219
<i>You know those devices you gave me?
I was talking to a friend of mine.</i>

959
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,679
Ex-military.

960
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,848
And well, this line is unsecured,
so I can't go into details,

961
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,811
but let me just say,
this stuff is the real shit!

962
00:51:42,852 --> 00:51:46,231
God! Okay. Who are the Joneses
working for? Are they Russian?

963
00:51:46,272 --> 00:51:47,482
Damn it, Gaffney.

964
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,984
What is it about the word
"unsecured" that you don't get?

965
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:51,736
<i>Look, I'm gonna do some more digging,</i>

966
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:53,988
and then you meet with me
before work tomorrow.

967
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,490
Okay.

968
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,492
You know the old MBI building? On 75?

969
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,744
<i>7:00 a.m. Just look for the van.</i>

970
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:01,037
Why are we meeting there?

971
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,416
Well, so we can strategize
before we take it upstairs!

972
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:06,710
<i>My buddy says the last time
he saw tech like that</i>

973
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:08,378
<i>was on a dead man.</i>

974
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,504
Dead man? Why would you say--

975
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:11,923
Jesus!

976
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,136
<i>"Jesus" is right.</i>

977
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,889
<i>Gaffney, this is the big time!
I mean, we are going all the way.</i>

978
00:52:19,931 --> 00:52:22,142
<i>-Not now, Carl. Not now.
-Don't try to give me the brush off.</i>

979
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:23,893
<i>If you think you're gonna
handle this yourself...</i>

980
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:26,062
<i>-Okay, okay.
-...you're making a big mistake!</i>

981
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,733
<i>-Work buddy.
-Gaffney, don't mess this up!</i>

982
00:52:29,774 --> 00:52:33,069
<i>-Carl! Okay, yeah. Good.
-7:00 a.m. Bring lattes...</i>

983
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,448
You okay there, buddy?
You almost ran me over.

984
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:39,200
Yeah, I was looking for Bernie.
He keeps pooping

985
00:52:39,242 --> 00:52:41,286
in my yard and I was just--
I mean, his dogs keep

986
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:44,372
pooping in my yard. I was distracted.

987
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,957
How are you?

988
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,417
You don't seem like yourself, Jeff.

989
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:48,877
You don't seem like yourself, Tim.

990
00:52:48,918 --> 00:52:50,253
What's that supposed to mean?

991
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:53,256
I was... You said it to me. I was...
What did you mean when you said it?

992
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:55,925
We think we had a break-in last night.

993
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:58,386
-What?
-Yeah. I know. Really rocks your

994
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,138
faith in the notion of trust,
doesn't it?

995
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:02,682
Tell me about it. My gosh!

996
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:03,808
You'd think in a neighborhood
like this

997
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,352
you wouldn't have to worry
about something like that.

998
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:06,895
I'm so sorry about that, Tim.

999
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:10,523
Yeah, well, Jeff,
here's the thing about trust.

1000
00:53:11,274 --> 00:53:15,445
Once it's gone, bad things happen.

1001
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,697
I heard that.

1002
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,116
Okay, well, I should go.

1003
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:21,743
Karen and I are supposed to
take a bath.

1004
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:41,096
Yeah, a little warning.
Carl can be a bit prickly,

1005
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,682
but he's a top notch security man
and he happens to like the way

1006
00:53:43,723 --> 00:53:45,725
-your mind thinks, okay?
-Okay.

1007
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:50,397
Is that him in the bathrobe
hanging laundry?

1008
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:53,274
I don't know.
Maybe he's having a yard sale.

1009
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:58,071
Gaffney, right on time!

1010
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:01,116
And you brought the lattes.
Knew I could count on you.

1011
00:54:01,157 --> 00:54:03,993
This is my wife Carl.
I mean, this is my wife, Carl.

1012
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:05,120
Nice to meet you.

1013
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:06,204
-Nice to meet you.
-Karen Gaffney.

1014
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:08,665
Yeah, well, welcome
to my home away from home.

1015
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,917
Or to be more accurate, my home.

1016
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,920
But not for long.
Here, please. Thank you.

1017
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,088
Sit down here.

1018
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,840
Let me just clear this stuff away.

1019
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:19,801
Get this laundry outta here.

1020
00:54:22,595 --> 00:54:23,847
It's the maid's day off.

1021
00:54:23,888 --> 00:54:26,099
Not at all. It's just that

1022
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:28,184
when you told us to meet you
at the van,

1023
00:54:28,226 --> 00:54:29,853
I didn't realize
you'd be living in it.

1024
00:54:29,894 --> 00:54:31,730
Yeah, well, the truth is...

1025
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:33,857
you know, I've been living
in the old Westfalia here

1026
00:54:33,898 --> 00:54:37,235
ever since my wife left me
and took everything I had.

1027
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,112
-Sorry, Carl.
-That's terrible.

1028
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,823
And now thanks to you for bringing me
in on this deal, Jeff.

1029
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:44,284
I think things are finally
starting to break my way again!

1030
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:45,618
What do you have for us?

1031
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,288
Oh, boy, what have I got?
Let me show you here.

1032
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:51,833
You know, here's something that Jeff
never thought he'd hear. Gaffney...

1033
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,544
are you ready for a level four
security clearance?

1034
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,423
-Okay.
-Okay. Here we go.

1035
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,758
-Carl.
-Yeah?

1036
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,926
You got like a red dot
on your forehead.

1037
00:55:01,968 --> 00:55:03,845
It's called adult acne.
Thank you very mu--

1038
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:07,515
God!

1039
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:08,600
I've been hit!

1040
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,769
I've been hit! I've been hit!

1041
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:14,898
Oh, my God! Shit.

1042
00:55:14,939 --> 00:55:16,191
-Are you hurt?
-I've been shot!

1043
00:55:16,232 --> 00:55:18,360
God! No, honey, it's just the latte!

1044
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,111
It burns! It burns!

1045
00:55:22,238 --> 00:55:24,074
Oh, shit! It's the Joneses!

1046
00:55:24,657 --> 00:55:26,368
Try not to shoot them.

1047
00:55:26,409 --> 00:55:27,994
Let's run for Carl's house.

1048
00:55:28,787 --> 00:55:30,372
Oh, God!

1049
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,127
Get in the car! Now!

1050
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:38,463
Let us get on with
our stupid little lives!

1051
00:55:41,716 --> 00:55:44,844
Get in the car now
and I will explain everything. Mostly.

1052
00:55:44,886 --> 00:55:46,971
I'm tired of your
silver-tongued lies, Jones!

1053
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:49,432
Do you wanna get killed
out here? Get in the car!

1054
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,059
Why? So you could kill us in there?

1055
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:53,520
There were no spices
in your spice rack!

1056
00:55:54,312 --> 00:55:57,148
I said get in the car.

1057
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,817
We're gonna get in the car.

1058
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:01,903
For Patrick and Mikey. Right, honey?

1059
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:03,988
Guys, now. It is very dangerous. Now!

1060
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,408
When I count to three
we're gonna run, okay?

1061
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:08,451
One... Two...

1062
00:56:09,035 --> 00:56:10,078
Jeff!

1063
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,038
-Oh, my God!
-I said three!

1064
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,291
Jeff, please, would you
just get in the car?

1065
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:16,376
I was making a head start!

1066
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,627
On your wife?

1067
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:18,753
You two are acting like children
right now.

1068
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,214
Now, get in the car.
Right now. Get in this car.

1069
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,134
Put your seat belt on,
for Christ's sake.

1070
00:56:24,175 --> 00:56:25,218
-Oh, my God.
-Come on!

1071
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,886
-Go, go, go.
-Let's go, let's go.

1072
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:29,848
What is going on here, Tim?

1073
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,224
Are you stealing secrets from MBI?

1074
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,976
We're not stealing secrets from you.

1075
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:34,602
-There they are.
-I see them.

1076
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:36,146
We're spies.

1077
00:56:36,187 --> 00:56:37,647
His seat belt is jammed! Pull over.

1078
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,233
-Shut up!
-Jeff gets car sick in the back!

1079
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,860
-Quiet!
-Shut up!

1080
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:46,906
You broke into our house.

1081
00:56:46,948 --> 00:56:48,700
What kind of neighbors are you?

1082
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:51,077
You planted a bug in our house.
What kind of neighbors are you?

1083
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:53,621
You know, they kind of have a point.

1084
00:56:54,622 --> 00:56:55,665
It's so hot in here.

1085
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:56,833
-Put the AC on. Please!
-No.

1086
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,043
Can you turn the
air conditioner on, please?

1087
00:56:58,084 --> 00:57:00,295
-It's not going on!
-It's hot.

1088
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:09,054
My seat belt's not on! Wait!

1089
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,938
Okay, it's about to get weird.

1090
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,690
About to get weird?

1091
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:36,915
Quick question. Are you guys
the good guys or bad guys?

1092
00:57:37,665 --> 00:57:38,750
What do you think?

1093
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,960
-I think the guys in black...
-Shit!

1094
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:43,505
...on the motorcycles shooting at us
might be the bad guys.

1095
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,092
Get down, get down, get down!

1096
00:57:58,645 --> 00:57:59,938
What is that?

1097
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,815
It's camp.

1098
00:58:01,856 --> 00:58:03,149
What?

1099
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:05,276
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

1100
00:58:06,027 --> 00:58:08,196
-The cookies are for both of you.
-Karen!

1101
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,699
Mikey, if you split it,
he gets to choose first.

1102
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,325
-Karen!
-Because that's fair!

1103
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:16,079
Get down! Get down
Karen, get off the phone!

1104
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,248
Because otherwise you would
make one piece bigger.

1105
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:20,375
And then you'd pick that one.
Put Mikey on, put--

1106
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,335
Just split the cookie!
Just split the cookie!

1107
00:58:24,504 --> 00:58:25,547
Oh, shit!

1108
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:50,405
To the right, Natalie.

1109
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,531
Thanks, Karen.

1110
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:54,534
Brake!

1111
00:58:58,371 --> 00:58:59,831
Oh, my God!

1112
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:07,380
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1113
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,345
Please get out of the way.

1114
00:59:13,386 --> 00:59:15,722
Please get out of the way
so I can see.

1115
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,912
There's something blinking on the back
of the car. Is that bad?

1116
00:59:39,829 --> 00:59:41,664
Yes, Jeff, that is decidedly bad.

1117
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:43,458
You need to go out there
and take that off.

1118
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,794
-Wha... I need to take it off?
-Yes!

1119
00:59:45,835 --> 00:59:47,337
-Well, can you slow down?
-No!

1120
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,130
-I'm driving. We're being chased.
-Get it off!

1121
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:50,548
I'm not gonna slow down.
They're trying to kill us!

1122
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:52,717
Right. Coming from the guy who
wouldn't turn on the air conditioner.

1123
00:59:54,552 --> 00:59:55,970
Slow down a little bit.

1124
00:59:56,012 --> 00:59:58,139
I'm getting wet! I'm getting wet!

1125
00:59:58,181 --> 01:00:00,016
Getting wet is better
than getting shot!

1126
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,063
It's hot!

1127
01:00:11,027 --> 01:00:12,445
Three targets, two shots.
You got this?

1128
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:13,780
Always.

1129
01:00:14,447 --> 01:00:16,533
How you doing back there, Jeff?
We need you, buddy.

1130
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,453
Wait.

1131
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:22,831
-Okay.
-Wait.

1132
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:24,958
Now.

1133
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,794
I got it! I got it! Now what?

1134
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:28,878
Hold on, Jeff!

1135
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,012
Throw it! Throw it!

1136
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:52,318
Five here? So, what do you think?
I think I'm stuck.

1137
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,739
Yeah. Well, I think one, two, three,
four, five... It's gotta be six.

1138
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:57,073
Here we go, folks.

1139
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:59,159
-Scrambled whites with toast.
-Thank you.

1140
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,578
-Three-egg omelet with potatoes.
-Thank you!

1141
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:04,289
Eggs, potatoes, and bacon.
And a side of bacon.

1142
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,583
-Yum, yum, yum, yum!
-Thank you very much.

1143
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,043
Oh, my goodness!

1144
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:16,009
What? High speed car chases
make me hungry, honey.

1145
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:21,348
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's
who, you know, you really are.

1146
01:01:21,389 --> 01:01:23,266
I have a couple of questions. And...

1147
01:01:23,975 --> 01:01:26,144
I think this time
we kind of deserve the truth.

1148
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:27,854
You're entitled to it.

1149
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,898
Okay, question number one.

1150
01:01:29,939 --> 01:01:31,191
Are you in the CIA?

1151
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,236
Honey, that's a wasted question.
They can't answer that.

1152
01:01:35,987 --> 01:01:37,947
Question number two then.
Who are you after?

1153
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:39,824
We can't tell you.

1154
01:01:40,658 --> 01:01:42,994
Okay. Question number three.
Is it somebody we know?

1155
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,037
Can't say that, either.

1156
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:46,164
You just said we were
entitled to the truth.

1157
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,083
Did say you were entitled to it.
Doesn't mean we can give it to you.

1158
01:01:48,124 --> 01:01:49,209
You know what, honey?

1159
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,127
It's probably classified.
That's why they can't tell us.

1160
01:01:51,169 --> 01:01:53,880
-Do you want any of this?
-Yeah. I'll have some potatoes.

1161
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:55,715
I'm glad everybody's just

1162
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:58,134
enjoying their meal
while we're in the middle

1163
01:01:58,176 --> 01:02:00,470
of a... Like, a thing!

1164
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:02,472
You guys are just eating
like there's nothing going on.

1165
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,057
I'm a little troubled by it!

1166
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:09,020
Honey! That is not okay.

1167
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:12,273
Fine. I'll keep asking 'til I get
something that's not classified.

1168
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:13,358
Is that fine with you?

1169
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,401
Okay.

1170
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,948
Question 17.

1171
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:22,784
After a shootout like that,
who cleans up all the bullets?

1172
01:02:24,577 --> 01:02:26,204
Okay, can you guys
tell us anything at all?

1173
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,709
I'm not Greek. I'm Israeli.

1174
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,751
Ex-Mossad?

1175
01:02:32,335 --> 01:02:33,378
Can't tell you.

1176
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,713
Come on. Are you guys even married?

1177
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:36,631
Can you even tell us that?

1178
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,175
Yes. That actually you can't fake.

1179
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:41,803
But that's it?
Everything else was a lie?

1180
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,100
I mean, 'cause I think when you
told me that you hated your job,

1181
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:49,436
that seemed real. I mean,
from an HR perspective.

1182
01:02:49,477 --> 01:02:51,146
That seemed real.

1183
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,277
You told him you hate your job?

1184
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:03,825
I may have mentioned
certain misgivings, in confidence.

1185
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,285
Interesting.

1186
01:03:05,326 --> 01:03:06,578
Why is this coming out now?

1187
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:10,165
Because Jeff is actually
a good listener.

1188
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:13,084
And I did mention that
to you before, in Marrakesh.

1189
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,128
At that place that
we always go to. Hazim's.

1190
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,714
That day, we spent the whole
afternoon there.

1191
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,425
We talked about maybe getting
out of this. We talked about

1192
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:23,636
I could actually become
a travel writer, for real.

1193
01:03:23,678 --> 01:03:24,929
We could maybe have a child.

1194
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:26,973
That was hypothetical.
It wasn't a life plan.

1195
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,350
I didn't think it--

1196
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:30,477
Okay, this is what we do.
Automatically, we go to Hebrew

1197
01:03:30,518 --> 01:03:32,312
and then it's gonna be a whole thing.

1198
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,147
And who puts a bug
in a glass sculpture?

1199
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,816
I happen to like my glass sculptures
and I like to share them with people.

1200
01:03:36,858 --> 01:03:38,485
It's a legitimate thing.
It's actually appropriate

1201
01:03:38,526 --> 01:03:40,737
to give somebody a gift.
What isn't appropriate,

1202
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,990
however, is what you happened
to wear at the yard party.

1203
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:46,242
Now you want me to dress
like some kind of a sexless

1204
01:03:46,284 --> 01:03:47,535
-elementary school nurse...
-Come on. I'm not talking...

1205
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:49,079
...just to fit in with
the other mothers, right?

1206
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,163
-No offense, Karen.
-You look great!

1207
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,499
You look amazing.
But you have to fit in.

1208
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:54,501
I mean, it's called being undercover.

1209
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:57,796
I mean, you had no problem
wearing a burqa in Kabul.

1210
01:03:57,837 --> 01:03:58,880
But this is the suburbs!

1211
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:02,133
It's hard. Don't you get it?
Women here are vicious.

1212
01:04:02,175 --> 01:04:04,010
Can I say? You don't know
the women here.

1213
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,054
There you go.

1214
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,180
We don't know anything.

1215
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:08,598
Why did you bug our house?

1216
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,183
Actually, you know less than nothing.

1217
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:12,268
But the agency received credible intel

1218
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:15,313
that someone was using your
work computer to commit treason

1219
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,815
against the United States of America.

1220
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,276
We were using you
to get to whoever they are.

1221
01:04:20,318 --> 01:04:21,444
Why not tell him everything?

1222
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:22,654
Who cares?

1223
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:25,615
Ten years, 30 countries,
nobody finds us out,

1224
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:28,368
and we couldn't even
last a week in suburbia!

1225
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,828
Can I pay, please?

1226
01:04:45,301 --> 01:04:47,554
Stupid question. What do we do now?

1227
01:04:47,595 --> 01:04:48,680
Yeah, what do we do now?

1228
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,306
Just stick to your routine.

1229
01:04:50,348 --> 01:04:52,892
And nobody finds out
about any of this, okay?

1230
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:54,561
I won't tell anybody.

1231
01:04:54,602 --> 01:04:55,687
Yeah, keep it quiet.

1232
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,480
There's this other thing
I needed to ask.

1233
01:04:57,522 --> 01:05:01,568
I know you guys are undercover and
this whole thing is a setup, but...

1234
01:05:01,609 --> 01:05:02,694
The other day at the Cobra Club,

1235
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,488
was that about getting me drunk
and having me betray my co-workers

1236
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:10,869
or was that about two guys, you know,
maybe starting a friendship?

1237
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,955
It was about getting you drunk
and betraying your co-workers.

1238
01:05:14,789 --> 01:05:16,666
Okay. Yeah.

1239
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:18,168
But the indoor skydiving...

1240
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:21,713
that was about being friends.

1241
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:24,591
See, I told you we bonded.

1242
01:05:24,632 --> 01:05:27,302
Okay. Remember,
nobody finds out about this.

1243
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,679
-No. I won't even tell my mom.
-Locking it up. Hey, hey.

1244
01:05:30,847 --> 01:05:34,517
One other thing. I know I'm not
a licensed therapist, okay?

1245
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:38,605
But talk, communicate
with one another, okay?

1246
01:05:38,646 --> 01:05:40,857
Jeff is big on communication.

1247
01:05:41,566 --> 01:05:42,901
I communicate. That's what I do.

1248
01:05:42,942 --> 01:05:44,652
-You sure do.
-Talk, talk, talk.

1249
01:05:44,694 --> 01:05:47,197
No, no, no, no, no.
You're absolutely right, Jeff.

1250
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,200
Communication is a great thing.

1251
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,912
-All right, I'll see you.
-Bye!

1252
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:55,705
-Thanks!
-I should go.

1253
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:56,748
-Okay. Take care.
-See you.

1254
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,126
That's so nice of you
to tell them that, honey. Really.

1255
01:06:02,295 --> 01:06:04,172
I think the Joneses
are going to be just fine.

1256
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:05,465
Yeah.

1257
01:06:12,889 --> 01:06:15,058
-After you, my dear.
-Thank you.

1258
01:06:29,614 --> 01:06:30,865
Timmy!

1259
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:57,183
Well, it was most likely
just a gas leak. So...

1260
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,145
Well, thank you for your statements.

1261
01:07:00,186 --> 01:07:01,730
-Thank you very much.
-Good night.

1262
01:07:06,526 --> 01:07:08,194
Okay.

1263
01:07:08,236 --> 01:07:10,739
Whoever killed the Joneses
are gonna come after us next.

1264
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:13,783
Do you think we did the right thing
by lying to the police?

1265
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,161
We promised the Joneses
that we wouldn't say anything.

1266
01:07:16,202 --> 01:07:17,829
Do you think that
promises count, honey,

1267
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:19,581
when the people that we made
them to are dead?

1268
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:20,707
Yes!

1269
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:22,751
Plus, I don't wanna be haunted.

1270
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,507
-They've taken the barricades down.
-Oh, my God!

1271
01:07:29,549 --> 01:07:31,301
All right, listen,
I'm gonna grab the essentials.

1272
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,510
We're gonna need our passports.

1273
01:07:32,552 --> 01:07:33,678
We're gonna need
our birth certificates.

1274
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,763
And we'll need some duct tape.

1275
01:07:34,804 --> 01:07:36,014
Get some peppercorns, too!

1276
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:37,807
-Mikey...
-Coffee, teas, Goldfish.

1277
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,726
I'm gonna get these onions here.

1278
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,771
-Don't take the onions, put 'em back.
-No, no, no, no.

1279
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:44,314
-You don't need onions.
-I need...

1280
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,524
-Trail mix!
-I can't choose.

1281
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:48,151
This is a 2,000-piece puzzle.

1282
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:51,279
-This is a weapon.
-Yeah! Or we can make chicken parm.

1283
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:52,447
-It would be nice to have--
-What! You always buy this.

1284
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:54,115
You should buy the organic one.
I've been through this with you.

1285
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,658
I don't wanna talk about that
right now.

1286
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,535
Jeff, don't take the ginger snaps!

1287
01:07:57,577 --> 01:07:58,995
I know, but we might need...

1288
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,663
-Calm down, Jeff.
-Okay!

1289
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:02,665
I'm taking this Red Bull.

1290
01:08:04,834 --> 01:08:05,960
Where are we going?

1291
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:07,087
I don't know. Anywhere. Just pack!

1292
01:08:07,128 --> 01:08:08,588
I've never been on the run before.

1293
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,132
I mean, should I take a bikini,
in case it's gonna get hot?

1294
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:14,135
No! A bathing suit? Take socks!
Socks! I need my socks.

1295
01:08:14,177 --> 01:08:16,221
We gotta get the kids.
We gotta get my mom!

1296
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:18,264
Don't bring her into this!
We said twice a year.

1297
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:19,391
Christmas and Easter!

1298
01:08:20,558 --> 01:08:21,601
Oh, God! Okay. Okay.

1299
01:08:23,853 --> 01:08:26,272
-Okay. You know what?
-Karen.

1300
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:27,691
It's probably just a fuse.

1301
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:32,529
Because a house exploded, it could
just be a problem with the grid.

1302
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:33,613
Yeah.

1303
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,156
Maybe you should check
the fuse box, honey.

1304
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:36,908
-Okay, yeah.
-And I'm gonna just...

1305
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,368
stay here and pack.

1306
01:08:40,036 --> 01:08:43,123
Maybe you should
go with me to the fuse box.

1307
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:45,583
That way you're not alone.

1308
01:08:47,043 --> 01:08:48,503
Okay, here we go.

1309
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,714
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. There we go.

1310
01:08:50,755 --> 01:08:52,257
There it is. There it is.

1311
01:08:53,299 --> 01:08:54,342
Okay.

1312
01:08:56,636 --> 01:08:57,846
It was just the circuit breaker.

1313
01:08:57,887 --> 01:08:59,806
-It's okay.
-Good Lord!

1314
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:02,434
Don't scream. It's not what you think.

1315
01:09:02,475 --> 01:09:05,270
What, you didn't kidnap our friends
and tie them to chairs?

1316
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:09,232
It is what you think. But it's
not for the reasons you think.

1317
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,945
Dan is the one
selling secrets from MBI.

1318
01:09:14,362 --> 01:09:15,447
What?

1319
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:17,073
-You're right. She's very good.
-Told you.

1320
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:18,533
Dan, is that true?

1321
01:09:19,492 --> 01:09:21,411
And how are you two alive?
Your house exploded.

1322
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:24,581
Jeff, things aren't
always what they seem.

1323
01:09:24,622 --> 01:09:26,082
You should know that by now.

1324
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:45,643
So?

1325
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:47,854
How could you not tell me
you were feeling this way?

1326
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:48,938
Well, look...

1327
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,608
To be honest, you are not exactly
the easiest woman in the world

1328
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,069
-for a man to admit his fears to.
-What?

1329
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:57,322
How can you say that to me?
I'm compassionate and sensitive.

1330
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:58,573
You can say anything to me.

1331
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:03,119
Well, calling me a pussy
in Hebrew is not helping things.

1332
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:09,834
Run.

1333
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:21,388
You dove headfirst
through a plate glass window?

1334
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:23,390
It's not as hard as it seems.

1335
01:10:23,431 --> 01:10:25,392
Who's behind all this?
Who's trying to kill you?

1336
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:28,978
It's an international arms dealer
who calls himself The Scorpion.

1337
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:31,147
The Agency's been after him for years.

1338
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:34,025
And your friends here
were about to sell him these.

1339
01:10:38,196 --> 01:10:39,280
That's what we make at MBI?

1340
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:42,492
-What are these?
-Microchips.

1341
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:44,703
In the wrong hands,
the information on those chips

1342
01:10:44,744 --> 01:10:47,664
could be used to undermine the entire
U.S. missile defense system.

1343
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:50,875
For the last three months, Dan's been
smuggling them out of the building.

1344
01:10:51,918 --> 01:10:53,003
Prison-style.

1345
01:10:53,044 --> 01:10:54,963
Wait. Prison-style? What do you mean?

1346
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:58,049
I think that means he put 'em in
a balloon and stuck 'em up his butt.

1347
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,342
What?

1348
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:01,720
Oh, God!

1349
01:11:02,637 --> 01:11:04,139
Why did you do this, Dan?

1350
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:08,476
That's exactly what
we're about to find out, Jeff.

1351
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:12,439
Yeah.

1352
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,066
Tim!

1353
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:17,068
Spread your legs, Danny boy.

1354
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:19,696
Mrs. Jones has some work to do.

1355
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:21,281
Natalie...

1356
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:24,034
Jesus. Jeff.
Jeff, please, do something!

1357
01:11:24,075 --> 01:11:25,118
Either you talk...

1358
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,578
Jeff, stop her please!
She's a psychopath!

1359
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:30,123
Tim, can I just have a word with
you guys for one second, please?

1360
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:32,083
Please don't hurt me. Please.

1361
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,918
-Okay, okay.
-Get this psycho away from me, Jeff.

1362
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,003
Relax.

1363
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,839
We're excited that
you guys are still alive.

1364
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:41,760
But this is our basement. This is not
a Abu Ghraib, you know, scenario here.

1365
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:44,012
-Our kids play down here.
-I don't like it either.

1366
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:45,805
But this is
a national security situation.

1367
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:49,017
Yeah, but you can't torch a man's
scrotum and expect him to speak.

1368
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,143
You'd be surprised.

1369
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:54,064
These are human beings.
You gotta connect with them, okay?

1370
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:56,274
-Let me talk to 'em for two minutes.
-He's a people person.

1371
01:11:57,108 --> 01:11:58,276
You have 90 seconds.

1372
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:00,820
Okey-dokey.

1373
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,246
Okay, Meg.

1374
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,505
Dan, I want you to know...

1375
01:12:19,172 --> 01:12:22,467
like the HR department, this basement
is a place of non-judgment, okay?

1376
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:25,178
And even though
you stole from the company

1377
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:27,806
and betrayed your country
and cul-de-sac,

1378
01:12:27,847 --> 01:12:31,726
and, you know, placed microchips
in your darkest cavity,

1379
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:32,811
mistakes happen!

1380
01:12:32,852 --> 01:12:36,231
Oh, my God! Can we please waterboard
them and get this over with?

1381
01:12:37,023 --> 01:12:38,525
We live in confusing times.

1382
01:12:38,566 --> 01:12:42,112
And I think that the lines between
right and wrong become blurry.

1383
01:12:42,153 --> 01:12:45,031
It's hard to even know what those
words mean, isn't it, Dan?

1384
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,117
What is this? Good cop, good cop?

1385
01:12:47,158 --> 01:12:49,786
Look, I might not know
what's going on, on the sixth floor,

1386
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:53,998
but did you know that every time
an employee requests a raise

1387
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:55,542
it comes through the HR department?

1388
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,043
And I've seen your requests.

1389
01:12:57,085 --> 01:13:01,297
And I know that they've been denied,
every time, for the last five years.

1390
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:05,844
That's a lot of time, Dan. Lot of
good time you gave to the company?

1391
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:08,680
-Where's your piece of the pie?
-Exactly.

1392
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:10,390
You know how hard it is
to raise four children

1393
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:11,641
on a rocket scientist's salary?

1394
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:13,560
Oh, God! Shut up, you idiot!

1395
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:15,854
No! You shut up, Lady Macbeth!

1396
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:16,980
Okay.

1397
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:18,815
You're the one who pushed me
into this, you know that?

1398
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:21,776
With all your constant demands
and trendy needs.

1399
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:23,778
I did not tell you
to go on Jeff's computer

1400
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:25,530
and make a deal with an arms dealer!

1401
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:27,282
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

1402
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:30,285
Jeff...

1403
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:32,871
I was at the end of my rope.

1404
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,375
The financial pressure was crazy.
Groceries and tutors and...

1405
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:40,503
I got four kids under 13 in braces.

1406
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,131
Do you understand? Do you, Jeff?

1407
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:46,718
I do. You know I do. I mean...

1408
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,178
if kids have crooked teeth,

1409
01:13:48,219 --> 01:13:49,596
we can't have crooked teeth
in this society.

1410
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:52,265
This isn't Great Britain, you know?

1411
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:55,435
There's all sorts of things
you have to keep up with and...

1412
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:57,937
New tires for the minivan,
piano lessons,

1413
01:13:57,979 --> 01:13:59,814
you know, and, because all that...

1414
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,110
Carl Pronger is dead!

1415
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:06,905
Hang on! Get a hold of yourself!

1416
01:14:06,946 --> 01:14:09,657
I never wanted anyone
to get hurt, Jeff, I swear.

1417
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:11,284
We were protecting you.

1418
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,745
The Scorpion doesn't even
know who you are. Karen!

1419
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,373
Shut up, Meg! Brooklyn Loft is stupid.

1420
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:17,499
All right, not helping.

1421
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:18,625
I'm crying.

1422
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:19,751
Where did you get an onion?

1423
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,169
-Who? Me?
-Yeah, you.

1424
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:23,546
I got it from upstairs.
From our kitchen.

1425
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,972
Is this your phone?
Is this the Scorpion calling?

1426
01:14:33,014 --> 01:14:34,432
I'm gonna answer this
and you're gonna talk to him.

1427
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:35,934
And you're gonna lead us to him.

1428
01:14:35,975 --> 01:14:37,477
He'll sniff me out in a second.
You know what he's capable of.

1429
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:39,813
-Answer the phone now.
-Natalie...

1430
01:14:39,854 --> 01:14:41,022
No more games.

1431
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:44,567
Look, I can't. I'm not a spy!
I'm a soccer dad!

1432
01:14:44,609 --> 01:14:46,027
He never misses a game.

1433
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,904
Oh, my God. All right,
I'm gonna answer it.

1434
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,739
No, we can't.
Our cover was blown, remember?

1435
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,949
Well, I don't have a lot of options.

1436
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,283
What do you want me to do?

1437
01:14:56,996 --> 01:14:58,123
Hello?

1438
01:14:58,164 --> 01:15:00,250
<i>Hello? Mr. Rascal Flatts?</i>

1439
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:04,421
I needed a cover name.

1440
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,256
<i>Hello?</i>

1441
01:15:06,297 --> 01:15:07,465
Hi!

1442
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,635
Yes, this is Rascal.

1443
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,971
<i>Are you and your wife
ready to make the deal?</i>

1444
01:15:17,058 --> 01:15:19,644
Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I
are very excited about it.

1445
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,939
<i>Tomorrow night.
The Odyssey Hotel. 9:00 p.m.</i>

1446
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:27,402
<i>Go to the V-Bar.
A table will be reserved for you.</i>

1447
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,904
<i>Bring the requested item and wait.</i>

1448
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:32,824
V-Bar. Okay thank you very much.

1449
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:35,410
Just out of curiosity,
is there a dress code?

1450
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,706
I'll... I can look that up online.

1451
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:41,916
Okay.

1452
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:44,961
What have I done?

1453
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:48,340
No, no. You did everything great!
You did everything great.

1454
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:49,466
-Okay.
-You did!

1455
01:15:49,507 --> 01:15:51,718
-I did.
-Jeff and Karen, welcome to

1456
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,511
the sexy and exciting world

1457
01:15:53,553 --> 01:15:56,473
of international espionage
and covert operations.

1458
01:15:59,934 --> 01:16:02,103
Buddy, I think it's time
we get you in a proper suit.

1459
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,189
Nice! Is it an extra medium?

1460
01:16:04,230 --> 01:16:05,940
A killer dress.

1461
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:07,776
That's all of it?

1462
01:16:07,817 --> 01:16:10,528
This tie has been fitted
with a miniature surveillance mic.

1463
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:12,781
It's completely undetectable.

1464
01:16:12,822 --> 01:16:15,158
I don't know if I can walk in these.

1465
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:17,035
The heel is equipped
with a tracking device

1466
01:16:17,077 --> 01:16:19,537
that allows us to monitor
your every move.

1467
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:22,624
Natalie and I will secure
a position right upstairs on the roof.

1468
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:24,793
And establish a command center.

1469
01:16:24,834 --> 01:16:27,671
Now, you know at some point,
you're gonna have to put on pants.

1470
01:16:27,712 --> 01:16:29,881
Yeah. I know. I'm just nervous still.

1471
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:31,007
It's gonna be okay.

1472
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,676
Simple in and out job.

1473
01:16:32,717 --> 01:16:34,886
Make the exchange, leave the hotel.

1474
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:38,390
Got it. In and out.
Just out of curiosity,

1475
01:16:38,431 --> 01:16:41,142
what happens, you know,
worst-case scenario?

1476
01:16:41,976 --> 01:16:43,687
Worst-case scenario?

1477
01:16:43,728 --> 01:16:45,855
We radio for backup,
and we storm the place

1478
01:16:45,897 --> 01:16:48,024
with the full force
of the United States government.

1479
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:50,026
Okay. Got it.

1480
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,528
-Okay?
-Yeah.

1481
01:16:51,569 --> 01:16:54,531
You look good.
Don't forget those pants.

1482
01:17:20,306 --> 01:17:21,641
Reminds me of our first date.

1483
01:17:23,893 --> 01:17:25,061
And our second.

1484
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:28,857
What's wrong?

1485
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:34,112
We never really did finish
that conversation, did we?

1486
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:36,740
Well, the house did explode.

1487
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:38,033
So...

1488
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:43,163
Look, I just want you to know
I realized something last night

1489
01:17:43,204 --> 01:17:45,373
when I was about to fry
Dan's testicles.

1490
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:48,293
I know I'm not the best listener,

1491
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:49,919
but I can change.

1492
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,630
What? You don't think I can?

1493
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:55,091
No, no, no. I know you can.

1494
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:00,847
Just don't change too much, okay?

1495
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,225
Okay.

1496
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,117
Honey, are you ready?
What are you doing?

1497
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,620
I was just listening
to some Rascal Flatts.

1498
01:18:23,661 --> 01:18:25,538
-Trying to get into character.
-Oh, God!

1499
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,791
Patrick leaves these toys
on the stairs.

1500
01:18:27,832 --> 01:18:30,877
-Somebody's gonna hurt themselves.
-Karen!

1501
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:33,797
What? Do you like it? Is it too much?

1502
01:18:33,838 --> 01:18:36,049
No! Not at all. It's just enough.

1503
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:37,133
Thanks, honey.

1504
01:18:37,175 --> 01:18:38,968
Is this the lingerie
you were wearing the other day?

1505
01:18:39,010 --> 01:18:41,137
Yeah, I figured if we're gonna
do this, I should do it right.

1506
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:43,139
Yeah.

1507
01:18:44,182 --> 01:18:47,435
-You look so handsome.
-Thank you very much.

1508
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:48,978
How much time until
we have to be at the hotel?

1509
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:50,939
We've got 45 minutes.

1510
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:05,453
-Karen. Karen.
-Jeff,

1511
01:19:05,495 --> 01:19:07,288
your tie's stuck.

1512
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,457
-Karen!
-Sorry, honey.

1513
01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:16,673
What?

1514
01:19:18,174 --> 01:19:19,300
I think they're having sex.

1515
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,096
Goddamn it,
we don't have time for this.

1516
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:25,557
I mean, they're supposed to be
here in 45 minutes.

1517
01:19:28,351 --> 01:19:29,728
Nope, they are done.

1518
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,106
All right.

1519
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,845
Wow! Look, honey. Beautiful design!

1520
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,430
-Hey, Karen.
-Yeah?

1521
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:07,515
Thanks so much for the sex.

1522
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:15,815
Go.

1523
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:17,609
Hello!

1524
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:21,196
-Hi.
-Hi. We have a reservation for two

1525
01:20:21,237 --> 01:20:23,656
under the name Rascal Flatts.

1526
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:24,824
It's not our real name.

1527
01:20:24,866 --> 01:20:27,077
We're having an affair.

1528
01:20:27,118 --> 01:20:28,161
Come with me.

1529
01:20:31,539 --> 01:20:34,334
Hey, Tim. We're in the restaurant
right now. Everything's going okay.

1530
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:36,127
Honey, sushi.

1531
01:20:36,169 --> 01:20:39,130
There's sushi as well.
I'm gonna sign off for right now.

1532
01:20:39,839 --> 01:20:41,132
<i>Ciao.</i>

1533
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:44,594
-That's our table.
-No, this way.

1534
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:48,014
Really?

1535
01:20:51,601 --> 01:20:53,061
Thank you so much.

1536
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:57,565
Is this the line to
the little boys' room?

1537
01:20:57,607 --> 01:20:59,484
-I don't need to use it.
-Come.

1538
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,906
I'm confused. I...

1539
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,951
It's part of the...
I thought it was just gonna be us.

1540
01:21:07,992 --> 01:21:09,661
You fellas with The Scorpion?

1541
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:18,003
All right, they're on the move.

1542
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,380
Moving into position.

1543
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,768
Thank you.

1544
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:43,278
There he is. Rascal Flatts.

1545
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:44,904
You have any trouble
finding the place?

1546
01:21:44,946 --> 01:21:47,699
No. Your henchmen were very...
I'm a little ticklish there.

1547
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,075
Your henchmen were very helpful.

1548
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:52,454
This must be the wife. Wow! You guys
really dressed up for tonight.

1549
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:54,956
Thank you. Yeah.
Well, we don't get out very often.

1550
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,167
When we do, we really
like to make the most of it.

1551
01:21:57,208 --> 01:21:59,502
Awesome. Ivan?

1552
01:21:59,544 --> 01:22:01,087
All clear.

1553
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:04,174
Sorry about the frisking. You cannot
be too careful in my line of work.

1554
01:22:04,215 --> 01:22:05,633
Let me make it up to you

1555
01:22:05,675 --> 01:22:08,720
with some very expensive,
very delicious champagne.

1556
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,848
Wow! Look at that gun.

1557
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:13,016
And by the way,

1558
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:16,353
you two have gotta try this dip.
It's amazing.

1559
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:18,938
It's a cheat day for me, so I went
a little crazy with room service.

1560
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,273
I hope you don't mind.

1561
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:22,859
Mrs. Flatts makes a great
seven-layer dip. I'll tell you that.

1562
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:24,194
I bet she does.

1563
01:22:24,235 --> 01:22:28,406
I do. The secret is an extra layer.
An eight-layer dip.

1564
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,533
Sneaky! I love that.

1565
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:35,872
Do I know you from somewhere?

1566
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:38,667
<i>I seriously doubt it.</i>

1567
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:40,919
<i>He's a people person.</i>

1568
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,506
Come on, Jeff. Stay calm.
Just do what we talked about.

1569
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:48,218
Well, did the people person
bring this person his computer chips?

1570
01:22:48,885 --> 01:22:51,429
Yes. Yes, yes.
You'll find them right here.

1571
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:52,889
Careful.

1572
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,407
Denver, 2010.

1573
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:13,368
Were you at the National
Aerospace Convention?

1574
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,787
Because I think we were
in the same focus group.

1575
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:17,914
Are we still doing this?

1576
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,291
No, we're n-- it's done.
It's really done. It's so done.

1577
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,960
Why does he keep
asking those questions?

1578
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,838
I don't think he can help it.
It's just what he does.

1579
01:23:24,879 --> 01:23:27,424
He connects with people.

1580
01:23:27,465 --> 01:23:29,592
<i>-Perfect, as promised.
-Shit.</i>

1581
01:23:29,634 --> 01:23:30,969
<i>Ivan?</i>

1582
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:37,475
Okay. Here we go. Thank you.

1583
01:23:37,517 --> 01:23:39,602
-Okay! We got it. Great.
-Yeah. That checks out.

1584
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:42,022
Well, pleasure doing business
with both of you.

1585
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:44,149
Thank you, Mr. Scorpion and friends.

1586
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,901
Thank you. Yeah.
Okay. Grab that stuff.

1587
01:23:48,903 --> 01:23:50,864
Hey! You drop your little ball.

1588
01:23:50,905 --> 01:23:52,615
That's fine. We have...
I have plenty of those.

1589
01:23:52,657 --> 01:23:54,576
Keep it. Keep it. It's a...

1590
01:23:54,617 --> 01:23:56,286
-Excuse me.
-Stop!

1591
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,420
You're the HR guy.

1592
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:07,964
No, he's not. He's an engineer.
He... Dr. Flatts.

1593
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,841
-Yeah, I'm in the rocket sciences.
-He went to college!

1594
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:12,677
-He's very smart. MIT.
-No.

1595
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,554
No. You were right.

1596
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:16,264
We have met before.

1597
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:21,936
See from '02 to '05,
I was a mid-level drone at MBI.

1598
01:24:21,978 --> 01:24:25,231
-And you are Jeff Gaffney.
-No.

1599
01:24:25,273 --> 01:24:26,900
-Human Resources.
-Wrong.

1600
01:24:26,941 --> 01:24:30,111
Yeah. You helped me
with my "suicidal depression."

1601
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:33,823
With your little trust exercises
and stress balls!

1602
01:24:33,865 --> 01:24:35,575
This entire thing is a setup!

1603
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:37,118
Goddamn it, Jeff!

1604
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:40,413
Decoys have been made.
I repeat, decoys have been made.

1605
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:41,831
We need to extract. Do you copy?

1606
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:44,626
Carlos, take a team out,
lock the hallway down.

1607
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:47,128
Yuri, take four guys up
the stairwell to the roof.

1608
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:49,714
Radio the helicopter, we are getting
the hell out of here.

1609
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:52,676
We need backup to extract
the decoys. Do you copy?

1610
01:24:52,717 --> 01:24:54,886
<i>Negative. Collateral damage.</i>

1611
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:57,889
<i>We cannot engage in a public arena.
Pull back and abort.</i>

1612
01:24:57,931 --> 01:24:59,224
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1613
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:01,726
<i>Jones, do you copy?</i>

1614
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:05,730
Boris, get some ice tongs
and a cigarette lighter.

1615
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:08,483
<i>Goddamn it, Jones. Do you copy?</i>

1616
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:13,279
Copy, copy. Pulling out.
I repeat, pulling out.

1617
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:15,156
We'll meet you
at the extraction point.

1618
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,912
You really wanna
just leave them in there?

1619
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,288
Of course not.

1620
01:25:23,456 --> 01:25:25,333
They're our neighbors.

1621
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,003
Sweetie, everything's fine, okay?

1622
01:25:28,044 --> 01:25:30,296
That's why I rent the extra henchmen,
for situations like this.

1623
01:25:30,338 --> 01:25:32,090
-Is it Peter? No.
-That's why I paid

1624
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,758
-for the whole floor.
-Honey, what are you doing?

1625
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,760
-I'm trying to figure out his name.
-Chopper to the jet.

1626
01:25:35,802 --> 01:25:37,012
We'll be in Jakarta by morning,

1627
01:25:37,053 --> 01:25:38,346
-and when we get there, I--
-Bruce.

1628
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,933
You talking to me?

1629
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,519
I remember your name.
Your name is Bruce.

1630
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:46,521
Bruce Springstine.

1631
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:49,774
I... No, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

1632
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:52,235
Nah, I'm the one that mediated
your parking space dispute.

1633
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:55,321
Is that what caused you
to go into a life of crime?

1634
01:25:55,363 --> 01:25:57,991
A bruised ego
over a lousy parking space?

1635
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:00,577
Jesus Christ! What is this?
Amateur night?

1636
01:26:00,618 --> 01:26:01,786
Wait a second.

1637
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:04,622
Your name is Bruce Springstine?

1638
01:26:04,664 --> 01:26:07,292
Yes, Ivan, it is.
It's Bruce Springstine

1639
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:09,377
and it's a perfectly good name
like any other name.

1640
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:12,213
And you wanted us
to call you The Boss?

1641
01:26:12,255 --> 01:26:14,799
I didn't want you guys
to call me "The Boss."

1642
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:16,593
I wanted you to call me, "Boss."

1643
01:26:16,634 --> 01:26:20,055
All right? And that's just
for simplicity's sake. Okay?

1644
01:26:20,096 --> 01:26:21,181
That's just sad.

1645
01:26:21,222 --> 01:26:24,309
And that parking space thing
was bullshit, all right?

1646
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:27,312
I'd been there for three years!
They still had me in Lot D!

1647
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:30,065
That's the other side
of the highway, okay?

1648
01:26:30,106 --> 01:26:31,399
I had to cross the...

1649
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:32,859
-The footbridge thing. Yeah!
-The little... The footbridge!

1650
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:34,361
A footbridge, every day,

1651
01:26:34,402 --> 01:26:35,528
rain or shine!

1652
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:36,946
So, thank you.

1653
01:26:36,988 --> 01:26:38,656
-I am really going to enjoy this.
-Okay.

1654
01:26:38,698 --> 01:26:40,075
-Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
-No!

1655
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:42,160
Good. SEAL team's here.

1656
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,953
Go, go, go! Get down,
get down, get down!

1657
01:26:43,995 --> 01:26:48,249
Go, boys! Go, go, go!
Shock and awe! Shock and awe!

1658
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:54,839
Honey, I can't hear anything.

1659
01:26:54,881 --> 01:26:56,841
They're silent killers.
That's how they got Bin Laden.

1660
01:26:56,883 --> 01:26:58,968
-Let's just stay down, okay?
-Okay.

1661
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:11,606
Where's the backup?
Those guys are with him.

1662
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:13,233
There's no backup, Jeff.

1663
01:27:13,274 --> 01:27:15,026
They pulled out
when you blew your cover.

1664
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:18,029
What do you mean there's no backup?

1665
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:20,699
You're what they call
"collateral damage."

1666
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,367
<i>That's not good. I saw it on Homeland!</i>

1667
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:25,036
What do you me-- You didn't say
anything about collateral damage!

1668
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:27,038
I asked you about the worst-case
scenario and you said,

1669
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,124
"Well, the worst-case scenario,
I'll have backup."

1670
01:27:29,165 --> 01:27:32,836
Well, this is worse! This is worse
than the worst-case scenario.

1671
01:27:32,877 --> 01:27:34,254
You lied to our faces.

1672
01:27:34,295 --> 01:27:38,717
I did not lie to you. Now, I may
have left out a few key details...

1673
01:27:38,758 --> 01:27:40,093
That's a lie, Timothy!

1674
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:42,220
That is lying by omission.
That's textbook--

1675
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:45,682
You know what? My whole job is lying.
Okay? That's why I fucking hate it!

1676
01:27:48,059 --> 01:27:50,186
-I'm sorry, Jeff.
-You're apologizing to him?

1677
01:27:50,228 --> 01:27:52,480
You can't possibly care
about this loser.

1678
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:55,400
You know what? I actually
do care about this loser.

1679
01:27:56,651 --> 01:27:58,945
I mean, you and I live
in a world where everybody lies.

1680
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:01,906
And everybody hides everything
and obfuscates.

1681
01:28:01,948 --> 01:28:04,200
But, not... Not Jeff Gaffney.

1682
01:28:05,368 --> 01:28:08,621
Jeff doesn't live in that world.
He's an honest person.

1683
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:11,666
He's forthright, he's friendly.
He's a good neighbor.

1684
01:28:12,667 --> 01:28:16,421
Do you have any idea how much
courage that takes? Real courage?

1685
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,215
For my money, he's the bravest guy
in this room.

1686
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:23,011
-Please. Spare me the morality!
-Hey!

1687
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:25,263
Just hear me out, all right?

1688
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:27,390
Look, the Gaffneys,
they don't belong in our world.

1689
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,351
We don't. We really don't.

1690
01:28:29,392 --> 01:28:31,853
Okay? They're too good for that.

1691
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:34,189
Why don't we let them go
back to their world?

1692
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:36,149
And then you and I, we,

1693
01:28:36,191 --> 01:28:37,776
can settle this here?

1694
01:28:37,817 --> 01:28:39,486
Here in our world.

1695
01:28:39,527 --> 01:28:42,489
You guys can go murder each other
and stuff. Just leave us out of this.

1696
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:44,699
You know what? I'm just gonna take
care of everything myself. Bruno,

1697
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,035
lay the plastic sheeting out. I don't
wanna lose the security deposit.

1698
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:49,829
-Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
-Can I finish a thought today?

1699
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:52,540
I'm so sorry, Mr. Scorpion.

1700
01:28:52,582 --> 01:28:54,709
But, Natalie,

1701
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:56,961
ever since we tried on
underwear together...

1702
01:28:57,003 --> 01:28:58,797
I'm sorry. You talking to her?

1703
01:28:58,838 --> 01:29:00,256
Finish your thought.

1704
01:29:00,298 --> 01:29:02,467
I realized something.

1705
01:29:03,968 --> 01:29:05,345
I've been living a lie, also.

1706
01:29:09,849 --> 01:29:11,059
Karen!

1707
01:29:11,935 --> 01:29:12,977
What is happening to my life?

1708
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:28,410
Oh, my God! How long
have you been living that lie?

1709
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:29,494
Honey! What? No!

1710
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:31,788
I didn't mean it. I just had to
get the knife to her somehow!

1711
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:36,167
Okay! I get it now. God! Thank God!
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

1712
01:29:49,764 --> 01:29:50,890
It's raining men!

1713
01:29:55,895 --> 01:29:56,980
You guys okay?

1714
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:59,816
Grab the chips and follow us.
Come on, let's go.

1715
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:09,784
-Chopper's ready.
-Yeah, get 'em.

1716
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:10,869
And get the chips!

1717
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:14,789
Get back, get back, get back!

1718
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:22,255
-I'm almost out.
-Me too.

1719
01:30:23,089 --> 01:30:24,341
What are we gonna do?

1720
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:29,637
-We'll have to jump for it.
-Jump? Jump from where?

1721
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:30,847
Down there.

1722
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:32,265
There's a pool down below.

1723
01:30:33,224 --> 01:30:34,851
It's our only chance.

1724
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:36,353
Did you think any of this through?

1725
01:30:36,394 --> 01:30:37,729
Okay.

1726
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:41,358
Where are you going?

1727
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,947
Jeff? Jeff!

1728
01:30:48,948 --> 01:30:50,617
Jeff. Jeff are you okay?

1729
01:30:50,658 --> 01:30:51,993
-I just farted.
-Buddy!

1730
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:53,536
You can't jump through
the window like that.

1731
01:30:53,578 --> 01:30:55,789
That's triple pane glass!
You gotta break it first.

1732
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,582
Appreciate the effort though.

1733
01:30:57,624 --> 01:30:59,125
Scoot back, everybody, all right?
Just scoot back.

1734
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,629
Get out of the way.

1735
01:31:06,716 --> 01:31:07,759
Really?

1736
01:31:08,009 --> 01:31:09,052
Stand back!

1737
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:10,345
What?

1738
01:31:15,308 --> 01:31:16,434
Where'd you get that?

1739
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:18,061
I picked it up off a dead guy.

1740
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:19,187
-I thought he didn't need it.
-Run! Out of the window!

1741
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:20,438
All right. Come on.
We're doing this. Let's go!

1742
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,357
-Now! Now!
-Jump! Jump! Jump!

1743
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,741
It's okay, everybody. It's okay.

1744
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:32,951
Where's Jeff?

1745
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,993
Guys, where's Jeff?

1746
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:39,457
Jeff! Jeff, you've gotta...

1747
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:41,209
-Jeff, you've gotta jump!
-Jeff!

1748
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:42,836
Give me a second.

1749
01:31:42,877 --> 01:31:44,838
-Jeff, jump! Please!
-Just run and jump!

1750
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:49,634
This is perfect.

1751
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:53,054
You've been a pain
in my ass all day, Jeff.

1752
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:56,141
Okay, li... Bru... Mr. Scorpion,

1753
01:31:56,182 --> 01:31:58,268
we all make choices in life and I...

1754
01:31:58,309 --> 01:32:00,520
I'm not being judgmental,
I promise you,

1755
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:03,732
but do you really think that violence
is the solution? There's this exer--

1756
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,319
He's all yours, gravity.

1757
01:32:18,913 --> 01:32:20,498
And that's why you don't sting the...

1758
01:32:30,258 --> 01:32:31,676
Always have plan B.

1759
01:32:52,989 --> 01:32:54,949
I know it seemed a lot higher.

1760
01:32:54,991 --> 01:32:56,284
Thank you very much.
That's for you. Keep it all.

1761
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,911
Maybe you could videotape
that and put it online.

1762
01:32:57,952 --> 01:32:59,704
Where did you get the gun from?

1763
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:01,706
No. I don't think we're
gonna keep any of that online.

1764
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:02,957
That would get a lot of hits.

1765
01:33:02,999 --> 01:33:04,376
And I lined it up, and smashed.

1766
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:05,960
Because there's shooting...

1767
01:33:06,002 --> 01:33:07,379
Probably wanna keep it
a little on the down low.

1768
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,798
Yes. Of course.
Yeah, no, no, of course. Yes. Yes.

1769
01:33:09,839 --> 01:33:10,965
I'm just saying.

1770
01:33:11,007 --> 01:33:12,634
I'm so proud of you guys.

1771
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:14,594
-You guys wanna come inside?
-Yeah, come in.

1772
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:15,720
Where are you guys staying?

1773
01:33:16,888 --> 01:33:18,640
-You could stay with us!
-Stay with us!

1774
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:20,975
Why wouldn't you stay with us?
We have a pull-out couch.

1775
01:33:21,017 --> 01:33:24,020
You can borrow some of my boxer briefs
if you need anything to lounge in.

1776
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,855
-I've got a Wii.
-We've got a flat screen TV!

1777
01:33:25,897 --> 01:33:27,482
We have free Wi-Fi.

1778
01:33:27,524 --> 01:33:30,235
-You guys are great! Really.
-It's very nice of you to offer.

1779
01:33:30,276 --> 01:33:31,403
But...

1780
01:33:31,444 --> 01:33:32,737
Our ride is coming.

1781
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:35,824
Yeah. Yeah.
You got your things you have to do.

1782
01:33:35,865 --> 01:33:37,200
Your missions.

1783
01:33:45,291 --> 01:33:46,543
Is that an Uber?

1784
01:33:46,584 --> 01:33:47,877
Sort of.

1785
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,214
Hug?

1786
01:33:51,256 --> 01:33:53,341
-Just a hug?
-Just a hug.

1787
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:56,761
Thank you. You're an amazing woman.

1788
01:33:57,762 --> 01:33:58,972
Thank you.

1789
01:34:01,016 --> 01:34:02,934
You made an incredible life
for yourself here, Jeff.

1790
01:34:03,852 --> 01:34:06,312
Just remember to leave the cul-de-sac,
every now and again.

1791
01:34:06,938 --> 01:34:09,315
You'd be surprised
at what you find out there.

1792
01:34:11,651 --> 01:34:12,694
We'll remember.

1793
01:34:13,653 --> 01:34:15,321
-Time to go.
-Yes.

1794
01:34:19,659 --> 01:34:21,453
Where's the driver?

1795
01:34:22,454 --> 01:34:23,872
Right here.

1796
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:26,499
There's no driver in the car.

1797
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,293
If they're shooting at us,
I get to drive.

1798
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:29,961
Now you wanna drive.

1799
01:34:30,003 --> 01:34:31,129
I see how it works.

1800
01:34:32,505 --> 01:34:33,882
You get to drive the good car.

1801
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,676
Bye, you guys!

1802
01:34:45,185 --> 01:34:46,227
Okay.

1803
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:52,442
You know, it's Parents Day
at the camp tomorrow.

1804
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:25,684
This is going straight to Facebook.
Keep sucking!

1805
01:35:26,559 --> 01:35:28,269
-That's good.
-What does it taste like?

1806
01:35:28,895 --> 01:35:30,814
It tastes like Mikey's sock.

1807
01:35:30,855 --> 01:35:32,691
But I mean that in a good way.
Here, try it.

1808
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:35,151
I miss Mikey's little feet
and his socks.

1809
01:35:35,193 --> 01:35:36,528
Yeah. Here.

1810
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:39,531
Okay, ready?

1811
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,534
Oh, God! That really hurt.

1812
01:35:44,285 --> 01:35:45,495
What?

1813
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:48,331
Oh, my God!

1814
01:35:48,373 --> 01:35:50,500
-Guys!
-Natalie! Tim!

1815
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:52,210
You've gotta be kidding me!

1816
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:53,878
What?

1817
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,006
-Can I take this?
-Are you kidding me?

1818
01:35:56,047 --> 01:35:57,632
We are here because of you.

1819
01:35:57,674 --> 01:35:58,842
You told us about this place

1820
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:00,301
and that's why we came!

1821
01:36:00,343 --> 01:36:02,178
You are here. In Marrakesh.

1822
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:03,805
-That's a good memory. Wow.
-Amazing!

1823
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:05,015
-What?
-That's amazing.

1824
01:36:05,056 --> 01:36:06,725
-My God.
-You have a baby!

1825
01:36:06,766 --> 01:36:09,019
-Yes, he just fell asleep.
-He just fell asleep.

1826
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:11,229
You had a baby? You old dogs!

1827
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:13,690
Does that mean
you guys left the agency?

1828
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:15,483
-Well, yeah. It's a very...
-Well...

1829
01:36:15,525 --> 01:36:16,818
-Yeah?
-Long story.

1830
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,112
But we can't really
get into it right now.

1831
01:36:19,154 --> 01:36:22,282
But, it's good to see you!

1832
01:36:22,323 --> 01:36:24,576
Jeff, do me a big favor?
Will you just...

1833
01:36:24,617 --> 01:36:26,286
-scoot a little bit to your right?
-Yeah. Sure thing.

1834
01:36:26,327 --> 01:36:27,370
Thank you!

1835
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:29,372
I am blown away, you guys.
This is un--

1836
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,875
Jeff, I don't want you
to turn around right now,

1837
01:36:31,916 --> 01:36:35,378
but there are four guys in fezzes
behind you on the...

1838
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,463
Jeff, I just said don't turn around.

1839
01:36:36,504 --> 01:36:38,423
Jeff, I just specifically
asked you not to turn around.

1840
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,216
I know but you said there are four
guys in fezzes behind me.

1841
01:36:40,258 --> 01:36:41,509
We're in Morocco.
There's a lot of fezzes.

1842
01:36:41,551 --> 01:36:43,053
But it's human nature,
I think, to turn around

1843
01:36:43,094 --> 01:36:44,721
to something like that.
Don't you think?

1844
01:36:44,763 --> 01:36:46,264
Honey. We blew their cover again.

1845
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:48,350
-No! No.
-What?

1846
01:36:48,391 --> 01:36:50,018
-We should feed the baby?
-I think we should feed the baby.

1847
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:51,561
-If you can just pass me the bottle...
-We blew their cover?

1848
01:36:51,603 --> 01:36:52,937
-...that would be great.
-Darn it.

1849
01:36:52,979 --> 01:36:55,190
-Can you hold this bag for me?
-Do you mind holding the baby?

1850
01:36:55,231 --> 01:36:58,026
Before you freak out,
it's just a baby.

1851
01:36:58,068 --> 01:37:00,028
-All right? Don't worry.
-Kids are great! I have pictures.

1852
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,112
-Karen, how do you get--
-I'll tell you what.

1853
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:02,781
Just put it in here and show me.

1854
01:37:02,822 --> 01:37:04,240
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.

1855
01:37:04,282 --> 01:37:05,742
Okay. I see now.

1856
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:07,535
Okay? See what that is?

1857
01:37:07,577 --> 01:37:09,454
-It's okay, honey.
-I need you to breathe.

1858
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:11,081
-You can do it.
-You've done this before.

1859
01:37:11,122 --> 01:37:14,584
On three, I want you to get down,
and take cover. Okay?

1860
01:37:14,626 --> 01:37:15,669
One...

1861
01:37:15,710 --> 01:37:16,961
Two...

1862
01:37:17,003 --> 01:37:19,047
Jesus, Jeff!
Everybody down, right now.

1863
01:37:24,302 --> 01:37:26,763
-I miss those guys.
-Me too.
